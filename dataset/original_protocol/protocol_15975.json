    "HSCs are the precursor cells of fibrogenic myofibroblasts in the liver. Isolated cells are grown in a monolayer and should only be subjected to limited cell expansion. After passage two, cells can be frozen and stored for future experiments. Controlled population doublings are achieved by plating HSCs at the cell densities specified in this protocol, which also ensures that the cells are maintained at an exponential growth phase throughout the primary culture. Depending on the donor source and handling by commercial vendors, the passage number where cells are still suitable for IL11 experiments can vary. We recommend measuring IL11RA protein expression to monitor primary cell integrity (see Introduction).\nEpithelial cells form a thin protective layer around the outer layers of body organs and vessels and express IL11RA. Similar to fibroblasts, they are frequently used in an in vitro model system to study tissue repair and remodeling. In disease, epithelial cells can be converted into stromal-like cells through a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This disrupts secretion, sensing, selective absorption of the epithelial layer, and eventually impairs organ function. Here we provide details for the culturing of HRPTEpiCs from ScienCell Research Laboratories. These cells are isolated from the human kidney, cryopreserved at passage one and supplied frozen. This protocol is optimized to reduce the loss of IL11RA expression in vitro and we recommend measuring IL11RA protein expression to monitor primary cell integrity (see Introduction). The EMT can be monitored by assessing ACTA2 and COL1A1 expression (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-prot-0005]) as well as intracellular signaling (see Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-prot-0008]).\nMaterials\nHuman Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSCs; ScienCell Research Laboratories, cat. no. 5300)\nSteCM complete medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-rec-0018])\nHuman Renal Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells (HRPTEpiCs; ScienCell, cat. no. 4100)\nEpiCM complete medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-rec-0009])",

Place the vial of frozen human HSCs or HRPTEpiCs in a 37°C water bath. Hold vial with forceps and rotate vial gently until the contents completely thaw.\nIMPORTANT: Work quickly once the cells have been thawed to ensure high recovery and viability. Do not centrifuge or vortex the cells at this stage.",
    "4. In a biosafety cabinet, carefully remove the cap of the human HSCs or HRPTEpiCs vial without touching the interior threads. Gently resuspend the cells with a 1-ml pipet and dispense the contents of the entire vial into a poly-L-lysine-coated T-75 culture flask containing 10 ml pre-warmed SteCM complete medium.\n5. Incubate cells in a 37°C, CO2 incubator.\nDo not disturb the culture for at least 16 hr after initiation. All incubations are performed in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\nMaintaining the culture\n6. After at least 16 hr of incubation, perform a medium change by removing and discarding spent medium and replacing it with 10 ml pre-warmed SteCM or EpiCM complete medium.\nThis step is to ensure that residual dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and any unattached or dead cells are removed from the culture.\n7. Change medium every 2 days until the cells reach ∼90% confluence.\nThese cells are now considered to be at the end of Passage 1 (P1). The cells should reach ∼90% confluence in 3-4 days.\nSubculturing\n8. Once the cells have reached ∼90% confluence, remove and discard spent cell culture medium from the T-75 culture flask.\n9. Wash cells twice with 5 ml DPBS and discard the last wash.\nGently add DPBS to the side of the flask away from the attached cell layer to avoid dislodging the cells; swirl the flask back and forth several times. For primary culture, use a buffered salt solution that is Ca2+ and Mg2+ free to wash cells. Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the salt solution can cause cells to stick together.\n10. Add 4 ml of dissociation reagent (TrypLE™ Express) to the cells and gently rock container to get complete coverage of the cell layer. Incubate cells at 37°C for 3-5 min.",
    "An alternative to traditional trypsin/EDTA is TrypLE Express with phenol red. It is stable at room temperature, does not require inactivation by an inhibitor, and is gentle on cells which results in high viability rates.\n11. After 3-5 min of incubation, observe flask under the microscope to monitor for cell detachment.\nGently tap the flask to the expedite cell detachment. If cells are <90% detached, return the flask to the 37°C tissue culture incubator and incubate, checking for dissociation every 30 s.\n12. When ≥90% of the cells have detached, tilt the flask at an ∼45° angle to allow the detached cells to collect at the bottom corner of the flask.\n13. Add 8 ml (or twice the volume of dissociation reagent used) of pre-warmed SteCM or EpiCM complete medium and disperse cells by pipetting the medium over the cell layer surface several times.\n14. Transfer cell suspension to a 50-ml conical tube and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature (25°C).\n15. Discard supernatant and gently resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml pre-warmed SteCM or EpiCM complete medium.\n16. Remove a 10-μl aliquot of cells and mix with 10 μl trypan blue and perform a cell count.\nThe total number of cells and the percentage of cell viability can be counted manually using a hemocytometer or with an automated cell counting system such as the Countess® II Automated Cell Counter.\n17. The cells are then split at a 1:2 ratio by first diluting the cell suspension with SteCM or EpiCM complete medium and then seeding cells into two new poly-L-lysine coated T-75 flasks.",
    "This is equivalent to seeding ∼0.5 × 106 cells per T-75 flask. Cells should not be seeded at lower densities. The expected doubling time for human HSCs or HRPTEpiCs cultured in SteCM or EpiCM complete medium is ∼3-4 days. The culture is now considered as Passage 2 (P2). Cells can be frozen at this stage (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-prot-0004]).\n18. Incubate cells in a 37°C, CO2 incubator.\n19. On the next day, change medium with 10 ml pre-warmed SteCM or EpiCM complete medium to remove unattached/dead cells. Subsequently, perform a fresh medium change every other day, until culture reaches ∼90% confluent.\n20. To acquire more cells for experiments, cells are subcultured an additional time by repeating steps 8-19. Cells obtained from the step above are split in a 1:2 ratio by seeding cells from two T-75 flasks into four new T-75 flasks.\nOnce ∼90% confluent, these Passage 3 cells are to be used directly for experiments and should not be expanded further or frozen. This is to ensure that the cells retain their physiologically relevant response to cytokine stimulation.\n21. The cells are cultured until they are ∼90% confluent, before being seeded in 6-well or 96-well plates for further downstream experiments as described in Support Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-prot-0005]-5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-prot-0008].",
    "Pulmonary fibroblasts are a frequently used in vitro model system to study lung tissue repair and remodeling. HLFs can be isolated from healthy human lung tissue. These cells are adherent and adopt a spindle-like morphology when grown on plastic tissue culture dishes. Lung fibroblasts must be grown in monolayers before being stimulated with profibrotic cytokines. After passage two, cells can also be frozen and stored for future experiments.

    "In this alternate protocol, we describe a method of fibroblast isolation from wild type C57BL/6J mice by explanting digested lung tissue, followed by cell purification and culture maintenance of mouse primary lung fibroblasts. It is important to highlight that due to the highly proliferative nature of lung fibroblasts in culture, these primary cells enter replicative senescence beyond Passage 5 and hence should be used for experiments only at early passages. We have shown previously that mouse lung fibroblasts isolated using this protocol retain many of their in vivo effector functions including myofibroblast differentiation, cell migration and invasion, and extracellular matrix secretion when stimulated with various profibrotic stimuli (Ng et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-bib-0010]).

    "Studies in our laboratory have shown that IL11 causes hepatocyte dysfunction which underlies non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) disease pathology (Widjaja et al., 2019b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-bib-0015]). In primary hepatocyte cultures, IL11-treatment induces hepatocyte dysfunction by activating ERK, JNK, and STAT3 signaling (Dong, Viswanathan, Adami, & Chothani, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-bib-0004]; Widjaja, Dong, Adami, Viswanathan, & Ng, 2019a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.251#cpz1251-bib-0014]). This protocol describes optimized culture and experimentation conditions for the study of IL11 signaling in hepatocytes. Once they have been recovered from the initial thaw cycle, primary human hepatocytes are used directly for downstream experiments. When seeded at low densities (<4.0 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate), hepatocytes will de-differentiate and fail to replicate in vivo cellular physiology.
