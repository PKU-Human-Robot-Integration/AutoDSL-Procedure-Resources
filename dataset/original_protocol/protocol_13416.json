    "The protocol was carried out in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.\nThe patients and families were informed of the purpose of shooting and making the surgical video, and informed consent was obtained.\n1. Patient data and grouping\nNOTE: From January 2018 to June 2020, laparoscopic incisional hernia repair using the IPOM method was performed during gastrointestinal, hernia, and abdominal surgery at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. After obtaining informed consent, a total of 84 patients with incisional hernias were included in the study.\nEnroll patients based on the inclusion criteria (adult patients diagnosed with incisional hernias) and exclusion criteria (age ≤18 years or ≥80 years; emergency operation; strangulated incisional hernia; recurrent incisional hernia; the presence of severe organ dysfunction).\n\tNOTE: The characteristics of the two groups, including the patient's age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), the length of time the hernia was present, and the maximum size of the hernia ring defect, are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in characteristics between the two groups (all P > 0.05).\nAll the operations were performed by the same group of surgeons, who received standardized training and had rich experience in laparoscopic surgery.\n2. Necessary preparation and examination before the operation\nCarry out preoperative examinations, including routine blood tests, blood biochemistry tests, routine urine tests, a routine stool test, a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram, and an abdominal CT.\nFor a giant incisional hernia, use preoperative botulinum toxin A (BTA) and preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum (PPP) for the surgical preparation11.",
    "Administer fentanyl at 4 µg/kg using another pump at a rate of 250 µg/min simultaneously with propofol administration. Intravenously inject cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) after the patient is anesthetized.\n\t\nSubsequently, intubate the patient with the help of an experienced anesthesiologist 4 min after the muscle relaxant injection. Next, mechanically ventilate the patient with sevoflurane 1% inhalation with the following respiratory parameters: tidal volume, 8 mL/kg; respiratory rate, 12 breaths per minute.\n\t\tNOTE: The anesthetic maintenance drugs were sevoflurane 1%-3%, propofol 1-3 mg/kg/h, remifentanil 0.05-0.3 µg/kg/min, cisatracurium 0.15-0.2 mg/kg, and 1/5-1/3 of the additional induction amount every 0.5-1 h12.\nUse 0.5% PVP-I disinfectant to disinfect the surgical area. The upper part of the disinfection range should reach the nipple line on both sides, the lower part should reach the pubic symphysis, and both sides should reach the midaxillary line.\nAfter endotracheal intubation, place the trocars using the method of ﻿modelized trocar arrangement. Determine the locations of the trocar placement based on the preoperative computed tomography (CT) images and the assessment of the abdominal adhesions13.\n\tNOTE: For example, the case in this video is a lower abdominal incision hernia, which requires a total of five puncture tubes. A 12 mm puncture device is placed 10 cm above the belly button, 12 mm and 5 mm puncture tubes are placed at the left and right clavicular midlines, and 5 mm puncture tubes are placed at the left and right axillary midlines.\nEstablish carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum, and maintain the pneumoperitoneum pressure at 13 mmHg.\nExplore the whole abdominal cavity, evaluate the degree of abdominal adhesion around the hernia ring, and separate the adhesion.\nClose the defect of the hernia ring by continuous suture with a 1-0 barbed suture.\n3. Measurement of the size of the hernia ring defect and anti-adhesion mesh marking",
    "Select an appropriate size anti-adhesion mesh (see Table of Materials) according to the size of the hernia ring defect, and then mark the mesh with a sterile marking pen as described below.\n\tNOTE: A commercially available anti-adhesion mesh was used here, which contains a polypropylene mesh on the anterior side with an absorbable hydrogel barrier on the posterior side for laparoscopic hernia repair. The hydrogel barrier on the mesh prevents adhesion, and the mesh on this side should face the viscera.\n\t\nMeasure and mark the approximate range of the incisional hernia on the abdominal wall surface with a sterile ruler and marking pen (Figure 1A).The size of the hernia ring defect can also be measured by a preoperative CT examination.\nPlace the ruler parallel to the longitudinal axis of the hernia defect, and measure the maximum longitudinal length of the defect (Figure 1B).\nSelect an appropriately sized anti-adhesion mesh according to the size of the hernia ring defect. Ensure that the coverage of the mesh exceeds the edge of the defect by at least 5 cm. For example, for an incisional hernia defect of size 7 cm x 5 cm, use a mesh approximately 20 cm x 15 cm in size (Figure 1C).\nMark the longitudinal length of the defect on the mesh, and mark the nail gun fixation points at intervals of 5 cm on the longitudinal axis. Then, extend the fixation points more than 5 cm along the marked line to the edge of the mesh, which pertains to the \"alignment\" (Figure 1D).\nMark the nail gun fixation points evenly every 2-3 cm along the edge of the mesh, which pertains to the \"contraposition\" (Figure 1E).",
    "Finally, ensure that the fixing points of the nail gun are uniformly marked 2 cm from the longitudinal axis of the defect on both sides, with an interval of 3 cm (Figure 1F).\n4. Mesh placement method\nRoll the mesh such that the anti-adhesion surface will face the abdominal wall. Place the rolled mesh into the abdominal cavity through the 12 mm puncture hole, and then unfold the mesh under laparoscopic guidance (see Table of Materials, (Figure 2B).\nReduce the pneumoperitoneum pressure to 8-10 mmHg.\nEnsure that the marked line of the unrolled mesh overlaps the longitudinal axis of the hernia ring defect (Figure 2C).\nFix the marked points on the longitudinal axis of the mesh to the abdominal wall with non-absorbable nails using a nail gun (see Table of Materials; (Figure 2D).\nFix the edge of the mesh to the abdominal wall along the marked points on the edge of the mesh with non-absorbable nails using a nail gun (Figure 2E).\nFix the mesh on the abdominal wall along the marked points on both sides of the longitudinal axis of the mesh with absorbable nails using a nail gun (Figure 2F).\nFor the control group, flatten the mesh to cover the abdominal wall defect and fix the mesh using the double-loop mesh fixation method9,14.\nFor the double-ring fixing method, do not mark the mesh.\n\t\nFirst, place the fixing nails along the edge of the mesh to ensure that the distance between the nails and the edge of the mesh is about 2-4 mm and that the distance between the nails is about 2-3 cm.\nThen, fix the mesh along the outer edge of the hernia ring defect about 2 cm away from it, with a distance between the nails of 3-5 cm\n\t\t​NOTE: See Figure 3A-D for this method.",
    "5. Follow-up\nPerform postoperative follow-up, including outpatient visits and telephone consultations, for 3 months to 24 months.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the median follow-up time was 12 months. A physical examination and abdominal wall color ultrasound were performed in the first month after the operation, and an abdominal CT was performed at 3 months, 12 months, and 24 months after the operation.The follow-up time was 24 months after the operation.After all the follow-ups, the case data were collected and compared.\nRecord the occurrence of seromas, hernia recurrence, chronic pain, and mesh infection.\n\tSeroma can be diagnosed by an abdominal wall color ultrasound, hernia recurrence and mesh infection by an abdominal CT, and chronic pain by a pain rating scale.In particular, carry out an abdominal CT examination with patients 3 months after surgery, and then compare the results with the preoperative abdominal CT images to evaluate the surgical treatment effects and whether there is a recurrence of the incisional hernia (Figure 4A-F).\n6. Statistical analysis\nCompare the time required for mesh placement, seroma formation, mesh infection, hernia recurrence, chronic pain, the length of hospital stay, and the hospital costs between the two groups.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the measurement data (age, BMI, disease time, mesh placement time, length of hospital stay, and hospitalization costs) were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and the count data (gender, maximum defect of the hernia ring, seroma, mesh infection, hernia recurrence, and chronic pain) were expressed as a count and percentage.\nCompare the measurement data between the groups using a t-test, and compare the count data using a chi-square test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference in this study.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
