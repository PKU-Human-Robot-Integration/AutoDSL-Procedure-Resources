  "procedures": [
    "The apparatus is placed in an isolated room away from any external interferences and noises with a low-intensity white light source.The experimenter must restrict from making any excessive noise during the test and from wearing odorant products with strong smell, since it could act as an anxiogenic stimulus for the mice.The illumination in the lit chamber must be 200-400 lux or more, while the other chamber is dark (5 lux or less).The mice are transferred in their home cages to the behavioral testing room for at least 30 min before the experiment.Clean both compartments of the apparatus with 70% ethanol.Turn on the camera and place the first mouse in the middle of the brightly illuminated chamber.The experimenter stays as far away as possible from the box and out of sight of the test animal.The mouse is allowed to move freely between the two chambers for 5 min (Costall et al., 1989).After each trial, all the urine and fecal boli are removed and both chambers are cleaned with 70% ethanol.The recorded videos can be analyzed by automated computer software or manually with the aid of chronometer. The following parameters are scored (Figure 2):The latency time to enter the dark compartment (Costall et al., 1989).The time spent in the lit/dark compartment.The distance travelled in the lit chamber.The number of transitions."
