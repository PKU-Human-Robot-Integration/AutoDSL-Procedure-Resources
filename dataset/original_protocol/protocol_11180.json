    "NOTE: The details of all reagents and materials are listed in the Table of Materials.\n1. Spheroid formation\nSpheroid culture media\n\t\nPrepare basal medium consisting of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide.\nPrepare DMEM complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen/Strep) in basal medium from step 1.1.1.\nPrepare DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium containing 2.5% basement membrane matrix, 10% FBS, and 1% Pen/Strep in basal medium from step 1.1.1.\nPreparation of plates for spheroid formation\n\t\nWarm basal and DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium at room temperature (RT) for approximately 20 min.\nPretreat the wells of a 24-well plate dedicated to spheroid formation by adding 500µL of anti-adherence rinsing solution to each well.\n\t\tNOTE: In these plates, each well consists of 1,200 microwells.\nCentrifuge the plate at 1,200 × g for 5 min in a swinging bucket rotor with adaptors for plates.\n\t\tNOTE: If only one plate is used, prepare an additional standard plate filled with water to counterbalance the weight.\nRinse each well with 2 mL of warm basal medium, and aspirate the medium from the wells.\nObserve the plate under the microscope to ensure that bubbles have been completely removed from the microwells. If bubbles remain trapped, centrifuge again at 1,200 × g for 5 min to eliminate the bubbles.\nRepeat the rinsing steps 1.2.4-1.2.5.\nAdd 1 mL of warm DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium to each well.\nGeneration of spheroids\n\t\nGrow the Caco2 cells in a 2D monolayer in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 (hereafter referred to as 37 °C/5% CO2).\n\t\tNOTE: The maximum number of cell passages to be used is 80.",
    "When 80% of confluency is reached, wash the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1x (5 mL for a 10 cm dish), add trypsin-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (2 mL for a 10 cm dish), and incubate for 2-5 min at 37 °C/5% CO2.\nCheck cell detachment under the microscope, and neutralize the trypsin by adding 4 mL of DMEM complete medium per 10 cm dish.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer to determine the total number of cells.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 1,200 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium.\nRefer to Table 1 to determine the number of cells required per well to achieve the desired number of cells per microwell. Alternatively, calculate the number of cells using the following formula for a 24-well plate, considering each well contains 1,200 microwells\n\t\tRequired number of cells per well = Desired number of cells per microwell × 1,200\nAdd the required volume of the cell suspension to each well to achieve the desired cell number in a final volume of 1 mL.\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium to each well to reach the final volume of 2 mL per well (see also step 1.2.7).\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to introduce bubbles into the microwells.\nCentrifuge the plate immediately at 1,200 × g for 5 min to capture the cells in the microwells. If necessary, counterbalance the centrifuge with a standard plate filled with water.\nObserve the plate under the microscope to verify that the cells are evenly distributed among the microwells.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 48 h without disturbing the plate.",
    "NOTE: According to the original protocol21, although many cell lines can form spheroids within 24 h, some require a longer incubation time. In this protocol, 48 h are sufficient for spheroid formation.\nHarvesting the spheroids from the microwells\n\t\nWarm the basal and DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium at RT for approximately 20 min.\nUsing a serological pipette, remove half of the culture medium (1 mL) from each well.\nAdd the medium back onto the surface of the well to dislodge the spheroids from the microwells.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not touch or triturate the spheroids.\nPlace a 37 µm reversible strainer (or a 40 µm standard strainer) on the top of a 15 mL conical tube to collect the spheroids.\n\t\tNOTE: If using a 40 µm standard strainer, place it upside down.\nGently aspirate the dislodged spheroids (from step 1.4.3), and pass the spheroid suspension through the strainer.\n\t\tNOTE: The spheroids will remain on the filter; single cells will flow through with the medium.\nUsing a serological pipette, dispense 1 mL of the warm basal medium across the entire surface of the well to dislodge any remaining spheroids and recover them on the strainer.\nRepeat this washing step 1.4.6 twice.\nObserve the plate under the microscope to ensure that all spheroids have been removed from the microwells. Repeat the wash if necessary (steps 1.4.6-1.4.7).\nInvert the strainer, and place it on a new 15 mL conical tube. Collect the spheroids by washing the strainer with DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The collected spheroids are ready for downstream applications and analyses.\nLong-term culture of spheroids\n\t\nPrepare 1.5% agarose solution in basal medium, and sterilize it by autoclaving (standard cycle).\nWhile the agarose solution is warm and still liquid, coat the wells of standard culture plates or dishes, as described in Table 2.",
    "NOTE: Warming the dish/plate in the oven will facilitate the coating step. Coated dishes/plates can be left at RT for up to 10 days in a sterile environment and protected from the light.\nSeed the harvested spheroids (from step 1.4.9) in the agarose-coated plates, and add DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium to achieve the final volume depending on the size of the plate.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid spheroid aggregates, seed them at the optimal density of 22 spheroids/cm2. Observe that the coating is not perfectly flat, and it rises towards the edge, creating a light concavity at the center of the plate. If the number of spheroids is too high, they are more likely to adhere to each other.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C/5% CO2 until recovery of the spheroids for specific analyses.\nTreatment of spheroids with chemotherapeutic drugs\n\t\nPlate spheroids from step 1.5.4, and grow them for 2 days. Starting from day 3 (D3), treat them with FOLFIRI (5-Fluorouracil, 50 µg/mL; Irinotecan, 100 µg/mL; Leucovorin, 25 µg/mL) or with FOLFOX (5-Fluorouracil, 50 µg/mL; Oxaliplatin, 10 µg/mL; Leucovorin, 25 µg/mL) chemotherapeutic regimen combinations routinely used to treat CRC patients22,23,24,25, or maintain them in (control) not-treated (NT) condition.\nCollect the spheroids after 3 days of treatment by using a pipette with the tip cut off (1,000 µL tip), ensuring that each condition is represented by at least three replicates. Centrifuge them at 1,000 × g for 3 min, and then remove the supernatant.\nFix the pellets in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for histological analysis (see section 3), or use the pellets for RNA extraction (see section 4).",
    "To analyze cell death, incubate the spheroids from step 1.6.1 in black culture well plates in DMEM/basement membrane matrix medium for 30 min with a nucleic acid stain (1:5000 dilution) that does not permeate live cells, but penetrates the compromised membranes of dead cells26. Measure the accumulation of fluorescence with a microplate reader.\n2. Monitoring spheroid growth\nUsing an inverted microscope, acquire representative images of spheroids maintained under different conditions throughout the days in culture.\nAnalyze the images by measuring three different representative diameters of each spheroid using appropriate software.\nUse the following formula to obtain the estimated sphere volume.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61783/61783eq1.jpg\n\tNOTE: The terms, d1, d2, and d3, are the three diameters of the spheroid.\n3. Immunofluorescence (IF) and histological staining\nFixation and paraffin embedding\n\t\nCollect the spheroids at selected time-points using a pipette with the tip cut off as described in step 1.6.2, and fix them for 30 min at RT in 2% PFA.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, store the samples at this step at 4 °C until further use.\nFor paraffin embedding, wash the spheroids 3x with PBS 1x, and resuspend them in 70% ethanol. After paraffin inclusion and sectioning, perform hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining for histological analysis.\nImmunolabeling of paraffin sections\n\t​NOTE: Use 5-μm-thick sections for indirect immunostaining.\n\t\nIncubate slides at 60 °C for 2 h to melt the wax and improve deparaffinization.\nWash the slides twice for 3 min in methylcyclohexane.\nWash the slides for 3 min in 1:1 methylcyclohexane:100% ethanol.\nWash the slides twice for 3 min in 100% ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform all manipulations for step 3.2.2 to step 3.2.4 in a chemical hood.\nWash the slides for 3 min in 90% ethanol.\nWash the slides for 3 min in 75% ethanol.\nWash the slides for 3 min in 50% ethanol.",
    "Wash the slides under tap water.\nRehydrate the slides in distilled water for 5 min.\nPrepare 700 mL of 0.01 M citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and add it to a suitable container (width: 11.5 cm, length: 17 cm, height: 7 cm); submerge the slides in it. Heat the container in the microwave for 9-10 min at 700 W, and when the boiling starts, decrease the power to 400-450 W. Incubate for an additional 10 min.\nLet the slides cool down in the buffer to RT for approximately 30-40 min.\nWash the slides twice in PBS for 5 min.\nDraw a circle around the sections with a marker pen to create a barrier for liquids applied to the sections.\nIncubate each section with 50 µL of blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS) for at least 30 min at RT.\nRemove the blocking buffer, and add 50 µL of primary antibodies diluted in the incubation buffer (1% normal goat serum, 0.1% BSA, and 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS). Incubate for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove the primary antibodies, and wash the slides 3x in PBS for 5 min.\nIncubate the slides with 50 µL of fluorescent secondary antibodies diluted in the incubation buffer for 1 h at RT.\nRemove the secondary antibodies, and wash the slides 3x in PBS for 5 min.\nAdd 50 µL of mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to each section, and place a glass coverslip over the section.\n4. RNA extraction, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nCollect spheroids at different time-points, each point represented by at least three replicates. Centrifuge them at 1,000 × g for 3 min, and then remove the supernatant.",
    "NOTE: Pellets can be directly used for RNA extraction or stored at -20 °C until further use.\nIsolate the total RNA using a commercial RNA isolation kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nReverse-transcribe 500 ng of each RNA sample into complementary DNA (cDNA) with a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAfter reverse transcription, perform a PCR analysis on 1 µL of cDNA to amplify a housekeeping gene with primers located in different exons.\n\tNOTE: This step enables the verification of the absence of any genomic DNA contamination in the RNA preparations. For this protocol, peptidylprolyl isomerase B (PPIB) primers were used.\nPerform qPCR amplification on 4 µL of previously diluted cDNA (1:10 in RNAse-free double-distilled water) by using primers specific for the genes of interest. In each sample, quantify specific mRNA expression by using the ΔΔCt method and values normalized against a housekeeping gene levels.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, β-actin (ACTB) was selected. Primers used in this protocol are listed in Table 3.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
