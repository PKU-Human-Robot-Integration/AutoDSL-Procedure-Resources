    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the institutional animal research facility and the “Senatorin für Wissenschaft, Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz” at the University of Bremen (#146)\n1. Preparation of the optical implant9 (Figure 1C)\nPlace a ceramic ferrule flat side up in a bench vise.\nStrip the coat of a 200 µm diameter glass fiber with a fiber stripping tool and cut 2-3 cm long pieces with a ceramic fiber scribe.\nPlace the piece of glass fiber into the ceramic ferrule with an even overhang on both sides.\nPlace a drop of superglue at the flat side of the ceramic ferrule with an injection canula.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nTake the pre-implant out of the bench vise and on the round side of the ceramic ferrule, cut the glass fiber as short as possible with the ceramic fiber scribe.\nPlace the pre-implant at a ferrule polishing puck and polish the round side on 4 different polishing papers, by drawing an eight 20 times per paper (30 µm grit, 6 µm grit, 1 µm grit, and at last 0.02 µm grit).\nTake the pre-implant out of the ferrule polishing puck and cut the glass fiber on the flat side of the ceramic ferrule to the length needed for implantation. Begin measuring the length behind protruding superglue.\n\t\nFor an even cutting surface just scratch the glass fiber 2-3 times and then break it.\n\t\tNOTE: Use the mouse brain atlas from Paxinos and Franklin45 to calculate the length of the implant. The implant must end directly above the region of interest and the thickness of the skull should be included in the length calculation. To stimulate the IL region, the glass fiber has a length of 1.8 mm (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61023/61023fig03.jpg",

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61023/61023fig03large.jpg]\nDisinfect the finished implant for 10 minutes in ethanol and let it air dry before implantation.\n2. Injection and implantation\nTransport a single mouse to the surgical room and weigh it. Apply anesthesia with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Ketamine/Xylazine (Ketamine 0.12 mg/g, Xylazine 0.01 mg/g).\n\t\nFix the mouse with the left hand and turn it on its back with the head held low.\nTarget the left lower quadrant of the abdomen with the syringe and enter the injection canula 1 cm under the skin.\nInject anesthesia in a slow and constant motion into the abdominal cavity.\nPlace the mouse back into its cage and wait until it reaches a deep state of anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: The depth of anesthesia can be determined by the absence of blinking and between-toes reflexes.\nPlace the mouse on a heating plate and fix the head in a stereotactic frame. Fix the nose and teeth in the front, and the ears on both sides.\n\tNOTE: The head must be straight on the left-right and rostral-caudal axis to ensure correct stereotactic coordinates.\nApply analgesia with 2 mg/kg Carprofen subcutaneously into the back of the mouse and apply opaque eye ointment on both eyes to protect them from drying.\nMoisten the hair on the scalp with a wet paper towel and then cut it off using scissors. Make sure to remove all the loose hair with the wet paper towel. To disinfect the scalp, use a cotton stick and take up 0.5 mL of a tincture containing iodine (Betaisodona 100 mg/mL Povidon iodine and 11 mg/mL iodine) and let it air dry.",
    "NOTE: Instead of scissors, also an electric clipper can be used for proper hair removal.\nRaise the scalp above the region of interest with a tweezer and cut 1 cm along the midline. Use two tweezers to push the skin aside to expose the skull. Make sure to also remove the thin skin above the skull and let the exposed skull dry.\nRoughen the skull for later implantation.\n\t\nApply a 2 mm x 2 mm drop of phosphoric acid (37%) from the adhesive kit (e.g., Optibond) on the skull, distribute it with the tip of the syringe and let it take effect for 15 s.\nRemove all acid with a cotton stick and rinse the skull with 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl twice.\nDry the skull with a cotton stick and compressed air.\n\t\tCaution: Phosphoric acid is dangerous and must be removed completely to avoid tissue damage.\nCalculate the F-Factor for individual coordinates.\n\t\nPlace a glass canula in the stereotactic frame and locate it directly above bregma.\nZero the coordinate system and move the glass canula to lambda.\nCalculate the F-factor46 with the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61023/61023equ01.jpg\nMultiply the F-Factor with the coordinates from the mouse brain atlas to adjust them to the individual mouse.\nDrill a hole in the skull for injection.\n\t\nUse the adjusted coordinates to find the location on the skull directly above the structure of interest and mark it using the tip of an injection canula by scratching it above the bone surface.\nUse the injection canula to drill a hole into the skull at the marked location by rotating the canula on the spot. If blood leaks out of the burr hole, rinse with 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl and dry the skull afterwards.\nTake up the virus solution into the glass canula.",
    "Place a drop of 100 µL of 0.9% NaCl onto the skull and a piece of parafilm (1 cm x 1 cm) on top, sterile side up.\nPlace 1-2 µL of virus solution onto the parafilm and lower the tip of the glass canula into it.\nConnect the glass canula to a syringe, apply minimal negative pressure and wait until the virus solution is taken up by the cannula (within seconds).\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to stop the application of negative pressure, before air is picked up into the canula. Therefore, there will always be a small remnant of the virus solution.\nInject the virus solution into the region of interest.\n\t\nPlace the virus filled glass canula above the burr hole.\nSlowly lower the canula into the burr hole and zero the z-coordinate when the tip of the canula is at the level of the skull.\nLower the canula carefully to the lowest position of the injection site.\nFocus the binocular at the meniscus of virus solution within the canula.\nApply a small amount of positive pressure with the syringe until the meniscus is lowered marginally.\nLet the virus spread for 2-3 min before moving the glass canula upwards to the next position.\nApply the virus solution every 200-300 µm throughout the region of interest.\nRemove the glass canula very slowly and discard it after the final injection.\nPrepare the skull for implantation with the adhesion kit (e.g., OptibondTMFL).\n\t\nDry the skull with compressed air.\nApply 5 µL of primer (e.g., Optibond, 1-30% (Ethanol, Silicic acid, Glycerinphosphatdimethacrylat, 2-(2-(Methacryloyloxy)ethoxycarbonyl)benzoesäure, 2-Hydroxyethylmethacrylat)) with the corresponding stick and let it dry for 15 s.\nApply 5 µL of bond (e.g., Optibond, 15-20% 2-Hydroxyethylmethacrylat + 1-2% Alkalihexafluorosilikat(Na)) with the same stick and cure it for 20 s with UV light (420-480 nm).",
    "NOTE: It is essential that the skull is dry and that the primer and bond are applied in a very thin layer.\n\t\tCaution: Do not directly look into the UV light, as UV light may harm eyes.\nPosition the implant directly above the region of interest.\n\t\nFix the implant in the corresponding holder.\nDry the skull with compressed air.\nPosition the tip of the glass fiber directly above the burr hole and lower it carefully.\nStop lowering the implant when the remaining bulb of superglue touches the skull. Do not exert pressure on the skull!\n\t\tNOTE: If the Injection and implantation are being done in different regions (e.g., dorsal raphe and hippocampus), drill all the necessary holes after applying phosphoric acid, but before the 2-component adhesion, then follow the instructions as previously described (step 2.8-2.14).\nFix the implant.\n\t\nCheck if the skull is still completely dry.\nApply fluid dental cement (e.g., Gradia direct flo) around the implant and in the surrounding area and cure for 20 s with UV light (420-480 nm).\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of dental cement depends on the free skull area. The whole skull should be covered by dental cement.\nApply two more layers of cement and completely fill the free and dried skull area. Cure every layer with UV light (420-480 nm).\nFinish the surgery.\n\t\nApply 0.5 g iodine ointment (Betaisodona 100 mg/mL povidone iodine and 11 mg/mL iodine) at the whole wound.\nInject 0.1 mL of glucose dissolved in 0.9% NaCl subcutaneously into the neck for quick recovery.\nRelease the nose and ear fixation, bring the mouse into a fresh cage and place it under a heating lamp to avoid the loss of body heat.\nWhen the mouse wakes up, bring it back into the facility.",
    "Check its health status at least once a day. Take appropriate action if mice display any bad constitutions (e.g., ensure post-operative analgesia with Carprofen up to 3 days if mice display any signs of pain).\n\t\tNOTE: After two weeks of recovery, mice can be used for behavioral experiments.\n3. Setting up a new experiment (Example ChR2 stimulation and Open Field)\nPulser\n\t\nProgram the pulser (e.g., Prizmatix) for light stimulation.\nOpen the software and select the USB COM port that the light source is plugged into.\nChoose Select Operation Mode (3) | Execute pulse sequence after trigger HIGH, then stop when LOW to allow an external software to control the light source.\nProgram the light protocol. For a 20 Hz stimulation with 5 ms light pulse: choose TI = 23 ms, P1D = 5 ms, P1I = 22 ms and P2D = 0 ms.\nPress Start Sequence. This status will remain until experiments are finished.\n\t\tNOTE: The pulser software (Prizmatix Pulser) must be launched before the video tracking software; otherwise video tracking software will not be able to recognize the device.\nVideo tracking software (e.g., Ethovision XT)\n\t\nCreate a new experiment from a pre-defined template.\n\t\t\nOpen the software, go to File, choose New from Template. Select Apply a pre-defined template.\nChoose Live tracking and select the camera by pressing on Source and confirm the connected Basler GenICam.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The live image of the camera will now be displayed in the window on the upper right.\nPress Next and choose the animal which should be recorded (Rodents, Mouse).\nPress Next and select the arena template Open Field, square. Select the zone template Center, Border, Corners and confirm with Next.\nConfirm 1 subject that should be tracked with Next.",
    "Select Center-point, nose-point and tail-base and confirm the animal color compared to the background as darker with Next.\nConfirm the recommended sample rate of 12.5 with Next and finish the step.\nName the experiment appropriate and choose a location to save.\nDefine the experimental settings.\n\t\t\nGo to Setup and Experimental Settings. Choose Center-point, nose-point and tail-base detection as Tracked features.\nSelect Use of Trial Control Hardware and go to Settings.\nSelect Noldus USB-IO box and confirm with Ok.\nChoose Custom Hardware as Device Type at the TTL Port, which has been connected to the pulser device, and confirm with Ok.\nDefine the arena settings.\n\t\t\nGo to Arena Settings and select Arena Settings 1.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The camera will now automatically open a background image.\nConfirm the image with Grab.\nAdapt the pre-defined zones to the real arena by changing their size. Use the arrow and the two symbols on its right. If some zones are unnecessary, delete them.\nPress 1. Draw Scale to Calibrate and pull a line from one corner of the maze to the other. Enter the length of the real distance in cm.\nRepeat that for the other axis.\nTest if the light stimulation is working.\n\t\t\nGo to Arena - Hardware Mapping and select Test on the grey bar.\nSelect Command Output 1 High and press Test.\n\t\t\tNOTE: There should be light emitting from the end of the optical fiber. When selecting Output 1 Low and Test, the stimulation should stop.\nDefine the trial control settings for 20 minutes of experiment. Set trials Off1, On1, Off2 and On2 to each be 5 minutes long.\n\t\t\nGo to Trial Control Setting and select Track duration 30 minutes.",
    "Prepare the main rule by adjusting the Condition: Time to 20 minutes by Selecting Settings and change 30 to 20 minutes. Confirm with Ok.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The condition for start track should be when subject is in arena for 2 seconds. That way the system will automatically start tracking when the mouse is in the arena.\nCreate a sub-rule for the light stimulation: Go to Structures, more and select Sub-rule.\nGive it a name such as light stimulation protocol.\nPlace it below the main rule and spread out the two boxes by selecting the blue area with the mouse courser.\nGo to Conditions, Time and give it a name like light on 1.\nAdjust Condition is met with after 5 minutes. Confirm with Ok.\nPlace the box directly behind the Rule Begin box of the sub-rule by pulling it to the black line.\nGo to Action | Custom Hardware and name it: light ON 1.\nSelect Action to perform as Output 1 High and confirm with Ok.\nPlace the box directly behind the Condition box.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Now after 5 minutes of the experiment the light stimulation should start.\nRepeat the steps to define the time condition After 5 minutes and the action Output 1 Low to stop the light stimulation after another 5 minutes.\nRepeat the steps again to program another light Off and light On trial.\nGo to Structures | Sub-rule reference and check that the reference belongs to the correct sub-rule.\nChoose Start conditions as Without delay and Stop conditions as Execute once per start condition. Confirm with Ok.\nPlace the reference box between action box 1 and condition box 2 of the main rule and draw a line from Action - start track to the Reference.",
    "NOTE: Now the main rule directly starts the sub-rule after starting the track.\nDefine the detection settings to show the system what it should track.\n\t\t\nGo to Detection settings and select Detection settings 1.\nPlace a test mouse into the arena and select Automated Setup.\nChoose Rodent as animal type and use the mouse curser to draw a box around the mouse in the arena. Confirm the Results OK? question with Yes.\nDefine the trial list for all experimental animals that should be tracked.\n\t\t\nGo to Trial List and plan all animals to record today: Select add trials and select a number.\nSelect all the conditions defined before for every mouse.\nName the Animal-ID and the Treatment correctly to later simplify the analysis.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The Animal-ID is irrelevant for the system and only important for later data analyzation by the experimenter. The grouping in Treatment and Control group is important for the system to know how to group and how to compare all the tracks in later analyzing steps.\nGo to Acquisition and start with the experiment.\n4. Open Field experiment (anxiety)\nBring the experimental mouse to the behavioral room right before the experiment to ensure a proper level of anxiety.\n\tNOTE: The behavioral experiments should be performed during the dark phase when mice are awake, and always in the same time slot to ensure comparability.\nCouple the mouse via a sleeve to the light source by pressing it gently onto the grid of the cage.\nPlace it into a waiting cage with fresh litter for 10 min to get acclimatized to the light cable.\nStart acquisition by pressing the Start button in the video tracking software (e.g., Ethovision XT).",
    "Transfer the mouse from the waiting cage into the left upper corner of the open field. Remove the arm within 2 seconds to avoid tracking an arm instead of the mouse.\nLeave the visual field of the mouse during the experiment and keep calm.\nAfter 20 minutes, when the experiment is finished, remove the mouse from the maze, disconnect the light cable and put it back into its home cage.\nBring the mouse back into the facility.\n5. Barnes Maze (learning)\nBring all experimental mice into the behavioral room around 1 hour before the experiment.\nPrepare the Barnes Maze by closing all holes except one, under which an escape box is placed. Place a wall of carton in the middle of the platform, which is the starting area for the mouse.\nConnect one mouse to the light source (sleeve on a light cable) at both implants.\nPlace the mouse directly into the middle of the Barnes Maze into the wall of carton, which prevents the mouse from running around before the experiment starts.\nPress Start in the video tracking software (e.g., Ethovision XT) and remove the carton.\n\tNOTE: The software tracks the mouse until the correct hole is reached but be prepared to stop the trial manually just in case the software does not recognize the hole transition.\nTake the mouse out of the maze and remove the connection to the light cable.\n\tNOTE: If this is a training day with several trials per mouse, leave the mouse in the waiting room next to the behavioral room until the next training session starts. If this was the testing day with only one testing trial per mouse, bring the mouse back to the facility.\n6. Data analysis (Example Open Field data with 4 distinguishable trials)\nVideo tracking software (e.g., Ethovision XT)",
    "Define the experimental groups and trials in the data profile.\n\t\t\nGo to Data Profiles on the left and choose Treated vs. Control.\nGo to Nesting in the new window on the middle-left and select Trial control state.\nChoose the state interval from the Element Action: start Track to the Element Action: light goes ON 1.\nPlace the Nesting box between the Filter box Treatment and the corresponding result box.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This defined interval is Off1, which describes the first 2.5 minutes of the experiment where no light stimulation is present.\nRepeat the steps for intervals On1 (from element Action: light goes on 1 to the element Action: light goes out 1), Off2 (from the element Action: light goes out 1 to the element light goes on 2) and On2 (from the element Action: light goes on 2 to the element Action: stop track).\nRepeat the 4 intervals for the control filter group.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Every nesting box needs its own result box with the names Off1, On1, Off2, On2. Now both the treatment and control group are divided into 4 different light stimulation trials which are analyzed separately.\nDefine the parameters to analyze in the analysis profile.\n\t\t\nGo to Analysis Profiles on the left and select In zones.\nSelect the Dependent Variable In Zone and select Center as zone.\nDouble click on In center and choose any of selected points and select only in center.\nBefore leaving the window go to Trial Statistics and select Frequency, Cumulative duration and Latency to first.\nAdd the Dependent Variable Distance moved.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In Group Statistics, choose whether to use the standard error or standard deviation as error. With this profile, the data for Time spent in the center, Center entries and Total distance moved is available.\nExtract data",
    "Go to Results and select Statistics and Charts.\nPress Calculate to see the analyzed data.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The trial statistics gives information about every single mouse and group statistics analyzes the mean and error for both groups, divided into 4 trials with the corresponding bar plot.\nPress Export data and select the trial statistics and the location to save.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The exported data is saved as an Excel file and with individual values for every mouse.
