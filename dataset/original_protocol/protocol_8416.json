  "procedures": [
    "All animals were handled with utmost care minimizing pain or discomfort during the procedure. This procedure follows the animal care guidelines of our institution and has been approved by the local committee (Regierungspraesidium Darmstadt, approval number FK/1044).\nA schematic of the work steps for in vivo permeability assay in mice is shown in Figure 1. The details of each step are described below.\n1. Animal Handling\nPreparation and administration of tracers and anesthetics\nPrepare labeled tubes and molds for tissue embedding at least a day before the permeability assay. Maintain sterile conditions throughout the protocol by working under clean fume hood and using tools cleaned with 80 % ethanol. Use male or female wild-type (WT) or angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) gain-of-function (GOF) CD1 mice in the mature adult age group of 3-6 months for the current protocol. Perform genotyping of the mice as described previously 10. \n\t\tNote: 80% alcohol will not result in sterile instruments but will minimize contamination of the samples prepared.\nDilute all the tracers in sterile PBS into 2 mM stocks and store the aliquots protected from light at -20 °C.\nChoose tracers such as (Tetramethyl Rhodamine) TMR and (fluorescein isothiocyanate) FITC with distinct excitation/emission spectra and that are lysine fixable resulting in minimal interference between the dyes both by fluorescence microscopy (using the TMR or FITC filter respectively) and by fluorometry in a plate reader for the permeability assay.\n\t\tNOTE: TMR dextran 3 kD and FITC dextran 3 kD used in the study are both lysine fixable and hence could be also used for immunohistochemical analysis post-fixation with aldehydes in order to investigate regional differences.",
    "Handle all animals with utmost care following the institutional care guidelines. Inject intraperitoneally each mouse with 100 µL tracer solution that can be increased up to 200 µL when an additional tracer is combined using 100 µL of each tracer in a 1:1 mix10,13. Inject at least one animal with PBS alone instead of the tracers to serve as sham control for autofluorescence background subtraction.\n5 min after tracer injection, anesthetize the animal with an i.p injection of Ketamine and Xylazine (100 mg and 5-10 mg in 0.9 % Saline per kg body weight respectively, 150 µL of the cocktail per 25 g mouse).\n\t\tNOTE: Vet ointment was not applied on eyes during the procedure as the period between animal anesthesia and perfusion/sacrifice was brief (10 minutes) where any drying of the eyes was not observed.\nBlood collection and cardiac perfusion\nPrepare the animals for cardiac perfusion 10 min after anesthetic administration. Check the absence of paw twitch response in order to ensure that the animal reached a surgical plane of anesthesia.\nLay the animals on their back and apply 80 % ethanol on the skin of abdominal area. Using small scissors, open up the abdominal wall with a small incision (2 cm) just beneath the rib cage. Separate liver from the diaphragm and then slowly cut through the diaphragm exposing the pleural cavity 15.\nCut the rib cage bilaterally and fix the cut sternum in order to expose the left ventricle. Insert a 21-gauge butterfly needle connected to a peristaltic perfusion system in the posterior of the left ventricle.\nPuncture the right atrium and quickly (within 10 s) collect 200-300 µL of blood released into the chest cavity using 1 mL pipette tips (with end cut-off) in serum collection tubes and store it on ice.",
    "Note: This perfusion procedure is non-survival.\nAs soon as the blood is collected, switch on the perfusion system (10-12 rpm, 5 mL/min) and perfuse the animal for 3 min with warm (RT) 1x PBS (free of Ca2+/Mg2+ ions).\n\t\tNOTE: PBS containing Ca2+/Mg2+ ions can be utilized for better heart activity during the perfusion. The total amount of PBS used for perfusion is in the range of 15-20 mL.\nAssess perfusion quality by noting the color of liver, kidneys, which appear white/pale after perfusion.\n\t\tNOTE: Kidney or liver perfusion do not necessarily indicate brain perfusion as the arteries (carotid/vertebral) reaching the brain from aorta might get ruptured during the preparation in step 3 particularly during the atrial puncture.\n2. Tissue Processing\nOrgan collection and storage\nAt the end of the perfusion, confirm death of the animal by cervical dislocation and harvest brain and kidneys. Verify brain perfusion by the color of the brains (no visible blood in vessels of the meninges), so as to exclude the animals from permeability analysis when perfusion quality is not good. Separate the brain into 2 hemibrains using a scalpel (Figure 1).\nDissect with a scalpel one hemibrain free of olfactory lobes and cerebellum and transfer the hemicerebrum to a 2-mL tube. Store hemi-cerebellum in an additional tube if required for cerebellar permeability assessment.\nTransfer a single kidney to another 2-mL tube. Store the samples immediately on dry ice.\nEmbed natively the remaining kidney and hemi-brain (comprising the cerebellum and olfactory lobes) in tissue-tek optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T) compound on dry ice.\nIn the end, centrifuge the blood samples stored on ice in serum collection tubes at 10, 000 g, 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer serum supernatants to 1.5 mL tubes and place them in the dry ice container.",
    "Transfer all the samples collected on dry-ice to -80 °C freezer until further processing.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to freeze the samples before proceeding to the homogenization steps as homogenization efficiency increases after as freeze thawing.\nHomogenization and centrifugation\nThaw on ice the hemi-cerebrum and kidney samples frozen down at -80 °C and weigh the tubes containing the organs. From these weights, subtract the mean value of several empty tubes (about 20) to get the tissue weight. Add 300 µL and 200 µL of cold 1X PBS to the tubes containing kidney and hemi-cerebrum, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: For lower amounts of tissue (like hemi-cerebellum, below 100 mg) weighing the individual tubes is recommended.\nHomogenize each sample in the original eppendorf tube with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) pestle attached to an electric overhead stirrer (1, 000 rpm) by performing about 15 strokes (1 stroke = 1 up and 1 down). Rinse the pestle with PBS in between samples and wipe dry before proceeding to the next sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of detergents during homogenization was avoided due to potential interference with fluorometry. However, intracellular tracer is also detected in this protocol as the tissue is thoroughly homogenized, which is more efficient after one round of freeze thawing.\nStore the homogenized samples on ice protected from light and centrifuge all together in the end at 15,000 g, 20 min, 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge. Transfer supernatants to a new 1.5 mL tubes on ice for immediate fluorometry or at -80 °C to be analyzed later.\nFluorescence measurement and quantification\nIf frozen at the end of the previous step, thaw on ice the tissue supernatant and serum samples stored at -80 ˚C protecting them from light with the foil.",
    "Pipette 50 µL of diluted serum (30 µL 1x PBS + 20 µL serum) or tissue supernatants (as is) into a 384-well black plate. Include at least one sample from sham animal for serum and tissue supernatants to ensure proper background subtraction, as this tissue homogenate background is normally higher than that of PBS used as the diluent.\n\t\tNOTE: An average of 3 sham animals can be used for autofluorescence although a very little variability in sham autofluorescence values (data not shown) was observed. The amount of serum used can be reduced by diluting it with PBS, which can also increase the signal to noise ratio for samples with low fluorescence such as the brain samples. Upto 10 µL serum was tested diluting it with 40 µL PBS. Make sure that no bubbles are present in the wells.\nInsert the 384-well black plate into the plate reader and open a new script selecting fluorescence measurement.\nSet the gain to optimal and use excitation/emission (nm) values of 550/580 or 490/520 for TMR or FITC dyee respectively and start the measurement to obtain the raw fluorescence units (RFUs).\nUse the raw fluorescence units (RFUs) from the plate reader to calculate the permeability index (PI) after subtracting the corresponding sham values.\n\t\t\n*Permeability Index (mL/g) =(Tissue RFUs/g tissue weight)/(Serum RFUs/mL serum)\nExample calculation for brain permeability index (PI) of the animal GOF1 (Table 1):\n\t\t\nGOF1 brain RFUs - SHAM brain RFUs = 154 - 22.5 = 131.5\nGOF1 serum RFUs - SHAM serum RFUs = 38305 - 27 = 38278\nBrain weight (g) = 0.195\nSerum volume (ml) = 0.02\nBrain Permeability Index (10-3 mL/g) = (131.5/0.195)/(38278/0.02) = 0.352",
    "NOTE: The permeability index calculations yield values that are absolute and comparable between experiments and tissue types. These however can be presented as ratios for ease of comparison between 2 groups 12. This can be achieved by dividing the PI of each animal in both groups with the mean PI of control group, driving the control group mean through 1 yet keeping the inter animal variation in the control group. This transformation provides values for experimental group (or groups) relative to control group set to 1.\nImmunofluorescence visualization of tracer\nCut the kidney/hemi-brain blocks embedded natively in tissue-tek compound (O.C.T) (step 2.1) into 10 µm sections on a cryostat set to -20 °C and transfer the sections to slides placed at room temperature. Once the sections are dried (about 30 min), transfer slides to -80 °C freezer until use.\nOn the day of staining, thaw the slides at 37 °C for 10 min, and then fix the sections with 4% paraformaladehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room temperature followed by quick washing in PBS.\nIncubate the sections in permeabilization/blocking buffer made of sterile PBS containing 1 % BSA and 0.5 % Triton X-100 pH 7.5 for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate slides for 1.5 h at room temperature with CD31 primary antibody (0.5 mg/ml, clone MEC 13.3), diluted in 1:100 in buffer containing sterile PBS, 0.5 % BSA, 0.25 % Triton X-100 (pH 7.2) followed by three 5 min washes in PBS.",
    "Perform secondary antibody incubation in the above buffer for 1 h at room temperature with species-specific fluorescently labeled antibodies diluted 1:500 (2 mg/mL). For CD31, goat anti-rat Alexa 568 or Alexa 488 can be used at a dilution of 1:500. Include DAPI (300 µM) in the secondary antibody mix (1:1,000 dilution from the stock) to stain for the nuclei.\nMount the stained sections with aqua polymount and leave it overnight for polymerization at room temperature in dark.\nAcquire images using a spectral imaging confocal laser scanning microscope system. Analyze images by NIS elements software (version 4.3). Software such as Photoshop can be used for generation of montage figures.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
