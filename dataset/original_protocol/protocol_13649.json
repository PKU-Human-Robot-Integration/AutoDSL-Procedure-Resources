    "The operations were performed following the Statement on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision research from the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. The experimental design was approved by the institutional animal Ethics Committee (Medical Ethics Committee of JSIEC, EC 20171213(4)-P01). Two-month-old C57BL/6J mice and Vldlr knockout mice were used in this study. There were 7 mice in each group, all of which were female and weighed 20 g to 24 g.\n1. Experimental conditions\nAssign the mice to two groups: an experimental group consisting of Vldlr knockout mice and a control group consisting of C57BL/6J mice.\nFeed the mice with food and water conventionally.\nRaise the mice in the animal laboratory under stable conditions of room temperature (22 °C), humidity (50-60%), light-dark cycle (12 h-12 h), and room light intensity (350-400 lux).\nPrepare the experimental equipment: optical coherence tomography with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) for small animals (Figure 1A).\nPrepare all materials required for the experiment (Figure 1B) and weigh the mice (Figure 1C).\n2. Information records\nRecord the information: group, code, date of birth, age, sex, weight, and anesthetic dosage.\n3. Instrument startup and testing\nSwitch on the computer and start up the software.\nClick the Test program button to complete the test program.\nTurn on the thermostat and preheat it to the temperature of 37 °C.\nStart the OCT module procedure after the program testing.\nCreate a new subject and fill in the mouse information.\nPreheat the electric blanket and cover it with surgical towels.\n4. Anesthesia\nUse lyophilized anesthetic powder containing Tiletamine and Zolazepam to prepare the anesthetic mixture.",
    "NOTE: Follow local animal ethics committee recommendations for the choice, dosage, and route of anesthesia administration. Anesthetize the animal with an anesthetic that will provide immobility and loss of pain perception for at least 1 hour, after which the animal recovers quickly. Dosage should be based on the length of experiment time, animal weight, and other factors.\nAnesthetize the animal using the prepared anesthetic mixture. Ensure to keep the animal warm during the entire procedure until recovery.\n5. Application of mydriatic drops\nAchieve manual restraint of the mouse by the scruff, make the eyeball protrude slightly, and rotate the mouse head with one eye facing upward.\nApply the mydriatic drops to dilate the pupils (Figure 2A).\nCheck for pupil dilation after 10 min.\n6. Placement of the mouse\nPlace a mouse on an electric blanket platform.\nCoat both eyes with medical sodium hyaluronate gel (Figure 2B).\nScrew a 60 D double spherical lens (preset lens) on the cSLO device (Figure 1A-5, 6).\nPlace a 100 D contact lens on the mouse cornea with the concave side touching the sodium hyaluronate gel on the corneal surface (Figure 2C, D and Figure 3A-II).\nPlace the mouse on the small, constant-temperature animal platform and keep the eye 1-2 mm away from the lens of the cSLO device (Figure 3A).\nAdjust the angle of the contact lens with forceps to keep the pupil in the center of the lens.\nFine-tune the adjustments to the head to make the eye face straight ahead.\n7. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (cSLO)\nClick the OCT button, choose the mouse module, and start the cSLO program (Figure 4B).\nSelect the IR mode (light source: red light), and adjust the parameter (range: 2047, Figure 4D).\nSelect the eye to be examined (right eye: Figure 4C-1; left eye: Figure 4C-2).",
    "Control the lever and move the preset lens towards the contact lens slowly.\nAdjust the diopter value until the posterior pole imaging is clear (Figure 4E).\nMake further adjustments to align the image of the retinal posterior pole, centering it at the optic nerve head.\n8. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)\nStart the OCT program (Figure 4G).\nClick the progress bar up and down until the OCT image appears (Figure 4H).\nAdjust parameters: Range Min (Figure 4I) = 0-20, Range Max (Figure 4J) = 40-60.\nAdjust the preset lens distance and position direction until an ideal OCT image is obtained.\nSelect the scanning position by moving the standard line in the cSLO (Figure 4M).\nStart scanning from the optic nerve head.\nCollect images in the same order for each eye: horizontal line: optic nerve head → superior → inferior; vertical line: optic nerve head → nasal → temporal.\nCollect images from four directions.\nClick Average to overlay the cSLO and OCT image signals (Figure 4F and Figure 4O).\nClick the shot button to acquire the SLO-OCT image (Figure 4P).\nSave and export all the images (Figure 4Q, R).\n9. The end of the experiment (after the OCT examination)\nPlace the mouse on the electric blanket to keep it warm until it wakes up.\n\tNOTE: The mouse should be monitored until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Postoperative exposure to bright light should be minimized.\nRemove the 100 D contact lens.\nApply the levofloxacin eye gel to protect the cornea.\nPlace the mouse back in the cage after it wakes up.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the examined mouse is not returned to the company of other mice until fully recovered.\nTurn off the software and switch off the computer.\nClean the 100 D contact lens with water; dry the lens.",
    "Clean and disinfect the environment.\n10. Image analysis\nCompare the OCT images of Vldlr knockout mice with those of C57BL/6J mice.\nObserve multiple positions: vertical and horizontal scans passing through the optic papilla; superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal scans; and abnormal reflection site scans.\nObserve the thickness, shape, layering, and abnormal reflectance lesions of the retina in each image, as well as the vitreous interface of the retina and the vitreous body.\nRecord the locations, characteristics, and numbers of lesions.\n11. Retinal stratification correction\nClick Load Examination on the OCT interface (Figure 5A).\nCall out the OCT images of a mouse from a pop-up window.\nSelect images: OCT image scanning through the optic papilla, horizontally or vertically.\nDouble-click the image in the Media Container to display it on the screen (Figure 5C).\nClick on Layer Detection to complete automatic layering on the retina (Figure 5D).\nSelect the dividing lines on both sides of the layer prepared for analysis (Figure 6D-10).\nSelect a separate dividing line (Figure 6B-6) and click Edit Layer (Figure 6A-1) to activate the line when a red circle appears (Figure 6B-7).\nAdjust Spacing (Figure 6A-4, e.g., 50) and Limit Range (Figure 6A-5, e.g., 50).\nModify the dividing line by moving the red circle (compare the green dividing line in Figure 6B and Figure 6C; Figure 6C shows the modified result).\n12. Retinal lamination thickness\nClick the Measure Marker button (Figure 6D-9).\nSelect the dividing line of the layer to be analyzed (e.g., in the outer nuclear layer, select the 4th and 5th dividing line in the list) to display the boundary of the layer on the OCT image (Figure 6D-10).\nSelect Connect with Layer (Figure 6D-11) and Stay Connected on Move (Figure 6D-12).\nSelect the area to display the results (the selected column is colored, Figure 6D-13).",
    "Click the position to be analyzed on the OCT image to make the measurement line appear (perpendicular to the horizontal axis and consistent with the color of the resulting area) (Figure 6D-14).\nClick on the next column for the next measurement and reveal the previous data (Figure 6E-15).\nRead the Vert value (thickness of the measured position) in the Length in µm (tissue) row (Figure 6E, red rectangle).\nClick Delete Marker (Figure 6E-16) and New Marker (Figure 6E-17) to retest so that the results will cover the original data (if remeasurement is necessary).\nPress Print Scr on the keyboard to save screenshots, or click Save Examination to save directly (Figure 5H).\nInput the data into a spreadsheet or statistical software for statistical analysis.\n13. Measurement of full retinal thickness\nSelect line 1 (ILM, inner limiting membrane, Figure 7B) and line 7 (OS-RPE, OS: outer photoreceptor segments; RPE: retinal pigment epithelial layer, Figure 7C) in the list in the upper right corner.\n\tNOTE: The full retinal thickness means the thickness of the retinal neurepithelium layer, which is the retina between ILM and OS-RPE on OCT).\nMeasure the retinal thickness on both sides of the optic papilla at a specific interval.\n\t\nFor example: from the appearance of the retinal structure at the edge of the optic papilla, measure 4 values with 200 µm spacing of the horizontal ruler (Figure 7G, H).\nRecord all measured values in a spreadsheet.\nUse multiple t-tests (one per row) to compare the measured values of each corresponding position in both groups.\nSubscription Required.
