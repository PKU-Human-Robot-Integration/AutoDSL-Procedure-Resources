    "The studies described in this manuscript were approved by the local animal Ethics Committee (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma) and were conducted in accordance with the Italian Ministry of Health.\n1. Preparation of the cannula for insertion into the proximal branch of the SMA\nCut the larger cannula of 0.93 mm O.D, 0.5 mm I.D. to the required length (about 30 cm).\nCut the smaller cannula (0.4 mm O.D, 0.25 mm I.D.) to about 5 cm in length and insert it 1 cm into the larger cannula.\nFix the two cannulas together by cyanoacrylate glue, avoiding occlusion of the lumen.\nConnect the free extremity of larger cannula to a Luer stub adapter (23 G) mounted on a 1 mL syringe filled with saline solution.\nSharpen the free tip of the smaller cannula with scissors to facilitate insertion of the catheter in the branch of the SMA.\nCheck the patency of the cannula by flushing with saline solution.\n\t​NOTE: The sharp end of the cannula will not damage the artery during the animal's movement because it will be fixed and will not slide along the vessel.\n2. Preparation of the rat for the surgical procedure\nPerform intramuscular anaesthesia with ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg).\n\tNOTE: Sufficient anaesthetic depth is judged by the absence or near-absence of the paw-pinch reflex.\nShave the fur from the surgical regions: the abdomen for the branch of the SMA cannulation, and the back of the neck for the cannula exit.\nClean the surgical regions aseptically using a surgical the paw pinch reflex.\n\tNOTE: All preparation should be performed with aseptic technique.\nscrub or solution applied in a circular motion, followed by sterile saline or 70% ethanol, 3 times.\nPlace the animal in a supine position, immobilizing the four limbs.",
    "3. Cannulation of a proximal branch of the SMA\nEnsure proper anesthetic depth by testing the paw pinch reflex prior to incision.\nApply a sterile surgical, water-resistant drape.\nWith a scalpel blade, open the abdominal wall with a straight 3 cm incision on the midline of the mesogastric region through all the abdominal planes into the peritoneum.\nPlace gauzes, soaked with saline solution, around the laparotomy incision on top of the surgical drape. Use sutures to keep the surgical incision open.\n\tNOTE: All swabs and surgical instruments must be sterile.\nUse cotton swabs to identify and expose the small intestine. Follow its natural disposition to identify the mesentery. Extract the mesentery out of the laparotomic cut and lay it downward on the gauzes (Figure 1A).\nIdentify the SMA by feeling the pulsation.\nUse the cotton swabs to \"make way\" between the mesenteric fat and uncover the SMA and 2-3 of its proximal branches.\nChoose a proximal branch of the SMA sufficiently large to allow the surgical maneuvers of cannulation. Tie this branch (with a 4-0 silk suture) 3-4 cm downstream from its origin to allow its expansion keeping the suture ends long enough to be manipulated later.\nPlace a rigid support under the branch of the SMA. The handle of the surgical forceps is sufficient here.\nHold the extremity of the smaller cannula (linked with the bigger cannula at the opposite extremity) with the dominant hand using forceps and pull the suture ends with the other hand to strain the vessel and to facilitate the entry of the catheter (Figure 1B).\nHold the tip of the cannula at a 20° angle from the plane of the vessel in the direction opposite to the blood flow.\nLightly press the tip to penetrate the artery wall and insert the cannula.",
    "NOTE: Cannulation is performed without cutting the artery; the tip of the catheter will break the vessel wall and facilitate the entry. Blood flowing back into the cannula confirms the correct insertion.\nContinue the insertion of the cannula for another 1 cm in the arterial branch close to the origin from the SMA.\nFix the cannula to the artery with a surgical knot (4-0 silk) and verify its correct functioning by flushing 1 mL of sterile saline solution or with a blood sampling.\n4. Tunneling of the cannula and placement in the infusion support system\nPlace a sterile surgical drape on the incision prior to changing the animal's position.\n\tNOTE: Tunnel from back to abdomen is created by exerting pressure in the subcutaneous space with a pointed surgical instrument. A sterile surgical drape on the abdomen and back incisions should be used.\nMake a 1 cm incision of the posterior region of the neck and accommodate a spherical valve.\nPass the cannula from the laparotomy access to the valve placed in the neck through subcutaneous tissues (Figure 2A). Close the cannula distal extremity with a catheter plug to avoid air inflow.\nReplace the small bowel in the abdominal cavity. Close the abdominal wall and close the skin incisions with a continuous 3-0 silk suture.\nSecure the valve to the neck skin with stitches. Close the skin incisions with a continuous 3-0 silk suture.\n5. Post-operative management\nDress the rat with a jacket to protect the button valve. Protect the exposed part of the cannula with a steel rod during infusion and secure it to the valve (Figure 2B).",
    "NOTE: Since surgery is performed under aseptic technique, antibiotics are not indicated. NSAID should be administered pre-operatively for pain control (5 mg/mL Meloxicam injectable, 1 mg/kg once daily for up to 3 days). After operation, stabilize the rat in a metabolic cage for the time of infusion (24h). Then re-anesthetize the rat with isoflurane inhalation for the time necessary to disassemble the infusion system. Subsequently it is possible to house the rat in a normal cage with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and free access to food and water.\nStabilize the rat in a metabolic cage for the time of infusion. The rat is now awake and free to move and eat in the cage.\nConnect the distal extremity of the cannula to an elastomeric pump (100 mL volume max, 5.0 mL/h flow rate) filled with 50 mL of sterile saline solution. Proceed with infusion for 24 hours (Figure 2C).\nOn the first day, administer intramuscular antibiotics (enrofloxacin 10 mg/kg for the first 24 h) and then pass to oral administration (enrofloxacin 100 mg in 500 mL in drinking water). Dispense analgesic therapy intramuscularly during awakening (ketoprofen 5.0 mg/kg) and in the following days orally (paracetamol 200 mg in drinking water).\n\tNOTE: Dilute oral therapy administered in drinking water to obtain a bearable taste. Monitor body weight measurement and hydration.\nAt the end of the infusion time (24 hours) disassemble the animal's external infusion system by removing the pump, the jacket, the steel rod, and the valve from the rat. Close and cut the cannula as it comes out of the neck, leaving this extremity under the skin of the neck after wound suture.\n\tNOTE: In this phase it may be necessary to anesthetize rats for few minutes by isofluorane inhalation.",
    "House the rat, individually, in a normal cage with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and free access to food and water.\n\tNOTE: Baseline post-op food intake is about 30 g./day Baseline water intake is about 50 ml/day. Average weight should be about 400 mg."
