    "To present the direct co-culture and direct exposure methods, we use magnesium oxide nanoparticles (nMgO) as a model material to demonstrate bacterial interactions. To present the direct culture and focused-contact exposure methods, we use an Mg alloy with nanostructured surfaces as examples.\n1. Sterilization of nanomaterials\nNOTE: All the nanomaterials must be sterilized or disinfected prior to microbial culture. The methods that can be used include heat, pressure, radiation, and disinfectants, but the tolerance of the materials for each method must be identified prior to the in vitro experiments.\nNanoparticles\n\tNOTE: Samples can be stored in an organic solvent such as ethanol or packaged into a dish or box followed by sterilization or disinfection in an appropriate manner. The nanoparticles were sterilized using the following method for demonstration of the direct co-culture method17 and direct exposure method.\n\t\nSterilize MgO nanoparticles in a 200 °C convection oven30 for 60 min prior to each in vitro experiment.\n\t\t​NOTE: This method was chosen because water steam and UV light may affect the structures of the MgO nanoparticles (nMgO)17.\nBulk materials\n\tNOTE: The nanostructured materials were sterilized by the following method for demonstration of the direct culture method.\n\t\nFor the direct culture method14, disinfect as-prepared ZC21, Mg, and T64 samples using ultraviolet (UV) radiation for 4 h before initiating the in vitro studies.\nFor the focused-contact exposure method16, disinfect all the samples using UV radiation for 2 h before initiation of the in vitro studies.\nAlternatively, use ethylene oxide (EtO) for the sterilization of heat-sensitive materials.\n2. Direct co-culture method (method A)\nNOTE: In method A, bacteria in a lag-phase seeding culture are directly mixed with nanoparticles of certain concentrations. For the examination of nanoparticle antimicrobial activities, we follow a protocol described by Nguyen et al.17.\nCharacterization of nanoparticles and nanostructures",
    "NOTE: Nanostructure composition and shape are confirmed using X-ray powder diffraction.\n\t\nMeasurement of nanoparticles\n\t\t\nWeigh the nanoparticles at 9x the desired mass per mL to accommodate 3 mL samples in triplicate. For example, weigh 0.2 mg/mL nMgO at 1.8 mg/mL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This ensures the consistent distribution of nanoparticles in the bacterial cultures and broths.\nMeasure all the nanoparticles in a 5.0 mL microcentrifuge tube that has been pre-weighed and tared using an analytical balance.\nPreparing and growing bacteria cultures\n\t\nFor each in vitro experiment, retrieve bacteria cell stocks from storage at -80 °C. Add 10 µL of each bacteria cell stock into 5 mL of an appropriate growth medium.\nPlace the inoculated medium into an incubator-shaker at 37 °C and 250 rpm for approximately 16 h overnight.\n\t\t\nIf Staphylococcus species are grown, subculture by placing 400 µL of each overnight culture into 20 mL of fresh growth medium (100 µL/5 mL medium) and incubate with shaking at 37 °C and 250 rpm for an additional 4-6 h.\nWashing and counting the bacteria cells to determine the seeding density\n\tNOTE: The desired seeding density of 7.8 × 106 CFU/mL was identified as the cell number greater than what is required to confirm a urinary tract infection.\n\t\nCollect cultured bacteria by aliquoting 1 mL of the overnight bacteria culture into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Create sufficient numbers of aliquots from overnight bacterial cultures and centrifuge them for 10 min at 1,956 × g to reach the desired seeding densities.",
    "After centrifugation, pipet to remove the supernatant from the pelleted cells and place the supernatant into a collection receptacle. Resuspend the cell pellets in 0.5 mL of fresh growth medium. Combine two 0.5 mL suspensions to create 1 mL of suspension to reduce the number of 1 mL aliquots of resuspended cells to six. Repeat the centrifugation for 10 min at 1,956 × g.\nComplete a second wash cycle using fresh growth medium, as in step 2.3.2, to reduce the number of 1 mL aliquots of resuspended washed cells to three.\nComplete the third cycle, as in step 2.3.2, except resuspend the cell pellets in 0.33 mL of Tris buffer (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane buffer (Tris buffer, pH 8.5). Combine the three suspensions, each of 0.33 mL volume, into one 1.5 mL microcentrifuge. Repeat the centrifugation for 10 min at 1,956 × g.\n\t\tNOTE: Tris buffer does not contain Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions31. This is important for the use of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) to measure Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions in post-culture broths. In contrast, the phosphates present in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)32, for example, sequester both Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions33,34,35 and cause confusion in the interpretation of the ICP-OES data.\nRemove the supernatant from the pelleted cells. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of fresh Tris buffer, known as the cell suspension-a lag-phase bacterial seeding culture.\nDetermine the cell suspension concentration (cells/mL) using a hemocytometer.\nCreation of the seeding bacteria culture\n\tNOTE: The sample has a total volume of 3 mL and is completed in triplicate (9 mL total).",
    "Determine the total volume of bacteria seeding culture needed. To create the seeding culture, use C1V1 = C2V2 to calculate the volume of the cell suspension needed to create a seeding culture of 7.8 × 106 cells/mL. Add the calculated volume of the cell suspension (V1) to the required volume of growth media (V2).\nDetermine the actual bacteria seeding density in CFU/mL. Create a tenfold serial dilution to 10-4. Spread-plate the 10-4 dilution onto the appropriate growth agar and incubate overnight. After incubation, count the number of colonies, and calculate the CFU/mL.\nFormation of bacteria and nanoparticle cultures\n\t\nIn 12-well, non-tissue treated polystyrene plates, aliquot 2 mL of the bacterial seeding culture in each well for the number of wells needed.\nFor each 5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing pre-weighed nMgO, add 3 mL of the bacterial seeding culture. Vortex briefly to mix the nMgO with the bacteria. Aliquot 1 mL of the mixture into three separate wells to create the triplicate samples of each pre-measured weight of nMgO. Pipet the bacteria/nMgO mixture 2-3x before each 1 mL aliquot is made to maintain nMgO in suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: Control samples will consist of 3 mL of cells only, 3 mL of media only, and 3 mL containing the lowest and highest concentrations of nanoparticles used. These are prepared as in step 2.5.2. All the control samples are completed in triplicate.\nIncubate all the 12-well plates at 37 °C and 120 rpm for 24 h.\nDetermining the bacterial cell growth after exposure to nMgO\n\t\nAfter overnight incubation of the bacterial cultures, collect every 3 mL sample by pipetting into an individual 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Use a 96-well plate to create 1:10 serial dilutions. Determine the number of columns necessary to serially dilute all the samples containing bacteria. Add 180 µL of Tris buffer to each well in row B to row G for the appropriate number of columns.\nBriefly vortex each 15 mL conical tube containing bacterial samples, and add 50 µL to an individual well in row A.\nFor each well in row A, transfer 20 µL into row B (e.g., A1 to B1), and briefly mix by pipetting to obtain a volume of 200 µL. Using a sterile pipet tip, transfer 20 µL from the well in row B to the well in row C. Continue this pattern until the well in row G contains 200 µL, completing a serial dilution from 10−1 in row B to 10−6 in row G.\nPipet 100 µL of each well onto an appropriate growth agar plate and spread across the plate to disperse the cell culture. Place the plates into an incubator-shaker overnight at 37 °C. Incubate the plates at 37 °C for 24 h.\nExamine the plates and count those that have approximately 25-300 colonies. If possible, choose plates of the same dilution value. Use the number of colonies per plate to calculate the CFU/mL.\nEvaluation of the post-incubation pH\n\tNOTE: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for each pH meter model.\n\t\nPre-calibrate a pH meter using standardizing solutions of pH 4, pH 7, and pH 10. Read each bacterial sample by placing the pH probe into the 15 mL conical tube.\nPreparation of samples for ICP-OES\n\tNOTE: ICP-OES is used to determine the concentration of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions. These cations are considered important, as each participates in cellular metabolism.",
    "Centrifuge each 15 mL conical tube prepared in step 2.6.1 for 5 min at 5,724 × g to pellet the cellular and nanoparticle debris.\nUsing a 15 mL conical tube, dilute 30 µL of the supernatant into 2.97 mL of 18.2 Ω filtered water to create a 1:100 dilution.\n\t\tNOTE: The dilution factor can be adjusted based on the projected ion concentrations and the detection limit of the spectrometer instrument.\nRead the samples using ICP-OES.\n3. Direct exposure method (method B)\nNOTE: If the growth rate of the chosen bacteria is unknown, then a standardization of growth curve must be completed prior to implementing this method.\nDetermine the real-time bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities upon exposure to the nanoparticles of interest.\n\t\nPrepare the desired concentrations of nanoparticles using the methods described in step 2.1-2.1.2.2. Prepare two sets of each weight of nanoparticles to be used: one to be added to 3 mL aliquots of bacteria culture in the logarithmic growth phase, and the other to be added to 3 mL aliquots of growth medium without bacteria as control groups.\nDetermine the appropriate bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics for the bacteria species to be tested.\n\t\tNOTE: Knowledge of the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic is required.\nCalculate the total volume of bacterial culture needed for triplicate 3 mL samples for all the nanoparticle, antibiotic, and control samples.\n\tNOTE: An equal volume of sterile growth medium is required. If the use of spectrophotometry is planned, this requires adjustments to be made to the total volume needed for accommodation of the 0.5 mL to 1.0 mL volume needed for cuvettes.\nDay 1: For each in vitro experiment, create overnight stocks following step 2.2.1-2.2.2.",
    "Day 2: Confirm the plate reader settings can accommodate a 96-well plate with an optical density of 600 nm. Measure the samples in 200 µL aliquots using a 96-well plate.\n\t\nDetermine an initial bacterial culture OD600 at 0.01-the density used to begin the initial incubation period prior to the addition of nanoparticles and antibiotics.\nCollect the overnight bacteria culture from the incubator-shaker.\n\t\t\nFor each material (e.g., pre-measured nanoparticles or antibiotics) to be tested, create a separate bacterial culture at an OD600 of 0.01. Use a container large enough to accommodate the volume of cell culture needed (e.g., a sterilized Erlenmeyer flask or 50 mL conical tubes).\nDilute the overnight bacterial samples with growth medium by placing three 200 µL aliquots of the growth medium into three wells and three 200 µL aliquots of the bacterial culture into additional wells (e.g., A1 through A6).\nPlace the 96-well plate into the plate reader and scan it.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The readings are averaged for each scanned well to produce a mean value.\nTo calculate the density of bacteria in suspension, average the mean value for each well containing a triplicate sample.\nTo determine the optical density of the bacteria, subtract the broth sample average from the bacterial average.\nIf it is necessary to continue to adjust the bacterial suspension, continue to add broth or overnight bacterial culture as needed, and repeat scanning in the plate reader as necessary until an OD600 of approximately 0.01 is reached.\nIncubate at 37 °C with shaking at 150 rpm until logarithmic growth is reached.\nRemove the bacterial cultures from the incubator shaker.\n\t\nAliquot 3 mL of the OD600 0.01 bacterial culture into labeled 15 mL conical tubes for test and control samples in triplicate.",
    "Aliquot 200 µL of the bacterial culture into three wells of a 96-well plate and measure the samples using the plate reader.\nCalculate the readings as described previously in step 3.4.2.2 and step 3.4.2.6-the \"-0.5 h reading\".\nCreation and measurement of bacteria/nanoparticle mixtures\n\t\nAliquot 3 mL of sterile growth medium in equal numbers to the bacterial cultures into labeled 15 mL conical tubes for control samples (in triplicate).\nTo prepare bacteria/nanoparticle suspensions and sterile media/nanoparticle suspensions, remove 1 mL of bacterial culture or medium from each triplicate set of 15 mL conical tubes.\n\t\t\nPlace the 1 mL aliquots into a 5 mL centrifuge tube containing pre-measured nanoparticles, and vortex briefly to mix.\nFrom the 5 mL centrifuge tube, return 1 mL aliquots of the bacteria/nanoparticle or medium/nanoparticle suspensions to the 15 mL conical tube to distribute the nanoparticles homogeneously.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Pipet the bacteria/nanoparticle mixture 2x-3x before each 1 mL aliquot is pipetted to maintain the nanoparticles in suspension.\nCreation and measurement of bacteria/antibiotic mixtures\n\t\nTo create the bacterial/antibiotic cultures, aliquot 3 mL of the incubated bacterial culture into the correspondingly labeled 15 mL conical tubes.\nAfter all the samples have been prepared, aliquot 200 µL of each sample into the individual wells of a 96-well plate.\nPlace the plate(s) into the plate reader, and initiate scanning-the \"0 h\" reading.\nPlace the 15 mL conical tubes containing the samples into an incubator-shaker at 37 °C and 150 rpm. Record all the data as described previously in step 3.4.2.2 and step 3.4.2.6.\nApproximately 15 min after completing the 0 h reading, repeat the steps described in step 3.7.2-3.7.3-the \"0.5 h\" reading.\n\t\nAfter the established 0 h, repeat the steps described in step 3.7.2-step 3.7.3 every 90 min for six cycles; complete in 9 h.",
    "After the sixth cycle has been completed, place the samples in the incubator-shaker for an additional 15 h at 37 °C and 150 rpm. Repeat the steps described in step 3.7.2-3.7.3 to obtain the 24 h reading. Record all the data as described previously in step 3.4.2.2 and step 3.4.2.6.\n4. Direct culture method (method C)\nNOTE: In method C, bacteria in a lag-phase seeding culture are placed directly on the nanostructured surfaces of interest. For examination of the nanostructure antimicrobial activities, we follow a protocol described by Zhang et al.14. To demonstrate this direct culture method, ZC21 (Mg-Zn-Ca Alloy) and Mg pins were used as samples.\nPreparing and growing the bacteria cultures\n\t\nFor each in vitro experiment, create overnight stocks following step 2.2.1-2.2.2.\nWashing and counting the bacteria to determine the seeding density\n\tNOTE: The desired seeding density of 7.5 × 105 CFU/mL was identified as the reported cell concentration that causes orthopedic infections14.\n\t\nRetrieve the overnight bacterial culture from the incubator-shaker.\nWash and collect the bacteria, following step 2.3.2-2.3.2.3, but replace the fresh medium with revised simulated body fluid (rSBF) for each washing step.\n\t\tNOTE: rSBF is a buffer solution that mimics the ionic concentration of human blood plasma. However, rSBF contains only inorganic compounds, and is without any bioorganic compounds such as proteins. In order to resolve this, fetal bovine serum (FBS) is combined with rSBF to simulate the composition of human blood to better mimic the natural formation of apatite in calcified tissues under experimental conditions36.\nRemove the supernatant from the pelleted cells. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of rSBF supplemented with 10% FBS-the cell suspension.",
    "Determine the cell suspension concentration (cells/mL) using a hemocytometer. Dilute the cell suspension to a concentration of 7.5 × 105 cells/mL in rSBF supplemented with 10% FBS. Create a seeding culture following step 2.4.1.\nDetermine the actual seeding density following step 2.4.2.\nDistribute bacterial cell suspension onto the samples in the culture wells.\n\t\nPlace both the samples and control samples into the individual wells of a 48-well, non-tissue treated polystyrene plate.\nAliquot 0.75 mL of the cell suspension into each well containing the samples and controls.

Add 2 mL of rSBF to each tube.\nPlace the samples collected in step 4.4.2 into a sonication bath, and sonicate for 10 min. After each 5 min period, vortex each sample for 5 s.\nCollect the rSBF containing the newly detached bacterial cells and place the suspension into a labeled, fresh microcentrifuge tube.\nSerial dilutions and plating the bacteria\n\t\nSerially dilute and plate the bacterial suspension following step 2.6.2-2.6.6.\nEvaluate the post-incubation pH of culture media by following step 2.7.\nPrepare the post-culture medium for ICP-OES by following the methods described in step 2.8.\n5. Focused-contact exposure method (method D)\nNOTE: In method D, bacteria on a nitrocellulose filter paper are put in direct contact with an area of interest on the nanostructured surfaces. This method minimizes the interference of bulk sample degradation in bacterial cultures with the bacterial activities. To examine nanosurface antimicrobial activities, we follow a protocol described by Lin et al.16.",
    "Follow the procedures in step 2.2.1-2.2.2.1 to create a bacterial seeding culture. Confirm the actual seeding density following step 2.4.2.\nPrepare the samples to a size of 1 × 1 cm2 in a square shape. Prepare all the sample types in triplicate. If necessary, place the samples on a three-dimensional (3D) holder that is 15 mm in diameter by 10 mm in height. Place the sample and holder into a well of a non-tissue culture-treated polystyrene well plate.\nPrepare sterilized nitrocellulose papers by trimming each to a diameter of 1 cm. Place the prepared nitrocellulose papers onto an agar plate containing the appropriate medium.\nPipet 50 µL of the diluted bacterial culture onto the filter paper.\nPipet 50 µL of an appropriate medium onto the center of each sample surface.\nUsing sterilized tweezers, pick up the nitrocellulose paper from the surface of the agar. Carefully flip the nitrocellulose paper and place it onto the sample surface so that the bacteria are in contact with the 50 µL of medium and the nanostructured surface of interest.\nAdd 1 mL of Tris buffer to each well containing a sample to maintain the humidity. Incubate the polystyrene well plate containing all the samples at 37 °C for 24 h.\nCollect the nitrocellulose paper from each sample surface. Place each into 5 mL of Tris buffer. Vortex the collected filter papers and nanosurfaced material samples for 5 s.\nSonicate each sample for 10 min. Vortex for 5 s after 5 min and again after 10 min.\nCollect the Tris buffer suspensions from all the samples and place each volume into individual fresh collection tubes.\nSerially dilute and plate the samples following step 2.6.2-2.6.6.\n6. Post-culture characterization of bacteria and nanomaterials\nExamination of bacterial adhesion and morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)",
    "After overnight incubation, add 10% glutaraldehyde into each well of the 48-well, non-tissue treated polystyrene plate until the samples are fully covered. Incubate the samples for 1 h to fix the bacterial cells.\nAspirate the glutaraldehyde into a waste bottle and rinse all the samples 3x with Tris buffer solution to remove non-adherent bacteria.\nDehydrate the samples using 30%, 75%, and 100% ethanol for 30 min each16.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use a critical point dryer to dry the samples. It is not ideal to air-dry the samples at room temperature for 24 h.\nUse conductive adhesive tapes, such as copper or carbon tapes, to fix the samples onto an SEM stub. Coat the sample surfaces via sputter coating to provide conductivity prior to the imaging (e.g., coat Mg plates with adhered bacteria under platinum/palladium (Pt/Pd) for 45 s at 20 mA16).\n\t\tNOTE: The coating materials, processing time, and operation current may vary depending on the sample types.\nTake images of the bacteria on the samples using SEM with an appropriate working distance and accelerating voltage and at the desired magnifications. For example, use an SEM with a secondary electron detector to take images at a working distance of 5 mm and an accelerating voltage of 10 kV16.\nExamine surface morphology of post-culture nanomaterial samples using SEM.\n\t\nFor nanomaterials, wash the samples using Tris buffer 3x to remove the free bacteria that are not attached to the sample. For nanoparticles, disperse the particles into a solvent that does not affect the sample properties through ultrasonication to achieve better dispersion when needed.\nDry the samples after the washing procedure.\nUse carbon or copper double-sided adhesive tapes to adhere the samples onto the SEM stub.",
    "Create a conductive surface layer of Pt/Pd using a sputter coater, as described in step 6.1.4, prior to the imaging. Take the sample images as described in step 6.1.5.\nAnalyze the surface elemental composition using EDS with an appropriate accelerating voltage and at the desired magnifications (e.g., at 10 kV after performing the SEM analysis16).\nFluorescence imaging of bacterial adhesion\n\t\nPrepare the samples to be visualized using fluorescence microscopy by first washing them with Tris buffer 3x. Air-dry the samples at room temperature.\nStain each sample with 10 µM thioflavin T fluorescence dye following the established protocol37.\nPerform fluorescence imaging of bacterial adhesion using an inverted microscope coupled with an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device digital camera.\nSubscription Required.
