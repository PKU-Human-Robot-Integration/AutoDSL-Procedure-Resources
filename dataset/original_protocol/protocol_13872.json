    "The presented protocol is used for mares presented in the equine hospital and follows institutional animal care guidelines.\nNOTE: Perform endometrial cysts photoablation before anestrus: heats observed in late July or August thus seem most reliable. Do not perform this procedure too late in the breeding season as it can limit the number of estruses available to treat a potential endometritis.\n1. During the preceding estrus\nPerform a complete breeding soundness examination of the mare, including an endometrial biopsy1 (not described here) to ensure that the mare can potentially get pregnant after the procedure.\nIn case of poor endometrial biopsy staging according to Kenney’s classification1, give the embryo transfer or intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) program preference over endometrial cysts photoabalation.\n2. During the preceding diestrus\nOnce the rectum is empty, count, measure and map endometrial cysts of the mare in the uterus using trans-rectal ultrasonography guided by rectal palpation with a 7.5 or 5 MHz linear rectal probe and calipers on the screen (Figure 3) in a contention stock.\nAdminister 250 µg of cloprostenol intra-muscularly to induce estrus within 2 or 3 days after day 6‒7 post-ovulation.\nOn a daily basis, perform common routine ultrasonography and cervix palpation to observe estrus signs, including significant endometrial edema, antral follicle of 35 mm and softened and opened cervix.\n3. Preparation when the mare is in heat\nRestrict access to the operation room to people wearing eye protection glasses.\nAfter emptying of the rectum, wrap the tail and clean the vulva aseptically using iodine-povidone.\nTo ensure easy manipulation and comfort of the mare, administer detomidine (10 µg/kg) and butorphanol (0.1 mg/kg) intravenously in the jugular vein with a 21 G needle.\nPer vagina, install the embryo collection catheter through the cervix and insufflate the balloon with 40 mL of air.",
    "Infuse the uterus with 1.5 L of sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl) to inflate the uterus.\nDeflate the balloon and remove the catheter.\nPass the endoscope aseptically through the cervix within a sterile sleeve. \n4. Technique\nConnect the 600 µm quartz fiber to a diode laser operating at 980 nm. Set the power at 20‒25 W in continuous mode.\nPass the flexible quartz fiber via the biopsy channel of a 10 mm diameter video-endoscope until 3‒4 cm of free fiber can be identified on the screen. A minimum of 10 mm from the end of the fiber should be visible.\nActivate the laser to puncture the cyst ideally at its apex: a dedicated pedal is available on the device to keep hands free. In some cases, multiple punctures at various locations are necessary to achieve complete voiding of the cyst. The cystic fluid is passively drained out into the uterus.\nAfter the cyst lining has collapsed around the fiber, deploy the laser until the membrane shrinks.  \nPerform transrectal ultrasonography of the uterus as many times as necessary during the procedure to confirm that endometrial cysts have disappeared.\n5. Post-operative treatments\nAdminister general antibiotic treatment: 22,000 UI/kg penicillin-procaine suspension, intra-muscularly, twice a day, for 3 days.\nJust after intervention, perform uterine lavage as described above (see steps 3.4-3.6).\n\t\nCollect the liquid infused in the uterus before the endoscopic procedure through a sterile cuffed catheter.\nFlush the uterus with successive instillations of 1 L sterile isotonic solution (0.9% NaCl) until a clear liquid is collected.\nAt the end of the procedure, administer 20 IU of oxytocin intravenously.\nPerform transrectal ultrasonography of the mare uterus the day after: intraluminal free liquid is frequently observed (see step 2.1).",
    "As long as free intra-luminal fluid is observed by transrectal ultrasonography and until the end of the heat, perform uterine lavages daily with the procedure described above (steps 3.4-3.6). Sometimes, serum-like, limpid and yellow stained liquid is collected for several days.\n\tNOTE: Giving repeated intra-muscular injections of oxytocin (20 IU) every 4 h or less when the mare is in estrus can avoid fluid accumulation and reduce the risk of bacterial contamination in the uterus.\nPerform trans-rectal uterine ultrasonography during the following diestrus to confirm disappearance of endometrial cysts and the absence of intraluminal free fluid.\n\tNOTE: If free intraluminal fluid is observed, prostaglandin injection is recommended to induce a new estrus, to diagnose an eventual subsequent endometritis and to treat it.\nSubscription Required.
