    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1: Subculturing cells for transient transfection\nTiming: 1 h\nTo determine the effects of pathogenic LRRK2 on centrosome cohesion, we transiently transfect adherent A549 cells. All pathogenic LRRK2 mutants (G2019S, R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, I2020T, N1437H) cause centrosomal cohesion deficits in a manner reverted by pharmacological LRRK2 kinase inhibition, but here we describe procedures employing flag-tagged wildtype and Y1699C mutant LRRK2.\nPre-warm A549 cell culture medium and Trypsin-EDTA solution in a 37°C water bath.\nAspirate the culture medium from the cells.\nAdd 1.5 mL of pre-warmed Trypsin-EDTA solution to T25 flask containing cells at 90% confluency and incubate at 37°C for maximally 5 min or until all cells are detached.\nResuspend the cells with 8.5 mL of culture medium and disperse by repeatedly pipetting the cell suspension.\nCount cells with hemacytometer. For A549 cells, a T25 flask at 90% confluency typically amounts to around 2.5 × 106 cells.\nPre-lay 1 mL of A549 cell culture medium into each well of a 6-well plate.\nPlate 1 mL of cell suspension per well of a 6-well plate containing pre-laid medium. For A549 cells, this means plating around 250′000 cells per well of a 6-well plate.\nNote: Perform all steps in a sterile class II biosafety cabinet.\nCritical: Cells as plated here should be around 80% confluent the next day so that you obtain good transfection efficiencies.\nDay 2: Transient transfection\nTiming: 6 h\nHere we describe procedures for transiently transfecting DNA constructs into A549 cells by using the LipoD293 transfection reagent.\nCritical: Purified DNA to be transfected must be of high quality and at a concentration of approximately 1μg/μL. Follow manufacturer's instructions of the commercial kit indicated in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\n(https://www.promega.com/products/nucleic-acid-extraction/plasmid-purification/pureyield-plasmid-midiprep-system/?catNum=A2492[href=https://www.promega.com/products/nucleic-acid-extraction/plasmid-purification/pureyield-plasmid-midiprep-system/?catNum=A2492]).",
    "In an Eppendorf tube, mix 100 μL of DMEM high glucose, no glutamine medium with 1 μg of LRRK2 construct. Vortex.\nIn a separate Eppendorf tube, mix 100 μL of DMEM high glucose, no glutamine medium with 4 μL of LipoD293 transfection reagent. Vortex and incubate at RT for 3 min.\nAdd the LipoD293-containing solution to the DNA-containing solution. Vortex thoroughly and incubate at RT for 15 min.\nCritical: Make sure you thoroughly vortex the LipoD293/DNA mix for optimal transfection efficiency.\nAdd the 200 μL transfection mix to the cells in a well of a 6-well plate (add gently down the side wall of the well, and then gently swirl the plate to mix). Incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 5 h.\nAfter transfection, gently remove medium and add fresh pre-warmed A549 cell culture medium. Incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 overnight (12–16 h).\nNote: Perform all steps in a sterile class II biosafety cabinet.\nNote: Steps 1–12 are omitted for MEF cells endogenously expressing wildtype or pathogenic LRRK2.\nAlternatives: Dependent on cell type, other transfection reagents can be employed as well. With the large plasmid size encoding for full-length tagged LRRK2, we obtain decent transfection efficiencies also when using Turbofect (ThermoFisher, R0533), Jetprime (Polyplus, 101000015), Fugene6 (Promega, E2691) or XtremeGene HP (Sigma, 6366244001) transfection reagents.\nNote: Refer to Problem 1 of the section “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” if low transfection efficiency is observed.\nNote: Refer to Problem 2 of the section “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” if massive cell death occurs after transfection.\nDay 3: Subculturing cells onto coverslips\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes how cells are subcultured onto coverslips.\nPre-warm A549 cell culture medium and trypsin-EDTA solution in a 37°C water bath.\nAspirate the cell culture medium from the cells.",
    "Add 0.5 mL of pre-warmed Trypsin-EDTA solution per well of a 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for maximally 5 min or until all cells are detached.\nMeanwhile, place a dry-heat sterilized 13-mm round glass coverslip (you can place up to three coverslips per well) into each well of a 6-well plate and pre-lay with 1 mL of A549 cell culture medium. If coverslips are floating, gently push them to the bottom of the well with a sterile pipette.\nAdd 4 mL of A549 cell culture medium to trypsinized cells and gently disperse cells by pipetting.\nAdd 1 mL of cell suspension to each well containing the coverslips and the pre-laid cell culture medium.\nNote: For MEF cells endogenously expressing wildtype or pathogenic LRRK2, follow steps above but employing MEF cell culture medium instead.\nNote: A549 cells and MEF cells attach to non-coated coverslips. For some other cell types, you may need to coat coverslips with e.g., poly-L-lysine to assure efficient cell attachment.\nNote: Transfection efficiency is highest and transfection-induced toxicity is lowest when cells are around 80% confluent. Therefore, we do not transfect low-confluency cells already seeded onto coverslips.\nAlternatives: The method presented here is based on the use of 13-mm round coverslips, but coverslips of other sizes can be used for different microscope settings.\nDay 4–5: Treatment and immunostaining\nTiming: 36 h\nDrug treatment\nThe following day, to determine whether centrosomal cohesion deficits due to pathogenic LRRK2 are kinase activity-mediated, cells are treated with DMSO or the LRRK2 kinase inhibitor MLi2 (in DMSO) for 2 h before fixation and immunostaining. Use 100–200 nM MLi2 for cells transiently overexpressing LRRK2 and 10–50 nM for cells endogenously expressing LRRK2.",
    "Critical: Keep final DMSO concentration on cells to ≤ 0.1% (v/v), as higher concentrations of DMSO can interfere with various membrane trafficking steps which may influence centrosome cohesion.\nCritical: Prepare 1 mM stock solution of MLi2 in DMSO. Since MLi2 can precipitate when directly added to A549 cell culture medium, further dilute stock solution in A549 cell culture medium to make appropriate (1000x) working stocks. For example, for a 200 nM final MLi2 concentration, dilute 1 mM stock solution to 200 μM working stock solution in A549 cell culture medium. For the control DMSO condition, also dilute DMSO 1:5 in A549 cell culture medium to generate equivalent 1000x stock.\nTreat cells with either DMSO or MLi2 in A549 cell culture medium (final DMSO concentration ≤ 0.1%) for 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nFixation\nRemove cell culture medium.\nFix the cells with 2 mL PFA fixing solution (4% (v/v) PFA in PBS) for 15 min at 37°C.\nRemove fixing solution.\nWhen staining with anti-γ-tubulin antibody, fix cells additionally with ice-cold absolute MeOH for 5 min in freezer at −20°C.\nNote: Specifically for MEF cells, only fix with ice-cold MeOH for 10 min in freezer at −20°C.\nCritical: Pre-chill absolute MeOH at −20°C for at least 24 h for optimal fixation.\nNote: Refer to Problem 3 of the section “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” if poor staining with anti-γ-tubulin antibody is observed.\nPermeabilization and staining with primary antibody\nPermeabilize the cells for 10 min by incubation with 2 mL of PBST at RT.\nNote: For MEF cells, we use 0.5% Triton-X100 in PBS instead of 0.2% Triton-X100 in PBS throughout.\nTransfer the coverslips to a 24 well plate to minimize all subsequent incubation volumes.\nBlock for 1h at RT with 500 μL of blocking solution.\nAlternatives: You can block overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.",
    "Note: Refer to Problem 4 of the section “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” if high background staining is observed.\nIncubate at 4°C overnight (12–16 h) with 100 μL of blocking solution containing primary antibodies (note that mouse anti-flag, rabbit anti-pericentrin and mouse anti-γ-tubulin antibodies are all diluted at 1:1000 (v/v)).\nNote: Permeabilization and blocking steps are performed on a rocker-shaker.\nNote: For determination of distances between duplicated centrosomes in non-transfected cells, simultaneously stain cells with rabbit anti-pericentrin and mouse anti-γ-tubulin antibodies. For determination of centrosome splitting in transfected A549 cells, simultaneously stain cells with both rabbit anti-pericentrin and mouse anti-flag antibodies.\nNote: The same protocol as outlined here is applicable to HEK293T, SH-SY5Y, primary murine astrocytes, primary human dermal fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cell lines, iPSCs and iPSC-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Optimal fixation and permeabilization conditions for other cell types need to be independently determined.\nStaining with secondary antibody\nTiming: 3 h (for steps 28 to 35)\nThe following morning, coverslips are stained with secondary antibodies and mounted onto slides as follows:\nWash coverslips 3 times with 1 mL of PBST (0.2% Triton-X100/PBS) for 10 min at RT.\nAlternatives: You can wash coverslips with blocking solution instead.\nIncubate for 1 h at RT with 100 μL of blocking solution containing fluorescently-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor488 and goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 594 are diluted at 1:1000 (v/v)).\nWash 3 times with 1 mL of PBST for 10 min at RT.\nNote: Incubation of coverslips with secondary antibodies and subsequent washing steps should be performed in 24-well plates protected from light.\nCarefully pick up the coverslips with forceps.\nDip into small beaker containing deionized water and then into small beaker containing 70% EtOH.\nPlace coverslips onto a Kimwipe with cells facing up and let coverslips air-dry.",
    "Put a drop (around 4 μL) of mounting medium with 1.5 μg/mL DAPI onto a slide.\nCritical: Ensure that no air bubbles are present in the drop of the mounting medium.\nPlace dried coverslip onto drop of mounting medium (cells facing down).\nRemove excess mounting medium from the edges of the coverslip using a Kimwipe.\nHave a member in your lab code the individual coverslips so that you will perform image acquisition and analysis blind to conditions.\nNote: Washing steps are performed on a rocker-shaker.\nPause point: Slides can be stored at 4°C for 1–3 months in the dark.\nImage acquisition and analysis\nTiming: 2 h/coverslip\nHere we describe image acquisition and analysis for MEF cells endogenously expressing wildtype or R1441C-mutant LRRK2, but the same procedures are used for other cell types endogenously expressing or transiently over-expressing LRRK2.\nImage acquisition\nAcquire images on a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope using a 63 × 1.4 NA oil UV objective (HCX PLAPO CS).\nCollect images using single excitation for each wavelength separately and dependent on secondary antibodies.\nA 488 nm Argon laser line and a 510–540 nm emission band pass (for Alexa Fluor 488).\nA 561 nm HeNe laser line and a 596–628 nm emission band pass (for Alexa Fluor 594).\nA 405 nm UV diode and a 420–470 nm emission band pass (for DAPI).\nNote: Use the same laser intensity settings and exposure times for image acquisition of individual experiments.\nAcquire 15–20 image sections with a z-step size of 0.5 μm.\nNote: If imaging centrosome cohesion from cells transiently overexpressing LRRK2, select areas based on the presence of transfected cells, and only image healthy-looking transfected cells.\nNote: If imaging cells endogenously expressing LRRK2, image random areas across the coverslip.",
    "Note: Refer to Problem 5 of the section “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” if you encounter blue dots in the DAPI channel.\nNote: Refer to Problem 6 of the section “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” if you encounter very few cells with duplicated centrosomes.\nImage analysis\nNote: The average distance between duplicated centrosomes is cell type-dependent.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Therefore, for any given cell type, you first need to determine the mean distance between duplicated centrosomes from control wildtype cells so as to define centrosome splitting as described below for that given cell type.\nGenerate maximal intensity projections of all acquired images.\nProcess and analyze images using Leica Applied Systems (LAS AF6000) image acquisition software.\nAlternative: Image analysis can be performed in ImageJ.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nNote: In all cases and based on DAPI staining, exclude mitotic cells from further analysis.\nNon-mitotic cells display either one centrosome (G1 phase) or two centrosomes (late G2 phase). From 100 random non-transfected interphase cells, quantify the percentage of cells displaying two centrosomes.\nNote: The percentage of cells displaying duplicated centrosomes is an indicator of the percentage of cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle, and this number should be similar to the percentage of cells in G2/M phase as independently determined by FACS analysis using propidium iodide.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nMake a zoom of an area of interest. Manually measure the distance (center to center) between duplicated centrosomes from 150–200 independent wildtype cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2353-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Centrosomal cohesion deficits in R1441C-LRRK2 knockin MEF cells\n(A) Representative images of wildtype (wt) or R1441C-LRRK2 knockin MEFs stained with antibodies against two centrosomal markers (pericentrin and γ-tubulin) and with DAPI. Arrows point to duplicated centrosomes as labeled by both centrosomal markers.

    "(C) Distances between duplicated centrosomes from wildtype or R1441C-LRRK2 MEFs. This allows for determination of the mean distance from one given experiment (wildtype: 5.5 μm, 167 cells with duplicated centrosomes; R1441C-LRRK2: 8.2 μm, 189 cells with duplicated centrosomes). Bars represent mean ± SEM (∗∗∗∗p < 0.001).\n(D) Quantification of the mean distances from wildtype or R1441C-LRRK2 MEFs with or without MLi2 treatment from three independent experiments. Bars represent mean ± SEM (∗p < 0.05).\n(E) Centrosomes were defined as split when either > 5 μm (blue) or > 8 μm (red) apart, and the percentage of cells with duplicated centrosomes bigger than the respective cut-off plotted from data shown in (B). A splitting phenotype in the R1441-MEFs as compared to wildtype MEFs is observed in both cases.\n(F) Quantification of split centrosome phenotype from wildtype or R1441C-LRRK2 MEFs with or without MLi2 treatment from three independent experiments. Bars represent mean ± SEM (∗∗p < 0.01; ∗p < 0.05). (Figure modified from.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])\nPlot a frequency histogram of the distances between duplicated centrosomes from control wildtype cells using GraphPad Prism 9 software (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Perform the same analysis with cells endogenously expressing pathogenic LRRK2 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPlot the distances between duplicated centrosomes in wildtype versus R1441C-LRRK2 cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). As evident from the data, you can see a shift toward larger inter-centrosome distances in the frequency histogram of the R1441C-LRRK2 as compared to the wildtype MEFs, which is reflected by an increase in the mean distance between duplicated centrosomes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nRepeat the experiment twice more to obtain the average mean distances between duplicated centrosomes from wildtype versus R1441C-LRRK2 MEFs and in either the absence or presence of MLi2 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).",
    "The definition of “centrosome splitting” is arbitrarily defined as the percentage of cells with a distance between duplicated centrosomes greater than a given value.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] In the example provided, 40% of cells with duplicated centrosomes are considered to display a splitting phenotype when the distance between the duplicated centrosomes is > 5 μm (blue, Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1E). In contrast, 15% of cells are considered to display a splitting phenotype when the distance between the duplicated centrosomes is > 8 μm (red, Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1E). In both cases, the R1441C-LRRK2 MEFs display an increased centrosome splitting phenotype as compared to the wildtype cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nRepeat the experiment twice more to obtain the average splitting phenotype (here defined as > 5 μm) between duplicated centrosomes from wildtype versus R1441C-LRRK2 MEFs in either the absence or presence of MLi2 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: We determine the maximal diameter of the nucleus from around 20 cells as identified by DAPI staining to obtain a mean nuclear diameter value. We exclude the occasional cells where the distances between their duplicated centrosomes are larger than the mean nuclear diameter. This is to assure that we do not quantify centrosome distances from cells in early phases of mitosis (specifically prophase), where DAPI staining does not accurately identify such cells in all cases. In the case of MEF cells, we exclude cells with inter-centrosome distances > 20 μm (1 cell, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). In the case of A549 cells, we exclude cells with inter-centrosome distances > 5 μm.\nCritical: Only analyze cells where the centrosomes are co-stained by both centrosomal marker antibodies (pericentrin and γ-tubulin).\nCritical: Centrosome amplification can be observed in certain immortalized cell types.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Therefore, exclude all cells with more than two centrosomes from further analysis."
