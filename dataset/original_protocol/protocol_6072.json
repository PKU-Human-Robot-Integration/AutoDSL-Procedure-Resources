    "Differentiation from iPSCs to Forebrain NSCs (Neural induction)Note: The following steps are described assuming high-quality iPSCs (see Figure 1) are plated on a 60-mm tissue culture dish that is coated with Matrigel® (for more details, see Recipes and Table 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190301/20190301202035_1665.jpgFigure 1. Sample ICC staining for high-quality iPSC cultures. In order for differentiation to proceed effectively, ensure that you begin differentiation with high-quality iPSC cultures. IPSCs should uniformly express pluripotency markers SSEA, OCT4, TRA-1-60, and NANOG (A) when assessed using ICC. Additional pluripotency markers DNMT3b, EST2, and ZFP42 can also be assessed using a qPCR assay (B). IPSCs should be free of karyotypic abnormalities (C), possess the ability to differentiate into all three germ lineages and express characteristic markers of each lineage (D), and test negative for mycoplasma contamination (E). Scale bars represent 100 μm.Working in a class II biological safety cabinet, use appropriately sized pipettes to plate iPSCs in E8 medium in a 60-mm dish. If starting from a frozen aliquot of iPSC, we recommend plating at least 300,000 cells. This is considered Day 0 of iPSC culture.On Day 1 of iPSC culture (15%-25% confluency), aspirate the spent medium to remove non-attached cells, and check the size of colonies. If colonies are approximately 100-200 µm in diameter, they are an appropriate size to begin differentiation. Add 3 ml of complete Neural Induction Medium 1, pre-warmed in a bead bath to each plate using a 5 ml pipette. Return the plates to an incubator maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and atmospheric (~20%) Oxygen. If plates do not contain colonies of sufficient size, add 3 ml of E8 media and check daily until colonies reach the appropriate size.On Day 2 (about 48 h after switching to Neural Induction Medium), change the medium by aspirating old medium from each well.",
    "Add 3 ml of pre-warmed complete Neural Induction Medium 1 to each plate.On Day 4 of neural induction, cells will be reaching confluency. If necessary, mark any colonies with non-neural differentiation. Remove these unwanted colonies with a 200 µl pipette tip. Aspirate the spent medium from each well. Add 3 ml of pre-warmed complete Neural Induction Medium 1 to each plate.Note: Due to high cell density in the culture from Day 4 onwards, doubling the volume of Neural Induction Medium is very critical for cell nutrition. Also, minimal cell death should be observed from Days 4 to 7 after neural induction. If the color of cells turns yellowish with many floating cells during Days 4 to 7 of neural induction, it indicates that the starting density of iPSCs was too high. In this case, change the Neural Induction Medium every day, remove some colonies and double the volume per well/plate. Ideally, work with these variables to ensure that the media does not continue to turn yellow. On Day 6 of neural induction, cells should be near maximal confluence. Remove any non-neural differentiated cells that can be observed and add 3 ml of complete Neural Induction Medium into each plate.On Day 7 of neural induction, the medium should be switched into Neural Induction Medium 2. Add 3 ml of complete Neural Induction Medium 2 to each plate. The medium should be changed every day for 5 days. For example morphologies, see Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190301/20190301202125_7691.jpgFigure 2. Morphology of iPSCs differentiating into forebrain NPCs. A. Day 0: Showing a single iPSC colony of appropriate size immediately prior to addition of Neural Induction Media 1. B. Day 2: The iPSC colony, which has been treated with Neural Induction Media 1 for 2 days, begins to change cellular morphology and some cells extend processes. C.",
    "Day 5: Increased expansion of the colony with some differentiation of outer cells. D. Day 12: Appearance of rosettes in the colony become visible. NSCs are present in high confluence in the middle of these structures. It is at this point that colonies are detached and re-plated on non-adherent plates at D13 for two days. E. D13 immediately after plating on adherent plates. This image shows floating rosette colonies that will continue to proliferate and differentiate in a floating mass. Non-rosette cells either remained on the dish at D12 after chemical release or float as single cells on the non-adherent plates shown in (E). F. At D15, rosette clusters expand in size and are moved to adherent plates. Cell aggregates here are 3-dimensional, but are attached to the plate. Note the purity of the clusters at this point (F). Scale bars represent 130 µm.Harvest and expansion of NPCsNote: On Day 12 of neural induction, NPCs are ready to be harvested and expanded. Aspirate the spent Neural Induction Medium from each plate to be passaged.Gently add DPBS without CaCl2 and MgCl2 to each plate twice to rinse the cells.Add 1.5 ml of pre-warmed Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent to each plate and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C until most cells detach from the surface of the culture vessels. Tap plates gently to dislodge cells still attached.Use a pipette to gently rinse the surface of the plates with the Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent already in the plates to detach any remaining cells.Using a pipette, transfer the cell suspension to a 15-ml conical tube.Add 1 ml of DPBS to each plate to collect residual cells and transfer the cell suspension to the conical tube.",
    "Gently pipet the cell suspension up and down 3 times with a 5-ml or 10-ml pipette to break up the cell clumps.Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min.Aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the cells in pre-warmed Neural Progenitor Cell (NPC) Medium (i.e., 10 ml for all cells from each plate).Plate the cells suspended in NPC Medium onto a 10 cm Petri dish.Culture the cells in a CO2 incubator for 2 days. During this time, NPCs will form aggregations while floating in NPC medium.Once aggregates have reached an appropriate size of approximately 70-200 µm, prepare a 10 cm tissue culture dish coated with 5 ml of Matrigel® for at least 1 h. If few aggregates have formed, plate cells in a 60 mm dish instead.Using a 5-ml or 10-ml pipette, take up and pass the NPC medium through a cell strainer to collect NPC aggregations. Reverse the strainer and pass 10 ml of fresh pre-warmed NPC medium through strainer where the cell aggregates are bound so that they are transferred onto the Matrigel®-coated 10 cm plate.Culture the cells in a CO2 incubator to allow for NPC aggregates to attach to the coated dish and migrate and proliferate.Change medium every 2-3 days until cells reach confluence and are ready for passaging or cryopreservation. Dissociate using warm accutase at 37 °C for five minutes.To assess the purity of NPC culture, fix cells and check for NPC markers using ICC (see Figure 3).To cryopreserve NPCs, freeze in an 80/20 mix of FBS/DMSO. Store at -80 °C for use within a few months, or in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190301/20190301202304_1838.jpgFigure 3. Sample ICC staining for high-quality NPC cultures. In order for differentiation to proceed effectively, ensure that iPSC cultures uniformly express Nestin, SOX1, and PAX6.",
    "NPC cultures should have no expression of the pluripotent marker OCT4 (DAPI shown in blue in merge of PAX6 and OCT4; all cells express PAX6, i.e., 100% purity of the culture). Scale bars represent 100 μm.Differentiation of forebrain NPCs into neuronsPlate NPCs on a tissue culture dish that is coated with Matrigel®. Wait until cells have achieved 70%-95% confluency before beginning differentiation.Once NPCs have reached desired confluency, aspirate media and replace with an equal volume of Neuronal Media.Every 2-3 days, aspirate half of the media in the plate and replace with fresh Neuronal Media.Note: As some media will be lost to evaporation, you may need to add a little more media than you remove from the plate in order to keep the media volume stable over time. Continue to change the media until neurons reach the desired stage of development. For example morphologies of developing forebrain neurons, consult Figure 4. For example ICC characterization of forebrain neurons, consult Figure 5.Notes: The purity of your line will be very easily detected during this stage of development. Cell lines that contain a high percentage of NPCs will rapidly polarize and form neuronal projections (usually around Days 2-5), whereas lines that contain a high percentage of non NPC cells (Astrocytes, neural crest cells, etc.) will not. There is variability in how long neurons in a particular plate will take to reach a certain stage of development depending on line, clone, passage number etc. However, we have found that neurons in good quality cultures consistently achieve the following landmarks by the following number of days into differentiation. Day 5 = Cells are post-mitoticDay 15 = Cells have clearly polarized axons and dendrites, and have clearly detectable electrophysiological properties, such as action potentialsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190301/20190301202415_0637.jpgFigure 4.

    "Morphology of a forebrain NPC culture differentiating into neurons. Images taken at D0 (A), D5 (B), D15 (C), D30 (D). Scale bars represent 130 µm.To assess the purity of your neuronal culture, fix cells and check for forebrain markers using ICC. To assess the quality of the neurons produced, ensure that the cells display proper electrophysiological properties (see Data analysis). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190301/20190301202805_9891.jpgFigure 5. Sample ICC staining for high-quality forebrain neuronal. Representative ICC of forebrain neuronal culture following 30 days of differentiation (D30) from NPCs, demonstrating the relative abundance of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and astrocytic markers in the population. These cultures are approximately 65% glutamatergic, 30% GABAergic, and 5%-10% astroglial. Scale bars represent 50 μm.Assessment of culture purity using immunocytochemistryNote: The following steps are described assuming cells are plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-ornithine and laminin (For more details, see Recipes). Fix samples in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.Wash samples with PBS (3 x 15 min) at room temperature.Permeabilize samples by incubation in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min. Aspirate permeabilization buffer and replace with 5% BSA diluted in PBS to block samples. Incubate at room temperature for 60 min. Prepare working stocks of primary antibodies by diluting in blocking 5% BSA-PBS. See Table 1 for recommended working dilutions and antibodies for different cells types. Coat coverslips in primary antibody solution and incubate overnight at 2-8 °C.Table 1. Antibodies used in immunocytochemistryimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190301/20190301202653_7339.jpgWash samples with PBS (3 x 15 min) at room temperature.Aspirate PBS and add secondary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA-PBS. See Table 1 for recommended secondary antibodies and dilutions. Incubate coverslips at room temperature, away from light for one hour.Wash samples with PBS (3 x 15 min) at room temperature.",
    "If desired, add DAPI diluted in PBS, incubate for 5 min in room temperature.Add a drop of Vectashield® to a glass slide. Carefully use a needle and forceps to transfer the coverslip, cell-side down, to the slide. Seal using nail polish.Assessment of neuronal quality using ElectrophysiologyPull pipettes from glass capillaries. Their resistance should range from 3 to 6 MΩ when filled with the internal pipette solution.Transfer individual coverslips containing differentiated human iPSC-derived neurons into a heated recording chamber and continuously perfused (1 ml/min) with BrainPhys Neuronal Medium without phenol bubbled with a mixture of CO2 (5%) and O2 (95%) and maintained at 35 °C using an automatic temperature controller.Choose the cells that you will record from.Fill the pipette with the internal pipette solution and place it in the electrode holder. Lower the pipette to place it into the external solution. After compensating offsets, approach the pipette to the chosen cell with the help of the remote micromanipulator to form a high resistance cell-attached seal. Once the seal is formed and the whole cell configuration is established, compensate series resistance at 80%-90%. Wait for 5 to 10 min before starting to record. This allows the cell content to equilibrate with the internal pipette solution.For acquisition, set your filter at 2 kHz and your sampling rate at 20 kHz.Once whole-cell recording had been established, recordings of fundamental neuronal properties, including rheobase, resting membrane potential, action potential parameters and spontaneous postsynaptic currents can be performed. Add NMDA via pipette. Assessed neurons should be hold neurons in voltage clamp at -70 mV except when examining changes in the resting membrane potential and rheobase, which should be performed in current clamp. Clampex and GraphPad Prism 7 are recommended software to use to display data. For example electrophysiological recordings obtained from cortical neurons, consult Figure 6.",
