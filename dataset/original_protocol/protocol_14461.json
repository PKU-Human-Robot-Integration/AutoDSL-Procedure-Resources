  "procedures": [
    "Experimental procedures were approved by the animal care committee of the CEA's Life Sciences Division (CETEA, A14-006). They were conducted in compliance with the French legislation and the European Community Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC).\n1. Silicon nitride (Si3N4) membrane support preparation\nNOTE: Because the membrane is fragile and delicate, its support (200 µm thick silicon frame) has to be handled gently, ideally with a thin carbon tweezers or Dumont Tweezers #5, Straight Self-closing fine tips. This protocol used silicon nitride membranes with a frame of 5 mm x 5 mm and a membrane size of 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm. The membrane should be prepared roughly 12 h before starting the experiment (i.e., cell seeding). Membranes can be prepared at the end of the day and left drying overnight under a Class II laminar flow hood so they are ready to use the next morning. A silicon frame thickness of 200 µm is standard for most companies that sell silicon nitride windows. If the product used in this protocol is not available, a membrane size in the range of 0.5−1.5 mm can be used with a standard frame size of 5 mm x 5 mm. The larger membrane size is preferred when X-ray tomography will be used. TEM grid type silicon nitride windows with a membrane size of 0.5 mm and a thickness of 50 nm can also be used.\nOpen the capsule containing the Si3N4 membrane support (Figure 1). Gently squeeze the capsule in order to lightly loosen the support.\nHold one of the corners of the silicon frame using the thin tweezers. Be careful not to touch the Si3N4 membrane in the center. The 200 or 500 nm thick membrane can be easily damaged.",
    "Using the thin tweezers, gently place the Si3N4 membrane support in a sterile glass Petri dish, flat surface of the silicon nitride window facing up (i.e., the cavity facing the bottom of the dish).\nRemove the lid of the Petri dish and leave the membranes under UV light for 25−30 min under the laminar flow cabinet.\n\tNOTE: The UVC light (254 nm) is typically set at 200 µW/cm2.\nPut 10 µL of poly-L-lysine on the membrane. The drop should cover the Si3N4 membrane well and can spread a bit over the silicon frame. Leave it at 37 °C for 25 min in the standard tissue culture incubator at 100% relative humidity and 95% air, 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: In this case a poly-L-lysine coating was used for the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Depending on the type of cell line, various coatings can be used, and this step should be optimized accordingly.\nIn a sterile 48 well plate, fill different wells with 200−250 µL of ultra-pure and ultra-trace water filtered through a 0.22 µm sterile filter. Typically, each well can be used to rinse up to 2−3 membranes. Using fine tweezers, pick-up the membrane support at a corner of its silicon frame. Rinse the membrane gently by submerging it vertically 10 s in three successive wells.\n\tNOTE: The membrane supports are taken out of the incubator and can be processed at room temperature, with the temperature and the humidity defined by a Class II laminar flow hood.\nPut the membrane support vertically in an empty well of a sterile 96 well plate, cover it, and let it dry overnight under a Class II laminar flow hood.\n2. Cell seeding\nIn a sterile 4 well plate, place the membranes with their flat side facing up.",
    "MDA-MB-231 cells are maintained in a monolayer culture in DMEM with phenol red/Glutamax I, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 air humidified incubator.\nWhen the cells reach 60−70% confluency remove the media from the dish or flask.\nWash 1x with 10 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+.\nAdd 3 mL/T75 flask of 0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution and ensure that the entire monolayer is covered with the trypsin solution.\nIncubate for 3−5 min at 37 °C until the cells begin to detach. Care should be taken to not over-trypsinize the cells and not force the cells to detach prematurely.\nAdd 8 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin or complete media and collect the cells by pipetting. The serum in the media will neutralize the trypsin.\nSpin down at 250 x g for 3 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 8 ml of fresh complete media to the 15 ml tube containing the cell pellet, and pipet the cells up and down until the cells are dispersed into a single cell suspension.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and dilute to a concentration of 5 x 106 cells per mL in complete media (DMEM with Phenol Red/1% of a 200 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide in 0.85% NaCl solution supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin).\nTake 10 µL of the MDA-MB-231 cell suspension and deposit it on the membrane. This corresponds to 50,000 cells/10 µL for MDA-MB-231. The drop should cover the Si3N4 membrane well and can spread a little bit on the silicon frame. Care should be taken to not touch the Si3N4 membrane with the tip of the micropipette.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the type of cell line and experiments or measurements, cell density may vary and should be tested accordingly. Here, the proposed cell density for seeding the Si3N4 membrane was found optimal for the experimental conditions and further SR-XRF nano-analysis of the MDA-MB-231 cells2.\nFor hippocampal neurons (HN), remove the hippocampus brain tissue from embryonic day 18.5 mice and digest it in 0.25% trypsin in Hepes-HBSS (5.3 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 137.9 mM NaCl, 0.34 mM NaH2PO4, 5.56 mM glucose) at 37 °C for 15 min18,19.\nUsing a P1000 pipette with a P1000 tip and a P200 tip, perform the mechanical dissociation by drawing and releasing the cone content with the pipette several times. During this step, be careful not to create air bubbles in the medium, because air bubbles are toxic to neurons.\nWait a few minutes until the aggregate settles at the bottom of the tube.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the dispersed cells to a sterile Eppendorf tube. Leave ~25 µl of culture medium containing the aggregate.\nCount the dissociated cells using a hemocytometer. Isolated HN neurons are plated at a concentration of 7 x 104 cells cm-2 on poly-L-lysine (1 mg/mL poly-L-lysine)-coated silicon nitride membrane.\nOnly for membranes with HN, incubate the neurons in first DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. One h after plating HN in DMEM, the medium is changed to neurobasal plating media (200 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide in 0.85% NaCl solution, and B27 supplement d = 1/50 diluted in Neurobasal)18,19.\nFor the MDA-MB-231 cells, put the membrane supports at 37 °C in the incubator (100% relative humidity, 95% air and 5% CO2) for 25 min. This allows the cells to settle and start to attach to the substrate. This may be adapted depending on the cell line used.",
    "Add 1 mL of the required complete culture medium (DMEM with Phenol Red/1% of a 200 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide in 0.85% NaCl solution supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin) in each well of the MDA-MB-231 cells by putting the pipette tip against the wall of the plastic well and releasing the medium very slowly while it covers the membrane.\nPut the membrane vertical against the wall of the 4 well plate in order to take away any air bubbles trapped in the well cavity of the Si3N4 membrane (Figure 2). To do so, use fine tweezers and push away the bubble very gently, moving parallel to the Si3N4 backside frame to avoid touching and damaging the membrane.\nPut the membrane back horizontally at the bottom of the well and leave the 4 well plate in the incubator for the required time depending on the growth rate of the cell line used. The MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated overnight.\n3. Treatment or medium change\nRemove the medium from the 4 well plate.\nRinse once with 1 mL of PBS solution at 37 °C. Discard the PBS and add 1 mL of warmed complete fresh medium in presence or in absence (controls) of the desired treatment using a 1 mL pipette tip, releasing the liquid very slowly against the wall of the well plate. The Si3N4 membrane should be slowly submerged without any disturbances to avoid membrane motion or lifting.\n4. Cryo-immobilization of the cellular preparation by plunge-freezing",
    "NOTE: At the end of the required incubation time, in the presence or absence of treatment, the cells have to be carefully rinsed and cryofixed. Around 30 min before starting to rinse and blot the cellular preparation prior to plunge-freezing, first set-up and cool down the automatic plunge freezer machine. As you manipulate cryogens, the use of appropriate cryogenic gloves, safety glasses, closed shoes, and a laboratory coat are required. Liquid nitrogen must be transported in appropriate Dewars, and the working place should be sufficiently ventilated with the presence of an oxygen monitor. Ideally, a low hygrometry level of 20−30% helps to limit ice contamination of the materials, Dewars, and cryogens, that is detrimental for the vitrification of the samples (i.e., an amorphous ice layer). Ideally, depending on the experience level of the researcher, up to 10−12 samples for a single session can be prepared using the same secondary cryogen liquid ethane cup for vitrification. Between sessions, the automatic plunge freezer requires a 1 h automatic bake-out procedure. Ideally, samples should be processed with identical incubation conditions. Still, controls can be processed first, followed by the samples with a particular treatment condition.\nNOTE: For plunge-freezing the following steps apply both to MDA-MB-231 or HN cells.\nSet up the cryoplunger for rapid cryofixation of cells.\n\t\nTurn on the automatic plunge freezer.\nEnter the parameters (e.g., temperature, percent humidity, blotting time if automatic blotting is used, and position for lifting the sample to the surface of the cryogen to facilitate transfer to a cryogenic container) directly from the console and parameters settings menu. In the present case, the parameters of the humidity chamber were set to 37 °C and 80% humidity.",
    "NOTE: Better vitrification results were obtained for this protocol and X-ray imaging with quick and careful manual blotting. Thus, the protocol does not use an automatic blotting sequence program.\nAttach the humidifier chamber and in order to preserve the humidity first fill it using a syringe with 60 mL of double-distilled water, and then 20 mL as called for on the automatic plunge freezer console.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid using ultrapure water because it may damage the vaporizer system. Close the valve and leave the tubing attached on the backside of the humidifier.\nInstall the black ethane cup into its holder and cover it with the plastic caps.\nFill the Dewar of the cold chamber with LN2, bringing it to the level of the grid within the working area.\nPut a dedicated cryo-box to store the membranes after cryofixation in the transfer container held in the dedicated location in the EM-GP working area and close to the ethane cup holder.\n\t\tNOTE: The dedicated cryo-box is an in-house development at the nanoprobe beamline ID16A of the European synchrotron radiation in Grenoble. Drawings with specifications are available upon request (Figure 3). They can be stored four at a time in a 50 mL conical tube for long-term storage in an LN2 Dewar. An alternative possibility consists in using a small 0.2 mL regular PCR thin wall tube with dome caps to store a single Si3N4 membrane support. You will need to drill a ~2 mm hole in the top part of the wall tube using a heated syringe needle in order to allow LN2 to fill the tube.",
    "Fill the transfer container with LN2 and cover it with the dedicated aluminum lid. Continue to fill the cold chamber with LN2 (typically ~2 L is needed) keeping at 100% the LN2 level monitor display on the console. Wait until the final required temperature is reached.\nRemove the plastic cap and cover the ethane cup with the liquefier connected to the ethane bottle. Wait until the temperature of the ethane cup equilibrates to the temperature setpoint. When reached, start to use the secondary cryogen (i.e., liquified ethane).\n\t\tNOTE: The setpoint used was -180 °C, slightly above the ethane melting point (-182.8 °C). You do not need to precool the ethane liquefier because it can be a source of frost formation and contamination of the ethane cup.\nOpen the high-purity ethane bottle main valve and very slowly open the pressure regulator until you get a slow fog of ethane. Keep this very low flow until liquid ethane builds up. Fill the cup to its top edge. Close the pressure regulator and the main valve of the ethane bottle. Remove the Leica liquefier carefully and leave it aside on a small polystyrene support under the fume hood. Keep the working area loosely covered with the black polystyrene cap provided with the machine to prevent frost contamination of the working area and ethane container.\nJust before manual blotting of the sample, remove the black polystyrene cap and from the menu of the console press \"Lower Chamber\", which brings the environmental chamber in contact with the cryogenic working area.\nPrepare to blot the sample.\n\t\nPrepare the adequate buffer to remove traces of salts from the culture medium. For this protocol, ammonium acetate buffer was used for rinsing the MDA-MB-231 cells.",
    "NOTE: Ammonium acetate buffer is suitable for most cell types, and it does not add to the X-ray fluorescence signal (considering elements with Z > 9). Some particular cell lines such as neuronal cells may require the use of a dedicated buffer. For example, for primary cortical neurons, a saline solution consisting of 1.8 volume of 0.5 M Na2HPO4 and 1.9 volume of 0.5 M NaH2PO4 can be used15. On the other hand, phosphorus or chlorine contained in the buffer will contribute to the XRF spectrum. This limitation of spurious X-ray emission lines must be kept in mind depending on the elements of interest to be detected.\nPrepare a 150 mM ammonium acetate solution from ammonium acetate ultrapure solution and check for pH (7.0–7.3) and osmolarity (270–300 mOsm/kg)\n\t\tNOTE: The above mentioned osmolarity is equivalent to Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline (D-PBS) without calcium and magnesium and can be checked using a micro-osmometer.\nFill in the required number of wells from a 12 well plastic plate with the ammonium acetate buffer.\nCut a quarter of filter paper for blotting, either from No. 1 filter paper with a precut hole, or from manually punched filter paper of a 55 mm diameter with a 15 mm central hole.\nTake out the required sample stored in the incubator at 37 °C at the last moment before rinsing and plunge-freezing the membrane.\nUnlock the tweezers using the black clamp ring of the quick-release forceps (typically a Dumont clamping ring high-precision medical tweezers) and grab the Si3N4 membrane support from the culture well.\n\t\tNOTE: Grab the middle of the silicon frame, keeping the tip of the tweezers near the membrane. Move the black clamp ring down to the first stripes to lock the tweezers.",
    "Immerse the Si3N4 membrane support vertically in the ammonium acetate buffer solution kept at 37 °C for ~5 s.\n\t\tNOTE: The support should remain vertical in the buffer. Note that the buffer solution in each well of the plate can be used for up to three membranes for the same incubation conditions.\nBlot manually with filter paper to drain out the excess buffer from the membrane rinsing solution (Figure 4) in order to leave a thin and homogeneous layer of ammonium acetate aqueous solution covering the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: To do so, first press the backside of the window onto the filter paper to remove nearly all the aqueous buffer remaining in the well and the back of the membrane. Second, blot the front side, starting from both sides of the tweezers, then each side of the frame (Figure 4). Never touch the membrane. The excess of buffer drained can be monitored with the aureole formed on the filter paper.\nOpen the environmental chamber door and quickly mount the tweezers, sliding it into the forceps interlock, and close the door (Figure 5).\nPress \"Blot/A plunge\". The tweezers holding the Si3N4 membrane will be quickly plunged into the cryogen.\nRemove the lid of the transfer container with precooled forceps.\nPress \"Transfer\". The Si3N4 membrane will be slightly moved up above the cryogen.\nIn a single quick movement, disconnect the tweezers by sliding them out of the forceps interlock and slightly tilt out of the interlock to bring directly into an empty slot of the cryo-box in the transfer container filled with LN2. Release the black clamp ring to free the membrane (Figure 5).",
    "NOTE: The transfer container should always be covered with LN2. When a refill is required, cover the ethane cup with the plastic lid provided with the machine to avoid mixing LN2 and ethane.\nCover the transfer container with a lid and use a small white polystyrene cup filled with LN2 to transfer it to a polystyrene box filled with LN2.\n\t\tNOTE: The cryo-box or tube containing the membranes can then be stored in 50 mL conical tubes filled with LN2 and transferred to a long-term storage LN2 Dewar. Before starting to plunge freeze the next sample, warm up all cold and frosted tweezers with a hair dryer or a hot plate/cryotools dryer (45 °C) to avoid contamination with ice crystals.\n5. Freeze-drying of plunge-frozen cells cultured on silicon nitride membranes\nNOTE: For freeze-drying, the following steps apply to both MDA-MB-231 and HN cells. To cool down the freeze dryer, you will need to wait around 40 min to 1 h.\nSet up the freeze dryer\n\t\nSwitch the power on with the rocker switch located on the rear panel of the instrument.\nStart to enter the parameters following the LCD menu: Segment 1 = 2 h at -120 °C; Segment 2 = 2 h ramp from -120 °C to -80 °C; Segment 3 = 2 h at -80 °C; Segment 4 = 2 h ramp from -80 °C to 50 °C; Segment 5 = 2 h at -50 °C; Segment 6 = 6 h ramp from -50 °C to 30 °C.\nAt the end of the parameter set-up, save the settings, close the chamber lid and press \"START\".\nThe unit will pump down to 1.10-5 mbar. When this pressure is reached, the command line of the display will show \"Start Cooling Now, START to continue\".",
    "Fill the liquid nitrogen Dewar regularly to cool down the stage below the temperature triple point setting.\n\t\tNOTE: The stage triple point temperature is set to -140 °C. Before loading the sample for this protocol, it is best to wait about 1 h and a temperature stage of -160 °C.\nThe display will show \"Press ENTER\" when ready to \"Load sample\".\nCool down to liquid nitrogen temperature within an LN2 filled polystyrene Dewar, the sample transfer holder provided by the supplier, and the two additional brass cylindrical Si3N4 membrane holders.\nMount the Si3N4 membrane brass holder on top of the sample transfer holder provided by the supplier in the polystyrene Dewar (Figure 6A). Keep the level of LN2 to about 1−2 mm below the top edge of the first brass piece.\nPick up a Si3N4 membrane sample support from the cryo-box or the PCR tube using precooled self-closing tweezers in inox or teflon-coated.\nDeposit the membrane with the cells sample side facing up in the brass holder numbered cavity.\nCover the assembly with the second brass piece as a lid (Figure 6C).\n\t\tNOTE: We designed two brass discs each having a thickness of 5 mm, a diameter of 50 mm, and a central 11 mm diameter hole. The first brass disc has 14 machined rectangular (8 mm x 6 mm) locations to accommodate supports (5 mm x 5 mm). Each slot has a flat and polished well with a depth of 2 mm. The second brass disc is flat to cover the Si3N4 membrane brass support and acts as a cold trap enclosure.\nPrecool the transfer rod in the LN2 filled polystyrene foam box and use it to lock in the full assembly (Figure 6D,E).\nPress \"ENTER\" on the front panel of the freeze dryer.",
    "The turbo and rotary pumps will stop and the chamber purged with dry nitrogen gas to allow opening the lid of the chamber.\nImmediately transfer the sample transfer assembly with the spring-loaded transfer rod into the freeze dryer chamber and clip it on the copper LN2 cold stage.\n\t\tNOTE: Leave the full assembly with the transfer rod into the chamber.\nImmediately close the lid of the freeze dryer chamber and press \"START\" to continue with the freeze-drying cycle.\nFill up the LN2 reservoir of the freeze dryer manually every 2 h.\n\t\tNOTE: An automatic LN2 filling system may be connected to this reservoir.\nAt the end of the freeze-drying cycle, press \"STOP\" to vent the chamber, and remove the full assembly to access the freeze-dried samples."
