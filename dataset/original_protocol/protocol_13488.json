  "procedures": [
    "Follow all Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines, obtaining approval for all animal procedures before beginning. Requirements for aseptic surgery technique can be found from The Guide26 and the Animal Welfare Regulations27. The study was approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol number 4332-11-20. Obtain multiparous (two litter) female breeders. Rats should be pair housed in a vivarium accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and provided with food and water ad libitum. Animals in this study were Lewis rats obtained from Charles River and were between 4 and 6 months of age to accommodate the two-litter requirement. Animals were maintained on a 12 h light-dark cycle.\n1. Pelvic organ prolapse repair using uterosacral ligament suspension\nEquipment and surgical area preparation for live animal surgery\n\t\nPrepare the surgical area such that the surgical board is heated to 37 °C using recirculating hot water heating pads along with a sterile waterproof pad. Ensure sterility of the surgical board and surgical area using a bleach free surface disinfectant followed by 70% ethanol wipe.\nUse autoclave heat sterilization to sterilize all autoclave safe supplies, including surgical instruments, surgical sponges (gauze), cotton swabs, and a disposable drape. Obtain sterile packaged surgical gloves.\nObtain electric clippers, ophthalmic ointment, ethanol wipes, cotton swabs, and iodine solution, along with sterile packaged scalpel blade and sutures, and place at the work bench.\nAnimal preparation for live animal surgery\n\t\nCarefully place the animal into an anesthesia chamber supplied with 2% isoflurane and weigh the animal after the proper plane of anesthesia is reached. Proper anesthetization is confirmed when the animal is non-responsive to a toe pinch.",
    "Place the animal onto the surgery board in the prone position with the nose securely in the anesthesia cone supplied with 2% isoflurane. Apply ophthalmic ointment to each of the animals' eyes.\nAdminister opioid analgesic and NSAID analgesic subcutaneously (Table of Materials).\nPlace the animal in the supine position, as shown in Figure 2, and shave off the abdominal fur from the xiphoid process down to the urethral orifice (8 cm x 4 cm). Sterilize the abdomen with three charges of iodine and alcohol to prepare the incision site.\n\t\tNOTE: If shaving results in bleeding, achieve hemostasis with pressure prior to preparing the skin with iodine and alcohol prep pad. Maintain iodine on the skin for 30 s.\nIf there is no surgical assistant available, deposit sterile supplies and instruments onto a sterile instrument tray, including sterile cotton swabs, drape(s), sponges (gauze), surgical blade, sutures, and surgical marker (optional). If a surgical assistant is available, then this step can be omitted, and the assistant can provide the sterile instruments following step 1.3.1.\nHysterectomy and uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS)\n\t\nDon a surgical gown, head cover, mask, and sterile gloves. Drape the animal with a sterile field, leaving only the abdomen exposed.\nMake a 7 cm incision down the linea alba from just below the xiphoid process to the lower nipple line using a scalpel blade. The incision should end ~0.5-1.0 cm rostral from the urethral orifice. Then, make an incision through the muscle layer underneath. Avoid the abdominal wall blood vessel to prevent bleeding.",
    "Assemble the abdominal retractor and inspect the abdominal cavity (Figure 3A). Using iris forceps, gently locate the left uterine horn. The uterus is deep insidethe bowel, which is often the structure first encountered upon entering the peritoneal cavity. It is beneficial to first identify the ovary (Figure 3B) and the associated ovarian fat pad.\nGently elevate the left uterine horn with a grasper or mosquito clamp and begin hysterectomy by ligating the horn below the ovary and oviduct using a mosquito clamp. The ovaries are delicate structures and are easily damaged or devascularized with manipulation. Take care when elevating the uterine horns; grasp the horn a safe distance from the ovary to achieve this.\nContinue the hysterectomy by clamping and trimming adjacent vasculature, connective tissue, and fat from the uterine horn using micro scissors. Clamp the connective tissue prior to removal to reduce bleeding. Place the clamps as close to the uterine interface as possible, all the way down to the uterocervical junction (also termed as horn bifurcation).\nClamp across the uterine horn near the point of bifurcation using mosquito forceps (Figure 4A-C). Excise the ipsilateral horn just cephalad to the clamp to avoid bleeding. This is located between the utero-cervical junction (just rostral to the cervix) and the utero-tubal ligation point. The vaginal vault will remain post the hysterectomy (Figure 4D).\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the small caliber of the rat vessels, ligation of the uterine stumps with a temporary clamp was sufficient for this surgery. However, this technique can be modified as needed with either sealing of the pedicles with electrocautery or suture ligation.\nRepeat steps 1.3.3-1.3.6 on the right uterine horn to perform a total hysterectomy.",
    "Adjust the abdominal retractor to expose the lower pelvis. Inspect the exposed vaginal vault and the pelvic floor support ligamental and connective tissues, which can be seen attached to the vagina and cervix. If possible, identify the ureter bilaterally, which is just medial to the ovaries.\nIdentify the uterosacral ligaments28,29, shown in Figure 5A, which can be found attached to the cervix just below the remaining stumps of the uterine horns (vaginal vault). The ligament is traced in a cephalad-medial orientation toward the sacrum.\nUsing a 3-0 polydiaxanone suture on a small, tapered needle, place a stitch through the left uterosacral ligament. Place the stitch high on the ligament, close to the sacrum.\nTug on the stitch to ensure it has captured the uterosacral ligament-the USL structure inserts into the cervix with the origin diving behind the rectum where it attaches to the sacrum. Again, identify the ureter to ensure it has not been incorporated into or kinked with the uterosacral stitch.\nThen, pass the left polydiaxanone stitch through the left aspect of the vaginal vault (Figure 5B), with care to incorporate both the anterior and posterior aspects of the vaginal cuff. Repeat the steps to complete the USLS procedure on the right side. Multiple stitches can be placed bilaterally, if desired.\nOnce the uterosacral stitches are placed bilaterally, securely tie the suture using a square knot, as shown in Figure 5C, such that the vaginal vault is elevated cephalad toward the sacrum; this completes the uterosacral ligament suspension.\nClosing the surgical wound\n\t\nReplace the abdominal contents back into their anatomical position within the peritoneal cavity. Close the deep layers of the abdominal wall (peritoneum, fascia, muscle) with continuous suture pattern of 4-0 to 6-0 polyglactin 910 or polydiaxanone suture.",
    "Close the skin with a running subcuticular (or interrupted) stitch of 4-0 to 6-0 polydiaxanone or polyglactin 910. Administer antibiotic subcutaneously as needed for surgical site infection prophylaxis.\nPerform post-surgical monitoring until the animal has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return the animal to social housing until fully recovered.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64311/64311fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Animal preparation for live surgery. Removing fur from the area surrounding the incision site is necessary for proper aseptic technique. The area shown in panels (A) and (B) are guidelines. Researchers should remove enough hair such that sterile instruments make no contact with hair during surgery.

The uterine horns are typically not visible when the abdomen is first opened, as shown in (A). Once a horn is located and followed to find (B) the ovary and oviduct where they connect to the horn, the top of the horn can be clamped, and the horn separated to begin hysterectomy.

Uniaxial tensile testing\nNOTE: The testing system and software used was operated following the manufacturer's guidelines for calibration and testing. All testing occurred at 22 °C.\nSpecimen preparation\n\t\nEuthanize the rat using an IACUC-approved pharmacological procedure. Ensure death via secondary physical method. Here, CO2 inhalation was used followed by cardiac puncture. Expose the vaginal vault in preparation for tensile mechanical testing. In the current study, perform tensile testing on native uterosacral ligaments (control), as well as on animals who had undergone uterosacral ligament suspension as described above (POP).\nTest ligaments in situ 24 weeks following surgery. A terminal timepoint of minimum 8 weeks is suggested to allow for the complete reabsorption of the sutures.\n\t\t\nFollowing humane euthanasia, make an incision down the linea alba to expose the abdomen.\nBegin dissecting off the adipose tissue until the vaginal vault is visible. Continue to dissect off the abdominal fat pads until the intact USLs is clearly visible (control animals, Figure 6A) or the junction between the uterosacral ligament and the vaginal vault is visible (POP animals, Figure 6C). Use caution to not pull on the junction to remove adipose tissue, but rather using careful cuts with micro-scissors to maintain consistency between samples.",
    "Using a flexible ruler, measure the distance between the uterosacral insertion (posterior to the rectum) and the vaginal vault. This value is the original length of the tissue.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The original length of the tissue, the gauge length, for control USLs measured 13.4 ± 0.5 mm while the gauge length for USLs repair measured 12.8 ± 0.4 mm.\nThread umbilical tape behind the intact USL (control, Figure 6B) or the USLS junction (POP, Figure 6D) such that the tissue is centered on the umbilical tape. Measure the height and width of the tissue where it intersects with the umbilical tape using digital calipers. These values will be used to calculate cross-sectional area.\nAttach a large compression plate (Table of Materials) via the base adapter and position the animal atop such that the specimen is centered beneath the grip holder.\nTensile testing\n\t\nProgram the tensile testing regime into the software: pre-load, pre-condition, pull to failure. This follows previous pelvic floor29 and reproductive tissue30 mechanical testing protocols.\nSet up the instrument in preparation of tensile testing. For the current study, use a 10 N load cell, a 3D printed grip, and a base adapter to attach a compression platen as shown in Figure 7.\n\t\tNOTE: Any base set-up that can support the full size of the animal is acceptable. Use any grip that can securely hold the umbilical tape. A custom 3D printed holder and grip from previous studies31,32 was used in this testing. STL files were included as supplemental files.\n\t\t\nPosition the animal such that the specimen is centered beneath the grip (Figure 8A). Immobilize the pelvic region surrounding the specimen by securing the animal to the platen (Figure 8B).",
    "Lower the load cell such that the tails of the umbilical tape easily reach the grip. Secure the umbilical tape in the grip, leaving the tape slack to avoid specimen manipulation.\nOpen the pre-conditioning test in the software interface and label the test with the sample name. Ensure that the pre-conditioning method includes the pre-load step.\nClick to start the pre-conditioning test, which will pre-load the sample at 0.015 N. Once the pre-load force is stable, the test will precondition the sample at an elongation rate of 0.1 mm/s for 30 s. Allow the tissue to rest for 1 min. While waiting, load the pull-to-failure testing regime.\n\t\tNOTE: The pre-load force may vary depending on the instrument limitations and the testing conditions. Refer to previous studies where the reported pre-load ranges from 0.015 N to 0.1 N29,33,34,35,36.\nOpen the testing regime that is programmed to pull to failure. Label the test with the sample name and click on Okay to get to the next window. Input the gauge length of the sample and then click on Next to transition to the test page.\nBalance all and click on Start. Allow the test to run at an elongation rate of 0.1 mm/s until the tissue has been pulled to failure. The test will produce load-displacement data.\nCalculation of stress, strain, and modulus for tensile testing\n\t\nUsing the load-displacement data, the cross-sectional area, and the gauge length from the sample, calculate the stress (MPa) and strain (%) as previously reported37,38,39,40,41. Use Equation 1 and Equation 2 shown below. Note that stretching of the tape during testing should also be accounted for in these calculations.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64311/64311eq01.jpg     Equation 1\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64311/64311eq02.jpg     Equation 2",
    "From the load-displacement curve (Figure 9A,D), calculate the stiffness (linear slope, N/mm) and ultimate load. From the stress strain curve, calculate the tangent modulus (linear slope, MPa) and the ultimate stress. The linear region of the stress strain curve is noted in Figure 9B,E with the calculated tangent modulus from this region shown in Figure 9C,F for both experimental groups.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For both the stiffness and tangent modulus, identify the linear portion by choosing a window of points that maximizes the R2 value for a linear regression37,41.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64311/64311fig06.jpg\nFigure 6: Specimen preparation for uniaxial tensile testing.
