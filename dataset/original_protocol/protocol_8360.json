    "All subjects must give their written consent prior to examination, and the recording protocol must be approved by the appropriate local ethical review board(s). All methods described here were approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency.\nNote: The recordings are made with the “TRONDNF” recording protocol, which is a part of the software (see the Table of Materials). Other equipment used is a bipolar stimulator, a 50 Hz noise eliminator, an amplifier, and an analogue-to-digital (A/D) board (also recommended is an audio amplifier for feedback of electromyogram (EMG) activity, and a muting box to cut off the sound during electrical stimulation). Motor unit number estimation by the MScan method involves three stages: 1) preparation of the subject (as for nerve excitability studies), 2) recording the CMAP scan, and 3) analyzing the results with MScan software. The recording procedure described below is specific to the software and instruments we use (see the Table of Materials); these will need to be adapted for other software and hardware.\n1. Preparation of the Subject\nScreen the subjects to ensure that they do not have any history of nervous system disorders (particularly neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome), other than the disease group that will be investigated.\nInstruct the subject in detail about the examinations and request written consent.\n\t\nInform the subject that when the recording starts, the power will gradually be increased to a maximum followed by a stepwise decrease, and the examinations will take about 5 - 6 min.\nExplain that the subject will experience a tickling feeling in the hand and fingers.\nInform the subject that the power can be switched off immediately at any moment during the recording, if the subject feels too much discomfort.",
    "Clean the subject’s hand and forearm with skin prep gel and alcohol.\nPlace the active recording electrode over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle and the reference electrode on the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb (Figure 1).\nPlace a ground electrode on the dorsum of the hand.\nConnect these electrodes to the pre-amplifier (Figure 1).\nTape the fingers together to eliminate noise and artefacts due to voluntary movement (Figure 1).\nMaintain the skin temperature between 32 °C and 36 °C with a warming lamp.\n2. Recording the CMAP Scan\nNote: All software actions described below are specific to the software and instruments we use (see the Table of Materials); these will need to be adapted for other software and hardware.\nStart the semi-automated computerized system.\nSelect ‘MScan-R’ recording protocol from the 'Select recording protocol' form.\nAccept default settings for the pre-amplifier and the stimulator.\nOn the 'Select recording parameters' form, enter in the 'Output file' box a 2- or 3-letter operator prefix, then click on the \"O.K.\" button.\nWhen the program displays the Raw EMG input, select either ‘MScan parameters’ (scan step, interstimulus interval, and stimulus width) manually, or accept the default parameters: stimulus width of 0.2ms, scan step of 0.2%, and interstimulus interval of 0.5 s. Click on \"OK\" or press the “Escape” key to continue.\n\tNote: The default parameters were accepted in this study. Filter settings were 3 Hz -3 kHz.\nPlace a repositionable bipolar stimulating electrode on the median nerve at the wrist to find the site of lowest threshold. Click “OK” to start stimulation.",
    "The next display shows the stimulus (initially 15% max output) and the EMG response; adjust the electrode position to find site of lowest threshold (i.e. largest response). Adjust the position of the recording electrodes if necessary to ensure that the shape of the CMAP is diphasic with a single peak, if possible. If needed, adjust stimulus strength with the ‘Insert’ and ‘Delete’ keys. Then, click “OK” to continue.\n'Modified' response appears, with 'window', in which response is measured, indicated by horizontal magenta line. Ensure that the short green line before the window (indicates the baseline) is a flat line between stimulus artifact and response. If necessary, set the window start by depressing right mouse button, drag the cursor to the right, and then release the button for window end.\n\tNote: CMAP peak height is measured from baseline to the upward peak within window, and is indicated by vertical blue line.\n\tClick \"OK\" to continue.\nReplace the repositionable electrode with a non-polarizable adhesive stimulating cathode electrode and place an anode 2 cm proximally along the median nerve; bottom trace now shows high gain EMG. Encourage the subject to find the most relaxed position for their hand to minimize spontaneous activity. Click \"OK\" to continue.\nIncrease the stimulus intensity manually by pressing the “Insert” key until the stimulus current is above the level for the maximal amplitude of the CMAP; first, increase by steps of 3% in stimulus intensity, and then for fine adjustments use steps of 1%.\nCheck the window and peak measurement before clicking on the “OK” button to start CMAP scan.",
    "Note that after the responses to 20 supramaximal stimuli (pre-scans) are recorded, the stimulus intensity is automatically decreased in small steps, from supramaximal stimulation until there is no longer a discernible motor response, then a further set of 20 CMAPs (post-scans) is recorded.\n\tNote: The data are plotted as a ‘CMAP scan’, or a detailed stimulus response curve with the amplitude of the motor response on the y-axis and stimulus intensity on the x-axis. In healthy subjects, this creates an S-shaped curve, whereas in patients with reduced numbers of motor units, as in ALS, the curve develops a stepped appearance (Figure 2).\nNotice that in addition to the feedback achieved from the muting-box, it is possible to check in the middle panel on the left-hand side if the subject is relaxed. Look at the CMAP (modified) on the left top panel, and on the left bottom panel, the decrease in stimulus intensity (threshold). Follow the CMAP Scan on the right-hand side.\nFinish the recording by clicking on the “OK” button in the lower right corner unless a repeat scan is required and save the data.\n\tNote: When completing the 'Legends and scaling' form it is necessary to replace all the question marks.\n3. MScan Analyses\nNote: All software actions described below are specific to the software and instruments we use (see the Table of Materials); these will need to be adapted for other software and hardware.\nFitting a model to the CMAP scan\nTo analyse the recording offline, start the analysis program and click on \"O.K.\" to select the the last recording for analysis.\nClick on the “select ‘Fit MScan QZD file” from the “MScanFit“ menu.",
    "Note: One can instead select “Fit MScan on MEM file”. It is alo possible to select “Fit MScan on dat (mA mV) file” in case the CMAP Scan was recorded with equipment different from that used here. See below how to create a DAT file.\nObserve that the program first generates a preliminary model, and then goes on to optimize the fit. No user intervention is required until the multi-coloured progress bar in the 'Optimization' box is complete and the \"Stop\" button is grayed out.\nThe preliminary model provides a first guess of a model, derived from the slope and variance over successive parts of the scan. Note that the original scan (in black) and a scan generated from the model (in magenta) may be plotted side by side. Follow the model and improvements in the model on the text display and alternative displays.\n\t\tNote: Alternative displays may be selected at any time according to the options in the 'Data to plot', 'Plot amplitudes as', and 'Plot type' boxes.\nPerform optimization to improve the fit to the recorded CMAP by making serial adjustments to minimize the difference between the simulated and recorded CMAP scans16.\n\t\tNote: This runs several optimizations in succession, starting with the preliminary model, as previously described in detail15. If the optimization increases the number of units, then the next attempt at fitting the scan starts by generating a model with more units, whereas if the first optimization reduced the number of units, the second attempt starts with a model with fewer units. If all works well, the optimization procedure zeroes in on the best number of units to fit the scan.\nNotice that when running the optimization procedure, the optimization panel also shows a multi-colored progress bar.",
    "Use different plotting options at the “plot type” box, i.e., contour plots, error v N units, model units, cumulative amplitude to follow the optimization process.\n\t\tNote: The changes in the model during the optimization procedure are continually updated according to the latest model and the improvements in the model may be followed by different plotting options and on the text display.\n\t\t\nContour maps\n\t\t\t\nUtilize contour maps to assess the accuracy of the model by blurring the points and generating an error score based on the difference in the x-y distributions15. Select “Diff” and “Contour map” displays to see the differences between the recorded and model CMAP scans as a contour map. It is these differences that the optimization process tries to minimize.\n\t\t\t\tNote: 'Contour maps' enables the probability density of obtaining a given response with a given stimulus. The error score depends on the difference between the original and modeled contour map, and this can be visualized by selecting the ‘Diff’ option in the top panel and the ‘Contour plot’ in the Plot type panel. The red lines indicate that there was a greater density of points in the original scan, and the green lines indicate more points in the modeled scan. The difference plot at the top indicates the stimulus intensities at which the greatest errors are found.\nError v N units\n\t\t\t\nFollow the optimization procedure by selecting the log-log ‘Error v N units’ plot. Each stage of the optimization procedure is plotted in a different color, corresponding to the bars in the ‘Optimization’ panel.\nModel units\n\t\t\t\nUse this to see how the mean CMAP amplitude is made up by the recruitment of the different axons in the model; the top part shows the peak amplitudes and threshold distributions of the individual motor units.\nCumulative amplitude",
    "Note that the units are plotted in order of increasing size, rather than threshold. The black curve plots the cumulative unit number, while the red curve shows cumulative amplitude.\nWhen the optimization process is complete, view the results of the analysis on the 'MScanFit text display'. The available MScan parameters, i.e., number of units, median amplitude, largest unit size are shown on the text display.\nClick on the “OK” button in the 'Save fit to MEM file' box to save the model in the MEM file for further analyses.\n4. CMAP Scan MUNE Using .DAT Files\nNote: An alternative and free version of the software enables analysis of CMAP Scans recorded by other equipment.\nGenerate a.DAT file containing the CMAP scan to be analyzed.\n\tNote: This must be a text file in a standard 2-column format, with the stimulus intensity in mA in one column and CMAP amplitude in mV in another column.\nGenerate a suitable.DAT file by copying two columns from a spreadsheet file into a text editing software, and then designating the extension as.DAT rather than.TXT.\n\t\nPerform all the other steps of the MScan analysis as previously described, after starting the stand-alone program and selecting the.DAT file.\nFind the freeware program, manual, and specimen data on the University College London FTP site (Host: 144.82.46.62, User name: QtracW, Password: Hg32wK5e).\nSubscription Required.
