    "Ethical approval for this study was provided by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office of Switzerland. All animal experiments were conducted in strict adherence to the Swiss federal ordinance on animal protection and welfare as well as according to the rules of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC).\n1. Generation of Brain Free-floating Sections\nTo ensure optimal sample quality, prepare a fresh solution of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) on the day of the perfusion.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is moderately toxic by skin contact and a probable carcinogen. Use nitrile gloves to handle PFA and prepare the solution under a chemical fume hood.\n\t\nPrepare 60 mL of PFA solution per animal.\nBring PFA into solution by increasing the pH with 180 - 200 µL of a 5 M KOH solution for every 100 mL of PBS and heating the solution up to 60 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: NaOH should not be used as it negatively impacts tissue preservation upon fixation.\nLet the solution cool down to room temperature and bring the pH down to 7.4 using HCl. Filter the solution using filter paper (see Table of Materials).\nPerform a whole mouse fixation via transcardial perfusion as previously described15 with some modifications. First, flush the blood from the vasculature using 20 mL of PBS then perfuse with 40 mL of 2% PFA.\nRemove the brain from the skull as previously described15.\nImmerse a freshly 2% PFA-perfused brain in 20 mL of 2% PFA for 7 h at 4 °C for post-fixation.\n\tNOTE: Increasing the incubation in PFA is not recommended as it can prevent detection of intracellular structures.\nExtensively wash the brain with ice-cold PBS.\nEmbed fixed brains in agarose.",
    "Prepare a 3% agarose solution in PBS using a microwave for heating. Gently swirl the solution to cool it down but avoid solidification.\nDry off the excess of PBS around the brain before immersion into the agarose solution in a plastic container. Rotate the brain inside the agarose to remove air bubbles. Allow the agarose to solidify by cooling it down on ice.\nCarefully remove the agarose block from the plastic container and cut a cube around the brain using a razor blade.Mount the brain onto a vibratome specimen holder (see Table of Materials) using cyanoacrylate glue (see Table of Materials). Allow sufficient time for the glue to solidify before proceeding with the sectioning.\nTransfer the brain in the specimen holder to the vibratome buffer tray filled with PBS.Use the vibratome to section 100 µm brain slices (sagittal or coronal).Collect brain sections in a 6-well plate previously filled with PBS.\nUpon finishing brain sectioning, carefully remove PBS and replace with a 1:1 solution of PBS/glycerol.\nStore sections in PBS/glycerol at -20 °C.\n2. Cell or Organelle Labelling by Immunofluorescence Staining\nCarefully transfer a brain section into a well of a 24-well plate previously filled with 500 µL of PBS per well. The section will remain in the same well until the end of the procedure.\nRinse the section twice with 500 µL of PBS for 5 min under gentle agitation.\nRemove the PBS and perform simultaneous blocking and permeabilization of brain slices.\nPrepare a blocking and permeabilization solution with 0.3% Triton-X and 10% donkey serum in PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Donkey serum can be replaced with goat serum to match the host species of the specific secondary antibodies used.\nIncubate sections with 250 µL of blocking and permeabilization solution for 1 h at room temperature under gentle agitation.",
    "Remove the solution and add a PBS solution containing 5% donkey serum and the primary antibody at an appropriate dilution (e.g., 1:100 to 1:1,000). Incubate overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation.\n\tNOTE: See the Table of Materials for a list of antibodies that successfully label the different cell types of the NVU with this protocol. The optimal dilution of primary antibodies must be determined empirically. For simultaneous labelling of different antigens, dilute all primary antibodies in the same solution. All primary antibodies must be raised in different species. To improve antibody penetration, samples can be incubated for up to 72 h at 4 °C.\nRemove antibody solution and wash sections three times for 10 min in PBS under gentle agitation at room temperature. Remove PBS and add 250 µL PBS solution containing 5% donkey serum and the appropriate species-specific fluorescently labelled secondary antibody. Incubate sections at room temperature for 1 h under gentle agitation.\nSee Table of Materials for a list of the secondary antibodies used with this protocol.\nRemove the antibody solution and wash sections three times for 10 min in PBS under gentle agitation at room temperature.\nRemove PBS and add 250 µL of a 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution with a final concentration of 1 µg/mL. Incubate sections at room temperature for 10 minutes under gentle agitation. Remove DAPI solution and wash sections 3 times for 5 min with PBS.\nMount the brain section on bonding microscopy slides (e.g., histo-bond glass slides).Carefully remove excess PBS around the section on the slide. Add a drop of mounting medium (see Table of Materials) on top of the brain section and carefully cover it with a 0.17 mm (No. 1.5) borosilicate glass coverslip.\nStore samples at 4 °C protected from light until performing the image acquisition.",
    "3. High-resolution Confocal Imaging of the Blood-brain Barrier\nPerform image acquisition with a suitable laser-scanning confocal microscope (see Table of Materials) with laser lines at 405, 488, 561, and 633 nm for excitation of fluorophores in the blue, green, orange, and red regions of the light spectrum. For image acquisition, use a 63X oil objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4.\nIn the acquisition menu of the software that controls the microscope, set the image acquisition parameters. In the drop-down menu of ‘Image size’, select a value of 1024 x 1024 pixels. Modify the pixel size to a value between 200 and 300 nm by adjusting the value of the ‘Zoom’ menu.”\n\tNOTE: For the analysis of intracellular structures, reduce the pixel size to 75 nm. This image size setting substantially increases the acquisition time and can be reduced to 512 x 512 pixels to decrease the acquisition time by imaging a smaller field of view.\nIn the 'Acquisition Speed' drop-down menu, select a value of 400 Hz, i.e. 400 lines per second. In the 'systems settings' menu, select the 'Pixel depth' drop down menu, and change the value to 12 bit.\nIn the microscope software, within the 'acquisition' tab, toggle on the option for sequential frame acquisition. Set the optical section thickness to a value between 0.75 and 1 µm for each channel by modifying the value in the 'Pinhole' menu.\nIn the panel for fluorescent excitation, activate the laser required to optimally excite the fluorophores in the sample, for example a 488 nm laser line for a green-emitting fluorophore.\n\tNOTE: Use a fluorophore spectra viewer (see Table of Materials) to select the adequate excitation laser.",
    "In the panel for fluorescent detection, move the slider to select the wavelengths that will be measured in each channel, for example between 510 and 550 nm for a green-emitting fluorophore.\n\tNOTE: Use a fluorophore spectra viewer (see Table of Materials) to select the adequate detection wavelengths.\nAdd a drop of immersion oil with a refractive index of 1.52 on top of the coverslip with the brain section to match the refractive index of the glass coverslip and objective. Place the sample in the microscope and turn on the epifluorescent lamp to visualize the sample using the microscope binoculars.\nUsing the buttons on the microscope stand, change the filter wheel to select a filter appropriate for visualizing DAPI-stained nuclei. Use the coarse focus to bring the signal from DAPI-stained nuclei into focus.\nUsing the buttons on the microscope stand, change filters to visualize the signal from vascular markers (for example, CollagenIV or CD31) and center the field of view on an individual capillary segment.\nPress the button to start the live-scan mode. During scanning adjust the gain and laser intensity for each channel to maximize the dynamic range of the images and avoid pixel saturation.\n\tNOTE: Use a look-up table which labels saturated pixels to visually assess over-saturation. To avoid signal over-saturation, adjust the settings with the sample which is expected to have the highest fluorescent signal.\nSet the value for line averaging to 2.\n\tNOTE: When using higher acquisition speeds, increase this value to reduce noise.\nEstablish begin and end sections for performing optical z-stacks that span the whole volume of the capillary. Use a step size of 0.45 µm.\n\tNOTE: If images will be used for subsequent quantification, keep the same acquisition settings for the complete data set.",
    "For quantification, acquire 10 to 20 z-stacks per section from at least three different mice for statistical comparisons.\n\tNOTE: Acquire the full data set in the same session to reduce the variability arising from sample bleaching and laser intensity fluctuations.\n4. Image Processing and 3D Reconstruction of the Neurovascular Unit\n(Optional) To increase the axial resolution of the acquired z-stacks, perform deconvolution of the image data set using appropriate software (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nIn the deconvolution software, change the settings to perform \"Blind\" deconvolution, (i.e., using an adaptive point-spread function).\nIn the deconvolution software settings, toggle on the option for Background removal; this option will determine the smallest intensity value in the image stack and subtract it from the intensity values from all pixels in the image.\nIn the deconvolution software settings, toggle off the options for rescaling intensity and resizing to 16 bit depth; these options will keep the original intensity values and dynamic range of the images.\nIn the menu of 'Refractive index', set the value to 1.52. In the 'Set Wavelength' menu, select the emission values for each image channel. For example, select 520 for a green-emitting fluorophore.\nOpen the image data set using software suitable for visualization and analysis of 3-dimensional data sets (see Table of Materials). In the image analysis software, press the \"Surpass\" button to render the 3D volume of capillaries.\nIn the image analysis software press the \"Add new surface\" button to segment the capillary surface. Use the bottom arrows to move between steps in the surface creation wizard.\nIn the 'Create' tab, set the source channel to the channel with capillary marker, for example CollagenIV, and set the surface area detail to a value of 0.5 µm.",
    "NOTE: The latter option applies a Gaussian filter to the image and determines the smoothness of the surface.\nIn the 'create' tab, toggle on the option for absolute intensity threshold.\n\t\tNOTE: This option will create a surface by generating a mask based on the absolute intensity of the selected channel in the image.\nOn the next step in the surface creation wizard, adjust the lower intensity threshold for the surface by moving the sliding window across the intensity histogram until the rendered mask covers the whole capillary in the image. Determine the value range for this parameter empirically for each data set.\nOn the final step of the surface creation wizard, click on the drop-down menu under \"Filter Type\" and select the option 'Number of Voxels'. Set the minimum number of voxels to a value between 1.0e5 to 2.0e5.\n\t\tNOTE: This option will exclude surfaces with a small number of voxels, for example, small segments of capillaries at the edge of the frame.\nFinish the surface creation wizard and save the creation parameters by clicking \"Remember parameters\" in the rebuild tab of the surface menu.\nRepeat the procedure for the whole imaging data set by loading the parameter set used for the first image. Adjust the parameters for the intensity, threshold, and minimum number of voxels for each image to account for differences in background intensity and capillary morphology, respectively.\nTo segment intracellular vesicular structures (e.g., immunoglobulin-filled endosomes), first create a new channel that only includes fluorescent signal from within the capillary.\n\tNOTE: This process will define a region of interest by creating a mask using the capillary surface created in step 4.3",
    "Select the 'edit' menu in the 'capillary surface' panel. Under 'mask properties', click \"Mask All\". Select the channel that contains the intracellular vesicle signal as the 'Source Channel' and toggle on the option \"Duplicate channel before applying mask\".\nIn the 'mask settings' column, select \"Constant inside/outside\" and \"Set voxels outside surface to:\" and set its value to 0.00.\n\t\tNOTE: This process will create an additional channel in the image where all voxels outside the capillary mask will have an intensity value of 0. To quantify events outside of the capillary (i.e., in the brain parenchyma), choose \"Set voxels inside surface to:\" and set its value to 0.00.\nTo segment vesicular structures, press the button to start the \"Add new Spots\" wizard. Use the bottom arrows to move between steps in the surface creation wizard.\nIn the create tab, use the drop down menu under \"Source Channel\" to select the intracellular masked channel created in step 4.4.4.\nIn the create tab, under the \"Spot detection\" section, set the estimated XY diameter to a value between 0.5 and 1 µm, depending on the average size of vesicles observed in the experiment. This option determines the smallest size which will be detected by the segmentation algorithm.\nIn the create tab, under the \"Spot detection\" section, toggle on the option for \"Background Subtraction\".\n\t\tNOTE: This option will smooth the image with a Gaussian filter of 0.75 spot radius (from the value selected in step 4.4.7) and then subtracting the intensity of the original image Gaussian filtered by 0.88 spot radius.",
    "In the 'create' tab, press the dropdown menu under 'Filter Type' and select \"Quality\". Note that this will segment the image by applying thresholds based on the intensity at the center of the spots. Adjust the lower intensity threshold by moving the sliding window across the 'Quality' histogram until the majority of identifiable vesicles are labelled.\n\t\tNOTE: The value range for this parameter needs to be determined empirically for each data set.\nFinish the spot creation wizard and save the creation parameters by pressing the button \"Remember parameters\" in the rebuild tab of the surface menu.\nRepeat the procedure for the whole imaging data set by loading the parameter set used for the first image. Adjust the parameters for the 'Quality intensity threshold' for each image to account for differences in background intensity.\n5. Quantification of Intracellular Transport at the BBB\nQuantify the volume (in µm3) and area (in µm2) of the capillary segment. In the analysis software, access the statistics panel of the vascular surface created in step 4.3. Select the 'Detailed' tab, and use the drop down menu to select \"All values\" to find the values for volume and area.\nQuantify the number of vesicles within the capillary segment. In the analysis software, access the statistics panel of the spots created in step 4.4. Select the 'Overall' tab to find the value of the total number of spots in the image.\nTo calculate the number of vesicles per capillary volume, for each image normalize the number of spots by the volume calculated in step 5.1. Multiply this value by 1,000 to get the number of vesicles per 1,000 µm3 of the capillary volume.",
    "To quantify the total intensity within the capillary create a new surface that covers the entire image following the instructions described in steps 4.3 with the following modifications. Select the channel that contains the pertinent signal (e.g., mIgG) as source channel and set the value of the surface area detail level to 5 µm. To create a surface that covers the whole image, set the value of the lower intensity threshold to 0.\nIn the analysis software, access the statistics panel of the surface created in step 5.4. Select the \"Detailed\" tab, and use the drop down menu to select \"All values\". Record the values for 'Intensity Sum' for the channels of interest; this parameter corresponds to the sum of individual intensity values over all pixels.\n\tNOTE: For an intracellular signal, this corresponds to the duplicated channel with voxels outside surface set to 0.0. For a signal in the brain parenchyma, this corresponds to the duplicated channel with voxels inside surface set to 0.0.\nTo calculate the fluorescence intensity per capillary volume, for each image normalize the intensity by the volume calculated in step 5.1. Multiply this value by 1,000 to get the fluorescence intensity value per 1,000 µm3 of the capillary volume.\n\tNOTE: For fluorescent signals in the brain parenchyma, normalize the values by the total image volume minus the capillary volume and multiply by 1,000 to get the total intensity per 1,000 µm3 of brain parenchyma.\nRepeat the procedure for the whole data set and use appropriate software to perform statistical analysis of the data."
