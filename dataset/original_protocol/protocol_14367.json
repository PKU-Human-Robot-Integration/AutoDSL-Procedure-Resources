  "procedures": [
    "The study protocols were approved through the local ethical review board (www.EKNZ.ch) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n1. Serum Collection\nCollect serum samples from humans at time points of interest. For this study, we collected sera at days 0 (time of influenza vaccination), +7, +30, +60, and +180 after vaccination.\nTo obtain the serum, centrifuge the sample tubes at 1,200 x g for 10 min at room temperature (20 - 25 °C).\n\tNOTE: Non-centrifuged blood samples should be stored at 4 °C, and for no longer than 24 h.\nAliquot the serum into different tubes (cryo-vials) and freeze at -80 °C until use.\nPerform the subsequent assays batch-wise, including all the time-points of one person to reduce variability within a patient.\n2. Preparation of Antigens\nCAUTION: Five different antigens are used (see Table of Materials). Prepare antigens in a Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory.\nAccording to the manufacturer's instructions, reconstitute the total contents of one lyophilized influenza antigen ampoule with 1.0 mL of distilled water and allow the dissolved antigen to stand for a minimum of 5 min at room temperature before proceeding.\nAliquot the antigen solution to 1.5 mL tubes and freeze at -80 °C until further use.\n3. Preparation of Cholera Filtrate\nNOTE: Cholera filtrate is used as a receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) according to the WHO protocol12. This removes innate inhibitors from the serum which would interfere with the assay17.\nReconstitute the lyophilized RDE according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nStore the RDE solution in a 15 mL tube at 4 °C until further use.\n4. HA Assay",
    "NOTE: To ensure that the HI assays are comparable between several plates, the same amount of virus particles must be used for each plate. The HA assay (also called HA titration) is performed to quantify the virus particles necessary for hemagglutination, and is recorded in HA units. A \"unit\" of hemagglutination is an operational unit dependent on the method used for HA titration and is not a measurement of an absolute amount of virus. Thus, an HA unit is defined as the amount of virus needed to agglutinate an equal volume of a standardized RBC suspension. According to the WHO, the standard amount used for the HI assay is 4 HA units per 25 µL. For an illustration of the principle of the HA assay see Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Principle of hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition. No hemagglutination occurs in a negative control situation without viruses and antibodies (left column), and erythrocytes hemagglutinate only in the presence of influenza virus (middle column). However, when the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus is blocked by virus-specific antibodies then no hemagglutination can occur (right column).

(* flows when tilted).\nPreparation of the RBC Suspension\nDilute the RBC stock suspension (10%, v/v; except human type O) (see Table of Materials) with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to make the proper concentrations for avian and mammalian RBCs of 0.75% and 1%, respectively.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Plate design of the HA assay.  The HA titration is performed in duplicates. No antigen was added to the control rows. Also see Figure 4 for the determination of the best antigen concentration.

Use the V-shaped micro titer plate when working with avian RBCs, like chicken and turkey. Use the U-shaped micro titer plate when working with mammalian RBCs, like guinea pig and human type O (Table 2).\nAdd 25 µL of influenza antigen to the first well of the antigen-rows, which are arranged in duplicates. No antigen is added to the control rows. The control rows should not show a hemagglutination effect and serve as negative controls (Figure 2).\nPerform a serial 2-fold dilution by transferring 25 µL from the first well of the antigen-rows to successive wells by using a multichannel pipette. Mix each dilution step by pipetting up and down gently 10 times.\nDiscard the final 25 µL of the last wells.",
    "Add 25 µL of PBS to wells 1 to 12 of each used row by using a multichannel pipette, in order to reach a total volume of 50 µL per well.\nAdd 50 µL of the RBC suspension to each used well by using a multichannel pipette.\nTap the plate carefully 10 times on all four sides to mix.\nCover the plate with a lid and incubate at room temperature for the appropriate amount of time depending on the RBC species used (see Table 2). Do not move the plate while incubating.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Agglutination patterns of avian and mammalian RBCs. V-shaped micro titer plates are used when working with avian RBCs. The readout is performed in a tilted plate position, and non-agglutinated RBCs start to run down forming a tear-like shape. U-shaped microtiter plates are used when working with mammalian RBCs. The readout is then performed in a non-tilted position, and non-agglutinated RBCs form a small halo. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig3large.jpg]\nReading the plate\n\tNOTE: The readout is slightly different when using avian RBCs compared to mammalian RBCs, because of the different shaped micro titer wells (Figure 3).\n\t\nReadout of avian RBCs\n\t\t\nTilt the plate 90° for 25 s.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Tilting the plate is crucial for the differentiation of avian patterns, because all three different types of agglutination patterns (completely agglutinated, partially agglutinated, and non-agglutinated) appear as a button when not tilted.\nMark the results immediately, while the plate is still in a tilted position, on a printed scheme of the 96-well plate. The agglutination patterns of the avian RBCs are shown in Figure 3.\nReadout of mammalian RBCs\n\t\t\nMark the results on a printed scheme of the 96-well plate, without tilting the plate (horizontal position on the bench).",
    "NOTE: When hemagglutination occurs, the agglutinated cells do not settle to the bottom, whereas non-agglutinated cells appear as a halo at the bottom of the well. The halo of the partially agglutinated cells is less intense and has a larger diameter (Figure 3).\nDetermination of 4 HA units.\n\t\tNOTE: The HA titration end point is the last well where complete hemagglutination occurs. This well contains 1 HA unit of virus. Because of the 2-fold dilutions of the antigen, two wells ahead of the HA titration endpoint is the well that contains 4 HA units of virus (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Readout of the HA titration with avian RBCs to determine the titer of 4 HA units.  The optimal antigen amount required for hemagglutination is measured by the hemagglutination assay (antigen titration assay). The last well where complete hemagglutination occurs is the HA titration endpoint and contains 1 HA unit. Because of the 2-fold dilutions of the antigen, two wells ahead of the HA titration endpoint, the titer corresponds to 4 HA units.

HI Assay\nNOTE: The work-flow of the protocol has been optimized to allow a more efficient handling of multiple samples at the same time, by using PCR tube stripes and a thermo cycler (see below).\nPreparation of the Serum Samples\n\tNOTE: Prepare serum samples in a BSL-2 laboratory.\n\t\nThaw the frozen serum samples of each time point of every person (see step 1.2) at room temperature.\nAdd an aliquot of 10 µL of each thawed serum sample to a tube of a PCR tube strip (10-tubes in one strip).",
    "NOTE: The big advantage of using PCR tube strips is that a multichannel pipette can be used for the following steps in the HI assay; this saves a lot of time when testing a large amount of serum samples and when performing repeated measures of the same samples for antibody titers against different virus strains.\nStore the aliquoted serum samples in the PCR tube strips at -80 °C until use.\nOne day before the HI assay is performed, thaw the serum sample aliquots of interest at room temperature.\nAdd 10 µL of the appropriate anti-serum to an empty PCR tube.\n\t\tNOTE: To serve as a positive control, the anti-serum against a specific virus must match the used virus. The positive control allows for standardization of plate performance over multiple plates.\nAdd 30 µL of cholera filtrate solution to each serum aliquot and to the anti-serum (3 volumes of cholera filtrate to 1 volume of serum) by using a multichannel pipette.\nKeep the PCR tubes in a PCR 96-well rack or an empty tip-box and vortex for 5 s.\nIncubate the samples overnight at 37 °C using a thermo cycler.\nIncubate the samples at 56 °C for 30 min to inactivate the cholera filtrate using a thermo cycler.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the thermo cycler, this step can be programmed to further automate the process.\nKeep the PCR tubes in a PCR 96-well rack or an empty tip-box and vortex for 5 s.\nStore the samples at 4 °C in the fridge until use for the HI assay.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig5v2.jpg",
    "Figure 5: Plate design and workflow of the HI assay. Five time points of two people can be measured on one plate. The HI titer ranges from 8 to 1,024. An anti-serum of the used antigen served as a positive control and a back titration was performed to check if the antigen dilution equals 4 HA units. The serial dilution of the serum sample is shown for 2 individual vaccine recipients.  Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig5v2large.jpg]\nHI assay\n\tNOTE: For an illustration of the principle of the HI assay see Figure 1. Depending on the virus, different species of RBCs are used for the assay (Table 1). The different species of RBCs are used in various types of 96-well plates, and the incubation time as well as the appearance of the non-agglutinated cells differs (Table 2). For the HI assay, 4 HA units of virus or antigen are added to the 2-fold dilution series of the samples.\n\t\nPreparation of the antigen solution\nCalculate the volume of antigen solution needed according to the number of 96-well plates used (25 µL antigen per well × 96 = 2,400 µL antigen per 96-well plate; add 100 µL per plate extra due to the usage of a reservoir for the multichannel pipette; a total 2.5 mL of antigen per plate).\n\t\t\tNOTE: For example, if measuring 100 serum samples then 10 plates are needed (10 samples per plate): 2.5 mL x 10 = 25 mL of antigen solution needed in total.\nPrepare the proper dilution of 4 HA units for the calculated volume using PBS.",
    "NOTE: 4 HA units are determined for the HA assay. For the appropriate amount of antigen, divide the calculated volume by the titer corresponding to 4 HA units. For example, 4 HA units correspond to a dilution of 1/64, and we needed 15,000 µL of antigen solution are needed: 15,000/64 = 234.4 µL of the dissolved lyophilized influenza antigen are added.\nPreparation of the RBC suspension\nCalculate the volume of RBC suspension needed according to the number of 96-well micro titer plates used (50 µL RBC suspension per well × 96 = 4,800 µL RBC suspension per 96-well plate; add 200 µL per plate extra due to the usage of a reservoir for the multichannel pipette).\nDilute the RBC stock suspension (normally 10%, v/v; except human type O) with PBS to make the proper concentrations for avian and mammalian RBCs of 0.75% and 1%, respectively.\nPreparation of the 96-well micro titer plate\nLabel the 96-well micro titer plates (sample ID, positive control, and back titration). Please check the plate orientation in Figure 5 carefully.\nAdd 25 µL of PBS to every well except to the first well of the \"back titration\" row (Figure 5, 12th row) using the multichannel pipette.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A back titration was performed to check if the used antigen dilution equals 4 HA units. An antigen titer of 4 HA units is indicated if hemagglutination occurs in the first three wells of the \"back titration\" row, but not in the fourth well.\nAdd 50 µL of the prepared antigen solution (described in 5.2.1) to the first well of the \"back titration\" row (12th row).\nAdd 25 µL of the RDE-treated serum samples to the first wells of rows 1 to 10 on each plate, using the multichannel pipette.",
    "Add 25 µL of the appropriate anti-serum to the first well of the 11th row as a positive control.\nPerform serial 2-fold dilutions by transferring 25 µL from the first well of each row (1 - 12) to successive wells by using a multichannel pipette. Mix by pipetting up and down 10 - 15 times for each dilution step. The same tips can be used for each dilution step per sample.\nDiscard the final 25 µL of the last wells.\nAdd 25 µL of the antigen solution by using a multichannel pipette to each well of rows 1 to 11 (serum samples and anti-serum). The same tips can be used if they do not touch the wells.\nAdd 25 µL of PBS instead of antigen to each well of the \"back titration\" row (12th row).\nTap the plate carefully 10 times on all four sides to mix.\nCover the plate with a lid and incubate at room temperature for 30 min. Do not move the plate while incubating.\nAdd 50 µL of the RBC suspension to every well.\nTap the plate carefully 10 times on all 4 sides to mix.\nCover the plate with a lid and incubate at room temperature for the appropriate amount of time depending on the RBC species used (see Table 2). Do not move the plate while incubating.\nReading the plate\n\t\tNOTE: The HI titer is the reciprocal of the last dilution of (anti-) serum that completely inhibits hemagglutination. It is important to consider that the RDE-treated sera were already diluted 1:4 and after the serial dilution step, the sera in the first wells are diluted 1:8, which corresponds to a HI titer of 8.\n\t\t\nReadout of avian RBCs\n\t\t\t\nTilt the plate 90° for 25 s.",
    "​NOTE: Tilting the plate is crucial for the differentiation of avian patterns, because all three different types of agglutination patterns (completely agglutinated, partially agglutinated, and non-agglutinated) appear as a button when not tilted.\nMark the results immediately, while the plate is still in a tilted position, on a printed scheme of the 96-well plate. The agglutination patterns of avian RBCs are shown in Figure 3.\nReadout of mammalian RBCs\n\t\t\t\nMark the results on a printed scheme of the 96-well plate, without tilting the plate.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: When hemagglutination occurs, the agglutinated cells do not settle down whereas non-agglutinated cells appear as a halo at the bottom of the well. The halo of the partially agglutinated cells is less intense and has a larger diameter (Figure 3).\nDetermine the HI of each sample and transfer it to a computer-based table (Figure 6)\nNOTE: Partially agglutinated wells were determined as a lower titer. For example, if a serum sample completely inhibits hemagglutination up to the 4th well (1:64 dilution) and the 5th well (1:128 dilution) is partially agglutinated, then the HI titer is set to the lower titer 64 for the final analysis (Figure 6, 4th row).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig7.jpg\nFigure 6: Readout of the HI assay with avian RBCs. The pre- and post-vaccination induced influenza specific antibody response is determined by HI assay. In this example, person one has higher HI titers than person two. Both persons show an antibody response after vaccination; 180 days after the vaccination the antibody titers of both persons are decreased again. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55833/55833fig7large.jpg]Subscription Required.
