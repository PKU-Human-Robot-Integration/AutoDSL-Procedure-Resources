Experimental scheme for tissue processing and homogenization\nIn this procedure, a specific brain region of an adult mouse (8 weeks old or older) is dissected and homogenized immediately.\nCritical: When working with small number and sparsely distributed cells, performing immunoprecipitation using frozen tissues may reduce the yield of immunoprecipitated RNA. If pooling tissue from multiple animals is needed, each animal should be processed separately all the way through immunoprecipitation and the samples from each animal are pooled before the RNA isolation step.\nTurn on refrigerated centrifuge at least 15 min before using to allow sufficient time for cooling down.\nMake working homogenization buffer and working rinse buffer from the stock solutions (please see in the “Preparation of stock solutions” and “Preparation of Buffers”) and keep them on ice.\nCritical: Always make working buffer fresh.\nRigorous wash of Dounce homogenizers (2 mL or 7 mL):\nFill the empty mortar with milliQ water. Put two pestles in two separate conical tubes, fill the tubes with milliQ water, and let them sit for 10 min at room temperature (21°C–26°C).\nWash with milliQ water for 3 times by homogenization with both loose pestles and tight pestles.\nWash once with 70% Ethanol by homogenization with both loose pestles and tight pestles.\nWash with UltraPure water for 3 times by homogenization with both loose pestles and tight pestles.\nPlace on ice.\nRinse with ice-cold rinse buffer right before use.\nCritical: Rigorously cleaning Dounce homogenizers significantly reduces contamination.\nCritical: Rinsing Dounce homogenizers with rinse buffer can avoid dilution of homogenization buffer by the residual water left in the homogenizer.",
    "Discard the filled rinse buffer from the mortar, remove the rinse buffer as much as possible, fill it with 500 μL cold homogenization buffer and keep the mortar in ice-water all the time.\nNote: It is important to consider the ratio of tissue to buffer. For example, 2%–3% weight per volume of tissue or 25 mg of tissue in 1 mL of buffer would be sufficient for tissue homogenization and lysis. Too much tissue would reduce homogenization and immunoprecipitation efficiency. Making the homogenate too diluted does not affect homogenization but would waste valuable reagents. Balancing cost and dilution depend on the tissue size and RiboTag expression levels.\nBring one animal at a time to the surgical room and decapitate the animal immediately. Write down the ear tag number. Cut the tail for re-genotyping to confirm the genotype of the mouse. If live decapitation without CO2 euthanasia is not approved in your animal protocol, do a CO2 euthanasia before decapitation.\nCritical: Because gene expression may change when mice experience prolonged handling or exposure to other mice under surgery, it is important to minimize this effect by bringing one animal at a time to the surgery room and euthanizing the animal immediately without waiting.\nNote: We suggest adding one control animal without RiboTag expression to serve as a negative control.\nNote: We highly recommend that you cut tails from the mice you dissect the brains and confirm the genotypes of the mice. The previous genotyping results might have been wrong due to various reasons.\nQuickly remove the brain out of the skull and put it into a petri dish containing ice-cold HBSS.\nDissect out the brain region as quickly as possible under a dissecting microscope.",
    "Critical: It is important to enrich the sparsely distributed RiboTag-expressing cells by dissecting out only the region of interest.\nRinse the dissected tissue with ice-cold rinse buffer quickly.\nCritical: This rinse reduces the amount of dissection buffer (HBSS) in the dissected tissue and may improve immunoprecipitation efficiency.\nTransfer the dissected tissue into the mortar filled with cold homogenization buffer (with Protector RNase Inhibitor).\nUse a pre-cooled Dounce and a loose pestle to homogenize the tissue immediately for 20 times.\nHomogenize the tissue with a tight pestle for 20 times.\nLet the foam (generated by homogenization) and homogenization lysate go back to the bottom of the mortar by waiting 10 min.\nTransfer the lysate into a pre-cooled RNase-free microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge in the pre-cooled refrigerated centrifuge, 10,000 × g, 4°C, for 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatant into another pre-cooled microcentrifuge tube and put the tube on ice.\nRepeat from step 4 to step 15 for next animal until all animals are done.\nOptional: Alternatively, you can finish all animals to step 12 and then centrifuge all of them (steps 13–15) at the same time.\nImmunoprecipitation, washing, and RNA elution\nTiming: 17–20 h (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/355-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Experimental scheme for immunoprecipitation, washing, and RNA elution\nIn this procedure, the HA-tagged ribosomes together with their bound translating mRNA is immunoprecipitated by using an anti-HA antibody. After washing off unbound protein and RNA, the RiboTag bound mRNA is isolated.\nCritical: The following procedure is performed in 4°C cold room or 4°C fridge\nMix the lysate by inverting up and down a few times.\nTransfer 5–10 μL of the lysate to a pre-cooled microcentrifuge tube with ice-cold 100 μL TRIzol and vortex for 30 s. Save it in a −80°C freezer. This lysate can be used for isolating Input sample RNA.",
    "Add 3 μL of the HA antibody into the rest of the lysate and put on a rotator and rotate for 6 h.\nCritical: The amount of HA antibody used here is dependent on the number of RiboTag-expressing cells in the tissues of interest, 3 μL HA antibody used here is for induced-RiboTag expression in newborn neurons in two dentate gyri (from one mouse) (Gao et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Slightly more HA antibody is fine, however, too much antibody might lead to unspecific IPs.\nWashing magnetic G-protein beads:\nResuspend the magnetic G-protein beads and transfer 300 μL of the beads to an RNase-free tube.\nPut the tube on a magnetic stand and wait for 3–5 min until the liquid becomes clear. Remove and discard the supernatant and fill the tube with 500 μL of the rinse buffer.\nPlace the tube on a rotator and let it rotate for 5 min.\nRepeat steps b and c one time.\nNote: To further reduce potential impact of non-specific bindings on magnetic beads, you may consider adding one negative control that uses IgG instead of HA antibody for IP.\nPlace the tube containing rotated G-protein beads (from step 20) on a magnetic stand and wait for 3–5 min until it becomes clear, remove the supernatant.\nTransfer the HA antibody incubated lysate into the tube.\nCritical: Transfer the HA antibody incubated lysate into the tube that contain the G-protein beads (from step 21) immediately after removing the supernatant from the tube.\nPlace the tube on a rotator and let it rotate at 4°C overnight (12–16 h).\n(Next day) Make fresh Wash Buffer using stock solutions.\nCool down the wash buffer on ice. Ensure the buffer is ice-cold before use.\nPlace the tube with incubated lysate on a magnetic stand, wait until the lysate become clear.",
    "Keep the tube on the magnetic stand and remove the supernatant.\nOptional: In step 27, the supernatant can be saved in – 80°C if needed. This can be used for evaluating the IP efficiency if you are carrying out optimization experiments.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold wash buffer and rotate the tube on a rotator for 5 min.\nRepeat steps 26–28.\nRepeat steps 26 and 27.\nAdd 0.5 mL ice-cold wash buffer and rotate the tube on a rotator for 5 min.\nTransfer the fully resuspended RiboTag ribosome-Ab-Beads particles into a pre-cooled tube.\nCritical: There are some unspecific RNA or ribosome binding on the inside wall of the original immunoprecipitation tube, therefore, we transfer to a new tube for additional washing and elution.\nAdd 0.5 mL ice-cold wash buffer to the “old” tube and invert the tube up and down to collect the residual resuspended RiboTag ribosome-Ab-Beads particles.\nCritical: Add step 33 to increase recovery of the immunoprecipitated RNA.\nTransfer the 0.5 mL wash buffer with the residual resuspended RiboTag ribosome-Ab-Beads particles and combine with the previous 0.5 mL wash buffer in the “new” tube.\nWith the “new” tube, repeat steps 26–28.\nPlace the tube with incubated lysate on a magnetic stand, wait until the lysate become clear.\nRemove and discard the supernatant.\nQuick mild spin (200 × g, 5 s) the tube to bring down all the residual wash buffer to the bottom of the tube.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic stand, carefully remove the residual wash buffer at the bottom of the tube.\nCritical: Add steps 38 and 39 to increase recovery of RNA from the magnetic beads.\nCarefully remove the tube from the magnetic stand.\nAdd 100 μL of TRIzol right onto the beads.",
    "Critical: To elute immunoprecipitated mRNA (small amount of RNA) from the magnetic beads efficiently, use TRIzol to elute RNA from magnetic beads. This is also the best way to protect the small amount of immunoprecipitated RNA from degradation.\nVortex for 30 s at room temperature (21°C–26°C).\nQuick spin the tube (500 × g, 5 s) to pellet the beads.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic stand, wait until the supernatant becomes clear.\nTransfer the supernatant into a new pre-cooled tube and put it on ice.\nAdd 50 μL of TRIzol right onto the same beads.\nRepeat steps 42–44.\nCritical: Add steps 46 and 47 to elute RNA completely from the magnetic beads.\nTransfer the supernatant and combine it with the previous eluted 100 μL in the “new” tube.\nContinue to the RNA purification procedure or store the eluted RNA in TRIzol at −80°C for subsequent RNA purification.\nPause Point: The eluted RNA in TRIzol can be stored at −80°C for at least 6 months (we tested).\nRNA purification\nTiming: 0.5–1.5 h (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/355-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Experimental scheme for RNA purification\nIn this procedure, the immunoprecipitated RNA is purified from the RNA TRIzol elute. To purify RNA (small amount of RNA) from TRIzol elute, use column-based Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kits. We compared several kits for small-amount-RNA purification, the TRIzol based RNA purification yielded the highest quality of RNA. This is also the best way to protect the small amount of RNA from degradation. Besides, the smaller diameter of membrane in the elution column allows to elute RNA in a small volume of elutes therefore there in no need to add an extra step to concentrate the purified RNA.\nCritical: This is the step that you can pool samples from multiple mice if pooling is needed.",
    "Prepare DNase I digestion mix by mixing 5 μL DNase I (provided in the Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit, 6 U/μL) and 35 μL DNA digestion buffer in an RNase-free tube.\nThaw the eluted RNA in TRIzol at room temperature (21°C–26°C), process to next step immediately after the sample thawed.\nCombine TRIzol elutes into one sample if needed.\nAdd an equal volume of ethanol (95%–100%) to the TRIzol lysate sample and mix thoroughly.\nTransfer the mixture into a Zymo-Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 30 s, at room temperature (21°C–26°C).\nTransfer the flow-through in the collection tube back into the Zymo-Spin IC Column and centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 30 s, at room temperature (21°C–26°C).\nCritical: Let the TRIzol-ethanol mixture go through the Zymo-Spin IC Column twice or more times to increase the RNA yield.\nAdd 40 μL of the DNase I digestion mix onto the center of the membrane in the column and incubate at room temperature (20°C–30°C) for 10 min.\nWash with 400 μL Direct-zol RNA PreWash two times, then wash with 700 μL RNA Wash Buffer according to the instruction of the Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (https://www.zymoresearch.com/pages/direct-zol[href=https://www.zymoresearch.com/pages/direct-zol]).\nTo elute RNA, add 11 μL of DNase/RNase-Free Water directly onto the center of the membrane in the column and incubate for 3 min at room temperature (21°C–26°C).\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 2 min.\nTransfer 1 μL of the purified RNA in a tube for determining the quality of the purified RNA (RIN score or DV200) and immediately store the rest of the purified RNA at −80°C for subsequent RNA fragmentation.\nDetermine the quality of the purified RNA with an Agilent bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (https://www.agilent.com/en/product/automated-electrophoresis/bioanalyzer-systems/bioanalyzer-rna-kits-reagents/bioanalyzer-high-sensitivity-rna-analysis-228255[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/automated-electrophoresis/bioanalyzer-systems/bioanalyzer-rna-kits-reagents/bioanalyzer-high-sensitivity-rna-analysis-228255]).\nRNA-seq library synthesis\nTiming: 4–8 h",
    "In this procedure, the RNA sequencing library is synthesized. For synthesizing sncRiboTag-Seq sequencing library, the Pico Input Mammalian SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 requires less input RNA and therefore works well for sncRiboTag-Seq. There are several other advantages of using this kit for low input RNA, which will be emphasized in following procedures. We have customized the generic manufactural instruction with several modifications.\nPreheat a hot-lid thermal cycler at 94°C, ready for use.\nPrepare the fragmentation reaction mix in a pre-cooled RNase- and DNase-free PCR tube on ice and mix well:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_11.csv\nNote: The sncRiboTag-Seq library synthesis allows for the use of small amount of input RNA (as less as 250 pg) and RNA with wider range of qualities: The quality of RNA purified using our procedure is normally very high (RIN > 8). Since RNA needs to be fragmented, the starting RNA can be partially degraded (RIN > 4) or even highly degraded (RIN < 4).\nFragmentation of RNA based on the quality of the RNA (see CRITICAL). Incubate the fragmentation reaction mix at 94°C for 4 min, then place the tube on ice for 2–3 min to cool down the fragmented RNA immediately.\nCritical: For partially degraded RNA, the time used for fragmentation must be optimized. We normally use a shorter fragmentation time than what the kit suggested. For example, for RNA with RIN at 5–6, the fragmentation time needs to be reduced to 3 min based on our experience. For highly degraded RNA, the fragmentation time needs to be optimized using low temperature (72°C) incubation and without adding the 5× First-Strand Buffer. Please see the details in the instruction of the kit.",
    "Note: This kit incorporates SMART (Switching Mechanism At 5′ end of RNA Template) cDNA synthesis technology and generates Illumina-compatible libraries via PCR amplification, avoiding the need for adapter ligation. The directionality of the template-switching reaction preserves the strand orientation of the original RNA, making it possible to obtain strand-specific sequencing data from the synthesized cDNA.\nPrepare the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis mix before the RNA fragmentation. Combine the following reagents in following order in a pre-cooled RNase- and DNase-free PCR tube on ice:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_12.csv\nRight after cooling down the fragmented RNA, add the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis mix (7 μL) and mix well, quick spin and incubate the final reaction mix in a preheated hot-lid thermal cycler with the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_13.csv\nContinue to the next procedure or store the cDNA (20 μL) at −20°C.\nPause Point: The cDNA can be stored at −20°C for up to 2 weeks.\nPrepare PCR master mix to add Illumina Adapters and Indexes by mixing following reagents in a DNase-free PCR tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_14.csv\nMix the PCR master mix with the synthesized cDNA (20 μL) and place the PCR reaction mix tube in a preheated hot-lid thermal cycler to run the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_15.csv\nCritical: If the input RNA is extremely low (e.g., <250 pg), you may consider increasing the number of PCR cycles by 1–3.\nContinue to the next procedure or store the PCR product at −20°C.\nPause Point: The PCR product (50 μL) can be stored at −20°C for up to 2 weeks.\nTake out AMPure beads from fridge to warm up to room temperature (it normally needs at least 30 min to warm up).\nPrepare freshly made 80% ethanol.",
    "Resuspend the room temperature AMPure beads completely, add 40 μL of the AMPure beads to the 50 μL synthesized library (50 μL PCR product), mix well, and incubate at room temperature (21°C–26°C) for 8 min.\nQuick spin the tube and place the tube on a magnetic stand for 8 min to separate the beads and the solution.\nRemove the supernatant while keeping the tube on the magnetic stand.\nKeep the tube on the magnetic stand, add 200 μL of freshly made 80% ethanol, wait 30 s, and then discard the 80% ethanol.\nRepeat step 76 once.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand and quick spin the tube.\nPut the tube back on the magnetic stand for 30 s and remove the residual ethanol.\nKeep the tube open on the magnetic stand for 5 min.\nAdd 52 μL of Nuclease-Free Water onto the beads pellet and remove the tube from the magnetic stand.\nPipetting up and down the beads 10–20 times and incubate at room temperature (21°C–26°C) for 5 min.\nQuick spin the tube, place it back on the magnetic stand and wait for 3 min.\nCarefully transfer 50 μL of the supernatant (purified synthesized library) to a new DNase-free PCR tube.\nAdd 40 μL of AMPure beads to mix with 50 μL of the supernatant (purified synthesized library). Incubate at room temperature (21°C–26°C) for 8 min.\nCritical: The following steps would deplete ribosomal cDNA, continue to the following steps during 8-min incubation of step 85.",
    "Note: Around 90% of the RNA molecules are ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in total RNA samples. Depleting rRNA from the total RNA would save costs on sequencing. With small amount of immunoprecipitated RNA, initial rRNA depletion from total RNA is not efficient and would lose significant amount of the total RNA. In contrast, depletion of ribosome cDNA after initial cDNA amplification using specific probes is well-suited for dealing with low input library synthesis.\nPlace the tube with AMPure beads and synthesized library on a magnetic stand for 5 min.\nAdd 1.5 μL of the R-Probes v2 in a DNase-free PCR tube, place it on a preheated hot-lid thermal cycler and run the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_16.csv\nNote: “Ready ∗”: The R-Probes are ready for use while they are at this step. The R-Probes might not function well if they are held at 4°C for either too long (after step “Ready”) or too short (before step “Ready”).\nCritical: R-Probes v2 treatment is critical for depletion of rRNA cDNA, to ensure the proper treatment of R-Probes v2, we have modified the heating program to control the time of the treatment.\nRemove the supernatant from the tube from step 86 while keeping the tube on the magnetic stand.\nKeep the tube on the magnetic stand, add 200 μL of freshly made 80% ethanol, await 30 s, and then discard the 80% ethanol.\nRepeat step 89 once.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand and quick spin the tube.\nPut the tube back on the magnetic stand for 30 s and remove the residual ethanol.\nKeep the tube open on the magnetic stand for 5 min.\nPrepare the ribosomal cDNA depletion mix by combining the following reagents in the order shown and mix well by brief vortexing:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_17.csv",
    "Add the mixed ribosomal cDNA depletion mix onto the bead pellets in the tube from step 93.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand, pipet up and down 10–20 times to mix the beads, and then incubate at room temperature (21°C–26°C) for 5 min.\nQuick spin the tube, place it back on the magnetic stand and wait for 3 min.\nCarefully transfer 20 μL of the supernatant (purified synthesized library) to a new DNase-free PCR tube.\nPlace the tube in a preheated hot-lid thermal cycler and run a program as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_18.csv\nPrepare library amplification PCR master mix as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_19.csv\nAdd the library amplification PCR master mix into the PCR tube from step 94 and mix well with the ribosomal cDNA depleted library. Place the final mix on a preheated hot-lid thermal cycler and run the following PCR program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_355_20.csv\nCritical: The number of the PCR cycles for library amplification is extremely critical for sncRiboTag-Seq library synthesis. We try to reduce the duplicates in sequencing by reducing the number of PCR cycles for sncRiboTag-Seq library amplification. The protocol recommends using 14- 15 cycles and 16 cycles for 1 ng and 0.25 ng input RNA, respectively. For sncRiboTag-Seq library synthesis, we normally use at least 2 fewer PCR cycles than the kit recommended for amplification. You may consider using even fewer cycles here if you have already used more than 5 PCR cycles in the initial amplification (step 69 in the “C. Library Synthesis with Addition of Illumina Adapters and Indexes”). For the amplification, one may need to optimize at least once before the real experiments.\nPause Point: The PCR product can be stored at −20°C for up to 2 weeks.\nTake out AMPure beads from fridge to warm them up to room temperature (21°C–26°C).\nPrepare freshly made 80% ethanol.",
    "Resuspend the room temperature AMPure beads completely and add 100 μL of the AMPure beads to the 100 μL amplified library (100 μL PCR product), mix well and incubate at room temperature (21°C–26°C) for 8 min.\nQuick spin the tube and place the tube on a magnetic stand for 8 min to separate the beads and the solution.\nRemove the supernatant while keeping the tube on the magnetic stand.\nKeep the tube on the magnetic stand, add 200 μL of freshly made 80% ethanol and wait 30 s, discard the 80% ethanol.\nRepeat step 107 once.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand and quick spin the tube.\nPut the tube back on the magnetic stand for 30 s and remove the residual ethanol.\nKeep the tube open on the magnetic stand for 5 min.\nAdd 22 μL of Nuclease-Free Water onto the beads pellet and remove the tube from the magnetic stand.\nPipetting up and down the beads 10–20 times and incubate at room temperature (21°C–26°C) for 5 min.\nQuick spin the tube, place it back on the magnetic stand and wait for 3 min.\nCarefully transfer 20 μL of the supernatant (purified synthesized library) to a new DNase-free PCR tube.\nProceed to library validation immediately or store at –20°C\nEvaluate library size distribution by running samples on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit.\nQuantify libraries with Qubit dsDNA HS kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nSequencing and data analysis\nTiming: days to weeks\nIn this procedure, the RNA sequencing libraries are sequenced, and initial analysis is performed.\nLibrary Sequencing: Read 1 matches the antisense sequence of the input RNA and for paired-end sequencing; Read 2 will correspond to the sense strand.",
    "Note: This library synthesis kit incorporates SMART (Switching Mechanism At 5′ end of RNA Template) cDNA synthesis technology and generates Illumina-compatible libraries via PCR amplification. There is no need for adapter ligation. Besides, this strategy preserves the strand orientation of the original RNA, making it possible to obtain strand-specific sequencing data from the synthesized cDNA.\nData analysis: From the raw reads to differentially expressed genes, we used highly compacted software package RSEM for the initial data analysis."
