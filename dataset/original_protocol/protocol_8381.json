  "procedures": [
    "All procedures outlined below have been approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and conform to National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. The procedural flow for the protocol is depicted in Figure 1.\n1. Set-up for the Procedure\nPrepare the brain microvessel buffer (BMB). Start by weighing 54.66 g D-mannitol, 1.90 g EGTA, and 1.46 g 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (i.e., Tris) base into a clean beaker. Add 1.0 L of deionized water. Mix the components of the BMB buffer using a magnetic stirrer. Once the solution has been thoroughly mixed, adjust the pH to 7.4 using 1.0 M HCl.\nPrepare 26% dextran (MW 75,000) solution (w/v) prior to anesthetizing animals. Prepare the dextran solution as described in the following steps.\n\tNOTE: It is critically important to prepare this solution ahead of time because dextran can take approximately 1.5-2 h to dissolve in aqueous buffer.\n\t\nWeigh out the powdered dextran (26 g per 100 mL buffer) into a clean beaker.\nMeasure out the appropriate volume of BMB and dispense into a separate, clean beaker.\nSlowly pour BMB into the beaker containing powdered dextran. Manually mix the powdered dextran during pouring of BMB using a glass stir rod.\nAdjust the pH to 7.4 with 1.0 M HCl immediately prior to use.\n\t\tNOTE: A typical isolation of brain microvessels from 12 individual Sprague-Dawley rats (male or female; 3 months of age; 200-250 g each) requires 200 mL of dextran solution (i.e., 52 g dextran in 200 mL of BMB).\n2. Extraction of Brain Tissue from Sprague-Dawley Rats",
    "Following the desired experimental treatment, anesthetize Sprague-Dawley rats using ketamine (50 mg/kg; 2.5 mL/kg i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/mL; 2.5 mL/kg I,p.). Dilute ketamine and xylazine in 0.9% saline to final concentrations of 20 mg/mL and 4.0 mg/mL respectively. Euthanize animals by decapitation using a sharpened guillotine in accordance with IACUC guidelines. Use the same procedure for both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats.\nResect the skin from the rat skull by making a single transverse cut using surgical scissors.\nUsing rongeurs, carefully remove the skull plate and expose the brain.\nRemove the brain using a spatula. Detach the cerebrum and place the isolated brain tissue into a 50 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of BMB. Add 1.0 μL of protease inhibitor cocktail per 1.0 mL of BMB buffer immediately prior to use.\n3. Brain Processing\nTransfer the brain tissue from the 50 mL conical tube to a clean petri dish.\nUsing forceps, gently roll the brain on 12.5 cm diameter filter paper to remove outer meninges, which are loosely adhered to the cerebral cortex. Gently press the brain tissue against filter paper and roll the tissue again. Turn the filter paper frequently during this step.\nSeparate the choroid plexus from the cerebral hemispheres using forceps.\n\tNOTE: The choroid plexus appears as a clear membranous tissue localized to the surface of the cerebral ventricles.\nGently flatten the brain tissue and remove remaining meninges and olfactory bulbs using forceps.\nPlace the cortical brain tissue into a chilled glass mortar. Add 5.0 mL of BMB containing protease inhibitor cocktail to the mortar.",
    "Using an overhead power homogenizer, homogenize the brain tissue using 15 up and down strokes at 3,700 rpm. Perform homogenization using a 10 mL mortar and pestle tissue grinder. Between homogenization of each individual sample, clean the pestle using 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Homogenization strokes should be consistent in terms of pace and magnitude.\nPour the homogenate into labeled centrifuge tubes.\n4. Centrifugation Steps\nAdd 8.0 mL of 26% dextran solution to each labeled centrifuge tube containing brain homogenate.\nInvert the tube twice and then thoroughly vortex the sample. Conduct the vortexing of each sample using multiple angles to ensure a thorough mixing of brain homogenate solution with 26% dextran solution.\nCentrifuge samples at 5,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: For some analyses, it is useful to compare brain microvessels with brain parenchyma. Should the assessment of protein expression in brain parenchyma be required, the supernatant from this centrifugation step (i.e., brain parenchymal fraction) can be collected and stored at -80 °C for future use.\nRemove the supernatant using a vacuum aspirator and glass Pasteur pipette.\n\tNOTE: Caution must be taken to not disturb the pellet. Otherwise, quantity of the brain microvessels collected will be reduced, which will significantly decrease the protein yield from this procedure.\nResuspend the pellet in 5.0 mL of BMB containing protease inhibitor cocktail (i.e., 1.0 μL protease inhibitor cocktail per 1.0 mL of BMB buffer). Vortex the pellet to ensure thorough mixing.\nAdd 8.0 mL of 26% dextran to each centrifuge tube and vortex as described in steps 4.1-4.2 of this protocol.\nCentrifuge samples at 5,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nUsing a vacuum flask and glass pipette, aspirate supernatant and ensure that pellet containing brain microvessel is not disrupted.",
    "NOTE: Excess material that has adhered to the tube wall does not contain microvessels and should be carefully cleaned and removed.\nRepeat steps 4.5 through 4.8 an additional two times.\nOnce 4 dextran centrifugation steps have been completed, add 5.0 mL of BMB to each pellet and vortex to resuspend the sample.\n\tNOTE: Following completion of step 4.10, whole microvessels can be collected for analysis of protein localization. This can be accomplished by taking a 50 μL aliquot of re-suspended microvessel pellet and smearing on a glass microscope slide. Microvessels are then heat-fixed at 95 °C for 10 min on a heating block followed by fixation in ice-cold ethanol for an additional 10 min. Slides can then be stored at 4 °C until required for imaging studies.\n5. Ultracentrifugation to Prepare Samples of Total Brain Microvascular Membranes\nTransfer samples to the chilled glass homogenizer.\nUsing an overhead power homogenizer, homogenize brain tissue using 8-10 up and down strokes at 3,000 rpm. Homogenization is conducted using a 10 mL mortar and pestle tissue grinder. Clean the pestle using 70% ethanol following homogenization of each individual sample.\nTransfer samples to clean ultracentrifuge tubes. Number and weigh each individual tube. Balance and pair the tubes prior to loading into the ultracentrifuge rotor.\n\tNOTE: All weighing and pairing of ultracentrifuge tubes must be conducted with the caps on to ensure accurate measurement of tube weights.\nCentrifuge samples at 150,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C.\nUsing a vacuum flask and glass Pasteur pipette, aspirate supernatant using care not to disrupt the capillary membrane pellet.",
    "Based on the pellet size, add an appropriate volume of storage buffer, which is comprised of deionized water and BMB in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. Typically, pellets are resuspended in 400-500 μL of storage buffer. Add protease inhibitor cocktail to the storage buffer in a ratio of 1.0 μL per 1.0 mL of storage buffer.\nVortex samples to resuspend pellet in storage buffer.\nUsing a glass Pasteur pipette, transfer capillary membrane samples to a labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPass sample through a needle syringe 5x to ensure the sample is thoroughly mixed and that no cellular aggregates exist.\nStore samples at -80 °C until required for analysis.\n\tNOTE: Protein content of each microvessel membrane sample is measured using the Bradford method.\nSubscription Required.
