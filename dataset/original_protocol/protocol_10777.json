    "1. Modification of Nafion with Quaternary Ammonium Salts\nShake a bottle of 5% w/v Nafion suspension vigorously for approx. 30 seconds to ensure that Nafion is suspended uniformly in solution.\nPipette out 2 mL of the now re-suspended Nafion into a glass vial (vial volume could contain from 2.5 mL to 10 mL).\nMeasure a 3-fold molar excess (relative to the sulfonic acid groups on the Nafion polymer) of the alkyl ammonium bromide salt (appropriate masses are shown in Table 1) and add this to the vial containing the 2 mL of Nafion.\nVortex the vial at 1500 rpm for 10-15 minutes.\nPour the viscous solution into a plastic weighing tray that measures approx. 3 x 3 in., and use a pipette to transfer any residual solution from the vial to the weighing tray.\nAllow the solvents to evaporate out of the weigh boat, leaving a yellow/brown, transparent film on the bottom of the weighing tray (Figure 2). The rate of solvent evaporation should be such that it takes more than 6 hours for all solvent to evaporate. If the solvent evaporates too fast, a white, crusty material will form instead of a transparent film indicating that the micellar structure of the polymer has been destroyed, and you must re-start the procedure. If solvent evaporation is too slow, a de-humidifier may be necessary, because too slow of evaporation typically leads to a tacky, orange gel and you must re-start the procedure. Typical temperature ranges for solvent evaporation are 20 - 37 °C. The actual conditions for drying are a function of the relative humidity and temperature in the room, but it is important that drying being slow to maintain micelle structure, but not too slow to allow for gel formation.",
    "Fill the weigh boat with 18M Ωcm de-ionized water (10-20 mL of water), cover, and allow to soak for 12-24 hours to remove excess alkyl ammonium bromide salts and HBr.\nPour (or pipette) out the water and rinse 3 times with enough DI water to fill the tray each time. Be careful not to lose any of the polymer film during this step.\nAllow the weighing tray to sit uncovered until the polymer is completely dry At this point, the polymer should be a clear and somewhat brittle plastic film. Again, if the air is very humid, a de-humidifier may be necessary to complete the evaporation in a timely manner.\nUsing a spatula, carefully remove the dried film from the weighing tray and transfer it into a clean glass vial.\nAdd 2 mL of ethanol and 3 ceramic mixing beads, and vortex for 4 hours or until the polymer film is completely re-suspended.\n2. Immobilization of Enzymes into TBAB-Modified Nafion for Activity Assays\nFor a dry enzyme, weigh out 1-10 mg of the enzyme into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and add 1 mL of 100 mM pH 7 phosphate buffer to create a 1-10 mg/mL enzyme solution. For an enzyme that is in solution, use a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay13 to determine the amount of protein, and add an appropriate amount of 100 mM phosphate buffer to bring the protein concentration to 1-10 mg/mL. 1-10 mg/mL typically corresponds to 1-50 nanomoles/mL.\nTo 120 μL of the 1 mg/mL enzyme solution, add 60 μL of the alkyl ammonium-modified Nafion solution, and vortex for 10 seconds. (This mixture can be scaled up for large numbers of replicates. Keep the enzyme-to-polymer solution ratio at 2:1.)",
    "Pipette 60 μL of the enzyme/polymer solution into the bottom of 3 separate 1 cm2 cuvettes, and allow to dry overnight.\n3. Assay of Immobilized NAD-Dependent Dehydrogenase Enzyme\nTo the cuvette, add 1.3 mL of 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.8), 1.5 mL of 15 mM NAD (freshly prepared), and 0.1 mL water.\nPlace the cuvette in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (i.e. ThermoScientific Evolution 260 Bio and Thermo Spectronic Genesys 20) set to a wavelength of 340 nm.\nZero the spectrometer, and then add 0.1 mL ethanol. Mix the reagents by gently pipetting the solution up and down 5 times. For a blank, use 0.1 mL of additional water instead of the 0.1 mL of ethanol.\nRecord the absorbance at 340 nm at 5 minutes after the reagents were added to the cuvette and 20 minutes after. Plot the two data points to get a slope that can be used for activity calculations.\n4. Assay of Immobilized PQQ-Dependent Dehydrogenases\nTo the cuvette, add 1.5 mL of sodium phosphate (pH 7.3) and 200 μL of 600 μM PMS.\nPlace the cuvette in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer set to a wavelength of 600 nm and then zero the spectrometer.\nAdd 100 μL of 700 μL DCIP and 200 μL of the substrate of interest (ethanol, acetaldehyde, glycerol, glucose, or glyceraldehyde), and mix the reagents by gently pipetting the solution up and down 5 times. For a blank, use 200 μL of water instead of the substrate of interest.\nRecord the absorbance at 600 nm at 5 minutes after the reagents were added to the cuvette and 20 minutes after.\n5. Assay of Immobilized Glucose Oxidase",
    "To the cuvette, add 2.0 mL of a solution containing 0.2 M p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 0.02 % (w/v) sodium azide, 128 U peroxidase, 0.3 mM 4-aminoantipyrine, 1 M potassium phosphate, and 50 mM glucose. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nPlace the cuvette in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer set to a wavelength of 510 nm.\nRecord the absorbance at 510 nm at 5 minutes after the reagents were added to the cuvette and again at 20 minutes after.\n6. Representative Results\nThe micellar structure of the modified Nafion polymer can be disrupted by drying the original salt/polymer co-casted film too fast. Figure 2 shows a salt/polymer mixture that has been dried correctly resulting in a transparent, light brown film. A film that dries too fast can result in opaque, white flakes of polymer due to the fact that the drying process can destroy the micellar structure.\nOnce the modified Nafion polymer and enzyme have been mixed and co-cast onto the bottom of a cuvette, enzymatic activity assays can be used to assess the stability of the enzyme within the polymer film. Tables 2-4 show assay results of two dehydrogenase enzymes and glucose oxidase immobilized into various modified Nafion films, respectively. Note the higher activity of the enzymes that are immobilized vs. the enzymes in buffer solution, showing that modified Nafion polymers can actually enhance the activity of certain enzymes (called superactivity). Other enzymes have transport limitations that decrease their specific activity when immobilize them in the polymer (i.e. cellulases and amylases, whose substrates are quite large macromolecules).\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nQuaternary ammonium salt used,3 fold excess\nT3A (tetrapropylammonium bromide),32.37 mg/ml\nTBAB (tetrabutylammonium bromide),39.19 mg/ml\nTPAB (tetrapentylammonium bromide),46.01 mg/ml\nTEHA (triethylhexylammonium bromide),32.37 mg/ml\nTMHA (trimethylhexylammonium bromide),27.25 mg/ml\nTMOA (trimethyloctylammonium bromide),30.66 mg/ml\nTMDA (trimethyldecylammonium bromide),34.07 mg/ml\nTMDDA (trimethyldodecylammonium bromide),37.48 mg/ml",
