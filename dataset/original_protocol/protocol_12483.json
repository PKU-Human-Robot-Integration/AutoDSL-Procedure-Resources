    "1. Prescreening\nPrior to testing, obtain written and informed consent from each participant.\nAsk the subject if they have normal or corrected-to-normal acuity (i.e. glasses).\nVerify the stereo acuity of the participant using a simple handheld stereo test.\n2. Achieving Binocular Fusion in the Stereoscope\nSeat the participant at the desk in front of the mirror stereoscope and adjust the height of their chair for comfort.\nTurn off the lights so that they may dark adapt for a minimum of 3 min. The visual system performs best when it is adapted to the prevailing lighting conditions.\nHave the participant look through the stereoscope. They will see a cross displayed on the monitor for each eye. They must adjust the horizontal position of the fixation crosses until they see one cross only, in the center of their field of view. If they see two crosses, then this separation is incorrect and horizontal adjustment is needed. The targets are centered on the crosses when displayed and this procedure ensures fusion at the correct distance.\nThe participant is now ready to commence the experiment.\n3. Task Instructions for the Observer\n\"On each trial you will see two curves that have rotation-in-depth (RID). You are required to decide which of the two curves has a greater RID, in other words which is more rotated away from your view. Press the left mouse button if the first stimulus has a greater RID. Press the right mouse button if the second curve has more RID.\"\n\"This is a forced-choice task in which the next trial does not commence until a response has been made to a previous trial.\"\n\"If you are not sure which stimulus has more RID, please take your best guess.\"\n4. Measuring Sensitivity to Viewpoint Change/RID in Contours",
    "To evaluate the role of stereoscopic cues in judgments of RID, the performance of the participant is measured separately in conditions where stereoscopic cues to RID are presented (stereo conditions) and where they are not presented (nonstereo conditions). To present stereoscopic cues, the computer displays a different RID angle of curve to each eye of the observer, through the stereoscope. To present the curves without stereo cues, the computer presents the same RID curve to both eyes (see Figure 2 for an example of this). The methodological steps below are then repeated for both conditions.\nInitiate the procedure, composed of 140 trials, for the participant. Note: The Method of Constant Stimuli (MOCS13) is used to ensure equal numbers of trials for each value of RID of the test curve employed. The RIDs can be either greater than, less than or equal to 45°, with the particular value being randomly chosen from the set for each trial. The RID of the reference curve is held constant at 45° RID. The presentation order of reference and test stimuli is randomized on each trial.\nAllow the program to record how often the participant chooses the test as being at the greater RID angle.\nGive the participants a break after each block of trials. In this example the 140 trials are made up of 20 repetitions at each of 7 different RID angles for the test curve: 3 angles less than 45°, 3 angles greater than 45° and 1 RID at precisely 45° - the same as the reference curve.",
    "At the end of each run the computer plots out data describing the proportion of times that the participant chose the test stimulus as being at a RID angle greater than 45°, as a function of the presented RID angle (see example data points in Figure 4).\nLet the software fit the data with a Cumulative Gaussian function in order to determine the precision with which they are able to make the RID discrimination. This precision is given by the parameter of the fitted function that determines slope (see example solid lines in Figure 4).\nObtain the slope from each plot. The slope estimates for the stereo and nonstereo conditions can then be statistically compared in order to determine whether stereoscopic cues have contributed to an observer’s ability to detect a change in RID.\nSubscription Required.
