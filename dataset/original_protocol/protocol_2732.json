Instead of medium SILAC, heavy SILAC (Lys-8, Arg-10) could also be used, as the pulse labeled proteins will be distinct from light SILAC in both cases. Step 2 describes how the double pulse-SILAC experiment is performed. Both experiments must be performed in parallel to identify newly translated thermo-sensitive proteins. We recommend collecting at least 3 replicates for each experiment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2390-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

For instance, dilute to a final 0.025 OD600 for an overnight culture (5 cell doublings).\nIncubate the culture at 25°C with shaking at 200 RPM overnight.

    "This section describes how to harvest cells (step 3), generate frozen cell droplets (step 4) and lyse the cells via cryogrinding (step 5). Cell harvesting may span several days, each time the process of harvesting and freezing cells into droplets takes ∼2–2.5 h. We recommend that lysis of all samples and further processing in step 6 occur on the same day. Lysis is carried out in batches of 2 samples (due to the capacity limits of the mixer mill) taking ∼0.5–0.75 h/batch.\nHarvest and wash cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2390-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Place a disposable sterile pipette reservoir filled with liquid nitrogen in a large insulated container with liquid nitrogen up to ∼ half the height of the reservoir. The pipette reservoir serves to limit distribution of the cell droplets.\nUsing a P200 fitted with the modified tip, draw up the cells previously suspended in 2× Native Lysis buffer from step 3.\nSlowly drip the cell suspension into the liquid nitrogen forming small 1–2 mm droplets (alternatively use a repeater pipette set at 5 μL intervals), which will freeze and accumulate at the bottom.\nNote: Hold the needle about 5 cm from the liquid nitrogen surface when forming droplets. If the needle does not allow droplets to form, it is likely frozen due to the cold vapor from the nitrogen. In that case, placing a finger (gloved) on the side of the needle will melt the frozen contents and re-enable the flow of droplets.\nUsing tweezers with the tip previously chilled in liquid nitrogen, collect the droplets and transfer them to a pre-chilled 2 mL cryogenic vial.\nPause point: After snap freezing the cells in droplets, the samples can be stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen indefinitely before generating the lysates by cryo-grinding.\nGenerate cell lysates by cryo-grinding (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2390-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Avoid getting liquid nitrogen into the cup or lid of the grinding jars. Use tongs and tweezers with tips pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen to manipulate cooled grinding jars.\nTransfer the frozen cell droplets generated in step 4 to the cup of the grinding jar, place a stainless-steel grinding ball on top of the droplets and cap the jar tightly with the lid (use insulated gloves to screw on lid).\nKeep the entire grinding jar submerged in liquid nitrogen until the bubbling stops and you are ready to proceed with the next step.\nMount the grinding jars on the Retsch MM400 mixer mill. The mixer mill can accommodate a maximum of 2 grinding jars at a time. If processing only one sample, a second empty jar must be mounted to balance the mill.\nCryo-grind at 30 Hz for 90 s.\nDetach the jars from the mixer and submerge them in liquid nitrogen until the bubbling stops.\nRepeat steps d-g for 3 additional cycles, for a total of 4 cryo-grinding cycles.\nSubmerge the grinding jars in liquid nitrogen to transport them from the mixer mill to your workbench.\nAt your workbench, remove the jars from the nitrogen and open carefully (using insulated gloves) identifying where the cell powder has settled (i.e., lid or cup).",

    "This step describes how to use MaxQuant to perform a proteomic search on the raw MS files and used the results from both single and double pulse SILAC experiments to determine which newly translated proteins are thermos-sensitive (ntSP) and which newly translated proteins accumulate constitutively in the pellet fraction (ntCP) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). The most recent version of MaxQuant is recommended as it includes the newest features and updates to the search algorithm. Here, we used version 1.6.14. Other software can also be used and parameters should be adjusted accordingly. A key element of this analysis is that, following a pulse experiment, the SILAC ratio for each protein will be distinct in the TCL analysis (according to its translation and turnover rates) and therefore needs to be taken in account in the analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2390-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "For double pulse SILAC results, divide the Ratio H/M in the pellet fraction (HP/MP) by TCL (HT/MT) to calculate the log2 [(HP/MP) /(HT/MT)] for each protein in each sample. Determine the average log2 ratio for each protein and calculate the p-value using Student’s t-test against 0 same as what is described in step 16-d. For this analysis, only consider proteins that are in the Hit set from the single pulse SILAC experiment (step 16-d). The double pulse SILAC data alone cannot confidently determine which newly translated proteins are enriched in the pellet fraction after heat-shock, due to the fact the light channel proteins are a composite of proteins from both heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked samples. The heavy over medium ratio differentiates between newly translated proteins that are affected by heat-shock, which correspond to newly translated and thermo-sensitive proteins (ntSP) and newly translated proteins that are always enriched in pellet fraction (ntCP). The ntSP set is composed of proteins with at least a two-fold enrichment and p-value < 0.05; the ntCP set consists of proteins with less than two-fold enrichment and p-value > 0.05. A few additional proteins will not be considered further due to ambiguity.\nProteins of interest from ntSP and ntCP sets can now be selected for further validation by Pulse Expression by Galactose Induction.

    "Primers are designed to amplify the gene of interest (GOI) from genomic DNA and insert it into BPM1809 (pRS426-GAL1p-3HA-CYC1t) between the promoter and 3HA-tag by Gibson assembly (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). If the GOI contains an intron, an alternate strategy is needed (e.g., RT-PCR).\nThe forward primers amplifying the GOI must contain the ATG start codon (in bold) and the reverse primer must omit the stop codon. Both primers should have overhangs which anneal to the insertion region of BPM1809 (Forward primer: 5′ ACGTCAAGGAGAAAAAACCATGn15-25; Reverse primer: 5′ GAACATCGTATGGGTAAGATCCTCTn15-25; n15-25 corresponds to the GOI sequence).\nThe primers should have a minimum Tm of 58°C in the annealing region (sequence shown) and 55°C in the region that anneals to the GOI (n15-25) in the first round of amplification.\nEnsure the GOI is inserted in-frame with the 3HA-tag (i.e., the last codon of the GOI before the stop codon is in frame with the following sequence: AGA GGA TCT TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCT GAC TAT GCG GGC…).\nThe primers for amplifying BPM1809 must be complementary to the overhangs on the insert primers.\nForward primer: 5′ AGAGGATCTTACCCATACGATGTTCCTG. The forward primer anneals directly to the start of the linker and HA tag sequences.\nReverse primer: 5′ CATGGTTTTTTCTCCTTGACGTTAAAG. The reverse primer may include a CAT overhang (bold) corresponding to the ATG codon of the GOI.\nBackbone and inserts are amplified with Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB), but other high-fidelity DNA polymerases can also be used.\nIf using Q5®, calculate annealing temperatures using https://tmcalculator.neb.com[href=https://tmcalculator.neb.com/] using the primer regions that would anneal on the first cycle (i.e., the n15-25 of the GOI or the entire primer sequences listed in step 17 b).",
    "50 μL PCR reactions were prepared and run according to the polymerase manufacturer guidelines, using High GC Enhancer (Q5 polymerase) where needed. 5 ng of plasmid DNA or 200 ng of genomic DNA was used as template for the reactions. All PCRs were run for a total of 30 cycles with extension times calculated according to manufacturer guidelines.\nGel purify PCR products before using for Gibson assembly following manufacturer’s protocol (e.g., Epoch GenCatch™ Gel Extraction Kit[href=http://www.epochlifescience.com/protocol/2260050%20Gel%20extraction.pdf]).\nMeasure DNA concentration using a Nanodrop device.\nLigate insert and backbone using Gibson Assembly kit (NEB).

Incubate at 37°C overnight until colonies appear.\nScreen colonies for inserts by colony PCR.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] To facilitate this step, we typically use a reverse 15–25 nucleotide long primer with a Tm of ∼55°C located 100–300 nucleotides downstream of the ATG of the GOI and the universal T3 primer located upstream of the GAL1 promoter to amplify a ∼500–800 bp product indicating a positive hit.\nVerify correct insertion of the GOI without mutations by sequencing (check for local companies that offer whole plasmid sequencing at low costs).\nTransform GAL inducible constructs into yeast cells using the LiAc/ssDNA/PEG method,8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] and plate with appropriate selection.\nProtein pulse expression by galactose induction\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis section describes how to perform a pulse expression experiment to confirm if a protein is more susceptible to aggregation upon heat shock when newly translated (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] and 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2390-Fig9.jpg",

Schematic of the steps for the protein pulse expression experiment by galactose induction illustrating the heat shock treatment (step 24)\nCulture the yeast transformed with the GAL inducible constructs using 2% raffinose as the sole-carbon source.\nInoculate 250 mL of SD-Ura raffinose media to a maximum of 0.2 OD600 to grow to 0.65 OD600 at 25°C. This can be done by overnight or same-day growth. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCritical: Do not culture the cells in media containing glucose, as glucose actively represses the GAL induction system leading to a large delay from addition of galactose to the start of transcription from GAL1 promoter. Raffinose and galactose must be high purity as low-quality reagents often contain glucose, inhibiting the GAL induction system.\nNote: Cells grow considerably slower in raffinose compared to glucose. Allow extra time to determine doubling times or inoculate several cultures a few hours apart to ensure you get log phase cells. Some strains grow really poorly in raffinose if too diluted. In that case, include a low amount of glucose (0.1%) in the starting culture and verify that GAL induction is effective in these conditions.\nPrepare for heat-shock.\nPre-heat your shaking water bath, along with two 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks (per protein of interest) to 45°C.\nAllow adequate time for all components to get to temperature.\nGalactose induction of “long-lived” and “newly translated” proteins.\nWhen the pre-cultures hit 0.65 OD600, split them into two 125 mL aliquots. One aliquot will have galactose added and the other will continue to grow.",
    "To one aliquot, add galactose to 2% final concentration and allow to grow for 30 min, before adding glucose to 2% to repress GAL driven expression. Let it grow for another 30 min (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). This is the long-lived sample.\n15 min after adding glucose to the first aliquot, add galactose to 2% in the second aliquot that was left to grow. Let it grow for 15 min (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). This is the newly translated sample.\nExpected cell density at the end of these steps is about 0.8 OD600.\nHeat-shock and controls (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nCollect a 50 mL aliquot of the long-lived and newly translated samples in centrifuge tubes and immediately harvest by centrifugation at 3,220 × g at 4°C.

Heat-shock for 30 min in the water bath with shaking at 200 RPM.\nWhile the heat shock is occurring. Collect the cell pellets from the no heat-shock controls and process as described in steps 3–6, to generate TCL, supernatant and pellet fractions.\nCollect the “heat-shocked” samples by decanting back into the 50 mL centrifuge tubes and harvest and process cells as in the no heat-shock controls.",
    "Perform Western blots using the TCL and pellet fractions. The supernatant can also be assessed if desired for additional controls. In our case, we used a precast 10% SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad Mini-Protean TGX), the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (BioRad) and the Odyssey® Imaging system (LI-COR), but other similar systems can be used. For blotting, we used the mouse anti-HA antibodies (AbLab; 1:3000) and rabbit anti-PGK1 for loading controls (Acris; 1:10,000; there should be no significant PGK1 signal in the pellet fractions), and IRDye® secondary antibodies (LI-COR; 1:20,000). We recommend using the IRDye® 800CW Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (800 nm channel) for visualizing the HA signal, as the 800 nm channel has less interference from membrane autofluorescence. IRDye® 680RD secondaries (700 nm channel) can be used to multiplex (i.e., for the loading control), however you should test the strength of the signal from the 700 nm channel for your target before proceeding. Alternatively, the antibodies can be stripped with 2% (w/v) NaOH for 15 min after imaging for HA signal and then re-probed for loading control, to utilize the 800 nm channel for both HA and loading control. Different secondary antibodies can be used depending on the imaging platform.\nEquilibrate the TCL samples from step 6 to 1 μg/μL protein concentration with a final concentration of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.002% bromophenol blue. Complement the 50 μL pellet samples from step 6 adding 2-mercaptoethanol and bromophenol blue as above.\nHeat the samples at 95°C for 3 min. Load 25 μg of TCL (for us ∼5% of the total volume of TCL from step 6a.) on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.",
    "Since the pellet contains a smaller portion of the total protein, a larger proportion of this sample should be loaded, in this case ∼10 μL or ∼20%, to make a 4× concentrated pellet fraction. Keep this ratio consistent across all samples.\nTransfer the gel to a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane for Western blotting using standard procedures (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2390-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Schematic demonstrating quantification of Western blots by image analysis software to obtain band intensities (step 25) for Tpi1\nThe original Western blot was previously published and the results were reprinted with permission from Zhu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nBand intensities were determined in LI-COR Image Studio (other image analysis software may be used) by defining all lanes then selecting a box centered around the HA signal bands and duplicating that box and placing the duplicate at the same molecular weight region for all other lanes. Duplicating the box ensures the same area is quantified. To control for background, select the “lane” background subtraction method (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). We recommend two different analyses:\nTo determine whether the newly translated GOI is thermo-sensitive, compare the HA signal in the pellet fractions of the heat-shocked vs. no heat shock samples. A thermo-sensitive GOI should display a high heat-shocked/ no heat shock ratio (e.g., >2). In contrast, HA signal levels in the corresponding supernatant fractions, if assessed, should not increase.\nTo determine whether only the newly translated GOI is thermo-sensitive or if it is more thermo-sensitive than the corresponding long-lived GOI, compare the HA signal levels in the heat shocked samples. First, normalize the signal of the pellet fractions with the signal in the corresponding TCL, then compare the normalized signals between the newly synthesized and long-lived samples of a given GOI.
