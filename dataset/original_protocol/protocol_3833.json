    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nSacrifice Animals\nTiming: ∼30 min\nVagal ganglia can be extracted from up to 10 animals in an hour by an experienced worker.\nNote: Please see the Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#krt] for the descriptions of the mouse models for which we have confirmed this protocol.\nSacrifice the animals using CO2 inhalation, decapitate with sturdy surgical scissors, and rinse away excess blood in cold ACSF.\nTransfer the heads to fresh cold ACSF and keep them on ice until ganglia extraction.\nNote: We suggest using young animals (5 weeks of age). In our experience the need for more enzymatic and mechanical dissociation to disrupt the ganglia increases as the animals get older (this was evident at the age of 8 weeks). This effect is likely due to toughening of the connective tissue structures in the ganglia. If low cell yields are seen when using older animals, it might be necessary to use more animals to compensate for the lower output; however, this added stress can result in diminishing numbers of viable cells in the suspension. One should also keep in mind that with added stress, the cell survival could be biased towards certain cell populations. See the troubleshooting section for further advice.\nExtract Vagal Sensory Ganglia\nTiming: ∼90 min\nThis section describes the extraction of vagal ganglia from freshly sacrificed animals.\nNote: A person with some prior experience in microdissection should be able to learn the described protocol with a few tries. After the initial learning period it should be realistic to extract both ganglia from a single animal in 10 minutes or less.",
    "Critical: We suggest keeping the dissection time under two hours. In our experience the sensory neurons remain viable inside the ganglia for this time if the tissues are kept in cold ACSF; however, as more time passes the cell death processes within the first dissected ganglia will begin and hinder the collection of viable cells.\nOptional: In highly vascularized tissue it is recommended to perform transcardial perfusion with cold ACSF. The clearing of blood and infiltrating with ACSF can make it easier to identify the ganglia when dissecting and can have a positive effect on cell viability in cases where the dissection takes a long time (>2h).\nCut open the scalp through the midline and peel skin to the sides.\nUsing surgical scissors, make a lateral cut on both sides of the skull and remove the top of the skull to expose the brain (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nStarting rostrally, use the standard pattern forceps to gently lift out the brain.\nCut the brain at the cerebellum and leave the brainstem in place (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nDiscard the forebrain.\nPin the head dorsal side up on a platform and place it under the stereo microscope.\nUse the Dumont forceps to cut the central roots of the trigeminal ganglia but leave the brainstem in place (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Gently pull back the brainstem until you can observe the vagus nerves (along with the glossopharyngeal and accessory nerves) coming out from the jugular foramina on both sides and connect to the brainstem (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/75-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

TG = trigeminal ganglion, Pit = pituitary, TB = temporal bone, JF = jugular foramen, VN = vagus nerve, BS = brainstem.\n(D) An extracted vagal ganglion complex. The dashed line approximates the area of the neuron tissue (grey opaque appearance). The lower voluminous part consists mostly of nodose neurons and the upper part of jugular neurons. The vagus nerve can be seen running through the ganglionic complex. Scale bars: 2 mm (A, B, C); 500 μm (D).\nCritical: Be careful not to pull on the brainstem too strongly as this could cause the vagus nerves to break. The nerves serve as a visual guide to the jugular foramen; therefore, it is very important to keep the nerves intact.\nFocusing on one side, and being careful not to damage the nerve bundle, use the Dumont forceps to gently scrape the connective tissue adhesions around the jugular foramen so that the nerve can move more freely. Using the standard pattern forceps, place one tip close to the jugular foramen on the temporal bone and the other tip on the outside the skull. Grab the temporal bone and apply lateral pressure, twisting outwards until it starts separating from the occipital bone.\nAt the same time, using Dumont forceps, continue scraping away the connective tissue adhesions around the vagus nerve where it enters the jugular foramen. Continue to apply lateral pressure on the temporal bone as needed.\nNote: It is acceptable if the temporal bone breaks during the procedure; however, this can make the extraction of ganglia more difficult. In this case, use the standard pattern forceps to gently remove the broken bone parts, while cutting any connective tissue adhesions to the vagus nerve with the Dumont forceps.",
    "Using two sets of Dumont forceps, gently hold on to the vagus nerve bundle while continuing to remove connective tissue adhesions around the jugular foramen.\nThe vagal ganglion complex appears as a small translucent bulge quite close to the location of the former opening of the jugular foramen. It is commonly attached by adhesions to the side of the temporal bone inside the jugular foramen.\nUsing the Dumont forceps, grab the vagus nerve below the ganglion and gently pull to remove the ganglion.\nCritical: The sympathetic superior cervical ganglion is located around the same region in close connection with the carotid artery; do not mistake this ganglion as the vagal ganglion complex.\nPlace the isolated ganglion on a small petri dish with cold ACSF and observe it under the microscope to verify a successful extraction. You should see a small roundish gray mass of tissue connected to the stumps of the vagus nerve (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nProceed to extract the ganglion on the remaining side.\nCritical: While dissecting, remember to keep the already extracted ganglia in cold ACSF on ice until you are finished working. This will help minimize possible transcriptome changes and maintain viability of the cells.\nMicrodissect and Clean Ganglia\nTiming: ∼20 min\nThe step describes the removal of the remaining dura mater as well as nerve tissue from the ganglia, which is necessary to obtain a clean cell suspension.\nTransfer ganglia into a 35 mm culture dish containing ACSF (4°C; work on ice).\nUsing the spring scissors and fine Dumont forceps, remove the nerve roots as completely as possible from the ganglia. This will reduce time to dissociate the tissue and minimize the amount of unwanted debris, increasing the quality and specificity of the cell suspension.",
    "Transfer the ganglia to a 35 mm dish with 2.5 ml of warm (37°C) dissociation working solution.\nDissociate Ganglia\nTiming: ∼90 min\nThis step describes the dissociation of ganglia tissue by applying mechanical force as well as enzymatic treatment. Incubate for 20 minutes at 37°C in the dissociation working solution\nCarefully pipette 10 times up and down using the Pasteur pipette with the widest bore; use the Dumont forceps to carefully tear open the ganglia\nIncubate for 20 minutes at 37°C\nCarefully pipette 10 times up and down using the Pasteur pipette with the second widest bore.\nIncubate for 20 minutes at 37°C\nCarefully pipette 10 times up and down with third Pasteur pipette; if bigger intact pieces remain use the forceps to carefully tear the tissue open\nIncubate for 20–30 minutes at 37°C\nCarefully pipette 10 times up and down with the fourth Pasteur pipette\nCritical: No large intact pieces of tissue should remain. If it is necessary to incubate longer, add Tryp-LE and repeat the last step; however, the incubation time for ganglia should not exceed 120 min as this can lead to a decrease in cell viability.\nNote: Enzyme concentration, composition, and treatment duration may vary depending on different factors (e.g. age of animals or differences in enzyme activity). Thus, embryonic neuronal tissue requires shorter (∼30min) digestion with papain, a mild protease. Mechanical separation is necessary for most tissues to prevent a prolonged enzymatic treatment which reduces cell viability. If possible, we recommend examining the dissociation progress regularly with a microscope.\nEnrich Neurons\nTiming: ∼90 min\nHere, we describe how to separate the neuronal fraction from the smaller non-neuronal cells and connective tissue debris. Using a cell strainer will remove bigger pieces of tissue that might remain in the suspension.",
    "Critical: It is important is to choose a suitable strainer depending on the cell size of interest. We chose a 40 μm strainer because in mouse the diameter of the biggest vagal sensory neurons is below this limit. The concentration of Optiprep can be adjusted as necessary (higher concentration will result in better debris removal but might lead to loss of cells).\nNote: Remember to cool down the centrifuge chamber (4°C) in advance.\nStop the enzymatic reaction by transferring the cell suspension onto ice\nPrepare a 15 ml tube containing 2 ml of cold ACSF and 1 ml of cold 1xPBS\nCover the tube with a 40 μm cell strainer and filter the cell suspension by carefully pipetting the suspension on top of the strainer mesh\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 100 g for 4 min at 4°C\nDuring the centrifugation, prepare a density gradient in a 15 ml conical bottom tube. Following centrifugation, remove the supernatant from the sample but be careful not to disrupt the cell pellet\nResuspend the pellet in 450 μl ACSF and 450 μl Neurobasal-A\nVery carefully transfer the suspension with a Pasteur pipette on top of the gradient by tilting the tube and pipetting along the side; at the end, two separate phases should be visible\nCentrifuge at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C\nNote: The neuronal cells will sink to the bottom. Most of the debris and smaller non-neuronal cells will remain at the border between the two phases of the gradient.\nRemove most of the supernatant (leave the last 100ul) but be careful not to remove the cell pellet\nAdd 10 μl DNase I to avoid cell aggregation and gently resuspend the pellet with a pipette",
    "Count the cells using a hemocytometer and adjust the volume to achieve the desired concentration; in our hands the final yield has routinely been around 1x103 neurons per animal\nKeep the cell suspension on ice and move to downstream steps without delay"
