These beads will be used to pull down aptamers in solution.\nNote: Peptide biotinylation may be performed using a commercial kit such as Thermo Scientific™\nEZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation Kit (Catalog number: 21435).\nNote: Prepare separate conjugation reactions for each of the desired targets (PP-C, PP-D, specificity filter, and the enrichment reference target). We prepared many reactions simultaneously in a lo-bind deep well plate.\nNote: Peptide-bead conjugates can be prepared ahead of time and aliquoted in 96-well plates for freezing (1 freeze/thaw cycle maximum). Large batch preparation will reduce variation, as beads from the same conjugation batch can be used throughout a single experiment.\nFor each conjugation reaction, prepare 50 picomoles (suggested volume 50 μL) of biotinylated peptide suspended in ddH2O.\nNote: To create conjugated beads for the specificity filter, create a 50-50 equimolar mixture of targets C and D (no PP dipeptide).\nVortex M280 streptavidin beads until homogenous.\nAdd 25 μL of M280 beads to 50 picomoles of biotinylated peptide.\nMix thoroughly.\nIncubate the bead-peptide mixture on a chilled plate for 2 min.\nWash the conjugated beads using SELEX buffer.\nTo the bead-peptide mixture, add 360 μL of SELEX buffer. Mix well by pipetting up and down.\nUse a magnetic rack (Magnetic Stand-96) to separate the beads to the bottom of the well.\nLet sit for 4 min.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat bead washing (steps 6a–6d) 2 additional times.\nAfter the final wash, resuspend the M280 beads in 25 μL of SELEX buffer.\nPause point: Use the conjugated beads in the “Positive Selection” step or store at −20°C.",
    "Note: Using the Bravo liquid handler, we tested 4 bead types (Dynabeads™ M-280 Streptavidin, Dynabeads™ M-270 Streptavidin, Dynabeads™ MyOne™ Streptavidin C1, and Dynabeads™ MyOne™ Streptavidin T1) under BSA blocked and non-BSA blocked conditions with several peptide concentrations ranging from 25 picomolar to saturation. We performed a single round of positive selection using beads conjugated under each condition. The most uniform results by k-mer analysis on sequencing were created using beads conjugated under the conditions described in this section.\nNegative selection against streptavidin beads\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nThe negative selection step is intended to eliminate aptamers from the library with high binding affinity toward the streptavidin bead substrate (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). The library generated through negative selection will be divided for use in 12 parallel SELEX runs (3 sets of target with switch, 3 sets of target without switch, 2 sets of specificity filter, 2 sets of enrichment reference, and 2 sets of bead-only control).\nSuspend the aptamer library in 150 μL at 100 μM using Refold Buffer (equal to 10ˆ15 aptamer molecules).\nPerform aptamer refolding.\nTo refold the aptamer library, divide the library into 50 μL per thermocycler tube.\nHeat tubes at 95°C for 5 min in the thermocycler.\nCool tubes at 22°C (room temperature) for 30 min.\nPrepare the M280 beads by washing the beads 3 times in SELEX buffer.\nTo 55 μL of M280 beads, add 500 μL of SELEX buffer.\nUse a magnetic rack to separate the beads to the bottom of the well.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat bead washing steps (5a–5c) three times.\nAfter the final wash, resuspend the M280 beads in 55 μL of SELEX buffer.\nTransfer the washed M280 beads (55 μL) to a 1.5 mL lo-bind tube.",
    "To the resuspended M280 beads, add the refolded aptamer library (150 μL).\nIncubate the solution on a rotator at 22°C (room temperature) for 30 min.\nPlace the tube in a magnetic rack and wait 1 min for beads to fully aggregate next to the magnet.\nCollect the supernatant. The supernatant is ready for use as the negative selection library.\nMeasure the library concentration using the Qubit ssDNA kit.\nPause point: Use the negative selection library in the “Positive Selection” step or store at −20°C.\nPositive selection\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this positive selection step, aptamers are incubated with peptide targets conjugated to streptavidin beads. The goal is to collect the aptamers which bind to the peptide targets and wash away non binding DNA molecules. The aptamers which are collected will be directly amplified off the beads in the next step. Below are described the steps for a single run. All 12 runs may be completed simultaneously in one row of a 96-well plate.\nPerform aptamer refolding on the negative selection library (see step 9).\nDivide the negative selection library into 12 aliquots to perform 12 runs.\nIn a NUNC deepwell plate, add the appropriate volume of conjugated beads according to the desired peptide to aptamer ratio. Volume of beads may be calculated according to the formula below.",

Do not allow the beads to dry out between Positive Selection and Small Scale Amplification.\nSmall scale amplification\nTiming: 1 h 20 min\nThe purpose of this step is to amplify the aptamers captured in the Positive Selection step. PCR is performed directly off of the peptide-bound aptamers (on beads). All beads from one run are put into a single PCR reaction.\nTo the beads, add PCR reaction reagents.\nPCR Reaction for Small Scale Amplification.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2065_3.csv\nTransfer the solution to a lo-bind thermocycler tube and mix well.\nCycle according to the table.\nPCR Cycling Conditions for Small Scale and Large Scale Amplification.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2065_4.csv\nPerform PCR purification.\nVortex Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads before use.\nIn a lo-bind deep well plate, prepare 30 μL beads for each PCR reaction.\nTo the beads, add 50 μL of 100% ethanol and mix by pipetting.\nNote: The addition of ethanol here is a departure from the manufacturer’s instructions. In pilot tests, we found that the addition of ethanol at this step increases product yield.",
    "Note: Bead and ethanol volumes are determined based on sample volume and desired DNA size. The concentration of DNA input is not considered. For a volume of N uL digested product (before addition of ethanol in step 33c), 0.6∗N uL of beads and 1.0∗N uL of 100% ethanol should be used. Example: 50 μL PCR reaction + 30 μL beads + 50 μL 100% ethanol.\nAdd PCR product (50 μL) to the bead-ethanol mixture.\nComplete 2 ethanol wash cycles according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nElute PCR product in 32 μL of NF dH2O.\nMeasure DNA concentration using plate reader.\nPrepare a portion of the small scale PCR sample for sequencing (see section preparation for sequencing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8]). Using the remaining sample, proceed to Large Scale Amplification.\nPause point: Store stably at −20°C.\nLarge scale amplification\nTiming: 2 h\nThe purpose of this step is to amplify the DNA as much as possible without introducing excess PCR bias. The amplified products will be used in the next round of positive selection.\nNote: Below are described the steps for a single selection. Large scale amplification for all twelve selections may be completed simultaneously in three 96-well plates.\nNote: It is highly recommended to use the protected forward primer, which includes six nuclease resistant phosphodiester bonds at the 5′ end, to retain the sense strand of the aptamer during the single strand generation in the aptamer regeneration step.\nFor the purified PCR product from a single small scale amplification reaction, assemble 24 PCR reactions containing 50 μL each.\nPCR Reaction for Large Scale Amplification.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2065_5.csv\nNote: Save remaining purified PCR product from Small Scale Amplification that is not used in this PCR in −20°C.

    "Transfer the solution to a lo-bind thermocycler tube and cycle according to protocol in step 32a.\nAfter thermocycling, pool the 24 PCR reactions into 8 tubes of 150 μL each.\nPerform PCR purification.\nVortex Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads before use.\nIn a lo-bind deep well plate, prepare 90 μL beads for each PCR reaction.\nTo the beads, add 150 μL of 100% ethanol and mix by pipetting.\nNote: For sample volume N, 0.6∗N uL of Mag-Bind beads and 1.0∗N uL of 100% ethanol should be used (volume N refers to reaction volume before addition of ethanol in step 39c).\nAdd DNA to the bead-ethanol mixture.\nComplete 2 ethanol wash cycles according to manufacturer instructions[href=https://www.omegabiotek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/M1378-PROTOCOL-Mag-Bind-TotalPure-NGS.pdf].\nElute PCR product in 32 μL of NF dH2O.\nPool 8 tubes of cleaned PCR products (8 tubes × 32 μL/tube =256 μL) into a single tube and mix well.\nMeasure the DNA concentration of the purified product using the plate reader.\nPause point: Store purified DNA product stably at −20°C.\nCritical: During PCR, use a reverse primer with 5′ phosphorylation. In the following aptamer regeneration step, lambda exonuclease will only recognize and degrade 5′ phosphorylated DNA strands.\nAptamer regeneration (single-strand generation)\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step converts the double-stranded PCR product from large scale amplification into ssDNA for use as aptamers in the next round of selection using digestion by lambda exonuclease (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). To avoid overdigestion or incomplete digestion, the reaction is first tested on an aliquot of PCR product to determine the appropriate incubation time. The remainder of the PCR product is then digested following the optimal incubation time.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2065-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Aptamer regeneration Digestion with lambda exonuclease removes the 5′ phosphorylated strand of a double-stranded construct",
    "Six phosphodiester bonds at the 5′ end of the sense primer allows preferential preservation of the sense strand.\nDigest 44 μL of purified PCR product from large scale amplification using lambda exonuclease according to manufacturer instructions.\nOn the Agilent bioanalyzer, visualize the digested product. Dilute product if needed to be within manufacturer’s specifications.\nFollow manufacturer instructions for the small RNA protocol.\nNote: Successful conversion of dsDNA to ssDNA is indicated by a shift in peak from 20-40 nt to 60–80 nt. Incomplete digestion will result in multiple varied peaks (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: The small RNA protocol was not designed by the manufacturer for the purpose of distinguishing proportions of dsDNA and ssDNA in a sample. We ran several dsDNA, ssDNA, and mixed DNA controls using various kits made for the Agilent bioanalyzer and found that the small RNA protocol resulted in an acceptable separation in run size between the two.\nIf the DNA is partially digested, extend the digestion reaction according to steps 44a–c below. Otherwise, proceed to step 45.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2065-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Interpretation of bioanalyzer tracings using the small RNA protocol\n(A) Sample containing dsDNA only.\n(B) Sample containing ssDNA, dsDNA, and dsDNA partially digested by lambda exonuclease.\n(C) Sample containing ssDNA only.\nTo extend the digestion reaction, add 1 μL lambda exonuclease and incubate for 2–3 additional minutes.\nVisualize the product using the bioanalyzer small RNA kit.\nRepeat steps 44a–b until the bioanalyzer tracing resembles ssDNA.\nNote: Achieving the ideal digestion time may require optimization based on sample concentration. See “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” for additional bioanalyzer traces.\nDigest the remainder of the purified PCR product.\nIf the aliquot required extended digestion times, the total incubation time (all extended times added together) should be used. Do not add additional lambda exonuclease.",
    "For example, if the aliquot required a 7 min incubation, followed by 1 μL lambda and 3 min additional incubation, followed by 1 μL lambda and 2 min additional incubation, then the optimized regimen is 1 μL lambda over a single 12 min incubation.\nVisualize products using the bioanalyzer small RNA kit.\nCombine the digested aliquot with the remainder of the digested PCR product.\nPerform ssDNA purification of all digested products.\nVortex Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads before use.\nIn a lo-bind deep well plate, prepare 30 μL beads for each digestion reaction.\nTo the beads, add 50 μL of 100% ethanol and mix by pipetting.\nNote: For a volume of N uL digested product, 0.6∗N uL of beads and N∗1 μL of 100% ethanol should be used (volume N refers to reaction volume before addition of ethanol in step 47c).\nAdd products of digestion (50 μL) to the bead-ethanol mixture.\nComplete 2 wash cycles according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.omegabiotek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/M1378-PROTOCOL-Mag-Bind-TotalPure-NGS.pdf].\nElute PCR product in 32 μL of NF dH2O.\nMeasure ssDNA concentration using the qubit ssDNA kit. Dilute samples as necessary to remain within the assay reference range.\nRepeated rounds of positive selection\nPositive selection, small scale amplification, large scale amplification, and aptamer regeneration (steps 17–48) should be repeated for 5 rounds with each of the 12 target conditions with varying stringencies. Stringency is defined as the ratio of peptide molecules to aptamer molecules.\nRepeat Positive selection, Small scale amplification, Large scale amplification, and Aptamer regeneration for a total of 5 selection rounds. In the 5th selection round, stop after small scale amplification and proceed to NGS preparation.\nAdjust the stringency in each round according to Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] by changing the volume of beads added in step 19.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2065-Fig5.jpg",

However, depending on the downstream analysis pipeline, you may choose to sequence more shallowly- aptamers can be identified with ∼10–20 million reads or less if there is sequence convergence.\nIf using custom sequencing primers, these will need to provided and spiked into the kit.\nPre-processing of sequencing data\nThe purpose of this section is to prepare sequencing results for analysis and select final aptamer candidates to be used in a downstream assay (affinity testing, etc).",
    "There are a number of different softwares available for aptamer analysis, or custom code can be written. Published software includes: AptCompare (Shieh et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]), FASTAptamer (Alam et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), AptaCluster (AptaTools; Hoinka et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), MPBind (Jiang et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), APTANI (Caroli et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and RNAmotifAnalysis (Ditzler et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). For a comparison of these softwares, see SI Table 1 of Shieh et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17].\nFor our work, we wrote custom python scripts to perform frequency counts for each sequence and calculate round over round enrichment. Please contact the authors for details regarding custom scripts.\nAfter importing FASTA sequences, these software will perform some or all of the following: Trim off forward and reverse primers, align the random regions, frequency counting of individual sequences (either in the final round or in each round, depending on the sequencing input), sequence enrichment from round to round, sequence family clustering, motif identification, and secondary structure analysis.\nSelecting aptamer candidates\nIn this step, custom code or published software will be used to choose final aptamer candidates.\nPrevious studies have shown that high affinity aptamer sequences can be identified in early rounds of SELEX (Schütze et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). However, round to round enrichment of sequences is also highly correlated with an aptamer that binds to the target of interest (Cho et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nIn our selection, we filtered our candidates by: (1) high copy number in rounds 3,4,5, (2) high round to round enrichment, (3) appearance in the target switch selections, (4) not appearing in the specificity filter selections (indicating they do not have a preference for the C and D backbones), and (5) not appearing in the enrichment reference or beads only selection (indicating it is not contamination sequence).",
    "Our filters resulted in 26 candidate aptamers. We chose 10 candidates to characterize for binding further.\nCharacterizing aptamer candidate binding\nThe purpose of this section is to characterize the binding affinity of the candidate aptamers for the desired target.\nMethods to measure binding affinity (Kd) include microscale thermophoresis (MST), biolayer interferometry (BLI), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and fluorescence assays, where each method has advantages and disadvantages (Plach and Schubert, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). We recommend testing aptamer binding in a manner consistent with the ultimate application of the aptamer. In Hong et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], we performed target-switch SELEX on fluorescently labeled aptamers using biotinylated peptide targets immobilized on streptavidin beads. In their final application for ProtSeq, aptamers would require an oligonucleotide barcode sequence added to the 5′ end. The barcoded aptamers would be screened against peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates immobilized on a chip.\nWhen choosing an assay to characterize aptamers: 1) immobilizing the target on a solid surface versus keeping the target in solution, which may impact the availability of the target to the aptamer (steric hindrance) 2) immobilizing the aptamer to a solid surface versus keeping the aptamer in solution, which may impact how the aptamer secondary and tertiary structure is available to bind to the target and 3) fluorescently labeling the target or binder if either is in solution. Assay availability and throughput may also be a consideration.\nTo determine Kd, a dilution series of either the target or aptamer should be performed. The steps described below will yield Kd measurements for a single 5′ FAM-labeled aptamer sequence. The steps may be repeated for every aptamer candidate that requires Kd testing.",
    "Note: If performing fluorescence assay, make sure the target and aptamer are incubated to reach equilibrium. For SPR and BLI, Kd can be measured based on and off rates along with steady state equilibriums. Ensure that the reagent that is not being varied is in extreme excess so that saturation is reached.\nConjugate 200 pmol peptide target to 100 μL Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin following the manufacturer’s protocol and resuspend to the original concentration in SELEX buffer.\nResuspend 5 mg of fluorescein biotin in DMSO.\nConjugate 650 pmol fluorescein biotin to 100 μL Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin following manufacturer’s protocol (as a positive control) and resuspend to original concentration in SELEX buffer.\nDilute peptide-conjugated beads to 0.03 mg/mL, or 1:320 of original concentration for the binding assay.\nAliquot 100 μL of diluted peptide-conjugated beads or fluorescein-conjugated beads into 10 individual wells of a 96 well plate.\nPlace the plate on a magnetic rack for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\nTo each of 10 wells containing magnetic beads, add 100 μL of 5′ end FAM-labeled aptamers at one of these concentrations: 0 nM (blank control which is SELEX buffer only), 100 nM, 250 nM, 500 nM, 750 nM, 1 mM, 2.5 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, and 20 mM.
