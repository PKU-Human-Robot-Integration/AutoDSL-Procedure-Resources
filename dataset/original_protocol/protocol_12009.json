    "1. Culture of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells\nCoating recombinant Human E-Cadherin Fc Fusion Protein (E-cad-Fc) or other matrices suitable for hPSC culture6\nDilute E-cad-Fc to 15 μg/mL with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline containing calcium and magnesium (DPBS (+)).\nCoat 100-mm suspension tissue culture dishes with 5 mL of diluted E-cad-Fc and incubate at 37 ˚C for at least 1 h. Remove substrate and replace with 5 mL of medium (e.g., mTeSR1 referred as M-medium henceforth)7.\nNote: The culture medium used in this protocol is prepared following published protocols7. However, several other media preparations have been described, or are available commercially, that are likely compatible with the procedure.\nRetrieve a vial of cryopreserved iPSCs from liquid nitrogen. Thaw at 37 ˚C until a small ice crystal remains. Gently pipette cells into a sterile 15-mL conical tube containing 4 mL of the M-medium.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and gently re-suspend cells with 5 mL of the medium supplemented with 10 µM of Y-27632, a selective inhibitor of Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK).\nRemove the M-medium from step 1.1.2, and transfer 5 mL of cells from step 1.1.4 to E-cad-Fc-coated 100-mm suspension tissue culture dishes.\nMaintaining human iPSCs in culture\nOnce iPSCs reach around 80% confluency, remove culture medium and wash once with calcium and magnesium free DPBS (-). Aspirate the DPBS (-) and add a sufficient amount of 0.02% EDTA solution to cover the plates, then incubate for up to 3 min at room temperature.\nNote: At 80% confluence, the plate should contain around 2 x 107 cells. It is important not to overgrow the cells, and to ensure that the cells retain an undifferentiated morphology. The pluripotency of the cells can be determined by staining with stem cell marker Tra-1-60 or equivalent8.",
    "As soon as the cells begin to release, remove the 0.02% EDTA solution and flood the dish with 10 mL of the M-medium to release the cells. Aid the detachment of iPSCs by gently pipetting.\nNote: The average incubation time for cells to detach is around 3 min, but this needs to be determined empirically for each iPSC line. The cells should be released as small clusters containing around 5 - 10 iPSCs per cluster.\nTransfer 1/10 of the suspended cells per fresh E-cad-Fc coated 100 mm suspension tissue culture dish containing 5 mL of the M-medium. Incubate the cultures at 37 ˚C under 4% O2/5% CO2 and change the medium daily.\nNote: Although iPSCs are routinely cultured under physiological oxygen conditions to promote pluripotency, iPSCs can also be grown using ambient oxygen.\n2. Differentiation of Human iPSCs to Hepatocyte-like Cells on 96-Well Plates\nNote: This section describes the differentiation of iPSCs in a format that is compatible with screening. Using this approach, it is possible to induce human iPSCs to differentiate and form hepatocyte-like cells in 20 days. While this is suitable for most assays, the length of culture can be extended to improve the maturity of the cells.\nCoating 96-well tissue culture plates with reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix\nPrepare the stock by diluting the matrix to 2 mg/mL with ice-cold sterile DMEM/F12 tissue culture medium. Divide the matrix into 250 μL aliquots and store at -80 ˚C until required. Chill 10 mL of DMEM/F12 on ice for 30 min. Retrieve a 250 μL aliquot of 2 mg/mL matrix stock and thaw on ice.\nCombine the matrix with 10 mL of cold DMEM/F12 by mixing gently using a pre-chilled pipette to make final concentration of 0.05 mg/mL.",
    "Transfer 100 μL of diluted matrix to each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate. Incubate at 37 ˚C, 4% O2/5% CO2 for at least 1 h. Discard the matrix and replace with 50 μL of M-medium per well. Store at 37 °C, 4% O2/5% CO2 until needed.\nPlate cells for differentiation\nCulture the iPSCs on 100-mm plates until the cells approach 80% confluence. Ensure that the plate contains around 2 x 107 cells. Determine cell numbers by cell flow cytometer or hemocytometer.\nNote: With experience, the quality of the iPSCs cells can be judged by microscopy; however, close to 98% of the cells should express pluripotency markers such as the TRA-1-60 epitope when measured by FACS or immunostaining. It is important that the cells remain actively dividing and are not overgrown.\nTo harvest the iPSCs from each 100-mm plate, aspirate the culture medium and rinse with 5 mL of DPBS (-). Replace the rinse with 3 mL of cell detachment solution (e.g., accutase) and incubate for around 2 min at 37 °C, 4% O2/5% CO2.\nNote: It is important to follow the detachment of cells by microscopy. Do not over digest with accutase. The goal is to release the cells as small clusters with minimal treatment.\nAs soon as the cells begin to detach, harvest by adding 7 mL of the M-medium. Pipette several times to dissociate the cell colonies into small clusters of around 3 - 6 cells (Figure 1A).\nCollect the iPSCs into a 15-mL sterile centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 5 mL M-medium.",
    "Evenly distribute the cells onto 96-well matrix-coated plates by pipetting 50 μL of suspension cells into each well. To set up each 96-well plate, use one 100-mm plate of iPSCs with cells at approximately 80% confluency which contains around 5 x 106 cells to setup the differentiation. Use a multichannel pipette to speed up this process. Culture the cells overnight at 37 ˚C, 4% O2/5% CO2.\nNote: It is important that an equal number of cells is deposited into each well to ensure reproducible differentiations.\nInduce differentiation of the cells\nExamine the 96-well plates by microscopy to ensure that cells cover at least 70% of the surface of each individual well. If the coverage is less than 70%, replace the medium with fresh medium and incubate for an additional 24 h at 37 ˚C, 4% O2/5% CO2.\nNote: Incubating cells for more than 48 h after plating without inducing differentiation commonly reduces the efficiency of differentiation. Differentiation will also occur using ambient oxygen, although the efficiency may be affected.\nFor Day 1 to Day 2 of differentiation, replace the culture medium with RPMI supplemented with 2% B27 (without insulin), 100 ng/mL Activin A, 10 ng/mL BMP4, and 20 ng/mL FGF2. Add 100 μL of medium per well and incubate at 37 ˚C, in ambient O2/5% CO2 with a daily medium change for 2 days.\nNote: Dealing with large numbers of 96-well plates require the use of an assisted pipette or robot. 12-channel and 96-channel pipettes are ideal for daily medium change.\nFor Day 3 to Day 5 of differentiation, replace the culture medium with RPMI supplemented with 2% B27 (without insulin) and 100 ng/mL Activin A. Culture cells at 37 ˚C, in ambient O2/5% CO2 with daily medium change for 3 days.",
    "At differentiation day 5, before replacing with fresh culture medium, treat each well with 100 μL 0.02% EDTA solution for 30 s, then remove and replace with fresh culture medium.\nNote: If the differentiation to endoderm is efficient, the monolayer of differentiating cells is prone to peeling from the plate. A brief treatment with 0.02% EDTA solution helps alleviate cell detachment. This treatment does not impact the differentiation to hepatocytes.\nFor differentiation between Days 6 to 10, replace the culture medium with RPMI/ 2% B27 (with insulin) supplemented with 20 ng/mL BMP4 and 10 ng/mL FGF2 and incubate at 37 ˚C, 4% O2/5% CO2 for 5 days with daily medium change. This stage induces cells to differentiate into hepatic progenitor cells.\nFor differentiation between Days 11 to 15, replace the culture medium with RPMI/ 2% B27 (with insulin) supplemented with 20 ng/mL HGF. Incubate at 37 ˚C, 4% O2/5% CO2 for 5 days with daily medium change.\nFor differentiation between Days 16 to 20, replace the culture medium with a hepatocyte cell culture medium (HCM) supplemented with 20 ng/mL of Oncostatin-M (OSM). Incubate the cells at 37 ˚C, in ambient O2/5% CO2 with daily medium change for 5 days.\nNote: The reproducibility of differentiation between individual wells can efficiently be determined by measuring the relative level of Albumin, AFP, or APOB secreted into the medium by ELISA (see 3.2).\n3. Small Molecule Screening",
    "Note: The following describes the procedure used to identify compounds that can be used to lower the level of APOB in the medium of hepatocyte-like cells derived from familial hypercholesterolemia iPSCs. A description of the model and its use in the identification of cholesterol lowering drugs has been described in detail previously5,9. In the current example, 1,000 compounds from the South Carolina Compound Collection (SC3) library were screened. Each compound was tested at a concentration of 2 μg/mL.\nTreatment of iPSC - derived hepatocytes with small molecules\nDilute the master compound library to generate plates of working stocks with compounds at a concentration of 20 μg/mL in 2% DMSO and store at -20 ˚C.\nPrepare enough 96-well plates of iPSC-derived hepatocytes to allow each compound to be tested.\nNote: The number of compounds to be screened will dictate the number of 96-well plates that are required. In general, a single well should be prepared for each compound, plus additional wells for any control samples. The outermost wells of the plate are commonly avoided to reduce the possibility of edge effects that can corrupt interpretation. Hits can be identified using the z- score method without the need to use replicates. If replicates are included, it is more appropriate to use the t test.\nAt the completion of differentiation (day 20, see 2.3.7), replace the culture medium with 100 μL of fresh HCM supplemented with 20 ng/mL of Oncostatin-M. Incubate at 37 ˚C, 4% O2/5% CO2 for exactly 24 h. Retrieve the culture medium into a fresh 96-well plate and store at -20 ˚C. Use this sample to calculate the level of APOB in the medium before the addition of drug.",
    "Add 90 μL of fresh HCM supplemented with 20 ng/mL of Oncostatin-M into each well. Add 10 μL of each compound from the working stock after mixing by pipetting. Add DMSO to 0.2% to control wells to match the final concentration in the treated samples and incubate at 37 ˚C, ambient O2/5% CO2 for exactly 24 h. Collect the culture medium and store at -20 ˚C. Use this sample to determine the level of APOB after treatment with compounds.\nOptional - the remaining cells can be processed for immunostaining, cell viability, or analyses of mRNA levels using standard approaches.\nNote: This screen was designed to identify drugs that had a rapid effect on APOB levels. However, depending on the disease model, downstream assays, or mechanism of drug action, it may be beneficial to treat the sample for multiple days.\nDetermine APOB levels by ELISA\nDetermine Apolipoprotein B (APOB) concentration from both the pre- and post-drug treated samples using a human APOB ELISA development kit following the manufacturer's protocols.\nPreparing the following solutions\nWash buffer, composed of 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4. Store at 4 ˚C until use.\nIncubation buffer, composed of 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, pH 7.4. Store at 4 ˚C until use.\nPrepare APOB (mAB 20/17) antibody by diluting to 2 µg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4. Add 100 μL of the diluted antibody per well and incubate at 4 ˚C overnight.\nRemove the antibody from the assay plates and wash each well twice with 200 μL of PBS, pH 7.4.\nAdd 200 μL/well of 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, pH 7.4 and incubate on a shaking platform for 1 h at room temperature.",
    "Prepare an 8-point standard curve using 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4 with the following concentrations of APOB: 300 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 175 ng/mL, 150 ng/mL, 125 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 75 ng/mL, and 50 ng/mL.\nDilute the test samples 1:4 with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4.\nAfter 1 h of blocking with incubation buffer, discard the buffer and wash the assay plates five times with 200 μL of 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4.\nCompletely remove any residual washing buffer and transfer 90 μL of the diluted samples and the APOB standards to the assay plates. Incubate at room temperature on a shaker for 1 h.\nDiscard the sample and wash with 200 μL 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4 per well. Repeat the washes a total of 5 times. Add 100 μL per well of mAB LDL 11-biotin diluted 1:1,000 in 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4. Incubate at room temperature on a shaking platform for 1 h.\nDiscard the reagent and wash with 200 μL per well washing buffer 5 times. Add 100 μL per well of Streptavidin-HRP antibody (1:1,000 dilution using incubation buffer), then incubate at room temperature on a shaking platform for 1 h.\nDiscard the reagent and wash with 200 μL 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4 per well. Repeat the washes a total of 5 times. Completely remove the residual washing buffer from the assay plates and add 100 μL per well of Tetramethylbenzidin (TMB) substrate solution, and incubate at room temperature for 8 min.\nWithout removing the TMB substrate, directly add 100 μL per well of stop solution (1N HCl).\nDetermine the absorbance at 450 nm using a plate reader.",
    "A standard curve can be established, using the Four Parameter Logistic Regression method, then used to define the concentration of APOB in each sample10.\nExamine the pre-drug: post-drug ratio of APOB in each sample to identify compounds with the potential to lower APOB levels in the medium.\nSubscription Required.
