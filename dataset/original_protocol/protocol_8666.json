    "All animal procedures carried out for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nova Southeastern University in accord with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th Edition (The National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2011).\n1. Preparing Tissue Sections for Receptor Autoradiography\nUpon sacrifice, harvest fresh brain tissues, and wrap in aluminum foil and place in a -20 °C freezer as soon as possible. To maintain the correct shape, place brains in a brain mold that simulates the inside of the skull, wrap in aluminum foil and place in a - 20 °C freezer. After 30 min, place tissues in a sealable freezer storage bag and move to a -80 °C freezer for long-term storage.\n\t\nObtain the fresh frozen tissue specimen of interest from the -80 °C freezer, and transfer to a cryostat set to a minimum of -10 °C and maximum of -18 °C, to avoid thawing.\nPlace the specimen onto the tissue mount with a glycol and resin-based embedding medium, only embedding a small part of the specimen into the medium. For brain, the brain is mounted vertically to enable sectioning in the coronal plane.\nPlace the tissue mount onto the microtome within the cryostat and firmly tighten in place. Ensure the left and right side of the brain are in the same antero-postero coordinates, and that the dorso-ventral axis is perpendicular to commonly used brain atlases.\nBegin cutting at the desired thickness (20 µm recommended) and thaw mount the sections onto microscope slides in a vertical direction to have a greater surface area of space in the slide. Collect sections onto slides in sequential sets of five, i.e. the first set of slides are labelled 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5 (Figure 3).",
    "After filling a set of slides with sections, allow slides to air dry for up to 1 hr, then place the slides in a plastic slide box in a self-sealing freezer storage bag, and store at -20 °C.\n2. Receptor Autoradiography\nCAUTION: Radioactivity. Use protective attire to handle radioactivity. Disposal is depended upon establishment, and must follow guidelines to properly decay (half-life 60 days) or be picked up by a certified company. \nRemove the \"-1\" and \"-2\" slides of interest from the -20 °C freezer and mount into slide grips (Figure 5). Mount the \"-1\" slides together for 'non-specific' treatment, and the \"-2\" slides for 'total' treatment. 'Non-specific' jars will contain 10 µM final concentrations of PD123319 an AT2R antagonist, and losartan an AT1R antagonist, in assay medium buffer (AM5) (Table 1), the 'total' binding jars will only contain 10 µM PD123319 in AM5.\nInvert the slide grips to place the slides into the pre-incubation Coplin jars filled with 35-40 ml of AM5, and respective inhibitors for 30 min at room temperature. Start subsequent sets in their pre-incubation bath at 4 min intervals.\nImmediately transfer slides from the pre incubation solution to the incubation slide mailers, containing 10 ml of AM5, plus a predetermined concentration of 125I-SI-Ang II (calculated in Figure 4) with the respective inhibitors, for 60-90 min at room temperature. If there is sufficient radioligand, 10 slides can be placed (back to back) in modified slide grips and incubated with 125I-SI-Ang II in Coplin jars.\nPlace slides back into the slide grips (if needed), blot, and rinse by gently swirling for 1-2 sec in 400 ml of distilled water in two separate containers.\nTransfer the slides sequentially into four Coplin jars containing 35-40 ml of AM5 for exactly 1 min each (as illustrated in Figure 4).",
    "After the last 1 min rinse, gently swirl the sections for 1-2 sec in four changes of ice cold distilled water.\nBlow-dry the slides with cool air (Caution: hot air volatizes the radioactive compound) using four hair dryers set up from different angles for 4 min (Figure 5), until all the sections are dry, then place on a paper towel.\nMount slides with tissues facing up onto a cardboard for apposition to X-ray film using double sided tape.\nMount at least one, 125 Iodine calibration standard slide onto each cardboard (Figure 6).\n\tNote: Calibration standards consist of brain paste thoroughly mixed with 125Iodine bound to a compound containing a phenol ring, compacted by centrifugation in a 1 ml tuberculin syringe, that are cryostat sectioned at the same thickness as the brain sections and thaw-mounted onto microscope slides. Alternatively, 125I calibration standards in plastic resin sectioned at 20 µm thickness can be obtained commercially. The plastic resin in these standards partially shields the film from the radiation such that a tissue equivalency of ~40% should be factored into the calibration.\n3. Film Exposure and Development\nProceed to a darkroom with a strap-back X-ray cassette and autoradiography film. Open the cassette and place the cardboard with slides inside (Figure 6).\n\t\nTurn the lights off and turn on the safelight. Carefully open the box of X-Ray film, remove one film, and place the film shiny side up (with the jagged edge on the bottom right corner) on top of the slides in the cassette. Carefully close the cassette, and twist the locking bars to seal out light (Figure 6). Expose the slides for several days to several weeks at -20 °C.\nIn the darkroom, open the cassette and proceed with the film developing process.",
    "Place the slides into the trays consecutively; developer for 2 min, water containing 5% glacial acetic acid for 30 sec, and fixer for 5 min. The films are the placed into a tray with running water for 20 min, then placed into Photoflo for no more than 10 sec and hung.\n\t\tNote: The exposure time is determined empirically and can involve multiple films with different exposure times: long enough to obtain measurable signals from areas with low binding, but not so long as to saturate the film by areas with high binding. Once acceptable exposures are obtained, then proceed to the next step.\n4. Histology\nPrepare the thionin stain and staining reagents (Table 2, Figure 7).\n\t\nPlace the \"-3\" slides in the slide rack, and transfer in sequential order beginning with deionized water for 1 min, then thionin stain solution for 10 min followed by three dips into deionized waters, and one 30 sec wash in deionized water.\nFollowing the water, place the slide rack into ethanol washes as follows; 50%, 70%, and 90% for 30 sec, followed by two ethanol washes at 100% for 1 min each. Lastly, place the slide rack into xylene for 3 min, then transfer over to a second xylene solution for 5 min.\nRemove one slide at a time from the last xylene bath, and cover the upper edge of the slide with a resin base in organic solvent mounting medium, and place a 24 mm x 60 mm coverslip onto the slide. Allow slides to sufficiently dry for ~48 hr and then scan into the computer at 2,400 dpi grayscale.\n5. Densitometric Image Analysis",
    "Place the film shiny side down, with the jagged edge on the bottom left corner and scan using a proprietary scanner capable of transmitting the film density information without any distortion in the imaging system computer.\nOpen the proprietary imaging system and utilize the calibration bars to establish calibration standards for future densitometric analysis of the images on the film (Figures 9-12).\nMeasure areas of interest by either establishing a template or empirically outlining the areas of interest. Data is the collected and separated based on film, either control or wild type (section), and region. Make sure to include density (fmol/g), scan area, and total target area in measurements (Figure 9).\n\t\nAdjust scan area bars by assuring that region of interest falls between parameters of highlighting (Figure 10).\nExport data into a spreadsheet (Table 4). Multiply the density times the total target area, then divide by the scan area in order to obtain the value for the binding of that specific area. Once this is done to all values measured, substrate the established non-specific from total to yield the specific binding present. Averages may also be performed for these values.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
