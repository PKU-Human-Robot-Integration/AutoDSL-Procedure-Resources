    "NOTE: Please refer to the Table of Materials for specific reagents and equipment used in this protocol.\n1. Virus Production and Cell Infection\nCAUTION: Infectious HIV-1 should only be handled in approved biosafety containment laboratories.\nNOTE: Production of HIV-1 particles by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, as outlined in step 1.1, is a standard procedure and has been described previously15,16. General cell culture procedures are described previously17.\nHIV-1 virus production.\n\t\nMaintain 293T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (full DMEM) in a standard cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as described previously17.\nIn a standard laminar flow tissue culture hood remove the growth media and add 3 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) trypsin to a near-confluent 10 cm cell culture dish (~1.2 x 107 cells) of 293T cells. Put the dish back in the incubator for 2-3 min.\nTake the dish from the incubator back into the tissue culture hood and add 7 mL of full medium. Pipette up and down within the dish several times to resuspend the cells. Split the cells 1:4 by adding 2.5 mL of the cell suspension to a new 10 cm dish and fill it with 7.5 mL of full medium.\nThe next day, mix 10 µg of proviral HIV-1 plasmid DNA (such as pNL4.3) with 1 mL of serum-free minimal essential medium and add polyethylenimine (PEI) solution (25,000 mW, 1 mg/mL pH 7) at 4.5 µL per 1 µg DNA. Incubate for 10 min at RT and add dropwise to the 293T cells.",
    "24 h after transfection, remove the medium and replace it with 6 mL of full DMEM containing RNase-free DNase at 20 U/mL medium. After 6 h, replace the medium with 10 mL of full DMEM.\n48 h after transfection, harvest the supernatant and filter it through a 0.22 µm filter, using a 10 mL syringe, into a 15 mL polypropylene tube.\nAdd 2 mL of sterile 20% sucrose in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to an open-top thin-walled ultracentrifuge tube. Slowly overlay the sucrose with the filtered cell supernatant.\nCentrifuge for 1 h 15 min at 134,000 x g at 4 °C using an ultracentrifuge.\nRemove the tubes from the ultracentrifuge carefully. Slowly take off both the supernatant and sucrose using a suction or a pipette. Use a smaller pipette and tilt the tube when taking the last sucrose solution out. Leave the pelleted virus in the bottom of the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The pellet will not be visible.\nAdd 200 µL of 1x PBS, leave in the fridge for 4 to 12 h, resuspend, and freeze in 20 µL aliquots at -80 °C.\nDetermine p24Gag content using the a p24 HIV-1 antigen ELISA kit (following manufacturer's instructions).\nT-cell line infection.\n\t\nCulture an immortalized T-cell line (e.g., CEM-SS cells) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (full RPMI). Count the cells using a hemocytometer18 and seed 1 well per sample with 1 mL of full RPMI with 2 x 106 cells/mL in a 12-well format cell culture plate.\nAdd HIV-1 particles equivalent to 150 ng p24Gag and place the plate into a swinging centrifuge bucket with biocontainment lids to spin-infect by centrifugation in a benchtop centrifuge for 2 h at 2,000 x g at 30 °C.",
    "Remove plate from the centrifuge and let it rest for 1 h in a standard tissue culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nTo wash off input virus, collect cells by transferring the cell suspensions to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuging in a microcentrifuge at RT (RT) at 500 x g for 2 min. Take off the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 1 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C), sterile 1x PBS. Repeat the centrifugation, supernatant removal, and resuspension steps two more times.\nCentrifuge again, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets in 1 mL of full RPMI. Add each suspension to one well in a new 12 well plate.\nAt 6 h post-initial addition of virus (4 h post-centrifugation), harvest the cells by centrifugation as done in step 1.2.4. Remove and discard the supernatant. The cell pellets can be frozen at -80 °C or processed directly for DNA extraction.\n2. DNA extraction, HIV-1 DNA Quantification, and Enrichment by Hybrid Capture\nExtract whole cell DNA with a blood and tissue total DNA extraction kit by following the kit manual for tissue culture cells. The only change is elution in 200 µL of nuclease-free H2O instead of the provided elution buffer.\n\tNOTE: After addition of the chaotropic lysis buffer (the kit's \"AL buffer\") and proteinase, samples can be removed from the biosafety containment laboratory and handled in a standard safety level laboratory for the rest of the protocol.\nDetermine the copy number of HIV-1 cDNA by qPCR.\n\t\nTake 17 µL of the eluate from step 2.1 and add 2 µL of 10x restriction enzyme buffer together with 1 µL of DpnI restriction enzyme. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C to remove any potential residual input plasmid DNA from transfection.",
    "Carry out qPCR for minus-strand strong-stop cDNA using the following primer probe set: oHC64 (5′-taactagggaacccactgc-3′) and oHC65 (5′-gctagagattttccacactg-3′) and probe oHC66 (5′-FAM- acacaacagacgggcacacacta-TAMRA-3′). qPCR setup and exact conditions can be found in the references6,13. Carry along samples with a serial dilution of pNL4.3 proviral plasmid as a standard curve to determine copy numbers of cDNA molecules.\n\t\tNOTE: See discussion for expected quantities.\nHIV-1 DNA enrichment by hybrid capture.\n\tNOTE: From this step forward, it is preferable to use microcentrifuge tubes with low nucleic acid binding properties as well as aerosol filter pipette tips for all DNA samples. If possible, work in a PCR workstation. All steps and reagents are at RT (RT) unless otherwise stated.\n\t\nTo prepare a master mix of magnetic streptavidin beads, pipette 100 µL beads per sample into a single microcentrifuge tube. Place the tube on a magnet suitable for microcentrifuge tubes.\nAfter the beads have settled towards the magnet side of the tube (~1 min), take off the storage buffer, remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend beads in 500 µL of bind and wash buffer (BW buffer, 5 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) to wash.\nPlace the tube back on magnet, remove the supernatant and add 500 µL casein solution. Take of the magnet, resuspend and incubate for 10 min at RT, then wash with BW buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: A wash refers to placing the tube on the magnet, taking off the supernatant, taking the tube off the magnet, adding the buffer, and resuspending.",
    "Place tube back on the magnet, take off the supernatant and resuspend beads in 500 µL of BW buffer. Add 50 pmol of each capturing biotinylated oligonucleotides (see Table 1, three oligos in this case) per sample. (For example, if 5 DNA samples are to be processed, use 500 µL of magnetic beads from step 2.3.1 and 250 pmol of each oligonucleotide).\nIncubate for 30 min at RT while rocking in an end-over-end mixer.\nWash beads with the immobilized oligonucleotides two times with 500 µL of 1x TEN buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl).\nResuspend beads in 10 µL of 1x TEN buffer per sample.\nFor each sample label one microcentrifuge tube and add 10 µL of beads suspension, 170 µL of DNA (from step 2.1) and 90 µL of 3x TEN buffer. Incubate in a dry heat block at 92 °C for 2 min to denature the DNA.\nMove the tubes to a different dry heat block, which is set to 52 °C, and incubate for 1 h. Invert to mix regularly (~every 10 min) during this incubation.\nWash once with 500 µL of 1x TEN buffer and resuspend in 35 µL nuclease-free H2O.\nTo elute, incubate the tubes at 92 °C in a dry heat block for 2 min. Then, quickly move the tubes onto the magnet (one tube at a time). Once beads are bound to the side of the tube, transfer the supernatant containing the HIV-1 DNA to a fresh tube.\nOptional: Repeat qPCR (as done in step 2.2.2) to determine the recovered HIV-1 cDNA.\n\t\tNOTE: See discussion for expected quantities.\n3. Adaptor Ligation\nPreparing the adaptor\n\t\nResuspend lyophilized adaptor (see Table 1 \"full Kwok + MiSeq\") at 100 µM in nuclease-free H2O.",
    "Per sample plus one control sample, combine 0.45 µL of 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer, 4 µL of adaptor, and 0.05 µL of nuclease-free H2O. Heat to 92 °C for 2 min and let each cool down slowly.\n\t\tNOTE: If the option is available use a PCR machine with adjustable cooling rate (use 2% rate). This takes about 30 min from 92 °C to 16 °C. Alternatively, use a dry heat block at 92 °C and turn off. Take the adaptor mastermix out when the heat block is back at RT. This is to let the adaptor form a hairpin structure (see Figure 2b).\nPrepare a control reaction with a set of synthesized oligonucleotides (see Table 2) instead of DNA extracted from cells.\n\t\nMake stocks of 100 µM of each oligonucleotide. Mix 1 µL of each of the 17 oligonucelotides and add 8 µL of H2O for an equimolar ratio in a final volume of 25 µL.\nDilute the mix 1:2,500 in nuclease-free H2O in a serial dilution. Combine 1 µL of the mix with 17.3 µL of nuclease-free H2O to use in the control sample ligation in step 3.3.1 so that each oligonucleotide is present at 1.6 fmol (equivalent to 0.026 nM in the 60 µL reaction).\nSetting up ligations\n\t\nFor 60 µL final volume reactions in PCR tubes combine 6 µL of 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer, 24 µL of 40% PEG, 6 µL of 5 M betaine, 4.5 µL (400 pmol) of adaptor (pre-annelead as in step 3.1.2), 1.2 µL of T4 DNA ligase (2,000,000 Units/mL) and 18.3 µL of DNA (from step 2.3.11)\n\t\tNOTE: Take special care with viscous solutions such as 40 % PEG to maintain accurate volumes. Do not make a mastermix.",
    "Set up the same reaction as performed in step 3.3.1 but with the control oligonucleotide mix prepared in step 3.2.2.\nMix the reactions well and incubate in a PCR machine at 16 °C overnight.\n4. Adaptor Removal and Size Separation\nDenaturing gel electrophoresis\n\t\nAdd 30 µL of formamide-containing DNA gel loading buffer to each ligation reaction. Mix well by pipetting.\nHeat for 2 min at 94 °C in PCR machine, then immediately put on ice.\nPlace a precast 6% Tris/borate/EDTA (TBE) denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel (10-well comb) in an appropriate gel tank. Add 1x TBE (89 mM Tris-base, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) running buffer and pre-run the gel for 20 min at 250 V/max constant.\nWash out the gel pockets with running buffer using a syringe and 21G needle.\nLoad each 90 µL sample into three wells (30 µL per well) and run for 20 min (250 V/max) until the dark-blue dye front is about halfway through the gel.\nStaining and cutting nucleic acids from the gel\n\t\nPrepare 3 small microcentrifuge tubes (0.5 mL) per sample by poking holes into the bottom using a 21 G syringe needle (take caution while working with sharps). Insert each of the prepared tubes into a 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube and label them with the sample name plus \"low\", \"mid\" or \"high\".\nTake out and pry open the gel cassette. Cut the gel vertically with a razor blade to generously excise the strip with the 3 wells of loaded samples. Add the gel strip to a container with 1x TBE (about 30 mL) and 5 µL of cyanine nucleic acid stain. Incubate for 3-5 min.",
    "NOTE: The gel extraction step is particularly sensitive to cross-contamination. It is advisable to only run 1 sample per gel and using a separate, clean container for each gel staining. Gloves should be changed if gel particles contact gloved fingers.\nClean the surface of a blue light transilluminator thoroughly with ddH2O. Take the gel piece out of the staining container and add it to the light box.\nTurn on the light box and inspect the stained nucleic acids through the orange filter.\n\t\tNOTE: The adaptor typically appears overloaded and runs as big \"blob\" with ligated HIV-1 DNA running above as a streak.\nUsing a new razor blade, cut away the sides of the gel if there are areas with no sample loaded still present. Next, cut just above the adaptor to remove the adaptor and lower gel parts. Finally, cut away the very top of the gel including about 1 mm of the gel pockets, which often have a sharp intense signal of higher molecular weight DNA.\nDivide the remaining gel piece containing the sample, which is typically ~2 x 3 cm in size, horizontally into three even pieces: \"low\", \"mid\" and \"high\" molecular weight areas.\n\t\tNOTE: Each piece will now be handled separately [i.e., there will be three tubes (low, mid, and high)] per original sample.\nCut each of the three gel fragments into smaller pieces (~2 x 2 mm particles) and transfer them into the prepped 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (step 4.2.1).\nSpin at top speed with open lids for 1 min to squeeze the gel pieces through the hole into the 2 mL tube to create a gel slush. If any gel particles remain in the bottom of the 0.5 mL tube, transfer them to the 2 mL tube manually using a needle or pipette tip.",
    "DNA extraction\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of urea gel extraction buffer (0.5 M NH4CH3CO2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS) to the gel slush. Rotate tubes for a minimum of 3 h (overnight is acceptable) at RT with an end-over-end mixer.\nUse a clean set of tweezers to add one small round glass fiber filter to centrifuge columns with cellulose acetate membrane filters (0.2 µm), which avoids membrane clogging. Put the filter in place with an inverted pipette tip.\nBriefly spin the 2 mL tubes with gel slush and extraction buffer in a microcentrifuge and transfer 700 µL of the supernatant to the prepared filter columns. Keep the gel slush and remaining supernatant.\nCentrifuge the filter columns in a microcentrifuge at top speed for 1 min. Transfer the flowthrough into a new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nReload the columns with the remaining supernatant. Try to obtain as much liquid as possible from the extraction slush. Transfer of gel pieces is not a concern. Spin again and combine flowthroughs of the same extraction samples.\nDNA precipitation\n\t\nAdd 3 µL of polyA RNA (1 µg/µL; as a carrier), 1 µL of glycogen, and 0.7 mL of isopropanol to the flowthrough from step 4.3.5. Vortex briefly and freeze at -80 °C overnight.\nTake samples out of the -80 °C freezer and let them thaw briefly. Put them in a cooled (4 °C) microcentrifuge and spin for 30 min at top speed.\nRemove and discard the supernatant. Be very careful not to remove the pellet. Leave 30 to 50 µL of liquid if it is uncertain that pellet would be removed otherwise.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically all \"high\" samples show a more visible pellet than \"mid\" and \"low\" samples.",
    "Add 800 µL of 80% ethanol. Invert tubes and spin again for 1 min at top speed. Remove the majority of ethanol with a pipette, briefly spin the tubes again, and remove more ethanol with a smaller volume pipette.\nLet any remaining ethanol evaporate by placing the tubes with an open lid into a 55 °C dry heat block. When samples are dry (2-4 min) add 20 µL of nuclease-free H2O and spread around the bottom of the tube to ensure the DNA pellet is dissolved. The DNA sample can be stored at -20 °C.\n5. PCR Amplification and Library Preparation\nSet up a 40 µL PCR reaction with 20 µL of DNA polymerase pre-mix, 18 µL of precipitated and redissolved DNA from step 4.4.5, 1 µL of forward primer \"MP1.0 + 22HIV\" (10µM) (see Table 1), and 1 µL of multiplex oligo primers (index primers 1 to 24) (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Run the three reactions (low, mid, high) of each sample in separate PCR reactions, but with the same indexed primer. Use a different index for each of the original infection samples.\n\t\nRun the PCR reactions under the following conditions: 2 min at 94 °C denaturation, then 18 cycles of 3-step PCR; 15 s at 94 °C denaturation, 15 s annealing at 55 °C, and 30 s extension at 68 °C.\nAs a quality control option, analyze PCR reactions with high sensitivity automated gel electrophoresis system. Take 2 µL of a low, mid, and high sample to run as per manufacturer's instruction.",
    "NOTE: The two primers should be visible and often run at a calculated length of about 45 and 95 nt (actual length differs). Additionally, DNA should be detected between 150 to 500 nt. If no signal is present, it is advisable to add additional PCR cycles, between 2 and 10 additional cycles. Do not add additional cycles for the oligonucleotide control samples created in step 3.3.2.\nTo remove the primers use a paramagnetic bead-based PCR clean-up system.\n\t\nTake 20 µL of each PCR reaction and pool the samples together (mix all the samples at this point). Freeze the remaining 20 µL reactions as backups at -20 °C.\nLet the paramagnetic beads come to RT and mix the pooled PCR reactions with 1.8x the volume of the bead solution. Mix by pipetting and incubate for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: As an example, if 4 samples were prepared and each have low, mid, and high reactions, the volume would be 4 x 3 x 20 µL = 240 µL PCR reactions with a 432 µL bead solution.\nPut the tubes on a microcentrifuge tube magnet, let the beads bind for ~1 min, and take off the supernatant to discard. Leave the tubes on the magnet and add 500 µL of 80% ethanol.\nLeave the ethanol for 30 s, then take off thoroughly and let the beads airdry for ~5 min. Add 40 µL of nuclease-free H2O, take the tubes off the magnet, and pipette up and down multiple times.\nLeave the suspension for 5 min. Put the tube back on the magnet, let the beads settle to the side, and transfer the supernatant to a new tube. This is the library. Take a 10 µL aliquot for quality controls and freeze the rest at -20 °C.\n6. Evaluating the Library",
    "Determine the library quality, concentration, and molarity.\n\t\nUse a fluorometric quantification method. Measure 1 µL and 3 µL of the library with a high sensitivity dsDNA assay kit as per manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical concentrations are between 1 and 10 ng/µL.\nMeasure the library DNA molecular weight spectrum by high sensitivity automated gel electrophoresis as described above (step 5.2).\nUse the automated gel electrophoresis analysis to determine the average molecular weight of the library and calculate to dilute the library in nuclease-free H2O to 4 nM. Several libraries can be combined as long as all indices are unique.\nOptional low throughput quality control\n\t\nSubject the DNA library to TA cloning19 to insert library molecules into vectors for amplification. Follow the kit's instructions, grow out ~10-20 colonies and extract DNA via miniprep protocols, as described here20.\nSequence vector using local sequencing services and check that the inserts contain the desired HIV-1 derived sequences and library-specific adaptors.\n7. High-Throughput Sequencing Run\nCreate a sequencing sample sheet with the commercial software provided with the sequencing platform.\n\t\nIndicate the selected sequencing kit. Typically, choose a 150-cycle kit, but others are suitable depending on the desired read length.\nSelect \"Fastq only\" as the application workflow. Choose one of the templates that contains the 24 indices present in the multiplex oligonucleotide kits (indicated in kit manual).\nSelect \"25 nt\" for Read1 and \"125 nt\" for Read2. Keep 6 nt for single index read.\n\t\tNOTE: In the in-house analysis only Read2 is used in the analysis. Keep Read1 at a minimum of 25 nt for sequencing platform algorithm purposes.\nFollow manufacturer's instructions precisely for the pre-run library preparation and setup. Opt for the maximum 20 pM concentration and use a 15% PhiX spike, as the library is of very low complexity.\n8. Data Analysis",
    "Check if the pass filter percentage and average Q30 quality score are acceptable as per sequencing platform manufacturer's guidelines.\n\tNOTE: Pass filter is typically > 90% and Q30 scores are typically > 80%.\nDownload the .fastq.gz files from the manufacturer's sequencing hub.\nSetting up the sequencing script\n\t\nCreate a new directory (folder) named \"AnalysisXYZ\" and go to https://github.com/malimlab/seqparse to download all source code files (parse_sam.pl, rc_extract.pl, parse.sh) into this directory.\nDownload the short-read aligner Bowtie, version 1.1.2, from http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml into the same directory.\nThe download creates a subdirectory within \"AnalysisXYZ\" named \"Bowtie-1.1.2\". Within this directory open subdirectory \"Indexes\" and download the provided template sequences consisting of 6 files with .ebwt extensions.\nDownload the FASTQ/A short reads pre-processing toolkit fastx-0.0.13 from http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/download.html into the \"AnalysisXYZ\" directory.\nDownload both Samtools (https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/) and bam-readcount (https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount) into the \"Documents\" directory.\nMove the .fastq.gz files, downloaded in step 8.2, of all read 2s (ending in …_R2_001.fastq.gz) into the \"AnalysisXYZ\" directory.\nOpen the command console/terminal. Move to the \"AnalysisXYZ\" as the current directory using cd commands. Type \"./parse.sh .\" to run the scripts.\nFind the .csv files with summaries for all samples on total read counts, length adjusted read counts, and normalizes read counts, as well as files with the base variation, for each sample in a directory named parse_results within the \"Analysis XYZ\" directory.\n\tNOTE: See the discussion for further information about the analysis process. The script returns csv files with total reads for each nucleotide along the HIV-1NL4.3 strong-stop sequences and first strand transfer until nucleotide 635. As a guidance, 50,000 to 100,000 unique reads are typically observed in samples from infections with the indicated cell numbers and viral inocula and without antiviral proteins or compounds. The oligonucleotide control sample usually produces 100,000 to 200,000 reads."
