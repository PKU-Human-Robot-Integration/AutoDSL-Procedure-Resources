    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nPreparation of Single-Cell Suspension from Human Lymph Nodes\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step enzymatically dissociates cells from fresh human lymph nodes.\nImmediately after surgery, transfer human lymph nodes (LNs) into 35 mm dishes filled with 5 ml RPMI on ice and cut into small pieces (around 0.5 mm3 cubes) using fine scalpels.\nAdd LN pieces into 5 ml of the enzyme mix in 15 ml tube and incubate at 37°C in a water bath for 20 min in total and gently invert the tube 2-3 times every 5 min.\nAfter incubation, LN pieces are gently passed through a wide bore tip of a 1 ml pipette. Let fragments settle to the bottom for 30 sec, after which the enzyme mix was removed and added into the 15 ml tubes containing the cold PBS supplemented with 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA (supernatant 1).\nAdd 5 ml of fresh enzyme mix into the tubes with LN fragments and incubate for 10 min at 37°C. Invert the tubes every 5 min.\nAfter the incubation, mix the fragments strongly for 30 sec using a 1 ml pipette equipped with a wide bore tip. Let fragments settle down and remove the supernatant and add it to the new tube containing the cold PBS including 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA (supernatant 2).\nAdd 5 ml of fresh enzyme mix to the tubes with LN fragments and incubate it at 37°C until the fragments were almost completely digested. Mix fragments vigorously every 5 min (usually 5 min x 2-4 times). Combine the dissociated single cell suspension with the supernatant 1 and 2, and centrifuge at 300 g, 4 °C and filter the cells with 100 μm cell strainer and centrifuge it.",
    "Add phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and 10 mM HEPES. Count the cell number. Typical viability at this point is 95%.\nCritical: Use phenol red-free DMEM containing 2% FCS and 10 mM HEPES instead of PBS containing FCS until cell sorting to keep the cell viability high.\nDeplete CD45+ Cells and Sort the Target Stromal Cells with a Cell-Sorter\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step enriches stromal cells via a depletion of hematopoietic cells.\nDeplete CD45+ cells with CD45- negative cell isolation kit by following manufacture’s protocols. Use phenol red-free DMEM during isolation and incubate the cells at 4°C.\nIncubate the CD45- cells with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies including AF488-CD45, PE-podoplanin, APC-CD31 and LIVE/DEAD-Near IR for 30 min at 4oC.\nSort the cell-type of interest using a cell-sorter (e.g. SH800 from Sony) equipped with 100 μm chip. Sort PDPN+CD31+, PDPN-CD31+ or PDPN+CD31- cells for isolation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), blood endothelial cells (BECs) or non-endothelial stromal cells (SCs), respectively. Sort more than 20000 cells if possible into pre-coated 1.5 ml tubes containing 500 μl of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Gate single cells with the FSC-H versus FCS-W plot and the SSC-H versus SSC-W plot to avoid doublets, and exclude dead cells based on LIVE-DEAD dead cell stain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/62-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. LEC Sorting from Human LNs for Single-Cell Analysis\nGating strategy for isolation of LECs from human LNs. CD45+ cells and dead cells are excluded based on CD45 and Live/Dead dead cell stain, respectively. Live single CD45-PDPN+CD31+ are sorted for the single-cell analysis of human LECs. Adopt from Figure S1A of Takeda et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].",
    "Critical: LIVE-DEAD dead cell stain-negative cells should be more than around 80 % of all the cells. Cell viability should be recorded pre and post-sorting (when counting cell number for library preparation) for proper metadata collection (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). If the cell viability is low, final cell number will be low after quality check of scRNA-seq data and minor cell populations will not be detected.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/62-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Viability of Dissociated Human LN Stromal Cell Subsets after Cell Dissociation and Cell Sorting\n(A and B) Viability of CD45+ cells, SCs, BECs and LECs dissociated from human LNs.\n(A) FACS plots. The images are representative of six biological replicates.\n(B) Comparison of viability of dissociated stromal cells and post-sort LECs. Viability of cells after dissociation were counted by FACS and viability of post-sort cells were counted with Trypan blue. The circles in the Violin plot indicate the number of biological replicates (n=6). ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.\nNote: Viability differs between different subsets (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). Stromal cells especially LECs (viability ~80%) are more prone to cell death than CD45+ leukocytes (viability ~95%). Even though live LECs are gated and sorted for scRNA-seq of LECs, viability of post-sort LECs is comparable to that of LECs after cell dissociation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). This indicates that FACS sorting damages stromal cells.\nLibrary Preparation for Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing\nCount cell number and prepare single-cell RNA-sequencing libraries.\nCount sorted human stromal cells manually at least two times. Check the cell-viability with trypan blue and recode it as metadata.\nProcess the samples according to 10X Genomics User Guide.\nPrepare single-cell RNA-sequencing libraries according to the manufacturer’s instruction from 10X Genomics (v2 or v3 chemistry)."
