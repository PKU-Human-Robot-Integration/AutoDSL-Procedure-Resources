    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn vitro methylation assay\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this section we provide a step-by-step in vitro assay to study Tat methylation. This protocol can also be used to assess methylation in other proteins such as histones.\nIn-vitro methylation assay\nEach reaction is performed in a 1.7-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nThe assay can be prepared at 20°C−25°C. To each tube, add 5 μL of freshly prepared 5× SMYD5 methyltransferase buffer.\nAdd desired Tat peptides, proteins or histone substrates.\nNote: Substrates can be any protein or peptide that contains lysines which are subject to methylation. To enable detection by SDS-Page and Coomassie staining use: 2 μg of each Tat peptide, protein or recombinant histone, 2–5 μg of histone peptide, 5–10 μg of core histones, or 5–10 μg of nucleosomes as substrates for the assay.\nAdd 1–2 μg of recombinant SMYD5 methyltransferase to each tube except the no-methyltransferase control reactions.\nCritical: Enzymes are very sensitive to freeze – thaw cycles. Always thaw the methyltransferase on ice and avoid freezing and thawing several times to avoid a reduction in enzymatic activity.\nNote: A negative control reaction without enzyme and positive control reaction using a known methyltransferase is recommended.\nAdd ddH2O to a final volume of 20 μL to each tube.\nCritical: Until this point, the entire reaction can be pipetted together without shielding. However, the next component, 3H-SAM, is radioactive and needs to be added in an area designated for work with radioactive materials. The stock vial of 3H-SAM is stored at ‒20°C. About 30 min before the experiment take the vial out of the freezer and let it thaw at 20°C−25°C behind shielding.\nAdd 2 μL of 3H-SAM stock to each tube.",
    "Critical: From this point, the rest of the experiment needs to be performed in the area designated for work with radioactive materials, such as a RAD-room. All waste needs to be collected and disposed of properly by EH&S. Geiger counters cannot detect 3H. Instead, regular swipe tests using a scintillation counter should be performed to check for 3H contamination.\nCentrifuge for 15 s at 200 × g to collect the reaction at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube.\nIncubate the reactions for 2–18 h at 22°C–37°C.\nNote: Incubations for longer periods and above room temperature (20°C−25°C) should be performed while shaking to reduce condensation at the lid of the tube. The optimal temperature and incubation time is always enzyme dependent. For SMYD5 incubation for 2 hours at 22°C or 32°C was used.\nStop the reaction with 4x Laemmli sample buffer and fractionate it in a 15% SDS-PAGE gel for larger proteins or a 4%–20% Tris-Tricine gel for peptides and histones.\nNote: Store these samples at −20°C for up to one week or ‒80°C for up to 6 months until you are ready for gel analysis.\nGel analysis, Coomassie blue stain, gel drying, and autoradiography\nTiming: 2 h for gel analysis, 1 day for Coomassie blue stain, 2 h to dry the gel, and 1–7 days to expose the film\nIn this section we provide a step-by-step description for gel analysis, Coomassie Blue stain, gel drying and autoradiography.\nGel analysis\nFor gel analysis, run the samples in a 10% or 15% SDS-PAGE gel for larger proteins or a 4%–20% Tris-Tricine gel for peptides and histones at 120 V for about 1–1.5 h.",
    "Note: As peptides and histones can be very small, make sure to not let the dye front run off the gel. The running buffer will be contaminated with 3H-SAM and should be discarded as radioactive waste. The gel box will also be contaminated with 3H-SAM.\nCoomassie Blue stain\nFix the gel for 5 min in Fixing Buffer.\nCover the gel with Coomassie Blue Staining Buffer and incubate for 1–18 h.\nRemove the Coomassie Blue Staining Buffer and incubate the gel with Coomassie Destain Buffer until the substrate bands of interest are visible.\nNote: The gel will destain faster if some clean paper tissue is placed inside the box. Make sure to place the tissue at the edge of the box so the gel does not tear when the box is shaking.\nRemove the gel from the Coomassie Destain Buffer and carefully place it into a Hybri-Bag or any other hard plastic bag.\nTake scans of the bands.\nNote: Scans of the bands can also be taken later of the dry gels. However, incubation with Amersham Amplify solution and Anti-Crack Buffer will destain the gels further and the drying process often cracks the gels. Therefore, it is recommended to take scans of the Coomassie stain at this point. Be careful not to contaminate the scanner with radioactive 3H.\nTake the gel out of the plastic bag and place it into a clean plastic tray.\nTo increase the radioactive signal, incubate the gel in Amersham Amplify solution for 30 min while shaking. Add 10 mL or more to completely cover the gel.\nNote: The Amersham Amplify solution will destain the gel further.\nIncubate the gel in Anti-Crack Buffer for 5 min.\nGel drying\nPlace the gel onto 2 layers of Whatman filter paper and cover it with saran wrap.",
    "Dry the gel on a vacuum gel dryer for 2 h at 60°C.\nRemove the plastic wrap and tape the dried gel inside a Kodak BioMax TranScreen-HE intensifying screen. In the dark, insert one or several Amersham Hyperfilms in an autoradiography cassette and place it at −80°C.\nExpose the film for 12 h or longer.\nNote: The intensity of the radioactive signal will vary depending on the methyltransferase, the substrate and the 3H-SAM. It can take several weeks of incubation at ‒80°C before a signal can be detected."
