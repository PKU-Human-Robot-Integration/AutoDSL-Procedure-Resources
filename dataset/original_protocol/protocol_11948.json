    "1. Preparing Graft Tissues for In Vitro Studies\nNote: Three types of tissues were used: Bovine Pericardium patch (BP), Cryopreserved Homograft (CH) and Bovine Jugular Vein grafts (BJV). In case of BJV conduit and CH (tissue processed by the European Homograft Bank (EHB) and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to use), both the wall and valvular leaflets were used. BP patch and BJV conduit were purchased from the manufacturers. Prior to use, thaw the CH following the EHB instructions12.\nRinse all tissues with 0.9% NaCl prior to use.\nPrepare tissue biopsies using a disposable skin biopsy punch to cut circular tissue pieces (10 mm in diameter).\nCut all tissue patches to the same height using disposable sterile scalpels.\nFor tissues fixed with glutaraldehyde (for example BJV conduit), incubate graft pieces overnight at 4 °C with 200 g/L of human albumin to neutralize the fixative.\nWash out residues of glutaraldehyde with 0.9% NaCl in a microtiter plate.  Repeat 3 times for 1 minute.\n2. Preparing Bacteria for Perfusion Experiments\nNote: Three bacterial isolates were used: S. aureus Cowan (ATCC 12598), S. epidermidis ATCC 149900 and S. sanguinis NCTC 7864. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were grown at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth (TSB) and S. sanguinis was grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in brain heart infusion broth (BHI).\nPrepare overnight culture of bacteria on a solid blood agar plate.\n\t\nUse a sterile loop to scrape the frozen bacteria off and inoculate onto a Mueller-Hinton blood agar plate for overnight culture at 37 °C.\nUse a sterile inoculation loop to pick up a single colony from the overnight blood agar culture and inoculate into 10 mL of TSB or BHI in a 14 mL tube and culture overnight at 37 °C.",
    "Centrifuge overnight cultures (3000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min) and resuspend the pellets in 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Place 14 mL tubes on ice.\nPrepare an aliquot of 3.7 mg/mL solution of 5(6)-carboxy-fluorescein N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester (CF) in ethanol and store at -20 °C. Further dilute the stock of CF to 150 µg/mL using 'ultrapure' water.\n\tNote: Protect tubes from light using aluminum foil and store at -20 °C.\nCentrifuge the bacteria (3000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min) and resuspend the pellets in 800 µL of PBS and add 200 µL of the 150 µg/mL CF solution (final concentration of 30 µg/mL used for perfusion experiments). Protect tubes from light with aluminum foil and incubate for 30 min using an orbital shaker.\nAfter labeling, block with 2% of bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution in PBS and spin (3000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min). Follow with a wash step using 10 mL of PBS and pellet bacteria by centrifugation (3000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min).\nDilute bacteria with PBS to obtain 107 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (verified by CFU counting on Mueller-Hinton blood agar plates), which corresponds to an OD600 (optical density) of 0.65. Keep the tubes in the dark on ice prior to perfusion experiments.\n\tNote. Keep in mind that OD600 measurements reflect the approximate number of bacteria. To count the effective inoculation dose, the serial dilution method is an additional necessary step to verify the OD based numbers as described in section 3.8.\n3. In vitro Perfusion Experiments using a Parallel-Plate Flow Chamber\nMount tissue biopsies of 10 mm in diameter and the same thickness (prepared in the steps 1.1 - 1.5) into a flow chamber system with the inner surface facing up to get in contact with the bacterial suspension.",
    "Note: The same tissue thickness across various grafts ensures that the same tissue height is reached in the channel allowing laminar flow in all conditions. All elements of the flow chamber are presented and described in Figure 1.\n\t\nTo begin the protocol, place the round tissue piece between a microscope slide with an 8 mm circular perforation and a rubber gasket.\n\t\tNote: The microscope slide possesses the ultra-thin bottom film to allow the generation of the 8 mm hole. Together with the rubber sheet, it fixes the tissue to enable the direct contact between the specimen and the flowing medium and also prevents the dislocation of the biopsy during the experiment. The surface of the investigated tissue, which is exposed to the flow (smaller diameter) cannot be manipulated by the forceps.\nInsert the holder with the tissue into the gasket sheet that is embedded in the bottom metal frame of the chamber. \nAttach the upper metal frame with the corresponding gasket sheet onto the bottom part of the chamber with the previously inserted tissue holder. Subsequently mount the entire chamber with eight screws and screw nuts. Make sure that the chamber height is always the same across grafts.\n\t\tNote: The chamber height should be determined always upon tightening the screws. Use a caliper or ruler.\nConnect the flow chamber with a peristaltic pump and the fluid reservoir with the tubes.\nPerfuse the tissues with suspensions of 107 CFU/mL (verified by CFU counting and related to OD600 measurements) fluorescently-labeled bacteria in PBS with a shear stress of 3 dyne/cm2 (dyne per square centimeter pressure unit) by means of the peristaltic pump (flow rate 4 mL/min) for 1 h using a 400 mL bacterial reservoir (In-house design, Figure 1) conditioned at 37 °C using a plate thermostat (Table of Materials).",
    "Recirculate continuously the 100 mL bacterial suspension using the same collection reservoir.\nAfter perfusion, dismantle the chamber to release the graft and wash the tissue piece two times with 4 mL of PBS in a 12-well plate using the laboratory orbital shaker for 3 min each. Subsequently cut the inner part of the graft using a skin biopsy punch of a smaller diameter.\nPlace each tissue biopsy into a separate 14 mL tube containing 1 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl. Label the tube as #1.\nDetach the bacteria from the tissue using a sonication bath for 10 min (amplitude = 100% and frequency = 45 kHz).\n\tNote: Full detachment of bacteria from the tissue grafts should be evaluated upon incubation of patches overnight at 37 °C in TSB liquid medium followed by OD600 measurements compared to control patches treated with a bacteria free solution.\nUse a serial dilution method on Mueller-Hinton blood agar plates to count CFUs.\n\t\nPrepare a single 14 mL tube with 10 mL of sterile saline to make serial dilutions of the bacterial suspension obtained after sonication. Label this tube as #2.\n\t\tNote: For each tissue experiment one tube with 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl is necessary.\nPrepare three 14 mL tubes with 10 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl for serial dilutions of initial bacterial suspension from step 2.7. Label the tubes as follows #3, #4, #5.\n\t\tNote: This step is necessary to know the real CFU number in bacterial suspension used for the perfusion experiment.\nVortex mix each tube for 15 s. Vortex the tubes with the tissue biopsy as well as the initial bacterial suspension to make serial dilutions.",
    "Prepare three agar plates, two for the tissue experiment (perfusion of bacteria and control perfusion of PBS) and the third one for the initial bacterial suspension used for perfusions.\nLabel three sectors per plate for the tissue experiment in the following manner 10-1, 10-3 and 10-4. To count the number of CFUs in the bacterial perfusates, label the plate as follows: 10-1, 10-3, 10-5 and 10-7.\n\t\tNote: All indications on agar plates such as 10-1, 10-3 and so on refer to the final number of CFU/mL calculated on the next day. Control plate does not require any sectors. Before use, blood agar plates should be placed under the laminar hood and opened to remove excess moisture.\nTo continue preparing the serial dilutions, transfer 100 µL of tube #1 to tube #2 and mix vigorously with vortex.\nSpread 100 µL of the contents of tube #1 and #2 onto the corresponding sectors 10-1 and 10-3 of the agar plate. Likewise, spread 10 µL of tube #2 on the sector 10-4, repeat this step 4 times to obtain 4 separate growths from each volume of 10 µL.\n\t\tNote: Due to the small volume used for plating onto the sector 10-4, it is advised to have multiple number of droplets to make an average number of grown CFUs.\nTo prepare the serial dilutions of the initial culture, transfer 100 µL of bacterial suspension from step 2.7 to tube #3 and mix vigorously with vortex. Add 100 µL of tube #3 to tube #4 and mix well, repeat the procedure for subsequent tube #5.\nSpread 100 µL of the contents of tubes #3, #4, #5 and the adjusted bacterial suspension (step 2.7), respectively, onto sectors 10-3, 10-5, 10-7 and 10-1 of the blood agar plate.",
    "Leave the blood agar plates in the laminar hood to air dry the bacterial spreads, typically for 10 minutes. Afterwards, place the plates at 37 °C for overnight incubation.\nAfter overnight incubation, count the bacterial colonies to obtain the number of CFUs resulting from the adhesion to the tissue biopsies as well as CFUs/mL in the starting bacterial suspension used for the perfusion. Express results as CFU/cm2.\n4. Fluorescence Microscopy of Adhered Bacteria to Graft Tissues upon Perfusion\nAfter perfusion, wash tissue pieces with PBS (see step 3.5) and cut the inner part of a graft using a punch of a smaller diameter.\nPrepare a 6-well plate and place droplets of mounting medium (Table of Materials).\nPlace each piece of tissue with its perfused surface downward on a single drop of mounting medium.\nRead a plate using a fluorescence scanner (Table of Materials). Set parameters of excitation and emission wavelengths according to a fluorophore used for bacterial labeling.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
