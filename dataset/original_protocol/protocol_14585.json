  "procedures": [
    "1. Cell Culture\nSeed 3x105 HUVEC cells in 10 ml of complete growth medium10 in a 75 cm flask.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 to 70-80% confluence.\n2. Tubule Formation Assay\nThaw either the growth factor-reduced (GFR) extracellular matrix or normal extracellular matrix overnight on ice at 4 °C.\n\tNote: For the sake of brevity 'extracellular matrix' will henceforth be used to reference both GFR and normal extracellular matrix. The process to prepare them is identical.\nKeep 96-well culture plates on ice, and add 50 µl of chilled extracellular matrix per well using pre-cooled tips. Prepare triplicate of 5 wells containing only the normal extracellular matrix. Prepare another triplicate of 5 wells containing only GFR extracellular matrix.\nIncubate the 96-well plate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nWash the HUVECs once with phosphate-buffered solution without calcium and magnesium (PBS), and add 1 ml 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Incubate the dish at 37 °C for 1-5 min, checking the cells every minute until most cells round up. Dislodge the cells by tapping the flask once.\n\t\nAdd 5 ml basal medium (i.e., endothelial cell growth medium without anything (e.g., supplements) added) with 1% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Collect the cells in the flask by pipetting and transfer to a 15 ml tube. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend with 2 ml basal medium, count the cells using a hemocytometer, and adjust the cell concentration to 2-3 x 105 cells/ml.\nPrepare 100 µl of the following 10x concentrations of CXCR2 inhibitor SB225002 in basal medium: 11 µM, 5.6 µM, 1.1 µM, 0.56 µM and 0 µM (control).",
    "Pipette 300 µl of the HUVEC suspension into each 5 microcentrifuge tubes. Add 33 µl of the inhibitor concentrations (11 µM, 5.6 µM, 1.1 µM, 0.56 µM and 0 µM) into one tube each containing the HUVECs, and vortex.\nPipette 50 µl of each of the cell suspensions (1-1.5 x 104 cells) to individual wells of extracellular matrix. Plate each suspension in triplicate and incubate for 4-16 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 4-16 hr, take 4 pictures of the tubes formed per well using an inverted microscope camera11 (original magnification x 100).\n3. Tubule Disruption Assay\nPrepare the extracellular matrix and plates according to the same specifications as the Tube Formation Assay (steps 2.1 to 2.3).\nPrepare HUVEC suspension as described in Steps 2.4- 2.4.2 of the Tube Formation Assay and aliquot into a 96-well plate containing the extracellular matrix at 50 µl per well.\n\tNote: Plate enough wells so that there are 3 wells per drug treatment.\nGrow cells on extracellular matrix for 4 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Take images before the initiation of drug treatment.\nPrepare 2x concentrations of the CXCR2 inhibitor SB225002 as described in Step 2.5 of the Tube Formation assay, and add 50 µl of each concentration per well of the 96 well plate containing the HUVECs. Plate each concentration in triplicate.\nIncubate the plate for another 2-12 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Take 4 images of the tubes formed in each well using an inverted microscope camera (original magnification × 100) 11.\n4. Quantifying Data\nEvaluate tube formation captured in the images by measuring the total tube length of tubes in four random microscopic fields using the microscope camera software.",
    "Open the image in the microscope camera software, and click 'Annotations and Measurements'. Under the 'length' section, select the 'simple line' tool. Click on the image, then draw a line along the length of the tube, then right click.\n\tNote: The software will automatically calculate the length of the line in pixels and put the data into a file.\nRepeat the procedure for all the tube lines in the image by selecting the 'simple line' tool. Click on the image, then draw a line along the length of the tube, then right click.\n\tNote: The software will record the length of each line and display the data on the screen.\nAfter measuring every tube in the picture, click 'Export', then chose 'Length to spreadsheet'.\n\tNote: The length data will be exported to a spreadsheet.\nAdd all of the tube lengths from the spreadsheet to get the total tube length. Calculate and record the average length of the tubes.\n\tNote: Four replicates are recommended with mean and standard deviation determined.\n5. Recovering Cells from the Extracellular Matrix Culture\nCulture and perform a tube formation assay (see section 2) on a larger scale as a 96 well plate will not yield sufficient cell count. For 12 well plates, use 500 µl of extracellular matrix and 500 µl of the HUVEC cell suspension (1.5x105 cells).\nIncubate the cells for 4-16 hr in order to form tubes. Then, aspirate the cell culture medium. Rinse the cells with 1 ml of cold 1x PBS without calcium and magnesium.\nAdd 1 ml of ice cold PBS-2.5 mM EDTA buffer onto the culture and keep on ice for 10 min.",
    "Dislodge the cells and extracellular matrix mixture from the dish using a 1,000 µl pipette tip with tip cut off, and then transfer to a cold 15 ml tube, wash the well with 4 ml of ice cold PBS-2.5 mM EDTA and put into the tube.\nPut the tubes on ice for 1-4 hr and invert the tube a few times until all of the extracellular matrix is dissolved.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 1,620 x g at 0 °C\nRe-suspend the cell pellets with 1 ml cold PBS to a 1.ml tube on ice.\nCentrifuge again for 5 min at 3,000 x g at 0 °C, then dispose of the supernatant.\nStore the cells in -80 °C."
