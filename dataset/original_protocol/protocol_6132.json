    "Minigene constructionTo construct wt minigenes, primers were designed (using Primer-Blast web, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/]) to amplify the regions of interest from a wt DNA sequence. In our case, three intronic regions in the CFTR gene: First, a region of 1,522 bp between intron 12 and intron 13, which includes the nucleotide c.1679+1634. Second, a region of 2,012 bp between intron 18 and intron 20 which includes the nucleotide c.3140-26, and Third a region of 3224 between intron 22 and intron 23 which includes the nucleotide c.3718-2477. Restriction sites were included at the 5′ end of Fw and Rv primers to facilitate cloning into pSPL3 plasmid. We added XhoI sites to the three Fw primers and NheI sites to the first two Rv primers; XbaI was used in the Third one as an NheI site was already present in the genomic sequence. Add six additional nt upstream of the restriction sites to facilitate digestion by restriction enzymes.table:\n﻿0,1\nMinigenes cloning primers,\nMGin12-in13fw,CACACACTCGAGTGTGTTGTCCAGTTTTGGATGA\nMGin12-in13rv,CTCACAGCTAGCACTGGTTTAGCATGAGGCGG\nMGin18-in20fw,CTCACTCTCGAGTGACTAGGAATAGAATGGGGAGAG\nMGin18-in20rv,CACACAGCTAGCACAATGGAAATTCAAAGAAATCACT\nMGin22-in23fw,CACACACTCGAGACAGTACTGGATAGTCCTCTGA\nMGin22-in23rv,CACACATCTAGAGCCTATGAGAAAACTGCACTGG\nAmplify Target regions of interest from a wt genomic DNA sample (Genomic DNA-Human adult normal tissue Lung, from a single donor, Amsbio, Abingdon, UK) using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher) and designed primers using the following program in a Mastercycler Thermocycler (Eppendorf).PCR Amplification of genomic DNA to construct hybrid minigenestable:\n﻿0,1\nDNA template (20 ng/μl),3 μl\n5x Phusion Buffer,4 μl\n10 mM dNTPS,0.4 μl\n10 μM FW primer,0.5 μl\n10 μM RV primer,0.5 μl\nPhusion polymerase,0.5 μl\nNuclease-free water,Up to 20 μl\nPCR programtable:\n﻿0,1,2\nInitial Denaturation,98 °C,30 s\n35 cycles of,98 °C,30 s\n,57 °C,30 s\n,72 °C,2 min\nFinal extension,72 °C,10 min\nHold,4 °C,",

    "Cloning of gRNA sequences to excise intronic sequences in CFTR Use the CRISPR design website tool (http://cripsr.mit.edu[href=http://cripsr.mit.edu/]) to identify and select gRNAs sequences in the intronic regions of gene of interest upstream and downstream to the position where the variants of interest may occur. We selected three different guide RNA target sequences upstream (U1-U3) and three different guide RNA sequences downstream (D1-D3) to each of the three intronic regions (in12, in19 and in22) we wanted to excise. We have chosen guide RNAs pairs which produce targeted excisions of a size that can be easily detected on a standard agarose gel. However, if a more sensitive detection method is used, such as Fragment Length Analysis (FLA), it is possible to choose guide RNAs that produce excisions of essentially any size. It should be noted that guide RNAs close to the canonical splice sites or the branch point should not be used. The CRISPR design website tool offers a score for each possible guide RNA in a particular region based on putative off-target effects that may assist in the selection of the best guide RNAs to use.The CRISPR design website tool will also suggest the sequence of the sense and antisense oligos (Eurofins) to generate a dsDNA fragment encoding the desired gRNA sequence and overhangs to clone using Golden Gate strategy into the BbsI overhangs of the plasmid pSpCas9-(BB)-2A-GFP (Addgene.org PX458). Golden Gate cloning relies on the use of Type IIS restriction enzymes, which cleave outside of their recognition sequence, creating four base flanking overhangs. Oligos are designed to form compatible overhangs when annealed, so they can be cloned in the correct orientation into the plasmid when it is digested by BbsI enzyme.",
    "As successful ligation destroys the BbsI recognition site every cycle of BbsI digestion followed by T4 ligation will enrich the successful cloning.Anneal sense and antisense oligo (1 μg/μl) by mixing 5 μl of each with 85 μl of nuclease-free water and 5 μl of T4 ligase buffer (NEB) in 1.5 ml tubes, and heating the tubes in a block at 95 °C for 5 min.

    "Cotransfection of CFTE cells with pairs of constructed gRNAs/Cas9 expressing plasmidsPrior to transfection, CFTE cells were kept in culture and passaged twice a week with Trypsin-EDTA in a T75 cell culture flask with MEM + 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Seed 100,000 CFTE cells in 12-well plates in free antibiotic MEM + 10% FBS medium 24 h prior to transfection. For other cell types seed enough cells to have around 90% confluency after 24 h. Transfect cells with paired Cas9/gRNA expressing plasmids constructed in Procedure B using one plasmid that express a guideRNA upstream and other downstream of the mutation to get an excision of the region comprised between the two gRNA target sequences. It is worthwhile to test different combinations of gRNA pairs, as the excision efficiency of the different pairs may be different. We used 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 and 0.8 μg of each plasmid. A different transfection reagent or different transfection conditions may be necessary for other cell types.Extract total DNA from transfected cells 48 h after transfection using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. Check Total Nucleic acid concentration using Nanodrop 2000.Note: RNase may be added as described in the DNeasy kit protocol to remove RNA from the sample for a more accurate measuring of DNA concentration.

This refinement is optional as the excision efficiency of using the two plasmids expressing one gRNA as a pair is similar in all the three regions of interest.PCR amplify the gRNA expression cassettes from the plasmids that express the upstream gRNA (gin12U2, gin19U1 and gin22U1) using primers that incorporate NheI at 5′ and XbaI at 3′ of each PCR product respectively.Oligos for p-Tandem plasmids constructiontable:\n﻿0,1\nPc9tand fwNheI,CACACAGCTAGCGAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATT\nPc9tand rvXbaI,CACACATCTAGATCTAGCTCTAAAACAAAAAAGC\nPCR reaction setup to amplify gRNA expression cassettestable:\n﻿0,1\nPlasmid (~20 ng/μl),3 μl\n5x Phusion Buffer,4 μl",
