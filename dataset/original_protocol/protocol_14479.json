    "This animal protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Rhode Island Hospital.\n1. Anesthesia and Intubation\nWeigh the mouse to calculate the dosage of post-operative pain medication.\nPlace the mouse in an induction chamber and deliver 4% isoflurane for 9 - 10 min, monitoring the animal throughout. Turn on a hot bead sterilizer so that the apparatus can preheat to approximately 250 °C. Preheating will take 15 - 20 min.\nOnce the mouse reaches a deep plane of anesthesia, with a breathing rate of approximately 32 breaths/min, place the mouse supine on a Styrofoam board and use an elastic band secured under the top incisors to hold the mouth open. Confirm sedation by performing a toe pinch. Position a high-intensity illuminator above the mouse so that the oropharynx can be visualized.\nUse curved forceps to open the jaw and another pair of forceps to lift the tongue out of the way. Be sure to intubate while positioned at or slightly below eye-level with the body of the mouse. The use of surgical loupes is recommended.\nVisualize the opening and closing of the vocal cords. When open, insert a 20-gauge, 1-in intravenous (IV) catheter with a blunt-tip needle introducer. Use the needle to guide the catheter to the tracheal opening, but avoid inserting the needle into the trachea. Verification of correct placement can be done using a plastic transfer pipette.\nTransfer the intubated mouse to an operating surface equipped with a heating device. Connect the mouse to a small rodent ventilator set to a stroke volume of 150 µL/stroke and a stroke rate of 130 strokes/min.",
    "Deliver 2.5% isoflurane. Verify the intubation by checking for bilateral chest rise. Verify anesthesia by performing a toe pinch. The mouse may need 5 - 10 min on the ventilator to become fully anesthetized.\n2. Preparing the Mouse\nTape down the intubation tube at the connecting site between the ventilator and the IV catheter. Tape down the extremities. Place sterile lubricating drops on the eyes.\nTrim the ventral left side of the thorax with an electric razor. Dust off the shaved fur with dry wipes and apply a small layer of hair removal cream using a sterile cotton swab. The cream should remain in contact with the hair follicles for approximately 30 - 45 s.\nWhile the cream processes, place three sterile cotton swabs in three 1.5-mL tubes filled with Betadine to soak. Using wipes moistened with distilled water, gently wipe away the cream and fur.\nClean the surgical field three times, alternating Betadine and sterile 70% isopropanol prep pads, cleaning in a circular motion moving from center to periphery. Place a sterile drape with a quarter-sized hole over the surgical field of the mouse.\nClean the area surrounding the mouse with 70% ethanol. Verify anesthesia once more with a toe pinch.\n3. LAD Ligation\nPlace the autoclaved surgical instruments in hot bead sterilizer preheated to 250 °C for approximately 20 s. Place the sterilized instruments on sterile autoclaved surgical drape. Don surgical gloves.\nUse fine-tip forceps to gently lift the skin at a point approximately 5 mm to the left of the prominent xiphoid cartilage. Use a surgical scalpel with a No. 10 blade to create a vertical incision in the skin from this point upwards, to the level of the manubrium.",
    "Use curved forceps to gently separate the skin and muscle layers. Open the muscle layer, following the skin incision. Insert two 5-0 polypropylene sutures through the muscle layer, one on either side of the incision, and secure the sutures temporarily with clamps to hold the muscle layer open.\nIdentify and make an incision in the third intercostal space, following the natural angle of the ribcage. Remove the tape from the left extremities of the mouse and secure its left rear foot to its right rear foot with tape. Cut a longer piece of tape and secure its left front foot to the operating surface in a slightly elevated position. Clean the gloves with 70% ethanol.\nUse a retractor to gently spread apart the 3rd and 4th ribs. Cut a small section of sterile gauze, approximately 1 in x ½ in, and dip it in sterile 0.9% saline. Squeeze out the excess saline and use forceps to gently insert the gauze against the left lung to prevent accidental lung damage during the procedure.\nGently remove the thin pericardium with forceps.\nTear a small amount of cotton off a sterile cotton swab and roll it into a small ball. Dip this cotton ball into sterile 0.9% saline and gently swab over the surface of the heart to appreciate the arteries. Gently push the left auricle upwards and locate the coronary arteries underneath.\nIdentify the LAD and pass an 8-0 nylon suture under the LAD; complete two throws to secure the ligation. If the ligation is successful, the left ventricle distal from the ligature will blanch.",
    "Using forceps, remove the gauze inserted earlier, and then gently remove the retractor. Insert a 6-in, 25-gauge flexible tube attached to a 25-gauge needle into the chest cavity through the thoracotomy opening. Advance approximately 1 - 2 in of tubing into the space above the left lung. Return the mouse to a supine position and clean the gloves with 70% ethanol.\nUse 5-0 polypropylene sutures in a simple interrupted pattern to close the ribcage, keeping the chest tube in place. Remove the two sutures holding the muscle layer open. Use 5-0 polypropylene sutures in a simple continuous pattern to close the muscle layer, again keeping the chest tube in place.\nAttach a 1-mL syringe to the 25-gauge needle on the chest tube. Gently pull upwards on the plunger while simultaneously gradually extracting the chest tube from the chest cavity with forceps. Extract the tubing slowly, as this step removes excess air and blood, which would otherwise become trapped in the chest cavity and result in a pneumothorax.\nOnce the syringe is full, detach the syringe from the needle and dispose of the waste in a waste beaker or sink. Continue this process until the chest tube is completely extracted. Ensure that the chest is tightly sealed.\nDecrease the isoflurane to 1.5%. Close the skin with 4-0 polypropylene sutures in a simple interrupted pattern. Turn the isoflurane vaporizer off.\nAdminister 0.1 mg/mL buprenorphine in 0.9% saline via an intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Topically apply 2 mg/mL Lidocaine with 2 mg/mL Bupivacaine in 0.9% saline to the incision. Administer between 200 - 500 µL of 0.9% saline via a subcutaneous injection, scaling the saline amount to the weight of the mouse.",
    "Wait 5 min after administering the pain medications to remove the mouse from the intubation tube. This aids in the transition off the ventilator.\n\t\nIf the mouse does not have a bilateral chest rise once off the ventilator, perform needle decompression. To do this, introduce a 25-gauge sterile needle and a 1-mL syringe between the 3rd and 4th ribs until it enters the thoracic cavity, denoted by a sudden decrease in resistance. Pull up gently on the plunger to remove excess air.\nWhen the mouse demonstrates an adequate bilateral breathing rate and depth and responds to a toe pinch, place the mouse in a clean recovery cage under a heat lamp. Provide the mouse with moist food and a water bottle, monitoring in a laminar flow hood for 15 - 20 min. Monitor for an exaggerated breathing effort, excessive bleeding, or other potentially life-threatening complications.\nFor the next three days, administer 0.1 mg/mL buprenorphine pain medication via an IP injection twice daily. Monitor the mouse daily.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
