    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTo study plasticity induced by sequential patterns of afferent activity in the retinotectal system, the two groups of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) innervating the same tectal cell need to be stimulated independently. This cannot be achieved by stimulating RGCs in a single retina (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) because lateral connections within the retina result in the retinal ganglion cells receiving input from photoreceptor cells over large areas of the retina and interferes with the ability to control visually driven activity in individual neighboring RGCs (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/361-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Visual stimulation strategy\nRetinal ganglion cells (RGCs) on a retina cannot be stimulated independently. (A) Cartoon showing an attempt to stimulate two RGCs on a retina. (B) Drawing of retinal ganglion cells in frog (Cajal, 1972[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). RGCs extend dendrite over wide area in the retina. This induces unintended interaction of the two visual inputs within the retina. (C and D) To control visually driven activity in convergent RGCs, animals in which one tectal lobe is ablated are used, so both eyes innervate the remaining optic tectum. Each eye can be stimulated independently. The green and pink traces are activity in the tectal cells evoked by the green and pink retinal ganglion cells, respectively.\nTo resolve this issue and test the effect of sequential patterns of afferent activity on axon arbor plasticity and visual system plasticity, we used a classical experimental protocol to ablate one optic tectal lobe, which induces inputs from both eyes to converge on the remaining tectal lobe (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Under these conditions, stimulating the left and right eyes in sequence allows temporal control over the activity in the convergent inputs and the ability to study visual experience-driven plasticity in the convergent retinal inputs independent of potential effects within the retina.",
    "Electroporate retinal ganglion cells\nTiming: 4 h (over 2 days)\nPlasmid solution containing p α-actinin:GAL4/UAS:TdTomato ((Bestman and Cline, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Koster and Fraser, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) https://www.addgene.org/161712/[href=https://www.addgene.org/161712/]) and pUAS:Synaptophysin-GFP (Hiramoto and Cline, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Ruthazer et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) is pressure injected into the intravitreal space between the retina and the lens using a Picospritzer. An electric pulse is applied immediately after injecting the plasmid solution. A single high voltage electric pulse (52 V) is used to drive plasmids into the RGCs. The relatively high voltage is necessary because the efficiency of electroporating RGCs is relatively low, for instance compared to optic tectal cells, where pulses of <35 V are sufficient. Applying a single pulse will label a single RGC or a few identifiable cells suitable for in vivo imaging. Using a small anode targets electroporation to a few cells, while using a large cathode reduces potential tissue damage by decreasing the density of the electric field at the cathode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAnesthetize animals: Place an animal in 0.02% MS-222 at 22°C–25°C for less than 1 min. As soon as the animal stops moving, transfer it to Steinberg solution.\nMake an incision in the skin beneath the eyeball for inserting the anode behind the eye\nNote: Most of the retina is not close to the skin. To electroporate RGCs near the center of the retina, make an incision in the skin ventral to the eye ipsilateral to the ablated tectal lobe with a #30-gauge needle. Before making the incision, locate the optic nerve and be sure to avoid touching it with the needle (or the anode).\nSet the animal on the electroporation setup: Place the tadpole ventral side up on the stage of the electroporation rig. Remove excess water from around the tadpole during electroporation.\nInjecting plasmid solution",
    "Centrifuge the plasmid solution at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Take the supernatant and make a solution containing 0.5 μg/μl p α-actinin:GAL4/UAS:TdTomato and 0.25 μg/μl pUAS:Synaptophysin-GFP. Add Fast Green (0.01% final) to monitor the solution during injection.\nLoad a glass pipette with the plasmid solution. Use a commercially available loader (Eppendorf, Microloader #930001007) or one made from 1 mL plastic syringe (Bestman et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAttach the pipette to the Picospritzer. Break the glass pipette tip by gently touching it with a Kimwipe. Test the pipette by applying 90 psi pressure for 100 ms. If a drop of the solution does not come out of the pipette, break the pipette tip again and retest.\nHold the eyeball with forceps to prevent it from rotating. Pierce the skin over the eye at the border between the lens and the retina with the glass pipette. Inject the plasmid solution into the eye until the blue color of the solution can be seen in the eye. The more volume the better for the electroporation but do not overfill the eye or the solution will leak out.\nInsert the anode through the incision underneath the eye and position the tip of the anode behind the retina (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Gently place the cathode on top of the eye. Do not to push the solution out of the eye. Apply a single pulse of electric shock (52 V, 1.6 ms).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/361-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Electroporating the eye",
    "An incision (red line) is made in the skin to insert the anode to contact the back of the eye. The cathode is placed on the skin in front of the eye to make a large contact area. Electroporate immediately after injecting the DNA solution. Make sure that the DNA solution is retained between the retina and the lens before electroporation.\nTransfer the tadpole into fresh Steinberg solution.\nPrepare 100–200 samples by repeating a–f.\nCritical: If the solution leaks out of the eye, the cells will not be transfected. Discard these samples.\nAblate one tectal lobe\nTiming: 23–27 h (2 days)\nWait 24 h after electroporation. Anesthetize an animal in 0.02% MS-222 in Steinberg Solution. Then, transfer the animal into Steinberg solution. Make an incision at the center of the dorsal surface of the midbrain. Cut the entire anterior-posterior extent of the midbrain. Simultaneously, cut both optic nerves at the optic chiasma so inputs from both eyes regrow simultaneously into the remaining optic tectal lobe. This prevents differences in the degree of innervation from the left and right eyes. This protocol is modified from (Ruthazer et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCut the boundary between the right half of the midbrain and the hindbrain. The incision should extend to the ventral aspect of the midbrain to cut through both the tectum and tegmentum. Cut at the anterior edge of the optic tectum.",
    "Pull a glass capillary and attach it to the microcapillary holder (Drummond). Break the tip to make an 100 μm diameter opening. Connect the tube to a vacuum line. Suck out the right tectal lobe and tegmentum. (The tegmentum is removed to decrease the likelihood of the right optic tectum regenerating.) Transfer the tadpole to fresh Steinberg solution. Maintain the animals at 18°C 20–24 h to slow down development during recovery, then move the animals to an incubator at 22°C.\nCritical: Never expose the animals to MS222 after surgery. Animals with incisions are very sensitive to MS-222. This surgery needs to be precise. If the ablation is incomplete, the tectum will regenerate. If the ablation extends beyond the optic tectum, the midbrain will become deformed.\nScreen samples\nTiming: 1–2 h\nSet an animal on a Sylgard block with a hole carved in the Sylgard to hold the tadpole comfortably. Add a few drops of Steinberg’s solution and place a coverslip over the tadpole. Use a regular fluorescent microscope or a spinning disc confocal microscope (ex, Perkin Elmer/Yokogawa CSU-X1) with a 20× objective lens to identify animals in which one or a few labeled RGC axons project to the single ipsilateral tectal lobe. Screening with a spinning disc confocal microscope produces less damage than a regular fluorescent microscope.\nProvide visual stimulation",
    "Note: To stimulate only one eye, it is important to prevent stimulation of the other eye. This is particularly a problem in tadpoles and some fish because the animals may be translucent at stages when experiments are done. As shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A, light presented to one of the two eyes results in activity in both eyes, seen by recording the optic nerves and neurons in each optic tectal lobe. One way to prevent indirect activation of the “other” eye is to stimulate it with persistent illumination (masking light) of sufficient luminance, because the RGCs respond to changes in luminance (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). Provide a masking light to one eye and a light OFF stimulus to the other eye. This produces robust eye-specific OFF responses, compared to the less robust ON stimulus response. In addition, the light OFF stimulus causes less relative illuminance change in the “other” eye. To further optimize control of the eye-specific light OFF responses, when the off stimulus is generated, the LEDs can be dimmed instead of turned off completely.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/361-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Strategy to stimulate one eye\n(A) Unilateral visual stimulation activates both eyes. Electrophysiological recordings from the left and right optic nerves and whole cell recording from neurons in the left and right optic tecta show responses in the retinal ganglion cell axons and the tectal cells respectively following unilateral visual stimulation (red LED and lines indicate visual stimulus). In tadpoles each eye projects axons primarily to the contralateral optic tectum. Stimulus timing is indicated with arrowheads. The light presented to one eye stimulates both eyes due to scattering and reflection.",
    "(B) Masking light presented to one eye (red) prevents the indirect activation of the eye receiving the masking light and results in unilateral responses to the eye receiving the direct visual stimulation (black LED and lines indicate OFF visual stimulation).\n(C) For repeated presentation of OFF stimuli, the LED has to be turned on for the next OFF stimulation; however even a stepwise increase in light intensity can indirectly stimulate the other eye (red circle).\n(D) Gradually increasing LED intensity prevents the unintended indirect stimulation of the eye. In this example, the ramp of increased intensity was 11 s long. The recordings were collected in voltage clamp mode at −70 mV.\nNote: To turn the light on in preparation for the next OFF stimulation, the LED intensity is gradually increased over a period of 5 s or longer (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and 6D). Gradually turning the light on or off enables generation of exclusive OFF or ON stimuli, respectively. Since ON responses and OFF responses are thought to encode different information in the visual system (Kremkow et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Lee et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), the opportunity to provide one or the other stimulus independently would be useful for studying the contributions of ON responses and OFF responses to the sensory experience-dependent plasticity. In addition to the convergent circuit shown here, this method is also useful to study inter-tectal communication in the visual system.\nInducing plasticity in the visual circuit with sequential visual inputs\nSet the visual stimulator (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1])\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_361_2.csv\nKey# corresponds to the number of the keys from the left top. To start the stimulation program, push key#7. To stop and reset, push key#8.",
    "Start with an example to generate sequential OFF stimuli with a 15 ms interval between the right and left eye stimulation, with the right eye stimulated first. Set the stimulation cycle to 11 s.\nConnect the circuit board to 12 V AC adaptor.\nConnect the wires from the tadpole stimulation chamber to the circuit board. The sockets are located on the upper edge of the circuit board. The LEDs on the left and the right acrylic plates are connected to left and the right slots, respectively. Up to 8 animal chambers can be connected.\nTurn on the two toggle switches at left corner.\nPush key#2 and push key#5/6 until dt is set at “15” ([ms] interval between left and right eyes (L/R)).\nPush key#3 and push key#5/6 until u is set at “1024” (light ON intensity for right LED, “1024” is a setting for the maximum intensity. “0” is off.).\nPush key#4 and push key#5/6 until d is set at “192” (light OFF intensity for right LED).\nLong push key#2 and push key#5/6 until it is set at “1024” (light ON intensity of left LED).\nLong push key#3 and push key#5/6 until D is set at “192” (light ON intensity of left LED).\nPush key#1 and push key#5/6 until I is set at “11” ([s] cycle time interval).\nLong push key#4 and push key#5/6 until p is set at “1” (ramp speed).\nLong push key#7 until “10 h” is displayed (stimulation time).\nPush key# 7 to start stimulation. This switches LEDs on. Then, the cycles of OFF stimulus followed by ramping ON start.\nPlacing animals in the stimulation chamber",
    "Select a chamber in which the gap between the acrylic plates fits the width of the tadpole. The anterior of the animal is supported with a Sylgard block and the tail is supported by Sylgard strips (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The dorsal side is covered with a coverslip. The coverslip is attached to the acrylic plate with utility wax.\nDrug application\nTo investigate the mechanisms regulating plasticity, drugs can be introduced to the bath solution (tank water) at different times depending on the experimental design.\nUse-dependent NMDAR block to dissect plasticity mechanisms\nNMDAR are thought to play several roles in neuronal and circuit plasticity. Because MK801 is a use-dependent NMDAR antagonist, this drug enables analysis of the requirement for NMDAR in specific components of neural circuits if they can be selectively stimulated. In addition, NMDAR response amplitudes are thought to encode information regulating plasticity. Here, we demonstrate how to take advantage of the use-dependent blockade by MK801 to address this hypothesis. We used MK801 to attenuate the NMDAR activity in one of the two retinotectal pathways. This procedure needs to be done in a dark room because visual stimulus from room lights is sufficient for MK801 to block NMDAR. To stimulate one of the two eyes, the “other” eye is illuminated with 100% intensity of LED light to avoid either ON or OFF responses and the active eye is stimulated with light off stimulus from LED. We stimulated OFF responses only and avoided ON responses by gradually turning on the LED.\nPlace animals in the stimulation chamber and put the chamber in a light-tight black container with about 150 mL capacity. Fill the container with 50 mL Steinberg solution.",
    "Stimulate the right eye with dimming light (from maximum illumination to complete off, 20% change /s in the turn on period, 5.5 s/stimulation cycle). Stimulate the left eye with persistent light at 100% luminance. Continue stimulation for 5 min. This pre-stimulation prevents strong activation by the first light stimulus after the dark environment.\nAdd 50 mL of 4 μM MK801 in Steinberg’s solution to the chamber so the final concentration is 2 μM MK801. Continue the stimulation protocol for 14 min.\nAfter a total of 15 min exposure to MK801, turn off the stimulation and immediately pour 50 mL Steinberg solution into the chamber to rapidly dilute the MK801. Then, drain all the MK801 solution and replace with 50 mL fresh Steinberg’s solution. Wash with 50 mL fresh Steinberg solution three more times.\nSet the controller for both eyes at 100%–18.8% (max-min luminance) for the off stimulation, 11 s per stimulation cycle, and 8 h for duration.\nWhen 15 min has passed after the LED was turned off, start the visual stimulation.\nImage the RGC axons",
    "To analyze structural changes in axon arbor morphology, collect time-lapse images of the axons at intervals from 1 to 24 h, depending on the experimental design. Quantifying branch dynamics can demonstrate directed growth of axon arbors. Our previous experiments showed that projection sites of convergent axons within the optic tectum shift relative to one another when they are stimulated in a sequence. Axons that are stimulated 15–50 ms earlier or later shift their arbor position in the rostral or caudal direction, respectively. Daily imaging is suitable to detect directed growth of axons. Image samples at shorter intervals, such as every 1–2 h over 4–8 h, to analyze the spatial distribution of branch dynamics that contribute to the directed arbor growth (Hiramoto and Cline, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Ruthazer et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). For time-lapse in vivo imaging, collect the images with a spinning disc microscope, confocal, or multiphoton microscope immediately before the next visual stimulation period. An advantage of multiphoton microscopes is that animals are not exposed to visual experience from the scanning laser during the image acquisition. The image data are analyzed with Imaris (Oxford Instruments) or other image processing software."
