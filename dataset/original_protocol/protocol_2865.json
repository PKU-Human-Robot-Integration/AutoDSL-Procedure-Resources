Alternatively, a more\n      sensitive silver staining protocol can also be used to stain proteins in\n      the SDS gel directly after electrophoresis.\n    \nNote: In addition to the validation of the\n      biotinylation patterns (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]), the blot\n      membranes can be incubated with primary antibodies directed against known\n      / expected or new target proteins as identified by LC-MS/MS.\n    \nOptional: Alternatively to the\n      detection by HRP-streptavidin, nascent proteins may be visualized directly\n      within the SDS gel by in-gel fluorescence by using\n      tetramethylrhodamine-azide (TAMRA) in the CLICK reaction as described in\n      Forester et al.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nCritical: It is important to validate\n      the specific biotinylation patterns in all samples that received L-HPG\n      compared to methionine prior to LC-MS/MS to ensure that the metabolic\n      labeling has worked (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] as example).\n    \nOn beads tryptic digest and nanoHPLC-MS/MS: Days 8–10\nTiming: 1 day (for step 10)\n    \nTiming: 1 day (for steps 11 and 12)",
