    "1. Stage Pupae\nSet up a cross with 20 - 40 virgin females and about 20 males per bottle of fly food (Figure 1A). Alternatively, if stocks will be used, flip each stock into new bottles. To get enough pupae, consider setting up two bottles per genotype.\nIncubate the bottles at 25 °C (or 27 °C according to the experimental design) for five to six days (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Keep flipping the flies every two to three days to avoid overcrowding and to ensure a continuous supply of pupae.\nUse a wet brush to collect white prepupae from the walls of the bottles and transfer them to the glass slides (Figure 1C). Time the staging such that the pupae reach the desired age when starting live imaging under the microscope.\n\tNOTE: These prepupae look like older pupae in terms of their shape, but they are still white like larvae. The onset of the prepupal stage is defined as 0 h after puparium formation (0 h APF).\nRemove clumps of fly food sticking to the pupae with a wet brush and orient the ventral side of the pupae towards the glass slide using a stereomicroscope (Figure 1D). Discard pupae that are still moving (too young) or that have started to turn brown (too old). This ensures that all pupae have the same age (0 - 1 h APF).\nLabel the slides with genotype, date and time of collection. Transfer the glass slides to one petri dish each and add a wet tissue to prevent the pupae from drying out (Figure 1E).",
    "Store the pupae in an incubator at 25 °C or 27 °C until they reach the desired age. Continue with the next steps 1 h before imaging, so that the pupae have the desired age when starting live imaging (step 3), for example at 13 h APF for the movie shown in Figure 2A-D.\n\tNOTE: The earliest feasible starting time point is after head-eversion of the pupae occurring at 8 - 10 h APF at 27 °C.\n2. Prepare Pupae for Imaging\nEnsure that the pupae now stick to the glass slide just like they naturally stick to the walls of the bottles because of residual fly food. No extra glue is required. If the pupae do not stick well enough because of high humidity, open the petri dish for a few min to let them dry. Alternatively, transfer them to double-sided tape on a glass slide, but usually, this is not necessary.\nOpen window in the pupal case for imaging of indirect flight muscles (Figure 1F; Skip to section 2.3 for imaging of abdominal muscles.)\n\t\nOrient the pupae sticking to the glass slide with the anterior facing away from the researcher under a stereomicroscope. Adjust the zoom to 2X.\nUsing one end of biology grade #5 forceps, gently poke a hole into the pupal case dorsal to the wing where the abdomen ends, and the thorax begins.\nTo slice open the pupal case, gently move the forceps to the anterior end of the thorax along the wing but avoid damaging the vulnerable wing tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: If fluid leaks from the pupa, it is damaged; discard it and start over with a different pupa.",
    "Lift up the section of the pupal case above the thorax with the forceps and then cut this section off with fine, sharp scissors on the opposite side of the dorsal midline.\nOpen window in pupal case for imaging of abdominal muscles (Figure 1G)\n\t\nOrient the pupae sticking to the glass slide with the anterior facing towards the researcher under a stereomicroscope. Adjust the zoom to 2X.\nUsing one end of biology grade #5 forceps, gently poke a hole into the pupal case dorsal to the wing where the thorax ends, and the abdomen begins.\nTo slice open the pupal case, gently move the forceps towards the posterior end of the abdomen.\n\t\tNOTE: If fluid leaks from the pupa, it is damaged; discard it and start over with a different pupa.\nLift up the section of the pupal case above the abdomen with the forceps and then cut this section off with fine, sharp scissors on the opposite side of the dorsal midline.\nMount Pupae (Figure 1H)\n\t\nUse a wet brush to transfer up to five pupae to a plastic slide with a groove (custom-built, reusable, see discussion and list of materials). Add one or two spacer coverslips to each side depending on the depth of the groove and the thickness of the pupae. Put a small drop of water underneath each spacer coverslip to make it stick to the slide and leave some space between the groove and the spacer coverslips on each side.\n\t\tNOTE: The spacer coverslips can also be permanently attached to the slide with super glue, in advance.",
    "Orient the pupae such that the opening in the pupal case faces upwards using the brush. Ensure careful positioning of the pupae at the correct angle for good imaging quality. Optimize the angle for each tissue and developmental time point.\n\t\tNOTE: A small amount of water in the groove makes positioning of the pupae easier. Drain excess water with the brush afterward to avoid drowning.\nHold a coverslip (18 x 18 mm) above the pupae without touching them. Place small droplets (about 0.5 µL) of 50% glycerol solution above each pupal case opening onto the coverslip using a 20 µL pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure ensures that the droplets have the same spacing as the pupae.\nTurn the coverslip over and position it above the pupae by hand or using forceps (standard #5) while resting one side of the coverslip on the spacer coverslips next to the pupae. Next, gently drop the coverslip onto the pupae. Ensure that the pupal case openings are properly covered with 50% glycerol for good imaging quality and to prevent the pupae from drying out.\nFold over one end of a piece of adhesive tape and grab it with forceps (standard #5) at that end. Gently place the tape such that it covers one edge of the top coverslip, the spacer coverslip(s), and the plastic slide on one side. Do not press down the tape, yet. First, turn the slide around and repeat for the other side.\nUse both index fingers to press down the tape simultaneously on both sides. This procedure ensures that the pupae are not displaced.\nCheck whether the pupae are well in contact with the coverslip. For optimal imaging quality the pupae should be gently squeezed underneath the coverslip. Adjust the number of spacer coverslips if necessary.",
    "Label the slide by writing on the sticky tape.\n3. Live Imaging of Pupae\nThe mounting method allows imaging of the pupae both on inverted microscopes (Figure 1I) and on upright microscopes (Figure 1J). Especially suitable for live imaging are scanning confocal microscopes, two-photon microscopes and spinning disc confocal microscopes irrespective of whether they are inverted or upright. For long-term movies, use a temperature-controlled stage if available.\nUsing the ocular and a UV lamp or transmission light, locate a pupa and focus inside the pupa.\nUsing the camera, find the desired structure and adjust the zoom level.\nFor long-term movies, define a z-stack that encompasses the structure of interest well (for example, the indirect flight muscles, their attachment sites, the tendon cells or a combination the aforementioned) and choose a time interval. Consider doing averaging for better image quality. For high-speed, short-term movies, choose a single z-plane to achieve a high frame rate.\nAdjust the laser power to give the best possible signal but little saturation. However, too high laser power can damage the pupa over time.\nStart imaging and return from time to time to check the movie and readjust the z-stack positioning if necessary.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57312/57312fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Workflow for live imaging of muscle-tendon morphogenesis in Drosophila pupae.
