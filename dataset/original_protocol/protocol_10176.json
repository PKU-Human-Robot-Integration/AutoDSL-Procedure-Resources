    "1. Etching of Pins (Figure 2A)\nDegrease rectangular pins by immersion in acetone.\nPassivate the pins by immersing in 4 mL of 10% nitric acid, then heat the solution at 65 °C for 30 min in an oven.\nSonicate the pins in deionized water for 5 min to remove residual acid and dry with a paper towel. Immerse the pins in 0.5 mL of mold release agent for 2 h.Sonicate the pins in deionized water for 5 min.\nFabricate an etching dish (Figure 2C).\n\t\nDraw or inscribe two parallel lines with a 4 mm gap on a glass slide using a ruler.\nApply a chemical-resistant and low viscosity adhesive to one surface of two rectangular cut coverglasses.\nBond the two cut coverglasses on the glass slide at a 4 mm gap. Use the parallel line as a guide.\nDispense two lines of silicone adhesive on the etching dish (see Figure 2C for the position and the size of the contour).\n\tNOTE: A 3D-printed template (a STL model file is included as a supplemental material) will help draw lines easily and accurately.\nPut the pins on the etching dish so that the 2 mm-long tips on their straight ends are immersed into the adhesive line pattern. Dispense the adhesive again to ensure that the pins are completely covered and to draw a contour. Transfer the etching dish to a humidified fermenter heated to 38 °C. Wait overnight to cure the adhesive.\nAdd 0.2 mL of 0.5 M nitric acid to 0.2 mL of 5.0 M hydrochloric acid slowly in a glass vial.",
    "CAUTION: The mixture, also known as Aqua regia, is very corrosive and potentially explosive. Wear acid-proof rubber gloves and safety goggles, and exercise extreme caution when handling acids. Never store the solution. Reduce nitric acid as possible to decrease its aggressiveness.\nPut the etching dish on a hotplate heated to 65 °C. Pour 0.4 mL of the acid mixture over the uncovered region of the pins. Wait 10 min and transfer the acid to a beaker.\nNeutralize all the remaining acid including the etched region of the pins with 5 mL of 0.8 M sodium bicarbonate solution in deionized water.\nRemove the pins from the etching dish by pulling the pins longitudinally with tweezers. Sonicate the pins in deionized water for 5 min followed by sonication in acetone for 5 min.\nPassivate the etched region of the pins as in step 1.2.\nCheck the width of the etched pins with a shop microscope with a reticle. Adjust the etching time described in 1.7 so that the width of the etched region is 0.2 ± 0.02 mm.\nTransfer the pins to a glass vial containing 5 ml of 70% ethanol. Bring the vial to a laminar hood. Pick up the pins out of the vial and allow them to dry.\n2. Fabrication of Silicone slab with Reservoirs and a Space for Pins.\nFabricate a mold for a space for pins and a fixed sidewall by typical lithographic processes.\n\t\nCoat a degreased glass slide with 1 mL of negative epoxy photoresist using a spin coater at 1,000 rpm. Dry the photoresist on a 95 °C hot plate for 15 min. Repeat this step once.",
    "Spin coat the third layer of the same photoresist at 2,000 rpm on the glass slide with coated photoresist. Dry the photoresist on a 95 °C hotplate for 30 min.\nExpose the photoresist layer to 450 mJ/cm2 of 365-nm ultraviolet light from a UV spot light source through a photoplotted film. Bake the exposed photoresist on a 95 °C hotplate for 15 min. Develop the photoresist by spraying a solvent (2-methoxy-1-methylethyl acetate) using a hand sprayer, and blow-dry with nitrogen gas.\nPlace the glass slide with patterned photoresist at the bottom of a plastic dish.\nPour prepolymer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) onto the mold to a thickness of 3 mm.Debubble the PDMS prepolymer in a vacuum desiccator at -800 kPa for 10 min.\nCure the PDMS prepolymer in an oven at 65 °C for 1 h. Demold the partially cured PDMS slab using a scalpel. Fully cure the PDMS in an oven at 120°C for 1 h.\nAlong the guideline pattern, trim away irregular edges from the PDMS slab with the same scalpel. Make as precise and clean a cut as possible, particularly at the surface that defines the insertion slot (See Figure 1A) for the pins.\nPerforate 2 mm-diameter holes for the inlet/outlet into the ends of the main channel of the PDMS slab using biopsy punches. Similarly, perforate 1 mm-dimeter holes at the ends of the air vent channel. See Figure 1A for the channel layout and the position of these holes.\n3. Assembly of the Device with In-Place Fabrication of Gap Filler and Barrier.\nFabricate a microchannel assembly.\n\t\nImmerse a 10 × 20 mm No. 4 coverglass in a cleaning solution heated to 60 °C for 10 min.\nRinse the coverglasses with deionized water twice and dry at 120 °C for 10 min.",
    "Plasma-bond the PDMS slab to a coverglass:\n\t\t\nPlace the PDMS slab (channel feature side up) and the cleaned 10 × 20 mm No. 4 coverglass in the vacuum chamber of a sputter coater.\nStart pumping down the chamber to 60 Pa. Generate air vacuum plasma (20 mA) for 30 s.\nImmediately vent the chamber. Bond the channel feature side of the PDMS slab to the coverglass with their edges aligned.\nPlace the bonded layers in a 65 °C oven for 10 min.\nBring the bonded layers to a laminar hood using a sterile container. Sterilize them with UV light for 30 min.\nIn the laminar hood, insert the pins into the slot so that their ends form the other sidewall of the microchannel. Adjacent pins should be different in length to avoid contact of both vertical ends (See Figure 1B). Large spacing between the vertical ends is preferable. A space of (N-1) × (pin width) is possible when N kinds of pins with different pin lengths (L in Figure 2A) are prepared.\nFabricate a base ( Figure 2B).\n\t\nMake or read a part file of the base and make two numerical control (NC) files (containing toolpaths; included as supplemental material) using CAD/CAM software. The first supplemental NC file uses a 4 mm-diameter end mill and the second a 1 mm-diameter end mill.\nClamp a 3 mm-thick clear polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) board onto a CNC mill.\nOpen the first NC file on the controller of a computer NC (CNC) mill. Install a 4 mm end mill to the CNC mill and locate part zero by touching the end mill to the PMMA board. Run the NC code to cut the board.\n\t\tNOTE: Occasionally blow the end mill tip with compressed air for cooling and chip removal.",
    "Repeat 3.2.3 using the second NC file and a 1 mm end mill.\nDegrease the machined parts with detergent and dry with a paper towel. Spray the parts with 70 % ethanol and bring them to a laminar hood.\nFabricate a pin gap filler and elastomeric barrier:\n\t​NOTE: Steps 3.3.1 - 3.3.7 should be performed aseptically in a laminar hood.\n\t\nPrepare gap filler by mixing white petrolatum and polytetrafluoroethylene powder at a 2:1 ratio by weight. Homogenize the mixture using an ultrasonic homogenizer.\nPour gap filler into a dispenser syringe. Insert a plunger and push it to fill the tip of the syringe. Attach a needle and push the plunger again until the needle tip is filled. Likewise, prepare a dispenser syringe with a plunger and a needle, and fill with silicone adhesive.\nConnect each syringe to a pneumatic dispenser using an adapter tube. Adjust the dispense pressures for silicone adhesive and filler to 250 kPa and 280 kPa.\nDispense silicone adhesive to the edge of a pocket of the base. Place a 10 × 20 mm No.4 coverglass on the pocket and press it firmly to bond.\nDispense silicone adhesive to a depth of approximately 1 mm to draw two segments along two outer slots of the base. Dispense gap filler to a depth of approximately 1 mm, to draw segments along the other slot.\nDispense silicone adhesive to the edge of another pocket. Place a microchannel assembly (3.1) on the pocket and press it firmly to bond.\nRepeat 3.3.5 to ensure that both gap filler and silicone adhesive fully embed the pins and that there is no opening at the slots.",
    "Put the device in a sterile container such as a stainless steel box with lid. Transfer the container to a humidified fermenter heated to 38 °C. In the laminar hood, cure the elastomeric barrier for one day.\nMove each pin up to 1 mm along adjacent pins to release the pins from the cured elastomeric barrier.\nSterilize the device with UV light for 30 min.\n4. Evaluation of the Microfluidic Device\nDetect leakage using fluorescence\n\t\nOpen the microchannel using a fine tool or a desktop robot. Make the channel width as consistent throughout the channel as possible.\nDilute a green fluorescent dye with deionized water at 10 µM to make fluorescence solution.\nAdd fluorescence solution to one of the end ports of the microchannel with a micropipettor. This step will fill the channel with the solution.\nPut the microfluidic device and two pieces of absorbent paper wet with deionized water in a large plastic dish. Incubate the dish at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 24 h.\nRecord green fluorescence images of the microchannel with an inverted fluorescent microscope with a microscope camera.\nOpen the fluorescent images with an appropriate image analysis software and confirm there is no leakage (green fluorescence) at the interface of the gap filler and the pins.\nSeed cells to the microchannel.\n\t\nPrepare a cell culture vessel containing 70 - 80% confluent cells (depending on cell types). Detach and suspend the cells in growth medium.\nCentrifuge the cells (the speed and time depend on cell types), and aspirate the medium.\nResuspend the cells with a small amount of medium. Count the cells with a cell counter and adjust the cell density from 1.5 × 106 to 1.5 × 107 cells/mL.",
    "Open the microchannel using a fine tool or a desktop robot (Figure 1B) to make a straight 400-µm-wide channel. Adjust pin positions to make the sidewall as flat throughout the channel as possible. Add cell suspension to one of the end port of the microchannel and fill the channel.\nLocate one of the pins that defines the sidewall of the region to start culture. Under an inverted microscope, close the two adjacent pins to enclose cells in the cell culture region.\nClose all pins from in order from inner to outer to expel all cells from the channel. Gently aspirate suspension from the end ports, and add medium to them.\nIncubate the device as described in 4.1.4. When cells are about 70 - 80% confluent, slowly open a pin to widen the culture area."
