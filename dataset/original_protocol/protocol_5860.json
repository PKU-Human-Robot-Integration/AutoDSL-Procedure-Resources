  "procedures": [
    "Notes:  This protocol specifically describes measuring the change in a population’s competitive fitness after experimental evolution in the presence of Serratia marcescens (SM2170). However, it can be adapted to measure relative fitness between any two or more nematode populations of interest in the presence of any parasite that can grow and transmit under the conditions described. No specific experimental nematode strains or experimental evolution protocols are necessary to use this protocol simply as a means of measuring fitness. However, a clearly marked GFP strain is required.Before experimental evolution, the generation 0 ancestor nematodes should be frozen at -80 °C. Similarly, at the end of experimental evolution, it will be necessary to freeze the experimentally evolved populations for use in these and any other subsequent assays. The freezing protocol can be found in Stiernagle (2006) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19649/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19649/]).This procedure spans over ~2 weeks. See Table 1 for an example of the procedure schedule. Table 1. Example of Procedure Daily Scheduleimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180815/20180815001403_4449.jpg  Thawing experimental and tester populationsRemove one frozen tube for each of the following strains from the -80 °C freezer: Generation 0 ancestor Experimentally evolved population of interest GFP-labeled tester strain (JK2735) Note: If measuring relative competitive fitness, thaw 2 or more nematode populations of interest and the GFP-labeled tester strain.Allow the tubes to thaw at room temperature.After thawing, gently invert the tubes several times to mix the solution.Pour the entire contents of the tube onto a labeled 100 mm E. coli OP50-seeded NGM Lite plate.Allow the plates to absorb all the liquid content. If the liquid content is not fully absorbed, dry the plates briefly in the chemical fume hood with lids off.Incubate these plates at 20 °C for 24 h.Examine the plates to see that at least 50 nematodes survived thawing.",
    "If so, incubate the plates at 20 °C to allow the population to recover from thawing and expand (about 1 week). If not, thaw another freezer tube for the population of interest and repeat the thawing process.Prepping for SynchronizationOnce the generation 0 ancestor, experimentally evolved, and GFP-labeled tester populations have expanded to the point that hundreds of individuals are observed on each plate, you may proceed.For each population, use a flame-sterilized metal spatula to cut approximately 2.5 cm2 of NGM Lite from the plate containing nematodes.For each population, remove this piece of NGM Lite from the original plate and place it face down onto a new 100 mm OP50-seeded NGM Lite plate.Incubate these new plates at 20 °C for 48 h.After 48 h, view the plates from Step B4 under the microscope to check for eggs. If at least ~1,000 eggs are observed on the surface of the plate, proceed to Procedure C. If not, incubate the plates at 20 °C and check the next day. If the plate is exhausted of OP50, the nematodes will no longer produce eggs. In this case, repeat Steps B2-B5.SynchronizationNote: The synchronization protocol is adapted from Stiernagle (2006). The purpose of synchronization is to kill all nematodes, leaving only the eggs that have been deposited on the plate to survive. This will age synchronize the population at the egg stage. Working one plate at a time, add 2 ml of M9 buffer to the plate.Note: Some of the M9 buffer will be absorbed into the plate. Therefore, adding 2 ml of M9 buffer to the plate will result in ~1 ml to be collected from the plate. Tilt the plate side to side to wash the entire surface of the plate with M9 buffer.",
    "Note: If the bacterial lawn on the plate appears thick and sticky, use a pipette tip to gently scrape the surface of the plate. This will help loosen the eggs. Tilt the plate to allow all of the M9 buffer to pool in one area. Use a pipette to remove the M9 buffer and move it into a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube.Repeat Steps C1-C4 so that each population is in its own micro-centrifuge tube.Centrifuge tubes at 845 x g for 30 sec to form a pellet.Remove the supernatant from each tube, using a new pipette tip between tubes.Add 800 μl M9 buffer to each tube containing the pellets.Note: Steps C9-C17 should be completed in 3 min or less to prevent the bleach from damaging the eggs. Add 200 μl household bleach to each centrifuge tube containing the pellets and 800 μl M9 buffer.Note: This will yield a 20% household bleach solution in each tube. Close and invert the tubes several times to mix the bleach and M9 buffer, and to loosen the pellet.Centrifuge the tubes at 845 x g for 30 sec.Remove the supernatant from each tube, using a new pipette tip between tubes.Wash each pellet with 1 ml M9 buffer. Close and invert the tubes several times to loosen the pellet.Centrifuge the tubes at 845 x g for 30 sec.Remove supernatant from each tube, using a new pipette tip between tubes.Repeat Steps C13-C15.Note: You will have washed the pellet twice. Pipette the entire pellet from each tube onto its own new 100 mm OP50-seeded NGM Lite plate, being sure to change tips between tubes.Incubate the plate at 20 °C for 48 h, or until the nematodes are at larval stage L4.",
    "Preparation of Serratia Selection Plates (SSPs)On the same day of synchronization (see Table 1–Day 10), inoculate OP50 and SM2170 (or relevant parasite) each into 5 ml LB. Incubate overnight at 28 °C, shaking at 160 rpm.The next day, on the bottom of a 100 mm Petri dish filled with 25 ml NGM Lite, draw a ~2.5 cm stripe across the middle of the dish, dividing the dish into 3 sections (see Figure 1). Notes: It is important to use plates that are not damp. In order to dry the surface of the plates, they can be placed in a chemical fume hood with lids off for ~20 min. Be sure to remove excess condensation from the plate lid as well.  Make enough SSPs to give proper replication of the ancestor and each experimentally evolved population. We recommend at least 3 replicates for each.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180814/20180814234137_6272.jpgFigure 1. View of the bottom of a 100 mm Petri dish with ~2.5 cm strip drawn across the middlePipette 35 μl of OP50 (~ 2.9 x 109 CFU/ml) onto one of the far thirds of the NGM Lite and use a sterile inoculation loop to evenly spread the OP50 within the section. It is important to plate the OP50 first to prevent SM2170 from contaminating and being spread in this section of the plate. When pipetting the bacteria onto the SSP, discharge only to the first stop of the pipette to prevent splattering on the plate.On the opposite far third of the NGM Lite, pipette 35 μl of SM2170 (~ 7.8 x 108 CFU/ml) and use a sterile inoculation loop to evenly spread the bacteria within this section. Again, be sure to discharge to only the first pipette stop. The middle third will be left blank.",
    "Keep the plates level to prevent bacteria from spreading into other sections, incubate the SSPs overnight at 28 °C.Calculating Nematode Concentration48 h after bleach synchronizing the nematode populations, add 2 ml M9 buffer to the plates containing synchronized nematodes. Notes: Nematodes should be at L4 larval stage. Some of the M9 buffer will absorb into the plate. Therefore, adding 2 ml of M9 buffer to the plate will result in approximately 1 ml to be collected from the plate. Tilt the plate with M9 buffer side to side to wash the entire surface of the plate.Keeping the plate tilted to pool the M9 buffer, and using a new wide bore pipette tip between populations, collect each population of nematodes into its own 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube.Note: Wide bore tips are used when transferring live nematodes to avoid damaging the C. elegans and to increase the precision of measurements. Centrifuge the tubes containing nematodes at 94 x g for 30 sec to form a pellet.Wash the pellet 2 times with M9 buffer (as described in Steps C12-C16, except use 94 x g when centrifuging).After washing the populations twice, resuspend the nematodes in 1 ml M9 buffer.Invert the micro-centrifuge tube several times to mix.Working one population at a time, and using a wide bore pipette tip, take 3-20 μl samples, and place onto a microscope slide (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180814/20180814234154_1138.jpgFigure 2. Microscope slide with 3-20 μl samples of nematodes in M9 bufferUnder the microscope, count the number of nematodes in each 20 μl sample using a hand tally counter. Note: In order to count accurately, there should be approximately 30-50 nematodes in each sample.",
    "If the number of nematodes is outside this range, appropriately dilute or concentrate the centrifuge tubes containing the nematodes, and take 3 new 20 μl samples onto a microscope slide. This may need to be done more than once to get the correct approximate range.Calculate the average of the 3 samples and divide by 20 to get the average concentration of nematodes per 1 μl.Use the following equation to calculate the volume needed to give 100 nematodes:Volume = 100/xwhere x is the average concentration of nematodes per 1 μl, calculated in Step E10.Repeat Steps E7-E11 for the generation 0 ancestor, each experimentally evolved C. elegans population and the GFP-labeled tester strain. Note: The nematode population of interest will be competed against the GFP-labeled tester strain on the same plate. Therefore, if the calculated volumes of the focal strain and the GFP-tester strain total to more than ~150 μl, it will be necessary to concentrate the nematodes, repeat Steps E7-E11.  Competing either ancestral or experimental “focal” populations vs. a tester strain on the SSPPrior to introducing nematodes to the SSP, add a stripe of ampicillin across the middle section of the plate. (20 μl of 200 mg/ml ampicillin) (see Figure 3)Note: SM2170 is very motile. Ampicillin prevents SM2170 from spreading into the OP50 portion of the SSP.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180814/20180814234209_1565.pngFigure 3. Serratia selection plate (SSP) design including ampicillin To the parasite side of the SSP, add both the focal host population of interest and the GFP-labeled tester strain in the volumes calculated in Step E11. Replicate as needed for each experimental population and the ancestral population to generate multiple pseudo replicate CFAs for each population.",
    "Pipette onto 3 OP50-seeded NGM Lite plates the volume calculated in Step E11 for the following:The generation 0 ancestorThe experimentally evolved strainThe GFP-labeled tester strainNote: These plates will be counted in Procedure G to determine the actual average number of hosts added to the SSP assay plates. Allow the SSPs to remain level and dry at room temperature for approximately 20 min.Incubate SSPs at 20 °C for 48-72 h, or enough time for the competed populations to reproduce and for the offspring to be at larval stage L1/L2.Scoring the SSP assaysNote: It is necessary to use the GFP filter with the stereomicroscope and fluorescence illumination lamp in order to visualize the pharyngeal GFP marker. Within the OP50 third of the SSP, count the number of focal and GFP-tester offspring out of a sample of 200 total offspring in a cross-section of the SSP (see Figure 4).Note: It is necessary to alternate between high and low backlighting during counting. High background light will allow the counter to visualize all the offspring, while low background light will allow the counter to differentiate between focal and GFP-labeled strains.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180814/20180814234310_6351.jpgFigure 4.

Example of GFP expressing C. elegans under low backlight conditions. Focal strains do not express GFP. Scale bar = 0.1 mm.Count the number of adult hosts on each of the 3 OP50-seeded plates for each population from Step F3. Take the average of the 3 counts and use this number to calculate the initial ratio of focal to tester strain parents.",
    "Calculate the mean relative fitness and the percent change in fitness after experimental evolution The relative competitive fitness of a focal population or strain (experimental population or ancestral population) to the tester strain can be calculated as the relative change in the ratio of non-GFP to GFP expressing individuals over the course of the assay. Specifically, this is determined as:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180815/20180815001531_2876.jpgwhere, WX is the relative fitness of the focal strain, x is the proportion of focal strain offspring, and y is the proportion of focal strain parents initially plated on the SSP. See Supplementary Data[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180717/1802035 Supplemental data.xls] for a sample data set from competitive fitness assays conducted on C. elegans host populations evolved in the presence of SM2170 (Evolution) and host populations evolved in the presence of heat-killed SM2170 (Control) for 30 generations. Relative fitness values greater than one indicate greater fitness for the focal strain relative to the tester strain. Whereas, relative fitness values of less than one indicate greater tester strain fitness relative to the focal strain. Finally, calculate the mean relative fitness for each focal strain by averaging the relative fitness values across each pseudo replicate.After experimental evolution, the percent change in mean competitive fitness for an experimental population can be calculated as:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180815/20180815001604_4071.jpgwhere, W ̅E is the mean relative fitness of the experimental population across all pseudo replicates and W ̅A is the relative fitness of the ancestral population across all pseudo replicates (Supplementary Data[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180717/1802035 Supplemental data.xls]). Positive percent change values indicate that the experimental population increased in fitness during experimental evolution. Conversely, negative percent change values indicate a loss of fitness in the experimental population. Importantly, the percent change in mean fitness should be calculated separately for each independently evolved replicate population.",
    "We found a greater percent change in mean fitness in populations evolved under the Evolution treatment than those evolved under the Control treatment (Supplementary Data[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180717/1802035 Supplemental data.xls] and Figure 5)."
