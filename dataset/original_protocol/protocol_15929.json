    "This protocol outlines a method we previously developed to identify deleterious mutant RNA interactions in DM1 (Rehman et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0036]) and is therefore highly recommended. EGFP and Cy3 were used as FRET pairs to identify molecular interaction between the mutant RNA foci and the MBNL1 protein.\nMaterials\nPlasmids: EGFP-Protein (MBNL1) and EGFP empty vector (see “Prepare plasmids, cell lines, transfection, slides for FRET”)\nCell line of interest expressing the RNA foci (mutant RNA) endogenously (Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, CA)\nTransfection reagent (lipofectamine, Invitrogen, cat. no. L3000001 or Nucleofector, Lonza, cat. no. VPD-1001)\nReagents for RNA-FISH:\n               \nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco, cat. no. 10010023)\n4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 158127) in PBS\n2% (v/v) cold acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 179124) in PBS\n30% (v/v) formamide (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

BP132520)\nCy3-labeled (CAG)10 anti-sense probe (Integrated DNA Technologies)\nSequence: 5′-/5Cy3/CAG CAG CAG CAG CAG CAG CAG CAG CAG CAG -3′\nHybridization buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-rec-0001])\nMounting medium without antifade (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, cat. no. H-1000-10)\nNo. 1.5 coverslips (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. NC1272770)\n6-well tissue-culture plate (Greiner Bio-One, CellStar, cat. no. 657160)\nLaser scanning confocal microscope e.g., Leica TCS SP5 X or a similar system with:\n63× oil immersion objective, numerical aperture, 1.4\nExcitation wavelengths: 488 nm for EGFP, 552 nm for Cy3\n500-550 nm emission filter for EGFP\n565-700 nm emission filter for Cy3\nAdditional reagents for transfection (Seidman, Struhl, Sheen, & Jessen, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0038]) or nucleofection (Lonza), for mammalian cell culture, and RNA-FISH (Rehman et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0036]) can be found in the cited references.\nPrepare plasmids, cell lines, transfection, slides for FRET\n1. To test FRET between RNA (mutant RNA) endogenously expressed in DM1 cells and protein (MBNL1), construct or obtain the expression plasmids (Fardaei, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0014]; Rehman et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0036]).",
    "Detailed protocols on cloning, manipulation and purification of plasmid DNA can be found elsewhere (Sambrook & Russell, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0037]). Make sure the fusion protein is in-frame with the EGFP or other VFP (visible fluorescence protein) if desired. Fusion at the C-terminus may work better than the N-terminus allowing proper protein folding of the target protein.\nEGFP and Cy3 are well-established FRET pairs (Fessenden, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0015]; Haj, Verveer, Squire, Neel, & Bastiaens, 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0019]; Rehman et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0036]; Wouters & Bastiaens, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0044]). However, new generation fluorophores with better quantum yield are now available which give the advantage to the researcher to pick and choose their FRET pairs. Before beginning to clone, select suitable FRET pairs (Bajar, Wang, Zhang, Lin, & Chu, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0003]; Day & Davidson, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0011]) for the designed experiments with higher quantum yield for the donor, better photostability, better spectral overlap, and integral and acceptable R0 values.\nFor labeling of RNA, consider using brighter alternatives to Cy3 like the Alexa dyes, such as Alexa Fluor 555 (ThermoFisher Scientific). For example, both Cy3 and Alexa Fluor 555 have similar excitation and emission spectra, but Alexa Fluor 555 is much brighter and more photostable than Cy3.\n2. Perform experiments to assess the functionality of the fusion protein and the mutant RNA.\nThese may include intracellular co-localization by fluorescence microscopy, RNA-IP to provide supportive biochemical evidence to FRET interactions, and rescue of an altered function after overexpression of the fusion protein in cells as previously performed by us (Rehman et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0036]).\n3. Construct or obtain plasmids to be used as negative FRET controls. In this case, unconjugated EGFP or an empty vector may be obtained (Clontech).",
    "4. Perform transfections (Seidman et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0038]) using standard transfection procedure or by nucleofection with the plasmids obtained in steps 1-3 to obtain five different coverslips of cells containing the following:\n         \nProtein-EGFP (MBNL1-EGFP) and RNA foci (mutant RNA); DA Positive Control.\nProtein-EGFP (MBNL1-EGFP); Donor Alone.\nRNA foci (mutant RNA); Acceptor Alone.\nUnconjugated EGFP and RNA foci (mutant RNA); DA Negative Control.\nUnconjugated EGFP; Donor Alone.\nNOTE: For FRET studies, transfection with 1 μg of plasmid DNA was sufficient in our hands.\n5. Allow the transfected cells to grow on no. 1.5 glass coverslips in a 6-well plate until the full expression of the plasmids are attained (24-48 hr).\nDetails on mammalian cell culture used in this protocol can be found elsewhere (Rehman et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0036]).\nAllow the cells to grow in humidified cell culture incubator with 5% CO2. Make sure the cells are attached or immobilized to the glass coverslips in the 6-well plate before FRET imaging to avoid out-of-focus or drift during image acquisition.\nCoverslips treated with collagen (collagen coating solution, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 125-50) may help in better attachment of primary cells and after nucleofection for imaging. Coverslips were placed in 6-well cell culture plate and the collagen coating was used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Briefly, 1 ml of the ready to use collagen solution was added to cover the entire cover glass for 2 hr at room temperature in a sterile hood. After the incubation, the coating solution was aspirated and air-dried overnight before using.\n6. Fix the transfected DM1 cells with 4% paraformaldehyde and proceed with RNA-FISH using a Cy3-labeled anti-sense oligonucleotide probe for the mutant RNA as described in detail by us (Rehman et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0036]) and mentioned here:",
    "Following fixation of DM1 cells, permeabilize the cells in cold 2% acetone in PBS for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells with PBS three times.\nIncubate the cells with 30% formamide in 2× SSC buffer at 37°C for 10 min.\nProceed with hybridization with Cy3 labeled (CAG)10 probe at 0.1 ng/µl for 2 hr at 37°C in the hybridization buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-rec-0001]).\nAfter the hybridization, wash the cells in 30% formamide in 2× SSC at 45°C for 30 min.\n7. After RNA-FISH, wash the DM1 cells with PBS (three times, 10 min each) and mount the coverslips on a glass slide with a mounting medium such as Vectashield without anti-fade. Seal the glass coverslip with a transparent nail paint, air dry and proceed with FRET imaging by the acceptor photobleaching method. Alternatively, Fluoromount G (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 00-4958-02) may be used as a mounting medium. It forms a semi-permanent seal and does not require the use of nail paint for sealing.\nUse of anti-fade reagents in the mounting medium will reduce the efficiency of acceptor photobleaching, a required step in this type of FRET methodology.\nConfigure the confocal microscope for EGFP and Cy3 imaging\n8. Prepare the Leica TCS SP5 X confocal microscope used here with WLL or with a comparable laser system for excitation with 488 nm and 552 nm laser lines.\nAdjust the laser power accordingly such that photobleaching could be quickly achieved without causing photobleaching of the fluorophores during normal image acquisition. In general, a weaker laser like the WLL could be used at 100% versus a stronger laser like Argon at 40 mW, where 25%-50% power should be sufficient.\n9. Select the magnification objective and zoom settings.",
    "In this case, a 63× oil immersion, numerical aperture 1.4 with 5× zoom was used to visualize the mutant ribonuclear foci in DM1 cells on a 512 × 512 resolution format.\n10. Make sure to have the correct filters and dichroic in the optical path for EGFP and Cy3 imaging. For the Leica TCS SP5 X, adjust the tunable Acousto-Optical Tunable Filters (AOBS) to 500-550 nm for EGFP and 565-700 nm for Cy3.\n11. Select PMT2 for EGFP and PMT3 for Cy3. Set the PMT gain to 650-750V.\nA PMT gain of 650v was used in this example to avoid any saturation of the de-quenched donor signal after acceptor photobleaching. As saturated signals are not included in the calculation of E%.\n12. Select 12-bit image on the acquisition-scan control window.\n13. Select sequential scan by frame for fixed cells (select line scan for live cells).\n14. Use the Leica AP wizard or a comparable workflow on a different system for acceptor photobleaching FRET.\nA generalized guide on FRET by acceptor photobleaching outlined in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-fig-0002] can be used as a reference for any FRET pair (live or fixed cells).\nFrom this step onwards, the term ‘EGFP channel’ will be used that will refer to 488 nm laser line excitation with 500-550 nm emission filter and an appropriate PMT detector; the term ‘Cy3 channel’ will be used that will refer to 552 nm laser line excitation with 565-700 nm emission filter and a PMT detector.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7c3733b0-fae0-41a8-a870-6513a039fbb7/cpz1689-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nA generalized guide for FRET by the acceptor photobleaching method.\nOptimization of the imaging parameters for dual confocal imaging of EGFP and Cy3",
    "Perform steps 15-20 on the slides with protein-EGFP and then Cy3 alone, and then again with the protein-EGFP slide. Optimization of imaging parameters (laser excitation, PMT gain, offset, and emission filters) are necessary to make sure that there is no bleed-through or crosstalk between the 2 channels, and that there is no photobleaching of the fluorophores during normal image acquisition. While selecting the field of view of cells for the experiment, check the morphology of the cells using the bright field or phase contrast function of the microscope. These steps are again repeated for the negative control unconjugated EGFP slide.\n15. Load the protein-EGFP (or EGFP) slide first on the microscope stage. Use the microscope ocular to find representative cells using a mercury vapor arc (or LED) lamp and the corresponding filter cube to EGFP or Cy3. Focus the cells to the center of the Field of View (FoV).\nCells will show some variability in the intensity of the fluorophores depending on the level of expression of RNA and protein. Avoid using higher intensity of the mercury lamp or fine focusing of the specimen as this will induce unwanted photobleaching of the fluorophores even before actual imaging. Fine focusing can be done later using “live” scan for EGFP or Cy3 channel in the confocal acquisition mode to find the right focal plane.\n16. Switch to the confocal acquisition mode. Use the settings for the EGFP channel as described above. To keep the thickness of the optical section for the EGFP channel identical to the Cy3 channel, first select the pinhole for EGFP to 1 airy unit and then do the same for the Cy3 channel. Turn on the 488 nm laser to 5%-20% acousto optical tunable filter (AOTF) depending on the intensity of the protein-EGFP (or unconjugated EGFP).",
    "Make sure there are no saturated signals using the “glow over under” feature on the Leica TCS SP5 X or another Leica system or checking the gray level intensity histograms for the ROIs/image on other comparable confocal systems.\n17. Both EGFP and Cy3 detectors can be kept ON to check for a bleed-through signal. Set the detector or PMT gain between 650-750v such that the gray level intensity does not exceed more than ∼2000 for EGFP and ∼3000 intensity units for Cy3 on a 12-bit image depth.\nThe PMT gain and the 488 nm laser excitation for the EGFP channel was optimized in such a way to avoid getting any saturated EGFP signals after photobleaching the acceptor, because those will be removed from the E% calculation (described below).\n18. If the gray level intensity of EGFP is lower, try increasing the PMT gain by an additional 50v and/or the 488 nm laser excitation by 1%-2%.\n19. Check the average background signal using the dark control, the untransfected cells, and select the offset if needed to reduce the background noise.\nIn this example the offset was set to zero. Sometimes, coating coverslips with an ECM like collagen may contribute to some background noise, and using offset becomes helpful. For live-cell imaging, phenol red-free or DMEM fluorobrite basal media (Invitrogen-Gibco, cat. no. A1896701) are recommended to keep background noise low (see Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-prot-0002]).\n20. Load the Cy3 slide and repeat steps 15-19 using the 552 nm laser to 10%-12% AOTF.\n21. Save the optimized imaging parameters (steps 15-20) and do not change for subsequent imaging.\nPerform the acceptor photobleaching",
    "Steps 22-25 are to be performed on slides a, b, c, d, & e prepared in step 4. First, to optimize the bleaching cycle proceed with “c” for the RNA foci-Cy3 acceptor alone (A) slide.\n22. Place the slide “c” with the RNA foci-Cy3 acceptor alone (A) specimen on the microscope stage. Using the microscope ocular, focus the cells to the center of the stage as described in step 15.\n23. Select the region of interest (ROI) over the RNA foci. Set up the bleaching cycle with the 552 nm laser with 100% AOTF. The bleaching cycle can be defined by activating the FRET AB wizard on the Leica TCS SP5 X or a similar workflow macro on a standard commercial confocal microscope as outlined in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-fig-0002]. A time series module in lieu of a wizard/macro could also be used to set up the bleaching cycle.\nIt is very important to optimize the bleaching cycle or number of iterations required to photobleach the acceptor molecules to background levels, such that the donor inadvertently will not be photobleached by the 552 nm laser line. In this example, the number of iterations used was 8 with the 552 nm laser with 100% AOTF.\nAlso, if photobleaching of the acceptor is quickly achieved, one need not use 100% of the 552 nm laser if the same level of photobleaching can be achieved using 75% of the laser power. Therefore, laser percentage and number of iterations are critical in determining the photobleaching cycle without photobleaching the donor.\nAlso, if the brighter, larger RNA foci aggregates are difficult to photobleach to background levels, the addition of a second laser line for the photobleaching cycle or by increasing the iterations may be employed.",
    "24. Once the acceptor bleaching cycle is optimized, donor alone slides with specimen “b” (protein-EGFP) and “e” (unconjugated EGFP) can be tested. Donor intensity prebleach and with the bleaching cycle can be quantified over time in targeted bleached and non-bleached ROIs using a time series module.\nThis will help to assess whether or not donor photobleaching is taking place during acceptor photobleaching versus normal donor image acquisition.\n25. If donor photobleaching is observed, reduce the 552 nm laser power and iterations as described in the section “critical considerations in acceptor photobleaching and donor image acquisition.” Also see Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-fig-0002].\nFRET data collection and calculation of efficiency of energy transfer (E%)\n26. Proceed with FRET data collection with the double labeled DA and control slides using the specimens a, b, d, and e from step 4, and the dark control with untransfected cells (for measuring the background noise) with the optimized settings described in steps 15-19 and 22-25. One can use the Leica TCS SP5 X AB wizard or a similar workflow as described below (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-fig-0002]). Image at least 30-40 cells for independent ROIs.\n27. Using the Leica TCS SP5 X AB wizard or a similar software for image quantification, draw a 2 × 2 pixel ROI over the RNA foci and quantify pre- and post-bleach intensities of donor and acceptor (as shown in Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-fig-0001]) for the slides a, b, d, and e from step 4.\n28. Calculate FRET efficiency (E%) in the targeted bleached ROIs using the formula formula:\n$E = ( {1 - D\\ Pre\\ bleach/D\\ Post\\ bleach} )*100$\n, where D is the donor intensity to get experimental (Expt)-E%.\n29. Calculate FRET efficiency (E%) in the non-targeted, non-bleached control (Ctrl) ROIs to get Ctrl-E%.",
    "30. Calculate Expt-E% and Ctrl-E% in all the 4 slides a, b, d, and e to assess whether or not FRET occurred between the target mutant RNA foci and MBNL1 protein as described under “Understanding Results.”\n31. A more generalized approach for carrying out FRET by acceptor photobleaching using any FRET pair is outlined below in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-fig-0002].",
    "The basic protocol is suitable for fixed cell applications because of the requirement of the RNA-FISH labeling step for visualization of the endogenous mutant RNA foci in DM1 cells. However, the basic protocol can be applied to live cells if the visualization of the endogenous RNA in living cells can be modified and achieved by other in vivo RNA labeling techniques, for example by the use of targeted oligonucleotide probes or molecular beacons as described elsewhere (Bao et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0004]).\nThe basic protocol can be applied to live cells if the targets (protein and RNA) do not exchange or diffuse rapidly. This can be checked by photobleaching protein and RNA separately in live cells and collecting time lapse images to see if there is recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching (Day & Davidson, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-bib-0011]). If there is recovery, follow the photobleaching step as described below.\nAdditional materials (also see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-prot-0001])\nDMEM fluorobrite (Invitrogen-Gibco, cat. no. A1896701)\nCollagen-coated glass bottom dishes (MatTek, cat. No. P35GCOL-1.5-14-C) for seeding cells for transfections, labeling, and live-cell imaging of protein and RNA\nLive-cell imaging chamber or heated stage inserts with humidified gas flow for maintaining live-cell imaging conditions\nIf the modified alternate protocol is used for the visualization of the protein-EGFP and RNA of interest in live cells, skip the steps of fixation and RNA-FISH (steps 6-7) and proceed to imaging in basic cell culture media without phenol red or other suitable imaging media like DMEM fluorobrite. Imaging in phenol red-free media is required to keep the background noise low.\nWhen performing photobleaching of the acceptor, use the whole or half of the cell to photobleach, such that all or most of the acceptor fluorescence signal will be destroyed after photobleaching.",
    "This is required to prevent the recovery of acceptor molecules from the vicinity into the targeted ROIs for FRET analysis which will otherwise confound the effect of acceptor photobleaching on the donor fluorescence and evaluation of E%. Another caveat for FRET by acceptor photobleaching in live cells could be the contribution of the EGFP donor “mobile fraction” from the vicinity which could lead to false positivity of FRET signal.\nPrepare plasmids, cell lines, transfection, and slides for FRET\nPrepare plasmids, cell lines, transfection, and slides for FRET as described in the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-prot-0001] (steps 1-5) and as mentioned above in the section “FRET in live cells” for labeling the endogenous RNA for live-cell imaging.\n1. For the alternate protocol skip the steps of fixation and RNA-FISH (steps 6-7) and proceed with live-cell imaging in phenol red-free or DMEM fluorobrite.\n2. Wash the cells (expressing the protein-EGFP and the labeled RNA) growing on the collagen-coated glass bottom dishes with PBS (three washes, 10 min each).\n3. Mount the culture dish with the cells in DMEM fluorobrite onto the microscope stage with the live-cell imaging chamber or heated stage inserts under humidified gas flow.\n4. Proceed with steps 8-30 as described in the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.689#cpz1689-prot-0001]."
