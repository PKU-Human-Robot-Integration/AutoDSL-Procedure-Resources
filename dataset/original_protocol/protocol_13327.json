    "The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital (grant number: 2021-224) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from next of kin to use the cadavers.\n1. Installation of angle measuring device\nTurn on the switch of the femur and tibia angle measuring device. Open the angle measurement software on the tablet computer, scan the QR codes of the two measuring devices, and click Bluetooth connection.\nPlace the two angle measuring instruments on the horizontal table, click the Calibration button to calibrate, and tie them with straps 10 cm above and below the knee to measure the flexion angle of the knee in real time (Figure 1).\n2. Standardized Oxford UKA osteotomy\nPlace a cadaver in the supine position with the lower extremities draped in flexion and abduction over the outside of the operating table.\nOpen the joint cavity by the medial parapatellar approach with a scalpel. Make a cut 3 cm distal to the joint line along the apex of the medial border of the patella, ending distally at 1 cm medial to the tibial tuberosity. Ensure the incision depth reaches the joint cavity.\nRemove osteophytes of the medial femoral condyle, intercondylar fossa, and anterior tibia using a rongeur.\nInsert different sizes of femoral sizing spoons to hook the posterior femoral condyle, and when the end of the spoon is about 1 mm away from the cartilage surface, the size of the femoral prosthesis corresponding to the spoon is suitable.\nSelect a 3 mm G-clamp. Connect the G-clamp, tibial saw guide, and femoral sizing spoon together. Ensure that the guide's shaft is parallel with the long axis of the tibia in both the coronal and sagittal planes, and the ankle yoke points toward the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine.",
    "Make vertical and horizontal cuts on the tibia. Use the reciprocating saw to make a vertical tibial saw cut. Ensure the cut is just medial to the apex of the medial tibial spine. Advance the saw vertically down until it rests on the surface of the saw guide.\nRemove the shim from the tibial resection guide and insert the slotted 0 shim. Use the oscillating saw blade to excise the plateau. Remove the slotted shim, lever the plateau up with a broad osteotome, and remove it with the knee in extension.\nMake a hole in the distal femoral condyle. Ensure the hole is situated 1 cm anterior to the anterior edge of the intercondylar notch and in line with its medial wall.\nInsert the intramedullary rod in the hole. Connect the femoral drill guide with the intramedullary rod. Perform femoral drilling with the help of the femoral drill guide.\nInstall the posterior resection guide and insert it into the drilled hole. Ensure the oscillating saw blade is guided by the underside of the posterior resection guide and perform the posterior femoral condyle osteotomy. Remove the guide and the bone fragment.\nExcise the medial meniscus. Leave a small cuff of the meniscus to protect the MCL. Completely remove the posterior horn.\nInsert a 0 femoral spigot. Attach the spherical mill onto the spigot and perform distal femoral milling.\n3. Preliminary assessment of the flexion-extension gap\nInsert a femoral trial. Assess flexion-extension gap by gap gauge.",
    "Use angle measurement devices to monitor the flexion angle. Define the appropriate flexion-extension gap balance by inserting the gap gauge into the joint space with slight resistance, and the perceived tension as almost equal when the knee is in the flex position at 20째 (extension gap) and 110째 (flexion gap). If the gaps are not equal, grind the femur according to the difference value between the flexion and extension gaps until they are equal.\n4. Application of sensor combination to measure flexion and extension gap pressure\nRemove the sensor magnetic induction power switch. Open the pressure measurement software on the tablet computer, scan the sensor QR code, and enter the measurement interface.\nClick the Connect Device button; the sensor will be automatically calibrated after successful connection.\nSelect the appropriate thickness cushion block according to the gauge specification. Put the sensor on the metal base and install the cushion block on the sensor (Figure 2).\nClick Start working on the tablet computer. Insert the wireless sensor combination into the medial compartment and fit the metal base to the tibial osteotomy surface (Figure 3).\nMeasure the flexion and extension gap pressure at 110째 (Figure 4A,B) and 20째 (Figure 4C, D) of knee flexion. Calculate the average values separately for three consecutive measurements.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
