  "procedures": [
    "This protocol follows the IACUC guidelines at Skidmore College for working with mice.\n1. Treatment with Water-soluble Compounds\nDissolve succinic acid to a concentration of 0.75 mg/mL in cage drinking water. Note that any water-soluble compound of interest at the desired concentration could be substituted at this stage. Stir solution to make sure that the compound is fully dissolved.\nAfter mice reach the desired age of treatment, replace the home cage drinking water of the treatment condition group with the solution in step 1.1.\nMeasure the weight of both treatment and control group water bottles daily to ensure that both treated and control mice are drinking the same amount of water. Use these measurements to calculate total drug dosage per cage. Continue the treatment throughout the experiment and monitor bottle weight.\n2. Footprint Analysis\nPlace the runway onto the floor or a table in a confined room. Set the runway at a slight upward angle towards the home box lined with bedding and reward food (e.g. sugary cereal). Line the length of the runway with a sheet of white paper. Allow the subject to acclimate in the home box for 5 min.\nRemove the subject from the home box and paint left and right hind feet, respectively, with blue and red non-toxic water-based paint. The paint prints will be used to calculate multiple output behavioral measurements.\nPlace the subject at the beginning of the runway and allow the subject to walk to the home box. Once the subject has reached the home box, close the trap door, and allow the subject to stay within the home box for one minute before returning to the respective home cage. Clean the runway and home box with 30% ethanol and replace the bedding, reward food, and runway paper for the next subject.",
    "Quantify number of strides, width of gate, angle of step, and number of turns taken by subject according to the analytical methods described previously 6. A successful footprint trial is defined as a minimum of 5 sequential footprints in which the subject is walking towards the goal box without turning around or stopping.\n3. Beam Analysis\nSet up beam apparatus according to the bar cross specifications described previously 6 with the following 6 beams: beam 1 = rectangular, 28 mm width; beam 2 = round, 28 mm diameter; beam 3 = rectangular, 12 mm width; beam 4 = round, 12 mm diameter; beam 5 = rectangular, 6 mm width; beam 6 = round, 6 mm diameter. At one end of the beam, set up a darkened home box with reward food.\nTo train subjects on the beam, assemble the apparatus with beam 3. Gently place the subject on the end of the beam opposite to the home box, and allow the subject to walk across. Allow each subject up to three 2-min trials to achieve a successful run, defined as crossing the beam and entering the home box within 2 min. In between trials, let the subject rest in the home box for 2 min. In between subjects, clean the beam and home box with 30% ethanol and replace the reward food in preparation for the next subject.\nRepeat step 3.2 once per day for the next two days resulting in a total of 3 sequential training days. The testing day, day 4, should sequentially follow the training days.",
    "To test the subjects on day 4, first assemble the apparatus with beam 1 and set up the home box as described in step 3.1. Place a video camera in front of the apparatus and verify that the full beam apparatus can be clearly captured on video. Begin recording and place the first subject on the beam opposite to the home box, allowing up to 3 2-min attempts to successfully complete a trial. In between trials, allow subject to rest for 2 min in the home box.\nContinue to test subject on each of the six beams in numerical order, allowing the subject to rest for 2 minutes in the home box before beginning the next beam. Between subjects, clean each beam and the home box with 30% ethanol and replace the reward food in preparation for each subject.\n\t\nVideotape each trial and record the number of successful trials per subject per beam as follows: '1' indicates the subject was successful on the first trial, '2' indicates the subject was successful on the second trial, '3' indicates the subject was successful on the third and last trial, and '4' indicates the subject was not successful on any of the three trials.\nUse video recordings of trials measure footslips by scorers who are blinded to the experimental conditions of the subject. Define a footslip as the hindfoot that is in direct view of the camera dipping below a theoretical midline across the length of the beam. Average footslip scores from multiple scorers.",
    "To analyze the number of successful trials and number of footslips data, calculate the mean and standard error within each genotype and experimental condition cohort. Conduct one-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons post-hoc analysis to determine if there is an effect of the treatment and genotype on number of successful trials and number of footslips.\n4. Accelerating Rotarod\nAcclimate subjects to the assay room 10 min prior to the start of the trial. During this acclimation period, prepare the rotarod apparatus, cleaning each lane of the apparatus with 30% ethanol.\nOpen the rotarod software and set start settings to 4 rpm, acceleration settings to 5 min and final speed settings to 40 rpm. These settings provide a constant acceleration from 4 - 40 rpm over a period of 5 min. Mice can remain on the rotarod at 40 rpm for an additional 5 min beyond the acceleration period for a maximum run length of 10 min.\nPost-acclimation, place subjects onto the rotarod in their respective lanes while the rod is rotating at 4 rpm. Once all subjects are in their respective lanes, begin the first trial. Record the latency to fall using the instrument software; a secondary timer can be employed as a backup.\nFollowing trial completion, allow each subject to rest in their respective lane reservoirs for ten minutes prior to the next trial to prevent fatigue.\nRepeat steps 4.3 and 4.4 for a total of four trials.\nRepeat steps 4.3 - 4.5 for a total of four consecutive days, continuing treatment throughout the trial period. Upon completion, quantify latency to fall off the rotating rod for each trial per subject 6.\n5. Cerebellar Extraction and Fixation",
    "Euthanize mice via carbon dioxide asphyxiation according to institutional IACUC guidelines. Place subject into the carbon dioxide chamber, and release carbon dioxide into the chamber. Watch the animal at all times during the euthanizing step and do not leave the animal unattended.\nOnce breathing has ceased and subjects show no remaining pain perception by hind foot pressure, remove subject from chamber and make a superior midline incision through the epithelial tissue from the middle of the skull caudally to the base of the skull through epithelial tissue.\nUsing dissection scissors, cut the skull from the base at the spinal cord through the sagittal suture to the bregma. Cut laterally through each coronal suture before pulling off the frontal, parietal and interparietal bones using blunt forceps.\nUse blunt forceps to break off bone lateral to the cerebellum. Use forceps to separate the cerebellum from the colliculi and brainstem and extrude it from the rest of the tissue. Separate the cerebellum into left and right hemispheres with forceps.\nImmediately place right cerebelli into liquid nitrogen to save for HPLC analysis and left cerebelli into pre-chilled 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for tissue fixation. Harvest any other tissue of interest before severing the aorta and discarding the carcass according to institutional IACUC rules.\nCAUTION: PFA is a highly toxic, flammable, and corrosive.\nTwenty-four hours post-extraction, wash tissue fixed in PFA (4% in PBS) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (three times, 5 min/ wash) before placing the tissue into 30% sucrose at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\n6. Immunopathology Assay\nAttach the tubing of a sledge microtome to a sink faucet and a temperature control box. Use the temperature control box to cool the microtome stage to -25 °C. Set the sectioning thickness dial to 50 µm.",
    "NOTE: If the dial on the sledge microtome does not reach 50 μm, set the dial to a thinner setting and multiply the thickness by shifting the setting accordingly (for example set the dial to 10 µm and shift five times before sectioning for a total thickness of 50 µm).\nDab a dime-size portion of Optimal Temperature Cutting (OTC) solution onto the stage. Before the OTC freezes, use forceps to position the hemisphere so that the mid-sagittal cut surface is face down on the OTC layer. Working quickly, gently orient the tissue with forceps so that the lateral tip of the hemisphere is pointed towards the blade, superior to the stage. Allow the OTC to freeze completely.\n\t\nWorking in layers, add additional OTC around the tissue allowing the OTC to freeze fully before adding the next layer. Add a thin layer of OTC on top of the tissue and freeze.\nSection the tissue, distributing equal body weight onto the cutting blade while sectioning. Collect sections using a fine artist paintbrush and place into an appropriately labeled well-plate containing 1x PBS. Between sections, re-set the cutting thickness on the sledge microtome dial, if necessary, to 50 µm.\nReplace the PBS in each well of the well-plate with urea solution [0.01 M urea in PBS] and place the plate on ice. When ready, remove the plate from ice and boil sections in urea solution three times for 15 s each time to unmask epitopes for immunolabeling. This step can be easily accomplished by placing the plate on a heating block set to boiling temperature. Between each boiling step, cool the plate containing the tissue sections on ice.",
    "NOTE: If performing the urea, blocking, primary antibody, secondary antibody and DAPI steps in a 96-well plate, use 100 μL volumes throughout. If a different sized well is used, adjust the reagent volumes accordingly. In lieu of a heating block, a microwave can be used to boil tissue samples in urea. Microwave samples on a high power setting for three 15 s intervals.\nPost boiling, wash sections three times, each time removing present solution, replacing the solution with 1x PBS and agitating for 10 min.\nBlock sections with donkey serum solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% triton X-100 in PBS) by incubating tissue in serum for one hour with gentle agitation at room temperature. Remove donkey serum solution.\nLabel sections with 0.2 µg/mL anti-calbindin and 1:2,000 anti-ataxin-1 antibody (11NQ)16 in donkey serum solution and incubate at 4 °C for 72 h with gentle agitation.\nWash sections with PBS as in step 6.5 before incubating sections in appropriate secondary antibody (1:500 Alexa Fluor-488-anti-goat and 1:500 Alexa Fluor-594-anti-rabbit antibodies diluted in donkey serum solution) at 4 °C for 48 h with gentle agitation.\nWash sections three times with PBS as in step 6.5 before labeling cell nuclei with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindol) solution diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL in PBS. DAPI incubation should not exceed ten minutes. Remove solution and wash with PBS as in step 6.5.\nMount tissue onto 2% gelatin-coated slides with mounting medium to reduce photobleaching. Coverslip and seal with nail polish.",
    "With a scanning confocal microscope locate the primary fissure of the cerebellum under brightfield light. With a 10X UIS2 objective, scan and sequentially excite DAPI, AlexaFluor-488 and AlexaFluor-594 channels using a 405 nm diode laser, a 488 nm argon gas laser and a 559 nm diode laser, respectively, in conjunction with a DM488/559 nm dichroic beam splitter. Separate and collect emitted light using SDM490 and SDM560 beam splitters and a BA575-675 bandpass filter, respectively.\n\t\nFor each channel, construct a z-stack within the primary fissure with z = 20 μm and step = 0.1 μm. Use the post-processing software provided with the confocal microscope to add in a size marker to the final image.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternative lasers, filters and fluorophores can be substituted based on availability. If AlexaFluor-488 or AlexaFluor-594 detection is weak, a gallium phosphide (GaAsP) high-sensitivity detector can be employed to boost the signal if available.\n7. Quantifying Molecular Layer Thickness and Purkinje Cell Numbers\nUsing ImageJ, open a z-stack image of stained primary fissure and split each image into its red, blue and green channels by selecting 'Image' from the Menu Bar, 'Color' from the Image tab and 'Split Channels' from the Color tab.\nCreate a max Z projection of each channel that was split. When the channel image of interest is open, select 'Image' from the Menu Bar, 'Sections' from the Image tab and 'Z-project' from the 'Sections' tab. Within the 'Z-project' command menu, select 'Max Z projection' and click 'Okay'. Repeat for each channel.\nOpen the Cell Counter plugin by selecting 'Plugins' from the Menu Bar, 'Analyze' from the Plugins tab and \"Cell Counter\" from the Analyze tab.\n\tNOTE: ImageJ and the ImageJ Cell Counter plugin can be downloaded at the websites provided in the Table of Materials and Equipment.",
    "Quantify the number of Purkinje cells by counting ataxin-1-labeled nuclei that lie along a pre-determined 200 µm stretch of anterior and posterior lengths of the primary fissure. Use the threshold map by selecting 'Image' from the Menu Bar, 'Adjust' from the Image tab and 'Threshold' from the Adjust tab to make a threshold map of the channel of interest (red in the case of ataxin-1 labeled nuclei).\n\t\nChoose a pixel range that can be normalized throughout the quantification (31-225 pixels for example). Discard noise from the images by checking the \"Dark Background\" box in the Threshold window. Image signal can be inverted for ease of counting.\nQuantify molecular layer thickness in the green channel using the 'Split Channels' and 'Threshold Map' tool as in Steps 7.1 and 7.2. Using the size marker on each image as a guide, randomly measure three molecular layer lengths within each of two designated 200 µm stretches of each primary fissure image. Make measurements from the proximal end of the Purkinje dendritic arbor at the base of the Purkinje soma to the distal end of the Purkinje dendritic arbor.\nRecord Purkinje cell counts and molecular layer thickness as means plus or minus the standard error. Perform one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons post-hoc analysis to test the effect of treatment conditions or genotype on the number of cells and the length of the dendritic arbor.\n8. HPLC Analysis of Cerebellar Succinic Acid Concentrations Post-treatment\nPreparation of Sample for Analysis\nWeigh each harvested right cerebellar hemisphere prior to use in HPLC analysis. Mince hemispheric halves one at a time in a pre-chilled dounce homogenizer and add 0.5 mL of 75:25 (by volume) water:methanol solution to each homogenized half 17.",
    "Using a narrow pre-chilled homogenizer, grossly break up tissue with 5 dounce strokes. Continue to finely mince each tissue sample with a wider homogenizer, applying 20 dounce strokes.\nTransfer the homogenates to pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube. After each sample, rinse the homogenizer with 0.5 mL of ice-cold water:methanol solution and add the rinse to the microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge homogenate samples at 1,300 x g for 30 min at 25 °C and collect the supernatant in a clean microcentrifuge tube.\nFilter the supernatant through a centrifugal filter unit housed with a regenerated cellulose filter of 10 kilodalton (kDa) nominal molecular weight limit. If not immediately running HPLC analysis, store filtered samples at -80 °C.\nHPLC Instrumentation and Conditions\nAttach an ion exclusion chromatography column with a length of at least 30 cm and a particle size of 7 µm to a high performance liquid chromatograph.\nPrepare and degas a sufficient quantity of 1 mM acetate buffer adjusted to a pH of 5.\nSet the HPLC with a mobile phase velocity of 0.8mL/min. If using a UV-vis detector, select a detector wavelength of 224 nm. Typical elution times for succinic acid under these conditions are between 10 and 12 min.\nRunning and Analyzing Standards and Samples\nPrepare a set of standards in acetate buffer mobile phase with succinic acid concentrations between 0 and 250 ppm.\nRun each standard and prepare a calibration curve using the peak area measured from each run.\nOnce an accurate standard curve is obtained, run previously prepared samples diluted in acetate buffer. For greater accuracy of measurement, samples can be spiked with known concentrations of succinic acid that have been diluted in the mobile phase. Run all samples in triplicate.",
    "Analyze HPLC chromatograms to determine the succinic acid concentration of the samples by using the calibration curve and then multiplying by sample volume and dividing by original sample mass.\n9. Ex Vivo  Analysis of Cerebellar Mitochondrial Functionality Using an Oxygen Electrode Control Unit\nCreate a Clark-type electrode using a commercially available system by first applying a drop of potassium chloride (50% KCl w/v) solution on the platinum cathode, cutting a 1.5 cm2 piece of commercial tobacco rolling paper and gently placing the paper over the platinum cathode.\n\t\nCover the cathode and surrounding anode with a 2.5 cm2 piece of polytetrafluoroethylene (P.T.F.E) paper and snuggly secure both membranes with O rings, making sure there are no folds or bubbles within the membranes. Drip 50% KCl solution into the surrounding well.\nSecure the premade electrode into the assay chamber and fill with air-saturated water. Heat the chamber to 30 °C, add a 0.8 cm stir bar to the solution and stir at 70 rpm using the instrument software. Calibrate the chamber by establishing zero oxygen. To do so, serially add a few crystals of the reducing agent sodium dithionite to the solution.\n\t\nOnce calibration is achieved, wash the chamber once with 70% ethanol, and then wash six times with deionized water before allowing the chamber to acclimate in 1.5 mL of respiration buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 100 mM mannitol, 10 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM Na2EDTA, 60 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]) 7.\n\t\tNOTE: all traces of sodium dithionite must be completely removed during the wash steps before attempting to measure oxygen concentrations during the respiration experiments.",
    "Gently homogenize the weighed cerebellar hemispheres in 0.5 mL of homogenate buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]). Transfer homogenate to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and keep chilled until beginning the assay.\nAdd the homogenate to the chamber, reaching a final volume of 2 mL. Permeabilize the cerebellar homogenate by adding 40 µL of digitonin or saponin (5 mg/mL); allow homogenized tissue to incubate for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Digitonin and saponin are toxic, and incubation times should be kept to a minimum.\nTo begin recording oxygen consumption, determine mitochondrial function through activation and inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation chain using substrates and inhibitors, respectively (3 min recordings per substrate).\n\t\nAdd substrates using clean syringes as follows: 10 µL 2 M glutamate [final concentration (f.c) 0.01 M], 5 µL 0.8 M malate [f.c. 2 mM], 20 µL 0.5 M adenosine diphosphate (ADP) [f.c. 5 mM], 1 µL 1 mM rotenone [f.c. 0.5 µM], 20 µL 1M succinic acid [10 mM], 1 µL 5 mM antimycin A [f. c. 2.5 µM], 1 µL 0.8 M ascorbate [f.c. 0.4 mM], and 5 µL 0.2 M tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD). [f.c. 0.5 mM] When adding substrates to the chamber be careful not to introduce air bubbles into the system.\n\t\tNOTE: Detailed information on the functional effect induced by each substrate and inhibitor is described in a previously published protocol 7. Individual dose-response curves may need to be generated to determine optimal concentrations of the substrates and inhibitors in preparations/tissues/species not previously studied. Likewise, the protocol can be optimized for the innate metabolic tendencies of the tissue/species being studied, such as substrate preferences.",
    "Once data collection is completed, gently aspirate the cerebellar homogenates and clean the chamber with ethanol and deionized water. Once clean, additional cerebellar homogenate samples can be run without additional calibration for as long as the P.T.F.E. membrane remains intact. After final completion, clean electrode with deionized water and ethanol and store with silica gel or desiccant.\n\tNOTE: Between same-day runs, fill the chamber with deionized water ensuring that the membrane does not dry out.\nUsing the data sheet created by the instrument software, export 40 min of respiration data beginning two minutes post substrate addition to a spreadsheet program.\nCalculate the rate of respiration per substrate or inhibitor. Normalize data by dividing the total respiration by the respiration rate during the ascorbate-TMPD substrate addition.\n\tNOTE: The respiration rate can be further normalized to the protein content of the tissue which may be particularly desirable in neurodegeneration experiments in which the tissue content may vary. To do so, reserve 50 μL of the sample homogenate (from step 9.3) for use in a standard protein assay.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
