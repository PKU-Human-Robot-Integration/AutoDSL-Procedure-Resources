    "The zebrafish core facility at Tampere University has an establishment authorization granted by the National Animal Experiment Board (ESAVI/7975/04.10.05/2016). All the experiments using zebrafish embryos were performed according to the Provincial Government of Eastern Finland, Social and Health Department of Tampere Regional Service Unit protocol # LSLH-2007-7254/Ym-23.\n1. Setting Up of Overnight Zebrafish Mating Tanks\nPlace 2-5 adult male zebrafish and 3-5 adult female zebrafish into mating tanks overnight. (Breeding is induced in the morning by automatic dark and light cycle overnight).\nSet up several crosses to obtain enough embryos for assessing the toxicity of more than two chemical compounds. For the evaluation of toxicity, each concentration needs a minimum of 20 embryos23.\nTo avoid handling stress to the animals, allow the animals to rest for 2 weeks before using the same individuals for breeding.\n2. Collection of Embryos and Preparing Plates for Exposure to the Chemical Compounds\nCollect the embryos, the next day before noon, using a fine-mesh strainer and transfer them onto a Petri dish containing E3 embryo medium [5.0 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, and 0.1% w/v Methylene Blue].\nRemove debris using a plastic Pasteur pipette (e.g., food and solid waste). Examine each batch of embryos under the stereomicroscope to remove the unfertilized/dead embryos (identified by their opaque appearance).\nKeep the embryos at 28.5 °C in an incubator. Examine the embryos, the next morning, under a stereomicroscope and remove any unhealthy or dead embryos. Also, replace the old E3 medium with fresh E3 medium.\nNOTE: Zebrafish embryos are always maintained at 28.5 °C under laboratory conditions. \nCarefully transfer 1 embryo into each well of a 24-well plate containing enough E3 medium to cover the embryos.",
    "3. Preparations of the Stock Solution of Chemical Compounds and Distribution of Diluted Compound into the Wells\nTake out the vials containing inhibitor compounds stored at 4 °C.\nNOTE: Depending on the properties of the compound, these are stored at different temperatures.\nWeigh the compound(s) using an analytical balance that can weigh a few milligrams (mg) of the compound accurately.\nPrepare at least 250 μL (100 mM) of stock solution for each compound in an appropriate solvent (e.g., E3 water or Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), based on the solubility properties of the compounds.\nNOTE: The above steps can be done a day before the start of the experiment at a convenient time and stored at 4 °C).\nMake serial dilutions of the stock solutions (e. g., 10 μM, 20 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM, 150 μM, 300 μM and 500 μM) using E3 water in 15 mL centrifuge tubes.\nNOTE: The concentrations and number of serial dilutions vary from one compound to another compound depending on their toxicity levels.\nFrom the 24 well plate containing embryos, remove E3 water from the wells using a Pasteur pipette and a 1 mL pipette (containing 1 dpf embryos) one row at a time.\nDistribute 1 mL of each diluent in each well (starting from lower and moving to higher concentration) into the wells of 24-well plate.\nSet up a control group from the same batch of embryos and add the corresponding amount of diluent.\nLabel 24-well plates with the name and concentration of the compound and keep the plates at 28.5 °C in an incubator.\n4. Phenotypic Analysis and Imaging of the Embryos Using a Stereomicroscope\nExamine the embryos under a stereomicroscope for parameters 24 h after exposure to the chemical compounds.",
    "Note the parameters such as mortality, hatching, heartbeat, utilization of yolk sack, swim bladder development, movement of the fish, pericardial edema, and shape of the body23.\nTake the larvae exposed to each concentration of the compound and lay them sideways in a small Petri dish containing 3% high molecular weight methyl cellulose using a metal probe.\nNOTE: The 3% methyl cellulose (high molecular with) is a viscous liquid needed for embedding the fish with a required orientation for microscopic examination. For orienting the fish in this liquid, a metal probe is needed.\nTake the images using stereomicroscope attached to a camera. Save the images in a separate folder each day till the end of the experiment.\nEnter all the observations in a table each day either in an online table or on a printed sheet.\nIf the compounds are neurotoxic, the 4 to 5 dpf larvae may show altered swim pattern, make a record of such changes either by capturing a short (30 s to 1 min) video of the larvae exhibiting abnormal movement pattern.\nAfter 5 days of exposure to the chemical compounds, note the concentration at which half of the embryos die for calculating the half maximal lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of each chemical.\nNOTE: The LC50 is the concentration at which 50% of the embryos die at the end of 5 days of exposure to a chemical compound. Use a minimum of 20 embryos for testing the toxicity of each concentration of a compound23.\nConstruct a curve for mortality of embryos for all the concentrations using a suitable program.\nSubscription Required.
