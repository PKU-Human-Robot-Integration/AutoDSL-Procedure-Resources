    "1. Installation and testing\nDownload required dependencies: Bowtie222 and RNAfold23. Compiled packages are recommended.\n\t\nDownload Bowtie2, a read mapping tool, from its home site (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml[href=http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml]).\nDownload RNAfold, a tool of the Vienna package used to predict RNA secondary structure, from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/[href=http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/].\nBefore installing miRDP2, ensure that these two dependencies are correctly installed, and customize the bash environment file (e.g., .bashrc) to set a correct PATH for these two dependencies.\n\t\tNOTE: Other mapping tools such as Bowtie24 are also suitable to miRDP2; either Bowtie or Bowtie2 can be used after version 1.1.3.\nTo download the miRDP2 package, go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/mirdp2/files/latest_version/[href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/mirdp2/files/latest_version/] and fetch the tarball files.\nBefore installing miRDP2, make sure that Perl is in the PATH. To install miRDP2, extract all contents of the downloaded tarball file into one folder (command lines as in 1.4.2), and then set the folder path into the PATH.\n\tNOTE: A computer or computing node with at least 8 GB RAM and 100 GB storage are recommended to run miRDP2.\nTest the MiRDP2 pipeline.\n\t\nTo test whether miRDP2 has been correctly installed, use the test data and the expected output found in https://sourceforge.net/projects/mirdp2/files/TestData/[href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/mirdp2/files/TestData/]. Test data contain one formatted GSM sequencing file and one Arabidopsis thaliana genome file.\nMove all downloaded files to the current working directory:\nmv miRDP2-v*.tar.gz TestData.tar.gz ncRNA_rfam.tar.gz <user_selected_folder>\ncd <user_selected_folder>\nExtract the compressed tarball files:\ntar –xvzf miRDP2-v*.tar.gz\ntar –xvzf TestData.tar.gz\ntar –xvzf ncRNA_rfam.tar.gz\nBuild the Arabidopsis genome reference index:\nbowtie2-build -f ./TestData/TAIR10_genome.fa ./TestData/TAIR10_genome\nBuild the ncRNA reference index:\nbowtie2-build -f ./ncRNA_rfam.fa ./1.1.3/script/index/rfam_index\nRun the miRDP2 pipeline:\nbash ./1.1.3/miRDP2-v1.1.3_pipeline.bash –g ./TestData/TAIR10_genome.fa -i ./ TestData/TAIR 10_genome –f ./TestData/GSM2094927.fa –o .",
    "NOTE: Linux commands used are in bold and italic fonts, with command line options in italics. *indicates the version of miRDP2 (the current version is 1.1.3). The bowtie2-build command should take roughly 10 minutes, and the miRDP2 pipeline should finish within several minutes\nCheck testing outputs.\n\t\nNote that a folder named 'GSM2094927-15-0-10' is automatically generated in <user_selected_folder>, containing all intermediate files and results.\nCheck that the tab-delimited output file GSM2094927-15-0-10_filter_P_prediction, the final output of predicted miRNAs, contains columns that indicate chromosome id, strand direction, representative reads id, precursor id, mature miRNA location, precursor location, mature sequence, and precursor sequence. Note the additional bed file derived from this file to facilitate further analysis.\nCheck the file \"progress_log\", which provides information about finished steps, and the files \"script_log\" and \"script_err\", that contain program output and warnings.\n\t\tNOTE: Currently, we have tested miRDP2 on two Linux platforms, including CentOS release 6.5 on a cluster server, and Cygwin 2.6.0 on PC Windows system, and miRDP2 should work on similar systems that support Perl.\n2. Identifying novel miRNAs\nBefore running the pipeline, ensure that the input reads are preprocessed into proper format.\n\tNOTE: The new version 1.1.3 of miRDP2 can accept original FASTQ format files as inputs, although the process of formatting reads is carried out as in previous versions.\n\t\nFirst, remove adapters from the 5' and 3' ends of the deep sequencing reads (if present).\nSecond, parse the deep sequencing reads into FASTA format.\nThird, remove redundancy such that reads with identical sequence are represented with a single and unique FASTA entry.",
    "Finally, ensure that all of the FASTA identifiers are unique. Each sequence identifier must end with a '_x' and an integer, indicating the copy number of the exact sequence that was retrieved in the deep sequencing datasets. One way to ensure unique FASTA identifier is to include a running number in the ID. For reference, see the file GSM2094927.fa in the test data (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mirdp2/files/TestData/[href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/mirdp2/files/TestData/]).\nSee the following for examples of correctly formatted reads:\n\t\t>read0_x29909\n\t\tTTTGGATTGAAGGGAGCTCTA\n\t\t>read1_x36974\n\t\tTTCCACAGCTTTCTTGAACTG\n\t\t>read2_x32635\n\t\tTTCCACAGCTTTCTTGAACTT\nBuild reference indices.\n\t\nFor the genome reference, to save time, download Bowtie2 index files from the iGenomes website (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html[href=https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html]) if the genome sequences of the species of interest have been indexed. Otherwise, users index reference sequences and keep the index file for a while till the project is finished since the genome sequence might need to be re-indexed. Details on how to index a genome reference are included in bowtie2 manual (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml[href=http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml]).\nAnother non-miRNA ncRNA index is also needed to filter out noisy sequences from other non-coding RNA fragments. The file is a collection of main ncRNA sequences from Rfam, including rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA. To build this index, please refer to part 1.4, as the index should be placed and named correctly, i.e. <miRDP2_version>/script/index/rfam_index.\nRun miRDP2.\n\t\nTo use miRDP2 to detect new miRNAs from deep sequencing data, run the bash script in the package to start the analysis pipeline (An example can be found in step 1.4):\n<path_to_miRDP2_folder>/miRDP2-v*.*_pipeline.bash –g <genome_file> -i <path_to_index/index_prefix> -f <seq_file > -o <output_folder>",
    "where * indicates the version of the pipeline bash script. There are three parameters that can be modified: 1) the number of different locations a read could be mapped to, 2) the mismatch number for running bowtie2, and 3) the threshold of RPM (Reads Per Million). Modify these using the –L, -M, and –R options, respectively. A detailed explanation is in section 3.1.\nCheck the miRDP2 outputs.\n\t\nNote that the output folder will be automatically generated under <output_folder>, and named '<seq_file_name>-15-0-10'; the last 3 numbers indicate the values (default in this case) for parameters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The file <seq_file_name>_filter_P_prediction contains information of the final predicted miRNAs satisfying the newly updated plant miRNA annotation criteria. Details on the format of output file are described in part 1.4.\n3. Modifications and caution using miRDP2\nParameters that can be modified\n\t\nUse the '-L' option to set the limit of how many locations a read could be mapped to (parameter 1). Read mapping to too many sites are possibly associated with repeat sequences, and are not likely to miRNAs. The default setting is 15. For specific species, if there are miRNA families with many members, the first parameter may be increased manually to adapt to the genome landscape.\nUse the '-M' option to set the allowed mismatches for bowtie (parameter 2). The default setting is 0.\nUse the '-R' option to set the threshold for reads potentially corresponding to mature miRNAs (parameter 3). To reduce time consumption and false-positives, filter reads by RPM. Only reads exceeding a certain RPM threshold may represent mature sequences of miRNAs rather than background noise, and would be kept for further analysis. The default setting is 10 RPM.",
    "Note that changing these parameters can potentially affect performance and time consumption. In general, an increase of parameter 1 and 2 and a decrease of parameter 3 would generate a less stringent result and longer running time and vice versa.\nRedundancy and miRNA*\n\t\nNote that the output miRNAs from miRDP2 may differ from the known miRNAs. We found that this is mainly due to one of two reasons: heterogeneity of the mature miRNAs or the relative abundance of miRNA and miRNA*. We found that this does not impact the optimal length selection of precursors and the profiling of known miRNA genes.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
