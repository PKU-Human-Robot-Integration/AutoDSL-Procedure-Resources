    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue collection\nTiming: 3 h (to process 20 animals)\nThis step details how to collect and store mouse ear pinnae tissue that harbors primary fibroblasts.\nAliquot 5–10 mL of tissue wash buffer into one sterile 15 mL centrifuge tube for each sample. Alternatively, aliquot 15 mL if tissue samples will be shipped. Maintain centrifuge tubes on ice.\nEuthanize each C57BL/6Nia mouse according to the procedures approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). In our lab, mice are euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.\nNote: Our cohorts of 20 animals consist of young (4 months) and old (20 months) male and female C57BL/6Nia mice.\nAfter ensuring euthanasia, liberally spray the mouse with 70% ethanol, making sure that the fur on and around the ear pinnae is wet.\nCritical: Mouse fur is a rich source of mycobacteria and other microbes. Aside from acting as a disinfectant, the ethanol makes it easier to shave fur off any part of the corpse.\nUsing a razor blade, shave as much of the fur on and around each ear pinna as possible. Once complete, cut off each ear pinna with sterilized scissors and transfer tissues to the corresponding centrifuge tube on ice. Clean your tweezers and scissors with ethanol between each animal.\nNote: Though the ear pinnae are not fur rich, shaving the fur that is present reduces the chances of contamination.\nNote: If other tissues are being harvested, the ear pinnae can be cut and shaved elsewhere in order to increase tissue harvesting efficiency. However, shaving the ear pinnae in this manner may be slightly more difficult.\nContinue collecting ear pinnae tissue from the remaining mice, ensuring that tissue remains submerged in tissue wash buffer and that centrifuge tubes remain on ice.",
    "Note: To simplify handling of the tissue, we recommend collecting each ear pinna as a single piece. However, cutting each ear pinna into smaller pieces should not alter the extraction efficiency.\nNote: For each independent animal, we collect both ear pinnae in a single tube. However, we have successfully extracted primary fibroblasts using a single ear pinna. Hereafter, we consider the contents of any given tube as an independent sample.\nPause Point: If tissues will be shipped, seal the 15 mL centrifuge tubes with parafilm and place in an appropriate box filled with ice or cold packs. Alternatively, tubes can be maintained at 4°C for a few days prior to the next step. We have extracted primary fibroblasts successfully and in high yields after storing samples up to 3 days. The next set of steps will involve extracting, expanding, and freezing primary fibroblasts over the next ~3.5 weeks (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/541-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Timeline of primary fibroblast culture protocol\nPrimary fibroblasts migrate out of the diced ear pinnae tissue over the course of 10 – 14 days. After filtering out the tissue, these cells are expanded and passaged three times. Cultures are frozen at the end of passage 3 and thawed when needed for experiments. P0 – P3 correspond to Passages 0 – 3. IGM: initial growth media. EGM: expansion growth media. FM: freezing media. LTCM: long-term culture media.\nEthanol washes, tissue dicing, initial plating, and cell extraction\nTiming: 3 h (to complete plating tissues)\nThis step details how to disinfect, dice, and maintain ear pinnae tissue in order to promote primary fibroblast isolation and growth while limiting microbial contamination.",
    "Prepare 6-well suspension plates in order to conduct an ethanol-ethanol-buffer sequential wash of the tissues. For each independent animal, fill two wells each with 5 mL of 70% ethanol and one well with 5 mL of tissue wash buffer.\nTo ease handling of tissues, remove tubes from the fridge or from ice and transfer tissues, along with some buffer, to a separate, empty set of 6-well suspension plates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Clean tweezers with 70% ethanol prior to the transfer of each independent sample.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/541-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Ear pinnae tissue before and after dicing\n(A) Ear pinnae are initially shaved to remove excess fur and are transferred to 6-well plates prior to washing with 70% ethanol.\n(B) Ear pinnae are sequentially washed twice in 70% ethanol, cleaned of excess ethanol, and washed in tissue wash buffer.\n(C) After washing with ethanol, ear pinnae tissue is diced into finer pieces, which are then cultured with 3 mL of initial growth media to promote fibroblast adherence.\n(D) Initially, no cells are visible when plates are visualized under a microscope. Scale bar, 250 μm.\nBegin the sequential wash by transferring tissues to the first ethanol-filled well and wash for 5 min at 18°C–25°C using a rocker (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTransfer tissues to the second ethanol-filled well and wash for 5 min at 18°C–25°C using a rocker (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nOnce the second ethanol wash is complete, use tweezers to temporarily remove tissues from their wells and press them against a clean paper towel to absorb excess ethanol. Once excess ethanol has been removed, immediately transfer tissues to the third well with tissue wash buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Temporarily store plates at 4°C until ear pinnae are ready to be diced.",
    "Fill a new beaker with fresh 70% EtOH to maintain autoclaved tweezers. Place all needed materials in the biosafety cabinet. From the fridge, remove and process the samples one 6-well plate at a time.\nFor each independent sample, transfer only the tissue from both ear pinnae to a sterile 10 cm petri dish. Add a few drops of tissue wash buffer to keep the tissue moist. If needed, use an autoclaved razor blade to trim any remaining fur.\nWith a second pair of autoclaved razor blades, and away from any fur, dice the tissue into many smaller fragments. Aim for most fragments to be 1–3 mm x 1–3 mm in size.\nOnce the tissue is fragmented, resuspend the diced tissue with 3 mL of initial growth media and transfer to a 10 cm tissue culture dish. Gently agitate the plate to distribute tissue fragments and incubate the plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C, and 2D).\nContinue trimming, dicing, transferring, and incubating the remaining samples. Incubate the plates without disturbance for three days.\nCritical: During the first three days, primary fibroblasts will migrate out of some tissue fragments and adhere to the tissue culture plate. As more primary fibroblasts crawl out, the tissue fragments will themselves become increasingly attached to the plate. Any disturbances to the plate will inhibit attachment and reduce extraction efficiencies.\nNote: We extract primary fibroblasts from tissue fragments of both ear pinnae of an experimental animal. However, we have successfully extracted cells using only one pinna.",
    "Check the plates after three days. At this time, a few primary fibroblasts may be observed under the microscope (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). Additionally, tissue fragments that are not floating in solution are indicative of a likely successful cell extraction. If there are signs of microbial contamination, such as the media turning yellow or turning opaque or visible fungal outgrowths, discard immediately.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/541-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Primary fibroblast extraction over 10 days\nThe number of fibroblasts that migrate out of each tissue fragment is a function of time. A few cells may be seen after 3 days of culture (A and B), though cells become easily visible after 7 days (C and D). After ~10 days (E and F), the clusters of cells surrounding each tissue fragment begin becoming confluent, and cells should be passaged soon after. Cells are visualized at (A, C, and E) 5× and (B, D, and F) 10× magnification on the left and right images, respectively. Scale bar, 100 μm or 250 μm respectively.\nNote: We have not experienced contamination issues with this protocol thus far. Omitting the ethanol steps or the inclusion of Normocin, however, has increased the likelihood of contamination in our hands.\nRemove the remaining media and gently add 10 mL of fresh initial growth media (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Minimize agitation of tissue fragments that have attached to the plate. Continue incubating the plates in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "Remove old media and add fresh initial growth media again at seven days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Larger, more noticeable clusters of primary fibroblasts should be noticeable around many tissue fragments (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D). Continue culturing cells for, at most, another week, making sure to replace initial growth media every 2–3 days. Once many confluent clusters are observed on a plate (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F), continue to the next step. If no or few dense clusters are observed after two weeks, the extraction was likely unsuccessful for those samples, and they can be discarded.\nCritical: Large, elongated, “myocyte-like” cells sometimes co-extract with primary fibroblasts. Since these cells do not grow efficiently in the outlined conditions, passaging the cultures several times before storage or usage will deplete cultures of these alternative cell types and enrich for primary fibroblasts (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/541-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. “Myocyte-like” cells co-extract with primary fibroblasts\nDuring Passage 0, “myocyte-like” cells may appear. The first three passages are important since primary fibroblasts replicate relatively quickly and become enriched in culture, while other cells have a growth disadvantage and become increasingly depleted. The same cells are visualized at (A) 5× and (B) 10× magnification. Arrows indicate myocyte-like cells. Scale bar, 100 μm or 250 μm respectively.\nFirst passage (P0 -> P1) and fibroblast expansion (P2 and P3)\nTiming: 2 h (per passage of 20 samples)\nThis step details how to filter purify and maintain cells in order to enrich primary fibroblasts and deplete other cell types.\nAfter ~10–14 days, passage the cells for the first time (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nBegin by aspirating the culture media.\nWash cells twice with 2.5 mL of HBSS.\nAdd 3 mL of 0.25% trypsin to each plate and incubate for ~ 6 min at 37°C.",
    "Critical: Cells are grown in media with a high concentration of FBS, which, if not diluted sufficiently, will slow or inhibit the trypsinization. At least two washes are recommended.\nCheck the plates. If a few clusters of cells remain attached, these can be liberated by gently tapping the plates. Once most cells are unattached, neutralize the trypsin with 6 mL of 10% FBS-containing media.\nTransfer solutions to sterile 15 mL centrifuge tubes and spin down at 500 × g and at 18°C–25°C for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 9 mL of expansion growth media.\nTo remove the tissue fragments from solution, begin by attaching 70 μm MACS SmartStrainers to sterile 15 mL centrifuge tubes, one per sample. Pre-wet the strainers with 1 mL of expansion growth media.\nAfterwards, pass the 9 mL of cell-tissue suspensions through the strainers and allow the tissues and cells to separate by gravity filtration for a few seconds.\nFinally, transfer the filtered cell suspensions to 10 cm tissue culture dishes, designating these cells as Passage 1 (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/541-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Primary fibroblasts after Passage 1\nPrimary fibroblasts at one day after Passage 1, visualized at (A) 5× and (B) 10× magnification, and at five days after Passage 1, visualized at (C) 5× and (D) 10× magnification. Note that the cell strainer has removed all tissue fragments previously present in the media. Also note that cells are ready to be passaged a second time within a few days after the first passage. Scale bar, 100 μm or 250 μm respectively.\nContinue incubating the plates in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nReplace the media every 2–3 days until cells reach confluency (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D).",
    "Carry out the second passage at ~17 days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Passage the cells 1:4, as described here (without the use of a strainer).\nOnce cells become confluent during Passage 2 at ~20 days, split each sample among four plates (Passage 3) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The cells from these four plates will be frozen and stored long-term once they reach ~90% confluency.\nCell storage\nTiming: 6 h (to process 4 plates × 20 samples)\nThis step details how to cryopreserve primary fibroblasts so that cells may be used at a later date.\nCells are frozen after ~23 days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Begin by filling the Mr. Frosty Boxes with 2-Propanol, if not already filled. Replace the alcohol after the fifth use.\nDissociate the cells by trypsinization as before, neutralize trypsin, combine cell suspensions corresponding to the same sample in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, spin the cells down, and aspirate the supernatants.\nResuspend cells in freshly prepared freezing media, 1 mL per plate. Aliquot cell suspensions into cryovials, 1 mL per vial. Place the vials in the Mr. Frosty Boxes and store at −80°C.\nNote: The Mr. Frosty Boxes will slowly cool the cells at about −1°C per minute, the optimal rate for cell preservation.\nOnce the Mr. Frosty Boxes have chilled 12–16 h, transfer vials from the −80°C freezer to a liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage.\nCell thawing\nTiming: 2 h (to process 20 cryovials)\nThis step details how to resuscitate primary fibroblasts from cryopreservation so that they may be used for experiments.\nPre-warm a bottle of long-term culture media in a water or bead bath at 37°C.\nRapidly thaw the contents of frozen vials of fibroblasts in a 37°C water bath. Once thawed, quickly spray the vials liberally with 70% ethanol before transferring to the biological hood.",
    "Immediately combine the 1 mL of each cell suspension with 10 mL of pre-warmed long-term culture media in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCritical: This step is necessary for the removal of DMSO from the media in order to maximize cell health and recovery from cryopreservation.\nPellet cells at 500 × g in a centrifuge at 18°C–25°C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant, resuspend cells in 10 mL of pre-warmed long-term culture media, and transfer the resuspended cells to a 10 cm tissue culture dish.\nAfter 24 h, the cells are ready to be passaged and used for experiments. From this point on, 0.05% trypsin should be used to minimize cell stress.\nOptional: Purity of the obtained cell culture can be confirmed using flow cytometry (see below).\nFibroblast identity validation by flow cytometry (optional)\nTiming: 2 h (to process 6 samples and a control)\nThis step details how to stain cells and assess primary fibroblast culture purity by flow cytometry using a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 benchtop flow cytometer.\nNote: We assess purity by staining for the following: 1) the pan-fibroblast marker CD140a, (also known as PDGFRα) (Lynch and Watt, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], Guerrero-Juarez et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], Salzer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), 2) the alternative fibroblast surface marker CD90.2, (also known as THY1.2), which correlates with an activated fibroblast signature (Croft et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), and 3) the pan-immune marker CD45. We define fibroblasts as CD45- CD140a+ cells. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A for an overview of the gating strategy and the results for a representative sample.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/541-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Flow cytometry analysis of the identity of post-Passage 3 cultures\nPassage 3 cryopreserved primary fibroblasts were thawed and analyzed 24 h later by flow cytometry. Data was analyzed with Flowlogic v8.",
    "(A) Gating strategy applied to a representative culture of primary fibroblasts (derived from a young 4 months-old male). Debris is first gated out from the FSC-A vs. SSC-A plot of the entire population. Single cells are then gated based on the FSC-A vs. FSC-H plot. From this singlet population, CD45- cells are obtained by gating on the CD45 vs FSC-A plot. Finally, we use this CD45- population to gate for CD90.2+ and CD140a+ cells.\n(B) Same gating strategy as in (A) applied to a population of peritoneal lavage cells, which should contain a large fraction of immune (CD45+) cells.\n(C) Fibroblast cultures from three 4 months-old males and females were analyzed by flow cytometry, and a beeswarm plot was generated for the percentage of cells staining for combinations of immune (CD45) and fibroblast (CD90.2 and CD140a) markers.\n(D) The same plot as in (C) but for a population of peritoneal lavage cells as a CD45+ control population.\nWash the fibroblast layer twice using 10 mL DPBS.\nThen, detach cells by applying 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin, and incubate for 7 min in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nOnce most cells have detached, neutralize the trypsin with 8 mL of long-term culture media (10% FBS-containing media).\nCollect detached cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, pellet cells at 500 × g and at 18°C–25°C for 10 min in a centrifuge. Wash cells with 10 mL of resuspension buffer.\nAgain, pellet cells at 500 × g and at 18°C–25°C for 10 min in a centrifuge. Resuspend cells in 1 mL of resuspension buffer. Count cells and cell viability using Trypan Blue exclusion and a Countess cell counting apparatus.",
    "Aliquot 300,000 cells per culture into 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tubes for staining. Also, similarly reserve cells for the unstained and single-stained controls to draw the gates. For ease, the unstained and single-stained controls can be combined into an equi-cellular mix of all populations to be tested, and this mix can be used to define the flow cytometry gates.\nOptional: To have a CD45+ (pan-immune) control for gating, peritoneal lavage cells can be obtained by injecting and then recovering 10 mL of PBS (with 3% BSA) in the peritoneal cavity of a euthanized mouse. Alternatively, a cell line with known expression of CD45 (e.g., RAW267.4) can also be used. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B for an application of our gating strategy to a population of peritoneal lavage cells.\nPellet cells at 500 × g and at 18°C–25°C for 10 min in a centrifuge. Resuspend cells in 50 μL of flow cytometry staining buffer. Block cells by incubating at 4°C for 10 min.\nFor each sample that will be stained, prepare 50 μL of a 2× antibody solution in flow cytometry staining buffer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_541_8.csv\nAdd the 50 μL of 2× antibody solution to the 50 μL of blocked cells. Stain cells by incubating at 4°C for 20 min in the dark.\nWash away excess antibody by adding 2 mL of resuspension buffer and then pellet cells by centrifuging at 500 × g and at 18°C–25°C for 10 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 2 mL of resuspension buffer for a second wash, and again pellet cells by centrifuging at 500 × g and at 18°C–25°C for 10 min.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of resuspension buffer per 100,000 cells.\nOptional: Add 1 μL of propidium iodide (PI) per 100 μL of sample to quantify and exclude dead cells.",
    "Run samples through a MACSQuant 10 flow cytometer. Unstained samples and single-stained samples are used to set appropriate gates that have clear positive and negative populations. Debris, dead cells, and doublets are excluded based on scatter signals and optionally PI staining (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C for example data on fibroblasts from 3 young female and 3 young male animals)."
