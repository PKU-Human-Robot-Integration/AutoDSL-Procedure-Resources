    "Construction of codon altered sequencesRoughly 1,000 nucleotides of RNA sequence are required to support the hybridization of twenty bDNA trees and 8,000 fluorophores. Targets that contain less than the full complement of bDNAs can still be detected by flow cytometry but require higher copy numbers to achieve the same resolution.For viral RNAs, when possible, scan the literature for any structural information available to determine which areas of the genome are the least likely to contain essential RNA secondary structures. If possible, also choose a region that has convenient cut sites for insertion of your codon-altered sequence. We chose to clone three codon-altered regions of the JFH1 genome because we anticipated decreased viability from some of the codon-altered strains.GeneArt is a product offered through Thermo Fisher Scientific and can be used to synthesize genes up to 9,000 bp in length (https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cloning/gene-synthesis/geneart-gene-synthesis.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cloning/gene-synthesis/geneart-gene-synthesis.html]). The GeneArt homepage offers several tools, including the gene optimizer tool. Use the gene optimizer algorithms to design codon-altered sequences with wild-type viral RNA sequence as your template. We submitted three regions of JFH1 that were all roughly 1,000 nucleotides in length and flanked by convenient cut sites. The optimizer tool was able to alter nearly 25% of nucleotides in all three cases.The newly synthesized sequence will arrive incorporated into a plasmid with a defined antibiotic-resistance marker. At this time, your codon-altered gene fragment can be subcloned into a plasmid that encodes the viral genome using restriction digestion and ligation.Target Probes that differentiated viral RNA sequences were designed and manufactured by Affymetrix (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) for use with both the ViewRNA and PrimeFlow platforms (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181016/20181016193335_2966.jpgFigure 1. Detection of target RNAs using branched DNA technology. Branched DNA technology for RNA detection can be coupled with confocal microscopy or flow cytometry.",
    "Target RNAs are first bound by pairs of Target Probes. Typically, twenty sets of target probe pairs are designed per target RNA. The Pre-Amplifier DNA only binds target probe pairs that are bound to target RNAs in the correct orientation; this greatly limits the signal to noise ratio. Pre-Amplifier DNAs are then bound by Amplifier DNAs and subsequently by Label Probes. This process results in the labeling of target RNAs by up to 8,000 fluorophores.Collection of codon-altered JFH1 virus stocksThe pJFH1 plasmid encodes the full-length genome of the JFH1 strain of HCV. The wild-type plasmid and all codon-altered versions contain an XbaI cut site at the 3’ end of the genome. Digest 5 μg of plasmid DNA with 20 U of XbaI in the CutSmart Buffer provided in a final reaction volume of 25 μl. Incubate digestions at 37 °C for 2 h.Purify linearized DNA using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, as per manufacturer’s protocol.Using 1 μg of linearized plasmid as your template, perform in vitro transcription with the MEGAscript T7 kit to make full-length genomic viral RNA. Incubate in vitro transcription reaction at 37 °C for 6 h. The temperature and duration of this incubation can be altered for optimal yield of individual transcripts.Isolate synthesized viral RNA using Trizol as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Resuspend vRNA pellet in 50 μl of RNase-free water.Seed 107 Huh7.5.1 cells into a 10 cm tissue culture plate and incubate overnight.To electroporate 10 μg vRNA into 107 Huh7.5.1 cells to produce continuous HCV cultures:Wash Huh7.5.1 cells with 5 ml PBS.Add 2 ml of Trypsin and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.Add 5 ml of 10% FBS media and harvest cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube.Centrifuge cells at 400 x g for 4 min.Resuspend cell pellet in 5 ml of PBS.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 400 x g for 4 min.Resuspend cell pellet with 5 ml of CytoMix. Cytomix recipe can be found below under “Recipes”.Centrifuge cells at 400 x g for 4 min.Resuspend cell pellet in 400 μl of CytoMix and transfer to a 4 mm GenePulser cuvette.Mix 10 μg of viral RNA into cell suspension inside cuvette and gently pipet up and down to mix.Electroporate RNA-cell mixture using the Bio-Rad GenePulser XCell. Settings set to 950 μF capacitance, 270 V, ∞ resistance and 4 mm cuvette size.Allow cells to rest at room temperature for 10 min.Transfer electroporated cells to a fresh 10 cm culture dish with 10 ml of 10% FBS media (see Recipes).Culture electroporated cells for up to two weeks in 10% FBS media, passaging every 3-4 days as required. As you passage, expand the culture. Typically, cultures of 107 electroporated cells are expanded into either five or ten T150 flasks. This gives HCV time to spread and generates a culture with a higher percentage of cells that are infected and productively synthesizing progeny virus. Further expansion of cells to larger capacity can be done if needed.Convert JFH1 cultures to Human Serum Media (Steenbergen et al., 2013). Growth of HCV in human serum has two benefits. First, Huh7.5.1 cells differentiate and cease cell division, therefore trypsinization and biweekly passage are no longer required. Instead, virus containing cell supernatants can simply be collected biweekly and directly replaced with fresh medium. Second, growth in Human Serum Media increases viral yield by 10 to 100-fold.Simultaneous infection with two HCV strains and detection of co-infected cells with Prime-FlowThe description of this protocol has been adapted from the PrimeFlow Assay user’s manual.Huh7.5.1 cells are seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 105 cells per well using 1 ml of 10% FBS media.",
    "In our hands, JFH1 cultured in human serum media can produce viral titers of 105-106 focus forming units (FFU) per ml. Infect Huh7.5.1 cells at a multiplicity of infection of one virus particle per cell with both wild-type and codon-altered JFH1. This often equates to roughly 1-2 ml of each virus preparation. A total volume of 4 ml can be used carefully in 12-well plates.Incubate infected cells in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 4-6 h. Following initial incubation, remove virus-containing media by aspiration. Replace media with fresh 10% FBS media and incubate infected cells for 72 h.Replace 10% FBS media with fresh 10% FBS media that either contains antiviral drugs or vehicle and incubate infected cells for 24-36 h.Aspirate off media containing antivirals or vehicle and wash cells with 1 ml PBS.Harvest infected cells by treating cells with 0.5 ml trypsin and incubating at 37 °C with CO2 for 5 min.Inhibit trypsin by adding 1 ml of 10% FBS media to each well. Harvest all cells and transfer to one of the 1.5 ml microfuge tubes supplied in the PrimeFlow Assay kit.Spin cells at 400 x g for 5 min.Aspirate off media and trypsin, being careful not to lose any cells. This is achieved by only aspirating down to the 100 μl marker on the side of the Eppendorf tube. Wash cells with 1 ml of Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer. Vortex and spin at 400 x g for 5 min.Aspirate Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer and fix cells using 1 ml of Fixation Buffer 1 at 4 °C for 30 min.Spin cells at 800 x g for 5 min.Resuspend cells in 1 ml of Permeabilization Buffer.

Incubate at 40 ± 1 °C for 2 h. We use a heat block in our 40 °C incubator to increase heat conduction to the tubes and protect from large fluctuation in heat (Figure 2). This incubation can be extended from 2 h to overnight. Longer incubations periods allowed for all amplification steps, flow cytometry and data analysis to be completed the following day.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181016/20181016193350_2720.jpgFigure 2. 40 ± 1 °C incubator setup.

Reagents setup for confocal microscopy. Huh7.5.1 cells are plated onto Micro Cover Glass within a 12-well tissue culture plate. These cells are infected following a 24 h incubation to allow cell adherence to the glass. Following infection, the cells are fixed, stained for protein and RNA using the ViewRNA Cell Plus Assay kit, all within the 12-well plate. The Micro Cover Glass is then carefully transferred to a Microslide spotted with PermaFluor/DAPI using fine forceps.Co-infect cells with wild type JFH1 and codon altered JFH1 at a multiplicity of infection equal to one virus per cell.At 6 h post infection, aspirate inoculum and replace with 1 ml of 10% FBS media.At 24 h post infection, wash cells 2 x with 1 ml of PBS.Add 400 μl of Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer to each well and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Wash cells 3 x each with 800 μl of PBS.Overlay cells with 400 μl of Blocking/Antibody Diluent and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Dilute primary antibody in 400 μl Blocking/Antibody Diluent as required.
