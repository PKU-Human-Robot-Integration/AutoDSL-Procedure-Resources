    "Preparation of GST-tagged anti-GFP NanobodyHere we introduce the method for preparing GST-tagged anti-GFP Nanobody. Under our conditions, we usually purify approximately 1 mg of the protein from 200 ml of E. coli culture.Pick up a single colony of E. coli carrying pGEX6P1-GFP-Nanobody, and inoculate a starter culture of 3 ml of LB medium plus 50 µg/ml ampicillin in a test tube with the colony, and incubate it overnight at 37 °C with vigorous shaking at 150-200 rpm.Inoculate a flask containing 200 ml of LB medium plus 50 µg/ml ampicillin with 2 ml of the overnight culture, and incubate it at 37 °C with shaking at 130 rpm until the culture reaches OD600 = 0.5. (It takes 2-4 h.) To induce expression of GST-tagged anti-GFP Nanobody, add 200 µl of 100 mM IPTG (to a final concentration 0.1 mM) to the flask, and incubate the flask for 4 h at 30 °C with shaking at 130 rpm.Transfer the culture to an appropriate centrifuge tube, and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 5,550 x g (e.g., 6,000 rpm in a Himac CR22G centrifuge) for 15 min at 4 °C.Pour away the supernatant and suspend the cells in 10 ml of binding buffer (see Recipes) by vortexing.After transferring the cell suspension to a 50 ml tube, disrupt the cells by sonication. Sonication is performed on ice for 5 rounds (15 sec ON and 15 sec OFF) at 30% amplitude using Astrason S4000.Add 0.5 ml of 20% Triton X-100 diluted in H2O to the tube to a final concentration of 1%, and incubate it for 20 min at 4 °C (or on ice) to help cell lysis.Centrifuge the tube at 20,700 x g (e.g.",
    ", 12,000 rpm in a Himac CR22G centrifuge) for 20 min at 4 °C, and transfer the supernatant to a 15 ml tube. Note: We usually divide the supernatant into 2 x 5 ml. Hereafter we use 2 tubes.Add 2.5 ml (bed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads equilibrated in PBS(-) to 5 ml of the supernatant, and allow binding of the Nanobody to the beads by rotating the tube overnight at 4 °C (12-24 h).Centrifuge the tube at 780 x g (e.g., 2,000 rpm in an EX-136 centrifuge) for 2 min at 4 °C, and remove the supernatant by aspiration.Add 10 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (see Recipes) to the precipitate.Repeat Steps A10 and A11 eight times.Keep the beads as a 1:1 slurry in the washing buffer (namely, 2.5 ml of the beads and 2.5 ml of the washing buffer). The beads can be stored for several months at 4 °C. Note: We usually divide the beads slurry into 1 ml (bed volume 500 µl) aliquots.Check the quality and estimate the quantity of purified GST-tagged anti-GFP Nanobody by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. Under our preparation conditions, approximately 1 µg/5 µl (bed volume of beads) of the Nanobody protein is purified. A typical result is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180102/20180102004906_7697.jpgFigure 1. A typical result of purified GST-tagged anti-GFP Nanobody. Purified GST-tagged anti-GFP Nanobody and BSA were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining. By comparing the band intensity of the purified protein with that of BSA, the concentration of purified GST-tagged anti-GFP Nanobody was estimated to be approximately 1 μg/5 μl (bed vol.).VIP assayHere we introduce how to perform the VIP assay (Figure 2 and Video 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180102/20180102005038_2911.jpgFigure 2. Overview of VIP assay. Expression vectors for GFP-fusion and RFP-fusion proteins are co-transfected into HEK293T cells.",
    "After 24 h, expression of fluorescent proteins is confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Next, lysates of the transfected cells are prepared, and processed for immunoprecipitation using GST-tagged anti-GFP Nanobody beads. Finally, the beads bearing immunoprecipitates are observed under a fluorescence microscope. When two proteins interact with each other, both GFP and RFP signals are detectable on the beads. On the other hand, when the two proteins do not interact, only GFP signals are observed.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Demonstration of VIP assay. The video shows how to perform the VIP assay.Seed HEK293T cells (approximately 8 x 105 cells) into a 6-well plate and incubate them for 24 h in 2 ml of DMEM high glucose supplemented with 5% FBS.Co-transfect the cells with expression vectors for GFP-fusion and RFP-fusion proteins using a PEI Max reagent (see Recipes).Mix 250 µl of Opti-MEM with 4 µg of DNA in a 1.5 ml tube (e.g., 2 μg of a GFP expression vector and 2 μg of an RFP expression vector). Mix 250 µl of Opti-MEM with 10 µl of 2 mg/ml PEI Max reagent in another 1.5 ml tube, and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Mix the DNA solution with the PEI Max solution by vortexing, and incubate it for 20 min at room temperature.Add 500 µl of the DNA/PEI mixture to each well of the 6-well plate.After 24 h, check the expression of GFP-fusion and RFP-fusion proteins by observing the cells under a fluorescence microscope.Remove completely the medium from the plate by aspiration, add 250 µl of ice-cold HNTG buffer (see Recipes) to each well, and incubate the plate for 5-10 min on ice to detach adherent cells.Suspend the cells by pipetting, transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 ml tube, and incubate the tube for 15 min on ice to lyse the cells.",
    "Centrifuge the tube at 16,100 x g (e.g., 13,200 rpm in a 5415 R centrifuge) at 4 °C for 15 min. Transfer 200 µl of the supernatant to 0.2 ml 8-Tube Strips containing GST-tagged anti-GFP Nanobody prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (approximately 5 µl (bed volume) of the beads), and incubate the 8-Tube Strips for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation using a tube rotator.Centrifuge the 8-Tube Strips for 30 sec, and remove the supernatant by aspiration. Add 180 µl of ice-cold HNTG buffer, and mix the content by tapping the 8-Tube Strips. Repeat Steps B8 and B9 three times.Finally, suspend the beads in 180 µl of ice-cold PBS(-), and transfer the beads suspension to a 96-well plate.Observe green and red fluorescence on the beads under a fluorescence microscope, and acquire images. To compare the fluorescence intensity, images are acquired under fixed conditions (exposure time and ISO sensitivity of the camera).Collect the beads if immunoblotting is required."
