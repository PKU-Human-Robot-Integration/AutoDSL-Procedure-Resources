    "Setting up the culture (Figure 1)Grow Streptomyces coelicolor in 5 ml ISP1 media in sterile 50 ml glass flask loosely covered with aluminium foil in shaking incubator (180 rpm) at 28 °C overnight. Notes:  The incubation temperature is specific to S. coelicolor and may need to be adjusted for other bacterial species.Include springs in the growth media to disperse the mycelia and reduce clumping.Add 150 μl of this culture to 600 μl modified MOPS minimal media in sterile 1.5 ml tubes.Disperse the mycelia well by vortexing and pipetting and transfer 200 μl to two sterile 1.5 ml tubes. From this step forward, handle samples behind a radiation shield and follow appropriate practices for handling and disposal of radioactive materials. Only certified personnel authorized by the radiation safety office of their respective institutions should handle the radioactive materials.To both 200 μl culture samples, add 1.7 μl of 32P-labelled orthophosphate (total 30 µCi) and grow the culture in the shaker incubator for 6 h (OD600 0.4-0.6) at 28 °C. Add 75 μl of 100 mM serine hydroxamate to one of the tubes and add 75 μl of sterile dH2O to the other tube.Mix well and incubate at 28 °C in the shaker incubator for 15 min.Centrifuge the samples at 10,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, add 25 μl of 13 M formic acid to the pellet and resuspend the pellet by vortexing. Note: Use of ice-cold formic acid will stop the metabolic activity rapidly. If possible, estimate the weight of the pellet by subtracting the weight of the empty tube from the weight of the tube with the pellet before adding formic acid and adjust the amount of formic acid used to resuspend the pellets if needed. Discard the supernatant immediately, otherwise the pellet will loosen.",
    "For cell lysis, incubate on dry ice for 1 min and on ethanol bath at room temperature for 1 min. Repeat step 9 four times. Incubate the samples on ice for 30 min.Vortex the samples well and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10-15 min at 4 °C. Store the supernatant in 1.5 ml tubes at -20 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161031/20161031223944_5356.jpgFigure 1. Setting up the cultureSetting up thin layer chromatography (Figure 2)Pour 1.5 M KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) buffer into a TLC chamber such that it forms a thin layer (~0.5 cm) at the bottom (50 ml used here) and close the lid in order for the buffer vapors to saturate the chamber (at least 30 min).Note: Allow sufficient time for the KH2PO4 buffer vapors to saturate the TLC chamber before inserting the PEI-cellulose plate. This process may be facilitated by first cutting filter papers to a size smaller than that of the PEI-cellulose plates and immersing them in the 1.5 M KH2PO4 buffer. Place the soaked paper against the sides of the TLC chamber to let the vapors diffuse evenly throughout the chamber. Saturating the chamber will prevent the mobile phase from evaporating as it migrates up the plate.Using a pencil, draw a line approximately 1 cm from the bottom of the PEI-cellulose plate and make fine dots on it approximately 2 cm apart to mark spots for sample loading. Notes: If a smaller TLC chamber is used, cut the PEI-cellulose plates into an appropriate size so that it fits inside the chamber with the lid closed. A covered beaker can substitute for a conventional TLC chamber.Do not poke the brittle PEI cellulose plates while drawing the baseline and dots. Do not use ink-pen, as the dye may migrate with the mobile phase. Avoid touching the surface of the PEI cellulose plate.",
    "Use an amount of buffer that is just sufficient to immerse the bottom of the PEI-cellulose plate below the drawn baseline; the buffer should not touch the sample application line.Thaw samples (item 13 above) and spot 1 μl of the sample onto the fine dots on the baseline and air dry for 2-4 min. Note down the sample spotted at each point. Note: For less concentrated samples and to get a denser spot of the nucleotide species, add increments of 1 μl to the same spot with intermittent air drying. Allowing each aliquot to dry before applying a second aliquot will prevent the diffusion of the sample that would occur if a greater volume were added at once.Place PEI-cellulose plate in the chamber, which should be placed on a level surface such that the base of the TLC plate is evenly immersed in the buffer.Close the lid and allow the mobile phase buffer to migrate until it is near (but not above) the top of the plate (about 3 h). Take out the plate, mark the top of the buffer front with a pencil to identify the distance migrated by the mobile phase, then air dry the plate for 15 min or longer.Place the plate in a clean cassette exposing the radioactive surface to a phosphor screen for 24 h or more depending upon the intensity of the 32P signal. Scan the exposed phosphor screen on a phosphorimager and save the image.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161031/20161031224407_8797.jpgFigure 2. Setting up TLC"
