    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nColonic lamina propria mononuclear cell isolation\nTiming: 6 h\nThis step describes dissection of the colon from colitic mice and the isolation of cells from the lamina propria, a layer of connective tissue that houses many of the gut’s immune cells. This layer will be digested, and the cells isolated using enzymatic digestion.\nDissect the entire length of the colon by making an incision at the anus and another immediately below the cecum. Remove the colon and wash it by briefly submerging it in 1× PBS to remove any excess blood.\nLay the colon flat on a paper towel and remove fecal contents by pushing them out using forceps.\nWet the forceps to make it easier to handle the colon and squeeze out the fecal contents.\nClean the forceps after every sample.\nRemove as much fat attached to the colon as possible with forceps.\nCut the colon vertically and fold open the tissue to expose the lumen.\nTransfer the colon into a 50 mL conical tube containing ice-cold Buffer A.\nVortex the tube for 10 s and then store it on ice.\nOnce all colons are collected and stored in the 50 mL conical tube containing Buffer A, add 10 mL of the pre-warmed Buffer C containing DTT to a 25 cm2 flask (one per tissue).\nPlace a metal tea strainer on a large beaker. Briefly, vortex each 50 mL tube with colon tissue in Buffer A and then pour it out over the strainer to remove the buffer.\nLay the colon tissue flat on a paper towel for a few seconds to remove any remaining buffer.\nTransfer the colon tissue to the flask containing 7.5 mL of the pre-warmed Buffer C with DTT.",
    "Critical: For multiple samples, work quickly to minimize the time difference between samples and to avoid longer digestions for earlier samples.\nFirmly close the flasks now containing the tissue with caps and cover them tightly with parafilm to prevent leakage.\nHorizontally place the sealed flasks with the colons into a 37°C incubating shaker immediately and secure them using tape to prevent them from falling.\nIncubate for 20 min in the incubator at a shaking speed of 180 rpm.\nIf the incubator isn’t at 37°C prior to adding samples, add 5 extra minutes to each incubation.\nDuring the incubation, thaw the Liberase and DNase I aliquots at 37°C. Once thawed, prepare 10 mL per mouse of the enzyme solution (scale up as needed). Keep the enzyme solution at 37°C.\nWhen the incubation is over, place the flasks on ice immediately to stop the reaction.\nLay the colon tissue on a paper towel for a few seconds to remove buffer.\nTransfer the colon tissue to another 50 mL conical tube containing 10 mL of ice-cold Buffer A.\nVortex briefly, then pour buffer and colon over the tea strainer.\nTransfer the colon tissue to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nChop each tissue with a pair of clean scissors for 1.5 min.\nWhen chopping the colonic tissue, take care not to scratch the bottom or sides of the tube as the small tissue pieces may get stuck.\nWipe scissors between samples with paper towels and clean buffer.\nAdd 900 μL of cold Buffer B to each tube. Dip the scissors in the suspension to remove any remaining tissue pieces. Keep on ice until all the samples are processed.",
    "Once chopping is done for each sample, finger-flick the tube and check if any large pieces of tissue remain. If so, chop the tissue for another minute or two.\nSpin down the Eppendorf tubes with tissue at 2,800 × g for 1 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, slowly remove the supernatant and the fat floating at the top as much as possible. Go in a circular motion from the top to bottom.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL of the pre-warmed Enzyme Solution. Close the lid firmly, vortex to disrupt the pellet, and carefully pour the suspension into a new 7.5 mL flask.\nRepeat this step three times with a total of 3 mL of the Enzyme Solution (X-VIVO 15 with liberase and Dnase I) per tissue.\nAdd 7 mL of the pre-warmed Enzyme Solution to each flask to bring up the final volume to 10 mL per tissue sample.\nClose the tubes firmly and cover the caps tightly with parafilm.\nPlace the flasks in the incubator shaker horizontally and secure them using tape.\nIncubate at 37 °C at 120 rpm for 40 min.\nIn the last 5 min of the incubation, meanwhile, add 10 mL of ice-cold Buffer A into a separate 50 mL tube with a 100 μm cell strainer on top. Keep on ice.\nOnce the incubation is finished, immediately place flasks on ice to stop the enzymatic reaction.\nUsing a 10 mL pipette, transfer and pass the suspension through the 100 μm cell strainer tube.\nWash each flask with 10 mL of ice-cold Buffer A to catch any remaining tissue and transfer it over the corresponding cell strainer/tube for each tissue.",
    "Using the plunger from a 1 mL syringe, mash the colon tissue over the 100 μm cell strainer until it is passed through.\nYou may still see some white membranous tissue left on the cell strainer, but this can be discarded.\nAdd 10 mL of ice-cold Buffer A to wash each cell strainer/tube. Discard the cell strainer after use.\nReturn the top to the 50 mL tube to seal and spin down the samples for 5 min at 500 × g at 4°C in a table-top centrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatant in one quick motion, and resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of ice-cold Buffer A.\nPipet up and down using a 10 mL pipette and transfer the suspension over a 50 mL conical tube with a 40 μm cell strainer.\nWash each cell strainer with 10 mL of ice-cold Buffer A. Bring the final volume up to 30 mL with ice-cold Buffer A.\nSpin down the samples for 5 min at 500 × g at 4°C in a table-top centrifuge.\nAspirate the supernatant and proceed with the pellet to the next steps for staining with antibodies and sorting for DCs and CD4+ T cells by FACS. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nFlow cytometric cell sorting for colonic lamina propria DCs and CD4+ T cells\nTiming: 1 h for staining, 1–2 h for sorting (dependent on the number of samples)\nIn this step, isolated mononuclear cells from the colonic lamina propria are stained with appropriate antibodies to identify DCs and CD4+ T cells and then sorted via flow cytometry. For more information regarding the theory behind flow cytometry, please refer to Adan et al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nResuspend the above-mentioned pellet in a 50 mL conical tube with 250 μL FACS buffer.\nCritical: Keep samples on ice to maximize the viability of the cells.",
    "Add 10 μL of FcR Block Reagent (TruStain FcX) to each sample. Incubate at 4°C for 10 min.\nAdd 2.5 μL of each antibody (CD4 – FITC, CD45 – BV421, I-Ab – PE, CD11c – APC) to the cells in the 50 mL conical tube to equal a dilution of 1:100 along with 12.5 μL of 7-AAD for a 1:20 dilution. Pipet up and down to mix. Incubate at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\nThe staining can also be done at RT for 5 min for FcR block and 15 min for antibodies.\nBe sure to also prepare fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls for each fluorochrome/antibody to ensure proper gating during the sorting.\nTo wash the samples, add 1 mL of FACS buffer to each sample in 50 mL conical tube, pipet up and down to mix.\nSpin down 5 min at 500 × g at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of the FACS buffer.\nPass the suspension through a Corning cell strainer snap cap on 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube and place them on ice.\nSort for CD11c+ DCs (CD45+I-Ab+CD11c+) and CD4+ T cells (CD45+CD4+) from each sample using a FACSAria IIu flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for gating strategy).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2642-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Numbers listed are frequencies of parent populations.\nNote: Sort using a 100 μm nozzle, if possible, to avoid sample clogging during the sort.",
    "Once the cells are sorted, spin down at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant. Resuspend cells in FACS buffer and/or Radioimmuno precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and proceed with intracellular staining and western blotting for phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad7.\nNote: Smad proteins can also be detected in DCs and CD4+ T cells isolated from other organs such as the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and the spleen from colitic and non-colitic naive mice. If using bone marrow-derived DCs or ex vivo-isolated DCs from spleen or LN and CD4+ T cells from naïve mice, stimulate these cells with TGF-β for at least 30 min to 1 h. CD4+ T cells should be cultured with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for at least 12 h before adding TGF-β. Please note that as of this writing, no commercially available flow antibody is available for Smad7. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nIntracellular staining for phosphorylated Smad2/3\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes the intracellular staining protocol for Smad2/3 via flow cytometry.\nTransfer cells to a 96-well round bottom plate to allow for effective pelleting. Centrifuge for 5 min at 420 × g. Discard supernatant.\nPerform live/dead staining by resuspending the cells in 100 μL of 1× fixable LIVE/DEAD stain (Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Dye) prepared by diluting 1 μL dye in 1000 μL 1× PBS. Incubate for 10 min at 37°C.\nWash cells by adding 100 μL of PBS. Centrifuge for 5 min at 420 × g. Discard supernatant.\nFix cells by resuspending in 100 μL 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Incubate at 37°C for 10 min. Centrifuge for 5 min at 420 × g. Discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of ice-cold methanol. Incubate at 4°C for 60 min in the dark.",
