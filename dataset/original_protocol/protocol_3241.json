    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThis protocol is organized into four main sections (see below). Sections 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] are performed on day 0, whereas sections 3 and 4 are performed on a subsequent day (e.g., day 3, day 5). The buffers listed above may be prepared prior to the first day of experimentation.\nSection 1: Isolation of monocytes from mouse bone marrow (BM) section 2: Transfer of monocytes into mouse tumors\nSection 3: Generation of single-cell suspensions from mouse tumors section 4: Antibody staining of single-cell suspensions for flow cytometry\nSection 1: Isolation of Monocytes from Mouse BM\nTiming: 3+ h, depending on number of monocytes required\nMonocytes were isolated from BM of mice using the Mouse BM Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications as described below.\nNote: Perform all steps on ice and under sterile conditions\nSpray hindlimbs of euthanized mouse with 70% ethanol (EtOH).\nRemove overlying skin and muscle from the femur and tibia.\nUsing sterile surgical tools, amputate femur from the ileum, separate femur from tibia, separate tibia from hind foot. To ensure that the maximum amount of bone marrow is extracted, carefully preserve epiphyses of femur and tibia.\nCut proximal epiphyses of bones and flush the bone shafts with 5 mL MACS buffer into sterile petri dishes using a 27G needle.\nUsing an 18G needle, disaggregate and transfer flushed bone marrow in MACS buffer into 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Bone marrow cells will form red pellet; aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 2 mL of 1× RBC Lysis Buffer and incubate for 5 min on ice to lyse red blood cells.",
    "Critical: Although RBC lysis is not a necessary part of the protocol, we have found it to be useful in preventing clogging of the magnetic columns used in subsequent steps (see below). Nonetheless, it is important to keep this incubation period ≤ 5 min as extended exposure to this lysis buffer negatively affects cell viability.\nQuench by adding 10 mL MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Cell pellet should now be white in color.\nResuspend cell pellet in MACS buffer and take an aliquot for cell counting.\nFollow the Miltenyi Mouse BM Monocyte Isolation Kit protocol exactly as described in the manufacturers protocol (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/monocyte-isolation-kit-bm-mouse.html[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/monocyte-isolation-kit-bm-mouse.html]; click “Data sheet”) to magnetically label bone marrow cells and perform column-based enrichment of monocytes.\nNote: We have closely adhered to the above protocol to isolate bone marrow monocytes and have consistently achieved ≥ 75% purity of enriched monocytes. We have shown a representative flow cytometry plot comparing Ly6C+ monocytes in total BM cells and after enrichment in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A. The fraction of this monocyte population in the BM that expresses tdTomato is also shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/301-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Purity of Monocytes Enriched with Negative Selection Magnetic Beads\n(A) Flow cytometry plots showing frequency of Ly6C+ monocytes in pre- and post-enriched bone marrow (BM) cell suspensions obtained using the MACS Miltenyi Monocyte Isolation Kit.\n(B) Flow cytometry plots and histograms showing the expression of tdTomato within CD115+ Ly6C+ monocytes from BM of LysMCre:Rosa26tdT mice. Arrows: plots before each arrow show the gating for cells shown on plots after the arrow.\nNote: The estimated purity of enriched monocyte is a conservative one based on positive staining with markers such as Ly6C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Cells negative/low for these markers may include subsets of monocytes.",
    "Note: Anticipate isolation of ~2 × 106 monocytes for every mouse (4–16 weeks female or male) used in the experiment. However, this number may vary based on the bone marrow isolation technique as well the age, weight, sex, and genotype of the donor mouse. In general, monocytes make up ~10% of the cellular composition of mouse bone marrow.\nIf desired, expose the isolated monocytes to drugs or other external factors (and the appropriate controls). For example, in Devalaraja et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], we incubated isolated monocytes with an irreversible retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist or DMSO for 1 h to examine the impact of RAR signaling on monocyte differentiation in tumors.\nThoroughly wash monocytes twice with 1× PBS and resuspend 5 × 105 monocytes in 50 μL of 1× PBS. Monocytes are now ready to be transferred into tumors.\nSection 2: Transfer of Monocytes into Mouse Tumors\nTiming: ~1 h, depending on the number of tumors\nNote: Flank tumors must be generated prior to transfer of monocytes (please refer to the “Before You Begin” section for additional details on establishing flank tumors).\nDraw monocytes up into a 27G needle (with 0.5 inch length) and remove any air bubbles that may be present in the syringe. This needle will be used to directly inject the flank tumor.\nInduce general anesthesia using isoflurane gas for the recipient mouse and ensure that mouse remains under anesthesia for the duration of the procedure.\nTo prevent monocytes from “clumping” within the syringe, place the syringe on a slow-moving shaker at 15°C–25°C while the mouse is being prepared for injection.\nInject 50 μL of monocytes/PBS into flank tumor.",
    "Note: We have found that performing the injection at a 45° angle with the bevel up minimizes both the physical disruption to the tumor architecture (FS tumors) and the number of monocytes lost during the injection procedure. As mentioned before, flank tumors would ideally be approximately 1–1.5 cm in diameter at the time of monocyte transfer; larger tumors generally have increased intratumoral hemorrhage, fluid extravasation, and pressure, making injection of additional volume more difficult. We scruff the mouse to ensure the skin is held taut, and the needle traverses the skin covering the top of the tumor to reach the center of the tumor for intratumoral injection. To minimize the amount of post injection tumor fluid loss, swiftly withdraw the needle and replace needles between mouse injections.\nCritical: We have attempted iterations of this procedure using varying numbers of monocytes and have found that transfer of 5 × 105 per mouse tumor is sufficient to track in situ monocyte differentiation at various timepoints post injection. However, pre-treatment of monocytes with drugs etc. (see above in section 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]) may affect viability. Therefore, for protocols incorporating such treatments, the optimal number of monocytes needed for subsequent analyses will have to be determined empirically.\nSection 3: Generation of Single-Cell Suspensions from Mouse Tumors\nTiming: 2+ h, depending on the number of tumors\nNote: Time between monocyte transplant and tumor harvest depends on the intended purpose of the analyses. We were able to detect the monocytes and their progenies up to 10 days after transfer.\nSpray euthanized mouse with 70% EtOH and remove layer of skin overlying the flank tumor.\nExcise entire flank tumor from underlying muscle and adipose tissue.\nPlace tumor into petri dish, mince tumor into small pieces (1–3 mm) and transfer tissue to container containing a magnetic stir bar.",
    "Add 5 mL of tumor dissociation buffer containing Collagenase B (2 mg/mL) and DNase I (40 U/mL) in DMEM media.\nCritical: Prepare fresh solution of Collagenase B and DNase I media to maximize enzymatic activity.\nPlace container with tissue, media and stir bar onto stir plate in 37°C incubator and let stir at low to medium speed for 30–45 min.\nNote: Tumors with a dense stromal component such as fibrosarcoma may require 45 min of dissociation, whereas tumors with low fibrotic content such as B16-F10 melanoma may require less dissociation time. The optimal time will depend on the tumor type and will need to be determined empirically.\nPass dissociated suspension through a 70 μm filter (placed on top of a 50 mL conical tube). Wash filter with 10 mL of DMEM media.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 2 mL of 1× RBC Lysis Buffer and incubate for 5 min on ice to lyse red blood cells.\nQuench cells by adding 10 mL of MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant.\nNote: Given that transferred monocytes comprise a rare population in tumors, we recommend enriching for intratumoral leukocytes using a column-based positive selection kit to select for CD45+ cells.\nFollow the Miltenyi Mouse CD45 MicroBeads protocol (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd45-microbeads-mouse.html#130-052-301[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd45-microbeads-mouse.html#130-052-301]; click “Data sheet”) exactly as described in the manufacturers protocol to select for CD45+ cells in mouse tumors.\nCentrifuge the CD45 enriched fraction at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL MACS buffer and take an aliquot for cell counting.\nResuspend 1–2 × 106 cells in 100 μL of MACS buffer and add anti-mouse CD16/32 Fc Block (1:200 final dilution).",
    "Critical: Cells should be kept on ice and are now ready to be stained with fluorescently tagged antibodies for flow cytometry.\nSection 4: Antibody Staining of Single-Cell Suspensions for Flow Cytometry\nTiming: 1+ h, depending on the number of samples\nThis portion outlines the use of primary-fluorophore conjugated antibodies to examine the differentiation of transferred monocytes.\nPrepare cocktail of antibodies (see table below). The volume of mix for one sample is 3.75 μL.\nNote: This cocktail includes markers to gate on monocytes and their progeny macrophages and dendritic cells. The user can include additional markers of monocyte, macrophage, or dendritic cell subsets depending on experimental goals. This cocktail also included markers to gate out unwanted cell populations in our analyses (e.g., neutrophils, NK cells, T cells). It is also important to avoid antibodies conjugated to either FITC or PE to avoid spectral overlap with endogenous GFP or tdTomato (monocytes were transferred from LysMCre:Rosa26tdT:Zbtb46GFP hosts).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_301_3.csv\nAdd the indicated volume of antibody cocktail to cells (prepared in step 31), vortex briefly, and incubate in the dark at 4°C for 30 min.\nWash with 1 mL of MACS buffer (add directly to the 100 μL mix) and centrifuge at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 200 μL of MACS buffer.\nAdd 5 μL of 7AAD (cell viability dye, compatible with detection in the PercpCy5.5 channel) to each sample and keep samples in the dark. Samples are now ready to be analyzed via flow cytometry.\nRun samples and collect data on a flow cytometer.\nNote: Fluorescently labeled cells can be fixed in formaldehyde to perform flow cytometry at a later time. However, 7AAD cannot be used in this case. The use of alternative cell viability markers that are compatible with fixation is recommended.",
    "Critical: To set up appropriate voltages on the cytometer, it is critical to use compensation controls (commercial compensation beads or cells stained with individual antibodies), unstained samples, single stained samples and fluorescence minus one (FMO) samples. Please refer to Cossarizza et al. for thorough explanation of compensation setup and the use of rigorous controls in flow cytometry (Cossarizza et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). In our analyses, we use the BDTM CompBeads, which are polystyrene microparticles that bind any immunoglobulin containing rat or hamster κ light chain. The beads are incubated with individual fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies following manufacturer’s recommendations. FITC and PE conjugated antibodies were used to compensate for GFP and tdTomato in our experiments. Nonetheless, cells expressing these fluorescent proteins or other compatible fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies can be used to compensate for GFP and tdTomato depending on the configuration or the cytometer and availability of reagents."
