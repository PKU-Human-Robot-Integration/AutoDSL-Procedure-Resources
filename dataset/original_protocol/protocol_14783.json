    "All enucleated eyes were obtained from an abattoir and all experiments were performed in accordance with institutional biosafety laws.\nSecure enucleated eye down on a surface. Do this by placing tissue pins through the excess tissue around the eye and securing it down into a Styrofoam board.\nDissect and detach perilimbal conjunctiva from eye.\n\t\nUse fine forceps (0.3 forceps) and microscissors (Westcott scissors) to incise the conjunctiva at the limbus and bluntly dissect it off the sclera. Cut the conjunctiva along the limbus as the blunt dissection proceeds to allow further dissection.\nRemove conjunctiva all the way around the eye (360 degrees) to expose as much sclera as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: It is helpful to leave a small amount of conjunctiva to facilitate fixating the eye with the surgical pins or a forceps during the rest of the procedure.\nCreate a full thickness scleral flap along one side of the eye (scalpel blade 69).\n\t\nMake a ~5 mm scleral incision parallel to the limbus and 3 mm posterior to the limbus by gently cutting into the sclera with a scalpel (scalpel blade 11) until darkly pigmented choroid is visible. Be careful not to incise the choroid itself.\nCarefully dissect along the plane between the sclera and choroid, either with scissors (using blunt dissection) or with the scalpel, until it is possible to enlarge the potential space between these tissues by pushing the choroid gently inward.\nMake another scleral incision perpendicular to the first scleral incision with sharp microscissors, creating a T-shaped incision.\nThen continue to bluntly dissect in a circumferential fashion to remove the scleral tissue from the underlying choroid and gently push the choroid away from the sclera as mentioned above.\nEnlarge the scleral flap as needed.\n\t\t\nGently blunt dissect the choroid away from the sclera throughout the process.",
    "Enlarge the flap until the incision made perpendicular to the limbus reaches the optic nerve and the incision made parallel to the limbus is at least one-third of the eye circumference (45°).\nUse the scleral flap as a source of leverage for manipulating the eye during blunt dissection. The counter-traction on the flap makes it easier for blunt dissection.\nRepeat the previous step on the other scleral flap.\nCut away the scleral flaps to expose a large area of choroid.\nContinue the incision made in step 3 around the eye’s circumference (360 degrees).\nRemove the remaining choroid-retina tissue.\n\t\nWithin the exposed region, use a cotton-tip to gently brush off the choroid-retina tissue remaining. Alternatively, gently grab the tissue with forceps and peel it off the underlying vitreous body.\nIf necessary make an incision into the choroid starting from the optic nerve. Then peel away the choroid gently to expose the retina and vitreous cortex.\nContinue blunt dissecting the choroid away from the sclera and then peel away the choroid to obtain the whole, intact vitreous.\nUse the scleral rim attached to the cornea to position the whole vitreous in desired location. At this point, the vitreous is attached to the anterior sclera and lens.\nBlunt dissect the vitreous from the inside of the sclera, around the lens, removing all sclera.\nUse a blunt tool to scoop the lens away from the vitreous if need be. Use the sample for various vitreodynamic experiments.\n\t\nPlace sample in a glass beaker with known surface area exposed to air. Place oxygen sensitive probe at the edge of the sample. Use a micro-manipulator to move the probe to a known distance (r) into the sample.",
