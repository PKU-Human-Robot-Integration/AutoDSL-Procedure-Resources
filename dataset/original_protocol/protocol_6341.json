    "Subculturing Jurkat cell LineTransfer growing cells from T-75 flask to a 50 ml centrifuge tube followed by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Remove and discard the supernatant (old growth medium from above the cell pellet) and resuspend the cell pellet with fresh complete growth medium.Add a proper volume of Jurkat cell suspension to a new T-75 flask containing 15 ml of complete growth medium with approximately 105 viable cells/flask and subculture every 3-4 days.Place the culture flask in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Inducing apoptosis of Jurkat cellsHarvest exponentially growing Jurkat cells (initial concentration of 2 x 105 cells/ml, and final concentration of 6-8 x 105 cells /ml, usually two days after seeding) by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min (same procedure for Jurkat cells subculturing/harvesting/washing).Resuspend cells in fresh medium to a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml and seed into a new T-75 flask. Another flask will be used as the negative control for non-induced cells (note that there would be two groups, one for apoptosis, and the other for non-apoptosis control group).Add staurosporine into Jurkat cell culture with a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, and incubate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 6-8 h. Add the same volume of DMSO into control Jurkat T cell culture.Harvest cells for staining at different times (i.e., 3, 6, 12 h) after the addition of staurosporin/DMSO by transferring 2 ml of cell culture medium into a fresh Falcon tube and centrifugation. Keep culturing the rest of cells in T-75 flask in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Detection apoptosis of Jurkat cells with FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit Wash harvested staurosporine-treated Jurkat cells twice with cold DPBS to stop the reaction.",
    "Resuspend cells in 1x Binding buffer at a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/ml.Transfer 100 μl of the solution (~5 x 105 cells) to a new 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube.Add 2 μl of FITC Annexin V and 2 μl of PI, gently vortex the cells and incubate for 15 min at room temperature or 30 min on ice, protecting from light under either condition.Add 400 μl of 1x Binding buffer to each tube, wash twice (centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min) and analyze by flow cytometer within 1 h (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191216/20191216000418_8018.jpgFigure 1. Apoptosis of Jurkat cells induced by staurosporine. After 6 h-induction, the percentage of early- and late-apoptotic cells was quantified by flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. The numbers indicate the percentage of subpopulations.Intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollateFill a 10-ml syringe with 3% Brewer thioglycollate medium with a 25 G needle.Inject 2 ml of solution per mouse into the peritoneal cavity, allowing inflammatory response to proceed for 4 days.Harvest and culture thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophagesEuthanize mouse with CO2 and clean abdomen with 70% ethanol.Make a small incision along the midline with sterile scissors and retract the abdominal skin manually to expose the transparent peritoneal wall.Fill a 10-ml syringe with 9 ml of DPBS or RPMI-1640-10 (Recipe 4), then inject harvest medium with a 25-G needle into the peritoneal cavity.Massage abdomen for ~30 s and recover peritoneal fluid without puncturing any abdominal organs using a 10 ml syringe with 18 G needle (~8 ml fluid could be recovered from per mouse) (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Harvest peritoneal macrophages (Steps E2-E4)Remove the needle from the syringe and dispense peritoneal fluid into a 15 ml Centrifuge tube on ice (Cells should be kept cool throughout the procedure).",
    "Centrifuge the peritoneal cells in a refrigerated centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g. Discard supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml of RPMI-1640-10 medium by gently pipetting up and down.Count cells using hemacytometer (with 1:10 dilution by mixing 100 μl of cell suspension with 900 μl of trypan blue).Adjust cell concentration with RPMI-1640-10 and seed into 24-well plate at 5 x 105 cells/well (500 μl of medium per well).Cells are allowed to adhere to the plate by culturing for 2-3 h in 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Non-adherent cells are removed by gently washing three times with 1 ml of warmed PBS (Remaining cells should be greater than 90% macrophages).Stimulate peritoneal macrophages with apoptotic Jurkat cellsAfter overnight culture, media for peritoneal macrophages are changed with 500 μl of RPMI-1640 without FBS.Add 100 μl of induced and evaluated apoptotic Jurkat cells (suspended in RPMI-6140 without FBS, with a concentration of 25 x 106 cells/ml) into macrophage cultures at a 5:1 ratio.Harvest cell culture supernatants at 8 h, 16 h after apoptotic cell challenge.Centrifuge harvested samples in a refrigerated centrifuge for 10 min at 500 x g, and then carefully transfer cleared supernatant (~600 μl) to a new tube without disturbing cell pellet.Detection of IL-10 production by ELISA (Figure 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191216/20191216000452_7265.jpgFigure 2. Macrophages produce IL-10 in response to apoptotic cells. 5 x 105 thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with apoptotic Jurkat cells (AC) (5:1 ratio of AC to macrophages) for indicated times and analyzed for IL-10 production."
