    "Preparation of cells for transformationCulture vegetative cells in 150 ml C medium (http://www.nies.go.jp/biology/mcc/home.htm[href=http://www.nies.go.jp/biology/mcc/home.htm]) at 23 °C under a 16 h light (28 µmol/m2/s) and 8 h dark cycle in 300 ml Erlenmeyer flasks.Collect the C. psl. complex cells from the mid-logarithmic to early stationary phase (9-11 days of culture) in a 50 ml culture tube and concentrate by centrifugation (1,100 x g for 2 min at 23 °C) using a swing-type rotor (T5SS31). For the slowdown, deceleration should be set to the slowest speed. Re-suspend the cells in a small aliquot of fresh C medium and count the cells under a light microscope (CK40) using a handmade hemocytometer. Adjust to a density of 5 x 106 cells ml-1 by adding fresh C medium.Spread the cell suspension (1 x 106 cells) using a glass bacterial spreader onto a 90-mm plate containing C medium with 1.5% agar (w/v), prepared one day previously and stored at room temperature.Culture the cells at 23 °C for 2 days under continuous light at 10 µmol m-2 s-1 (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160518/20160518000352_4854.jpgFigure 1. Photograph of gold particles sedimented by centrifugation Preparation of constructs for transformation of the C. psl. complex (approximately 4-5 days)To avoid off-target silencing, the DNA region used for the antisense expression should be carefully checked, using the BLASTN program, against unpublished RNAseq and a genome database of the C. psl. complex.Amplify the required region of target DNA by PCR with KOD-plus-NEO DNA polymerase from plasmid clones (2 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 10 sec at 98 °C and 1 min/kbp at 68 °C). In the case of CpRLK1 gene, 2,180 bp fragment, encoding the extracellular domain of CpRLK1 protein, was amplified. The primer DNAs should include extra sequences corresponding to the vector sequences (ex.",
    "5'-ccagcatgactagtctcgagTTCGGGCTGTTGCTTCGGCGTCA-3' and 5'-gcttcatcaaattactcgagTGGGTGCCGCCGTAGGTTAATAT-3'), which are required for cloning into the pSA0104 vector (Figure 2, Hirano et al., 2015) using the GENEART kit. The enzyme mix provided with the kit recognizes and assembles the vector and PCR fragments sharing terminal end-homology. The pSA0104 vector contains a promoter region of CpHSP70 (5’CpHSP70) for expression of the target gene and a hygromycin resistance gene (aph7”, Berthold et al., 2002) for selection (Figure 2).Aimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160518/20160518000947_5888.jpgBimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160518/20160518001246_7864.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160518/20160518001453_3494.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160518/20160518001519_0582.jpgFigure 2.

The promoters and untranslated regions of CpCAB1 and CpHSP70 genes are shown as light gray and white boxes, respectively. The aph7’’ gene (hygromycin resistance gene) is indicated by black box. Forward and reverse primers used for plasmid construction are shown as arrows under the boxes. Initiation codon (ATG) and stop codon (TAA) are indicated in their respective boxes. The plasmid backbone of the construct was pBluescript II SK+. K, KpnI; N, NotI; X, XhoI. B. The sequence of pSA0104. The restriction sites used for cloning and for linearization have been highlighted. Blue character indicates the promoter and untranslated regions of  CpCAB1. Pink character indicates aph7’’ gene. Using the GENEART kit, insert the amplified DNA fragment corresponding to the antisense strand of a target gene into the XhoI site (immediately after pCpHSP70) of the pSA0104 vector.After confirmation of the sequence, prepare a sufficient amount of plasmid DNA from an E. coli  culture using a High Pure Plasmid Isolation kit, or the standard Alkaline SDS method, followed by phenol/chloroform purification (Birnboim and Doly, 1979).Quantify the DNA concentration accurately using a Qubit fluorometer and the Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit.To linearize the constructs, digest the vector arm region using suitable restriction enzymes, according to the manufacturer’s instruction.",
    "In most cases, NotI, KpnI, or ScaI (on pBluescript II SK+) can be used (Figure 2).Microcarrier stock preparationAdd 60 mg of gold particles and 1 ml of 70% (w/v) ethanol solution to a 1.5 ml microtube.Note: 0.25 µm of gold particles would result in a higher transformation efficacy than 0.6 µm (Abe et al., 2008), however, this may be expensive. Normally, 0.6 µm gold particles are used.Vortex at 2,000 rpm using a micromixer for 5 min.Allow to sediment for 15 min at room temperature.Further sediment by centrifugation using a T15AP31 rotor at 18,800 x g for 10 secfI.Carefully remove the solution with a pipette.Add 1 ml of sterile MilliQ water and vortex for 2 min. Sediment by centrifugation as in step B4. Discard the water. Repeat 3 times.Add 1 ml of 50% sterile glycerol solution and vortex for 1 min.Stored at -20 °C until needed.Coating the microcarriers with the plasmid DNAThaw the microcarriers (step C8) and suspend by sonication for 5 min using an ultrasonic cleaner (set the mode “sonics”).Add the following reagents to the 82.5 µl (4.95 mg, for 20 shots) of microcarrier suspension in a 1.5 ml microtube. Mix by vortexing briefly after the addition of each reagent.82.5 µl of linearized construct (for 400 ng/µl of empty pSA0104, which is 6,086 bp in length).

Seal the cap with parafilm to minimize ethanol evaporation until needed.Particle bombardment Note: This protocol is optimized for the IDERA GIE-III gene transfer system (Figure 3). Further optimization may be required if other particle delivery systems are used.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160518/20160518001712_7980.jpgFigure 3.

Photograph of IDERA GIE-III focusing on the parameters Selection of hygromycin resistant cellsImmediately after bombardment, add 5 ml of melted top agar (step E1) and allow to stand for 30 min.Add 4 ml of C medium to the agar plate. Seal the plate using surgical tape and incubate for 2 d at 23 °C under continuous light (10 µmol m-2 s-1) to enable accumulation of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph’’ protein).Carefully discard the C medium on the agar by decantation. Do not disturb the top surface of the agar.Add 5 ml of C medium containing 50-100 µg ml -1 hygromycin B to the plate to select the hygromycin-resistant colonies.Note: The suitable concentration of hygromycin B for screening should be tested before transformation as this depends on the strains used. In our experience, a lower concentration (10 µg ml-1) is suitable to select for certain C. psl. complex strains. Incubate the cells for 3 to 5 weeks, with a weekly replacement of fresh. hygromycin-containing medium, under continuous light at 23 °C.Pick the surviving colonies (Figure 9) and streak onto 0.8% (w/v) agar plates containing conditioned C medium (Abe et al., 2011) and hygromycin. The unknown factor(s) for cell proliferation, which was secreted from growing cells into surrounded environment, would be included in the conditioned medium and would facilitate the cell division.Note: Use a stereomicroscope to check for contamination of the colonies with bacteria and/or fungi (Figure 10). If contamination occurs, wash the colony repeatedly (at least three times) by the capillary washing method (Andersen and Kawachi, 2005) or isolate a single cell using the Micro Pick and Place System.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160518/20160518002026_1760.jpgFigure 9.

Incubate at 23 °C under a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle for 2-3 weeks.Note: If contamination occurs, washing and isolation of a single cell is required as described in Note of step F6.Transfer the proliferated cells from step F7 to fresh C medium and maintain under normal conditions (step A1).Confirmation of successful integration of the constructs into the genomeIsolate crude genomic DNA from cells using QuickExtract Plant Extraction Solution, according to the manufacturer’s instruction.Amplify the integrated DNA from the genomic DNA by PCR with KOD FX DNA polymerase (2 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 98 °C and 1 min/kbp at 68 °C).Evaluation of knockdown effectsIf specific antibody against the target protein is being used, check the protein expression levels by Western blotting. Select those transformants showing a high reduction in protein expression levels for further characterization, because the knockdown effect will vary and some will not show a distinct reduction in protein expression.Evaluate the phenotype of the selected knockdown transformants. In our case, the sexual responses of transformants in MI medium was mostly evaluated."
