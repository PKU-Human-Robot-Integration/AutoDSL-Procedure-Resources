    "The animal treatment and measuring procedures were performed in accordance with the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines (Protocol #0006R). All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used.\n1. Preparations\nNOTE: The protocol typically requires laboratory-bred rats or mouse for EPM testing. However, other animals, such as guinea pigs, have also been tested on EPMs13. It is important to consider the color contrast between the animals in the maze and the maze color when using video tracking. The contrast is less important for researchers watching animals live or via video. The settings of the video tracking software need to be configured to document that the animals are black or white on either a black or white maze. Problems with configuration settings can occur with a clear acrylic maze, but a matte grey maze can be optimal for both rodent colors.\nSelect animals for the experiment, considering the potential influencing factors, such as strain, sex, estrus cycle, and age, as well as body weight2.\nBased on the individual experiment, determine the number of animals per group for the test.\n\tNOTE: The group size will be dependent on the effect size that is expected with the test treatment. Power analyses are generally done before the experiment is initiated to determine the minimum number of subjects to be included given the variability in animal’s responses in any given task, as well as the number of experimental groups/conditions.\nDesign the experiment (in which a battery of different behavioral tests, such as the open-field test, EPM test, hole-board test, and forced-swimming test will be used) carefully.\n\tNOTE: Pre-exposure of the rodents to a novel test environment (such as an open-field test) immediately before the EPM tests may change the behavior of the animals on the EPM1,2.",
    "Handle all animals in a similar way before the EPM test.\n\tNOTE: It has been demonstrated that different stress factors, application of drugs (e.g., injections), shipping stress, and handling can change the behavior and behavioral responses of rodents on the EPM16. Thus, habituation of the animals to an animal house (e.g., after shipment, for 1 - 2 weeks before the EPM test), experimental conditions, and treatment procedures (e.g., gavaging) are necessary. It is also important that the handling of the rodents and any experience with prior stressors, particularly immediately before testing, is consistent across animals and treatment groups.\nConduct the behavioral studies in nocturnal animals, such as rats and mice, using a reverse light cycle, so that the behavioral assessment can be performed when the animals are in their dark, active phase.\n\tNOTE: The effects of different housing conditions and light cycle/circadian rhythms on behavior and their influence on EPM results were demonstrated previously17, since the animals’ hormones are regulated by the light cycle.\nUse the same experimenters during the procedures and ask them to avoid perfume or soaps with a strong odor.\nAsk the experimenters not to talk near the animal during the experiment or move objects near the EPM environment.\n\tNOTE: It is critically important that the observer makes minimal movements and no noise when collecting behavioral data.\nClean the entire EPM after each trial to erase any smells of previous animals which might interfere with the exploration by the test animal.\n(Recommended) Handle the animals for several days before the EPM test (picking it up gently by the torso and holding it for a minute or two) to acclimate them to the experimenter.",
    "When placing the animals on the EPM, make sure to handle all animals in a consistent manner and place each rodent in the EPM in the same position facing the same arm (e.g., in the center facing the open arm away from the experimenter).\n2. Application of Exogenous Ketone Supplements\nMeasure the body weight of the animals before starting any treatments to determine the dosage calculation for the treatment (e.g., intragastric gavage).\nFamiliarize the animals to the intragastric gavage method (adaptation period) using water by gavage for 5 d before ketone supplementation (standard rodent chow/standard diet [SD] + water gavage; e.g., 2.5 g/kg body weight of water/day). Exclude the use of any animal that does not adapt to the intragastric gavage method.\nFollowing the adaptation period, feed the animals chronically for 83 d and subchronically for 7 d with SD and gavage daily with either water (e.g., 5 g/kg body weight/day; control group: n = 8), ketone supplements such as ketone ester (KE; 1,3-butanediol-acetoacetate diester; e.g., 5 g/kg body weight/day; n = 8), ketone salt (KS; Na+/K+‒beta-hydroxybutyrate [βHB] mineral salt; e.g., 5 g/kg body weight/day; n = 8), or KS+ medium chain triglyceride (1:1 ratio, KSMCT; n = 8)18,19,20.\n\tNOTE: The animals that received intragastric gavage were tested on the EPM 1 h after treatment. Rats fed with standard rodent chow and gavaged with water (excluding ketone supplementation) served as control groups.\n3. Anxiety Assay\nEPM apparatus \nUse the same apparatus across a study to standardize results. The EPM is a plus-shaped apparatus, which consists of four arms (e.g., the arms may be 10 cm wide and 50 cm long): two opposite arms are opened, and the two closed opposite arms are equipped with high (e.g., 30 cm) walls. The apparatus is elevated above the floor (e.g., by 55 cm)2.",
    "NOTE: The most commonly used parameters are the accumulated time spent in the open arms and the number of entries into the open arms; however, the time spent in the closed arms and center, and the number of entries into the closed arms and center are measured, as well as the distance traveled in each area.\nLight up the EPM by using indirect lighting (i.e., direct the light source toward the ceiling instead of directly illuminating the EPM apparatus) and ensure all four arms are similarly illuminated (without shadows, see Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: Changes in the level of light alter the behavior of the rodents on the EPM. Therefore, similar illumination is needed in consecutive experimental animals and days (e.g., 2,800 lumens in the room)2.\nVideo tracking system \n\tNOTE: Use a video tracking system with a computer interface and a video camera for the data collection, which will automatically collect behavioral data in rats (Figure 3). For the video tracking system, a wide variety of standard analog cameras or user-defined image sources (infrared cameras, camcorder, WIA-compliant USB camera, webcams, etc.) can be used. When analyzing the recorded video, the movement-tracking software supports all common video formats, such as .avi, .vob, .wmv, .asf, .mov, .qt, .mpg, .mpeg, .mp4, .3gp, and .mkv. If the video does not playback correctly, it might require a specific codec; additional video formats are supported if the corresponding codec is installed in the system. The movement-tracking software can also be used to analyze previously acquired videos and process the images from different sources, such as DVD/HD recorders, digital video files (.avi, .divx, .mpeg, etc.), webcams, DV cameras, and WIA-compatible imaging devices.\n\t\nSystem setup\nPlug the installation key of the movement-tracking software into a USB 2.0 port and launch the installation tool.",
    "Fix the camera above the experimental area and ensure that it will stay immobile for the duration of the experiment.\nSet up a new experiment in the movement-tracking software system by using the instruction manual. Select New Experiment. Double-click on the icon of the protocol that the new experiment should follow (Figure 3, Supplementary File 1).\nEnter details to label/describe the experiment in the Experiment Info dialog.\nSpecify the source of the video sequences to process.\nDefine the transformation rule for a correct distances measurement. The calibration process enables the movement-tracking software to be informed of the actual dimensions of the experimental area in order to obtain reliable values for distances and speeds.\nDetermine the regions of interest (zones) in the working area.\nAdjust the parameters of the detection process.\n\t\t\t\nIn order for the movement-tracking software to precisely detect the position of the animal in the image, some detection adjustments must be set.\nThe tracking process requires a clear and well-contrasted image by using a fine adjustment of the general brightness and contrast parameters in the Brightness & Contrast section of the Detection Settings panel. As needed, adjust these settings for the whole image or for user-defined zones.\nPut a rat into each arena to test the detection process.\nPress the Start Test button to verify if the detection process can identify the subject correctly. Confirm the detection is activated by the appearance of a dot on the screen. The calibration process has to be done before starting the test.",
    "Detection is considered confirmed when the only black dot shown in the player is the animal being tracked. The red tracking line needs to closely follow all the animal’s displacements. Proper tracking is also confirmed with a white label listing the animal number and corresponding coordinates based on displacement. If such a detection is not obtained, adjust the Threshold and Erosions parameters for optimizing the detection and tracking process.\nAdjust the Threshold and Erosion parameters to get a sharper and noise-free test image.\nIf the tracking path is correctly detected, press the Stop Test button (Figure 4). If these adjustments are going to be used for every new experimental file, press the Save as default button. Press the Accept button to save the new detection settings.\nSet the time conditions of the trials.\nIf the experimental protocol requires the track acquisition process to start at the same time the subject is placed into the experimental area, it is possible to set up the remote unit that comes with the software or to use a wireless mouse.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This option provides the possibility of remotely controlling the start and stop.\nSetup of the Subjects in the system\nManage the experimentation subject’s database. To create a database of experimental subjects, enter the Subjects Database manager by pressing the Subjects button in the Experimentation Assistant bar.\nPress the + button to add new subjects to the database.\nWith the one subject option already selected, enter the subject’s code.\nFill the rest of the subject’s information in the Subject Properties section.\nPress the Create button to add the new subject.",
    "Define the experimentation plan. Use the Scheduler to define the different phases, sessions, trials, and subjects planned to be executed within the experimental project. The trial is selected automatically as “the next trial” to be executed. This property is shown as a green tick on the left side of the trial name.\nData acquisition by simultaneous recording and tracking \n\t\tNOTE: When a live image source is selected, the Player panel provides an embedded recording module for easily capturing the video coming from the selected camera.\n\t\t\nPrepare the movement-tracking software for data acquisition (calibration, zone definition, detection settings, time settings, scheduler).\nOpen the Data acquisition panel.\nStart recording the video of the experiment without the animal by pressing the Start recording button available in the software.\nPlace the animal into the experimental area.\nStart the data acquisition process by pressing the Start button on the Time control panel. The tracking process will be carried out simultaneous with the recording process. As needed, ask the experimenter to note down the behavioral variables manually, such as rears, head dips, and falls (Figure 5).\nCollect the EPM data manually as well as by a blinded observer (separate the observer from the EPM by a curtain) in the testing room.\nWait until the end of the tracking-process recording or press the Stop button on the Time control panel.\nRemove the animal from the experimental area. Stop the video-recording process by pressing the stop button available on the movement-tracking software player.\nPrepare the experimental area for the next animal by washing and drying it. Repeat the cycle again.\nData analysis \nTo access the Analysis tool, press the Analysis button in the Experimentation Assistant bar.",
    "To generate analysis reports of the finished trials, select the trials to analyze. Configure and select the analysis report. Set the time intervals to be analyzed. Generate and review the reports. Export the results to a spreadsheet or image formats (Figure 6).\nEPM for the measurement of anxiety levels\nPerform the EPM experiments under nonstress conditions (in a dimly lit and quiet room) after oral gavage.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the experiments are run in a close time interval (e.g., between 1200 and 1400) because the circadian rhythm can influence the rodents’ behavior on the EPM15,17. Avoid unnecessary movements and noise during the experiment.\nBefore the start of the test, make sure that the EPM is cleaned and dried and the video tracking system is ready to use.\nTransfer the rats in their home cage to the experimental room 30 min prior to beginning the experiment.\nPlace a rat at the intersection of the four arms of the EPM, facing the open arm opposite of the experimenter.\nRun the video tracking software, as well as manually record the behavior of the animal, for 5 min.\nIf the animal falls off the EPM, pick it up and place it back on the same point of the EPM where it fell off. Exclude the behavioral data of this animal from the analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: A loud noise or movement may immobilize/freeze animals on open arms. If a loud noise is heard during the experiment, exclude the behavioral data of the animal undergoing the experiment at that moment from the analysis.\nAt the end of the 5 min test, stop the video tracking software and remove the animal from the EPM. Place it back into its home cage.",
    "Before the next experiment/animal, clean the EPM with a disinfecting detergent (e.g., Quatricide) followed by tap water. Dry the apparatus with paper towels.\n4. Analyses of the Data Collected by the Video Tracking System\nBased on the recorded data, analyze the amount of time spent in the open arms and in the closed arms; the number of entries made to the open arms, closed arms, and to the center zone; the latency to entry into the closed arms; the distance traveled in the open arms, closed arms, and in the center zone.\n\tNOTE: The animal is considered to be in an area when the center of the body mass is in that area.\nDetermine the effects of treatments on behavior by using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test/Tukey’s multiple comparisons test."
