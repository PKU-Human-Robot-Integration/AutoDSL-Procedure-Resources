  "procedures": [
    "The Drosophila embryonic wound protocol can be summarized in five steps: (1) Embryo Collection, (2) Embryo Preparation (3) Embryo Wounding, (4) Embryo Microinjection, and (5) Embryo Fixation.\n1. Embryo Collection\nCollect adult flies, 2-3 days after eclosing, add 50 females and 25 males to an embryo collection cage.\nPlace a fresh apple juice agar plus yeast plate each morning for 3 days.\n\tNotes: For optimal embryo collection, cycle the flies on a 12 hr diurnal schedule in a 25 °C incubator (05:00 lights \"ON\" and 17:00 lights \"OFF\"); female flies respond to changes in the light cycle and will deposit larger quantities of eggs during a switch from lights \"ON\" to lights \"OFF\"10,11.\nIn the afternoon of Day-3, place a fresh apple juice plus yeast agar plate on the cage and collect embryos for 2 hr. Place a new yeast plate on the cage and save the 2 hr collection plate.\nStore the collection plate for an additional 14 hr at 25 °C to age the embryos.\n\tNotes: Wound healing can be assayed at any stage during Drosophila development; the wound-induced transcriptional reporters described in this paper have an optimal activity between stages 15-16 12. By late stage 17, the embryo is too old to easily pierce the maturing cuticle and efficiently activate the wound reporters or detect wound-induced transcription. To allow the collection time and the wounding time to occur during peak lab hours, we follow a schedule of embryo collection for 2 hr (16:00-18:00), exchange the collection plate with a new plate at 18:00, age the collection plate at 25 °C for 14 hr (overnight), and wound the embryos at 08:00 (next day).\n2. Embryo Preparation",
    "Notes: This protocol includes the use of many tools and objects that are sharp or made of glass. Handle all sharps and glass objects with care to avoid personal injury.\nGently remove embryos from collection plates with a paintbrush by adding 2-3 ml water to plate and swirling. Transfer water and embryos from plate to nylon mesh and collection tube.\nAdd 4-5 ml of bleach to the cap of a plastic Petri dish plate and soak the mesh covered end of the collection tube containing the embryos in bleach for 2 min; which removes the outer eggshell of the embryo. Manually rotate the collection tube a couple of times to prevent embryos from clumping in the bleach. Rinse embryos with water 10x and dry the mesh covered collection tube containing the dechorionated embryos on a paper towel.\nUse a dissecting needle to transfer ∼50 embryos from nylon mesh to an agar plate. We add green food coloring to the agar plate to add contrast and aid in embryo alignment. Under a dissecting microscope, make two parallel rows of ∼25 embryos, aligning the embryos on the slide so that they will be at right angles to the puncture needle on the microinjection apparatus. Leave a little space (about 1 embryo length) between the embryos for gas exchange purposes. The two parallel rows should be approximately 5 mm apart.\nPlace a slide with double stick tape on top of the aligned embryos and carefully press the slide to transfer embryos from the green plate to the slide. Then air dry the embryos ∼25 min to reduce internal pressure on the embryo and prevent a burst when wounding.\nPlace 2-3 drops of halocarbon oil mix over the embryos to prevent further dehydration.\n3. Embryo Wounding",
    "Place the embryo slide in the injection microscope stage. Find the embryos in the field of view and practice moving the stage of the inverted microscope.\n\tNotes: Before working with the needle, focus on middle plane of embryo along the dorsoventral axis. To allow for efficient wounding of the aligned embryos, begin wounding the row closer to the needle apparatus. Move the stage to bring the top of the row of aligned embryos into the field of view.\nCarefully place and secure a pulled-needle in the needle holder. Use the micromanipulator to move the needle down toward slide. Align the needle with the embryo, in same focal plane. Once the needle is in focus with the embryo, do not move the needle with the micromanipulator.\nMove the stage to puncture the embryo through and through, then move to the next embryo in the row. When done wounding the first row, use the micromanipulator to move the needle completely up and away from the stage before moving the slide; manually rotate the slide 180° and wound the second row.\nStore the embryos under halocarbon oil at room temperature and proceed with embryo fixation if doing in situ hybridization or antibody staining (see Procedure step 5). Alternatively, store the embryos for 4-6 hr under halocarbon oil and proceed with wound transcriptional fluorescent reporter visualization (Representative Results).\n\tNotes: For the visualization of the fluorescent reporter, we anesthetize the embryos using 50% 1-phenoxy-2-propanol13. The embryos are removed from the halocarbon oil and placed on a new slide. We place glass beads around the embryos, add a few drops of the anesthetic, and place a cover slip on the embryos.\n4. Embryo Microinjection",
    "Notes: The microinjection apparatus that we use in the protocol is not automated to deliver specific volume during the assay. We add a dye to the solution to visualize the microinjection and try to normalize the volume delivered. If too much solution is injected into the embryo, the vitelline membrane will burst.\nLoad needle from the rear with 1 µl of chemical solution plus dye (e.g. 0.6 M H2O2). Allow capillary action to draw the chemical solution to the tip of the needle.\nTo break a needle, place a cover slip at an angle on a slide and coat the edge with halocarbon oil mix. Bring the mounted needle into focus with the edge of the angled cover slip and gently move cover slip edge across the tip of the needle until broken. Apply pressure on microinjection apparatus and check that the chemical solution plus dye is flowing out the needle.\nPlace the slide containing aligned embryos on the microscope stage. Proceed to focus the embryo and the needle in the same plane. Simultaneously puncture and microinject chemical solution plus dye into each embryo.\n\tNotes: Clogged needles occur frequently; break a new needle to avoid incomplete microinjection. A blunt needle tip does not wound as cleanly as an angled needle tip. Adjusting the coverslip to a non-90° angle during breakage is optimal to produce an angled needle tip.\n5. Formaldehyde Fixation\nNotes: The chemicals used in this Drosophila fixation are harmful. Use personal protective equipment (e.g. gloves, laboratory coat, and safety goggles) when handling the chemicals. Follow individual institutional guidelines for disposal of regulated chemicals.",
    "After wounding, wait 15, 30, 60, or more minutes for the transcriptional activation of wound-induced genes to occur. To remove embryos from injection slides, carefully drain the halocarbon oil mix from the slides, lean the slide against a rack and blot the end with a Kimwipe.\nUse a glass pipette to rinse heptane over the slide and wash the rinse liquid into a glass Petri dish. Heptane will dissolve the tape and release the embryos. Continue to rinse until all the embryos are removed from the slide. Proceed to the next slide, until all embryos are removed from slides.\nTransfer the heptane plus embryo solution from the glass dish into a 20 ml scintillation vial. Shake the vial for 2-3 min, remove the heptane and add 5 ml of fresh heptane.\nAdd 5 ml of fresh, fixation solution (see reagents list for recipe). Cap the vial and attach to an orbital platform shaker. Shake the vial containing the embryos for 25 min at 220-230 rpm.\nAfter shaking, let the bubbles at the interface pop. Completely remove the bottom, aqueous phase with a pipette, avoiding pulling up the embryos. The bottom layer consists of the fixation solution and should be disposed properly.\nAdd 5 ml of methanol, cap the vial and shake vigorously by hand for 20-30 sec, swirl and place it on the bench. Wounded embryos will stay at the interphase and will not sink to the bottom.\n\tNotes: After fixation the vitelline membrane of an unwounded embryo will normally burst during the dehydration step with methanol. However, the vitelline membrane in a wounded embryo is already broken and the dehydration step will not remove the vitelline membrane. Hand-devitellinzation is required to complete the fixation protocol.",
    "Carefully remove the top heptane layer and then add 5 ml of fresh methanol. Shake the vial and the embryos should sink.\nRemove the methanol plus embryo solution with a glass transfer pipette and collect in a nylon mesh collection tube in a glass dish.\nRemove the methanol and rinse the embryos with 1x PBS solution.\nTransfer the embryos from the nylon mesh to an apple juice plate. Spread the embryos out along the surface of the plate.\nTransfer the embryos to a double stick tape glass slide. Cover the embryos with 1x PBS.\n\tNotes: The embryos tend to clump because of the vitelline membrane. Using an apple juice place allows for quick separation of the clumped embryos. The embryos must be removed from the plate and transferred to a double stick tape glass slide because embryos sink into the agar plate when force is applied to remove the embryo from the vitelline membrane.\nCarefully push the embryos with a dissecting needle to \"pop\" the vitelline membrane. The embryo should sink in the PBS.\nUse a glass pipette to transfer the 1x PBS plus embryos to a 1.5 ml tube. Rinse the embryos with 1x PBS and store at 4 °C. Proceed to dehydrate the embryos using an Ethanol:PBS series and continue with in situ hybridization or immunolocalization protocol14."
