    "All experiments dealing with live animals were conducted in accordance to all relevant animal use and care guidelines and regulations.\n1. Choice of Fluorescent Reporter Mice\nUse 6- to 12-week-old LysM-eGFP11 mice (no preference for either males or females).\n\tNote: The use of various cell-specific fluorescent reporter mice enables the visualization of different immune cells in vivo. In this strain, circulating neutrophils (GFPhi cells), circulating monocytes (GFPlo cells), and dermal macrophages (GFPlo cells) can be visualized. With the imaging parameters used, only the bright signals from GFP-positive neutrophils will be detected.\n\tNote: A list of immune-cell-specific fluorescent reporter mouse strains suitable for this type of skin imaging study can be found in Reference 8.\n\tNote: It is highly recommended that albino mice be used for imaging, as pigmented mice are more prone to photodamage. This is because the pigmented ear skin is much more sensitive to laser-induced speckling (indicative of tissue burning). As a result, neutrophil recruitment and accumulation may be observed even during the steady state8,12.\nKeep the mice in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions with 12-h light-dark cycles.\n2. Mouse Anesthesia\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intra-peritoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine (8 µL g-1 bodyweight), composed of a mixture of 15 mg mL-1 ketamine and 1 mg mL-1 xylazine dissolved in sterile water.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad to maintain its body temperature at 37 °C throughout the preparation procedure. Check for sufficient anesthesia by observing an absence of a toe pinch reflex.\n\tNote: After the first hour, subsequent quarter doses of anesthetic will need to be administered subcutaneously and will last for approximately 0.5 h each. The twitching of whiskers or the tail may also indicate that the anesthesia is wearing off and that a top-up is required.",
    "Use ophthalmic lubricant on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n3. Depilation\nCarefully apply depilatory cream to the upper two-thirds of the dorsal mouse ear using cotton-tip applicators.\nWait for 2 - 3 min before removing the cream using wet cotton-tip applicators in a thorough but gentle manner.\n\tNote: Do not allow hair removal cream to stay on the mouse ear for too long, as it may induce inflammation13,14.\n4. Induction of Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury\nUse gold-plated, N42-grade neodymium magnets, 12 mm diameter x 2 mm thick, and with a Gauss rating of approximately 3,000 to induce ischemia in the mouse ear skin.\n\tNote: In this case, the dimpled face of the magnets denotes its north pole.\nSlot the magnets into their individual plastic guides.\n\tNote: The plastic guide serves to ease the placement and separation of the high-strength magnets. Due to their strong magnetic force yet low resistance to breakage, do not place individual magnets in close proximity to each other or to other metals. Breakage and splintering may occur if they pull towards each other.\nPosition the first (dorsal) magnet such that only the edge is in contact with the second (ventral) magnet (Figure 3a)\n\tNote: This prevents the magnets from snapping together before they have been properly positioned.\nPosition both magnets such that the ventral magnet lies flat on the ear (Figure 3a).\n\tNote: Before ischemia is induced, ensure that the mouse is kept at 37 °C and that sufficient anesthesia is maintained (see step 2.2).\nOnce ready, carefully let the magnets come together (Figure 3a).\n\tNote: For imaging purposes, clamp only half of the ear so that an IR and non-IR region can be observed.",
    "After 1.5 h of ischemia, remove the magnets by twisting the magnets away from each other using the plastic guides, allowing reperfusion to take place.\n\tNote: Care must be taken to prevent the ears from creasing when the magnets are placed. Incomplete ischemia is evident if the macroscopically visible major blood vessels re-perfuse immediately (i.e., blood fills the vessels immediately) after the magnets are removed. Although reperfusion does not occur immediately after the removal of magnets, blood vessel occlusion is only transient. As such, it is imperative to prepare the mouse ear for imaging as swiftly as possible.\n5. Injection of Blood Vessel Labeling Agents\nImmediately after magnet removal, administer intravenously (via retro-orbital or tail vein injection) Evans blue (10 mg mL-1 in PBS or saline; 1 µL g-1 bodyweight) or another blood vessel labeling agent of choice.\n\tNote: Before injection, ensure that sufficient anesthesia is still maintained by performing gentle toe pinching.\n6. Placement of the Ear on the Imaging Platform\nCut 2 pieces of masking tape 1.5 cm in length and 1.8 cm in width.\nAllow the adhesive sides to stick together whilst leaving about 1 mm of adhesive along its width.\nCut the masking tape in two, lengthwise, to accommodate its placement within the slit on the ear platform.\nInsert this masking tape about halfway through the slit, such that the adhesive side faces up.\nPosition the mouse on the heating pad, such that the ear to be imaged is next to the masking tape strip.\nBy using two PBS-moistened cotton-tip applicators, gently press the ear against the adhesive strip.\nUsing the strip as a guide, bring the mouse ear through the slit while simultaneously adjusting the mouse closer towards the stage.",
    "To remove the sticky tape, first add a drop of PBS to reduce the adhesiveness of the tape.\nSeparate the mouse ear from the masking tape as gently as possible using a fine paintbrush.\nFlatten the ear against the ear platform by gently rolling a moist cotton-tip applicator over the ear.\nPut a drop of PBS underneath the coverslip (which is kept in position on the coverslip holder using grease; Figure 2) and gently place it over the ear. Top up with more PBS if necessary.\n\tNote: The coverslip holder increases the stability during imaging.\nInsert the rectal temperature probe and connect the wires to the heating system according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNote: Set the temperature of the body heating pad to 37 °C and the ear stage platform to 35 °C.\n7. Multiphoton Microscope Setup and Imaging Parameters\nNote: This protocol uses a single beam, multiphoton microscope with a tunable (680 - 1,080 nm) Ti:Sa laser (3.3 W at 800 nm; pulse length of 140 fs; 80 MHz repetition rate) with a 20X water objective (NA = 1.0) for intravital imaging studies.\nOpen the imaging software.\nAlign the laser according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAdjust the excitation wavelength to 950 nm.\n\tNote: GFP and Evans blue can be simultaneously excited at 950 nm.\nTo preview, use the following settings: 500 µm2 scanfield, 505 x 505 pixel resolution, and a scan frequency of 800 Hz in a single line scan. Click \"Preview.\"\nToggle the attenuator (laser) power. Ensure that all essential signals are picked up without exposing the imaging field to excessive amounts of laser power, which may induce heat damage.",
    "Note: Start at a low attenuator power and increase if the signal is dim. As neutrophils will be absent from the interstitium at early time points post-reperfusion, macrophages may be used as a gauge to determine the minimal power required, as the former are dimmer than neutrophils.\n\tNote: If this step is to be done for the first time, adjust the settings in the non-ischemic zone, where intact vascular integrity is expected and will facilitate the setting of the attenuator power. In subsequent experiments, these settings do not require much modification unless the laser power is unstable.\nAdjust the PMT settings.\n\tNote: Check with the manufacturer for the maximal optimal gain voltage for the PMT. Setting the PMT voltage beyond the recommended threshold will result in a higher signal-to-noise ratio. The general recommendation is to set the PMT gain voltage to the recommended threshold and to increase the attenuator power as necessary should the signal be too dim.\nSelect an imaging region that is in close proximity to the edge of the ischemia, characterized by massive Evans blue leakage.\nCollect GFP and Evans blue signals using 525/50 bandpass (BP) and 655/40 BP filters, respectively. For second harmonic generation (SHG) signals of collagen fibers within the dermal compartment, use a 475/42 BP filter.\nCreate a folder to save the images in a format that is compatible for the available image analysis software.\nTo acquire, use the following settings: 500 µm2 scanfield, 505 x 505 pixel resolution, and a scan frequency 400 Hz in a single line scan.\nA 100-µm z-stack with a step size of 4 µm can be acquired repeatedly over time, at 1 min intervals, to monitor neutrophil infiltration.",
    "Note: Especially for leukocytes (e.g., neutrophils) with a higher migratory velocity, an interval that is longer than 1 min may result in difficulties during cell tracking analysis. In this case, the user can either reduce the thickness of the acquisition stack or increase the scan frequency.\n\tNote: While the required acquisition stack of the ischemic zone may appear smaller as a result of the compression (alternatively characterized by a higher SHG intensity), subsequent reperfusion will result in massive inflammation that causes the ear to swell. Significant drifts in the Z-direction are expected. As such, the acquisition of a large z-stack is necessary to accommodate the drift.\nThroughout the imaging, top up the PBS and water regularly to keep the ear moist and the objective lens immersed in water.\n\tNote: A typical experiment usually lasts for 2 - 4 h. Depending on the experimental design, and coupled with a well-controlled anesthesia regime, extending the duration of imaging is possible.\n8. Terminating the Experiment\nEuthanize the mouse by carbon dioxide asphyxiation according to the institution's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) procedures.\n\tNote: Always euthanize the mouse by approved methods as determined by the institution's rules, regulations, and guidelines. If repeated imaging is needed, keep the mouse on the heating pad until the anesthesia wears off. Once the mouse has regained sufficient consciousness and is mobile, return the mouse to its cage.\n9. Image Analysis\nNote: Data generated from the imaging experiment can be visualized by different software packages.\nOpen the imaging analysis software.\nUnder Surpass Mode, import the file (Open → select any file in the desired folder → Click \"open\").\nEdit pseudo colors if default colors do not apply (Edit → Display adjustment → Under the channel tab, select the desired color from the color palette).",
    "Adjust the brightness, contrast, and background (Edit → Display Adjustment → Toggle Max and Min values).\nEnsure that the file dimensions are correct (Edit → Image properties → Under the geometry tab, check the voxel size. In this protocol, X = 0.99, Y = 0.99, and Z = 4).\n\tNote: Derive X and Y by dividing the scanfield dimension by the pixel resolution. Z is the thickness between each slice.\n\tNote: The output of these data sets can be presented as maximum projection movies.\n\tNote: Tracking analysis is required to fully characterize the cellular activities and interactions in order to understand their function in vivo. Detailed instructions of cell tracking using the spot function available in the software can be found in the protocol in Reference 15.\n\tNote: There are many ways of quantifying leukocyte migration, details of which can be found in the review article in Reference 16.\nSubscription Required.
