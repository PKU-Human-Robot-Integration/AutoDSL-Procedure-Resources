The methods in Mattis et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] targeted both the entorhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus. However, for illustration, coordinates used in this protocol will only target the entorhinal cortex. Note that this same procedure can be used to introduce virus into any brain region using coordinates identified via a mouse brain atlas.37[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]\nAnesthetize the mouse.\nWeigh the mouse to calculate appropriate dosages for drugs for post-operative pain and infection control. We used the following:\nBuprenorphine (0.5–1.0 mg/kg in sterile saline; sub-cutaneous).\nCefazolin (500 mg/kg in sterile saline; sub-cutaneous).\nMeloxicam (5 mg/kg in sterile saline; sub-cutaneous).\nAlternatives: Check with your institution for up-to-date guidelines and official recommendations.\nAnesthetize with inhaled isoflurane (4%) in 100% oxygen in an induction chamber.\nThis takes approximately 1–3 min depending on the age and size of the mouse.\nMonitor respiratory rate (1/s) and loss of toe/tail-pinch reflex for successful induction. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nReduce anesthesia to 0.5%–2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen and redirect the flow to the stereotax. Isoflurane levels should be continually titrated for the remainder of the surgery to maintain appropriate depth of anesthesia.\nPosition and prepare the mouse in the stereotaxic frame (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2343-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Virus injection\n(A) The mouse is secured in the stereotax via ear bars, with its nose in the nose cone for maintenance of inhaled anesthesia. The fur is removed from the scalp in preparation for an incision.\n(B) The skull is exposed. The drill is posed to bore a hole at the desired coordinates.\n(C) The needle tip is positioned at the desired coordinates to enable viral injection into the mouse brain.",
    "Transfer the mouse from the induction box to the stereotax. Place the nose in the nose cone and secure it in place by hooking the upper incisors over a bar within the nose cone.\nPlace a heating pad underneath the mouse to prevent hypothermia.\nGently insert the ear bars and tighten to secure the mouse.\nCritical: Ensure that when securing the ear bars in the frame, the position markings on the ear bars relative to the stereotax are aligned on both sides – i.e., the skull is centered within the stereotax. This will ensure minimal repositioning during subsequent steps.\nNote: Check positioning by gently attempting to adjust the head side to side as well as up and down. Proper positioning of the ear bars will prevent this movement.\nCover the eyes in ophthalmic eye ointment to prevent drying.\nApply a depilatory agent onto the scalp. Remove it with a sterile cotton tipped applicator after 2–3 min.\nAlternatives: Shaving the surgical area is also acceptable, though it may increase the risk of potential infection if not thoroughly disinfected.\nSterilize the scalp with three rounds of iodine and alcohol wipes.\nMake an incision.\nUse a blade to make a single midline incision.\nUse the same blade to gently scrape away the tissue from the top of the skull.\nUse hemostats secured to the skin to keep the surgical field exposed.\nClear the surgical field with gauze and cotton tipped applicators.\nCenter and level the skull.\nAttach a drill to the stereotaxic arm, navigate to Bregma, and set this location as A/P: 0, M/L: 0, D/V: 0.\nNavigate to Lambda, typically ∼4.5 mm posterior to Bregma in an adult mouse. Ensure that the D/V coordinates are within 0.05 mm relative to Bregma.",
    "If not, change the angle of skull by either raising or lowering the nose cone; repeat steps 4a and 4b.\nDrill (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNavigate to the virus injection coordinate(s) and drill a small hole at each site. For instance, for the (right) entorhinal cortex, the injection coordinate (relative to Bregma in mm) is:\nA/P: -4.5, M/L: 3.0.\nIf completing in vivo optogenetics, drill an additional hole (if needed) for the fiberoptic cannula placement.\nCritical: Drill slowly by applying only gentle pressure to the skull to avoid causing trauma to the brain. The sound of the drill will increase in pitch as the drill advances through the skull. You may also see a small amount of fluid leak. Stop immediately.\nPrepare the injection system.\nAttach a 33 G beveled needle on a 10 μL micro-syringe to the infusion pump secured to the stereotax.\nWithdraw an appropriate volume of your chosen virus. This can be done manually or automatically with the infusion pump.\nEnsure that the pump is set to injection mode.\nNavigate to Bregma, ensuring that the tip of the needle just touches the surface of the skull and set this location as A/P: 0, M/L: 0, D/V: 0.\nNavigate to the injection site: A/P: -4.5, M/L: 3.0, D/V: -4.2.\nMove slowly in the D/V axis to prevent excessive tissue damage.\nInject virus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nSlowly inject the desired volume of virus.\nWe injected 200 nL at 100 nL/min at each site.\nLeave the needle inserted for 5–10 min for proper virus diffusion and to prevent leak of virus from the injection site upon removal of the needle.\nSlowly withdraw the needle.\nIf completing additional injections, repeat steps 6b–7c.\nCritical: If utilizing in vivo chemogenetics, continue with step 8. If using optogenetic virus proceed directly to step 10.",
    "Complete the Surgery.\nRemove the hemostats.\nClose the incision site using sutures.\nAlternatives: Depending on preference and existing institutional guidelines, glue may also be used.\nRemove the mouse from the stereotax.\nPlace the mouse in a recovery chamber with a heating pad.\nMonitor every 15 min until regular mobility and behavior is observed.\nReturn the animal to its home cage.\nProvide post-operative care.\nAdminister a second dose of Meloxicam 24 h post-surgery.\nIf the mouse continues to show signs of pain (i.e., decreased activity, hunched posture, scruffy or greasy coat) after the first day, provide additional injections spaced 24 h apart.\nMonitor pain and activity levels twice a day on the first day of post-op.\nContinue monitoring daily for the duration of the experiment.\nAlternatives: Check with your institution for up-to-date post-operative care guidelines.\nPause point: Wait for optimal viral expression before performing experiments. Typical waiting time is at least 3 weeks, but the precise time must be empirically determined based on the specific experimental parameters, including viral serotype, promoter, titer, and volume.\nFiberoptic cannula implantation\nTiming: ∼30 min/mouse\nFor in vivo optogenetics, fiberoptic cannulas are implanted to allow laser light to target the desired brain structure. The implantation surgery can be completed in the same surgical session as the viral injections.\nImplant the fiberoptic cannula.\nAttach the fiberoptic cannula to the stereotaxic arm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2343-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Fiberoptic cannula implantation\n(A) Mixing of C&B Metabond adhesive cement, which is used to affix the fiberoptic cannula to the skull.\n(B) A fiberoptic cannula is secured to a detachable arm of the stereotax.",
    "(C) The mouse with an implanted fiberoptic cannula secured with C&B Metabond. Note that this image is prior to suturing the skin, in order to visualize that the dental cement is in direct contact with a large surface area of the skull.\nNavigate to Bregma using the cannula and set this location as A/P: 0, M/L: 0, D/V: 0.\nFind the implant coordinates and insert slowly.\nFor the right entorhinal cortex, insert at A/P: -4.5, M/L: 3.0, D/V: -3.9.\nNote: The desired activation volume of the targeted brain region, wavelength, power density, and opsin sensitivity play a role in determining the optimal distance between the virus injection site and fiberoptic cannula.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] In practice, we placed the fiberoptic cannula 0.1–0.4 mm dorsal to the virus injection site.\nCritical: The fiberoptic tip is fragile; perform 10b-c with care.\nCritical: Do not remove the cannula or the arm until the cannula has been cemented.\nMake the dental cement (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nPre-chill the ceramic mixing dish on ice.\nNote: This slows down the reaction allow adequate working time.\nAdd 4 drops of the liquid QuickBase into a well in the dish.\nAdd 1 drop of Universal Catalyst into the same well.\nAdd 1–3 leveled scoops of L-Powder into the same well.\nThe amount can be varied to change the viscosity per user preference.\nRapidly mix.\nNote: The Radiopaque (versus clear) L-powder may be preferable for optogenetic experiments since it results in less visible light around the fiber – thus avoiding an inadvertent visual cue to the animal.\nSecure the cannula to the skull. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nApply the solution to the skull.\nThe solution for the first layer should be thick enough to harden quickly, yet loose enough that it can spread over the skull to maximize adhesion.",
    "Critical: Take care that the cement does not adhere to the skin or eyes.\nThe solution for the second layer should be medium viscosity so it can be built up around the cannula.\nThe solution for the final layer should be thin to smooth any bumps or sharp edges that can harbor bacteria or injure the animal.\nPause point: Wait for 10–20 min for the dental cement to fully dry before removing the holder from the cannula. The solidity of the headcap can be tested with gentle tapping.\nRemove the arm holding the fiberoptic cannula (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Place the cap on top of the cannula to protect it.\nReturn to step 8 to complete the surgery.\nIn vivo optogenetics\nTiming: 10 min\nIn the optogenetic approach, stimulation of neurons is achieved by photoactivation of opsins expressed in the brain (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Here we calibrate the lasers to stimulate the opsins expressed in the entorhinal cortex. Ensure that you are using the correct wavelength to stimulate your chosen virus. In this protocol we utilize a blue light at a wavelength of 473 nm, appropriate for activation of Channelrhodopsin.38[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2343-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Workflow for in vivo optogenetics\n(A) Infusion of an opsin (ChR2)-encoding virus into the brain of a mouse.\n(B) Implanted fiberoptic cannula secured with opaque dental acrylic.\n(C) Opsin activation (via laser stimulation through the fiberoptic cannula) coupled with hyperthermia. These experiments can typically be performed 3+ weeks after surgery.\nCritical: Ensure that you are always wearing the proper eye protection when using the laser. Do not look directly into the laser or the laser scatter as this can cause eye damage.\nTurn the laser on to calibrate the output (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Use a power meter to measure the output at the tip of a fiberoptic cannula connected to the patch cord.\nAdjust the output to the desired power (e.g., 3 mW).\nUsing a pulse generator (e.g., Master-9), set the laser parameters to generate the desired stimulation sequence.\nWe used 5 ms pulse at a rate of 20 Hz, with alternating epochs of 5 s ON / 5 s OFF.39[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39]\nNote: The parameters of laser stimulation (i.e., frequency, pulse width, power, and activation pattern) may differ depending on experimental requirements. It is important to choose a pulse width that is sufficient to activate the opsin (>2 ms), and a frequency that is low enough to allow the desired cell type to fire at physiological rates.\nTurn the laser key to the “OFF” position prior to connecting the animal.\nAttach the mouse via a fiberoptic patch cord with a plastic sleeve.\nTurn the laser key to the “ON” position immediately prior to initiating the hyperthermia experiment.\nNote: To control for the possible heat-inducing effects of light, use a fluorophore-only virus paired with light stimulation. Alternatively, to control for opsin expression, use an opsin-expressing virus without light stimulation.\nIn vivo chemogenetics\nTiming: 15 min\nIn the chemogenetic approach, stimulation of neurons is achieved with an injection of 10 mg/kg CNO 30 min prior to hyperthermia experiments (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2343-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Workflow for in vivo chemogenetics\n(A) Infusion of a DREADD (hM4D(Gi))-encoding virus into the brain of a mouse.\n(B) Intraperitoneal injection of designer drug CNO, to activate the DREADD.\n(C) Hyperthermia experiments performed 30 min after CNO injection.\nMake CNO working solution.\nThaw a 450 μL aliquot of CNO stock solution.\nCritical: Thaw the CNO stock solution aliquot immediately prior to use.",
    "Add 450 μL of sterile saline to dilute the 450 μL CNO stock solution aliquot 1:1.\nPrepare individual doses of CNO in disposable syringes.\nWeigh each mouse.\nCalculate the appropriate dose of CNO working solution using this formula:\n5.8 (μL) ∗X (weight of mouse in grams) = Y (μL of CNO working solution).\nInject the mouse intraperitoneally.\nNote: We suggest using 2% DMSO in saline as a control.\nPause point: To ensure that the CNO has enough time to exert its effect, wait 30 min prior to seizure induction experiments.\nHyperthermia\nTiming: 20–30 min\nTo determine the effect of optogenetic or chemogenetic stimulation on acute seizure temperature threshold, we used a passive heating procedure to induce an acute hyperthermia-induced seizure.\nNote: To account for circadian confounds we triggered any repeated seizures at the same time of day each time – i.e., approximately 24 h apart.\nAssemble Equipment.\nSet up the control chamber, the heating chamber, and the cooling chamber.\nThe control chamber should be completely empty and located in the same room as the heating chamber (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2343-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Experimental set up for hyperthermia testing\n(A) The mouse is connected to a temperature probe and placed in an ambient temperature control chamber.\n(B) The mouse is moved to the heating chamber and exposed to a heating lamp, with continuous monitoring of internal body temperature.\n(C) The mouse is moved to the cooling chamber at the conclusion of the experiment.\nNote: The chamber should remain at room temperature (20°C–22°C). To avoid any passive heat transfers, keep the chamber at least 2 feet away from the heating and cooling chambers. We used an empty cage.\nThe heating chamber should contain a lid and heating lamp (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).",
    "Note: Mice with generalized tonic-clonic seizures can easily jump out of the box. A lid is strongly recommended.\nThe cooling chamber should contain a thick layer of crushed ice covered by a damp paper towel (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nNote: A lid here is similarly suggested to encourage contact between the ice and the mouse and to prevent escape.\nSet up a camera to record the procedure to score seizures off-line.\nIf using the optogenetic approach, ensure that the lasers have been set to the appropriate settings and calibrated.\nUsing an alcohol swab, disinfect the rectal probe and let it air dry.\nPrepare the mouse.\nIf using the chemogenetic approach, ensure that at least 30 min have elapsed since the CNO injection.\nIf using the optogenetic approach, connect the cable to the implanted cannula(s).\nNote: While we did not include EEG recordings in this study, they are easily compatible with hyperthermia experiments. EEG cables can be connected at this time.\nLubricate the now disinfected and dry rectal probe and insert into the rectum of the mouse. Secure the probe with tape around the tail.\nOptional: Tape can be labeled with an animal number for easier off-line ID.\nPlace the mouse into the control chamber for ∼5 min, or at least until the recorded body temperature is stable.\nIf using the optogenetic approach, laser stimulation can be initiated while the mouse is in the control chamber, or upon transfer to the heating chamber, as desired.\nTransfer the mouse into the heating chamber and turn on the heating lamp. troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nRecord the temperature of the mouse at least every minute to ensure heating is occurring.\nIf/when a seizure occurs, record the body temperature, and immediately remove the animal from the heating chamber.",
    "Note: Animals were removed upon observation of a Stage 4–5 behavioral seizure on the Modified Racine Scale. Seizures usually began with a vocalization that was quickly followed by jumping, falling over, and generalized tonic-clonic activity.\nIf the animal reaches 42.5°C without having a seizure, stop the experiment.\nTransfer the mouse to the cooling chamber.\nOnce the body temperature is below 40°C, remove the rectal probe and continue to monitor for any adverse effects.\nOnce the mouse has regained regular mobility and is exhibiting normal behavior, return it to its home cage.
