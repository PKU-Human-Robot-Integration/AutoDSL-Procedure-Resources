    "NPCs have the ability to differentiate into neural cell types including neurons and astrocytes (Tcw et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0018]). When these NPCs are patterned toward a specific regional identity, they can produce neurons specific to that brain region (Kirkeby et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0010]; Kriks et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0012]). The production of iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons described by Kriks et al. (2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0012]) is a two-phase protocol, with initial midbrain floor-plate patterning of neural progenitors, followed by differentiation of these progenitors into neurons (Kriks et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0012]). The protocol described here is an adaptation of that original protocol: it adheres to Kriks’ initial 11 days of differentiation and then differs by establishing a population of self-renewing midbrain-patterned NPCs. The advantage of this method is the possibility to produce large numbers of NPCs that can be frozen and stored. These NPCs can be returned to culture and readily used to produce astrocytes (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0003]) and neurons (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0004]), alleviating the need for maintaining iPSCs and reducing the risk of variability between downstream differentiations.\nTo initiate differentiation, iPSCs are plated as a monolayer and subsequently neuralized via dual SMAD inhibition (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0002]A). After 11 days in culture, the cells are passaged; cultured for an additional 7 days; and subsequently frozen, sub-cultured, or differentiated into regionalized astrocytes (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0003]) and neurons (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0004]). Newly produced NPCs need to undergo quality control (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0002]) to ensure expression of region-specific marker genes.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d020af13-a610-458f-9e98-74f1a3e2d311/cpcb98-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

Observe confluent iPSCs in growth medium in a 10-cm dish under a light microscope to monitor cell health, ensuring that colonies with tight edges and a dense center are present (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0002]B). Under sterile conditions, manually remove areas of spontaneous differentiation using tip of a pipet tip (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0002]C).\nWe suggest growing at least one 10-cm dish of iPSCs. The iPSC culture is ready for plating when it is confluent and consists of large colonies without spontaneous differentiation.",
    "2. Pre-warm aliquots of mTeSR1 or mTeSR Plus medium and Accumax to 37°C. Equilibrate DPBS at room temperature.\nmTeSR1 and mTeSR1 Plus media are both excellent choices for growing iPSCs. However, mTeSR1 Plus medium allows feeding of iPSCs every other day instead of daily, and doubling the volume of medium allows one to skip feeding on the weekend.\n3. Prepare 10 ml pre-warmed mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\nROCK inhibitor promotes iPSC survival when iPSCs are plated as single cells.\nThe volume of mTeSR1 medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor may need to be adjusted depending on the number of cells harvested and the number of wells for cell plating.\n4. Remove growth medium from the iPSCs from step 1 and wash cells once with 5 ml DPBS. Add 3 ml pre-warmed Accumax.\n5. Incubate cells at 37°C until they become rounded and detach from the dish.\nMonitor cells after a 3-min incubation. A longer incubation time may be necessary, but no longer than 10 min. A longer incubation time may reduce the viability of the cells.\n6. Gently triturate cells to prepare a single-cell suspension. Transfer cell suspension to a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube.\nTo prevent a reduction in cell viability, do not over-triturate.\n7. Wash the 10-cm dish with 8 ml mTeSR1 medium to collect as many cells as possible and transfer to 15-ml tube containing the cell suspension.\n8. Centrifuge 3 min at 300 × g. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 3 ml mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (see step 3).\n9. Count cells with a hemocytometer and plate at a density of 1.9 × 106 cells/2 ml/well in a Geltrex-coated 6-well plate.",
    "The optimum cell density needs to be empirically determined for each iPSC line. The optimum cell density is defined as the density that will result in a confluent monolayer of iPSCs the next day, a healthy culture until Day 11 of the protocol, and ultimately successful generation of midbrain-patterned NPCs. This may require more than one 10-cm dish, in which case the volumes detailed above would need to be adjusted.\nDay 0\n10. The next day, wash cells with 2 ml DPBS per well to remove dead cells and debris.\nA substantial proportion of cells do not survive after plating. This is normal, but it is critical to ensure that the culture consists of a monolayer of healthy cells after plating. If the cells do not survive, prepare fresh stocks of ROCK inhibitor. Alternatively, replace the ROCK inhibitor with RevitaCell Supplement (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. A2644501).\n11. Monitor cell viability under a light microscope, ensuring a confluent monolayer of iPSCs. If there are areas of the plate without cells, let culture grow for one more day in fresh mTeSR1 medium without ROCK inhibitor. If the monolayer is ready for differentiation, add 2 ml SRM freshly supplemented with 100 nM LDN193189 hydrochloride and 10 µM SB431542.\nDay 1\n12. Aspirate Day 0 medium and add SRM freshly supplemented with 100 nM LDN193189, 10 µM SB431542, 100 ng/ml SHH, and 2 µM purmorphamine.\nDay 2\n13. Aspirate Day 1 medium and add SRM freshly supplemented with 100 nM LDN193189, 10 µM SB431542, 100 ng/ml SHH, and 2 µM purmorphamine.\nDay 3\n14. Aspirate Day 2 medium and add SRM medium freshly supplemented with 100 nM LDN193189, 10 µM SB431542, 100 ng/ml SHH, 2 µM purmorphamine, and 3 µM CHIR99021.\nDay 5",
    "15. Combine SRM and N2 medium at a 3:1 ratio. Supplement with 100 nM LDN193189, 100 ng/ml SHH, 2 µM purmorphamine, and 3 µM CHIR99021.\nFor example, to make 10 ml Day 5 medium, combine 7.5 ml SRM and 2.5 ml N2 medium. Add the supplements, and the complete medium is ready.\n16. Aspirate medium from the cells and feed cells with the medium prepared above.\nDay 7\n17. Combine SRM and N2 medium at a 1:1 ratio. Supplement with 100 nM LDN193189 and 3 µM CHIR99021.\nFor example, to make 10 ml Day 7 medium, combine 5 ml SRM and 5 ml N2 medium. Add the supplements, and the complete medium is ready.\n18. Aspirate medium from the cells and feed cells with the medium prepared above.\nDay 9\n19. Combine SRM and N2 medium at a 1:3 ratio. Supplement with 100 nM LDN193189 and 3 µM CHIR99021.\nFor example, to make 10 ml Day 9 medium, combine 2.5 ml SRM and 7.5 ml N2 medium. Add the supplements, and the complete medium is ready.\n20. Aspirate medium from the cells and feed cells with the medium prepared above.\nDay 11\n21. Passage cells as follows:\n         \nWash cells once with 2 ml DPBS per well and add 1 ml pre-warmed Accumax per well.\nIncubate at 37°C for 3 min. After 3 min, monitor cells under a light microscope.\nIf the cells are rounded and detached from the plate, they are ready to harvest. If not, incubate 2 to 3 min longer in the incubator. Do not over-incubate because it may reduce the viability of the cells.",
    "Transfer cell suspension to a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube and add 5 ml complete neurobasal medium. Wash wells with 1 ml complete neurobasal medium to collect the remaining cells and transfer to 15-ml tube containing the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge cell suspension for 3 min at 300 × g. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in NPC medium freshly supplemented with 3 µM CHIR99021 and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\nThe resuspension volume varies depending on the number of wells collected. It is recommended to resuspend in 1 ml per collected well.\nCount cells and plate at a density of 7 × 106 cells/2 ml/well in a Geltrex-coated 6-well plate. Label plate with the passage of the iPSCs at the time of plating and the NPC passage number.\nFor example, if the iPSCs were passage 20 when plated at Day -1, label the plate P20N0. This step is passage 0 of the NPCs. The NPCs are not fully patterned yet and require an additional 2 days of patterning with CHIR99021.\nDay 12\n22. The next day, monitor cell viability under a light microscope.\nA significant number of cells will be dead, but the culture should consist of a very confluent monolayer.\n23. Aspirate medium and wash cells once with 2 ml DPBS to remove the dead cells and debris.\n24. Feed cells with NPC medium freshly supplemented with 3 µM CHIR99021.\nDays 13 to 16\n25. Each day, aspirate medium and feed cells with NPC medium.\nDay 18\n26. Passage cells on Day 18 and then every 7 days at 7 × 106 cells/well in NPC medium freshly supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor in a Geltrex-coated 6-well plate.\nThe NPCs form a dense monolayer that should be free of contaminants (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0002]D–F).",
    "This protocol describes quality control of the NPCs obtained in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0001]. It is very important to perform and document this quality control to ensure that the NPCs express gene markers of a midbrain and floor-plate fate (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0003]). It is suggested to perform this quality control once, early after differentiation, such as at passage 1 or 2. If the NPCs do not express satisfactory levels of marker genes, it is likely that they will not produce desirable yields of dopaminergic neurons (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0004]). In such a case, new NPCs will need to be produced. To confirm NPC identity (rather than their brain-region patterning), additional techniques such as immunofluorescence can be used to check for expression of NPC markers (not described here; Cheng et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0022]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d3cfcd4d-58ed-4f77-954e-b87d18d6d8eb/cpcb98-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nExample of NPC quality control. Two NPC lines were generated from the same 4.6 iPSC line. However, one NPC line failed quality control, whereas the other passed. The NPC line that failed the quality control shows lower expression levels of floor-plate and midbrain gene markers. This same line also shows greater levels of roof-plate and caudal marker genes, which are not desirable when producing dopaminergic neurons.\nMaterials\nNPCs (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0001])\nNPC medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-rec-0006]), 37°C\nDPBS (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 14190250)\nTRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 15596026)\nRNA purification kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 74104)\ncDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "Differentiation of astrocytes can be achieved by different methods, using either iPSCs or neuralized progenitors as starting material (Chandrasekaran, Avci, Leist, Kobolak, & Dinnyes, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0002]). TCW and colleagues described production of astrocytes from forebrain NPCs using a commercial medium produced by ScienCell Research Laboratories (TCW et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0018]). This method has many advantages: it requires a single type of medium, involves little hands-on time, and produces functioning astrocytes in a relatively short period of time (28 days). However, it requires supplementation of medium with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), which may affect downstream applications. Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0003] describes production of astrocytes from a population of midbrain-patterned NPCs (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0001]) using ScienCell astrocyte medium. To initiate differentiation, NPCs are plated at low density, continuously maintained in astrocyte differentiation medium, and passaged every 7 days until Day 28. The growth rate of different NPC lines may vary, especially in the first 14 days of differentiation. Therefore, the timing of cell passaging should be adjusted according to the NPC line of interest. Cell morphology is a visual indicator of differentiation and progressively changes, from small NPCs to large, flat astrocytes (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0004]A-C).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b7ed13a8-98fc-471a-98ef-368812f86601/cpcb98-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

The astrocytes can be frozen and/or plated for experiments.\nDepending on the cell line, the rate of astrocyte growth can decrease after the final differentiation stage.\nAppropriate quality control of the astrocytes (not described here) should be performed. This includes at least immunofluorescence staining of astrocytic markers (e.g., GFAP, CD44, vimentin; TCW et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0018]; di Domenico et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0004]) and a functional assay such as an IL-6 cytokine secretion assay (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0004]D).",
    "The following protocol describes differentiation of regionalized NPCs (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0001]) into dopaminergic neurons. For differentiation, NPCs are plated at a high density and subsequently incubated in dopaminergic neuron differentiation medium (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0005]A-C). Between Day 7 and Day 10, most cells extend long neurites (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0005]C), whereas others fail to differentiate. The culture is then depleted of these undifferentiated CD133+ NPCs by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), resulting in a highly enriched neuronal culture ready to be plated for experiments (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-fig-0005]D).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3ff445d5-aeee-45e1-872a-44a8b59171de/cpcb98-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nRepresentative images of iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons at Day 0 (A), Day 3 (B), and Day 7 (C) and after MACS isolation of CD133- dopaminergic neurons (D). During differentiation, a large number of NPCs progressively die, and the surviving cells either differentiate into neurons or remain undifferentiated.

To avoid disturbing the neurons, replace only 50% of the dopaminergic neuron differentiation medium every 2 days until cells are ready for analysis.\nThere may be occasional undifferentiated NPCs remaining in the neuronal culture after MACS sorting. Under certain culture conditions, these NPCs may divide, so treatment with cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC) may be necessary to stop their propagation. The concentration and duration of AraC treatment need to be optimized for each application, but 5 µM AraC for 24 hr is a good starting point.",
    "Communication between neurons and astrocytes regulates a variety of processes that can be recapitulated in vitro (di Domenico et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0004]; Hasel et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0008]; Ioannou et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-bib-0009]). To investigate these interactions, different culture systems can be implemented, such as direct or indirect co-culture as well as culture in conditioned medium prepared from neurons or astrocytes. The following protocol describes the steps needed to establish a direct iPSC-derived neuron/astrocyte co-culture that ensures optimal viability of both neurons and astrocytes for ≥2 weeks.\nMaterials\niPSC-derived astrocytes (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0003])\nDPBS (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 14190250)\nAccumax (Innovative Cell Technologies, cat. no.

Wash cells once with 1 or 3 ml DPBS and incubate in 1 or 3 ml pre-warmed Accumax at 37°C until cells detach from the plate or dish. Transfer cell suspension to a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube and add 5 ml astrocyte medium.\nThe volumes of DPBS and Accumax depend on the plate or dish used. It is recommended to use 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate and 3 ml per 10-cm dish.",
    "3. Centrifuge cell suspension for 3 min at 300 × g. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 ml astrocyte medium. Count cells with a hemocytometer and plate 9600 cells/100 µl/well in a Geltrex-coated 96-well plate.\nOccasionally, the astrocytes do not attach evenly to the wells and concentrate at the center or near the edges. To prevent this, first move the plate with several back-and-forth and left-to-right motions at the time of plating. Then, do not move the plate and let the cells attach for 15 to 30 min at room temperature. Transfer the plate to a cell culture incubator without perturbing the cells.\n4. The next morning, supplement astrocyte medium with 5 to 8 µM AraC by adding 100 µl of 2× AraC concentrated solution (i.e., 10 to 16 µM) directly to each well (1× final).\nTreat the astrocytes with the AraC-containing medium for 24 hr to stop cellular division. The optimal AraC concentration may vary depending on the astrocyte line.\n5. After 24 hr, remove AraC-containing medium and replace it with 200 µl fresh astrocyte medium per well.\nWhen removing the medium from the wells of the 96-well plate, it is advised to use a manual pipet with a 200-µl tip and to avoid use of an aspirator, which could lift the cells off the plate.\nThe astrocytes are ready for co-culture, and they must be used within 1 week. If the astrocytes are not used immediately, return the plate to the incubator and change the medium every 3 days.",
    "6. Prepare iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons as described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.98#cpcb98-prot-0004]. After MACS depletion of the culture, resuspend CD133- neurons in 300 µl complete neurobasal medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Count cells with a hemocytometer and plate 10,000 to 13,000 neurons/200 µl/well into 96-well plates pre-plated with AraC-treated, iPSC-derived astrocytes (see step 5).\nThe optimal density for neuron plating may vary depending on the neuron line and experimental needs.\n7. Maintain the co-culture in complete neurobasal medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS and only change 50% of the medium every 2 to 3 days.\nThe 50% medium change will allow the nutrients to be replenished without perturbing the neurons. The co-culture can be maintained for ≤3 weeks. Longer culture may exhibit loss of viability of the neurons and/or astrocytes."
