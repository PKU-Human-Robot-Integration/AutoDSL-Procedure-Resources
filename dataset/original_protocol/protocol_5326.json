    "Induction of PHB biosynthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 upon nitrogen deprivationFor nitrogen step down experiments as described in (Grundel et al., 2012; Damrow et al., 2016), an axenic pre-culture of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (2 x 250 ml) grows in Erlenmeyer flasks to an OD750 of 0.5 at 28 °C under continuous illumination with white light of 80 µmol photons m-2 sec-1 in BG11 medium (see Recipes) containing 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) and 17.6 mM sodium nitrate as the nitrogen source. For nitrogen deprivation, cells (500 ml) are pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with 500 ml BG110 (see Recipes), which lacks sodium nitrate ‘-N’ (Stanier et al., 1971). The final cell suspension is split (2 x 250 ml) and both cultures ‘-N’ and ‘+N’ are supplemented with sodium acetate (final concentration 10 mM) as described by (Hein et al., 1998). Sodium nitrate is only added to the control ‘+N’ sample (final concentration 17.6 mM). The cultivation upon nitrogen deprivation is–likewise to the pre-culture cultivation–implemented in Erlenmeyer flasks at 28 °C under continuous shaking (80 rpm; Multitron Pro ‘Algae Special’) and continuous illumination using white light (80 µmol photons m-2 sec-1) for seven days.Quantification of dry weight10 ml of each cell culture is pelleted by centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min), washed twice with 10 ml sterile water and finally concentrated up to 1 ml and transferred into a 1.5 ml reaction tube which has to be pre-weighted before. After another centrifugation step (10,000 x g, 3 min) the supernatant is entirely removed and the remaining cell pellet is dried completely at 80 °C in a thermomixer overnight (open cap).",
    "The dry weight of the cells (~5 mg) is determined by the weight of the ‘cell tubes’ subtracted from the dead weight of the tube (Table 1).Table 1. Determined dry weightsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713020035_4894.jpgExtraction and de-polymerization of PHB to (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (Figure 1) by alkaline hydrolysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713020159_9519.jpgFigure 1. Hydrolytic degradation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) to (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (R-3-HB)0.5 N NaOH (< 5 mg DW→300 µl 0.5 N NaOH; > 5 mg DW→400 µl 0.5 N NaOH) are added to the dried cell pellet from step 2 (‘+N’ and ‘-N’, separately) and incubated at 85 °C for 1 h by continuously shaking in a thermomixer and vigorously vortexing from time to time both to break the cells and to hydrolyze PHB into its monomer (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (R-3-HB) as described by (Yu and Marchessault, 2000; Cui et al., 2006). After cooling on ice, the samples (‘+N’ and ‘-N’, separately) are neutralized by the addition of 1 N HCl in a ratio of four volumes 0.5 N NaOH (e.g., 300 µl) to one volume 1 N HCl (e.g., 100 µl). The samples (‘+N’ and ‘-N’, separately) are thoroughly mixed by vortexing. Afterwards the R-3-HB containing fraction (supernatant) of each sample (‘+N’ and ‘-N’, separately) is separated from the cell debris (pellet) by centrifugation (1 min, 4,500 x g, room temperature). The R-3-HB containing fraction (supernatant) is transferred to a new 1.5 ml reaction tube for each sample (‘+N’ and ‘-N’, separately). For further quantitative analysis, the R-3-HB containing samples (‘+N’ and ‘-N’, separately) are diluted in ratio of 1:10 dilution with bi-distilled water.Spectrophotometric quantification of R-3-HB monomersThe R-3-HB content in each sample (‘+N’ and ‘-N’, separately) is finally spectrophotometrically quantified via an enzymatic assay.",
    "In a redox reaction, R-3-HB is oxidized to acetoacetate while NAD+ is reduced to NADH/H+ catalyzed in a 1:1 stoichiometry by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713020448_5697.jpgFigure 2. Coupled enzymatic assay of R-3-HB oxidation by the 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and simultaneous reoxidation of NADH/H+ to NAD+ by the PMS-INT system forming a stable color precipitateIn order to prevent a backward reaction (reduction of acetoacetate to R-3-HB; oxidation of NADH/H+ to NAD+), the NADH/H+ synthesis is directly coupled to a phenazinemethosulphate-p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (PMS-INT) colorimetric assay as described by (Lim and Buttery, 1977; Hinman and Blass, 1981). Here, the electron is transferred in a 1:1 stoichiometry from NADH/H+ via PMS to INT. The reduced form of INT is a stable formazan, which absorbs light at a wavelength of 500 nm (or 505 nm) (Lim and Buttery, 1977) (Figure 2). The level of R-3-HB is proportional both to the level of synthesized NADH/H+ and of formazan (Figure 2). 100 µl of the diluted sample from step 3 or 100 µl 1 mM standard ((R)-3-hydroxybutyric) is added into a cuvette (1 ml assay volume) containing (triplicates for each sample):730 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5 (optimum pH for oxidation reaction) 50 µl 1 mM NAD+ 10 µl 0.5 mM PMS 100 µl 0.05 mM INT The reaction is monitored at 25 °C as the change (∆E = E2 - E1) in A500 (or 505 nm) on spectrophotometer before (E1) and ten min after (E2) initiation with 10 µl 15 U/ml HBDH according to the protocol as described in (Hinman and Blass, 1981) (Table 2). Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5 (50 mM) is used as a blank.Table 2.

    "jpgThe R-3-HB (and thus PHB) level is calculated via the calibration series of six different NADH/H+ concentrations ranging from 0, (0.1), 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mM (triplicates for each concentration) in a PMS-INT formazan reaction. Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5 (50 mM) is used as a blank. Here, the ∆E (Table 3) is determined at 25 °C as the change in A500 (or 505 nm) on spectrophotometer before (E1) and three min after (E2) addition of 100 µl respective NADH/H+ standard solution to a cuvette containing (triplicates for each sample): 730 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5 60 µl bi-distilled water 10 µl 0.5 mM PMS 100 µl 0.05 mM INTTable 3.
