    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection and stabilization of human kidney tissue after surgical excision\nTiming: 1 h\nThis portion of the protocol enables collection and stabilization of human kidney tissue after key clinical diagnostic workup. Assessments are made for experimental pathological assessment and multimodal analysis. Human kidney tissue was surgically removed during a full nephrectomy and remnant tissue was processed for research purposes by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Remnant biospecimens were collected in compliance with the Cooperative Human Tissue Network standard protocols and National Cancer Institute’s Best Practices for the procurement of remnant surgical research material. Participants were consented for remnant tissue collection in accordance to institutional IRB policies.\nPrepare the kidney tissue for freezing.\nDe-identified human kidney tissues are collected from surgical resections selected based on patient and clinical metadata (e.g., specific age range). All patients must have consented to allow their tissue to be used for research purposes.\nCut the kidney in half coronally, generally the longest plane (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCut out a portion of the kidney (∼80 × 60 × 4 mm) that is farthest away from tumor or diseased areas using a scalpel or other blade (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPhotograph the smaller piece of kidney in reference to its original location within the entire kidney (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nSmaller or larger tissue pieces can be extracted depending on the original size of the organ, tumor location, and desired number of samples. The size of the pieces that require embedding are essential for proper freezing.\nFurther cut the piece of kidney into 3–5 smaller pieces (∼2 × 15 × 4 mm, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Critical: Larger kidney resections result in freezing artifacts from uneven freezing between the outside and the center of the tissue. To prevent this, we recommend freezing tissues that are ∼2 × 15 × 4 mm or smaller.\nPhotograph the smaller pieces to reference how they were cut so that the smaller pieces that are frozen and embedded can be traced back to the larger organ (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nEach of these pieces will later be cut in half, where one half will be fresh frozen (Step 2) and the other formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) (Step 3).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/928-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Kidney resections\nSection of resected kidney with the superior and inferior poles labeled.\n(A) Whole kidney cut in half, coronally with superior and inferior poles labeled (black dotted line).\n(B) A portion of the kidney (∼80 × 60 × 4 mm) that is farthest away from the tumor (green dotted line).\n(C) The extracted portion is divided into thirds or fourths to ensure event freezing (blue dotted line).\nThe stabilization and freezing procedure for fresh frozen tissue blocks.\nPlace a layer of dry ice into a freezer box and add enough isopentane to make a slurry.\nRemove kidney tissue blocks from plastic encasing and measure the weight, length, width, and height (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPlace a metal weigh boat on top of the isopentane slurry and let cool.\nWrite the sample number and orientation onto mold edges, indicating inner/outer and superior/inferior edges (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nAdd tissue to the metal boat and wait until the tissue is completely frozen.\nAdd enough 2.6% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to cover the bottom of the embedding mold.",
    "Note: CMC is used as an embedding material rather than more common embedding materials, such as optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, to avoid introducing chemical interferences during MS analysis (Stoeckli et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). While other embedding materials are compatible for IMS (Gill et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], Strohalm et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), they require optimization and testing compatibility with different methodologies.\nPlace the embedding mold with CMC on top of the isopentane slurry.\nWait until CMC starts to freeze and begins to turn opaque (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], center).\nPlace tissue onto freezing CMC layer and slowly add more CMC until the tissue is completely covered (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], left).\nWhen completely frozen, wrap in foil, label, and store at −80°C.\nNote: Foil has a lower specific heat than other storage containers (e.g., plastic) so this prevents freeze/thaw artifacts from uneven cooling/freezing. This is most important right after freezing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/928-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The tissue is light pink.\n(C) Tissue appearance after exposure to warm water. The tissue turns bright pink when exposed to warm water.\nFixing and embedding procedure for FFPE tissue.",
    "Carefully place a non-frozen piece of tissue into an embedding cassette with the cut side facing down and submerge in a 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution for at least 12 h but typically 18 h.\nThe tissue can be left in fixative for up to 24 h, although this will vary based on tissue type and thicknesses.\nMove the tissue cassettes into 70% ethanol for 35 min.\nSubmerge the tissue into 90% ethanol for 35 min.\nSubmerge the tissue in 95% ethanol for 35 min.\nSubmerge the tissue into three sequential containers of 100% ethanol, each for 35 min.\nSubmerge the tissue in 100% xylenes for 35 min, three times (total of 105 min). Fresh xylene solutions are required for each separate submersion.\nSubmerge the tissue in paraffin (wax) for 60 min, three times (total of 3 h).\nThe tissue is then embedded with additional paraffin at ∼20°C (room temperature) to make a block such that the tissue is entirely encased.\nPathological assessment of PAS-stained FFPE tissues\nTiming: 1–2 days\nBy the end of this major step, a representative histological stain of a human kidney tissue section is assessed for normalcy by a pathologist prior to multimodal imaging. After pathological assessment, each tissue can be classified by proportion of medulla and/or cortex, disease, or artifacts.\nProcedure for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of FFPE tissues for histological assessment (adapted from Munro, 1971[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: Hematoxylin and eosin or other histological staining procedures can be used instead of a PAS stain and may be preferred for other tissue types. PAS is optimal for kidney assessment, as it allows assessment of proximal tubular brush borders and other kidney structures. Specific histological stains may be optimal for specific tissues and an expert pathologist should be consulted before choosing a staining procedure.",
    "At the beginning of the staining process, staining reagents should be equilibrated to ∼20°C (room temperature) from refrigerator storage.\nDeparaffinize tissue by submerging in xylenes for 3 min, twice. The wax should be removed, and the tissue should look transparent. Additional washes can be incorporated as needed for complete paraffin removal.\nRehydrate the tissue using graded alcohol solutions and distilled water.\nBegin by submerging in 100% ethanol for 1 min, twice.\nSubmerge the tissue in 95% ethanol for 1 min.\nSubmerge the tissue in 70% ethanol for 1 min.\nSubmerge the tissue in 100% water for 1 min.\nRinse the tissues with generous amounts of distilled water.\nIncubate the tissue in 0.5% periodic acid in distilled water for 10 min for tissue oxidation.\nNote: The periodic acid solution can be reused for ∼1 month before needing to be replaced.\nRinse the tissues generously with distilled water.\nIncubate the tissues in Schiff’s reagent for 30 min.\nNote: Different tissue types require different incubation times, generally ranging from 15–30 min.\nThe Schiff’s reagent can be reused for ∼1 month before needing to be replaced.\nRinse the tissues in generous amounts of warm (∼40°C) water.\nWhile distilled water is preferred, heated tap water is sufficient for this step.\nThe tissue should appear pink after rinsing with warm water (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCounterstain the tissue in hematoxylin for 1 min and rinse generously with distilled water.\nDip the tissue section into 0.5% ammonium hydroxide a single time and rinse with generous amounts of distilled water.\nThe tissue should be rinsed until the runoff water is colorless.\nDehydrate the tissue using graded alcohol solutions.\nDip the tissue 10 times for ∼ 1 s into 95%, 95%, 100%, and 100% ethanol solutions, sequentially, with ten dips for each different solution.",
    "If the last 100% ethanol rinse is colored by residual stain, additional washing in new 100% ethanol solution should be performed.\nSubmerge the tissue in xylenes for 1 min, twice.\nCoverslip the tissues for long term storage and higher quality microscopy.\nDip the tissue in xylenes, remove slide and hold horizontally and add 2–3 drops of cytoseal to the tissue surface.\nLine up the slide and cover slip before slowly placing the coverslip on the slide.\nIf needed, use a dissecting tool or other pointed object to remove/displace bubbles from the tissue by gently pressing down on the cover slip.\nCritical: Any bubbles between the tissue and coverslip will prevent acquisition of high-quality microscopy images.\nImage slides using a Leica brightfield scanner (or equivalent) at 20× (∼1 μm spatial resolution) and save the file.\nHistological assessment of FFPE tissue for determining tissue architecture, disease, and normalcy.\nDetermine the percentage of cortex, medulla, renal pyramids, and renal pelvis within the tissue section.\nDetermine the presence or absence of kidney diseases or sampling degradation, such as autolysis or non-renal diseases (e.g., cancer).\nAssess the severity of common renal diseases (0–3, None-Severe), such as glomerular or tubulointerstitial diseases.\nSample preparation for multimodal workflows\nTiming: 1–3 days\nThis protocol describes cryosectioning, microscopy, and RNA assessment in preparation for and prior to samples entering the multimodal workflow.\nCryosection fresh frozen tissue onto a glass slide or coverslip for different analytical workflows.\nSet the internal temperature of the cryostat to −21°C and object temperature to −20°C.\nClean the blade with ethanol and a lint free wipe to remove potential chemical contaminants before placing the blade into the cryostat.\nMount the CMC embedded tissue onto a cold chuck using OCT. Take care to avoid OCT touching the tissue directly, and only contact the CMC shell.",
    "A flat surface can be shaved onto the mounting surface using a razor blade to ensure correct orientation and enhanced tissue block adherence.\nCritical: OCT causes significant ion suppression during mass spectrometry analysis. Tissue that directly touches OCT should be discarded.\nAdjust angle of sectioning stage (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) to ensure quality sectioning.\nPoor angle adjustment causes CMC embedding to fragment and lose structural integrity during sectioning. The angle adjustment depends on the flatness and orientation of the tissue as well as the blade that is used. This will need to be optimized for procedure.\nTrim the CMC shell using 30–50 μm step increments until the tissue becomes visible.\nThe blade often dulls during this trimming step and may need to be replaced for high-quality and/or serial sections.\nExcess CMC surrounding the tissue may be removed with a cooled razor blade to reduce section size and improve sectioning.\nAdjust the section thickness setting to 10 μm and section until the portion of the tissue for multimodal analysis is reached, this often is when the entire tissue face is cut, rather than part or portion of the tissue face.\nPosition the anti-roll bar, such that it is ahead of the blade, but does not scrape the tissue.\nIf the anti-roll bar is too far forward it scrapes the tissue, but if it is pulled back too far, the tissue section will roll and fold during sectioning.\nSection until the desired number of tissue sections are acquired (at least one for each modality although multiple sections for modality may be beneficial for technical replicates). Manipulate sections onto slides with a fine tipped paint brush and thaw mount using a gloved hand and then place mounted, cut tissue on a 20°C hot plate for 30 s.",
    "Imaging mass spectrometry analysis requires mounting onto indium tin oxide coated slides or another conductive substrate.\nCODEX immunofluorescence analysis requires mounting onto poly-lysine coated coverslips.\nTissue sections should be stored in a desiccator if undergoing immediate analysis within 24 h or −80°C within a vacuum sealed slide holder for longer term storage.\nCritical: If serial sections are required for multimodal analysis, it is imperative that the tissues are high-quality and devoid of wrinkles, folds, or damage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/928-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cryostat configuration\n(A and B) (A) Unadjusted angle and (B) adjusted angle of the cryostat blade holder.\nPerform autofluorescence microscopy on each tissue section to acquire a nondestructive image of the tissue that can be used for later registration.\nSections stored in a desiccator can be immediately used, otherwise slides should return to 20°C within a desiccator to prevent artifacts.\nPlace the slide within the microscope adapter and insert into the Zeiss AxioScan Slide Scanner or equivalent.\nPerform coarse focusing on the tissue using the DAPI filter set (ex. 335–383 nm; em. 420–470 nm, blue), 90% lamp power, and 150 ms exposure times.\nPerform fine focusing on the tissue using the DAPI, GFP (ex. 450–490 nm; em. 500–550), and DsRed (ex. 538–562 nm; em. 570–640) filter sets to build a focus map using 90% lamp power and 150 ms exposure times.\nDefine an imaging region that includes the entire tissue section and acquire an autofluorescence image.\nNote: While we describe performing autofluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss AxioScan Slide Scanner, other fluorescence microscopy systems can be used so long as they can perform whole tissue imaging with the described filters. Differences in lamp power and excitation power are expected and depend on the employed system and light source. These parameters should be optimized by the individual user for each sample type.",
    "Determine the RNA quality of the tissue block (adapted from Masato Hoshi; Lake et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nSubmerge the tissue section into 750 μL of TRIzoILS and homogenize the sample by passaging through a 23G then a 27G syringe needle.\nFreeze the homogenate solution on dry ice, thaw, and mix by vortexing. Then, dilute the homogenate solution with RNase free water to a final volume of 960 μL.\nAdd 40 μL of a 5 mg/mL glycogen solution to the homogenate, vortex, and incubate for 5 min at 20°C.\nAdd 250 μL of chloroform and vortex for 15 s before centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Once complete, pipette the supernatant in new container.\nAdd 600 μL of isopropanol, mix, and incubate at –20°C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 600 μL of 80% ethanol diluted in RNase free water and vortex.\nCentrifuge the solution at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant, and dry down the sample using nitrogen or another inert gas.\nAdd 300 μL of RLT plus buffer containing 1% 2-ME and mix before adding 450 μL 100% ethanol.\nTransfer 750 μL of the solution to a RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 × g and 24°C.\nCentrifuge the phase lock gel at 12,000 × g for 5 min before adding the TRIzol mixture and 500 μL of RPE buffer. Then centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 1 min at 24°C.\nDiscard the flow through, add an additional 500 μL of RPE buffer to the column, and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 24°C. Discard the flow through again.",
    "Centrifuge the mixture again for 1 min at 12,000 × g and 24°C. Discard the flow through.\nOpen the column lid and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 24°C to dry the column membrane.\nPlace the column in a new container and add 10 μL of RNase free water in the center of the column membrane. Incubate for 2 min at 20°C before centrifuging at 12,000 × g and 24°C for 3 min.\nAdd 10 μL of RNase free water in the center of the column membrane and incubate for 2 min at 20°C before centrifuging at 12,000 × g and 24°C for 3 min.\nObtain the RNA integrity number (RIN) and percentage of RNA fragments >200 nucleotides in size (DV 200) analysis to assess the RNA integrity.\nImaging mass spectrometry\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis protocol describes imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) specific sample preparation and IMS analysis on fresh frozen tissue sections for 10 μm spatial resolutions for 200 lipid species.(Neumann et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10], Caprioli et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], McDonnell and Heeren, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])\nMatrix application onto the tissue surface.\nApply 6 psi of nitrogen to the sprayer nozzle and turn on the TM sprayer.\nOpen the software and set the nozzle temperature to 40°C.\nChange the LC solvent composition to 100% acetonitrile and flow rate to 0.05 mL/min.\nLoad the sample loop with 5 mL of pure acetonitrile and spray from the sample loop for 2 min to ensure cleanliness of the instrument.\nLoad 6 mL of matrix solution (5 mg/mL 1,5-diaminonaphthalene in tetrahydrofuran) into the sample loop.\nSwitch sprayer to “Inject” and spray for ∼1 min.

Example of a matrix coated slide\nAn example of uniform matrix coating of sample of a sample outlined using sharpie on the back of the slide.\nCritical: While we describe performing matrix application with a commercial TM Sprayer, there are many ways to apply matrix (e.g. airbrush, sublimation, and sieving) (Neumann et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) as well as many different types of matrices (e.g. 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 2′,6′-dihydroxyacetophenone). Each of these matrix application methods and matrices require different optimizations, particularly if 10 μm spatial resolution is an important attribute of the experiment. If matrix is not applied as described here, we cannot guarantee 10 μm spatial resolution is possible.\nMALDI imaging mass spectrometry analysis of fresh frozen tissue (Caprioli et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Note: While we describe performing imaging mass spectrometry on a Bruker MALDI timsTOF platform, (Spraggins et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) a multitude of imaging mass spectrometry systems can be used. Differences in laser power and methods parameters are expected and should be optimized by the individual user for each sample type.\nUsing a flatbed scanner, scan a 3200-dpi image as a jpg of the matrix coated tissue section held in the MTP-slide adapter II with sufficient contrast to visualize the tissue boundaries.\nNote: Tracing the tissue with a sharpie on the back of the slide may help in tissue visualization and region selection (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). This can be performed before or after matrix application.\nInsert the slide adapter plate into the instrument and perform height detection procedures.\nOpen the FlexImaging software and follow the prompts to designate sample file name, method, pitch, scanned image of the slide, etc.\nTrain the target position with three teaching points.\nCreate a measurement region around the tissue for IMS analysis.\nGo to an area off the tissue and ensure the focus of the laser is adequate for 10 μm spatial resolution imaging.\nCritical: An improperly focused laser will not allow for 10 μm imaging and cause artifacts from oversampling.\nStart the MS acquisition of the tissue section.\nNote: Subsections b-e describe tissue acquisition using Bruker software and will vary on other instrument platforms. Generally, the process on other instruments will consist of inserting your sample into the source of the mass spectrometer, designate an imaging area, and train the mass spectrometry stage to the image of the sample.\nCollect post-IMS autofluorescence microscopy of the MALDI ablated sample.\nPerform coarse focusing on the tissue using the GFP filter set (ex. 450–490 nm; em. 500–550, green) with 90% lamp power and 150 ms exposure times.",
    "Perform fine focusing on the tissue using the GFP filter set and brightfield setting.\nDefine the imaging region that includes the entire tissue.\nAcquire brightfield and autofluorescence images of the MALDI ablated sample.\nPost-IMS PAS staining of tissue.\nUnlike above, the PAS staining is performed on the same tissue section as MALDI IMS analysis. First, remove matrix by submerging the slide in 100% ethanol for ∼2–3 min or until matrix is gone.\nSubmerge the slides in 70% ethanol for 3 min.\nThe PAS protocol described above can be performed after the MALDI matrix is removed.\nCritical: Leftover matrix will change the pH of the solutions and prevent adequate staining.\nCODEX multiplexed immunofluorescence\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis protocol describes antibody conjugation, tissue preparation, and microscopy for CODEX multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis (Neumann et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], Goltsev et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). CODEX multiplexed immunofluorescence can be used for labeling cell types or states. In brief, a primary antibody is conjugated to a unique oligonucleotide barcode. All primary antibodies (<50) are added to a tissue section at once. After incubation, these antibodies are fixed to the tissue, enhancing tissue integrity during multiple staining rounds. Secondary (complementary) oligonucleotide barcodes are serially added and removed from the tissue, enabling staining of <50 targets within a single tissue section.\nAntibody conjugation for custom antibody markers (a list of which is provided in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nBlock 50 kDa molecular weight cut off filters with 500 μL of filter blocking solution for 10 min at ∼20°C.\nDilute 50 μg of each antibody into 100 μL in PBS and filter with 50 MW cut off filters.\nReduce antibodies with the reduction mixture for 25 min at ∼20°C.",
    "Note: 25 minutes of reduction is suitable for many antibodies but may need to be optimized (15–40 minutes) depending on the primary antibody used. In general, shorter reduction times are more appropriate than longer times.\nCentrifuge the reduced antibodies at 12,000 X g and add buffer solution.\nRehydrate oligonucleotide barcodes in 10 μL nuclease free water and further dilute with 210 μL of conjugation solution.\nCritical: Nuclease free water must be used; otherwise the oligonucleotide barcodes will be degraded.\nRespective barcode solutions are added to the reduced primary antibodies and incubated for 2 h at ∼20°C.\nThe solution is then purified by buffer exchanging with purification solution and stored in storage solution at ∼4°C.\nCritical: Primary antibodies used for conjugation must be purchased without any additives or preservatives, many of which prevent successful antibody conjugation. Some additives can be removed but this can be difficult and inefficient.\nNote: Freshly conjugated antibodies produce excess background and should not be used for 3 days post-conjugation.\nNote: Conjugated antibodies can be kept within a refrigerator for at least 6 months after conjugation. This varies on the antibody, but we have successfully used custom conjugated antibodies over a year from initial conjugation with good results.\nTissue preparation for CODEX (Goltsev et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], Schürch et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis.\nRemove fresh frozen tissue from −80°C and place inside a desiccator for at least 20 min. Coverslips can be stored using a plastic petri dish.\nSubmerge tissues completely in acetone (∼5 mL) for 5 min using a glass petri dish.\nRehydrate tissues in hydration buffer (∼5 mL) for 3 min inside a humidity chamber.\nFix the tissues for 10 min in 1.6% paraformaldehyde in hydration buffer (∼5 mL).",
    "Submerge tissues in excess staining buffer (∼5 mL) for 30 min using a plastic petri dish or other container.\nIncubate tissues with a blocking buffer and primary antibody cocktail (1:200 antibody dilution, ∼200 μL) for 3 h within a humidity chamber (plastic tupperware with wet paper towel as an example) at ∼20°C.\nNote: Tissues can be incubated in primary antibody solutions overnight if placed inside a refrigerator. Background may increase if longer incubation times are used but may be necessary for some antigen targets.\nNote: The volume of these reagents will depend on the size of the container that the coverslip is placed in. The reagents need to completely cover the coverslip and be in excess.\nRinse samples with staining buffer and fix the primary antibodies to the tissue with 1.6% paraformaldehyde in storage buffer (∼5 mL) for 10 min.\nRinse with excess PBS (∼5 mL) and incubate in cold methanol (∼5 mL) for 5 min. Rinse samples with excess PBS again (∼5 mL).\nFix the samples with fixative solution (∼5 mL) for 10 min before being stored in storage buffer at ∼4°C (∼5 mL).\nPerform fluorescence microscopy and CODEX multiplexed immunofluorescence.\nDilute antibodies in reporter solution to a 1:200 dilution with 1 μL of a 1 mg/mL solution of DAPI.\nNote: Most secondary oligonucleotide barcode reports function at a 1:200 dilution; however, this dilution may need to be optimized in select cases or with custom reagents.\nFill respective bottles with nuclease free water, 1× CODEX buffer, and dimethyl sulfoxide.\nMount a blank coverslip into the coverslip microfluidic chamber of the CODEX instrument and flush the fluidic lines.\nMount the prepared tissue sample and incubate with 1× CODEX buffer and 1 μL of a 1 mg/mL of DAPI for 5 min and wash with the automated CODEX system.",
    "Set up tiled regions covering the tissue and focus at the tissue surface.\nPerform automated microscopy using a Zeiss Axio equipped with a Colibri 7 LED light source and C13440 camera or other equivalent equipment.\nImportant parameters include a 10% tile overlap and a z-stack ranging from 11 to 20 tiles (depending on the tissue size).\nData processing and image registration\nTiming: 2–4 days\nThis protocol describes image registration, data processing, and analysis that integrates the different modalities produced by this workflow.\nData processing\nConvert Bruker (.d) raw file (or other raw data format) into a custom binary data format in profile mode at native spectral resolution.\nPerform mass alignment and calibration of the dataset.\nSpectral misalignment is estimated for each pixel and corrected using PCHIP interpolation or linear shift. Alignment is carried out using a Python msalign package (https://github.com/lukasz-migas/msalign[href=https://github.com/lukasz-migas/msalign]). All spectra are first aligned based on automatically selected peaks and then recalibrated using at least three of the following well-characterized lipids:\nPositive mode: m/z 703.5748, 734.5694, 760.5851, 810.6001.\nNegative mode: m/z 673.4814, 744.5549, 834.5291, 885.5499.\nCreate a mean mass spectrum by taking the mean of each mass bin in the dataset.\nCalculate the ppm error for common lipids, such as [PC(32:0)+H]+ and [PC(34:1)+H]+.\nIf the mass error is >3 ppm, re-calibrate the entire dataset with additional well-characterized ions.\nCompute total ion current (TIC)-based normalization factors for each pixel after alignment and calibration had been performed.\nNote: We employ TIC normalization to avoid outlier intensities skewing the normalization by imposing intensity quantile bounds on the area considered (i.e. only intensity values between the 0.05 and 0.95 intensity quantiles of each mass spectrum are considered). Other normalization procedures can be used and will depend on the mass spectrometer on which the data is acquired.",
    "Perform peak picking on the mean mass spectrum and use the LIPIDMAPS database (Fahy et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Fahy et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Sud et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Sud et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) to annotate each m/z value with a putative annotation.\nUse [M+H]+, [M+H-H2O]+, [M+Na]+, [M+K]+ for positive mode adducts and [M+H]-, [M+Cl]-, [M+HCOO]-, [M+OAc]- for negative mode adducts.\nSpecify a narrow 0.005 m/z mass tolerance window.\nSelect “even chains only”.\nNote: While we suggest these LIPIDMAPS search criteria, many of the adducts will depend on sample preparation methods and the mass tolerance window will depend on the mass accuracy and resolution of the mass spectrometer employed.\nCalculate the ppm error associated with each assignment and remove assignments with errors >5 ppm, although most have errors <3 ppm.\nExtract peak intensity from the calibrated dataset using one of the available options:\nExtract ion images based on an untargeted feature list that has not been narrowed down by the previous step.\nExtract ion images based on the identified feature list generated using the previous step.\nNote: In either case, narrow 3–5 m/z bin extraction windows are created for each selected peak and the ion images are generated. The width of the extraction window is important because if it is too wide, several poorly resolved ions can be captured within one ion image.\nExport the extracted peak intensities to a columnar CSV file by concatenating the x and y-coordinates from the registration step with the preselected ions in the form: x, y, m/z 1, m/z 2 … m/z N.\nRead-in the table into Python and export the peak intensities to an imzML file using the Python pyimzML library (https://github.com/lukasz-migas/pyimzML[href=https://github.com/lukasz-migas/pyimzML]).\nImage alignment and registration of each modality (Patterson et al., 2018b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], Patterson et al., 2018a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nGenerate a MALDI imaging mass spectrometry pixel map using regToolboxMSRC (https://github.com/nhpatterson/regtoolboxmsrc[href=https://github.com/nhpatterson/regtoolboxmsrc]).",
    "Using FIJI ImageJ, select corresponding laser ablation marks and IMS pixels in the post-acquisition autofluorescence image map and IMS pixel map, respectively.\nUse a \"Landmark Correspondences\" FIJI plugin to find an affine transformation between the two images, resampling the post-AF image to the IMS pixel map by selecting post-AF image as source image, and IMS pixel map as the template image within the plugin.\nSave the transformed and registered post-AF image.\nUsing wsireg (https://github.com/nhpatterson/wsireg[href=https://github.com/nhpatterson/wsireg]) to align other microscopy modalities, such as CODEX multiplexed IF, preIMS AF, PAS or any other associated microscopy image, to the newly saved post-AF image. Wsireg will generate pyramidal OME-TIFF images for all images after registration.\nWhen complete, all images will be sampled in the same coordinates as the IMS pixel map and IMS can be overlaid onto microscopy by scaling the IMS data to the same resolution as the microscopy data."
