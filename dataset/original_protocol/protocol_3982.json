    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConstruction of behavioral testing enclosures\nTiming: 2–4 days\nPrepare following apparatuses (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]):\n1 m2 box (or 80 cm2 box) made of black acryl and a polarizing white cue card (216 mm × 280 mm)\nAcquire following materials for the construction (See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for details): acryl sheet plexiglass plastic with non-glare surface on one side, bolt-together framing, and screws + nuts.\nCut the acryl plexiglass into four 30 cm × 80 cm sheets\nAlign the sheets perpendicularly (non-glare surface inside) with bolt-together frames and drill two holes (3/8” diameter) on the corners of each sheet.\nForm open field box and secure corners by fastening the screw and nuts on bolt-together frame.\nAttach white paper (letter size) on one of the walls as a visual cue.\nA rubber mat (used in upside-down) is used for a bottom of the open field.\nNote: Make sure to have the non-glare surface facing inside the box so that there is no reflection during training/recording session.\nTwo 1-m long linear tracks:\nAcquire following materials for the construction (See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for details): acryl sheet plexiglass plastic with non-glare surface and aluminum 90° frame.\nFor linear track A, cut the acryl plexiglass into three 10 cm × 100 cm sheets and two 10 cm × 10 cm sheets. Form linear track by securing the corners between the sheets using the 90° aluminum frames and attaching through epoxy. Attach white visual cues on the inner walls of black linear track. Cut the rubber mat and put it as flooring for unique tactile cue.",
    "For linear track B, repeat as above. However, cover the entire inner walls with non-reflective white sheets (See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and use black marker to draw unique pattern of visual cues. Lastly, cover the floor with white sandpaper for unique tactile cue.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/947-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation for open field box and linear tracks\n(A and B) (A) Construct open field box (1 m × 1 m or 80 cm × 80 cm) and (B) linear tracks (1 m) from black acryl board. Make sure that one of the surfaces has a matte finish to reduce reflected light. Use appropriate bolt together frames from McMaster-Carr to build stable and secure box and tracks.\nElectrode and surgery preparation\nTiming: 1–2 weeks per mouse\nConstruct and surgically implant a multielectrode drive for electrophysiological recordings.\nConstruct a custom-built 64-channel drive as described previously (Brunetti et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Liang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) to target the CA1 of the hippocampus and superficial layer of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nForm 6 cm 2 × 2 bundle with outer polymide (30G) tubing.\nNote: Try to minimize the gap between each polymide tubing to minimize the size of the bundle.\nCut this bundle at the middle to create two 3 cm 2 × 2 bundles. (One will be used for CA1 of the hippocampus and another will be used for MEC)\nTwo separate bundles, with one targeting CA1 of the hippocampus and another targeting the medial entorhinal cortex, are separated by a distance of 2.5–2.7 mm with height difference 0.8–1.2 mm.\nNote: Attach these bundles to the core using the sticky rubber and little by little modify their positions manually until desired positions are achieved.",
    "Affix the bundles with position mentioned above to the drive core using epoxy and cure overnight to ensure epoxy is completely fixed.\nPlace the spring and shuttle through shaft of microscrew and screw it down to four holes on each side. Have each microscrew placed apart by at least one hole so that they are evenly spread out.\nNote: There are eight holes on each side, but only four holes will be used, because there will be eight tetrodes inserted (double packing) into four cannulas. In contrast to previous work (Liang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) where 34G was used to create the bundle, we use 30G as this is the smallest and durable tubing that we can get it to work without getting it bent during turning.\nPrepare at least eight 0.5 cm anchor polymide (20G) tubing and thread this through each outer tubing (34G). Bring the anchor tubing (20G) and place it inside the guide hole located front of each screw to align outer tubing (30G) to each shuttle. Affix the position of anchoring tube with epoxy.\nPrepare at least eight 3 cm inner polymide (34G) tubing and thread them through outer tubing (30G) and have the 34G tubing affixed to the shuttle using epoxy (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Pay close attention to determine whether inner tubing (34G) can smoothly thread through the outer tubing (30G). There should be no bending nor extra force needed to push inner tubing (34G) through the outer tubing (30G). If any bending is noticed, repeat step e-g at unused adjacent holes for replacement.\nAttach the 64-channel EIB board on top of the drive core.\nThread tetrodes through inner tubing and connect to the EIB board using gold pins. Place two tetrodes per tubing.\nWatch the protocol video for more details (Brunetti et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]): https://www.jove.com/t/51675/design-fabrication-ultralight-weight-adjustable-multi-electrode[href=https://www.jove.com/t/51675/design-fabrication-ultralight-weight-adjustable-multi-electrode].",

For those who are not familiar to general survival surgery in rodents, watch a video in Geiger et al. (Geiger et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nImplantation Surgery\nBegin anesthetizing animals by placing them inside an induction chamber with 2%–3% isoflurane mixed with oxygen flow 0.8–1.0 L/min.\nAdminister subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (working solution 0.015 mg/mL; dose 0.2 mL/20 g) at the start of surgery.\nPlace animals on stereotaxic stage with correct ear bar placement for head fixation.\nContinue anesthetizing mice with reduced isoflurane content (oxygen flow: 0.8–1.0 L/min, 1%–1.5% isoflurane)\nAnimal’s temperature is closely monitored and regulated at 37.0°C throughout the surgery using the thermoregulator system.\nPerform a craniotomy that is sufficiently large for electrode implantation (1.5 mm × 1.5 mm) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])\nFix the head of the mouse in a stereotaxic frame.\nShave hair on the surgical site using hair clipper, followed by disinfection.\nMake a small incision along the sagittal line of the skull.\nLocate and record Bregma and Lambda coordinates. Make sure the height difference between these two sites is less than 100 μm by adjusting head position.\nMark the desired stereotaxic coordinate for electrode implantation.",
    "Note: Craniotomy is centered at AP 2.5 mm ML 2.5 mm from Bregma for the hippocampus (approximately 1.5 × 1.5 mm) and 0.3–0.5 mm anterior to transverse sinus and ML 3.5 mm from midline for medial entorhinal cortex (approximately 1.5 × 1.5 mm).\nNote: The Transverse Sinus is a landmark that can be used to estimate the position of MEC. It can only be identified by thinning the skull near the lambdoid suture. Once the skull is thinned enough to be transparent, rinsing with saline should be able to help with locating and visualizing the Transverse Sinus. Since this vessel is prone to rupture and can cause a lot of bleeding, take extra precaution when removing the dura on top of this vessel. Do not pierce the transverse sinus as it is a landmark. Be prepared to stop bleeding using Surgifoam, bone wax or warm saline.\nMake a Burr hole (0.5 mm diameter) for T1 ground screw using a small (0.5 mm tip) drill (above left cerebellum)\nTemporarily protect the three holes by applying Kwik-Sil.\nUse the Metabond kit for securing the custom-built titanium headplate on (Oval shaped ring with inner diameter 9 mm × 10.169 mm with bottom ring width 1 mm and top ring width 1.412 mm ; ring thickness of 0.794 mm) top of skull.\nNote: We use the headplate for stably anchoring the drive to mouse skull for chronic in vivo recording. In addition, this can act as a platform in which dental cement can be applied around to anchor the drive to the skull without having it flowing out to unwanted skin areas. Metabond cement is quickly cured and is ideal for fixing headplate to the skull. (Design sheet available: http://www.igarashilab.org/resource[href=http://www.igarashilab.org/resource])",
    "Apply enamel etchant (red) for 30–60 s, then wipe it with q-tips and wash with saline. Create a rough surface by scoring with tip of forceps.\nCompletely wipe the surface of the skull and make sure it is dry before placing the headplate.\nMix the quick base, catalyst and cement powder in the tray and apply this mixture between the skull and headplate.\nSeal the gap between the headplate and the skull by applying at the edges of inner ring of headplate.\nSlowly apply more mixture to completely cover the skull and headplate. Make sure to avoid putting any mixture on top of holes covered with Kwik-Sil (if this occurs, gently scrape away the mixture to uncover holes before solidifying)\n(Wait for ∼5 min to completely fix)\nNote: During steps i through n, make sure that Kwik-Sil protecting the holes remains secure and intact.\nRemove the Kwik-Sil to expose the holes for implantation.\nRemove the dura for all three holes using fine forceps. Prepare to stop bleeding using bone wax, Surgifoam or warm saline.\nInsert T1 screw into the cerebellum. Hook up a looped, exposed side of ground wire on the screw. Apply a silver paint and wait until it gets dried. Cover and secure the screw by applying Coldpac dental cement. (Wait for ∼10 min to completely fix)\nBring down the drive and make sure the bundles align and fit to the two holes (one for CA1 and another for MEC). Record the height at which the bundles are contacting the surface of brain and retract vertically ∼3 mm.\nApply Surgilube around the bundles, which will protect tetrodes from contacting the dental cement in subsequent steps.",
    "Bring down the drive back to the recorded height at which bundles contact the surface of brain and apply Coldpac dental cement to secure the drive to the headplate and the skull.\nDisinfect the exposed area between dental cement and edge of the skin with iodine before closing the wound. Then apply 70% ethanol outside of surgical sites around the skin for disinfection.\nClose the wound by attaching the skin to headplate using Vetbond. (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5])\nNote: During any dental cement placement, make sure to avoid any protrusion from the headplate. This will significantly affect animal’s recovery.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/947-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Craniotomy at the CA1 and MEC for electrode implantation\n(A) Craniotomy performed at the CA1 of the hippocamprus and MEC. CA1 hole was drilled at AP 2.5 mm and ML 2.5 mm from Bregma, and MEC hole was drilled 0.3–0.5 mm anterior to Transverse Sinus and ML 3.5 mm from midline.\n(B) Magnified view of exposed surface of holes drilled for CA1 and MEC. Dotted line indicates boundary of transverse sinus.

Completed multi-electrode drive implantation\nFinish implantation with a coat of iodine around the surgery site and Vetbond tissue adhesive surrounding the headplate. Make sure to avoid any caudally protruding dental cement.\nPostoperative recovery\nAllow operated mice to rest for at least 5 days before experimentation.\nNote: Monitor animals’ weight and body condition score (BCS) every day after the surgery. Animals should fully recover before beginning the training. Animals’ body weight should return to their original plus drive weight and their BCS should be three.\nCritical: If the animals take longer than 10 days to recover, there are potential health issues that need to be closely addressed. The two most frequently occurring issues are chronic infection and excess dental cement protruding caudally from the headplate. Excess dental cement will cause pain when the animal is trying to extend their neck backwards, resulting in limited movement and delayed recovery. (See problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1])",
    "Tetrodes need to be turned daily (more than 40 μm) to ensure that they do not get stuck in the position before reaching the target of interest. Make sure to keep track of the distance that tetrodes traveled in a separate log sheet. Maintaining a good record of tetrode position (depth), as well as the number of units obtained from each tetrode is critical for estimating the position of tetrodes in the brain.\nConnect tetrodes to a multichannel, impedance matching, unity gain headage (Neuralynx) daily to check for cluster units.\nNote: The output of the headstage was connected to a data acquisition system (Neuralynx).\nAdvance the tetrodes daily until they reach 1200–1600 μm for CA1 pyramidal cells and 1200–1800 μm for MEC grid cells. Record from neurons detected by tetrodes in open field session at least once a day. Run firing field analysis (see details in ‘data collection and analysis’ section). This will assist with identifying place cells and grid cells. (See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for representative clusters)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/947-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Example clusters during recording session\n(A) Example of spike sorting in energy space to identify single units across sessions, demonstrating stable chronic recording across sessions.\n(B) Autocorrelogram of cell 1. Note the theta-phase tuned peaks.\n(C) Close-up autocorrelogram of cell 1. Note sharp peaks between 0 to ± 10 ms indicating bursts.\nPlace cells should have a clear firing field in a defined area.\nGrid cells should have clear hexagonal pattern of firing fields.\nCA1 pyramidal cell layer can be identified based on their unique physiological properties, particularly their autocorrelation.\nThere are prominent autocorrelation peaks within 10 milliseconds from the time zero of the autocorrelogram. This is known as complex-spike firing pattern. (Csicsvari et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], Ranck, 1973[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20], Renshaw et al., 1940[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22])",
    "Some neurons in CA1 are modulated by theta oscillation, observed as repetitive peaks in every ∼110 ms in the autocorrelogram.\nSuperficial neurons in the MEC are also strongly modulated by theta and this can be identified in the spike autocorrelation. (Fyhn et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) In addition, stronger theta power will be detected in the local field potentials as the tetrode traverses the border from postrhinal cortex to the MEC.\nStop turning when place cells or grid cells are detected from the tetrodes.\nBehavioral testing and recording\nTiming: ∼5 days\nOnce the animals fully recover, they will be food restricted until their body weight is reduced to 85% of their original weight. This is done to motivate the animals to explore toward cookie crumbs during the training/recording session.\nTraining (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/947-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Linear track training\nAnimals are trained to run back and forth in the linear tracks at least 10 laps per session. (Left) All training is performed under dim light. (Right) Representative training session in linear track A is shown with illumination for visualization.\nIn the open field task, motivate exploration by throwing cookie crumbs randomly throughout the enclosure. Each session should last between 15 – 20 min.\nUpon finishing the open field task, rest animals for 5 min in the home cage.",
    "Next, train animals in the remapping task by having them run in 1-m long linear tracks. During this task, animals are required to run in successive series of Track A → Track B → Track B → Track A. Two tracks need to be placed in the same room. Between the sessions, give animals 5 min rest in a home cage. Motivate running by placing cookie crumbs on the end positions of the linear tracks. Each session should last between 5 to 10 min. On the linear tracks, the mice need to run at least 10 full laps (back and forth).\nRecording\nOn the fifth day of training, record units throughout the experiment.\nMake sure to input timestamps into the recording system between the sessions. i.e.,) ‘Openfield begins’, ‘Openfield ends,’ ‘Track A – first begins’, ‘Track A – first ends’, and so on…\nFor spike data collection, amplify unit activity by a factor of 3000–5000 and band-pass filter from 600 Hz to 6000 Hz. Set the threshold for spike waveforms around 25–55 μV. In our case using Neuralynx, the units are time-stamped and digitized at 32 kHz for 1 ms.\nTrack the position of animal using two light-emitting diodes (LEDs), one large and one small, on the head stage (sampling rate 50 Hz) by means of an overhead video camera.\nCritical: (relating to Step 10 - 11: Avoid any freezing during behavior task. It is imperative that animal is constantly moving to cover as much area as possible in the open field box. In the linear tracks, make sure to have the animal running in only one direction except turning at the ends. (See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3])",
    "Critical: (relating to Step 10 - 11): Make sure to get rid of any light source that may be detected during recording. Apply appropriate parameters and threshold to only detect LEDs attached to animal’s headstage for tracking animal’s movement. (See problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nData analysis\nTiming: ∼5–7 days\nPerform spike sorting offline using graphical cluster-cutting softwares. We use a traditional cluster cutting software MClust by Dr. David Redish (https://redishlab.umn.edu/mclust[href=https://redishlab.umn.edu/mclust]) (Redish, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). Several automatic clustering softwares are currently available such as KlustaKwik or Kilosort (Chung et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Kadir et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10], Pachitariu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Rossant et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nIn MClust, manually identify the clusters from two-dimensional projections with parameter space representing waveform amplitude, energy, and peak to valley difference. Track same cluster across all sessions within a day by calculating the L-ratio and isolation distance. (Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25])\nDistinguish putative excitatory cells from putative interneurons by spike peak-to-valley width and average rate. (Bartho et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8])\nChoose a channel that has the largest peak-to-valley amplitude from four channels of each tetrode. Using this channel, calculate the peak-to-valley duration of the spike (peak-to-valley width). Plot the distribution of peak-to-valley width for all recorded neurons (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). There will be a bimodal distribution of the width, and the threshold for defining putative excitatory cells can be set at the boundary of the two peaks. In our case, the threshold was at 230 μs. We also used the threshold of mean firing rates of more than 0.1 Hz to remove cells with very few spikes.",
    "Define putative interneurons with spike-peak-valley width of less than 230 μs. For a practical example of the data analysis, we share spike files and MATLAB codes used in our previous report (Jun et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).

Distribution of principal neurons\nElectrophysiological features for classifying putative principal neurons. Peak to valley time of spike waveform was used to distinguish putative interneurons from principal neurons. Peak to valley time of spike waveform was used to distinguish putative interneurons from principal neurons in CA1 (A, top) and MEC (B, top). Dashed line (230 μs) represents cut off for interneuron to principal neuron classification (Bartho et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). No difference was observed for the distribution of peak to valley time between WT and APP-KI mice for both CA1 neurons and MEC neurons (KS test, p >0.05). (A, bottom- B, bottom) Same data, but were plotted for average firing rate in y-axis. Individual neurons were plotted as triangle (WT) or circle (APP-KI). The plot shows high firing rate for putative interneurons below the 230 μs cut line. (C) Left: Spike wave form representing principal neuron. Right: Spike wave form representing interneuron.\nAnalysis of spikes in the open field box (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]) Run boxSpikeInfo3.m in MATLAB\nThis code collects spike data from an individual cell that is aligned to animal’s position during the open field box recording session.\nPosition data is sorted into 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm bins.",
    "For smoothing the path, 21-sample boxcar window filter is applied.\nFiring rate distribution is determined by counting the number of spikes in each bin as well as the time spent per bin.\nFor smoothing the firing map, boxcar average over the surrounding 5 × 5 bins is applied.\nFor each cell, the following data are extracted:\nPlot showing animal’s path and spikes\nTwo-dimensional firing rate map\nAdapted firing rate map\nShannon’s Spatial Information Score (bits/spike)\nMean Firing Rate\nPeak Firing Rate (highest firing rate observed in any bin from smoothed map)\nNote: Spatial Information Score is a metric for assessing the degree of spatial representation of individual neurons (Skaggs et al., 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). We used Spatial Information Score for defining place cells, by calculating the distribution of Spatial Information Score in the randomly shuffled data (see Figure 1K, (Jun et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])). Mean firing rate and peak firing rate are also important metrics to judge if spiking activity is impaired or not in your animal models.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/947-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

    "Spatial correlation is obtained by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient for mean firing rates across bins from the track on a pair of sessions.\nFor each cell, the following data are extracted:\nPlot showing animal’s path and spikes for each track\nOne-dimensional firing rate map for each track (this information is stored for Population Vector Correlation analysis in subsequent analysis)\nMean spatial correlation value between different tracks\nMean spatial correlation value between same tracks\nNote: For assessing the degree of remapping, we used population vector correlation obtained with analyzePopulationVector.m (see below) (Figures 2E and 2F, (Jun et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Leutgeb et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], Leutgeb et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])). Spatial correlation obtained with analyze4LinearTracks.m can be used as an auxiliary measure for assessing the remapping.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/947-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

Spatial correlation between Track A and Track B is shown at top left.\nCalculation of population vector (PV) correlation in the linear tracks (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]) Run analyzePopulationVector.m in MATLAB\nIn this code, one dimensional firing rate map is converted to 25-binned firing map for individual cell.\nFor each group (i.e., WT), all cells will be collected for performing population vector correlation analysis.\nThere are four sessions in this experiment:\nA1 (first black linear track)\nB2 (first white linear track)\nB3 (second white linear track)\nA4 (second black linear track)",
    "Population vector correlation analysis will be performed for all possible pairs (6 in total; two identical tracks and four different tracks), resulting in separate population vector correlation values for each bin.\nSame track: A1 vs A4 and B2 vs B3 (2 pairs in total)\nDifferent track: A1 vs B2, A1 vs B3, A4 vs B2, and A4 vs B3 (4 pairs in total).\nEach pair will produce PV correlation values for 25 bins.\nFor identical tracks, there will be 50 correlation values (25 bins × 2 pairs).\nFor different tracks, there will be 100 correlation values (25 bins × 4 pairs).\nFollowing data are extracted:\nCumulative distribution plot showing correlation values obtained from identical tracks.\nBar plot showing averaged correlation values obtained from identical tracks.\nCumulative distribution plot showing correlation values obtained from different tracks.\nBar plot showing averaged correlation values obtained from different tracks.\nNote: Population vector (PV) correlation obtained in analyzePopulationVector.m is used as a metric for assessing the degree of remapping (Leutgeb et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], Leutgeb et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). For comparing PV correlation between WT and APP-KI mice, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used for comparing cumulative distribution and rank sum test is used for comparing averaged correlations.\nNote: In our method, we pool data from both running directions (i.e. place maps were calculated only by the density of spikes in each spatial bin regardless of the direction of running). It is previously reported that firing property of place cells is different between two (left and right) running directions (Kjelstrup et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], Leutgeb et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], McNaughton et al., 1983[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16], O'Keefe, 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).

Population vector correlation of ~0 denotes stronger remapping (black arrow) and ~1 denotes weaker remapping (blue arrow). (C) Left: Mean population vector correlation between Track A and Track B. Right: Mean population vector correlation between two recordings in Track A did not differ.\nHistology and reconstruction of recording positions\nTiming: ∼5–7 days\nAnesthetize the drive-implanted mouse using isoflurane\nPerform small electrolytic lesions by passing current (10 μA for 20 s) through the electrodes.\nImmediately administer an overdose of isoflurane to the mouse and perfuse intracardially with saline followed by 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PFA).\nExtract the brain and store in the same fixative overnight. Follow by cryoprotection of the brain in phosphate buffer saline with 30% (w/w) sucrose at 4°C overnight.\nNote: The only way to validate the recording sites is to perform histology. Therefore, experimenters must perform electrolytic lesioning and histologically make sure that the tetrodes were positioned at the region of interest. These histological data should be reported as supplementary data in papers as a proof of correct tetrode positioning.\nIdentify all the tetrodes in area of interest (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/947-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. Histology of CA1 and MEC recording sites\n(A) Representative brightfield image of cresyl violet-stained section showing recording position in CA1. Arrowhead points to the tip of tetrode where the cells were recorded, with electrolytic lesions made before sacrificing the animals.",
    "(B) Representative brightfield image of cresyl violet-stained section showing recording position in superficial layer of MEC. Blue circle denotes recording position in deep layer of MEC and red circle denotes recording position in the superficial layer of MEC. Only the neurons recorded from the superficial layer have been included for analysis. Dashed line indicates the border between the MEC and the postrhinal cortex.\nEmbed tissue samples in O.C.T. mounting medium and cut sagittal sections (40 μm)\nStain sections with cresyl violet.\nAlign sections manually using image softwares (e.g., Adobe Photoshop) and display the images for clear visualization using software (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint) as slides. Trace each tetrode carefully and identify by comparing the tip of each electrode’s adjacent sections."
