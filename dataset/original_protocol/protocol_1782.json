Miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) are the results of spontaneous synaptic transmission in the absence of action potentials, thus reflecting the basal-level synaptic transmission strength. We used Multiclamp recording system (700B amplifier, DigiData 1440A digitizer and pClamp software) (Molecular Devices, CA) to record mEPSCs.\nOn DIV13, add purified recombinant NGPF2 (Zhou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) or PBS as vehicle to the culture medium at a final concentration of 1.5 ng/mL.\nOn DIV14, 24–36 h post NGPF2 treatment, transfer a coverslip using fine forceps to recording chamber, that contains ECF supplemented with TTX (1 μM) and picrotoxin (100 μM). TTX is a Na+ channel blocker that inhibits the elicitation of action potentials. Picrotoxin is a noncompetitive antagonist of GABAA receptors thus inhibits GABAergic currents in recordings.\nRecording pipettes were prepared by pulling glass pipettes (Borosilicate glass, Sutter Instrument) on a pipette puller (Sutter Instrument P-1000).\nNote: Electrophysiological recording is performed at room temperature (22°C–25°C).\nSearch and locate the target neurons to be recorded under the microscope.\nFill the glass recording pipette with intracellular solution.\nImmerse the tip of the recording pipette in the ECF in the recording chamber, read the tip resistance. Only use pipettes with a tip resistance of around 4–5 MΩ.\nNote: Replace ECF in the recording chamber after each recording.\nApply slight positive pressure to the pipette through tubing and guide the tip of the pipette to approach the target neuron.",
    "By using the micromanipulator, slowly press the pipette tip onto the cell body until an obvious dimple is formed (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Microscope view of whole-cell patch process, and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Release positive pressure and apply a subtle negative pressure to form the seal. In pClamp software, switch from Bath to Patch, and apply −65 mV voltage to facilitate the formation of Giga-ohm seal (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Clampex interface view showing whole-cell patch process). Once formed, apply a slight suction to rupture the cell membrane patch, thus forming whole-cell patch configuration.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1371-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Only recordings with a pipette-membrane seal greater than one giga-ohm and a drift of series resistance less than 15% are included for statistical analysis.\nAnalyze mEPSCs using MiniAnalysis Program (Synaptosoft).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "On DIV14-15, add PBS as vehicle and recombinant NGPF2 protein (Zhou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) to culture medium at the final concentration of 1.5 ng/mL.\nOn DIV15-16, at 24–36 h post NGPF2 treatment, remove culture medium, quickly wash coverslips with pre-cold PBS and fix cortical neurons with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS for 30 min at 4°C.\nRemove paraformaldehyde, wash coverslips in PBS for 5 min on a platform shaker (60 rpm).\nRepeat washing 3 times. Fixed coverslips from this step can be used for immunostaining of surface AMPA receptors (step 16), synaptic AMPA receptors (step 23), and dendrites (step 32).\nImmunostaining of surface AMPA receptors\nTiming: 1 day\nGluA2 is an essential subunit of AMPA receptors. To immunostaining AMPA receptors, use GluA2 as target protein.\nBlock the fixed cells from step 15 with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash with PBS for 5 min, 3 times.\nIncubate the coverslips with an antibody against the extracellular N-terminal domain of GluA2 (GluA2-NTD) (Millipore, Cat#MAB397) at 1:500 dilution in PBS for 12–16 h at 4°C, on a platform shaker (20 rpm).\nRemove primary antibody solution, and wash the cells with PBS for 5 min, 3 times.\nAdd a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG) at 1:1000 dilution in PBS, incubate at room temperature for 1 h, on a platform shaker (20 rpm).\nRemove secondary antibody solution, wash with PBS for 5 min, 5 times.\nPipette 8 μL ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher) on the surface of a glass slide, and mount coverslips on slides with neurons facing down.\nImmunostaining of synaptic AMPA receptors\nTiming: 1 day",
