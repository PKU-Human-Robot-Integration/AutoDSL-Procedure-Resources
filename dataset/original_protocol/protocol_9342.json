    "1. This Protocol is Based on Those of Southwell et. al. (2009) and Carter et. al. (2001).\nThe beam apparatus consists of 1 meter beams with a flat surface of 12 mm or 6 mm width) resting 50 cm above the table top on two poles.  A black box is placed at the end of the beam as the finish point.  (Plywood and other types of wood for the beams, poles, and box can be found at most hardware stores).  Nesting material from home cages is placed in the black box to attract the mouse to the finish point.  A lamp (with 60 watt light bulb) is used to shine light above the start point and serves as an aversive stimulus. The time to cross the center 80 cm is measured by two motion detectors (fabricated by Visopia): one at 0 cm that starts a timer and one at 80 cm that stops the timer.  A nylon hammock (which can be obtained from a local fabric store) is stretched below the beam, ~7.5 cm above the table top, to cushion any falls.  A video camera is set on a tripod to record the performance.  The apparatus used in this demonstration was built on site.\nA cohort of at least 10 mice for each condition is recommended for this test. Mice are housed as groups, when possible, in a 12 hour light (7am-7pm)/dark cycle and acclimated to their cages in the behavioral facility for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of the test.  Approximately 10 min prior to training/testing, the mice can be transported to the room containing the beam apparatus.",
    "On training days, each mouse crosses the 12 mm beam 3 times and then the 6 mm beam 3 times. Beams of wider widths (i.e. 28 mm) can be used for mice that are not able to cross the narrower ones or for larger mice. Mice are placed at one end of a beam and the time required to cross to the escape box at the other end (80 cm away) is measured by the motion detectors.  The timer is started by the nose of the mouse entering the center 80 cm, and stopped when the animal reaches the end of the 80 cm. The mice rest for 10 min in their home cages between training sessions on the two beams. During this intertrial period, another 3-4 mice can be trained to make efficient use of time.  C57BL/6 mice typically cross the beam with a minimal amount of stopping or stalling. However, when they do stall, sniff or look around without proceeding forward, the investigator should encourage the mouse to continue moving forward by prodding, poking, or pushing it from behind with gloved fingers.  Once the mice are in the safe box, they are allowed some time (~15 secs) to rest there before the next trial. After each training session, the mice are returned directly to their home cages and taken back into their housing room.  Of note, the mice may stall more if they are over-trained and become too familiar with the task and apparatus.  On the other hand, training can be continued for additional days if the mice still do not traverse the entire beam successfully after 2 days of training.  If treatments are applied to the mice, a baseline measure of performance should be obtained prior to treatment.",
    "On the test day, times to cross each beam are recorded.  Two successful trials in which the mouse did not stall on the beam are averaged. Video recordings can be used for finer analysis of slipping and other observable motor deficits.  An alternative way to assess beam walking is by a neurological scoring system1,2, which rates the inability to cross the beam as a score of \"1\" and the ability to traverse the beam normally with both paws on the beam surface and fewer than two foot slips as a \"7.\"  A slip is defined as the foot coming off the top of the beam. In this indexing system, a score of \"3\" would correspond to crossing the beam by dragging limbs.  An animal that scores 1 on two trials is not retested. Description of performance on the beam related to other scores can be found in Feeney et al., (1982) and Carter et al., (2001).\nThe beams and box are cleaned of mouse droppings and wiped with towels soaked with 70% ethanol and then water before the next beam is placed on the apparatus. \n2. Representative Results:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2376/2376fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Typical cross times of male and female C57Bl6 on 6mm and 12mm beams. A cohort of 9 to 11 week old C57BL/6-NCRL WT mice were tested on both beams after 2 days of training. Average times for crossing the 12 mm beam were 4.6 ± 0.4 sec for males (n=14) and 3.3 ± 0.3 sec for females (n=11). Times on the 6 mm beam were 6.8 ± 0.7 sec for males (n=13) and 5.9 ± 0.5 sec for females (n=10) (errors are reported as S.E.M.).Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
