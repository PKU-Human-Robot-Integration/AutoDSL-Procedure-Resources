    "All performed animal experiments have been approved by the Nanjing Medical University committee. Male C57BL/6 mice were kept under controlled photoperiod conditions and were supplied with food and water.\n1. Preparations\nMicroinjection capillaries\nUse microinjection capillaries with an outer diameter, inner dimeter, and length of 1.0 mm, 0.8 mm, and 10.0 cm, respectively.\nPull glass capillaries with a capillary puller (Figure 1A). Test and adjust the settings depending on the capillary puller machine that is being used.\nBreak the pipette tips with forceps to use to obtain capillaries of a 50-µm diameter at the tip.\n\t\tNote: The tips may be too long to penetrate the testis.\nSharpen the tip in a 30° angle by using a micropipette beveler (Figure 1C).\nReagents\nPrepare 1% pentobarbital sodium: dissolve pentobarbital sodium 100 mg in 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (step 2.3.3).\nPrepare 10 mg/mL inulin-FITC: dissolve inulin-FITC 1 mg in 100 μL of PBS (step 2.1.6).\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde: dissolve paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4 g in 100 mL of PBS (step 2.3.3).\nPrepare 30% sucrose: dissolve sucrose 3 g in 10 mL of PBS (step 2.3.4).\nPrepare 0.1% cadmium chloride: dissolve cadmium chloride 10 mg in 10 mL of PBS (step 2.1.1).\n2. Methods\nAnesthesia and presurgery preparation\nWeigh 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice and calculate the required dose of CdCl2. Treat a group of mice (n = 3) with CdCl2 (5 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) for 3 d before surgery. Treat another group of 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 3) with PBS as control.\nPerform surgery under aseptic conditions by using sterile syringe, needle, scissors, and forceps.",
    "Prepare anesthesia working solution freshly. The required dose of anesthesia is 70 mg of pentobarbital sodium/kg of body weight. On average, an adult C57BL/6 mouse at 8 weeks of age weighs ~25 g, which corresponds to 175 μL of 1% pentobarbital sodium (1.75 mg per mouse).\n\t\tNOTE: The pentobarbital sodium is dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The solution is filtered by 0.22 um filter unit before being used.\nClean the area for surgery with 75% ethanol and cover the area with a clean tissue towel.\nTurn on the thermostatic heater and adjust the temperature to 37 °C.\nPrepare inulin-FITC working solution (10 mg/mL) on the day of the surgery.\nSurgical procedure\nWeigh 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice and calculate the required dose of anesthesia.\nPerform an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium using the 1-mL sterile syringe. Keep the mouse in a clean cage.\nObserve the eye reflex response and breathing pattern of the mouse to confirm that it is under complete anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: Usually, 10 - 15 min are needed until the mouse is deeply anesthetized, with a total lack of toe pinch response and maintenance of slow, steady breathing.\nMove the mouse to the operation area and cover its eye area with a moist tissue paper to avoid dryness during anesthesia (Figure 2A).\nShave its abdominal hair with a shaver and disinfect the surgery area with 75% ethanol.\nWith sharp scissors, make a 1-cm skin incision above the preputial glands to expose the abdominal wall. Lift the abdominal wall with small forceps and make a 0.5-cm incision to expose the peritoneal cavity (Figure 2B).",
    "Use forceps to search for fat pads around the epididymis and testis. Carefully pull the fat pads out to expose the attached testis clearly (Figure 2C and 2D). Usually, operate on one testis at a time.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid touching the fat pads and testis with hands.\nPlace a paper (9 cm in diameter) underneath the fat pads and testis (Figure 2C).\nInject inulin-FITC into a microinjection pipette and connect it to the micromanipulator unit (Figure 1D). Gently insert the microinjection pipette under the tunica albuginea and load a total of 20 μL of inulin-FITC into the interstitium of the testis (Figure 2E and 2F).\n\t\tNOTE: Carefully depress the microinjection pipette to avoid moving it.\nMonitor the movement of inulin-FITC in the testis (Figure 2G).\nImmediately put the testis back into the abdominal cavity after the completion of the injection.\nRepeat the procedure on the contralateral testis. This testis is injected with 20 μL of PBS as a control.\nClose the skin with a surgical suture and move the mouse to a heat pad of a thermostatic heater (Figure 1B). Administer a dose of 1 mg of analgesic (buprenorphine) per 1 kg of body weight via subcutaneous injection.\nHarvesting the testes and frozen sections preparation\n40 min after the injection, euthanize the recipient mouse by cervical dislocation according to animal care and use guidelines.\nUse a pair of sharp scissors to collect the testes. Place the testes into 1 mL of ice-cold PBS to remove any blood contamination.\nFix the testes in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 °C for 12 - 24 h. Discard the 4% PFA and wash the tissue 3x with 1.5 mL of 1% PBS at room temperature.",
    "Dehydrate the tissue in 30% sucrose overnight. Put the testis in the embedding frame and cover the tissue with optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT). After the OCT is frozen, fill the embedding frame with OCT so that the whole testis can be covered with OCT.\nCut 5-μm-thick, frozen cross sections of the testes in a cryostat at -20 °C and let them adhere to microscope slides.\n\t\tNOTE: Refreezing embedded tissues in dry ice may increase the rigidity for cutting.\nImage requisition\nPlace the slides in a humidified box. Warm the slides at room temperature for 10 min.\nWash the sections 3x with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at room temperature.\nAir-dry for 5 min in the dark. Wipe off any residual TBS with dust-free paper.\nCover the cross sections with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Place the inverted coverslip on a microscope slide.\nAcquire images using a confocal microscope. A total of 20X magnification is generally sufficient for detecting the brightly fluorescent signal.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
