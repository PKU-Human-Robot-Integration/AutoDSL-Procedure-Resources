    "1. Culturing Cells on Micropost Arrays\nNote: All steps must be performed in a biosafety cabinet to ensure sterility. The volumes given here are for T25 cell culture flasks. The cell culture medium recipe and cell seeding density are optimized for bone cancer cell lines HuO9 and M132.\nPrepare a cell culture for seeding onto a micropost array.\n\t\nInspect the cell culture quality by placing the culture flask on a standard light microscope. Ensure that the cells show a typical growth and morphology by estimating how much of the culture flask bottom is covered. A coverage of 70%-80% reflects a healthy growth rate. Pay attention to the amount of floating cells as they represent dead cells and/or an overgrown culture.\nTrypsinize cells by removing medium and washing with 4 ml 1x Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer. Add 0.8 ml 1x Trypsin/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and incubate at RT until the cells dislodge, which takes about 2-4 min. Check the process with the microscope and occasionally tap the flask gently to support the dislodging.\nAdd 5 ml cell culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptavidin (Pen/Strep)) to stop the reaction and to wash off residual cells that still sit on the flask’s bottom. Subsequently pipette this suspension up and down several times to gain a homogenous mixture. Make sure to pipette all solutions across the original growth area of the flask to gain an effective dislodging.\nTransfer the cell suspension in to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge it using a table top centrifuge at 0.5 x g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 5 ml medium by pipetting up and down 5 times. Make sure to avoid the generation of bubbles while doing so.",
    "Determine cell density by using a cell counting chamber and a light microscope. Check the cell suspension in cell counting chamber for cell aggregates and ensure to have only single cells for the subsequent experiment. Pipette again up and down several times if the cells tend to form aggregates to separate them.\nDilute the cell suspension with sufficient medium to gain a cell solution of 25,000 cells/ml. Mix it well by inverting the closed tube several times. \nPrepare a micropost array for cell seeding.\n\tCritical Note: Do not pipette onto the micropost array directly as this could potentially harm the microposts, especially when unwanted bubbles are introduced. Furthermore, make sure that the micropost array never dries out as occurring capillary forces lead to collapsing of the microposts.\n\t\nPlace the glass substrate with the micropost array face up in a well of a 12-well plate by using a pair of tweezers and wet it by adding 1 ml ethanol (99%). Incubate at RT for 20-30 sec.\nDilute the ethanol stepwise by adding approximately 1 ml sterile de-ionized water (DI water) on the well side and aspirating roughly 1 ml using a transfer pipette or aspiration device. Repeat this step at least 3 times.\nReplace the DI-water with PBS-buffer in the same manner by adding and aspirating approximately 1 ml. Repeat this step 3 times.\nReplace the PBS-buffer with medium by adding and aspirating approximately 1 ml of medium. Repeat this step 3 times.\nPipette 1 ml cell solution (25,000 cells) on top of each prepared micropost array. Close multi-well plate and transfer it to an incubator (CO2 5%, 37 °C). Let the cells adhere and grow on top of microposts for 6 -7 hr.",
    "Inspect the adhesion process occasionally by using a light a microscope. Check that most of the cells appear spread out across multiple microposts.\n2. Fixing & Staining Cells\nNote: All steps and volumes given here are for a single well of a 12-well plate. It is recommended to process not more than four of the twelve wells at a time to avoid a drying out of the wells after aspiration of any liquid, which will result in a collapse of the microposts.\nAspirate medium from the well and wash cells 2x with 1 ml PBS-buffer. Make sure to apply a gentle force while washing with PBS to remove cell debris that accumulated on the micropost array during incubation and to detach dead cells.\nFix the cells with 0.5 ml 3.7% buffered formaldehyde solution for 5 min.\nReplace the formaldehyde solution by washing the micropost array 2x with 1 ml sterile DI water.\nStain the cells with dye (0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% water, 40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid) for about 90 sec. Wash excess staining solution off 2x with 1 ml sterile DI water. Add 1 ml DI water to micropost array.\nCheck staining result using a light microscope. Repeat the staining step, if cell body is too faint to be visualized.\nStore micropost arrays with the stained cells on top in a refrigerator at 4 °C. Ensure to keep them under water at all times.\n3. Cell Imaging\nNote: Step 4 only applies to microscopes without infinity corrected optics.\nAdd 2 ml DI-water to a Petri dish with a thin glass bottom for high resolution imaging.\nTransfer micropost array using a pair of tweezers into the imaging dish with the microposts facing up.\nPlace the imaging Petri dish on a moveable stage of a light microscope.",
    "Turn the compensation ring of the lens used for imaging until the number on the scale represents the total thickness of all materials along the optical path to compensate for the mismatch in refractive indices of the glass substrate, the silicone elastomer and the liquid on top. This should lead to a bright appearance of the microposts cores.\nClose the iris on the illumination side down to 50% and remove any phase contrast rings from the optical path enabling an ordinary bright-field mode.\nAlign the micropost array that the microposts form a horizontal line across the observation field. Define a start point (e.g., top left) and move the Petri dish stepwise across the stage scanning the micropost array while taking numerous images.\nTake all images with the highest resolution setting for the camera using a 20X or 40X objective. Aim to have a single cell in the center of the image.\nSweep along the z-axis through the substrate until the micropost tips are in focus. Use the fine tuning focus wheel of the microscope and turn it towards focusing on the micropost bottom for about 2-3 µm.\nEstablish a standard imaging procedure by taking series of test images of one array section sweeping through the imaging parameters one at a time (e.g., exposure time, iris setting, lamp settings etc.). Analyze images with MechProfiler and determine a suitable parameter set for a fast and reliable analysis.\n4. Image Analysis with Open Source Software “MechProfiler”\nNote: All software functions can be activated with a pointing device using the left mouse button. However, a trained operator will use the documented shortcut keys designed to be on the left half of the keyboard to enable an efficient two-handed image processing.",
    "Start image analysis software MechProfiler and open a range of images that need to be analyzed by clicking “Open”.\nInsert all parameters into the “Settings” section given by the software developer. Determine the parameters that must be custom configured (i.e., contour threshold and minimal distance) according to the procedures described in detail by the software manual.\nAnalyze images one-by-one by cropping them to the area of interest by using “Crop” (click and drag with the mouse button pressed down). Double click inside the drawn rectangle to finish this action.\nMarking each visible cell outline one-by-one by clicking on “Draw cell outlines” and use the cross hair cursor for drawing including all microposts the cell is attached to.\nDiscard any unwanted microposts by clicking “Discard Posts” and use the cross hair cursor for drawing. Enclose all microposts that belong to a cell outside of the image section or that are deflected for any other reason but not by the cell of interest.\nStart the software subroutine “Find Centroids” by mouse click. Adjust the filter setting right next to the “Find Centroids” button until all microposts are registered, which is visible by a red cross in their center. If the filter setting is too low microposts will be ignored, if it is too high multiple positions will be marked for a single micropost. Keep the filter setting constant during an analysis session.\nUse the manual editing function “Manual Edit” for centroids with multiple or missed micropost positions. Use the mouse cross hair to select the micropost in question by clicking and dragging it across. Double click inside the rectangle and place the missing red marker in the enlarged image section, which automatically closes. Discard such a micropost if it is outside the drawn cell outline (see step 4.5) before proceeding.",
    "Find the ideal micropost grid by activating the “Generate Grid” function with a mouse click. Ensure the position corresponds with the true micropost head, shown by a blue ring, inside the drawn cell outline.\nCorrect any misplaced grid maker inside the cell area where needed using the corresponding “Manuel Edit” function with a mouse click. Use the cross hair to select the micropost in question by clicking and dragging it across. Double click inside the appearing rectangle and place the missing blue marker in the enlarged image section, which automatically closes.\nUse the button “Calculate Deflections” by mouse click to get a histogram of the calculated deflection values based on the difference between a micropost’s position inside the image section and the generated ideal grid.\nSave the complete analysis including the tables of values by a mouse click on “Save”.\nContinue the image analysis either by clicking on “Reset View” and analyze another image section or mouse click on “Next Image”, which conveniently can be done using the right keyboard curser key.\n5. Data Analysis — Mechanoprofiling\nOpen the file “results.xls” with an office spreadsheet program from the folder with the analyzed images. It contains the data with all calculated values including all micropost deflections and standard derivative measures such as work (i.e., substrate deformation energy) by the analyzed cell.\nSubscription Required.
