    "Preparation of B. subtilis strains cultureUsing sterile procedures, add 2 ml of sterile MSgg or NGM broth (see Recipes) in a sterile 150 x 20 mm-tube. Inoculate medium with 20 µl of a B. subtilis strains frozen culture (JH642 or NCIB3610) (see Note 3). For NGM broth’s preparation, mix 3 g NaCl and 2.5 g Bacto peptone in an Erlenmeyer flask. Add to 1 L of dH2O. Autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min. Cool flask in 55 °C water bath for 15 min. Add 1 ml 1 M CaCl2, 1 ml 5 mg/ml cholesterol in ethanol, 1 ml 1 M MgSO4 and 25 ml 1 M KPO4 buffer. Swirl to mix well. Incubate for 16-18 h at 37 °C with shaking (overnight culture).Preparation of B. subtilis strains culture supporting biofilm formationUsing sterile procedures, add 2 ml of sterile MSgg or NGM broth in a sterile 150 x 16 mm-tube. Inoculate medium with 20 µl of a B. subtilis strain overnight culture. Incubate at 25 °C for 36 h with (planktonic condition) or without shaking (biofilm-supporting condition) (see Note 4).Preparation of B. subtilis strains samples for NO determination (according to the kit’s instructions)Take the tubes and disrupt the biofilm by vortexing until a homogenous suspension is obtained. Take a 100 µl aliquot for CFU (colony-forming units) counting (see Note 1).Centrifuge at 12,470 x g for 20 min. Transfer the supernatant to a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and discard pellet.Ultrafilter using a 10 or 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off filter using a commercially available centrifuge. The filters should be pre-rinsed with ultrapure water prior ultrafiltration.Wait for 3 h, the time required for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite.Preparation of a standard curve (according to the kit’s instructions)Standard curve for nitrate and nitrite must be included.",
    "If you plan to measure only total NO products (nitrate + nitrite), only the nitrate standard curve is required.In a clean tube, place 0.9 ml of ‘Nitrate Assay Buffer’ from the kit. To this, add 0.1 ml of reconstituted ‘Nitrate Standard’ and vortex for 20 sec. The concentration of this stock standard is 200 µM.Use this standard for the preparation of the nitrate standard curve as described below. The standard curve for nitrate is prepared by addition of reagents to the plate wells in the following way (Figure 1):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170629/20170629011052_4561.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of nitrate standard curve according to the kit’s instructionsPerforming the assay (according to the kit’s instructions)Add 200 µl of water or ‘Nitrate Assay Buffer’ to the blank wells. Do not add any other reagents to these wells.Add up to 80 µl of sample to the wells in a pattern you choose. The final volume must be adjusted to 80 µl using the ‘Nitrate Assay Buffer’ solution.Add 10 µl of the ‘Enzyme Cofactor Mixture’ to each of the wells (standards and unknown) (see Note 6).Add 10 µl of the ‘Nitrate Reductase Mixture’ to each of the wells (standards and unknown).Cover the plate with the plate cover and incubate at room temperature for 2 h. It is not necessary to shake the plate during incubation.After incubation time, add 50 µl of the ‘Griess Reagent R1’ to each of the wells (standards and unknown) (see Note 7). Pipette up and down 2-3 times.After incubation time, add 50 µl of the ‘Griess Reagent R2’ to each of the wells (standards and unknown) (see Note 7). Pipette up and down 2-3 times.Allow the color to develop for 10 min at room temperature. It is not necessary to cover the plate.Read the absorbance at 540 nm using a plate reader.",
    "CalculationsSubtract the absorbance value of the blank wells from the absorbance values of all the other wells. Make a plot of the absorbance at 540 nm as a function of nitrate concentration. The nitrate standard curve is used for determination of total nitrate + nitrite concentration. An example is shown in Figure 2.Calculate NO concentration as follows: (Nitrate + Nitrite) (µM) = ([A540 - y - intercept)/slope] x (200 µl/volume of sample used (µl)) x dilutionAccording to the CFU obtained in step C1, normalize NO (µM) to 1 x 108 CFU.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170629/20170629011325_8287.jpgFigure 2. A typical standard curve (according to the kit’s instructions)Determination of β-galactosidase activity (Arabolaza et al., 2003) (see Note 5)The bacterial strain used in this study is a derivative of B. subtilis NCIB31610 containing Pcsf-lacZ fusion integrated into the bacterial chromosome at the non-essential amyE locus. Introduce 2 ml of MSgg or NGM broth aseptically into previously autoclaved 150 x 16 mm-culture tube and 2 µl of 5 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Each tube is inoculated with 20 µl of an overnight culture; uninoculated tubes containing only MSgg or NGM broth serve as controls for cross-contamination. The cultures are placed on a rotating shaker at 130 rpm (planktonic conditions) or without shaking (biofilm-supporting conditions) and incubated at 37 °C. The tubes are incubated for at least 36 h. To determine the culture density, take the tubes and disrupt the biofilm by vortexing until a homogenous suspension is obtained. Take a 100 µl aliquot for CFU counting (see Note 1). The A525 of the diluted culture (1/10 dilution) is determined using a Molecular Dynamics Model SpectraMAX 340PC microplate reader. As discussed below, dilution of the culture is required because cell density is not proportional to A525 when the values are above 0.8-1.",
    "Two aliquots of 1 ml from the disrupted culture are arrested by the addition of 2 µl of 5 mg/ml chloramphenicol (see Recipes) using a repeater pipettor and the tubes are placed on ice. Then, centrifuge the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, for 5 min at 4 °C at 12,470 x g. Supernatants are removed and pellets are either frozen at -20 °C or assayed immediately (see Note 2) (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170629/20170629011557_5940.jpgFigure 3. Flowchart image showing the basic steps of culturing bacteria in planktonic or biofilm-supporting conditions and samples collectionFor cell permeabilization, 0.73 ml of Z buffer (see Recipes) is dispensed into the pellet. A reagent blank containing 0.73 ml of Z buffer is run with the unknowns.Add 10 µl of 10 mg/ml fresh lysozyme solution (see Recipes) to the tubes and incubate for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath. Transfer the tubes to bench and add 10 µl of 10% Triton X-100 (see Recipes). Permeabilization is accomplished by aspirating and dispensing the mixtures 10 times.Immediately after permeabilization, at zero time, the assay is initiated by adding 100 µl of 4.5 mg/ml ONPG (see Recipes) to each tube. In the end of the assay, the tubes are incubated at 28 °C for the appropriate length of time, e.g., 15 min, before the reaction is terminated by the addition of 150 µl of 1.2 M Na2CO3 to each tube (see Recipes). Then, the tubes’ content is transferred to a microplate, which is introduced into the plate reader and the A420 values are determined. Calculation of β-galactosidase activity expressed as Miller units (M.U.) is performed as follows:M.U. = (OD420 x 66.7)/(OD525 x ml used)where,OD420 is the optical density of β-gal assay, OD525 is the optical density of the bacterial culture,66.",
    "7 is a correction factor,ml used is the volume of Z buffer used to resuspend the bacterial pellet (in this case 0.73 ml).According to the UFC obtained in step C1, normalize β-gal (M.U.) to 1 x 108 UFC."
