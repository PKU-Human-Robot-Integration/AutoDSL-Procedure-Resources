  "procedures": [
    "This protocol describes the induction of an experimental liver metastasis model through mesenteric vein injection. Before starting these mouse experiments, ethical approval of the local animal ethics committee should be obtained.\nEight-week-old mice are preferred over older mice for this injection due to the smaller size of the mesenteric vein and decreased occurrence of bleeding. However, when an abdominal imaging window is to be implanted (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-prot-0003]) after the mesenteric vein injection, 10-week-old mice are favored due to their larger size of the liver and higher weight; in addition, female mice are preferred because they are less aggressive, reducing the changes of damage to the window. The cells used in this example were B16F10 (ATCC®CRL-6475™) transduced with a lentiviral plasmid containing a fluorophore attached to H2B.\nMaterials\nMurine cancer cells (e.g., B16F10 cells) transduced with lentiviral plasmid expressing a nuclear or cytoplasmic fluorophore, mycoplasma free\n10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/50% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/40% Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM)\nCulture medium: DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 IU/ml penicillin-streptomycin (cat no. 15140122, Thermo Fisher Scientific)\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; sterile)\nTrypsin/EDTA: 5% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; cat no. 15400054, Thermo Fisher Scientific)\n0.03 mg/ml buprenorphine\n70% ethanol (EtOH) for sterilization\n8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice\n100% (v/v) isoflurane\nOphthalmic ointment (Oculentum Simplex 5 g, sterile; cat. no. 220201, Added Pharma)\n37°C water bath\n15-ml Falcon tubes (sterile)\n100/20-mm culture dishes (sterile; cat. no. 664160, Greiner Bio-one)\nCell culture hood\nCO2 incubator\nBenchtop centrifuge (Hettich® ROTINA 38)\nDual-chamber cell counting slides (Bio-Rad)\nTC20™ Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (sterile)\nPipetboy Acu 2 (cat. no. 15500, Integra) or equivalent\n1000- and 10-μl pipets (cat. nos. 17014382 and 17014388, Mettler Toledo)\n1000-μl pipet tips, sterile\n1-20 μl pipet tips, sterile\nSurgical tools:",

Thaw a cryovial containing 1-2 × 106 B16F10 cells (previously transduced with a lentiviral plasmid expressing a nuclear or cytoplasmic fluorophore) in 1 ml 10% DMSO/50% FBS/40% DMEM in a 37°C water bath. Quickly transfer cells to a 15-ml Falcon tube containing culture medium and centrifuge 3 min at 300 × g. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml culture medium and transfer to a 100/20 mm culture dish.\nSelection for transduced, fluorescent cells can be done either through antibiotic selection or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\nCells should be tested to ensure that they are mycoplasma free.\nWe recommended expanding the cell line and generating a large stock of cryovials containing frozen cells that are still highly similar to the original cells. To ensure minimal heterogeneity between experiments, a cryovial from the large stock should be thawed before the experiment and should not be kept in culture for >1-2 months.",
    "2. Culture cells under standard growth conditions for the cell line, checking cell growth and morphology at least every 2-3 days.\n3. When cells reach ∼80% confluency (typically after 2-3 days), wash them with 5 ml PBS and add 1-2 ml warmed trypsin/EDTA to detach the cells. After ∼3-4 min, inactivate the trypsin by adding 5 ml warmed culture medium. Split the cells in a ∼1:15 ratio for 1-2 weeks before the mouse injection. Incubate cells in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nBefore harvesting cancer cells for injection, make sure the confluency is 70-80%.\n4. To harvest the tumor cells, wash with 5 ml PBS and add 1-2 ml warmed trypsin/EDTA to detach the cells. After ∼3-4 min, inactivate the trypsin by adding 5 ml warmed culture medium. Collect the ∼6 ml of culture medium containing cells in a 15-ml Falcon tube and centrifuge 3 min at 300 × g, room temperature. Wash the cell pellet twice by resuspending the pellet in 5 ml PBS and centrifuging, and then repeating.\nInjection of FBS remnants can result in an immune reaction; thus, it is important to properly wash the cells with PBS at least twice.\n5. After resuspending the cell pellet in 5 ml PBS the second time, transfer 10 μl cell suspension to a dual-chamber cell counting slide. Count the cells using the automated cell counter; to ensure correct measurement, count the cells twice and take the average. Calculate the number of cells present in the 5-ml cell suspension.",
    "6. Centrifuge the cell suspension 3 min at 300 × g, room temperature. Resuspend the cell pellet in the appropriate volume of PBS: For injection of 5 × 105 cells, the concentration of cells should be 5 × 106 cells/ml, of which 100 μl is used for injection. Therefore, resuspend the cell pellet in the appropriate amount of PBS to create the 5 × 106 cells/ml concentration. Transfer the cells to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and place it on ice.\nCount the sample at least twice and take an average to get a more accurate measurement.\nFor one mouse injection, 5 × 105 cells are needed; however, it is advisable to prepare three times the amount necessary (300 μl PBS containing 1.5 × 106 cells) to account for spillage and dead volume in the syringe and needle.\n7. Keep cells on ice until ready to inject them into mice. Inject as soon as possible, but at most 45-60 min after harvesting, to prevent cell death.\nPreparation for surgery\n8. Sterilize the surgical tools, surgical drape, gauze, and cotton swabs.\n9. Using a 1-ml syringe with a 25-G needle, inject 100 μl of 0.03 mg/ml buprenorphine into the mouse subcutaneously (s.c.) for pain management 30 min before surgery.\n10. Prepare the area of surgery by sterilizing surfaces with 70% EtOH.\n11. Place a heat pad on the surgery bench and turn it on (it should be ∼37°C). Place anesthesia tube on the middle of the heating pad, and place a paper towel on top of heat pad to protect the mouse from overheating during the preparatory stages.",
    "12. Place the adjustable brightfield microscope in such a way that you can shift the microscope over the field of view of surgery prior to the injection (see Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0001]). Clean the surfaces with 70% EtOH.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2fc5ccc0-ac4d-4c6a-be25-bfd83305dcbf/cpz1116-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSetup of mesenteric vein injection surgery. (A) The global setup for the mesenteric vein injection surgery includes an anesthesia induction box (I), an adjustable stereomicroscope that can be placed above the surgical field (II), an anesthesia induction tube (III), and a (sterile) surgical drape containing necessary items for surgery (d). (B) The surgery is performed on a heating pad. On the sterile surgical drape (I) are placed sterile surgical tools, including curved and serrated extra-fine Graefe forceps (II), extra-fine curved Graefe forceps with 1 × 2 teeth (III), fine scissors (IV), extra-fine Bonn scissors (V), a Halsey needle holder (VI), sterile cotton swabs (VII) and gauze (VIII), 5-0 suture (IX), and syringes and needles (X) for injection and PBS. The mouse is placed in the middle, and the anesthesia inhalation tube is secured in position using tape.\n13. Weigh the mouse as a reference point for recovery after surgery.\n14. Induce anesthesia of the mouse with 4% (v/v) isoflurane until the mouse does not respond with reflexes.\n15. Transfer the mouse to the anesthesia tube placed on the heating pad. Continue anesthesia during surgery using 1%-1.5% (v/v) isoflurane, while monitoring the breathing patterns and reflexes of the mouse closely.\n16. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mouse to prevent them from becoming dehydrated.\nEyes that become too dehydrated become permanently damaged, resulting in permanent blindness.\nMesenteric vein injection\n17. Turn the mouse into supine position and carefully tape its front paws to the anesthetics tube (see Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0001]).",
    "The paws are easily broken, so take care not to bend them too far.\n18. Using the animal razor, shave the abdomen and sterilize it using 70% EtOH\nHairs give an autofluorescence signal and hamper imaging. Therefore, take care to keep the imaging area devoid of hairs.\nWet the paper towel next to the mouse so that the hairs that fall off after shaving stick to the paper, making it easier to keep the area hair-free.\n19. Place the sterile surgical drape under the mouse, and while maintaining sterility, place surgical tools, sutures, cotton swabs, gauze, 27-G needle, and 1-ml syringe on the surgical drape. Fill a 20-ml syringe with a 16-G needle with sterile PBS and place it on a surgical drape.\nFor an example of this setup, see Figure 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0001].\n20. Start the incision in the skin using the fine scissors on the midline (caudal to cranial) and make a 15-mm incision (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]). The incision should be placed in the middle of the animal's abdomen, 10-15 mm below the xiphoid. Using extra-fine Bonn scissors, continue the incision of the muscle wall. Use teethed extra-fine Graefe forceps to grab the muscle wall, make an incision, let go of the muscle wall, and grab it again more easily. In this way the pressure is released (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\nMake the incision on the midline of the abdomen to spare major vessels from injury and prevent damage to the muscular wall.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2ab91a85-455e-4537-ad73-637ac3fea8ea/cpz1116-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Mesenteric vein injection surgery. After shaving the abdomen of the mouse, make a vertical incision in the midline of the abdomen in the skin (A) and muscle wall after releasing the vacuum (B). Place the caecum (arrow) in front of the incision using moistened cotton swabs (C), and place a sterile moisturized gauze on top of the incision (D). After pulling out the caecum (arrow) using moistened cotton swabs, locate the large (two-dashed arrow) and small (multiple-dashed arrow) intestine (E). Spread the small intestine to visualize the mesentery and mesenteric vessels (F, arrow). Through the stereomicroscope, locate merging vessels (G, arrow) and place the suture underneath the bottom of the merged vessel (H). While looking through the microscope, insert the needle in the merging vessels and slowly release the PBS containing cells (I-L). Blood should be temporarily replaced by PBS (K, L, arrow). Stop the bleeding and place the small intestine back into the mouse abdomen. Close the abdomen using an uninterrupted running or continuous suture (M). Minimal weight loss is expected 1-2 days after surgery (N).\n21. Using a cotton swab moistened with PBS and serrated forceps, locate the caecum and pull caecum toward the incision using the moistened cotton swabs (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]; arrow points towards the exposed caecum).\n22. Using the fine scissors, cut a small gap the size of the incision in the gauze. Place the gauze on top of the mouse, matching the gap to the incision (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\nFold the gauze in two, and cut a half circle at the fold to create an even circle.\nMoisten the part of the gauze covering the abdomen for better positioning of the gauze and to cause less friction. Take care not to make the gauze too wet, as it can lower the temperature of the animal.",
    "23. Using two cotton swabs moistened with PBS, carefully pull the caecum out of the abdomen and place it on the gauze (Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\n24. Locate the small intestine and pull it slightly out of the abdomen.\nThe large intestine and small intestine are not always distinguishable by size. The small intestine can be identified because it enters the caecum at a 90-degree angle (Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002], multiple-dashed arrow). The large intestine is positioned in the length of the caecum (Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002], two-dashed arrow).\n25. Place the caecum back in the abdomen, leaving the small intestine out.\n26. Spread the small intestine and its mesentery on the moistened part of the gauze (Fig. 2F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\nKeep the small intestines moistened by applying PBS every other minute.\n27. Locate a merging of mesentery vessels into one vessel (indicated with an arrow in Fig. 2F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002] and H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\nAvoid overlaying vessels, as these can complicate the injection.\nKeep enough distance (>1 cm) from the small intestine for injection and position of the needle.\n28. Place the adjustable stereomicroscope over the exposed small intestine and mesenteric vein to help with the precision of the injection.\nSteps 28-33 are performed under the microscope to aid visualization of the vessel.\n29. Place the suture underneath the intersection of the two vessels for stability during the injection (Fig. 2G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002] and H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\n30. Clamp the ends of the stitch ∼5 cm below the stitch using the Halsey needle holder.\n31. Resuspend the cancer cells in PBS using a 1-ml pipet. Prepare the tumor cells in PBS in a 1-ml syringe and place a 27-G needle on the syringe. Adjust the volume in the needle to 100 μl.",
    "To prevent unnecessary passing of the tumor cells through the needle, which can result in cell death, draw up the tumor cell suspension with syringe only.\nAvoid the presence of air bubbles in the syringe.\nMake sure the needle is placed with its opening facing upward to facilitate injection.\n32. While holding tension on the stitch keeping the mesenteric vein in place, carefully insert the needle at the intersection of the two mesenteric veins into the extending vein until the needle opening is inside (Fig. 2I[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\n33. Slowly, over ∼10 s, inject 100 μl tumor cells in PBS in the mesenteric vein.\nFor a successful injection, the blood in the vein will be temporarily replaced with PBS and will appear white (Fig. 2I[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]-L[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\n34. Press the vein closed with a dry cotton swab and carefully retract the needle. Press vein closed for ∼2 min, or until bleeding has stopped.\nIf the bleeding has not stopped after repeated pressure, the wound can be closed by cauterization.\n35. Flush the mesentery around the injection site with sterile PBS to wash away potential remaining tumor cells. Tap the area dry with a piece of gauze and repeat this at least twice.\nWhen the tumor cells are mis-injected into the fat of the mesentery, or remain in the mesentery after spillage, a tumor can form there. This is visible through the microscope during injection by the appearance of a bulge around the vessel.\n36. Carefully place the small intestine and mesentery back in abdomen using PBS-wetted cotton tips.\n37a. When preparing for long-term, multiday intravital imaging: Continue to step 3 of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-prot-0003].",
    "37b. When preparing for short-term intravital imaging at a later timepoint: Close the muscle wall and skin using an uninterrupted running or continuous suture (Kudur, Pai, Sripathi, & Prabhu, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0023]; Fig. 2M[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]). Continue to step 38 below.\nPost-injection monitoring of mouse\n38. Place the mouse back in its cage, place half of the cage on the heating pad for a better recovery, and closely monitor the mouse's recovery and wellbeing after the surgery by checking mobility and appearance (Te Velde et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0042]).\nMice should recover and be mobile within 5-10 min after surgery.\nOnly place half of the cage on the heating pad to provide a choice of location in case the cage underneath the heating pad becomes too warm.\nWhen extensive blood loss has occurred during surgery, an extra injection of <200 μl PBS s.c. can be given to improve the recovery of the mouse.\nThe mouse can be caged with other mice that have undergone mesenteric vein injection, but not with mice that did not undergo surgery.\n39. The next day and every 2-3 days after, monitor the mouse after surgery by measuring it weight, behavior, appearance, and mobility as described by te Velde et al. (te Velde et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0042]).\nA weight loss of ∼10% can be expected a day after surgery. This should stabilize and be recovered within 2-5 days (Fig. 2N[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0002]).\nAn extra dose of buprenorphine can be given every 12 hr when the animal is still in pain (has a behavior, appearance, or mobility score ≥1 on the table described by te Velde et al).\nA score of 3 on the table described by te Velde et al. indicates that the wellbeing of the mouse is considerably affected, and the mouse will need to be euthanized.",
    "At a chosen timepoint after mesenteric vein injection, the liver can be used for intravital imaging at an endpoint imaging session. The mouse liver can be imaged once, either directly after mesenteric injection or days to weeks later, using an upright multiphoton stage. After the imaging session, the mouse should be euthanized and the liver can be harvested for further analysis, such as immunohistochemistry or protein or gene expression analysis. This protocol is suited to examining short-term behavior of tumor cells in the liver. Imaging can be done from <1 hr up to 8 hr.\nMaterials\nMice following mesenteric vein injection of tumor cells (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-prot-0001])\n100% (v/v) isoflurane\nSterile PBS\nUpright multiphoton microscopy system (in this protocol, we used a Zeiss LSM710 NLO upright multiphoton equipped with a Mai Tai DeepSee multiphoton laser (690-1040 nm) and W Plan-Apochromat 20×/1.0DIX M27/75 mm objective)\nBreathing monitor, optional\nDAKO pen (cat. no.

Move the animal onto the microscope platform with heating pad in supine position, and place with its head in an anesthesia tube (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0004]). Lower isoflurane anesthesia to ∼1% (v/v). Carefully monitor the breathing and pain reflexes to ensure proper anesthesia.\nThe use of a breathing monitor can be beneficial to ensure proper anesthesia induction throughout the experiment.\nIsoflurane lowers the breath rate; maintaining the mouse at a rate between 30 and 80 breaths per minute is advisable.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ea10d2b8-e666-41d0-9379-960b37ed1ed5/cpz1116-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

(II) Left lobe of liver is pressing against the AIW after placement (arrow). The purse string was placed while the glue was drying. (D) Mice containing the AIW can be imaged at different timepoints; the mouse can be placed on the custom microscopy insert with heating pad in supine position.\n5. Using the fine scissors, cut the skin and muscle wall using a 10- to 15-mm horizontal incision 5 mm below the right ribcage, starting at the midline.\n6. Using moistened cotton swabs, locate the liver lobes. For imaging, the left lobe is most preferred.\n7. Carefully pull and position the left lobe so that it is placed frontally (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0004]).\nMake sure the liver stays moistened by adding PBS.\n8. Place a piece of gauze under the liver lobe, and use tissue glue to carefully glue the edges of the lobe to the gauze (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0004]).\n9. Carefully exteriorize the liver lobe partially out of the abdomen to prevent movement of the lobe during imaging. Using tape, secure the gauze in place to prevent retraction during imaging (see Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0004]).",
    "If breathing is causing excessive movement of the liver lobe, the falciform ligament can be cleaved using the extra-fine Bonn scissors. This ligament connects the middle lobe to the diaphragm, and can be best cleaved with microdissection scissors while pushing the liver caudally using a PBS-wetted cotton tip, or by pulling the ribcage up using tweezers (Ritsma et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0037])\n10. Carefully press the titanium or plastic coverglass holder, including coverglass (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003] and B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003], I and II), on top of the liver. Circle the outline of the coverglass with the DAKO pen. After the DAKO pen mark dries, add a droplet of water to allow visualization through the microscope.\nGeneral intravital imaging setup\n11. To determine whether the liver lobe contains tumor cells suited for imaging, place the mouse under the objective and look through the eye pieces.\n         \nWe recommend using a ≥20× objective to be able to properly identify the tumor cells.\nBlood vasculature will appear dark, whereas the liver tissue will appear fluorescent due to autofluorescence (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0005]).\nThe fluorescent labeling of the tumor cells should be visible.\nHairs are autofluorescent and have a very bright, distinct pattern (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0005]). As light does not pass through the hair, imaging deeper results in a black streak in the imaging frame.\nFor this example, the Zeiss Zen software was used for imaging.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d0e384be-2e49-4d96-a2d2-c94e243074b4/cpz1116-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",
    "Expected results. (A) Looking through the ocular of the multiphoton microscope to locate tumor cells, blood vasculature will appear dark (i), while the liver tissue will appear fluorescent (ii). (B) During imaging, hair will show a distinct striped, strongly autofluorescent pattern (white arrow) and leave a dark streak in deeper z frames. (C) 0.25 × 106 B16F10 cells expressing H2B-mTurquoise were injected and imaged after 4 days through surgical exposure. mTurquoise was excited at 855 nm (green), resulting in an SHG generated by collagen-I fibers (pink) at 427 nm. A cluster of nuclei of the tumor cells is visible in a matrix of collagen-I fibers. (D) 0.25 × 106 B16F10 cells expressing H2B-mTurquoise were injected and imaged 4 days post injection using surgical exposure, every 10 min for 90 min. A maximum projection is shown for timepoints 0, 30, 60, and 90 min. A merge of the different timepoints, false-colored with different colors, shows non-moving cells in purple and moving cells with a rainbow trail. (E) D2.A1 cells expressing H2B-Dendra were imaged at 960 nm using the AIW at 1, 2, and 3 days post injection. A large overview tile scan was made at day 1 (red), day 2 (green), and day 3 (pink); a maximum projection of the recorded z stack is shown. The positions of the tumor cell clusters and SHG signal (not shown) were used to align the position in the different timepoints to visualize tumor cell migration and proliferation (merge). White spots indicate a merged signal of days 1, 2 ,and 3, while the individual colors are indicative of tumor cells that were in different locations at the different time points.",
    "12. The pinhole can be completely opened to collect as much light as possible, as optical sectioning is inherent to multiphoton microscopy and does not require a pinhole.\n13. To enhance speed of imaging and thereby minimize breathing artefacts, we recommend acquisition in 512 × 512 pixels (image size of 425.10 μm × 425.10 μm) and bidirectional scanning.\n14. As there are often large differences between signal intensities, especially when imaging z stacks, imaging in 12-bit format is preferred.\n15. Settings such as imaging speed and line averaging can be adjusted to achieve a favorable interval between images. Averaging based on line scan is preferentially used to improve image quality, as otherwise movement in between the averaging can result in unsharp objects. A line average of 2 is used in this protocol.\n16. Depending on the signal of the fluorophore and the excitation wavelength, laser power between 3% and 10% can be used. With some multiphoton lasers, the output intensity is not equal when comparing different wavelengths. In our case, above 900 nm the output drops, so a power between 10% and 15% can be used, whereas at <850 nm it is recommended that the laser power remain under 10% to avoid tissue damage.\n17. When unwanted movement is introduced during imaging, due to breathing of the animal or traction of the tissue, registration plug-ins such as “descriptor-based series registration (2d/3d + t)” in Fiji can be used to correct this movement in 4D stacks based on the signal of the tumor cells or the second-harmonic generation (SHG).\nShort-term intravital microscopy\n18. If hair is visible in the imaging frame, rinse the liver carefully with PBS.",
    "19. For short-term imaging, recording separate positions is sufficient. We recommend taking 3-5 field of views per imaging session, depending on the amount of visible tumor cells.\n20. We recommend total imaging times between 1 and 4 hr, but extending imaging times up to 8 hr is possible.\n21. For precise migration analysis, a frequency of 10-15 min between frames is ideal; however, this can be dependent on the migration speed of the cell line (Chen, Ritsma, & Vrisekoop, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0008]). To measure migration in 3D, use a z stack with a step size between 1 and 2 μm.\nRetraction of the liver tissue can occur due to drying; ensure that the liver tissue remains moist during the imaging session.\nImaging time can depend on the stability of the field of view and the health of the mouse during imaging.\n22. After imaging, the animal can be sacrificed using cervical dislocation or CO2 inhalation. Organs can be harvested for further analysis.",
    "This protocol is an improved adaptation of the abdominal imaging window (AIW) developed by Ritsma et al. (Ritsma et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0037]; 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0036]). In addition, the protocol presented here describes imaging using an upright multiphoton stage. This protocol adds to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-prot-0001] through the implantation of an AIW after the mesenteric vein injection to allow multiday intravital imaging.

Glue a coverglass on the outer side of the AIW insert (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003], IV, h) using cyanoacrylate glue. Carefully press the coverglass onto the window insert. Let the insert dry >12 hr.\nAvoid contact of cyanoacrylate glue with skin.\nDo not use too much glue, to prevent spillage of glue on top of the coverglass. Any excess glue on the coverglass can be removed using a cotton swab moistened with 100% acetone.\n2. Place the window insert (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003] and 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003], h) in the AIW (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003] and 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003], g) to finalize the AIW. To sterilize, leave the AIW containing the insert in 70% EtOH for >30 min prior to surgery. Allow the imaging window to dry before continuing with step 3.\nImplantation of abdominal imaging window\nPerform AIW implantation after tumor cell injection (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-prot-0001], steps 17-37a).\n3. Clamp 50 mm of the xiphoid using the Hartman hemostat. Leave the xiphoid clamped up to step 8.\n4. Lift the Hartman hemostat in cranioventral direction. With a moistened cotton swab, gently press the liver posterior to visualize the falciform ligament. Using extra-fine Bonn scissors, carefully dissect the falciform ligament, being careful not to puncture the diaphragm.\nComplete dissection of the falciform ligament will allow proper placement of the liver and reduce movement during imaging.",
    "5. Using fine scissors, cut a piece of sterile cotton gauze in 25 × 10 mm. Using the Dumont no. 5 forceps, roll up the 25 × 10-mm cotton gauze around it, and then slide it off. Moisten the roll with sterile PBS.\nIf needed, cut of the edges of the role to create a role of 10 mm in length.\nMake sure that the roll is rolled tightly.\n6. Using moistened cotton swabs and the ring forceps, move the right liver lobes anteriorly and laterally, exposing the left liver lobe. With serrated Graefe forceps, place the cotton roll behind the left liver lobe and the diaphragm to push the lobe caudally and upwards (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0004], Il; arrow points to the location of the cotton roll, shown in white in the drawing at left).\nProper placement of the cotton roll is crucial for successful window implantation.\n7. Briefly fit the window into the incision to ensure the incision is of the proper size. Remove and set aside. Manipulate the left liver lobe so that it is placed behind the incision. Apply glue to the interior ring surface of the AIW (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003], IV, g) using the back of a cotton swab or a tissue tip. Lift the incision on one side using extra-fine Graefe forceps, place the window on the liver in one movement, and gently apply pressure for a few minutes. Allow the glue to dry for ∼5 min.\nThe liver should be pressed against the coverglass (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0004], II; arrow points to the liver visibly pressed to the glass).\nMake sure that other intestinal organs are not in the field of view, to prevent gluing of intestines to the window.\n8. Remove the Hartman hemostat from the xiphoid. Dissect the clamped tissue using fine scissors.",
    "This is done to prevent inflammation of necrotic tissue.\n9. While the glue is drying, proceed with applying a purse-string suture around the incision (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0004]). To do this, start at the right caudal end of the incision. For the first stitch, pass the suture thread from outside (skin) to inside (abdominal wall) 2 mm away from the incision line, and re-insert from inside to outside 5 mm away from the first insertion. Repeat this pattern by re-inserting the suture thread from outside to inside, creating a loop with the thread about two loops on the right side and two loops on the left side of the incision. The purse-string suture will end on the left caudal side of the incision, 5 mm from the start of the suture. Leave the suture loops untightened until step 10.\nThis suture procedure is also described in detail in Ritsma et al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0037]).\n10. Using serrated forceps, carefully insert the skin/muscle wall with suture into the groove of the ring by carefully lifting up the window (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003], g). Once the window is fitted into the groove, pull the loops one by one, starting with the most cranial loop. Finish the suture by pulling the caudal left and right suture end, and secure the suture with an instrument tie (surgeon's knot).\nMake sure that the window does not detach while you are inserting the suture into the ring.\n11. Place the mouse in prone position to allow settling of the liver and abdominal organs.\n12. Place the mouse back into the cage for recovery on a heating pad. Monitor recovery after surgery.\nThe mouse can be caged with other mice that have undergone AIW surgery, but not with mice that have not undergobe surgery.",
    "Place some food in the cage immediately after surgery for easy accessibility.\nDo not place enrichment items in the cage that can damage the AIW.\nMovement of mice should not be impaired because of the AIW.\n13. When imaging with an upright microscope, it is advisable to start imaging 1 day after AIW surgery to allow proper settlement of the liver to the window.\nMultiday multiphoton imaging\nSee also general notes for intravital microscopy settings in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-prot-0002], steps 11-17.\n14. Induce anesthesia of the mouse under 4% (v/v) isoflurane in the anesthesia induction box until the animal does not respond to pain reflexes.\n15. Move the animal onto the microscope platform in supine position, and place with its head in an anesthesia tube (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0004]). Lower isoflurane anesthesia to <1% (v/v). Carefully monitor the breathing and pain reflexes to ensure proper anesthesia.\n16. Apply ophthalmic ointment to prevent drying of the eyes\n17. Place the window in the window holder (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003] and B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-fig-0003], III) and place the window in the groove. Circle the outline of the coverglass with the DAKO pen. After the DAKO pen mark dries, add a droplet of water to allow visualization through the microscope. Locate tumor cells through the ocular.\n18. Once tumor cells are located, imaging sessions can start.\n19. Imaging sessions can be performed up to 2 weeks, with a max of ∼5 imaging sessions, giving animals >24 hr breaks for proper recovery.\nKeep a close eye on the breathing of the mouse to ensure proper anesthesia. To reduce movement, lighter anesthesia may be preferable. The use of a breathing monitor can be beneficial to ensure proper anesthesia induction throughout the experiment.",
    "20. Separate positions, or a larger tile scan can be scanned during one imaging session, keeping the duration of the scan between 45 min and 1 hr.\nA tile scan is helpful to create an overview for each imaging day to allow comparison between different imaging days. The size of the tile scan is dependent on the amount and distribution of tumor cells and the imaging time, but should on average stay within 6 × 6 tiles. Usually, a z stack is required, as the tissue tends to be on a slight angle over large imaging areas.\n21. Individual tumor cells or clusters can be traced back either by identifying tumor cell clusters or by using SHG signal that is generated by collagen-1 fibers (Brown et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.116#cpz1116-bib-0007]).\n22. During longer intravital microscopy experiments, exudate can form on the inside of the coverglass. In a sterile environment, twist out the ring with coverglass and remove the exudate. If the ring is stuck, incubate the window and ring with PBS to dissolve the exudate which is stuck in the insert. Then flush the liver with sterile PBS and place the coverglass and ring back in the window.\n23. After imaging, place the mouse back in the cage. It should recover within 5 min.\n24. After the last imaging session, the animal can be sacrificed using cervical dislocation or CO2 inhalation. Organs can be harvested for further analysis. The abdominal imaging window can be removed, cleaned, and sterilized for reuse."
