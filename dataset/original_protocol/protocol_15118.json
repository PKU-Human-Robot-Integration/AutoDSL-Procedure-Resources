    "Overview: The procedure consists of catheterizing the right jugular vein and left carotid artery under general anesthesia; allowing a 7-day recuperation period; connecting the catheters to the pumps using a swivel and counterweight system that enables the animal to move freely in the cage; and infusing glucose and/or Intralipid (a soybean oil emulsion which generates a mixture of approximately 80% unsaturated/20% saturated fatty acids when infused with heparin 9) for 72 hr.\n1. Canulation of the Right Jugular Vein and the Left Carotid Artery\nSterilize surgical instruments. Canulation tubing must also be cold-sterilized using a liquid sterilizing agent (2.6% glutaraldehyde) prior to the procedure. Immerse the tubing in an autoclaved container for 16-24 hr. Rinse and flush thoroughly with sterile distilled water to remove all traces of glutaraldehyde before use.\nWeigh the rat to calculate drug dosages:\nCarprofen 5 mg/kg: dilution 1/10 = Body weight (g) x 0.001 ml SC (analgesic)\nGlycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg : dilution 1/10 = BW (g) X 0.0012 ml SC (anticholinergic)\nAnesthetize the rat using isoflurane and oxygen.\nPlace the rat on its stomach. Shave the area behind the ears to the base of the shoulders. Lay the rat on its back. Shave the region under the neck to the front paws.\nPrep the surgical site with chlorhexidine, alcohol, and iodine. Administer drugs.\nTransfer the rat to the surgical field.\nUsing aseptic technique, canulate the right jugular vein and the left carotid artery with a PE-50 canula attached to a 1 ml syringe filled with 5 U of heparinized saline. Flush the canulas with 50 U of heparinized saline to avoid clotting during the recovery period. Use blunted 23G needles. Close each canula with a 23G pin.",
    "After the surgery, trim approximately 2.5 mm off the bottom incisors and place the rat in an infusion jacket to prevent the canulas from being eaten.\nProvide oxygen (1 L/min for 10 min) to help evacuate isoflurane.\nPlace the rat in a heated cage until it is fully awake.\nOperate four rats to use one per infusion condition (Table 1).\n2. Post-operative Care (Post-surgical Treatment and Connection of the Catheters)\nWeigh the rats on day 1 and day 2 post-surgery.\nAdminister glycopyrrolate (BW(g) x 0.00048 ml) SC twice on day 1 post-surgery and once on day 2 post-surgery.\nAdditional supportive treatments can be administered if necessary: fluids, heating pad, wet diet, oxygen therapy, analgesics, anticholinergics.\nOn day 7 post-surgery, weigh the rats to calculate the flow rates for infusion.\nConnect each rat to an infusion system using a tether and swivel mounted on a cage grill top (Figure 1).\nFlush the canulas with 5 U of heparinized saline to remove clots. Flush the canulas once more with 50 U of heparinized saline to prevent clotting.\nAllow the rats to acclimate to the tether and swivel for at least 24 hr before starting the infusion.\n3. Infusion\nDraw 0.15 ml of blood from the carotid of each rat and measure glycemia. Flush the jugular canulas. Use 50 U of heparinized saline to prevent clotting in both canulas of each rat.\nTransfer the blood sample to a 0.5 ml collection tube containing 2% EDTA. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 2 min and freeze the plasma at -20 Â°C.\nFill two 60 ml syringes for each of the infusion conditions listed below. Place Syringe 1 on the front position of the pump and place Syringe 2 on the back position of the pump.",
    "Join each pair of solutions together with y-connectors and CO-EX T22 tubing that has been sterilized. Place the syringes on a Harvard 33 dual syringe pump.\nChange the cage bottom and remove all food from the cage grill top.\nWeigh 150 g of standard chow and place on the cage grill top.\nConnect the syringes to the swivel on the cage grill. Flush the syringes properly to remove trapped air from the lines.\nCalculate the infusion flow rates using the body weight that was taken prior to connecting the rat to the infusion system. Rates are calculated with a Microsoft Excel file that converts the glucose infusion rate (GIR) into ml/h.\nSet the pump to administer flow rates for 60 ml syringes according to the manufacturer's settings. Enter the rate for Syringe 1 (front syringe) and the rate for Syringe 2 (back syringe).\nStart the pump.\n4. Monitoring\nAfter starting the pump, verify that there is no leaking from the swivel or from the canulas and that infusion tubing is not twisted. Also verify that there are no air bubbles in the tubing.\nAfter 3 hr of infusion, take a blood sample to monitor glycemia. Repeat after 6, 24, 48, and 72 hr of infusion. As a precaution, glycemia is also monitored after 30, 34, 54, and 60 hr of the infusion. Blood glucose can be measured using one drop of whole blood using a portable glucose monitor. This limits the amount of blood drawn during the infusion and therefore avoids significantly altering blood volume and/or hematocrit.\nThe rate for Syringe 1 is modified based on glycemia values to maintain blood glucose at 220-250 mg/dl. The rate for Syringe 2 does not change during the 72 hr of infusion because free fatty acids are maintained at 1 mmol/L.",
    "Infusion conditions are paired so that the volume received for the control animals is equivalent to the volume received for the test animals (Table 1).\nAfter 24 hr of infusion, change the cage bottom and weigh the food remaining in the cage grill. Return the uneaten portion to the cage grill. Repeat after 48 hr.\nRefill syringes daily as needed during the 72 hr of infusion.\nDuring the infusion, always observe the rat for any signs of inflammation or discomfort. Administer appropriate care if needed.\n5. Post-infusion Euthanasia\nAfter 72 hr of infusion, rats are anesthetized intravenously with 0.5 ml of a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (182 mg/kg of ketamine and 11.6 mg/kg of xylazine diluted 1:2 with 0.9% NaCl).\nThe toe-pinch reflex is used to verify the level of anesthesia. Additional anesthetic is administered as needed.\nWhen the rat is anesthetized, the abdominal cavity is opened with surgical scissors. The rat is exsanguinated by drawing 10-15 ml of blood in a syringe from the aorta or the vena cava.\n Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
