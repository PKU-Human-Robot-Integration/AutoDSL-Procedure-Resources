  "procedures": [
    "All procedures involving animals were carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. The protocol for this study was approved by the Royal North Shore Hospital Animal Care and Ethics Committee. Female Fischer 344 rats (F344, 150-200 g) were maintained at the Kearns Facility, Kolling Institute under standard conditions (12 hr light/dark cycles and free access to food and water).\nNote: A flow chart for all experimental procedures is presented in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of Cells for Implantation\nCulture the rat mesothelioma II-45 cell line (also known as IL-45; derived by peritoneal introduction of crocidolite asbestos) in RPMI 1640 (RPMI) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and grow in standard conditions (37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2). Maintain by passaging and sub-culturing at approximately 1:50 twice a week in a 75 cm2 flask.\nPrepare reagents for cell culture and warm aliquots at 37 °C. Required reagents include serum free RPMI media (SFM), RPMI with 10% FBS, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 0.5% trypsin-EDTA.\nCulture cells for implantation to approximately 70-80% confluence. This ensures they are in the linear growth phase.\nHarvest cells by discarding the media, washing once with 5 ml of sterile PBS and then adding 3 ml of 0.5% trypsin-EDTA.\nReturn flasks to the incubator for approximately 5 min until all cells become non-adherent.\nOnce cells are non-adherent, add 3 ml of RPMI with 10% FBS to inactivate the trypsin. Collect and centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 3 min.\nWash the cell pellet in 10 ml of SFM and centrifuge again at 300 x g for 3 min.\nWash cell pellet again with 10 ml of SFM and centrifuge as above.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 10 ml of SFM and perform a cell count using a hemocytometer or similar instrumentation.\nDilute cells so that 100 µl contains the amount of cells to be implanted.\n\tNote: Tumor growth has been demonstrated at a dose as low as 100 cells in 100 µl but a standard dose is 500,000 cells in 100 µl.\nPrepare sufficient cells in media for the number of rats to be implanted (i.e., 100 µl/rat), plus at least 0.5 ml extra to compensate for losses from priming and the dead volume of the needle.\nPrepare sufficient SFM (without cells) to be implanted into control rats (i.e., 100 µl/rat), plus at least 0.5 ml extra.\n\tNote: The cells and SFM are now ready for implantation. They should be kept at 37 oC and implanted within 2 hr of harvesting to maintain viability.\n2. In vivo Implantation of Cells\nPlace the F344 rat (> 13 weeks of age) into the induction chamber and anesthetize using 1.4% isoflurane inhalation (or the method in use in the facility). Once the rat appears to be asleep move it from the chamber to a nose cone (with 1.4% isoflurane flowing), place it on its back with chest facing up (ventral view). This allows the internal organs to settle away from the chest cavity. Check reflexes according to institutional protocols to ensure the rat is fully anesthetized.\nShave the right regio costalis (chest) area to remove the fur.\nClean the shaven area with 80% v/v ethanol.\n Identify the injection site: on the right side, find the 2nd gland starting cranial. The injection site is 0.5 cm proximal to this, in between the 3rd and 4th rib from the caudal end of the rib cage. (Figure 2A).",
    "Gently mix the II-45 cells to resuspend. Slowly draw the cell suspension (or SFM for control rats) into a 1 ml syringe without a needle attached. If a needle is attached for the drawing up of cells there is the potential for cells to grow along the needle injection line. Attach a 23G x 1¼ needle. Prime the needle and remove any air bubbles.\nOnce the syringe and needle are primed, place a 20 mm long and 5 mm diameter spacer over the needle shaft. This is used to prevent the needle from penetrating too deeply into the pleural cavity during the injection. Approximately 5 mm-12 mm of exposed needle is sufficient for penetration through the ribs without damaging any organs.\nSlowly insert the needle between the ribs, draw back on the syringe to ensure a blood vessel has not been punctured (no blood should appear in the syringe) then inject 100 μl cells or SFM. (Figure 2B).\nRemove the needle and gently roll the rat from side to side to spread cells in the chest cavity.\nPlace the rat into a cage and check for recovery. The rat should be awake within 1 min and starting to move around.\nRepeat for each rat using a new needle. Reusing the same needle will result in cell growth along the injection line of the needle.\nMonitor the well-being of the animals daily.\nEuthanize animals at ethically defined endpoints as governed by the institutional animal ethics committee. The ethical endpoints for the rats in these experiments were weight loss of greater than 10% or labored breathing.\n3. Tail Vein Blood Collection",
    "If blood is to be collected immediately post-cell implantation, keep the rat anesthetized. If sampling blood at another time point, anesthetize the rat using 1.4% isoflurane inhalation. Check reflexes according to institutional protocols to ensure the rat is fully anaesthetized.\nPlace the rat onto its side and locate a lateral tail vein.\nSterilize the tail with 80% ethanol and label a 0.5 ml EDTA collection tube.\nTo collect blood, always start at the caudal end of the tail (approximately one third of the way along). This allows further attempts closer to the cranial end of the tail in case the first attempt is unsuccessful. Never resample caudally as this can cause a blood clot.\nPosition a 23G x 1¼ needle parallel to the lateral vein and slide it into the vein at a shallow angle so it penetrates approximately 10 mm (Figure 3A).\nNote: If the vein has been successfully punctured blood will be visible in the attachment end of the needle (Figure 3B).\nA drop of blood will form on the tail at the site of the needle puncture. Collect this blood using a pipette and transfer into the labelled 0.5 ml (or smaller) EDTA collection tube. For the immune cell assay 25 μl is sufficient. Apply gauze with pressure to puncture site until bleeding stops.\nFlick the blood tube to mix the blood and EDTA to prevent clotting. Keep the time between blood collection and mixing with the EDTA as short as possible to prevent clotting.\nWhen collecting blood from multiple rats store EDTA-blood samples in a rack at RT until analysis. Process blood within 2 hr of collection.\n4. Sample Preparation for Immune Cell Profiling Using the Bead-based Method",
    "Note: This single platform method relies on using commercially available absolute counting tubes that have a known number of beads for each sample. These tubes contain lyophilized pellets that dissolve during sample preparation, releasing the beads. The beads are fluorescently labelled and by gating on the bead population, absolute counts can be calculated.\nEnsure the EDTA whole blood sample is well mixed by placing it on a slow rotary mixer for several min. Label one absolute counting tube for each sample. A pellet containing the beads should be visible underneath the metal bead holder at the bottom of the tube.\nTransfer 25 µl of EDTA whole blood into a labelled absolute counting tube. The bead pellet will dissolve upon addition of the blood.\nTo each tube add 20 µl of anti-rat T/B/Natural Killer (NK) cell cocktail, 10 µl of anti-rat CD8a PE, 10 µl of anti-rat CD4 (domain 1) FITC and 10 µl of anti-rat CD45 PE/Cy7 (Figure 4A). Fluorophores are defined in Table 1.\nCentrifuge the tube briefly (300 x g) to ensure the antibodies and cells are in the bottom of the tube and not stuck to the side of the tube. Vortex to mix and incubate for 15 min at RT.\nTo lyse red blood cells add 400 µl of 10 mM Tris, 0.15 M ammonium chloride buffer (pH 7.5) and vortex to mix. Lysis is complete when the sample appears translucent and not cloudy (Figures 4B and C). Failure to lyse the sample completely will lead to increased background and falsely elevated counts when analyzing by flow cytometry.\n5. Flow Cytometric Processing of Samples\nNote: Perform on a 4 color flow cytometer.\nOpen the software in acquisition mode and a new template with 8 plots as depicted in Figure 5.",
    "Adjust instrument settings to those listed in Table 1 and set up gate R1 (FITC [FL-1] versus APC [FL-4]), Figure 5Ai) to count the fluorescent beads. The other gates are not as important at this acquisition stage but will be required for analysis. The absolute counting beads used in this protocol contain fluorescent dyes and can be detected in any channel although are weakest in the blue channel.\nUsing a prepared control blood sample, vortex and then load onto the cytometer and run at a low speed (12 µl/min) on setup mode so data acquisition gates can be adjusted.\nSet the acquisition to collect 10,000 events in the R1 bead gate.\nSet up a folder to record data and set file number and label sample file in acquisition menu.\nLoad the sample to be analyzed onto the cytometer and set the flow rate to medium (35 µl/min). Run each sample at the same flow rate. The flow rate may need to be varied to low (12 µl/min) or high (60 µl/min), but medium is generally appropriate. At this rate it takes approximately 90 to 120 sec to acquire 10,000 bead events for each sample.\nOnce the sample is loaded watch the scatter plots to make sure events are appearing in the R1 bead gate. Initially there can be some instability in the sample pressure causing drift in the scatter plots. Wait for this to stabilize.\nOnce stabilized, click on acquire and allow sample to run. Once the cytometer has finished acquiring 10,000 bead events in R1 the cytometer will stop acquiring and save all data.\nRemove the sample and discard flow tube. The cytometer is now ready for the next sample. Run all samples and then proceed to analysis mode.\n6. Immune Cell Analysis",
    "Note: Gating strategies and Boolean algebra are used to define each cell population. Boolean algebra is a logic based analysis method that allows for multiple operations in a single definition. The analysis software of the flow cytometer (e.g., BD CELLQuest) allows for the use of Boolean algebra. The equations are used to actively account for the significant negative reactivity that assists in defining the cell to more specifically identify each cell population. ‘Regions’ are used to define a ‘gate’. Regions define a 2 dimensional space whereas gates can be composed of numerous regions connected by algebraic operators (+, *,-, defined in Table 2).\nSwitch the software to analysis mode. An analysis template should be generated to match Figure 5 with the plots and gates shown.\nAnalyze each individual file (i.e., each individual sample) separately. Set up gates R1 through to R9 and then set up the algorithms for each cell type as defined in Table 2 (also shown in Figure 5) .\nUse the cell statistics counter to calculate individual cell populations defined by gates and algorithms (Table 2 and Figure 5). The algorithms will adjust cell numbers automatically in the cell statistics counter.\nCalculate cell subsets using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53019/53019eq1.jpg\n\tNote: Number of cell events counted (e.g., CD4 T cell events) is enumerated using the above equation to give cell number per µl of blood. Examples are shown in Figure 5.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
