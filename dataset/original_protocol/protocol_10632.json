    "All of the surgical procedures relating to the animals should be approved by local Institution's Animal Care and Ethics Committee, with an effort made to minimize pain and discomfort caused by the surgery.\n1. Preparation\nSelect 8-12 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice with a body weight of approximately 25 g for surgery.\nAnesthetize the animals through intraperitoneal injection of a cocktail containing both xylazine (5 mg/kg) and ketamine (40 mg/kg).\nShave the knee with razors, then surgically drape the animal and sterilize the surgical site with betadine and alcohol (3x) and cover the mouse eyes with ointment.\n2. Surgical Process\nMake a 1 cm longitudinal medial para-patellar incision to expose knee joint.\nOpen the knee joint gently through lateral dislocation of the patella and patellar ligament.\n\t\nCut the knee joint capsule longitudinally through the medial para-patellar incision in step 2.1.\nDissect knee joint capsule with forceps.\nGrab the distal part of hind paw with left hand, and perform lateral dislocation of the patella and patellar ligament with forceps. Hold the hind paw gently and make sure to avoid trauma in the paw. The better the joint capsule is dissected, the less force will be required to make the dislocation.\nDrip sterile saline on the surface of articular cartilage during operation to avoid drying out of cartilage surface.\nCut through the medial meniscotibial ligament which anchors medial meniscus to the tibial plateau. Avoid injuring the cartilage beneath the medial meniscus.\n\t\nIdentify the medial meniscus which locates between medial condyle of femur and medial plateau of tibia.\nIdentify the meniscotibial ligament which connects lateral side of medial meniscus with intercondylar eminence of tibia.",
    "Hold the hind paw gently with hand, and cut through the medial meniscotibial ligament carefully by using a No. 10 surgical blade. Make sure not to cause injure to articular cartilage and other ligaments. In many cases, the covering fat pad needs to be pulled to the side but not to be removed in order to identify the ligament.\nClose the knee joint capsule with a 6-0 absorbable suture.\nClose the skin with 6-0 silk suture.\n3. Post-operative Care\nApply one drop of 0.25% bupivacaine in the surgical site of each mouse to minimize post-operative pain.\nLeave the operated mice free to get water and food.\n4. Histological Scoring of Surgical DMM Model\nSacrifice the mice at indicated time points (e.g. 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. Here we showed results of 8 weeks as representative) after the surgery.\nThe entire knee joints are fixed, decalcified, embedded by paraffin and then sectioned serially at 5 µm interval.\n\t\nCut the whole hind limbs with No. 10 blades.\nDissect the skin and muscles of the hind limbs carefully, and fix the samples with 4% PFA for 3 days in RT.\nRemove the PFA, and clean the samples with water. Afterwards, decalcify the samples in EDTA at 4 °C for 2 weeks.\nDehydrate the samples in an ethanol gradient. In detail, keep the samples in 70% ethanol for 1 hr, then change the ethanol and keep the samples in a new set of 70% ethanol for O/N. Afterwards, put the samples in 80% and 90% ethanol consequently, and keep them for 1 hr, respectively, followed by 100% ethanol for O/N.\nRemove the ethanol. Keep the samples in oxylene for 1 hr, and change to a new set of oxylene. Repeat this step 3x.",
    "Embed the samples into a paraffin mold using the Leica embedding center. Afterwards, the samples are sectioned at 5 μm using a rotary microtome (Leica RM2255, Germany) and then collected onto glass slides.\nSerial sagittal sections are cut for each sample spanning a region from the center of the lateral condyle to the center of the medial condyle.\nSafranin O staining is performed, followed by scoring and statistical analysis through OARSI scoring system as described previously25.\n\t\nFirst, deparaffinize the slides in oxylene, and hydrate them in an ethanol gradient to distilled water. Thereafter, the slides are stained through Weigert's Iron Hematoxylin Solution, 0.05% Fast Green (FCF) Solution, 1% Acetic Acid Solution, and 0.1% Safranin O Solution. Mount the slides using resinous medium.\nScore the Safranin O stained slides based on loss of proteoglycan (red color) in cartilage and percentage of destruction in cartilage structure, do statistical analysis for the histological score.\nSubscription Required.
