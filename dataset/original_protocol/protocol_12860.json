    "All methods are in accordance and compliance with the Helmholtz Zentrum München institutional, state, and federal guidelines.\n1. Preparation\nMake a detailed plan of the experimental setup including a time schedule, when to add 4sU to the cell culture medium, and when to harvest the cells for each method. Depending on the biological question, carefully consider time points for sample drawing, 4sU-labeling time, and concentration (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: Verify the impact of 4sU on cell viability and stress response in advance (see \"Verify optimal 4sU-labeling conditions\" in Representative Results and Figure 1). It is recommended to perform a preliminary test of each method with at least one sample. Verify if the quality and amount of RNA/DNA is sufficient for deep sequencing (see dedicated parts of the protocol), and practice fast but gentle handling of the cells during the experiment.\nCalculate the number of cells needed for every time point of each method (see Table 2 for a rough estimation when using primary T cells). Also, consider sequencing fewer samples of total RNA than just that of 4sU RNA (e.g., just for time point translation rates or RNA turnover rates should be calculated). To confirm and verify the significance of the results (recommended), create at least one biological replicate.\n\tNOTE: Importantly, for all methods and consecutive time points, samples must be from the same starting pool of cells. At least one dedicated researcher for each method is recommended.\nPrepare everything necessary in advance (e.g., aliquoted 4sU, cycloheximide, Mammalian Lysis Buffer, and 1% formaldehyde). After addition of 4sU, avoid exposing the cells to bright light, as this may lead to crosslinking of 4sU-labeled RNA to cellular proteins18.",
    "Pool all cells of interest in one flask just prior to treatment (Figure 2). Count the cells (e.g., with a hemocytometer) and use the required amount for the untreated control of each method (do not forget to also label the untreated control for 4sU-seq with 4sU). Treat remaining cells and immediately split the required number of cells for each time point and method. Handle cells as quickly as possible to minimize stress due to changes in temperature or CO2 levels.\n\tNOTE: For example, samples are taken 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after treatment, then one quarter of the cells is used for untreated control, and three quarters are used for treated control.\n2. 4sU-Labeling\nNOTE: This protocol is modified from Rädle, et al.19 Refer to their protocol for further information regarding metabolic labeling with 4sU. For all methods and consecutive time points, samples must originate from the same starting pool of cells.\nStart of Labeling\nThaw aliquoted 4sU just before use. Add 4sU at each time point directly to the medium containing cells of interest (refer to Table 2 for recommended T cell numbers, least 60 µg RNA per time point), mix gently, and place back into the incubator. Dispose remaining 4sU (do not refreeze).\nAt the end of labeling, collect cells (e.g., cell scraper) and centrifuge at 330 x g for 5 min at 4 °C in polypropylene tubes (which resist high g forces). Aspirate medium and add reagent for RNA isolation (≥1 mL per 3 x 106 cells, see materials for recommendation which to use) to each tube. Fully resuspend the pellet (≥1 mL per 3 x 106 cells), incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT), and freeze samples at -20 °C. Samples can be stored at -20 °C for at least 1 month.",
    "Caution: The reagents used for RNA isolation are extremely hazardous when getting in contact with skin or eyes. Handle these with care and consider the safety instructions. \nRNA preparation using modified RNA isolation protocol\nAdd 0.2 mL chloroform per 1 mL reagent for RNA isolation, and mix thoroughly by shaking for 15 s. Proceed as mentioned in the metabolic labeling protocol (step 1 - 12, 2. RNA preparation using modified trizol protocol) from Rädle et al.19\nMeasure RNA concentration (see Table of Materials), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use this RNA for total RNA-seq as well (see step 3. Total RNA-seq) or store at -80 °C for at least 1 month.\nThiol-Specific Biotinylation of Newly Transcribed RNA\nStart with 30 - 80 µg of total cellular RNA. 60 µg RNA should yield sufficient amounts of newly transcribed RNA.\nPrepare labeling reaction. Pipette in the following order (per µg RNA): 1 µL 10x Biotinylation Buffer, 7 µL RNA (containing 1 µg RNA diluted in nuclease-free H2O), and 2 µL biotin-HPDP (1 mg/mL). Add biotin-HPDP last and mix immediately by pipetting. Wrap tubes with aluminum foil to avoid exposure to bright light. See the discussion for an alternative to biotin-HPDP. Incubate at RT for 1.5 h with rotation.\nCentrifuge appropriate 2 mL tubes (see Table of Materials) at 15,000 x g for 2 min. Pipette all of the biotinylated RNA into the pre-spun 2 mL tube, add an equal volume of chloroform, and mix vigorously. Incubate for 2 - 3 min until the phases begin to separate and bubbles start to disappear.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Carefully transfer the upper aqueous phase into a new tube.",
    "Repeat steps 2.3.3. and 2.3.4. once. Add 10% of the volume of NaCl (5 M) and an equal volume of isopropanol to the aqueous phase. Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard supernatant.\nAdd an equal volume freshly prepared 75% ethanol. Centrifuge at 20,000 x g. Discard the supernatant, spin briefly, and remove the remaining ethanol. Fully resuspend in 30 - 100 µL H2O (use 1 µL H2O per 1 µg input RNA from step 2.3.1) by pipette mixing.\nVerify RNA integrity by electrophoretic analysis, or take an aliquot and verify later.\nSeparation of Newly Transcribed (Labeled) and Preexisting (Unlabeled) RNA\nRemove paramagnetic beads (see Table of Materials) from 4 °C storage and let it stand for at least 30 min to bring them to room temperature. Heat 4sU washing buffer (3 mL per sample) to 65 °C.\nPrepare 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) solution. Weigh DTT on an ultra-fine scale and add the required amount of nuclease-free water. Always prepare fresh. Use 200 µL per sample.\nHeat biotinylated RNA samples (1 µg/µL) to 65 °C for 10 min to denature and immediately place on ice. Add 100 µL streptavidin beads to biotinylated RNA and incubate at RT for 15 min with rotation.\nPlace an appropriate column (see Table of Materials for recommendations) for each sample into the magnetic stand, and pre-equilibrate each column with 1 mL room temperature 4sU washing buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: This will take approximately 5 - 10 min. If any of the columns do not initiate draining after 5 min, press gently on top of the column with a gloved finger.",
    "Apply an RNA/beads mix to the middle of each column. Discard the flow-through, unless unlabeled RNA needs to be recovered. If so, collect the flow-through and at least the first wash. Perform the recovery of RNA as described by Rädle et al. (step 1 - 7, 7. Recovery of Unlabeled, Unbound RNA)19.\nWash three times with 0.9 mL 4sU washing buffer (preheated to 65 °C from step 2.4.2.) and 0.9 mL RT 4sU washing buffer, respectively.\nUse paramagnetic beads to recover newly transcribed RNA. Pipette 400 µL of well-dispersed RT paramagnetic beads in a tube per sample and place underneath each column. Elute newly transcribed RNA with 100 µL 100 mM DTT. Wait for 3 min and perform a second elution with 100 µL 100 mM DTT. (Optional: Perform elution and recovery as described by Rädle et al.)19\nMix newly transcribed RNA/beads thoroughly by pipette mixing 10 times and proceed according to the manufacturer's guideline. Elute RNA in 11 µL nuclease-free H2O.Quantify RNA using a suitable fluorometer (see Table of Materials). RNA can be stored at -80 °C for at least 1 month.\n\t\tNOTE: Newly transcribed RNA can be used to prepare cDNA libraries for next-generation sequencing (see Table of Materials for a suggestion on which kit to use) or further downstream analyses. 100 - 500 ng RNA are sufficient for most library preparation kits (see Discussion).\n3. Total RNA-Seq\nDirectly take RNA from 4sU labeled RNA after RNA preparation using the modified reagent for RNA isolation protocol for total RNA-seq (see step 2.2.2.)\nFor library preparation, dilute an RNA aliquot to a final concentration of 50 - 100 ng/µL. Use the same kit as for library preparation of newly transcribed RNA. 100 - 500 ng RNA are sufficient for most library preparation kits.\n4. Ribosome Profiling",
    "NOTE: For all methods and consecutive time points, samples must be from the same starting pool of cells . For recommendations on which kit to use, refer to the Table of Materials.\nPreparation and Isolation of Ribosome Protected Fragments (RPFs):\nUse appropriate amounts of cells for each time point (refer to Table 2 for recommended T cell numbers). Treat adherent cells with cycloheximide as described in the manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\tCaution: Cycloheximide is highly toxic and may cause mutations. Avoid skin contact and inhalation.\nCollect and pool non- or semi-adherent cells from each time point into one polypropylene tube and adjust the final concentration to 1 x 106 cells per mL of cell-specific medium (e.g., supplemented RPMI for T cells). Add cycloheximide with a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, mix by inverting the polypropylene tube, and incubate for 1 min. Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 330 x g at 4 °C. Aspirate medium and wash cells with at least 10 mL PBS supplemented with cycloheximide (final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL).\nCentrifuge cells for 5 min at 330 x g at 4 °C. Aspirate medium and add 100 µL mammalian cell lysis buffer per 10 x 106 cells. Mix by pipetting and expel through a sterile 22 25-gauge needle to lyse the cells completely.\nTransfer the cell lysate to a precooled 1.5 mL tube. Incubate for 10 min on ice with periodic inversions. Centrifuge for 10 min at 20,000 x g at 4 °C to clarify the lysate. Transfer the supernatant to a precooled 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Prepare a 1:10 dilution of the lysate with nuclease-free water and record an A260reading using a spectrophotometer. Use nuclease-free water as a blank and a 1:10 dilution of mammalian cell lysis buffer as the standard. Calculate the A260/mL concentration of the lysate according to the following equation:\n\t\t(A260 cell lysate - A260 Mammalian Lysis Buffer) x 10 dilution factor = A260/mL\nCreate 200 µL aliquots of the lysate on ice and proceed with nuclease treatment.\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, prepare a 100 µL aliquot for total RNA, add 10 µL of 10% SDS and mix. Store at 4 °C and proceed with 4.3.2. Using total RNA from 4sU-labeled RNA is recommended (see step 3. Total RNA-seq).\nRibosome footprinting\nPerform nuclease treatment immediately without freezing the lysate. Add 7.5 units of nuclease (included in the recommended kit) for each A260 of lysate. For example: 80 A260/mL lysate x 0.2 mL lysate x 7.5 U/A260nuclease = 120 U nuclease.\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, titrate the nuclease for digestion as described by the manufacturer.\nIncubate the nuclease reaction for 45 min at RT with gentle mixing. Freeze 200 µL aliquots of the lysate with liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C, or stop the nuclease reaction by adding 15 µL RNase inhibitor to each 200 µL aliquot, and continue with step 4.3.2.\nPurification of RPFs\nUnfreeze one sample of nuclease digested RPFs and add 15 µL RNase inhibitor.
