    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nAnneal smiFISH Probeset with FLAP Oligo\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThe principle of smiFISH is that the oligo marked with the two dye molecules (the FLAP) is complementary to the 3′ end of each probeset oligo. They must be annealed together before using the probeset.\nAnneal FLAP oligo to the probeset in a PCR machine\nThe smiFISH probeset is prepared as a 20 μM equimolar mixture of the 15 hTR probes in Tris-EDTA pH8.0 (TE).\nAnneal in PCR cycler then spin down and store on ice protected from light.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_182_7.csv\nNote: For dual-color FISH as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], the same FLAP sequence can be used since each probeset is annealed with its FLAP-dye oligo in a separate tube. Once annealed, we have not seen any exchanges between FLAP-dye oligos in dual-color FISH.\nPrepare Samples\nTiming: ∼1.5 h\nTo detect RNA and proteins by microscopy, the cells must be grown on glass coverslips. Once they reach an appropriate density, the cells are fixed by formaldehyde cross-linking, then permeabilized to create openings for the fluorescent probes and antibodies to enter.\nNote: Prepare gelatin-coated coverslips fresh for every experiment. Autoclave acid-washed coverslips in a beaker of water with 0.5% gelatin. Allow the gelatin beaker to cool then place coverslips in a 6-well plate, rinse with 1× PBS, replace with media and cells. Do not let the gelatin-coated coverslips dry. Alternative coverslip preparation methods appropriate to the cell type are also compatible with smiFISH.\nCells grown in a 6-well plate on 22 × 22 mm no. 1.5 coverslips are fixed in 4% formaldehyde (fixation buffer).",
    "Bring 6-well plate to the chemical fume hood. Remove media and replace with 2 mL fixation buffer per well. Wrap plate in plastic film and incubate for 20 min at 20°C–22°C with gentle agitation.\nRinse twice with 2 mL per well of 1× PBS.\nPause Point: Fixed cells can be kept in 1× PBS at 4°C for several days. However, proceeding with smiFISH the same day is optimal in order to minimize RNA degradation.\nPermeabilize with 2 mL per well of 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 5 min at 20°C–22°C with gentle agitation.\nRinse twice with 2 mL per well of 1× PBS.\nRinse once with 2 mL per well of 1× SSC 15% formamide.\nIncubate 15 min or more with 2 mL per well of 1× SCC 15% formamide at 20°C–22°C.\nCritical: Do not let the coverslips dry out at any step.\nsmiFISH Hybridization\nTiming: 12–18 h\nHybridization with the probeset oligos occurs at 37°C overnight with a high concentration of probes in a small volume. The hybridization solution must not evaporate, and RNAse contamination should be avoided.\nPrepare smiFISH hybridization mix and store on ice protected from light.\nPrepare a nuclease-free airtight hybridization chamber as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/182-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Setup of an Airtight Hybridization Chamber on a Glass Plate\n(A) Start with a clean 16 × 20 cm glass plate.\n(B) Fix Parafilm to glass by pressing lightly with a rounded pen or PCR film paddle tool.\n(C) Pipet 50 μL of smiFISH hybridization mix on Parafilm.\n(D) Invert coverslip cell-side down on hybridization mix.\n(E and F) (E) Cover with second sheet of Parafilm and (F) seal four sides.\n(G and H) (G) Wrap in plastic film and (H) aluminum foil.",
    "Fix a length of Parafilm (paper side on top) on a large glass plate by rubbing the edges with a rounded pen cap. Remove paper.\nPipet 50 μL of hybridization mix on the Parafilm and invert coverslip cell-side down on the drop. Try not to trap bubbles.\nRemove paper from a second length of Parafilm, deposit on top, and seal the four sides. Wrap glass plate in plastic film.\nIncubate at 37°C overnight protected from light.\nUnwrap and remove the top sheet. Pinch up the bottom Parafilm sheet near each coverslip to break the liquid tension. Carefully pick up the coverslip and place cell-side up in a clean 6-well dish containing 2 mL 1× SSC 15% formamide per well.\nWash twice with 1× SSC 15% formamide at 37°C for 30 min.\nWash twice with 1× PBS at 20°C–22°C.\nNote: Clean needle-tip tweezers with RNAseZAP or similar solution, rinse in 70% ethanol.\nPause Point: If you are only performing smiFISH, the coverslips are now ready for DNA stain and mounting.\nImmunofluorescence\nTiming: ∼6 h\nBefore detecting the protein of interest with antibody, the cells are incubated with high protein solution to reduce non-specific sticking. After the primary antibody incubation, secondary antibody cross-linked to dye molecules is used to detect the primary antibody. The nuclear boundary is marked by staining the DNA with a fluorescent dye.\nIncubate with 2 mL per well of IF antibody buffer for 1 to 1.5 h at 20°C–22°C with gentle agitation to block non-specific binding.\nCritical: Protect from light during all steps.\nDilute primary antibodies in IF antibody buffer. For Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], we combined anti-coilin mouse mAb 1: 500 and anti-TRF2 rabbit pAb 1:200.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/182-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Cut out a Parafilm circle and fix to the bottom of the dish with the paper side up.\nRemove paper. Pick up coverslip and gently blot the edge on a Kimwipe to drain excess liquid. Deposit on Parafilm cell-side up.\nPipet 150 μL of 1st antibody solution on top of the coverslip.

For Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], we combined anti-mouse AF488 1: 6500 and anti-rabbit AF594 1:6500.\nPrepare antibody incubation chamber as in step 10. Incubate 2nd antibody for 50 to 60 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash twice in 2 mL per well of IF antibody buffer.",
    "Wash 4 times in 2 mL per well of 1× PBS 0.1% Triton X-100 wash buffer.\nIncubate with H33342 staining solution (0.5 μg/mL in 1× PBS) for 5–10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash twice with 1 mL/well 1× PBS.\nPick up coverslip and gently blot the edge on a Kimwipe to drain excess liquid. Mount one coverlip per slide with Prolong mounting media. Let it harden at 20°C–22°C protected from light for the recommended 24–72 h. Seal the four corners of the coverslip with a drop of nail polish and let dry completely before imaging.\nAlternatives: Use other antifade mounting medium. We have also had good results with Vectashield (skip step 19 if mountant contains DAPI)."
