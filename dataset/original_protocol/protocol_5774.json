  "title": "Slow and Fast Desiccation of Single-cell Thick Fronds of Filmy Ferns",
  "procedures": [
    "Wash the detached fronds from fully hydrated plants by soaking in distilled water for five minutes, remove excess water carefully by blotting with absorbent paper.Place the fronds in a glass desiccator in the dark at room temperature, with 500 g silica gel (fast desiccation) or over 500 ml of a saturated solution of potassium chloride (KCl), 75% RH (slow desiccation) for 24 h. Weight fronds every 10 min. Weight needs to be determined very rapidly.For rehydration, place the previously desiccated fronds in Petri dishes with 10 ml distilled water in the dark for 24 h. Weight fronds every 10 min."
