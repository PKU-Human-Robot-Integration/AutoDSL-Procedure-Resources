    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Euthanasia by carbon dioxide asphyxiation\nTiming: 5–10 min (for each cage of mice)\nNote: Cervical dislocation could also be used as an acceptable alternative to asphyxiation.\nThis section describes ethical euthanasia of subject mice.\nThe mice are placed in the euthanasia chamber.\nThe air inside the chamber is slowly displaced by 100% CO2.\nAsphyxiation is performed in three sequential phases:\nPhase I- Induction: There is a gradual displacement of air with CO2 for about a minute. As a result, the mice lose consciousness.\nPhase II- Euthanasia: The flow rate of CO2 is increased to 100% for two minutes during which respiration ceases.\nPhase III- Emptying: This lasts 2 min and is characterized by CO2 absorption.\nIt is advised to maintain the CO2 flow for at least 1–2 min post-respiratory arrest (Grosjean et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPart 2: Isolation of mouse kidneys for processing\nTiming: 2–5 min\nThis section describes the process of isolating mouse kidneys for preservation.\nPerform the following steps in a sterile hood (if part of the tissue has to be used for culture) at room temperature (21°C).\nPlace the euthanized mouse in a supine position on a dissection platform that has been disinfected with 70% ethanol (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1635-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation and OCT cryopreservation of mouse kidneys\n(A) Using dissection scissors, the abdominal membrane is cut to expose the internal organs of the mouse.\n(B) Sectioning of the kidney. i - Kidneys isolated in 1× PBS or RPMI media are placed in a petri dish for sectioning. ii - One of the kidneys is cut in half using a scalpel blade making sure to remove the capsule.",
    "(C) Preparation of the cryomold with the kidney sample for freezing. i- Cryomold is then partially filled with OCT compound. ii - One half of the mouse kidney is placed on the OCT compound. iii- The cryomold is then filled with OCT compound such that it covers the kidney completely. iv- Cryomold with the OCT compound and kidney is dipped in chilled acetone.\n(D) Freezing of the kidney. i – iv - Depicts the progressive rapid freezing of the kidney sample in the cryomold.\n(E) Storage of the frozen kidney. i-ii - The completely frozen cryomold with kidney embedded in OCT compound is wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a tissue cassette and frozen at −80°C.\nPin the legs of the mouse at a 90° angle to the body on the dissection board.\nSpray ethanol on the ventral side of the mouse.\nUsing dissection scissors, make a midline incision pointing towards the tail to help cut open the skin.\nMake lateral incisions at the shoulder joints and the pelvic girdles so that it is easy to peel open the skin.\nUse forceps and fingers to carefully separate the skin layers while keeping the internal organs intact (Bajpai et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nUsing dissection scissors, cut open the abdominal membrane to expose the internal organs.\nLocate the kidneys, gently separate them from associated tissue, and using clean tweezers and dissection scissors, cut the renal artery, vein and ureter to liberate the kidneys.\nTransfer the kidneys to a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube containing 1× PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) or RPMI-1640 (Rosewell Park Memorial Institute 1640) media.\nPart 3: OCT (optimal cutting temperature) cryopreservation of kidneys\nTiming: 10–15 min\nThis section describes cryopreservation of mouse kidneys.",
    "The amount of OCT required for proper infiltration of the tissue is about 25-30-fold relative to the tissue size. Ensure that the size of the cryomold or the tissue is adequate to allow for this.\nGently fill the corners of the cryomold (Tissue-Tek) with the OCT compound (tissue embedding medium) making sure it is present evenly throughout the mold. Ensure no introduction of bubbles as this may lead to artifact formation while sectioning using a microtome.\nFill a steel can halfway with 100% acetone and rest it on dry ice for a minute. Add one or two small chips of dry ice at a time to the acetone to lower the temperature. Caution: adding excess dry ice may cause the acetone to overflow.\nTake the isolated kidney and cut lengthwise with the help of a scalpel or dissection scissors. (Please note that the following steps are to be performed on ice).\nWith clean forceps, carefully place the desired section of the tissue in the center of the OCT compound on the cryomold with the incision surface face down. Note: the section that is facing the bottom of the cryomold, will be the side sectioned first.\nCarefully dispense more OCT onto the tissue specimen till it is completely covered and allow it to settle for 15–30 s. Care should be taken to avoid air bubbles. If air bubbles form, remove them before proceeding.\nDip the cryomold containing the tissue and OCT compound into the chilled acetone using long forceps. This will freeze the contents of the cryomold turning it completely white (opaque). Brittleness may result from slow freezing of the specimen and hence care should be taken to ensure the rapid OCT freezing is complete within 2 min.",
    "Remove the tissue block from the cryomold and trim the edges with a razor blade.\nPlace the OCT embedded tissue in cryovial/tissue cassettes (pre-cooled) and store it at −80°C (Wiles, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nPart 4: Cryosectioning of a cryopreserved kidney specimen\nTiming: 60 min\nThis section describes cryosectioning of cryopreserved kidneys. Also see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nThe OCT embedded tissue block is placed on dry ice and transported to the cryostat.\nTransfer the specimen tissue block to the cryostat chamber and let it equilibrate to the set temperature of the cryostat.\nCritical: The above step of acclimatization will help in yielding high quality tissue slices by preventing the curling of the specimen ribbons. It is critical to avoid sample thawing (Li et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nMount the tissue block onto the tissue block holder of the cryostat with OCT.\nAlign the tissue block with the correct orientation of the specimen.\nChoose the desired thickness (we use 7 μm) of the sections.\nTurn the cryostat handwheel to form a strip or ribbon of sections of the desired thickness.\nTransfer the sections onto a clean pre-chilled microscope slide and rub the back of the slide with the hand to warm it to ensure the sections adhere well.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Microtome sectioning of OCT cryopreserved kidney specimen, related to Part 4, steps 24–33\n(To adhere the tissue section, coated or positively charged slides are used. Poly-L-Lysine coated slides have greater retainability of tissues).\nAir-dry the slides at room temperature (21°C) for 20–30 min to ensure the tissue section adheres more strongly to the slide.\nCritical: Air drying time is critical to ensure tissue samples adhere to the microscope slides.",
    "Slides can be placed in a slide box wrapped in foil and placed inside a zip-top bag. Store at −80°C (Can be stored viably for at least 6 months).\nThe remaining OCT embedded tissue can be stored at −80°C in cryomold with a sufficient amount of OCT compound to prevent freeze-drying during storage (Fra-Bido et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) (Can be stored viably for at least 5 years).\nPart 5: Immunohistochemistry\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes antibody staining to detect immunoreactants in mouse kidney.\nRemove slides stored at −80°C and thaw at room temperature (21°C).\nDry the sides of the slides with a lint-free tissue.\nTo rehydrate the slides, arrange them in an appropriate slide staining jar.\nWash the slides in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (wash buffer) for 5 min (3 times).\nChange the solution between each wash.\nNote: From this step on, care should be taken to avoid slides from dehydrating which results in increased background staining and problems with imaging (Fra-Bido et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nUsing a mini PAP pen, mark out a boundary encircling but a few millimeters away from the tissue.\nNote: The hydrophobic wax residue will help localize the antibody solution within the marked boundary throughout the various stages of slide preparation.\nLeave to rest for 1–2 min for the wax to completely dry.\nTo prevent non-specific binding of the antibodies, add (∼300 μL) blocking buffer (3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)/0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) to the slides.\nIncubate at room temperature (21°C) for 1–2 h on a rocker in a humidified chamber (Kang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nRemove the blocking buffer, add the appropriate dilution of the primary antibody in PBS and incubate the slides at 4°C overnight (18–20 h).\nWash the slides in PBS for 5 min (thrice) at room temperature (21°C).",
    "(Optional step to be done when primary antibody is unconjugated) Add appropriate dilutions of secondary antibody labeled with the fluorochrome in 5% BSA/PBS and incubate at room temperature (21°C) for 1–2 h (Kang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\n(Optional step to be done when primary antibody is unconjugated) Rinse the slides in PBS for 5 min (thrice) at room temperature (21°C).\nWithout disrupting the tissue, wipe off the excess PBS on the slide.\nApply mounting medium (ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant) directly to the tissue and using forceps carefully place a coverslip on top of this.\nRemove any air bubbles and allow the mounting medium to set at room temperature (21°C) for 15–30 min.\nFor imaging, store dried slides at 4°C (Fra-Bido et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPart 6: Image acquisition on fluorescence microscope\nTiming: 30–60 min\nThis section describes acquisition of fluorescent images from mouse sections.\nStained and mounted slides can be imaged on any epifluorescence microscope with appropriate 20×, 40× or 60× oil objectives. Details given below apply to an Olympus IX 71 inverted microscope with an Olympus DP70 microscope digital camera.\nSwitch mercury lamp on at least 10 min earlier to warm up (X-Cite Series 120-Q by Excelitas Technologies).\nApply a small drop of immersion oil (Immersion oil Type-F IMMOIL-F30CC) onto slide or objective and place slide face down onto objective.\nFocus on several glomeruli per slide section and capture images. Images are saved as high-resolution TIFF files.\nExamples of fluorescence intensity in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nOptional step: Tail vein injection of mice with commercial immunoglobulin A\nTiming: 7 days of tail vein injection with commercial IgA\nThis section describes the optional tail vein injection of immunoglobulin A.\nWeigh the mouse.\nCalculate the amount of immunoglobulin dose according to the weight of the mouse.\nUse a mechanical restraint device to restrain the mouse.",
    "Make sure the pores present in the front of the restraint device are free to ensure the mouse is breathing.\nUse the hole at the rear end of the device to stabilize the mouse tail.\nPlace the tail of the mouse under the heat lamp for a minute for easy visualization and to facilitate vasodilation of the lateral vein of the mouse.\nDisinfect the tail with 75% ethanol.\nAdjust the position of the tail’s lateral side and secure it with the left hand (Wrobel et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nInsert the catheter needle at 30° angle into the vein (2 cm from the tip of the tail) and inject the immunoglobulin solution slowly and steadily.\nOnce the contents have been injected, carefully remove the needle, and apply gentle pressure to the injection site till the bleeding stops.\nRelease the mouse out of the restraint device and check for vital signs.\nPlace the mouse back in the original cage immediately after injection (He et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])."
