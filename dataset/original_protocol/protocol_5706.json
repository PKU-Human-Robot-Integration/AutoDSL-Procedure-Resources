    "Growth and synchronization of nematode populationPick L4 larvae of animals of desired genetic backgrounds onto 100 mm or 60 mm NGM plates freshly seeded with E. coli (OP50). Use at least two 100 mm or four 60 mm NGM plates for each nematode strain with 5-10 and 20-30 animals each, respectively.Incubate the animals at 20 °C for 3-4 days till plates contain a large number of eggs. Wash the eggs and nematodes off the plates into individual 15-ml centrifuge tubes for each genotype using about 4 ml of M9 per plate of nematodes. Spin these down for 3 min at 6,180 x g in a clinical centrifuge equipped with a swing basket rotor and aspirate out the M9. Add 3-4 ml of the bleach solution to each tube containing the worm pellet and vortex at full speed for 15 sec every 2 min for 6 min. Add M9 to fill each tube and spin at 6,180 x g for 1 min. Repeat the wash with M9 three times and move the worm eggs/carcass pellet to a fresh half-filled 15-ml tube of M9. To synchronize, allow the animals to hatch in the absence of food by nutating at 20 °C for anywhere between 16-48 h (make sure that within an experiment all strains are synchronized for similar amounts of time). Due to lack of food, all the animals will arrest at L1 stage of larval growth. Spin these tubes down at 6,180 x g for 1.5 min and put the worms down on individual OP50 seeded NGM plates and keep at 20 °C (approximately 6,000 to 10,000 worms per 100 mm plate).",
    "These animals will reach the L4 larval stage at ~42 h, at which point they should be moved to FUDR plates to prevent them from producing progeny (and to avoid complication of ROS production of progeny). These sterilized animals will be analyzed the next day (they will be day 1 adult animals at ~66 h) for the assay.Note: We have observed no difference in phenotypes between animals age synchronized by starving for 24 h vs. 48 h. Worm lysate preparation Wash the day 1 adult animals off of the plates with 10 ml of M9 into individual 15-ml centrifuge tubes using glass Pasteur pipettes. Add another 5 ml of M9 to each tube and allow worms to sediment gravitationally on the bench for ~10 min (to reduce the sedimentation of OP50). Aspirate out as much of the M9 with OP50 without compromising the worm ‘pellet’ as possible, retaining approximately 0.5-1 ml of worm slurry. Add more M9 to the tube to bring up the volume back to 15 ml and repeat three more times to remove as much of the OP50 containing M9 as possible. Spin the animals down for a minute at 6,180 x g and aspirate to retain just the worm pellet. Add 15 ml of 1x PBS to each tube, mix to disperse the worm pellet and then spin down for 3 min at 6,180 x g. Aspirate out this PBS and resuspend the worm pellet in a fresh 100 μl of PBS. Move the nematodes in PBS to 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes and place them at -80 °C for 15 min to freeze crack the animals. Place the tubes in a bucket of ice and sonicate each tube for 10 sec on ice at continuous operation with the power set to 3 on the dismembrator.",
    "Spin the sonicated mixture down at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate the worm lysate from the worm carcass pellet. Save as much of the worm lysate (~100 μl) as possible from each tube. Use 10 μl of each worm lysate sample to determine the protein concentration using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) following manufacturer’s instructions. (On average, you should have about 100 μg of protein per 100 μl of lysate.) Determine the volume of lysate needed for 25 μg of protein for each sample. Add this volume to a new tube and bring up all the samples to 50 µl by adding an appropriate volume of PBS. Chloromethyl-H2DCFDA dye preparation and Fluorescence measurementDissolve each tube of 50 μg of Chloromethyl-H2DCFDA in 45 µl of DMSO.Dilute this further with 300 µl of PBS to obtain 250 μM of Chloromethyl-H2DCFDA.Incubate the 50 µl lysates containing 25 μg of protein or no worm control (PBS) with 100 μl of 250 μM of Chloromethyl-H2DCFDA in PBS in triplicate at 37 °C for 4 h. The total volume of the reaction mixture with lysate and dye will be 150 μl. Discard any dye solution not used to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.Measure fluorescence intensity using a Flex Station 3 Reader (Molecular Devices) at an excitation of 485 nm and emission of 535 nm. Perform 3 separate biological replicates. Note: Worm lysates for ROS measurement cannot be frozen for future use."
