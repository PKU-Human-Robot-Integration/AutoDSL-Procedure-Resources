    "Experimental planningCell line selectionGenerally, the experiment will be the most convenient if the starting cell line is heterozygous at the desired SNP site to be edited. In this way, we can synthesise two single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs), each carrying a different genotype, and perform two separate SNP editing experiments simultaneously, thereby obtaining edited homozygous cell lines in both allele directions at the end of the experiment (Figure 1A). It is also possible to obtain homozygous cell lines of the opposing genotype by starting from a homozygous cell line when the circumstances do not allow a high degree of freedom, such as using cell lines derived from clinically diagnosed patients (Figure 1B). In such cases, it would be beneficial to increase the number of clones picked in Sections E and F to maximize the chance of detecting a positive one. Whilst there would be a chance that one of the genotypes (heterozygous or homozygous of the opposite genotype) does not appear in the first round of CRISPR/Cas9 editing, obtaining the homozygous cell line of the opposite genotype is usually sufficiently satisfactory for the purpose of the experiment. Alternatively, a heterozygous line obtained from the first round of editing can be used for another round of CRISPR/Cas9 editing with the same ssODN to obtain a homozygous line of the opposite genotype. In all cases, the genotype of the starting cell line at the desired SNP site needs confirmation before proceeding to Section B. To confirm the genotype at the specific SNP site, use 30 ng genomic DNA extracted from the starting cell line and perform Sanger sequencing by proceeding with Steps E4-E5. Alternatively, online databases, next-sequencing results, or cell line-associated patient metadata may also provide genotype information at the SNP site to be edited.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4051/bioprotoc-11-12-4051-g001.jpgFigure 1.",
    "SNP editing strategies using SNP site rs2027349 as an example. A. SNP editing starting from a heterozygous cell line. Two ssODNs carrying both alleles at the SNP site (A/T) are used to edit the heterozygous line (top) to the opposite direction and generate two homozygous cell lines of different genotypes (middle). Cells that have CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage events but not ssODN integration show the presence of indels in the form of two overlapping peak sets proximal to the target site (bottom). B. SNP editing starting from a homozygous cell line. Only one ssODN carrying the alternative allele (T) is required to generate both the heterozygous (middle-left) and homozygous (middle-right) cell line of the opposite genotype. Note that the chance of obtaining the edited homozygous cell clones is significantly lower than that of the heterozygous one.Technical requirements. The overall experiment incorporates three main parts: plasmid cloning and preparation; iPSC maintenance, transfection, and subcloning; and Sanger sequencing. Whilst it is desirable that one operator be acquainted with all these skills, this protocol has been designed to work as a collaboration project with several members, each with their own specialization.gRNA design and vector preparationUse dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/]) or any genome browser to fetch the DNA sequence proximal to the target SNP for gRNA design. Generally, the sequence will extend 65 bp both upstream and downstream of the target SNP, for a total of 131 bp. Save the sequence as it will be used to synthesise the ssODN with homology arms flanking the target SNP site. This sequence will also be used in a gRNA design tool such as Benchling (https://www.benchling.com[href=https://www.benchling.com]) to generate the gRNA sequence (20 bp) for the introduction of a double-strand break (DSB). Pick the gRNA with the highest efficiency score while maintaining a reasonable specificity score.",
    "It is also found that gRNA sequences with a cleavage site proximal to the target SNP location may have better recombination efficiency (see Figure 2 for the schematic figure as well as an output example from Benchling for the gRNA and ssODN used to edit SNP rs2027349). In the meantime, design a pair of PCR primers covering the target SNP using Primer3 (http://primer3.ut.ee/[href=http://primer3.ut.ee/]) or similar online tools. The PCR product should be 400-600 bp in size, and the SNP is at least 150 bp from either end of the product.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4051/bioprotoc-11-12-4051-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Transformation of competent cells. We recommend the use of RecA- E. coli strains such as Invitrogen Stbl3 (recA13) or NEB Stable (recA1), since the inserted gRNA and its associated gRNA scaffold may include unstable sequences. As a guideline, use 2 μl product from Step A3e per transformation (include a negative control) following the vendor’s instructions. After heat shock, it is necessary to add recovery media (such as SOC or NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium) at 32°C for 1 h with shaking before spreading on LB/Amp+ agar plates, since the amount of initial DNA input is low.Incubate at 32°C for 16 h and check for colonies the next day. A large number of colonies on the negative control plate usually suggests that the BbsI digestion did not work. Pick 4-6 colonies from the plate with annealed oligos added and inoculate 4 ml LB/Amp+ media with each colony. Use a new LB/Amp+ agar plate to record all the inoculated colonies and their corresponding tube numbers. Incubate at 37°C overnight.Isolate plasmid DNA using spin columns such as those from a Qiagen QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and send for sequencing using the U6-Forward primer to identify positive clones. In the meantime, keep the record plate from Step A3g at 4°C until all the positive clones have been identified by sequencing.Inoculate 250 ml LB/Amp+ with the colonies of positive clones from the record plate to prepare transfection-grade plasmid. Culture and extract the plasmid using a Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit to ensure complete removal of endotoxins according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Dilute the purified plasmid to 1 μg/μl or appropriate in endo-free TE buffer (provided in the maxi-prep kit) as 50-μl aliquots and store at -20°C until use.Maintenance of human iPSCs for editingGrow healthy undifferentiated human iPSCs in 6-well plates coated with Matrigel.",
    "Generally, for each well of the 6-well plate, use 2 ml mTeSR1 culture media and replace every 24 h. Observe the colony morphology every day and watch for signs of differentiation.Pass the cultured iPS cells when confluency reaches 60-70% (approximately 4-7 d). Dissociate colonies from the old plates by treating each well with 1 ml ReLeSR and incubating for 3-5 min with the plate lid on according to the technical manual. Dilute the dissociated cell aggregates and transfer 1/10-1/20 of the cells to a new well pre-coated with Matrigel in 2 ml mTeSR1. For details, please refer to Section 3 of the Technical Manual: Maintenance of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in mTeSRTM1, StemCell Technologies TM (https://www.stemcell.com/media/files/manual/10000005505-Maintenance_of_Human_Pluripotent_Stem_Cells_mTeSR1.pdf[href=https://www.stemcell.com/media/files/manual/10000005505-Maintenance_of_Human_Pluripotent_Stem_Cells_mTeSR1.pdf]).Transfect human iPSCs with the gRNA-integrated Cas9 vector and ssODN for precise gene editing.Seed iPSCs in 60-mm Petri dishes for transfection.As a guideline, each well of the 6-well plate at 60-70% confluence has approximately 1 × 106 iPSCs. On the other hand, each 60-mm Petri dish requires 4 × 105-5 × 105 iPSCs for seeding. Multiply the total number of iPSC wells for seeding by 1.2 to compensate for loss during collection and counting.Prepare enough 60-mm cell culture grade Petri dishes coated with Matrigel for iPSC seeding. Generally, prepare one Petri dish for each clone that will be generated, plus one dish for transfection efficiency evaluation.When iPSCs in 6-well plates reach a confluence of 60-70%, calculate the number of iPSCs required for transfection. Check cell morphology and manually scrape off any differentiated colonies under a stereomicroscope before dissociation. Do not use a culture with more than 20% of the colonies with signs of differentiation. Remove culture media from the plates and add 1 ml Accutase per well. Place the plates back into the incubator and wait for 10 min to dissociate cells.",
    "After 10 min, add 1 ml room-temp mTeSR to each well of the 6-well plate. Smack the plate against the palm to dislodge any remaining cells from the bottom gently without spilling media. Collect media from all wells into a 15-ml sterile Falcon tube and gently pipet up and down 5-7 times using a regular 1-ml tip or glass pipette to mix well and break up the clumps.Determine the cell density using either a hemocytometer or automatic cell counter such as a ThermoFisher Countess 3. The cell density at this stage should be approximately 3 × 105-6 × 105 cells/ml. In the meantime, keep the Falcon tube containing the cells at room temperature; do not place cells on ice. Calculate the total number of cells collected.Centrifuge the Falcon tube at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature to precipitate the cells. Carefully remove all media and add an equal volume of fresh mTeSR1. Resuspend the cell pellet using a wide-bore 1-ml tip or glass pipet. Centrifuge the cell suspension again at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature.Calculate the final volume of mTeSR1 required for seeding iPSCs into 60-mm Petri dishes, plus one dish for a transfection control. Each dish will need 4-5 × 105 cells suspended in 4 ml mTeSR1. Add the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 to a final concentration of 5 μM in the media to increase viability after replating. If multiple dishes (say, transfections) are required, it may be more convenient to transfer partially resuspended cells into a larger 50-ml Falcon tube and add more mTeSR1 after transfer. Remove all media from Step D1f and replace with mTeSR1 containing Y27632. Dilute the cells to the desired concentration and fill each 60-mm dish with 4 ml fully resuspended iPSCs as single cells.",

The concentration of puromycin used may need optimization on a cell line-specific basis since cell lines may have very different puromycin tolerance levels (ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 μg/μl). Incubate the dishes at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.Carefully remove media and any dead cells or cell debris from the dishes.

Incubate the dish at 37°C, 5% CO2 for another 24 h.Count several fields of view to assess the percentage of EGFP+ cells. The transfection efficiency, as calculated by the percentage of EGFP+ cells, should be at least 40-50%.Isolate individual iPSC colonies for genotype identification of positive clones.On the day of colony picking, prepare one flat-bottomed 96-well plate coated with Matrigel (referred to as Plate A). Add 80 μl mTeSR1 containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y27632 to each well of Plate A. Prepare another uncoated 96-well plate (referred to as Plate B, flat-bottomed wells).Replace the media in the 60-mm dish with fresh ROCK inhibitor-free mTeSR1.Set a P100 or P200 pipette at 50 μl. Attach a P200 tip and use the tip to scrape off a single colony. Aspirate the scraped-off colony or its fragments (if the colony breaks during the process) using the pipet and transfer all its contents (50 μl) to one well of Plate A. Gently pipet up and down 3 times to break the cell clump. Without replacing the pipet tip, transfer 50 μl from Plate A into the corresponding well of Plate B (Say, A1 well to A1 well, etc.) Repeat this step until all the colonies of interest on the 60-mm Petri dish have been picked up.Spin down both plates at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature with the lids on.Keep Plate A at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h to allow iPSCs to reattach to the well.

The expanded iPSCs will be used for further single-cell subcloning to obtain pure clones.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4051/bioprotoc-11-12-4051-g005.jpgFigure 5. Sample sequencing spectrums of good and bad quality. A. A good result, showing clear discrete peaks. B.",
    "A bad result, showing multiple overlapping peak sets, implying the presence of multiple PCR products in the sequencing input. C. A bad result, showing a very weak peak signal.When the colonies reach the proper size (1.5-2 mm in diameter or 60-70% confluence in the wells) in Plate A (from Step E3a), dissociate the iPSC colonies by firstly removing all media from the wells. Gently add 50 μl ReLeSR to each well, aspirate out quickly, and stand for 5 min at room temperature.Add 100 μl mTeSR1 to each well and carefully dislodge the cell clumps from the bottom of the well by tapping the plate and scraping using a regular P200 pipet tip. Transfer the contents of each well into one well of a Matrigel-coated 4-well or 24-well plate and add mTeSR1 containing 5 μM ROCK inhibitor to a final volume of 500 μl. Continue culture at 37°C, 5% CO2 in an incubator with daily refreshing of mTeSR1 until the cells reach 60-70% confluence in the wells.Single-cell subcloning to obtain pure isogenic lines.Carefully remove media from the wells and subsequently add 400 μl Accutase per well for 10 min to dissociate the cells from the bottom. Gently pipet up and down 5 times using a P1000 tip to make a single-cell suspension and then add another 400 μl mTeSR1 to neutralize the Accutase. Take 10 μl suspension to count the cell density using the trypan blue method and centrifuge the remaining cells at 250 × g for 5 min.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 ml mTeSR1 containing 5 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Isolate the volume equivalent to 2000 live cells (as determined in the previous step) and replate into a 60-mm Matrigel-coated dish in 4 ml mTeSR1 containing 5 μM ROCK inhibitor Y27632.",
    "Continue to culture any remaining cells in 4/24-well plates as backups. Continue culture at 37°C, 5% CO2.Replace half the media in the 60-mm dish with ROCK inhibitor-free mTeSR1 48 h post replating. Continue culture at 37°C, 5% CO2 in an incubator with daily refreshing of mTeSR1 until the colony size reaches 1.5-2 mm in diameter. Repeat the colony picking procedure as described under Step E3. Pick approximately 30 colonies from each 60-mm dish. Repeat the genotyping procedure for the selected colonies as described under Steps E4-E5.Once pure clones have been identified by Sanger sequencing, repeat Step F1 to transfer each colony from the 96-well plates to 2 (!) wells of the Matrigel-coated 4/24-well plates until the confluence reaches 60-70%. Continue to monitor the cell growth as different clones may have different growth speed at this stage.Remove media from the wells and add 400 μl ReLeSR to each well. Remove ReLeSR from the wells and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Coat enough 6-well plates with Matrigel and add 2 ml mTeSR1 per well. Add 300 μl mTeSR1 to each well of the 4/24-well plate treated with ReLeSR and gently pipet up and down 5 times using a wide-bore pipet tip to dissociate the cell clumps. Aliquot 100 μl cell clump suspension to each well of the 6-well plate (3 wells in total) and gently shake to mix. Prepare 4-6 wells for each clone. Continue to incubate until the confluence reaches 60-70%.Freezing cell lines for cryopreservation.Closely observe the cell growth in 6-well plates until the confluence reaches 60-70%. It is recommended that all wells on the same plate be processed in one run.Add 1 ml ReLeSR per well of the 6-well plate. Remove ReLeSR from the wells and incubate for 3-5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 in an incubator.",
    "Add 1 ml room temperature mTeSR1 per well of the 6-well plate treated with ReLeSR and dislodge the cells by tapping the plate firmly. Transfer the dislodged cell suspension to a sterile 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature.Carefully remove as much supernatant as possible without touching the cell pellet at the bottom. Add 1 ml room temperature mFreSR to the Eppendorf tube and carefully resuspend the cell pellet using a wide-bore pipet tip by pipetting up and down 5 times. Transfer the tube contents to a pre-labeled cryovial tube. Confirm the tube is firmly sealed and place it in a Mr Frosty Freezing Container. Generally, prepare as many tubes (usually 4-6 tubes as determined in Steps F2d-F2f) as possible for each clone. Repeat this step until all the cells have been transferred to cryovials.Place the Mr Frosty Freezing Container containing cryovials in a -80°C freezer for at least 24 h (but no longer than 72 h) to freeze the contents. Move all the vials to liquid N2 for long-term storage. Keep detailed records."
