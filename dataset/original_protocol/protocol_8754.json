    "Follow the institutional guidelines for animal care for surgical tool sterilization, and modify the protocol as necessary to comply with the guidelines and obtain approval by your institution’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Surgical Preparation\nClean and prepare the transmitter to ensure safe and sterile surgery. Remove the transmitter from its anti-static packaging and either spray or soak in 70% ethanol. Rinse transmitter with sterile saline and place between sterile cotton sponges soaked in sterile saline or keep submerged in sterile saline.\nCollect and sterilize the tools required for surgery; steam autoclave for sterilization. See table of materials and reagents for the list of surgical tools.\n2. Surgical Implantation\nAnesthetize animal and maintain anesthesia according to IACUC-approved protocol. At initiation and during surgery check the toe-pinch reflex every 15 min. The lack of response indicates sufficient level of anesthesia.\n\t\nFor pups, use anesthesia by isoflurane (4%) with O2 (100%). For adults, use ketamine (100 mg/kg) with xylazine (10 mg/kg).\nFix position in stereotaxic frame. Place the ear bar tips in the auditory meatus. Do not excessively tighten ear bars as the skull is very soft in young rat pups. Secure the anesthesia nose cone.\n\t\nKeep the animal warm during surgery by placing it on the heating pad set to 37 °C. In adult animals, apply lubricating ointment to the eyes of the animal.\nSterilize incision site and maintain sterile surgical field.\n\t\nSwab the scalp with alternating applications of 70% ethanol and betadine. Start in the center of the scalp and make increasingly wider concentric circles.\nCover the animal with drape and conduct the surgery over draped animal. Maintain the sterile surgical field by lining the surgical set-up with sterile drapes, spray equipment with 70% ethanol.",
    "Wear sterile surgical gloves and gown (or as required by the institution). To help maintain sterile field, use a surgical assistant.\nMake an incision on the scalp of the animal slightly behind the eyes along the midline, approximately 2 cm. Use caution when inserting the scalpel as the skull is still very soft in young rat pups. Make a single cut so the incision bleeds less, and heals faster.\nExpose the skull. Prepare a clean and dry area to maximize the bond between the transmitter and the bones of the skull. Use aneurism clips to grasp scalp.\n\t\nGently pull scalp away from midline at four corners. Look for anatomical landmarks such as bregma and lambda in the skull. Remember skull bones are not fused in animals at this age. Use the Paxinos atlas of stereotaxic coordinates to find the correct location for the burr hole.\nUse a Dremel-type tool with a burr-type drill bit. Create two burr holes in desired recording positions with the holes being bigger than 300 µm in diameter. Place the burr hole for the reference electrode over the cerebellum behind the lambda of the skull.\nEnsure that the wires on the transmitter are aligned with the burr holes. If the electrode wires are not aligned, glue contamination of the electrodes is likely, and will result in poor signal. To align the wires, check the fit of the transmitter and gently bend electrodes to line up over the intended sites for burr holes.\nTrim electrode leads. Use surgical scissors to trim the electrodes to the desired length. The electrode depth is important for the type of recording required for the experiment (i.e., place the electrodes above dura for EEG recordings, or use stereotaxic coordinates for defined brain structures).",
    "Liberally apply cyanoacrylate on the base of the transmitter to cover the area making sure to avoid coating the electrodes. Cyanoacrylate glue is an electrical insulator, contaminating electrodes with glue will result in no signal.\n\t\nIf recording from deep brain structures, mount the transmitter on the cannula holder and place it in the stereotaxic arm for z-axis control. Lower the transmitter using the stereotaxic arm to appropriate depth and place cyanoacrylate gel around the transmitter.\nThoroughly dry skull before placing transmitter to ensure strong adhesive bond. Apply transmitter coated with cyanoacrylate to the skull. Take care to align electrodes with corresponding burr holes.\n\t\nTry to avoid damaging major vascular structures. Hold the transmitter in place with slight pressure for one minute. Use slight pressure to form a strong bond between the transmitter and the skull.\nApply additional cyanoacrylate, enough to completely seal transmitter/skull interface. To ensure a good fit and strong bond, maximize the surface area of the glue that contacts the skull. Apply the cyanoacrylate adhesive in a circle around the transmitter, making sure both skull and the wall of the transmitter are covered.\nApply chemical accelerant (0.1 ml) through a syringe around the cyanoacrylate at the base of the implanted transmitter. Use accelerant sparingly, taking care not to apply to adjacent tissue.\n\tNote: Chemical acceleration of the cyanoacrylate curing ensures that the strong bond between the transmitter and the skull is formed quickly. Cyanoacrylate accelerant is useful to speed curing of adhesive, but is not necessary.",
    "Remove the accelerant by washing the area thoroughly with sterile saline. Cyanoacrylate accelerator may cause tissue irritation if not washed from the area of the incision. To wash the area, fill a 1.0 ml syringe with sterile saline and irrigate the area through a syringe needle. Generally 0.5 ml of saline is enough to wash out the accelerator.\nSuture the skin around the base of the transmitter, but do not cover the transmitter. Top of transmitter must be above skin to efficiently transmit neural signals. Skin should be reasonably tight around the transmitter and the glue around the unit. Use Vicryl or silk suture (soft thread); skin in immature animals is soft and is easily damaged if soft sutures are not used. For adult animals, use any suturing material.\nRemove animal from stereotaxic frame and place on heated blanket for recovery.\nEnsure animals are warm (37 °C) and ambulatory (i.e., completely recovered) before returning to the dam. Ensure that the animal is hydrated by pinching the skin on the animal’s back (if the animal is dehydrated, the skin will remain deformed). If animal is dehydrated, administer sub-cutaneous injection of lactated Ringer’s buffer. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n\t\nAdminister buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) to animals for post-surgical pain management and a sub-cutaneous injection of 0.1 ml bupivacaine around the injection site.\n\t\tNote: From start to finish the entire procedure should be completed in 5-10 min for animals of this age (postnatal day 6). Surgical time may take longer for older animals.\n3. Care and Housing",
    "Note: Some dams may not tolerate pups implanted with the device. Dams may need to be selected who are tolerant. It is acceptable for the dam to move pups around the cage by picking them up by the transmitter.\nOnce animals are weaned, singly-house them to avoid the removal of the devices from their cage mate.\nEuthanize animals by lethal dose of pentobarbital (25 mg/kg) or isoflurane (in a bell jar) when signs of distress are present.\nNote, some animal housing cages with wire inserts may interfere with the implanted transmitters.  Be sure to check the height of the wire insert to make sure that animals cannot get the transmitter caught between the ‘bars’ of the wire insert.  Consult your veterinarian for help.\n4. Recording EEG\nPlace the animal in a cage by itself or co-housed with littermates and the dam. However, place only one implanted animal in a single cage. Do not leave pups alone in the recording chamber for more than 2 hr. Monitor the animals for signs of distress and dehydration.\nConnect the provided power supply to the receiver base and verify the power light is illuminated. Connect the receiver base to a data acquisition system using (Bayonet Neil-Concelman) BNC cables.\nPlace the animal cage on top of the receiver base (Figure 2). The “signal” light should illuminate indicating a transmitter has been detected. Data may now be recorded.\nTo record data, connect the receiver base to an analogue-to-digital converter and connect the converter to a computer (Figure 1).\nSet the sampling rate of the recording. Ensure the data is sampled properly. Select at least 250 Hz sampling rate (500 Hz recommended) for recording (bandwidth of the transmitter is 0.1-100 Hz).\nSave digitized data and analyze using signal-processing software packages such as Matlab.",
    "5. EEG Analysis - General\nPerform FFTs (fast Fourier transforms) to transform temporal EEG data to the frequency domain from 0-100 Hz.\nPerform an estimate of power spectral densities (PSDs) from the FFT using 256 Hann-window segments based on the Welch method and normalized by 10 x log10(PSD). Power spectra show the specific frequencies that dominate the EEG signal over the desired time period.\nGroup data across animals by taking the mean of the PSD from each animal over time-matched treatments. Create 95% confidence intervals by 1.96 x mean(PSD)/square root (n) where n is the number of animals (PSD traces). Plot the mean and 95% confidence intervals of the data to generate a quantitative report of the entire frequency content of the EEG across cohorts of animals such as comparing treated groups vs. control groups.\n6. Perinatal Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) Model Protocol\nAnesthetize the P6 - 7 rat pup using isoflurane anesthesia (4% with 100% O2) by placing the animal in an anesthesia box (box with input from anesthesia vaporizer). At initiation and during surgery check the toe-pinch reflex every 15 min. The lack of response indicates sufficient level of anesthesia.\nPlace the pup on its back, expose the neck and scrub with alternating applications of 70% ethanol and 10% betadine. Repeat the ethanol/betadine scrub 3 times.\nMake a 1 cm incision in the skin of the neck with scissors at the midline of the neck. Lift the skin with forceps and make the cut with scissors. Take care not to cut the muscle tissue when making the incision.",
    "Use blunt dissection technique to expose carotid artery. To perform blunt dissection, use two pairs of blunt-nose forceps. Insert the tips into the tissue and let the spring action of the surgical instrument spread the tissue. Repeat until carotid artery is exposed. Identify the carotid artery by a bright red color and the presence of visible pulse.\nSeparate carotid artery from the vagus nerve using blunt forceps. Insert the blunt-tipped forceps between the artery and the nerve. Release the forceps and let spring action of the tool separate the carotid from the vagus nerve.\nPlace aneurism clamps 4-5 mm apart on the carotid artery. Take care to not damage the artery with the clamps by avoiding rapid movements.\nCauterize the carotid artery between the aneurism clamps. To cauterize the artery, touch the artery between the clamps with a hot cauterizer tip. After the artery is cut, ensure both ends are properly cauterized to avoid hemorrhage.\nRemove the clamps, close the neck incision with 3 sutures. Only suture the skin, take care not to suture the muscle tissue.\nAllow the animal to recover for 1 hr. Monitor the animal’s breathing and bleeding from the neck. If bleeding is present, do not subject the animal to HI (step 6.10).\nPlace the animal in a temperature controlled chamber at 37 °C and continuously introduce 8% O2 / 92% N2 mixture into the chamber for 2 hr."
