    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEnrichment of MNCs from UCB\nTiming: 2 h\nUCB MNCs are isolated with Ficoll Paque Plus by density gradient centrifugation. Usually, about 2 × 108 UCB MNCs can be isolated from 100 mL fresh UCB samples.\nAlternatives: In this protocol, fresh human UCB is used as the source of MNCs and CD34+ HSPCs. Other sample types that also contain CD34+ HSPCS, such as bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB), may be used to replace cord blood. The percentage of hematopoietic progenitor cells is about 0.1%–1% in UCB, 0.5%–5% in BM, and 0.05%–0.2% in PB.\nDisinfect the UCB bag with 70% ethanol and cut the end of tubing to allow UCB flow into a 50 mL tube.\nCritical: We recommend utilizing fresh UCB samples. The UCB samples should be kept at 4°C prior to isolation.\nDilute 1 volume of UCB with 3 volumes of isolation buffer. For example, dilute 10 mL UCB with 30 mL isolation buffer.\nNote: The yield and purity of UCB MNCs depend largely on the removal efficiency of erythrocytes. When erythrocytes aggregate and form clumps in cord blood, some UCB MNCs can be trapped in the clumps, leading to their co-sedimentation with the erythrocytes and consequently a low yield of UCB MNCs. This tendency to trap UCB MNCs can be reduced by dilution of the cord blood sample, which decreases the size of erythrocyte clumps and gives a better yield of UCB MNCs.",
    "Add 15 mL Ficoll Paque Plus to a new 50 mL tube, and slowly layer the diluted cord blood on top of Ficoll Paque Plus while holding the tube in a tilt position. Take care not to disturb the interface between Ficoll Paque Plus media and the diluted cord blood; do not mix Ficoll Paque Plus with the sample (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The technique for layering sample on top of Ficoll Paque Plus is demonstrated in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/727-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of UCB MNCs from human cord blood samples\n(A) Fresh UCB sample diluted with isolation buffer was layered onto Ficoll Paque Plus without disturbing the interface.\n(B) Separation of the four fractions after density gradient centrifugation. From top to bottom: plasma + platelets, UCB MNCs, Ficoll Paque Plus, and granulocytes + erythrocytes.\n(C) Assembly of the MACS MS column with the MACS Separator and the MACS MultiStand.\nSee also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nConduct density gradient centrifugation in a centrifuge with swinging bucket rotor without brake at 400 × g for 35 min at 20°C.\nCritical: Keep the temperature at 18°C–20°C during the centrifugation to ensure the yield, purity, and viability of UCB MNCs. As mentioned previously, the efficiency of erythrocyte removal significantly affects the yield and purity of UCB MNCs. Erythrocyte aggregation is enhanced at higher temperatures (37°C), which causes the decrease of UCB MNC yield. In addition, the cell viability of UCB MNCs will be decreased at higher temperatures. Although the erythrocyte aggregation is alleviated at lower temperatures (4°C), the time needed for separation is increased, which also lowers the yield of UCB MNCs. Therefore, the compromise temperature of 18°C–20°C gives optimal results. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]",
    "Remove the upper layer (this fraction contains plasma and platelets and may be saved for later use if needed; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and leave the mononuclear cell layer undisturbed at the interface.\nUse a sterile pipette to transfer the layer of UCB MNCs to a new 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nFill the centrifuge tube with isolation buffer to wash the cells. The volume of isolation buffer should be at least 3 times of that of the transferred mononuclear cells. For example, add at least 3 mL of isolation buffer to 1 mL of transferred mononuclear cells.\nSuspend the cells in isolation buffer and centrifuge with break on at 300 × g for 10 min at 20°C.\nCritical: Observe the cell suspension under the microscope with a hemocytometer before centrifugation to make sure most mononuclear cells have been transferred. If very few mononuclear cells can be observed, double-check the original tube containing the Ficoll Paque Plus and the cord blood sample to confirm if the mononuclear cell layer at the interface has been completely transferred. However, it is also important to keep in mind that excessive transfer of the supernatant can cause platelet contamination and excessive transfer of Ficoll Paque Plus media will cause granulocyte contamination.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 50 mL isolation buffer. Count the cells with a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter. Centrifuge with break on at 300 × g for 10 min at 20°C to wash cells.\nNote: Although centrifugation at a higher speed can increase the mononuclear cell recovery, a lower centrifugation speed (60–100 × g) is recommended when it is critical to get rid of platelets.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant completely and resuspend up to 108 cells in 300 μL cold (4°C) MACS buffer. Proceed to isolation of CD34+ HSPCs.",
    "Note: If more than 108 cells are used for isolation of CD34+ HSPCs, scale up the buffer volume accordingly. For example, use 600 μL MACS buffer to resuspend up to 2 × 108 cells.\nOptional: If the total number of UCB MNCs is greater than that needed for isolation of CD34+ HSPCs, the extra cells may be cryopreserved at a density of 10–50 × 106 cells per mL of freezing media at −80°C (for up to 1 month) or in liquid nitrogen (for long-term storage).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. The technique of layering diluted cord blood sample on top of Ficoll Paque Plus and not disturbing the interface, related to Step 3\nIsolation of CD34+ HSPCs via positive immunomagnetic separation\nTiming: 2 h\nIsolation of CD34+ HSPCs from UCB MNCs is based on a magnetic labeling-separation method. CD34 antibody-conjugated MicroBeads are used to magnetically label CD34-expressing cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells, endothelial progenitor cells, vascular endothelial cells, etc. (Dever et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: The reagent and total volumes given in the following steps are for isolation of up to 108 UCB MNCs. Scale up all volumes if more than 108 total cells are used for isolation of CD34+ HSPCs.\nCritical: To prevent non-specific cell labeling and antibody capping on the cell surface, use pre-cooled solutions, work quickly, and keep cells cold (2°C–8°C).\nFor up to 108 cells resuspended in 300 μL MACS buffer, add 100 μL FcR blocking reagent and 100 μL CD34 MicroBeads. Mix well and incubate at 2°C–8°C (in the refrigerator) for 30 min. During incubation, flick the bottom of the tube every 10 min to mix contents.",
    "Note: 2°C–8°C is the recommended incubation temperature and 30 min is the recommended incubation time. Non-specific cell labeling may be increased with higher temperatures and/or longer incubation times. If the incubation is conducted on ice, longer incubation times may be required.\nWash the cells by adding 5–10 mL MACS buffer and centrifuge with break on at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: Pre-cool the centrifuge to 4°C to keep cells cold.\nCompletely aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL MACS buffer.\nPlace a MS column in the magnetic field of a MACS Separator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) and rinse the column with 500 μL MACS buffer.\nNote: The MS column can be used to isolate up to 2 × 108 total cells and up to 107 labeled CD34+ cells. For larger cell numbers, choose another appropriate MACS Column and MACS Separator for isolation of CD34+ cells. For example, the LS column can be used to isolate up to 2 × 109 total cells and up to 108 CD34+ cells, and the XS column can be used to isolate up to 2 × 1010 total cells and up to 109 CD34+ cells. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for appropriate volumes to be used if other columns are chosen.\nAdd cell suspension onto the column and collect the flow-through. This cell fraction contains unlabeled cells that are CD34 negative and can be saved for later use if needed.\nWash the column with 500 μL MACS buffer. Collect the flow-through and combine with the unlabeled cells collected in step 15 if needed. Repeat the wash twice for a total of three washes.\nLabel a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with “CD34+ cells”, remove the column from the MACS separator and place it on the tube.",
    "Add 1 mL MACS buffer onto the column and immediately push the plunger firmly into the column to flush out the labeled CD34+ cells.\nOptional: The eluted fraction can be enriched over a second MS Column to improve the purity of isolated CD34+ cells. Repeat the magnetic separation procedure from steps 14–18 once by using a new column.\nOptional: The purity of the isolated hematopoietic progenitor cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The CD34 antibody used for direct immunofluorescent staining of the cells should recognize another epitope different from that recognized by QBEND/10, which is the CD34 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the magnetic beads. We use Anti-Human CD34 FITC (4H11) antibody from eBioscience in this protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/727-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Isolation of CD34+ HSPCs from UCB MNCs\nThe percentage of CD34+ cells was 0.36% in UCB MNCs, as tested in the sample used in this protocol. After immunomagnetic isolation of CD34+ HSPCs from UCB MNCs, the percentage of CD34+ cells was 90.1% in the isolated CD34+ HSPCs.\nPause Point: If the lentiviral particles are not ready or the number of CD34+ HSPCs isolated is not enough, the cells could be cultured in SFEM complete medium to expand for a few days (no longer than one week as the CD34+ HSPCs have a limited lifespan in culture) before the lentiviral transduction. The isolated CD34+ HSPCs could also be cryopreserved at −80°C for up to one month or in liquid nitrogen for up to one year, if not immediately used for lentiviral transduction and functional analysis. However, we recommend using freshly isolated CD34+ HSPCs for the downstream analysis to achieve optimal and reliable results.\nLentiviral transduction of CD34+ HSPCs\nTiming: 7–8 days\nDilute the RetroNectin stock solution (1 mg/mL) with sterilized PBS to achieve a concentration of 50 μg/mL.",
    "Dispense 1 mL of diluted RetroNectin solution (50 μg/mL) into each well of a non-treated 6-well plate with aseptic technique. Incubate overnight (∼18 h) at 4°C when coating the plate on the day prior to lentiviral transduction (or for at least 0.5 h at room temperature [20°C] when coating the plate on the same day of lentiviral transduction).\nNote: The coating efficiency of RetroNectin and especially the transduction efficiency could be reduced when using a tissue culture-treated plate. Hence, it is necessary to use non-treated culture vessels for RetroNectin coating and lentiviral transduction.\nAspirate the RetroNectin solution and block the plate with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution for 30 min at room temperature (20°C) to reduce non-specific protein-protein interactions.\nRemove the BSA solution and add 2 mL of PBS to each well to wash the plate. Remove PBS but do not allow the plate to dry. The RetroNectin-coated plate is now ready to be used for infection.\nNote: If not used immediately, the RetroNectin-coated plate can be stored at 4°C for up to one week.\nAdd 1 mL of lentiviral supernatants prepared in steps 1–4 of the “Before You Begin” section to each well of the RetroNectin-coated plate. In this protocol, we add lentiviral supernatants of shNS, shFTO-1, and shFTO-2 into three wells of the 6-well plate.\nCentrifuge the plate at 2000 × g for 2.5 h at 32°C. Remove the lentiviral supernatant from the plate. Do not allow the plate to dry.\nCritical: The removed lentiviral supernatants still contain a large amount of lentiviruses and need to be treated with 10% bleach for at least 30 min prior to disposal.",
    "Pipette 1 × 106 CD34+ HSPCs in 2 mL SFEM complete medium into each well of the plate. Add polybrene to each well to a final concentration of 4 μg/mL. Centrifuge the plate with break on at 600 × g for 10 min at 32°C, and incubate for 48 h in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nAt 48 h post lentiviral transduction, change medium for the transduced cells and add puromycin to the cells to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL. Culture the cells in presence of puromycin for 3–4 days to select successfully-transduced CD34+ HSPCs.\nUse ∼1 × 106 transduced cells from each group to conduct protein extraction and Western Blot (or RNA extraction and RT-qPCR) to validate that the target gene expression has been efficiently knocked down. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nNote: At the time of Glycolytic Rate Assay, the cells have been cultured ex vivo for about one week and the percentage of CD34 expression will not be as high as freshly isolated CD34+ HSPCs. This protocol aims to evaluate the effects of shRNA-mediated FTO knockdown on glycolytic activity in normal healthy hematopoietic cells, as compared to its effects in leukemic cells. Thus, the expansion and potential differentiation of CD34+ HSPCs do not have significant impact on the results. However, if it is critical to keep high purity of CD34+ cells for the analysis, the cell culture condition should be further optimized to maintain the stemness and CD34+ expression of the cells (Jiang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nAnalysis of glycolytic activity in lentivirally transduced CD34+ HSPCs\nTiming: 2 days",
    "The basal and compensatory glycolytic activity in CD34+ HSPCs transduced with shNS, shFTO-1, and shFTO-2 are measured by the Seahorse XF Glycolytic Rate Assay. The CD34+ HSPCs are more delicate than cell lines and therefore it is important to limit the operation time to a minimum (within 2 h from steps 36–45b) to maintain the viability of CD34+ HSPCs. It is recommended to familiarize yourself with this assay using leukemia cell lines before conducting it with CD34+ HSPCs.\nOn the day prior to the Glycolytic Rate Assay, unpack a Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridge set in the cell culture hood, disassemble the sensor cartridge from the utility plate, and place the sensor cartridge upside down as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/727-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Hydration of sensor cartridge and a typical plate map of Glycolytic Rate Assay\n(A) (Top) Image of the Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridge set with its lid, sensor cartridge, and utility plate labeled. (Bottom) When filling the utility plate with calibrant to hydrate the sensor cartridge, put the sensor cartridge with the lid upside down to avoid sensors touching work surface.\n(B) A typical plate map with 8 wells in a row assigned to each experimental group in the Glycolytic Rate Assay. Similarly, a row of 8 wells are assigned to background control group and only assay medium without cells will be added to these wells.\nFill each well of the utility plate with 200 μL Seahorse XF calibrant solution. Put the sensor cartridge onto the utility plate and make sure sensors of the cartridge are completely submerged in the calibrant solution.\nHydrate the assembled sensor cartridge at 37°C in a non-CO2 incubator overnight (∼18 h). To prevent evaporation of the calibrant, verify that the incubator is properly humidified. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]",
    "Turn on the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer, open the “Wave” software, and select “Heater on” (with the temperature set at 37°C) to allow the temperature to stabilize.\nOn the day of the assay, dilute Cell-Tak stock solution with 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 22.4 μg/mL.\nNote: The stock concentrations of Cell-Tak vary lot-to-lot; refer to the package for the exact concentration. For one Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate, prepare 3 mL of diluted Cell-Tak solution.\nNote: The optimal final pH of the diluted Cell-Tak solution is between 6.5 and 8.0. Once diluted into the neutral buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.0), apply to coat each well of the cell culture microplate within 10 min as adsorption begins immediately upon pH changing.\nApply 25 μL of the diluted Cell-Tak solution to each well of a Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate and let stand for at least 20 min at room temperature (20°C) to allow adsorption.\nAspirate the solution and wash each well twice with 200 μL sterile water.\nAlternatives: The Seahorse XF96 cell culture microplate can be coated on the day of the Glycolytic Rate Assay and used immediately after coating. Alternatively, follow steps 32–34 to coat the plate in advance and store the coated plate at 4°C for up to one week before using it in the assay. Warm the coated plate to room temperature (20°C) before cell seeding.\nPrepare the assay medium by supplementing the Seahorse XF RPMI medium (pH 7.4, with 1 mM HEPES) with 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate and 4 mM HEPES (to obtain a final concentration of 5 mM HEPES). Warm the assay medium to 37°C in a water bath.",
    "Alternatives: The Seahorse XF RPMI medium can be replaced with other Seahorse XF medium without phenol red, such as the Seahorse XF DMEM medium (pH 7.4, Cat#103575-100). Choose the most appropriate medium for the cells used in the assay (please check other options here: https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-assay-kits-reagents-cell-assay-media/seahorse-xf-media-supplements-calibrant-740890[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-assay-kits-reagents-cell-assay-media/seahorse-xf-media-supplements-calibrant-740890]).\nCount each group of the lentivirally transduced CD34+ HSPCs three times with an automated cell counter. Use the average cell number to calculate the volume needed to transfer 1.0 × 106 cells of each group to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCritical: It is important to count the cell number of each group accurately to ensure that same number of cells from different groups are seeded per well. Count each group three times to minimize cell counting errors.\nPellet cells at 300 × g with break on for 10 min at room temperature (20°C) and resuspend the cell pellet of each group in 1.8 mL warm assay medium.\nUsing an 8-channel multi-pipette and a sterile reagent reservoir, pipette 180 μL cell suspension to each sample well and 180 μL assay medium without cells to each background correction well of the Cell-Tak-coated XF96 cell culture microplate.\nNote: Keep an angle (∼45°) while pipetting so that the cells can evenly distribute and adhere to the well.\nNote: In this protocol, 8 wells in a row are assigned to each group as technical replicates to reduce measurement errors (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Similarly, 8 wells in a row are assigned as the background correction wells. It is recommended to keep at least 4 wells as technical replicates for each group to keep the measurement errors within the acceptable range.\nCentrifuge the plate with break on at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C). Ensure that the centrifuge is properly balanced.",
    "Note: Examine under a microscope to visually confirm adherence of the cells to the well bottom.\nPlace the cell culture plate in a regular incubator (37°C, with 5% CO2) until the sensor cartridge is loaded with the assay compounds and ready for calibration. It usually takes 10–30 min to load the sensor cartridge with the assay compounds (steps 41–43). Only place the cell culture plate in a non-CO2 incubator when the sensor cartridge is loaded and the calibration process of Seahorse Glycolytic Rate Assay is ready to be started (step 44). The cells need to be stabilized in the non-CO2 incubator for 30 min before being measured in the Glycolytic Rate Assay, which can be performed during the calibration process.\nCritical: Long-time incubation in a non-CO2 incubator will significantly diminish the cell viability of most leukemia cell lines and especially normal CD34+ HSPCs, leading to highly unreliable results. Therefore, only put the plate in the non-CO2 incubator once you are ready to start the calibration step, and incubate for exactly 30 min. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nOpen one foil pack from the Seahorse XF Glycolytic Rate Assay Kit and remove the Rotenone (Rot)/Antimycin A (AA) vial and the 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) vial. Tap down the vials to make sure the powder is on the tube bottom before opening the vials. Prepare the compound stock solutions with the assay medium according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Vortex for ∼1 min to ensure that compounds are completely dissolved.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_727_9.csv\nNote: Use compounds the same day they are reconstituted. It is not recommended to save the remaining compounds (at −20°C) because old compounds will not function the same as the freshly prepared ones and will cause a considerable increase in measurement errors.
