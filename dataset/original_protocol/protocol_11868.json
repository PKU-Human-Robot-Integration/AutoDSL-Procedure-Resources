    "Human ECFCs were isolated from human peripheral blood as described in a previous report27. Briefly, the mononuclear cell layer was separated from the whole blood using the Ficoll-Paque Plus, and cultured in the proper medium until the endothelial-like colonies were appeared. Colonies were collected and ECFCs were isolated using CD31-coated magnetic beads. MSCs were isolated from the adherent mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction of human adult bone marrow. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Duksung Women’s University (IRB No. 2017-002-01).\n1. Cell Culture\nPreparing ECFCs and MSCs medium and coat plates\nPrepare endothelial cell growth medium MV2 (ECGM-MV2, except hydrocortisone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin (GPS).\nPrepare mesenchymal stem cell growth medium-2 (MSCGM-2) containing 10% FBS and 1% GPS.\nFor ECFC culture, coat the cell culture plates with 1% gelatin solution. To prepare 1% gelatin solution, dissolve 1 g of gelation powder in 500 mL of PBS with the magnetic stirrer, and sterilize with autoclave. Plates can be coated with 3 mL/60 mm, 5 mL/100 mm, or 15 mL/150 mm of 1% gelatin solution. Incubate coated plates for 15 min in a cell culture incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2). After then, remove the remaining 1% gelatin solution by aspiration and wash the coated plates one time with PBS.\nGrowing ECFCs and MSCs\nSeed 1 x 106 ECFCs on 1% gelatin-coated 150 mm plates, and grow using ECGM-MV2 (10% FBS, 1% GPS) in a cell culture incubator (37°C and 5% CO2) to 80-90% confluency. Use ECFCs at passage numbers 7-10 to obtain consistent results.\nSeed 1 x 106 MSCs on non-coated 150 mm plates, and grow using MSCGM-2 in a cell culture incubator (37°C and 5% CO2) to 80-90% confluency. Use MSCs at passage numbers 7-10 to obtain consistent results.",
    "2. Preparation of 1.2% w/v Methylcellulose Solution\nMeasure 6 g of methyl cellulose in a 500 mL glass bottle and sterilize in an autoclave.\nHeat ECGM-MV2 (without FBS and GPS) at 60 °C for 20 min, and add 250 mL of heated ECGM-MV2 to sterilized methyl cellulose powder. To maintain sterile conditions, carry out the process inside the flow hood.\nAdd a sterilized magnetic stir bar and mix the solution for 20 min on the magnetic stirrer until the methyl cellulose is thoroughly wetted and evenly dispersed with no lumps. Add 250 mL of cold (4 °C) ECGM-MV2 (without FBS and GPS) under the sterile condition and mix for an additional 10 min on the magnetic stirrer. Then, chill the solution in a refrigerator (4 °C) overnight.\nNOTE: Methylcellulose is a carbohydrate polymer that dissolve well in cool temperatures due to swelling and subsequent hydration.\nThe next day, aliquot the solution in a 50 mL tube and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 3 h at 4 °C. Take the clear viscous supernatant solution and store at 4 °C until use for up to 3-6 months.\nNOTE: The sediment may contain residual cellulose fiber, so gently take the supernatant solution leaving behind at least 5 mL of volume. This volume can be adjusted according to experimental conditions.\n3. Generation and Embedding of ECFCs-only, MSCs-only, and ECFCs-MSCs Spheroids\nDay 1 \nPreparing ECFCs and MSCs cell suspension\nWash the 80-90% confluent ECFCs and MSCs by adding phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without calcium and magnesium, and aspirate.\nTo detach ECFCs and MSCs from the culture plate, incubate them with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 3 min and 5 min in a cell culture incubator (37°C and 5% CO2), respectively, in a cell culture incubator.",
    "Inactivate trypsin by adding DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% GPS. Pipette the cells up and down to create a single cell suspension.\nSediment the cells by centrifuging at 282 x g for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the supernatant, and re-suspend the cells in the respective medium.\nLabeling ECFCs and MSCs with fluorescent dye\nNOTE: Perform cell membrane labelling of ECFCs with PKH67 (green) and MSCs with PKH26 (red) fluorescent dye following the manufacturer’s instructions with slightly modifications as follows.\n\t\nWash the cells two times with serum free medium to remove FBS.\nNOTE: Proteins and lipids in FBS reduces the effective dye concentration for labelling cells by binding.\nCount ECFCs and MSCs using a hemocytometer under the microscope, and transfer 3 x 106 ECFCs and 2 x 106 MSCs into 2 mL micro-tubes.\nNOTE: These are the optimum cell densities for labelling cells with dyes. Use of a large number of cells causes poor and heterogeneous staining, whereas use of too few cells yields poor cells recovery.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 100 x g for 5 min at RT to obtain a cell pellet. Carefully aspirate the supernatant leaving no more than 15-25 µL of residual volume.\nRe-suspend ECFCs and MSCs in 250 µL of Diluent C from the dye kit. Gently pipette the cell suspension to ensure complete dispersion.\nNOTE: Diluent C is a physiologic salt, and may reduce the staining efficiency of dye by forming micelles. Therefore, do not let cells stand in diluent C for long, and do not vortex the tubes.",
    "Prepare the staining solution for ECFCs by adding 5 µL of PKH67 to 250 µL of Diluent C (final concentration of 20 µM) and for MSCs by adding 3 µL of PKH26 to 250 µL of Diluent C (final concentration of 12 µM ).\nNOTE: The final dye concentrations are different from the manufacturer’ recommendations. High concentration would lead to cell clumping and cell toxicity. Low concentration would not be sufficient for staining.\nAdd 250 µL of ECFCs cell suspension to 250 µL of PKH67 dye solution, and 250 µL of MSCs to 250 µL of PKH26 dye solution. Immediately mix the cells with dyes by pipetting up and down and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. For better results, cover the tube with aluminum foil and place on a shaker to ensure sufficient mixing during staining.\nStop the staining process by adding 0.5 mL of FBS to the stained cell suspension, and then incubate for 1 min to allow FBS to bind excess unbound dye. Sediment the stained cells by centrifuging at 100 x g for 5 min.\nNOTE: ECFCs and MSCs pellets are light yellow and pink, respectively, after staining.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and wash the cells two times with complete medium to remove excess dye. Centrifuge the tubes at 100 x g for 5 min and re-suspend the pellet in 2 mL of each complete medium.\nGenerating ECFC, MSC, or ECFC+MSC spheroids\nNOTE: Apply the hanging drop technique to generate spheroids as described previously28. The steps for the preparation of spheroids are given below.\n\t\nCount the stained ECFCs and MSCs.",
    "Suspend stained ECFCs, MSCs or ECFCs+MSCs in ECGM-MV2 containing 20% Methylcellulose solution and 5% FBS. Prepare at a cell density of 4 x 104 cells/mL for ECFCs or MSCs (25 µL of cell suspension contains 1,000 cells). For two cell suspension of ECFCs and MSCs, prepare at a cell density of 2 x 104 cells/mL ECFCs and 0.4 x 104 cell/mL MSCs (25 µL contains 500 ECFCs and 100 MSCs).\nNOTE: Ratio of ECFCs to MSCs should not exceed 5:1. A larger number of MSCs could lead to excessive migration and irregular sprout morphology. A smaller number of MSCs could cause poor interaction between cells, yielding poor sprouting.\nPrepare a hydration unit by adding 15 mL of PBS into the bottom of a 150 mm culture plate.\nTransfer the cell suspension into the sterilized polystyrene rectangular reservoir for the use of multichannel pipette. Disperse the cells suspension evenly by pipetting.\nDeposit 25 µL drops of cell suspension onto the cover of a 150 mm culture plate using a multi-channel pipette (approximately 100 drops/cover of the 150 mm plate). Invert the cover over a PBS-filled hydration unit and incubate in a cell culture incubator for 24 h.\nNOTE: Methylcellulose solution provides a proper viscosity to the suspension solution. When the hanging drop method was performed without methylcellulose solution, drops were easily slipped down when the cover was inverted (Supplemental Figure 1). Furthermore, after overnight incubation, the spheroids were not perfectly formed without methylcellulose solution. This result indicate that proper viscosity by methylcellulose solution is necessary to form round shape of the spheroids.\nDay 2\nEmbeding spheroids in neutralized collagen gel\nWarm FBS and ECGM-MV2 (without FBS and GPS) in a water bath (37 °C). Place cold methylcellulose solution on a work bench to bring to room temperature.",
    "Place a 24-well plate in a cell culture incubator (37 °C) for warming.\nCut the pointed 1 mL pipette tips 3-5 mm to aspirate spheroids and viscous suspensions, such as methylcellulose solution and type I collagen, comfortably and accurately.\nPrepare 3 mg/mL neutralized type I collagen gel on ice following the type I collagen gel manufacturer’s instruction.\nNOTE: Neutralization should be performed on ice to avoid gelation of collagen at room temperature. For one well of a 24-well plate, 500 µL of neutralized collagen is needed. Always prepare 1 mL extra volume of collagen. Collagen gel can be used up to 2-3 h after neutralization if kept on ice.\nHarvest the spheroids by rinsing the cover containing spheroids with 5 mL of PBS. Collect spheroid-suspended solution in a 50 mL conical tube. Re-rinse the cover with 5 mL of PBS to obtain the remaining spheroids.\nNOTE: During harvest, closely observe to confirm the existence of spheroids. For more visual inspection, transfer about 50-100 µL of spheroid-suspended solution on the slide glass, and check the round shape of the spheroids under the microscope.\nSediment the spheroids by centrifuging at 282 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant carefully without disturbing the spheroids leaving behind not more than 100-200 µL of residual volume.\nGently tap on the wall of the tube so that spheroids are freely suspended in the remaining 100-200 µL residual solution.\nAdd ECGM-MV2 containing 5% FBS and 40% methylcellulose solution to the spheroid-containing tube. The volume added is determined based on approximately 100 spheroids/mL. Gently mix the spheroid suspension by pipetting with a blunt 1 mL pipette tip.",
    "NOTE: Methylcellulose solution is widely used as a suspending agent that does not allow spheroids to sediment. FBS concentration should be 5%. Higher FBS concentration causes abnormal sprouting due to excessive growth factors. Lower FBS concentration cannot maintain healthy conditions for cells.\nMix spheroid-suspension solution and neutralized-type I collagen gel (3 mg/mL) at a 1:1 ratio on ice. Use a blunt 1 mL pipette tip to avoid breaking of spheroids.\nNOTE: 1 mL of the spheroids-suspending collagen gel solution is required for one well of a 24-well plate. Make an extra mixed suspension solution if possible.\nIf the angiogenic properties of any agent(s) or chemical(s) need to be tested, transfer 1 mL of the spheroid-suspending collagen gel solution in a 1 mL micro-tube and add agent(s) or chemical(s) followed by gentle mixing with a blunt 1mL pipette tip.\nNOTE: The volume of agent and chemical can sum to 200 μL, which dilutes the type I collagen gel concentration from 1.5 mg/mL to 1.25 mg/mL, but does not affect type I collagen gel polymerization. Add same volume of vehicle to the control spheroids.\nAdd the spheroid-suspending collagen gel solution into wells of a pre-warmed 24-well plate (0.9 mL/well) by pipetting, and then incubate for 30 min in a cell culture incubator for polymerization.\nNOTE: During the spheroid embedding process, do not disturb the gel by agitating the plate.\nCover the spheroid-suspending collagen gel by adding 100 µL of ECGM-MV2 containing 2.5% FBS with/without VEGF. For ECFC-only spheroids, stimulate the cells with exogenous addition of VEGF (final concentration of 50 ng/mL) to form proper sprouts. ECFC+MSC spheroids do not require exogenous stimulation by any growth factors.",
    "Place the plate in a real-time cell recorder installed in a cell culture incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2), and randomly focus on 5-10 spheroids (10x objective lens). Monitor the sprouting formation of each fluorescence-labeled spheroids every 1 h for 24 h without any disturbance.\n4. Quantitate Spheroid Sprouting\nImport the image files to ImageJ software to quantitate the number of sprouts and measure the length of each sprout. For co-culture spheroids, label ECFCs with green fluorescent dye before making spheroids. Then, measure the number and length of sprouts stained with green fluorescence (Supplemental Figure 2). Five randomly-selected spheroids were quantified per experimental group.\nNOTE: Sprouts are collaboratively elongated structures formed by several ECFCs extending out of spheroids. Sprout length is measured as the length from the point of sprouts origin from the surface of the spheroids to the tip of sprouts.\nExpress the values as means ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. Determine the statistically significant difference by one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons or Student’s t-test for paired comparisons.\nNOTE: P ≤ 0.05 is considered statistically significant.\nSubscription Required.
