    "Cross-linkingCross-linking covalently preserves DNA-protein interactions for the further preparation steps. However, the excessive fixation may hinder later chromatin shearing and recognition of protein tags/epitopes. Use fresh formaldehyde, as its effective concentration drops over time, especially when exposed to air and light. Vacuum is used to increase tissue penetration. At the quenching step glycine becomes a substrate for the excess of formaldehyde.Collect 4 g of Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves into a 50 ml conical tube. If plants are dehydrated as in case of drought-treated material, 2 g of leaves can be enough to obtain similar efficiency of chromatin extraction. Cover leaves with a small piece of nylon mesh and close the tube with a riddled screw-cap.Add 37 ml of cross-linking buffer (see Recipes) (under the fume hood) and apply vacuum for 10 min at room temperature for cross-linking to achieve the pressure of 50 mBar. The plant tissue should look translucent after cross-linking.Stop cross-linking by adding 2.5 ml of 2 M glycine (to final conc. of 100 mM) and applying the vacuum infiltration for additional 5 min.Chromatin isolation and MNase digestionWash plant tissues five times in sterile deionized water. Remove the water as much as possible by blotting the tissues between paper towels. This is important as ice crystals may destroy nuclei that would reduce efficiency of chromatin isolation. Freeze the tissue quickly in liquid nitrogen.Grind thoroughly the tissue to a very fine powder using pre-chilled mortars and pestles and ensure that the samples do not thaw during grinding.Transfer the plant powder into 50 ml conical tubes pre-cooled with liquid nitrogen. At this point you can store the material (for limited time) at -80 °C.Resuspend each sample in 20 ml of ice-cold Honda buffer (see Recipes).",
    "Vortex briefly (avoid floating) to mix and incubate on ice for 30 min with mixing on the rotator to homogenize the samples.Filter the homogenate through two layers of Miracloth and squeeze the Miracloth.Transfer the filtrate to a new 50 ml conical tube, and spin at 2,000 x g, 4 °C in a swing-out rotor (Heraeus) for 15 min.Resuspend the pellet very gently by pipetting in 20 ml of Honda buffer.Spin the suspension at 2,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min.Repeat resuspension and centrifugation as above. There should be soft white pellet of nuclei forming at the bottom of the tube. If the pellet is still green, additional washes may be needed.Resuspend the pellet in 20 ml of Honda buffer without spermine.Spin the suspension at 2,000 x g at 4 °C for 8 min.Resuspend the nuclei pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold TNE buffer (see Recipes) and divide it into two 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. In the presence of 4 mM CaCl2 (add 2 μl 1 M CaCl2 to each tube) add an appropriate number of MNase units (this needs to be established experimentally, we usually add between 8-20 U) to each tube and immediately place the tubes in a thermomixer pre-warmed to 37 °C. Incubate the tubes for 20 min with vigorous shaking (1,400 rpm) to liberate nucleosomes.Stop the reaction by placing the tubes on ice and adding 25 μl 0.5 M EGTA (to a final concentration of 25 mM).Spin at 14,000 x g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C.Save supernatant for further steps and store at -178 °C (liquid nitrogen). You can also save the pellet to check the efficiency of chromatin isolation and MNase digestion (the optional step [Step C3]).",
    "Detection of MNase digestion efficiency by DNA isolation (especially useful when optimizing MNase concentration)Reverse cross-linking and protein digestion Prior to DNA isolation, the crosslinks between DNA and proteins need to be reversed.Take 70 μl of chromatin isolate and add 400 μl of extraction buffer (see Recipes).Add 20 μl of 5 M NaCl and incubate at 65 °C for at least 4 h to overnight to reverse cross-linking.Add 10 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, 20 μl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 1.7 μl RNase A (30 mg/ml) and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Add 1 μl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubate for 1.5 h at 45 °C to digest proteins.DNA precipitationAdd an equal volume (500 μl) of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and vortex briefly.Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 5 min at RT and transfer the supernatant to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube.Add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 4 μl glycogen (20 mg/ml) and 2.5 volume of 100% EtOH, mix by inverting the tube several times and incubate at -80 °C for at least 40 min to precipitate the DNA.Centrifuge the sample at 14,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant, wash the pellet with 500 μl of cold 70% EtOH, centrifuge again for 5 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and dry the pellet at RT. Dissolve the pellet in 20 μl and check on the 1.5% agarose gel (Figure 1). You should observe mainly mononucleosomal DNA fragments (of size ~150 bp). You can compare it to DNA isolated from the pellet after nuclei treatment with MNase (see optional step [Step C3] below).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171229/20171229001418_0742.jpgFigure 1. DNA isolated from MNase-treated chromatin. Lanes 1 to 4 correspond to different samples.",
    "DNA fragments of different length represent mono-, di- and trinucleosomal DNA (~150, ~300 and ~450 bp, respectively). The desired fragments are mononucleosomal, although overdigestion should be avoided as well.Optional: Isolation of DNA from pellet after MNase treatmentNote: This protocol can be used to estimate how much genomic DNA remained in the pellet. Add 400 μl of Pellet extraction buffer (see Recipes) to the pellet obtained from MNase-treatment.Mix the tube vigorously for 15 min at 65 °C with 1,400 rpm shaking using thermomixer.Use 200 μl of the whole extract (no centrifugation) for incubation at 65 °C overnight to reverse crosslinking.Incubate with 1 μl RNase A (30 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. Add 1 μl of Proteinase K and incubate for 1.5 h at 45 °C.Add 200 μl phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (in a fume hood) to each sample and mix. Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 5 min. Carefully transfer aqueous layer to fresh 1.5 ml tubes.Add 20 μl 3 M NaOAc to each tube, mix. Add 550 μl absolute ethanol, mix and incubate at -80 °C for at least 40 min.Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to collect DNA. Wash pellet in 70% EtOH. Dry DNA pellet and resuspend in 50 μl TE buffer (see Recipes). Check 10 μl on the 1.5% gel along with a DNA ladder to estimate fragment size (Figure 2). You should observe that most of mono-, di-, and trinucleosomal DNA is present in the supernatant.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171229/20171229001933_3463.jpgFigure 2.

Lanes 1 and 3 contain DNA isolated from the supernatant (control and stress plants, respectively), lanes 2 and 4 contain DNA from the pellet (control and stress plants, respectively).",
    "Chromatin affinity purification (streptavidin to biotin)Take 25 µl of the Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin slurry for each sample and put into the Maxymum Recovery (low retention) tube on ice.Wash three times each with 1 ml of ice-cold Binding/Washing Buffer (see Recipes). Collect the beads on tube wall on a magnetic separator (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171229/20171229002146_3216.jpgFigure 3. Separation of streptavidin beads (Dynabeads M-280) using a magnetic separator. Beads attached to one side of Maxymum Recovery tube wall, so the supernatant can be easily removed, and the beads could be washed.Resuspend the beads in 100 μl of cold Binding/Washing Buffer.Divide your chromatin supernatant (obtained in Step B17) into 140 μl portions (for ChAP) and 20 μl portions (for input).Dilute 140 μl of the chromatin supernatant ten times with ice-cold ChIP Dilution Buffer (add 1260 μl of ChIP Dilution Buffer) (with protease inhibitors added, see Recipes). Once you obtained a greater volume of the chromatin supernatant. Spin in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min and then transfer to the tubes with beads (Step D3).Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a rotator such as Stuart SB3 Rotator with mild rotation (~15 rpm).Next morning, wash the beads on ice in the see-saw rocker:5 x 5 min Binding/Washing Buffer 2 x 5 min TEAfter final wash in TE, before beads collection, transfer the samples to fresh Maxymum Recovery tubes to avoid releasing DNA bound to the tube walls. Add 100 µl thoroughly mixed 10% Chelex (w/w) to the beads in each tube. Add 200 µl 10% Chelex to 20 µl input portion. Chelex is a chelating resin used to protect DNA from degradation at high temperatures (Singer-Sam et al., 1989) with proven efficacy during the elution step in ChIP method (Nelson et al., 2005).",
    "Exact volumes of chromatin used for ChAP or input and volumes of their eluates are needed in calculations of ‘percent of input’.Boil the samples in a heating block at 99 °C for 10 min. Add 1 µl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) to each tube and incubate at 43 °C for 1 h.Inactivate the Proteinase K by incubation at 99 °C for 10 min. Spin the samples for 1 min at maximum speed and transfer the supernatant to new low retention tubes.Use 2 µl of ChAP and input eluates in qPCR reactions."
