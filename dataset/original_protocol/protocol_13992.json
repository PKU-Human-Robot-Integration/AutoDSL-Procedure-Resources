    "This study was performed according to the Declarations of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Aerztekammer Westfalen-Lippe (reference number 2019-456).\n1. Study\nInstruct subjects on how to use the smartwatch for proper ECG recording.\n2. Recording of a standard 12-lead ECG by a common device\nUse a common ECG device for standard ECG recording.\nAdjust the paper running speed to 50 mm/s.\nPerform the ECG recording after a 5 min resting period in a supine position.\nPlace the right arm electrode near the right shoulder.\nPlace the left arm electrode near the left shoulder.\nPlace the right leg electrode near the right ankle.\nPlace the left leg electrode near the left ankle.\nPlace the V1 electrode in the fourth intercostal space at the right parasternal line.\nPlace the V2 electrode in the fourth intercostal space at the left parasternal line.\nPlace the V3 electrode between V2 and V4.\nPlace the V4 electrode in the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line.\nPlace the V5 electrode in the fifth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line.\nPlace the V6 electrode in the fifth intercostal space at the mid-axillary line.\nRecord a standard 12-lead ECG with the standard ECG device.\n\tNOTE: The patient should not move during the ECG recording in order to prevent ECG artifacts.\n3. Recording of Einthoven leads I-III by a smartwatch with ECG function\nRecord smartwatch ECGs directly after recording the standard ECGs.\nEnable the application of the smartwatch for ECG recordings. A 30 s ECG will be recorded directly after proper skin contact with the smartwatch.\nRecord Einthoven I by placing the back of the smartwatch on the left wrist and the right index finger on the crown (Figure 1A).",
    "Record Einthoven II by placing the back of the smartwatch on the left lower abdomen and the right index finger on the crown (Figure 1B).\nRecord Einthoven III by placing the back of the smartwatch on the left lower abdomen and the left index finger on the crown (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: The right and left index finger should not contact the skin of the left wrist or left lower abdomen for adequate ECG recording. The patient should not move during the ECG recording in order to prevent ECG artifacts.\n4. Analysis of the ECGs\nRecorded smartwatch ECGs are digitally stored using the smartphone app.\nUse the \"send PDF to your doctor\" function to create a PDF document of every single smartwatch ECG lead. Print the digital smartwatch ECG on paper for comparison with the standard ECG on printed paper.\nClassify all recorded smartwatch ECGs as of moderate signal quality if at least three consecutive QRS-complexes show noise-free signal quality and there are no artifacts in the isoelectric lines between QRS-complexes.\nClassify smartwatch ECGs as of good signal quality if at least ten QRS-complexes show noise-free signal quality and there are no artifacts in isoelectric lines between QRS-complexes.\n5. Statistical analysis\nPerform statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics.\n\tNOTE: Categorical variables are shown as absolute numbers and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Differences of metric outcome variables were assessed by one way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test. In case of binary variables, the χ2-test was used.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
