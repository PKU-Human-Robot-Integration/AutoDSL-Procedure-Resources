The experiments are performed in strict accordance with the standards established by the UTHealth Center for Laboratory Animal Medicine & Care (CLAMC) which is accredited by American Association for Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC International).The human subjects in this study fall under Scenario A (\"No Human Subjects Research\") as defined by the NIH SF424 documentation. Therefore, it does not need any approval by UTHealth human research ethics committee.\n1. Generation of LFS iPSCs (Figure 1A)\nOn day -2, plate 2 x 104 LFS patient fibroblasts into one well of a 6-well plate, and culture the cells with fibroblast medium (Table 1) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Ensure that the fibroblasts reach 50 - 60% confluence on the day of transduction (Day 0).\nPerform Sendai virus transduction on Day 0. To do this, replace the spent medium with pre-warmed fibroblast medium. Thaw the commercial Sendai virus reprogramming kit (see Table of Materials) on ice. Infect LFS fibroblasts with mixed Sendai viruses according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nMaintenance of the transduced cells in fibroblast medium (Day 1 - 6):\n\t\nOn the day 1, 24 h after transduction, remove the fibroblast medium containing remaining Sendai virus and replace it with 2 mL fresh fibroblast medium. Culture the transduced fibroblasts at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\nChange the medium with the fibroblast medium every other day from the Day 2 - 6.\nMaintenance of the transduced cells in the feeder culture condition (Day 7 - 28):",
    "Prepare irradiated CF1 mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) culture dishes on Day 6. To do this coat six 100 mm tissue culture dishes by adding 5 mL of 0.1% gelatin to each plate at room temperature for 30 min. Aspirate the 0.1% gelatin after coating.\nRemove MEFs from liquid nitrogen container. Thaw MEFs using the commercially available thawing system following the manufacturer's instructions. Plate the cells on the gelatin-coated plates with MEF/MSC culture medium (Table 1) at a seeding density of around 6.7 x 105 cells per 100 mm tissue culture dish.\nInoculate the transduced cells on MEF plates (Day 7): Trypsinize the transduced cells using 1 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA per 100 mm dish for 2 - 4 min at room temperature. Neutralize trypsin with 9 mL of fibroblast medium. Transfer cells to conical tubes and centrifuge cells at 230 x g at 37 °C for 4 min. Plate the transduced fibroblasts on the six MEF dishes prepared on Day 6 and culture them in 8 mL of fibroblast medium per dish.\n\t\tNOTE: The confluency of MEFs is around 20% before seeding transduced cell on MEF plates.\nOn the day 8, discard the fibroblast medium and replace with hESC medium (Table 1).\nWait for the emergence of iPS clones from Days 9 - 28 (Figure 1C). Change the spent hESC medium every other day and monitor the emergence of iPS clones under the microscope. Wait for iPSCs clones big enough to be observed by the naked eye and then proceed to expand iPS clones in feeder-free culture condition.\nExpansion of the emerged iPS clones in feeder-free culture condition (Day 29 - 79~99):",
    "To prepare the matrix-coated plate, coat a 48-well plate with 120 µL of the basement membrane matrix coating solution (Table 1) per well. Make sure the basement membrane matrix coating solution covers the well and coats the culture dish surface. Leave it at room temperature for 1 h. Aspirate the coating solution immediately before use and add 250 µL of hESC medium per well with 2 µM ROCK inhibitor Thiazovivin.\nOn the Day 28, aspirate the spent hESC medium and wash iPS clones with 1x DPBS. Pick up visible iPS clones with a 1 mL pipette tip and transfer into a well of a treated 48-well plate (step 1.4.1). Seed one colony per well of 48-well plate.\nCentrifuge the plate at 230 x g for 4 min to facilitate the cell attachment. Culture iPS clones at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\nThe following day (Day 29), remove the spent hESC medium and add 250 µL of the commercially available iPSC medium in each well.\nMaintain iPS clones at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator, and change the iPSC medium every other day.\nWhen iPS clones reach 85% confluence, subculture cells at a 1:10 ratio by culture area. Add 60 µL of the commercial passaging solution to detach the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.\nSeed half of the detached iPSCs on a basement membrane matrix-coated 12-well plate in 1 mL of hESC medium with 2 µM ROCK inhibitor Thiazovivin. Culture iPS clones in a 12-well plate with 1 mL of the commercially available iPSC medium per well and subculture iPSCs at a 1:10 ratio until they reach passage 10.",
    "NOTE: iPSCs are sub cultured every 5 - 7 days at a 1:10 ratio. It takes up to 10 weeks for iPS clones to reach passage 10. iPSC characterizations including cell morphology, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, and the expression of pluripotency factors and hESC markers, can be examined after confirming the removal of Sendai virus in iPSCs (usually demonstrated after around 10 passages) (Figure 1B-E). Antibody and primer information for iPSC characterization are included in Table 2 and 4.\n2. Differentiation of LFS iPSCs to Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) (Figure 2A)\nCulture iPSC clones on MEF plates for at least 2 weeks (Day ~ -14 - 0): Prepare the MEF dishes (100 mm tissue culture dishes) as previously described (1.3.1 - 1.3.2). Maintain iPSCs in hESC medium and change medium every other day. Whenever iPSCs reach 90% confluence, subculture iPSCs by 1:10 dilution.\nRemoval of MEFs from iPSCs (Day 0):\n\t\nAfter maintaining iPSCs on MEFs for 2 weeks, culture iPSCs in 100 mm tissue culture dishes until cells reach 80 - 90% confluence. Remove the spent hESC medium and wash iPSCs with 5 mL of 1x DPBS. Add 1 mL of the cell detachment solution to detach the cells and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.\nAdd 9 mL of MEF/MSC culture medium to the plate to neutralize the cell detachment solution activity and transfer the detached cells to a new 100 mm tissue culture dish without any coating.\nIncubate the cells at room temperature for 30 min to allow the MEFs to attach to the plate.\nCarefully collect the supernatant which contains unattached iPSCs, and centrifuge at 230 x g at 4 °C for 4 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Carelessly flushing the plate bottom leads to detachment of MEFs.\nDifferentiation of iPSCs toward MSCs (Day 0 - 28):",
    "Coat three wells of a 6-well plate with 1 mL of 0.1% gelatin per well at room temperature for 30 min.\nRemove the supernatant of the collected iPSCs from 2.2.4.\nResuspend iPSCs in 6 mL of MSC differentiation medium (Table 1) and seed cells in the three coated wells with 2 mL per well (Day 0).\nChange the MSC differentiation medium every two days to remove unattached and/or dead cells (Day 1 - 28).\nMaturation of iPSC-derived MSCs (Day 28 - 45):\n\t\nRemove the spent MSC differentiation medium and wash cells with 1 mL of 1x DPBS.\nTrypsinize MSCs with 0.5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA per well at room temperature for 3 min.\nNeutralize trypsin by 1.5 mL of the MEF/MSC culture medium and collect MSCs from three wells into one 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 230 x g at 4 °C for 4 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend MSCs in 3 mL of MEF/MSC culture medium and plate on one 60 mm 0.1% gelatin-coated plate (Day 28).\nCulture MSCs in MEF/MSC culture medium and change medium every two days. When the cells reach 100% confluence, subculture MSCs at a 1:3 ratio using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA.\n\t\tNOTE: The MSCs display a fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 2B). When MSCs grow in a high density, elongated MSCs can form a swirl-like pattern (Figure 2B).\nPerform the immunofluorescent staining to evaluate iPSC-derived MSCs by examining MSC surface markers CD44, CD73, CD105, and CD166 (Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: The dilution of antibodies are shown in Table 2. Immunofluorescent staining of live cells is performed according to manufacturer's instructions.\nAfter confirmation, expand MSCs at a 1:3 ratio in 100 mm tissue culture dishes. Freeze down vials (3 vials per 100 mm tissue culture dish) using the freezing medium containing 10% DMSO and 90% FBS.",
    "NOTE: To enrich the MSC population, MSCs can be sorted using CD105+, CD24- criteria by flow cytometry9,17. iPSC-derived MSCs differentiated using the PDGF-AB-based method commonly can be maintained for 2 - 3 months in culture without loss of MSC identity9. Freeze MSCs from an early passage number after confirming MSC characteristics.\n3. Differentiation of LFS MSCs to Osteoblasts (Figure 3A)\nPreparation of MSCs for the osteogenic differentiation (Day -1)\n\t\nTo ensure an adequate quantity of cells to complete the osteogenic differentiation protocol, begin with MSCs cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes to 95% confluence. Remove the spent culture medium and wash MSCs with 5 mL of 1x DPBS.\nTrypsinize MSCs with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA per 100 mm dish at room temperature for 3 min. To ensure the cells are not over trypsinized, stop trypsinization when 50% of the cell detachment is observed under the microscope.\nNeutralize trypsin by 9 mL of MEF/MSC culture medium and collect MSCs from 3 wells into one 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 230 x g at 4 °C for 4 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend MSCs in 5 mL of MSC medium, and count the number of cells by a hemocytometer.\nPlate proper number of MSCs on a culture plate.\n\t\tNOTE: The detail of cell numbers of 12-well plate, 6 well-plate, and 100 mm tissue culture dishes are summarized in Table 3.\nInduction of osteogenic differentiation by osteoblast differentiation medium (ODM) (Table 1) (Day 0 - 24):\n\t\nAspirate MEF/MSC culture medium and replace with the proper volume of ODM (1 mL, 2 mL, and 8 mL for each well of 12-well plate, each well of 6-well plate, and 100 mm tissue culture dish, respectively) to differentiate MSCs to osteoblasts (Day 0).",
    "Aspirate the spent ODM and replace with the proper volume of ODM every two days during the osteogenic differentiation process.\nPerform the alkaline phosphatase (AP) and the Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining to detect bone-associated alkaline phosphatase produced by preosteoblasts and mineral deposition produced by mature osteoblasts, respectively, on Day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 (Figure 3B).\n\t\tNOTE: AP staining and ARS staining are performed using commercially available kit following manufacturer protocol.\nExamine the expression levels of preosteoblast and mature osteoblast markers (ALPL and COL1A1 for preosteoblasts; PTH1R and BGLAP for mature osteoblasts) by qRT-PCR (Figure 3C).\n\t\tNOTE: Positive AP staining is expected after Day 9 of osteogenic differentiation and positive ARS staining can be expected after Day 21 of osteogenic differentiation. The MSCs growing in MEF/MSC culture medium can be served as a negative control of AP staining and ARS staining.\n4. The Xenograft Model to Study In Vivo Tumorigenesis of LFS MSC-derived Osteoblasts (Figure 4A)\nDifferentiation of LFS MSCs to osteoblasts:\n\t\nSeed 3 - 4.5 x 105 MSCs in 100 mm tissue culture dish. Prepare five dishes for one subcutaneous injection.\nCulture MSCs in ODM to differentiate MSCs to osteoblasts as described in 3.2 until Day 14.\nPreparation of differentiated osteoblasts for subcutaneous injection:\n\t\nTo prepare osteoblast detachment solution (Table 1), dissolve 1 g type II collagenase in 1,000 mL of αMEM medium to make the collagenase II solution (1 mg/mL). Keep the collagenase II solution at -20 °C. Mix 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and the collagenase II solution at a 1:1 ratio to make the osteoblasts detachment solution.\nRemove the spent ODM and wash differentiated osteoblasts with 5 mL of 1x DPBS per 100 mm dish.",
    "Add 1.5 mL of osteoblast detachment solution per 100 mm dish and incubate dishes at 37 °C for 30 min. Examine and ensure the osteoblast detachment by microscopy.\nNeutralize the osteoblasts detachment solution by ODM and collect the detached osteoblasts in a 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 230 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 25 mL of ODM medium. Pass the cells through a 70 µm cell strainer to remove aggregated cells. Count the cell numbers using a hemocytometer.\nPrepare 1 x 107 osteoblasts per subcutaneous injection, and centrifuge cells at 230 x g at 4 °C for 4 min.\nResuspend the 1 x 107 osteoblasts in 50 µL ice-cold 1x DPBS. Mix differentiated osteoblasts with 50 µL of phenol-red free basement membrane matrix (osteoblasts suspension and basement membrane matrix were mixed at a 1:1 ratio) and maintain osteoblasts on ice before injection.\nIn vivo xenograft tumor model of LFS MSC-derived osteoblasts:\n\t\nAnesthetize 8-week-old female immunocompromised NU/NU mice in a chamber supplying 5% (v/v) inhaled isoflurane in 1 L/min of oxygen (provided by CLAMC). After the animal becomes recumbent, switch the anesthetic delivery system to the nose cone, supplying 2% (v/v) inhaled isoflurane in 200mL/min of oxygen (provided by CLAMC). Monitor the depth of anesthesia by checking the corneal and pedal reflexes to make the mice are sufficiently anesthetized and are not suffering from discomfort during the procedure.\nDisinfect the area to be injected with alternating swabs of chlorhexidine and 70% isopropanol. Use 26 G needle to perform subcutaneous injection of basement membrane matrix-mixed LFS osteoblasts into one side of hind legs of 8-week-old immunocompromised NU/NU mice (Figure 4A).",
    "Monitor mice by performing weekly palpation at injection sites for growth of subcutaneous nodular densities. Tumor formation can be observed around 6-10 weeks after injection (Figure 4B).\nEuthanize the mice by carbon dioxide asphyxiation method followed by cervical dislocation. Dissect the developed tumors. Determine the tumor grade and the differentiation index, preosteoblasts, and mature osteoblasts by various staining methods (e.g. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, Picro Sirius Red staining, and von Kossa staining respectively).\nSubscription Required.
