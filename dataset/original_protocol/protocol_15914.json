    "This protocol (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-fig-0002]) describes the preparation of endo- and exo-ethyl bicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-ene-9-carboxylate 3a and 3b using commercially available diene 2, ethyl diazoacetate solution, and anhydrous copper (II) sulfate. The compound was prepared with modifications to a previously published procedure (Ghandi & Mashayekhi, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-bib-0011]). The preferred stereoisomer endo-3a was purified by normal phase column chromatography and carried through the rest of the synthesis as a single isomer. Throughout this paper, the notation “b” in compound numbers refers to the exo-stereoisomer, even though the compound is not depicted in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-fig-0002]. NMR spectra for the synthesized compounds are provided in the Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#support-information-section] section.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e420dd0a-167f-4173-8612-6db0f4886c94/cpz1559-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "BCN-E-BCN synthesis. Reagents and conditions: (A) CuSO4, ethyl diazoacetate, n-hexane, 68°C, 2 hr, endo-3a: 14%, exo-3b: 28%; (B) LiAlH4, THF, 0°C to rt, 1 hr, 92%; (C) Br2, DCM, 0°C to rt, 1 hr, 92%; (D) KOtBu, THF, 0 to 66°C, 2 hr, 42%; (E) p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, pyridine, DCM, rt, 1 hr, 78%; (F) ethylenediamine, NEt3, DMF, rt, 2 hr, 58%. Cyclooctadiene was subjected to cyclopropanation using inexpensive copper sulfate as the catalyst (Ghandi & Mashayekhi, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-bib-0011]). The isomers were separated by column chromatography and then reduced under standard conditions with LiAlH4 (Dommerholt et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-bib-0008]). When quenching with distilled water, drying over magnesium sulfate and subsequent filtration resulted in a gel; dilute HCl was used in place of distilled water, followed by aqueous workup. Bromination affords the respective dibromide (Li et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-bib-0015]) as white needles after recrystallization in heptane. In our experience with carrying over a yellow-brownish oil to the elimination step, the reaction yields have been poor. Moreover, emulsions were commonly encountered during extraction, which warrants rotary evaporation of the reaction solvent after quenching any excess potassium tert-butoxide with ammonium chloride. Column chromatography using a mixture of ethyl acetate in dichloromethane affords the strained alkyne as a white solid (Dommerholt et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-bib-0008]; Li et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-bib-0015]). Coupling with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate followed by ethylenediamine affords sulfenic acid probe 1 in good yields (McGarry et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.559#cpz1559-bib-0016]).\nMaterials\n1,5-Cyclooctadiene (Sigma Aldrich)\nHexane (ACP Chemicals)\nAnhydrous copper (II) sulfate\nEthyl diazoacetate (contains 10 wt.% DCM, Fluka)\nSiliaFlash P60 silica gel (40-63 µM, SiliCycle)\n2-neck round bottom flask, 250 ml\nMagnetic stir bar\nPressure-equalizing addition funnel\nRotary evaporator\nChromatography column\nNMR spectrometer\nCyclopropanation of 2",

    "The following protocol describes steps to test the utility of synthesized BCN-E-BCN as an oxidation probe and its ability to detect oxidation of cysteine residues in a rapid and highly sensitive manner when compared to dimedone. Purified recombinant wild-type cofilin and a cysteine-deficient form of cofilin, in which two redox-sensitive cysteines were mutated to alanine residues (C139A/C147A) to render it resistant to hydrogen peroxide–mediated oxidation, were exposed to differing amounts of hydrogen peroxide in vitro, and then labeled with BCN-E-BCN.
