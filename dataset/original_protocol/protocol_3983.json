    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIncubation of L. donovani promastigotes with test compounds\nTiming: 3.5 h\nThis section details pre-incubation of L. donovani promastigotes with test compound prior to sample processing. Exposing parasites to test compounds for a short period, prior to processing, enables the compound to interact with its target in a native conformation, potentially increasing the chances of thermal stabilization of the target.\nAdd the test compound to one of the roller-bottle cultures (treated sample, 500 mL) at a concentration equivalent to 10× its established EC50 value. It should be noted that compound stocks must be prepared so that the vehicle (commonly DMSO) does not exceed a final concentration of 0.5% in treated cultures. An equivalent volume of the diluent should be added to the second roller-bottle (control sample, 500 mL).\nTreated and untreated cultures should be returned to the incubator at 28°C for a further 3 h.\nCritical: The EC50 value of the test compound should be accurately determined prior to the study. Adding test compound in excess of 10× EC50 value could result in parasite cell death and lysis with the concomitant release of damaging proteases that will affect the sample quality. Incubation with excessively high compound concentrations may increase the likelihood of off-target compound interactions. Incubation with test compounds at lower concentrations may lead to sub-optimal thermal stabilization of specific targets.\nGeneration of cell lysate\nTiming: 2 h\nThis protocol describes how to prepare cell lysates suitable for subsequent TPP studies.",
    "Centrifuge (1920 × g for 15 min at 4°C) the 500 mL treated and control cultures of L. donovani. Wash the resulting cell pellets (0.2–0.5 mL expected pellet volume) with the equivalent of 5 pellet volumes of ice-cold PBS and then centrifuge (1920 × g for 15 min at 4°C). It should be noted that the PBS used for cell pellet washes should be spiked with either test compound or vehicle at concentrations equivalent to those used in pre-incubations.\nCritical: It is important to maintain the presence of the test compound (in the treated sample) or diluent (in the control) throughout cell pellet washes. This ensures that target-ligand interactions made during the initial incubation are maintained.\nResuspend washed parasite pellets in 2 mL ice-cold lysis buffer (again supplemented with test compound at a concentration equivalent to 10× its established EC50 value or diluent) and transfer to LoBind tubes (5 mL).\nCritical: At this stage it is vital to use LoBind tubes to prevent loss of protein from the samples due to non-specific binding to plastic. It is also important to maintain samples on ice.\nLyse cells under pressure using the Constant Systems cell disruptor. It should be noted that other methods of cell lysis, such as sonication or nitrogen cavitation, may be equally suitable.\nPre-chill the cell disruptor lysis chamber to 4°C.\nLyse the control sample at a pressure of 30 kpsi.\nWash the cell disruptor lysis chamber 2× with milliQ H2O (5 mL) and 1× with lysis buffer (5 mL) to prevent cross contamination of samples.\nThen lyse the treated sample at 30 kpsi.",
    "Transfer cell lysates into 1 mL tubes suitable for ultracentrifugation and centrifuge (100,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C). Recover the supernatant from centrifuged samples and transfer into a fresh 2 mL LoBind tube. Do not disturb the pellet when recovering the supernatants. The pellets can now be discarded.\nAccurately determine protein concentration of the supernatants using a standard Bradford or similar protein assay. Adjust the protein concentration of each sample (treated and control) to 1–1.5 mg/mL using ice-cold Lysis Buffer. The protein yield required for a single TPP experiment is 4 mg. Using these culture and lysis conditions, the protein yield should be 6–10 mg per bottle. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nThermal shift assay\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis protocol describes the steps required to perform thermal shift assays. Here, treated and control lysates are exposed to a range of temperatures. The proteins within each sample denature at different points of the temperature gradient and ultimately precipitate. Precipitated proteins are then removed by ultracentrifugation and the soluble fraction is assessed.\nDispense the treated and control cell lysates into 10 × 0.5 mL LoBind tubes (100 μL aliquots in each tube, representing 100–150 μg of protein) making two series per condition (treated and control) each comprised of 10 samples. Keep these tubes on ice.\nNote: Individual aliquots will be incubated at a single temperature point within the following temperature range: 33°C–69°C in 4°C increments.\nNote: A thermal cycler or gradient PCR machine can be used to achieve an accurate temperature gradient. If you do not have access to a gradient PCR machine, a standard thermal cycler can be used sequentially.\nSubmit the aliquots to the following temperatures: 15 min at room temperature (RT, 20°C–25°C), 3 min at the designated temperature point, 3 min at room temperature and then place on ice.",
    "Transfer the contents to open-top thickwall 230-μL ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman) and remove denatured proteins by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 4°C for 20 min). Carefully harvest the supernatants and transfer to fresh 1.5 mL LoBind tubes. Discard the pellets.\nCritical: It is imperative that supernatants are harvested carefully and that they are not contaminated with material from the pellet. Do not attempt to recover all of the supernatant, we suggest that the maximum volume that can be safely recovered is 70 μL.\nMeasure protein concentration in each sample using the Bradford or similar protein concentration assay.\nPlot the determined protein concentrations of each sample against the temperature each sample was exposed to. It is expected that as the exposure temperature increases the level of recovered protein should decrease.\nNote: The protein concentration of the sample exposed to the highest temperature in the range (in this case 69°C) should be <20% of that in the sample exposed to the lowest temperature. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSample processing and labeling\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis section describes the process of reducing, alkylating and denaturing samples. In addition, the process of digesting and labeling peptides with TMT 10-plex tags is detailed.\nCritical: Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and formic acid (FA) are harmful when inhaled. They need to be used in an fume hood to minimize the risk of inhalation and disposed following the appropriate health and safety regulations.\nTo reduce each sample add 25–50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, 3.5 μL 1M TCEP) and incubate for 10 min at 37°C. Allow the samples to equilibrate to RT (20°C–25°C).\nTo alkylate proteins, add 25–50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA, 3.5 μL 1M IAA) to each sample and incubate for 1 h at RT (20°C–25°C) in the dark.\nNote: Some precipitation may be seen after incubation with IAA.",
    "Critical: Use a fresh IAA solution and preserve it from light. Foil can be used to protect alkylated samples and IAA solution from light.\nTo precipitate proteins, add 10.5 μL trichloroacetic acid 6.1 N (TCA, final concentration of 12%) to each sample, vortex briefly (∼5 s) and incubate samples at −20°C for a minimum of 3 h. Samples can be left at −20°C overnight (3–16 h).\nNote: Some samples may be frozen following overnight incubation. Allow frozen samples to melt on ice prior to the next step.\nCentrifuge (20,000 × g, 4°C for 5 min) samples, then carefully discard the supernatants and harvest the pellets. Place the tubes containing the pellets on ice.\nNote: Samples must be kept on ice during the acetone washes.\nAdd pre-chilled acetone (500 μL) to each pellet, then vortex (∼10 s) until the pellet is dislodged from the bottom of the tube. Now incubate at 4°C for 10 min with agitation (600 rpm) in a shaker.\nNext, centrifuge (20,000 × g, 4°C for 5 min) each sample, carefully remove and dispose of the acetone. Repeat washes 2× with acetone.\nNote: During washes be careful not to disturb or aspirate the pellet. It is not essential to remove all the acetone since any excess can be removed by evaporation.\nFinally, remove and dispose of the acetone and leave pellets to air dry at RT (20°C–25°C).\nOptional: Acetone evaporation can be accelerated by incubation at 37°C.\nPause point: At this time, protein pellets can be safely stored at −20°C.\nResuspend the pellets in 100 mM tetraethylammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5 (TEAB, 500 μL). Vortex each sample vigorously (∼20 s) until pellets are dissolved.\nNote: Following resuspension of the pellet, check the pH of the sample is ≥8 using a pH indicator strip.",
    "Note: if the pellets are very stubborn and they do not dissolve, try sonication in a sonicating water bath for 5 min (37 kHz, 100% power, RT (20°C–25°C)) to help dissolve the pellet before adding the digestion enzymes.\nIn order to resuspend the desiccated vial of endoproteinase Lys-C, add 100 mM TEAB (20 μL) and shake gently to make a 1 mg/mL solution.\nAdd resuspended Lys-C solution to each sample at a 50:1 protein:enzyme ratio (1 μg of enzyme per 50 μg of protein). Incubate with agitation (600 rpm) at 37°C for 4–6 h.\nNote: Use protein concentration quantified in step 11 to calculate the amount of Lys-C and Trypsin required (approximately 1.4–2.1 μg of enzyme per tube).\nIn order to resuspend the desiccated vial of trypsin, add 100 mM TEAB (20 μL) to the vial and shake gently to make a 1 mg/mL solution.\nAdd trypsin solution to the samples at a 50:1 protein:enzyme ratio. Incubate at 37°C with agitation (600 rpm) for between 8–16 h.\nVacuum dry the samples in an evaporator overnight (8–16 h) at 30°C using a program suitable for water-based samples (program “Aqueous” in the recommended evaporator).\nOptional: We recommend checking the digestion efficiency of some of the samples via mass spectrometry prior to TMT labelling.\nTo check the digestion efficiency, randomly select a few (2–4) samples representative of different temperatures (for example samples 1, 5 and 9) as they have different protein quantity.\nResuspend these samples in 100 μL TEAB, then pick a 1 μL aliquot and dilute it 1:5 in 0.1% FA in a sample tube.",
    "Use the following recommended equipment: Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) and a Pepswift Monolithic Nano resolving column.\nPlace each sample in the sample rack of the HPLC and load 5 μL sample at 10 μL min−1 onto the trap column pre-equilibrated with Buffer C. Wash the trap column with Buffer C for 3 min at 10 μL min−1, then switch the trap column in line with the resolving column. Elute peptides at a constant flow rate of 700 nL min−1 with a linear gradient from 2%–40% Buffer D over 7 min, and then from 40%–98% Buffer D over 1 min. Wash the column with 98% Buffer D for 1 min and re-equilibrate in 2% Buffer D for 5 min.\nUse Q Exactive Plus in data-dependent positive ion mode using the following setup:\nMS1 scan cycles m/z range from 335–1800, with a maximum ion injection time of 30 ms, a resolution of 70,000 and automatic gain control (AGC) value of 1 × 106.\nFollowed by 10 sequential dependent MS2 scans with an isolation window set to 1.4 m/z, resolution at 17,500, maximum ion injection time at 100 ms and AGC 2 × 105.\nOpen the .raw files using Thermo XcaliburTM (Qual browser). This should open two windows: the upper window showing a chromatogram of signal relative abundance over retention time and the lower window showing the relative abundance over m/z ratio.\nBy selecting peaks on the upper chromatogram, the lower window will display the relative abundance and m/z of that peak.",
    "Note: Check that the majority of peaks have a charge lower than 4 (z <4). High abundance of multiply charged species indicate that digestion has been not accomplished and should be repeated.\nPause point: Digested peptides can be stored at −20°C.\nTMT 10plex labels are provided in sachets stored at −20°C. Remove 4 ×TMT 10plex sachets from storage at −20°C and allow to equilibrate to RT (20°C–25°C). Each sachet contains 10 tubes with 0.8 mg of the corresponding TMT 10plex label, enough to label 100 μg of protein.\nNote: It is important that the 4× sachets should share the same batch number since there can be variability between batches.\nResuspend the dried peptide samples in 100 mM TEAB (100 μL) and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) with agitation (600 rpm).\nNote: Check that the pH of samples is ≥8\nAdd acetonitrile (ACN, 41 μL) to each TMT tube and incubate with agitation (600 rpm) for 15 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nBriefly, centrifuge peptide samples and TMT tubes (3,000 × g, 10 s).\nAdd the content of each TMT tube to the corresponding peptide sample, as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_948_3.csv\nIncubate with agitation for 1 h at RT (20°C–25°C).\nDilute the quenching reagent (50% hydroxylamine solution) 10-fold in 100 mM TEAB, making a final 5% hydroxylamine solution.\nNote: If the quenching reagent appears precipitated, incubate at 37°C until the solution clears.\nIn order to quench the residual, unreacted TMTs, add 5% hydroxylamine solution (8 μL) to each reaction tube and incubate with agitation.\nBriefly centrifuge (3,000 × g, 10 s) each reaction tube and then combine the 10× treated samples together in a single LoBind 2 mL tube. Then combine the 10× control samples into another 2 mL LoBind tube.",
    "Vacuum dry the pooled samples in an evaporator overnight (8–16 h) at 30°C using a program suitable for water and organic solvent-based samples (program “HPLC” in the recommended evaporator).\nPause point: TMT-labelled peptides can be stored at −20°C.\nTo start the desalting step, resuspend the dried pooled samples in 0.1% TFA (300 μL).\nPlace the desalting columns (one per sample) in 2 mL LoBind tubes and centrifuge (5,000 × g, 1 min) to remove the equilibration buffer. Discard the flow through.\nWash the desalting columns 2× with 100% ACN (300 μL) and discard the flow-through.\nWash the columns a further 2× with 0.1% TFA (300 μL) and discard the flow-through.\nAdd the samples to separate desalting columns, centrifuge (3,000 × g, 1 min) and discard the flow-through. The peptides should now be bound to the columns.\nWash the columns 3× with 0.1% TFA and discard the flow-through.\nWash the columns 2× with 5% methanol (diluted in 0.1% TFA) to remove excess TMTs.\nElute peptides from the desalting columns into fresh 2 mL LoBind tubes by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 1 min) using 50% ACN diluted in 0.1% TFA (2× 300 μL).\nVacuum dry the desalted eluates.\nPause point: Desalted TMT-labelled peptides can be stored at −20°C.\nSample fractionation and mass spectrometry analysis\nTiming: 10 days\nThis section describes the fractionation of samples by high-pH reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Fractionation enables less complex peptide samples to be prepared for subsequent analysis by LC-MS/MS.\nSet-up of the Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex) using the Chromeleon software.\nTurn on UV lamp (wavelength 220 nm) at least 15 min prior to a run.\nPurge the system with Buffer A (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 9.5) and Buffer B (10 mM ammonium formate in 90% ACN, pH 9.5).",

    "Combine the 80 resulting fractions into 20 fractions by concatenating them. Discard fractions 1 and 2 as they usually contain the TMT excess and other contaminants.\nRepeat the run with a standard and continue running the following samples intercalating with standard runs.\nNote: Concatenate samples so that each contains eluted fractions collected at different points in the run. For example, fraction 3 would contain fractions eluted at 3, 23, 43 and 63 min.\nVacuum dry the concatenated fractions.\nPause point: Concatenated fractions can be stored at −20°C.\nMass spectrometry analysis was performed using a nanoflow LC system (Ultimate 3000, Thermo) coupled to a Q Exactive HF Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo).\nNote: The HPLC is equipped with a trap column switched in-line with a resolving column in order to protect it from salts and other interfering compounds and to concentrate the peptides before LC-MS/MS.\nThe mass spectrometer must be calibrated prior to analysis of samples.\nResuspend the concatenated samples in 0.1% FA (10 μL) and then load 1 μL aliquots (at 5 μL min-1) onto the trap column previously equilibrated with 95% Buffer C (0.1% FA) and 5% Buffer D (0.1% FA in 90% ACN). Once samples are loaded, wash the column for 5 min with 5% Buffer D at 5 μL min−1.\nConnect the trap column to the resolving column and elute peptides at 300 nL min−1 with a linear gradient (5% Buffer C for fractions 1–10, 7% for fractions 11–20, up to 35% Buffer C over 130 min, and then to 98% Buffer C at 132 min).

This will create a .CSV file with the Tm targets (“Tm_targets.csv”).",
    "Run lines in #step 71 of the script file to create a file containing the NPARC targets of the experiment. This will create a .CSV file with the NPARC targets (“NPARC_targets.csv”).

This excel file contains links to the melting curves (Tm method) and splines (NPARC method) .PDF files. Melting curve files can also be found in the analysis/Melting_Curves folder, there is a file for each protein plotted. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nIn order to obtain high confidence target candidates, two independent experiments should be performed. Any target that is identified as target via Tm analysis in both experiments (with similar melting curve behavior), should be considered a high confidence target. Similarly, any target considered a NPARC target with a 0.01 confidence level in both experiments (with similar melting curve behavior), should also be considered a high confidence target.\nTo avoid missing potential targets, we recommend visually cross-checking Tm and NPARC targets from one experiment with their counterparts in the second experiment. This is particularly important for Tm targets as some proteins may not match the statistical assumptions made in this data analysis programme.\nOptional: It is up to the user to reduce the stringency of the analysis modifying different parameters in step 69 or reducing stringency (increasing p-value threshold) in step 71. Targets found by modifying these parameters should not be considered high confidence though, but this can assist in avoiding false negatives.\nThe file “QCplots.pdf” in the “analysis” folder shows quality control plots of the process. Check that the normalization curves have a R2 value greater than 0.90."
