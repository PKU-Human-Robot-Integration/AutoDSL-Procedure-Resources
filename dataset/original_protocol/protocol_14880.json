    "1. Generation of OVCAR-3 Human ovarian Carcinoma Cells Stably Transduced with Lentiviruses Containing the SOX2 Regulatory Region Reporter Construct\nGenerate lentiviral particles by transfecting the HEK 293T-packaging cell line with a reporter construct recognizing a SOX2 regulatory region as described10,21.\n\tNOTE: The reporter construct further contains a destabilization domain of the ProteoTuner Shield System ahead of the tdTomato fluorescence protein. Shield1 binds to the destabilization domain thereby preventing the proteasome to degrade the fluorescence protein22.\nTransduce OVCAR-3 cells with lentiviral particles over a time period of 24 hr. Afterwards, remove the viral supernatant and wash the cells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and cultured in complete medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin).\n48 hr later, 10 μg/ml puromycin were added to the cultures and maintained for 5 days to allow selection of properly transduced cells.\n2. Preparation of Cell Sorting and Plating\nAdd Shield1 at 1:1,000 dilution 24 hr prior to cell sorting. Use stably transduced OVCAR-3 cells without Shield1 treatment as negative controls (Figure 1). Aspirate media from flask, wash cells with 1x PBS and trypsinize cells with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 3 min.\nStop trypsin by using complete medium (see above), count cell numbers, centrifuge cells at 300 x g at RT (15 - 25 °C) for 5 min.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend cells carefully in 0.5 - 1 ml sterile PBS.\nUse 40 µm cell strainer cap filter to obtain single-cell suspension.\nAdjust cell count to 5 million cells per ml.",
    "Prepare ultra low-attachment 96-well plates with 100 μl spheres medium (MEGM supplemented with growth factors, cytokines, and supplements, B-27, heparine-sodium; or DMEM/F12 supplemented with growth factors, cytokines, and supplements, B-27, heparine-sodium with or without addition of 1% methylcellulose, see also Table 1). Optionally add antibiotics to the medium at a concentration of 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin to minimize the risk of possible contamination.\nSort RFP+ and RFP- cells into prepared 96-well plates from above, 1 cell per well (single cell-based spheres assay) and 100 cells per well (multi cell-based spheres assay), respectively. Perform sort on commercially available cell sorter (see Materials) using single cell mode, Sort setup: 100 μ nozzle, sheath pressure 20 psi, and yield mask 0, purity mask 32, phase mask 16.\nAssess plating efficiency by microscopically scoring wells containing cells (for the single cell-based assay) and by counting cell numbers in individual wells (for the multi cell-based assay; Figure 2).\nIncubate cells under standard conditions in spheres medium (for composition see step 2.6) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Supplement daily bFGF (20 ng/ml) and EGF (20 ng/ml).\nAfter one week, count numbers of emerging tumor spheres using a standard microscope with 4X or 10X magnification and a fluorescence microscope to detect fluorescence signal from the integrated reporter system. Count spheres with a diameter exceeding 100 μm as “large” spheres, and spheres with a diameter 50 - 100 μm as “small” spheres (Figure 3). Be sure that you count real spheres and not cell clusters.\n\tNOTE: In single cell-based assays sphere formation is easier to score microscopically after 10 (versus 7) days of culture.",
    "Calculate the proportion of sphere-forming cells in RFP+ and respectively RFP- cells in single cell-based assays (one 96-well plate for each individual experiment) or multi cell-based spheres assays (one well for each individual experiment) as presented by Shaw et al.16\n\tNOTE: Proportion of sphere forming cells (%) = (number of spheres) / (number of seeded cells) x 100\n3. Serial Passaging of Spheres\nPlace the content of each well in an appropriate sterile tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at RT. For multi cell-based spheres assays, collect together the spheres from one well. Wash the well 3 - 5 times with PBS and centrifuge 2 min longer. For single cell-based spheres assays, collect individual spheres. Due to the low numbers of cells, use 1.5 ml tubes for centrifugation and washing steps.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 200 µl of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.\nIn order to achieve optimal cell separation, incubate the cell suspension at 37 °C for 5 min in a soft shaker. Optimize trypsinization time for your cell line to lower cell death rate: if no large spheres is visible triturate gently using a 100 μl pipette tip. In case large spheres are still present, incubate with trypsin another 3 min and then proceed to the trituration step. In case of single cell-based assays make sure to optimize the time for optimal cell yield of living cells during the trypsinization step.\nTo inactivate the trypsin, add 500 µl complete medium and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min, in the case of single cell assays, centrifuge for additional 2 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cells carefully in spheres medium.\nUse a 40 µm cell strainer cap filter to obtain a single-cell suspension.",
    "In the case of using RFP+ and RFP- cells in multi cell-bassed assays, assess the percentage of fluorescent cells in each well after resuspension via flow cytometer analysis.\nFor serial replating assays of single cells, seed 1 cell per well into a new ultra low-attachment 96-well plate prepared as detailed above. From one individual sphere, seed approximately 20 individual wells. For replating assays of multi cell-based primary spheres, seed cells obtained from one well of primary spheres into a new 96-well plate and count the cell numbers next day by microscopy.\nAssess the proportion of sphere-forming cells in secondary spheres assays using the formula described in step 2.11.\n4. Result Analysis\nAnalyze results from experiments performed in independent triplicates and use two-sided Student’s t-Test to analyze normally distributed values and otherwise Mann-Whitney-Tests for statistical analysis.\nSubscription Required.
