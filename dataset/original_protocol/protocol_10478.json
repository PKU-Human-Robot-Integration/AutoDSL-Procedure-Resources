    "Caution: Refer to material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use of acetone and chloroform which are carcinogenic.\n1. Preparation of Phospholipid Monolayer at a Flat Air-water Interface\nFormation of a phospholipid monolayer\n\t\nPreparation of a phospholipid solution\n\t\t\nClean a 4 ml vial with a polytetrafluoroethylene coated cap using acetone, ethanol, and deionized water at least three times, and blow nitrogen gas thoroughly into the vial to get rid of water.\nDissolve 1 mg of phospholipid (e.g., dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, DOPC) to 1 ml of chloroform in the vial to obtain 1 mg/ml of concentration. Perform this procedure in a fume hood for safety. Use lower or higher concentrations of phospholipid solution if necessary.\nAdd dye tagged phospholipids (e.g., Rhodamine dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, Rhodamine DPPE) with less than 1 mol % of the phospholipid solution, in order to visualize the phospholipid monolayer with a fluorescence microscope. Perform this procedure in a fume hood for safety.\nWrap the vial with a polytetrafluoroethylene tape to prevent solvent evaporation, and store the sample in a freezer at -20 °C.\nDeposition of phospholipids onto the air-water interface\n\t\t\nClean a Petri dish (55 mm in diameter and 12 mm in height) with ethanol, and deionized water at least three times.\nFill the Petri dish with 10 ml of deionized water to create an air-water interface.\nSpread few microliters of the phospholipid solution with a micro-syringe onto a clean interface to achieve desired surface pressure and wait for at least 30 min to evaporate the solvent completely, prior to doing the experiment.\n\t\t\tNote: A Langmuir trough can be used instead of a Petri dish if precise control of surface pressure is necessary.\nSurface pressure measurement",
    "Measure the surface pressure of the phospholipid monolayer with a Wilhelmy plate tensiometer. Wait for at least 30 min to get the filter paper wetted enough if filter paper is used as a Wilhelmy plate. The detailed protocol is available in Kuhn et al.20.\nAdjust the deposited amount of the phospholipid to control the surface pressure precisely. Add 4 µl of the DOPC solution (1 mg/ml) onto the 30.25 cm2–area of the interface if ~ 5 mN/m of surface pressure is required.\n\t\tNote: If the filter paper is not fully wetted, surface pressure changes dramatically during the first 30 min of the experiment due to the weight change of the filter paper.\nMinimization of the convective flow of the monolayer\n\t\nUse a cone-shaped apparatus that contains a 3 mm reservoir with two thin channels, connected to a large section of the Petri dish, to suppress the convective flow of the monolayer, which can disturb morphology imaging and surface pressure measurement.\nMake sure to match the water levels between the inside and outside of the cone-shape apparatus to ensure that phospholipids move freely over the whole region before depositing phospholipids onto the air-water interface.\n2. Preparation of Phospholipid Monolayer at the Curved Surface of a Droplet\nTapering process of a glass capillary using micropipette puller\n\t\nPlace a glass capillary (o.d. 1 mm, i.d. 0.78 mm, length 100 mm) on a capillary holder of a micropipette puller.\nDesign a program for pulling the capillaries with appropriate parameter values (Heat: Ramp, Pull: 60, Vel: 70, Delay: 70 and Pressure 200) and pull the capillaries with the designed program according to manufacturer’s protocol.",
    "Note: A capillary end with a few micrometers-diameter is necessary to form a 100 µm-droplet by applying a pressure with ~ 10 kPa. If the tip end of the capillary is too small, much higher pressure, > 600 kPa, is required to obtain the droplet, while it is hard to control the size of the droplets with a too large capillary tip end.\nAbsorption of phospholipids onto the droplet surface\n\tNote: To form a phospholipid monolayer at the curved interface of a droplet, a phospholipid solution without dye tagged phospholipids is used to obtain an intensity contrast, against the flat monolayer, prepared by procedure 1. In addition, both procedures 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 are allowable here. If precise control of the surface pressure at the droplet surface is necessary, procedure 2.2.2 is highly recommended. However, if not, procedure 2.2.1, which is a much easier way than procedure 2.2.2, is useful.\n\t\nCoating process of phospholipids at a tip end\n\t\t\nClean a slide glass using acetone, ethanol, and deionized water at least three times.\nPlace the tapered capillary on a cleaned slide glass, and tilt the capillary to facilitate touching the slide glass with a tip end.\nDrop a few droplets of phospholipid solution (1 mg/ml) onto the tip end of a capillary that is adhered to the glass slide using a glass syringe, and wait at least 30 min to evaporate the solvent completely.\n\t\t\tNote: It is highly recommended to adhere the tip end of the capillary to the glass slide during procedure 2.2.1.3 because the perimeter of the tip end is too small to hold the droplet of the phospholipids at the tip end only by capillary force.\nPreparation of a vesicle solution\n\t\t\nClean a vial, and remove water from the vial, as introduced in procedure 1.1.1.1.",
    "Dry a 2 ml volume of phospholipid solution (1 mg/ml) by applying nitrogen gas gently, and desiccate the vial for 1 hr at RT to eliminate any remaining solvent. Perform this procedure in a fume hood for safety.\nAdd 2 ml of deionized water into the vial containing dried lipids, and incubate the vial in an oven at 60 °C for 1 hr.\nShake the vial several times, and sonicate (HF-frequency: Up to 40 kHz, Power: 370 W) for 30 min to obtain vesicles.\nPerform extrusion and freeze-thaw processes to obtain monodisperse unilamellar vesicles. The detailed protocol for preparing vesicles is described in Mayer et al.21.\n\t\t\tNote: Surface pressure of the droplet interface is controlled precisely by adjusting the waiting time after formation of the droplet that contains monodisperse unilamellar vesicles. Using a pendant drop method22, it is necessary to measure the change of surface pressure according to time, prior to doing the experiment.\nFormation of a droplet that contains a phospholipid monolayer at the curved surface\n\t\nFill in the tapered capillary with 10 µl of deionized water from procedure 2.2.1. Alternatively, use 10 µl of the vesicle solution from procedure 2.2.2.\nConnect the capillary to an automated micro-injector to provide the pressure to form the droplet.\nMount the capillary that is connected to a micro-injector to a micromanipulator to control the position of the capillary precisely.\nPrepare a bright field microscope (Microscope 1, objective lens: 10X NA 0.3) for imaging the lateral view of the capillary with a CCD camera. Microscope 1 thus enables to observe the precise position of the droplet along the z-axis and estimate the size of the droplet.",
    "Move the tip end to a position where the lateral view of the tip end is well visualized by Microscope 1 using a micromanipulator, and apply a variable pressure (~ 100 hPa) with the tip end of the capillary, until an appropriate size (~100 µm in diameter) of droplet is formed.\n\t\tNote: It is recommended that automated micro-injector and micromanipulator be used, if fine control of the droplet size and location of the droplet is necessary. It is also possible to use manual ones.\n3. Imaging Fluorescence Recovery after Droplet Merging\nNote: The fundamental principles of this protocol are identical to those of the FRAP technique, except for the drop coalescence process. The detailed protocol and related theories of FRAP are available in A. Lopez et al.15 and D. Axelrod et al.16.\nMonitoring and controlling the location of the droplet\n\t\nPrepare an inverted microscope set (Microscope 2, objective lens: 10X NA 0.3, tube lens: focal length 17 cm) that enables both a fluorescence microscope with a proper filter set for Rhodamine-DPPEs (excitation at 560 nm, emission at 583 nm) and a bright field microscope. Use a CCD camera here for visualizing the top views of the droplet with a fluorescence microscope mode and a bright-field microscope mode.\nMove the droplet coated with a phospholipid to a flat air-water interface along the z-axis, but do not merge the droplet yet, using the micromanipulator. Use Microscope 1 to visualize the lateral view of the droplet.\nLocate the droplet at the center of the top view of the flat monolayer, using the micromanipulator. Use the bright-field microscope mode of Microscope 2 to visualize top view of flat monolayer.\nMerging the droplet onto the flat air-water interface",
    "Move the droplet further toward the flat interface until the droplet merges onto the interface, using the micromanipulator. If the merging process is done successfully, a dark region with a circular shape that is surrounded by a white background, is observed using the fluorescence mode of Microscope 2.\nRecord the series of fluorescent images according to time after merging the droplet, using the fluorescence mode of Microscope 2. Use a faster frame rate than the diffusion time scale of the monolayer here. In DOPC monolayer, it takes a few minutes to diffuse into the 200 µm-dark area completely.\n4. Determining the Diffusion Coefficient by Image Analysis\nNote: To determine the diffusion coefficient from a series of images, customized program for image analysis is built as described below. A detailed source code of this program is available in JoVE website.\nDetection of a circular region of interest\n\t\nDetection of the center of the region of interest\n\t\t\nObtain a series of fluorescent images that have been recorded during a recovery process which contains a circular dark area and a white background, and set the first image of the series as a reference image. Here, RD is the radius of the dark area in a reference image.\nConvolute the reference image with a white circle whose intensity is uniform over a whole region. Use embedded function named ‘conv2’ for convolution as shown in the source code of the customized program line 124. Here, the radius of the white circle is slightly smaller than RD.\nFind a position that indicates a minimum value in the convolution calculation, and set this position as the center of the region of interest in the reference image.\nDetermining a radius of the region of interest",
    "Convolute the reference image with a white circle that contains a center position, determined by a procedure 4.1 and uniform intensity over a whole region. Here, RS is the radius of the white circle. Use iteration such as ‘for’ or ‘while’ with equation of a circle to make the white circle as shown in the source code of the customized program line 102 to 109.\nConvolute the reference image with another white circle which has a slightly larger radius (5%–10%), RL, than RS. Use same method with procedure 4.1.2.1 to make the circle as shown in the source code of the customized program line 113 to 120.\nObtain the difference in value between the two convolution calculations of 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.2.\nRepeat the above procedures from RS = RD/2 to RS = 2RD, by increasing both the RS and RL with a pixel level. Make an iteration that contains whole source codes from procedure 4.1.2.1 to 4.1.2.3 to repeat.\nFind the radius of RS that indicates the maximum difference in value between the two convolution calculations. Use embedded function named ‘max’ to find the radius indicates the maximum difference in value as shown in the source code of the customized program line 148 to 149. This RS thus indicates the radius of the dark area in the reference image.\nCalculation of a fractional intensity\n\t\nSet a circle that contains a center position and a radius, determined by procedure 4.1 as a region of interest.",
    "Calculate the average intensities of the region of interest in a series of fluorescence images according to time. Convolute each frame with region of interest and divide it by area of region of interest to calculate the average intensity. The details are available in the source code of the customized program which is available in JoVE website.\nCalculate a fractional intensity, defined as the equation below, where F(t) is the average intensity in the circle that is a region of interest according to time, Fi is the initial intensity in the circle, and Fo is the intensity of a white background.\nf(t) = (F(t) – Fi)/(Fo – Fi)      (Equation 1).\nFitting the fractional intensity to FRAP theory\n\t\nFit the fractional intensity with the equation below, where τ is a characteristic diffusion time and I0, I1 are modified Bessel functions, using a fitting program, and obtain τ\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53376/53376eq2.jpg      (Equation 2).\nObtain a diffusion coefficient based on the relation, τ = a2/4D, where D is the diffusion coefficient and a is the radius of the dark area.\n\t\tNote: During the fitting process, it is possible to shift the fractional intensity profile along a time axis when the recovery process has already started, before recording the images."
