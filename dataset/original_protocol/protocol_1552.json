    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe conceptual workflow of MegaGate cloning is presented in the Graphical Abstract. The Protocol has three main steps: assemble the reaction, place into thermocycler, transform and sequence colonies.\nAssemble the MegaGate reaction\nTiming: 5 min\nAll components for a MegaGate reaction are combined at once and placed into a thermocycler. The below reaction is for creation of expression vectors by reacting pENTR vectors with pMegaDestination vectors.\nAssemble the following MegaGate reaction on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1120_4.csv\nAlternatives: The same reaction can be used for MegaGate BP reactions, replacing LR Clonase II with BP Clonase II and using the appropriate AttB flanked gene insert and a pMegaDonor vector.\nCritical: If scaling MegaGate reaction down to 25 uL total, it is critical that the reagents are used in the same concentration. If using alternative endonucleases in customized vectors, the amounts and protocols will need to be optimized for the specific nuclease. A single meganuclease can additionally be used instead of two (use 2 uL instead of 1 ulL) with a resulting decrease in efficiency, as is seen in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D. Additionally, non-meganuclease enzymes such as Golden Gate Type IIS enzymes can be used effectively, as seen in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G.\nNote: If using MegaGate for pooled cloning, total pENTR vector should be 50 ng. pENTR vectors should be pooled in an equimolar fashion to minimize cloning bias (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C–2E). For best results, keep the deviation in insert size at less than 25% and be aware that smaller inserts clone more efficiently (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C–2E). Greater than 50 ng of pENTR can be utilized if needed. pENTR vector amounts of less than 10 ng will result in substantial reduction in colonies obtained. For ORFs larger than 5 KB, greater than 50 ng can be utilized to increase efficiency.",
    "Note: pMegaDestination vectors can be pooled, such as barcoded destination vectors (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C–2E). Pooled destination vectors should not exceed 75ng total to minimize background.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1120-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Utilization of MegaGate for single and pooled cloning\n(A) Depiction of representative MegaGate transformant plates versus Gateway transformant plate. A pENTR-sfGFP was used for both reactions at 50 ng. Gateway was performed according to manufacturer’s instruction using 4 ul of LR Clonase II enzyme mix and TE-8. Gateway and MegaGate were performed using 75 ng of each destination vector, which are equivalent sizes. The reactions were additionally performed utilizing the same aliquot of LR Clonase and NEB 5-alpha cells to ensure there was no bias.\n(B) Percent ORF capture (pink) measured as the ratio of input genes captured in expression vectors in a single MegaGate cloning reaction for single genes and pooled groups. Number of barcodes captured per gene (teal) for the single genes and pools was determined via NGS alignment of destination vector amplicons.",
    "(C–E) Cloning efficiency as a function of ORF length. Cloning efficiency is measured as the relative abundance of the gene in the expression vector pool divided by the relative abundance of the gene in the pENTR pool, as measured by NGS counts. Genes are arrayed by length on the x-axis. Each pool contained 300 pENTR genes, pooled by size. 50 ng of total pENTR gene were used for a single MegaGate reaction for each pool. Colonies were transformed and plated on four plates per pool and colonies were scrapped and grown overnight to obtain expression plasmids. PCR of the gene insert on the pENTR and pExpression plasmids was utilized to prepare libraries for NGS, and indexed PCR libraries were run on an Illumina MiSeq. Geneious RNA aligner was used to align reads to ORFs for each pENTR and corresponding pExpression pool and BBMap was used to call barcodes for each ORF read in the expression pool.\nThermocycle the MegaGate reaction\nTiming: 2 h and 20 min\nThis step performs the MegaGate reaction entirely within a thermocycler.\nInsert the assembled MegaGate reaction into thermocycler with the following settings.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1120_5.csv\nNote: If using custom nucleases not listed in KRT, the manufacturer recommended cutting temperature should be utilized instead of 37°C. In addition, isothermal reactions at 25°C and 37°C can be utilized with a corresponding lowering in overall efficiency (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nPause point: Reaction can be stored at −20°C for later bacterial transformation or proceed directly to transformation. The reaction is stable for up to one week; however, more testing is needed to determine the stability of the reaction for greater than one week.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1120-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A and B) Cloning efficiency is determined as the number of colonies on the plus insert plate compared to the total number of colonies on the minus insert plate. Reaction conditions tested are as follows: (A) endonuclease cutting time (B) total reaction volume.\n(C) All components added at once (one step) reaction versus separate recombinase and endonuclease reactions (two step).\n(D) Units of meganuclease added.\n(E) Multi-temperature reactions versus isothermal.\n(F) Number of restriction sites on MegaDestination vector.\n(G) Meganuclease versus Type IIS endonuclease.\n(H) Gateway BP reaction versus MegaGate BP reaction colonies obtained.\nTransform and sequence the MegaGate reaction\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step performs the transformation of the reaction into NEB 5-Alpha bacteria, with subsequent incubation and colony picking.\nTransform 2 uL of the finished MegaGate reaction into 10 uL of NEB 5-Alpha cells according to manufacturer’s instructions. https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/high-efficiency-transformation-protocol-c2987[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/0001/01/01/high-efficiency-transformation-protocol-c2987].\nNote: Any standard bacterial strain can be used for cloning and propagation.\nPlate reaction onto LB agar plate with proper antibiotic and grow 14–16 h at 37°C.\nPick single colonies for individual cloning reactions or alternatively scrape plates for library preparations.\nGrow colonies in liquid broth (LB) media with antibiotic 12–16 h at 37°C to propagate plasmids.\nHarvest plasmids from bacteria using plasmid preparation kits such as QIAPrep Spin MiniSpin kit.\nSequence plasmids using Sanger sequencing or NGS to confirm insertion. If using barcoded versions of MegaDestinations from Kramme et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] or this paper, one can use the ORF-BC_Rev primer in the KRT for Sanger sequencing to identify the barcode and inserted gene simultaneously."
