    "NOTE: It is recommended that all of the proceeding steps be conducted under sterile conditions.\n1. Soybean seed sterilization\nIn a biosafety cabinet, place 16-20 round Williams 82 soybean seeds in pristine condition (i.e., no cracks or blemishes) in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 30 mL of 70% isopropyl alcohol, gently shake for 30 s, and then decant the alcohol.\nGently shake the seeds with 30 mL of 10% bleach for 10 s and allow the seeds to sit in the solution for 5 min at room temperature (RT, 25 °C). After 5 min, drain the bleach.\nRepeat the shaking three times with 30 mL of sterile ultrapure H2O for 1 min per rinse and discard the H2O between each rinse.\nPlace the sterilized seeds on filter paper saturated with 5 mL of germination and co-cultivation (GC) medium (autoclave half-strength liquid Murashige and Skoog [MS] medium with 1% sucrose [pH = 5.8] and then add 2.5 mL/L vitamins) in sterile Petri dishes.\nPlace the plates in the dark at RT (25 °C) for 3 days before transferring the plates at 22 °C under 16 h cool-white T5 fluorescent lights (100 µE m-2·s-1) for 4 days to allow the seeds to germinate.\n\t​NOTE: Discard seeds that are wrinkled or cracked. The best seeds are those that are large and uniformly yellow. Sterilize at least double the number of seeds required for the experiment to select seeds of good quality, as some seeds may not be optimal due to damage, diseases, or failure to germinate.\n2. Infection of cotyledons with K599\nNOTE: Use pGWB series vectors, as their dual selection ensures genomic integration of the entire T-DNA cassette. Electroporation was used to transform a binary vector harboring the gene of interest into A. rhizogenes pRi265918.",
    "Based on the sequence of the A. rhizogenes pRi2659 plasmid18, design primers to detect the Ti plasmid gene VirD2 (VirD2 forward: 5'-CCCGATCGAGCTCAAGTTAT-3'; VirD2 reverse: 5'-TCGTCTGGCTGACTTTCGT-3'; expected amplification size: 221 bp). Following transformation, test the Agrobacterium colonies for the retention of VirD2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a PCR Kit (see Table of Materials). PCR cycle: 94 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 30 sec, 72 °C for 1 min); and 72 °C for 10 min.\nFollowing the selection of the A. rhizogenes colony that contains both VirD2 and the gene of interest (GOI), streak out some onto Luria-Bertani (LB) medium plates containing the appropriate antibiotics (50 mg/L) for the plasmid of interest and incubate overnight at 30 °C. If using spectinomycin, add a concentration of 100 mg/L.\nUse a P200 pipette tip to scrape off a ~1.5 cm length of the K599 Agrobacterium from the LB plates and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of phosphate buffer (PB; 0.01 M Na2HPO4, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5).\nDilute the Agrobacterium in sterilized, ultrapure H2O (v/v = 1:1) and acetosyringone (AS; 100 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], v/v = 1:1000). Measure the absorbance using a cuvette tube at an optical density of 600 nm (OD600). The expected optimal range is between 0.5 and 0.8.\nIn a biosafety cabinet, dip a sterilized scalpel in the K599 Agrobacterium solution and make several 1 mm deep cuts along the inner surface (adaxial, flat side) of the cotyledon. During the inoculation, use sterilized forceps to stabilize the cotyledon.\nPlace about 6-8 cotyledons cut side-down on a Petri dish containing filter paper saturated with GC medium with AS.",
    "NOTE: To prepare 6 plates, 50 mL of GC medium and 50 µL of 100 mM AS to achieve a final concentration of 100 µM is sufficient.\nIncubate the plates at RT (25 °C) for 3 days under a 16 h photoperiod (~65 µE).\nTransfer the infected cotyledons to hairy root growth (HRG) plates (autoclave half-strength MS with 3% sucrose [pH = 5.8] and 2.6 g/L Gelzan, then add 2.5 mL/L vitamins mixture and 500 mg/L timentin).\n\tNOTE: There were some issues with timentin from some alternative vendors, of which the K599 was not eliminated. It is recommended to use taller Petri dish plates (100 mm x 25 mm) for HRG medium.\nIncubate the HRG plates at 22 °C in a growth chamber with the parameters set to 100 µE light on a 16 h photoperiod until primary roots with secondary roots 2-3 cm in length are observed (~3-4 weeks).\n3. Selection and harvesting of HRs\nHarvest primary roots (5-7 cm in length) that grow from the callus and contain secondary roots (2-3 cm in length) using a sterile scalpel and forceps. Transfer to selection HRG plates containing the appropriate antibiotics. Let the HRs grow for 5 more days on the selection HRG plates.\n\tNOTE: Kanamycin (50 mg/L), hygromycin (50 mg/L), or phosphinothricin (10 mg/L) are typically used for selection. For expression vectors, pGWB2 is used for overexpression, pANDA35HK is used for RNAi silencing, pGWB6 is used for subcellular localization, and pMDC7 is used for inducible expression.",
    "On day 5, harvest transgenic HRs with secondary roots 3-6 cm in length. If observing fluorescent proteins, the secondary roots have little autofluorescence. If performing elicitor or chemical treatments, cut the secondary roots into 1 cm pieces and place ~100 mg on HRG agar in a pile. Then, saturate the piles with 80 µL of the appropriate treatment and allow the plates to incubate at RT (25 °C).\nAfter the desired treatment time, proceed with RNA or metabolite extractions.\nFor RNA, rapidly dab the roots dry on a sterilized paper towel and harvest them directly into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nImmediately seal the top of the tube using parafilm, make two small holes using pointed forceps, and submerge the tubes in liquid nitrogen. Lyophilize for 3 days, then store the samples at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: It is essential to select HRs that are white. After 5 days of growth on the selective plate, transgenic HRs will remain white, but non-transgenic roots will turn brown.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
