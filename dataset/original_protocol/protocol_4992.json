    "Prepare growing mediumDissolve 4.3 g L-1 of MS, 1.0 ml of mix A (see Recipes) and 30 g L-1 of sucrose in distilled water. Adjust the pH of the solution to 5.7 ± 0.1 with NaOH (0.1 N).Distribute the solution in bottles for autoclaving.Autoclave the solution at 105 °C for 5 min.Dissolve 9.0 g L-1 of agar to solidify the medium.Even with the warm medium and by means of syringes, dispense 25 ml of the solution into the culture tubes and cover it.Autoclave the racks containing tubes for 15 min at 115 °C.Let it cool down and store at room temperature.Plant material preparationRemove the coats of the seeds to increase and homogenize seed germination. Avoid damaging the seeds; especially pay attention not to injure the embryo (Figure 1). Disinfect the seeds by putting them into a sodium hypochlorite solution (50.0%, v/v) plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween® 20 for 10 min.Rinse the seeds three times with sterile distilled water in order to remove hypochlorite solution.Store the seeds in a sterile laminar flow hood preventing dehydration. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161214/20161214021310_4444.jpgFigure 1. Example of seeds coat removal for increasing the rate and homogenization of germinationGermination and growing conditionsWorking in a sterile laminar flow hood and by means of a sterile tweezer, place one seed per tube in the solidified growing medium and cover the tubes after sown (Figure 2A). Once seeds are sown place racks into a growing chamber for two weeks maintained at 25 °C and darkness to promote germination (Figure 2B). After two weeks, transfer the etiolated seedlings (of about 5 cm in large at that time) to a lighted growth chamber. Set photoperiod conditions of 16:8 h (light:dark), temperature of 25 °C and a minimum radiation of 150 µmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (Figure 2C).",
    "After three weeks under light conditions when plants have grown and turned to green coloration, shoot needs to be removed. In the sterile laminar flow hood plants are detached from shoot by means of long-handled scissors (Figure 3). Do this under sterile conditions in the laminar flow hood. Shoots are removed by cutting about 5 mm below of the root/shoot junction, keeping the remaining root inside the medium to avoid future shoot regrowth (Figure 2D). Tubes containing root tissues are maintained for at least two days prior to experiments are performed to exclude any side-effect of wounding (Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161214/20161214021450_8929.jpgFigure 2.
