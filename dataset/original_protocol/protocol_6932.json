    "Please note that gloves must be used throughout the handling procedures. Preparation of rosettesPrepare parasite cultures of rosette-forming parasites (see \"Plasmodium falciparum Rosette formation assay[href=http://www.bio-protocol.org/e412]\", sections 1 and 2). Prepare enough material to perform each assay in triplicate: Each assay requires 3 x 40 μl rosette-rich suspension at 2% haematocrit (see 1.i-j.). This corresponds to an initial 20 μl culture at 6-8% parasitemia i.e. approx. Harvest the cultures of rosette-forming parasites at mature trophozoite to schizont stages (5- 10% parasitaemia). Avoid late or segmented schizonts, which form loose rosettes.Enrich for rosettes by centrifugation on ice-cold Ficoll (see \"Plasmodium falciparum Rosette formation assay[href=http://www.bio-protocol.org/e412]\"- section 2). Rosette disruption assays are best carried out with parasite cultures with more than 50% rosette frequency. Spin down the cells by centrifugation in the Fisher Scientific Heraeus Multifuge for 10 min at 256 x g (1,200 rpm), room temperature.Discard the supernatant by aspiration using a 1 ml aspiration sterile pipette connected to a vacuum pump. Gently resuspend the rosette-rich pellet (some rosettes tend to be disrupted by simple mechanical handling, avoid back and forth harsh pipetting) in 4 ml pre-warmed CCM (see Recipes) supplemented with 10 μg/ml Hoechst. Mix gently and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C in the dark in an incubator with continuous gazing (5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2).Wash once with CCM: Add 900 μl CCM, centrifuge 3 min at 256 x g (1,200 rpm), in the Fisher Scientific Heraeus Multifuge at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet at 2% haematocrit in CCM (2 volumes (vol.) cell pellet + 98 vol. CCM). Parasitaemia of the preparation is usually around 5%.Dispense 40 μl aliquots of the rosette-rich RBC suspension in 1.4 matrix round bottom tubes.",
    "Centrifuge, in the Fisher Scientific Heraeus Multifuge 5 min at 178 x g (1,000 rpm) room temperature.Discard the supernatant and process the pellet as described in section 2 or 3. Prepare serial dilutions (0.1 μg/ml - 1 mg/ml) of heparin, dextran sulfate, fucoidan or other sulphated glycans in CCM.Prepare serial dilutions of sera, plasma (starting dilution 1/5) or purified mAbs or immunoglobulin preparations in CCM as diluent. Include negative controls such as CCM alone and non-immune serum (or Ig) and a positive control with sera or mAbs able to disrupt rosettes.Dissociation assay with sulphated glycansAdd 100 μl diluted sulphated glycan to the rosette preparation (section 1-j).Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C (use an incubator rather than water-bath).Remove 60 μl of medium and resuspend the sedimented pellet in the remaining volume.Take a 10 μl aliquot, put it onto a microscope slide and add a cover slip.Count under the microscope 100-200 iRBCs and score iRBCs engaged in rosettes (i.e. trophozoite or schizont stages having bound two or more uninfected RBCs) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130411/20130411064139_9747.jpg Figure 1. Rosette dissociation assay before A and after B incubation with 10 μg/ml dextran sulphate.Calculate the rosetting rate = (No. mature stage iRBCs engaged in rosettes/No. mature stages) x 100. Calculate the dissociation rate = (rosetting rate of control culture without inhibitor - rosetting rate of treated sample/rosetting rate of control culture without inhibitor) x 100.Dissociation assay with immune reagentsPrepare serial dilutions of sera, plasma (starting dilution 1/5) or purified mAbs or immunoglobulin preparations to be tested. Include negative controls such as CCM alone and non-immune serum (or Ig) and a positive control with sera or mAbs able to disrupt rosettes.Add 40 μl diluted serum or plasma to the rosette preparation (section 1-n).Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C (use an incubator rather than water-bath).",
    "Resuspend the sedimented pellet in the incubation medium.Take a 10 μl aliquot, put it onto a microscope slide and add a cover slip. Count under the microscope, 100-200 iRBCs and score iRBCs engaged in rosettes. Calculate the rosetting rate = (No. mature stage iRBCs engaged in rosettes/No. mature stages) x 100. Calculate the dissociation rate = (rosetting rate of control culture incubated with non immune reagent - rosetting rate of treated sample/rosetting rate of control culture incubated with non immune reagent) x 100.Note that at certain dilutions, polyclonal immune reagents (and IgM mAbs) tend to disrupt rosettes and agglutinate iRBCs. Immune agglutinates are easily visualised as densely packed iRBCs (see Figure 2). Dissociation is readily visualised at higher dilutions. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130411/20130411064431_2301.jpgFigure 2. Agglutination of rosette-forming iRBCs obtained after incubation with mouse polyclonal antibodies directed against a PfEMP1-derived surface exposed domain (dilution 1/40). The iRBC nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 and cells were examined by light A and UV B microscopy."
