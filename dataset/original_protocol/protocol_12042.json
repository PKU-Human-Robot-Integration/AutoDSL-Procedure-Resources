    "All methods described here were developed under National Research Council guidelines found in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and have been approved by the Utah State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nNOTE: Ovarian transplantation procedures may involve mice (CBA/J strain) from 21 days of age to 18 months of age. Mice of the CBA/J strain become reproductively competent between 45 and 60 days of age and reproductively senescent between 10 and 12 months of age.\n1. Transplantation of intact ovaries to aged mice\nNOTE: This first protocol describes the procedure used during the transfer of ovaries from a young mouse (60 days of age) to a postreproductive female (12 months of age) of the same inbred strain. The same procedure is used for ovarian transplantation between any two female mice.\nWeigh and anesthetize the donor animal by intraperitoneal (I.P., 27 ga needle) injection, for example using a cocktail of ketamine, xylazine and acepromazine (65 mg/kg ketamine, 13 mg/kg xylazine 2.0 mg/kg, acepromazine; cocktail dose - 6.5 ml/kg). Return the animal to the heated home cage until the anesthesia has taken effect.\nOnce anesthetized, remove the animal from the home cage and place on heated paper towels. Using clippers (#40 blade preferred), remove the hair a few mm lateral to midline on each side, starting just below the ribs and moving distally, preparing a clipped 'patch' approximately 2-3 cm square on either side of the prone mouse leaving a strip of hair approximately 1-2 cm covering the midline.\nLightly wipe the clipped areas with 70% ethanol and, apply betadine solution to the clipped site with a cotton-tipped swab.",
    "Apply antibiotic gel for eye protection and administer meloxicam (2.0 mg/kg) subcutaneously (S.C., 27 ga needle) on the lateral aspect of the animal's neck for postoperative pain relief.\nPlace the animal in prone position on a heated sterile surgical field, and wipe the clipped area with a 70% ethanol-soaked 2 cm x 2 cm cotton gauze.\nMake a 1.0-1.5 cm paralumbar incision and bluntly dissect the skin from the underlying fascia. Make another incision through the fascia. Bluntly dissect laterally under this fascia as superficially as possible until reaching the abdominal cavity\nPlace a small surgical drape over the incision (cut from 2 cm x 2 cm gauze) and wet the drape with sterile saline.\nUsing small forceps, locate the adipose tissue that surrounds the ovary in the abdominal cavity and gently extract the fat pad and ovary and place it on the wetted gauze drape. The ovarian fat pad will appear more 'white' than the surrounding adipose tissue.\nPlace a 1.5 inch Bulldog clamp on the fat pad (taking care not to obstruct the ovarian bursa) to hold the tract in place during the procedure.\nMove the dissecting microscope into place and clearly identify the ovarian bursa. Grasp the bursa with two watchmaker forceps and incise the ovarian bursa opposite the ovarian hilum to expose the ovary. If the intended access area of the bursa is highly vascularized, apply a drop of epinephrine (1:100,000) with a syringe to the bursal surface to reduce bleeding at the time of tearing.\nGently remove the ovary from the ovarian bursa and excise the ovary by clamping at the ovarian hilum with a watchmaker forceps to prevent bleeding.",
    "Place the donor ovary in watch glass filled with 4° C sterile saline, loosely cover and set aside until ready for transplantation. Ideally, place the watch glass under an additional dissecting microscope so that the ovaries can be easily grasped by the surgeon at the time of transplantation.\nAt this point, either euthanize or set aside the donor mouse (must be continuously monitored) to receive a transplanted ovary, tissue, cells or a placeholder glass bead at a later time point.\nWith a clean surgical field and instruments, ovariectomize the recipient animal as above. Older mice tend to have an increased amount of adipose tissue and may require an increased anesthetic dose (up to 20%).\nAfter excision of the ovary from the recipient, place a small piece of hemostatic foam pad inside the empty bursa to control bleeding and aid in clotting and place a small piece of saline-soaked gauze over the exposed site.\nLocate a donor ovary (or tissue, cells, placeholder glass bead) with a watchmaker forceps in one hand and move into the microscope field-of-view. With another forceps in the opposite hand, remove the gauze and simultaneously remove the hemostatic foam pad from the bursa while placing the new ovary inside the bursa.\nIf the new ovary does not fit inside the recipient bursa, cut the donor ovary in half (or 1/3 or 1/4) and place into the bursa in pieces. If the bursa does not completely cover the entire ovary, place a suture through the bursa, through the ovary and back through the bursa to hold the ovary in place (see Discussion section).\n\tNOTE: The glass place-holder beads can be difficult to handle with watchmaker's forceps.",
    "When placing a glass bead inside the bursa, pick up the bead with larger forceps and drop on top of the fat pad next to the ovarian bursa. Roll the bead into the bursa.\nPick up a Castroviejo needle holder already loaded with a tapered needle and 9-0 or 10-0 monofilament suture, locate the torn edge of the bursa and close the bursa using one or two Halsted sutures.\n\tNOTE: Suturing can alternatively be performed with watchmaker or other small forceps.\nIrrigate the site lightly with sterile saline, remove the fat-pad clamp and return the ovary/fat pad to the abdomen.\nRemove the drape and close the abdominal wall with 6-0 chromic gut or vicryl. This step can be done with or without the microscope.\nMove the microscope aside (if not moved in the previous step) and close the skin with 9 mm wound clips.\nPlace the animal in a heated recovery cage shaded from light and monitor the animal continuously until recovery from anesthesia. Additional meloxicam may be used 24 hours post-operatively if indicated. Remove the wound clips approximately nine days post-operatively.\n\tNOTE: No immunosuppressive techniques are employed and no evidence of graft-versus-host disease has been detected post-transplantation or at death.\n2. Transplantation of germ cell depleted ovaries to intact mice.",
    "NOTE: This protocol involves the transfer of ovaries from a young, germ cell-depleted mouse to a postreproductive female. In this protocol, the ovary recipients and the ovariectomy and transplantation procedures are as above with the exception that the transplanted ovaries have been chemically depleted of primordial and primary follicles/germ cells. Remaining secondary and antral follicles will undergo recruitment/atresia leaving the ovary devoid of germ cells. Germ cell depletion with 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) is well described16. VCD is a toxin. Because the VCD-treated ovaries are being transplanted to a non-treated mouse, this procedure benefits from a VCD-treated ovary in a mouse not exposed to the toxic effects of VCD. This protocol describes the procedure for germ cell-depletion in young, ovary-donor mice.\nDilute VCD (64 mg/mL) in sesame oil for injection and store at 4° C until use.\nInject ovary donors once a day with VCD I.P. (160 mg/kg) for 15 days beginning at 28 days of age. Inject control mice with sesame oil following the same schedule.\nAt 50 days of age, check VCD-treated and oil-only-treated mice for cessation of reproductive cyclicity for 10 days as above. At 60 days of age, VCD-treated mice should display no cytological evidence of gonadal input.\nRecover ovaries from 60-day-old mice and transplant as above.\nDetermine successful transplantation of germ cell-depleted ovaries by detection of a lack of reproductive cycling and increased levels of circulating androstenedione. Androgen:Estrogen ratios increase significantly after germ cell depletion with VCD17.\nInitiate vaginal cytology 10-14 days postoperatively and collect data for at least 10 consecutive days to ensure accurate determination of cyclicity.\nSubscription Required.
