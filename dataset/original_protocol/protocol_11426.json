    "All clinical specimens were obtained following the guidelines of Institutional Review Board.\n1. Buffer Preparation\nMake 200 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) pH 8.0).\nMake 200 mL of STE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl).\nMake 200 mL of 2.0 M glycine (37.52 g of glycine in 200 mL of water) and heat it to 65 °C.\nMake 200 mL of 5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) solution (10 g of DOC in 200 mL of water).\nMake 500 mL of ChIP harvest buffer (12 mM Tris-Cl, 0.1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 6 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)).\nMake 500 mL of ChIP dilution buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% DOC, 1% Triton-X, 1 mM EDTA).\nMake 500 mL of RIPA wash buffer (STE, 1% Triton x-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% DOC).\nMake 500 mL of RIPA/500 wash buffer (RIPA buffer + 360 mM NaCl).\nMake 500 mL of LiCL wash buffer (TE, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% DOC).\nMake 500 mL of Direct Elution buffer: 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS.\nMake 50 mL of Antibody Binding/Blocking buffer (PBS + 0.1% TWEEN-20 + 0.2% IgG-free BSA).\n2. Tissue/cell Line Processing and Cross-linking\nIf tissue is flash frozen, dethaw it on ice prior to dissociation.\nDisassociate 50 mg of tissue (~8 mg per histone modification antibody) manually in 2 mL of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) using a sterile razor blade. Mince the tissue into 3 to 4 mm pieces for approximately 5 min in a sterile tissue culture dish.\nTransfer the tissue and HBSS solution into a dissociator tube and add another 8 mL of HBSS. Further disassociate the tissue using a dissociator until homogenized.",
    "For melanoma tumors, place the tubes in a dissociator and run the following cycles each one time in this order: h_tumor_01.01, h_tumor_02.01, h_tumor_03.01 and m_heart_02.01.\nScrape 21 × 106 cells in 10 mL of medium (~3 × 106 per histone modification and input; it can be lowered to 100,000 cells per mark for rare populations) grown in a standard tissue culture dish and collect them in a 15 mL conical tube.\n\tNote: The media used for representative melanoma cell line WM115 is DMEM supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 5% penicillin/streptomycin.\nCrosslink the tissue/cells using a 1% final formaldehyde concentration by adding 200 µL of 16% formaldehyde per 3 mL HBBS for tissue (or 3 mL of medium for cells). Shake the mixture at 10 rpm using a mixer for exactly 10 min at 37 °C.\n\tCaution: Formaldehyde is toxic and should be handled in an appropriate fume hood.\nAdd 200 µL of 2.0 M glycine per 3 mL of sample and continue shaking at 10 rpm for another 5 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Glycine acts as a quencher. Make fresh glycine solution every month as the pH pf the solution tends over time.\nSpin the samples at 934 x g for 5 min at 4 °C using a benchtop centrifuge. Remove the supernatant, add 5 mL of ice cold PBS, centrifuge the samples again at 934 x g and remove the supernatant.\nFlash freeze the pellet and store it at -80 °C for further processing.\n3. Tissue Lysis, Sonication, and Antibody Preparation\nDissolve 1 protease inhibitor tablet per 10 mL of ChIP harvest buffer.\nAdd 300 µL of ChIP harvest buffer with protease inhibitors per 50 mg of tissue and allow 30 min of lysis on ice.",
    "NOTE: Add 300 µL of ChIP harvest buffer with protease inhibitors per 1 X 107 of WM115 melanoma cell lines.\nWhile the cells are lysing, turn on the the waterbath disruptor and associated cooling system and allow temperature to reach 4 °C. Place the sonicator tubes in the waterbath disruptor and sonicate the melanoma tissues for 60 cycles at 30 s on and 30 s off to obtain chromatin fragments of ~200 - 600 base pairs (bp).\n\tNOTE: Sonication time can differ between tissue type and should be adjusted accordingly. This is a critical step and should be optimized in pilot experiment before proceeding to immunoprecipitation.\nDuring sonication, wash 20 µL of protein G magnetic beads per antibody per sample three times using 1000 µL of binding/blocking buffer (PBS + 0.1% TWEEN-20 + 0.2% BSA).\nFor ~8 mg of melanoma tissue, incubate 3 µg of each histone antibody in 100 µL of binding/ blocking buffer for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation using a tube revolver. 12 samples for a singular antibody contain 240 µL of beads, 36 µg of antibody and 1200 µL of binding/blocking buffer.\n\tNOTE: For 3 × 106 cells, use 5 µg of each antibody and 30 µL of Protein G magnetic beads per antibody. Antibody and Protein-G beads should be titrated if different amount of tissue is being used. This protocol illustrates immunoprecipitation conditions for the described six histone modifications (Table of Materials), however, antibody concentrations should be optimized for other modifications and transcription factors.",
    "To determine fragment size, remove 20 µL of sonciated chromatin solution and add an elution buffer master mix (room temperature) containing 44 µL of direct elution buffer, 1 µL of RNase (20mg/mL), and 5 µL Proteinase K (20mg/mL) per sample. Incubate the samples in a PCR thermal cycler for at least 2 h at 50 °C. Purify the sample using a PCR purification kit following the manufacturers instructions.\nEnsure chromatin is sufficiently sheared by determining fragment size using a high sensitivity DNA electropherogram instrument before proceeding to step 3.6. Turn on the electropherogram instrument.\nLoad 2 µL of high sensitivity buffer reagent into each well of an 8-well optical tube strip. Load 2 µL of high sensitivity ladder into the first well and 2 µL of purified samples in the remaining wells.\nPlace optical tube caps on tube stips and vortex the samples at 2000 rpm for 1 min. Open the lid and insert a new high sensitivity screen tape and box of loading tips. Remove the strip caps and load the samples into electropherogram instrument.\nOpen analysis software, highlight the first thirteen spaces on the screen tape and press the Start tab in the bottom right corner. Chromatin fragments ranging between ~200 - 1000 bp are suitable for ChIP.\nTransfer the sonicated solution to sterile tubes and spin the tubes at 21,130 x g using a table top centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to new tubes.\nDetermine the total volume of the supernatant and remove 10% of the total solution for Input control and store it at 4 °C.\n4. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation\nDissolve 2 protease inhibitor tablets per 20 mL of ChIP dilution buffer.",
    "After sonication dilute the remaining sample 5 times using ChIP dilution buffer to bring the SDS levels down to 0.1%. Dilute 270 µL of remaining supernatant with 1080 µL of ChIP dilution buffer to obtain a final total volume of 1350 µL.\nWhen the incubation of antibody and protein G magnetic beads finishes, place the tube on a magnet and remove the supernatant.\nWith the tube still sitting on the magnet, wash the beads once by adding 750 µL of ChIP dilution buffer with protease inhibitors.\n\tNOTE: It is important not to disturb the beads or rotate the tubes during this step.\nRemove ChIP dilution buffer wash and resuspend the beads in 240 µL of the same ChIP dilution buffer. Aliquot 20 µL of beads into 12 separate tubes, each of which is used for a separate tissue sample.\nAliquot the sonicated material evenly to protein G beads with specific antibody and tumble using a tube revolver overnight at 4 °C.\n5. Washing and Reverse Crosslinking of Immunoprecipitated DNA-protein Complexes\nThe next morning after reverse crosslinking, transfer the antibody-protein solution to a 96-well plate and place it on the magnetic stand. Allow the beads to adhere for at least 30 s and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads 5 times with 150 µL of ice-cold RIPA wash buffer using a multi-channel pipet. During the wash steps, do not pipet the beads, but move the magnet continuously from right to left for 30 s per wash.\nWash the samples twice with 150 µL of ice-cold RIPA-500 wash buffer.\nWash the samples twice with 150 µL of ice-cold LiCl wash buffer.\nWash the samples once with 150 µL of ice-cold TE wash buffer and remove TE buffer immediately. This step can be omitted for low input applications.",
    "Add Input control from step 3.7 into fresh wells of the 96-well plate containing the ChIP DNA samples.\nAfter the washing steps, add an elution buffer master mix (room temperature) containing 44 µL of direct elution buffer, 1 µL of RNase (20mg/mL) and 5 µL Proteinase K (20mg/mL) per ChIP and Input sample for reverse crosslinking.\nIncubate the samples using a PCR thermal cycler for 4 h at 37 °C, 4 h at 50 °C and 8 - 16 h at 65 °C.\n6. Purification and Quantification of Precipitated DNA\nThe next morning, place the samples back on the magnet and transfer supernatant to a new 96-well PCR plate which contains the immunoprecipitated DNA.\nAdd 2.3x paramagnetic beads to solution (115 µL for 50 µL of solution) and carefully pipet up and down 25 times using a multichannel pipet. The solution will become homogenous if properly mixed.\nIncubate the solution at room temperature off the magnet for 4 min. Place the samples back on the magnet and incubate at room temperature for another 4 min. Discard the supernatant.\nWhile leaving the samples on the magnet, add 150 µL of 70% ethanol (vol/vol) and incubate at room temperature for 30 s without disturbing the beads.\nRemove the ethanol and repeat the wash. Allow the paramagnetic beads to air dry on the magnet for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Remove all the ethanol after the second wash as remaining ethanol will interfere with purification.\nRemove the samples from the magnet and add 30 µL of 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0. Mix by pipetting 25 times and incubate the samples at room temperature off the magnet for 4 min.",
    "Place the samples back on the magnet and incubate at room temperature for another 4 min. Transfer 20 µL of each sample to a new 96-well plate for library preparation. Store the remaining 10 µL of ChIP DNA in case of any potential issues with generation of the libraries.\nAt this stage, quantify ChIP DNA before library preparation. The DNA concentration is measured with high-sensitivity DNA reagents. Determine the size distribution of precipitated DNA using a high sensitivity DNA electropherogram instrument proceeding to step 7.1.\n7. Library Generation using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit\nGenerate libraries for NGS sequencing using DNA Library Preparation following the recommended protocol from the manufacturer. All the reactions are performed in 96-well plates and incubations are performed in a PCR thermal cycler with the lid temperature set > 100 °C and the volume set at 50 µL.\nFor indexes, Multiplex Oligos for NGS platform are used. Perform a total of 10x cycles for PCR amplification using the following settings: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing/extension at 65 °C for 30 s (10x cycles), final extension 65 °C for 5 min and hold at 4°C.\n\tNOTE: Table 1 contains the primers used for PCR amplification.\nAfter PCR amplification, remove the samples and bring total volume to 100 µL using nuclease-free water. Perform double-sided paramagnetic size selection (0.55x/0.8x) by first adding 55 µL of beads and mix by pipetting 25 times. Incubate the samples at room temperature off the magnet for 4 min.\nPlace the samples back on a magnet and incubate at room temperature for another 4 min. This step is used to retain large fragments on the beads that are unsuitable for sequencing.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a new 96-well PCR plate. Do not discard supernatant as this contains partially purified DNA.\nAdd another 25 µL of paramagnetic beads and mix by pipetting 25 times and incubate at room temperature off the magnet for 4 min.\nPlace samples back on the magnet and incubate at room temperature for another 4 min and discard the supernatant. This step is used to retain fragments of ~200 to 600 bp that will be used for finalized libraries.\nWhile leaving the samples on the magnet, add 150 µL of 70% ethanol (v/v) and allow incubating for 30 s without disturbing the beads (do not move while on the magnet). Remove the ethanol and repeat the wash a second time.\nAllow the paramagnetic beads to air dry on the magnet for 5 min. Remove all ethanol after the second wash as remaining ethanol will interfere with purification.\nRemove the samples from the magnet and add 25 µL of 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0. Mix by pipetting 25 times and incubate at room temperature off the magnet for 4 min. Place the samples back on the magnet and incubate at room temperature for another 4 min.\nQuantify libraries using a high sensitivity DNA electropherogram instrument before multiplexing to ensure sizes are suitable for sequencing. Completed libraries range between 200 - 600 bp and are devoid of all primer dimers.\n\tNOTE: If necessary, another 0.7x paramagnetic bead purification is performed to remove unwanted primer dimers that are present at ~130 bp.",
    "Pool the quantified DNA based on unique index primers according to concentration. For a pool containing six samples with concentrations between 1 ng/µL and 6ng/µL, the distribution is 15 µL of the lowest sample and 2.5 µL of the highest sample. This is done to ensure read counts will be evenly distributed on each lane of the flow cell.\n8.
