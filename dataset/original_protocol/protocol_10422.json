    "1. Preparation of Reagents\nPrepare 1 mM HEPES Buffer dissolving 23.8 mg of HEPES in 100 ml of distilled water. Adjust the pH to 7.\nPrepare 10% NaHSO3 dissolving 10 g of NaHSO3 in 100 ml of distilled water. Stir the mixture for 15 min.\nPrepare NaOH solution dissolving 1 g of NaOH in 100 ml of water. Stir for 10 min.\nPrepare 10 mM Phosphate buffer dissolving 600 mg of NaH2PO4 in 1 L of water. Add carefully 0.34 ml of phosphoric acid and Stir for 30 min. Adjust the pH to 2.9 (acceptance range 2.7-3.0).\nPrepare 10 mM Phosphate buffer dissolving 269 mg of NaH2PO4 and 1.09 g of Na2HPO4 to distilled water to make a volume of 1 L. Adjust the pH to 7.2.\n2. Synthesis of Oleic Acid Coated Nanoparticles (OA-IONP)\nIn a microwave adapted flask add 0.5 g of Fe(acac)3, 1.4 ml of oleic acid, 0.6 ml of oleylamine and 1.19 g of 1,2-hexadodecanediol. Add 10 ml of phenyl ether carefully through the flask wall using a graduated pipette.\nIntroduce the flask in the microwave reactor and start the microwave protocol.\n\tNOTE: Microwave software enables choosing the magnitude for different parameters like temperature, pressure, stirring speed, power and reaction time. Moreover, it has the possibility to load three different stages in the same protocol allowing tunable synthesis. Once the loaded synthetic protocol starts, microwave heats the sample as fast as possible (ramping process) and maintains it during the chosen reaction time (running process). Election of power determines the time of ramping.\nLoad a dynamic study in the microwave. The protocol contains three stages:\n\t\nStage 1: set the temperature to 60 °C, time 2 min, pressure 250 psi and 150 W of power. Stir speed has to be in high position and max power in on.",
    "Stage 2: set the temperature to 200 °C, time 20 min, pressure 250 psi and 300 W of power. Stir speed has to be in high position and max power in on.\nStage 3: set the temperature to 250 °C, time 10 min, pressure 250 psi and 300 W of power. Stir speed has to be in high position and max power in on.\nAfter finishing the protocol, allow the flask to cool at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Cooling down process can be done with or without gas stream. Both cases provide same results. Aggregates appear in the stir bar and in the wall of the flask, wash it with EtOH and put it onto the Erlenmeyer.\nTransfer the reaction mixture to an Erlenmeyer using a glass pipette and add 10 ml of EtOH 98%. Put a Nd-Nb-B magnet below the flask, wait 5 min and remove the supernatant with a glass pipette.\nAdd 10 ml of EtOH, sonicate the sample at RT for 2 min and 40 kHz, put the sample on the magnet and eliminate the supernatant. Repeat this step at least three times.\nDisperse oleic nanoparticles in 30 ml of CHCl3 and sonicate at 40 kHz for 5 min at RT. Check the hydrodynamic size in the zetasizer as per manufacturer's instructions. Put 0.5 ml of OA-IONP in the glass cuvette and add 0.5 ml of CHCl3. Acceptance range 7-10 nm expressed as Z-average size in intensity.\n\tNOTE: OA-IONP can be well-dispersed in hexane.\n3. Synthesis of Azelaic Acid Nanoparticles (Azelaic Acid-IONP)\nDissolve 44.3 mg of KMnO4 and 150.4 mg of BTACl in a mixture of H2O:CHCl3 (3:2 ml). Add the resultant solution to a 5 ml aliquot of OA-IONP in the microwave adapted flask.",
    "Start the microwave protocol for Azelaic acid-IONP. Set temperature at 105 °C, time 9 min, pressure 250 psi and power at 300 W. Put 10 ml of phosphate buffer pH = 2.9 into the flask and repeat the microwave protocol. After cooling step, recover the nanoparticles using a magnet and eliminate the supernatant.\nAdd 5 ml of 10% NaHSO3 to an Erlenmeyer flask, sonicate at 40 kHz for 2 min at 25 °C, collect the particles using a magnet and eliminate the supernatant. (The step is repeated 2 times.) Wash the nanoparticles three more times with 1% NaOH and finally re-disperse it in 5 ml of phosphate buffer pH = 7.2.\nCheck the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential. Put 0.7 ml of Azelaic-IONP into the disposable folded capillary cell and insert it onto the zetasizer.\n\tNOTE: Acceptance range for size 25-35 nm expressed as Z-average size in intensity. Acceptance range for Z-Potential -45 ± 5 mV. Larger nanoparticles (~70 nm) can be obtained with phosphate buffer pH >7 instead pH = 2.9 (ref Chem Eur J 2008).\n4. Synthesis of Neridronate Nanoparticles (Neridronate-IONP)\nAdd 12 mg of EDC and 15 mg of Sulfo-NHS in an centrifuge with 2 ml aliquot of Azelaic-IONP. Put the mixture in a vortex at RT for 35 min.\nPut a magnet below the centrifuge to destabilize the nanoparticles, aspirate the supernatant and wash the particles with 1.5 ml of HEPES 1 mM pH=7 buffer. (Repeat this step two times.) Afterwards, add 5 mg of neridronate and shake the mixture in a vortex for 2 hr.\nSeparate nanoparticles with a magnet and wash (3 x 2 ml) with 1 mM HEPES pH=7 buffer. Finally, disperse Neridronate-IONP in 2 ml of 1mM HEPES pH = 7 buffer.",
    "Check the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential. Put 0.7 ml of Neridronate-IONP into the disposable folded capillary cell and insert it onto the zetasizer (see equipment setup).\n\tNOTE: Acceptance range for size 40-45 nm expressed as Z-average size in intensity. Acceptance range for Z-Potential -20 ± 5 mV.\n5. In Vivo Detection of Atheroma Plaque in ApoE-/- Mice by MRI\nPreparation for the MRI Acquisition\n\tNOTE: Several extra systems for animal experimentation are needed. Thus, It will require:\n\t\nUse appropriate equipment to anesthetize the animals.\nObtain a close circuit-circulating warm water system with an external warm air to keep the temperature of the animal stable.\n\t\tNOTE: In this case the MRI compatible monitoring and gating system registers the temperature of the animal inside the MRI magnet.\nMonitor the external temperature in the proximity of the animal, the body (rectal thermometer) temperature of the animal, the respiration sensor located under the body of the animal near the thorax using an integrated interface in the MRI console.\nMRI Experiment\n\t\nAnesthetize the animals with vaporized isoflurane (2% for induction during two or three minutes and 1-1.5% for maintenance during the MRI experiment) with an 100% oxygen line.\nPlace the animal in the center of the magnet with the help of a profile acquisition.\nAfter step 5.2.2, tune the RF coil to 300 MHz (7 T) resonance frequency and match the characteristic impedance of the coil to 50 Ohm for optimal signal reception.\n\t\tNOTE: Pay attention to the external wiring and connections going to the measurement system via the adaptor/splitter to each part of the transmitter coil individually (in our case it was a quadrature coil).\nAfter tuning and matching the coils, plug the coils into the scanner.",
    "For RF pulse calibration (shape and length) and center frequency adjustment perform both pulse calibration and center of frequency manually. Perform the 90° pulse calibration, coarse shimming (see below), center frequency and receiver gain adjustments manually.\nPerform exact position using a gradient echo (FLASH or GRE) localizer scan (3 plane scout acquisition: axial, coronal and sagittal, also called tripilot.\nPerform the magnet shimming to optimize the magnetic field homogeneity in the center of the magnet. Perform this step manually (see 5.2.3) using a one or single pulse FID sequence and adjust the first and second orders shims or any automatic shimming sequence included in the system\n\t\tNOTE: A well shimmed magnetic field is easily recognized and measured by the T2* (as bigger the better) or narrow FWHM of the spectra.\nMRI Data Acquisition of the Plaque5\nInject 100 µl (1 mg [Fe] ml-1) of neridronate nanoparticles intravenously into tail vein and acquire images 1 hr post injection. Load the parameters for MRI acquisition of atherosclerotic plaque looking at the abdominal aorta (renal bifurcation).\nPut multi-slice, 10 to 20 slices in interleave mode to minimize artifacts.\nAcquire high-resolution fast spin echo T1-weighted MRI in coronal or axial view with the following parameters: FOV 60 x 30 mm (coronal), 30 x 30 mm (axial), slice thickness 0.8 mm (with the small gradient coil configuration this can be reduced to 0.6 mm), 400 msec TR, 8 msec TE, 256 x 256 acquisition and reconstruction matrix data, 6 (large gradient) to 8 (small gradient) signal averages for 5-8 min average acquisition times.",
    "NOTE: TE is especially critical and the presence of blood signal and flow and chemical shift artifacts that can limit the applications. In these cases flow insensitive fast spin echo T2-IR can help to reduce artifacts and the acquisition of complementary data in the exact same location can help to characterize the plaque. Additionally, a presaturation pulse can be used to reduce the fat tissue surrounding the arterial wall for better delineation of the outer boundary of the wall and chemical shift artifact reduction.\nTransfer the images using a standard format such as Dicom and view in appropriate software (e.g. Osirix Imaging Software or AMIDE: Medical Imaging Data Examiner)5. Quantify the contrast effect manually delimiting the vessel area, wall thickness, lumen area and plaque burden5.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
