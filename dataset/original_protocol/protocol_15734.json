    "This study was conducted at the Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Centre, Shanghai University of Sport, and has been approved by the ethics committee of the Shanghai University of Sport (No. 102772020RT001). Before the test, the participants were given details about the experimental purpose and procedures; all participants signed the informed consent.\n1. Participant selection\nInclude participants who (1) are aged over 60 years old; (2) can maintain standing position alone; (3) can walk independently, without help from others, prosthesis, or mobility aids; (4) can display normal cognitive function and can understand the procedures and instructions of the test. Exclude participants who (1) were diagnosed with severe cardiopulmonary disease; (2) diagnosed with motor neuron disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; and (3) had a history of lower limb trauma in the past year were excluded.\n\tNOTE: To evaluate the function of the foot core system, 42 elderly participants and 42 young participants whose demographic data matched with the old group (control group) were recruited for this study. The sample size was calculated for t-test with setting of α = 0.05, power (1 − β) = 0.95, and effect size = 0.8. The result shows that 42 participants in each group should be included in this study.\n2. Active subsystem\nNOTE: The morphology and strength tests of intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles are used to evaluate the active subsystem.\nMuscle morphology\n\t\nTurn on the musculoskeletal ultrasound system, and then click on the Freeze button. Plug the probe connector into the connection port on the rear side of the host and lock the Probe Lock button. Click on the iStation button, and then click on New Patient. Input the ID, name, gender, and date of birth of each participant.",
    "NOTE: The probe cable should be arranged properly and placed in a location where it will not be easily trampled to ensure that the cable is not entangled with the other objects. Place the probe in a safe location to avoid collision and damage.\nAbductor hallucis (AbH): Apply the ultrasound coupling gel at the middle of the scanning line of tuberosity and navicular tuberosity. Place the probe at the medial calcaneal tuberosity toward the navicular tuberosity. Move the probe sightly to capture the thickest part of the AbH, and then click on the Save button to save the still image.\n\t\t\nThen, rotate the probe 90° to obtain the cross-sectional image of the AbH and save the image.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Maintain good contact between the probe and the skin without applying excessive pressure in muscle morphology measurements.\nFlexor digitorum brevis (FDB): Align the probe longitudinally on the line from the medial tubercle of the calcaneus to the third toe and scan the muscle to measure the thickness. Rotate the probe 90° to obtain the cross-sectional image.\nQuadratus plantae (QP): Align the probe longitudinally along the muscle fibers at the talocalcaneonavicular joint. Move the probe sightly to locate the thickest part of QP. Capture three images for thickness measurement. Rotate the probe 90° to obtain cross-sectional images.\n\t\tNOTE: QP lies deep in the FDB.\nFlexor hallucis brevis (FHB): Mark the first metatarsal, apply the ultrasound coupling gel, and then place the probe longitudinally along the shaft. Move the probe sightly to capture the thickest part of the FHB, and then rotate the probe 90° to obtain the cross-sectional image.",
    "Peroneus longus and brevis (PER): Instruct the participants to lie in the supine position. Mark the fibular head and the inferior border of the lateral malleolus, and mark 50% of the line connecting the two points. Apply the coupling gel and place the probe to capture the thickness. To obtain the cross-sectional image, rotate the probe 90° at the point where the thickness measurement was taken.\nTibialis anterior (TA): Apply the coupling gel in front of the calf over 20% of the distance between the fibular head and the inferior border of the lateral malleolus. Place the probe longitudinally along the TA to obtain a thickness measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the scanning range of the probe, the CSA of the TA cannot be captured completely.\nImage measurement: Look for the previously captured images on the right side of the screen. Use the trackball to move the cursor, select one image, and click on the Set button. Then, click on the Measure button. The measurement items appear on the left side of the screen.\n\t\t\nThickness: Use the trackball to move the cursor, select the distance measurement, and click on the Set button. Mark the two points of the thickest part of the muscle in the image (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Record the distance for the thickness.\nCross-sectional area (CSA): Use the trackball to move the cursor to trace the periphery of the muscle in the image. After tracing the cross-section of the entire muscle, click on the Set button (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Record the area for the CSA.\nMuscle strength\n\t\nInsert dynamometer Bluetooth stick into the USB interface of the computer. Open the dynamometer and FET Data Collection Software and click on the Start Gauge button to wait for automatic pairing.\nToe flexion strength test (FT1)",
    "Instruct the participant to sit in a chair with 90° flexion of the knee and ankle joint. Fix the dynamometer to the front side of the wooden frame. Connect the great toe to the dynamometer by carabiner (Figure 3B).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Adjust the appropriate bars to avoid pain during the test.\nInterchange the panels behind the foot to ensure that the heel to the head of the first metatarsal is supported while still allowing for unimpaired toe flexion. Adjust the carabiner so that the toe produces a steady baseline force, and then click on the Reset button to zero out the dynamometer.\nClick on the Start Gauge button in the software. Instruct the participant to remain stable until instructed to flex the big toe, pull as hard as possible for 3 s, and then relax the grip. Click on the Stop Gauge button, and save the data collected.\nToe flexion strength test (FT2-3 and FT2-5)\n\t\t\nUse the T-shaped metal bars to attach to the dynamometer. Instruct the participant to flex the 2nd-3rd toes or 2nd-5th toes. Perform a similar test procedure as the FT1 test (Figure 3C,D).\nDoming test\n\t\t\nPlace the dynamometer against the scaphoid tubercle. Instruct the participant to slide the forefoot toward the heel or raise the arch as much as possible without lifting or curling the toes, which would result in \"shortening\" of the foot and a raised medial longitudinal arch (Figure 3A).\nThen, ask the participant to do maximum voluntary contraction for 3 s. Perform data collection like previous toe flexion tests (steps 2.2.2 and 2.2.3).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Record three successful trials for the data process and provide sufficient rest time between trials to avoid fatigue.\nOpen the program software processing window and import the CSV files of the original strength data.",
    "Toe flexion force (FT1, FT2-3, FT2-5): Click on the Run button, select the Automatic Calculation option in the calculation list, and then click on the Calculation button. The software will actively calculate the peak strength of the toe grip (Figure 4).\nDoming force data: Import the original data into the software and click on the Run button. Select the Manual Calculation option in the calculation list. Then, drag the movable 0.5 s window manually, where the force curve is in the shape of a plateau, and the software will automatically calculate the average force in the window (Figure 5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63479/63479fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Representative ultrasound images of three intrinsic muscles.

    "Figure 4: Representative toe flexion strength plot. The peak force of toe flexion is calculated as the average value of six data points around the selected peak point. In the custom software, it is programmed that 10 points, including peak force remain relatively stable to avoid false peaks, which means that the remaining nine points do not exceed ±0.5 of the peak value.

Passive subsystem\nNOTE: The ND and foot posture index-6 (FPI-6) tests were applied to evaluate the foot structure (passive subsystem).\nNavicular drop (ND) test\n\t\nAssemble the height vernier caliper with the base, fixture block, and scribing claw. To specify the navicular tuberosity, extend the scribing claw through a stick. Place the height vernier caliper on the horizontal platform.\n\t\tNOTE: The ND test is performed on the same horizontal platform.\nInstruct the participants to sit on a height-adjustable chair and turn sideways to allow visualization of the medial longitudinal arch. Palpate the navicular tuberosity and mark its location. Instruct the participants to sit in a position where the knee, hip, and ankle joints make a 90° angle.\nPalpate the medial and lateral aspects of the participant's talus head. Supinate and pronate the subtalar joint until the medial and lateral sides of the talus are equally positioned.",
    "Align the head of the scribing claw with the marked navicular tuberosity. Read and record the height at this non-weight-bearing position (height 1).\nInstruct the participants to stand and keep the normal, bilateral, weight-bearing stance. Consistently, record the height (height 2).\nDefine the vertical movement of the navicular tuberosity (i.e., height 1-height 2) in the sagittal plane as ND.\n\t\tNOTE: In the process of the ND test, the participants must keep straight and look straight ahead.\nFoot posture index-6 (FPI-6)\n\t\nPerform the FPI-6 test on the horizontal platform as in the ND test (step 3.1.1).\nInstruct the participants to take several steps, marching on the spot, and then stand in their relaxed stance position with double limb support. Inform them to stand still for approximately 2 min during the assessment.\nPalpate the talar head and rate its position on the lateral and medial sides.\nPalpate the lateral malleolar and score the supra- and infra-lateral malleolar curvature.\nObserve the calcaneal frontal plane position and score the angle between the posterior aspect of the calcaneus and the long axis of the foot.\nPalate the talonavicular joint (TNJ) and score the bulge or concave in this area.\nPalate and observe the curve of the medial longitudinal arch and score its height and congruence.\nObserve the forefoot directly behind and in line with the long axis of the heel and score the relative position of the forefoot on the rearfoot (abduction/adduction).\n\t\t​NOTE: In this test, each item is scored as -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 (see Supplementary File 1).\n4. Neural subsystem\nNOTE: In the assessment of the neural subsystem, the plantar light touch threshold, and a two-point discriminator (TPD) were applied to evaluate the plantar sensitivity.\nPlantar light touch threshold",
    "Prepare Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) kit, consisting of 20 pieces. Each SWM kit has an index number ranging from 1.65 to 6.65 (1.65, 2.36, 2.44, 2.83, 3.22, 3.61, 3.84, 4.08, 4.17, 4.31, 4.56, 4.74, 4.93, 5.07, 5.18, 5.46, 5.88, 6.10, 6.45, and 6.65), which is related to a calibrated breaking force (i.e., index 1.65 is the equivalent of 0.008 g of force).\n\t\tNOTE: The higher the index value, the stiffer and harder it is to bend.\nMark the test regions in the plantar sole, including the first toe (T1), first metatarsal head (MT1), third metatarsal head (MT3), fifth metatarsal head (MT5), midfoot (M), and heel (H).\nApply 4.74 SWM to the participants' thenar eminences to feel the stimulus, which they will receive on the plantar sole in the formal test. Instruct participants to say \"yes\" and inform the examiner of the accurate site clearly and loudly every time the participants perceive the sensory stimulus of SWM at any tested sites.\n\t\tNOTE: Every marked region can be replaced by one specific number in the convenience of memory.\nPlace each participant in the prone position on a standard treatment table facing away from the examiner with the foot hanging on the edge of the table. Instruct them to close their eyes and wear headphones to avoid the assistance of vision and minimize distraction, respectively.\nApply SWM perpendicularly to the skin at the target region. Pressure is appropriate until the nylon SWM is bent to form a \"C\" shape. Then, hold it for 1 s before removal. 4.74 SWM is first applied over the marked region, and a 4-2-1 stepping algorithm is utilized to standardize the assessment21. Test six plantar regions at random.",
    "NOTE: Provide a few seconds for rest in the interval of trails in case of sensory disturbance between marked regions. The last detected SWM is regarded as the threshold for that site.\nTwo-point discriminator (TPD)\n\t\nPrepare the two-point discriminator device. The adjustable device has different distances, ranging from 1 mm to 15 mm.\n\t\tNOTE: One side of the dial ranges from 1 mm to 8 mm, and revolving the dial to the other side ranges from 9 mm to 15 mm.\nMark the six test regions in the plantar sole, which are the same as those in the case of the plantar light touch threshold test (step 4.1.2).\nTo make participants familiar with the testing process, apply the two-point discriminator in the participants' tip of the middle finger. Inform them to say \"one\" if they perceived one point or \"two\" if they perceived two points.\n\t\tNOTE: The test position is the same as that in the plantar light touch threshold test. The participants should keep their eyes closed.\nStart the test from the greatest distance (8 mm), and then decrease the width distance by 5 mm until the participants report one point. Move the device in 1 mm increments applying randomization of one or two points until the participants can consistently identify two points at a test width.\n\t\tNOTE: Three times of correctly identifying two-point touch out of five touches is defined as positive. The last two-point value is recorded as the TPD threshold value.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
