    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHeLa-CCL-2 and HeLa-MKLP1-GFP cell passaging and maintenance\nTiming: up to 7 days\nThis protocol is optimized for isolating large EVs or MBRs from cell culture medium. The cells should be in the active growth phase before plating into T175 flasks for medium collection and MBR isolation (steps 8–10 followed by either steps 11–13 or steps 14–16). HeLa-CCL-2 and HeLa-MKLP1-GFP cells are cultured similarly but may proliferate at differing rates.\nPassage the cells when they are approximately 70% confluent (3–4 × 106 cells).\nRemove medium, add 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, and incubate at 37°C for 5–10 min until cells detach.\nPipette the cells up and down to obtain a single-cell suspension.\nMix resuspended cells with an equal volume of DMEM/F12 medium.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant, and resuspend in DMEM/F12 medium.\nSplit cells 1:5 (6–8 x 105 cells) into a T75 flask in DMEM/F12 medium.\nNote: We suggest cells are split when they reach 60%–70% confluency to ensure they remain in the active growth phase with high levels of mitosis. Geneticin should be added to the MKLP1-GFP medium for one passage every few weeks to maintain selection. MKLP1-GFP HeLa cells have a geneticin resistant cassette linked to MKLP1-GFP. The addition of geneticin antibiotic will eliminate cells without the MKLP1-GFP gene and maintain a culture of MKLP1-GFP positive cells.\nHeLa-CCL-2 and HeLa-MKLP1-GFP cell culture on coverslips\nTiming: 1–3 days\nTo visualize cells and MBRs together, HeLa-CCL-2 and HeLa-MKLP1-GFP cells can be cultured on coverslips and characterized by immunofluorescence or an assay of choice. MKLP1-GFP cells should be in a non-selection medium (i.e., without geneticin).\nPlate cells on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips in a 12-well plate in 1 mL DMEM/F12 medium (3–4 x 104 cells per well).\nIncubate the cells until they reach 60%–70% confluency.",
    "Characterize the cells using immunofluorescence (steps 41–49) or an assay of choice.\nNote: We suggest cells are fixed when they reach a confluency of 60%–70% to ensure the cells remain in the active growth phase with high levels of mitosis, enabling the detection of MBRs.\nCollection of HeLa-CCL-2 and HeLa-MKLP1-GFP medium\nTiming: 3–6 days\nCells should be 60%–90% confluent before harvesting medium for MBR isolation. HeLa-CCL-2 and HeLa-MKLP1-GFP cells are cultured similarly but may proliferate at differing rates. MKLP1-GFP cells should be in a non-selection medium (i.e., without geneticin) for collection.\nPlate HeLa cells (6–8 × 105 cells per flask) in T175 flasks in 20 mL DMEM/F12 medium.\nOnce cells are approximately 75% confluent (6–8 × 106 cells), vigorously shake the flask from side to side 10 times to detach as many midbodies from the cells as possible.\nHarvest the medium into a 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the medium at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove dead cell debris.\nCarefully remove the supernatant (cleared conditioned medium) and transfer to a new 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: If the medium turns yellow, indicating a buildup of waste products from the cells, replace it with fresh medium and incubate for at least 24 h before harvesting. If cells are cultured in 150 mm dishes rather than T175 flasks (step 8), shaking the dish cannot be performed easily without medium loss. Therefore, vigorous pipetting of the medium over the surface of the dish multiple times should be performed to dislodge the MBRs.",
    "Critical: Cells should be cultured in T175 flasks for at least 2 days and no longer than 5 days before collecting medium. This ensures that the cells have had enough time to undergo at least 2 cycles of mitosis to produce MBRs, while also ensuring that the cells are not either overconfluent, which could introduce dead cell debris to the medium, or senescent and not proliferating, therefore producing no MBRs (see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nOption 1: Skop Lab 1.5% PEG6000\nTiming: 1 day\nCleared conditioned medium from step 10 can be used to isolate MBRs/large EVs with 1.5% PEG6000 which precipitates the MBRs/large EVs from the medium, allowing them to be centrifuged and concentrated in a smaller volume.\nTo the cleared conditioned medium from step 10 add 30% PEG6000 solution to yield a final PEG6000 concentration of 1.5% (v/v), and incubate for 12–18 h at 2–8°C.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the PEG/MBR.\nResuspend the PEG/MBR pellet in 1 mL sterile PBS.\nNote: There is a chance that small extracellular vesicles in cell culture medium from FBS might also precipitate, but the proposed isolation protocol uses very low concentrations of PEG6000. PEG6000 was tested on fresh medium containing FBS, no isolated EVs were observed.\nPause point: The PEG/MBR PBS solution can be used immediately for further analysis, stored at 4°C for up to 3 weeks or at −80°C for up to 2 months.\nOption 2: Skop Lab 30 nm gold nanoparticle\nTiming: 1 day\nCleared conditioned medium from step 10 can be used to isolate MBRs/large EVs using 30 nm gold nanoparticles which precipitates the MBRs/large EVs from the medium, allowing them to be centrifuged and concentrated in a smaller volume.",
    "To the cleared conditioned medium from step 10 add PEG5000 coated 30 nm gold particles solution to yield a final concentration of 0.02% (v/v), and incubate for 12–18 h at 2–8oC\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the gold/MBR.\nResuspend the gold/MBR pellet in 1 mL sterile PBS.\nNote: There is a chance that small extracellular vesicles in cell culture medium from FBS might also precipitate, but the proposed isolation protocol uses very low concentrations of gold nanoparticles to ensure that small exosomes and other impurities are not precipitated. When the gold nanoparticles were tested on fresh medium containing FBS, no isolated EVs were observed.\nPause point: The gold/MBR PBS solution from step 16 can be used immediately for further analysis, stored at 4°C for up to 3 weeks or at −80°C for up to 2 months.\nMBR fixation for transmission electron microscopic (TEM) imaging\nTiming: 2–3 days\nMBR size and structure can be studied using electron microscopy.\nCentrifuge the PEG/MBR PBS solution from step 13 or gold/MBR PBS solution from step 16 at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the MBRs.\nAll subsequent steps for TEM are performed on the PEG/MBR or gold/MBR pellet.\nIf the pellet can no longer be visualized, centrifuge at 1000 × g for 10 min.\nImmersion-fix the MBR pellet in immersion fix sodium phosphate solution for 2 h at 20–25°C.\nRinse the MBR pellet five times for 5 min in PB.\nPost-fix the MBR pellet in post fix sodium phosphate solution for 1 h at 20–25°C\nRinse five times for 5 min in PB.\nDehydrate the MBR pellet in a graded ethanol series (35%, 50%, 70%, 80% and 90%) diluted in dH2O for 5 min each at 20–25°C.",
    "Dehydrate the MBR pellet in 95% ethanol diluted in dH2O for 10 min at 20–25°C.\nDehydrate the MBR pellet in 100% ethanol twice for 10 min at 20–25°C.\nDehydrate the MBR pellet in dry acetone (AC) twice for 7 min at 20–25°C.\nIncubate the dehydrated MBR pellet with 10% EMbed 812 in AC for 60 min at 20–25°C.\nIncubate the dehydrated MBR pellet with 25% EMbed 812 in AC for 60 min at 20–25°C.\nIncubate the dehydrated MBR pellet with 50% EMbed 812 in AC for 12–18 h at 20–25°C.\nIncubate the dehydrated MBR pellet with 75% EMbed 812 in AC for 60 min at 20–25°C.\nIncubate the dehydrated MBR pellet with 100% EMbed 812 for 45 min at 60°C.\nIncubate the MBR pellet in fresh EMbed 812 for 48 h at 60°C for embedding and polymerization.\nSection the MBR pellet on an ultramicrotome into 100-nm sections.\nCollect the sections on 2 × 1 mm slot copper grids.\nPost-stain with 8% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol for 15 min at 60°C.\nPost-stain with Reynolds lead citrate for 10 min at 60°C.\nImage sections at 80 kV, 40,000× magnification with a transmission electron microscope.\nMBR attachment to poly-L-lysine coated coverslip\nTiming: 30 min\nMBRs from step 13 or 16 can be attached to poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips using the enhanced electrostatic interaction between the cell membrane and the poly-L-lysine for characterization by immunofluorescence or an assay of choice. Without the poly-L-lysine coating the MBRs do not attach well to glass and can be lost from the coverslip (see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nUsing forceps place one poly-L-lysine coated coverslip into each well of a 12-well plate.\nAdd 500–1000 μL of PEG/medium solution to each coverslip.\nCentrifuge the plate at 1000 × g for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge using a swinging bucket.",
    "Carefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the coverslip.\nNote: The coverslips can be used for analysis pre-fixation and immunofluorescent staining after fixation.\nCharacterizing MBRs: Immunofluorescent antibody staining\nTiming: ≤ 2 days\nMidbody remnants (MBRs) are released when a cell undergoes mitosis. MBRs or large extracellular vesicles (EV) can be distinguished from other EVs by the presence of MKLP1, a midbody marker protein (Patel et al., submitted). MBRs, either isolated or attached to cells, can be characterized by immunofluorescent staining. Here, the MBRs were stained for MKLP1,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] a widely used marker for midbodies, and CD9, a tetraspanin protein found on the surface of all classes of extracellular vesicles.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nFix the MBR coverslips from step 40 or cell and MBR coverslips from step 7 with PHEM-PFA for 15 min at 20–25oC.\nWash the fixed coverslips three times for 5 min with PBS.\nBlock the coverslips with PHEM blocking buffer for 45–60 min at 37°C or 2 h at 20–25°C.\nIncubate coverslips with primary antibody (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) diluted in PHEM blocking buffer for 12–18 h at 4°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2972_7.csv\nWash coverslips three times for 5 min with PBS-T.\nIncubate the coverslips with secondary antibody (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) diluted in PHEM blocking buffer for 30 min at 37°C, 1 h at 20–25°C, or 12–18 h at 4°C.\nIf required, fluorophore-conjugated antibodies can be added along with the secondary antibodies.\nWash the coverslips four times for 5 min with PBS-T.\nMount the coverslips onto slides with a drop of Fluoro-Gel mounting medium for the isolated MBRs or Vectashield mounting medium for cells with MBRs.\nImage the MBRs with a 20× objective, or higher, as required.\nNote: We used a Nikon Structured illuminated microscope (N-SIM) with 100× objective and an Echo Revolve microscope with a 20× objective to obtain images of MBRs.\nCharacterizing MBRs: Immunofluorescent imaging",
    "Timing: ≤ 2 days\nMBRs obtained from step 13 or 16 from HeLa-MKLP1-GFP cells can be directly characterized by immunofluorescence imaging because the MBRs are GFP-positive.\nFix the MBR-containing coverslips with PHEM-PFA for 15 min at 20–25°C.\nWash the fixed coverslips three times for 5 min with PBS.\nMount the coverslips onto slides with a drop of Fluoro-Gel mounting medium.\nImage the MBRs with a 20× objective, or higher, as required.\nNote: If required, the MKLP1-GFP MBRs can also be stained with CD9, following steps 44–47. If there are a large number of small vesicles that are CD9 positive (exosome marker) and MKLP1- GFP negative please refer to problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]. We used a Nikon Structured illuminated microscope (N-SIM) with a 100× objective and an Echo Revolve microscope with a 20× objective to obtain images of MBRs. Please refer to problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] if there are low numbers of MKLP1 positive vesicles visible."
