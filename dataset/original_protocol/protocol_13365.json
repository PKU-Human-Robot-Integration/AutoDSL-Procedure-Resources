    "All animal-related experiments were conducted with approval from the Experiment Ethics Committee of the Chongqing Institute of TCM (laboratory animal ethics review certificate number: ZJS2022-03).\n1. Determination of the bioactive components\nNOTE: The species used in this research was Epimedium sagittatum, and the samples were collected in Fengdu County, Chongqing. The sample was identified as a dry above-ground part of E. sagittatum (Sieb. et Zucc.) Maxim. by researchers of The Institute of Biological Medicine, Chongqing Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\nPrepare the control product solution by accurately weighing the appropriate amount of each reference substance, namely, icariin, epimedin A (EA), epimedin B (EB), epimedin C (EC), and baohuoside I (BI), using an electronic analytical balance, and dissolve in methanol. Using these, prepare a mixed reference stock solution containing 381.61 µg/mL icariin, 124.14 µg/mL EA, 110.24 µg/mL EB, 1091.75 µg/mL EC, and 184.98 µg/mL BI.\nPrepare the test product solution by crushing EF through a No. 3 sieve. Place approximately 0.2 g (using an electronic analytical balance) of crushed EF into a stoppered Erlenmeyer flask, add 20 mL of dilute ethanol, and then ultrasonicate at 400 W power and 50 kHz frequency for 1 h. Shake well, and pass through a 0.22 µm membrane filter to obtain the test solution.",
    "Perform the chromatography as follows. Use high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a C18 column with dimensions of 4.6 mm x 250 mm and an inner diameter of 5 µm. Use acetonitrile as mobile phase A and ultrapure water as mobile phase B. Use the following gradient elution parameters: 0-30 min, 24% A to 26% A; 30-31 min, 26% A to 45% A; 31-45 min, 45% A to 47% A. Use a detection wavelength of 220 nm (for the detector used, see Table of Materials). Keep the column temperature at 30 °C and the current velocity at 1.0 mL/min, and use a sample size of 10 µL.\nTo investigate the linear relationship, use the mixed reference solution as in step 1.1 diluted 2 times, 4 times, 8 times, 16 times, and 32 times, for icariin, EA, EB, EC, and BI, respectively. Use acetonitrile as mobile phase A and ultrapure water as mobile phase B.\nUse the following gradient elution parameters: 0-30 min, 24% A to 26% A; 30-31 min, 26% A to 45% A; 31-45 min, 45% A to 47% A. Use a detection wavelength of 220 nm (for the detector used, see Table of Materials). Keep the column temperature at 30 °C and the current velocity at 1.0 mL/min and use a sample size of 10 µL. Finally, record the peak areas. Plot the linear regression with the reference concentration (x-axis, µg/mL) as the abscissa and the peak area (y-axis) as the ordinate using professional software (see Table of Materials).",
    "Perform the precision test by measuring the mixed control solution six consecutive times by HPLC using the chromatographic conditions shown in step 1.3. Record the detection time and peak areas of each chemical composition, and calculate the relative standard deviations (RSD) of the peak areas to assess the precision (reproducibility) using the formula below:\n\tRSD% = standard deviation (SD)/arithmetic mean of calculated results (X) x 100 %\nTo perform the reproducibility test, accurately weigh the EF powder, and prepare six parts of the test product solution in parallel according to the method in step 1.2. Subject the prepared solutions to HPLC under the chromatographic conditions presented in step 1.3. Record the retention times and peak areas of each chemical composition and calculate the amounts of each compound from a standard curve (peak areas versus concentrations). Calculate the RSD% as above.\nTo perform the stability test, store the test solutions at room temperature, and measure their contents by the HPLC method described in step 1.3 at 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h after preparation to assess the stability. Record the retention times and peak areas of each chemical composition and calculate the RSD% of the peak areas as above.\nTo perform the sample recovery test, weigh 0.2 g of EF powder into a stoppered Erlenmeyer flask for six replicates. Add an appropriate amount of the reference solution (the amount of reference substance added to the sample is equivalent to 100% of the known content of the sample) and prepare the test solution according to the method presented in step 1.2.\nInject the samples into the chromatograph and analyze according to the chromatographic conditions in step 1.3. Record the peak areas, and calculate the average recovery and RSD% values as below:",
    "Spiked sample recovery rate = (spiked sample content − sample content)/sample amount x 100%\n2. Optimization of the EF mutton-oil processing technology using the Box-Behnken design-response surface methodology\nSelect the key parameters in EF processing, such as the amount of mutton oil (A; 15%-35%), the mutton oil temperature (B; 50-120 °C), and the frying temperature (C; 80-300 °C), as influential factors. Use the comprehensive scores of icariin, EA, EB, EC, and BI content as the evaluation indexes. The percentage of mutton oil here is the mass percentage.\nUse the response surface analysis software (see Table of Materials) to design the Box-Behnken response surface experiments, explore the quadratic response surface, and construct a second-order polynomial model. Select the new Box-Behnken Design, and set the Numeric Factors option to 3; set factors A, B, and C. Click on Continue. Set the Responses option to 1 (which was the comprehensive score). Click on Continue to complete the design. A total of 17 experiments were planned (see Table 1).\n\tNOTE: For the independent and dependent variables, along with their low, middle, and high levels, see Table 2.\nProcess the EF according to the specific parameters in Table 1; for example, for order number 1, weigh refined mutton oil as 15% v/v, and then heat to 50 °C to melt it. Add the crude EF to the melted mutton, stir-fry over a gentle fire (190 °C) until it is evenly shiny, and then remove and cool. Performed 17 experimental operations. A total of 17 groups of EF-processed products were obtained in this work.\n\tNOTE: Mutton oil is solid at room temperature (25 °C) and melts into liquid when heated. Mutton oil in a liquid state can be used as the excipient.",
    "Prepare the test solutions of the processed products according to the method described in step 1.2. Then, analyze them using HPLC according to the chromatographic conditions described in step 1.3. Record the retention times and peak areas of each chemical composition, and calculate the contents of the icariin, EA, EB, EC, and BI in each test solution against an external standard curve. Use the comprehensive score calculation formula below to calculate the comprehensive scores of the 17 experimental groups:\n\tComprehensive score = Z/Zmax × 0.5 + BI/BImax × 0.5\n\twhere Z is the sum of the icariin, EA, EB, and EC contents; Zmax is the maximum value of the sum of the icariin, EA, EB, and EC contents in the 17 experimental groups; BI is the BI content; and BImax is the maximum value of the BI content in the 17 experimental groups.\nImport the comprehensive scoring results for the 17 groups of experiments into the data analysis software (see Table of Materials) to analyze the experimental data. Under the evaluation items, select the quadratic process order option and polynomial model type option.\n3. Testing the effect of processing on zebrafish embryonic development\nSample preparation\n\t\nCrush the crude and processed EF through a No. 3 sieve (see Table of Materials). To 100 g of each EF sample, add 1,000 mL of ultrapure water. Soak the EF for 0.5 h, boil the water twice for 30 min each, and then filter with filter paper.\nCombine the filtrates and concentrate the sample by heating. Add ultrapure water to a final volume of 100 mL to obtain the processed EF (PEF, 1 g/mL) and the crude EF (CEF,1 g/mL) stock solutions. Measure the amount of raw drug in each stock solution.",
    "Place aliquots of 1 mL, 1.5 mL, 2.5 mL, 5 mL, and 7.5 mL stock solutions in 10 mL volumetric flasks, and then add ultrapure water to volume to prepare the test solutions with concentrations of 100 mg/mL, 150 mg/mL, 200 mg/mL, 250 mg/mL, 500 mg/mL, and 750 mg/mL for the zebrafish embryotoxicity study.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentrations of the test solutions were prepared by referring to the relevant literature20,21 and by performing preliminary experiments to give the 10-fold concentration gradient used in normal toxicology. CEF was an unprocessed sample, and PEF was a sample prepared with the best processing technology described in section 2.\nZebrafish husbandry and embryo treatment21\nAdapt wild-type zebrafish (see Table of Materials) at a controlled temperature for 2 days, keep them in a flow-through aquarium at pH 7.0-7.4 and feed them twice daily.\n\t\tNOTE: The inhibition of melanin formation in zebrafish was achieved by adding 1-phenyl-2-thiourea in a concentration of 0.003% (mass/volume) to the culture medium, which kept their bodies transparent for morphological observation.\nSelect adult fertile wild-type zebrafish in the evening and separate them by using baffles in mating boxes. Remove the baffles the following morning, and allow the fish to spawn for 30 min. Collected the fertilized eggs with a dropper every 15 min. In total, 520 healthy wild-type embryos were collected. Keep the zebrafish embryos in an incubator at 28.5 °C for 24 h.",
    "Randomly assign the healthy embryos at 24 h post fertilization (hpf) to 13 groups, and along with one control group, separately soak in 10 mL of each of the following solutions in a culture dish: PEF: 100 µg/mL, 150 µg/mL, 200 µg/mL, 250 µg/mL, 500 µg/mL, 750 µg/mL; CEF: 100 µg/mL, 150 µg/mL, 200 µg/mL, 250 µg/mL, 500 µg/mL, 750 µg/mL . Treat the blank control group with the medium as a solution. Each group contained 40 embryos in this study.\n\t\tNOTE: The medium composition is 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.25 mM Na2HPO4, 0.45 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgSO4, and 4 mM NaHCO3.\nCulture the zebrafish in a constant temperature incubator for up to 120 hpf. Count the number of dead larvae every day, observe the main organ morphology of the larvae in each experimental group under a stereomicroscope (scale bar = 500 µm, see Table of Materials), and calculate the half-death concentration (LC50) of zebrafish at 72 hpf by using data analysis software (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
