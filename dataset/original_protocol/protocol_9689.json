    "1. Optical setup\nDirect a 532 nm laser beam (Raman excitation source) into the flex port of the optical tweezer microscope (see Table of Materials).\nAlign the 532 nm laser beam into the stereo double-layer pathways of the optical tweezer microscope with a 750 nm long-pass dichroic mirror to combine with the original trapping laser beams to focus on the sample chamber.\nCollect the backscattered light from the sample chamber using a 750 nm long-pass dichroic mirror and redirect it into a spectrometer containing a liquid-nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (see Table of Materials). Place a 532 nm notch filter in front of the entrance slit of the spectrometer before spectral acquisition.\n\t​NOTE: Eye protection must be used when the laser is turned on, and the laser beam must be contained within a safe area.\n2. Fabrication of AgNPs\nHeat 50 mL of 1 mM AgNO3 aqueous solution in a round-bottomed flask while boiling.\nAdd 1.0 mL of 0.1 M trisodium citrate solution dropwise into the boiled AgNO3 aqueous solution.\nKeep the mixture boiling for 16 min under constant stirring.\nCool the mixture to room temperature. Yellowish color is observed.\nCentrifuge the AgNP colloids at 2000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and then remove the supernatant using a pipette.\nResuspend the AgNP colloids with 1 mL of de-ionized water (resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm).\nRepeat steps 2.5 and 2.6 thrice to remove the residual reducing agent.\nCharacterize the size distribution of the AgNPs using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)33 to confirm the uniformity of the AgNPs (Figure 2). The AgNP concentration was estimated as 0.1 nM by UV absorbance34.",
    "NOTES: Due to the low concentration, the AgNP stock solution can be maintained without clustering for 2-3 weeks. No stabilizing agents are required. If a precipitate was observed in the AgNP stock solution, a new AgNP solution was prepared following the above protocol.\n3. Interaction of the DSNB analyte molecule and AgNP\nAdd 200 µL of 2 mM DSNB (see Table of Materials) to 1 mL of AgNP colloid and incubate at room temperature for 3 h to coat a layer of DSNB on the surface of AgNP by the formation of the Ag-S bond between AgNP and DSNB35. A schematic representation of this interaction is shown in Figure 3.\nCentrifuge the AgNP at 2,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the AgNP-DSNB with 1 mL of de-ionized water.\nRepeat steps 3.2 and 3.3 thrice to remove excess DSNB.\nRecord the UV-visible spectra of the AgNP colloid and AgNP-DSNB solution.\n\t​NOTE: This spectra show an absorption peak shift from approximately 420 nm to 450 nm, indicating the successful coating of DSNB on the surface of AgNP (Figure 3).\n4. Preparation of sample chamber and generation of AgNP assembly for SERS measurement\nClean the glass slide and coverslip with water and ethanol.\nAttach the frame tape (0.25 mm thickness, see Table of Materials) to the glass slide to create a chamber (1.0 cm length × 1.0 cm width × 0.25 mm height).\nAdd a few drops of the AgNP-DSNB solution (around 25 µL) into the frame.\nPut the coverslip on the frame tape and seal it (Figure 4).\nAdd liquid nitrogen to the container of the liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD camera until the temperature reaches -120 °C.",
    "Block the Raman probe beam path using a magnetic laser safety screen (see Table of Materials), then turn on the 532 nm Raman excitation source laser.\nFix the sample chamber with the AgNP-DSNB solution on the chamber holder. Add water to the water-immersed objective (60x magnification with a 1.2 numerical aperture A of 1.2) as shown in Figure 1. Then place the chamber holder immediately onto the microstage above the objective.\nDrop immersion oil on top of the coverslip and position the oil-immersed condenser to visualize particles on the microscope camera.\nAdjust the Z position of the objective by turning the knob of the microscope until the 532 nm Raman probe beam is focused on the bottom glass surface of the chamber, showing a white spot on the microscope camera (Figure 5).\n\t\nAdjust the X- and Y-positions of the microstage to move the chamber to place the central region of the chamber at the white spot. Open the optical tweezer control software (see Table of Materials) and use the equipped joystick control to move the 1064 nm trapping laser (indicated by a red circle in the optical tweezer system) to overlap with the white spot (Figure 5).\nNext, tune the knob of the microscope to move the Z position of the objective up.\n\t\tNOTE: The disappearance of the white spot in the microscope camera image indicates that the 532 nm Raman probe beam is focused inside the chamber.\nTurn on the 1064 nm trapping laser to attract AgNPs in the sample chamber and create a plasmonic AgNP assembly.\n\tNOTE: The gathering of AgNPs results in a dark spot in the sample chamber (Figure 6B).\n\t\nTurn down the trapping laser beam to avoid overheating or bubble formation when required.",
    "NOTE: Increase the trapping laser power and irradiation time if there is no apparent formation of the AgNP assembly.\nAdjust the position of the sample microstage to place the dark spot of the plasmonic AgNP assembly under the focus of the 532 nm Raman probe beam for spectroscopic measurements.\nPlace the neutral-density (ND) filters in front of the 532 nm Raman laser outlet to adjust the power to 10 mW. Input the acquisition time (10 s for the present study, Figure 6) in the setting panel in the spectrum software (see Table of Materials) and click on the Acquire button to start the spectral acquisition.\n\tNOTE: This generates the SERS spectrum of the analyte molecules (DSNB in the representative result and Figure 6)."
