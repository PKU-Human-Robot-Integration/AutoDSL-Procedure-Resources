Microfabrication of Surface Electrodes\nNote: Figure 2b shows the fabrication process of surface electrodes.\nClean a 4-inch borosilicate glass wafer in a piranha solution (98% sulfuric acid : 30% hydrogen peroxide = 5 : 1) at 120 °C for 20 min to remove all the organic contaminants. Then place the wafer on a 200 °C hot plate for 20 min to remove residual water.\nTransfer the wafer to a spinner. Dispense 2 mL negative photoresist onto the wafer and spin the wafer at a speed of 3,000 rpm for 40 s to uniformly coat the wafer with a 1.5-µm photoresist layer.\nPlace the wafer on a 150 °C hot plate and bake the spun photoresist for 1 min.\nExpose the photoresist to 365-nm UV light (225 mJ/cm2) through a chrome mask using a mask aligner.",
    "Place the wafer on a 100 °C hot plate and bake the exposed photoresist for 1 min.\nDevelop the photoresist by immersing the wafer in a photoresist developer (RD6) for 15 s. Gently spray deionized (DI) water and wash the wafer. Dry by blowing compressed nitrogen.\nPlace the wafer with patterned photoresist into an e-beam metal evaporator, and deposit a 20-nm-thick chrome film, followed by an 80-nm-thick gold film onto the wafer at a base pressure of 3×10-6 Torr with a deposition rate of 1 Å/s.\nImmerse the metal-coated wafer into acetone in an ultrasonic bath set at a frequency of 40 kHz with 100% amplitude for 30 min at room temperature to etch the underlying photoresist and complete the lift-off process.\nDice the wafer into smaller pieces using a conventional dicing saw.\n3.

Coat the wafer with photoresist.\n\t\nSpin the wafer at 500 rpm for 15 s.\nSpin the wafer at 1,000 rpm for 15 s.\nSpin the wafer at 3,000 rpm for 60 s to obtain a uniformly coated 15-µm thick photoresist layer.\nPlace the wafer face up on a cleanroom wipe soaked in acetone and remove the residual photoresist from the backside and edges of the wafer.\nTransfer the wafer onto a hot plate for soft baking. First, bake the wafer at 65 °C for 1 min. Then quickly move the wafer to a 95 °C hot plate and bake for 2 min.",
    "Expose the photoresist to 365-nm UV light (180 mJ/cm2) through a chrome mask by using a mask aligner.\nBake the wafer following exposure at 65 °C for 1 min and then at 95 °C for 2 min.\nImmerse the wafer in developer and gently shake the container for 3 min. Then, rinse the wafer with isopropanol alcohol (IPA) and dry it by blowing compressed nitrogen. If a white-colored residue appears on the wafer, immerse it into the developer again and develop for longer time and dry.\nBake the wafer on a 200 °C hot plate for 30 min to dry it completely.\nMeasure the thickness of the patterned photoresist using a profilometer at different locations across the wafer to ensure uniformity.\nSilanize the mold wafer by utilizing the technique of vapor deposition. Add 200 µL of trichlorosilane in a Petri dish and place in a vacuum desiccator along with the SU-8 mold wafer for 8 h.\n4. Assembly of the Microfluidic CODES Device\nPlace the 4-inch silicon wafer with the mold in a 150-mm diameter Petri dish, and fix it by taping from its edges.\nMix the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pre-polymer and cross-linker at a ratio of 10:1, and pour 50 g of the mixture into the Petri dish. Place the Petri dish in a vacuum desiccator to degas the mixture for 1 h, and then cure it in an oven at 65 °C for at least 4 h (Figure 2a).\nCut out the cured PDMS layer using a scalpel and peel it off the mold wafer using a tweezer. The size of the proof-of-principle device is approximately 20 mm × 7 mm. Then punch holes with a diameter of 1.5 mm through the PDMS for the inlet and outlet of the microfluidic channel using a biopsy puncher.",
    "Clean the patterned side of the PDMS part by placing it on a clean-room adhesive tape.\nClean the glass substrate with surface electrodes by rinsing it with acetone, IPA, DI water and dry using compressed nitrogen.\nActivate the surfaces of PDMS and glass substrate in oxygen plasma for 30 s with the micromachined side of each part facing up in an RF plasma generator set at 100 mW.\nAlign the PDMS microfluidic channel with surface electrodes on the glass substrate using an optical microscope and then bring the two plasma-activated surfaces in physical contact.\nBake the device on a 70 °C hot plate for 5 min, with the glass side facing the hot plate.\nConnect the contact pads of the electrodes with wires by soldering.\n5. Preparation of the Simulated Biological Sample\nCulture the HeyA8 human ovarian cancer cells in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C until they reach 80% confluence.\nAspirate the media from the culture flask using a glass pipette. Dispense and then aspirate 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to wash the cells.\nIncubate cells in 2 mL 0.05% (w/v) trypsin solution for 2 min at 37 °C to suspend adherent cells. Then, add 4 mL of the culture media to neutralize the trypsin.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 100 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells in a test tube. Then, aspirate supernatant completely.\nRe-suspend the cells in 1-2 mL 1x PBS by gently pipetting up and down to mechanically dissociate cell clumps.\nDraw a small amount of cell suspension into a pipette and count the number of cells using hemocytometer.\nDilute the cell suspension with PBS to prepare a sample with final cell concentration of 105-106 cells/mL.",

    "Use MATLAB function (resample) to expand the template library by digitally creating versions of normalized code signals with varying durations to accommodate variations in the cell flow speed over the electrodes.\nIdentify the signal blocks that correspond to sensor activity (threshold: SNR > 12 dB) in the filtered waveform. Waveform with SNR under the threshold would be treated as noise.\nDecode individual blocks of sensor activity in the recorded signal by using an iterative algorithm based on the successive interference cancellation, a technique commonly employed in multi-user CDMA communication networks24,25.\n\t\nCalculate cross-correlation of each signal block with all of the templates in the library using sliding dot product.\nIdentify the template that produces the largest auto-correlation peak to determine the dominant individual sensor code signal. Record the both time and amplitude of the autocorrelation peak.\nConstruct an estimate sensor code signal by scaling the identified code template based on the measured autocorrelation peak amplitude and timing information (determined in step 7.5.2).\nSubtract the estimated sensor code signal from the original data.\nIterate the process from 7.5.1, until the residual signal does not resemble any signal in the template library, mathematically defined as the correlation coefficient being less than 0.5.\nRefine initial sensor signal estimations from step 7.5 using an optimization process.\n\t\nReconstruct the signal by adding estimated individual sensor signals from each iteration.\nSweep the amplitude, duration and timing of individual sensor signals around the original estimates to produce the best fit with the recorded electrical signal based on least-squares approximation26.\nConvert amplitudes of estimated sensor signals into cell size by calibrating electrical signals against optical images.\nSubscription Required.
