    "NOTE: Figure 1 shows the five steps for the array CGH protocol. They are: 1) Preparation of plant materials; 2) Isolation of high quality DNA samples; 3) Labeling and purification of DNA samples; 4) Hybridization, washing, and scanning of whole genome arrays; and 5) CGH data analysis. M. truncatula whole genome tiling arrays contain a total of 971,041 unique oligo probes targeting more than 50,000 genes or gene models in the genome (See Table of Materials). The unique probes are spaced approximately every 150 base pairs (bp) in exonic regions and 261 bp in intronic regions of the M. truncatula genome.\n1. Preparation of Plant Materials\nScarify wild type (WT; M. truncatula cv Jemalong A17) and FN6191 mutant seeds with concentrated sulfuric acid for 8 min (see Table of Materials). Remove and discard sulfuric acid to a liquid waste container.\nRinse seeds with autoclaved deionized water three times.\nSurface sterilize seeds with 20% bleach solution for 10 min.\nRinse seeds with autoclaved deionized water three times.\nStore seeds at 4 °C for 3 days. After vernalization, transfer and germinate seeds in soil for one week in a growth chamber with 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle and 150 µE/m2/s light intensity.\nTransplant seedlings to 1 gallon pots and grow them in a greenhouse with 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle, 150 µE/m2/s light intensity for three to four weeks. Collect young leaf samples from the plants for DNA isolation.\n2. Isolation of High Quality DNA Samples\nTake 1 g of young leaf tissue from a single plant and freeze it in liquid nitrogen immediately.\nGrind frozen leaf tissue in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle to fine powder.\nIsolate genomic DNA with a DNA isolation kit (see Table of Materials).",
    "Resuspend purified DNA samples in 50 µL of autoclaved double deionized H2O (ddH2O) or 1x TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0).\nMeasure DNA concentrations with a spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials).\nEvaluate 260 nm/280 nm and 260 nm/230 nm ratios of DNA samples.\n\tNOTE: High quality DNA samples should have a 260 nm/280 nm ratio ≥1.8 and a 260 nm/230 nm ratio ≥2.0.\nFurther evaluate DNA samples by running them in 1% agarose gels.\n\tNOTE: High quality DNA samples should have high molecular weight and should not be contaminated by RNA. Ideally, the final concentration of DNA samples should be ~150 ng/µL.\n3. DNA Labeling and Purification\nDilute 1 µg of genomic DNA samples with ddH2O to a final volume of 20 µL in a 500 µL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 5 µL of a random primer (see Table of Materials) to the tube.\nVortex the tube briefly and put it into a thermocycler to incubate and denature DNA at 98 °C for 10 min.\nTake the tube out of the thermocycler and put it immediately on ice water to chill for 5 min.\nPrepare two labeling mixes as shown in Table 1.\nAdd 25 µL of labeling mixes 1 and 2 to reference DNA and sample DNA tubes, respectively.\nMix the labeling mix and DNA by pipetting three times and spin the tubes briefly.\nPut the tubes into a thermocycler to incubate at 37 °C for 2 h and then at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate the exo-Klenow enzyme (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 430 µL of 1x TE buffer to each tube.\nMix the contents and spin the tubes briefly.\nTransfer the solution in the tube into a purification column with a 2 mL collection tube (see Table of Materials).",
    "Centrifuge the purification column at 14,000 x g for 10 min.\nDiscard the pass through solution.\nAdd 480 µL 1x TE buffer to each column.\nCentrifuge the column again at 14,000 x g for 10 min.\nDiscard the pass-through solution.\nTransfer the labeled DNA sample that remains at the bottom portion of the column to a new centrifuge tube.\nMeasure the volume of the labeled DNA sample using a pipette and bring the final volume to 80 µL with 1x TE buffer.\nMeasure the concentration of the labeled DNA sample using a spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials).\nMix an equal amount of labeled sample DNA and reference DNA and bring the final volume to 160 µL with 1x TE buffer.\nAdd 256 µL of 2x hybridization buffer, 50 µL of human Cot-1 DNA and 50 µL of 10× aCGH blocking agent (see Table of Materials) and mix them well by pipetting for three times.\nSpin the tubes briefly and put them into a thermocycler to incubate at 98 °C for 10 min.\nIncubate the tubes at 37 °C for 20 min.\n4. Hybridization, Washing, and Scanning of the Genome Arrays\nPre-warm the hybridization oven to 67 °C at least 4 h before hybridization starts.\nPlace a gasket slide onto the base of a hybridization chamber.\nLoad 490 µL of hybridization solution from Step 3.23 onto the gasket slide.\nCover the gasket slide with a Medicago truncatula genome microarray chip to form a hybridization chamber.\nPut on the hybridization chamber covers and tighten the chamber firmly with clamps.\nPut the assembled hybridization chamber into the hybridization oven and incubate at 67 °C for 40 - 48 h.",
    "Prepare three slide washing dishes: two with 250 mL washing buffer I kept at room temperature, and one with washing buffer II kept at 37 °C.\nPrepare two slide washing jars: one with 70 mL acetonitrile and one with 70 mL stabilization and drying solution; keep both in a fume hood at room temperature (see Table of Materials).\nRemove the hybridization chamber from the oven and remove the chamber clamps and cover.\nMove the microarray chip and gasket slide to a slide washing dish with wash buffer I and separate the chip from the cover slide.\nMove the microarray chip to the second slide washing dish with wash buffer I and gently circulate the solution with a stir bar on a magnetic stir plate at room temperature for 5 min.\nTransfer the microarray chip to the third slide washing dish with pre-warmed washing buffer II and wash it gently with a stir bar on a magnetic stir plate at 37 °C for 1 min.\nTransfer the microarray chip to a slide washing jar with acetonitrile in a fume hood and wash it for 30 s.\nTransfer the microarray chip to a slide washing jar with stabilization and drying solution and wash it for 30 s.\nTake out the chip slowly and dry it for 1 min.\nScan the microarray chip using a scanner (see Table of Materials) under 2 µm resolution. Set parameters to save multiple images and whole slide scans. Set channels 1 and 2 gains to 100% and cancel the auto gain.\n5. CGH Data Analysis\nExtract the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence intensities for each probe on the array using scanning software (see Table of Materials).",
    "Use segmentation analysis of the software to detect copy number variations (CNVs) between the sample DNA and reference DNA. Use a threshold of the segment mean log2 sample/reference ratio ± 2.5 standard deviations for determining CNVs.\nInspect the distribution of log2 sample/reference ratios across the whole genome using a signal mapping software (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
