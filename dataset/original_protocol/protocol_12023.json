    "1. Flower and Silique Fixation\nHarvest flowers and siliques from plants synchronized at the opening of the first flower.\n\tNOTE: Under the experimental conditions used here, plants start flowering approximately 21 days after transplantation from Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates to soil. Seeds are stratified for 3–4 days at 4 °C and germinated/grown on MS plates at 22 °C/16 h light and 18 °C/8 h dark for 8 to 10 days, before transplanting the seedlings on nutrient-rich soil in pots kept under the same conditions (Figure 1). The number of replicates depends on the specific research objective, but a minimum of 5 inflorescences (from 5 individual plants) for each treatment is recommended. If flowers are the experimental unit, a minimum of 10 flowers per replicate is recommended.\nCut inflorescences or flowers (Figure 1E-H) using small scissors (e.g., nail scissors) and place them immediately in a microcentrifuge tube (for single inflorescence/flower fixation) or a conical tube (for collective fixations) containing freshly made Carnoy's, methanol/acetic acid, or FPA50 fixatives (depending on the application, see below) on ice.\n\tNOTE: Samples should be completely submerged in the fixative.\nLeave the tissue within the fixative for 4 h to overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Vacuum infiltration can be used for speeding up the penetration of the fixative into the tissue, but this may be detrimental to preserving the structure of the tissue. The authors do not implement vacuum infiltration.\nRemove the fixative, add enough 70% ethanol to cover the samples, and return them to 4 °C for at least 24 h; samples can stay indefinitely in this solution. After removing ethanol, proceed immediately to the next step; either dissection, or SDS clearing.\n2. Dissection under the Stereomicroscope\nPut freshly made 70% ethanol in a watch maker's glass placed on a small Petri dish for support.",
    "Place the inflorescence/flower/silique on this freshly made fixative and dissect under the stereomicroscope using forceps and a syringe with a needle.\nUse a watch maker's glass or similar device that allows the samples to be totally covered with ethanol (recommended) for the dissection of inflorescences, and for tearing apart floral organs of mature flowers (sepals, petals, and stamen can be dissected at this stage) to avoid the risk of samples drying out.\nDissect siliques and small flower buds on a slide as described below.\nPut the watch maker's glass with pre-processed samples aside, and use a normal slide for the final dissection.\nMove the sample of interest to the slide and add 10 µL of fresh 70% ethanol. Work swiftly on the final dissection and add 10 µL of ethanol, if necessary, to keep the sample moist without excessive liquid.\nFor releasing pollen grains from stamens, see step 5.1. For dissecting carpels and ovules, follow the procedure described in Figure 2. This procedure applies to all stages of development of the carpel, including the stage of development of green siliques.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not add ethanol if there is sufficient ethanol carry-over from moving the samples; dissecting very small samples is much easier in a minimal amount of liquid. Always keep only the organs of interest (sepals, petals, stamens, carpels, ovules, seeds, or pollen grains) on the slide. This procedure will ensure a uniform thickness between the slide and coverslip, corresponding to the thickness of the organ under examination, resulting in a higher homogeneity, and thus efficiency for microscopic examinations (higher number of target specimens in the same focal plane).",
    "Use a small piece of blotting paper to absorb and remove as much ethanol as possible. Quickly proceed to the next step (section 3, 4, or 6) before the sample dries out.\n3. Chloral Hydrate-Based Clearing and Combined Clearing-staining\nNOTE: Best results for chloral hydrate-based clearing are obtained with FPA50 fixed material.\nPlace 20 µL of clearing solution (chloral hydrate/glycerol, modified Hoyer's medium, Herr's 4½, or Herr's IKI-4½ solutions) on the specimen-bearing slide. Using a pair of syringes with hypodermal needles, position the specimens as needed by reducing the space between them, and flipping those where the organ of interest faces downward. Remove any remaining air bubble using the needle.\nLower a coverslip sideways and gently place it, pressing very gently, and wait until the clearing solution fills the space in between. Add minimal clearing solution, if needed, to fill the entire space under the coverslip.\nPlace the slide on a slide holder and leave it under the fume hood. Proceed to microscopic observations after at least 4 h and during the following 4–5 days.\n4. Combined Alexander Staining and Herr's 4½ Clearing of Anthers\nNOTE: The original Alexander protocol is based on releasing pollen grains on the slide before staining. An efficient and more informative, modified Alexander staining and clearing procedure is the staining of mature pollen grains within mature but non-dehiscent anthers.\nChoose freshly harvested flower buds that are about to open with non-dehiscent anthers.\n\tNOTE: Do not take younger flower buds because Alexander staining is intended for mature pollen grains and does not efficiently stain immature pollen grains. A minimum of 5 flowers per treatment harvested from different plants and inflorescences is recommended.",
    "Prepare a 96-well plate with enough Alexander's solution to submerge a flower bud. Expose the anthers by removing the sepals and petals and immerse them in Alexander's solution. Keep the samples under the fume hood for 1–3 h.\nReplace Alexander's solution with Herr's 4½ solution and place the multi-well plate back under the fume hood for an overnight incubation.\nUsing forceps, gently move the cleared flower buds onto a new slide. Since some carry-over of Alexander's solution may occur, use a blotting paper to remove as much clearing solution as possible.\nDissect the stamens and remove all other tissues. Follow the steps in section 3 using Herr's 4½ solution.\n5. Removing the Exine from Pollen Grains\nNOTE: We recommend using Carnoy's fixative for DAPI staining.\nFollow the fixation and dissection procedures described in sections 1 and 2. By now, one should have one to many stamens on the slide within a minimum amount of 70% ethanol.\nUse a blotting paper to remove excess ethanol, and add 5–10 µL of DAPI solution. Using a couple of syringes with needles, release the pollen grains within that small amount of solution (e.g., use one syringe to immobilize the stamen and the other to release the pollen grains). Add another 5 µL of DAPI if the solution dries out.\nRemoving all debris of the stamen is a critical step, such that only pollen grains are left between the slide and the coverslip.\nPlace a coverslip on the specimen-bearing slide by lowering it sideways and add the minimal amount of DAPI solution required to fill the space. Place an index finger on the coverslip, and without squashing too much make a quick, firm, and short sliding movement.",
    "NOTE: To gauge the necessary force and amplitude of the sliding movement, this step should be practiced several times, checking the results each time under the microscope.\nAdd DAPI solution if needed and place the slide in a humid box in the dark at 4 °C for 15 min to 1 h. Proceed to observe samples under wide-field fluorescence or confocal microscopy within 24 h. Try to combine this procedure with SDS clearing to check whether further improvements can be obtained.\n6. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) Clearing\nNOTE: Depending on the floral organ to be analyzed, and on the researcher's skills to dissect very soft and small specimens, the SDS treatment can be carried out either before (for experienced researchers) or after the dissection step (for less experienced researchers) on methanol-acetic acid fixed material.\nUse a watch maker's glass, a concave slide, or a microcentrifuge tube to incubate dissected or non-dissected samples in 1% SDS and 0.2 N NaOH solution overnight at room temperature.\nHandle with care because the sample is very soft and has a transparent appearance. Rinse several times with water.\n\tNOTE: Remnants of the SDS solution might lead to precipitation when adding the staining solution, e.g., aniline blue.\nFor non-dissected samples, follow the dissection procedure described in section 2, using water instead of 70% ethanol. After dissecting the desired tissue, remove any remnants and debris, and any excess water with a blotting paper, then add 20–40 µL of staining solution, and proceed with step 6.5.\nFor dissected samples, carefully move the sample from the washing solution and place it onto a clean slide, and add 20–40 µL of staining solution.",
    "Gently place a coverslip on the slide by lowering it sideways. Take care not to squash the preparation. If the tissue is too soft, place any thin separator in between the slide and the coverslip at its corners (e.g., tape or a broken coverslip), leaving a chamber-like space between slide and coverslip, such that the coverslip doesn't crush the specimen.\nPlace all the slides within a humid box, cover it with aluminum foil, and place it at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Proceed to observe the specimen using widefield fluorescence or confocal microscopy within 24 h.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
