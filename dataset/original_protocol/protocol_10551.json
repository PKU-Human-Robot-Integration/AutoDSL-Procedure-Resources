    "1. Preparation of Chip\nRemove chip gel from package and place into a one-well rectangular plate, gel film side down.\nWash gel in 25 ml 1x PBS for 15 min, repeat two times.\nSet gel on glass plate and label orientation of gel accordingly.\nGently press an inverted bottomless 96-well plate onto the gel; make sure that all wells of the bottomless well plate are within the area of the gel.\nUse 1.5’’ binder clips on each side of the plate to secure clamping with the glass.\nAspirate off excess PBS buffer in each well.\n2. Loading Cells\nPrepare cell suspensions:\n\t\nFor suspension cell lines, dilute cell suspension in media to obtain a final concentration of 105–106 cells/ml.\nFor adherent cell lines, follow normal detaching/trypsinization protocols and dilute detached cells in media to a final concentration of 105–106 cells/ml. If cells aggregate, pass cell suspension in a cell filter to obtain a single cell suspension.\nAdd 100 μl of cell suspension to each well of the 96-well plate.\nCover plate with the gel film to prevent evaporation of media.\nAllow cells to load for at least 30 min in 37 °C incubator.\nRemove chip from incubator and aspirate media from each well.\nRemove binder clips and bottomless 96-well plate; hold the chip with the glass plate at an angle and gently rinse with 1x PBS to remove excess cells on agarose.\nCheck cell loading using a bright field microscope with a 4X objective lens. If insufficient loading is observed, repeat from step 2.1.\nPlace loaded chip on an even surface (lab bench). Overlay chip with 1% low melting point (LMP) agarose that is pre-warmed at 37 °C. Use approximately 2–3 ml of LMP agarose is needed for each chip.",
    "Allow overlay to solidify first at RT for 3 min and then move to 4 °C refrigerator for 5 min for complete gelation.\n3. Dosing and Repair\nNOTE: To study baseline DNA damage level, skip to Step 4.\nCarefully align the wells of the chip (created from previous clamping) with the wells of a new bottomless 96-well plate. Re-press the bottomless 96-well plate on top and secure clamping with binder clips.\nAdd 100 μl of chemical of desired dose to each well of the 96-well plate; perform dosing/treatment on ice or in 4 °C refrigerator for desired amount of time.\nAfter dosing, aspirate chemicals from each well and rinse away residual chemical using 1x PBS. If direct damage is studied here, proceed to Step 4.\nTo study repair kinetics, allow cells in the chip to repair in media at 37 °C. Lyse (proceed to Step 4) at specific time points.\n\tNOTE: Repair can be performed on-chip with a bottomless 96-well plate attached, or the chip can be cut into separate pieces after removal of the bottomless 96-well plate.\n4. Lysis\nTo perform alkaline comet assay:\n\t\nMake working alkaline lysis buffer by adding 1% Triton X-100 to alkaline lysis stock solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 10). Prepare approximately 25 ml of working lysis buffer for each chip.\nPre-chill working alkaline lysis buffer at 4 °C.\nSubmerge chip in cool working alkaline lysis buffer and allow lysis to perform O/N in 4 °C refrigerator.\nTo perform neutral comet assay:\n\t\nMake working neutral lysis buffer by adding 1% Triton X-100 and 10% DMSO to neutral lysis stock solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% N-Lauroylsarcosine, pH 9.5). Prepare approximately 25 ml working lysis buffer for each chip.",
    "Pre-warm working neutral lysis buffer at 43 °C.\nSubmerge chip in warm working neutral lysis buffer and allow lysis to perform O/N in 43 °C incubator.\n5. Electrophoresis\nTo perform alkaline comet assay:\n\t\nRemove lysis buffer and quickly rinse chip with 1x PBS.\nSecure chip in an electrophoresis chamber with gel film side facing down using double-sided tape.\nBring the chamber to a 4 °C cold room.\nFill the chamber with cold alkaline electrophoresis buffer (0.3 M NaOH, 1 mM Na2EDTA) to a level that just covers the gel.\nAllow for alkaline unwinding for 40 min.\nRun electrophoresis at 1 V/cm and 300 mA for 30 min in the cold room. Adjust the volume of electrophoresis buffer in the chamber to achieve desired running current.\nTo perform neutral comet assay:\n\t\nRemove lysis buffer and rinse chip with neutral electrophoresis buffer (2 mM Na2EDTA, 90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, pH 8.5) for 2 x 15 min at 4 °C.\nSecure chip in an electrophoresis chamber with gel film side facing down using double-sided tape.\nBring the chamber to a 4 °C cold room.\nFill the chamber with cold neutral electrophoresis buffer (2 mM Na2EDTA, 90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, pH 8.5) to a level that just covers the gel.\nAllow the gel to sit in cold room for 60 min.\nRun electrophoresis at 0.6 V/cm and 6 mA for 60 min in the cold room. Adjust the volume of electrophoresis buffer in the chamber to achieve desired running current.\n6. Fluorescent Imaging\nRemove chip from electrophoresis chamber from cold room.\nNeutralize the gels in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris, pH 7.5) for 2 x 15 min in 4 °C refrigerator.",
    "Stain the chip with fluorescent DNA stain of choice (i.e., SYBR Gold, Ethidium Bromide) under factory recommended procedures. Image using fluorescent microscopy.\n7. Data Analysis\nAnalyze comet Images by standard comet assay software such as Komet 5.5."
