    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMono-ADP-ribosylation of YFP-GAP\nTiming: 4 h\nIn this step, the purified YFP-GAP protein will be mono-ADP-ribosylated at a specific cysteine residue at the C-terminus of the GAP-tag using PtxS1. The resulting protein will be used as the binding probe for the screening assay.\nPrepare the mono-ADP-ribosylation reaction mix.\nPrepare the following reagents in a 15 mL falcon tube.\nCritical: Avoid mixing high concentrations of NAD+ and PtxS1 during preparation of the mixture. Mix all components and add PtxS1 last. Immediately gently mix by inverting the tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1404_11.csv\nLet the reaction incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 1 h.\nNote: The incubation time can be used to prepare the IMAC column in step 2.\nTo ensure completeness of the reaction, add again 15 μL of PtxS1 (500 μM) and 15 μL of NAD+ (50 mM) to the reaction mixture.\nLet the reaction incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 1 h.\nRemove unreacted NAD+, side-products and PtxS1 by IMAC.\nPrepare a 5 mL HiTrap IMAC HP column by charging it with NiSO4 and equilibrate it with lysis buffer.\nLoad the reaction mixture to the column at 1 mL/min.\nWash the column with 5 column volumes (CV) of lysis buffer.\nElute the ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP using elution buffer.\nExchange the buffer to SEC buffer using a 15 mL Amicon centrifugal filter with 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff.\nConcentrate the IMAC eluate to approximately 0.5–1 mL using the same centrifugal filter.\nAliquot the protein in PCR reaction tubes (5–25 μL per tube) and flash freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen.\nNote: If an assay for binders of poly-ADP-ribose is prepared, the mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP may be used immediately or be kept overnight (up to 24 h) at 4°C for further modification by PARP2 (see next steps).",
    "Store the aliquots at −70°C or below.\nOptional: Analyze the modification of the protein by mass spectrometry. The addition of a single ADP-ribosyl group corresponds to an additional monoisotopic mass of 541.061 Da. If only partial modification is observed, see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPause point: The frozen aliquots may be used at any time for validation or screening. We have not observed any issues after storing the protein for 1 year.\nPoly-ADP-ribosylation of mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP and PARP2 (required for poly-ADP-ribosyl binders only)\nTiming: 4 h\nIn this step, the mono-ADP-ribosyl group at the YFP-GAP protein from the previous step will be poly-ADP-ribosylated using PARP2. The resulting protein will be used as the binding probe for the screening assay of poly-ADP-ribosyl binders. In a similar manner, PARP2 will be auto-modified with poly-ADP-ribosyl chains, which can be used as a control during validation.\nPrepare the poly-ADP-ribosylation reaction mix for YFP-GAP.\nPrepare the following reagents in a 15 mL falcon tube.\nCritical: Avoid mixing high concentrations of NAD+ and PARP2 during preparation of the mixture. Mix all components and add PARP2 last. Immediately gently mix by inverting the tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1404_12.csv\nLet the reaction incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 2 h.\nNote: The incubation time can be used to prepare the IMAC column in step 4.\nRemove unreacted NAD+, side-products and PARP2 by IMAC.\nPrepare a 5 mL HiTrap IMAC HP column by charging it with NiSO4 and equilibrate it with lysis buffer.\nLoad the reaction mixture to the column at 1 mL/min.\nWash the column with 5 column volumes (CV) of lysis buffer.\nElute the poly-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP using elution buffer.\nExchange the buffer to SEC buffer using a 15 mL Amicon centrifugal filter with 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff.\nConcentrate the IMAC eluate to approximately 0.5–1 mL using the same centrifugal filter.",
    "Aliquot the protein in PCR reaction tubes (5–25 μL per tube) and flash freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen.\nStore the aliquots at −70°C or below.\nPrepare poly-ADP-ribosylated PARP2 to be used as a control during validation of the assay.\nPrepare the following reagents in a 15 mL tube.\nCritical: Avoid mixing high concentrations of NAD+ and PARP2 during preparation of the mixture. Mix all components and add PARP2 last. Immediately gently mix by inverting the tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1404_13.csv\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAliquot the protein in PCR reaction tubes (5–25 μL per tube) and flash freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen.\nStore the aliquots at −70°C or below.\nPause point: The frozen aliquots may be used at any time for validation or screening. We have not observed any issues after storing the protein for 1 year.\nSignal validation\nTiming: 5 h\nIn this step, a ratiometric FRET signal (rFRET) upon interaction of the CFP-fused binder and the mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP will be determined. Controls are used to show the absence or reduction of the signal.\nNote: If poly-ADP-ribosyl binders are to be used, make the following changes in steps a-d: The assay buffer is [10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01%(v/v) Tween-20]. Substitute 5 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP with 500 nM poly-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP. Use 250 nM CFP-fusion protein instead of 1 μM. Substitute 200 μM ADP-ribose with 2.5 μM poly-ADP-ribosylated PARP2. These changes can be used in the subsequent steps.\nValidate the FRET signal by competition with ADP-ribose and unmodified protein controls.\nNote: Black polypropylene plates should be used for the FRET assay. The following protocol is designed for 384-well ShallowWell plates (Fisherbrand). Plates from other manufacturers may be suitable, however a higher assay volume per well may be necessary particularly if 96-well plates are used.",
    "Prepare in assay buffer [10 mM Bis-Tris-Propane pH = 7.0, 3%(w/v) PEG20,000, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mM TCEP] 50 μL of FRET assay mixture containing 1 μM CFP-fusion protein and 5 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP.\nCritical: The assay buffer contains PEG20,000 to promote molecular crowding thus enhancing the FRET signal. The buffer has a low ionic strength due to absence of sodium chloride. Should the proteins precipitate in the buffer, use a buffer without PEG20,000 and/or include sodium chloride in the buffer (e.g. 25–100 mM).\nPrepare in assay buffer 50 μL of control mixture 1 containing 1 μM CFP-fusion protein and 5 μM unmodified YFP-GAP.\nPrepare in assay buffer 50 μL control mixture 2 containing 1 μM CFP-fusion protein, 5 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP and 200 μM ADP-ribose.\nOptional: Prepare in assay buffer 50 μL DMSO test mixture containing 1 μM CFP-fusion protein, 5 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP and 1% (v/v) DMSO.\nFour replicates are prepared per condition. Pipette four times 10 μL of assay buffer (blank) and each mixture prepared in the steps above into separate wells of a black 384-well plate. An example layout for this is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1404-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Signal validation\nAn example for the signal validation of CFP-MacroD1 binding to mono-ADP-ribosylated (MAR) YFP-GAP is shown.\n(A) Plate layout for comparison of rFRET signals with controls that should abolish FRET with example rFRET values determined with CFP-MacroD1.\n(B) Plate layout for a dose-response curve using ADP-ribose with example dose-response curve using ADP-ribose done with CFP-MacroD1. Data are mean ± standard deviation with n = 4 replicates.\nLet the plate incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nMeasure the fluorescence emission of each well used with a multimode plate reader.\nSet up a protocol for two separate fluorescence intensity measurements per well.",
    "The first fluorescent measurement is set to an excitation wavelength of 430 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission wavelength of 477 nm (10 nm bandwidth).\nNote: In earlier reports we used 410 nm as the excitation wavelength to avoid direct excitation of YFP. However, we found that intrinsic compound fluorescence during screening is typically less apparent when an excitation wavelength of 430 nm is used, which we now recommend.\nThe second fluorescent measurement is set to an excitation wavelength of 430 nm (20 nm bandwidth) and emission wavelength of 527 nm (10 nm bandwidth). All other settings such as the gain, settle time and mirror are to be kept the same as in the previous step.\nThe wells containing only buffer serve as blank. The average fluorescence intensity of the blank is subtracted from the fluorescence intensity of the sample wells for both respective emission wavelengths used.\nThe ratiometric FRET signal of each well is calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity at 527 nm emission wavelength by the fluorescence intensity at 477 nm emission wavelength.\nNote: An example for this calculation is shown in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1404-Mmc1.xlsx].\nEvaluate that the rFRET signal measured for the samples containing the FRET assay mixture is significantly higher compared to the signals of the control mixtures 1 and 2. In case 200 μM ADP-ribose did inhibit the signal compared to control mixture 1 significantly less, see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]. If prepared, the DMSO test control should not have an rFRET value significantly lower compared to the FRET assay mixture.",
    "Note: We found that a difference of 0.2–0.3 in the FRET ratio between FRET mixture and controls is a sufficient signal to set up a screening assay. If the difference in rFRET is significantly larger (e.g. 1.0–1.5), a lower concentration of the proteins may be used (e.g. 500 nM CFP-fusion and 2.5 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP).\nNote: We describe here the minimal validation required to set up the protocol. If more extensive validation is desired, we recommend the NCBI online resource “Assay Guidance Manual” (Coussens et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) for more specific instructions on e.g. inter-day and inter-plate signal variation or spatial uniformity assessment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83783/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83783/]).\nPause point: Further validation or preparation of screening assays may be continued at any later time.\nPrepare a dose-response curve with a serial dilution series of ADP-ribose. (optional)\nNote: This part of the validation is not required but gives additional insight into the quality of the signal. Alternatively, a decrease of rFRET signal over time by addition of TEV protease to remove CFP or phosphodiesterase I to remove the mono- or poly-ADP-ribosyl groups may be used as additional validation.\nPrepare in assay buffer 250 μL of 2× FRET assay mixture containing 2 μM CFP-fusion protein and 10 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP.\nNote: This volume is sufficient to prepare four replicates for each condition.\nPrepare a 2× concentrated half-logarithmic serial dilution (1:3.16 dilution steps) starting at a concentration of 2 mM ADP-ribose. All solutions are prepared in assay buffer. Samples for each concentration should contain at least 25 μL.\nNote: For poly-ADP-ribosyl binding proteins, prepare a half-logarithmic serial dilution with poly-ADP-ribosylated PARP2 instead of ADP-ribose. The starting concentration should be 5 μM.\nPipette four times 5 μL for each concentration of the 2× concentrated dilution series into a 384-well assay plate (columns 3–12, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Pipette four times 5 μL buffer into column 2 of the assay plate.\nPipette four times 10 μL buffer into column 1 of the assay plate.\nDispense 5 μL of the 2× FRET assay mixture into each well in columns 2–12.\nNote: This procedure can be done manually or with an automated low-volume liquid dispenser such as Formulatrix Mantis. When transferring the solutions manually, special care must be taken to mix the solutions without creating excessive air bubbles.\nOptional: Spin down the plate at 500–1000×g for 5 min to remove potential air bubbles. We recommend this step particularly if an automated dispenser has been used, as formation of air bubbles or splashing of the solution may commonly occur.\nLet the plate incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nDetermine the rFRET signals as shown in step 6f.\nNote: Cover the plate in-between the steps with a lid or adhesive seal to prevent evaporation and accumulation of dust in the wells. Keep the plate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) throughout the measurement procedure.\nEvaluate that the rFRET signal measured result in a curve with decreasing signals for increasing ADP-ribose concentrations. The curve should flatten at high ADP-ribose concentrations (>100 μM).\nPause point: Compound screening may be started at any later time.\nScreening\nTiming: 30 min per plate\nThe steps to screen for compounds in a single dose format using a small chemical compound library are detailed in the following section. An example of screening 336 compounds in a 384-well plate including blanks and controls is shown with a final compound concentration of 20 μM.\nTransfer the compounds dissolved in DMSO to a screening plate using Echo 650.",
    "Note: The screening plates may also be ordered and prepared externally. In this example, we assume a compound collection containing 336 compounds in Echo-compatible source plates are present.\nTransfer 20 nL of the 10 mM compound stocks dissolved in DMSO to a 384-well assay plate. The compounds are dispensed to wells in columns 4–24 according to the layout in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1404-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Screening layout\nOptional: Add 20 nL of DMSO to the control wells. This is especially advised if the rFRET signal is affected by DMSO.\nCover the plate with a lid if used on the same day for screening. Seal the plate with an adhesive seal if the plate will be stored for a longer period.\nPause point: The plate may be stored at −20°C until use.\nPrepare the solutions required for the screening.\nNote: While we have not observed issues like a reduced rFRET signal after long-term storage of the protein aliquots at −70°C, we recommend to test the signal on a small scale before starting the screening. The rFRET signals should be comparable to the ones observed during the signal validation steps. If significantly lower signals are observed, the recombinant proteins would need to be prepared freshly.\nPrepare 4 mL of the FRET assay mixture containing 1 μM CFP-fusion protein and 5 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP.\nPrepare 200 μL of the ADP-ribose control mixture containing 1 μM CFP-fusion protein, 5 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP and 200 μM ADP-ribose.\nNote: If the results in the validation showed that 200 μM ADP-ribose did not inhibit the rFRET signal to approximately >95%, a higher concentration of ADP-ribose may be chosen as control.",
    "Dispense the solutions using Formulatrix Mantis low-volume liquid dispenser (10 μL/well) according to the layout in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Buffer is transferred to column 1, the FRET assay solution is transferred to columns 2 as well as 4–24 and the ADP-ribose control solution is transferred to column 3.\nAlternatives: Any suitable low-volume liquid dispenser may be used. We recommend the use of automatic dispensers in the screening step because manual pipetting is time intensive and may lead to evaporation and introduction of air bubbles.\nSpin down the plate at 500–1000×g for 5 min to remove potential air bubbles.\nDetermine the rFRET signal of each well as shown in step 6f.\nCalculate the apparent inhibition percentages for each well containing the screening compounds. As reference, the average rFRET value of the control FRET assay mixture (column 2) is set to 0% inhibition, while the average rFRET value for the ADP-ribose control mixture (column 3) is set to 100% inhibition.\nNote: In the case that many compounds show an apparent inhibition significantly over 100% or below 0%, the compound library used likely contained several compounds that interfere with the signal through intrinsic fluorescence or quenching. Additional filtering steps may be used as described previously for a similar assay system (Sowa et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nOptional: Assess the signal quality using the rFRET signals of the control FRET assay mixture and the ADP-ribose control mixture by calculating the Z′-factor (Zhang et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nSelect compounds that show an apparent inhibition of 30% or more as hits. In our experience, this is a robust hit limit. A different cutoff percentage may be chosen depending on the desired hit rate.\nPause point: The hit compounds can be validated at any later time. For the following validation, the hit compounds may need to be ordered from vendors.",
    "Hit validation\nTiming: varies\nPrepare a dose-response curve with a serial dilution series of the hit compounds.\nNote: The following steps describe the validation of a single compound but can be upscaled depending on the number of compounds to be validated. Dose-response curves for 12 hit compounds can be measured per 384-well plate. In the following, duplicates are used for each condition, however a higher number of replicates may also be used if desired.\nPrepare in assay buffer 90 μL of 2× FRET assay mixture containing 2 μM CFP-fusion protein and 10 μM mono-ADP-ribosylated YFP-GAP.\nPrepare 25 μL of 400 μM ADP-ribose in assay buffer.\nPrepare a 2× concentrated half-logarithmic serial dilution (1:3.16 dilution steps) starting at a concentration of 200 μM compound. All solutions are prepared in assay buffer. Samples for each concentration should contain at least 25 μL.\nNote: Compounds for the dose-response curve may be dispensed directly from compound stocks using an acoustic dispenser such as Echo 650.\nTransfer four times 5 μL for each concentration of the prepared 2× concentrated compound dilution series into a 384-well assay plate (columns 3–8, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1404-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Dose-response hit validation\nTransfer 5 μL of 400 μM ADP-ribose to each well in column 2.\nDispense 5 μL of the 2× FRET assay mixture into each well in rows A and B.\nFill each well to a final volume of 10 μL using assay buffer.\nNote: This procedure can be done manually or with an automated low-volume liquid dispenser such as Formulatrix Mantis. When transferring the solutions manually, special care has to be taken to mix the solutions without creating excessive air bubbles.\nSpin down the plate at 500–1000×g for 5 min to remove potential air bubbles.",
    "Determine the rFRET signals as shown in step 6f. For each condition containing compounds, use the respective wells containing the compound in buffer as a blank (i.e., subtract the average fluorescence intensities of wells C8 and D8 from the fluorescence intensities obtained for wells A8 and B8).\nCalculate the apparent inhibition percentages as described in step 13. Dose-response curve analysis to determine the IC50 values for each compound may be performed (see “quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]”).\nCompounds that show desired inhibition may now be taken for further validation and testing such as functional assays, isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, differential scanning fluorimetry or protein X-ray crystallography. These methods are not part of this protocol and may be adapted for the specific target protein used.\nOptional: Once a target compound was validated to bind to the desired protein, the assay described above may be established with other ADP-ribosyl binding or hydrolyzing proteins to test specificity of the inhibitor. Through the simple and homogenous setup of the assay, it is possible to test inhibition of compounds against many binders simultaneously as described previously (Sowa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9])."
