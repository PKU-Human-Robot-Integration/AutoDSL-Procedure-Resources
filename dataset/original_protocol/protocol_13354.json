    "We performed retrospective analysis of the clinical data of male patients, initially diagnosed with epididymal cysts, admitted to the urology inpatient department of the Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Technology (the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province). Written, informed consent must be obtained from patients before surgery.\n1. Clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclude patients who are below 45 years of age and have a need to preserve fertility.\n\t​NOTE: The patient in this study was younger than 45 years old.\nInclude patients with a clinician's preliminary diagnosis of epididymal cystic occupancy following examination with type-B ultrasound or computer tomography (CT) imaging.\nExclude any patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction, obvious sexual dysfunction, or anaspermia. Exclude patients with a testicular mass, epididymal tuberculosis, and patients who have difficulty to determine the relationship between the testis and the neoplasm.\n2. Patient preparation\nAfter performing the relevant examination and active preoperative preparation, fully explain the relevant conditions, surgical plans, and related risks.\nDiscuss with the patient and his family members the patient's condition, surgical plan, selection, and possible risks and complications. Obtain consent from the patient and his family members for testicular and epididymal exploration and microscopic cyst resection.\nInstruments for operation\n\t\nMake sure that a surgical microscope and microsurgical instruments are available.\nPreparation for operation\n\t\nClean and shave the inguinal/subinguinal skin and scrotum before surgery.\nThe surgical site need not be sterilized before surgery. As a routine procedure, clean the scrotum with soap and shave the surgical area using a razor.\nPlace the patient on the operating table in a supine position after general anesthesia.\n\t\t​NOTE: Anesthesia is provided by the anesthetist. The anesthetist chooses the anesthetic agent and the dosage to be used.\n3. Procedure\nExpose and explore the testis and epididymis in the incision.",
    "Perform a 2.5-3 cm scrotal skin incision with a surgical knife. Cut the scrotal flesh membrane and testicular sheath membrane layer by layer with an electric knife.\nCarefully explore the testis and epididymis to find and confirm the epididymal cyst. Change/stop the surgical plan if solid epididymal tumors or masses derived from the testis are found.\nLift the epididymis out of the incision. Find the epididymal cyst.\nMicroscopic cyst resection\n\t\nBring an operating microscope into the operating field and examine the cord under a 6x-10x power magnification.\nUse an electric knife to cut the epididymal capsule at the base of the epididymal cyst and normal epididymal tissue. Open up the epididymal capsule carefully and avoid opening the epididymal cyst cavity (see Figure 1).\nCarefully explore the space between the epididymal cyst wall and the epididymal tissue (epididymal tubule). Based on this anatomical level, gradually microseparate the epididymal cyst along the cyst wall with microscissors and microscopic forceps. Carefully isolate the epididymal tissue (epididymal tubule) surrounding the epididymal cyst to the base of the epididymal cyst (see Figure 2).\nMicroseparate the epididymal cyst from its base and the gap between the cyst and normal epididymal tissue. Excise the epididymal cyst from the base with microscissors or an electric knife after occlusion of the epididymal tissue with a microvascular clamp or ligation by a microsuture (7-0 or 6-0) (see Figure 3).\nCarefully dissect the separation and avoid epididymal cyst wall breakage, especially on blood epididymal cysts (see Figure 4) or large epididymal cysts with clear cystic fluid inside (see Figure 5). If the cyst wall is damaged, carefully clamp the breach with microvascular forceps to avoid fluid overflow in the cyst. Remove the epididymal cyst completely and preserve the noninvasive epididymal tubular patency as much as possible.\n4. Finish the operation",
    "Carefully perform micro hemostasis. Stitch the incisions on the epididymal capsule and periorchium in layers. Then suture the scrotal wound.\nSend the mass (cyst) to the pathology department for pathological examination.\nLeave the patients in bed for 1 day after surgery and discharge them 1-3 days after the surgery.\n5. Postoperative follow-up\nNOTE: The postoperative follow-up lasts for 3-50 months. Conduct the below tests/examinations in the follow-up.\nCheck the patient for scrotal swelling, pain, and other clinical symptoms after surgery.\nPerform a detailed physical examination, Including checking the scrotal wound, testis, and epididymis.\nPerform type-B ultrasound examination on the testis and epididymis.\nSubscription Required.
