The cells cultured for 0 or 3 days in vitro (DIV) correspond to the neurogenic phase of development, whereas those cultured for 9 DIV correspond to the astrogliogenic phase (Hirabayashi and Gotoh, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Qian et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nDay 1\nKill pregnant Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice by cervical dislocation at embryonic day (E) 11 to 12, with E1 being defined as 12 h after detection of the vaginal plug.\nNote: Approximately 5 × 105 NPCs can be obtained from a single mouse embryo at E11-12.\nNote: C57BL/6 mice also can serve as a source of NPCs for culture.\nNote: The procedure for sacrifice of mice should be in accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee.\nRemove the uterus and immerse it in ice-cold DMEM-F12 containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a 100-mm plastic culture dish.\nNote: After isolation of embryos from the uterus, all manipulations are performed in ice-cold DMEM-F12 containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin unless indicated otherwise.\nRemove embryos one by one from the embryonic sacs and transfer then to another 100-mm dish filled with ice-cold medium.\nHold down the head of each embryo with forceps and cut off the telencephalon with a scalpel.\nPull and tease apart the skin from the telencephalon and separate the telencephalon from the brainstem.\nRemove the vessel membrane (meninges) from the telencephalon.\nIsolate the neocortex from the ventral telencephalon.\nCollect the dissected neocortices into a 1.7-mL prelubricated microcentrifuge tube containing 500 μL of DMEM-F12 containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin.",
    "Maintain the tube on ice until the neocortices settle to the bottom of the tube and then remove the medium.\nDigest the neocortical tissue with Neuron Dissociation Solutions (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) consisting of Enzyme solution, Dispersion solution and Isolation solution.\nAdd 300 μL of Enzyme solution to the tissue and incubate for 20 min at 37°C.\nCentrifuge the digest at 160 × g for 2 min at room temperature and remove the resulting supernatant.\nAdd 300 μL of Dispersion solution to the pellet and triturate gently with the use of a 1-mL micropipette.\nCritical: Take care during trituration not to damage the cell suspension by pipetting too vigorously.\nAdd 300 μL of Isolation solution as a layer below the cell suspension.\nNote: The specific gravity of Isolation solution is greater than that of Dispersion solution. Therefore, by gently adding Isolation solution to the bottom of the tube, these solutions become separated into two layers— Dispersion solution in the top layer and Isolation solution in the bottom layer. Be careful not to disturb the interface between the layered solutions. If the solutions become mixed, it will not be possible to remove the papain.\nCentrifuge the tube at 160 × g for 5 min at room temperature and then remove the supernatant.\nPrepare the DMEM-F12 supplemented with B-27 (final B-27 concentration of 2%), recombinant human FGF2 (final FGF2 concentration of 20 ng/mL), and recombinant human EGF (final EGF concentration of 20 ng/mL).\nNote: Prewarm the DMEM-F12 (without any supplements) to 37°C in a water bath for at least 20 min before starting dissociation of neocortices.\nGently suspend the cell pellet in 4 mL of DMEM-F12 supplemented with B-27, FGF2, and EGF.\nCount the number of isolated cells with the use of a cell counting chamber (Neubauer haemocytometry, Electron Microscopy Sciences)",
    "Note: When counting the number of cells, it is recommended to mix 10 μl of cell suspension with an equal volume of Trypan blue solution and evaluate the cell viability under a microscope. The percentage of cells stained with Trypan blue should be less than 2–3%.\nCollect 0.5 × 106 to 1.0 × 106 dissociated cells into a 1.7-mL prelubricated microcentrifuge tube as neurogenic NPCs.\nAdd 0.1 volume of 11% formaldehyde solution to the cell suspension (final formaldehyde concentration of 1%) and rotate the tube for 10 min on a tube rotator.\nNote: The formaldehyde solution should be added dropwise to the cell suspension in order to avoid a localized high formaldehyde concentration.\nAdd 2.5 M glycine to the cell suspension to achieve a final concentration of 125 mM.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 2,700 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the resulting supernatant and then freeze the pellet in liquid nitrogen and store it at –80°C.\nPause point: The pellet can be stored at –80°C for at least several months.\nThe remaining dissociated cells are cultured at a density of 3.0 × 105 cells/mL in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with B-27, FGF2, and EGF, resulting in neurosphere formation.\nNote: Culture the dissociated cells in a dish at least 60 mm in diameter (e.g., 100-mm dish, 3.0 × 106 cells in 10 mL medium; 60-mm dish, 1.2 × 106 cells in 4 mL medium). Use of a smaller culture dish can result in aggregation of neurospheres, with such large aggregates being difficult to dissociate completely.\nNote: Do not move the culture dish after its transfer to the incubator. Even a slight movement can also result in the aggregation of neurospheres.\nDay 4",
    "After culture for 3 DIV, transfer the neurospheres to a 15-mL Falcon tube. Centrifuge the tube at 200 × g for 2 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant.\nCritical: Remove as much of the supernatant as possible after centrifugation. Residual medium in the tube can inhibit the enzymatic activity of trypsin.\nAdd 100 μL of DNase I solution into 4 mL of trypsin solution (final DNase I concentration of 0.1 mg/mL).\nAdd 4 mL of trypsin solution containing DNase I to the neurosphere pellet.\nCritical: Take care not to prewarm trypsin at 37°C (in a water bath) for >10 min. Incubation for longer can result in self-digestion of trypsin and a consequent reduction in dissociation efficiency.\nNote: DNase I solution should be added to the trypsin solution immediately before the addition of trypsin to the neurosphere pellet. Otherwise, trypsin digests the DNase I and reduces the efficiency of genomic DNA digestion.\nIncubate the mixture for 10 min at 37°C.\nNote: Gently mix the suspension every 2–3 min with the use of a 10-mL disposable pipette in order to promote dissociation of the neurospheres.\nAdd 40 μL of ovomucoid solution into 4 mL of aCSF (final ovomucoid concentration of 0.7 mg/mL).\nAdd 4 mL of aCSF containing ovomucoid to the cell suspension from step 21.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 200 × g for 2 min at room temperature and then remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with B-27, FGF2, and EGF and then mechanically dissociate the NPCs with the use of a 10-mL disposable pipette.",
    "Critical: Lightly press the tip of the pipette against the bottom of the tube and pipette the cell suspension at least 10 times. This step is critical for complete dissociation of the cells. Be careful not to press the tip of the pipette too hard against the bottom of the tube, however, as this can result in cell damage or death.\nDetermine the cell number with a cell counting chamber and set aside 0.5 × 106 to 1.0 × 106 of the cells for ChIP analysis of NPCs in the neurogenic phase at 3 DIV.\nCulture the remaining dissociated cells at a density of 3.0 × 105 cells/mL in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with B-27, FGF2, and EGF.\nRepeat steps 18–27 after successive 3-day intervals to obtain NPCs at 6 or 9 DIV.\nDay 10\nTransfer 0.5 × 106 to 1.0 × 106 dissociated cells after culture for 9 DIV into a 1.7-mL prelubricated microcentrifuge tube for analysis as astrogliogenic NPCs.\nAdd 0.1 volume of 11% formaldehyde solution to the cell suspension (final formaldehyde concentration of 1%) from steps 26 or 29 and rotate the tube for 10 min on a tube rotator.\nAdd 2.5 M glycine to the cell suspension to achieve a final concentration of 125 mM.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 2,700 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and then freeze the pellet in liquid nitrogen and store it at –80°C.\nPause point: The pellet can be stored at –80°C for at least one year.\nPreparation of antibody-conjugated magnetic beads—Days 11 and 12\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Antibodies that bind the protein of interest are linked to magnetic beads. The antibody to H2Aub from Merck-Millipore (#05–678) is mouse immunoglobulin M (IgM) and shows low affinity for both protein A and G beads. The antibody to the μ light chain of mouse IgM (Merck-Millipore, #12–488) shows high affinity for the beads, and is therefore used to link the antibody to H2Aub and the protein A beads. The specificity of this H2Aub antibody has been confirmed by the reduction of signals in Ring1A/B double knockout NPCs compared to contorl NPCs in Western blotting and ChIP-qPCR analyses (Tsuboi et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nNote: The following H2Aub ChIP protocol is optimized from one previously described (Endoh et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Stock et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nDay 1\nResuspend protein A magnetic beads (Dynabeads) by vortex-mixing for >30 s.\nAlternatives: Protein A/G beads (Pierce) can be used as an alternative to protein A beads (Dynabeads).\nTransfer a volume of beads corresponding to 20 μL (600 μg) of beads per ChIP reaction and 20 μL of beads per sample (for preclearing) to a 1.7-mL prelubricated microcentrifuge tube.\nPlace the tube on the magnet (DynaMag-2) to separate the beads from the solution and then remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nNote: Complete separation of the beads from the solution can be facilitated by swirling the beads gently until the solution becomes clear.\nNote: When removing the supernatant by aspiration, attach a 27G injection needle to the tip of the aspirator. This will reduce the suction force and the risk of aspirating the magnetic beads by accident.\nWash the beads once with 250 μL of PBS containing 0.5% BSA by vortex-mixing or gentle tapping.\nPlace the tube on the magnet to separate the beads from the solution and again remove the supernatant.",
    "Add 250 μL of PBS containing 0.5% BSA to the tube containing the beads. Subsequent nonspecific binding of protein to the magnetic beads is minimized by this beads-blocking step.\nNote: This step is for blocking beads with BSA, and a volume of 250 μl is required for the solution to be stirred by the rotator.\nIncubate the tube on a tube rotator at approximately 5 rotations per minute for 1 h at 4°C (in a cold room).\nPlace the tube on the magnet to separate the beads from the solution and remove the supernatant.\nAdd a volume of PBS containing 0.5% BSA corresponding to that of the beads transferred to the tube in step 35 (for example, if 100 μL of beads were used initially, then add 100 μL of PBS containing 0.5% BSA to the tube).\nTransfer beads for ChIP reaction into a new 1.7-mL prelubricated microcentrifuge tube and proceed to step 44. Keep rotating the tube containing beads used for preclearing at 4°C (in a cold room).\nNote: It is frequently observed that magnetic beads precipitate into the bottom of the tube after the rotation. Gently resuspend the beads-containing solution by pipetting.\nAdd PBS containing 0.5% BSA to the tube containing beads up to 250 μL and then add 2 μg of antibodies to mouse IgMμ per ChIP reaction to the tube containing the blocked magnetic beads.",
    "Note: Given that the optimal amounts of antibodies vary from lot to lot, it is recommended that ChIP be performed in advance with various amounts of antibody by using 9 DIV NPC culture in order to determine the optimal amount of antibody that yields a high signal-to-noise ratio [e.g., signal value for the HoxA1 locus (positive control) in NPCs at 9 DIV should be >10 times than that for the Gapdh locus (negative control)].\nIncubate the tube on a tube rotator for >2 h at 4°C (cold room).\nPlace the tube on the magnet to separate the beads from the solution and then remove the supernatant.\nWash the anti-IgMμ–conjugated beads five times with 500 μL of Cell lysis buffer.\nCritical: Washing of the beads at least five times at this stage is important to reduce nonspecific binding of chromatin.\nNote: When washing the beads, place the tube on the magnet to separate the beads from the solution and then remove the supernatant, add the washing buffer, and resuspend the beads by gentle rotation of the magnetic stand.\nResuspend the anti-IgMμ–conjugated beads in 250 μL of Cell lysis buffer.\nAdd 4 μg of antibodies to H2Aub per ChIP reaction to the beads.\nNote: This step is for binding of anti-H2Aub antibody to the anti-IgMμ–conjugated beads, and a volume of 250 μl is required for the solution to be stirred by the rotator.\nNote: It is recommended to determine the optimal amount of anti-H2Aub antibody that yields a high signal-to-noise ratio by using 9 DIV NPC culture, given that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation varies depending on the antibody lot [e.g., signal value for the HoxA1 locus (positive control) in NPCs at 9 DIV should be >10 times than that for the Gapdh locus (negative control)].",
    "Incubate the tube on a tube rotator overnight (10–16 h) at 4°C (cold room).\nDay 2\nPlace the tube on the magnet to separate the beads from the solution and then remove the supernatant.\nNote: Complete separation of the beads from the solution can be facilitated by swirling the beads gently until the solution becomes clear.\nNote: When removing the supernatant by aspiration, attach a 27G injection needle to the tip of the aspirator. This will reduce the suction force and the risk of aspirating the magnetic beads by accident.\nWash the beads three times with 500 μL of Cell lysis buffer.\nNote: When washing the beads, place the tube on the magnet to separate the beads from the solution and then remove the supernatant, add the washing buffer, and resuspend the beads by gentle rotation of the magnetic stand.\nResuspend the antibody–conjugated beads in 20 μL of Cell lysis buffer per ChIP reaction.\nNote: Given that the protein A beads tend to form pellets under the influence of gravity, pipette the bead suspension gently and thoroughly before transfer to tubes containing chromatin.\nLysis of the cell pellet and shearing of chromatin—Day 12\nTiming: 3–4 h\nNPCs are lysed to extract chromatin from the nucleus. Chromatin is then fragmented by ultrasonic treatment, which is necessary to increase the resolution of ChIP.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of swelling buffer per sample and incubate for 20 min on ice.\nCentrifuge the tube at 5,800 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the resulting supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 150 μL of Cell lysis buffer.",
    "Shear the chromatin with the use of a Hand Sonic UR-20P device (Tomy). The power setting should be “3” for 8 cycles of ON for 10 s and OFF for 20 s and then “4” for 2 cycles of ON for 10 s and OFF for 20 s.\nCritical: The sonication setting is essential for the appropriate shearing of chromatin. The power of sonication can vary depending on the equipment. After shearing of chromatin, it is recommended that its length be 200–1000 base pairs. It is also recommended to run the samples on an agarose gel electrophoresis and confirm that the size of chromatin is appropriate. If shearing is insufficient, increase the power setting step by step.\nNote: While sonicating the cell suspension, place the tube on ice in order to prevent an increase in temperature. Be careful not to cause bubbling of the suspension. If bubbling occurs, centrifuge the tube at 20,380 × g for 5 min at 4°C. This operation will remove bubbling that have been generated.\nCentrifuge the tube at 20,380 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Cell debris such as insoluble membranes should be removed by this step.\nTransfer all supernatant (~150 μL) to a new 1.7-mL prelubricated microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 100 μL of Cell lysis buffer and 20 μL of blocked Dynabeads for preclearing from step 43 to the tube containing the sheared chromatin. Incubate the mixture on a tube rotator for 1 h at 4°C (cold room). Subsequent nonspecific binding of protein to the magnetic beads is minimized by this preclearing step.",
    "Place the tube on the magnet to separate the beads from the solution and then transfer 100 μL of the supernatant to a new 1.7-mL prelubricated microcentrifuge tube for ChIP as well as 50 μL to another new tube for determination of input (the amount of chromatin DNA used for the immunoprecipitation). Store the latter tube at –20°C until reversal of cross-linking.\nAdd 150 μL of Cell lysis buffer to the tube containing the supernatant for ChIP reaction.\nImmunoprecipitation, washing, elution, and reversal of cross-linking—Days 12–14\nTiming: 2 days\nIn the following steps, H2Aub is specifically captured by antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads. Nonspecific binding of nonmodified histone and nonbound DNA are largely eliminated by washing of the beads with various buffers. Immunoprecipitated chromatin is then eluted from the magnetic beads, and histone-DNA cross-linking is reversed to release DNA fragments.\nDay 1\nAdd 20 μL of anti-H2Aub–conjugated magnetic beads per ChIP to the chromatin extract from step 62.\nIncubate the tube on a tube rotator overnight (10–16 h) at 4°C (cold room).\nDay 2\nPlace the tube on the magnet to separate the beads from the solution and then remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nNote: Complete separation of the beads from the solution can be facilitated by swirling the beads gently until the solution becomes clear.\nNote: When removing the supernatant by aspiration, attach a 27G injection needle to the tip of the aspirator. This will reduce the suction force and the risk of aspirating the magnetic beads by accident.\nWash the beads six times with 500 μL of Cell lysis buffer.\nWash the beads twice with 500 μL of Wash buffer A.\nWash the beads twice with 500 μL of Wash buffer B.\nWash the beads twice with 500 μL of TE buffer.",
    "Note: After the addition of each wash buffer, separate the beads on the magnetic stand, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the beads by agitation.\nResuspend the beads in 200 μL of Elution buffer and proceed to step 71. At the same time, thaw the tube containing the chromatin solution for determination of total input (from step 61), add 150 μL of Elution buffer and proceed to step 72.\nIncubate the former tube at 65°C for 15 min.\nNote: For efficient elution of chromatin from the magnetic beads, tap and agitate the tube gently every 2–3 min during the incubation.\nAdd 5 μL of proteinase K solution to a final enzyme concentration of 0.25 mg/mL.\nIncubate overnight (10–16 h) at 37°C.\nDay 3\nTransfer the tubes to a 65°C incubator for reversal of cross-linking and incubate for at least 6 h.\nPause point: The chromatin can be stored at –20°C for at least several days at this point.\nAdd 200 μL of phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol to each tube and shake vigorously.\nCentrifuge at 20,380 × g for 15 min at room temperature.\nCollect the resulting aqueous upper phase (~200 μL) and transfer it to a new 1.7-mL prelubricated microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 2.5 volumes of ethanol, 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, and 1 μL of glycogen (final glycogen concentration of 0.1 mg/mL) and apply the tube to a vortex mixer.\nIncubate at –20°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 20,380 × g for 15 min at room temperature.\nRemove the resulting supernatant and wash the DNA pellet with 300 μL of 80% (v/v) ethanol.\nAllow the DNA pellet to dry in air and then dissolve it in 50 μL of ddH2O.\nQuantification of binding by qPCR—Day 15\nTiming: 4 h",
    "The amount of H2Aub at target genes is quantified by qPCR. The relative binding frequency is estimated by calculating the percentage of total input that is recovered in the immunoprecipitate.\nNote: Neurogenic gene loci such as Neurog1, Fezf2, Lef1, and Tcfap2c and housekeeping gene loci such as Actb and Gapdh can be used as positive and negative controls, respectively, to verify the fidelity of the H2Aub ChIP assay. The binding ratio of the signals at target gene loci relative to those at negative genes loci can then be calculated. However, if the background is very low, it can be difficult to quantify. If there is a lot of variation in the background signal, the enrichment over background will also have a lot of variation. To confirm that neuronal differentiation potential is indeed restricted in NPC cultures at 9 DIV, the level of H2Aub at neurogenic gene loci should be examined.\nNote: This qPCR protocol was designed for a 16 μL reaction mixture in the 96-well format and for the use of THUNDERBIRD® SYBR® qPCR Mix (Toyobo) and a LightCycler 480 System II (Roche). The precise procedure will differ depending on the reagents and machine used, but the general design principles should be the same as described here.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_951_23.csv\nCritical: When designing primers for qPCR, ensure that the amplicons are not too large (optimal size of ~100 bp).\nPrepare a stock solution of both forward and reverse primers in ddH2O at a final concentration of 10 μM.\nCombine 4.4 μL of ddH2O, 8 μL of THUNDERBIRD® SYBR® qPCR Mix, and 1.6 μL of primer stock solution per reaction for 1.1 times the desired number of reactions as a premixture. Mix well by pipetting or tapping.",
    "Note: Assay samples at least in duplicate and ensure that there is no substantial difference between the duplicate values.\nNote: When performing qPCR, always generate a standard curve for the level of PCR amplification by the use of each primer pair on each plate with the use of purified genomic DNA of the input sample and with the same premixture as used for the immunoprecipitated samples. We only used the range of PCR amplification cycles for each primer pair that shows the level of amplification greater than 1.5 at each cycle.\nCool a 96-well plate on a plate cooler and add 14 μL of the premixture followed by 2 μL of the purified DNA to each well.\nNote: Keep the plate cold during preparation of the reaction mixture with the use of a plate cooler so as to avoid evaporation.\nNote: When adding DNA to the wells, be careful not to lose track of those to which it has been added. Use of a printed plate layout, on which the wells to which the DNA has been added can be checked off, is recommended.\nSeal the plate with a seal compatible with qPCR.\nNote: Before transferring the plate to the qPCR machine, wipe the surface of the seal to remove dirty spots such as hand grease. Given that the qPCR instrument measures fluorescence through the seal, any material on the seal that is in the light path can affect the fluorescence intensity.\nVortex the plate briefly and centrifuge at 100 × g for a few seconds at room temperature.\nPerform the qPCR reaction with an appropriate program (see examples below).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_951_24.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_951_25.csv\nNote: Given that the precise qPCR program will differ depending on the reagents used, check the protocol recommended by the product manufacturer.",
    "Note: A melting curve analysis at the end of the program is essential to confirm that only a single specific product was formed. If two or more peaks are obtained in the melting curve analysis, the reaction should be performed again or the qPCR primer set should be redesigned.\nCalculate the relative concentration of the target DNA for all reactions for each primer pair with the use of the corresponding standard curve (Roche software will do this automatically).\nNote: We recommend use of the second derivative max method for calculation of the Cp (Ct) value.\nExport the data to the “.txt” format and calculate the average of relative concentration of DNA for each sample from two or more replicates.\nQ, the average value of relative concentration of each sample; q, the value of relative concentration of input sample; q’, the value of relative concentration of immunoprecipitate with H2Aub antibody, n: the number of qPCR replicates\n   Q  t o t a l   =   (  q 1  +  q 2  + ⋯ +  q n  )  n  ,   Q  H 2 A u b   =   (    q ′   1  +    q ′   2  + ⋯ +    q ′   n  )  n   \nGiven that the total input sample was diluted, correct the relative concentration value of each reaction by multiplying by the dilution factor.\nI, corrected value of qPCR result of input sample; D, dilution factor (e.g., If the equal volume of ddH2O is added to the input sample, the dilution factor is calculated as “2”.)\n   I  t o t a l   =  Q  t o t a l   × D",
    "Note: If ChIP is performed with several antibodies in addition to anti-H2Aub antibody, the input sample will be used for qPCR reaction many times. In this case, it is recommended the input samples be diluted to 2–5 times with ddH2O.\nCalculate the percent of input by dividing the value for each immunoprecipitate by that for its corresponding input.\nr, The ratio of the volume of input samples to that of immunoprecipitated samples\n   [ %  o f  i n p u t ]  =   (  Q  H 2 A u b   ÷  r )   I  t o t a l    × 100  \nNote: QH2Aub must be divided by “r” when r-fold amount of the solution to input sample is used for immunoprecipitation of H2Aub antibody at step 61."
