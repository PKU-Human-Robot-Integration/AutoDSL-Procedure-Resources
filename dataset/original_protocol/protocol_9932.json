    "1. Generation of cysts\nNOTE: This protocol can be performed with any type of hydrogel, if the gelation allows embedding of cells.\nHydrogel coating\n\tNOTE: Proper hydrogel coating of the chamber slide is a critical step to avoid the formation of 2D cell layers on the bottom of the well, that might interfere with subsequent cyst imaging and impair the calculation of cyst formation efficiency.\n\t\nTo ensure homogeneity of the gel solution, thaw the hydrogel at 4 °C overnight (O/N).\nPrecool pipette tips on ice or O/N at -20 °C and an 8-well chamber slide at -20 °C O/N.\nPlace the hydrogel and the 8-well chamber slide on an ice bucket filled with ice.\nIn a 15 mL conical tube, prepare a solution containing 40% hydrogel (V/V) in cold NRC complete medium (see Table of Materials) and place the tube on ice.\nTo coat a chamber slide, using cold pipette tips, add 50 μL of hydrogel solution on the center of each well, and spread over the whole surface using a pipette tip, while holding the chamber slide on ice (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Spread the hydrogel solution as evenly as possible avoiding bubbles.\nTo polymerize the hydrogel, incubate the chamber slide for at least 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nCell preparation\n\t\nWarm up NRC complete medium, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and trypsin-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (trypsin-EDTA) in a water bath pre-heated to 37 °C.\nWhile the hydrogel is polymerizing, ensure that NRCs are grown to 70% confluency in a T-25 cm2 collagen-coated flask21. Wash the cells once with pre-heated 1x PBS.  \nIncubate the NRCs with 5 mL of pre-heated 1x PBS (for a T-25 cm2 flask) for 20 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: This step, which shortens the incubation time with trypsin-EDTA is instrumental in retaining the self-organizing properties of cells.\nDiscard the PBS, add 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA, and incubate for 5-10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nNeutralize with 4 mL of pre-heated complete NRC medium. Collect and transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube, and spin at 150 x g for 4 min.\nDiscard the medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of pre-heated medium.\nUsing a 40 μm cell strainer, filter the cell solution into a 50 mL conical tube and count the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Passing the cells through a strainer is a critical step for the quantitative results to be reproducible i.e., to get almost similar size of cell aggregates to be embedded.\nEmbedding of cell suspension in hydrogel solution\n\t\nPrepare a solution of 1,600 µL of 80% hydrogel (V/V) in cold complete NRC medium (tube 1); keep in ice. Dilute 5 x 105 cells/mL in 1,600 µL of cold complete NRC medium (tube 2) and keep in ice.\n\t\tNOTE: This step must be performed quickly to avoid polymerization of the hydrogel while mixing it with the cell suspension and to maintain cell viability.\nTo prepare a cell seeding solution of 2.5 x 105 cells/mL in 40% hydrogel (V/V), mix tube 1 and tube 2. Add 400 μL of the cell solution into each well of the hydrogel-coated chamber slide avoiding bubbles (Figure 1B).\nKeep the chamber slide in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until media change.\nAfter 2 days in culture, remove 250 μL of the medium from a corner of each well, be careful to not pipette out the hydrogel. Then, slowly add 250 μL of the culture medium. Change the medium every 2 days.",
    "NOTE: Minimize the movement of the chamber slide, particularly during the cyst initiation.\n2. Cyst quantification\nCyst imaging\n\tNOTE: This section should be performed quickly to not compromise the cell viability if the microscope is not equipped with a heating chamber to control CO2 and temperature. In order to ensure consistent quantification, representative of the cyst distribution in the full hydrogel volume, cysts are imaged via phase-contrast microscopy and serial imaging (Z-stacks), with pre-defined parameters throughout different time points.\n\t\nTake a Z-stack along the depth of the hydrogel for each time point (Figure 1C, D). In this example, Z-stacks are taken at days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10.\n\t\tNOTE: Check that the initial cell distribution is uniform in the hydrogel to ensure the applicability of this method.\n\t\t\nWith a phase-contrast microscope equipped with an image acquisition software, select the 10x objective magnification in the manual nose-piece pad window (Figure 2B(1)).\nSwitch on the white lamp and select the brightfield imaging option.\nSwitch the camera on by selecting the “Play” button in the bar submenu. Focus on a field of cysts and set the exposure time (Figure 2B(2)). Open the Auto Capture Folder window for an automatic saving of images (Figure 2B(3)).\nOpen the capture Z-series window and define with the Z screw the top and bottom planes of the Z-stack (same XY coordinates but different Z screened). Adjust the Z-step depending on the objective, the level of resolution and press the button “Run now” to launch the acquisition (Figure 2B(4)).",
    "NOTE: In this example, cysts are spread over a hydrogel thickness of 520 µm. 26 images are acquired along the hydrogel depth with a 20 µm Z-step interval. Depending on the objective, the Z-step should be adjusted to not miss any cyst and to ensure the detection of single cells and aggregates.\nTake at least 3 non-overlapping Z-stacks per well.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This sampling is necessary when, like in this example, cysts are more numerous in the depth of the gel than on the edges due to heterogeneities in the hydrogel polymerization.\nIn order to have a representative dataset repeat step 2.1.1.5. for 3 wells in total.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The heterogeneous distribution of cysts depends on the type of hydrogel, its polymerization, and the cell line. Considering three Z-stacks per well and three wells per experiment, a minimum of 200 cysts are imaged over nine Z-stacks to characterize cyst formation and cyst growth at each time point.\nImage processing\n\tNOTE: In a hydrogel, NRCs can be found as single cells, cysts or aggregates. Cysts are identified by the presence of a round and thin contrasted cell shell enclosing a lumen, while cell aggregates present an irregular shape and do not have a lumen. Aggregates and single cells have a dense and contrasted appearance (Figure 3B(4)).\n\t\nOpen the Fiji software, open the Z-stack and go to the Fiji menu and click File | Open (Supplementary Figure 1). Select the Z-stack to analyze. If needed, select “Virtual Stack” option and click “Yes” for opening (Figure 3A(1)).\nDuplicate the stack via Image | Duplicate. Click on the box “Duplicate stack” and click “OK” (Supplementary Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: In this example, Z-stacks are in .nd2 file format encoded in 16 bits.",
    "Create a minimum intensity projection from the duplicated stack. Go to the Image menu | Stacks | Z Project. Select Projection type “Min Intensity” and click “OK” (Figure 3A(2)) (Supplementary Figure 3).\nSubtract the background from the projection. Go to the Process menu | Subtract Background. Type 500.0 pixels of rolling ball radius and click “light background” to render cysts more contrasted than the background (Figure 3A(3)) (Supplementary Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The rolling ball radius defines the size of the region on which background subtraction is operated. This parameter must be set to the size of the largest object to identify.\nIf contrast enhancement is needed, go to Image menu | Adjust | Brightness/Contrast | Auto | Apply. Fiji will automatically optimize brightness and contrast. In (Figure 3A(3)), the lower and upper gray values were set to 49702 and 65452, respectively (Supplementary Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: If the projection is not calibrated, go to the Analyze menu | Set scale and type the corresponding calibration µm/pixel ratio (Supplementary Figure 6).\nCyst counting and cyst size measurements\n\t\nTo measure the approximate cyst diameter, select the Straight-line tool in the Fiji menu and draw a line across the diameter of each cyst on the final projection (Figure 3B(4)). Add the new region of interest (ROI) created for each cyst to the ROI manager: press the “t” shortcut on the keyboard for faster counting and opening of the ROI manager. Click “Show All” to see the counted cysts (Supplementary Figure 7)",
    "Check that no cyst has been left without counting by superimposing the set ROIs from the projection on the Z-stack. To do so, click on the Z-stack window to select it. In the ROI Manager, click “Show All” and move the cursor along the Z-stack to check that image per image, all cysts have been counted (Supplementary Figure 8).\nOnce new cysts have been counted and ROIs added on step 2.3.1., select the ROI set and save it via the ROI Manager window by clicking More | Save (Supplementary Figure 9).\nSelect all ROIs in the ROI Manager and click “Measure” in the ROI Manager to get the size of each cyst. This will open a new window of measurements named “Results” numbering each cyst and its estimated size. Then save in .csv format by clicking on the “Results” window and via the menu: File | Save As (Supplementary Figure 10).\n\t\tNOTE: A macro can be created to semi-automatically process stacks, estimate cyst number/sizes from the projections, and store the data for faster counting procedure. To do so, select the tool “Record” in the bar menu, by clicking Plugins | Macros | Record.\nQuantification of cyst formation efficiency\n\t\nCount the number of cysts at day Y, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61404/61404eq1.jpg on a projection (Y=1, 2, 4, 7 or 10).\nTo calculate the cyst formation efficiency for 1000 cells at day Y, divide the number of cysts counted at that time point by the number of cells seeded at day 0 inferred from the hydrogel volume and multiply by 1000 (Figure 3C, Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61404/61404eq2.jpg\n3. Cell viability\nPrepare a stock solution of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) at 5 mg/mL by dissolving 5 mg of FDA in 1 mL acetone and store at -20 °C.",
    "Prepare a stock solution of propidium iodide (PI) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in deionized water (dH2O) and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare NRC medium without fetal calf serum (FCS).\nTo prepare the FDA/PI staining solution, add 4 μL of FDA stock solution (8 µg/mL final concentration) and 25 μL of PI stock solution (20 µg/mL final concentration) into 2.5 mL of NRC medium without FCS.\nRemove the medium from the chamber slide, add 250 μL of staining solution into each well and incubate 4-5 min in the dark at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Pipette out the staining solution carefully and wash once with 250 μL of 1x PBS.\nCarefully add 250 μL of complete NRC medium to each well and take pictures using an inverted fluorescence microscope with Texas red and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filters. Live cells will be green and dead cells will be red (Figure 5A).\n\tNOTE: In order to quantify live/dead cells, take Z-stacks across the hydrogel volume following step 2 and adapt the image processing method for fluorescence.\n4. Secretion activity\nNOTE: The secretion activity through the apical membrane of the cholangiocytes is assessed by the secretion of fluorescein in the lumen. Its specificity can be evaluated by doing the same test with Verapamil, a multi-drug resistant (MDR) transporter inhibitor24.\nTo prepare a staining solution of Hoechst 33258 at 5 µg/mL, add 0.83 μL of Hoechst stock solution (15 mg/mL stock concentration in dH2O) in 2.5 mL of NRC medium without FCS.\nAdd 250 μL of Hoechst solution in each well and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 15 min.\nRemove the Hoechst solution and add 250 µL of FDA solution (8 µg/mL final concentration) in each well. Incubate 4-5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: As soon as cells are exposed to FDA staining solution, the follow up of fluorescein secretion kinetics might be useful to calibrate the time needed for cysts to secrete. To do so, take pictures every min for 1 h via time-lapse imaging. In this example, the time needed to observe NRC secreting cysts in the hydrogel is about 15-20 min.\nTake images using an inverted fluorescence microscope 5 min after rinsing with medium without FCS. Use 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and FITC filters to reveal nuclei labeling and fluorescein accumulation in the lumen (Figure 6A). To quantify the number of secreting cysts, take Z-stacks as in step 2 and adapt the image processing steps to fluorescent images.\n\tNOTE: For the Verapamil test, precede the previous process (steps 4.3. to 4.4.) by an incubation with Verapamil, according to the following conditions:\nPrepare a stock solution of 10 mM Verapamil in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To prepare 10 µM working solution, mix 2.5 μL of Verapamil stock solution with 2.5 mL culture medium without FCS.\nTo assess that the fluorescence in the lumen results from MDR secretion, take another slide and add 250 µL of Verapamil working solution in each well and incubate 20 min at 37° C, 5% CO2 \nRemove the solution and add 250 µL of FDA solution (8 µg/mL final concentration) into each well. Incubate 4-5 min in the dark at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Then, wash with 250 μL of 1x PBS, before imaging (Figure 6B, C).\n5. Epithelial polarity assessment by immunofluorescence\nTo prepare the fixing solution, mix 4% formaldehyde with 5% sucrose, in 1x PBS, pH 7.4 and incubate in a water bath pre-heated at 37 °C.",
    "To fix the cells, gently pipette out the culture medium from the well without damaging the matrix. Slowly add 400 µL of the fixing solution to the side of the wells. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature (RT).\n\tNOTE: Always leave 25 µL of the liquid above the matrix to prevent its damage.\nGently remove the fixing solution and wash 3x with 400 μL of 1x PBS at (RT).\nPipette out the PBS, add 400 µL of permeabilization solution (0.5% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS) and incubate 10 min at RT.\nGently remove the permeabilization solution, followed by 3 quick washes with 400 μL of 1x PBS and a long washing step of 30 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: At this step, the slide can be stored at 4 °C for 2 days. In this case, seal the slide with a paraffin film to prevent evaporation and matrix drying.\nRemove the PBS, add 400 µL of blocking solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% goat serum in 1x PBS and incubate for 60 min at RT.\n\tCAUTION: Concentrations of BSA higher than 0.1% will result in lumen retraction and further cyst collapse (see Representative Results section) (Figure 7A).\nPipette out the blocking solution and wash once with 400 µL of PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and discard.\nAdd 150 µL of the antibody solution, e.g., E-cadherin antibody diluted 1:400 and Phalloidin 568 (16.2 nM final concentration) in 1x PBS and incubate for 90 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: This dilution of E-cadherin is the same used as in a standard 2D immunofluorescence protocol.\nWash the sample with 400 µL of PBS/0.05% Tween 20, 3x; each time incubating the sample for 10 min at RT.",
    "Add 150 µL of the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor Plus 647), diluted 1:500 in 1x PBS and incubate 60 min at RT.\nWash 3x with 400 µL of PBS/0.05% Tween 20, each time incubating the sample for 10 min at RT.\nWash 3x with 400 µL of 1x PBS, each time incubating the sample for 10 min at RT.\nDiscard the PBS of the last wash and prepare the chamber slide for visualization via confocal microscopy following one of the two options below.\n\t\nAdd 400 μL of 1x PBS and 50 μL of DAPI per well. The samples can be examined through the bottom of the well without the need of mounting with a coverslip (Figure 7B).\nAdd 100 µL per well of antifade reagent containing DAPI and let the slide drying O/N at RT.\nSubscription Required.
