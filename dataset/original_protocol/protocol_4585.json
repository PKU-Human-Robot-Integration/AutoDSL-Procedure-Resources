    "Plant growthSterilize Arabidopsis seeds in 30% (v/v) household bleach (final concentration ~1.5% w/v sodium hypochlorite) and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 15 min and wash three times with sterile water.Stratify the seeds in sterile 0.15% (w/v) agar at 4 °C for at least three days in the dark and sow on 0.5x MS, 0.8% agar, 1% sucrose plates.After two hours of light exposure at room temperature, wrap the plates in aluminum foil and grow the seedlings vertically in the dark for 3 days at 22 °C.Sample preparation (Figure 1)Apply a thin layer of vacuum grease (in syringe) at four corners near the edges of a 25 x 75 x 1 mm slide (Figure 1A) to create a mounting chamber. The vacuum grease cushion stabilizes the seedling for sustained time-lapse imaging, minimizing compression and mechanical damage. Transfer an Arabidopsis etiolated seedling into the slide with 135 μl of water or liquid 0.5x MS media (Figure 1B) and mount with a #1.5 24 x 30 mm cover glass (Figure 1C). Manipulate the seedling as quickly as possible, or use a safer light such as green or red light, to minimize exposure to light.Confocal imagingObserve the seedling under a confocal microscope featuring a spinning disk head mounted on a motorized inverted microscope with a 100x/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Use 488 nm or 561 nm excitation wavelength for the fluorescent markers GFP/YFP and tdTomato respectively; and band pass filters (525/50 nm for GFP, 535/50 for YFP, and 620/60 for tdTomato) for emission filtering. Perform imaging with 500-ms exposure times. Obtain CESA particle images from epidermal cells in the upper etiolated hypocotyl (Figure 2A) at the plasma membrane focal plane (Figure 2B), where cellulose synthesis takes place.",
    "The larger particles in the adjacent focal planes correspond to CESA particles in Golgi and cytoplasmic compartments (Figure 2C).Run a time-lapse imaging experiment with a time interval of 5 sec and duration of 5 min. During this time, vertical stage drift may occur, resulting in a shift from the plasma membrane focal plane. Make sure that images are acquired at the correct focal plane over time. This can be accomplished using a “live” preview mode every four or five frames to adjust the focus. Since this can increase photo bleaching of the sample, adjustments should be made only when necessary. To check that there is no horizontal stage drift in the time series, an average intensity projection can be created in ImageJ. Open the TIFF image stack in ImageJ and select the “Image → Stacks → Z project...” command. Select the “Average Intensity” option and click OK. In the newly generated time average image, CESA particles in the plasma membrane should appear as linear tracks. Background Golgi signal will appear as wide diffuse tracks and larger bright spots (Figure 3A).  Occasionally, a horizontal drift may occur due to movement of the seedling or movement of the confocal stage. This can be detected by applying Z project on the movie, as the tracks will smear (Figure 3B demonstrates a Z stack of such event). We prefer not to analyze this type of movies, although in mild cases, the StackReg ImageJ plugin can be used.Image processingOpen the time-lapse series TIFF stack in ImageJ.As the images of the time-lapse series tend to be noisy and can vary in brightness depending on drift in the focal plane during acquisition, two filters can be applied in order to improve downstream analyses. The results of these operations are shown in Figure 4.",
    "First, select “Process → Enhance Contrast…” and set to “0.4%” saturated pixels. This saturation works well for our imaging. Select the option for “Process all X slices” and leave the remaining options unselected (Figure 4B).Noise can be greatly reduced by applying a walking average filter. Select “Plugins → Walking Average.” Enter “4” as the number of frames to average. Note that the resulting stack will contain 3 fewer frames than the initial stack (Figure 4C).Save the resulting stack and analyze particle velocity either by Kymograph in ImageJ or particle analysis in Imaris.Kymograph analysis in ImageJStarting with the file generated by step D of “Image Processing,” create an average intensity projection as mentioned before. Use the straight line selection tool to trace a line that follows a CSC track in the time average image (Figure 5A).Switch back to the original time-lapse stack and select “Edit → Selection → Restore Selection.” The line drawn in step E2 should now be transferred to the time-lapse stack. (Figure 5B).Select “Plugins → MultipleKymograph.” Set the line width to “3”. This setting was shown to give the best result.A kymograph is generated depicting displacement along the defined path in the X dimension and time in the Y dimension (Figure 5C). Particles moving at a constant velocity thus appear as diagonal lines and their slope can be used to calculate the velocity of each particle in the kymograph.To easily determine the slope of a line, select “Analyze → Set Measurements…” and make sure that “Bounding Rectangle” is selected.On the kymograph, use the straight line tool to trace one of the diagonal lines corresponding to an individual CESA particle (Figure 5C).Press “M” to measure this line and the Results window will appear.",
    "Width and Height of the bounding box are the number of pixels corresponding to the displacement and time, respectively, that the particle has traveled.Calculating the velocity of each particle is straightforward, as each pixel in the Y dimension corresponds to the number of seconds between exposures in the time lapse, and each pixel in the X dimension has the same dimensions as the X and Y axes in the original image (This will vary depending on microscope and objective). For the path outlined in Figure 5C, where a frame was taken every 5 sec and each pixel in the original image corresponds to 135 nm:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150928/20150928065031_3278.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151006/20151006010940_4652.jpg  Imaris analysis of CSC velocity Imaris has a range of powerful tools for analyzing particle movement. A simple procedure for extracting plasma membrane CSC velocities while ignoring Golgi and other trafficking compartments is outlined here. These instructions are for Imaris 7.2 and may differ with later versions of the software.Ensure that the stack is saved as an 8 bit TIFF image after initial processing in ImageJ.Open the TIFF stack in Imaris “File → Open…”.Select “Image Processing → Swap Time and Z”.Select “Edit → Image Properties.” Set the voxel dimensions according to your microscope and objective. For example, with the microscope’s 100x objective used in this work, one pixel is 135 nm, so voxel size is 135 for X, 135 for Y and Z can be left as 1. Change the units to “nm.”In the same window, under the Time Point section, click “All Equidistant…” and enter the time interval used during acquisition. If the instructions at step C4 were followed, this is set to 5 sec. Click “OK.”Select “Surpass → Spots.” In the Spots tab, make sure that “Track Spots (over time)” is selected.",
    "In this example, the whole image will be processed, but a region of interest can be analyzed by selecting “Segment only a Region of Interest” and further deselecting “Process entire Image Finally”.Click the blue next arrow.Enter an estimated diameter for the spot detection. For this example, in our lab, 250 nm works well. You can measure several particles in Slice view to estimate particle size. Select “Background Subtraction.” Press the next button.Spots will be detected and will be marked with small squares as shown in Figure 6A. Quality thresholds can be adjusted at this point, but it is not critical to make sure that every spot is tracking a CESA particle. False positive spots can be filtered out by additional criteria later. Generally, adjust the threshold so that many spots are detected within cells, but few spots are detected in background regions. Click the next button.Click the next button, as there are no changes to be made on the Edit Spots screen.Select “Connected Components” and click next. This may take a couple of minutes.On the Classify Tracks screen, apply a filter of Track Duration above 60 sec. This will eliminate most of the fast moving trafficking compartments that are not associated with the plasma membrane. The remaining tracks are highlighted by color coded lines (Figure 6B).Click the green “finish” button.Click on the statistics tab, and then on the Detailed tab. Click the icon with multiple disks to export all statistics as a Microsoft Excel document.To calculate the velocity of the tracks, we take the Track Displacement Length and divide it by the Track Duration. The track speed that is calculated by Imaris is less accurate since at each time point the center of each particle is not determined reliably.",
    "Typically, 1,000 or more spots can be analyzed in a single movie."
