    "The following protocol adheres to the guidelines of our institution's human research ethics committee. Methods from this protocol have been included within ethics committee-approved research studies in our institution17,18.\n1. Coronary angiography\nBefore starting, have the catheter laboratory team undertake a 'huddle' to review the clinical case and plan the procedure. This includes preparation for medication and/or equipment should adverse events occur (for instance the need for pacing).\nConsider adopting the following checklist: written informed consent, including the off-label use of acetylcholine, indication and potential risks of the procedure, history of allergy, and plan for procedural thromboprophylaxis, sedation and/or pain-control.\nObtain arterial access using standard Seldinger technique. Radial artery access is recommended as per contemporary guidelines.\nAdminister intra-arterial nitrate to reduce propensity to radial artery spasm. Modest doses of short-acting nitrate (e.g., 200 µg of GTN) are recommended. Avoid calcium channel antagonists.\nGive unfractionated heparin 5000 IU and actively manage the activated clotting time (ACT) to ~250 seconds.\nPerform standard coronary angiography to obtain orthogonal views of all main coronary artery branches.\nRecord left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), if feasible, to provide information on possible alternative explanations for symptoms (e.g., heart failure).\nSize the guide catheter selection according to the patient stature, e.g., 6 Fr and 3.5 size for the standard patient, or 5Fr and 3.0 size for those of smaller stature.\n\t​NOTE: Careful attention to the aortic pressure waveform will inform the operator about 'pressure damping' and the risk of coronary dissection. An 'Extra Back-Up' catheter may secure a more stable position in the left main coronary artery, but care is needed during manipulation to avoid vessel injury.\n2. Diagnostic guidewire test (FFR, CFR, IMR, RRR)\nEngage the coronary artery with a guide catheter of choice.",
    "With the guide catheter engaged and co-axial, administer 200 µg of GTN to attenuate any epicardial coronary spasm.\nEnsure that the ACT is ~250 seconds before instrumentation of the coronary artery.\nWhile avoiding handling the diagnostic guidewire sensor, advance the sensor to the tip of the guide catheter.\nFlush the guide catheter to avoid contrast pressure damping. Allow 30 seconds for resting conditions to return before 'equalizing' pressure with the invasive aortic root pressure. Ensure that the catheter system is fully closed (e.g., introducer needle fully removed) and 'pressure damping' is not present. Meticulous setup reduces the risk of subsequent errors from 'signal drift'.\nAdvance the diagnostic guidewire to the distal 1/3 of the coronary artery. In the absence of a clinical indication to select a specific coronary artery, select the left anterior descending (LAD) artery as the default due to the volume of myocardium subtended.\nIf encountering difficulty advancing the diagnostic guidewire, consider use of a standard workhorse coronary guidewire as a 'buddy-wire'. Alternatively, a different coronary artery may be selected if vascular injury remains a concern.\nWith the diagnostic guidewire in appropriate position within the vessel, flush the guide catheter with room-temperature normal saline and allow 30 seconds for resting physiology to return.\nStore a fluoroscopy image of the diagnostic guidewire to document position within the coronary artery.\nRecord resting pressure indices, including resting Pd/Pa and RFR.\nBefore recording resting thermodilution transit times, flush the guide catheter with room temperature saline to displace saline within the catheter that has been warmed by the patient's body temperature.\nUsing a dedicated 3 mL syringe (or 5 mL syringe in large left dominant coronary arteries), administer brisk 3 mL boluses of room-temperature normal saline via the guide catheter.",
    "CAUTION: Care should be taken to avoid injection of air into the coronary artery. Ensure guide catheter is co-axially intubated during injections to avoid hydro trauma.\nRepeat the 3 mL boluses of room-temperature normal saline as required. Inspect the recorded transit times and replace any artefactual and/or outlier readings.\nSet up the linked diagnostic software to prepare for hyperemic measurements.\n\tNOTE: For the coronary pressure/flow relationship to become linear, resistance should be minimized and stable. This can be achieved with IV adenosine (140-210 µg/kg/min). Contrast-FFR (ischemic threshold 0.83) is an alternative to FFR with IV adenosine but does not provide the stable hyperemic conditions necessary for thermodilution measurement.\nInform the patient of potential adenosine side-effects (transient dyspnea, flushing and chest discomfort).\nCommence IV adenosine (140 µg/kg/min) infusion via a large peripheral venous cannula.\nKeep manifold manipulation to a minimum to avoid movement-induced pressure trace artefacts.\nMonitor for signs of hyperemia: 'ventriculization' and disappearance of the dicrotic notch in the distal pressure waveform, separation of the aortic and distal pressure waveforms, and symptoms (chest discomfort, dyspnea). Changes in heart rate and blood pressure are less reliable indicators of hyperemia.\nIf the initial adenosine infusion fails to achieve steady-state hyperemia, consider increasing the rate to 210 µg/kg/min.\nDocument FFR at stable hyperemia. An FFR reading of ≤0.80 is taken as significant for flow-limiting epicardial disease.\nWith the adenosine infusion still running, switch the linked diagnostic software to complete the hyperemic thermodilution measurements.\nRepeat rapid 3 mL boluses of room-temperature normal saline via the guide catheter to record hyperemic thermodilution transit times.\nPerform the same data quality assurance checks as for the resting readings. Replace any artefactual or outlier data.\nStop the IV adenosine infusion. The total duration of adenosine infusion will be approximately 2-3 minutes.",
    "Review data recordings to ensure the software-selected readings are free from artefact. Manual fine-tuning may be required. CFR <2.0 ('grey zone' 2.0-2.5), IMR ≥25 and RRR <2.0 are indicative of coronary microvascular dysfunction.\n3. Pharmacological reactivity test\nKeep the pre-prepared acetylcholine from pharmacy at 4 °C in the catheterization laboratory until use. Product shelf life is 30 hours from manufacture. The expiry date/time should be detailed on the label. Acetylcholine will be prepared at three doses:\n\tSolution 1 Acetylcholine Chloride 0.182 µg/mL (10-6M)\n\tSolution 2 Acetylcholine Chloride 1.82 µg /mL (10-5M)\n\tSolution 3 Acetylcholine Chloride 18.2 µg /mL (10-4M)\nChoose an angiographic projection that allows visualization of the coronary artery with minimal foreshortening and overlap. Acquire a resting angiogram.\nCheck that the guide catheter is still co-axially intubated for the acetylcholine infusion.\n\tNOTE: If choosing to infuse using a dedicated intracoronary microcatheter, position at this stage with the aid of a coronary guidewire. We advocate direct infusion via the guide catheter to minimize coronary instrumentation and procedural cost.\nConnect a long, sterile IV line to a 3-way tap and flush the system with normal saline. Connect the sterile IV line to the acetylcholine syringe which will be administered using an automated infusion pump.\n\tCAUTION: Acetylcholine can temporarily interrupt cardiac conduction. Keep atropine 1 mg and alternative means of pacing available. This is more relevant for dominant coronary arteries. Coughing is effective for heart rate recovery. Inform the patient that this may be needed.\nConnect Solution 1 (60 mL syringe; 10-6M).\n\t\nPurge the IV line and guide catheter with 4 mL of acetylcholine solution to minimize any 'dead space' effect when the infusion is commenced.\nWith the guide catheter still co-axial, commence the infusion at 2 mL/min for 2 minutes.",
    "Have the cardiac catheterization laboratory physiologist start the digital stopwatch on the monitor to ensure accurate time keeping.\nMonitor the patient, vital signs and ECG for effects of acetylcholine. If encountering any safety concerns, stop the acetylcholine infusion immediately.\nAfter the 2 minute infusion is complete, acquire an ECG and assess the patient for symptoms.\nGently purge the guide catheter system with contrast to avoid a sudden bolus of acetylcholine with next contrast injection.\nRepeat the coronary angiogram in the same projection as at rest. This should be sufficiently long to assess myocardial blush and TIMI frame counts, i.e., >3 heart beats.\nConnect Solution 2 (60 mL syringe; 10-5 M).\n\t\nPurge the IV line and guide catheter with 4 mL of acetylcholine solution to minimize any 'dead space' effect when the infusion is commenced.\nWith the guide catheter still co-axial, commence the infusion at 2 mL/min for 2 minutes.\nHave the cardiac catheterization laboratory physiologist start the digital stopwatch on the monitor to ensure accurate time keeping.\nMonitor the patient, vital signs and ECG for effects of acetylcholine. If encountering any safety concerns, stop the acetylcholine infusion immediately.\nAfter the 2 minute infusion is complete, acquire an ECG and assess the patient for symptoms.\nGently purge the guide catheter system with contrast to avoid a sudden bolus of acetylcholine with next contrast injection.\nRepeat the coronary angiogram in the same projection as at rest. This should be sufficiently long to assess myocardial blush and TIMI frame counts, i.e., >3 heart beats.\nConnect Solution 3 (60 mL syringe; 10-4M).\n\t\nPurge the IV line and guide catheter with 4 mL of acetylcholine solution to minimize any 'dead space' effect when the infusion is commenced.\nWith the guide catheter still co-axial, commence the infusion at 2 mL/min for 2 minutes.",

This should be sufficiently long to assess myocardial blush and TIMI frame counts, i.e., >3 heart beats.\nManual administration (bolus) of acetylcholine. The dose is usually 100 µg (5.5 mL of Solution 3) into a left coronary artery. This should be halved if infusing into a dominant coronary artery.\n\t\nWith the guide catheter still co-axial, commence manual infusion of the desired dose over 20 seconds.\nHave the cardiac catheterization laboratory physiologist start the digital stopwatch on the monitor to ensure accurate time keeping.\nMonitor the patient, vital signs and ECG for effects of acetylcholine.

This should be sufficiently long to assess myocardial blush and TIMI frame counts, i.e., >3 heart beats.",
    "Finally, perform a 'pullback' of the diagnostic guidewire and ensure 'signal drift' ≤0.03. Consider a final angiogram to exclude distal guidewire injury.\n4. Multivessel assessment\nCoronary function may vary between different coronary territories. The variation reflects differences in heart muscle mass subtended by individual coronary arteries, as well as disease (e.g., fibrosis). Therefore, while the IDP is usually performed in a single coronary artery, repeat testing or investigation of additional coronary arteries may be undertaken as felt to be clinically appropriate. A typical scenario would be when the initial test results are normal despite a strong clinical history; hence, assessing a second artery would be intended to avoid a false negative result. Similarly, vasospasm may vary between coronary arteries, so multi-vessel pharmacological testing may be considered if a high index of suspicion persists despite an initial negative response."
