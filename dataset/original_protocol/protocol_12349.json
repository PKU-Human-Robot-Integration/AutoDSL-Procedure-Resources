    "All experiments described herein were approved by the local Board for Animal Experiments from the Radboud University Nijmegen in accordance with Dutch laws and regulations (RU-DEC 2013-205).\n1. Extracellular Matrix Gel Spots\nPerform the following steps one day before the isolation:\n\t\nThaw an aliquot extracellular matrix gel (100 µl) at 4 °C for at least 1.5 hr. Dilute 1:10 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; with 4,500 mg/L glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, and 110 mg/ml sodium pyruvate (DMEM). Keep the extracellular matrix gel at 4 °C at all times. Note: Abrupt temperature changes will result in uneven coating and crystal formation.\nKeep the diluted extracellular matrix gel solution on ice for 15 min.\nPre-chill a 20 µl micropipette for 10 min.\nPut 8-well chamber slides into a 100 mm Petri dish and transfer the dish onto a cold surface (e.g. a freezer pack) for 10 min.\nUse the pre-chilled micropipette to put a drop of 10 µl extracellular matrix gel in each well. Keep the Petri dish on the cold surface for at least another 7 min (Figure 1A).\nCompletely remove the remaining extracellular matrix gel (Figure 1B), and dry the wells at 37 °C overnight.\n2. Dissection of Head Muscles (Masseter, Digastric, and Levator Veli Palatini)\nBefore dissection, prepare 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2% Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S). Keep on ice.\nAfter euthanasia of one young adult rat (9 weeks) with CO2/O2, decapitate the head and remove the skin from the head. Transfer the head to ice-cold PBS supplemented with 2% P/S in a 50 ml tube.\nMasseter muscle (derived from the 1st branchial arch)\n\t\nPlace the head with one side up on a silicone pad and fix with hypodermic needles (Figure 2A).",
    "Identify the parotid gland and the facial nerve (Figure 2A). Expose the deep fascia covering the gland. Cut the fascia and remove the gland using dissection scissors. Identify the external auditory canal. Trace the facial nerve from the stylomastoid foramen and carefully remove the temporal, zygomatic, and buccal branches with a scalpel blade No. 15.\nFree the superficial head of the masseter muscle by removing the fascia. Identify both superficial and deep heads of the masseter muscle. Trace the superficial head until its thick tendinous aponeurosis inserted in the zygomatic process of the maxilla.\nSeparate the tendon from its origin at the zygomatic process with a straight forceps. Cut it with a scalpel blade No. 15 or dissection scissors and carefully life it (Figure 2B).\nDissect the superficial head of the masseter until its insertion at the angle and inferior half of the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible with a scalpel blade No. 15 (Figure 2C). Now, completely remove the muscle.\nPosterior belly of the digastric muscle (derived from the 2nd branchial arch)\n\t\nPlace the head in a supine position on the silicone pad and fix with hypodermic needles (Figure 3A).\nRemove the subcutaneous fat overlying both sublingual and submandibular glands. Next, remove the superficial fascia and glands using dissection scissors. Expose the digastric muscle (anterior and posterior belly).\nHold the anterior tendon of the posterior belly with a straight forceps, cut it, and dissect it carefully until its origin in the tympanic bulla (Figure 3B). Do the same at the contralateral side.\nLevator veli palatini muscle (derived from the 4th branchial arch)\n\t\nAfter dissection of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, localize the stylohyoid muscle, pull it laterally, and carefully remove it (Figure 4A).",
    "Localize the tendon of the levator veli palatini that inserts at the tympanic bulla (Figure 4A). Dissect it carefully and cut it on both sides.\nLook for the trachea and the esophagus that runs behind it. Lift the esophagus, and expose the pharynx and the larynx.\nLocalize and dissect the area of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Identify the levator veli palatini and cut it at both sides (Figure 4B).\nNote: Directly after dissection, carefully remove tendon and connective tissue from each muscle under the stereo microscope. Submerge all specimens quickly in ethanol 70%, and transfer them to ice-cold PBS supplemented 2% P/S in a 15 ml tube.\n3. Isolation of Satellite Cells\nPerform the following preparation steps for SC isolation from 3 groups of muscles:\n\t\nPrepare 7.5 ml of 0.1% pronase in DMEM. Filter the solution through a 0.22 µm filter. Pre-warm the solution at 37 °C in a water bath for 10 min before isolation.\nPrepare 35 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% Horse Serum (HS) and 1% P/S. Also pre-warm at 37 °C in a water bath.\nPrepare 15 ml culture medium which consists of DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% HS, 1% P/S and 1% chicken embryo extract (CEE). Pre-warm at 37 °C in a water bath.\nPre-coat six plastic pipettes (10 ml) with HS and dry for at least 10 min before use.\nIn the culture hood, transfer each muscle into a well of a 6-well plate. Using the dissection scissors, cut the muscle in small pieces of about 2 mm. Be careful not to mince the tissue too much.",
    "Carefully add 2.5 ml of 0.1% pronase solution to each well and incubate at 37 °C for 60 min. Gently shake the plate after 20, 40, and 60 min. Note: The exact duration of the incubation depends on factors like age and strain of the animals.\nMonitor under the microscope. Check the muscle fragments and stop the enzymatic digestion when the fibers bundles get a loosened appearance (Figure 5).\nAdd 2.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% HS and 1% P/S. Transfer to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge the tubes at 400 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant by decantation.\nAdd 5 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% HS and 1% P/S. Pipette the solution up and down with a 10 ml plastic pipette (trituration) for at least 20 times to homogenize the tissue.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 200 x g for 4 min. Collect the supernatant and transfer into a 15 ml tube.\nAdd 5 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% HS and 1% P/S. Pipette again with a 10 ml plastic pipette until the tissue fragments passes easily through the pipette.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 200 x g for 4 min and collect the supernatant in a 15 ml tube.\nPut a cell strainer (40 µm) onto a 50 ml tube and transfer the supernatant containing the dissociated cells onto the filter. Wash with 1 ml DMEM for maximal cell recovery.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1,000 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant with a pipet.\nResuspend the pellet in 300 µl culture medium and count the cells in a hemocytometer.\n4. Differentiation of Satellite Cells on Extracellular Matrix Gel Spots\nDilute the cell suspension to obtain 1.5 x 103 cells in 10 µl of culture medium.",
    "Secure the covers of the chambers slides with tape and mark the spots with a black marker on the bottom side of the object glass.\nUsing a micropipette, put a drop of 10 µl cell suspension onto the extracellular matrix gel spot. Check under the microscope whether the drop of cell suspension has been placed correctly on the spot. Incubate for six hours at 37 °C.\nCarefully add 400 µl of culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 10% HS, 1% P/S and 1% CEE) and incubate for three days at 37 °C.\n\tNote: At this point, freshly isolated SC are subjected to massive trauma (enzymatic digest and harsh trituration) and they need to recover. Do not disturb the cells during the first three days 37. Next, the culture medium can be changed depending on the type of experiment.\n\tThe extracellular matrix gel spots can be seeded with a high cell density (1.5-2.5 x 103/20 µl) for differentiation assay. Culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 10% HS, 1% P/S and 1% chicken embryo extract) can be replaced every third day.\nAlternatively, if expansion and passing is desired follow the next steps:\n\t\nThaw an aliquot extracellular matrix gel (500 µl) at 4 °C for at least 1.5 hr. Dilute 1:10 in DMEM and follow the recommendations in point 1.1.1.\nPre-chill a 10 ml pipette for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer three T75 flasks onto a cold surface (e.g. a freezer pack) for 10 min.\nUse the pre-chilled pipette to put 1 ml extracellular matrix gel into each flask. Check that the surface is covered completely. Keep the flasks on the cold surface for at least another 7 min (Figure 1A).",
    "Completely remove the remaining extracellular matrix gel with a 10 ml pipette, and dry the wells at 37 °C for 1 hr.\nAfter counting, resuspend the freshly isolated SCs in 10 ml of culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 10% HS, 1% P/S and 1% chicken embryo extract) and seed in the pre-coated T75 flasks.\nAfter three days, change the medium (and every third day) until 80% confluence is reached. For passaging, wash the T75 flasks three times with PBS. Next add 1 ml 0.25% trypsin solution and incubate for three min at 37 °C. Resuspend in 9 ml of culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 10% HS, 1% P/S and 1% chicken embryo extract) and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. After counting, resuspend 1 x 106 cells in 1,000 µl of culture medium and freeze the cells."
