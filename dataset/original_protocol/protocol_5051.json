    "Obtain murine bone marrow cellsNote: All animal experiments have to be approved by local animal care and ethics authorities.Sacrifice desired mice strain by CO2 euthanization or cervical dislocation.Extract the femurs, tibias and iliac crest bones using forceps and sharp scissors. Place the bones in a small dish supplemented with PBS+/+ on ice. Flush total bone marrow cells from the bone cavity with 1-5 ml ice cold PBS (per mouse) using a 1 ml syringe and 25 G needle. Obtain single cell suspension by simply resuspending the cell solution using the same syringe. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170212/20170212184339_7957.jpgFigure 1. Process of flushing bone marrow out of murine bones. A. Femurs, tibias and iliac crest bones before flushing; B. Femurs, tibias and iliac crest bones after flushing; C. 1 ml syringe with its 25 G needle inserted in the tibia bone cavity.Filter the cells by passing the cell solution through 70 μm nylon strainer to obtain a uniform single-cell suspension.Centrifuge the cells (289.5 x g, 5 min) and resuspend in 1 ml LDV medium. Count the cells by diluting the cells 1:10 with Turk’s solution. Count the cells under the inverted light microscope using the hemacytometer. From one mouse typically one will get 60-90 million cells from both femurs and tibias and iliac crest bones.Determination of VLA-4 affinity using flow cytometry (LDV assay)VLA-4 affinity can be examined on fresh bone marrow cells obtained from treated animals. Alternatively, cells can be obtained from untreated animals and treated in vitro with a desired reagent, in the presence of LDV medium, followed by the abovementioned detailed protocol.Note: It is recommended to continue with the staining after isolation of the bone marrow cells.Place 5 million bone marrow cells in a total volume 100 μl of LDV medium (see Recipes) in a FACS tube.",
    "Add LDV-FITC to achieve a final concentration of 10 nM (see Recipes) and mix gently by pipetting, do not vortex.To determine LDV-FITC non-specific binding, add EDTA to each LDV-FITC sample at a final concentration of 5 mM.Incubate all the samples for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, put the tubes immediately on wet ice and fix the cells by adding ice cold 4% PFA for 10 min (i.e., the reaction is in 100 µl of cells, thus add 4% PFA [1-2 ml] directly to the tube). Since that moment, cells need to be kept under cold conditions on wet ice. Avoid vortex along the procedure. Wash the cells with 2 ml ice cold PBS+/+.Centrifuge the cells (289.5 x g, 5 min) and gently discard the supernatant. Add 100 µl of ice cold PBS+/+ and perform staining of the cell surface markers Lineage (1-2 µl per sample of each antigen), Sca-1 (2 µl/sample), c-Kit (2 µl/sample), CD150 (2 µl/sample), CD48 (1 µl/sample) and EPCR (2 µl/sample). These cell surface markers are only suggestive antigens to detect LT-HSCs, however, this can be adjusted according to the research question needs. Color combination should fit with FITC as LDV peptide is conjugated with the FITC fluorochrome.Add the required antibodies into the cell samples and mix gently by pipetting (do not vortex), and incubate for 30 min on ice and protected from light. Wash the cells with 1 ml ice cold PBS+/+, centrifuge (289.5 x g, 5 min) and gently discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 300 μl PBS+/+, do not vortex. Read the samples immediately by flow cytometry and determine LDV binding to LT-HSC by analyzing the intensity of the FITC fluorochrome on gated Lineage-/c-Kit+/Sca-1+/CD150+/CD48-/EPCR+ cells."
