  "procedures": [
    "The following steps/procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines after approval from the Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee of Tulane University.\n1. Preparation of mice\nUse male and/or female adult mice aged between 3-5 months. In the present study, we used male C57BL/6J mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory, but any mouse strain from a reputable supplier can be used.\nAt least one week before the experiment, house all the mice individually on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle throughout the study. Provide the mice ad libitum access to food and water.\nPerform all behavioral experiments during the light cycle. Perform all sessions at the same time of day within an individual cohort. For example, if starting the experiment at 9 AM on Day 1, continue starting at that time until the experiment is completed.\n2. Preparation of study materials\nStudy contexts\n\t\nChoose two different contexts to perform the experiments in.\nUse a cylindrical chamber composed of clear Plexiglas (diameter 30 cm) as context A, with a smooth Plexiglas floor. The height of the chamber should be sufficient to prevent escape (at least 30 cm high).\nFor Context B use a rectangular enclosure (25 cm x 30 cm) with an electrical grid floor used to deliver alternating current footshocks. The height of this chamber is very important and should be at least 35 cm. high. Alternatively, use a transparent roof (ensure that video can be recorded through this material).\n\t\tNOTE: Use a chamber with smooth wall surfaces that can be easily cleaned.",
    "Use a different cleaning solution to clean the contexts. For example, clean context A with 1% acetic acid and context B with 70% ethanol. Clean the contexts before beginning the first session, between testing individual mice, and after completion of the day’s sessions. This is vital to remove the olfactory cues from previous mice. Thorough cleaning will also help prevent urine scaling on the shock grid, which will compromise conditioning sessions.\n\t\tNOTE: The cleaning solutions also serve as an olfactory cue, therefore use the same cleaning liquid for a particular context.\nPlace context A or context B in a sound-attenuating box during respective study sessions.\nAudio generator\n\t\nMount an overhead speaker above the contexts to deliver auditory stimuli at 75 dB.\nUse a programmable audio generator to generate auditory stimuli on a pre-defined schedule. The 7.5 kHz pure tone is a sound with a sinusoidal waveform, whereas the white noise is a random signal having equal intensity at different frequencies, ranging from 1-20,000 Hz.\nUse TTL pulses to deliver auditory stimuli and shock signals with temporal precision.\n\t\tNOTE: Before starting the experiments, measure the sound intensity output from the mounted speaker in each chamber using a dB meter.\nShocker: Connect the shocker with the electrical grid floor which is used to deliver the 0.9 mA AC shock. Define the frequency, onset, and duration of shocks in a computer program. Deliver each shock stimulus at the end of each SCS for a duration of 1 s, totaling five SCS-shock pairings per conditioning session.\n3. Preparation of computer program and video tracking\nGenerate behavioral protocols using coding in a software program.",
    "In the program, define the serial compound stimulus SCS. This stimulus is a serial presentation of a 10 s pure tone (each pip is presented for 500 ms, at frequency of 7.5 kHz and rate of 1 Hz) and 10 s white noise (500 ms pips at 1 Hz).\nDefine the inter-trial intervals (ITI) presented following each trial, pseudorandomly.\nDuring the study, record all mouse behavior to video for subsequent analysis.\n\tNOTE: Commercially available fear conditioning boxes may not be set up to record the behaviors through the top-mounted camera. This is very important since the recorded video is used to calculate horizontal movement, speed and total distance travelled by the animal.\nFor setting the software tracking, place a test mouse in each relevant context, adjust the contour tracking sensitivity, and define the center of gravity. This will ensure the acquisition of reliable data on relative position. In addition, define the whole context area accessible to the subject.\n\tNOTE: The adjustment of contour size for both contexts is important as the change in brightness in different contexts will change the contour size.\nDetermine a calibration coefficient using the chambers’ known sizes and the camera’s pixel dimensions which can be used to calculate speed (cm/s).\nSynchronize the data acquisition computer’s timestamp events to their real-time occurrences.\n4. Behavioral experiment\nTurn on all the equipment: computers, fear conditioning box controller, shocker, and video and timestamp recording software. Make sure instruments are turned on in the appropriate order.\nCheck all the functions including tone, white noise, and shock delivery, and set up the system for the data acquisition.\nTransport the animals from their storage room to the conditioning room. Allow them to acclimatize there for at least 10 min.",
    "Take the animal out from the home cage, gently place it in the respective context, and then immediately activate the computer programs.\n\tNOTE: The initialization of both fear conditioning system and data collection (timestamps, mouse tracking and video recording) software at a time can be synchronized using TTL pulse mediated activations.\nPre-conditioning/Pre-exposure\n\t\nOn Day 1, place the subject into context A (neutral context). Allow it to acclimate to the chamber for 3 min (the baseline period), and then expose it to 4 trials of a SCS of 20 s total duration (Figure 1A-1B).\nMaintain a 90 s average pseudorandom ITI (range 80-100 s). The total duration of each pre-exposure session is 590 s.\nFear conditioning\n\t\nOn Day 2 and Day 3, place the subject into Context B. Following a 3 min baseline period, expose the subject to five pairings of the SCS co-terminating with a 1 s, 0.9 mA AC footshock.\nMaintain a 120 s average pseudorandom ITI (range 90-150 s). Have each conditioning session last for 820 s in total (Figure 1A).\nDepending on the goal of the experiment, subject mice on Day 4 to either a recall test (see step 4.7) or to fear extinction (see step 4.8).\nFear recall (to test context dependence)\n\t\nOn Day 4, place the subject into Context A. After the 3 min baseline period, present it with 4 trials of the SCS without footshock, over 590 s.\nMaintain a 90 s average pseudorandom ITI (range 80-100 s).\nFear extinction\n\t\nOn Day 4, place the subject into context B. Following the 3 min baseline period, present 16 trials of the SCS without footshock, over 1910 s.\nMaintain a 90 s average pseudorandom ITI (range 60-120 s).\nReturn the animal to its home cage and repeat the procedure for all the animals.",
    "5. Quantification of behavior\nHave an observer blind to the experiment score the recorded videos for freezing behavior using automatic freezing detector thresholding followed by a frame-by-frame analysis of pixel changes.\n\tNOTE: Other software packages can also be used to calculate freezing automatically by using 2 camera system. It is also possible for an observer to manually score freezing behavior.\nDefine freezing as a complete cessation of bodily movements, except for those required for respiration, for a minimum of 1 s.\nScore jumps when all 4 of the paws leave the floor, resulting in a vertical and/or horizontal movement.\nExport the marked file with freezing, jump and event markers.\nExtract relevant events (freezing and jumps) from defined time periods (e.g., 10 s duration of pre-SCS, tone and white noise, for each trial).\nUsing the extracted start-stop durations of events in a spreadsheet file, calculate the duration of freezing (in s) by subtracting start time from end time, from the respective trial periods.\nRepresent this data trial-wise or day-wise, by summing up freezing duration from all trials.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the purpose of the study, the flight or freezing behaviors can be scored and calculated from any trial/duration from the study session.\nSum the total number of jumps from a particular trial duration.\nExtract the file generated by mouse tracking coordinates from frame by frame X-Y axis movement of the center of gravity of mouse and calculate the speed of the mouse (cm/s).\n\tNOTE: The speed data may be present either in the cm/s or pixel/s format. Convert the pixel/s unit to cm/s by using inch or cm/pixel value defined in the video for that testing context (please see section 3.6).",
    "After extracting speed data for frame by frame movement of the animal, based on frame rate of the video (preferably 30 frames/s), calculate the average speed of the animal in a specific frame number bracket (multiply start and end times in s by 30 to get the start and end frame number).\nCalculate the flight scores by dividing the average speed during each SCS by the average speed during the 10 s pre-SCS (baseline, BL) and then adding 1 point for each escape jump (speedCS/speedBL + # of jumps). A flight score of 1 therefore indicates no change in flight behavior from the pre-SCS period.\nOptionally, score videos manually for other behaviors such as rearing and grooming.\n6. Statistical analysis\nAnalyze data for statistical significance using statistical analysis software. For all tests, the definition of statistical significance is P<0.05.\nCheck the data for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (α=0.05).\nTo test the effect of cues, carry out the pairwise comparisons using the appropriate parametric (paired t-test) or non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) test.\nTo assess the 2-way interaction of factors (cue X trial), perform a 2-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests (e.g., Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test/Tukey’s test).\nSubscription Required.
