    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMicroinjection of oocytes with transcribed cRNA\nTiming: Day 1 [1–2 h]\nThe cRNA for each construct that is to be expressed in the oocytes is injected along with appropriate control groups.\nSelect oocytes that are in stage IV or V of maturation.\nMix 20 ng each of CIBN-CAAX, CRY2-5-ptaseOCRL and rat Kir2.1 RNA in a tube brought up to a final volume of 1 μL with RNAse-free water.\nNote: This recipe allows 20 oocytes to be injected with 50 nL each containing 1ng of each construct.\nPull needles for microinjection to an internal diameter of 12–18 microns from glass capillaries.\nPrefill the injection needle with mineral oil and then fit it onto the injection needle.\nNote: This ensures that there is no air-gap between the needle and the injection mix, allowing accurate volumes to be dispensed with each injection.\nPipette the RNA onto a piece of parafilm placed on the sample stage of the injection set-up.\nUsing a dissecting microscope head to visualize the working field, aspirate the RNA drop into the injection needle by holding down the ‘fill’ button.\nPipette oocytes onto a grid filled with OR2(+) and inject each oocyte with 50 nL of the RNA mixture.\nFollowing injection, incubate the oocytes for 1–2 days at +17°C in OR2(+) supplemented with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin in a petri dish.\nNote: Cover the petri dish with foil to decrease the exposure to ambient light.\nTwo-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC)\nTiming: Day 2 [3–4 h]\nInjected oocytes are evaluated in electrophysiology experiments with blue light illumination to assess the response of expressed proteins to PI(4,5)P2 dephosphorylation.\nA day prior to the experiment, pull borosilicate glass pipettes (thin-walled glass 1.0 OD/ 0.7 I.D).\nCut pipettes to 10–15 μM in diameter at the tip.",
    "Prefill the recording pipettes with filling solution containing 3 M KCl and 1.5% agarose.\nNote: We find that ‘agarose-cushioned’ recording pipettes facilitate stability in longer experiments by reducing KCl leakage into the oocyte.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nSet-up for TEVC by priming the perfusion apparatus.\nFlush the perfusion tubes with warm water.\nAdd low-K (96 mM Na+), high-K (96 mM K+) and 10 mM BaCl2 made up in high-K to separate reservoirs in the perfusion set-up.\nPrime their flow to attain a flow rate of 1–2 drops per second.\nAdjust the bath aspiration to obtain a quick exchange rate of the bath solution with the perfusate.\nOrient the blue light apparatus toward the oocyte recording chamber.\nTo perform a two-electrode voltage-clamp experiment, open the recording program WinWCP and create a -80 to +80 mV ramp protocol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) by navigating from Setup > Stimulus/recording protocol editor.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2333-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. WinWCP screenshots to create a voltage-ramp recording protocol\n(A) Recording details entered in each field.\n(B) Waveform details entered by dragging hold and ramp waveforms into relevant boxes. Blue arrows indicate the box that needs to be clicked to enter details of that waveform to the right of the window.\nStimulus/recording protocol editor:\nOn the left panel set stimulus type to ‘voltage’ and the holding potential to 0 mV.\nUnder the ‘Recording’ tab, change the recording duration to 360 ms, with a stimulus repeat period of 1 s and no. of records set to 10000.\nUnder the ‘Stimulus’ tab, drag AO waveforms step (П), ramp (/) and step (П) from the toolbox into the boxes under the ‘protocol’ section.\nAmend the details for each part of the protocol as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nSave this protocol in a folder and close the protocol editor.",
    "From the overhead menu, navigate to record > record to disk and select the folder in which the protocol is saved and then select the protocol in the protocol drop-down menu.\nPlace the pre-filled glass pipettes over the silver electrode wires.\nLower the pipettes into the bath solution and compensate the pipette junction potential by turning the appropriate amplifier knobs corresponding to each electrode.\nCheck the resistance of the electrodes on the recording amplifier, this should fall in the range of ∼0.2–1 MΩ.\nPlace an oocyte into the recording chamber and insert both recording pipettes into the oocyte under low-K+ perfusion.\nCreate a new data file in WinWCP (file > new data file) and name the file.\nHit ‘record’.\nAfter the current stabilizes under low-K+, switch the perfusion to high-K+ and wait for the increase in current to stabilize.\nAfter current in high-K+ has stabilized, turn-on the blue LED to activate the phosphatase.\nAfter the current decay pursuant to blue-light activation reaches steady-state, switch the perfusion to 10 mM Ba2+ in high-K.\nNote: Barium is a blocker of Kir2.1 channels and removes any residual Kir2.1 channel current from the remaining signal. The residual current after barium block corresponds to non-specific ‘leak’ current in the system that can then be subtracted during subsequent data analysis.\nAllow the current following barium block to stabilize to a steady state level before ending the recording.\nTo begin recording from the next oocyte, start again from step 7.",
    "Critical: Chloride the silver wires used for recording as well as bath electrodes by placing them in commercial bleach for ∼5 min. Wires should then be rinsed in water and dried before they are used in experiments. Optimize the setting on the ‘blue’ LED to attain close to 5 mW/cm2 of power for optimal recruitment of the phosphatase to the oocyte membrane. In our experience, it is not critical to orient the oocyte in a specific way (i.e., animal, or vegetal pole) to obtain robust, reproducible responses from Kir2.1 channels. However, other channels of interest might have a more specific distribution that requires optimization of oocyte placement relative to the incident light source. Please see the limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section of this protocol for more information.\nData analysis\nTiming: Day 3 [2–3 h]\nOpen the file in WinWCP.\nGo to analysis > waveform measurement.\nUnder the analysis tab, drag both olive colored cursors at the edges of the waveform window and place them over the section of the waveform corresponding to the -80 mV step in the voltage protocol, away from the capacitance spikes.\nWithout changing any other window settings, click ‘Do Analysis’ on the left panel.\nUnder the tables tab, select only ‘record’ and ‘average’ and click ‘add variable’ to populate current values in the table.\nExport data to a spreadsheet using edit > copy data.\nTo make the data compatible with Clampfit software (Molecular Devices), select file > export > (output format Axon ABF) OK. The file will be saved with a ‘∗.abf’ extension in the same folder as the source file.\nCritical: Update the WinWCP software to its latest version from the University of Strathclyde website."
