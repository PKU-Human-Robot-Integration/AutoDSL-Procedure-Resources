    "This research was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico). A schematic flowchart of the general steps of this protocol is shown in Figure 1A.\n1. Embryo incubation and determination of viability\nIncubate fertilized chicken eggs at 38 °C and 60% relative humidity for about three and a half days until they reach the 22 HH stage (according to Hamilton and Hamburger, 1951)16.\n\tNOTE: Freshly fertilized chicken eggs can be stored at 15 °C for up to one week.\n\t\nTo incubate the fertilized eggs, place the eggs vertically with the pointy side down into the humidified incubator. Rotate the eggs during incubation as it is necessary to prevent the developing embryo from adhering to the shell membrane.\n\t\tNOTE: Fertilized hen eggs can be obtained from local farms. Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs are generally used to avoid pigmentation of the feathers in late embryos. Consider incubating enough eggs separately to obtain three structures: (1) limb mesodermal cells, (2) limb ectoderms, and (3) donor embryos to graft the RL.\nAfter three and a half days of incubation, remove eggs from the incubator, swab with 70% ethanol, and allow to air dry.\nIdentify developing embryos candling the egg to observe the blood vessels and locate the embryo. Discard eggs that do not have an embryo.\n\t​NOTE: At this point, distribute the eggs to obtain mesodermal cells, ectoderms, and the hosts for the RL.\n2. Obtaining limb mesodermal cells to fill ectoderms\nNOTE: Before initiating the manipulations, it is highly recommended to disinfect the working area, the microscopes, and all the instrumental by swabbing with 70% ethanol solution.",
    "Tap the blunt end of the eggshell with the end of a blunt forceps to open a window and remove about 1 cm x 1 cm of the shell using the forceps.\nTransfer eggs to a plastic or carton holder and placed them one by one under the stereomicroscope. Identify the air membrane and then remove it by picking a small hole where no vessels are found. Pull this area with the aid of fine surgical forceps.\n\tNOTE: The air membrane can be identified as the white and opaque membrane observed immediately after windowing the egg.\n\t\nRemove any small piece of eggshell that may come into contact with the embryo.\n\t\tNOTE: Verify that the embryos are in the 22 HH stage before initiating the protocol. Embryos in earlier stages can be returned to the incubator after sealing the eggshell window with tape.\nOpen the amniotic sac completely by tearing open the amnion using the fine surgical forceps (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Amnion can be identified as a transparent membrane that closely covers the embryo and is filled with amniotic fluid.\nCarefully remove the embryo from the egg using a pair of blunt forceps and then transfer into a sterile Petri dish containing ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (1x PBS). Repeat this step for the remaining eggs. Consider that only ~8-10 embryos are sufficient to obtain the mesodermal cells.\nWash the embryos once in ice-cold 1x PBS, and with the aid of a stereomicroscope (see Table of Materials), withdraw any remaining membranes. Locate the hindlimb buds.\n\tNOTE: Limb buds are rounded structures situated along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo as protrusions from the flank. The hindlimbs are located more posteriorly than the forelimbs.",
    "Maintain the embryos in clean 1x PBS, and using a pair of fine surgical forceps, snip each hindlimb bud longitudinally. Cut the bud very close to the flank of the embryo to dissect out the whole hindlimb buds. Repeat this step with the remaining embryos.\nUse a plastic transfer pipette to transfer the limb buds into an empty 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nUse a pipette tip to remove any excess of 1x PBS and replace PBS with 500 µL of 0.5% trypsin solution (see Table of Materials). Incubate limb buds in a thermoblock for 7 min at 37 °C.\nRemove the trypsin solution and replace it with 500 µL of collagenase type IV at 2 mg/mL in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (see Table of Materials), then incubate it in a thermoblock at 37 °C for 8 min.\n\tNOTE: Trypsin incubation slightly detaches the ectoderms, while collagenase disaggregate mesodermal cells.\nAfter incubation, remove as much collagenase as possible and replace it with 1 mL of cold Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium-high glucose (DMEM-HG) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to inactivate the enzymes. Pipette the mixture gently ~10 times.\nFilter the suspension containing the cells with a cell strainer of 70 µm to leave behind the ectoderms.\n\tNOTE: Filtration will also remove any undigested limb buds, leaving behind a suspension of single cells.\nAfter filtering, pipette the suspension again 5-10 times and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature, then discard the supernatant.\nUse 1 ml of DMEM-HG supplemented with 10% FBS to wash the excess collagenase. Centrifuge the suspension at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Discard the medium carefully by pipetting and then replace it with 1 mL of fresh DMEM-HG supplemented with 10% FBS without disturbing the cells in the bottom of the tube.\nAllow the cells to form a compact pellet (reaggregate) after incubating them for 1-1.5 h at 37 °C in a thermoblock.\n\t​NOTE: While mesodermal cells are forming the pellet, it is convenient to obtain the limb ectoderms.\n3. Obtaining the limb ectoderms\nRepeat steps 1-6 from section 2 separately with the other 22 HH chicken embryos chosen to obtain the ectoderms.\n\tNOTE: The number of embryos for this purpose is proportional to the final number of the RL desired. A ratio of 2:1 ectoderms-RL is appropriate.\nAfter obtaining the hindlimb buds, use a plastic pipette to transfer them into an empty microcentrifuge tube. Remove any excess 1x PBS and replace it with 500 µL of 0.5% trypsin in sterile 1x PBS. Incubate the mixture for 30 min at 37 °C in a thermoblock.\nAfter the enzymatic digestion, transfer the trypsin solution containing the limb buds into a sterile Petri dish.\nRemove the excess trypsin as much as possible using a micropipette; flood the Petri dish with ice-cold 1x PBS supplemented with 10% of FBS until all limb buds are covered.\n\tNOTE: FBS can be substituted for horse serum.\nIdentify the limb buds under the stereomicroscope; identify the ectoderm as a slightly detached transparent membrane from the limb mesodermal cells (Figure 1B).\nHold the most proximal end of the limb bud with the aid of fine surgical forceps while carefully detach and separate the ectoderm layer using the other forceps.",
    "NOTE: Obtaining the ectoderms could be difficult due to mesodermal cell clumping and attaching to ectoderms, thus causing them to become sticky. It is recommended to constantly discard the mesodermal cells to maintain only the ectoderms in the Petri dish.\nMaintain the ectoderms in ice-cold 1x PBS-10% FBS solution.\n\t​NOTE: Ectoderms can be stored at 4 °C in case the reaggregated mesoderm is not ready. However, it is preferable to coordinate the incubation time of the pellet with the ectodermal obtaining.\n4. Assembling mesodermal cells inside the ectodermal cover\nNOTE: For this, it is necessary to have the empty ectoderms in a Petri dish with sterile 1x PBS-10% FBS solution containing a formed pellet of mesodermal cells.\nAfter the pellet is formed (see section 2), discard ~600 µL of the medium from the tube by pipetting.\nCarefully detach the pellet from the bottom using a pipette tip and without smashing or destroying it.\nWhen the pellet is completely detached from the bottom of the tube, turn the tube upside down to transfer the pellet into the Petri dish containing the empty ectoderms (Figure 1C).\nCut a small piece of the pellet with the aid of a pair of fine surgical forceps and place it as close as possible to the ectoderm.\nAs if it were a bag, open the ectoderm with the surgical forceps, and place the piece of pellet as tightly as possible into the ectodermal cover. Repeat this step for as many RLs as desired (Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: Cut the pieces of the pellet one by one, and fill the ectoderms to maintain clean the 1x PBS-10% FBS solution. The size of the pellet needs to correspond to each ectoderm.",
    "Allow the ectoderm and the mesoderm to heal together for ~30 min at room temperature and then graft them into the embryo host. Discard the unused ectoderm and mesoderm.\n5. Transplantation of the filled ectoderm into a host embryo\n \nNOTE: Before transplanting the ectoderms, arrange two stereomicroscopes next to each other on a benchtop, one for embryo manipulation and RL grafting. The other is for maintaining the filled ectoderms ready to transfer into the embryo.\nSelect the number of desired eggs to graft the filled ectoderms.\nUsing the end of a blunt forceps, tap the eggshell of the 22 HH host embryos to open a window. Identify the air membrane and, using a pair of fine surgical forceps, remove it completely.\nOpen the amniotic sac near the forelimb to expose the right flank of the embryo. Open only the amount needed to accomplish the procedure.\nGuided by the forelimb position, perform wound scratching with a tungsten needle (see Table of Materials) to the length of 2-3 somites, slightly damaging the mesoderm until it bleeds.\nIndividually transfer a filled ectoderm (RL) into the chick embryo and place the base of the recombinant limb over the somite wound.\n\tNOTE: RL transfer can be done with a plastic pipette or with an angled slit knife.\nFix the RL correctly with two pieces of palladium wire of 0.025 mm diameter and 0.5-1 mm length (see Table of Materials). Align the base of the RL with the wound to ensure that it will be attached to the flank of the host embryo and vascularized (Figure 1E).\nSeal the window with tape, and return the egg to the incubator. Collect the embryos at the desired time points for analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
