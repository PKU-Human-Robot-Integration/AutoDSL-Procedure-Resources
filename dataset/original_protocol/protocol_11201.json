Preparation of fibrinogen stock solution\nPrepare a 1 M calcium chloride (CaCl2) stock solution, by weighing 2.21 g CaCl2 and adding it to 20 mL distilled water (dH2O). Stock solution can be stored at room temperature (RT).\nPrepare a 20 mL aprotinin stock solution (1218.75 KIU/mL) by weighing 5 mg of aprotinin and adding it to 20 mL dH2O. Aliquot stock solution into 1 mL aliquots and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare a 10 mL of 80 mg/mL fibrinogen stock solution.\n\t\nIn a 50 mL tube add 7.849 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 2.051 mL aprotinin stock (1218.75 KIU/mL) for a final aprotinin concentration of 250 KIU/mL and 100 µL CaCl2 (1M) for a final CaCl2 concentration of 10 mM.\nWeigh 800 mg of fibrinogen.\nWeigh 200 mg sodium chloride (NaCl) for the stock solution to contain 2% w/v NaCl.\nAdd the fibrinogen and NaCl in increments to the 50 mL tube containing the PBS, aprotinin and CaCl2. Do not stir or shake vigorously as this will result in fibrinogen gelling and lumps forming in the solution.\nPlace the 50 mL tube of the fibrinogen stock solution horizontally on a shaker and shake at a low setting of 300 rpm.\nOnce the solution has dissolved, filter it using a 0.22 µm syringe filter or a bottle top filter depending on the volume. Importantly, do not autoclave the fibrinogen solution as this will destroy the fibrinogen.",
    "NOTE: This part of the protocol can take between 2 to 5 h depending on the amount of stock solution, this time should be taken into consideration during the experimental setup.\n2. Coating inserts with collagen prior to seeding the hydrogels onto the inserts\nIn a laminar flow hood or a tissue culture hood, using sterilized tweezers, remove inserts from the plate and place inverted onto the lid of the plate.\nPrepare a 100 mL of 20 mM glacial acetic acid stock solution by adding 115 µL of glacial acetic acid to 25 mL of dH2O and adjust to a final volume of 100 mL with dH2O. Filter the solution using a 0.22 µm syringe filter. Stock solution can be stored at RT.\nPrepare 2 mL of a 100 µg/mL collagen solution from a 5 mg/mL collagen solution by adding 40 µL of the 5 mg/mL collagen solution to 1.960 mL of the 20 mM glacial acetic acid stock solution prepared in 2.2.\nCoat the inserts with the 100 µg/mL collagen solution prepared in 2.3 by pipetting 100 µL of the solution onto each insert. Let inserts air dry within the laminar flow hood or tissue culture hood for 2 to 3 h.\nOnce inserts have dried wash each insert 3x with PBS. Add 1 mL of PBS to each well of a 12 well plate, place the inserts with collagen coating facing down into the wells, remove PBS from the well and repeat the procedure. Let inserts air dry within the laminar flow hood 1 to 2 h.\n\tCAUTION: Acetic acid is toxic to cells and inserts should be washed thoroughly with PBS.",
    "Add a custom 3D printed spacer over the inserts, this will be necessary once the gels are hanging from the insert to prevent them from touching the bottom well of the plate (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61606/61606fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Custom 3D printed spacer Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61606/61606fig2large.jpg]\nCover the inverted inserts with the bottom part of the plate and place into the incubator until cells are embedded in the hydrogels and ready to be seeded.\n3. Seeding cells embedded in hydrogels onto inserts\nNOTE: Table 1 provides a description of 3 formulations with varying concentrations fibrinogen that will be prepared.
