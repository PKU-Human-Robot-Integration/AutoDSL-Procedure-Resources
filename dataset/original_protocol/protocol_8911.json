    "1. Anterograde Labeling of RGC Presynaptic Inputs\nNote: All experiments involving the use of animals were reviewed and overseen by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) in accordance with all NIH guidelines.\nSterilize field and instruments.\nAnesthetize mouse with 4 vol % isoflurane in a Plexiglas induction chamber (this vol % isoflurane works for neonatal-adult mice). Observe mice closely to avoid over-anesthetizing. CAUTION: Avoid inhalation with a vacuum waste gas evacuation.\nAfter 1-3 min, (older mice will require less time) ensure appropriate level of anesthesia is achieved by pinching the tail (no reaction should be observed) and observing breathing rate (rate should be slow and steady).\nPlace mouse under the stereo microscope on its side and place nose cone delivering 3-4 vol % isoflurane over the snout (neonates < postnatal day 10 (P10) ~4 vol %; >P10 ~3 vol %).\nExpose the sclera. For injection of neonates prior to eye opening, use a pair of small spring scissors to open the eyelid and pull back the skin to expose the sclera. For older mice, use fingers to pull back the skin surrounding the eye to expose the sclera. CAUTION: In neonates, sometimes another perpendicular cut at the corner of the eye is necessary. Take care when cutting the corner of the eyelid as there is a blood vessel that, if cut, will bleed excessively.\nUse a sterile 30.5 G needle to puncture a small hole in the side of the eye at the line where the sclera begins. Take care to avoid damaging the lens by inserting the needle just far enough that the bevel goes into the eye.\nAllow the vitreous to flow out of the hole and use a sterile cotton-tipped applicator to absorb the liquid.",
    "Once the vitreous has stopped flowing out of the hole, insert a blunt ended needle attached to a Hamilton syringe preloaded with anterograde tracing dye into the hole. CAUTION: Insert needle slowly to avoid puncturing the other side of the eye or damaging the lens.\nSlowly inject dye into the eye. Typically, cholera toxin β subunit conjugated to Alexa 594, 647, or 488 (CTB-594, CTB-647, or CTB-488, 5-6 µg/µl) is used to anterogradely trace RGC inputs. For neonates (≤P10) 1-2 µl is sufficient and for mice >P10 ~3 µl is sufficient. Note: Alexa dyes are particularly resistant to lysosomal degradation\nLeave the needle in the hole for a few seconds and then slowly remove.\nUse a cotton tipped applicator to absorb excess fluid and prevent dye from leaking out.\nApply a small amount of antibiotic ointment to the eye. If eye was surgically opened, gently reposition the eyelids together.\nIf injecting both eyes, repeat procedure on other eye.\nFollowing injection(s), leave mouse under a heat lamp or on a heat pad until it begins to recover from the anesthesia.\nReturn mouse to a clean home cage and monitor to make sure it is fully awake before returning to the colony.\n2. Prepare Tissue for Imaging\nThis tissue preparation protocol is used for reporter mice in which the phagocytes are labeled with fluorescent markers (e.g., CX3CR1-EGFP for microglia). If a reporter line is not available, the investigator can immunostain tissue sections (see Discussion).\n~24 hr after the injection, sacrifice the mouse and dissect the brain.",
    "Drop fix the brain in a Falcon tube filled with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4 °C. CAUTION: PFA is toxic. Avoid inhalation and skin exposure by using in a fume hood or on a downdraft table and wearing personal protective equipment. Notes: Fixation can be shorter (≥4 hr). In addition, instead of drop fixing, 4% PFA perfusion can be used followed by a 2-24 hr drop fix. However, comparison of perfused to drop fixed neonatal and adult brains revealed no difference in image quality or quantification.\nRinse the brain 3x in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\nPour the brain and PFA into an empty weigh boat.\nUse a spatula to transfer the brain to another weigh boat filled with PBS.\nWash brain twice more in PBS (transfer brain to two more weigh boats filled with PBS).\nTransfer the brain to a Falcon tube filled with a 30% sucrose solution. Leave the brain in sucrose at 4 °C until the brain sinks to the bottom of the tube (24-48 hr).\nOnce the brain sinks, prepare the brain for sectioning. The following steps are preparation of 40 µm floating sections using a sliding microtome with a freezing stage (a cryostat can also be used).\n\t\nUse a razor blade to remove parts of the brain that are not needed (for the dLGN, remove the rostral and caudal parts of the brain).\nFreeze the brain on aluminum foil over dry ice. During this time, freeze the microtome stage and fill each well of a 24-well plate with 0.5 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB).\nMount the frozen brain (it should appear opaque) on the freezing stage.\n\t\nApply a small amount of optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) to the stage.",
    "Once the OCT begins to freeze, lay the brain in the OCT. The end of the brain that will be cut should be facing up (e.g., for the dLGN, face the caudal side up).\nCover the brain and OCT with very finely crushed dry ice.\nLeave dry ice on the brain/OCT for ~30 sec.\nUse a large paint brush to remove the dry ice. The brain and OCT should be frozen to the stage.\nBegin sectioning through the tissue until the region of interest (ROI) is reached.\nOnce the ROI is reached, use a small paint brush to remove sections from the blade and transfer them to the 24-well plate containing 0.1 M PB (step 2.5.2). Keep the paint brush moist by wetting it in the 0.1 M PB prior to removing sections from the blade. Note: Sections can be left in 0.1 M PB overnight at 4 °C.\nOnce sections have been collected, visualize the anterograde labeling under a fluorescent dissecting microscope and choose sections that contain the ROI.\nMount sections on a slide with a small paint brush.\n\t\nApply a small pool of 0.1 M PB to a charged microscope slide.\nTransfer the tissue section to the pool of PB.\nUse the PB and paint brush to orient and spread the tissue.\nUse a Kimwipe to wick off excess PB. Take care to avoid wicking off the section.\nAllow to completely air dry.\nApply a small drop of mounting medium to each section and mount a coverslip on top (22 x 50 mm, No. 1.5).\nSeal edges of slide with nail polish and store at -20 °C until imaging session. Note: Although imaging within a week of preparation is advised, slides can be maintained at -20 °C for several weeks prior to imaging.\n3. Imaging Tissue",
    "All images are acquired on a spinning disk confocal microscope (UltraView Vox spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with diode lasers (405 nm, 445 nm, 488 nm, 514 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm)). Images can also be acquired on any microscope with the ability to acquire high resolution z-stacks (e.g., laser scanning confocal microscope, epifluorescent microscope followed by deconvolution, etc.). Frame size is typically 1,000 x 1,000 pixels.\nFind ROI at 10X magnification and acquire an image. For imaging microglia in the retinogeniculate system, the ROI is the most medial dLGN sections.\nShift to higher magnification (a 60X Plan Apo objective, NA = 1.4, is typically used).\nAcquire first field of view containing phagocytes using 0.2 µm z-steps.\nAcquire 15-19 more fields containing phagocytes per animal.\n4. Prepare Images for Quantification (ImageJ)\nOpen z-stack in ImageJ.\nGo to the Image menu, select Color and Split Channels.\nSubtract background from the channel(s) containing the engulfed material.\n\t\nSelect the channel window containing the engulfed material (e.g., presynaptic inputs).\nGo to the Process menu and select Subtract Background. Use a rolling ball radius of 10 pixels for anterograde tracing of presynaptic inputs in the dLGN. Note: The rolling ball radius is determined empirically. However, it should generally be as large as the radius of the largest object in the image that is not part of the background.\nSmooth the channel containing the phagocyte.\n\t\nSelect the channel window containing the phagocyte (e.g., microglia).\nGo to the Process menu and select Filters, Mean. Use a mean filter of 1.5 (this smoothes the image for surface rendering in later steps).\nSubtract background from the channel containing the phagocyte.\n\t\nSelect the channel window containing the phagocyte (e.g., microglia).",
    "Go to the Process menu, select subtract background (settings will need to be empirically determined). Use a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels for EGFP-positive microglia.\nMerge channels by going to the Image menu and selecting Color, Merge Channels.\nCrop ROI containing phagocyte from merged file (this makes surface rendering faster, see step 5).\n\t\nDraw a box around the ROI using the rectangular selections tool in the tool bar.\nGo to the Image menu and select Crop.\nSplit channels again (see step 4.2).\nSave each channel as its own TIFF file.\n5. Prepare Image for Quantification in Imaris\nOpen Imaris and make sure that the Volume icon is selected in the top left menu (Figure 2).\nOpen first channel of cropped image (any of the channels can be opened first, just be consistent).\nAdd the other channel(s). Go to the Edit menu, select Add Channels and select the next channel in the file. (Repeat this step for any remaining channels). Note: To change the color, go to the Display Adjustment window and click on the channel name (Figure 3A). This will bring up a dialogue box to adjust the color. If the Display Adjustment window is not visible, go to the Edit menu and select Display Adjustment.\nAdjust the pixel values. Go to the Edit menu and select Image Properties. In this window, adjust x, y, and z pixel values (These values depend on the microscope, objective, camera, and z-step acquisition and can be found in the software used to acquire the image).\nStep 5.5 will result in a very small image. To resize, click on the Fit icon in the bottom right corner (Figure 2).\nIn the Display Adjustment window, adjust the brightness and contrast for each channel using the left and middle triangles.",
    "6. 3 Dimensional (3D) Surface Rendering of the Phagocyte\nIn the top tool bar, be sure the Surpass mode is selected (Figure 3C).\nIn the Display Adjustment window, uncheck all channels except the phagocyte channel. This will remove them from the field of view.\nClick the Surface Rendering icon (Figure 2).\nA create window will be displayed in the bottom left (Figure 4A), make sure Segment ROI is unchecked in this first window. Click the blue forward button at the bottom.\nAdjust the smoothing.\n\t\nIn the next window, choose the phagocyte channel from the pull down menu (Figure 4B). This adjusts the amount of detail that will be surfaced and should be determined empirically (0.1 µm smoothing is typically used for microglia).\nSelect Absolute thresholding.\nClick on the blue forward button at the bottom.\nThreshold the image.\n\t\nClick on histogram and drag until image is surfaced appropriately (Figure 4C). This is determined empirically by rotating the image to ensure the grey surfaces overlaid on the fluorescent image are an accurate surface representation. Notes: To rotate, select Navigate in the Pointer menu on the upper right side of the screen (Figure 3B), click and hold image to rotate. To return image to original orientation, select Origin Bottom Left from the View menu.\nClick on the blue forward button at the bottom.\nIn the next window, there is an option to filter out any surfaces by size, etc. Unless image is very noisy, do not filter and delete any filters that automatically appear. Click the green arrow at the bottom to finish surface rendering the phagocyte. A new set of tabs will appear (Figure 5)\nIf necessary, delete any surfaces that are not part of the phagocyte of interest.",
    "Make sure that the Select option is selected in the Pointer menu (Figure 3B).\nClick on any surface to be deleted so that it turns yellow. To delete multiple surfaces, click on the surfaces while holding down the control button.\nClick Delete under the Pencil tab.\nSelect and merge all the surfaces of the phagocyte into one surface.\n\t\nClick on the Funnel (i.e. Filter tab; Figure 5C).\nClick Add.\nChoose any filter, drag the histogram to the far left (all surfaces should be yellow).\nGo back to the Pencil tab and click Unify.\nGo to the Graph tab (Figure 5A) and click on Details and select any parameters to display. Select the volume (Figure 5D). For displaying multiple parameters, go to the Wrench icon at the bottom left (Figure 2) and select parameters to record.\nRecord the volume of the phagocyte and save the file before continuing.\n7. 3D Surface Rendering of Engulfed Material\nCreate a new channel for material that has been engulfed by the phagocyte.\n\t\nWhile the phagocyte surface is selected, click on the pencil tab.\nClick Mask All.\nIn the dialogue that appears, select the channel corresponding to engulfed material (e.g., anterograde tracing of presynaptic inputs; Figure 5B).\nCheck duplicate channel before applying mask and hit OK.\nA new channel will appear in the Display Adjustment window that contains only the material that has been engulfed and is inside the phagocyte.\nSurface render the channel containing total engulfed and nonengulfed material.\n\t\nUncheck all channels in the Display Adjustment window except for the channel to be surfaced and uncheck the surface created for the phagocyte.",
    "Click on the Surface rendering icon again (see step 6.3) and create a surface for the channel using the same steps as described for the phagocyte (steps 6.4-6.11). Notes: Be sure to select the correct channel prior to smoothing and thresholding (step 6.5; Figure 4B). Make note of the threshold value (see step 6.6; Figure 4C). This value can also be obtained after the surface rendering is complete (Wand tab; Figure 5A).\nRecord the volume of the total engulfed and non-engulfed material and save the file before continuing.\nSurface render engulfed material (material within the phagocyte).\n\t\nVisualize fluorescence of only the new channel of engulfed material (see step 7.2.1).\nFollow the same steps as above (steps 7.2-7.3). Notes: Be sure to select the correct channel from the pull down menu prior to smoothing (choose the new channel created in step 7.1). In the threshold window, manually enter the threshold value that was set for rendering the total engulfed and non-engulfed material (see step 7.2.2).\nRecord the volume of the engulfed material and save file before continuing.\n8. Calculate the Total Volume of the Field of View\nCreate a new surface for any channel.\nIn the thresholding window (step 6.6), slide the histogram all the way to the left so that the entire field is surfaced.\nFinish surfacing the entire field and record the volume (steps 6.7-6.11).\nSave the file.\n9. Calculate the Amount of Phagocytosed Material\nCalculate the density of the total engulfed and non-engulfed material channel using the following algorithm:\nVolume of Total Engulfed and Non-Engulfed Material (step 7.3) / Volume of Field (step 8). \nCalculate % engulfment per cell using the following algorithm:\n(Volume of Engulfed Material (step 7.5) / Total Volume of the Phagocyte (step 6.11)) x 100",
    "Notes: To account for variations in cell size, data are normalized to the total volume of the phagocyte. If numbers from step 9.1 are highly variable across fields, it may be necessary to normalize the data from step 9.2 to the calculation in 9.1.\nSubscription Required.
