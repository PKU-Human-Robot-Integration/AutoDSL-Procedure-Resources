    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDevice fabrication\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis part describes the protocol for fabricating the blast cell biochip. The major steps include fabricating each element and assembling them to form a working device.\nDraw the pattern of the device with the AutoCAD software, using the following steps in detail:\nDraw a helix under the 2D-drawing mode of AutoCAD using the “Helix” tool.\nNote: The parameters of the helix should be tuned according to the information below: base radius = 3200 μm, top radius = 12200 μm, turns = 10, twist = clockwise (CW), height = 0.\nAfter creating the helix, draw a line perpendicular to the helix terminal in the width of 600 μm.\nSwitch to the 3D-drawing mode, using the “pull” method to transfer the perpendicular line at the helix terminal to a rectangle.\nUse the “Sweep” command to create a spiral pipe with the 600-μm-wide rectangle and the 2D helix.\nUse the “flatten” command to flatten the pattern into a 2D channel Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nSupplement inlet and outlets following the instructions shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nSubmit the design as an AutoCAD file of the final pattern (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) to a local vendor for mask printing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1858-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Pattern drawing in AutoCAD\n(A) Creating the spiral channel using “helix” and “sweep” commands.\n(B) Creating inlet and outlets using “circles”, “lines”, and “trim” commands.

Device fabrication\n(A) Pattern drawing of the chip.\n(B) Master mold on the silicon wafer.\n(C) Preparing PDMS and making pattern layers and bottom layers.\n(D) Bonding a pattern layer and a bottom layer through oxygen plasma.",
    "(E) Assembling experimental setup by connecting hoses to the microfluidic inlets and outlets and priming the chip with a syringe pump.\nNote: Typically, local microelectronic equipment providers would likely provide mask printing and silicon mold fabrication services. Examples are Shenzhen Weina Electronic Technology (China), SIMTech Microfluidics Foundry (Singapore), and MicruX (Spain). It usually takes two weeks to receive the printed mask (the detailed timing between different vendors in the same region usually is similar).\nConduct photolithography to fabricate the master mold.\nDispense 4–6 mL of SU-8 2100 negative photoresist (MicroChemicals, Cat#SU-8-2100) onto a cleaned and dehydrated 4-inch silicon wafer (Shenzhen Weina Electronic Technology, Cat#WNRL-GPSIO136).\nSpin-coat using a spinner (SETCAS Electronics, Cat# KW-4A).\nNote: Conduct the spinning by ramping to the rotational speed of 500 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 5–10 s with an acceleration of 100 rpm/s, and then ramping to 1750 rpm at 300 rpm/s acceleration for 30 s.\nConduct soft baking for the coated wafer by placing it on a level hotplate (Shenzhen Xinhaomai Electronic Technology, Cat#X200) and bake at 65°C for 7 min, followed by 95°C for 45 min.\nCritical: Do not use an oven for baking, as it would lead to incomplete drying.\nTurn on the mask aligner (The Institute of Optics and Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Cat#URE2000/35).\nPlace the baked wafer onto the substrate holder of the mask aligner, and install the feature-printed film mask produced in step 2 onto the mask aligner.\nExpose the wafer to the UV light for 9–10 s.\nConduct post-exposure baking on a level hotplate at 65°C for 5 min, followed by 95°C for 15 min.\nFill a glass dish (150 mm in diameter) with around 100 mL photoresist developer (MicroChemicals, Cat#Y020100).\nImmerse the exposed wafer into the photoresist developer for 17 min to develop patterns.",
    "Note: Gently shake the glass dish during pattern development to wash away the un-crosslinked photoresist.\nTake two glass dishes (150 mm in diameter), fill one dish with a fresh solution of photoresist developer, and the other with isopropyl alcohol (VWR Chemicals, Cat#470301-480).\nImmerse the developed wafer into the fresh photoresist developer to wash for approximately 10 s.\nTake the wafer and immerse it into isopropyl alcohol for another 10 s.\nBake the wafer on a level hotplate at 95°C for 30–40 min.\nNote: Step 3m (final baking) aims at drying the isopropyl alcohol and strengthening the crosslinked photoresist. The final product would be a silicon mold with patterns of the microchannels (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPause point: Fabricated master mold can be stored at room temperature (24°C–26°C) until use.\nBefore soft lithography, prepare the PDMS (Dow, Cat#01673921) mixture.\nPlace a disposable cup on balance and zero the balance.\nWeigh and mix 10 g of the PDMS substrate and 1 g of curing agent (ratio of 10: 1).\nCritical: Mix the PDMS substrate and curing agent thoroughly by stirring the mixture (with any tools that wouldn’t pollute the mixture, including a clean plastic pipette or a disposable spoon).\nPlace the mixed PDMS substrate and curing agent into a desiccator.\nLink the desiccator to a vacuum pump (Cat#167300-22) through a hose.\nTurn on the vacuum pump to draw out the gas inside the desiccator for approximately 30 min to remove bubbles inside the PDMS substrate.\nNote: Working pressure of vacuum pump in step 4e is around 100 kPa.\nPause point: At this step, the prepared PDMS can be stored in the refrigerator at −20°C for a maximum of 2 weeks.\nFabricate the pattern layer of the spiral microfluidics (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPour the prepared PDMS directly on the silicon master mold and distribute it evenly.",
    "Place the silicon mold with PDMS into a desiccator, and degas with the same method described in step 4.\nAfter complete defoaming, check the PDMS substrate carefully.\nNote: If residual bubbles are in the PDMS substrate, the user can gently use a tweezer to remove residual air bubbles on the PDMS surface.\nIncubate the device in a 70°C oven (JEIO TECH, Cat#AAH14012K) to solidify for an hour.\nCut the four sides of the solidified pattern layer with a knife and separate it from the mold with tweezers to obtain a complete spiral microfluidic pattern layer.\nCritical: The unused pattern layers should be covered with tape to avoid the adhesion of oil residue, fingerprints, soil, dust particles, or other micro fragments.\nFabricate the bottom layer of the spiral microfluidics (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPour the prepared PDMS on a 120 mm plate and distribute the PDMS evenly.\nUse a desiccator and a vacuum pump to remove bubbles in the PDMS for 10–20 min (using the same method described in step 4).\nAfter desiccation, use tweezers to remove the residual air bubbles on the PDMS surface.\nIncubate the bottom layer in a 70°C oven for an hour to solidify the PDMS.\nUse a knife to cut out an area equivalent to the size of the pattern layer.\nNote: If there are oil residue, fingerprints, soil, dust particles, or other micro fragments (such as pollen or spores) on the pattern and bottom layers, the user can use an optical tape to remove them by sticking the tape to the layers repeatedly and gently.\nPunching inlet and outlets on the pattern layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nHold the plastic handle of a biopsy puncher (Miltex, Cat#15110-15) and vertically align the steel tip to an inlet or outlet.",
    "Increase the force to vertically insert the tip of the biopsy puncher into the PDMS layer until it penetrates the whole layer.\nPress the plunger to expel the PDMS specimen and gently pull out the tip from the PDMS layer, remaining a 1.5 mm crack-free hole on the pattern layer.\nRepeat steps a to c for all the one inlet and three outlets.\nAssembling pattern layer and bottom layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nTurn on the power of the oxygen plasma cleaner machine (HarrickK Plasma, Cat#PDC-002).\nSelect HI mode at a pressure of 700–800 mTorr, and perform plasma treatment for 5 min.\nAfter oxygen plasma treatment, align the pattern and bottom layers and press firmly.\nAt the same time as step c, use clamps (Deli, Cat#8562) to clamp the periphery of the finished product to enhance adhesion.\nAfter finishing the operations above, quickly place the product into a 70°C oven to enhance the bonding and incubate for an hour to bond the device firmly.\nVerify the newly fabricated devices (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nInsert silicon hoses (outer diameter = 1.5 mm; inner diameter = 0.5 mm) (Tygon Microbore, Cat#EW-06419-01) into the inlet and three outlets.\nConnect the hose at the inlet to a 10 mL syringe.\nUse a syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems, Cat#NE-4000) to inject water into the spiral microfluidic device at a 1.5 mL/min flow rate.\nVerify that there is no blockage or leakage in the device.\nCritical: During the device checking, attention should be paid to the liquid distribution of the three outlets. The output volume ratio of waste outlet 1: target outlet: waste outlet 2 should be similar to the ratio of their channel widths (5:12:5).\nPause point: Fabricated devices can be stored at room temperature (24°C–26°C) until use.\nPreparation of blood samples\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Red blood cells in the sample need to be lysed and eliminated prior to treatment with BCB to isolate blast cells from clinical blood samples.\nPre-warm the blood (ATCC, Cat#IWB1K2E10ML) sample to restore room temperature (24°C–26°C).\nMix 1 mL blood sample with 9 mL red blood cell lysis buffer (RBC lysis buffer) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#00−4333−57) inside a 15 mL falcon tube.\nShake the tube for 3 min until the contents are dark red to ensure complete RBC lysis.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 5 min (25°C) to deposit white blood cells (WBCs) on the bottom of the tube.\nAspirate the supernatant by a single channel pipette and add 1 mL PBS to mix quickly by pipetting for the wash.\nTransfer the sample to a 1.5 mL tube (Jet Biofil, Cat#CFT001015) and centrifuge (260 × g, 3 min).\nRemove the supernatant with a single channel pipette.\nAdd 1 mL fresh PBS into the tube to resuspend the pellet by a pipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1858-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Blood collection and processing\n(A) Schematic workflow of blood collection and lysis.\n(B) General setup of the biochip for processing lysed blood samples in a feedback-loop mode.\nCritical: The pellets from completely lysed blood samples should be white. If the pellet is still red, the sample should be lysed again. Large counts of RBCs can generate clots that would lead to biofouling within the device and generate background noise during immunostaining.\nPause point: WBCs can be stored in liquid nitrogen for a maximum of 6 months in complete RPMI medium containing 10% DMSO.\nSample processing\nTiming: 20 min for a single run, 30 min for a feedback-loop run",
    "This part of the protocol describes the detailed operations of processing blood samples with the BCB device. Before processing blood samples, the device needs to be pre-treated with BSA to reduce the adhesion of cells to the channel walls and flushed to ensure that no blockage is present in the channels. During the on-chip processing, the flow rate needs to be kept stable to ensure the effective separation of target cells.\nBefore processing, add BSA-PBS solution to the sample to achieve a final BSA concentration of 2.5%.\nNote: Alternative to BSA-PBS in step 18, the user can also dissolve the sample with 0.1% Pluronic acid.\nFill a 10 mL syringe with PBS, and connect the syringe to the inlet of the spiral biochip.\nInstall the syringe onto a syringe pump and prime the chip by flushing with PBS under a 1.5 mL/min flow rate for 60 s (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: During priming of the device, observe the channels under a microscope (4× magnification) to ensure no leaks in the device and contaminants are not blocking the channels.\nSingle-run blast cell isolation:\nEstimate the cell concentration of the lysed blood sample with a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the lysed blood sample at 260 × g for 5 min to remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells to a final concentration of ≤ 100,000 cells per mL in PBS buffer with 0.1% Pluronic acid.\nLoad the sample into a 10 mL syringe, connect it to the primed chip, and connect the three outlets to three 5 mL centrifuge tubes.\nAfter assembling the setup, prime the sample into the biochip under a 1.5 mL/min flow rate and collect the sample from the target outlet. (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nFor isolation and concentration of blast cells through feedback-loop mode:",
    "After finishing the single isolation run in the last step, resuspend the collected sample from the target (central) outlet in 10 mL PBS buffer with 0.1% Pluronic acid or 2.5% BSA-PBS.\nThe resuspended sample is processed on the biochip at a 1.5 mL/min flow rate.\nFeed the sample from the target outlet back to the biochip and repeat steps a to c until the remaining sample volume from the target outlet is approximately 0.5 mL (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: The feedback-loop mode can increase the purity and concentration of blast cells in the final enriched sample. This repeated feedback-loop process can be achieved by manually redirecting samples from targeted outlets with a syringe pump or directly linking the target outlet to the inlet with a peristaltic pump.\nFlush the biochip with PBS immediately after the end of processing. The device can be reused if the channels remain clean without biofouling.\nImmunostaining\nTiming: 1.5 h\nAfter processing the blood sample with the BCB device, the operator needs to check and identify the target leukemic blast cells from the output using immunostaining and imaging. CD34 and CD38 were used as biomarkers for discriminating blast cells and other leukocytes.\nCentrifuge the sample obtained from the target outlet (260 × g, 5 min).\nReduce the suspension volume to 100 μL by removing the excessive supernatant with a pipette.\nAdd Hoechst (0.1 μL) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#62249), anti-rabbit CD34-PE (0.4 μL) (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-098-140), and anti-mouse CD38-APC (0.4 μL) (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-099-217) to the 100 μL suspension.\nResuspend the solution thoroughly by pipetting.\nIncubate the mixed solution in the dark at 37°C for an hour.",
    "Note: If the cell concentration is too high, more PBS buffer can be added, with the amounts of Hoechst and antibody added revised according to their respective diluting ratio (1:1000 (v/v) for Hoechst and 1:250 (v/v) for anti-CD34 and anti-CD38).\nCentrifuge (260 × g, 5 min) removes the unbound antibodies.\nAdd 1 mL PBS to resuspend the pellet. Centrifuge (260 × g, 5 min) and remove the supernatant with a pipette.\nResuspend the cells with 50 μL PBS and transfer the suspension into a 96-well plate by a pipette.\nCritical: Before imaging, keep the 96-well plate in the dark for about 10 min to allow cells to settle to the bottom of the well.\nImaging\nTiming: 1 h\nImmobilize the 96-well plate mentioned in step 31 on a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Cat#ECLIPSE-Ci) holder, and adjust the focus under brightfield with a 10× objective lens.\nTurn on the laser using the operating software.\nAdjust gain and exposure time, and keep the setting consistent for the imaging process (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1858-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
