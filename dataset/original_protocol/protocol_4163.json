  "procedures": [
    "Preparation of cellsDesign the DNA-binding modules of a TAL protein recognizing a specific sequence (approximately 20 bases) in your target genomic region. Express the TAL protein fused with 3x FLAG tags and the NLS in the cell to be analyzed. An example of the tagged TAL proteins for enChIP is shown in supplemental Figure 1 in the reference (Fujita et al., 2013).Formaldehyde crosslinking of cellsCulture target cells. Use 2 x 107 cells x 2 (total 4 x 107 cells) (e.g. Ba/F3) for chromatin preparation. Collect cells suspended in culture medium (2 x 107 cells/30 ml) in a 50 ml centrifuge tube (if necessary, increase cell number). Prepare 2 tubes (total 4 x 107 cells).Add 810 µl of 37% formaldehyde to 1% final concentration into 30 ml of the cell suspension. Formaldehyde solution is harmful, so handle it wearing gloves in a chemical hood. Incubate at 37 °C for 5-10 min (usually 5 min). Crosslinking makes color of cell suspension slightly yellowish.Stop crosslinking by adding 3.1 ml of 1.25 M glycine solution to 127 mM final concentration. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.Collect cells by centrifugation (300 x g, 4 °C, 5 min). Discard carefully the supernatant including formaldehyde by decantation, and store it in a waste bottle.Resuspend the fixed cells (pellet) in 30 ml of PBS by vortexing. Collect cells by centrifugation (300 x g, 4 °C, 5 min). Discard carefully the supernatant including formaldehyde by decantation, and store it in a waste bottle. Repeat the step B5 (total twice). The formaldehyde wastes should be handled according to the chemical safety guideline of your laboratory. Proceed to the step C1, or the centrifuge tube with the fixed cells (pellet) can be frozen and stored at -80 °C.",
    "Preparation of chromatin (per 2 x 107 cells)Resuspend the fixed cells in 10 ml of CLB. If the fixed cells are frozen in the step B6, it should be thawed before addition of CLB. Incubate on ice for 10 min.Centrifuge at 930 x g at 4 °C for 8 min. Discard carefully the supernatant by vacuum suction.Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of NLB. Incubate on ice for 10 min. Vortex at maximum setting for 2-3 sec every 2-3 min.Centrifuge at 930 x g at 4 °C for 8 min. Discard carefully the supernatant by vacuum suction.Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of PBS. Centrifuge at 930 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Discard carefully the supernatant by vacuum suction. The pellet is used as the chromatin fraction. Proceed to the step D1 or the centrifuge tube with the chromatin fraction can be stored at -80 °C after immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen.Sonication of chromatin (per 2 x 107 cells)Resuspend the collected chromatin fraction in 800 µl of MLB3. Transfer the suspension into a 1.5 ml microtube.Sonicate the chromatin by using ultrasonic disruptor UD-201. Conditions are as follows:Output: 3Duty: 100% (continuous)Time: Free10-18 cycles of sonication for 10 sec and cooling on ice for 20 sec2 min on ice after 5-6 cycles to avoid excessive heatingKeep the position of the tip of the sonication bar approximately 0.5 cm away from the tube bottom using a clamp or hands to avoid foaming.Centrifuge at 16,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant (800 µl) into a 1.5 ml tube. The 1.5 ml tube with the supernatant can be stored at -80 °C after immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen.Evaluation of fragmentation of chromatinResuspend 10 µl of the fragmented chromatin in 85 µl of distilled water.",
    "Add 4 µl of 5 M NaCl. Incubate at 65 °C overnight.Add 1 µl of 10 mg/ml RNase A. Incubate at 37 °C for 45 min.Add 2 µl of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0), 4 µl of 1 M Tris (pH 6.8), and 1 µl of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K. Incubate at 45 °C for 1.5 h.Prepare 1% agarose gel without staining dye.Use 10 µl of the sample prepared in the step E4 for electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel without staining dye. Run the gel at 100 V for 30 min. 1 kbp DNA ladder marker should be loaded to estimate DNA fragmentation.Stain the gel with staining dye (e.g. ethidium bromide) for 0.5-1 h (Figure 1A). An example of DNA fragmentation is shown in Figure 1B. The acceptable range of DNA fragmentation is dependent on the length of your target genomic region. Usually, the range of DNA fragmentation should be generally 4-0.2 kbp (The average length of DNA fragments should be 0.5-2 kbp). If DNA is poorly or excessively fragmented, adjust output or cycles of sonication in the step D2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140510/20140510095817_6511.jpgFigure 1. Gel staining and an example of DNA fragmentation. A. Gel staining with staining dye using a shaker (speed: one turn/1-2 sec). B. An example of DNA fragmentation. M: DNA ladder marker.Preparation of Dynabeads conjugated with antibody (anti-FLAG antibody or normal mouse IgG)Prepare two 2 ml tubes; one is for anti-FLAG antibody and the other is for normal mouse IgG. Add 300 µl of Dynabeads-Protein G in each tube (300 µl x 2 tubes). In this protocol, we describe preparation of one sample for analysis by mass spectrometry. In this regard, normal mouse IgG is used for pre-clear in the step G3 and anti-FLAG antibody is used for affinity purification in the step G5.",
    "If you analyze another sample as a negative control (e.g. affinity purification with normal mouse IgG instead of anti-FLAG antibody), you may prepare chromatin and Dynabeads for it separately.Put the tubes on a magnet stand and wait for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting. Handling of a magnet stand is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140510/20140510095848_1959.jpgFigure 2. Handling of a magnet stand in wash steps. A. Suspension of Dynabeads in a 2 ml tube. B. Setting of the tube on a magnet stand. C. 3 min after the setting. D. Removal of the supernatant by pipetting.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of PBS-T. Put the tubes on a magnet stand and wait for 2 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Repeat the step F3 (total twice).Resuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml of PBS-T-BSA. Add 30 µg of antibody. One tube is for 30 µg of anti-FLAG antibody, and the other is for 30 µg of normal mouse IgG. Rotate at 4 °C overnight.Centrifuge briefly (400 x g for 2-3 sec). Put the tubes on a magnet stand and wait for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Resuspend the pellet in 1.5 ml of PBS-T. Invert several times and centrifuge briefly (400 x g for 2-3 sec). Put the tubes on a magnet stand and wait for 3 min. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.Repeat the step F8, twice (total three times). The Dynabeads are ready for the next step. Chromatin immunoprecipitationTransfer 1.6 ml of the fragmented chromatin, which corresponds to chromatin extracted from 4 x 107 cells, into a 2 ml tube.Add 400 µl of 5% Triton X-100 (in MLB3) to 1% final concentration.Add chromatin solution prepared in the step G2 (2 ml) in the tube, in which the Dynabeads conjugated with normal mouse IgG were prepared.",
