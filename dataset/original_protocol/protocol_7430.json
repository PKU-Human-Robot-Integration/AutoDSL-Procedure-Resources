Overview of procedures for microinflammation detection using Au13 nanoclusters and the CUBIC tissue-clearing method. Mice were immunized with MOG35-55/CFA (IFA containing M. tuberculosis H37RA) and underwent PTx injection. On days 16–20, when experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) develops with clinical scores of 2–3, the EAE mice were injected with Au13 nanoclusters, anesthetized after 2 h, and transcardially perfused with PBS and then PFA. The spine with the ribs was taken out and further subjected to PFA fixation for one day. Then, L1–L6 were excised carefully and immersed in delipidation/decoloration reagent (hexanediol/methylimidazole) for four days (days 1–5). After delipidation and decoloration, L1–L6 were stained with anti-SMA or anti-CD31 for seven days (days 5–12) and subjected to refractive index adjustment in CUBIC-R (days 12–14). The Au signal was visualized by light sheet microscopy and analyzed by Imaris software.Induction of EAE Mix 100 μL (400 μg) of 4 mg/mL of MOG35-55 in PBS and 100 μL of CFA [10 mL of IFA plus two vials (20 mg) of M. tuberculosis H37RA] in two syringes using a three-way stopcock. Emulsify by pressing the syringe back and forth, transferring the contents from one syringe to the other for 5–10 min until a stable white emulsion is produced (for details, see Tanaka et al., 2017).Immunize C57BL/6 mice with 200 μL of MOG35-55/CFA subcutaneously (s.c.) at the tail base using a 1 mL syringe with a 25G needle on day 0.Inject i.v. 400 ng of PTx in 200 μL of saline into the tail vein of mice using an insulin syringe on days 0, 2, and 7.Assess clinical scores of EAE daily with a 0–5 scoring system (0, no signs; 1, flaccid tail; 2, impaired righting reflex and/or gait; 2.",
    "5, paralysis of one hind limb; 3, paralysis of both hind limbs; 4, hind limb paralysis with partial fore limb paralysis; 5, moribund or dead).Preparation of Au13 nanoclusters Synthesize Au13 nanoclusters ([Au13(dppe)5Cl2]Cl3; see Recipe 1) and isolate as crystalline solids according to the procedures described in Shichibu and Konishi (2010).Store 160 μM Au13 nanoclusters in DMSO.Fixation of spines from Au13 nanoclusters–treated EAE mice Prior to injecting into mice, Au13 nanoclusters are diluted 5-fold with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2, see Recipe 2) or saline to 32 μM.Inject i.v. 200 μL of 32 μM Au13 nanoclusters into the tail vein of aEAE mice with clinical score 2–3 using the insulin syringe.After 2 h, anesthetize the mice with 4% isoflurane.Perfuse the mice with PBS (see Recipe 3) and PFA using the winged needle and three-way stopcock locked by syringes.Make an incision in the right atrial appendage of the heart.Perfuse with 25 mL of cold PBS via the left ventricle of the heart using the syringe with the 25G winged needle.After the PBS perfusion, change the solution to 4% PFA using the three-way stopcock.Perfuse with 20 mL of cold 4% PFA.Take out the spine with the ribs (Video 1) and immerse in 40 mL of 4% PFA in a 50 mL tube at 4 °C for 24 h with shaking at 60 rpm in an orbital motion on a TAITEC Shake-LR.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Procedures for the L1-L6 preparation. After transcardial perfusion with PBS followed by PFA, the spine with the ribs was immediately taken out and further fixed with PFA. Then, L1–L6 were excised by carefully cutting the intervertebral discs between T13-L1 and L6-S1 with a razor, with the T13 rib as a position marker under stereomicroscopy installed with an LED illuminator.",
    "Delipidation/decoloration Wash the spine with the ribs with 40 mL of PBS at room temperature for 30 min three times while shaking at 30 rpm in a seesaw motion on a TAITEC Wave-SI.Excise L1–L6 carefully under stereomicroscopy installed with the LED illuminator (Video 1).Immerse L1–L6 in 40 mL of delipidation/decoloration buffer (see Recipe 4) in a 50 mL tube at 37 °C for 4 days with shaking at 80 rpm in a reciprocating motion on an AS ONE Neo shaker NS-LR.Antibody staining Wash L1–L6 with 40 mL of PBS at room temperature for 1 h three times with shaking at 30 rpm in a seesaw motion on the TAITEC Wave-SI.Dilute FITC-conjugated α-SMA antibody and purified rat anti-mouse CD31, which recognize smooth muscle actin on the artery to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 on whole blood vessels, respectively, to 1:50 in staining buffer (see Recipe 5).Immerse L1–L6 in 1.5 mL of the diluted antibody solution in a 5 mL polypropylene tube at room temperature for seven days with light shielding and shaking at 100 rpm in an orbital motion on the TAITEC double shaker NR-30.Wash L1–L6 with 40 mL of PBS in a 50 mL tube at room temperature for 30 min three times with light shielding and shaking at 30 rpm in a seesaw motion on the TAITEC Wave-SI.For anti-CD31 staining:Further immerse L1–L6 in 1.5 mL of Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG diluted to 1:200 in staining buffer at room temperature for two days with light shielding and shaking at 100 rpm in an orbital motion on the TAITEC double shaker NR-30.Wash L1–L6 with 40 mL of PBS in a 50 mL tube at room temperature for 30 min three times with light shielding and shaking at 30 rpm in a seesaw motion on the TAITEC Wave-SI.",
    "Postfix L1–L6 with 10 mL of 1% PFA in PBS at room temperature for 5 h with light shielding and shaking at 30 rpm in a seesaw motion on the TAITEC Wave-SI.Wash L1–L6 with 40 mL of PBS at room temperature for 30 min three times with light shielding and shaking at 30 rpm in a seesaw motion on the TAITEC Wave-SI.Refractive index adjustment Living organisms are composed of molecules with different refractive indices, such as water, proteins, and lipids. In order to observe mammalian tissues in 3D by light sheet microscopy, it is important to suppress light scattering by making the refractive index uniform.Immerse L1–L6 in 10 mL of 1/2 CUBIC-R [diluted CUBIC-R (see Recipe 6) to 1:1 in dH2O] at room temperature for 5 h with light shielding and shaking at 100 rpm in an orbital motion on the TAITEC double shaker NR-30.Discard 1/2 CUBIC-R and immerse L1–L6 in 10 mL of CUBIC-R at room temperature overnight with light shielding and shaking at 100 rpm in an orbital motion on the TAITEC double shaker NR-30.Replace with fresh CUBIC-R and further immerse L1–L6 at room temperature for 4 h with light shielding and shaking at 100 rpm in an orbital motion on the TAITEC double shaker NR-30 (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4644/bioprotoc-13-07-4644-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Detection of microinflammation at L5 by Au13 nanoclusters and staining of the artery with anti-SMA antibody. (A) aEAE mice with clinical score 2.5 and naïve mice were injected i.v. with Au13 nanoclusters or solvent. Figures show cleared L3–L6 from each mouse stained with anti-SMA antibody, which recognizes smooth muscle actin on the artery. The signal of Au13 nanoclusters was visualized as a punctate signal with a diameter of 50–200 nm in the dorsal blood vessels centered on L5 and in the parenchyma of the spinal cords in aEAE mice.
