    "Human umbilical cords for cell isolation were obtained postpartum from informed, healthy women who gave their written consent to the use of this material for research according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethical committee of the University of Rostock has approved the presented study (reg. No. A 2011 06, prolonged 23 September, 2013).\n1. Preparation of Transfection Complexes\nBiotinylation of polyethyleneimine (PEI).\n\t\nDissolve branched PEI in ultrapure water under magnetic stirring at 300 - 400 rpm for 24 h at room temperature (RT) and protected from light to obtain a 0.18-mM solution. Store the solution at 4 °C.\nMeasure the concentration of primary amino groups in the obtained solution21,22.\n\t\t\nUse 2% ninhydrin reagent solution as the amine detection reagent23 by mixing 100 µL of prediluted sample (1:200 with ultrapure water) and 75 µL of ninhydrin reagent. Incubate for 30 min at 80 °C. Cool it down and add 100 µL of 50% ethanol for stabilization. Measure the absorbance at 550 nm on the absorption spectrophotometer.\nCreate a standard curve using glycine.\n\t\t\t\nPrepare 0.1 M amino-N stock solution (0.75 g of glycine in 100 mL of deionized water) and its dilutions, 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:100, 1:200, and 1:400, 1:600. Measure these solutions as in step 1.1.2.1 and create a plot with the concentration and absorbance on the axes.\nBased on the obtained plot and the measured absorbance of the PEI solution, define the concentration of the α-amino groups in PEI.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Caution. Ninhydrin reagent solution must exclusively be used under the hood and should be stored under a nitrogen atmosphere. It is not usable when the color of the solution changes due to oxidation.",
    "Dissolve 100 mg of biotin linker in ultrapure water immediately before use to obtain a 0.01-mM solution. Calculate the required amount of biotin to add to PEI by multiplying the concentration of α-amino groups in PEI (measured in step 1.1.2) by 20 to obtain the necessary amount (in mol) of biotinylating reagent.\n\t\t\nAdd the biotin solution to the PEI solution at pH 8-9 and incubate for 16 h under magnetic stirring at RT.\nRemove the unreacted biotin by size-exclusion chromatography23. Use commercially available columns containing a gel filtration medium appropriate for the purification of the 25-kDA PEI and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Take aliquots after purification to measure the amine concentration using an amine detection reagent (step 1.1.2) and to determine the biotin conjugation efficiency (step 1.2.2). Store the obtained biotinylated PEI at 4 °C.\nCharacterization of biotinylated PEI.\n\t\nDetermine the concentration of α-amino groups in PEI after the biotinylation, as described in step 1.1.2.\nDetermine the degree of PEI biotinylation to verify the conjugation procedure. For quantification, use a commercially available kit, which is based on the application of HABA dye (4'-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid), to ensure the correct colorimetric determination of the biotinylation levels24,25. Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\nFiltration of MNPs and their characterization.\n\t\nFilter commercially available streptavidin-coated MNP through a 0.45-µm syringe-driven filter16 in order to exclude bigger toxic aggregates. Measure the final iron concentration using a standard photometric assay26.\nExamine the quality of the filtered MNPs by recording the magnetization curve and by TEM imaging in accordance with standard protocols27,28.\n\t\t\nDilute the MNP suspension with distilled water and place 3 µL of the obtained suspension on a 300-mesh Formvar carbon-coated copper grid for TEM analysis. Subsequently, place this grid on a glass slide on a heating plate and let it dry.",
    "Analyze the specimen with a transmission electron microscope at 120 kV and verify the elemental content using an X-ray detector27.\n3-color labelling of transfection complexes for super-resolution microscopy.\n\t\nLabel 0.5% of the measured primary amino groups in PEI with NHS-Ester Atto 488 dye following the manufacturer's instructions. Remove the excess unbound dye by size-exclusion chromatography, as described above (step 1.1.4). Measure the resulting concentration of amino groups using a ninhydrin assay (step 1.1.2).\nLabel commercially available scrambled miR (scr-miR) with Cyanine5 dye using a suitable labelling kit15 (indicated in the Materials List). Measure the resulting fluorophore-miR concentration spectrophotometrically.\nFreshly label the MNP each time with biotin-conjugated dye (e.g., atto 565-biotin) at a 1:1,000 w/w ratio. Directly apply the dye after adding the MNP to the miR/PEI during the formation of the transfection complexes, per the details in Delyangina et al.16.\n2. Cell Preparation\nHUVEC isolation.\n\t\nIsolate cells from the umbilical cords directly after obtaining the cords using collagenase digestion from the interior of the cord vein; follow a previously developed protocol29.\n\t\t\nIncubate each cord with ~ 60 units/mL of collagenase type IV solution in buffer - loaded into the umbilical vein - at 37 °C for 13 min.\nFor all experiments, pool the HUVECs from a minimum of 5 patients.\n\t\tNOTE: Cultivation should not exceed 4-5 passages. Do not use cells contaminated with mycoplasma, as this causes a decrease in the transfection efficiency. Mycoplasma contamination should be tested for before starting the protocol by using a PCR kit for the highly sensitive detection of mycoplasmas.\n\t\t\nTest for mycoplasma presence.",
    "Centrifuge 1 mL of cell culture supernatant for 10 min (13,000 x g). Suspend the pellet in 17 µL of dH2O and boil (93 °C) for 3 min.

Transfection\nTrypsinize the stock HUVEC culture (see step 4.1.2.) and manually count the cells using a hemocytometer. Seed the HUVECs on plastic cell culture well plates of suitable size, with a starting cell density of approximately 13,000 cells/cm2 of growth surface, 48 h prior to transfection until 70-80% confluence is reached.\nPrepare fresh miR/PEI/MNP complexes every time.\n\tNOTE: First, miR/PEI complexes should be obtained (steps 3.2.1 - 3.2.3); subsequently, MNPs should be added to the miR/PEI solution (step 3.2.4) in order to get the final miR/PEI/MNP formulation used for transfection (step 3.3).",
    "Calculate the amount of appropriate commercially available miR (scrambled, tagged or functional, see step 4) using the concentration of the stock provided by the manufacturer. Use 2.5 pmol of miR/cm2 of cell growth surface. Dilute the miR in 5% glucose solution to obtain a final concentration of 0.125 pmol of miR/µL.\nBased on the miR amount from step 3.2.1 and the optimal NP ratio of 2532, calculate the required amount of PEI using its measured concentration (step 1.1.2).

Transfect the cells as described above in step 3.2 with non-labeled, non-functional miR (scr-miR) and incubate for 24 h.\nPrepare the cells for imaging by loading them with calcein directly before microscopy. In particular, replace the culture medium with fresh medium containing 5 µM calcein, incubate for 20 min, wash with PBS, and add fresh culture medium. Pre-warm the incubator of the microscope to 37 °C and adjust the CO2 concentration to 5%.\n\t\tNOTE: All the reagents should be warm to avoid cell contraction before measurement.\nUse a 561-nm excitation laser for cell visualization and the FRAP experiment. First, manually select cells for measurement as regions of interest (ROI); test cells should have at least 3 neighboring cells. Define a reference cell with bright, stable fluorescence that will not be bleached. Define the limits of a z-stack. Record the fluorescence from the top of the cells to the bottom to include 10 - 15 layers.",
    "Bleach the test cells using 100% laser power and record the subsequent fluorescence recovery (due to GJ-specific dye transfer from neighboring cells) during the following 15 min. Record the raw data in the z-stacks every 60 s. In total, perform the FRAP measurements with not less than 5 - 10 test cells per experiment. Compare the results to untransfected cells.\n5.

In parallel, examine the expression of the target gene (e.g., ITGA531).\n\t\tNOTE: AntagomiR delivery against endogenous miR is preferred over mimics since it ensures the measurement of the actual outcome of the miR and not merely its intracellular accumulation.\n6. Cell Targeting Evaluation and Magnetic Cell Separation\nCell targeting in static conditions in vitro.\nTransfect the HUVECs in a 24-well plate (2.5 pmol/cm2 scr-miR, NP 25, and 15-25 µg/mL MNP), incubate for 24 h, wash, and collect as described above (step 4).\nMix the cell pellet obtained from 1 well with 1 mL of fresh culture medium and place it in the wells of a 12-well plate.
