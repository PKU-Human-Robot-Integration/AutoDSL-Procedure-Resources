    "Autoclave all surgical instruments before surgery. Note that if one is performing multiple surgeries on different mice, rinse instruments after use and then sterilize using a hot bead sterilizer. It is not sufficient to soak in 70% ethanol.\nGive 0.5 ml S/C sterile normal saline preoperatively and immediately postoperatively to compensate for loss of body fluid during surgery.\nWeigh the mice.\nAnesthetize mouse using IP Xylazine/Ketamine mixture. It usually takes 3-5 min for the mice to reach surgical plane anesthesia.\nShave the surgical site with enough border area to keep hair from contaminating the incision site. This needs to be performed in a preparatory area, not where the surgery is performed.\nApply ophthalmic lubricating ointment to the eyes to prevent drying during the procedure.\nPlace the mouse prone on the heated surface covered with absorbent bench pad. Tape legs to the surgical surface.\nIf using the water bath system, set heat at 38 Â°C 1 hr prior to surgery.\nAseptic preparation using Betadine solution swab stick: scrub from the center of the site towards the periphery 3x, each time followed by scrubbing with Nolvasan to remove the Betadine. All Betadine should be removed from the surgical field prior to incision by rinsing with Nolvasan. Before starting aseptic procedure gloves should be changed to be sterile.\nCover surgical field with a sterile surgical drape. This will prevent stray hair from entering the surgical field and provide an area on which to lay sterile instruments during surgery.\nPalpate kidney location through the skin.\nCut the dorsal skin along the midline of mouse (approximately 1.5 cm) using scissors and forceps.\nSeparate skin and subcutaneous layers over the left and right dorsal sides through this incision by blunt dissection using scissors and forceps.",
    "Make a small incision through the right flank muscle and fascia above the kidney and exteriorize the right kidney.\nCarefully dissect the upper and lower poles of the kidney free from surrounding tissue. Note that fatty tissue from around the upper pole contains the adrenal gland carrying its own blood supply which can be pushed off the kidney but obviously should not be removed from the mouse (Figure 1). After liberating kidney from surrounding tissue, tie the 4-0 silk suture around the hilum of the right kidney using a double surgical knot. Leave one end of the suture ~2 in long to hold up the kidney as you are cutting distal to the knot so you can visualize the site to be cut. Irrigate the stump with sterile saline.\nClose the muscle layer by using absorbable suture.\nMake a small incision through the left flank muscle and fascia above the kidney and exteriorize the left kidney (Figure 2A).",
    "Carefully hold kidney using blunt forceps while releasing renal pedicle from surrounding fat tissue using forceps (Figures 2B-2F). Too much pressure on the kidney using the blunt forceps may cause renal injury so one needs to remember this when designing \"sham\" controls for the studies. If you find that your sham controls are developing renal injury (as evidenced by a rise in serum creatinine), an alternative method you may consider to release the surrounding fat tissue from the renal pedicle is to gently roll the tissues with saline soaked sterile cotton-tipped swabs. In our experience the fat is fairly tightly attached to the renal pedicle and cannot easily be removed with cotton swabs, so this may not be the first approach you would want to use. However, like other aspects of this model, this is something that you will have to establish for yourself with practice and experience.\nClamp left renal pedicle using non traumatic vascular clamp using holding forceps (to facilitate clamp placement), use timer for different clamp times depending on the mouse strain and injury severity required (see Table 1).\nCover the left kidney with the skin (Figure 2H).\nCover skin incision with saline soaked gauze.\nExteriorize kidney, confirm uniform dusky appearance and release the clamp after the indicated times, and confirm that dusky appearance reverses uniformly throughout the kidney (Figure 2I/G). If the kidney does not rapidly and uniformly re-perfuse (pink up) the mouse should be excluded from further analysis. Gently push kidney back into the retroperitoneal space.\nClose the muscle layer using absorbable suture.\nClose the skin layer using monofilament nylon non-absorbable suture.\nAdminister buprenorphine analgesia.\nTransfer mice away from the surgical field onto a heating pad until they wake.\nReturn the mice to animal room.",
    "Closely monitor the mice and give additional doses of buprenorphine as indicated above every 8-12 hr for pain or discomfort. Clinical signs resulting in administration of analgesics include depression or other behavioral changes, abnormal appearance, or posture such as pilo-erection, hunched posture, lack of grooming and eating, or immobility.\nSubscription Required.
