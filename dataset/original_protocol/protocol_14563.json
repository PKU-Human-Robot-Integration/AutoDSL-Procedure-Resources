    "The University Committee on Animal Research at the University of Rochester approved all animal experiments. Ten-12 week old female C57BL/6J mice were used.\n1. Preparation of Animals for Flexor Tendon Surgery (~15 min)\nAutoclave surgical instruments to sterilize, wear sterile gloves throughout, and maintain a sterile operating field.\nAnesthetize the mouse via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) with a volume of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) corresponding to body weight. Confirm depth of sedation via absence of toe-pinch reflex.\nAdminister pre-emptive analgesia (buprenorphine, 0.05-0.1 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection. Apply ophthalmic ointment to prevent eyes from drying out.\nPrepare the surgical site by clipping the fur on the entire hind limb. Sterilize the skin by scrubbing sequentially with povidone iodine, followed by 70% ethanol, and again with povidone iodine.\n2. Murine Flexor Tendon Injury and Repair Surgery (~10 min)\nFind the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon, seen superficially in the medial aspect of the calf. Using a scalpel, make a small 0.5-1 cm incision in the skin with micro-scissors to expose the tendon.\nUse forceps to separate the FDL tendon from surrounding tissue and trace it up to the myotendinous junction. Cut the tendon at this junction with spring scissors to release it, taking care to avoid the posterior tibial artery.\nClose the skin with 5-0 nylon sutures.\n\tNote: The FDL transection and repair (steps 2.4) should be performed using a stereomicroscope.\nMake a 3 mm incision over the posterolateral aspect of the hind paw using spring micro-scissors. Gently retract the surrounding soft tissue and muscle with forceps, making sure to minimize tissue damage, and identify the FDL tendon.",
    "Gently raise the FDL tendon and completely transect it using micro-scissors. Suture the ends of the FDL tendon together in a modified Kessler pattern with 8-0 sutures, avoiding drying of the tendon by periodically wetting it with saline.\nReplace soft tissue and muscle over the tendon, then close the incision with 5-0 nylon sutures.\nPlace mice on a slide warmer set to 37 °C, to maintain body temperature until recovered from anesthesia.\nMonitor mice post-operatively for signs of impairment or infection including increased vocalizing and ruffled fur. Inject buprenorphine (50 µl/mouse) as analgesic every 12 hr until mice no longer show signs of pain or distress.\nAllow mice to heal for a period of 10 days post-surgery before continuing to the next steps.\n\tNote: Cells can be harvested at any time-point post-surgery. Here, 10 days are chosen for these representative experiments given the relatively high cellularity of the tissue at this time.\n3. Labeling of Cycling Cells (~10 min)\nPrepare EdU (5-ethynyl-2'deoxyuridine) solution (10 mg/ml in sterile Phosphate buffered saline [PBS] + 1% Dimethyl Sulfoxide [DMSO] to increase solubility).\nInject mice with 100 µl EdU (50 mg/kg) via i.p. injection 24 hr prior to sacrifice.\n4. Harvest Cells for Cytology Centrifugation (2.5 hr, ~30 min Hands-on Time)\nPrepare 3 mg/ml collagenase I in PBS.\nEuthanize mouse via carbon dioxide asphyxiation at a flow rate of no more than 3 L/min, and perform cervical dislocation as a secondary measure.\nLocate the repaired tendon using step 2.4 above, and isolate tendon tissue by cutting about 2 mm on either side of the injury site with micro-scissors.",
    "Mince tissue with scalpel in a petri dish with 1 ml of 3 mg/ml collagenase, then pass mixture through an 18 G needle several times to break up the tissue. Collect mixture into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.\nDigest tendon tissue for 1 hour at 37 °C with shaking.\nSpin tissue down (300 x g for 5 min), aspirate collagenase, then resuspend cells/tissue with 500 µl 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS by pipetting up and down several times.\nFilter cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer to remove debris and large pieces of tendon, and set aside in a 37 °C incubator.\nPlace tendon tissue into another 1.5 ml centrifuge tube, and refresh with 1 ml collagenase solution, pipetting up and down to mix.\nIncubate tissue another hour at 37 °C with shaking.\nSpin down digested tendon tissue (300 x g for 5 min), then resuspend in 500 µl 3% BSA in PBS by pipetting up and down several times.\nFilter cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer, combine with suspension isolated in 4.3.3, then count cells with a hemocytometer.\nWash cells once more with 3% BSA in PBS, then resuspend to 3-6 x 104/100 µl.\nAttach a cytology funnel to a positively charged slide and lock into the slide carrier. Insert the entire apparatus into a cytology centrifuge and add 100 µl cell suspension to the funnel. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min to disperse the cells on to the slide.\n5. Immunocytochemistry to Detect EdU (2 hr, ~45 min Hands-on Time)\nNote: All incubation steps should be performed in the dark to limit photobleaching of fluorophores.",
    "Circle cells with a hydrophobic barrier pen to minimize solution needed for following steps, then immediately fix with 150 µl 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS 15 min at room temperature (RT).\n\t\nWash twice for 5 min with 150 µl 3% BSA in PBS.\nPermeabilize cells with 0.5% Triton-X 100 in PBS 20 min at RT.\nRepeat wash step as in 5.1.1.\nPrepare EdU reaction cocktail according to kit instructions not more than 30 min before use.\n\t\nAdd 150 µl cocktail to each slide, incubate 30 min at RT.\nRepeat wash step as in 5.1.1.\nIncubate with 150 µl nuclear counterstain Hoechst33342 diluted 1:2,000 in PBS 30 min at RT.\n\t\nWash twice for 5 min with 150 µl 1x PBS.\nAdd 1-2 drops anti-fade mounting medium to cells, then slowly lower coverslip to prevent bubbles.\n\t\nAllow mounting medium to cure overnight in the dark at RT.\nUse clear nail polish to seal the coverslip to the slide.\nImage slides at 40X magnification using a fluorescent microscope equipped with excitation/emission filters capable of detecting DAPI (Hoeschst33342), and Texas Red (Alexa Fluor 594).\nSubscription Required.
