    "This study was approved by the University of Iowa's Institutional Review Board and adheres to the tenets set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Foveal and Macular Biopsy Punch\nOpen and butterfly the human eye, such that it consists of 4 separate flaps of tissue, as described in a previous publication.5\nBeginning with a butterflied human eye placed in a Petri dish, center a 4-mm punch biopsy tool over the fovea, press down, and roll gently until an incision is made around the fovea.\nNext, generate an incision around the macula by centering and pressing down an 8-mm skin punch biopsy tool within the arcades of the macula, applying gentle pressure and rolling. This will produce a second, outer ring of tissue surrounding the first.\n2. Peripheral Retinal Biopsy Punch\nUse the 4-mm skin punch biopsy tool to make a series of punches in the peripheral retina, just outside the arcade. Here, make two punches for each quadrant flap.\n\tNOTE: After all the punches are made, the eye will have two concentric punches in the center, representing the fovea and macula, and two punches at the base of each flap-totaling 8 punches in the peripheral retina.\n3. Fovea and Macula Biopsy Collection\nAs the tissue is now ready for collection, collect all tissue biopsies in separate microfuge tubes and freeze using liquid nitrogen for downstream processing. Store all samples at -80 °C until utilization.\nUse a curved 0.12 Colibri forceps to grab the edges of the translucent tissue of the retinal fovea. To collect, elevate and separate the foveal tissue from the underlying RPE-choroid.",
    "Similarly, use the 0.12 Colibri forceps to grasp the outer ring of the translucent macula tissue. If the tissue is still attached to underlying or adjacent tissue, use a pair of Westcott scissors to carefully trim the edge, capturing just the retinal component and dissecting away any optic nerve tissue included in the punch.\n4. Peripheral Retina Collection\nUse the curved 0.12 Colibri forceps to gently separate the peripheral retinal tissue discs from the underlying RPE-choroid and place within individual microfuge tubes.\nIn the case of residual vitreous gel, use the forceps to lift and separate the gel away as much as possible before collection of the retinal tissue. Once the retina has been removed, the pigmented RPE-choroid remains below.\n5. Foveal and Macula RPE-Choroid Collection\nUse the 0.12 Colibri forceps to grasp the edges of the dark RPE-choroid tissue that lies beneath the area of the removed fovea. Carefully separate this tissue from the sclera and collect.\nUsing the same forceps, grasp the edges of the outer ring of dark RPE-choroid tissue underlying the removed macular area. Carefully separate this tissue from the sclera by grasping the edges at different points around the ring and lightly pulling. Eventually, the ring of RPE-choroid tissue will be dislodged and may be collected.\n\tNOTE: Secondary forceps in the opposite hand can be helpful in manipulating the RPE-choroid tissue during removal. Like the retinal tissue, Wescott scissors can be used to assist in removing any tissue that was not fully incised using the punch tool.\n6. Peripheral Retina RPE-Choroid Collection\nUse the 0.12 Colibri forceps to peel away the RPE-choroid in the 8 peripheral punch areas.\nAs previously, place the RPE-choroid tissue in microfuge tubes and freeze using liquid nitrogen for downstream processing. Keep all samples at -80 °C until utilization.",
    "7. Scissor Dissection\nNOTE: If the punch biopsy blade is dull or the punch biopsy tool is not pushed hard enough, there may not be a clean-cut surrounding the tissue.\nIn these cases, pull the tissue away as much as possible, and then use Westcott scissors to trim and separate.\nSubscription Required.
