    "Preparation of CRISPR plasmid (for a diagrammatic overview of the cloning process, see Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327032811_5965.jpgFigure 1. Overview of the CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA expression vector construction process. In the first step Xs and Ys represent the gRNA sequence selected, and BsmBI recognition site is indicated in bold.Design two guide RNA (gRNA) sequences targeting the open reading frame (ORF) for the yeast gene to be replaced using Geneious, or a similar tool such as E-CRISP (Heigwer et al., 2014).gRNA sequences can often have low activity in practice, despite being predicted to be highly efficient by software tools. In order to minimize setbacks due to a gRNA which turns out to function poorly, we advise designing multiple gRNAs from the outset, and taking them through the cloning steps in parallel, up to and including the construction of the CRISPR plasmids. Both plasmids should then be tested for their ability to target the yeast genome and kill cells (described in later steps) to empirically determine and confirm their activity.We have not noticed a strong effect of the location of the gRNA within the ORF. During homologous repair, DNA can be resected up to several kilobases from the break site (Mimitou and Symington, 2009; Chen et al., 2011), so the gRNA need not be very close to either terminus of the ORF. It is however important to select a gRNA such that the target site is not present after replacement (i.e., the gRNA should target the yeast ORF, but not the replacement gene).Example: For targeting HEM2, the sequences GGATTATCGGAGATGAATAG (‘sg1’, on the non-coding strand) and CCTGGTACCAAGGATCCAGT (‘sg2’, on the coding strand) were predicted to have high activity (see Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313223547_3294.pngFigure 2.",
    "Diagram of the native yeast HEM2 locus, showing positions of the example guide RNAs sg1 and sg2Order forward and reverse oligonucleotides with the gRNA sequence and Golden Gate compatible overlaps:Forward oligo consists of the 5’ insert GACTTT followed by the 20 bp guide sequence specific to the target gene. Example forward oligo for HEM2 sg1 (underline indicates 5’ Golden Gate overhang): GACTTTGGATTATCGGAGATGAATAG.Reverse oligo consists of the 3’ insert AAAC, followed by the reverse complement of the 20 bp guide sequence, followed by AA, which complements part of the GACTTT insert on the forward oligo. Example reverse oligo for HEM2 sg1 (underline indicates 3’ Golden Gate overhang): AAACCTATTCATCTCCGATAATCCAA.Mix forward and reverse oligos (50 µM each) for each gRNA in a total volume of 20 µl and anneal with each other using a thermocycler with the program below. It is unnecessary to phosphorylate the insert.95 °C for 5 min55 °C for 15 min25 °C for 15 minFirst Golden Gate cloning reaction to transfer into shuttle vector: Set up cloning reaction with annealed oligos and pYTK050 (Table 1).A 2:1 molar ratio of insert:plasmid is recommended for optimal Golden Gate cloning of linear DNA.Table 1. Golden Gate reaction for cloning into shuttle vectorimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313223746_8924.jpgTransform the reaction into competent bacteria and plate with chloramphenicol selection (170 µg/ml). View colonies under UV light and pick the white colonies (those not showing GFP fluorescence), then grow in liquid culture and purify plasmid. The vectors used in Golden Gate reactions described in this protocol are all GFP-dropout vectors: They contain a GFP gene which will be silenced upon successful cloning. Therefore, GFP fluorescence indicates an invalid construct, while successful constructs will lose the GFP gene and the resulting colonies will be white.",
    "Optionally, the plasmid can be sequenced to check for errors or mutations in the gRNA sequence, such as may occur during synthesis.Second Golden Gate cloning reaction to create gRNA cassette plasmid: Set up cloning reaction which includes connector plasmids ConL1 and ConRE (Table 2).For best efficiency, all plasmids should be present at the same molarity in plasmid-based Golden Gate assemblies.Table 2. Golden Gate reaction for making Cas9 and gRNA transcription unit/cassette plasmids with appropriate connectorsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327033309_6569.jpgTransform the reaction into competent bacteria and plate with ampicillin selection (60 µg/ml). View colonies under UV light and pick the white colonies (those not showing GFP fluorescence), then grow in liquid culture and purify plasmid.Third and final Golden Gate cloning reaction to construct the yeast-compatible, complete CRISPR plasmid: Set up Golden Gate cloning reaction with connector plasmid from the previous step, and yeast –Ura backbone plasmid, and Cas9 plasmid (Table 3).Table 3. Golden Gate reaction for making Cas9 and gRNA yeast expression vectorimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327033349_6761.jpg*Cen6-Ura is constructed by assembling YTK plasmids (008, 047, 073, 074, 081, and 084).Transform the reaction into competent bacteria and plate with kanamycin selection (50 µg/ml). View colonies under UV light and pick the white colonies (those not showing GFP fluorescence), then grow in liquid culture and purify plasmid.The resulting construct is a self-contained CRISPR plasmid, which when transformed into yeast will cause double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at the locus determined by the gRNA sequence cloned into it. 500 ng of this will be used for each yeast transformation, so if multiple replacements are planned, it is helpful to dilute the CRISPR plasmid to a standardized concentration for easier transformation set up later on.Preparation of repair template DNADesign the template DNA using Geneious or any other cloning software.",
    "Obtain the genomic sequence of the target yeast gene (‘old gene’), and the coding sequence (CDS) of the replacing gene (‘new gene’). The CDS should not contain introns. Create a gene model for the replaced locus by editing the sequence of the old gene so that it contains the new gene in the correct position (i.e., the desired outcome of replacement).We find that replacement works best if the original yeast stop codon is left intact. Otherwise, modifying the new gene, for instance to codon optimize for yeast, has proven unnecessary.Design template PCR primers which anneal to about 25 bp of the 5’ and 3’ ends of the new gene’s CDS, and also the 5’ and 3’ UTR immediately adjacent to the ORF (the homology arms). Figure 3 shows an example of primer design for replacing the yeast HEM2 gene with its human ortholog ALAD. This process is much easier using the gene model constructed in the previous step: The sequence covering the junction points between yeast genome and the new gene CDS can be used directly as primer sequence.The length of the region complementary to the new gene CDS is determined only by standard PCR efficiency concerns, such as melting temperature. This area will serve as a toehold for the first few cycles of the PCR.The length of the homology arms is critical for efficient replacement. We find that homologies of at least 70 bp are necessary (in which case the entire primer oligo will be about 90 bp long), and for some genes, 170 bp homologies may be necessary. For even more difficult replacements, longer homology arms can be cloned separately, but we have found that homologies longer than 500 bp are unlikely to increase efficiency further.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313224255_4082.pngFigure 3.",
    "Diagrams of example template primer designs for the replacement of HEM2 with hsALADUse template PCR primers to amplify a large amount of repair template DNA using a high-fidelity polymerase.We find that it is helpful to first conduct several test PCRs with different polymerases. Due to the particular design of the template primers, this PCR can sometimes run inefficiently or generate unwanted non-specific products. Different polymerases have different characteristics, and often a reaction which fails with one polymerase will run efficiently with another, rendering laborious PCR optimization unnecessary.At least 5 µg of template DNA is needed per yeast transformation, which can usually be obtained from a single 50 µl PCR. Difficult replacements can often be facilitated by using more (10 µg) template DNA, and if multiple transformations are to be performed the amount will also need to be scaled up accordingly. Often several PCRs are necessary to produce enough DNA.If very large amounts of template DNA are needed, or an efficient PCR is difficult to set up, an alternative method is to clone the template sequence onto a plasmid, which can be amplified in bacteria with the template DNA excised using restriction enzymes.Check the template PCR with agarose gel electrophoresis.As long as a sufficient amount of the correct template is produced, non-specific products do not necessarily constitute a problem for the replacement. Because the non-specific products usually lack appropriate homologies, they will not be efficiently integrated into the yeast genome. However, if significant amounts of them are present, they will cause over-estimation of template DNA during spectrophotometry-based quantification; thus the amount of template DNA used in the transformation would need to be adjusted accordingly.",
    "Alternatively, the PCR can be optimized to reduce non-specific products, or only the correct product can be quantified from the gel using a DNA ladder calibrated for quantity estimation.Purify template PCR using the Zymo DNA Clean&Concentrator-25 kit. Elute in double distilled water.Ideally, the volume of DNA included in yeast transformation should be small, so as to not interfere with the transformation reagents. The elution volume should be adjusted accordingly so that the resulting concentration of DNA is not too low. In our experiments, we have found that eluting with 25 µl double distilled water will usually yield 400-800 ng/µl DNA, which is suitable for transformations.Yeast transformationPrepare competent yeast cells using the Zymo EZ competent yeast kit according to the kit instructions.The EZ 1 solution in this kit can be substituted with 100 mM lithium acetate without significant change in transformation efficiency.The amounts given in the kit manual can be slightly modified: 2 ml yeast culture can be used to produce 100 µl of competent yeast, which is sufficient for two transformations, 50 µl each.Set up a transformation reaction: Mix 50 µl competent yeast, 500 µl EZ 3 solution, 500 ng of CRISPR plasmid and 5 µg repair template DNA (up to 50 µl total volume). Incubate at 30 °C as directed by kit manual and plate on –Ura medium.When using a new gRNA for the first time, gRNA efficiency can be estimated with a control transformation, which is performed as stated but without repair DNA. When the CRISPR plasmid is introduced without a repair template, it will repeatedly cleave the target locus, causing toxicity. Very few or no colonies are the ideal outcome, since this indicates highly efficient CRISPR cleavage and low background rate.",
    "Cells can survive the CRISPR plasmid uptake without repair DNA if the CRISPR activity is stochastically low (such as due to poor gRNA efficiency) or mutations at the CRISPR target locus can be tolerated (which produces false transformants even in presence of the repair template).When colonies appear on the –Ura plates, collect up to 12 of them with a pipette tip and suspend in 50 µl water. These suspensions will be screened for confirmed replacements. Yeast suspensions can be stored at 4 °C and used to start new cultures for up to 2 weeks.Typically, colonies will appear on –Ura plates (Figure 4) after 1-3 days. In some cases, the replacement will impose a significant fitness defect such that up to 6 days may be required for colonies to appear, but we have not encountered cases where colonies from a successful transformation take longer than 6 days to grow.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313224456_1766.pngFigure 4. Representative assay results. Yeast cells are rescued from DSB lethality (center plate) when an appropriate repair template is provided (right plate). The left plate is a negative control of cells carrying a control plasmid with the same selectable marker (URA3) done to estimate the transformation efficiency of the yeast strains being used.The uracil dropout medium will select against cells which failed to take up the CRISPR plasmid (which confers uracil prototrophy), but because the CRISPR plasmid is toxic to cells unless a successful replacement occurs (eliminating the CRISPR target locus) only cells which have a replaced locus are expected to survive. However, due to spontaneous hypoactivity of the CRISPR system, mutations in the CRISPR target locus (DiCarlo et al., 2013), and cells which manage to survive CRISPR-associated DSBs, there will be a background rate in the form of false transformant colonies which do not carry the correct genomic replacements.",
    "To save time, we recommend collecting several transformant colonies and screening them in parallel.To streamline this process (especially when several replacements are performed in parallel), pick colonies with pipette tips and manually attach them to a multichannel pipette (Figure 5). The multichannel pipette can then be used to suspend all 12 samples in one row of small PCR tubes or a 96-well plate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180313/20180313224541_1345.jpgFigure 5. Demonstration of colony picking technique with 12-channel pipetteColony screening via PCRDesign confirmation PCR primers: Primer pairs should be selected such that the forward primer anneals to the yeast UTR while the reverse primer anneals only to the new gene CDS but not the old gene’s ORF. Thus, the product should span the junction point between foreign sequence and native yeast genome. The yeast UTR primer should preferably not overlap the homology region.Ideally, the product size should be small, about 300 bp, for a faster and more robust PCR.It is sufficient to check only the 5’ junction point, since it is rare for integration to proceed as expected at one end of the gene but introduce artifacts at the other.If desired, the absence of the yeast ORF can also be tested by using a reverse primer which anneals to yeast ORF only. However, lack of product from such a primer pair is not sufficient to confirm a clone, since the reaction is liable to fail for unrelated reasons (such as poor lysis of cells).Prepare lysates of harvested transformants: Mix 5 µl of each yeast suspension with 15 µl zymolyase solution.Incubate lysates for 30 min at room temperature, then 15 min at 37 °C and 5 min at 95 °C.Set up 20 µl colony PCRs with confirmation primers and using Accuprime Pfx as the polymerase. Use 1 µl of the lysate as template DNA.",
    "We find that other polymerases do not perform well due to impurities from the yeast lysates.Due to the impurities introduced by the lysate, the colony PCR may spontaneously fail, leading to false negatives. To ameliorate this problem, a positive control PCR can be performed for each lysate, which is identical to the confirmation PCR but uses primers complementary to an unrelated, unmodified locus in the genome. We use two primers targeting a 500 bp segment of the yeast ERG13 promoter for this purpose (forward CGAACTGGATGAGATGGCCG and reverse CATGCTGCACCTTTTATAGTAATTTGGC).Check the colony PCRs for product by agarose electrophoresis. Lysates from clones with the correct modifications should generate a product with the confirmation primers. Background false transformants (e.g., mutants) will not produce a band.A PCR product from the confirmation primers is sufficient evidence of successful integration of the repair template. For further verification, the locus can be sequenced, but we have found that dramatic sequence artifacts rarely occur in clones confirmed by PCR, the most common mutations are single-basepair substitutions or indels, which typically constitute a minority of confirmed clones.Lack of product from the confirmation primers is inconclusive per se. In such cases, it is worthwhile to consider additional evidence, such as whether the positive control PCR worked (if not, the lysis may have failed).Confirmed clones can be propagated by starting a new culture from the original suspensions of yeast in water.Curing of the CRISPR plasmidStreak original water suspensions of confirmed clones on YPD.The CRISPR plasmid is low copy and can be spontaneously lost in absence of selection.Pick 10 colonies from the YPD plate and patch each one on YPD and SD-Ura plates.Incubate both plates, and collect cells from patches which grew only on YPD but not on SD-Ura.",
    "Isolates which still carry the CRISPR plasmid will grow on uracil dropout medium, but those which have lost the plasmid will not. Typically, 3 days is sufficient to confirm lack of Ura prototrophy, but if slow growth on uracil dropout is suspected, incubation can be extended to up to 6 days to definitively confirm no growth on uracil dropout.The plasmid can also be cured by counterselecting on 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) plates (Boeke et al., 1987). However, there is a possibility that this FOA method will generate some colonies that are not cured of the plasmid but rather have acquired a mutation in the Ura marker (thus continuing to express the gRNA). Thus, FOA counterselection should not be used (as opposed to replicate patches on YPD and –Ura) if it is important to ensure curing of the plasmid, rather than simply abrogating Ura prototrophy. On the other hand, the FOA method can save time if only loss of –Ura heterotrophy is desired, for instance to enable a subsequent transformation with a different Ura-selectable plasmid."
