For in vivo lineage tracing of BMI1+\n        CSCs and their progenies, mice are injected with tamoxifen\n        intraperitoneally at a dose of 225 mg per 1 kg body weight\n        2–6 weeks before ending the experiments.\n      \n        To label proliferating tumor cells, mice bearing HNSCC are first\n        injected intraperitoneally with EdU at a dose of 25 μg/g body weight\n        after reaching the experimental endpoint.\n      \n        90 min after EdU injection, mice are then euthanized using CO2\n        asphyxiation.\n      \n        Use the needles to pin the mouse limbs to the dissection board to secure\n        the body. Spray the body with 70% ethanol.\n      \n        Use forceps to grab the skin and cut a long incision through the midline\n        from the chin to the upper chest region of the mouse using scissors.\n      \n        Gently insert scissors under the skin to separate the skin from the\n        underlying tissues.\n      \n        Once the skin is fully detached, cut and open the skin laterally at the\n        chest level and pin the skin with needles to expose the cervical lymph\n        nodes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/604-Fig2.jpg\n              Figure 2.

    "After collecting all the lymph nodes, cut the joints on both sides of\n        the jaws with a bone scissor. Open the jaws as wide as possible to\n        expose the tongue tissues (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Cut the whole\n        tongue using a sharp scissor.\n      \n        Take photos of the tongue using the Leica EZ4 Stereo Microscope with a\n        ruler (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n      \n        Put the tongue in the 4% PFA tube mentioned above (The tissue can be\n        kept in 4% PFA up to 72 h before over-fixation).\n      \n        After 24 h, remove PFA and wash the tongue and lymph nodes three times\n        with PBS for 30 min at 22°C–25°C. Cut the tongue into halves\n        sagittally along the mid-line of the HNSCC lesion. Keep half of the\n        lesion for paraffin section and the other half for cryosection.\n      \nCryo-section and immunostaining\nTiming: 1–2 days\n        Discard PBS and pour in 10 mL of 30% sucrose solution in PBS into the\n        15 mL tube. Keep the tissue at 4°C for 48 h until the tissue sinks in\n        the solution.\n      \n        Embed the tissue in pre-chilled optimal cutting temperature (OCT)\n        compound in an appropriate embedding mold. Freeze on dry ice and store\n        tissue at −80°C until sectioning.\n      \n        Cut the cytosections at a thickness of 8–10 μm using a Leica\n        cryostat and collect the sections with Superfrost Slides (Fisher\n        Scientific Cat#12-550-15).\n      \nLet the slides dry for 5 min at 22°C–25°C.\n        Fix in 4% PFA for 10 min in a humidified chamber, 200 μL/sample, and\n        spread with a new pipette tip (operate in the chemical hood).\n      \nWash the slides in PBS for 5 min three times.\n        Make blocking buffer (5% Normal Donkey Serum, 1% bovine serum albumin,\n        0.2% Triton X-100 in 1 × PBS).\n      \n        Trace around the sections with a pap pen and add 200–400 μL block\n        buffer per slide.",
    "Block in a humidified chamber for 30 min at 22°C–25°C.\n        Decant block buffer and add anti-pan-cytokeratin antibodies (1:500,\n        Santa Cruz, Cat#sc-8018) or anti-keratin 5 (1:500; BioLegend,\n        Cat#905501) diluted in block buffer to each slide (200 μL per slide) and\n        cover with a plastic coverslip. Because some hematopoietic cells in\n        lymph nodes express BMI1, the sections of cervical lymph nodes need to\n        be stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibodies to confirm that BMI1+\n        CSCs are metastatic tumor cells.\n      \nIncubate at 40C in a humidified chamber.\n        The next day, lift off the coverslip by dipping in PBS until coverslip\n        slips off the slide on its own\n      \n        Place slide into a Coplin jar with 1 × PBS/0.1% Triton x-100 (PBS-T).\n        Wash for 5 min.\n      \nRepeat this wash 2 more times.\n        Dilute secondary antibodies in PBS-T 1:200 and add 200–300 μL per\n        slide (no coverslip) and incubate at 22°C–25°C in humidified\n        chamber for 45 min.\n      \n        Wash in PBS-T (in a Coplin jar) 3 times (5 min per wash) and then 2\n        times in PBS (no Triton)\n      \n        Dip slide in ddH20 and then add 1–2 drops of\n        Vectashield with DAPI (#H-1200-10, Vector Laboratories) and carefully\n        place glass coverslip over while avoiding trapping bubbles under the\n        slide.\n      \nFix slide with nail polish around the coverslip.\n        Acquire the images with a fluorescent microscopy running CellSens\n        software (Olympus\n        http://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/software/cellsens/[href=http://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/software/cellsens/]).\n      \nParaffin section and H&E staining\nTiming: 2–3 days\n        Transfer tissue to 70% ethanol for fixation for 14–16 h at\n        22°C–25°C.\n      \nTransfer tissue to 80% ethanol for 30 min at 22°C–25°C.\nTransfer tissue to 95% ethanol for 30 min at 22°C–25°C.\n        Transfer tissue to 100% ethanol for 30 min at 22°C–25°C.

    "After incubation, transfer tissue into a labeled cassette – you can\n        leave this indefinitely until ready to embed into molds.\n      \nEmbed and label accordingly.\n        Cut the paraffin section at a thickness of 5 μm using a Leica RM2235\n        manual microtome and collect the sections with Superfrost Slides (Fisher\n        Scientific Cat#12-550-15).\n      \n        Deparaffinize the sections in Histoclear II for 3 min at\n        22°C–25°C.
