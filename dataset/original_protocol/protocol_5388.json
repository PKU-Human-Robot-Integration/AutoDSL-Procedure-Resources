    "Generation of mito-eYFP DAT-tTA miceThe mito-eYFP DAT-tTA mice are generated by crossing mice harboring one allele of the dopamine transporter promoter-driven tetracycline-transactivator with mice harboring one allele of the CMV-tetracycline response element driven mitochondrial-targeted eYFP. We genotyped the offspring following Jackson laboratory protocols and primer sequences. In this study, we used 4 months old males but we do not foresee limitations in using different ages and both males and females. Mice were continuously fed with normal food (no DOX). Because DAT is a protein specifically expressed by dopaminergic neurons, mice expressed eYFP exclusively in the mitochondria of dopaminergic neurons (Figure 1). Mice were sacrificed at 4 months.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191612_7241.jpgFigure 1. Breeding strategy to express mito-eYFP specifically in dopaminergic neurons. This system involves the induction of mito-eYFP expression when tetracycline/doxycycline are removed from the diet of the double-transgenic mice.Transcardial perfusion and whole brain fixation (Gage et al., 2012)Anesthetize Mito-eYFP DAT-tTA mice with an intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine (90-120 mg/kg) and Xylazine (5-10 mg/kg) mixed together starting from lower dose (90 mg/kg of Ketamine and 5 mg/kg of Xylazine). If the mouse is still responsive after 5 min, increase the dose (usually until 120 mg/kg of Ketamine and 10 mg/kg of Xylazine). Check that the mice no longer exhibit reflex movement (pinch the paws and tail with a tweezer until it does not react to the stimulus) and place them on their back. Spray 70% ethanol on the fur to prevent it from sticking to the exposed tissues or the tools.Using blunt scissors, cut open the abdomen, identify the diaphragm, pinch it until the lungs collapse. Cut the diaphragm and the rib cage exposing the heart.Holding the heart with forceps, insert a 23 G needle perfusing ice-cold PBS into the left ventricle and snip the right atrium using small, sharp scissors.",
    "The PBS perfusion continues at 7 ml/minute for at least 5 min, until the liver appears clear from blood.Switch the perfusion solution to ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS (Twenty milliliter per mouse or until the mouse is properly perfused and the body is mostly rigid).Open the skull using scissors and forceps, and carefully remove the brain using a metal spatula.Substantia nigra is located in the midbrain. To isolate the midbrain section containing the substantia nigra, position the mouse brain on the matrix and with two single edge razor blades, cut the brain at Bregma 0 mm and Bregma -0.5 mm (coronal direction). Incubate the midbrain section in 4% PFA in PBS overnight at 4 °C.Brain slices preparationGlue the PFA-fixed brain (Bregma 0 mm) to the plate of the vibratome (Leica VT1000 S) and submerge the brain in ice-cold PBS. Cut 50 μm thick coronal brain sections. The slices will float in the PBS, so with a small brush they can be fished and collected. Cut slices approximately from Bregma -2.46 mm to Bregma -4.04 mm (total of about 30 slices).The settings for Leica VT1000 S vibratome are as follows:Speed set 3 Note: Max speed set on Leica VT1000 S vibratome is 10. Frequency set 7Note: Max frequency set on Leica VT1000 S vibratome is 10. Note: Any cutting technique can be used (different vibratome, different embedding technique) as long as the slices’ thickness is 50 μm and the brains do not go through a freezing process. Collect three slices per well into a 24-well plate containing PBS + Sodium azide (0.02% w/v). For the counting, analyze one slice per well for a total of 10 slices per mouse.If you choose to perform immunohistochemistry on slices, it can be done at this stage.",
    "Otherwise, using a small brush, carefully transfer slices on a glass slide, put 20 μl of a hard-set fluorescent mounting media on the slice, and cover the slice with a glass coverslip.Notes: Counterstaining slices with an anti-TH antibody can be done to confirm the specificity of the mito-eYFP DAT-tTA expression. Slices can be stored at 4 °C in PBS protected from light, although we suggest not to exceed 14 days before the analysis as the EYFP fluorescence intensity might decrease over time. Imaging of brain slicesFrom the 10 mounted slices, choose 5 with the clearer staining (enough and distinguishable neurites). Using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope, LSM 710, Observer Z1), and associated ZEN software package (ZEN 2010B SP1, Version 6,0,0,485, Configuration 5.00.01) take Z-Stack images from the midbrain region at 20x magnification. Take each Z-Stack using a minimum of 10 steps. Save files with a “.lsm” extension for image analysis. Use the same settings (pinhole, intensity, contrast) for all the Z-stacks.In our study, the settings used for image acquisition on the Zeiss LSM 710 were: Laser: Type Argon, Excitation 480-515 nm, Emission 500-545 nm, Power 5.00, Gain 700, Digital Offset 0.0, Digital Gain 1.0Image Size: 1024 x 1024 pixelsPinhole: 89.9 μmExposure Time: Pixel Dwell 50.42 μsec, Scan Time 1 min 2 secQuantification of mitochondrial size and neurite lengthQuantification is done using FIJI Software Package, and Figures 2-9 show step by step image processing in the immunofluorescent images leading to the quantification of mitochondrial size and neurite length.Open .lsm files with the FIJI Software package.OPTIONAL (if immunohistochemistry has been performed with additional channels). To separate the channels and only keep the Mito-eYFP information, click on the “Image” drop-down menu: Color → Split channels → Close all channels except for the mito-eYFP channel (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191641_7845.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Retention of mito-eYFP channelTo flatten the Z-Stack and create a maximum intensity image, click on the “Image” drop-down menu: Stacks → Z Project → Max Intensity (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191703_9348.jpgFigure 3. Maximum projection of Z-stack To convert the image to an 8-bit image for analysis, click on the “Image” drop-down menu: Type → 8 bit (Figure 4). Note: Converting to the image to binary instead of 8-bit would create too much background.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191726_3689.jpgFigure 4. Conversion to 8-bit type To invert the colors of the image, click on the “Edit” drop-down menu: Invert (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191743_8432.jpgFigure 5. Inverting channel colors To better separate the background from the actual image in order to see the full neurite but not oversaturate the pixel intensity, the image threshold must be adjusted. In 8 bit greyscale images, there are 256 (28) intensity graduations which can be assigned to a pixel. A pixel with an intensity of 0 is black, a pixel with a value of 255 is white, everything in between is a shade of grey. To set the threshold for image analysis, click on the “Image” drop-down menu: click on “Adjust” and go to “Threshold” (Step 1 in Figure 6). In the window that will appear, the histogram represents the distribution of pixel intensities in the image, from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Set the threshold from 0 to ~240, and the pixels in the image which fall in the selected range will be highlighted in red (Step 2 in Figure 6). When satisfied with the choice of the threshold, click “Apply” (Step 3 in Figure 6). Notes: Between 230 and 256 there will be the light grey and white pixels belonging to the background.",
    "The setting of the threshold will be image specific, but between images taken with the same parameters (pinhole, contrast, intensity), we experienced differences in maximum 5 intensity graduations. If the threshold is set too high, red pixels will appear in the background, in that case, decrease the threshold until pixels in the neurites and in the cell body will be highlighted in red. The transgenic mouse used for this protocol has been extensively studied and the specificity of mitochondrial localization has been previously assessed (Chandrasekaran et al., 2006). Therefore we considered mitochondria every particle localized in the neurite that has a pixel value >1 and < of the threshold indicated.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191817_2189.jpgFigure 6. Adjusting channel threshold to see the axons and neurites better To analyze the mitochondria in a neurite, select “Freehand Selection” and trace the entire length of the neurite to be analyzed. When tracing the neurite to be analyzed, the line does not need to be “tight” along the neurite, but must not include mitochondria from other neurites (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191848_0281.jpgFigure 7. Freehand selection to trace axons/neurites for analyses To analyze the mitochondria in the selected neurite, click on the “Analyze” drop-down menu: Analyze particles → Set from “1 to Infinity” → Check “Display results” Click OK → Copy the first two columns of the results to Excel (Figure 8).Note: The typical size of mitochondria is very dependent on the cell type/compartment analyzed. With our microscope settings and image size, the mean size for mitochondria is 4.1 ± 0.8 pixels (1.95 μm2), matching what is commonly reported across species (0.75 to 3 μm2) (Bereiter-Hahn et al., 1990; Wiemerslage and Lee, 2016; Xu et al., 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191905_3123.jpgFigure 8.",
    "Analyses of the individual mitochondrial area in selected axon/neurite To find the total length of the chosen neurite, click on the “Plugins” drop-down menu: Segmentation → Simple Neurite Tracer → Click on start of neurite → Proceed to extend the neurite path, clicking yes (y) if the segment, or no (n) if the segment is not correct (if for example the program traces a neurite different than the chosen one) → When finished withdrawing neurite length, click finish (f) → Copy neurite length data to Excel (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180812/20180812191924_2235.jpgFigure 9.
