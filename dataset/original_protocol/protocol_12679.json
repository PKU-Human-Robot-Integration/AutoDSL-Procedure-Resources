    "1. Preparation of surface-functionalized coverslips\nCleaning\nPlace five coverslips (24 mm x 60 mm) in ethanol inside a Coplin jar. Sonicate in ethanol then in 1 M potassium hydroxide for 30 min for 3x. Wash in acetone 3x then decant.\nSilanization\nPrepare a solution of 2.8% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in acetone. Seal the APTES bottle with a paraffin film and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Use safety goggles and work under a fume hood. The container of the silane solution should be completely dry and rinsed by acetone immediately before and after pouring the silane solution into the jar.\nPour 70 mL of the 2.8% APTES solution into the Coplin jar containing the coverslips. Shake the jar for 4 min in an orbital shaker.\nLet the jar stand on the bench for 5 min, sonicate for 1 min, and finally keep the jar on the bench for another 10 min for the silane to react with the hydroxyl groups on the glass surface.\nQuench the reaction by the addition of 1 L of deionized water by pouring water directly into the jar for rapid solvent exchange. Rinse the slides 3x in water by sideways shaking of the jar on a flat surface.\nTake the coverslips out of the jar and place them onto an aluminum foil tray. Bake the coverslips in an oven at 110 °C for 30 min to dry the coverslips and cure the silane. Leave the tray on the bench for the coverslips to cool down to room temperature.\nPEGylation\nWarm up the biotinylated PEG and PEG, stored at -20 °C to room temperature (RT) to prevent the condensation of moisture upon opening the container.",
    "Place five coverslips with the silanized surface facing up on a box. Place two cover glass slips (22 mm x 22 mm) as spacers along the edges of the silanized coverslips.\nOnce warmed up, make biotinylated PEG and PEG solutions at a ratio of ~1:100 in 1 mL of fresh, 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate solution by adding 1.5 mg of biotinylated PEG and 150 mg of PEG into a 1.5 mL tube.\nVortex the tube to dissolve PEG and spin down to remove air bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: Going forward from this step, be quick, because PEG hydrolyzes in solution within a timescale of min.\nQuickly apply 100 µL of the PEG solution to each coverslip. Take another baked coverslip and place its upper silanized surface face-down on top of the coverslip with the PEG solution, hence forming a glass-solution-glass sandwich in which the 22 mm x 22 mm non-silanized coverslips allow the two functionalized coverslips to be separated easily.\nIncubate the coverslips overnight (16 h) in the dark and at RT. Once the incubation is complete, take the coverslips apart, then rinse 10x using deionized water by washing from the side with a squirt bottle.\nDry the coverslips under a flow of dry nitrogen. Store the dry coverslips under vacuum.\n\t\tNOTE: The slides can be used for 1 month without degradation of quality.\n2. Preparation of flow cell\nSingle-channel flow cell\nDrill two holes with 1.22 mm diameter in the middle part of a quartz slide (50 mm x 20 mm) with the centers situated 37 mm apart and 6.5 mm from the edge of the slide (Figure 1A).\nCut out a 41 mm x 2.25 mm channel into a 50 mm x 20 mm piece of a double-adhesive sheet using an electronic cutter.",
    "Peel off the plastic side of the protective cover and align the edges of the piece with the edges of the quartz slide. Remove trapped air bubbles by pressing gently with a pair of polytetrafluoroethylene tweezers.\nPeel off the paper side of the adhesive piece. Mount the piece onto the functionalized surface of the coverslip.\nCut polyethylene tubing (I.D. 1.22 mm) into a length of 11 cm for the inlet and 25 cm for the outlet. Insert the tube into the previously drilled holes as inlet and outlet for the flow cell.\nUse 5 min epoxy glue to seal around the edges of the quartz-coverslip interface and around the tubes for the inlet and outlet.\nUse the flow cell immediately once it dries or store under dry vacuum for later use.\nDissolve avidin in PBS to a concentration of 0.03 mg/mL. Filter through 0.2 µm syringe filter.\nFlow avidin into the flow cell using a 1 mL syringe. Use another syringe filled with buffer to wash out excess avidin. Be careful not to introduce air bubbles while exchanging the syringes.\nMultiple-channel flow cell\nDrill six holes with a diameter of 1.22 mm on each of the long sides of a quartz slide (76 mm x 25 mm) (Figure 1B). Make the holes 4.5 mm from the edge of the slide and 9.3 mm apart. Ensure the distance between the centers of each hole pair is 15 mm.\nCut out six channels (20 mm x 2.25 mm) into a 76 mm x 25 mm piece of double-adhesive tape using the electronic cutter.\nPeel off the plastic side of the protective cover and align the edges of the adhesive piece with the edges of the quartz slide. Remove any trapped air bubbles by gentle pressing using a pair of polytetrafluoroethylene tweezers.",
    "Peel off the paper side of the adhesive piece and mount onto the functionalized surface of the coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: Sometimes peeling off the paper side and attaching to the quartz slide works well in the multichannel flow cell.\nCut the inlet tubes (11 cm) and outlet tubes (25 cm) for the six channels. Prepare the flow cell as described in steps 2.1.6–2.1.9.\nConnect the outlet of the first channel to the pump. Place the inlet into 0.5 mL tube with OSS.\n\t\tNOTE: The length of the inlet tube is chosen to maximize the number of events in the cleavage experiments performed under continuous flow by synchronizing time of enzyme entrance into the flow cell and start of imaging thus decreasing premature photobleaching of the fluorophores.\nMove to a new channel by disconnecting the outlet of the used channel. Close the outlet with a plug made from a syringe needle sealed with glue in the plastic part. Close the inlet of the used channel.\n3. Preparation of oxygen scavenging system (OSS)\nDissolve 0.2 g of (±)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (triplet state quencher which minimizes blinking of the fluorophores) in 800 µL of methanol.\nAdd 6 mL of deionized H2O and add 1 N NaOH dropwise until it dissolves. Filter through a syringe filter, make into 1 mL aliquots, and store at -80 °C. The stock concentration is ~100 µM.\nPrepare a fresh solution of 3,4-dihroxybenzoic acid (PCA) by dissolving 61 mg of PCA powder in 4 mL of ddH2O. The stock concentration is ~100 nM.\nAdd 58 µL of 10 N NaOH dropwise, making sure to vortex after each drop until PCA is fully dissolved (pH = 9).",
    "Dissolve 5.3 mg of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-PCD) in 7 mL of PCD storage buffer (Table 1). 3,4-PCD removes oxygen from the binding/cleavage buffers by catalyzing the oxidation of protocatechuic acid34.\nDivide the PCD solution into 1 mL aliquots. The stock concentration is ~1 µM. Snap-freeze the aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C for long-term storage or at -20 °C for short-term storage.\nPrepare a fresh binding buffer (Table 1). Substitute 2 mM CaCl2 with 2 mM MgCl2 for smFRET cleavage experiments.\nPrepare 1 mL of the imaging buffer (Table 1). Keep the imaging buffer on ice until it is introduced into the flow cell to maintain the activity of the oxygen scavenging system.\n4. Preparation of fluorescently labeled HJs\nReconstitute the lyophilized oligos (Table 2) in Tris-EDTA buffer (Table 1) to a concentration of 100 µM.\nPrepare the synthetic junction by mixing equimolar portions ~3 µL of each of the X0 oligos listed in Table 1.\nAnneal by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to RT at a rate of 1 °C/min. Use either a heat block or PCR thermocycler to achieve the desired cooling rate.\nLoad the mixture on 8 cm x 8 cm of 10% Tris-borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gel. Apply 100 V and run the gel for ~2 h. The bands are clearly seen by eye, and their color is purple.\nExcise the band of the annealed substrate with a clean blade. Transfer the gel piece into an autoclaved 1.5 mL tube.\nCrush the gel piece inside the tube with a clean plunger then add 100 µL of TE100 buffer (Table 1).\nExtract the HJ by shaking the tube at 20 °C at 1,500 rpm in a thermomixer for ~2 h or incubate overnight at 4 °C.",
    "Perform ethanol precipitation on the solution containing the substrate35.\nResuspend the substrate in 20 µL of TE100 buffer (Table 1). The final concentration is 1–3 µM. Aliquot 2 µL in each tube and store at -20 °C.\n5. Protein expression and purification of GEN1\nConstruct the plasmid for the expression of truncated human GEN11,2,3,4,5 with hexa histidine-tag at the C-terminus20 by PCR of the entry vector.\n\tNOTE: N-terminal tagging would result in the inactivation of GEN1. The unstructured C-tail renders the purification of the full length GEN1 significantly harder. Also, the full length GEN1 was reported to exhibit less activity than truncated version23.\nTransform the expression vector into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL strain.\nInoculate the transformed cells into two 6 L flasks each containing 2 L of Luria broth media at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm until an OD600 of 0.8 is reached.\nCool down the culture to 16 °C and induce GEN1 expression with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 48 h.\nHarvest the cells by spinning them down at 4 °C at 1000 x g in a centrifuge. Each liter of culture yields 5–6 g of the pellet.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted cells in lysis buffer (Table 1) using 4 mL/g of cells.\nPerform cell lysis using a cell disruptor at 30 kPsi then spin down at 10,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant and filter it on ice using 0.45 µm filters.\nPerform protein purification using FPLC by passing the filtrate through a 5 mL Ni-NTA column at 2.5 ml/min flow rate using Buffer A (Table 1).",
    "Wash with 15 column volumes (CV). Elute with a linear gradient of Buffer A and 500 mM Imidazole over 20 CV in 5 mL fractions. GEN1 elutes from the column at around 100 mM Imidazole.\nPipette 10 µL aliquots from the collected fractions, add equal volume of 2x SDS loading dye to each aliquot. Denature the samples by heating at 90 °C for 5 min, cool, and spin down the samples.\nLoad the samples onto 10% Bis-Tris gel. Run the gel for 30–45 min at 200 V. Stain using Coomassie Brilliant Blue, then destain. Collect the fractions that contain purified GEN1.\nReduce the salt concentration of the combined fractions to 100 mM by dilution using buffer C (Table 1).\nPass the low salt protein through a 5 mL heparin column at a flow rate of 3 mL/min using Buffer B (Table 1).\nWash with 10 CV. Elute using a gradient of 20 CV with Buffer B and 1 M NaCl. Collect 5 mL fractions in which GEN1 elutes around 360 mM NaCl.\nCheck the eluted fractions for purified GEN1 fractions as described in step 5.8. Combine those fractions and dilute to 100 mM NaCl using Buffer C.\nLoad the lower salt protein onto a cation exchange column at 1 mL/min flow rate using Buffer B.\nElute by a gradient of 40 CV using Buffer B and 1 M NaCl. Collect 1.7 mL fractions in which GEN1 elutes around 300 mM NaCl.\nCheck for the purity of GEN1 in the eluted fractions as described in step 5.8.\nCombine the purest fractions and dialyze at 4 °C against storage buffer (Table 1). Perform at least one exchange of the buffer during dialysis.",
    "Measure the protein concentration ~0.5–1 mg/mL. Aliquot the dialyzed protein in 10–15 µL volumes in small tubes, flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C.\n6. Single-molecule FRET experiments\nNOTE: The smFRET experiments are performed on a custom-built objective based TIRF set-up (Figure 1C) described previously31.\nSingle-color FRET experiments\nApply one drop of immersion oil onto the 100x TIRF objective. Set the EMCCD to suitable gain to optimize the signal to background and prevent saturation.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not look directly into the laser beam and wear protective goggles when aligning the laser.\nPlace the flow cell carefully on the sample holder. Gradually raise the objective using coarse adjustment until the oil touches the coverslip.\nTurn on the green laser (532 nm). Switch to fine adjustment mode of the objective. Direct the emission to the camera port to observe the image on the monitor.\nAdjust the height of the objective until the functionalized surface of the coverslip is brought in focus and can be observed on the monitor.\n\t\tNOTE: The image acquisition by EMCCD triggers the laser excitation via the acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) to prevent sample photobleaching when images are not being acquired.\nCheck that the background from the functionalized surface of the coverslips does not exceed few spots before flowing in the fluorescently labeled HJ.\nDilute the stock substrate approximately 1000 times in TE100 buffer (Table 1) to a final concentration of 1–5 nM. Pipette 0.2–0.5 µL of the diluted substrate into 120 µL of the imaging buffer with OSS into a 0.5 mL tube.\nConnect the outlet of the flow cell to the syringe pump. Insert the inlet tube of the flow cell into 1.5 mL tube and operate the syringe pump at a flow rate of 30–50 µL/min to withdraw the solution from the tube.",
    "Frequently check the surface for good coverage (100–300 of homogenously distributed, well-spaced substrate) by imaging briefly with the green laser.\nIf the surface coverage is still not enough either wait for few minutes for the fluorescently labeled HJ from the solution to settle onto the surface or repeat the flowing step.\nFlow another 120 µL of imaging buffer (Table 1) at 30–50 µL/min to wash unbound fluorescently labeled HJ. Then let the flow cell sit for 5 min to allow for the OSS to deplete dissolved oxygen. The photobleaching of the fluorophores should be minimal at the start of imaging.\nSet the exposure time (~60 ms), the cycle time will be automatically set by software based on the speed of data transfer (~104 ms), and specify the desired number of cycles or frames (~400).The emission from donor (Cy3) and acceptor (Alexa Fluor 647) is split into two color channels by an image splitter device.\nFind a suitable area on the surface, focus the image by adjusting the height of the objective and record and save the movie in 16-bit TIFF format.\nMove to a new area.\n\t\tNOTE: Always move in one direction only (i.e., from outlet to inlet) to avoid imaging the same area twice.\nPrepare 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 nM GEN1 in 120 µL of imaging buffer one at a time. Flow the solution at a flow rate of 30-50 µL/min.\n\t\tNOTE: If the required measurement is done under steady state as in the binding of HJ by GEN1 or the isomerization of the free HJ, then wait 3–5 min after the flow stops to record the movie. Acquire three to four movies from new areas for each GEN1 concentration.",
    "If the measurement is performed under continuous flow as in cleavage of HJ by GEN1 then start recording 5–10 s before the entrance of GEN1 into the flow cell. Repeat the measurement by moving to a new channel in the six-channel flow cell.\nAt the end, use a fixed fluorescent bead slide to map the donor and acceptor particles to each other in the image splitting device.\nAdd 0.2 µL of 1 µm diameter fluorescent beads into 500 µL of 1 M Tris (pH = 8.0) to allow the beads to stick to the surface.\nCut a square (18 mm x 18 mm) inside a 22 mm x 22 mm piece of a double-sided adhesive seal. Peel off and stick the piece to the middle of a 76 mm x 25 mm quartz slide.\nPlace 50 µL of the diluted beads solution and leave for 5–10 min to settle. Attach a 22 mm x 22 mm coverslip on top of the square piece. Dry excess beads solution with tissue, then seal the chamber by epoxy glue.\nAcquire 100 frames of the beads slide at a 60 ms exposure time.\n\t\tCAUTION: Lower the laser power and the EMCCD gain to minimum to avoid saturation of the detector.\nInstall the software package (e.g., TwoTones) and open the movies therein as indicated in the user manual36. Select the positions of the individual beads in the donor and acceptor channels. Generate a transformation matrix as described in the manual.\n\t\tNOTE: This software uses transformation matrix to match the positions of the particles in the donor and acceptor channels and correct for any slight misalignment in the image splitting device.",
    "Go to File, press Load Movie, then select the movie file and press Open. In file menu, press Load TFORM and select the transformation matrix generated from the beads slide. Adjust the threshold for the donor and acceptor channels until no false positives are included.\nIn the Channel filter menu, choose D&&A option to select for particles labeled with both donor and acceptor. Check the Nearest neighbor limit field to exclude molecules that are very near to each other. Check Max ellipticity to exclude very eccentric molecules and check Width limits to exclude very broad or very narrow molecules.\nType plotHistCW as instructed in Twotones manual to construct histograms.\n\t\tNOTE: The “apparent” FRET efficiency is calculated by the program by dividing the emission of the acceptor by the total emissions from the donor and acceptor. Twotones uses 100 intervals to bin the distribution of the states of the molecules against the FRET efficiency.\nType plotTimetraceCW as instructed in Twotones manual to generate the time-traces for each molecule.\n\t\tNOTE: Time-traces can be further analyzed by vbFRET37 to identify different FRET states, their respective dwell times, and transition rates between different states.\nTwo-color alternating excitation FRET (ALEX) experiments\nRecord a movie composed of consecutive frames of donor and acceptor emissions by direct excitations with the green and red lasers, respectively, each ~80 ms in duration.\nOpen the acquired ALEX movies in Twotones. Set the suitable detection threshold as ~300 for the three channels: donor emission due to donor excitation (DexDem); acceptor emission due to donor excitation (DexAem); and acceptor emission due to direct excitation (AexAem).\nApply the Channel filter DexDem&&DexAem&&AexAem to select for the particles that have both donor and acceptor. Link the particles ~200–300 in the three channels.",
    "Use the plotHistALEX MATLAB code to generate ALEX histograms. Fit different peaks in the histograms to gaussian functions and determine the percentage of each population the area under the curve using Origin software38.\n\t\tNOTE: The peaks in the binding assay correspond to the bound GEN1-HJ complex, while in the free HJ, the peaks represent the interchanging isomers.\nUse the plotTimetraceALEX MATLAB code to generate a time-trace for each molecule showing donor emission by direct excitation, and acceptor emissions due to FRET and direct excitation.\n\t\tNOTE: ALEX time-traces independently to show the emissions of both the donor and acceptor, but at lower temporal resolution than single-color FRET. Similar to single-color FRET, ALEX time-traces can be further analyzed by vbFRET to identify different FRET states and their respective dwell times.\nDetermine the dissociation constant by fitting the percentages of the bound population versus GEN1 concentration to a hyperbolic function.\nTime lapse single-color FRET\nSet the exposure time of the green laser to 60 ms and cycle time to 624 ms or lower, depending on the speed of the observed dynamics.\nSet the flow rate to 110 µL/min in one channel of the six-channel flow cell. Start the recording briefly before the entrance of GEN1 inside the flow cell.\n\t\tNOTE: Continuous flow leads to rapid photobleaching of the fluorophores, therefore synchronizing the start of imaging and protein entry maximizes the number of captured events. The optimal syringe pump reading depends on the dead-volume and the exact tubing used to assemble the flow cell; in our case it is ~25 µL.\nAcquire a movie of ~125 frames for a total acquisition time of 78 s. At the end of the recording, expose the sample to the red laser for 50 frames each with 25 ms exposure time to probe the acceptor.",
    "NOTE: This method prolongs the observation window in cleavage experiment through decreasing the number of excitation cycles. Kinetic parameters as kon and koff of dimerization are derived by fitting the distribution to a bi-exponential model30,38.\n7. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)\nIn 50 µL total volume, incubate the desired concentration of GEN1 with 50 pM Cy5-labeled HJ at RT for 30 min in EMSA binding buffer (Table 1).\nLoad the samples on 8 cm x 8 cm of 6% Tris-borate-EDTA gel. Run the gel using 100 V for 1 h + 20 min in 1x TBE buffer at RT.\nDetermine the percentage of bound substrate at a GEN1 concentration from its relative contribution to the total fluorescence intensity of the respective lane.\n\tNOTE: GEN1 monomer-HJ (band I) is identified by the agreement of its size with the picomolar binding of GEN1 monomer to the nicked HJ21,30. GEN1-dimer-HJ is assigned to band II because of the stepwise binding of GEN1 monomer to the HJ21,23.\nCalculate the apparent binding constants Kd-monomer-app-EMSA and Kd-dimer-app-EMSA using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60045/60045equ01.jpg\n\tWhere: Max is the concentration at which the respective species reached its maximum binding (monomer or dimer); n is the Hill coefficient; Kd-app-EMSA is the apparent binding constant of the respective species, denoting the concentration of GEN1 at which half-maximum of monomer or dimer is present."
