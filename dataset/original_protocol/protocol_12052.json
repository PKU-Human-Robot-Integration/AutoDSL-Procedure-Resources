    "All animal-related procedures were reviewed and approved by the York University Animal Care Committee. Upon arrival at the animal facility at York University, all rats were given a minimum of five days to acclimatize to their environment prior to the surgical procedure, with food provided ad libitum. Although this protocol has been previously applied to other species15,17,22, the current paper builds on the pioneering work of Pette and colleagues23 and focuses on the rat model, specifically.\n1. Preparation of Chronic Contractile Activity Unit\nUsing a voltmeter, check the potential of the coin lithium batteries.\n\tNOTE: The potential of each battery should be 3.0 ± 0.10 V.\nInsert two or three batteries into the slot of the unit so that the total potential is 6 - 9 V.\n\tNOTE: It is up to the discretion of the researchers to consider how much potential (6 or 9 V) to maintain during the whole experimental procedure. Depending on the study design, and the desired intensity of the stimulus, either 2 or 3 batteries can be used.\nVerify that the unit is working properly via the pulse indicator, by exposing the unit to 1 pulse emitted by a portable infrared strobe light.\n2. Surgical Procedure of Chronic Contractile Activity\nNOTE: Sterilize all surgical tools before the surgical procedure. Both during and immediately after the surgery, the body temperature of the rats is maintained by a heating pad. It is desirable to perform the surgical procedure on a surgical drape. The surgeon should wear sterile surgical gloves as well as a clean lab coat. If needed, it is recommended to wear a disposable respirator mask.",
    "Anesthetize rats under 1 - 3% isoflurane inhalation with oxygen, which is operated by a gas vaporizer system. Confirm animal is fully sedated by checking hindlimb toe pinch and by observing respiratory depth and rate. Apply ocular lubricant on eyes to avoid dryness. Apply a subcutaneous injection of Meloxicam (0.5 mg/mL) at 2 mg/kg.\n\tNOTE: It is also recommended to have a multi-modal application of analgesia (e.g., Meloxicam plus lidocaine) to minimize any pain during and after the surgery.\nGently shave the left hindlimb, as well as a strip around the torso from the back of the neck, around behind of the forelimbs and across the anterior thorax. Gently wipe shaved areas with iodine and ethyl alcohol to disinfect.\nWith the animal laying on its stomach, make a small incision (~0.5 cm) on the back of the neck in the center of the shaved region (the palpable area between shoulder blades) using a scalpel (No. 10 blade).\nLocate the common peroneal nerve.\n\t\nRoll animal onto its right side and make a ~2 - 3 cm-long cut in the skin of the left hindlimb. Target the incision area around the upper thigh muscle groups that is landmarked between the dimple of the knee joint and the back close to the origin of the tail.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to contaminate the first incision area when changing the position of body.\nUsing blunt-tipped curved surgical scissors, dissect the subcutaneous area widely ~3.5 - 4 cm, separating the skin from underlying muscle in order to make a pocket between the opened skin and underlying muscle. Open the skin from underlying tissue around the entire circumference of the incision (~1.5 cm2).",
    "Make a small incision (less than 0.5 cm) on the biceps femoris muscle with surgical scissors, ensuring that the tips of the scissors are cutting directly down through the muscle.\nGently open the cut area until the internal muscle groups and the common peroneal nerve are visible (the depth of external muscle tissues (i.e., biceps femoris) is around ~0.5 cm). Using forceps, gently touch/pinch the visible nerve and observe responses of the target muscle groups (e.g., TA muscle) and toes (visible dorsiflexion) to confirm that the common peroneal nerve is isolated.\n\t\tNOTE: This step should be done with extreme caution to avoid cutting or damaging the nerve.\nFix the window by pulling it open with metal retractors such that the size of the window is ~1.5 cm2 with the peroneal nerve lying in the center of the window. Use small metal hooks attached to straps and/or rubber bands that are fastened down to the table surface (or surgery board) (Figure 2A).\nAttach the wire to both sides of the nerve.\n\t\nPrepare ~50 - 60 cm of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated fine stainless-steel wire and fold it in half. \n\t\tNOTE: It may be helpful to expose PTFA-coated wire under the UV light before the surgery.\nHook the folded part of the wire into the slit of a 30 cm-long stainless-steel rod. Pass the rod, along with the wire, subcutaneously from the open pocket of the hindlimb towards the small incision area at the back of the neck, in an L-shape pattern up the leg and along the center of the back.",
    "Find the two ends of the wire at the hindlimb. Strip the wires since all wires are PTFE-insulated. Using a scalpel, carefully strip the ends of the wire by ~1.5 cm. If the wires become frayed, cut them out and re-strip. Wrap the stripped wire ends around a blunted 21-G needle (5 times), making a coil. Once the coils are properly made, release the needle from them.\nUsing a size 6-0 surgical silk, secure each of the coils on either side of the common peroneal nerve (Figure 2A).\n\t\t\nMake a knot at the very end of the coil, and suture it on the left-hand side of the nerve. Ensure that the coil is at 1.5 - 2.5 mm from the nerve.\nTo secure the coil, apply two or three additional sutures along the coil.\nRepeat these steps on the right-hand side of the nerve.\nApply 2 - 3 drops of antibiotic solution (ampicillin in saline; 132 mg/mL), and then carefully suture the window (i.e., biceps femoris muscle tissue) using size 5-0 silk.\nLoosely wind the remaining slack of wire (about the diameter of the index finger) and push into the subcutaneous pocket above the sutured incision of the biceps femoris muscle (approximately above the hip).\nApply 2 - 3 drops of antibiotic solution again (ampicillin in saline; 132 mg/mL). Close the opened skin by stapling.\nConnect the wires (coming out of the incision area of the neck) to the CCA stimulator.\n\t\nConnect pin sockets with the wires.\n\t\t\nCut the wire loop coming out of the incision at the top of the neck to create 2 wire ends (these lead to the coils sutured to either side of the peroneal nerve).\nUsing a scalpel, strip off the ends of the wires by ~0.5 cm. Cut off frayed wires, if any.",
    "Slowly push the stripped parts of the wires into the hole of the pin sockets, and using a soldering iron, solder the wires on the pin sockets.\nOptionally, check the connection of wires.\n\t\t\nConnect the pins to a large benchtop stimulator unit via alligator clips.\nDeliver a single pulse of 9 V (0.1 ms, 10 Hz) to confirm that TA muscle contracts and the left foot dorsiflexes.\nPass the pin connected-wire ends through the sterile gauze pad that is ~4 cm x 4 cm.\nConnect the pins to the CCA stimulator unit.\n\t\t\nPass the wires through the hole in the base of the stimulator box.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This box is a home-made chamber for the CCA stimulator unit and is 3.5 cm × 3.5 cm × 2.5 cm13.\nInsert the pins into the connection sockets on the CCA unit. Gently put the CCA unit into the chamber. Use a sticky tack to secure the CCA unit at the bottom of the chamber.\nUsing an athletic tape or the porous surgical tape, fix the chamber with tape around the shaved torso. Close the top of the chamber with three layers of taping and finish by wrapping a tape around the sides of the stimulator box to secure the box (Figure 2B).\nCheck if the CCA is working by exposing the unit to a single pulse of infrared light (wavelength spectrum >770 nm) that is emitted by a portable infrared strobe light.\n\tNOTE: If the CCA is properly working, researchers will be able to see the hindlimb muscles (i.e., TA) are contracting in response to the infrared light.",
    "Observe the rat and monitor its temperature until it has fully regained consciousness. House it in a single-occupant cage to prevent any harm from other animals and do not leave any tunnels or plastic objects in the cage for the remainder of the study to mitigate the risk of damage to the stimulator unit or injury to the animal. Supply with an Amoxicillin-included water bottle (0.5 mg/mL).\nApply 1 mg/kg dose of Meloxicam subcutaneously every 24 h following the surgery, which continues at least for 72 h.\n3. Chronic Contractile Activity\nAfter the surgery, allow at least 5 - 7 days for a full recovery of incision and suture areas in/around the skeletal muscles.\n\tNOTE: During and after CCA procedure, thoroughly check each animal's condition by observing their behaviors (e.g., eating, drinking, and/or moving). In addition, determine any severe stress or adverse effects by checking a change of body weight before and after the CCA procedure.\nOn the day of CCA stimulation, turn on CCA by exposing the stimulator unit to a single pulse of infrared light (wavelength range >770 nm) by a portable infrared strobe light.\nApply 3 or 6 h of 10 Hz CCA stimulation.\n\tNOTE: The time frame for stimulation is up to the researcher. The frequency of stimulation has never been altered in these experiments and only very modest enhancements in the mitochondrial adaptation have been observed by extending the stimulation from 3 to 6 h/day, in our experience. If possible, check the stimulation and animal every 30 - 60 min.\nFollowing the desired CCA period, turn off the CCA unit via infrared light exposure (same procedure as turning on the unit).\nIf applying multiple days, repeat the step 3.2. to 3.4.",
    "Determine the timing of tissue collection. For example, collect tissues 24 h after the onset of the final bout of CCA (i.e., 18 h after the last CCA stimulation of 6 h), which is conducted under the anesthesia as done during the CCA surgical procedure. Immediately after collecting all tissues, euthanize animals by excising the heart while the animal is still under anesthetic.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
