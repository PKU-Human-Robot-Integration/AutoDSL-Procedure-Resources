    "1. HDL Purification (~ 5.5 days)\nDensity-Gradient Ultracentrifugation (DGUC, ~ 5 days)\n\t\nAdd 90 μL of 100x anti-oxidants to 9 mL of plasma isolated from fresh venous blood.\nAdjust plasma density with KBr from 1.006 g/mL to 1.025 g/mL by adding 0.251 g KBr to 9 mL of plasma from Step 1.1.1 (0.0278 g/mL KBr plasma). Rock the plasma until all the salt is dissolved at room temperature and transfer to ultracentrifuge tubes and ensure all bubbles rise to the top.\nBend the tip of an 18-G needle to 90° 1 cm from the tip, bevel side facing up. Using a syringe and the 18-gauge needle, carefully place 3 mL of overlay solution #1 over the plasma (Table 1).\n\t\tNOTE: The bent needle ensures all the VLDL/IDL, LDL, and HDL are removed without mixing with the overlay.\nRemove the majority of the bubbles at the top, leaving 2 - 3 mm space from meniscus to the top of the tube and carefully place the tubes in SW-40Ti buckets.\nWeigh each bucket (with the caps) on the balance, and exactly balance with the opposite bucket (bucket + cap): #1 to #4, #2 to #5, and #3 to #6.\n\t\tNOTE: These buckets must be balanced and matched at all times.\nPlace rotor in ultracentrifuge (List of Materials). Centrifuge at 274,400 x g for 24 h at 4 °C with a #4 intermediate brake.\nCarefully remove buckets from rotor and the tubes from buckets.\nCarefully remove 2 mL from the top layer of the overlay using a syringe and bent needle. This will be the VLDL/IDL fraction which can be stored at 4 °C or -80 °C.",
    "After removing the VLDL/IDL fraction, collect the remaining 7 mL of sample (plasma) and place it into a 15 mL conical tube. Bring the volume of the sample up to 9 mL with overlay solution #2 (Table 1).\nAdjust the sample density from 1.025 g/mL to 1.080 g/mL with KBr using approximately 0.746 g KBr in the 9 mL sample or 0.0828 g/mL KBr of sample. Gently rock the sample until all the KBr is dissolved (approximately 20 min) and transfer to ultracentrifuge tube while ensuring bubbles rise to the top.\nWith syringe and needle, carefully place 3 mL of overlay solution #3 over the sample (Table 1). Leave 2 - 3 mm space from meniscus to the top of the tube.\nRemove the majority of any remaining bubbles at the top of the tube and carefully place the filled ultracentrifuge tubes in SW-40Ti buckets.\nWeigh each bucket (with the caps) on the balance, and exactly balance with the opposite bucket + cap, as in 1.1.5.\nPlace rotor in ultracentrifuge (see List of Materials). Centrifuge at 274,400 x g for 24 h at 4 °C with a #4 intermediate brake.\nCarefully remove buckets from rotor and the tubes from buckets.\nCarefully remove 2 mL from the top layer of the overlay using a syringe and bent needle. This will be the LDL fraction which can be stored at 4 °C or -80 °C.\nAfter removing the LDL fraction, collect the remaining approximate 7 mL of sample (plasma) and place it into a new 15 mL conical tube. Bring the volume of the sample (plasma) up to 9 mL with 1.080 g/mL solution #4 (Table 1).",
    "Adjust the sample density from 1.080 g/mL to 1.30 g/mL with KBr using 3.33 g KBr in the 9 mL sample (plasma) or 0.37 g KBr for each mL of sample. Rock or slightly agitate the sample until all the KBr (salt) is dissolved and transfer to ultracentrifuge tube.\nWith syringe and needle, carefully place 3 mL of overlay solution #5 over the sample (Table 1).\nRemove the majority of any remaining bubbles at the top of the tube, leaving 2- 3 mm space from meniscus to the top of the tube and carefully place the filled ultracentrifuge tubes in SW-40Ti buckets.\nWeigh each bucket (with the caps) on the balance, and exactly balance with the opposite bucket + cap, as in 1.1.5.\nPlace rotor in ultracentrifuge (see List of Materials). Centrifuge at 274,400 x g for 48 h at 4 °C with a #4 brake.\nCarefully remove buckets from rotor and the tubes from buckets.\nCarefully remove approximately 2 mL from the top layer of the overlay using a syringe and bent needle. This is the HDL fraction, which can be stored at 4 °C or -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Following DGUC HDL may be dialyzed to remove the high-salt solutions.\nTo dialyze, place the collected HDL fraction in a sealed dialysis sleeve (10,000 m.w. cut-off) and dialyze overnight in 1 L 1x PBS. Change dialysis buffer (1x PBS) 3 times over 24 h. Gentle perturbation of the PBS with a magnetic stir-bar will improve dialysis.\nDetermine the protein concentration of the DGUC-HDL using a BCA method8.\nFast-Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) or Size-Exclusion Chromatography (~ 6 h)\nFilter 1.2 mg of DGUC-HDL (total protein) in 500 µL through a 0.22 µm micro-centrifugal filter (see List of Materials), immediately prior to injection.",
    "NOTE: An additional filtering of the DGUC-HDL sample through a 0.45 µm micro-centrifugal filter prior to the 0.22 µm filter may be required for some samples.\nCollect the filtered DGUC-HDL sample, load the FPLC (fill) injection syringe, and ensure there are no bubbles in the syringe before injecting into the FPLC.\nSet the FPLC flow rate to 0.3 mL/min with a pressure limit at 2.6 MPa. Equilibrate columns with 0.2 column volumes (approximately 15 mL) of buffer, prior to sample injection. Inject the sample with 3 mL of buffer into the FPLC (injection loop) instrument and start the run. Collect 1.5 mL fractions for a total of 72 fractions.\n2. High-throughput Small RNA Sequencing (sRNAseq, ~ 9 days)\nRNA Isolation (~ 1 day)\nIdentify the FPLC fractions corresponding to DGUC-HDL by determining total cholesterol levels using a colorimetric kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using this FPLC set-up, expect to find 6 - 7 FPLC fractions containing DGUC-HDL.\nCollect all the volume (approximately 8 -1 0 mL pool of 1.45 mL fraction volumes) from DGUC-HDL FPLC fractions and concentrate using 10 kDa m.w. cut-off centrifugal filter units at 4,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C or until HDL concentrate is approximately 100 µL.\nCollect the HDL concentrate and quantify HDL total protein concentration using the BCA method8.\nDetermine the highest concentration of HDL total protein, up to 1 mg, that can be aliquoted from each sample in the set. For example, isolate RNA from the same amount of HDL total protein for each sample.\nPerform RNA Isolation using a modified protocol (see List of Materials).\nAdd 10x volume of phenol lysis reagent (see List of Materials) sample and vortex for 1 min.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "Add chloroform (20% of phenol lysis reagent volume used in step 2.1.5.1) and shake vigorously for 15 s.\nIncubate at room temperature for 2 - 3 min.\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C in a refrigerated centrifuge.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase to a new tube, avoiding the interphase.\nAdd 1.5x volume of 100% ethanol to the aqueous phase and vortex for 1 min.\nStore samples for at least 1 h or overnight at -80 °C.\nContinue with the RNA isolation protocol using the provided mini columns.\nElute with 30 µL of RNase-free H2O. First add 15 µL of H2O directly to the frit, spin at low speed (2,000 x g) for 2 min, and then spin at high speed (max) for 1 min. Repeat this step with an additional 15 µL of H2O.\nImmediately proceed to sRNA library generation or store at -80 °C.\nLibrary Generation (~ 6 h)\nPrepare sRNA cDNA libraries using the sRNA library generation kit protocol, as per manufacturer's instructions with one modification to the PCR amplification as detailed below.\n\t\t\nPrepare the PCR mastermix on ice containing 0.5 µL DNase/RNase-free H2O, 15 µL PCR Mix (PML) and 1 µL RNA PCR Primer (RP1) per sample (include an additional 10% for pipetting error).\nAdd 16.5 µL of the PCR mix to each (cDNA) sample.\nAssign an index/barcode number to each sample for multiplexing and add 1 µL PCR Primer Index (to the corresponding number) to the sample.\nPerform a quick spin using the microfuge.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Total volume should now be 30 µL per sample.\nPerform the cycling conditions for PCR amplification as detailed in Tables 2 and 3.\nSize Select sRNA Library to Remove Adapter:Adapters (~ 1.5 h)",

If more than one lane is required, mix case and control samples appropriately.\nHigh-throughput sRNA Sequencing (~ 7 days)\nPool individual indexed sRNA libraries based on equimolar concentrations.\nScreen pooled sRNA libraries for quality using high-sensitivity DNA chip on the bioanalyzer and determine library DNA concentration as in 2.5.1 - 2.5.2.\nPerform quantitative PCR (qPCR) of adapter content to ensure appropriate sequencing depth using the sequencing library qPCR quantification kit as per manufacturer's instructions (List of Materials).\nPerform sequencing using a single read, 50 bp protocol to reach a depth of approximately 20 - 25 M reads/sample, as per manufacturer's instructions.\n3. Data Analysis (~ 1 day)\nUse bcl2fastq2, as per user guide instructions, to preprocess raw fastq files of demultiplexed samples (List of Materials).\nUse Cutadapt to trim adapters9 and remove reads < 16 nucleotides (nts) in length, as per user guide instructions (List of Materials).",

(e.g., RPMM =(miR-X/Total # of miRNA reads)*1,000,000).\nInput normalized count table as generic single color technology into software for low-level and high-level differential analyses as per user guide instructions (List of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Currently, there are no well-characterized housekeeping genes/sRNAs for HDL-sRNA. A spike-in control may be used, but can be problematic. Normalizing to HDL total protein input or volume is advised. Most importantly, it is recommended to validate sequencing results by one of the various strategies to quantify miRNAs and sRNAs using real-time PCR or quantitative PCR.\nSubscription Required.
