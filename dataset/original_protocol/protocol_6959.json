    "Leave on benchtop (room temperature) for 30 min to form RNP complex. Cover with aluminum film because the photocaged gRNA are light-sensitive.Add 2 μl (~60 fmol) of PCR-amplified PPP1R2 target DNA to each RNP tube (11 in total). Mix well with pipette. For a highly efficient reaction, Cas9/cgRNA should be in at least 100-fold excess relative to target DNA. The target DNA should also be easily visible on an agarose gel with a gel imager.Set up two thermocyclers – one to 37°C and the other to 95°C.Move one tube to the 37°C thermocycler, open lid, and wait for 1 min. Turn on 365 nm LED flashlight 10 cm above tube for 1 s; then, immediately transfer tube to 95°C for 5 min and then to ice (which corresponds to ‘1 s’ sample) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4138/bioprotoc-11-17-4138-g001.jpgFigure 1. In vitro cleavage setup. (a) Cas9, gRNA, and target DNA are added to tubes labeled with the appropriate incubation times. (b) Tubes are first placed in the 37°C incubator. After light exposure and 37°C incubation for the specified time, each tube is transferred to the 95°C incubator for heat-deactivation of Cas9. (c) Light exposure using a commercially available LED flashlight. The tube is first opened, the flashlight is held 10 cm above the tube, and the light is turned on for 30 s.Repeat using three other tubes for 5 s, 10 s, and 30 s of light illumination (which corresponds to ‘5 s’, ’10 s’, and ’30 s’ samples, respectively).Move another tube to the 37°C thermocycler, open lid, and wait for 1 min. Turn on 365 nm LED flashlight 10 cm above tube for 30 s, turn off flashlight and incubate tube with cap closed for another 30 s; transfer to 95°C for 5 min and then to ice (which corresponds to ‘1 min’ sample).",
    "Repeat using five other tubes with 30 s light illumination, followed by 1.5 min, 4.5 min, 9.5 min, 19.5 min, and 29.5 min incubations at 37°C; transfer to 95°C for 5 min, and then to ice (which corresponds to ‘2 min’, ‘5 min’, ’10 min’, ’20 min’, and ’30 min’ samples, respectively).The one remaining sample should not be exposed to light but directly moved to 95°C for 5 min and then to ice (which corresponds to ‘no light’ sample).Add 0.5 μl of Proteinase K to all 11 tubes and incubate at 55°C for 15 min.Load 5 μl of each tube (in ascending order of time-duration) mixed with 15 μl of water into each well of a 4% agarose E-Gel and run for 10 min. Add 100 bp ladder to the left-most lane. An alternative agarose gel electrophoresis system may also be used.Visualize with TyphoonTM FLA 9000 using the SYBR Gold setting. An alternative gel imager may also be used (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4138/bioprotoc-11-17-4138-g002.jpgFigure 2. In vitro cleavage results. The top band migrating at 444 bp corresponds to the uncleaved PCR product of PPP1R2. The bottom band is formed by two unresolved bands, both migrating around 220 bp, which correspond to the cleavage products of the 444 bp top band. Each lane corresponds to either no light exposure or a different light exposure/incubation condition.EMSAMix the following components together in order. Thoroughly mix NFW and NEBufferTM 3.1 before adding cgRNA and Cas9 and mixing again. Prepare 2 identical volumes, both in PCR tubes as samples {B} and {C}.table:",

Lane 1 is the ladder; lane 2 is sample {A} (negative control without RNP); lane 3 is sample {B} (EMSA); lane 4 is sample {C} (Proteinase K digested sample). There is no cleavage product because the cgRNA was not exposed to any light, demonstrating that Cas9 with cgRNA binds to DNA even in the absence of light activation."
