    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSkeletal muscle mitochondria isolation\nTiming: [1 h]\nIsolation of soleus oxidative skeletal muscle mitochondria by centrifugation steps (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nSacrifice mice in CO2 chamber.\nExtract soleus muscles from mice hindlimbs using pre-cooled and sterilized surgical material inside a laminar flow cabinet to reduce impurities.\nNote: To extract soleus, fix the mouse leg in a flexed position to the dissecting table and cover it with cold 1× PBS solution. Remove hair, skin and surrounding fascia. Cut Achilles tendon. Separate the soleus muscle from the hindlimb and clean from leftover fascia. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], adapted from (Shinin et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]))\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/924-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Scheme of soleus extraction\n1. Lateral view of the anatomy of mouse hindlimb. 2.Extraction of soleus: remove fascia, insert fine-tip forceps between distal tendons, liberate Achilles tendon from tibial bone, liberate soleus from proximal tendons and extract soleus. 3: Immediately transfer soleus to cold PBS.\nCritical: Remove as much fascia as possible, as remaining fascia will complicate the isolation of the entire muscle.\nNote: To identify soleus, pay attention to muscle color. Being deeply oxidative and enriched in mitochondria, soleus red color is darker than surrounding muscle. Carefully cut the tendon as close as possible to the knee and separate soleus.\nCritical: Soleus must be extracted with no white adipose tissue (WAT) deposits to ensure coupling of isolated mitochondria.\nWeigh soleus.\nNote: Depending on the age of the animals, 2 or more solei are needed to get enough mitochondria for measuring respiration. This also depends on the volume of the chamber and the sensitivity of the Clark-type electrode. This protocol has been optimized for 4 solei (a pool of 2 mice/preparation).",
    "Note: Mitochondrial function can be also analyzed in situ in permeabilized mouse soleus fiber bundles (Kuznetsov et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]), allowing 2 respirometer runs per soleus, although the method does not allow the measurement of all the parameters reported in this protocol (see below).\nFor isolating mitochondria (on ice). Adapted from (Fernandez-Vizarra et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]):\nWash soleus in cold PBS 1× in a pre-cooled 50 mL glass beaker.\nMince muscles in four volumes (depending on muscle weight) of buffer A until pieces are homogeneous with the help of pre-cooled surgical scissors.\nOptional: Nagarse or other smooth proteases increase mitochondrial purity, reducing the amounts of other organelles. Step b may be performed in buffer C. Incubate 5–10 min on ice to allow Nagarse to act.\nCritical: excessive time in Nagarse added buffer may disrupt mitochondria.\nNote: Mitochondria purity may be verified by WB using specific antibodies against mitochondrial complexes (anti-NDUFA9), cytosolic (anti-tubulin) or other organelle (anti-calreticulin) proteins.\nHomogenize in a glass-glass homogenizer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/924-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative image of potters A and B, and dounce\n10 times with potter A (smoother).\n15 times with potter B (stronger).\nCritical: It is really important not to pass more times with the potters than necessary. Mitochondria may uncouple if the homogenization step is too strong. Exact conditions of homogenization should be optimized for any potter.\nImmediately transfer the homogenized suspension to previously pre-cooled centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge 10 min at 700 g at 4°C.\nDiscard pellet, contains nucleus and intact cells.\nRepeat eand f steps once.\nNote: the double centrifugation is required to improve purity of isolated mitochondria.\nCentrifuge supernatant for 10 min at 10,000 g at 4°C.\nEliminate supernatant, and suspend mitochondria enriched pellet in 100 μL of buffer B.",
    "Measure mitochondria protein by Bradford method in a spectrophotometer. A summary for steps a-j is provided in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/924-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Mitochondria isolation protocol\nStep1: sacrifice mice in CO2 chamber. Step 2: soleus extraction and weight. Step 3: soleus wash with cold and sterile PBS. Step 4: mince soleus in buffer A. Step 5: incubate with Nagarse protease. Step 6: homogenize in glass-glass homogenizer. Step 7: pellet nuclear and membrane rests. Step 8: discard pellet. Step 9: pellet mitochondria. Step 10: resuspend mitochondria in buffer B. Step 11: measure mitochondrial protein.\nNote: This and other protocols require coupled mitochondria (Nuevo-Tapioles et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). When coupling is not required (ETC enzymatic activities, blue native, in-gel activities among others protocols (Nuevo-Tapioles et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18])) h and i steps may be repeated once or twice to enhance mitochondrial purity.\nCritical: Buffer B may interfere with protein measurement. Ensure to use buffer B for calibration curve.\nCritical: Make sure to maintain mitochondria on ice all the time to avoid uncoupling.\nOCR measurement by clark-type electrode\nTiming: 1–2 h\nMeasurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in isolated mitochondria from mouse soleus in a Clark-type electrode (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nAdd 500 μL of respiration buffer to the electrode working chamber.\nNote: the electrode chamber volume may vary between Clark-type electrodes and proper volume should be calibrated to each individual instrument.\nAdd 30–100 μg of mitochondrial protein to the chamber.\nClose chamber (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/924-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Clark-type electrode. Closed chamber is shown\nClick GO to start recording the trace.\nAt 30 s inject one substrate and add a label (repeat it in each injection).\nNote: All injections should be performed with a Hamilton syringe to avoid opening the working chamber.",
    "0.5 mM malate + 50 μM palmitoyl-carnitine: 5 μL from a 50 mM malate stock + 5 μL from a 5 mM palmitoyl-carnitine stock.\n10 mM glutamate/malate: 10 μL from a 500 mM glutamate/malate stock.\n10 mM succinate: 10 μL from a 500 mM succinate stock\nCritical: using substrates in c. add 1 μM rotenone (5 μL from a 100 μM rotenone stock) before substrate injection to avoid retrograde electron transfer (RET) (Scialo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). Alternatively, following ADP addition, pyruvate (final concentration: 25 mM) may be added to allow a measurement of flux control ratio of fatty acids relative to pyruvate (see (Horscroft et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15])), followed by rotenone to consider RET.\nAt 2 min 30 s inject 250 μM ADP (5 μL from a 25 mM ADP stock).\nAllow all ADP to be converted in ATP and slope returns as it with substrates only.\nCritical: Respiratory Control Index (slope in state III (P) / slope in state II (L) (at saturating [ADP] and [Pi])) for glutamate/malate should be > 4 for healthy controls (see below). For Skm healthy controls, values < 3 indicates poor mitochondria coupling.\nAt 4 min 30 s inject 1 mM ADP (5 μL from a 100mM ADP stock).\nAt 5 min 30 s inject 5 μM oligomycin (5 μL from 500 μM oligomycin stock).\nAt 6 min 30 s inject 5 μM FCCP (5 μL from 500 μM FCCP stock)\nAt 7 min 30 s inject 1 μM antimycin A (5 μL from 100 μM antimycin A stock).\nAt 8 min 30 s stop measurement (click STOP button ) and save trace (click file, save as).

OCR measurement protocol",
    "Note: Allow sufficient time to permit the calculation of slopes in between injections. The time indicated here is flexible.\nRepeat steps 5–16 at least 3 times for each substrate.\nCritical: Consider a 10% of initial oxygen concentration limiting for proper measurement. Ensure to stop the experiment before oxygen becomes limiting.\nCritical: carefully clean Hamilton syringe twice with EtOH and H2O after each injection."
