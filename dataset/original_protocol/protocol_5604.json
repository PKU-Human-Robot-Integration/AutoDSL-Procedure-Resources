    "Ethical statement: Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD)/Wistar rats (10-12 weeks) were used in this protocol. All procedures involving animals follow the local animal ethics protocols and standards. Fast the rats for 12 h before the experiment.Anesthetize rats with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection using a 2 ml syringe with a needle.Note: Slightly press the paw of the rat, it indicates the rat is in deep anesthesia if there are no reflex actions of hind limb.Fix the rat on its back on a dissection board. Shave the fur of the ventral neck using curved ophthalmic scissors. Sterilize the shaved skin first with iodine tincture and then with 75% ethanol using cotton swabs (repeat three times) (Figure 3).Note: In order to minimize the risk of infections, thoroughly sterilize the dissection board with 75% alcohol before the surgery.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116000529_9098.jpgFigure 3. Rat fixed on a dissection board before the 2-VO surgeryUse operating scissors to make a midventral cervical incision in the middle of the neck in the upper edge of the sternum (about 1-1.5 cm long). Gently remove the submandibular gland using the ophthalmic forceps. This will expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle and sternohyoid muscle (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116000620_7894.jpgFigure 4. Image of the exposed sternocleidomastoid muscle (indicated by the thin arrow) and sternohyoid muscle (indicated by the thick arrow). Cut the skin, remove the tissues, and expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle and sternohyoid muscle.Carefully separate the common carotid arteries from the adhering tissues using ophthalmic forceps. Be careful and avoid causing any damage to the vagus nerve (Figures 5 and 6, Video 1).Note: Gently pull apart the sternocleidomastoid muscle deep in the sternohyoid muscle (until the sternohyoid muscle appears), there will be the common carotid arteria wrapped by fibrous connective tissue, which contains the vagus nerve in its sheath and pulses regularly.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116000734_4856.jpgFigure 5.",
    "Isolation of the common carotid arteryimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116000810_0555.jpgFigure 6. Schematic diagram of the Bilateral carotid artery. The arrows indicate the common carotid artery. This figure is adapted from Eszter Farkas et al. (2001).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Isolation of the common carotid artery The bilateral common carotid arteries are doubly ligated with 4-0 silk suture, the two sutures are next to each other, then the surgical wounds are sutured back with silk suture. Return the rat back to its cage until it fully recovers from anesthesia (Figure 7, Video 2).Notes:  The silk suture won’t be absorbed over time. They remain in place until it is executed. After surgery, feed the rat with an appropriate amount of penicillin to prevent infection. The rat is kept warm on the heating pad (37.0 ± 0.5 °C) throughout the surgery until the rat is completely awake. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180116/20180116001132_2763.jpgFigure 7.
