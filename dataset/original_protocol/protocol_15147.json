    "1. Pre-surgery \n Weigh Rose Bengal in an 1.5 ml tube and dissolve in sterile saline solution until reaching a final concentration of 15 mg/ml. Filter sterilize through a 0.2 μm filter and store it in the dark at room temperature up to two months. \n  \nSterilize all surgical instruments by autoclaving. The surgical area should be sanitized less than one hour before initiating the surgery.\nRecord the mouse body weight to adjust the dose of Rose Bengal to be injected. We injected 10 μl/g animal weight in female CD1 mice 12 weeks old in the present protocol. The amount of Rose Bengal needed to produce the desired cortical lesion size can be easily determined in a separate set of preliminary experiments by testing different dosages (typically 2 μl/g, 5 μl/g or 10 μl/g body weight). Note that the amount of Rose Bengal to be injected is highly dependent on the experiment conditions, particularly the type of light source used and the duration of light exposure. In the present study, 10 μl/g (150 μg/g) dose was found to be necessary to induce photothrombosis upon exposure to light for 15 min, whereas others groups reported that either 50 μg/g 6,8 and 100 μg/g10 intraperitoneal injection was sufficient for inducing a photothrombotic lesion.\n2. Anesthesia Procedure\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane in a transparent induction chamber (3.5-4% for induction, 1.5-2% for maintaining) in 50% (v/v) oxygen/50% (v/v) dinitrogen monoxide gas mixture. Gaseous anesthesia allows a quick wake up of the animals and the level of anesthetic gas can be adjusted easily. Alternatively, mice can also be anesthetized by a ketamine-xylazine mixture.",
    "When deep anaesthesia is reached, remove the anesthetized animal from the induction chamber, place it in the stereotaxic frame and maintain anesthesia using a face mask. Adjust the isoflurane dose to achieve an adequate anesthesia level. Monitor the breath rate throughout the procedure and make sure it is constant (40- 60 breaths per minute). \nUse toe pinches in order to ensure the animal is deeply anaesthetized. \nApply eye ointment, in order to prevent the eyes from drying out. \nGently insert the rectal probe to monitor the temperature throughout the surgical procedures. Set the associated feedback-controlled heating pad for maintaining the mouse body temperature at 37 ±  0.5 °C. \n3. Surgery for Illumination of the Target Area\nShave the mouse scalp with an electric razor. \nFirmly secure the head and insert the ear bars into external meatus. Be careful not to damage eardrums. \nDisinfect the skin on the surface with alternating swipes of 70% ethanol and betadine using cotton swabs. \nUse a scalpel to make an incision along the midline from the eye level down to the neck. Apply skin retractors to keep the skull exposed. \nGently retract the periostium to the edges of the skull with a scalpel and let the skull surface dry using sterile cotton swabs. Identify the bregma and lambda. Place a glass micropipette on the bregma as reference point, then move it to the coordinates of your region of interest. The region of interest chosen for this article is roughly roundly shaped, centered approximately 2 mm lateral to the bregma, and covering an area of about 30 mm2, which includes a large part of the sensorimotor cortex according to the mouse brain atlas by Franklin and Paxinos11.",
    "Mark the position of interest with reference points and put an optic fiber in close contact with the skull surface to avoid light scattering but pay attention not to exert pressure on it. The illuminated area can be restricted by applying on the skull a mask with small aperture or a cap at the tip of the optic fiber guide. \n4. Rose Bengal Injection and Activation\nLoad the Rose Bengal solution in a 1 ml syringe and calculate the amount to be injected according to a dose of 10 μl/g of body weight.\nProceed to a slow intraperitoneal injection.\nLet the dye diffuse and enter the blood stream. After 5 min, switch on the cold light illuminator. Avoid illumination of the animal by any other source of light. We used fiber optic illuminator of 150 W intensity. \nAfter 15 min of illumination, stop light exposure and suture the wound.\n    Five minutes of illumination already produce infarction and 10 min is likely sufficient to obtain a maximal effect12. In order to minimize variability, we choose to illuminate for 15 min. \n5. Suture\nRemove the skin retractors and apply sterile saline solution to avoid dehydration.  \nClose up the wound using reverse cutting needle and silk or nylon suture thread.\nInterrupt anesthesia delivery, carefully remove the mouse from the stereotaxic apparatus and put it on a pre-warmed heating pad until it is fully awake, then return it to its cage. Body temperature should be monitored carefully throughout the procedures to limit the variability in the infarct extension. According to the concentration and the route of administration, Rose Bengal can still be detected in the blood stream for several hours after injection13. Prefer the heating blanket to warming lamp to avoid potential secondary damages (Rose Bengal absorption wavelength is in the green spectrum).",
