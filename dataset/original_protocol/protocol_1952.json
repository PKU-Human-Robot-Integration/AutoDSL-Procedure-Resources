    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMeasuring death in MIN6 cells with live cell imaging\nTiming: 2 days, 22 h\nThis step describes how to trigger apoptotic cell death in MIN6 cells using staurosporine, thapsigargin and tunicamycin. Cell death is measured using live cell imaging with propidium iodide (PI). In this context, cells become positive for PI when their plasma membrane becomes permeable, indicating that a death program is activated in these cells.\nCell preparation and treatment:\nPlate MIN6 cells at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. For a 6-well tissue culture dish this is roughly equal to 500,000 cells / well. To adapt this protocol for other cells, this number will need to be optimized.\nAllow cells to recover overnight (∼16 h).\nBegin death treatment in the late afternoon of the following day (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Recommended death inducers and concentrations for β-cells include: the general inducer of cell death staurosporine (1 μM; (McKimpson et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11])) and the ER stress inducers thapsigargin (1 μM) and tunicamycin (5 ng/mL). Although shorter treatments can be performed, we recommend overnight (16 h) treatments at these concentrations.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1550-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Suggested experimental setup and imaging locations\nLeft: To obtain the most reproducible results across multiple experiments, we recommend a setup in which individual control and experimental replicates are alternated on a plate. This permits simultaneous imaging of both control and experimental samples so as not to skew experimental results due to length of experimental treatment or time out of cell culture incubator. Right: For imaging technical replicates in the same well, we suggest taking pictures in standardized locations that avoid both the center and outside edges of the well.",
    "Note: If pretreatments are to be included as conditions in the experiment, begin pretreatment 2 h prior to adding death stimuli. Examples of pretreatments that would inhibit β-cell death include pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk (200 μM) or the serine protease inhibitor AAT (0.5 mg/mL).\nStaining and imaging cells:\nWhen ready to perform live/dead imaging, add propidium iodide (PI) (dilute stock (1 mg/mL in H2O) 1:1000) and Hoechst 33342 (dilute stock 1:1000) directly to media. Gently swirl plate to mix.\nCritical: Do not wash cells between the end of treatment and performing live/dead imaging. This could skew final results as cells undergoing apoptosis may only be loosely attached to the cell culture plate.\nCritical: Samples are light-sensitive after adding PI and Hoechst 33342.\nIncubate cells for 5 min in the dark at 37°C.\nImage cells as described in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. Since the amount of death can vary based on the position in the well, we recommend imaging a minimum of 4 fields/well and averaging these values to minimize technical variation. Control wells should have few cells that stain positive for propidium iodide, whereas there should be a significant increase in PI+ cells in wells containing cells treated with a death inducer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Quantify dead cells by counting PI+, Hoechst+ cells and PI-, Hoechst+ cells. It is common for strongly PI+ cells to have weak Hoechst+ staining. Data can be presented as percentage PI+ cells / total (PI+, Hoechst+ and PI-, Hoechst+) cells. For sample quantification, please see Figures 2D and 2E of (McKimpson et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCritical: Cells must be imaged immediately after incubation as long-term exposure of Hoechst and PI is toxic to cells.",
    "Note: Propidium iodide does not detect cell death optimally in response to palmitate. We suggest using TUNEL as an alternative.\nNote: Propidium iodide will also label cells undergoing necrotic cell death. Since β-cells mainly undergo apoptosis, this is not a confounding factor here. However, if this is a concern, PI can be omitted, and condensed nuclei measured using Hoeschst staining alone.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1550-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Live/dead imaging in MIN6 cells\nTo induce death, cells were treated for 16 h with 5 ng/mL Tunicamycin. Propidium Iodide demarcates cells that no longer have an intact plasma membrane and DAPI counterstains nuclei. Scale bar is 50 μm.\nTUNEL in MIN6 cells\nTiming: 4 days, 22 h\nThis step describes how to measure cell death in fixed MIN6 cells by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). This method is a second way to measure activation of cell death machinery and measures DNA fragmentation. In addition, this method of detection can be used to measure death after treatment with palmitate.\nCell preparation.\nCulture cells directly onto 6-well tissue culture plates (Fisher, cat# FB012927), without further coating of the plates or use of a coverslip. Begin with cells > 70% confluent as some cells will be lost during staining. Cells will be especially easy to detach after death treatment.\nBegin death treatment as described above in step 1c[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] of the Step-by-step method details.\nPrepare staining reagents.\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and cell permeabilization solution (see “Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section for recipes).\nUsing the Fluorescein In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche), make TUNEL reaction mixture as recommend by manufacturer[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/417/021/11684795910bul.pdf].\nSpecifically, remove 100 μL of label solution (reaction mix) and place in separate tube. This will be used as a label-only negative control.",
    "Perform a quick spin with tube containing enzyme solution to get all the liquid contents to the bottom of the tube.\nSubsequently, remove 50 μL of enzyme solution (entire contents) from its tube and add this to the remaining 400 μL of label solution (entire contents) in the original label solution tube.\nCritical: TUNEL reaction mixture is light-sensitive and should be kept on ice in the dark.\nCell fixation and TUNEL staining.\nAfter completion of cell treatment, carefully wash cells three times with 1× PBS.\nFix cells with 4% PFA for 10 min at 20°C.\nNote: This step and the following wash/permeabilization should be performed in a chemical hood as PFA is toxic.\nNote: PFA should be at 20°C when placed on cells.\nWash cells with 1× PBS.\nPermeabilize cells with cell permeabilization solution for 5 min at 20°C.\nAdd previously prepared TUNEL solution (label + enzyme) to sample making sure that the entire sample is covered with solution. If using a 6-well plate, add approximately 100 μL the center of each well.\nAdd label solution alone to at least 1 sample to include as a negative control.\nTreat at least one sample with DNAse for the positive control.\nIncubate cells for 1 h in the dark at 37°C. To prevent drying, make sure that the samples are covered and/or in a hydrophobic chamber.\nCritical: Samples are light-sensitive after adding TUNEL solution.\nPrepare cells for imaging and counterstain with DAPI.\nWash cells with 1× PBS for 5 min × 2.\nWash cells with 1× PBS-T for 5 min, 1 time.",
    "Coverslip samples using mounting media with DAPI (VECTASHIELD Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI, cat# H-1800-10) and glass coverslips (Corning, cat# 284518). For this, in the center of each well of the 6-well culture plate, first place a drop of mounting media directly on top of the fixed cells. Then, place a glass coverslip in the center of each well on top of the mounting media, being careful to avoid creating bubbles.\nFollow the methods described above (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) to image and quantify samples for TUNEL staining. For sample quantification, please see Figure 2F of McKimpson et al. Dev Cell 2021. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nPause point: If placed in the dark at 4°C, cells can be successfully imaged for up to 1 week before fluorescence signal fades. We recommend imaging 1 day after staining.\nTUNEL in isolated pancreatic islets\nTiming: 8 days, 22 h\nThis step describes how to adapt the TUNEL protocol described above for primary mouse islets. This includes treatment of islets with a death stimulus, fixing and embedding tissue for frozen sectioning, TUNEL staining of islet sections, and subsequent imaging.\nPrepare and treat islets.\nHand pick islets using a P20 pipet with a P10 (barrier) tip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). It is important to select for only the most pure, best looking islets. They are 50–250 μm in diameter, but the islets ∼150 μm are the best to work with. The average islet yield from a 3–5 month old C57Bl/6 is about 100–200 islets/mouse.\nPlace 150–200 islets / well in a 12-well non-tissue culture treated plate.\nNote: Islets will adhere to the bottom of plate if placed in a tissue culture treated dish.\nResuspend islets in 1 mL culture media (or control/treatment media if performing palmitate treatment).",
    "Treat islets with death stimulus. Recommended death inducers and concentrations for isolated islets include the ER stressor thapsigargin (1 μM; Fisher Scientific) for 24 h and 1.2 mM Palmitate (preparation described above) for 3 days.\nPrepare islets for frozen sectioning.\nPrepare 4% PFA (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nUpon completion of treatment, use a P1000 pipet to collect the contents of each well (islets/media) in a separate 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 100 g at 20°C to collect the islets at the bottom of the tube.\nCarefully discard supernatant and wash islets with 1 mL 1× PBS.\nFix islets by resuspending in 300 μL 4% PFA and rotate tubes for 10 min at 4°C.\nIn chemical hood, add 1 mL 1× PBS to each tube.\nCentrifuge tubes for 3 min at 100 g.\nIn chemical hood, discard supernatant in PFA waste container.\nWash islets with 1 mL 1× PBS.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 100 g at 20°C to collect the islets at the bottom of the tube.\nCarefully discard supernatant, leaving only ∼50 μL of PBS in the tube.\nUsing a P200 pipet, resuspend islets and transfer to the center of a cryomold.\nWait for islets to sink to the bottom of the mold.\nFlash freeze on dry ice.\nWhile cryomold (with frozen islets) is placed on dry ice, slowly and sequentially add OCT to the mold, beginning on the outer edges, working in towards the islet.\nOnce the mold is fully filled with OCT, allow OCT to freeze completely.\nWrap block in foil and place in −80°C freezer.\nPause point: As long as the block is protected, block may be placed in −80°C freezer prior to sectioning.\nUsing cryostat, prepare 5 μm tissue sections.",
    "Note: Islets should be located very near the bottom of the block. Use a microscope while trimming frozen block to avoid losing the sample.\nPause point: Completed slides can be placed at −80°C until ready to perform staining.\nPerform TUNEL staining.\nPrepare TUNEL reagents (see step #4).\nAllow slides to acclimate to 20°C (from −80°C) for 10 min.\nPlace slides in slide holder and submerge in 1× PBS.\nWash in 1× PBS on shaker for 3 min.\nPlace in new 1× PBS and perform two more washes on shaker for 3 min each.\nAdd previously prepared TUNEL solution (label + enzyme) to slide, by adding dropwise to each tissue section. For slides ∼75 μL is needed for each slide.\nAdd label solution alone (no TdT) to at least 1 sample to include as a negative control in the experiment.\nSlides can be treated with DNAseI for positive control.\nTo distribute TUNEL solution evenly, cover each slide with a rectangular coverslip (Corning, cat# 2975245).\nPlace slides in hydrophobic chamber and incubate for 1 h in the dark at 37°C.\nCritical: Samples are light-sensitive after adding TUNEL solution.\nGently remove coverslip by place slide vertical in container filled with 1× PBS. Coverslip will come off by itself as the slide is pulled up. Allow gravity to remove coverslip. If the coverslip does not automatically slide off, let the slide sit in the 1× PBS for 30 s and then attempt to remove the coverslip a second time. To aid in removal of the coverslip, it is ok to gently move the slide up and down in 1× PBS.\nCritical: Do not force coverslips off by using hands to grab them as this may damage the tissue.\nCoverslipping with DAPI.\nWash slides with 1× PBS for 5 min × 2.",
    "Wash slides with 1× PBS-T for 5 min, 1 time.\nCoverslip slides with mounting media with DAPI (VECTASHIELD Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI, cat# H-1800-10) and rectangular coverslips.\nImage samples.

TUNEL staining in isolated islets\nIsolated islets were treated 3d with 1.2 mM palmitate. To inhibit cell death, islets were pretreated with 0.5 mg/mL purified human AAT or 0.2 mg/mL elastase inhibitor (Elas Inh 1) 2 h prior to initiation of death stimulus. After completion of death treatment, islets were fixed, embedded in OCT, and sectioned. White arrow denotes TUNEL+ cell. DAPI counterstains nuclei. Scale bar is 50 μm.

To adapt this protocol to frozen tissue sections, omit the deparaffinization, antigen retrieval, and proteinase K treatment steps. This protocol also includes a coimmunostain for insulin, a β-cell marker. Note that if staining with another cell marker is desired, it may be necessary to switch the order of immunostaining and TUNEL staining as some antibody staining may not be able to withstand the proteinase K treatment step.\nPrepare pancreatic tissue from mice.\nDissect entire pancreas from desired mouse model using the spleen to grab the tissue so that the pancreas is not damaged.\nThoroughly wash pancreas with ice-cold 1× PBS.\nTo fix tissue, in chemical hood, place pancreas in 50 mL tube containing 5 mL 4% PFA.\nPlace tube containing tissue at 4°C for 16 h.",
