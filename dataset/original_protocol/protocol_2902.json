    "Critical: Compound 4 as shown in [Reaction equation 4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2646-Mmc1.extension]] should be stored in a moisture-controlled container at −80°C because it is very sensitive to moisture and will degrade as the result of self-reaction by phenol-OH on naltrexamine moiety. We recommend using compound 4 promptly in the next step.\nConjugation of NAI-AK with Alexa594 azide using copper (I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAA) click chemistry.\nThis step is designed to bring in a reporter to the guided ligand naltrexamine.

These exceptional properties of click reaction allow the conjugation of NAI-AK to a reporter with minimal byproducts. Alexa594 azide (AFdye 594 azide from Click Chemistry Tools) was used here as an example to generate NAI-A594 (see Reaction equation 5[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2646-Mmc1.extension]).\nDissolve Alexa594 azide (1 mg, 1.16 μmol) in 450 mL anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).\nAdd tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine (TBTA, 19 mg, 36 μmol) and tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) tetrafluoroborate (Cu[MeCN]4BF4, 8 mg, 27 μmol).\nCritical: Since the initial publication,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we notice the intermediate naltrexamine-acylimdazole-alkyne (NAI-AK, compound 4) is very unstable in aqueous solution. The click reaction to conjugate fluorescent dyes is therefore done in anhydrous DMSO and tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) tetrafluoroborate is used as a catalyst instead of CuSO4 and ascorbate.\nDissolve compound 4 (2.5 mg, 3.78 μmol) in 450 mL anhydrous DMSO and add to the mixture from b.\nStir overnight (12–18 h) under argon.",

This value is important for concentration calculations, which is used to determine the total yield and the amount of material (in μL) when aliquoting into smaller portions for storage.\nAliquot in 20 nmol portions and lyophilize.\nNote: The scale of this synthesis is based on the commercially availability of 1 mg of the dye. Generally, < 1 mg of product is obtained. Weighing out for making a working stock solution is not practical. The best way to get the proper amount of product for easy use and storage is thus relying on their maximal absorption and the known extinction coefficient. We find that 20 nmol material is sufficient for most applications and that the stock and working solution will be consumed within a practicable time.\nCritical: The small aliquot of 20 nmol dried compound should be stored at −20°C with humidity control.

    "Timing: 2 days (for step 6)\nTiming: ∼3 days (For step 7)\nOptimization of the concentration and time used for NAI-X labeling can be guided by labeled cells’ fluorescent signal to background ratio (i.e., labeled in the presence of a blocking ligand such as naloxone). For many experimental applications, we have found that a sub-saturating concentration close to EC50 of NAI-X is adequate to efficiently label the receptor. However, a new assay scheme (i.e., new conjugated fluorophore or cell type) may require re-optimization of NAI-X labeling conditions. Ultimately, decision making for NAI-X labeling protocols can be influenced by OR expression levels, fluorescent dyes, and sensitivity of the detection methods required by the experimental question. For general purposes, NAI-X concentrations can range from 10 nM to 500 nM with incubation timing of 1–4 h depending on concentration of the compound and temperature. Therefore, a concentration response curve is performed to identify optimal labeling conditions.

The tool allows a small usage of NAI-X while maintaining healthy brain slices during labeling, and thus can be used in subsequent functional assays e.g., electrophysiological recording and receptor internalization.\nMake an incubating vial using a 10-mL syringe, a small piece of mesh fabric (2 × 2 inches) and a 30-mL scintillation vial (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCut the tip of 10-mL syringe near the 3 mL mark.\nStretch the net cloth over the opening, secure the cloth with rubber band (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nUse cyanoacrylate glue (Krazy glue) to fix mesh fabric to barrel of syringe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCut and remove the excess fabric material (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nHandle of transfer pipet can be used as a convenient cap (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).\nAdd 4 mL ACSF buffer into the scintillation vial and set up the tool as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E.\nInsert a small tube for bubbling carbogen gas (5% carbon dioxide + 95% oxygen).\nNote: The bubbling tube is outside net chamber, see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F.\nAdd 4 μL of NAI-X to the vial. The concentration of NAI-X is 100 nM.\nMix well.\nDrop a brain slice inside the net chamber, Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G and 3H.\nCaution: More than one slice can be placed in the chamber, but they should not be stacked on top of each other.\nIncubate brain slices for 1 h at 30°C–34°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nCaution: To avoid cell death during this step, be careful not to bubble too close and cause brain slices to swirl.",
    "Note: NAI-A594 is a good choice for two-photon microscopy because Alexa594 dye has a high two-photon absorption at 810 nm.\nNote: Similar to cell culture experiments, we recommend using naloxone to confirm specific labeling of ORs. When included in labeling solution of NAI-A594, there will be negligible fluorescent signals on brain slices. Naloxone can also be used to displace residual NAI-A594 in the binding pocket.\nCaution: If labeled neurons are subjected for further functional assays, it is important to ensure that naloxone used after labeling is completely washed out with ACSF buffer prior to experiments. Antagonist property of naloxone will hinder the action of test drugs.\nRemove a labeled slice and submerge it under ACSF in a petri dish.\nTake slices to a macroscope to visualize labeled receptors on large brain areas.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2646-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Visualization of labeled ORs in the acute (live) slices of striatum with different microscopes\n(A, B, D, and E) A macro zoom Olympus microscope was used to depict localization of labeled ORs in large areas (A, B, D, & E). Labeling of striatal patches was lacking when CTAP, a MOR selective antagonist was included (B).\n(C and F) Detailed staining along plasma membrane of neurons were photographed by a confocal or 2-photon microscope.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: We used a Macro Zoom Olympus MVX10 microscope and a MV PLAPO2xC, NA 0.5 lens (Olympus) to visualize and capture images. A yellow LED (567 nm) is used for excitation of Alexa 594 dye. (See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for examples).\nTake the labeled slice to a 2-photon microscope to visualize labeled receptors on a neuron.\nSubmerge slice in continuous flow of oxygenated ACSF at 34°C.\nNote: A perfusion system provides a convenient way for drug application and washing steps.",
    "Take images using a 60× water immersion lens (Olympus LUMFI, NA 1.1) and laser at 810 nm excitation.\nLabeling of opioid receptors for fixed brain slices.\nThese steps describe NAI-X labeling for fixed tissues.\nPrepare brain slices as shown in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section.\nIncubate brain slices in oxygenated ACSF containing NAI-X at a final concentration of 30 or 100 nM for 1 h at 30°C–34°C.\nWash the labeled slices, 2 × 10 mL in ACSF.\nAdd 4% formaldehyde to labeled slices in Petri Dish.\nNote: The volume of 4% formaldehyde can be varied depending on the size of petri dish. Slices should be completely submerged under the fixative solution.\nShake slices in a Petri dish using a rotator for 20 min.\nWash fixed slices in a saline-phosphate buffer twice.\nNote: The volume of saline-phosphate can be varied depending on the size of petri-dish. Again slices should be completely submerged under buffer.\nMount fixed slices using an antifade mounting medium (for examples: Prolong™, or Vectashield).\nCapture images using a confocal microscope. The example images (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) shown in this protocol were captured with a 20× air lens (Zeiss Plan Apochromic, NA 0.8) on a Zeiss LSM 980 with Airyscan 2 at 553 nm excitation and 568 nm emission.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2646-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.
