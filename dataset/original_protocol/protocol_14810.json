    "All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n1. Orthotopic Pancreatic Tumor Mouse Modeling\nCulture standard human pancreatic-cancer cell lines in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Maintain all cultures at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.\nUse 8-10 week-old female severe combined immunodeficient mice. Place animal cages at 12 hr light and 12 hr darkness cycle at RT (21 ± 2 °C) and 60% humidity.\nAnesthetize all animals using ventilation with 2% of isoflurane mixed with oxygen (2 L/min) throughout surgery. Confirm the depth of anesthesia by toe pinch reflex. Place animals on a heating pad (37 °C) to maintain the body temperature. Apply veterinary ophthalmic ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.  \nRemove the hair in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen of each mouse, and give an analgesic drug (carpofen, 5 mg/kg of body weight subcutaneously) into the area. Apply a betadine solution to the exposed skin. Prepare autoclaved surgical instruments.\nMake a 1 cm incision in the skin and peritoneum using iris straight scissors. Gently remove the pancreas from the abdomen using surgical tweezers.\nInsert 28 G needle of a 0.5 ml insulin syringe into the tail of pancreas and then slowly infuse a solution of 2.5 million human pancreatic cancer cells in 30 µl of DMEM. Confirm that a small bleb is created in the head of pancreas by the solution.",
    "Gently place the pancreas back into the abdomen using surgical tweezers. Close the peritoneum and the skin in 1 layer with 2 interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures, and then terminate the anesthesia. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered. Remove sutures at 7~10 days post surgery.\nGive another dose of the analgesic drug (carpofen, 5 mg/kg of body weight subcutaneously) at 24 hr after surgery.\nCheck tumor size by palpating the surgery area using two fingers. Tumors typically feel denser and bumpier than the surrounding tissues and organs. Usually it takes ~1 - 2 weeks to start feeling a tumor.\nMonitor animals daily for signs of illness. When animals appear ill (lack normal grooming and avoidance behaviors), we terminated them using cervical dislocation while under anesthesia.\n2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nApply MRI when tumor size is about 5 - 7 mm in diameter at usually 2~4 weeks after cell implantation. Use an MR scanner dedicated to small animal imaging or a clinical MR scanner equipped with a specialized coil for small animal imaging.\n\tNOTE: We used a 9.4T small animal MR scanner with a combination of a 1H volume resonator/transmitter and a surface coil receiver (30 mm in diameter)(Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA). A surface coil provides better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)14.\nPrepare a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent to inject ~0.1 - 0.2 mmol/kg to each animal in ~0.1 - 0.2 ml PBS (phosphate buffered saline).\n\tNOTE: We used gadoteridol, and injected 0.2 mmol/kg in 0.15 ml PBS over a period of 15 sec (0.1 ml/sec).",
    "Prepare a micro-polyethelene tube (length: 7.62 mm, inner diameter: 0.28 mm, outer diameter: 0.64 mm). Insert a 30 G needle (12.7 mm length) into one end of the tube, and a 30 G blunt tip needle (9.5 mm length) into the other end. Connect a 1 ml syringe containing MR contrast agent to the blunt tip needle, and slowly push the syringe to fill up the entire tube with the MR contrast agent.\nAnesthetize animals using ventilation with ~1 - 2% of isoflurane mixed with oxygen (2 L/min) throughout preparation and imaging. Confirm the depth of anesthesia by toe pinch reflex. Apply veterinary ophthalmic ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Dilate the tail vein using a heat lamp before needle insertion. Grab the middle of the 30 G needle using Kelly forceps, and insert it into the tail vein. Tape both the tail and tube onto a piece of plastic or cardboard paper (10 mm width x 100 mm length) to keep the tail straight.\nPlace the animal in supine position in an animal bed equipped with circulating warm water (or warm air) to regulate body temperature during imaging. Set the temperature on the bed to 37 °C. Insert a rectal temperature probe to monitor the body temperature during imaging.\nApply an orthogonally bent plastic board into the abdominal area. Make sure the tumor is located behind the upper end of the board, and then pull down the board slightly (~2 mm) to ensure the tumor is caught by the board. Tape the board to animal bed firmly.",
    "Tape a respiration pad transducer (SA Instrument, Inc., Stony Brook, NY)  on the chest area to monitor animal respiration during imaging. Place a surface coil on the top of the tumor region, and tape it to animal bed firmly. Push the animal bed into the MR scanner to place the tumor region at the center of the volume coil (inner diameter: 72 mm).\nPerform matching and tuning for both the receiver and transmitter, followed by shimming.\nBegin with an anatomical MR sequence to locate the tumor. Use a T2-weighted (T2W) turbo spin-echo sequence to obtain axial images with the following acquisition parameters. Repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 3,000/34 msec, 128 x 128 matrix, 30 x 30 mm field of view, number of averages = 1, echo train length = 4, and 20 contiguous 1 mm thick slices in an interlaced mode to cover the entire tumor region (total scanning time: 1.6 min).\n\tNOTE: Since orthotopic pancreatic tumors are more difficult to be located than subcutaneous ones, conventional localizer images having lower resolution may not be useful.\nAcquire T1-weighted (T1W) images with various flip angles to retrieve T1 map. For this purpose, use a gradient echo multiflip angle approach with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 115/3 msec, 128 x 128 matrix, a 30 x 30 mm field of view, number of averages = 4, ~5 - 7 contiguous 1 mm thick slices in an interlaced mode to cover the tumor region, and seven flip angles of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 (total scanning time per flip angle: 1 min).\n\tNOTE: However, multiflip angle approach is efficient only when B1 field homogeneity is high. If not, T1 maps can be obtained with multiple TR approach instead15.",
    "Acquire T1W images before and after gadolinium based MR contrast injection. Use the same acquisition parameters and geometry for T1 mapping but with the fixed flip angle of 30. Use linear encoding to ensure steady state when the center of k-space is obtained, especially when a short TR and a low degree flip angle are used. Acquire 5 baseline images before contrast injection. Then acquire 40 images after contrast injection (total scanning time: 45 min). Use a syringe pump to inject contrast agent at a constant rate (0.01 ml/sec).\nMonitor animal breathing continuously, and adjust isoflurane concentration to keep the respiratory rate to 50 - 100 breaths per min. Monitor animal body temperature throughout imaging.\nAfter completing DCE-MRI, take off the needle and other probes, and place the animal in an empty cage bedded with paper towels.  Massage softly the lower abdominal area.  The cage should be placed half under a heat lamp to allow the animal to move in and out of the heat gradient as it recovers.  Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n3. Image Processing and Analysis\nSegment tumor region in T2W images. In T2W images, the signal intensity in tumor region is brighter than that of surrounding tissues, so the tumor boundary can be manually delineated.\n\tNOTE: Semi-automatic segmentation techniques such as global thresholding or active contouring can be used16,17, but uneven background intensity should be corrected especially when a surface coil is used.\nCreate T1 and proton density maps. In T1W images acquired with a gradient echo sequence, assuming that echo time (TE) is much less than T2* value, the pixel value is determined by\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52641/52641eq1.jpg",
    "where S0 is proton density, T1 is T1 relaxation time constant, TR is repetition time, and θ is a flip angle. Equation (1) can be rewritten to\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52641/52641eq2.jpg\n\twhen S(θ)/sinθ is replaced with Y, and  S(θ)/tanθ is replaced with X. Equation (2) is a linear equation, and its slope and intercept can be used to retrieve T1 and S0 values, respectively.\nCalculate MR contrast concentration in DCE-MR images. When gadolinium based MR contrast agent is injected, T1 relaxation time constant is changed over time. So, equation (1) can be rewritten to\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52641/52641eq3.jpg\n\tT1(t) is related with MR contrast concentration, C(t), as follows,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52641/52641eq4.jpg\n\twhere r1 is longitudinal relaxivity of MR contrast agent. So, by combining equations (3) and (4), MR contrast concentration is determined by\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52641/52641eq5.jpg\nQuantitate the pharmacokinetic parameters of MR contrast agent. Cp(t) presents MR contrast concentration in blood plasma at time t after initiating contrast injection. Cp(t) is called arterial input function (AIF). If AIF is available, the pharmacokinetic parameters of MR contrast agent can be calculated by\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52641/52641eq6.jpg\n\twhere Ct(t) is MR contrast concentration in a target tissue, vp is fractional blood plasma volume, ve is fractional extravascular extracellular volume, and Ktrans is volume transfer constant. Flux rate constant, kep, is equal to Ktrans divided by ve. If AIF is not available, then the reference region model can be used instead18,19. The reference region model is based on the flow-limited Kety model20 and uses contrast concentration in a reference region to remove the need for AIF as follows,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52641/52641eq7.jpg",
    "where Ct,ROI(t), Ktrans,ROI, and ve,ROI are contrast concentration, volume transfer constant, and fractional extravascular-extracellular volume, respectively, in the region of interest (ROI), while Ct,RR(t), Ktrans,RR, and ve,RR are those in the reference region. Paravertebral muscle is often selected as the reference region, and ve,RR in murine paravertebral muscle is assumed to be constant at 0.08 21. We used the reference region model.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
