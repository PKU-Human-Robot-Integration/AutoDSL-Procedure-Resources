Patient-derived biopsies (obtained under informed consent) are enzymatically and mechanically dissociated into small clumps and single cells. The resultant suspension is mixed with Matrigel, and droplets are deposited in a 48-well culture plate. After adding OCOM, organoids develop, grow and expand.\nThe OC tissue biopsy is collected in a conical tube with 10 mL collection medium on ice and processed immediately.\nThe tissue is transferred to a Petri dish in the biological safety cabinet and rinsed extensively with 5 mL PBS using a plastic transfer pipet to wash away blood and FBS.\nRepeat the rinsing until the PBS becomes clear.\nThe tumor biopsy is split into three parts, i.e., one for cryopreservation, one for fixation/histology and one for organoid formation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). If the biopsy is small (≤ 5 mm3), it is recommended to use the complete tissue for organoid formation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/556-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Processing of the OC biopsy\nTissue in collection medium is transferred to a Petri dish. The biopsy is rinsed multiple times with PBS and then cut with a scalpel into small pieces, which are subjected to further dissociation (for organoid development), fixation (for immunohistological analysis) and cryopreservation.\nNote: For PFA fixation of primary tumor (to perform immunohistological analysis; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nCut a piece (∼4 mm3) of the tumor tissue using a scalpel.\nWith a plastic transfer pipet, transfer the tissue piece to a 15 mL conical tube containing 3 mL of 4% PFA.\nIncubate 15–20 h on ice for tissue fixation.\nNext day, remove the PFA using a plastic transfer pipet.\nAdd 5 mL PBS to rinse the sample.",
    "Place the tube on a shaking plate with mild shaking for 15 min.\nRemove the PBS.\nRepeat step e to g twice.\nAdd 2 mL Ethanol 70%.\nPause Point: The tissue can be stored in EtOH 70% at 4°C until further processing (not longer than 6 months).\nMince the rest of the biopsy into small pieces (pieces of 1–2 mm3) using a scalpel.\nRinse again repeatedly with 3 mL PBS until the fluid becomes clear.\nNote: For cryopreservation of primary tissue (after mincing)\nAdd 1 mL of cryopreservation medium into one cryovial.\nAdd ± 10 pieces of tissue per vial and keep on ice.\nPlace the cryovials in a cryobox as soon as possible and freeze 15–20 h at −80°C.\nTransfer the cryovials the following day to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nCollect all remaining tissue pieces into a 30 mL conical tube with 8 mL dissociation medium and incubate in a 37°C water bath for 1–2 h.\nEvery 20 min, mechanically assist the enzymatic dissociation by pipetting the sample up and down with a glass Pasteur pipet to break up bulky clumps. When large pieces are no longer present, further dissociate the clumps every 20 min using a Pasteur pipet narrowed by fire-polishing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/556-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Fire-polishing of the glass Pasteur pipet\nThe pipet is exposed to a Bunsen flame while constantly rotated (left panel) until its edges are polished and the opening narrowed down to about half its original diameter (right panel; opening before (left) and after (right)).\nAdd 50 μL DNase (0.2 mg/mL) to the suspension and incubate for 1 min at 20°C–22°C.\nStop the enzymatic activity by adding ice-cold 8 mL DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS.",
    "In case of remaining fragments, filter the solution through a 70 μm cell strainer to collect the dissociated cells (together with some small cell clumps left). The persisting large tissue fragments on the cell strainer should be discarded.\nCritical: Remaining large tissue pieces should be discarded, as they do not give rise to organoids and will lead to more cell death after plating in the Matrigel droplet.\nCentrifuge the filtered suspension at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL DMEM/F12 (20°C–22°C) and transfer the suspension to an Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL DMEM/F12 (20°C–22°C).\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer. The (few) remaining small cell clumps can be ignored for counting.\nNote: After this step, primary tissue cells can be collected for RNA and DNA extraction.\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCalculate the number of wells that can be plated with 30,000 cells per 20 μL droplet at one droplet per well.\nTake off the correct amount of supernatant and resuspend in ice-cold Matrigel to obtain a ratio of 70% Matrigel/30% cell suspension (in DMEM/F12) for plating; keep on ice.\nFor instance, if 600,000 cells are present in the suspension, calculate for 20 droplets each containing 30,000 cells. 20 droplets of 20 μL make 400 μL. Hence, leave 120 μL of the cell suspension in the Eppendorf tube, resuspend the pellet and add 280 μL of Matrigel.\nCritical: Avoid making air bubbles by slowly mixing the cell suspension and Matrigel. Place the Eppendorf tube on ice to keep the Matrigel liquid.\nDispense 20 μL droplets per well in a pre-warmed 48-well culture plate.",
    "Put the plate upside down in the 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 20 min to allow the Matrigel to solidify and ensure in-gel distribution of the cells (i.e., avoid sedimentation at the bottom).\nPrewarm OCOM in a 37°C water bath.\nAdd RI (10 μM) to the medium.\nCritical: Add RI to prevent anoikis in order to improve cell viability and organoid formation efficiency.\nAdd 250 μL warm OCOM to each well and return the plate to the 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.\nRefresh the culture medium every 2–3 days (without RI).\nNote: The organoids develop and grow steadily over time (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), in a timespan depending on patient tumor (typically, within 2–4 weeks).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/556-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Organoid development from OC\nRepresentative brightfield images are shown at different days (d) after seeding. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nPassaging OC organoids\nTiming: 2–3 h\nOrganoids are passaged when they are fully formed, i.e., reaching a diameter of around 200–300 μm and achieving appropriate confluency (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The split ratio is 1:3 to 1:5 for a 48-well culture plate, according to organoid confluency.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/556-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Confluent organoid cultures in a well of a 48-well culture plate, ready to be passaged\nRepresentative brightfield images are shown. Scale bar, 200 μm. Regarding the different morphologies, see “expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]”.\nPlace the required number of Matrigel aliquots on ice to thaw.\nRemove the medium from the wells with organoids that need to be split.\nWithin the same culture condition, you can pool the organoids from up to 4 confluent wells.\nAdd 400 μL of ice-cold DMEM/F12 per well and pipette with a p1000 tip up and down multiple times to release the organoids from the Matrigel.\nGently scratch the bottom of the well with the pipette tip, to help detach the Matrigel.\nAvoid making bubbles, although do pipet vigorously enough.",
    "If multiple wells are pooled, transfer the 400 μL from the first well to the next (and so on) to release the organoids from the Matrigel of all wells to be pooled.\nCollect the resuspended organoids in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and put on ice.\nRinse all wells from which organoids were collected once with 400 μL DMEM/F12.\nDouble-check the wells of the culture plate under the light microscope to ensure that all organoids are collected. If not, rinse again with 400 μL DMEM/F12.\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPrewarm an aliquot of TrypLE Express (supplemented with RI at 10 μM) in a 37°C water bath. 500 μL TrypLE is needed per Eppendorf tube of organoids.\nCarefully remove the supernatant from the pelleted organoids.\nAdd 500 μL of prewarmed TrypLE to each Eppendorf tube containing the organoid pellet. Swirl tubes gently so that organoids are mixed with the TrypLE.\nIncubate in a 37°C water bath for 10 min (dense organoids; see below) or 5 min (low-cohesive and cystic organoids; see below).\nAdd 500 μL of ice-cold DMEM/F12 to inactivate TrypLE activity.\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant.\nResuspend the organoid pellet in 700 μL ice-cold DMEM/F12.\nPlace a P200 tip (no filter) over a P1000 tip (with filter) and pipet up and down for 25 times to mechanically disrupt the organoids.\nNote: Adjust the volume of the pipette so that most of the medium volume (with organoids) is aspirated without air to avoid making bubbles.\nNote: Check under the light microscope whether single cells are obtained. If some undispersed structures remain (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), further apply mechanical dissociation to obtain individual cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/556-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Dissociation of OC organoids",
    "When undispersed organoid structures are still present (as shown), further mechanical disruption is needed to eventually obtain single cells. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL DMEM/F12 (20°C–22°C).\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.\nCalculate the number of wells that can be plated and the amount of cell suspension and Matrigel needed as described above (step 18 of organoid establishment).\nResuspend the pellet in 70% Matrigel and keep on ice.\nDispense 20 μL droplets, containing 30,000 cells per well, in a pre-warmed 48-well culture plate.\nIncubate the plate upside down in the 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 20 min.\nMeanwhile, pre-warm OCOM in a 37°C water bath.\nAdd RI (10 μM) to the medium.\nAdd 250 μL warm OCOM to each well and return the plate to the 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.\nRefresh the culture medium every 2–3 days and passage the organoids again at confluence (i.e., every 14–28 days).\nNote: Some organoid lines are passageable for a long period (up to one year and more), while other lines show short-term passeagability (up to 4 passages, i.e., 8–16 weeks), which depends on the patient tumor. Organoids keep characteristics during passaging.\nCryopreserving OC organoids\nTiming: 1 h\nFollow the passaging protocol until step 37.\nAfter centrifugation, resuspend the pellet in 1 mL cryopreservation medium, transfer into a cryovial and put on ice.\nThe cryovial may contain organoids from 1 to 4 confluent wells.\nPlace the cryovials in a cryobox and transfer to −80°C.\nThe next day, transfer the samples to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nThawing OC organoids\nTiming: 2 h\nRemove the cryovial form the liquid nitrogen tank and put on ice. Immediately proceed with the thawing protocol.",
    "Thaw the solution with the cryopreserved OC organoids in a 37°C water bath for maximum 2 min.\nTransfer the content to a 15 mL conical tube with ice-cold 10 mL DMEM/F12/10% FBS.\nRinse the cryovial with 1 mL DMEM F12/10% FBS to ensure that all pieces are recovered and transferred.\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL ice-cold DMEM/F12.\nTransfer the suspension to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge at 220 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL ice-cold DMEM/F12.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.\nCalculate the number of wells that can be plated and the amount of cell suspension and Matrigel needed as described above (step 18 of organoid establishment).\nResuspend the pellet in 70% Matrigel and keep on ice.\nDispense 20 μL droplets, containing 30,000 cells per well, in a pre-warmed 48-well culture plate.\nIncubate the plate upside down in the 37°C/5% CO2 incubator for 20 min.\nMeanwhile, pre-warm OCOM in a 37°C water bath.\nAdd RI (10 μM) to the medium.\nAdd 250 μL warm OCOM to each well and return the plate to the 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.\nRefresh the culture medium every 2–3 days and passage the organoids again at confluence (i.e., every 14–28 days).\nNote: The growing efficiency of cryopreserved OC organoid lines following thawing is 100%.\nFixing OC organoids in PFA\nTiming: 30 min\nRemove the medium from the wells with organoids that need to be analyzed.\nAdd 400 μL of ice-cold DMEM/F12 to the well, and per well pipette with a p1000 tip up and down multiple times to release the organoids from the Matrigel.\nNote: Organoids from multiple wells can be pooled.",
