    "General considerations:\nFrom step1, never use vortex. Until step 5, pipetting is not required. Then, use wide bore tips for pipetting. Always gently invert tubes for mixing. Minimize the movement when transferring from a tube to another one.\nPrepare lysis buffer:\nAlways use fresh buffer: TrisHCl 114mM, EDTA 115mM, NaCl 571mM, 1.14% PVP40.\nAdd 0.5ml TrisHCl 1M, 0.5ml EDTA 0.5M, 0.5ml NaCl 5M, 0.05g PVP40 and 2.875ml Ultrapure nuclease-free water. Mix by vortexing.\nIncubate 30min at 65°C. Filter sterilize the buffer.\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae culture\nCulture media is YPDA. Use only fresh \\(<4 weeks old) colonies. For pre-culture, one colony on an YPDA-Agar plate is dissolved in 5ml YPDA and grown for 5h at 30°C with shaking at 200rpm. Then 200ml YPDA is inoculated at a theoretical DO of 0,005 and grown for 16 hours \\(O/N) at 30°C 200rpm. Cultures are centrifuged in 50ml tubes for 5min at 1500g at 4°C. Pellet is dissolved in 20ml TE \\(10mM TrisHCl, 1mM EDTA) and centrifuged for 5min at 1500g at 4°C. Pellets are used fresh or can be flash frozen in liquid N2 and conserved at -80°C. One pellet contains approximately 1010 cells.\nSTEP1: Cell wall lysis\nResuspend a yeast pellet in 4ml Sorbitol 1M. \nAdd 250µl Zymolyase 1000U/ml. Invert gently 5x. \nIncubate 30min at 30°C \\(Thermomixer C: program 10sec at 300rpm each 10min).\nCentrifuge 2min30 at 3000g.\nDiscard supernatant, let the tube upside down to remove most of the liquid.\nSTEP2: Spheroplasts lysis\nResuspend the pellet in 3.5ml lysis buffer.\nAdd 500µl SDS 10%\nAdd 4µl RNAse A 100mg/ml\nInvert gently 10-15x.\nIncubate 30min at 50°C \\(Thermomixer C: program 10sec at 300rpm each 10min).\nSTEP3: Protein precipitation\nAdd 10ml TE\nAdd 5ml KAc 5M pH7.5\nInvert gently 15x\nPlace on ice for 5min",
    "Centrifuge 10min at 5000g at 4°C \\(acceleration 9, deceleration 9)\nTransfer the supernatant in two 15ml tubes and repeat the last centrifugation.\nSTEP4: DNA precipitation\nTransfer the two supernatants in one 50ml tube and add 1V Isopropanol at RT.\nInvert gently about 15x. You shall see some DNA filaments at this stage.\nCentrifuge 5min at 500g at 4°C \\(acceleration 9, deceleration 1)\nDiscard supernatant and dislodge pellet with 20ml ethanol 70%\nPlace on ice for at least 5min\nCentrifuge 5min at 500g at 4°C \\(acceleration 9, deceleration 1)\nDiscard supernatant, remove as much ethanol as possible\nSTEP5: DNA elution\nLet the pellet air dry for 5min\nAdd 200µl TE at 50°C\nIncubate 10min at 50°C without cap in order to evaporate the remaining ethanol\nTransfer carefully with wide bore tip in a 1.5ml tube."
