    "1. Hardware setup\nNOTE: See Figure 2 for an overview of the hardware components of a PRANCE system and Figure 3 for photos of these components physically assembled.\nObtain the primary hardware for the PRANCE system, including a liquid handling instrument, a plate reader, and auxiliary pumps.\n\tNOTE: All PRANCE systems to date have been implemented on Medium to Large liquid handling instruments equipped with an 8-channel, individually addressable pipetting arms, a single-piston 96-tip pipetting arm, a robotic gripper for moving plates, an integrated wash station for tip sterilization, and an integrated plate reader capable of absorbance and luminescence measurements.\nConfigure the heating strategies depending on the model and features of the liquid-handling robot. Use a heated plate carrier or heater-mediated robot climate control.\nEstablish a tip-wash station to allow for tip reuse.\n\tNOTE: To date, PRANCE systems have used off-the-shelf wash stations, although, in principle, this component could easily be constructed out of low-cost components.\nEstablish a source of bacterial culture maintained at log-phase by setting up a real-time bioreactor running at 37 °C as a chemostat/turbidostat. Alternatively, arrest a log-phase bacterial culture of at least 1 L volume pre-grown at 37 °C in log-phase (OD600 between 0.25 and 0.45) at 4 °C in a nearby refrigerator. Ensure that the culture, whether chilled or warm, is stirred regularly using a shaker plate or stir plate to prevent sedimentation.\nConfigure the preferred pumps for robotic integration with the necessary software and drivers. Implement the software to enable the pumps to deliver defined quantities of liquid on the order of 10-100 mL.",
    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for pumps used in this implementation and the manufacturer's website for software used to operate these pumps and documentation on how to configure them. Such software for the pumps used in the PRANCE setup illustrated in this manuscript is provided open source in the following GitHub repository https://github.com/dgretton/std-96-pace PRANCE requires at least a three-pump manifold capable of pumping three separate channels (deliver bacteria to bacterial reservoir, deliver bleach to bacterial reservoir, and drain bacterial reservoir to waste), with the speed of each calibrated and controlled independently. In the past, people have used fish tank pumps and hydroponics pump arrays, although, in principle, any python-controllable peristaltic pump can be used. Essential functions include the ability to use a robot gripper to transfer plates in or out of the reader, to initiate a plate reader measurement, and to access measurements.\n3D-Print the required custom deck components for the PRANCE system, including, at minimum, the bacterial reservoir/distribution manifold (\"waffle\"), as found in Supplemental File 1 (https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ELcvfFPzBzNSto0xUrBe-shi23J9Na7/view?usp=share_link). Secure these containers onto the deck and calibrate their positions using standard Liquid Handling Robot software. Connect the reservoir to the pump array.\n\tNOTE: Consult the robot manufacturer's documentation for details of how to perform the calibration as it will be robot-dependent. Resin-based 3D printers are most appropriate; an example of the printer type used is given in the Table of Materials; standard clear resin was used with the default printer settings.\nEquip the system with a drain compatible with the local biosafety recommendations.\nPlace labware on the deck of the Liquid Handling Robot as exemplified in Figure 4.\nFollow standard safety procedures, including the use of standard laboratory personal protective equipment (i.e., lab coat, gloves, and eye protection).\n2. Software preparation",
    "Install open-source software used for controlling Liquid Handling robots with python11, available from the open-source PyHamilton repository. https://github.com/dgretton/pyhamilton\nModify and calibrate the deck layout file for the Liquid Handling robot software to accurately reflect the labware positions on the robot deck, as shown in Figure 4.\n\tNOTE: The setup used here uses the software provided by the manufacturer of the liquid handling robot, according to the provided documentation.\nRun the PRANCE robot method program in simulation mode.\n\t\nOpen the Command Line with the following commands (in the Windows operating system), as shown in Figure 5.\nWindows key + R\n\t\t​Enter: cmd\nChange the parent directory to the directory of the robot method program. Enter a command as below with the correct path, as shown in Figure 5.\n​CD c:\\Robot_methods_directory\\PRANCE\nCall the robot method program with Python with the simulation mode flag, as shown in Figure 5.\npy robot_method.py --simulate\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Robot Run Control window that will open when the program is executed (Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the PRANCE method can run without errors in simulation before moving forward. It becomes obvious if the script is able to operate in simulation mode without errors, as it will complete multiple loops of the main program without the system's error handling being called, which terminates the main program loop.\nRun the PRANCE robot method program with the simulation mode disabled.\n\t\nOpen the Command Line in the appropriate directory (Figure 5).\nWindows key + R\nEnter: cmd\n\t\t​CD c:\\Robot_methods_directory\\PRANCE\nCall the robot method program with Python without flags:\npy robot_method.py\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Robot Run Control window that will open when the program is executed.\nConfirm that PyHamilton can control the instrument and cause it to initialize.",
    "Establish real-time data synchronization.\n\tNOTE: To date, PRANCE systems have used networked computers that allow users to monitor the log files and real-time plate reader measurement graphs via remote file-sharing software, or via a remote desktop.\nTurn off automatic updates.\n3. Pre-run preparation\nEnsure that log-phase bacterial culture sources are available for all cultures required for the planned run and that they are being actively stirred to prevent sedimentation. Use an active chemostat/turbidostat or a growth-arrested refrigerated pregrown culture.\nUpdate the controller manifest file with the details of what volume (range 0-500 µL) of which bacterial culture is to be pumped into each well of the 96-well lagoon per program cycle. This allows precise control of the effective lagoon dilution rate. This can be seen in Figure 6.\n\t\nCalculate the Dilution rate of the lagoon using the DilutionCalculator.xlsx spreadsheet (provided as Supplemental File 2), as seen in Figure 7.\nUpdate the robot_method.py file with the intended lagoon height. To follow this protocol, use 14 (in millimeter units) as the default value for the variable fixed_lagoon_height in the program. This corresponds to a lagoon volume of 550 µL on the system but may differ depending on the particular 96-deep-well plate used.\nPlace clean filtered pipette tips onto the robot deck in their designated positions and tape the tip racks to the tip holders to ensure stability during the run.\nPlace clean 96-deep-well plates onto the robot deck in their designated positions.\nPlace clean 96-well reader plates onto the robot deck in their designated positions.\nEnsure that the plate reader tray is not occupied by a pre-existing plate.\nEnsure that pumps are connected to the computer and are assigned to the correct address.\nClean the pump lines by activating the pumps to pump bleach and then water.",
    "Connect pump lines to the appropriate sources and outputs, paying close attention to ensure the correct lines are connected to the relevant bacterial cultures.\nRefill tanks/buckets containing bleach/water for bacterial reservoir and pipette tip washing.\nEnsure all on-deck components, particularly mobile elements, are stabilized in their designated positions.\nActivate heaters as per local implementation to target temperature (i.e. 37 °C; Figure 8).\nRun the UV Sterilization Protocol file for 10 min to operate the built-in UV sterilization lamp in the liquid-handling robots as supplied by the manufacturer (Figure 9).\n\t\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Robot Run Control window that will open when the program is executed.\nRun the file with the parametrized option for 600 s.\nEnsure that the Robot Run Control software is closed.\n\tNOTE: The robot method program will crash if there are any existing instances of the Run Control software running.\n4. Hardware and software integration\nConduct a 'water run,' where the PRANCE robot method program is run overnight with water substituting for all cultures and wet reagents.\n\tNOTE: This test can be run at room temperature.\n\t\nComplete the pre-run preparation as detailed above with the controller_manifest and robot_method set up for an effective lagoon dilution rate of 1 volume/h as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.\nConnect the 'bacteria in' line to a container of water to replace log-phase bacteria for the water run.\n\t\tNOTE: Food coloring can be added to the water sources to track liquid movement through the experiment.\nOpen the Command Line in the appropriate directory.",
    "Call the robot method program with Python with the new run flag (py robot_method.py --new) and input the requested arguments, including log file name (TestRun), number of lagoon wells (16), cycle duration (30), number of cycles per reader plate measurement (4), and inducer volume (inducer volume is 0 µL for this test run, during an evolution where mutagenesis is induced with arabinose, this value may be 10 µL), as shown in Figure 5.\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Robot Run Control window that will open when the program is executed once arguments have been provided.\n\t\tNOTE: The PRANCE method can be started using an empty lagoon plate, and the liquid volume of the lagoons will equilibrate to the final volume over the first six cycles.\nConduct a 'bacteria-only run', where the PRANCE protocol is run overnight only with bacterial culture at target temperature but with no bacteriophage.\n\t\nComplete the pre-run preparation as detailed above with the controller_manifest and robot_method set up for an effective lagoon dilution rate of 1 volume/h, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Ensure that heaters are switched on for a target temperature of 37 °C.\nConnect the 'bacteria in' line to the selected source of log-phase bacteria.\nOpen the Command Line in the appropriate directory.\nCall the robot method program with Python with the new run flag (py robot_method.py --new) and input the requested arguments, as detailed previously in section 4.1.4.\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Robot Run Control window that will open when the program is executed once the arguments have been provided.\nRun an 'infection test,' where phages bearing an evolved protein are challenged to propagate on bacteria requiring that protein.",
    "NOTE: Decide in advance which lagoons will be inoculated with phage and which lagoons will not be inoculated and thus serve as no-phage control lagoons to detect cross-contamination.\n\t\nComplete the pre-run preparation as detailed above with the controller_manifest and robot_method set up for an effective dilution rate of 1 volume/h, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Ensure that heaters are switched on for a target temperature of 37 °C.\nConnect the 'bacteria in' line to the selected source of log-phase bacteria.\nOpen the Command Line in the appropriate directory.\nCall the robot method program with Python with the new run flag (py robot_method.py --new) and input the requested arguments as detailed previously in section 4.1.4.\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Robot Run Control window that will open when the program is executed once arguments have been provided.\nBefore adding bacteriophage, run the method for 2-3 h to equilibrate the volume and bacteria OD in the lagoon plates.\nInoculate the with-phage lagoons with 106 pfu/mL of bacteriophage at the end of a run cycle when the program is sleeping (e.g., 5.5 µL of phage aliquot at 108 pfu/mL, as determined by plaque assay or qPCR), into a 550 µL lagoon.\nRun the program overnight and then check the phage titer in the lagoon wells by plaque assay or qPCR."
