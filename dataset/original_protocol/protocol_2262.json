    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransfecting the cells with HA-tagged Tus expression plasmid\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step transiently expresses Tus to generate site-specific fork stalling or I-SceI to induce a DSB at the Rosa26, to study the recruitment of repair proteins by Cut&RUN-qPCR.\nGrow 4–5 million cells in a 10 cm dish format. One day prior to transfection, reseed mES cell culture to stimulate proliferation. For ideal cultures displaying 80%–90% confluency, reseed approximately 1/4 of cells. For cultures displaying 40%–60% confluency, reseed approximately 1/3 of cells.\nOn the day of transfection, harvest cells and count viable cells under the microscope using trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer.\nTo count the cells, dilute 10 μL of cell suspension into 90 μL trypan blue. Calculate the cell concentration by multiplying the number of cells counted by 10,000 and the dilution factor of 10 (i.e., a count of 34 indicates an original concentration of 3.4 M cells/mL). Resuspend the mES cells in mES cell media to a density of 0.8 million cells/mL.\nCover the wells of all the 24-well plates with 0.5 mL of PBS/gelatin (0.2% gelatin in 1× PBS) and incubate the plates for at least 5 min at room temperature to gelatinize.\nAspirate the PBS/gelatin and immediately plate 200 μL 0.8 million cells/mL mES cell suspension (160,000 cells) to each well.\nPrepare plasmid mix by adding 0.5 μg plasmid in 33 μL Opti-MEM per reaction in a 5 mL polystyrene tube. Agitate each tube by gently flicking the tube to mix.\nPrepare the Lipofectamine mix by mixing 1.2 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 to 33 μL Opti-MEM per reaction in a 5 mL polystyrene tube. Agitate each tube by gently flicking the tube to mix.\nIncubate the plasmid and Lipofectamine mixes at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "Transfer one equal volume of Lipofectamine mix to each plasmid mix to set up the lipofection reactions.\nAgitate each 5 mL reaction tube by gentle flicking or pipetting using a p1000 pipet. Incubate the lipofection reactions at room temperature for 5–10 min.\nTransfect target wells by transferring 70 μL of the appropriate lipofection reaction to each designated well. Flick each lipofection mix gently before addition.\nAfter the addition of the lipofection reaction, gently agitate the 24-well plate being careful not to swirl the contents of the wells. Place the 24-well transfection plate in the humidified tissue culture incubator at 37°C for 6 h.\nAfter 6 h, gently add 1 mL mES cell media to each transfected well using a 25 mL pipet, taking care to avoid touching any individual well’s contents with the pipet tip.\nReturn the plate(s) to the tissue culture incubator for incubation overnight.\nCell harvest\nTiming: 30 min\nThese steps involve harvesting transfected cells by detaching them using trypsin from plastic of 24-well plate and make them ready for the first step of Cut&RUN-qPCR.\nThe following day, 24 h after the initiation of transfection, remove mES cell media from each well. Add 500 μL 1×PBS to wash each well of residual media and serum and repeat the decanting process.\nUsing a 5 mL pipet, add two drops (∼100 μL) 0.25% trypsin/EDTA to each well and incubate at 37°C for 3 min. Firmly tap to agitate each plate to loosen and dislodge adherent cells from the plastic and to help break up any cell clumps.",
    "Using a 5 mL pipet, add two drops (∼100 μL) DMEM/EDTA to each well and swirl the wells to mix. Using p1000 tips, pipet each well four-five times and harvest cells as normal and count viable cells using trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer.\nAliquot 1 million cells per condition (EV, I-SceI, and Tus transfected cells) in mES cell media in 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube.\nWash cells twice with sterile 1×PBS, pelleting cells in a microfuge at 600 × g for 3 min at room temperature for each wash step.\nNote: After the second PBS wash, use a p200 pipet to remove every last drop of the PBS supernatant.\nConcanavalin A beads activation\nTiming: 15 min\nThese steps charge the concanavalin A beads and make them ready to bind to cell nuclei.\nGently resuspend the Concanavalin A (ConA)-coupled magnetic beads in the stock bottle by slow inversion (5–6×).\nCalculate volume of beads needed (10 μL per sample) and transfer this volume of beads to a 2.0 mL tube containing chilled 1.5 mL Binding Buffer.\nNote: It is very important to use equal amounts of beads in all samples, to avoid sample-to-sample variation in epitope binding and in the release of digested chromatin.\nMix tube contents by inversion and place on magnetic separator ∼30 s. When liquid clarifies, remove the supernatant with p1000 pipet.\nRepeat binding buffer wash for a total of two washes. After 2nd wash, resuspend the beads in a volume of binding buffer equal to the initial volume of bead suspension (10 μL per final sample) and place cell-bead suspension on ice.\nCell immobilization- binding cells to concanavalin A activated beads\nTiming: 25 min\nThese steps involve the preparation of cell nuclei and their attachment to a solid support using charged concanavalin A beads.",
    "Wash cells twice with 1 mL wash buffer, pelleting cells in a microfuge at 600 × g for 3 min at room temperature for each wash step.\nNote: Keep wash buffers and steps in this section at room temperature to avoid cell stress.\nFollowing second wash, add 1 mL wash Buffer and resuspend cells using p1000.\nNote: Perform ConA bead activation steps and cell washing steps in parallel. Adjust the relative timing of these steps in such a way that activated the ConA beads are ready by the time the second wash with wash buffer has been completed (step 21).\nAdd to each sample 10 μL prepared ConA bead slurry. Resuspend cells thoroughly by pipetting to prevent ConA bead clumping.\nCritical: After step 19, the ConA beads will begin to settle. It is critical to resuspend beads before addition to each sample (See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPlace samples on Benchmark Nutator Mixer for 15 min at room temperature. Check that the contents of each tube are moving and mixing well. If needed. supplement this rocking by gently agitating samples using a p1000 pipet.\nCell permeabilization and primary antibody binding\nTiming: 18 h\nThese steps make cells permeable to the primary antibody and overnight incubation binds the antibody to target epitopes in the immobilized nuclei.\nPlace the Eppendorf tubes on a magnet stand until the fluid is clear. Remove the liquid carefully.\nNote: Use p200 pipet to remove every last drop of liquid.\nAdd 400 μL of chilled freshly prepared Antibody buffer. Resuspend ConA bead/cell conjugate from wall thoroughly by gentle mixing using a p1000 pipet.\nTransfer entire contents to 0.5 mL low binding tube.\nAdd 3 μL of antibody to each tube. Mix using a p1000 pipet.\nIncubate samples on the Nutator rocking platform at 4°C overnight.",
    "Note: In this protocol, we used Anti-HA tag antibody and Anti-Rad51 antibody.\nCritical: While rotating samples on the Nutator overnight, beads may tend to become stuck along the wall of the Eppendorf tube or may form clumps within the cell suspension. Therefore, it is important to resuspend the cells attached to ConA beads thoroughly by pipetting before incubating samples overnight.\npA/G-MNase binding\nTiming: 45 min\nIn these steps Micrococcal Nuclease fused to proteins A and G binds the primary antibody.\nWash cells twice in chilled digitonin buffer. To do this, flick each tube to consolidate contents and place samples on magnetic separator for ∼30 s. Remove supernatant using a p1000 pipet.\nAdd 500 μL chilled Digitonin Buffer and mix beads thoroughly by inversion.\nNote: After second wash, use a p200 pipet to remove every last μL of liquid. This step is important, since efficient MNAse activity requires efficient removal of EDTA from the buffer. A dead volume of wash buffer may allow excess EDTA to be carried over.\nAdd 350 μL of chilled digitonin buffer and mix each sample gently using a p1000 pipet.\nAdd 2.5 μL of pAG-MNase and again mix each sample gently using a p1000 pipet.\nPlace each sample on Nutator for 30 min at room temperature to allow pA/G-MNase-antibody chromatin binding.\nTargeted chromatin digestion and release\nTiming: 5 h\nIn these steps, exposure to calcium activates MNase to cleave chromatin on either side of the targeted protein and cleaved fragments are released, diffusing out of the immobilized nuclei.\nWash cells two times with 400 μL of chilled digitonin buffer by inverting tube 3–4 times.\nNote: After second wash, use a p200 pipet to remove every last μL of liquid. This step is important to completely remove non-specific binding of pA/G-MNase.",
    "Add 300 μL chilled digitonin buffer and 3 μL chilled 100 mM CaCl2 to activate MNase.\nMix samples using a p1000 pipet as fast as possible and rock samples on a Nutator at 4°C for 4 h.\nNote: Turn on thermomixer with 1.5–2 mL smart block to preheat to 37°C.\nTransfer each sample to 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 100 μL chilled stop buffer to each tube and gently mix using a p1000 pipet.\nPlace samples on thermomixer set to 500 rpm at 37°C for 10 min.\nCentrifuge samples:16,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nPlace the tube on a magnet stand. Once the ConA bead-cell slurry is concentrated at the magnet, transfer the supernatant to a 2 mL tube.\nExtract the DNA from the supernatant using a Qiagen MinElute PCR purification Kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nhttps://www.qiagen.com/cn/resources/download.aspx?id=e0fab087-ea52-4c16-b79f-c224bf760c39&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/cn/resources/download.aspx?id=e0fab087-ea52-4c16-b79f-c224bf760c39&lang=en].\nElute the purified DNA in 20 μL of elution buffer.\nNote: Purified samples can be stored at −20°C.\nAnalyzing by qPCR\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, qPCR amplifies the eluted DNA fragments and estimates the quantity of initial material.\nAssess the concentration of the eluted DNA sample using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.\nNote: The DNA concentration of eluted DNA may be less than 2 ng/uL, which is acceptable.\nRun qPCR of all the samples in the following system with qPCR machine using 3 technical repeats per experimental repeat.\nNote: The Ct values of the triplicates should show minimal variation. Apart from technical triplicates, experimental repeats should show minimal variability, if the samples have been handled appropriately. Variability among experimental repeats may be due to the various reason (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1869_9.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1869_10.csv",
    "Critical: To determine the specificity of the PCR reaction, it is important to establish the melting curve properties. It is also important to assess the homogeneity of the PCR products, including screening for the presence of primer–dimers by analyzing the primer pair sequence to avoid complementarity and hybridization between primers. The dissociation curve for a primer should produce a single sharp peak. More than one peak indicates that the PCR reaction is not specific to the target locus.\nAnalyzing the data\nIn this step, as 2–ΔΔ CTmethod (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) used to analyze the CUT&RUN-qPCR data.\nWe use two sets of negative controls. The first is an untreated control sample of cells, and the second is a control genomic locus, distant from the Ter array. For the untreated control sample, we use empty vector-transfected cells in which no replication fork barrier (RFB) is active at the Ter array. For the control genomic locus, we use sequences in the β-actin gene—a locus that is remote from the Ter array at Rosa26—or another locus known not to be bound by the protein of interest. The equation that we use to normalize and analyze the CUT&RUN-qPCR data is the comparative CT method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) (also known as 2–ΔΔ CTmethod).\nΔΔ CT= (CT at Ter locus – CT at β-actin locus) of sample transfected with Tus – (CT at Ter locus – CT at β-actin locus) of sample transfected with empty vector."
