  "procedures": [
    "The study complied with the principles of laboratory animal care according to the National Society for Medical Research and was approved by the local ethic committee for animal experiments at Hospital Marie Lannelongue.\n1. Chronic thromboembolic PH\nInduce chronic thromboembolic PH as previously described6,12.\nBriefly, induce a model of chronic thrombo-embolic PH in around 20 kg large white pigs (sus scrofa). Perform a ligature of the left pulmonary artery ligation through a left thoracotomy at week 0 (closed pericardium); and perform weekly an embolization of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery (0.2 mL to 0.4 mL per week) with a mixed solution composed with 1 mL of soft tissue glue including N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and 2 mL of lipidic contrast dye (lipiodol) for 5 weeks.\nPerform a xyphoïdectomy at week 0 at time of left pulmonary artery ligation to improve the echocardiography feasibility. To do this, perform a 4 cm longitudinal incision in front of the xiphoid process. Remove the xyphoid process using a diathermy knife. Close the subcutaneous plan and the skin with a running suture.\nPerform an additional right lower lobe pulmonary embolism at week 10 by using the same protocol explained above (step 1.2).\nPerform the ARHF induction (section 6) model 6 weeks after the last right lower lobe embolization (week 16) in order to avoid acute right heart lesions induced by acute pulmonary embolisms.\n\tNOTE: Other large animal model of right heart failure can be used, or other pathological conditions can be induced in the chronic-thromboembolic PH model.\n2. Animal positioning and catheter placements\nPerform general anesthesia as previously described6.",
    "Briefly, let the animal fast for 12 h. Then perform an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (30 mg/kg) for premedication. Perform an intravenous bolus of fentanyl (0.005 mg/kg), Propofol (2 mg/kg) and cisatracurium (0.3 mg/kg) intravenously through an ear vein and intubate non-selectively the pig with a 7 French probe.\nMaintain general anesthesia with inhaled 2% isoflurane, continuous infusion of fentanyl (0.004 mg/kg) and propofol (3 mg/kg).\nAfter general anesthesia induction, position the pig on his back with its forelegs in a slightly spread position to allow parasternal echocardiographic acquisition (section 3).\nPlace the device electrodes on the arms and legs (echocardiograph, workstation for hemodynamic acquisitions) prior to the placement of the sterile fields.\nPlace an 8-French sheath into the jugular vein using the Seldinger method13.\n\t\nIntroduce an 18 G (1.3 mm x 48 mm) IV catheter into the jugular vein.\n\t\t\nPerform a percutaneous puncture on the middle line at 2 cm above the manubrium with a 45° orientation.\nAfter obtaining a venous reflux, insert a guidewire into the catheter (0.035 inch / 0.089 mm, 180 cm, angled).\nVerify the correct placement of the guidewire into the superior vena cava with fluoroscopy and dispose the 8-French sheath on the guidewire into the superior vena cava.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The guidewire is correctly placed when it goes through the inferior vena cava along the right border of the spine.\nPerform a division of the right femoral vessels to introduce a fluid filled catheter into the right femoral artery for continuous systemic pressure monitoring and a balloon dilation catheter into the inferior vena cava through the femoral vein as follow.\n\t\nPerform a 4 cm transverse incision at the groin.\nPlace a Beckman retractor and divide the anterior face of the femoral vein and of the femoral artery using a Debackey forceps and Metzenbaum scissors.",
    "Place a 20 G catheter into the femoral artery under direct visual control and connect it to a disposable transducer with a fluid filled catheter to obtain continuous systemic blood pressure monitoring.\n\t\tNOTE: The mean blood pressure should be continuously above 60 mmHg.\nUse an 18 G catheter to insert a guidewire (0.035 inch / 0.089 mm, 180 cm, angled) into the femoral vein through the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic control.\nInsert a balloon dilation catheter on the guidewire through the inferior vena cava at the intrapericardial level under fluoroscopic control.\nPerform the fluoroscopic control with a C-arm using an anteroposterior view. Place the visible markers of the balloon immediately above the diaphragm level under fluoroscopic control. Remove the guidewire when the balloon is placed.\nSew a purse with a 5.0 polypropylene monofilament suture around the venous dilation balloon catheter to avoid bleeding from the femoral vein.\n3. Echocardiography\nPerform the echocardiography right after the animal positioning and the catheter placement (section 2) in animals still under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation.\nAcquire each echocardiographic view in cine loop format for at least 3 cardiac cycles during end-expiratory apnea.\nAcquire all views in 2-dimension and Tissue Doppler modes.\nAcquire the apical 5-chamber view under the xiphoid process.\nAcquire the parasternal short and long axis views on the right side of the sternum.\nAcquire valvular flow using continuous and pulsed Doppler modes.\nAcquire Tissue Doppler signals of the lateral tricuspid annulus and lateral and septal mitral annulus.\n\tNOTE: Use the latest guidelines for echocardiographic assessment in humans for echocardiographic acquisitions and interpretations14.\n4. Right heart catheterization\nPerform the right heart catheterization after the cardiac echo (section 3) and prior the pressure-volume loop acquisitions (section 5)\nLink the Swan-Ganz catheter to the disposable transducer.",
    "Introduce the Swan-Ganz catheter into the jugular 8-French sheath previously inserted into the jugular vein (section 2.4) and acquire mean right atrial, right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures. Place the catheter under fluoroscopy if needed.\n\tNOTE: Check that fluid filled catheters are well purged with saline and remove air bubbles to avoid pressure signal damping.\nAfter placing the Swan-Ganz catheter into the pulmonary artery, measure the cardiac output with the thermodilution method as explained by the manufacturer's instructions; measure simultaneously the heart rate for stroke volume calculation.\n\t\nEnsure that the saline is at 4 °C to avoid overestimation of the cardiac output.\nConnect the disposable transducer to the PV-loop work station for live acquisitions of pressures derived from fluid filled catheters.\n5. Pressure volume loop acquisition using the conductance method\nNOTE: This section has been previously published15.\nIntroduce the conductance catheter into the right ventricle under fluoroscopic control.\n\t\nVerify the quality signal using \" in live\" acquisition of pressure-volume loops.\nActivate adequate electrodes to obtain optimal signal (i.e., counter-clockwise PV-loops with physiological shape).\nFollow-up the pressure and volume calibration steps of the workflow according to the manufacturer's instruction (blood conductivity, parallel volume, stroke volume calibration = alpha calibration).\n\tNOTE: Stroke external with the Swan-Ganz catheter can be repeated for each conditions; whereas the other calibration steps can be performed only once.\nAcquire PV-loop families in steady states and during acute preload reduction (i.e., acute occlusion of the inferior vena cava) during end-expiratory apnea.\nPerform at least 3 acquisitions per condition (steady + IVC occlusion).\n6. Induction of acute right heart failure by volume and pressure overload (Figure 1).\nInduce volume overload using a 3-step saline infusion (around 2 h).\n\t\nStart the first infusion of 15 mL/kg of saline with a free-flow infusion output.",
    "Perform the measurements (right heart catheterism, PV-loops and echocardiographic) 5 min after hemodynamic stabilization after the end of each infusion.\nStart the second volume infusion of 15 mL/kg immediately after the end of the measurements.\nStart the third volume infusion of 30 mL/kg of saline immediately after the end of the measurements.\n\t\tCAUTION: Volume loading can induce hemodynamic compromise or pulmonary edema depending on the animal model used. In this model, volume loading revealed an adaptive response characterized by increasing cardiac output, stable right atrial pressure and preserved ventriculo-arterial coupling.\n\t\tNOTE: Volume loading can be stopped in case of poor respiratory or hemodynamic tolerance.\nInduce pressure overload with iterative pulmonary embolism.\n\t\nInsert a 5 French angiographic catheter through the jugular sheath into the right lower lobe pulmonary artery under fluoroscopic control.\nEmbolize the right lower lobe pulmonary artery with a bolus of 0.15 mL of a mixed solution composed with 1 mL of soft tissue glue including N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and 2 mL of lipidic contrast dye. Wash out the catheter with 10 mL of saline.\nEvaluate the hemodynamic response 2 minutes after the embolization using the systemic pressure and pulmonary artery pressure.\nRepeat embolisms of 0.15 mL every 2 minutes until obtaining hemodynamic compromise, (i.e., systolic systemic pressure <90 mmHg or systolic pulmonary pressure over systolic systemic pressure ratio >0.9).\n\t\tCAUTION: Pulmonary embolism can induce severe hemodynamic compromise, sometimes irreversible, leading to immediate death. Prior starting the embolization step, be ready to start hemodynamic support (dobutamine protocol or epinephrine in case of circulatory arrest). Be ready to start PV-loops and echocardiographic monitoring. As this step may be associated with severe hemodynamic compromise, right heart catheterization using the Swan-Ganz catheter can be avoided so as to start dobutamine support sooner.\n7. Induce restoration of the systemic hemodynamic with dobutamine",
    "After reaching hemodynamic compromise and performing PV-loops and echocardiographic acquisitions, start dobutamine infusion at 2.5 µg/kg/min.\n\tNOTE: Other drugs or treatments can be started at this time point.\nWait 10 to 15 min for hemodynamic stabilization.\nPerform right heart catheterization, PV-loops and echocardiographic acquisitions.\nIncrease the dose of dobutamine infusion to 5 µg/kg/min.\nWait 15 min for hemodynamic stabilization and repeat acquisitions.\nRepeat right heart catheterization, PV-loops and echocardiographic acquisitions.\nIncrease the dose of dobutamine infusion to 7.5 µg/kg/min.\n\tNOTE: Other doses, drugs or treatments can be initiated.\n8. Euthanasia and cardiac tissue harvesting\nAt the end of the protocol, perform a median sternotomy using an oscillating saw.\nOpen the pericardium and inject a lethal solution of potassium chloride (0.2 g/kg).\nHarvest the heart; select samples of the right and left ventricular free-walls for pathological and molecular evaluations.\n\tNOTE: The methods for the pathological evaluations of the right ventricle and for the statistics were previously reported5.\nSubscription Required.
