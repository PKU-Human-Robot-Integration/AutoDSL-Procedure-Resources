    "1. Plating and Maintenance of Cell Culture\nWarm Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) culture media (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin/Neomycin) to 37 °C.\nObtain stock of frozen A12 cells from -80 °C.\nRapidly thaw cells in 37 °C water bath; once thawed, gently pipette cells to transfer to a 75 cm2 vented culture flask and add 10 ml of culture media.\nIncubate flask overnight in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Aspirate media after 24 hr and replace with fresh media. Continue growing cells until 70-80% confluence is obtained (2-3 days growth).\n2. Counting and Plating Cells\nWarm DMEM and 1x-trypsin-EDTA solution to 37 °C.\nAspirate media from cells and wash two times with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 500 μl of trypsin solution and incubate at 37 °C for 2-5 min.\nDetach cells from flask using a scraper and suspend cells in 5 ml of media. Pass cells through strainer and pass through cell strainer into a clean 50 ml tube. May need to pass cells through strainer more than once, but do not repeat more than three times.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer to determine amount of cells to culture to seed 6,000 cell/well in a 96-well clear bottom black or white walled plate in a final volume of 100 μl of media. Incubate plate in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 hr.\n3. Determining Cell Viability and Caspase-3/7 Activity\nTransfer PA to a sterile 5 ml glass vial and solubilize in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Dilute stock PA solution 1:10 in DMSO and add it to prewarmed DMEM to obtain a final working concentration of 0.1 mM PA. For control media, add the same concentration of DMSO that is added to media containing PA.",
    "Remove the media in each well and replace with 50 μl media +/- PA. Incubate the plate for 2 hr in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Then add 5 μl resazurin reagent and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nUsing a multimode microplate reader, record fluorescence (560EX/590EM) to measure cell viability. Results are presented as relative fluorescence units (RFU).\nTo the same plate, add 55 μl of caspase reagent and incubate at room temperature for 2 hr.\nAgain using the microplate reader, record luminescence to measure caspase-3/7 activity. Results are presented as relative luminescence units (RLU), with luminescence directly proportional to caspase-3/7 activity.\nTo normalize caspase-3/7 activity to cell count, divide cell viability (RFU) by caspase-3/7 activity (RLU).\nSubscription Required.
