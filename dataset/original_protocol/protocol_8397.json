    "The present study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, which establishes the ethical principles for research involving human beings. The study's aims, scope and procedure were also approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Oviedo and University Hospital of Asturias.\n1. Parents Report\nBefore starting the assessment protocol, obtain signed parental consent for the child to be assessed.\nConduct a structured interview with families of the participants.\n\tNOTE: The structured interview has been provided as an appendix.\nHave families and/or teachers of the participant complete the Scale for the Assessment of ADHD13. This scale comprises 20 items that provide information on the presence of symptoms related to attention deficit and hyperactivity/impulsivity that are referred in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n\t\nIn this section, have the therapist give the following instructions: \"Now, in order to get significant information about your child, you must complete this questionnaire referring to the symptoms that might be representative of your child's behavior. You must classify the frequency with which you observe these 20 symptoms\".\n2. Cognitive Measures\nTo measure the attentional variables, administer a cognitive scale.\n\t\nAdminister a Cognitive Scale14 (following the protocol in the manual) for assessing individual intelligence in children and adolescents between the ages of 6 years and 16 years 11 months.\nAnalyze in depth the cognitive profile obtained by the scale.\n\t\tNOTE: Considering the information included in the cognitive scales manual, the results from the Wechsler scale could be influenced by ADHD, leading to lower scores in processing speed and working memory in comparison with perceptual reasoning and verbal comprehension.\n3. Executive Measures Using Continuous Performance Tests\nAnalyze the performance of the children using two CPTs: one based on a Virtual Reality CPT15 and the other consisting of a Traditional CPT16.",
    "Administer the virtual-reality based CPT15. This is a CPT based on a virtual reality environment that reproduces the conditions of a regular classroom. It evaluates attention, impulsivity, processing speed, and motor activity in children and adolescents between 6 and 16 years of age. The activities that make up the test are preset, and it is not possible to change any specific characteristic of the tasks.\n\t\nDouble-click on the Virtual Reality CPT app to start the program.\nEnter the username and password provided by the program license.\nEnter the participant information (name, surname and date of birth) and the click on the \"Go into the virtual classroom\" window.\nAsk the participant to wear the Head Mounted Display (HMD) glasses and headphones, and inform them of the importance of wearing it during the whole test. Have the therapist say: \"Now you need to wear these special glasses during the virtual reality tasks, if you don't see very well or have any issue about that, please tell me and I help you to resolve it\".\n\t\tNOTE: These glasses are connected to the PC, so the therapist can see the images the participants are looking at in order to ensure that they understand the test (Figure 2).\nAsk the participant to hold the button with their dominant hand before starting the virtual attentional tasks. Have the therapist say: \"You need to hold and press the button with the same hand you write with\".",
    "Have the participant explore the virtual environment (a typical classroom) and take the perspective of a student sitting at one of the desks looking at the blackboard for 15 s (Figure 3). Conduct this part by the virtual teacher though these instructions: \"Hello, with the glasses that you are wearing, you can see the entire classroom: to the left, to your right, up, and down. You can see everything. Notice all the things in the room, look at the walls and the other people, look at whatever you want\".\nHave the participant follow the virtual teacher, who guides them through the tasks. The first part the participant performs is training, which consists of visually locating balloons and popping them by pressing the button. Have the virtual teacher in this part instruct this part as follows: \"Now that you have inspected everything, you're going to start doing something fun. We have placed some shiny red balloons around you. You need to find the balloons by moving your head. When you find one, look at it closely, and press the button to make it pop. You have to find 4 balloons. Let's go! The challenge starts now!\"",
    "Have the participant continue to the next step which is the first exercise. This is based on the \"x-no\" paradigm (traditionally known as \"no-go\"), where the participant must press the button when he or she does not see or hear the stimulus \"apple\". Have the virtual teacher say: \"Now, you will to see some drawings on the chalkboard. I will also say a few words to you. You have to pay attention and click the button, AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, when you see or hear anything THAT IS NOT AN APPLE. But be careful! You need to press the button every time you see or hear any other thing. For example, if you hear \"CLOUD\" or if a drawing of a cloud appears on the chalkboard, you have to press the button. Remember: Never press the button when you see or hear apple! The challenge starts... Now!\".\n\t\tNote: As the activities are preset by the program, it is not possible to change the target-stimulus (in this case, APPLE).\nHave the participant complete the last exercise by following the instructions to press the button whenever he/she sees or hears the number \"seven\". This part consists of a \"X\" paradigm (or \"go\" task). Say these instructions: \"Now you are going to work with numbers. You will see numbers on the chalkboard and you will also hear numbers. You must press the button every time you hear or see the number \"SEVEN\". DO NOT press the button for any other number. For example, if you hear or see the number \"THREE\" DO NOT press the button. Remember: Always press the button when you see or hear \"SEVEN\"! The test starts now!\"\n\t\tNOTE: As the activities are preset by the program, is not possible to change the target-stimulus (in this case, SEVEN).",
    "Print the report of the test results via the test website adding the name and surname of the child assessed. This report compiles results for the following variables: omissions, commissions, response time, and variability and complement this information by differentiating these measures of sensory modality (visual vs. auditory), presence/ absence of distractors, and task type (go vs. no-go), thereby leading to different execution profiles.\nAdminister the Traditional CPT16. This is a CPT that can be used in a visual or auditory version, but in this protocol only the visual version is used. This test contains preset tasks. The visual norms for CPT go from 4 years to more than 80, by age and gender.\n\t\nMake sure that the participant is relaxed, paying attention to their breathing and ensuring that it is controlled. If it appears that the participant is not controlling their breathing. Indicate as follows: \"You should focus on abdominal contraction and controlled breathing out\".\nOpen the CPT application and enter the name and birth date of the child, and press the okay button.\nClick on visual tasks window and click the launch button, the computer will start to load the visual tasks.\nEnsure the participant is holding the button (which is connected to a PC) with his/her dominant hand. Repeat the instruction from step 5 of the Virtual Reality CPT: \"You need to hold and press the button with the same hand you write with\".\nInform the participant of the following instructions for the test: \"You have to press the button when you see a black square in the upper part which is the target stimulus. However, do not press the button when the black square is in the bottom part\" (Figure 4).",
    "Have the participant perform the training part (which lasts for approximately 3 min) until it is clear the participant understands the task. In the training part of the CPT, the target (stimulus to which the participant has to respond) and the non-target (stimulus to which the participant has to avoid responding) stimulus appear randomly in the screen; the therapist should observe whether the participant presses the button correctly or not. If the participant does not press the button according to the instructions, have the therapist explain the instructions again and then the participant will need to repeat the training section.\nTell the participant that the task is very long and that she/he must keep still and concentrate on doing the tasks.\nHave the participant complete the CPT activities. It is divided into two sections. The first section of the test (the \"Infrequent\" or vigilance mode), is characterized by target: non-target ratio of 1:3.5. This is evidenced by a tendency to not press the button. In the second section (the \"Frequent\" or high response demand mode) presents a target:non-target ratio of 3.5:1, so the child must inhibit the tendency to respond.\nAfter completion of the CPT, generate the report which compiles the following variables: omissions, RT (response time between the presentation of target stimulus and subject response), commissions, variability, D prime (quality of concentration during the test based on the number of errors in the test) and ADHD Index, attributable to a presence or absence of attention deficit with hyperactivity. Calculate this ADHD Index from the sum of: TR of first half + D prime second half + total variability and is interpreted as attributable to ADHD when the score is lower than -1.80.\n4. Cortical Activation Measures in Fp1 and Fpz/Cz Regions (Hemoencephalography, and Quantified Electroencephalography) 17",
    "Open the Bioexplorer software and choose the design POCKET_HEG_video_1ch_AI_HEGRatio.bxd.\n\t\nPress time on button to see the time during the assessment (35 s).\nInform the participant that he/she cannot move and must be still. The therapist informs the participant about the importance of remaining still during the assessment of blood oxygenation: \"Now it is very important that you are still during the assessment of blood oxygenation because if you move, the system will fail, and it will be necessary to measure again. Are you ready?\"\nClick on the red button and enter the name of the subject and the cortical point which is going to be measured (Fp1 region for assessment of inhibition capacity and Fpz for the assessment of attention capacity).\nPut the band on the participant's forehead in a specific area: Fp1 (for assessment of inhibition capacity) and Fpz (for the assessment of attention capacity) as can be seen in Figure 5.\nMake sure that no external light enters the band. Properly adjust the band to the participant's head in such a way that it is not loose and does not fall off during the evaluation.\nPut the Hemoencephalography-nirHEG (which is connected to the headband) around the participant's neck, like a necklace.\nTurn on the hardware to connect the band to the PC.\nMeasure the blood oxygenation of a specific area through the nir-HEG program for approximately 35 s. Press the green button to start to measure blood oxygenation and 35 s later press the white button to end the assessment.",
    "Print the output provided by the program and analyze the nir-HEG Ratio of the participant provided by the program. The mean of this tool is 100 (SD = 20) which is used to calibrate the spectrophotometers. An Attention Index (AI) is also obtained through the nir-HEG , which shows the incapability of the participant to increase the ratio and brain activation. This is useful to identify attentional problems and measure capacity of concentration.\nMeasure the cortical activity levels of the participant using the quantified electroencephalography (Q-EEG), a computerized EEG system that provides levels of cortical activation through the beta/theta ratio. It is used to measure general levels of attention, not taking the performed task.\n\tNOTE: The analysis of beta/theta ratio have been carried out according to previous studies12.\n\t\nInform the participant of the correct abdominal breathing required during the test.\nOpen the Bioexplorer software and choose the design combined_Theta_Beta.bxd. The screen will appear divided into two windows (the left side shows the cortical activity of FP1 and the right side shows the cortical activity of the CZ)\nClick on the red button and enter the name of the subject and the cortical point which is going to be measured (Fp1 region for assessment of inhibition capacity and Cz region for the assessment of attention capacity).\nPut the red electrode in the Fp1 region and the blue electrode in the Cz region, applying electrode gel (using the information found at: “http://neurologiclabs.com/neuromonitoring/eeg/”, to ensure that the electrodes are correctly placed) (see Figure 6).\nPut two more control electrodes (the black and white electrodes) on the participant´s left and right earlobes, applying electrode gel.",
    "Ensure the participant has her or his eyes open during the assessment. The therapist must watch the participant throughout the assessment. If the participant closes their eyes at any time, end the assessment process and repeat it once the participant is rested.\nPlace an electromyography (EMG) sensor on the right forearm to identify the degree of movement.\nInform the participant that he/she must remain relaxed, trying not to move during the task an breathing slowly. The participant must be concentrated on the computer screen while the theta and beta waves are being emitted. The therapist says: \"You must be still and relaxed for 35 s, the only thing you need to do is to watch the theta/beta waves that will be appearing on the computer screen\".\nPress the green button to start to measure cortical activity, and 35 s later press the white button to end the assessment.\nPrint the results generated from program and analyze them. If the beta/theta ratio is lower than 50% at Cz, this evidences a deficit of sustained attention. On the other hand, if the ratio is also lower at Fp1, this result is related to an impairment of executive control, attributable to hyperactivity.\nSubscription Required.
