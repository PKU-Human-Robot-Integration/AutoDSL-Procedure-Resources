    "The procedures were done with BALB/c mice following all guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research and were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research.\n1. Primary Mouse OB Culture\nOB isolation from neonatal mouse calvaria using enzymatic digestion\nEuthanize 1–2 day old neonatal pups (60 in total) by decapitation and place the heads in a Petri dish with sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nHold the head by the nape of the neck, and cut the skin away using sterile scissors. Incise the calvarium by piercing it (approximately 0.1–0.3 mm) with a pair of scissors that are then inserted underneath the calvarium in the back of the head at the base of the skull and cut along the calvarial edge laterally from back to front above the ears and then above the nasal bridge (Figure 1).\nIncubate dissected calvaria with 8 mL of filter sterilized digestion solution (300 units/mL collagenase type IV and 2.14 units/mL dispase II dissolved in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM)) in a 50 mL conical tube at 37 °C for 10 min in a shaking incubator at 200 shakes/min.\nDiscard the first supernatant and repeat the digestion procedure three times with 8 mL of digestion solution. Collect the supernatant containing the cells after each digestion step and add it to a 50 mL conical tube. Store the 50 mL conical tube with the cells in an ice water bath until the digestion procedure (approximately 40 min) is completed.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, aspirate the supernatant (with a Pasteur pipette attached to a vacuum pump) and resuspend in 40 mL of bone growth medium (BGM) containing α-MEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Then add 10 mL of the cell suspension to 4 tissue culture plates (10 cm).\nCulture the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until confluence (2–3 days).\nAt confluence, aspirate the old medium and wash the tissue culture plates once with 1x PBS (37 °C). Then aspirate the PBS and add 2 mL of 1x trypsin solution containing 0.5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to each 10 cm tissue culture plate.\nIncubate the 4 culture plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min and then check the plates with an inverted light microscope to ensure that the cells are detached from the plastic.

Use the cells within one year to ensure full functionality. Use these primary OBs for evaluating proliferation (step 1.2), differentiation (ALP assays: step 1.4., 1.5.) and mineralization (step 1.6.) in the presence of the biomaterials. Use these cells for the maturation of bone-marrow-derived OC precursors in co-culture (step 2.3).\nOB proliferation assay\nPre-incubate 14 mm diameter β-TCP disks in 1 mL of BGM in a 24-well suspension culture plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h before adding primary OBs.
