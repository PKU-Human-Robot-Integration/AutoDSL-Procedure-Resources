    "The local ethics committee has approved the following procedure and all participants who have taken part in this procedure have given informed consent. For additional detail of psychophysiological measurement and stimulus presentation please see30,27.\n1. Electromyography (EMG) Recording Preparation\nAsk the participant to wash their face thoroughly with soap, paying particular attention to the target sensor locations, which are located below one eye and in the middle of the participant’s forehead (see Figure 2).\nSeat the participant in a comfortable upright chair in the experimental chamber.\nPrepare the participant’s skin for EMG measurement.\n\t\nClean the target sensor locations with an alcohol pad.\nClean the same locations with a gritty exfoliate gel using a small gauze pad to further remove dirt or dead skin cells that can impede measurement of the electromyographic activity.\nPrepare and attach EMG electrodes.\n\t\nFill all silver-silver chloride (Ag–AgCl) sensor cups with conductive gel using a syringe and blunt needle.\nAttach a large (e.g., 8 mm) Ag-AgCl sensor to the center of the participant’s forehead using an adhesive collar.\nAttach two additional small (e.g., 4 mm) Ag-AgCl sensors below the participant’s eye using adhesive collars. Place the first of these small sensors in line with the pupil at forward gaze and the second sensor 1-2 cm lateral to the first (Figure 2; see also27). Do not allow the adhesive collars to overlap as this may increase movement artifact. Prevent gel overflow to avoid forming a gel bridge between the two sensors below the eye as this will cause current to flow via the bridge and impair measurement of EMG activity.",
    "Start the EMG acquisition software on the physiology computer and ask the participant to blink a few times to verify that the EMG response is being recorded properly and that eye blinks can be observed on the display of the data collection software (see Figure 3A for an example of EMG activity associated with a blink).\nCheck the impedance for each sensor.\nNOTE: Many laboratories require impedances below 10 kΩ (or more conservatively, 5 kΩ) but actual tolerable thresholds for measured impedance levels depend on many variables such as experimental design, amplifier design, and practical constraints with respect to time needed to reduce impedances and the participant population. Regardless, high impedances increase susceptibility of the EMG signal to electrical artifact, which may be problematic (60 Hz noise; see Figure 3B).\nPlace the headphones on the participant’s head.\n2. Baseline Measurement of General Startle Reactivity\nNOTE: This assessment also serves to further habituate the startle response prior to the three habituation probes delivered just before task start31. Including general startle reactivity as a covariate in statistical analysis of startle potentiation increases statistical power to detect within and between participant effects. General startle reactivity may also reflect an interesting individual difference measure12,32.\nAsk the participant to get comfortable before the start of the baseline task and to remain as still as possible throughout the task with their feet flat on the floor. Participant movement may introduce artifact into the EMG signal (see Figure 3C).\nRemind the participant that they can discontinue their participation at any point during the experiment. Monitor the participant using video and audio feed from the experimental chamber during both the baseline assessment and main task.\nSave the EMG signal with acquisition software on the physiology computer and start the stimulus presentation software on the stimulus control computer.",
    "Present the participant with a series of colored squares that will be used in the main task but have not yet been paired with electric shock. Present startle probes during a subset of these cues and the interval between the cues. Timing parameters for cue duration, interval between cues, and startle probes should match parameters from the main task. Reliable measurement of general startle reactivity requires the presentation of at least 4 probes. This baseline task takes approximately 5 min to complete.\nAverage together the participant’s peak EMG startle response to each startle probe in the baseline procedure to produce one value which will serve as this participant’s general startle reactivity (see steps 6.1-6.6 for how to process the EMG data). Include general startle reactivity as an additive or interactive covariate in statistical models involving startle potentiation (see step 6.8).\n3. Shock Tolerance Threshold Assessment\nAffix two shock electrodes with standard medical tape to the participant’s hand (e.g., distal phalanges of index and ring fingers of the hand)33–35.\nPresent the participant with a series of increasingly intense electric shocks. After each shock is administered, ask the participant to rate how aversive they found the shock on a 100-point scale. Ask them to use a rating of 0 if they cannot feel a shock at all, a rating of 50 for the first level of shock that they consider to be uncomfortable, and a rating of 100 for the highest level of shock that they can tolerate.\nInstruct the participant that it is important to accurately report the highest shock they can tolerate. The participant should not be informed that their report will impact the actual shocks they receive as this may lead to bias in their report.",
    "Stop the shock tolerance assessment once the participant rates a shock as 100. Record the shock level and administer shocks at this level in the Threat Probability Task to control for individual differences in shock sensitivity.\nNOTE: Electric shocks are administered to each participant’s subjective maximum shock tolerance threshold. However, lower intensity shocks are also used21. Regardless, it is important that the shock intensity selected is sufficient to elicit a robust negative affective response and associated startle potentiation from all participants.\n4. The Threat Probability Task\nProvide the participant with a cover story that encourages attention throughout the task.\nNOTE: Some participants may find it difficult to maintain attention throughout the Threat Probability Task. An example of a cover story that researchers can tell participants in order to encourage attention in this task is to tell the participant that the researchers are interested in measuring the participant’s ability to pay attention over time during a simple, repetitive visual task similar to the task required of air traffic controllers.\nProvide the participant with general task information and specific cue-shock contingencies for each condition.\n\t\nInstruct the participant that the task lasts approximately 20 min.\nInstruct the participant that the task includes cues that last 5 sec each separated by 15-20 sec on average.\nInform the participant that the cues are organized into sets with each set lasting 2-3 min each.\nInstruct the participant that there are three types of sets, 20% shock sets, 100% shock sets and No shock sets.\nInstruct the participant that they will receive shocks at the end of approximately 1 out of every 5 cues in 20% shock sets and 5 out of every 5 cues in 100% shock sets.",
    "Assure the participant that they will receive no shocks at any time during No shock sets or during the time between the presentations of the cues (ITI) in any of the sets.\nAllow the participant to ask questions about the task at the end of the instructions. Following this, quiz the participant to make sure they completely understand the shock contingencies. Remind the participant that they can discontinue their participation at any point during the experiment.\nSave the EMG signal with acquisition software on the physiology computer and start stimulus presentation software on the stimulus control computer that will control task stimuli.\nCarefully monitor the participant for voluntary movements, closing of eyes, or excessive discomfort.\n5. Post-experiment\nAfter the cued threat task, administer a questionnaire to the participant to verify that the threat contingencies were well understood during the task. Ask the participant to rate how anxious or fearful they were when they saw each threat cue on a 5 point rating scale from 1 (not at all anxious/fearful) to 5 (extremely anxious/fearful).\nNOTE: Results from Bradford et al.7,25 using two separate threat uncertainty tasks have shown a pattern of results in self-reported anxiety which closely matched that of startle potentiation.\nDebrief the participant, compensate them for their time, and dismiss them.\nClean and disinfect all sensors.\n6. Data Processing, Reduction, and Analysis\nNOTE: Researchers can accomplish data processing and reduction with various software packages. EEGLAB36 is a free, open source toolbox for analysis of psychophysiological data within Matlab37. For a template EEGLAB script of data processing and reduction steps please see the supplementary material. Data processing and reduction follow published guidelines27. For a display of a few seconds of the unprocessed (raw) continuous EMG signal surrounding one startle probe, see Figure 4A.",
    "Apply a forward-backward high pass filter (4th order 28 Hz Butterworth filter) to the raw continuous EMG (see Figure 4A,B).\nRectify the filtered continuous EMG (see Figure 4C).\nSmooth the rectified EMG signal using a forward-backward 4th order 30 Hz Butterworth low pass filter (see Figure 4D).\nEpoch the smoothed continuous signal, retaining -50 to 250 msec surrounding the acoustic startle probe onset and “Baseline correct” the epoched signal by subtracting the mean of the pre-probe baseline (-50 to 0 msec) from the entire epoched signal (see Figure 4E).\nScore startle response from each epoch as maximum response between 20 and 100 msec post-probe onset (see Figure 4F).\nReject trials with excessive artifact (e.g., excessive deflections in the pre-probe baseline; see Figure 5).\nNOTE: Signals that contain greater than 40 μV deflections in the pre-probe baseline may be identified as artifact.\nAverage startle response for epochs within each task condition (no-shock, 20% shock, 100% shock) (see Figure 6A).\n\t\nCalculate startle potentiation for uncertain shock as the difference between mean startle response to startle probes during 20% shock cues vs. no-shock cues (see Figure 6B). NOTE: Startle response to ITI probes during the 20% condition can also be measured to study effects of anticipation and sustained startle potentiation relevant to some conceptualizations of anxiety6,21.\nCalculate startle potentiation for certain shock as the difference between mean startle response to startle probes during 100% shock cues vs. no-shock cues (see Figure 6B).\nAnalyze startle potentiation using a General Linear Model with repeated measures on task condition and general startle reactivity (calculated in step 2.5) as an additive or interactive covariate32.\nSubscription Required.
