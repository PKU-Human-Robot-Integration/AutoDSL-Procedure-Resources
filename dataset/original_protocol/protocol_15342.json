    "1. Detection of ROS using carboxy-H2DCFDA\nCarboxy-H2DCFDA is non-fluorescent but in the presence of ROS, when this reagent is oxidized, it becomes green fluorescent.\nImmediately prior to use, prepare a fresh stock solution of carboxy-H2DCFDA in sterile dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or 100% ethanol. Avoid multiple thaw/freeze cycles of your dye.\nWash the cells with HEPES buffered salt solution (HBSS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove traces of the original medium.\nLoad the cells with the dye (and the control dye, cf note section). In this assay we used Jurkat, a human leukemia cell line. Use carboxy-H2DCFDA at a final concentration of 1μM in regular culture medium with reduced serum (2%).\nIncubate the cultures for 30 minutes in the dark, in a conventional incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). Discard all unused dye solutions.\nRemove carboxy-H2DCFDA containing medium and wash twice with HBSS or PBS. From this step forward, protect your cells from light.\nAdd fresh medium containing your drug of choice to the carboxy-H2DCFDA -loaded cells and incubate as desired. For this example we use H2O2 (0.03%) for 1 hour.\nAssess ROS by immediately analyzing your cells by flow cytometry using the FL1 channel (green fluorescence), or by fluorescence plate reader, or by fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence can be detected by using excitation and emission wavelengths that are appropriate for green fluorescence.\nNote: Controls should include carboxy-H2DCFDA-loaded untreated cells and unstained untreated cells. Carboxy-H2DCFDA is known to detect peroxides but could also be oxidized by other ROS. This reagent can also be modified by other means, oxidation insensitive control dye such as 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-DCFDA) should therefore be included in the test.\n2. Measurement of nitric oxide (NO) production\nYou will need Sulfanilamide and N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) solutions, and Nitrite standard. This assay is called the Griess assay.",
    "NED solution : Make a 0.1% solution of N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride diluted in sterile water.Sulfanilamide solution : Make a 1% solution of sulfanilamide diluted in 5% phosphoric acid. Nitrite Standard: Dilute the 0.1M standard stock sodium nitrite to 100μM in sterile medium, do a serial dilution in the same medium.\nStorage Conditions: Store chemicals as directed by manufacturer at room temperature. When reconstituted, NED and Sulfanilamide solutions are stored immediately after use at 4°C, in the dark, and for a maximum of 3 months.\nCulture cells in a 96 well plate, use triplicates for each condition, and include proper controls according to your experiments.\nTreat cells to induce NO production. In our experiment we use lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) and recombinant IL-4 to treat our cells. In this protocol, we used RAW 264.7, a mouse macrophage cell line (Mouse leukaemic monocyte macrophage cell line).\nOn the day of the assay, bring both reagents to room temperature.\nSpin your plate, collect cell supernatants and transfer 50μl to a new 96 well plate. Prepare limiting dilution wells of your standard stock solution to make a standard curve.\nAdd 50μl of Sulfanilamide Solution to each sample and control well and mix well.\nIncubate at room temperature for 10 minutes in the dark.\nAdd 50μl of N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride solution to each sample and control well and mix well.\nIncubate at room temperature for 10 minutes in the dark.\nMeasure absorbance immediately using a plate reader with filter of wavelengths between 520nm and 550nm.\nIf you utilize different plate/dish sizes, use 1/1/1 volume for each solution and sample supernatant.\nA violet color will appear in the positive wells. Results obtained with the standard will help you check the stability of your solutions.\n3. Detection of ROS action: oxidized proteins",
    "A different method to identify the production of ROS is to look at the end results by detecting the oxidation of proteins. Indeed, ROS modify glutathione, an antioxidant that is expressed in most cells and plays a protective role against ROS. Following oxidation by ROS, modification of the reduced glutathione (GSH) results in the sulfhydryl (thiol) group of its cysteine being linked to a second glutathione via a disulfide bridge. This leads to the formation of a dimerized protein (oxidized protein GSSG). GSH can be restored via modification of GSSG by the enzyme glutathione reductase. The increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio reflects oxidative stress. The following assay is based on the detection and quantification of these oxidized proteins. This method is not selective for specific ROS but rather detects the effects of NO, H2O2, O2- and other ROS. Here we measure the total amount of oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione using bioluminescent signals.\nSeed your cells in a 96 well plate (white/transparent, flat bottoms) as usual. For our experiment, we used 1x104 cells per well for adherent Raw 264.7 and A549 cells and suspension Jurkat cells. Depending on the size of your cells these numbers could be adjusted. We recommend to plate adherent cells the day before the test to allow them to attach to the plate. Enough wells should be prepared for oxidized and reduced protein detection as well as for \"medium only\" and untreated cells as controls. Use triplicates for all conditions.",
    "Treat your cells with your drug for the required time. Here we treated Jurkat cells and A549 cells for 1h with H2O2 (at 5mM and 2.5mM respectively). Raw 264.7 cells were treated with 200ng/ml of LPS for 16 h. During this incubation time, bring all your reagents to room temperature (RT). Make all reagents no more than 30 minutes before performing the test. The table below shows the volumes of reagents per well. When possible, it is important to remove the media containing the reducing agent before proceeding with the test.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\n,Adherent cells,Adherent cells,Suspension cells,Suspension cells\n,Total Glu Lysis,Oxidized Glu Lysis,Total Glu Lysis,Oxidized Glu Lysis\n\"NEM, 25mM\",none,0.5μl,none,0.5μl\nLuciferin-NT,1 μl,1 μl,1 μl,1 μl\n\"Passive Lysis Buffer, 5X\",10μl,10μl,10μl,10μl\nDistilled water,39.0μl,38.5μl,14μl,13.5μl\nFinal volume per well,50μl,50μl,25μl,25μl\nRemove medium from wells with adherent cells.
