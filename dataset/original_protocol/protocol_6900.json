  "title": "Measurement of Transgene Copy Number in Plants Using Droplet Digital PCR",
  "procedures": [
    "In this procedure, transgene copy number is determined by performing two PCR reactions for each sample. The first amplifies a region of the transgene (target gene), and the second amplifies a region of an endogenous gene of known copy number (reference gene). An alternative method is multiplex amplification of the target and reference gene using hydrolysis probes for detection; primers and probes for several plant reference genes have been previously reported (Collier et al., 2017).Primer design and selection of restriction endonucleaseUse primer design software (e.g., Primer 3) to select primers that amplify a 100-120 base pair region of both the transgene target and reference gene. Primers should optimally have annealing temperatures of ~60°C, similar estimated binding kinetics, and minimal dimerization.Check that each primer pair efficiently amplifies the desired target in a test PCR reaction. Include control reactions with (i) genomic DNA from a wild-type non-transgenic plant, and (ii) no DNA. Assemble the reaction as shown in Table 1.Table 1.

    "Visualize the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis, ensuring that single clear bands of the expected sizes are obtained for both sets of primers.Digesting genomic DNA before amplification will ensure that, even if there are two copies of the transgene inserted in tandem, each copy will be on a separate DNA molecule and therefore in a separate droplet. Analyze the transgene sequence for the presence of restriction endonuclease (RE) recognition sequences using sequence analysis software (e.g., Benchling). Select an RE with at least one recognition site within the transgene but no sites between the primers of either the target or reference gene. Avoid the use of restriction endonucleases sensitive to methylation.ddPCR set-upGood quality genomic DNA is required for ddPCR. A cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based method or a commercial plant DNA extraction kit will provide sufficiently pure genomic DNA. Each ddPCR reaction will generally require 5-50 ng genomic DNA.Notes: To accurately quantitate DNA concentration, we recommend the use of a Qubit fluorometer. The exact quantity of genomic DNA used in each reaction needs to be optimized for the genome size of the organism. Digest each sample of genomic DNA using the selected RE. An example restriction digestion reaction is shown in Table 3. Different quantities of enzyme and buffer will be required depending on the manufacturer and concentration of the enzyme. Aim to include ~10-30 U enzyme per g genomic DNA.Note: The EvaGreen® product notes indicate that digestion of genomic DNA can also be performed by adding 1 μl (2-5 U) desired restriction endonuclease to the PCR reaction. Table 3.

    "Inactivate the RE by heating. The exact temperature and length of incubation will depend on the specific enzyme and manufacturer. Following inactivation, the digested genomic DNA can be used directly in the next step without further clean-up.Assemble the PCR reactions in the order shown in Table 4. In addition to the sample reactions, set up control reactions with (i) genomic DNA from a wild-type non-transgenic plant and (ii) no DNA. It is critical that the assembled ddPCR reactions are well mixed prior to proceeding to droplet generation, as every droplet must contain the same concentration of each component.Table 4.

    "Note: If multiple samples are being analyzed, as for other PCR methods, it is recommended to make a master mix and dilute concentrated DNA prior to assembling the ddPCR reaction. Droplet generationOpen a DG8 TM Cartridge Holder by pressing the middle latches.Insert the DG8TM Cartridge into the holder and close the holder by pressing the two halves together (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4075/bioprotoc-11-13-4075-g001.jpgFigure 1. Workflow of droplet generation. The PCR reactions and oil are added to a cartridge, which is inserted into the holder and held in place by the gasket. Following droplet generation, the emulsified reactions are transferred to a microtiter plate for thermal cycling.Load each 20-µl reaction assembled in the previous step into individual sample wells of a DG8TM Cartridge using a multichannel pipette.Add 70 μl QX200 Droplet Generation Oil for EvaGreen® into the oil wells.Cover the cartridge with the DG8TM Gasket. Loop the holes of the gasket over the four hooks on the cartridge holder to hold the gasket in place.Open the DG8 droplet generator and insert the cartridge holder. Close the lid by pressing the button. The generator will start automatically.Transfer the entire volume of the droplet emulsion (typically 40 μl) to the desired wells of a semi-skirted 96-well ddPCR plate (Figure 1). Cover the plate with a pierceable foil plate heat seal and attach using a plate-sealer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Rotate the plate and repeat this step to ensure the foil is fully attached.Note: To avoid disrupting the emulsified droplets, take care to pipette very slowly. Wide-bore pipette tips (or pipette tips with the extremity removed using a blade) can be used. Place the sealed plate into a thermal cycler and use exactly the same cycling conditions as those used in the test PCR (see Table 2).",
    "During the initial heat cycle, the oil surrounding each droplet will thermoset.Droplet countingWhen the PCR cycle is complete, switch on the QX200TM droplet reader and open the QuantaSoftTM software.In the QuantaSoftTM software, start a new experiment (Template > New).Select the wells to be detected and enter the sample names or record the well positions for target and reference genes for each sample.Select the key parameters in the well editor as follows:Experiment: ABS (absolute quantitation).Note: The QuantaSoftTM software provides three default experiments: Absolute Quantitation (ABS), Rare Event Detection (RED), and Copy Number Variation (CNV). Both ABS and CNV can be used for copy number determination. For CNV mode, a known reference gene copy number needs to be provided. The ABS mode is more flexible. For example, the copy number of the reference gene is not required, and the relative ratio of target and reference can be calculated. Supermix: QX200TM ddPCR EvaGreen Supermix.Target 1 type: Ch1 Unknown.Target 2 type: Ch2 Unknown.Name: Enter sample names, e.g., transgenic line x, reference gene. This can help to distinguish which wells are for transgene and which are for reference genes.Apply the chosen parameters to the selected wells by clicking ‘OK’.Remove the PCR plate from the thermocycler and insert into the base of a plate-reader holder. Cover the plate with the lid and press the latches to lock the holder.Open the QX200TM droplet reader, insert the plate-reader holder, and close the lid.Check that the indicator lights for ‘power’, ‘bottle levels’, and ‘plate in place’ are green.Click ‘Run’ in the QuantaSoftTM software. Select EvaGreen in the ‘Run Option’ dialog. Click OK to start the reading."
