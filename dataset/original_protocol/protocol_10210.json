    "1. Material Preparation\nFill 2 g of PCL in a 3 mL plastic syringe with a funnel and insert a piston into the open end.\nPlace the syringe in a preheated oven at 65 °C for 8 h. Point the tip upwards to allow the air bubbles to aggregate close to the opening.\nPush the piston with a thin object to release the trapped air within the molten material.\nLet it cool down to room temperature, which is achieved when the polymer is not transparent anymore after 10 minutes.\nStore the PCL pre-loaded syringe at room temperature in a dry and dark environment until it is used.\n2. Hardware and Software Setup\nAttach a 23G flat tipped needle (spinneret) to the syringe and a barrel adapter at the other end to connect the syringe to the air pressure system.\nPlace the syringe in the print head and press it down until the spinneret tip stands out 1 mm from the brass part on the bottom side of the head.\nMount a collector on the stage and clean the surface as well as the print head with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol to remove dust or residual polymer.\nSet the working distance by positioning a 12 mm high object between the spinneret and the collector and lower the print head until the spinneret tip just touches it.\nAdjust the temperature regulators at the electrical box to 82 °C and 65 °C for the spinneret region and the syringe, respectively and power them on to melt the PCL.\nWait for at least 10 min until the polymer is molten and initiate the air pressure by setting the regulator to 1.8 bar.",
    "Prepare the G-Code to define the size and shape, inter-filament distance and the number of layers of the scaffold and the collection speed of the process.\n\tNOTE: A detailed template for fabricating flat and tubular scaffolds is provided in the discussion chapter (Table 2).\nDouble-check manually that all ground cables are connected securely to the enclosure and the wall plug.\nStart the software (e.g., MACH 3) on the computer and upload the prepared G-code.\n3. Scaffold fabrication\nClose the front door of the enclosure, which connects the safety interlock and triggers the high voltage supply to the spinneret.\n\tNOTE: Once the door is opened, for example when a print is finished or in case of an emergency, the high voltage drops and the scaffold can be removed safely.\nIncrease the high voltage gradually in 0.2 kV steps until a Taylor cone is formed and a fiber is ejected towards the collector (see exemplary Taylor cone in Figure 1D).\nAllow the polymer melt to be extruded on the still collector plate to stabilize the jet without movement for 5 minutes. Remove the pile of material before commencing a new print.\nUse the cursors on the keyboard to move the print head above the point where the G-codes will start.\nStart the G-Code in the software on the computer.\n4. Fiber Diameter Adjustment\nKeep the working distance (12 mm) and the temperature regulators (82 °C and 65 °C for the spinneret region and the syringe, respectively) on a constant level, as described before in steps 2.4 and 2.5.\n\tNOTE: A summary of adjusting different diameters is given in Table 3.\nPrint fibers with small sized diameters (3-10 µm). Reduce the air pressure level to 0.8 bar, adjust the applied voltage to 8 kV and set the collector speed to 1700 mm/min.",
    "Print fibers with medium sized diameters (10-20 µm). Adjust the air pressure level to 1.5 bar, set voltage to 11 kV and lower the collection speed to 1200 mm/min.\nPrint fibers with large diameters (20-30 µm). Increase the air pressure level to 2.6 bar, alter the applied voltage to 12 kV and decrease the collection speed to 700 mm/min.\n5. Jet Optimization\nIlluminate the jet with a strong LED light from outside the enclosure for improved visibility.\nObserve the behavior of the fiber for 1 minute and adjust the system parameters to optimize the process in small steps, i.e. 0.1 kV for applied voltage, 100 mm/min for collection speed and 0.1 bar for air pressure.\n\tNOTE: A summary is given in Table 4.\nStabilize periodically deflecting behavior by decreasing the air-pressure, increasing the speed and minimizing the voltage until the flight path of the fiber resembles a stable catenary curve for more than 3 minutes.\nCorrect the flight path of a lagging behind jet by increasing the voltage, reducing the air pressure and reducing the speed of the collector. Apply those measures until the flight path of the fiber moves back to a catenary curve shape.\nAvoid fibers travelling vertically towards the collector by decreasing the applied voltage, increasing the speed of the collector and increasing the air pressure until the flight path of the jet retains the shape of a catenary curve again.\n6. Scaffold Collection\nOpen the door when the print is finished and use the cursor to move the collector plate towards the door for better accessibility.\nSpray the scaffold with ethanol 70% (vol/vol) mix and wait 10 seconds until it visibly detaches from the collector.\nCollect the finished scaffold by grabbing one edge with tweezers and lifting it out of the enclosure.\n7. Troubleshooting",
    "Decrease the applied voltage or open the door immediately if there is a spark between the spinneret visible or a cracking noise audible.\nRemove all hazardous materials and liquids such as ethanol 70% (vol/vol) from the inside of the enclosure as a fire might ignite in case of potential sparking.\nProgram the G-Code accordingly that the spinneret moves away from the area where the scaffold is printed after all layers are done. This avoids material accumulation above the point where the spinneret finally stops.\nCheck the spinneret under a magnifier and verify that there is no damage to the spinneret as this will significantly influence the homogeneity of the Taylor cone.\nSubscription Required.
