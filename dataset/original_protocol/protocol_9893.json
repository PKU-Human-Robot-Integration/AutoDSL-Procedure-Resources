    "1. Preparation of crystals in a high viscous media using glass syringes\nCentrifuge the crystal solution gently (~1,000 x g, ~10 min at 22 °C) to form a soft crystal pellet and remove the excess buffer. This will result in a high concentration of crystals in the pellet which can be used for data collection.\n\tNOTE: To prevent dilution of the viscous media increase the crystal concentration at this step. Optimize the ratio of viscous media to crystal volume for each sample to obtain a high concentration of crystals whilst maintaining a high viscosity for the media. Centrifuge the crystal solution to form a pellet and remove excess buffer to increase the crystal concentration in the solution, as described in Darmanin et. al.29.\nSet up two 100 µL syringes with a coupler.\nFasten the coupler to the end of the first syringe and add 28 µL of crystal solution to the top of the syringe. Slowly, insert the plunger into the top of the syringe and gently push the solution down to the end of the coupler tip, removing any air bubbles that form. Do this by following one of the two methods discussed below.\n\tNOTE: The volume of crystals to be added to the high viscous media can be varied if it does not significantly change the viscosity of the overall sample.\n\t\nFirst method: Use rapid pressure changes to burst the air bubbles.\n\t\t\nCarefully place one gloved finger on the top of the blunted coupler needle point and (very gently) apply pressure to create a seal. Do not apply too much pressure as this may result in a needle stick injury.\nNow pull the plunger back to draw the solution away from the needle point, this will generate a buildup of pressure in the syringe.",
    "Quickly release the pressure at the top of the syringe by removing the gloved finger from the blunted needle tip. Be careful, if the sample is too close to the tip when the finger is removed it may spray out resulting in loss of sample. The rapid change in pressure within the syringe will burst the air bubbles. Repeat until all bubbles have been removed.\nSecond method: Using the ‘human centrifuge’ to remove air bubbles.\n\t\t\nPlace the syringe in one hand with the needle facing upwards and the plunger wedged between two fingers, so that it cannot move.\nQuickly rotate the arm holding the syringe in one direction 2–3 times, the resulting centrifugal force on the sample will force any air bubbles out of the syringe. Be careful, if done too slowly sample can be lost.\nInspect the syringe for air bubbles, if bubbles remain, repeat steps 1.3.2.1 – 1.3.2.2 until all the air bubbles are removed.\nUsing a fine spatula, add ~42 µL of high vacuum silicone grease directly to the top of the second syringe. Push the plunger all the way down to the end, removing all the air bubbles and ensuring that there is no air gap in the end of the syringe.",
    "NOTE: The precise composition of the silicone grease is not critical as it is acting as an inert carrier. A viscosity value of >10 Pa.s or ratio of approximately 60:40 silicone grease to crystal solution is optimal for injection, however, it is possible this may vary depending on the exact characteristics of the sample. Adjust the volume of crystal solution added to the silicone grease to optimize the crystal concentration in the mixture, as outlined in the discussion. High-viscous media other than silicone grease can be used as long as they are compatible with the sample30,31,32,33.\nEnsure there are no air bubbles in either of the two syringes and attach the syringes together using the coupler. Hold the syringes vertically by griping just the end of the syringe as warming up the syringe due to the heat generated from fingers can affect the sample.\nMix the sample together by gently depressing the plunger on the crystal solution side so that it mixes into the silicone grease and then push the plunger on the silicone grease side, so that it pushes the sample back towards the crystal solution side. Gently, repeat this process 50 to 100 times so that the sample is mixed thoroughly and looks homogeneous.\n\tNOTE: If the crystals are grown directly in highly viscous media (e.g., lipidic cubic phase, LCP), steps 1.1–1.6 are not required. Protocols for growing crystals within the syringes can be found in Liu et.al.34,35. Follow this protocol up to sample consolidation, step 10, where all the sample is now contained in one syringe and the crystallization buffer is removed. The addition of 7.9MAG is not required for this protocol. Instead, remove all excess liquid from the syringe by gently pushing the plunger down in the sample until no more liquid remains in the syringe.",
    "Visualize the crystals under an optical microscope either through the syringe or, for best results, extract a small amount (~1 µL) on to a glass slide and place a cover slip on the top.\nCheck crystal concentration.\n\t\nDetermine the crystal concentration in the silicone grease by counting the number of crystals in a specific area using the optical microscope images. For best results, a high density of crystals uniformly dispensed throughout the media is ideal (>106 crystals/mL) in order to obtain a high crystal-hit rate.\nAdjust the crystal concentration in the syringe by changing the ratio of crystals to viscous media in steps 1.3 and 1.4.\n\t\t\nTo decrease the crystal concentration, dilute the crystals in the syringe by increasing the amount of silicone grease/HV media at step 1.4 or by diluting the crystal pellet in solution with the crystallization buffer prior to setting up the syringes in step 1.1.\nTo increase the crystal concentration, decrease the amount of silicone grease in step 1.4 but be mindful not to reduce the viscosity below 10 Pa.s.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The crystal concentration reported here was optimized for this specific sample and crystal size. However, the ideal crystal concentration will depend on the crystal size, beam size, the needle Internal Diameter (I.D.), and the incident X-ray flux. This can be determined from the hit rate with an optimal hit rate of ~30% considered as 'good'. In practice, the crystal concentration must be optimized for different samples during beam time to obtain the desired hit rate. Start with a high concentration of crystals, 109 crystals/mL. The procedure for adjusting the crystal concentration is given in Liu et.al.35.\nThe protocol can be paused here until the injector is ready for data collection.",
    "If the crystals are grown in LCP, then seal them and let them remain in syringes for up to a few days at room temperature.\nIf the crystals have been transferred to a different high viscous media (e.g., silicone grease), then a stability test of the crystals over time should be carried out prior to the measurement. This will determine how long the crystals are stable in the inert media (ideally > 8 h) and the time limit for data collection. Here, lysozyme crystals were stable for days in silicone grease and did not show signs of dissolving when inspected using an optical microscope.\nMove all the sample into one syringe prior to disconnecting the coupler. Disconnect the coupler from the syringe and attach the injection needle. Screw the needle firmly into the base of the syringe and ensure that it is fastened tightly to prevent any leakages. A 108 µm I.D. needle (needle length 13 mm, point style 3) was used for this experiment. Depending on the crystal size and the beam size attach either a 51 µm or 108 µm I.D. needle.\n\tNOTE: Pre-testing of the sample stream prior to beam time is required to be able to select the correct injector needle size. Depending on the sample characteristics (i.e., viscosity, charging, buffer composition) and the needle I.D., the samples will flow differently. Therefore, it is recommended to test a variety of needle sizes to produce the most stable stream with the smallest possible I.D. needle to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio during data collection.\nIf the injector is already mounted and aligned on the beam line move to section 3 and mount the sample syringe directly onto the injector.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Injector mounting and control",
    "Mount the injector onto the beamline. Remove the cryogenic nozzle on the MX2 beamline and replaced it with the injector. Loosen the clamping screw that holds the cryogenic nozzle and attach it to the bracket located next to the motorized stage.\nLift the injector up from its trolley by holding the black handle and place it on the motorized stage.\n\t\nTo fasten the injector to the motorized stage; hand tighten the black clamping screw knob.\nMount an empty syringe onto the injector\n\t\nIn the injector computer control interface (i.e., EPOS position control software), select Homing Mode under Tools in the software menu. Then select Negative Limit Switch, and Start Homing, let the software run until the screw is retracted sufficiently for the syringe to fit under the screw. If left to run unsupervised the limit switch stops the screw automatically.\nMount an empty (‘dummy’) syringe onto the injector by inserting the needle through the slit in the syringe holder. Line up the syringe against the bracket.\nFasten the syringe with two O-rings.\n\t\t\nWrap the first O-ring across the mid-section of the syringe attaching it to the hooks on either side of the syringe.\nLoop the second O-ring around the hooks on the upper section of the syringe and then put one part of the O-ring on the top of the glass syringe as shown in the demonstration and Figure 1B.\nAlign the injector to X-ray beam\n\t\nMove the motorized stage with the injector towards the X-ray interaction point via the beamline control software. This can be visualized using the inline camera. The size and position of the beam is denoted by a red cross on the screen and the motorized stage can be moved to align the needle with the X-ray interaction region.",
    "Adjust the x and y position of the stage to align the needle with the red cross.\nAdjust the z position until the needle tip comes into focus.\nVerify alignment of the needle tip and X-ray beam visually by checking that the syringe tip meets the crosshairs which are visible in the optical microscope image generated by the beamline camera.\nOnce the needle tip is aligned move the tip above the cross hairs ~100 µm. This eliminates x-ray scatter from the needle tip.\n\t\tNOTE: Mounting and aligning the injector on the MX2 beamline at the synchrotron must be carried out by the beamline scientists and can be completed in less than 30 min.\n3. Mounting the sample syringe\nReplace the empty syringe with the sample syringe by following step 2.3.\nPlace the injector cap on the sample syringe plunger head.\nMove the drive screw to the top of the cap.\nIn the injector control software select Velocity Mode.\nInput 3000 rpm (~115 nL/s) as the Setting Value and press Apply Setting Value.\nWhen the drive screw touches the cap on the syringe plunger head, stop the motor.\n\t\nSet the rpm value to zero in the injector control software by changing the Setting Value to ‘0’ as the screw approaches the cap.\nOnce contact is made, activate the preset value by pressing Apply Setting Value to stop the screw instantly.\nGently wiggle the cap to make sure that it is firmly held in place.\n\tNOTE: Whenever a new set value is entered in the Setting Value box in the control software it is only activated after pressing Apply Setting Value.\n4. Running the injector",
    "After the cap drive screw has made firm contact with the top of the plunger change the rpm Setting Value to 100. This is equivalent to ~ 4 nL/s.\nVisually inspect the needle tip when the sample first comes out or look at the beamline camera image of the needle to observe when the sample starts to extrude from the needle tip.\nPerform a search of the hutch, close the hutch door, and turn on the X-ray beam. From this point the injector must be operated remotely from outside of the hutch.\nTune the rpm until a stable stream is generated.\n\t\nDecrease the rpm Setting Value to 90.\nRepeat step 4.4.1, decreasing the rpm Setting Value in increments of 10, to slow down the stream but still maintain a stable stream. For silicone grease a value of 30 rpm was used.\n\t\tNOTE: The typical rpm range varies between 30 – 100 rpm (1 – 4 nL/s) depending on the sample characteristics and X-ray exposure time. In general, the rpm should be tuned to produce the slowest flow rate (to minimize sample consumption) whilst maintaining a stable stream.\nManaging a sample stream that does not flow well.\n\t\nKeep increasing the rpm Setting Value in increments of 10 until the stream gets straighter. If the stream does not stabilize, even after increasing the rpm Setting Value to the maximum value of 100 rpm try to improve the stability by implementing one of the two methods described below.\n\t\t\nFirst method: Insert a polystyrene sample catcher underneath the sample stream to help guide the sample. This method works well for highly charged sample streams.",
    "Second method: Insert a venturi suction funnel to the sample catcher. To supply air to the funnel, connect it to the air outlet tube located in the hutch. This method can aid in directing and stabilizing the sample flow independent of the charge of the stream.\nOnce a constant and steady stream is achieved, start data collection, and optimize the detector distance as per a normal X-ray crystallography experiment.\n\tNOTE: The rpm is converted to flow rate using the supplied conversion table in the Supplementary Information, ‘Lipidico Device Calculator’. Enter the rpm value, needle diameters, and syringe volumes to calculate the flow rate using this calculator.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
