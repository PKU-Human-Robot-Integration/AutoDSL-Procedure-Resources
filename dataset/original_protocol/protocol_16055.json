    "Fixation is an important step to preserve the structural features of the developing brain. It is preferable to use Bouin's fixative for the whole embryo where preservation of morphology is important. After immersion fixation, brain samples are dissected and transferred to 70% ethanol before being embedded in paraffin wax. For standardization purposes, the number of days the sample is left in ethanol needs to be consistent between samples to limit unwanted variation due to tissue shrinkage. Although coronal and sagittal sections could be done using the same embryo, we recommend the use of one embryo per orientation (coronal or sagittal) should you need the two orientations to address more specific questions. There are a small number of specific steps should you opt for coronal or sagittal sections. For the sagittal plane, the brain is cut into two halves along the midline. For the coronal plane, the brain must be cut at the level of interest relative to Bregma. Coronal-specific instructions are indicated as cor-, whereas sagittal-specific instructions are indicated as sag-.\nMaterials\nGestant female mouse\nBouin's fixative (e.g., Fischer Scientific, cat. no. 001401)\n70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol (e.g., Fischer Scientific, cat. no. 10041814)\nXylene\nParaffin wax (e.g., CliniSciences, cat. no. 4810025)\nDissection instruments: \n               \nSurgical scissors (e.g., Dominique Dutscher, cat. no. 2492680)\nExtra-thin straight scissors (e.g., Dominique Dutscher, cat. no. 2522789)\nShort forceps (e.g., Dominique Dutscher, cat. no. 2522705)\nLong forceps (e.g., Dominique Dutscher, cat. no. 2522689)\nSurgical blade (e.g., Braun Medical AS, cat. no. 16600584)\nForceps, #5 (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Euthanize gestant female mouse at E18.5 (1 day before birth) using an approved method.\nWe typically use cervical dislocation to avoid any potential artifacts from chemical agents.\nGestant female mice can be obtained through timed pregnancy when the exact day of mating is known. Avoid 129 substrains of mice, which naturally have corpus callosum dysgenesis.",
    "To set up timed pregnancy, we use trio mating (one male with two females) overnight and remove the male from the cage in the morning. Day 0 is defined as the midpoint of the prior dark cycle where conception occurs, and day 0.5 is the morning of the day after mating. The number of trio mating cages should be calculated with respect to the number of samples required (see Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting, Number and Statistical Analysis). We typically use 10 trio mating cages to obtain 6 samples per genotype per gender and collect embryos 18.5 days after setting up the breeding cages (E18.5) in the morning. This stage of mouse embryo development corresponds to late organogenesis when tissues have differentiated and developed into fully recognizable organs. For comparison purposes, using the human staging convention, the last trimester of the human fetus corresponds to the period between E18.5 and postnatal day 10 in the mouse.\n2. Remove fetus from the embryonic sac, and keep embryo cold on ice with a paper towel or other barriers between the embryo and the ice. If the head and rest of the body are required for independent experiments, harvest and process the head separately (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001],B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001]), instead of processing the full body, following the same steps below (except for steps 4 and 11, which are no longer required).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b5b7915a-932b-4ce8-8bda-081640a39051/cpz1509-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",

Cut a piece of embryonic tail at the tip for genotyping and sexing purposes.\n7. Fix embryos in a 15-ml conical tube containing 10 ml Bouin's fixative for exactly 48 hr at room temperature away from direct sunlight. To allow better absorption of the fixative, pinch skin and make a lateral incision in the neck with surgical scissors.\nBouin's fixative is a mixture of compounds and consists of formaldehyde, picric acid, and acetic acid. Picric acid is the component of Bouin's solution that results in the characteristic yellow color.\nCAUTION: Bouin's fixative solution is hazardous and flammable. Avoid skin and eyes contact, inhalation, and ingestion. In case of contact with eyes or skin, rinse immediately with plenty of soap and water, and seek medical advice. In case of inhalation, move the person to fresh air.",
    "8. Transfer embryos to a new 15-ml conical tube containing 10 ml of 70% ethanol for a few days.\nWe typically incubate for 7 days in ethanol.\nDissect embryonic mouse brain samples\n9. Print a unique barcode on small histological cassettes using an Inkjet cassette printer to uniquely label individual brain samples.\nOur laboratory uses a barcoding system consisting of a letter (“M” for mouse) followed by eight digits, which are the primary key for each embryonic brain sample we process (e.g., M00000001):\ncor- Three cassettes are required for the coronal plane printed with the same unique barcode preceded by a number: 1 refers to the forebrain, 2 the midbrain, and 3 the hindbrain of the brain tissue of interest (e.g., 1_M00000001, 2_M00000001, and 3_M00000001).\nsag- Two cassettes are required for the sagittal plane printed with the same unique barcode preceded by the number 4 for the right hemisphere and 5 for the left hemisphere (e.g., 4_M00000001 and 5_M00000001).\nA project manager should be in charge of the scientific research, deciding on the sectioning orientation and keeping the experimenter blind to the genotype as recommended in the ARRIVE guidelines (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines[href=https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines]).\n10.

Cut neck close to the base using a pair of surgical scissors to harvest the head of the embryo (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001]).\n12. Carefully stabilize head of the embryo using short forceps, pinching laterally at the tip of the head without touching the actual brain tissue (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001]).\n13. Carefully peel away the calvaria, and gently pull the skin and meninges away from the brain using the tip of #5 forceps (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001]-G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001]).",
    "It is important not to damage the brain while dissecting. Bear in mind the slightest puncture while dissecting the brain will have a strong impact on the final sectioning quality.\n14. Recover intact embryonic brain sample (Fig. 1H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001]), and take a high-quality picture for future records.\nA database system is advised for the storage of brain pictures in large-scale projects. Our laboratory uses Filemaker Pro to store pictures and facilitate project management. This is described in detail in our previous protocols (see Current Protocols article: Collins et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0004]).\n15.

Then cut the anterior chunk coronally into two parts of equal size.\nsag- Trim along the median sagittal suture using a scalpel (Fig. 1J[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001]') to obtain two halves of tissue (right and left hemispheres).\n17. Put each trimmed brain tissue into its corresponding preprinted histological cassette prepared in step 9 (Fig. 1K[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0001]).\n18. Place cassettes in a glass bottle with lid filled with 70% ethanol.\nPerform dehydration and paraffin embedding\n19. Transfer histological cassettes containing the trimmed embryonic brain tissues to the basket of the tissue processor.\nThe basket can contain hundreds of cassettes, which can be processed simultaneously.\n20. Set paraffin bath of the tissue processor to 59°C.\n21. Place basket in the processor, and begin the paraffin infiltration process, including ethanol, xylene, and paraffin (see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-tbl-0001] for incubation steps).\nThe paraffin infiltration process takes about 15 hr and includes dehydration with ethanol, replacement of ethanol with solvent (e.g., xylene), and infiltration with paraffin.",
    "CAUTION: Xylene is a highly toxic and flammable liquid. Avoid skin and eye contact and inhalation. In case of contact with eyes or skin, rinse immediately with plenty of water, and seek medical advice.

The base of the original cassette is then immediately placed on top of the mold. (C) The mold is placed on the cooling unit set at −5°C, allowing the paraffin to solidify. (D) The formed paraffin block is removed from the mold.\n23. Remove brain tissue from each cassette, and place individual chunk in the center of a metal base mold.\n24. Fill mold with hot paraffin (preheated to 59°C) up to the internal rounded corners of the mold (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0002]).\nExcess paraffin at this step will require removal of the solidified paraffin later on before sectioning.\n25.

    "sag- Orient left and right halves so that the cerebellum faces toward the printed side of the cassette.\nThe correct orientation of the tissue in the cassette is important for minimization of tissue loss during sectioning and for maximization of storage for future experiments.\n26. Place base (labeled half) of the cassette at the brim of the mold.\n27. Place mold on the cold plate at −5°C, and let paraffin cool down (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0002]).\nIt may take up to 10 min for the paraffin to solidify.\n28. Remove formed paraffin block from the mold, and store at room temperature until sectioning (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0002]).",
    "In this protocol we describe the steps involved in (1) sectioning embryonic brain tissue embedded in paraffin blocks using a sliding microtome; (2) staining of slides using Nissl stain; and (3) scanning of the histological slides using a NanoZoomer whole-slide scanner. We highly recommend using the NanoZoomer scanner to produce cell-resolution digital images in a high-throughput setting, although other whole-slide scanners or motorized XY microscopes capable of imaging could be used if the NanoZoomer is not available at your institution. The sectioning process relies on a set of well-defined anatomical landmarks in the embryonic mouse brain that correspond to previously defined positions in the adult mouse brain both on coronal and sagittal planes (see Current Protocols articles: Collins et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0004]; Mikhaleva et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0011]). The sagittal plane allows for simultaneously testing three main regions involved in cognition: cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The coronal plane permits the study of the right and left hemispheres. The benefits of each plane are described in more detail in a Current Protocols article by Collins et al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0004]). The staining process relies on neuronal Nissl bodies of the endoplasmic reticulum, stained purple using cresyl violet, to identify neuronal structures in the embryonic brain. It is worthwhile to mention that the main development of myelination in the mouse brain starts during the first postnatal months. It is thus not necessary to stain myelin with Luxol as done in our previous protocols adapted for the adult mouse (Collins et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0004]; Mikhaleva et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0011]). The scanning process generates two formats—TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) and NDPI (NanoZoomer Digital Pathology Image). However, we recommend the use of the nonproprietary TIFF format throughout the protocol for data collection (Basic Protocols 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-prot-0003] and 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-prot-0004]).\nMaterials\nPeptone water (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-rec-0002])\nParaffin-embedded embryonic brain tissue (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-prot-0001])",

    "cor- In our laboratory, we use and recommend three sections on the coronal plane of the embryonic brain: Bregma +2.19 mm, Bregma +3.51 mm, and Bregma +6.75 mm. Overall, the shape of three key structures is sufficient to determine the position of the section, namely the corpus callosum (for Bregma +2.19 mm), the hippocampus (for Bregma +3.51 mm), and the ventricles (for all three Bregma positions). In contrast to our protocol in adult mice (see Current Protocols article: Mikhaleva et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0011]), the soma of the corpus callosum is not used as a landmark to recognize the embryonic brain at Bregma +3.51 mm because the soma only develops postnatally.\nsag- We use one section on the sagittal plane at Lateral +0.60 mm.

    "Our histology pipeline on the coronal plane is designed based on three sections of interest at Bregma +2.19 mm, Bregma +3.51 mm, and Bregma +6.75 mm, spanning 28 developmentally distinct brain regions of E18.5 mouse embryos (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0004]). Some parameters can be taken twice per section, on the right and left hemispheres, totaling 66 neuroanatomical measurements including 19 at Bregma +2.19 mm (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-tbl-0003]), 29 at Bregma +3.51 mm (Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-tbl-0004]), and 18 at Bregma +6.75 mm (Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-tbl-0005]). Some parameters are common across the three sections, and some are specific to the section of interest. Parameters involve measurements of area and length. For large-scale projects, we recommend a well-designed database to accommodate the large amount of E18.5 morphometric data as described in detail in our previous papers (see Current Protocols articles: Collins et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0004]; Mikhaleva et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0011]). Each image is checked for quality control before analysis. Staff should be trained and competent to perform the measurements. Once staff are fully trained, it takes an estimated 20 to 30 min per section to make the measurements and another 50 to 60 min to verify the measurements, assess the quality of the measures, and rectify any potential human errors.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e03aa456-5ee6-4563-a7e1-e32b3354a720/cpz1509-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nCoronal sections of interest at embryonic day 18.5 in mouse brain and corresponding 106 measurements.

    "The main benefit of using one single section (e.g., Lateral +0.60 mm) on the sagittal plane is to reduce time to determine whether there is a presence or absence of brain structural changes. Time being one important factor in large-scale neuroanatomical studies of embryonic brain samples, we recommend the sagittal plane for projects involving thousands of samples. For such projects, we recommend a relational database to accommodate large amount of morphometric data, multiple quality control steps, and statistical analysis, as described in detail in our previous papers (see Current Protocols articles: Collins et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0004]; Mikhaleva et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-bib-0011]). Each image is checked for quality control before analysis. Staff should be trained and competent to perform the measurements. Once staff are fully trained, it takes an estimated 20 to 30 min per image to make the measurements and another 50 to 60 min to verify the measurements, assess the quality of the measures, and rectify any potential human errors. The sagittal measurements are based on 40 well-defined neuroanatomical brain parameters on the sagittal plane spanning 21 developmentally distinct brain regions of E18.5 mouse embryos (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0005]). Overall, 15 of the 40 parameters correspond to length measurements (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0005]; indicated in red) and the remaining 25 to area measurements (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.509#cpz1509-fig-0005]; indicated in black).

Measure area (Cg_area) and length (Cg_length) of the developing cingulate cortex by drawing a vertical line from the left-hand-side apex of the Cg_area measurement upward until reaching the TB_area lining.\n20. Measure length of the motor cortex that partially corresponds to the secondary motor cortex (M2_length) by joining two points previously defined as the junction between the olfactory bulb and the rest of the brain and the point making the left-hand-side edge of the neuroepithelial zone area.\n21. Delineate area of the caudate putamen (CPu_area) drawing a line around the developing striatum.\n22. Delineate area of thalamic nucleus 1 (Th1_area) and nucleus 2 (Th2_area) drawing independently around each nucleus.",
    "23. Delineate area of the anterior commissure (aca_area).\nThere should not be a split of the anterior commissure at position Lateral +0.60 mm, which occurs posteriorly.\nThe anterior commissure is made of white matter, and delineation is facilitated by lighter straining. This is also true for the fornix, fimbria of the hippocampus, stria medullaris, and optic chiasm.\n24. Delineate area of the fornix (f_area).\n25. Delineate area of the fimbria (fi_area) of the hippocampus located immediately below the hippocampus.\n26. Delineate area of the stria medullaris (sm_area) located below the thalamus.\n27. Delineate area of the optic chiasm (Och_area).\nThe optic chiasm can sometimes be detached from the brain. Measurements can still be taken unless the structure has been damaged during dissection.\n28. Delineate area of the inferior colliculus (InfC_area).\n29. Delineate area of the superior colliculus (SupC_area).\n30. Delineate area of the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt_area).\n31. Delineate area of the pontine nuclei (Pn_area).\n32. Measure height of the pons (Pons_height) by joining the reference point between the hindbrain and the rest of the brain and the point delineating the upper base of the developing cerebellum.\n33. Delineate total area of the developing cerebellum (TC_area).\n34. Delineate total area of the lateral ventricle (LV_area).\nAssess quality of data collected and perform downstream analysis\n35. Check data collected for the presence of outliers, typographical errors, and any other erroneous measurements, and correct measurement if necessary.\n36. Ask project manager to reveal the genotype.\n37. Check data distribution within each genotype group, and correct measurement if necessary.\n38. Produce final set of verified raw data.\n39. Proceed with statistical analysis (see Number and Statistical Analysis)."
