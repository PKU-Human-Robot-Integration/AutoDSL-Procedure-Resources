    "The previously established transgenic lines used in this study were Tg(ins:GCaMP6s;cryaa:mCherry)6, Tg(ins:cdt1-mCherry;cryaa:CFP)14. All experiments were carried out in compliance with European Union and German laws (Tierschutzgesetz) and with the approval of the TU Dresden and the Landesdirektion Sachsen Ethics Committees (approval numbers: AZ 24D-9168,11-1/2013-14, TV38/2015, T12/2016, and T13/2016, TVV50/2017, TVV 45/2018, and TVV33-2019). In this study, all live imaging in vivo and glucose injections, as well as experimental procedures were performed with zebrafish larvae that did not exceed the 5 days post fertilization (dpf) stage, as stated in the animal protection law (TierSchVersV §14). According to the EU directive 2010/63/EU, the use of these earlier zebrafish stages reduces the number of experimental animals, according to the principles of the 3Rs.\n1. Preparation\nNOTE: This protocol pertains to the in vivo Ca2+ imaging of the zebrafish primary islet from Tg(ins:cdt1-mCherry;cryaa:CFP); Tg(ins:GCaMP6s;cryaa:mCherry) double transgenic larvae. In these animals, the insulin promoter drives the expression of cdt1-mCherry, which labels the nuclei of individual β-cell in red fluorescence. GCaMP6s shows changes in green fluorescence in response to the intracellular Ca2+ levels. The specific expression of the GCaMP6s in β-cells allows characterization of the glucose-responsiveness of individual cells without the interference from other cell types or tissues.\nPrepare E2 embryonic media15.\nPrepare 0.003% (200 µm) 1-pheniyl-2-thiourea (PTU) in 10% Hanks's saline15.\nPrepare 1% low-melting agarose (LMA) in E2 embryonic medium by heating in a microwave and filtering it with a <25 µm pore-size filter. Keep the LMA at >37 °C for up to 1 week.\n\tNOTE: All the solutions should be filtered to prevent clogging of the glass capillary used for injection.\nPrepare a 0.4% solution of tricaine methane sulfonate (MS222) with 979 mL of sterile H2O and 21 mL of 1 M Tris (pH 9). Adjust pH to 7.",
    "Dissolve 1.8 g of D-glucose in 50 mL of PBS to prepare 200 mM D-glucose solution and filter it with <25 µm pore-size filters. Prepare a working solution of D-Glucose (25 mM) by a 1:8 dilution of the 200 mM D-Glucose in 1x PBS (filtered). Keep at 4 °C for long-term storage. Add 5 µL of phenol-red to 1 mL of 25 mM D-Glucose to be able to visualize the solution upon injection.\n\tNOTE: This solution can be kept at 4 °C for 1 week. However, the 25 mM working solution should be prepared fresh. Discard the stock if there is any sign of contamination.\nPrepare pulled microinjection glass capillaries using a capillary puller or procure commercially available micro-glass capillaries. The settings for needle pulling, is described in the Table of Materials.\n\tNOTE: Microinjection capillaries made of borosilicate glass without internal filament were found to offer better results in comparison to similar capillaries with internal filament.\nProcure 35 mm diameter glass-bottom dishes for mounting the zebrafish larvae. Glass-bottom dishes with a glass cover of 0.17 mm were used in this protocol, as they allow imaging with glass-corrected objectives in confocal systems.\nProcure micro-loading pipet tips. 20 µL micro-loaders with 100 mm length were used in this protocol.\nProcure a set of micro-tweezers.\nProcure 90 mm Petri dishes for sorting and growing zebrafish.\nProcure mineral oil.\nProcure a pneumatic micro-pump or a system to deliver 1-5 nL of liquid volumes through the glass-capillaries.",
    "For zebrafish sorting and mounting, use a stereo microscope equipped with a light source and with blue and red filter cubes for fluorescence (CFP: excitation 420-450 nm, emission 460-490 nm, TRITC: excitation: 532-554 nm, emission: 570-613 nm; or Texas-Red: excitation: 540-580 nm, emission: 592-667 nm). Sort the double transgenic Tg(ins:cdt1-mCherry;cryaa:CFP); Tg(ins:GCaMP6s;cryaa:mCherry) larvae using the stereoscope. Select the embryos with blue and red fluorescence in the retina due to the expression of CFP and mCherry under the crystallin promoter.\nFor imaging the Ca2+ influx in β-cells, use an inverted confocal microscope equipped with a 10x (0.8 NA) air and a 40x (1.0 NA) water objectives. Use a stage containing the plate holder for the 35 mm diameter glass-bottom dishes.\nProcure a 3D manual or motorized manipulator with a capillary holder. Insert the glass capillary into the capillary holder and mount the capillary holder into the 3D manipulator.\n\t​NOTE: The 3D manipulator allows precise movement of the glass capillary and insertion into the zebrafish larvae.\n2. Zebrafish larvae mounting\nNOTE: The double transgenic Tg(ins:cdt1-mCherry;cryaa:CFP); Tg(ins:GCaMP6s;cryaa:mCherry) embryos are treated with 0.03% (20 µM) 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU) to inhibit pigmentation from 24 h post fertilization onward. At 4.5 dpf, anesthetize the larvae using 0.04% of the final concentration of Tricaine just before mounting.\nTo maintain anesthesia during the imaging session, add to the 1% low-melting agarose a final concentration of 0.04% Tricaine and 20 µM PTU. Keep the LMA agarose at >37 °C until usage. Use this solution on the same day of preparation.\nSort the anesthetized double transgenic Tg(ins:cdt1-mCherry;cryaa:CFP); Tg(ins:GCaMP6s; cryaa:mCherry) larvae. Place 3-5 fish on a glass-bottom Petri dish and remove most of the liquid.\n\tNOTE: Do not let the larvae dry at this step and always keep them immersed in a minimum amount of E2.",
    "Add 500 µL of LMA on the glass bottom Petri dish containing the fish, and with the help of the micro-tweezers gently move the fish so that the right side of the fish is directly in contact with the glass-bottom. Remove the excess agarose and let it solidify for 1-3 min. Observe that the agarose becomes slightly opaque at this point (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: If the agarose is too hot, it could damage the larvae. To avoid this, let the agarose to cool down at room temperature for 30-45 s before adding it to the larvae.\nOnce the agarose becomes solid, with the help of the micro-tweezers, carefully remove the agarose around the area of the heart to prevent the breakage of the needle used for subsequent injection upon contact with the agarose (Figure 1C).\nAdd 500 µL of E2 containing a final concentration of 0.04% Tricaine and 20 µM PTU.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to avoid drying of the larvae during the live imaging.\n3. Simultaneous injection and Ca2+ imaging of β-cells\nNOTE: Those larvae that have excessive yolk on top of the pancreas due to a developmental delay should not be used for imaging as the lipids of the yolk interfere with the image quality. In addition, low laser powers are used (0.5%-5%) to avoid photobleaching and phototoxicity.\nUsing a stereo microscope and micro-tweezers, cut off the tip of the glass capillary.\n\tNOTE: Do not cut more than just the tip of the capillary, as the diameter of the capillary should be smaller than the inflow tract of the zebrafish heart.\nUsing the loading tips, fill the needle with the 25 mM D-Glucose solution.",
    "NOTE: The capillary must be uniformly filled, taking special care to avoid the formation of any air bubbles as they interfere with the delivery of appropriate injection volumes.\nMount the glass capillary into the capillary holder and connect it to the micro-pump. Maintain the micropump at an injection pressure between 500-1,000 hPa, compensation pressure = 0 hPa, and delivery time = 1 s.\nTo calibrate the injection volume, use a stereo microscope equipped with a graded eye-piece. Place a drop of mineral oil into a glass slide under the stereoscope. Adjust the zoom of the stereoscope to a power of 4 with a 1.5x objective. Insert to inject the glass capillary into the mineral oil.\n\tNOTE: 5 nL is equivalent to 5 units of the graduation showed in the eye-piece of the stereoscope. Increase or decrease the injection pressure of the micro-pump to adjust the drop volume.\nMount the capillary holder into the 3D manipulator.\n\tNOTE: The 3D manipulator should allow fine movement control in x, y, and z directions of the capillary holder.\nPlace the dish containing the mounted larvae carefully on the plate holder of the confocal microscope. Use a 10x, 0.8 NA air objective for locating the larvae using the bright field option.\nOrient the zebrafish with the heart side toward the direction where the capillary and the 3D manipulator are located. By observing the red fluorescence, make sure that the islet is at the center of the field of view.\n\tNOTE: From this point onwards, the stage should stay fixed (Figure 2).",
    "Using the 3D manipulator, move the glass capillary toward the heart of the larvae, penetrate the skin, and aim for the pericardial cavity. Carefully insert the capillary in the middle of the common cardinal vein (CCV) and the sinus venosus (SV), located around 100-200 µm from the heart atrium16, (Figure 1B and Figure 2C). The angle of the needle is approximately 20-30° in relation to surface of the plate. If the rim of the plate is too high, remove it to allow easier access for the capillary.\n\tNOTE: This is a critical step, as a very careful penetration is required; fast movements can perturb the heart or cause blood clothing in this area. If the blood flow is perturbed, a different sample should be used. Since the 3D manipulator keeps a fixed position, avoid movements of the stage in order not to interfere with the heart tissue.\nOnce the capillary is placed into the SV, change to a 40x, 1.2 NA water immersion objective. Using the red and green 488/561 dichromatic mirrors, find the nuclear mCherry signal in β-cells, and focus on the islet.\n\tNOTE: Individual nuclei should be clearly visible and low green fluorescence should be present (Figure 1D).\nSet up a simultaneous acquisition for GCaMP6s and mCherry fluorescence with the following parameters in the Smart Setup Menu: GFP (GCaMP6s), excitation: 488 nm, emission: 498-555 nm, false-color: green (Select GFP); mCherry, excitation: 561 nm (mCherry), emission: 570-640 nm, false-color: red (Select mCherry). Transmitted light, false-color: grays.\nAdjust the plane of imaging by adjusting the focal plane along the z-axis of the islet. Find a plane that contains the majority of β-cells.\nAdjust the gain of the nuclear mCherry signal for a uniform identification of each individual cell and covering around 70% of the color histogram.",
    "Adjust the gain of the GCaMP6s signal for covering at least 25% of the color histogram, as the GCaMP6s increases its brightness up to 4-fold.\nAdjust the gain of the transmitted light for a uniform signal of the sample covering around 70% of the color histogram.\n\tNOTE: The gray channel is used to visualize and ensure proper blood flow of the islet.\nIn the Acquisition Mode, set the image resolution to 512 x 512 pixels, zoom to 5, line step to 3, scan speed to 13, and averaging line to 2-3. Select the option Time-series, and set the Duration to 500 cycles, with acquisition rate of 150 ms per frame.\n\tNOTE: The first 50 frames of the time-series correspond to the baseline fluorescence before the glucose injection. It has been observed that some β-cells show basal activity in vivo. A responding β-cell will show an increase in green fluorescence intensity with the glucose injection over time. Most β-cells show a response to the 25 mM glucose injection in vivo.\nStart the imaging. After the first 50 frames (7.5 s), inject the glucose using the micro-pump.\n\tNOTE: The injections might produce a slight movement that can shift the focal plane of the islet. During the movie recording, gut-movements might change the focal plane of the islet.\nKeep an eye on the image acquisition and manually adjust the x, y, and z coordinates to keep the same focal plane along the movie.\nAfter the glucose injection, the system records the islet response in terms of Ca2+ influx as an increase in the GCaMP fluorescence. After each injection, let the larvae rest for at least 5 min before any further stimulation.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the nuclei of the cells remain stable during the process. If the islet is moving extensively during acquisition or if the islet had moved out of the focal plane, the sample cannot be used for further analysis.\nRepeat the injection three times. Save the videos as TIF, CZI, or LSM formats (recommended). After recording the Ca2+ responses, remove the capillary from the heart very slowly. Move to the next sample.\n\t​NOTE: The zebrafish larvae can be recovered into a Petri dish with fresh E2 containing PTU.\n4. Quantification of GCaMP fluorescence traces for individual β-cells\nNOTE: If the animal presents too much of movement, the movie can be stabilized using the FIJI plug-in Descriptor-based series registration (2d/3d + t)17.\nLoad the image to be analyzed by dragging and dropping into FIJI. In the window Bio-format Import Options, click on OK.\n\tNOTE: For formats not supported by FIJI, convert the videos into tiff format for analysis.\nTo extract the GCaMP fluorescent intensity, click on the menu Analyze > Set Measurements. Tick the box Integrated density and click on OK.\n\t\nOpen the ROI Manager.\nIn the FIJI menu, select Polygon selections located in the toolbar.\nManually draw a polygon covering an area slightly larger than the cell nucleus and including some of the cytoplasmic area of the cell to ensure proper single-cell quantification of the Ca2+ response.\nMake sure that the position of the ROI is consistent over the frames; if necessary, adjust the ROI.\nAdd the selected ROI to the ROI Manager by clicking on the Add [t] button.\nTo quantify the signal of the GCaMP, separate the channels of the image. Click on the FIJI menu Image > Colors > Split Channels and select Green Channel.",
    "In the ROI Manager, select all the areas and click on the menu More > Multi Measure. Save the results.\n\tNOTE: If the cell moves out of the polygon area due to the glucose injection or animal movement, extract the cell fluorescence before and after the movement by manually adjusting the polygon area.\nTo perform the single-cell analysis, execute the following steps.\n\t\nRemove the background florescence. For this purpose, consider the background fluoresce as the minimum value registered over the movie for each cell (FMIN). The minimum is subtracted from the entire time series (FT - FMIN) for each cell.\nNormalize the fluorescence values across the movie. To achieve this, divide each value by the highest intensity value over the recordings for each cell. For this purpose, calculate the difference between FMIN and FMAX, i.e., (FMAX - FMIN). Divide (FT - FMIN) / (FMAX - FMIN).\n\t\tNOTE: This step allows comparison of Ca2+ response among different cells and among islets from different animals, as they will emit varying levels of fluorescent intensities depending on the focal plane and the cell's or islet's accessibility to imaging.\nAfter acquisition of single-cell fluorescence values, use a program (e.g., Excel or R) to process the fluorescent values measured from step 4 and automatically plot the fluorescent traces. For performing the analysis in this protocol (step 6), the Supplemental Table 1 (Singlecelltrace.xlsx) was used.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
