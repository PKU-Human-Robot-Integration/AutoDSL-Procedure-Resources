    "Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the authors' hospital. Informed consent was obtained from each patient.\n1. Inclusion/exclusion criteria and preoperative preparation\nInclude patients with the following preoperative symptoms: unable to walk steadily, numbness of the lower limbs, atrophy of the lower limbs, leg weakness, uncontrolled movement of the lower extremities, or sphincter dysfunction, etc., as well as signs and imaging data consistent with thoracic myelopathy.\nExclude patients based on the following criteria: the presence of cervical spinal stenosis or lumbar spinal stenosis (confirmed by MRI), thoracic disk herniation or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (confirmed by CT), fracture, or an infection or tumor of the spine.\nPlace the patient in a prone position under general anesthesia.\nConduct neurophysiological monitoring involving somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) throughout the surgery.\nIdentify the TOLF levels with the C-arm before the operation.\n2. Incision and approach\nDisinfect the surgical area using povidone-iodine (PVP-I), and drape the area with sterile surgical towels.\nIdentify the involved levels of the TOLF preoperatively using the C-arm X-ray machine.\nMake a longitudinal midline incision over the spinous processes using a scalpel, extending from the spinous process above to the spinous process below the level of the TOLF.\n\tNOTE: One segment is about 10 cm long. The incision should extend from the spinous process above to the spinous process below the level of the TOLF.\nExpose the posterior bony structure, including the spinous processes, bilateral lamina, and zygapophyseal joints of the involved levels using a unipolar electrotome.\nDetermine the pedicle screw entry points (the intersection between the midlines of the facet joint and transverse process). Insert pedicle marker pins to mark the pedicle screw entry points, and use these as a reference for the lateral border of the thoracic spinal cord.",
    "Define a rectangular decompression zone as the area between the midpoint of the facet joints bilaterally and between the inferior portions of the superior lamina (beneath the caudal edge of the pedicle, which can be located by the pedicle marker pins) and the superior portions of the inferior lamina (above the cranial edge of the pedicle) of the involved TOLF segments (Figure 3).\n3. Decompression\nRemove the spinous processes, along with the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, using a bone rongeur from the cranial to the caudal end of the decompression zone. Usually, maintain a part of the spinous process to help in removing the lamina.\n\t\nIrrigate the incision with saline to identify bleeding sites, and block any bleeding sites with sterilized medical styptic gauge on the residual supraspinous.\nUse an ultrasonic osteotome to cut the lamina horizontally on the cranial and the caudal ends of the decompression zone and longitudinally between the midpoint of the facet joints bilaterally. Perform the cutting until the surgeon feels the lamina has been cut through (The cutting can be done multiple times).\nUse a conventional osteotome to lever the lamina upward and turn it from side to side. A cracking sound of the bone indicates that the lamina has been completely cut off (Figure 4).\nAfter the lamina has been loosened, use one or two towel clamps to clamp the root of the spinous process, and elevate the entire lamina carefully. When there is adhesion between the ossified tissue and the dura mater, use a nerve dissector for disattachment.\nTrim the remaining articular process and the edge of the lamina on both sides with Kerrison rongeurs to ensure full decompression.\n4. Internal fixation",
    "After thorough hemostasis with bipolar electrocoagulation and styptic cream, cover the dural surface with a gelatin sponge, or fluid gelatin, and neurosurgical sponge (e.g., Cottonoid). Then, replace the pedicle marker pins with pedicle screws.\nConnect the screws with titanium rods, and tighten the screw nuts.\nMince the bone fragments from the vertebral lamina, and implant the fragments bilaterally between the transverse processes. Throughout the operation, achieve hemostasis using bipolar electrocoagulation and styptic cream.\n5. Postoperative treatment\nPerform Jackson-Pratt drainage routinely for 24-48 h in patients without dural tears14. Administer dehydration management and neurotrophic medications after the operation.\nAdminister intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg) for 3 days.\nInstruct the patients to perform rehabilitation exercises to help functional recovery.\nSubscription Required.
