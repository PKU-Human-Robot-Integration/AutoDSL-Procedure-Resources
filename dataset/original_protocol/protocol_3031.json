    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProbiotic administration in drinking water\nTiming: 4 weeks or more\nThese steps describe details of mouse caging, housing, and daily probiotic administration.\nConfirm viability of the strain of interest in drinking water.\nViability of bacteria in water can be established by determining the concentration of viable bacteria in drinking water immediately post-inoculation and at the end of desired treatment period.\nNote: As we previously demonstrated,17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] L. reuteri MM4-1A (ATCC-PTA-6475) is viable in pH-sterilized drinking water, losing approximately one order of magnitude in CFU/mL over a 24-h period.\nNote: See step 7 under “Anaerobic preparation and storage of Limosilactobacillus reuteri” for determining viability.\nNote: If the bacterial species of interest is not viable in water, alternative methods of strain delivery include oral gavage or use of an alternative delivery vehicle, such as sugar-free applesauce [as used by Hsiao et al. to deliver Bacteroides fragilis18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]]. Researchers should carefully consider their experimental design and tailor this protocol to fit their strain of interest and animal model.\nNote: The method used to sterilize drinking water is an environmental factor that may alter the results of an experiment. We have observed reproducible results across institutions using a maternal high-fat diet model for the effects of maternal overnutrition on offspring health outcomes when L. reuteri is suspended in drinking water sterilized by either reverse osmosis or acidification (pH 2.0).\nObtain 3-week-old weanling male and female mice of the desired genotype.\nCage subjects according to sex and experimental group.\nMaintain mice at the appropriate animal biosafety level (ABSL1 for L. reuteri) under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions and keep on a 12-h light/dark cycle in polysulfone cages with access to sterile food and treated water ad libitum.",
    "Critical: It is important to sample across multiple cages to rule out litter effects as the driver of community composition differences.\nAdd strain of interest to sterile water of experimental cages.\nThaw the required number of L. reuteri aliquots based on the number of cages for each treatment day.\nRefresh treated water daily 2 h prior to the start of the dark cycle to reduce variation in probiotic exposure.\nContinue treatment for at least four weeks before and throughout behavioral assessment until time of tissue collection.\nNote: In the paper associated with this protocol, we added 200 μL of L. reuteri at a stock concentration of 1011 CFU/mL to mouse water bottles containing 199.8 mL sterile drinking water.\nNote: Probiotic administration over a period of four weeks allows for stabilization of the gut microbial ecosystem in response to the probiotic administration prior to assessment of probiotic efficacy.\nCritical: L. reuteri-supplemented water must be replaced daily or maintained for no more than 48 h to ensure optimal bacterial concentration. The suggested replenishment schedule is based on previous studies reporting that human-derived probiotics – and L. reuteri specifically – are only transiently present in the small bowel and rapidly excreted.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] If readers wish to achieve colonization of their strain of interest, gut microbiome ablation using antibiotics or gnotobiotic mice should be considered.\nStool sample collection for analysis of microbiome community structure\nTiming: 1–3 Days\nDescribed here is the procedure for aseptic collection of fecal samples to characterize the fecal microbiota via 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing.\nCollect stool samples from 7–8-week-old mice (consider a minimum of 5 min per mouse).\nPre-label a sterile (autoclaved) 1.7 mL RNase- and DNase-free microcentrifuge tube for each subject.",
    "Open sterile packaging of sterile gloves and place in an empty autoclaved cage to cover the cage bottom.\nAllow mouse to defecate during handling with sterile gloves.\nCollect at least two fecal pellets per animal by collecting directly into the microcentrifuge tube or from the sterile glove packaging.\nClose the microcentrifuge tube securely and snap-freeze on dry ice immediately upon collection to maintain specimen integrity.\nCritical: Sterile conditions must be maintained throughout each step of stool sample collection to avoid contamination. Change sterile gloves and sterile glove packaging between animals. Avoid fecal pellet contact with urine which can confound results. In case of absent or insufficient collection from a subject, repeat the aseptic collection procedure on days 2 or 3 of handling as necessary if consistent with study design. Two to three pellets typically yield 100–200 mg.\nNote: We find that fecal pellet collection takes less time (roughly 5 min per mouse) on the first day of handling compared to subsequent days as the animals acclimate to being handled.\nNote: Within a given study, it is recommended that samples be collected around the same of day, as circadian rhythms are known to impact microbiome composition.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]\nNote: In Di Gesù, Matz et al. Cell Rep (2022),1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we collected murine fecal samples at a single timepoint prior to behavioral assessment. However, longitudinal assessment may also be considered.\nNote: Given that the distribution of microbial species differs along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] endpoint collection of GI contents from specific segments may be considered if readers wish to interrogate regional differences in microbiome composition and community structure upon probiotic treatment.",
    "Pause point: Samples can be stored at -80°C until ready to process for metataxonomic sequencing. If shipping to an offsite collaborator or service provider for sequencing, ship fecal samples with sufficient dry ice to ensure that the samples stay frozen in transit.\nAnalysis of metataxonomic sequencing data\nTiming: 1 week or more, depending on level of expertise\nVariable regions within the 16S ribosomal RNA gene are used to assign phylogenetic affiliation to prokaryotic organisms. What follows is a description of the statistical methods used to analyze the 16S rRNA gene amplicon (metataxonomic) sequencing dataset once DNA extraction, 16S amplicon library generation, library sequencing, and data pre-processing for quality control, demultiplexing, and trimming are complete (see22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). This protocol enables the investigation of both composition (within-sample, or alpha-, diversity) and community structure (between-sample, or beta-, diversity) of the bacterial component of the microbiome in discrete experimental groups. Additional guidance is provided to assess differentially abundant bacterial taxa (e.g., at the genus level).\nCritical: When probiotic treatment is administered to both male and female mouse cohorts, we strongly recommend performing the data analysis described in this section by sex given our recent findings of a sexually-dimorphic effect of probiotic supplementation on host microbiota configurations.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]",
    "Note: In this protocol, bacterial DNA extraction and metataxonomic sequencing was performed by the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at Baylor College of Medicine to ensure high quality standards for sample processing. Protocols used were adapted from those established for the NIH-Human Microbiome Project.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] Protocol details can be found in Di Gesù, Matz et al. Cell Rep (2022).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] A custom script was used to construct a rarefied OTU or ASV table from the output files generated in the sequencing pipeline, and downstream analysis of alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and phylogenetic trends was performed using the Agile Toolkit for Incisive Microbial Analyses (ATIMA2) web platform (https://atima.research.bcm.edu[href=https://atima.research.bcm.edu/]). Visit the Tutorials tab in ATIMA for an instructions guide.\nAlternatives: An alternative web-based platform, such as Microbiome analyst24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24] (https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca[href=https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/]) can be used to perform statistical analysis and visualization of common datasets from microbiome studies.\nIn ATIMA or an alternative microbiome analysis platform, upload sequencing dataset.\nIn ATIMA, upload sequencing dataset as a .biom file.\nIn ATIMA, select Option >> Rarefaction to visualize rarefaction curves and, if needed, adjust rarefaction depth.\nAnalyze alpha-diversity metrics: Observed OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units), Chao1 index, Shannon index, and Inverse Simpson index.25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]\nIn ATIMA under the Options >> Export tab, export the rarified alpha-diversity values for each mouse/sample and import them into a statistical analysis program such as GraphPad’s Prism (https://www.graphpad.com/[href=https://www.graphpad.com/]):\nCreate a column-formatted data table.\nRemove outliers using Grubbs’ test with alpha = 0.05.\nFor comparison of two experimental groups, analyze data with the appropriate t test or nonparametric test as determined by normality tests.\nFor comparisons between three or more groups, use a one-way ANOVA or nonparametric test.\nTo examine cage and/or litter effects, alpha-diversity can be analyzed using a nested analysis while still visualized as column data:",
    "Create a nested data table where each sub-column contains values for one cage and/or litter, grouped by treatment.\nAnalyze data using a nested t-test to compare two groups or a nested one-way ANOVA to compare three or more groups. In addition to the p-value assigned to the test, a chi-square test is performed to determine if sub-columns (litters) differ significantly within each column (treatment group), indicating the presence of litter effects.\nGraph results as columns with individual values and plot mean with SEM or SD.\nUse different symbols to distinguish sex (i.e., triangles for females, circles for males) or sexes combined (i.e., diamonds)and different colors to indicate treatment, generations, etc.\nAlways include error bars and p-values or asterisks (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2779-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Rarefaction curves of alpha-diversity indices and plot of retained samples and reads\nExamples of rarefaction curves of (A) observed OTUs and (B) Shannon index, and plots of (C) samples retained from total number of samples for a given rarefaction depth and (D) reads retained from total number of sequencing reads for a given rarefaction depth. Example curves and plots obtained from the ATIMA2 web platform (https://atima.research.bcm.edu[href=https://atima.research.bcm.edu/]).\nNote: See Love et al., STAR Protocols (2022) for an excellent step-by-step protocol for microbial DNA isolation, metataxonomic sequencing, and data pre-processing.22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]",
    "Note: The total number of sequence reads defines the library size for each sample. Given that library size is not uniform across samples, even within the same sequencing run, normalization approaches are required to compare taxa diversity, distribution, and phylogenetic relationships between different samples to obtain biologically meaningful information. In the publication associated with this protocol, we used rarefaction as the normalization tool which randomly subsamples reads from the library to a defined sequencing depth, thus defining a standardized library size across all the samples. Limitations of subsampling include exclusion of a random amount of the observed sequences which may impact diversity analysis.26[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26] The process of choosing a read depth is based on the rarefaction curve (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Determining whether a defined sequencing depth is adequate to capture a sufficient proportion of the diversity in the samples without omitting samples with low library size is often specific to the dataset on hand. We recommend verifying that the rarefaction curve of a certain alpha-diversity metric plateaus at the library size selected, indicating sufficient saturation of the dataset.\nNote: In the publication associated with this protocol, the UPARSE algorithm27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27] was used to cluster 16S rRNA gene sequences into OTUs based on a similarity cutoff value of 97%. This approach minimizes the effect of sequencing errors in downstream diversity calculations.28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] Alternatively, non-cluster based approaches can be applied to amplicon sequence variants (ASV) reconstructed through “denoising” pipelines, such as Deblur.29[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29] For in an in-depth review of sequence error-correction approaches, see Nearing et al.30[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30] (2018).\nNote: Distinct alpha-diversity metrics are relevant to specific properties of gut microbiome composition and highlight different aspects of the intrasample variation, such as richness (number of taxa), evenness (distribution of taxa abundances), or both.31[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31] We recommend using and reporting multiple alpha-diversity metrics in microbiome studies.",
    "Note: Simpson’s index includes values ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 representing the highest (infinite) diversity and 1 representing a complete absence of diversity. Therefore, Simpson’s index negatively correlates with species diversity. For this reason, Simpson’s index is often reported as its inverse (1/D), the ‘Inverse Simpson index.’\nNote: For more detailed information on statistical analyses in Prism 9 (including nested analyses), refer to the GraphPad Prism statistics guide.32[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32] Alternative software packages for graphing and data analysis, such as SYSTAT’s SigmaPlot (https://systatsoftware.com/sigmaplot/[href=https://systatsoftware.com/sigmaplot/]), can be used.\nNote: Outliers identified by Grubbs’ test for a specific alpha- or beta-diversity metric must be excluded from all other metrics.\nNote: For each alpha-diversity metric, choose left Y-axis range between 0 and n based on the highest value in the entire dataset.\nNote: We do not recommend combining datasets from samples processed in separate sequencing runs, given interexperimental variability.\nPerform ordination analysis for beta-diversity to calculate and visualize the statistically significant changes in the murine gut microbiome community between two or more experimental groups.\nIn ATIMA or other microbiome analysis platform, measure phylogenetic distances between sets of taxa via the UniFrac method, both weighted and unweighted.33[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]\nIn ATIMA, select the Options >> Metadata tab to add the metadata to identify individual samples and experimental groups.\nSelect the Beta Diversity >> Ordination tab to visualize calculated UniFrac distances by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), which identifies the variance explained by each principal coordinate. Select UniFrac as distance metric and PCoA as ordination method.\nUse the Color by, Shape by, Facet by, and Limit by functions to visualize individual data points representing discrete samples according to group affiliation.\nIdentify the 95% confidence interval of those groups using the ellipse function. Display centroids to show the centers of the sample clusters.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2779-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Galaxy LEfSe tab-delimited input file with hierarchical structure\nExample input file containing defined class, subclass, and subject vectors are identified by a name (maternaldiet, sex, and id, respectively) and a series of non-numerical strings (MHFD/MRD, male/female, and 1–10, respectively). Features with hierarchy are listed in rows.\nNote: ATIMA2 will apply permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) for statistical analysis of the datasets.\nNote: Unweighted UniFrac distance is binary, considering only the presence or absence of OTUs or ASVs (proxies for taxa), while weighted UniFrac distance is calculated by considering species abundance, weighing the phylogenetic branch length with differential abundance. The first method is useful in detecting changes of low abundance taxa, while weighted UniFrac has a higher sensitivity in detecting changes in abundant taxa. Both UniFrac approaches should be used to investigate differences in microbiome community structures.\nNote: In ATIMA2, it is possible to choose alternative distance metrics including Jaccard, Bray-Curtis, Manhattan, or Euclidean.\nNote: Other non-phylogenetic-based metrics are commonly used in beta-diversity analysis of community structures. Among these are the OTU-based metrics Jaccard and Bray-Curtis, which consider each OTU as a separate entity without taking taxonomy and phylogenetic relationship into account. Unlike UniFrac, these methods assume that all members of the microbial community are equivalently related to each other. However, it must be considered that UniFrac is more sensitive to low abundance and phylogenetically distant OTUs.34[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]",
    "Note: In addition to Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is one of the most frequently used ordination methods to visually explore dissimilarity matrices based on beta-diversity metrics. However, in PCoA, the ordination obtained matches the actual distance between samples, instead of its rank order. Both PCoA and NMDS ordination methods can be used to obtain 2D and 3D plots of the dataset. The main difference between 2D PCoA and 3D PCoA is the number of dimensions (i.e., axes) used for plotting. If the first two axes explain most of the variation, third or n+1 dimensions are not necessary.\nNote: PERMANOVA tests if the centroids, or means, of each group are significantly different from each other. Additionally, a R2 statistic is calculated, showing the percentage of the variance explained by the groups.\nApply Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) to identify differentially abundant bacterial taxa using a program like Galaxy 2.0 (http://galaxy.biobakery.org[href=http://galaxy.biobakery.org/]).35[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]\nObtain from ATIMA rarefied abundance matrices with taxonomic classifications at the genus level under the Options >> Export tab.\nPrepare a tab-delimited input file consisting of a list of numerical features, the class vector, and optionally the subclass and subject vectors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nUpload the input file using Galaxy’s \"Get-Data/Upload-file” function.\nUse the “Format Data for LEfSe” function to select if the features (classes and subclasses) and metadata information (subjects) are listed in columns or rows.\nNote: The “Format Data for LEfSe” function offers the option to normalize the sum of the values to 1M, which is recommended when very low values are present. If the samples are already normalized and do not represent absolute OTU counts, selecting this option will multiply the values by 1M.\nUse the “LDA Effect Size (LEfSe)” function to perform the analysis using the data formatted in the previous step.",
    "Note: Distribution-free (non-parametric) factorial Kruskal-Wallis (KW) sum-rank test is used to identify features (or taxa) with statistically different abundance among classes. If subclasses were indicated, the (unpaired) Wilcoxon rank-sum test is run to test if differentially abundant features identified among classes are also consistent with biologically significant categories (subclasses). In the absence of subclasses, LEfSe performs both KW and Wilcoxon between classes. Alpha values must be selected for both the KW and the Wilcoxon tests. Features passing the Wilcoxon test are identified as biomarkers. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is performed based on the specific subset of vectors (biomarkers/taxa) obtained, in which features are ranked based on the relative differences among the classes. The LDA model provides an estimate of the feature's effect size reported as an LDA score. The threshold on the logarithmic LDA score for biomarkers is set to 2.0 by default but can be increased to be more stringent.\nNote: A different strategy is required when more than two classes are used. In this case, the user must set the strategy for multi-class analysis. Two options are offered: the all-against-all and the one-against-all strategies. For the first, which is more stringent, all the n abundance profiles of a certain feature must be statistically significant among all the classes. The second requires that at least one class is statistically different from the others for that specific feature.\nData can be visualized with the “Plot LEfSe Results” function, where text, labels, and graphical options can be customized.",
    "Note: The “Plot LEfSe Results” function will provide a column bar graph in which significant features identified by LEfSe are ranked based on their LDA score and color-matched with the class with the highest median for each specific feature. Alternatively, from the “LDA Effect Size (LEfSe)” function, data can be downloaded as tab-delimited file and imported into Prism. Statistically significant features, i.e., taxa, can be represented in a column bar graph.\nUse the “Plot Cladogram” function to obtain a cladogram showing the taxa identified by the “LDA Effect Size (LEfSe)” function with taxonomic levels from phylum to genus represented by rings. Text, labels, and graphical options can be customized.\nNote: To obtain the cladogram, the original input file must include the taxonomic description (denoted with \"|\" in the input file, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: LEfSe analysis steps described here can be easily adapted for rarefied abundance matrices where OTUs are used as the taxonomic level."
