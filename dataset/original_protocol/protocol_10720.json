    "1. Adapting hESCs or iPSCs in TrypLE for Spin EB Cultures\nThe initial dissociation with TrypLE works best if the ES/iPS colonies from the collagenase-passaged cultures are relatively small. The starting ES/iPS populations should be cells passed no longer than 4-5 days previous. 4-5 days before initiation of TrypLE passage, pass ES cells at a density that will allow the cells to be ~70% confluent in 4 days time. Use regular ES media for culture of TrypLE-passaged ES cells. Here, we are using hESCs stably modified with a luciferase reporter construct (Materials Table). The protocol also works with iPSCs, using unmodified iPSCs for comparison of hematopoietic progenitor cell and NK cell development.\nFour days before initiation of TrypLE passage, pass ES/iPS cells with collagenase IV, following a normal passage protocol. We typically pass 1:1 in the first passage with TrypLE. Expand ES/iPS cells accordingly beforehand.\nOne day prior to initiation of TrypLE passage, plate MEFs in 6-well plates at 0.9-1 x 105 cells/well. Pass 1:1 (or 2:1 for hard-to-adapt cell lines or for less dense cultures) in the first passage with TrypLE. Therefore, prepare 1 MEF plate for every ES/iPS plate you plan on putting into TrypLE culture.\nCarefully pick off differentiated colonies (those which lack a circumscribed border or have fibroblastic/epithelial characteristics) before proceeding to TrypLE dissociation. Differentiated cells can take over the culture relatively easily with TrypLE passage, so it is important to make sure your starting population is very clean.\nAspirate media from wells and add 1.0 ml pre-warmed TrypLE Select per well.\nIncubate ES/iPS cells in TrypLE for 5 min in a 37 °C incubator. After 5 min, gently pipette ES cells off the bottom of the well.",
    "Collect the TrypLE cell suspension from wells and transfer to a conical tube. Pipette up and down gently 2-3 times to encourage the largest clumps to break apart. Dilute TrypLE with at least 1 equal volume ES media and 1 equal volume DPBS. TrypLE is not quenched by culture media, so it is important to dilute the TrypLE with media and DPBS after removing cells from the plate. We use DPBS + media for washes to save ES media.\nSpin down cells at 1,500 rpm for 5 min in refrigerated centrifuge (8 °C).\nAspirate off as much of the supernatant as possible to remove TrypLE.\nResuspend cells in 4 ml ES media plus 4 ml DPBS and repeat spin to get rid of remaining traces of TrypLE.\nAspirate off supernatant and resuspend in appropriate volume ES media for plating.\nPlate ES cells 1:1 (or 2:1 if need be) onto low-density MEFs in ES media.\nAfter 24 hr, feed cells with fresh ES media. There will most likely be many single cells that did not attach. Feed ES cells daily with ES media.\nPass with TrypLE onto fresh MEFs (0.9-1 x 105 cells/well) every 3-4 days (e.g. Tuesday and Friday) using the same basic procedure as above. Normally, you should not have to pick cells passed with TrypLE.",
    "For the first several passages (up to passage 5-10), the cells will require passing at 1:1. This makes expansion of cells difficult. In our experience, plating efficiency of the ES cells drops dramatically around passages 4-5 and then comes back up within a couple of passages. After passages 5-7, you may be able to begin passing the cells at 1:2, and eventually, 1:3. Beyond passage 20, you may need to start passing the cells at 1:5 or 1:6. Make sure to plate the ES cells at a high density the first 5-10 passages. Once you get to a point where the cells plate down efficiently enough that they can reach ~70% confluence within two days after passage, you can try to start passing at 1:2, and eventually should be able to pass at 1:3 or 1:4. iPSCs, in particular, if not passaged densely enough before fully adapted, tend to differentiate.\n2. Prepare Stock Solutions for Setting Up Spin EB Cultures\n10% BSA solution in IMDM: Suspend 4 g of BSA in 35 ml IMDM (in a 50 ml conical). Allow solution to sit at room temperature for 1-2 hr to allow BSA to fully dissolve. Adjust total volume to 40 ml with IMDM to get final concentration of 10%. Commercially available BSA can be cytotoxic to ES cells. Deionizing the solution can reduce the potential for cytotoxicity. To deionize, add ~1.3 g resin beads to 40 ml of BSA solution and shake well to mix.\nPlace BSA solution (with resin beads) at 4 °C until beads change color from blue-green to yellow (indicating that the exchange capacity has been exhausted).\nShake solution every 20-30 min to facilitate exchange",
    "Each exchange may take up to 2 hr. When exchange is complete, centrifuge solution for 2 min at 1,000 rpm to pellet beads at bottom of tube.\nPipette BSA solution into a fresh 50 ml conical, leaving beads to be discarded.\nRepeat steps 2.2-2.5 at least two additional times for a total of three or more exchanges. During the last exchange, the capacity of the beads may not fully be exhausted even after two hour incubation with the beads.\nSterile filter the BSA solution and remove any remaining beads.\nThe BSA solution should be stable at 4 °C for at least 2 months.\n5% PVA solution: Measure 100 ml Millipore H2O into 125 ml glass bottle.\nAdd 5 g PVA to the water. It is important to add the PVA to the water so that the PVA gets fully \"wet.\" If you add the water to the PVA, it will take a very long time for the PVA to go into solution.\nPVA will NOT dissolve immediately. Place PVA/water solution at 4 °C overnight.\nNext morning, place PVA/water solution in 37 °C waterbath for 4-8 hr. PVA should be mostly in solution by the end of the incubation.\nPlace bottle back in 4 °C for an additional 24-48 hr, or until fully dissolved. Solution might be slightly viscous.\nPVA solutions should be stable at 4 °C for at least 6 weeks.\nLinoleic and Linolenic Acids (10,000X solutions): Dilute to 1 mg/ml in 200-proof ethanol. Add 10 ml pure oil to 10 ml ethanol. Aliquot and store at -20 °C.\nα-MTG stock solution: Dilute 13 μl α-MTG in 1 ml IMDM.\nAscorbic Acid 2-Phosphate solution (100X): Make a 5 mg/ml solution. 250 mg ascorbic acid 2-phosphate in 50 ml sterile, tissue-culture grade H2O. Dissolves readily.",
    "3. Assembly of BPEL Media (for ~200 ml Total Volume)\nMake a PVA-lipids mixture (this step prevents the PVA from forming insoluble droplets in the medium that would get filtered out).\nAdd 20 ml IMDM and 20 ml F-12 nutrient mixture to 50 ml conical tube.\nAdd 10 ml of 5% PVA stock, 0.4 ml synthechol, 20 μl linolenic acid, and 20 μl linoleic acid for 200 ml BPEL media. Shake tube well to mix. Set aside while other media components are assembled.\nAdd all remaining media components to top of 250 ml Stericup filtration unit. Add the balance of required IMDM and F-12 volumes (66 ml each), BSA, a-MTG, 100X ITS, Glutamax I, Pen/Strep, Protein-free hybridoma mixture II, and ascorbic acid. Add the PVA-lipids mixture from step 1 to the top of the Stericup. Filter the medium. Medium should be stable at 4 °C for at least 2 weeks. Use old medium for wash steps.\n4. Setting up TrypLE-passaged ES Cells into Stage I Spin EBs\nUse ES/iPS cells that have been adapted to TrypLE passage on lower-density MEFs(i.e. ES/iPS cells that have been passaged with TrypLE at least 5-7 times). If cells can be passed at ~1:3 and become 70-80% confluent in 3-4 days, the cells should be good to use.\nTwo days before setting up Spin EB differentiation (day -2): Pass TrypLE-adapted ES/iPS cells onto fresh MEFs at a density allowing them to be 70-80% confluent on the day of differentiation setup. We typically pass 48 hr prior to Spin EB setup.\nDay of Spin EB Setup into Stage I Differentiation (day 0): To prepare for Spin EB plating, pipette 150 μl sterile water into the 36 outer wells of each 96-well plate to minimize evaporation. Use round-bottom, low attachment 96 well plates only.",
    "Aspirate culture media off of ES/iPS cells and add 1.0 ml pre-warmed TrypLE Select to each well.\nPlace plates in incubator (37 °C) for 5 min. Gently pipette cells off of the plate.\nCollect dissociated cells in a conical tube and pipette up and down to break apart clumps. Dilute TrypLE with 1 equal volume BPEL media and at least 1 equal volume DPBS.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5 ml BPEL media plus 5 ml DPBS. Repeat spin.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cells in 5-10 ml BPEL media, depending on anticipated cell number. Pass cells through 70 μm filter (BD Falcon #352350) into a fresh 50 ml conical in order to remove clumps (which can interfere with EB formation).\nCount filtered cells. Aliquot cells to be used for plating into a 50 ml conical and spin. For plating: 3,000 ES cells/well, 60 wells/plate = 1.8x105 ES cells/plate.\nAfter centrifugation, cells will need to be resuspended to 3x104 cells/ml (100 μl volume/well, 3,000 ES cells/well).\nPrepare a volume of BPEL media + cytokines sufficient for resuspending the cells (this will be 6 ml/plate). For stage I differentiation, we use SCF (40 ng/ml), BMP4 (20 ng/ml), and VEGF (20 ng/ml) for derivation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.\nPlate 100 μl cells/well (=3,000 cells/well) into each of the inner 60 wells of the prepared 96-well plates. This is easiest when using a multichannel pipettor and sterile trough. Be sure to mix cells by pipetting before putting in trough and work quickly so that cells do not have a chance to settle out.\nSpin the 96-well plates in refrigerated centrifuge for 4 min at ~1,500 rpm, 8 °C.",
    "Carefully transfer plates from centrifuge to 37 °C incubator. Avoid disrupting the plates as much as possible. Check plates to make sure that the cells formed uniform pellets in the bottom of the wells.\nStage I spin EBs should not be fed or otherwise disturbed through days 3-4 differentiation until the EBs have formed a more durable outer layer. If EBs will be left in stage I beyond 10-12 days, we sometimes feed EBs with 50 μl fresh BPEL media with cytokines to each well (first take out 50 μl of old media from each well). Within 24 hr, the cells should start to form a 3-D EB structure, and by day 3-5 should have a distinct outer layer, and start developing cystic structures.\n5. Dissociating Stage I EBs for FACS Analysis\nCollect around18-36 spin EB for FACS analysis. If analyzing cells before day 6, more wells are needed to obtain sufficient cell numbers.\nPrepare necessary volume of trypsin with 2% chicken serum. Place in 37 °C waterbath until use.\nTransfer spin EBs and media from 96-well plates to 15 ml conical tubes.\nAllow EBs to settle to bottom of conical tubes. With a 5 ml pipette, carefully pipette out the supernatant and transfer to a separate tube (you can pool all of the supernatant into one 15 ml or 50 ml conical tube). As some hematopoietic cells have already been released from the spin EB between days 9 and 11, separating the supernatant containing these cells prevents excessive trypsinization.",
    "Resuspend EBs in trypsin + 2% chicken serum: 3-4 ml to each 15 ml conical tube. Place EBs with trypsin in 37 °C waterbath for 3-7 min. Shake or gently vortex every 1-2 min. At earlier timepoints (before day 8), EBs will break apart more readily and can take as little as 3 min. At later timepoints (day 8+) the EBs may take longer to dissociate. We usually don't let them trypsinize for more than 5 min at 37 °C. Note, these times are a guide only. For any particular cell line or EB differentiation, it may take more or less time to dissociate the EBs. Closely monitor the dissociation. It is important not to leave cells in trypsin for too long. It is better to stop the trypsin dissociation when only a few small clumps remain visible rather than try to eliminate all clumps.\nQuench trypsin with at least 1 equal volume of FBS-containing media. Spin down cells (1,500 rpm, 5 min, 8 °C).\nResuspend cells in an appropriate volume of media for counting (usually 3-5 ml).\nFilter cells through a 100 μm cell strainer. Remove an aliquot of cells for counting. Proceed with cells to standard lab FACS protocols.\n6. Development, Expansion, and Characterization of NK Cells from hPSC-derived Progenitor Cells",
    "Because the spin EBs contain a high percentage of hematopoietic progenitor cells, they can be directly transferred to NK cell culture on day 11. The spin EBs may be transferred to 24 well plates with or without feeders. We have shown no difference in phenotype or function between NK cells derived in each condition. Therefore, we generally transfer to cultures without feeders to have a completely defined system for NK cell development. If using an hESC/iPSC line with suboptimal hematopoietic differentiation the use of feeder layers is recommended 7,8.\nUsing a multichannel pipette set to 100 μl, transfer 6 spin EBs to each well of a 24 well plate.\nWith Feeders: transfer spin EBs to 24-well plates containing 100,000 irradiated (3,000 cGY) EL08-1D2 (a murine embryonic liver cell line) cells per well. Without feeders: transfer EBs directly to uncoated, 24 well plates.\nAdd 400 μl NK differentiation media containing cytokines (IL-3, IL-15, IL-7, SCF, Flt3L, all from Peprotech) so the total volume in each well is ~1 ml.\nPlace cells in incubator and feed every 5-7 days with NK differentiation media containing all cytokines in step 6.3 except IL-3.\nNK cells will express a mature phenotype at day 28 following transfer to NK cell differentiation culture (Figure 2).\nTo test NK cell cytotoxicity, a 4 hr chromium release assay can be performed 8.\nIf large numbers of cells are needed for in vivo studies, co-culture with artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) can yield a 2-log or greater expansion.

In vivo Fluorescent and Bioluminescent Imaging to Monitor hESC-derived NK Cells and Tumor Cells in Immunodeficient Mice",
    "We use nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency with gamma-chain knockout (NOD/SCID/ γC-/-) mice that are 6 to 8 weeks old in all of our experiments. We use a dual imaging model to simultaneously track tumor progression (turboFP650 reporter) and hESC-NK cells kinetics (Fluc reporter expressed in parent ES cells) in vivo. This imaging scheme is broadly applicable to systems other than the anti-tumor model shown here. The IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences) is optimal for simultaneous fluorescent and bioluminescent in vivo imaging.\n24 hr prior to tumor cell injection, irradiate mice (225-250 cGY).\nResuspend desired number of tumor cells (1 x 106 K562 cells are shown) in 200 μl Iscove modified Dulbecco medium (IMDM) supplemented with 20% FBS. Tumor cell dose can be varied depending on the model used. TurboFP650 could also be expressed in non-tumor types. It is best imaged with cells localized to a single anatomic location.\nInject tumor cells subcutaneously into the upper left thorax of the mice using a 27 or 28 gauge needle and allow to engraft for 4 days. Cells should form a bubble under the skin of the mouse. Mice can be shaved in this portion of the body to better visualize injection. It also exposes the area for better in vivo fluorescent imaging. Injection around the thorax of the mice was used in this model because the ip injected NK cells are best visualized while the mouse is supine. Alternative methods of subcutaneous delivery, including the back or flank, are less stressful to the animal and should be considered.\nResuspend the desired number of hESC-derived NK cells (10 x 106 NK cells are shown) in 300 μl Iscove modified Dulbecco medium (IMDM) supplemented with 20% FBS without antibiotics.",
    "Inject hESC-derived NK cells into each mouse intraperitoneally (IP) using a 27 or 28 gauge needle. For all experiments, include mice receiving no tumor or NK cell infusion as a negative control.\nTo sustain NK cell populations in vivo, give mice a 250 μl IP injection of IL-2 (1x104 U/mouse) and IL-15 (10 ng/mouse) in sterile DPBS every day for the first 7 days followed by IL-2 only every 2 to 3 days until the time of sacrifice.\nMonitor engraftment of hESC-derived NK cells by bioluminescent imaging. Inject each mouse IP with 120 μl D-luciferin (150 mg/kg). Image the mice 10 min after D-luciferin injection.\nAnesthetize mice using a chamber allowing isoflurane entry into the box at 0.8 l/min. Make sure there is also oxygen flow into the chamber.\nPlace anesthetized mice in IVIS Spectrum and secure mice on their backs using tape or Velcro and allow isoflurane entry into the box at 0.5 l/min to maintain anesthesia.\nSet IVIS machine to correct imaging platform (D for 4-5 mice, C for 3 or fewer mice), set binning to medium, f/stop to 1 and acquire image for 1 min.\nTo perform fluorescent imaging for turboFP650+ cells, use the imaging wizard to set up an emission scan measuring the probe of interest as well as background signal. From the list of probes choose Input Em/Ex, and enter in correct excitation and emission. For turboFP650, use 605 excitation and 660-720 emission to measure tumor signal and 570 excitation and 640-720 emission to measure background signal. Use auto exposure settings and select the desired imaging platform. The entire imaging sequence will generally take 3-5 min to acquire.\nAllow mice to fully recover from anesthesia before transporting from the imaging system. Analyze images using the Living Image software package version 4.2 (Caliper Life Sciences).",
    "Quantify bioluminescent signal using a region of interest (ROI) set to total flux (photons/sec) or average radiance (photons/sec/cm2/sr) and set all images to the same scale (Figure 3). Here, representative images are used to demonstrate both cell populations in each mouse (Figure 3). Other studies from our lab have demonstrated colocalization using this technique20. Colocalization timing will need to be optimized based on the experimental model used.\nTo quantify fluorescent signal from the emission scan sequence use the \"Spectral Unmixing\" feature in Living Image. Select the images to include in the analysis and draw a mask over the area of the mouse containing the signal of interest, in this case, the upper thorax. Select tissue autofluorescense and unknown probe to be unmixed. If mice are given food containing alfalfa, food signal can also be unmixed from the probe of interest and tissue autofluorescence.\nIf the resulting images do not show an even distribution of tissue autofluorescence (including the area where the signal is located) constraints can be set to get consistent distribution and better separation of the components being unmixed. This is typical and often necessary for probes that are not in the software and when specific signal is low, or close to background signal. Set a high pass filter, found under the update tab, for 640 nm, which corresponds to the lower end of the emission curve for turboFP650. A low pass filter constraint can also be set, but it was unnecessary for the imaging analysis shown here.\nQuantify fluorescent signal from the unmixed image using a region of interest (ROI) set to radiant efficiency (photons/sec/cm2/sr)/μW) and set all images to the same scale (Figure 3).",
    "At a desired time point, mice can be sacrificed and analyzed for engraftment of hESC-derived cells by flow cytometry. For intraperitoneally injected NK cells we typically analyze the peripheral blood (facial vein bleed), spleen, and peritoneum. Peritoneal washes can be performed by exposing just the peritoneal membrane and making a medial incision just wide enough to allow a glass Pasteur pipette to access the peritoneal cavity. Using sterile PBS, perform several washes of the peritoneal cavity making sure to mix solution thoroughly by rotating the mouse. Collect enough fluid until you have a visible pellet following centrifugation (typically 5-10 ml of wash).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
