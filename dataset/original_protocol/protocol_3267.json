Seven exposure periods have been previously used and are included in the outline provided; however, the duration of the exposure periods and number of exposure periods can be modified if needed. The cell concentration of each culture is standardized to ensure consistent exposure to UV radiation. Once the survival curve is established, aliquots can be made as needed for UV exposure at a chosen exposure period.\nChoose a pre-cultured 250 mL flask with physiologically consistent cells and minimum concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL.\nTransfer cells to 50 mL centrifuge tubes for each planned time exposure.\nObtain cell concentration of axenic cell cultures in log phase.\nCalculate volume of culture required to transfer a total of 2 × 107 cells.\nTransfer calculated volume of cell culture to 50 mL tubes for each time point.\nAdjust concentration of aliquoted solution to 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nCentrifuge transferred cells and remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in a final volume 20 mL of fresh MB media.\nSet aside tubes for UV exposure.\nUV exposure\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Each cell aliquot prepared in the previous step will be exposed to germicidal UV light for one of the following periods of time: 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 s. The time periods of UV exposure given here have been chosen because of their previous success with Breviolum minutum. This procedure should be performed inside a biological safety cabinet or flow hood. Glass materials, such as serological pipettes and Petri dishes, should also be sterilized prior to use and have been chosen for use to ensure the efficient retrieval of mutagenized cells after UV exposure.\nPrepare a sterile environment for UV exposure as demonstrated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3037-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. UV exposure environment\n(A) Breviolum minutum culture before UV exposure.\n(B) Breviolum minutum culture during UV exposure. Red line indicates the 25 cm distance from the bulb to the culture.\nPlace the stir plate 25 cm from the UV bulb within the biological safety cabinet. A stand may be required to achieve this distance. Disinfect each item with 70% ethanol.\nPlace glass Petri dishes and serological pipettes into the biosafety cabinet. Disinfect each item with 70% ethanol.\nTurn on the UV lamp before starting the aliquoting procedure for a minimum of 15 min, to further disinfect materials transferred into the biological safety cabinet.\nNote: Take precautions to ensure safety from UV exposure by closing the sash or protective covering of the hood and/or leaving the area.\nTransfer aliquot for UV exposure.\nUsing a sterile glass serological pipette, mix and transfer the entirety of a chosen cell aliquot with a chosen exposure period to the bottom half of a sterile glass Petri dish containing a metal paper clip.\nPlace the dish on top of the stir plate.",
    "Allow the culture to mix at a rate of 2–3 revolutions per second, ensuring that the cell solution is homogeneous and does not leave the inside of the Petri dish.\nPerform UV exposure.\nTurn on the UV bulb for the intended time exposure period as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nNote: Homogeneity of the cell culture during UV exposure is important to ensure even exposure to all the cells in solution.\nTransfer mutagenized cells to a new 50 mL centrifuge tube using a new sterile glass serological pipette.\nNote: Cells are more likely to stick to the surface of the Petri dish and pipette after being mutagenized. Additional fresh media can be used to remove cells that are adhering to the Petri dish if necessary. The cell solution can then be centrifuged resuspended to the appropriate cell concentration to account for the added media.\nRepeat steps 6–8 for each exposure period: 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 s.\nPause point: After UV exposure the cells can be kept for 12–24 hours, in their respective tubes, for plating the next day if needed.\nSurvival curve plating and growth\nTiming: 1–3 months\nPerform a serial dilution of the mutagenized cells from each time point. In a sterile environment, a small volume of dilutions containing 1 × 105, 1 × 104, or 1 × 103 mutagenized cells will be plated in parallel. The numbers stated here reflect the number of mutagenized cells to be transferred; only a fraction will survive the mutagenesis process and form colonies on the plate. Plating a range of cell concentrations ensures the ability to quantify colonies, as too many colonies may increase the difficulty of counting the number accurately.\nPrepare a serial dilution of mutagenized cells for plating.",
    "Centrifuge and resuspend the mutagenized cell cultures of each time exposure period to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL in fresh MB.\nFrom each tube, transfer 1 mL of each 1 × 106 cells/mL dilution into a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 9 mL of fresh MB to obtain a concentration of 1 × 105 cells per mL.\nTransfer 1 mL of each 1 × 105 cells per mL solution to a new tube containing 9 mL of fresh MB to obtain a concentration of 1 × 104 cells per mL.\nPlating of mutagenized cells.\nLabel previously prepared agar media plates for each mutagenized cell dilution created in the previous step. Include the number of cells added, UV exposure period, and replicate name (“r1”, etc.).\nUsing 1 mL serological pipette, transfer a 100 μL aliquot from the prepared 1 × 106 cells per mL solution onto at least 3 dishes of 0.5 g/L glucose + MB media, close the dish lid, and set the dish to the side.\nEvenly spread the mutagenized cell solution across the Petri dish using a new disposable spreader for each plate.\nAllow each plate to dry thoroughly with the lid off within the sterile hood and then parafilm. Each plate will require approximately 2–3 min to dry.\nRepeat this process with the 1 × 105 and 1 × 104 cells per mL solutions.\nNote: A consistent volume and mixing of the solution during plating is important to ensure comparable numbers across replicates.\nNote: Ensure plates are thoroughly dried before sealing with parafilm. Any residual liquid may move within the Petri dish and spread colony cells after the initial plating date. This may cause over-counting errors, affecting accuracy.",
    "Place Petri dishes with mutagenized cells into the growth environment prepared for physiologically consistent Symbiodiniaceae as demonstrated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3037-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Survival curve and growth plate\n(A) Growth environment containing solid media plates with growing mutant Symbiodiniaceae colonies.\n(B) Example of grown Breviolum minutum colonies after 180 s of UV exposure and allowed to grow on solid agar media. Scale bar: 10 mm.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n(C) Example of a UV exposure survival curve after analysis.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Error bars shown represent the standard deviation of the percent survival of replicates from the same time exposure.\n(D) An example of a pigment mutant colony among other mutant colonies with natural variation. Scale bar: 1 mm.\nGrow colonies for approximately 1–3 months. An example of fully grown colonies on a agar plate is given in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nCritical: It is important to check the solid cultures periodically over time to prevent mutant colonies from growing into one another, preventing accurate quantification, and increasing the difficulty of downstream isolation of individual colonies. Colonies can range in size but are ready to be counted when the cells of each colony on the plate are consistent in dark brown in color.\nSurvival curve generation\nTiming: 1 day\nGenerate a survival curve relating the dosage dependent response of the mutagenized cells to UV exposure period through the quantification of colonies and subsequent plotting the data as a scatter plot in spreadsheet software. A survival curve from Jinkerson et al. 2022 is given as an example in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.\nUsing a dissection microscope, count and record the number of surviving colonies for each replicate plate.\nGroup the data based on the same number of mutagenized cells initially plated (1 × 105, 1 × 104, or 1 × 103 mutagenized cells) for direct comparison.",
    "Within each group (1 × 105, 1 × 104, or 1 × 103 mutagenized cells), divide the colony count value of each UV exposure period plate by the colony count value of the unexposed plate of the same replicate number (“r1”, etc.). and multiply the resultant fraction by 100, to obtain the relative percentage of survival at the given UV exposure period.\nObtain the average and standard deviation for each resultant percent value.\nFor each group, generate a scatter plot displaying the UV exposure period against percent survival. Change the Y-axis to log scale to observe linearity.\nMutant screening and isolation\nTiming: 1 month\nOnce the survival curve is established, a UV exposure period can be selected based on survival rate and individual experimental needs for the creation of mutants. Grown colonies from the chosen UV exposure period can be isolated and used in downstream processes, such as phenotypic screening. In practice, this can be broken down into two steps: a primary screen to identify possible mutants and a secondary screen to confirm the desired phenotype. Plates of colonies with a UV exposure period correlating with 1% or lower survival have been used successfully for discovery of mutant strains of interest.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nChoose a phenotypic trait of interest.\nVisually inspect the colonies corresponding to the UV exposure period of choice for phenotypes of interest using a dissection microscope. An example of a colony with a differing color phenotype is given on Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D.\nIsolate mutant colonies of interest from solid media growth plates.\nIn a sterile environment, prepare a separate solid media plate or 96 well plate containing 200 μL of MB based liquid media per well for transfer. The media formulation chosen should be permissible for mutant strain growth.",
    "In a sterile environment, remove the lid of the plate containing the colony of interest and transfer cells from the colony to the destination plate using a sterilized toothpick. Visually ensure cells have securely attached to its surface and that no off-target colony cells have been touched.\nStreak the picked cells to fresh solid media or inoculate liquid media for growth and storage.\nAllow the isolated mutant cells at least 1 month, in a permissive condition, to grow before use in other applications to ensure recovery and viability of the mutant strain cells.\nPerform a secondary screen to verify phenotype of interest.\nCreate multiple backup copies of suspected mutant strains. Potential mutants plated on solid media should be transferred and spread to 2–3 individual solid media plates using sterile toothpicks. For strains suspended in liquid media, transfer 30 μL of the previous culture in a single well into a new well containing fresh 170 μL. These strains should be maintained by transferring to new media monthly for best health.\nPlace the putative mutant and original Breviolum minutum strain into comparable conditions that highlight suspected phenotypic differences and allow growth for approximately 1 month.\nObserve the resulting phenotypes of the mutant strains to verify expected phenotypic change.\nContinue to propagate mutant strains with validated changes in phenotype compared to the original strain.\nNote: Cell colonies can vary in size and have a range of brown coloring due to natural variation, light to darker brown depending on the age and health of the cells in the colony. If performing a secondary screen on solid media, it is important to place the original Symbiodiniaceae strain on the same plate as small variations in the microenvironment may lead to variations in phenotypes.",
    "Note: If necessary, repeat the UV mutagenesis process at the desired exposure period and further plan environmental conditions to highlight the phenotype of interest, including nutrients in the solid media, lighting conditions, and temperature. For example, mutants without the ability to perform photosynthesis were found by growing mutagenized cells heterotrophically in the dark with dextrose.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] In practice, approximately 1000 surviving colonies per plate help ensure successful isolation by reducing the chance of accidental contact with off-target colonies."
