Cell seeding in the AC stimulation chamber\nSeed cells from one side of the chamber after coating. Aspirate on the other side to remove air bubbles. Add 200 μL culture medium to the far end of each reservoir. Allow cells to adhere for around 2–3 h and fill the reservoirs with more medium after cells are attached.\nUse a Pasteur pipette attached to a vacuum line to aspirate any air bubble remaining in the chamber (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCover the plate and incubate for 5 (for coating with FNC) to 30 (for coating with 20 μg/mL collagen I) min in a sterile hood.\nRemove the coating solution by aspirating.\nGently rinse the chamber once with sterile PBS.\nNote: Multiple rinses may be needed for different coating materials that are dissolved in an acidic or alkaline solution.\nPrepare target cell suspension.\nRemove medium and rinse the MCF10A cells expressing ERKTR-mCherry with 3 mL PBS twice in a T25 flask.\nTrypsinize MCF10A cells expressing ERKTR-mCherry with 2 mL 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA for 15–20 min following the ATCC’s protocol (ATCC # CRL-10317).\nNeutralize the trypsin by adding 4 mL culture medium or 2 mL 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor.\nCollect the single cell suspension after gentle pipetting.\nAdjust cell concentration after counting to approximately 5 × 105/mL.\nSeed cells in the stimulation chamber.\nRemix the cell suspension gently.",
    "Note: Mixing the cell suspension might introduce stress and reduce cell viability. We suggest to only mix the cell suspension every 2 min by gently shaking or by using a large gauge pipette tip and pipetting gently. This will prevent natural sedimentation caused by gravity while minimizing unnecessary stress caused by mixing.\nLoad 10 μL cell suspension through one side of the chamber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: To maintain a consistent environment for the cells, it is necessary to limit total cell numbers that does not result in nutrient depletion during the experiment. We typically load 5,000 cells in 10 μL medium to each chamber in the dish which only covers the 10 mm-channel area for imaging. The cells should be about 50% confluent the next day. It would be difficult to distinguish each cell in the images of high confluency during ERK quantification.\nAspirate using a 2 μL pipette from the other side if needed to remove air bubbles.\nGently add 200 μL cell culture medium to the far end of each reservoir without connecting to the cell suspension in the chamber in order to raise the humidity which helps prevent drying of the medium (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nAdd PBS to all spaces in the plate between the PDMS device and the dish to further increase the humidity in the plate.\nCover the plate and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for about 2 h.\nWhen cells are attached to the substrate, gently add additional 0.5 mL growth medium to each medium reservoir.",
    "Critical: Check cells using an inverted microscope. Add enough medium to fulfill the two reservoirs when cells are fully attached, i.e., flattened and spread out. But if the cells are still spherical, they would need more time to attach. View with a microscope to make sure cells remain in the chamber with an expected density (∼150 cells/mm2 in our cases) after adding the medium.\nIncubate cells 12–18 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 to allow cells to fully attach.\nPause point: Cells seeded in the chambers can be used for experiments in the next 2–3 days before cells get too confluent. Cell density might be a confounding factor that affects the basal ERK activity as cells actively deplete nutrients from the medium. Performing the experiments with a certain density range is important for data comparison. We typically use a monolayer with ∼50%–70% confluence in the experiments.\nCell starvation to reduce the basal ERK level.\nAfter cells are fully attached and adapted to the chamber, aspirate culture medium from both reservoirs of each chamber.\nNote: Cells need some time to recover from trypsinization, we typically incubate cells overnight (12–18 h) before starvation.\nRinse the chamber 3 times with PBS to remove unattached cells and growth factors in the old medium.\nNote: Rinsing the chamber with the flow of solution may cause significant shearing stress on the cell surface. We suggest reducing fluid pressure difference between two reservoirs to minimize the shear stress when rinsing the chamber. For cells with relatively weak attachment to the dish, such as PC12 cells, extra coating with appropriate proteins or peptides (e.g., Collagen IV for PC12 cells) can help reduce the risk of cell detachment.\nFill the chambers with serum-free, growth factor-free medium to starve cells.",
    "Incubate cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 for at least 3 h.\nMonitoring ERK dynamics using time-lapse microscopy during AC stimulation\nTiming: 1–3 days\nThis section describes a step-by-step walkthrough of live-cell fluorescence imaging of ERKTR during AC stimulation with enhanced sensitivity and temporal resolution.\nNote: The protocol below describes the specific steps for using ERKTR-mCherry to monitor ERK activation dynamics. However, we have also used a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based kinase biosensors, EKAR3, in MCF10A cells to monitor ERK dynamics following this protocol.\nExperimental setup for AC stimulation.\nCarefully aspirate the medium from the imaging chamber and wash the reservoirs twice with 1 mL of PBS (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nAdd 1 mL of low fluorescence imaging medium to each reservoir.\nTransfer the dish containing starved cells to be studied to the temperature-controlled chamber of the imaging system and mount the dish securely on the microscope stage.\nNote: Our Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope has separated temperature and CO2 control module. Turn on the microscope and the control module. Set the temperature to 37°C and allow the temperature to stabilize for 20–30 min before mounting the dish. Switch on the CO2 control module when needed.\nCover the dish using a sterilized lid with holes on it. Align the holes to the reservoirs.\nMount the Ag/AgCl electrodes with one on each reservoir and dip the tip of the electrodes in the medium (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nConnect the electrodes with the AC power supply via electric cables (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Optional: Electrical stimulation may cause electrochemical reactions in the medium near electrodes. For long-term stimulation, we recommend using agar-salt bridges to minimize the electrochemical byproducts in the medium (Song et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Fill two beakers with Steinberg’s solution and immerse electrodes in the solution. Connect the beakers of Steinberg’s solution to the medium reservoirs of the stimulation chambers with the pre-made agar glass bridges through the holes on the lid.\nSwitch on and adjust the voltage across the AC chamber using a standard voltage meter.\nOptional: For monitoring voltages during experiments, mount platinum wires through an extra pair of holes between the electrodes and seal the holes with 3140 silicone rubber if the platinum wires are too thin to prevent evaporation.\nPerform real-time imaging with precisely controlled AC stimulation.\nStart the image acquisition software and set up parameters required for the time-lapse recording.\nSelect the objective according to the experimental demand. We typically use a low magnification (10×) lens for quick evaluations of the ERK responses with different stimulation and a 40× oil immersion lens for collecting high resolution images of single cells.\nBring the imaging window of the stimulation chamber into focus.\nNavigate to an XY position to select 2 or more regions of interest (ROI) in each chamber for multi-field time-lapse recording. Try to avoid regions where cells are overcrowded.\nCritical: Ensure that the ROI positions are located sufficiently apart to minimize photobleaching and phototoxicity.\nSelect appropriate filters and dichromatic mirrors to acquire differential interference contrast (DIC) images and images of Cyan-fluorescent and red-fluorescent protein fusions.\nDetermine optimal exposure time for each channel. We use the following exposure times in our settings: DIC 100 msec, RFP 300 msec, CFP 500 msec.\nAdjust the focus manually at each ROI as necessary.",
    "Set auto-focus for DIC channel with a step accuracy of 0.5–1 μm in a range of 3 μm. Run autofocus routinely for each time point to correct for focal drift. Set the autofocus strategy to “update z-positions after each acquisition” if available (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nSet up a time series to acquire images at the desired time points in sequence. For investigating the effects of AC stimulation of different voltages, durations, frequencies, waveforms, or duty ratios on ERK activation, select a 30–60 s time interval over a 2 h period. For long-term monitoring ERK dynamics controlled by the AC with optimized parameters, select a 5 min time interval over a 5–24 h period.\nGive it a dry run by clicking the acquisition button without any AC stimulation.\nStop image recording after finishing the second frame of all ROIs. Check the images to confirm that the image focus and exposure are set correctly and have not shifted during multi-position acquisition.\nStart the time-lapse experiment by clicking the acquisition button again.\nImage the cells for 5–30 min before any stimulation to acquire a baseline signal.\nCritical: A minimum baseline recording of 5 min is required to determine the effect of AC stimulation. Longer times may be required if a drift in the baseline is observed (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nSwitch on the AC with desired voltage, frequency, and waveform to stimulate cells in each chamber. Use a time relay to automatically control the on and off duration of AC stimulation.\nMonitor the voltage during stimulation and adjust it if needed.\nCheck that all stage positions are still in focus at later points.",
    "Optional: Stage drift is a common complication when performing time-lapse recordings that span multiple hours. Even with addition of autofocus by the microscope software, stage drift can still occur and thus the following is recommended if it becomes problematic. If stage positions need to be refocused, pause imaging acquisition at an appropriate time point, adjust the focus and resume imaging within the defined imaging time interval.\nStop image acquisition at a defined time point and shut down the computer and microscope.\nOptional: Remove the PDMS chamber and fix the cells immediately after stimulation for immunostaining if needed.\nGeneration of time-lapse movies using ImageJ software.\nLaunch ImageJ program and import the imaging file using “File>Import>Image sequence”. In the “Image sequence”, adjust the numbers of “Starting image” and “Increment” to obtain a separate image stack for each illumination channel (DIC, RFP, CFP) of each ROI position.\nOptional: Adjust the brightness and/or contrast to attain a better view of the images by clicking “Image>Adjust>Brightness/Contrast” or “Ctrl”+“Shift”+“C”.\nCrop the images to exclude non-cell areas and to minimize the file size to accelerate subsequent quantification processes. Use the “Rectangular Selection” tool to select a smaller ROI in the DIC image stack and duplicate the stack of ROI with “Ctrl”+“Shift”+“D”.\nCrop the same ROI for RFP and CFP stacks using \"Edit>Selection>Restore Selection\" and “Ctrl”+“Shift”+“D”.\nSave cropped image stacks as single “.tiff” files.\nData analysis to extract single-cell kinetics.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2061-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic depicting the experimental set-up\n(A) Connecting the AC EF stimulation chamber with the AC power supply through a pair of agar salt bridges.",
    "(B) Cells seeded in the AC stimulation chambers are imaged using a fully automated fluorescence microscope with an incubation chamber to maintain an optimal culture condition. AC EFs are applied through a pair of Ag electrodes with the desired stimulation scheme precisely controlled by a digital time relay. A voltmeter is connected in parallel with the stimulation chamber to monitor the output voltage. The time-lapse images are recorded using Metamorph.\nImport .tiff stacks to MATLAB for image segmentation, tracking, and intensity quantitation as described previously (Pargett et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nIdentify the nuclear region based on the nuclear localization of EKAR3 which contains a nuclear import sequence.\nDefine the cytosolic region as the neighboring 7-pixel outside the nuclear region.\nCalculate cell ERKTR level as Fc/Fn, where Fc and Fn stand for the RFP fluorescence intensity of cytosol and nucleus, respectively."
