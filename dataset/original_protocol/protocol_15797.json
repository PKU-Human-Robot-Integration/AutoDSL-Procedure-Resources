    "All experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Chungnam National University in South Korea, and then conducted based on the ethical guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain18.\n1. Induction of scalding burn injury on the hind paw\nHouse the male ICR mice weighing 20-25 g in a light and temperature-controlled room (12/12 h light-dark cycle, 22.5 °C ± 2.5 °C) with a humidity of 40%-60%.\n\tNOTE: Both male and female mice can be used for this protocol.\nAllow the animal free access to food and water, and acclimatize for at least 1 week before starting the experiment.\n\tNOTE: All the animals were group-housed to exclude variables such as isolation stress.\nAssign the mice randomly to the experimental or control group and conduct blind experiments using animal numbers as codes.\nOn the day of burn induction, anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 300 µL of alfaxalone at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Wear a surgical gown, gloves, and mask while performing the burn induction.\nAfter deeply anesthetizing the mouse, disinfect around the right hind paw with 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Check the lack of response to pinch stimulation applied to the hind toes or tail to confirm the state of deep anesthesia.\nApply an ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent corneal drying after induction of anesthesia.\nImmerse the right hind paw of the deeply anesthetized mouse in hot water at 65 °C ± 0.5 °C for 3 s. Make a mark on the ankle of each mouse before immersing the hind paw in hot water to maintain consistency in the burned area.\nAfter induction of burns, bring the mice in a clean home cage and place them on a heating pad until the animals recover from anesthesia.",
    "​NOTE: The analgesic agent, acetaminophen (200 mg/kg), was administered intraperitoneally once daily for 7 days starting from the day of burn injury (Only Burn + Acetaminophen group). The Burn group was treated with saline as vehicle control. The experiment was performed according to the method described in a previous study4.\n2. Measurement of mechanical allodynia\nBring the mice to the behavioral testing room and let them acclimatize at least for 30 min prior to the test. Wear a surgical gown, gloves, and mask while performing the test.\nPlace the mice into a square box (diameter: 13 cm, height: 12 cm) on a metal mesh floor (mesh size: 0.7 cm x 0.7 cm) and let them acclimatize for at least 30 min.\nAssess the mechanical threshold of the hind paw using the ascending stimulus method19,20.\nGently poke a series of von Frey filaments with 5-8 s intervals to stimulate the hind plantar. Obtain the baseline values on the day before burn induction.\n\tNOTE: The 0.16-1.2 g von Frey filaments were used in the test to measure the paw withdrawal threshold in all animals, respectively. The paw withdrawal response test was started with the lowest bending force of von Frey filament (0.16 g in this protocol). If there was no response, then a filament with the next bending force was applied.\nPerform five trials to evaluate mechanical thresholds for each ipsilateral (injured) hind paw.\n\tNOTE: The bending force of von Frey filament that produces response more than three times of the five trials in each animal was expressed as paw withdrawal threshold (PWT, g). Mechanical thresholds were measured a day before and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after burn injury. Analgesic effect was assessed 1 h after administration of the acetaminophen in the animal.\n3. Automated gait analysis",
    "Acclimate the mice in the gait analysis system once daily for 10-15 min from 5 days before the burn injury. Wear a surgical gown, gloves, and mask while performing gait analysis.\nOn the day of the test, bring the mice to the behavioral test room and acclimatize them for at least 30 min before the test.\n\tNOTE: Perform acclimation and gait analysis tests in a dark environment. Set the conditions of the program menu as follows.\n\t\nAfter running the program, click on the Create New Experiment menu to designate the folder to save the data.\nAfter designation, set the maximum running time to 5 s and maximum allowed speed variations to 50%.\nSelect a registered camera and set the walkway length to 30 cm in the Setup tab of the program.\nOn the Acquire tab of the program menu, select Open Acquisition.\nBased on the status messages, click on the Snap Background button to acquire a background image of an empty walkway.\nClick on the Start Acquisition button, and then place the mouse at the entrance of the left-right traversable walkway. The recording will automatically start following the free movement of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: If the animal's gait has been successfully recorded and all footsteps have been detected, it will be marked as Compliant Run with a green icon. If the software does not detect any footsteps, a red icon is displayed, in which case it is recommended to perform the recording again. The authors recommend collecting and analyzing at least five successful compliant runs performed with similar running speeds.\nOn the Acquire tab of the program menu, select Classify Runs.\n\tNOTE: After selecting the data obtained from the successful compliance run above, go to the video analysis screen where the gait patterns of the mice were recorded.",
    "Select the run to be analyzed and click on the Auto Classify button.\nAfter performing automatic classification, remove nose, genital recognition, and the misrecognition of paws to junk data in each run, and then analyze the data.\n\t​NOTE: All statistical parameters are automatically analyzed and saved in the program, and raw data values can be found in the experimenter's analysis menu. Automatic gait analysis was performed before and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after burn injury. The evaluation was performed 30 min after acetaminophen administration in the Burn + Acetaminophen group and 30 min after saline treatment in the Burn group. This experiment was performed according to the method described in the previous studies4,21,22.\n4. Measurement of depression-like behavior\nNOTE: Despair-based behavior, immobility time in the water was measured by the forced swimming test.\nBring the mice to the behavioral test room and acclimatize them for at least 30 min before the test. Wear a surgical gown, gloves, and mask while performing the forced swimming test.\nPut the mouse into a clear plexiglass cylinder (10 cm x 25 cm) containing 15 cm of water (25 °C ± 0.5 °C) for 15 min.\nAfter 24 h, put the mouse into the cylinder of the same conditions and measure the immobility time.\n\tNOTE: Immobility time was measured for 5 min of test time, and the time whenever mice stopped climbing or swimming and just floated to keep their head above the water surface was recorded. The forced swimming test was performed on day 7 after the burn injury. The evaluation was performed 1 h after acetaminophen administration in the Burn + Acetaminophen group, and 1 h after saline treatment in the Burn group. The experiment was performed according to the method described in previous studies23,24.",
    "5. Measurement of normal motor function\nNOTE: The rota-rod test was performed to differentiate the abnormal motor function after burn injury.\nBring the mice to the behavioral test room and acclimatize them for at least 30 min before the test. Wear a surgical gown, gloves, and mask while performing the forced swimming test.\nPlace the animals on a rolling cylindrical platform (5.7 cm wide; 3 cm diameter) suspended 16 cm above the bottom of the apparatus.\nAllow each animal to train once a day on a rota-rod for at least 5 days prior to induction of burn injury.\nPerform the rota-rod test every 20 min for 2 h after drug administration. Set the cut-off time to 2 min.\nMeasure the duration of time the mouse runs on a rotating rod at the constant speed of 15 revolutions per minute without falling.\n\tNOTE: The rota-rod test was performed 7 days after the induction of burn injury. The evaluation was performed immediately after acetaminophen administration in the Burn + Acetaminophen group and after saline treatment in the Burn group. Alfaxalone was used as a positive control for experimentally treated drugs in this test. During the rotarod test, the duration of time the mouse runs on the rotating rod without falling is measured. The experiment was performed according to the method described in previous studies22,25.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
