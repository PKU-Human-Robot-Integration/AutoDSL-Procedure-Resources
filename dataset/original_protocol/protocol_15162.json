    "1. Preparation: Starting Up\nYou need:\n\t\na VU-AMS5fs ambulatory recording device (including an infrared interface cable that either connects to the RS232 serial port of a PC or to a USB port).\n7 electrodes (we used ConMed 1690-003).\n2 charged AA-batteries.\nan empty CompactFlash memory card (the VU-AMS5fs has been extensively tested with the 1GB 80x CF card from Transcend (TS1GCF80), but other CF cards should work too).\na laptop or PC with flash card reader and the Data Analysis Management Software (DAMS) suite installed.\na stopwatch.\nmusic player with children's stories and headphones and a small self-inflatable air mattress are optional.\nCheck the time and date settings on the laptop/PC, since these will be recorded as metadata on your files. Put the empty memory card and full batteries in the VU-AMS device (successful placement is signalled by a triple beep). When the device is on standby, the green light will flash twice every ten seconds. This indicates it is ready, but not recording. Now connect the device to the laptop using the provided cable and start up the DAMS program. Initiate communication with the device (select the tab 'device' and choose the appropriate connection mode, infrared cable or bluetooth).\nHave the participant take off his/her upper body wear. In the places where the electrodes will be placed,clean the skin with alcohol-wipes, and place the seven electrodes on the chest and back (Figure 1). Then attach the lead wires following the color scheme, and connect them to the device.\nCheck the battery type and battery voltage indication (this should be about 3.4 V for alkaline and about 2.4 V for rechargeable NiMH batteries). Fill out the identification field. The typical sampling frequencies are as shown in the figure (Figure 2).",
    "Measure the distance between the two chest electrodes in millimeters, and fill this out in the field 'ICG-V distance'. Then click 'send settings' to send the current settings/ID to the device.\nNow, the 'Online' option of the program should be used to display the ECG, ΔZ (this is the respiration) and dZ/dt (this is the ICG). The ΔZ signal reflects the base impedance across the thorax, which after appropriate filtering can be used to extract the respiration signal with high fidelity 7. The dZ/dt signal is the ΔZ differentiated over time and reflects rapid changes in ΔZ linked to the ejection of blood from the ventricle into the aorta.\n\t\nA clear QRST-complex should be detectable in the ECG. The R-wave should be upward and it should be the peak with the largest (absolute) amplitude in either direction.\nThe ΔZ should be within -0.5 and +0.5 Ω most of the time and dZ/dt between -1 and +1 Ω/sec.\nZ0 should always stay within an 8 to 20 Ω range. This variation reflects the fact that the thorax impedance signal depends on the distance between the measuring electrodes which is a function of the child's height, and the 'wetness' of the thorax column enclosed by the measuring electrodes, differences in body composition (e.g. BMI) can affect the amplitude of the dZ/dt signal (fat mass containing less water than muscle). Individual differences in absolute Z0 amplitude are also reflected in the ΔZ signal but this does not affect the determination of systolic time intervals, which are amplitude-independent.\nThe ΔZ signal should reflect deep breathing of the subject clearly (instruct the child to take a slow deep breath and exhale slowly).",
    "In the ICG the typical upward waveform reflecting the cardiac ejection phase should be clearly detectable. Light movement of the subject should not distort the dZ/dt signal. If these criteria are not met, re-clean the skin and re-attach the electrodes until satisfactory signals are obtained.\nWhen good signals are attained, start data recording by pressing the 'start' button. You will hear a beep acknowledging the start of the recording and the green light will start flashing once every three seconds. The registration has now started. Close the VU-DAMS program. You can now disconnect the device from the interface cable.\n2. The Registration Period\nOnce the registration has started, ask the child to lie down for the first experimental condition. When the child has been in the supine position (without head-up tilt) for two minutes, you shortly (< 2 s) press the small black button on top of the device. Pressing this button marks a special event, and will later on help you identify the start of this condition in your data.\nAfter four minutes, press the event button again. This signals the end of the lying down condition. Now have the child sit up and repeat the procedure for this second condition. Press the button, wait four minutes and press the button again. The children are instructed to rest quietly during these conditions.\nTo stop the measurement, press and hold down the button for at least 3 sec. The light will flash every 10 sec to indicate it has stopped and is in 'stand by' mode. Once the device has stopped, you may disconnect the lead wire plug from the connector and the lead wires from the electrodes.",
    "Remove the batteries and flash card form the VU-AMS device and place the flash card in the reader unit. Move the acquired files to a designated directory (typically the name of the directory will be identical to the subject identifier used in the identification field).\n3. Processing the Data\nUpon opening the data with VU-DAMS program, the data will be automatically converted from raw data format (extension .5fs) to a new format (extension .amsdata). This is the data file that VU-DAMS will be using in the ensuing steps.\nFirst extract the Inter Beat Interval time series from the ECG signal. Select the Detect R-peaks tab. An automated algorithm will detect all R-peaks in the ECG signal and select (if present) periods with very low ECG quality for removal. In the upper left hand corner the number of Blue (correct), Yellow (medium suspicious) or RED (highly suspicious) is indicated. By pressing '.' (DOT) the cursor is moved to the next suspicious R-peak and the user can delete or add markers for R-waves by hand. It is recommended that at least all highly suspicious beats are visually inspected.\nThe main aim is to obtain a mean value for the heart rate, the preejection period (PEP) and measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, HF, RMSSD) across the experimental conditions used. Therefore proceed by indicating which periods in the raw data correspond to these conditions. This process is called 'data labeling'. Select the Label Data tab. Two panels show the heart rate signal and movement signal respectively, as well as the actual time of the recording.",
    "Place the mouse cursor in the top bar where it says \"click and drag to add labels\" at around the start time of your first condition and drag the mouse to the end time of that condition. These times are either obtained from a written record of start and stop times (that you noted down during data collection) or you can use the start and stop markers obtained from pressing the button at the start and end of each condition, which are the vertical lines running across the HR and movement graphs.\nEach label can be given a (unique) identifier to signal a particular condition. In our case we have only one category for our labels: experimental condition. This category has two values: lying down and sitting up.\nVU-DAMS needs to be made aware of the experimental design by a so-called label configuration file (label.cfg). This is an ASCII file that can be opened with most text editors and, for example, looks like this:\n\t# exp_condition\n\t10 lying down\n\t11 sitting up\nBy placing the label.cfg file in the directory of the .amsdata files, it will be automatically loaded by the VU-DAMS program. Once a label has been made, a pop up screen will appear with the categories/values listed in the label.cfg file. Select 'lying down' for the first label and 'sitting up' for the second label.",
    "After labeling, select the 'Impedance scoring' tab to score the PEP in the impedance cardiogram. For each of the conditions an ensemble averaged dZ/dt waveform is displayed, time-locked to the ECG R-peak. An ensemble averaged ECG is presented below the dZ/dt waveform. Place the four vertical cursors in the correct positions: ECG Q-wave onset (start of electrical activity), ICG B-point (start of the ejection phase), ICG dZ/dt-min (maximal ejection speed), and ICG X-point (aortic valve closure - end of ejection phase).\nNext, select the 'Respiration Scoring' tab to score the peak-valley RSA using the respiratory and ECG signals. Automated breath-to-breath scoring of the respiratory interval and the shortest interbeat interval during inspiration and the longest interbeat interval during expiration can now be inspected. Typically the automated detection algorithm should not classify more than 15% of the breaths as deviant - otherwise inspect the respiration signal and tune the parameters of the detection algorithm as needed.\n\tGuidelines for visual inspection of the ECG, ICG and respiration signals and interactive PEP and RSA scoring can be found on the VU-AMS website, www.vu-ams.nl[href=http://www.vu-ams.nl].\nFinally, select the Label Information tab. A table with the results appears after calculation. Each row represents the average value of a series of physiological parameters (heart rate, PEP, RSA, RR) for each labeled time period. The first column has the subject identifier (Label_ID). The last column indicates the values of all categories used during labeling (here only a single category 'experimental condition' with two values, 'sitting up' and 'lying down'). Spectral powers of the interbeat interval times series are given only for labels with a minimum length of 4 min (otherwise the missing code is displayed). The spreadsheet in this display can be exported to ASCII or EXCEL for further statistical analyses."
