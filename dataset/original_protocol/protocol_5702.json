    "Overview: We vaporized specific amounts of liquid 2-nonanone in the vaporizing tank to make 2-nonanone gas of known concentrations, and measured GC values to calculate a calibration curve. Next, a gas phase of 0.2 ml in an agar plate was sampled and measured with the GC. Although we did the following with 2-nonanone, our method should be applicable for other odorants that are vaporized from the liquid at room temperature and can be measured by gas chromatography. Important steps are summarized in Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Important steps for measuring odor gradient. A video demonstrating the important apparatus and operations for the odor measurement. Measuring known concentrations of 2-nonanone gas for a calibration curve2-nonanone gas of known concentration can be obtained by vaporizing a specific amount of 2-nonanone liquid in the vaporizing tank (see below). A calibration curve can be obtained by measuring different concentrations of the gas with GC and correlating the measured values. However, the time to reach maximum odor concentration varied for each amount of liquid, likely due to differences in vaporization, diffusion, and trace adhesion to the vaporizing tank wall. Therefore, we monitored temporal changes in odor concentration in the tank to find the optimal time for vaporization of each concentration.Flow the carrier gas at 0.25-0.35 MPa from the air cylinder connected to the GC.Note: Do this immediately before turning on the GC.Turn on the GC immediately after Step A1.Note: Flowing gas without turning on power will damage the column inside the GC.Wait until the ‘Ready’ lamp is illuminated.Notes: This may take about 90 min.If the GC is used after a long interval (e.g., more than 2 weeks), the measured value tends to be higher. In that case, use the GC a few days before taking actual measurements.",
    "An interval of up to several days has no effect.The high values recorded after long intervals are attributed to the following: During the interval, the sensor surface is coated with various small compounds in the air. Electrical conduction increases the temperature of the sensor to 300-400 °C, which clarifies the attached compounds and causes transient high sensitivity for several hours.The directions above are specific to the GC instrument used in this study. Other instrumentation may require adapted methods and steps.Turn on the electrical switch of the vaporizing tank (Figure 1), and set the temperature at 50 °C: It will take about 10 min to reach 50 °C.Take an appropriate amount of 2-nonanone liquid (Table 1) with a glass syringe of 5 μl or 50 μl, insert it in the liquid inlet on the lid of the tank, and place the liquid in the vaporizing groove installed on the back side of the lid.Table 1. Volumes of 2-nonanone liquid for the vaporizationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401224627_4834.jpgThe relationship between the liquid volume and the estimated gas concentration in Table 1 is as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401224659_3025.jpgwhere C is the required gas concentration (mol/L), Vliquid is the amount of liquid (ml) to be added, d is the density of liquid odorant (g/ml), M is the molecular weight (g), and Vtank is the volume of the vaporizing tank (L).Start SGC.exe on a Windows PC connected to the GC and operate according to the manual.Press the start button in SGC.exe.After a certain period of time (see Table 1), carefully insert the replacement needle attached to the disposable syringe from the gas outlet. Extract 0.2 ml and quickly remove the needle from the tank. Carefully insert the needle in the gas inlet of the GC (Figure 2) until it hits the bottom, and immediately infuse the gas inside the syringe.",
    "Note: This step should be completed in about 5-6 sec.Measurement is started by gas injection. Drawing of the graph (Figure 3) starts and ends automatically. Data is automatically saved. In the default setting, a measurement takes 8 min. The file can be exported as a CSV file.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401225009_8958.jpgFigure 3. A representative result of one measurement for 22.9 μM (i.e., 200 μl) of 2-nonanone. The horizontal axis is time (sec), and the vertical axis is the signal (mV).To measure temporal changes in the measured value for the specific amount of the odorant, odor gas sampling can be performed at different time points for one odorant injection (e.g., 6, 18, 30, and 42 min for 6.8 and 11.1 μM; see Table 1). However, if there is no 8-min interval (e.g., 1, 2, 3, and 4 min for 0.04 and 0.12 μM), clean the tank (see the next section) and start from the gas vaporization.If gas remains in the tank (likely by adhesion to the wall), vaporization of the residual amount affects the GC value, especially when a small concentration is being measured. In order to avoid this, gas in the tank is removed with a vacuum cleaner, and the wall is wiped with a paper towel containing EtOH, followed by further suction with the vacuum cleaner. After this procedure, remaining gas was not detected in our experiment.For all conditions, repeat the measurement 3-4 times (once daily and repeat over 3-4 days) and find the time at which the average value is at a maximum (Figure 4). In the case of 2-nonanone, the relationship between odor concentrations and measured values are nicely fitted to two regression lines for concentrations lower and higher than 4 μM (R2 = 0.9991 and 0.9995, respectively; Figure 5) (Tanimoto et al., 2017).",
    "In general, for semiconductor detectors, the correlation between the peak height of the signal and signal concentration in a log-log plot is well-fitted by two simple regression lines for lower and higher concentrations. Therefore, these results are adopted as calibration curves for low and high concentrations. Excel (Microsoft) is used for data analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401225338_7038.jpgFigure 4. Changes over time of the measured value for different amounts of liquid odor. On each graph, the expected 2-nonanone gas concentration at saturation is shown. The horizontal (vaporizing time) and vertical (sensor output) axes are different in each graph. For 2-nonanone gas with a low saturation concentration of 0.04-0.12 μM, the concentration became saturated immediately and then decreased slightly. This is likely because of adhesion of 2-nonanone to the wall. For each condition, results are shown as mean ± standard error of 3-4 repetitions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401225421_3266.jpgFigure 5. Calibration curve for 2-nonanone. Each dot represents average values of 3-4 experiments, and data on the log-log plot were fitted with two simple regression lines for lower (squares) and higher (triangles) concentrations. This figure was originally published in Tanimoto et al. (2017).Measuring 2-nonanone gradient on an agar plateOn the back side of the agar plate, mark the positions of odor spot and gas sampling with a pen.Note: We measured at six points (x, y, z) on the assay plate shown in Figure 6 at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 min. The motivations for adopting 6 points (x, y) for measurement are as follows: Since we examined odor avoidance behavior of C. elegans, the four points on the x axis were chosen to measure the direction avoided by C. elegans, i.e., to measure the spatial gradient along the x direction. In the range of x > 0 in which C. elegans mainly existed, three points were chosen.",
    "Only one point was measured in the range x < 0 where C. elegans did not often exist.To measure the spatial gradient in the y direction, (22, 15) was selected. We chose only one point because the worms did not spread much along the y axis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401225732_9495.jpgFigure 6. Gas sampling from the agar plate [originally published in Tanimoto et al. (2017). Creative Commons Attribution License[href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/]]Remove the lid of the agar plate, and push the narrow end of a Pasteur pipette with a dropper bulb against the agar and extract the agar plug to make a hole of ø 1-2 mm in the agar layer. Then close the lid.From the back of the plate (i.e., the opposite side of the lid), make a hole with a pin vise with a 1 mm drill at the position of the agar hole. This will result in a hole in the same position on the plate and the agar.If necessary, use cellophane tape to cover the hole from the back side. Turn back one side of the cellophane tape for ease of peeling. This is not necessary for odorants with large molecular weights such as 2-nonanone. We compared outcomes with and without taping, and found no difference.Spot the liquid odorant at the odor source position (we used 2 μl of 30% 2-nonanone diluted in EtOH), immediately cover the lid, place the plate upside-down (hole up) and leave it on the bench.Note: In the worm’s odor avoidance assay, worms suspended in a small amount of buffer droplet are spotted at the center of the plate 1.5 min before the odor is spotted (Kimura et al., 2010), and the time of odor spotting is counted as t = 0. In this odor measurement, however, the worms are not spotted for the sake of simplicity.",
    "When an appropriate amount of time (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, or 12 min) has passed, remove the tape (if applied) without moving the plate. Carefully insert the replacement needle attached to the plastic 2.0 ml disposable syringe so that the needle hole is positioned in the gas phase 1 mm away from the agar surface (i.e., just below the agar surface in the upside-down plate). Slowly extract 0.2 ml of the gas so as not to disturb the gradient severely. Quickly remove the needle tip from the plate and insert it in the gas inlet of the GC, and inject the gas.Note: Since sampling may destroy the gradient, only one sample was taken from each plate.Several samples should be taken (we took 7-9) for each position and time, using the median to calculate the dynamic odor gradient.Fitting the odor gradientModel selectionAt the beginning of curve fitting, a parametric function needs to be specified for the data. Physical phenomena caused in the assay plate are evaporation of the 2-nonanone-ethanol-mixed solution (30:70, v/v) and diffusion of their gaseous molecules in the three-dimensional closed cylindrical space. Although we previously calculated the evaporation and distribution of 2-nonanone numerically (Yamazoe-Umemoto et al., 2015), in the recent study we employed a phenomenological curve fitting to the measured concentration by least squares method for better understanding of the odor gradient (Tanimoto et al., 2017). After the odor sources are put at the two spots, the 2-nonanone concentration C(t) in the plate increases from zero and asymptotically approaches a constant value over time. In this work, a saturation curve C(t) = a(1-exp(-bt)) was used for fitting, where a and b denote an asymptotic concentration and an increasing rate, respectively.",
    "This function is a solution of the rate equation dC(t)/dt = b(a - C(t)) which implies that C(t) changes with the rate proportional to the difference from the asymptotic concentration.In the measurement, increasing of the 2-nonanone concentration was slow as the distance from the spots is far (Figure 7). A mass transfer by molecular diffusion accounts for this result. Therefore the increasing rate is a decreasing function of the distance r from the spot such as b(r) = b0 exp(-b1 r - b2 r2), where b0 (> 0), b1 and b2 are constant parameters. For good fitting in a relatively short time after putting the odor sources, furthermore, the asymptotic concentration is also a decreasing function of r such as a(r) = a0 exp(-a1 r - a2 r2), where a0 (> 0), a1 and a2 are constant parameters. Because there are two odor sources in the plate, the measured concentrations are fitted to the following function with two saturation curves.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401230932_1858.jpgwhere r1 and r2 are the distances from the position (x, y) on the agar to the two spots (X1, Y1) = (-22, 15) and (X2, Y2) = (-22, -15), respectively.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401231103_4952.jpgThe radius of the plate is 44 mm (1 mm in the plate thickness).Two constraint conditions are imposed on the fitting. The first constraint condition is that a(r) and b(r) should be decreasing functions of r at least in the range 0 ≤ r ≤ r0, where r0 is the distance from the spot to the edge of the plate (44, 0). From da(r)/dr = - a0(a1 + 2a2 r) exp(-a1 r - a2 r2) and db(r)/dr = - b0(b1 + 2b2 r) exp(-b1 r - b2 r2), inequality conditions da(r0)/dr ≤ 0 and db(r0)/dr ≤ 0 (decreasing even at r = r0) are expressed as:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401231731_5042.",
    "jpgunder a0 > 0 and b0 > 0. The second constraint condition is that the asymptotic concentration on the odor sources should be lower than the saturation concentration 34.5 μM of the 2-nonanone (Yamazoe-Umemoto et al., 2015). Letting imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401231909_1027.jpg be the distance between the two spots, this condition is expressed as:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401232041_4066.jpgFitting algorithmThe fitting parameters in C(x, y, t) are determined by the Levenberg-Marquardt method which is widely used to solve non-linear minimization problems (Press et al., 1992). Letting imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpg be the parameter vector,imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200521_1358.jpgthe sum of the squared errors is explicitly defined by:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604201025_2124.jpgWhere un is the n-th measured concentration at position (xn, yn) at time tn (imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401234252_2810.jpg). The inequality constraints are expressed as:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604202152_5883.jpgIntroducing the following function with logarithmic barriers,imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200426_9071.jpgthe given constrained minimization problem is approximately replaced by an unconstrained minimization problem. Where μ is a penalty factor whose value is initially large positive and is reduced to zero as imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpg is converged.

Initial μ and λ are large positive.Step 2: The Jacobian matrices J = ({Jij}), G = ({Gij}), the diagonal matrix M and the residual vector imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200359_1452.jpgare calculated.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604202829_8866.jpgThen, the following linear equation of imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200237_5077.jpg is solved and imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200250_5441.jpg is calculated.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604203236_6097.jpgWhere imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200217_1545.jpg Step 3: If imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200204_9339.jpg for a small constant ε, then imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200150_3677.jpgis determined as a solution, or else go to Step 2 with updating imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpg, μ and λ. If imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604203719_2081.jpg, imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpgis updated by imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200150_3677.jpg checking the inequality constraints. μ and λ are reduced by rates α and β (0 < α, β < 1), respectively. If imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604203948_8102.",
    "jpg or the inequality constraints are not satisfied, imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpg and μ are not updated while λ is increased by a rate 1/β.Execution and resultIn this work, the fitting algorithm is implemented in C language and is compiled by the GNU Compiler Collection. The convergence criterion is ε = 1 x 10-6 . Setting of the decrement rates α and β depends on the choice of an initial imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpg. In particular, the slow reduction of μ requires the avoidance of invalid updating of imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpg, such that the reduction rate α for μ (μ→αμ) is 0.5 < α < 1. When α < 0.5, the penalty factor μ rapidly converges to 0 and an incorrect solution imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpgwithout inequality constraints is derived. Some combinations of initial parameters and decrement rates are tried for fitting. Furthermore, a converged value of  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200604/20200604200417_8051.jpgis used as an initial value in new iterations with different μ and λ. Good fitting parameters are a0 = 20.68 μM, a1 = 0.7355 cm-1, a2 = -0.05408 cm-2, b0 = 0.8384 min-1, b1 = 0.7835 cm-1 and b2 = -0.05761 cm-2. Some software tools are useful for the non-linear curve fitting. Optimization Toolbox in MATLAB provides packages for non-linear least squares minimization. Solver Add-in in Microsoft Excel is also available for non-linear curve fitting.Fitting result is shown in Figure 7. Temporal change of the 2-nonanone gradient is shown in Video 1 in Tanimoto et al. (2017). Although the odor sources spread in a round shape (~5 mm in diameter) in the experiment, their shape in the fitting is considered as a point which has no area. Therefore, the fitted 2-nonanone gradient around the spots became pointy.When a simple exponential function b(r) = b0 exp(-b1 r) was used for fitting, the result was not good.",
    "A higher-order correction of more than r2 term requires for good fitting. When b(r) = b0 exp(-b1 r - b2 r2 - b3 r3) was used for fitting, the result was almost the same as that without the r3 term. Fitting using a polynomial function b(r) = b0 - b1 r - b2 r2 - b3 r3 or a fractional function b(r) = 1/(b0 + b1 r + b2 r2) went bad. Fitting using other saturation curve C(t) = c0 t/(t + c1) or C(t) = c0 t2/(t2 + c1) also went bad.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180402/20180402002230_7074.jpgFigure 7.
