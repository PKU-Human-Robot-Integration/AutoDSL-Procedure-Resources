    "Production of shRNA containing virus particles in HEK293T cellsNote: HIV-1 particles are produced after calcium phosphate transfection in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cell cultureHEK293T cells are cultured in DMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in 175 cm2 tissue culture flasks in 35 ml medium.For maintenance of the HEK293T culture cells are, when approaching confluence (~80%), washed twice with PBS, then trypsinized (0.05% trypsin) and plated after 1/10 dilution in 175 cm2 tissue culture flasks. HEK293T cells are split every 2-3 days.One day before transfection, plate approximately 2 x 106 of HEK293T cells per 10 cm dish in 10 ml medium. Note: After thawing frozen cell vials, HEK293T cells are cultured for at least one week before transfecting them for virus production. In order to maximize viral particle production, HEK293T cells are never kept more than 4 weeks in culture. Calcium phosphate transfectionNote: Protocol is described for transfection of one 10 cm dish. Remove 2 ml medium from dish.Add 8 µl 25 mM chloroquine for a final concentration of 25 µM, incubate for about 5 min before adding the DNA/CaCl2 mix.Prepare DNA mix in nuclease-free H2O in a 15 ml conical tube (10 µg shRNA containing vector, 6.5 µg packaging construct pCMVdelta R8.91, and 3.5 µg VSV-G glycoprotein-expressing vector).Add nuclease-free H2O to the DNA mixture for a final volume of 876 µl.Add 1 ml of 2x HBSS buffer.Slowly (dropwise) add 124 μl of 2 M CaCl2 to the diluted DNA.After addition of CaCl2 gently vortex at the lowest setting for 5 sec (Note: Do not spin down!) and immediately add drop by drop the prepared DNA solution to the cells in the 10 cm dish.Swirl the plate to distribute the solution evenly.Culture for 3-4 h at 37 °C.Remove supernatant.",
    "Add 1 ml of glycerol shock solution, shock for one minute. Note: The addition of glycerol results in an osmotic shock and is thought to cause the release of the DNA from the precipitate (Grosjean et al., 2006).Aspirate shock solution, wash cells in 1 ml DMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and aspirate again.Add 7 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) medium.48 h after transfection, collect supernatant with a 10 ml syringe and filter it through a sterile 0.45 µm PVDF membrane filter.Titer virus for p24 content using Lenti-XTM p24 Rapid Titer Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.Filtered viral supernatant can be used fresh or stored at -80 °C.Spin infection of A2 and A72 J-Lat cells with shRNA containing virus particlesNote: A2 and A72 cells are infected by spin infection.A2 and A72 J-Lat suspension cell cultureA2 and A72 cells are cultured in RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks in 40 ml medium. The flasks are placed horizontally to increase the surface area in which the cells are grown.Cells are split every 1-2 days and should be kept at a concentration of 2 x 105-1.5 x 106/ml.One day before transfection split A2 or A72 cells to 5 x 105/ml.Infection of A2 and A72 J-Lat cellsCount the cells and adjust cell number with new RPMI media (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Add 1 x 106 of A2 or A72 cells to 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes.Centrifuge cell suspension for 3 min at 300 x g (1,800 rpm). Pipette off supernatant completely. Add 500 µl of shRNA virus (1 ng of p24 per 106 cells), 5 µl 1 M HEPES and 0.",
    "5 µl of polybrene (4 µg/ml) in 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes.Centrifuge at 32 °C for 1.5 h at 1,341 x g (2,400 rpm) (Tabletop centrifuge, Beckman).Pipette off supernatant completely.Resuspend cells in 3 ml RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in 6-well tissue culture plates.Culture in CO2 incubator at 37 °C for one day.If shRNA-virus particles contain a puromycin resistant gene, select cells with 2 µg/ml RPMI medium of puromycin. RPMI media (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) with puromycin is changed every two days. Depending on how fast the cells grow and if they are needed for other experiments (e.g., chromatin immunoprecipitation, RNA isolation…) the cells can be grown out by adding media every 2 days and moved to bigger flasks or split to culture them in the 6-well plate. Culture in CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 4-10 days.Analysis of HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activation by flow cytometry (please refer to the bio-protocol: Boehm and Ott, 2017)Count the cells and adjust cell number with new media. About 2 x 105/well of A2 or A72 cells are plated in 96-well tissue culture plates in 195 µl RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). For each condition perform three replicates.Cells are treated with 0.016-10 ng/ml of TNFα (as co-stimulus for maximal activation or to check for synergy), PBS or H2O control (depending on what was used as diluent for TNFα), or left untreated. TNFα and controls are pipetted in 5 µl to reach a total volume of 200 µl/well. Mix cells and TNFα by pipetting up and down at least 3 times.Culture in CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 18-48 h.",
    "Take the plate from the incubator and centrifuge at room temperature for 2 min at 1341 x g (2,400 rpm) (Tabletop centrifuge, Beckman).Then proceed directly to flow cytometry analysis. Cells do not have to be washed or fixed. Notes: For flow cytometry, MACSQuant VYB FACS analyzer was used to run 96-well plates. However, other flow cytometers such as Calibur or LSRII are also suitable for these experiments.If the analysis of cell viability by forward scatter (FSC) vs. side scatter (SSC) is not sufficient for accurate assessment of drug toxicity in drug studies, one of a variety of dyes/stains; for example 7AAD, Propidium iodide or one of the Zombie viability dyes can be used according to manufacturer’s instructions in the flow cytometric analysis in this protocol. Viability, cytotoxicity and apoptosis was measured with ApoTox-GloTM Triplex Assay (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions using a SpectraMax MiniMaxTM 300 Imaging Cytometer.Confirmation of shRNA knockdown efficiency by SDS-PAGE and Western blotSDS-PAGE and Western blot protocols were described elsewhere (Renart et al., 1979; Towbin et al., 1979).Lyse 1 x 106 cells in 100-500 µl RIPA buffer in 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes.Measure protein concentration by DCTM Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to manufacturer’s instructions using a SpectraMax MiniMaxTM 300 Imaging Cytometer.Load PageRulerTM protein ladder in one lane and the other lanes equal amounts of protein from the cell lysates on 6-15% SDS gels (depending on the size of the protein) and electrophorese at 200 V for 1 h to separate the proteins. The expected size in kDa and the appropriate % of acrylamide for each protein are: BRD2, 110 kDa, 8%; BRD4, 171 kDa, 6.5%; Cyclin T1, 87 kDa, 8%; α-Tubulin, 50 kDa, 10%.",
    "Since the kDa of the proteins are so different the membranes can be cut to check for equal loading by incubation with α-Tubulin antibody.Transfer the separated proteins to the nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN® Electrophoresis System at 100 mA for 1-3 h or at 35 mA overnight (for proteins larger than 120 kDa).Block the transferred proteins on the membranes in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker.Incubate the membranes with primary antibodies diluted (BRD2 1:1,000; BRD4 1 µg/ml; Cyclin T1 1:1,000; α-Tubulin 1:2,000) in TBS-T buffer over night at 4 °C on a rocker.Wash the membranes three times for approximately 5 min each time with TBS-T buffer and incubate with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted 1:10,000 in TBS-T buffer, for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker.Wash the membranes three times for approximately 5 min each time with TBS-T buffer and incubate for 30 sec in Lumi-light Western blotting substrate.Develop on chemiluminescence films, expose the films for 10 sec up to 30 min. Depending on if the antibody has been reused and how many times it has been reused the signal will appear weaker, but cleaner (fewer background bands)."
