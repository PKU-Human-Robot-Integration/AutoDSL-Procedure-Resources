    "1. Self-Assembling Peptide Scaffold (SAPS) Preparation\nPrepare a 0.5% solution of peptide RAD16-I in 20% (w/v) sucrose, in a micro-centrifuge tube. Sonicate the peptide solution for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath at maximum power and at room temperature (RT) to ensure homogeneous mixing.\n\tNOTE: The volume of solution to be prepared will depend on the number of encapsulations desired. RAD16-I peptides do not suffer degradation under these sonication conditions.\nDilute the peptide solution prepared in step 1.1 with the necessary volume of 10% (w/v) sucrose to obtain the desired final concentration.\n\tNOTE: An important factor to take into consideration is the adjustment of the initial peptide concentration since the final matrix stiffness will depend on this parameter. The RAD16-I peptide solution should be 2x more concentrated than the desired final concentration of the 3D construct. Normally, the final RAD16-I peptide concentrations used are between 0.15–0.5% (w/v).\nPlace the micro-centrifuge tube containing the peptide solution into an ultrasonic bath at RT for 20 min to ensure homogeneous mixing.\n\tNOTE: The peptide solution, if not used immediately, can be stored for several months at 4 °C.\n2. Cell Suspension Preparation\nCentrifuge the cell suspension (obtained after trypsin treatment) at 60 x g and RT for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant using a Pasteur pipette connected to a vacuum line and suspend the cell pellet in 3–5 mL of 10% (w/v) sucrose using a micropipette. Proceed to count cells using a manual or automatic cell counter.\n\tNOTE: The 10% (w/v) sucrose solution is an isotonic and non-ionic medium that allows for cell maintenance and avoids peptide gelation during the mixing process.",
    "Centrifuge the cell suspension at 60 x g and RT for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and suspend the cell pellet again in the necessary volume of 10% (w/v) sucrose to obtain double the desired final cell concentration (recommendable approximately 4 x 106 cells/mL).\nPlace a desired number of tissue culture inserts in each well of a 6-well plate (one insert per encapsulation).\nSonicate the peptide solution prepared in step 1 at maximum power and RT for 5 min.\nPipette and place 40 µL of the cell suspension (obtained in 2.3) for each encapsulation desired plus approximately 10–15% of extra volume into a standard micro-centrifuge tube.\n3. 3D Cell Encapsulation into SAPS\nMix an equal volume of the RAD16-I solution in 10% sucrose (w/v) (40 µL per encapsulation) with an equal volume of the cell suspension (40 µL per encapsulation) prepared in step 2 to obtain a suspension of cells in the desired peptide concentration (in 10% sucrose). Mix by pipetting slowly up and down approximately 10 times. Avoid bubble formation during mixing.\n\tNOTE: This step is critical and must be performed very carefully since cells are under hostile conditions due to the low pH peptide (approximately 3.5–4.0).\nUsing a micropipette, carefully load 80 µL of the suspension into each insert.\nAdd 0.5 mL of culture media to the bottom of the well to wet the insert membrane, allowing media diffusion to promote peptide self-assembly and hydrogel formation. Let the peptide gel for approximately 20 min in the flow cabinet.\n\tNOTE: The manipulation of the samples during setting time could end in gel breaking.\nVery slowly add 40 µL of medium to the insert and let it slide down the inner wall to the gel.\n\tNOTE: Normally, the loading of this volume should take between 20–30 s.",
    "Place the plate in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere) for 20 min. This step and successive medium additions will favor leaching of the sucrose and equilibration of cells with culture medium.\nAdd 60 µL of medium to the inner wall of the insert, allowing it to flow down the wall. Aspirate the medium of the well, which is rich in sucrose, and add 0.5 mL of fresh medium.\nAdd 60 µL of medium slowly to the insert and place the plate in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere) for 10 min.\nAspirate the medium of the well and add 2.5 mL of fresh medium into the well. Add 200 µL of medium into the insert. Place the plate in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere) to maintain the cells under the appropriate conditions.\nChange the medium every day. Remove the old medium from the bottom of the well. Add 2.5 mL of fresh medium to the well and 200 µL to the insert.\n\tNOTE: If cell differentiation continues, the specific inducing media will be added to the cultures, resulting in the desired cell type commitment (see below, Cell differentiation).\n4. Cell Viability in 3D-SAPS\nNOTE: The cell viability assay is known as the Live/Dead — Viability/Cytotoxicity assay as well.\nIn a 15 mL tube, prepare the necessary volume of a fresh solution of 2 µM calcein AM and 2 µM of ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) in PBS by vortexing for 10 s. Keep in the dark.\n\tNOTE: The volume to be used for each sample will depend on the well size according to the following: 2 mL for each well of a 6-multiwell plate; 1 mL for each well of a 12-multiwell plate and 0.5 mL for each well of a 24-multiwell plate.",
    "Using a micropipette, rinse the 3D-SAPS samples 3 times with 2 mL of PBS, and then, cover it with the solution prepared in step 4.1. Incubate it at RT for 40 min in the dark.\nUsing a micropipette, rinse the constructs with 2 mL of PBS 5 times.\nVisualize the samples under a fluorescence microscope using 10X or 20X magnification.\n5. Cell Differentiation\nCulture cells (37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere) in Chondrocyte Basal Medium (CBM) with growth supplements.\n\tNOTE: The preparation of the medium is described in the manufacturers' instructions (See Materials Table).\nInduce cell differentiation at day 2 with chondrogenic medium containing recombinant human transforming growth factor-b1 [TGFb1] (10 ng/mL), L-Ascorbic Acid 2-phosphate [AA2P] (25 µg/mL) and Dexamethasone (100 nM).\nMaintain the culture for 4 weeks in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change chondrogenic medium every other day.\n6. Toluidine Blue (TB) Staining\nWash the 3D-SAPS cultures twice by adding and then removing 2 mL of PBS with a micropipette. Fix them by adding 2 mL of 2% (w/v) p-formaldehyde in PBS for 2 h at RT.\nWash twice with 2 mL of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST).\nIncubate with 2 mL of 0.05% TB in water for 20 min at RT.\nWash several times (at least 3 times) with 2 mL of PBS until the PBS solution removed is clear.\nAnalyze samples by visual inspection under a stereoscopic microscope11,13,14.\n\tNOTE: TB forms complexes with anionic glycoconjugates at the extracellular matrix, such as proteoglycans (PG) and glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which are mainly secreted by chondrocyte-like cells. Positive samples are stained blue.\n7. Western Blot\nNOTE: The procedure used in this protocol was previously described in reference11.\nLyse 3D-constructs in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail by pipetting.",
    "Prepare acrylamide gel according to gel-volume requirements (of the specific gel running equipment) and run the cell lysates for 90 min at 150 V16.\n\tNOTE: Acrylamide gel is usually prepared at a concentration of 7.5–10% (w/v), depending on the protein's molecular weight.\nTransfer the proteins contained in the gel into a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane by applying 40 V for 2 h at RT.\nIncubate the PVDF membrane at RT for 2 h in blocking buffer (4% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk in PBST) in a separate container with enough volume to cover the membrane.\nIncubate the membrane at RT for 1 h with primary antibodies at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL in PBST. See Materials Table.\nAdd secondary antibodies at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. See the Materials Table.\nPrepare the membrane for hP detection with a Chemiluminescent substrate16. See Materials Table.\nTake chemiluminescent images16."
