    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare hPSCs and overgrown plates of OP9 stroma\nTiming: 8–12 days\nWhole hPSC colonies are harvested and co-cultured on overgrown OP9 stroma for 10 days. During this time differentiation is directed towards mesodermal and later hematopoietic-competent endothelial progenitors. At day 10, CD34+ cells are harvested and co-cultured for a further 21 days on MS5 stroma in media supplemented with lymphomyeloid cytokines.\nNote: Whilst hPSCs can be readily differentiated into many other hematopoietic linages, achieving B cell differentiation is more challenging. It remains unclear to us as to whether this reflects to some unique aspect of B cell biology, or some as yet undefined aspect of the protocol. When establishing this technique we therefore stress the importance of careful validation of reagents and strict adherence to protocol.\nOvergrow OP9 cultures.\nOn day 4 after seeding remove 5 mL of media from OP9 plates to be used for differentiation and replace with 5 mL fresh, warm OP9-M media.\nThe ideal timing to add hPSCs to OP9 is day 8 after seeding, but this can be extended to 10–12 days if stromal morphology remains robust. 5 mL off/on media changes should be performed every 4 days.\nPrepare hPSCs for harvest.\nPassage hPSCs 3–5 days in advance of harvest for use on OP9 at such a density as to provide large undifferentiated colonies.\nContinue to feed with StemFit media daily or according to recommendation by manufacturer.\nHarvest hPSCs and seed onto overgrown plates of OP9 stroma",
    "hPSCs are harvested, ideally as whole colonies or large clumps, washed and seeded onto overgrown OP9 in OP9-differentiation (OP9-D) media. The schedule of feeding of these co-cultures is critical and adhering to the timings stated here is highly recommended. During 10 days of co-culture, a series of characteristic morphological changes are observed as indicated in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4D.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/563-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Morphological changes during hPSC-OP9 coculture\n(A) Morphology of overgrown OP9 stroma at 8 days post passage, ready to be seeded with hPSCs.\n(B) Early hPSC (MIFF3) colony growing on OP9 stroma (day 2 of co-culture).\n(C) hPSC (MIFF3) colony starting to differentiate on OP9 stroma (day 7 of co-culture).\n(D) Differentiated hPSCs (MIFF3) at day 10 of OP9 stroma co-culture at time of harvest.\nMicroscope Olympus, CKX53. Scale bars were added using ImageJ software.\nHarvest hPSCs as whole colonies using collagenase.\nAim to harvest between 1.5-2×106 hPSCs (1–3 wells of a 6 well plate) per 10 cm dish of OP9.\nNote: In our experience the surface area of OP9 used rather than the number of hPSCs added is the principal determinant of CD34+ cell yield.\nPrepare fresh collagenase IV solution in DMEM/F12 basal media and warm to 37°C.\nRemove StemFit media and replace with 1 mL of warmed collagenase IV.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30–90 mins until colonies start to detach.\nNote: Some manual agitation of the plate can assist during this time, but every effort should be made to prevent break up of colonies.\nOnce the majority of colonies are detaching, use OP9-D media to gently wash whole hPSC colonies/clumps from the well into a 50 mL conical tube using a serological pipette.\nThe colonies are washed 3 times in 10 mL OP9-D media by gravity alone.",
    "Critical: Do not pellet by centrifugation as this results in break-up of colony structure.\nRemove OP9-M media from overgrown OP9 plate and add 5 mL OP9-D media\nAfter the final wash, hPSC colonies are gently resuspended in 5 mL OP9-D media and transferred to the overgrown OP9 plate using a 10 mL serological pipette.\nEnsure that colonies are evenly distributed across the available surface area by gentle agitation.\nFeed OP9-hPSC co-cultures.\nDay 1: Gently swirl plate, remove all media and hPSC cell debris and gently replace with 20 mL OP9-D media, taking care not to detach the stromal layer.\nDay 4: Exchange 10 mL off/on OP9-D media.\nDay 6: Exchange 10 mL off/on OP9-D media.\nDay 8: Exchange 10 mL off/on OP9-D media.\nHarvest hPSC-derived CD34+ cells and seed onto MS5\nDay 9: Prepare 6 well plates of MS5 stroma.\nPre-gelatinize (porcine gelatin 0.1%w/v) the required number of wells of a 6 well plate for a minimum of 2 h prior to seeding MS5.\nHarvest and count MS5 cells as per maintenance protocol above.\nSeed up to 2×105 MS5 cells per well of a 6 well plate in MS5-M media.\nNote: At the time of seeding the MS5 are approaching confluency. We have not found it necessary to mitotically inactivate MS5.\nDay 10: Disassociate OP9-hPSC co-culture by collagenase and trypsin digest.\nNote: By day 10 colony morphology should represent that shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D. Some degree of background adiposity (<20%) of the OP9 stroma is to be expected by this time.\nPrepare and warm fresh collagenase IV and trypsin according to description in Materials and Equipment section.\nRemove all media from the OP9-hPSC plate to a 50 mL conical tube on ice.",
    "Optional: If more than one plate is being harvested, pellet any non-adherent cells in the used media by centrifugation at 300g for 5min and discard supernatant. The disassociated stroma harvested in step 6k can be added to this pellet, thus collecting both adherent and non-adherent cells present in the co-culture.\nAdd 7 mL warmed collagenase IV 1 mg/mL in DMEM/F12 and incubate at 37°C for 25 min. Gently swirl the collagenase to wash off residual serum-containing media.\nCritical: The use of collagenase is the only wash-step prior to adding trypsin. For the trypsin not to be inhibited by residual FBS it is essential to remove all media carefully and swirl the collagenase to wash residual serum from the tissue culture plate.\nCarefully remove and discard collagenase, avoiding losing cellular material or detaching the stromal layer.\nNote: Take care not to discard cellular debris after the collagenase wash. We do not collect collagenase-containing media to reduce exposure of cells to enzyme.\nAdd 7 mL freshly prepared 0.05% trypsin/5 mM EDTA.\nIn order to prevent the stromal layer detaching en-bloc into an indigestible ball, score the stromal matrix orthogonally into approximately 1 cm2 sections using a 1 mL micropipette tip.\nIncubate at 37°C.\nAgitate the plate intermittently during incubation to facilitate trypsin exposure to the underside of the stromal layer.\nAfter 3–7 min use a 10 mL serological pipette to titurate the stroma, before quenching trypsin with 7 mL OP9-D media.\nFurther titurate with a 1 mL pipette to break up clumps.\nCollect the cellular material into the 50 mL conical tube used in step 6b though a 40–70 μm nylon filter (pre-wetted with MACS buffer).\nWash the plate with 5 mL MACS buffer and add to 50 mL conical tube through the 40–70 μm nylon filter.",
    "Wash the filter twice with 1 mL MACS buffer.\nDiscard the filter and pellet cells by centrifugation at 300 g for 5min.\nMagnetic separation of CD34+ cells.\nResuspend cell pellet in 300 μL chilled MACS buffer.\nIncubate with 100 μL Fc receptor block for 5 min on ice.\nAdd 100 μL anti-CD34 MACS beads and incubate at 4°C for 30 min on a rotator.\nLoad Miltenyi LS MACS column into magnet holder, insert 30–50 μm sterile filter and place over a collection tube/reservoir.\nOptional: Flow through can be retained and analyzed by flow cytometry to estimate the relative CD34+ enrichment (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/563-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. MACS enrichment of CD34+ cells\nCells were harvested after OP9 culture on day 10 and enriched for hematopoietic progenitors using CD34 MACS beads. Cells in the CD34 positive and CD34 negative fraction were then stained for CD34 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were gated for singlets, viability, and scatter profile. Histogram shows cells that express CD34 in the negative (gray) and positive (red) fraction respectively. After successful enrichment over 95% of the enriched cells are CD34+ and fewer than 5% CD34+ cells can be recovered from the CD34 depleted fraction.\nPrime column with 3 mL of chilled MACS buffer.\nAfter incubation wash cells with 5 mL chilled MACS buffer, centrifuge at 300 g 4°C for 5 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL chilled MACS buffer and add to the MACS LS column through the cell strainer.\nOnce the column stops dripping, wash with 3 mL chilled MACS buffer.\nWhen the column stops dripping, repeat 3 mL wash to a total of 3 washes.",
    "Remove the column from the magnet, discard the strainer and extract the cells by applying 5 mL chilled MACS buffer and rapid plunging the enriched cells into a fresh 15 mL conical tube. Repeat once more with 3 mL buffer to increase the yield of CD34+ cells.\nCentrifuge enriched cells at 300 g for 5 min.\nResuspend the CD34-enriched pellet in 0.5 mL OP9-D media and count cells using a hemocytometer counterstained with Trypan blue. CD34+ cells are small, phase-bright or phase-neutral. Exclude dead (blue) or very large, phase-bright stromal cells from the cell count estimation.\nCritical: The production of CD34+CD43+CD45+ hematopoietic progenitors by day 10 of co-culture is a pre-requisite for later B cell potential and therefore careful assessment of day 10 intermediate progenitors is essential when establishing this protocol. In our experience the presence of a small population of CD34+CD45RA+IL7R+ progenitors at day 10 is associated with robust B cell differentiation during subsequent MS5 co-culture (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). The quality of OP9 stroma and batch of the serum used are the most critical aspects of this part of the protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/563-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Flow cytometry analysis from day 10 of co-culture\nCells were harvested after OP9 culture on day 10, enriched for CD34 and stained for surface markers. Cells were gated for singlets, viability, and scatter profile (top row) and then for CD43 expression (middle right). Of the 7AAD-CD43+ emerging hematopoietic cells, a small fraction (about 1.6% in this experiment) co-express IL7R and CD45RA (middle center). In the histograms, expression of the hematopoietic-endothelial markers CD31 and CD34 and the pan-hematopoietic (CD45) and myeloid (CD33) markers within the 7AAD-CD43+ fraction are shown. We find that about 75% of the enriched cells express the early hematopoietic marker CD43. Percentages presented are of total 7AAD-CD43+ cells.",
    "Optional: When establishing this protocol, we recommend staining for the presence of hematopoietic progenitors at day 10.\nNote: After this first part of the protocol harvested cells can be further cultured to generate myeloid cells as described in (Choi et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nFlow cytometry of hPSC-derived CD34+ cells\nTake an aliquot of the CD34-enriched fraction for staining. There is no need to add more Fc blocking as this was done in step 7b.\nStain according to protocol below (step 15). Suggested antibodies are listed in Materials and Equipment section and typical results shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nNote: Trypsin/collagenase exposure may destroy surface antigens. See troubleshooting section.\nLympho-myeloid differentiation of hPSC-derived CD34 cells by MS5 co-culture\nPrepare sufficient OP9-D media with 2× final cytokine concentrations for the number of CD34 cells harvested.\nFinal cytokine concentration: hIL3 10 ng/mL, hIL7 20 ng/mL, hFlt3L 50 ng/mL, hSCF 50 ng/mL.\nRemove MS5-M media from 6 well plate.\nAdd 1 mL per well of 2× cytokine containing OP9-D media to MS5 on a 6 well plate.\nDilute CD34+ cell pellet such as to add 12.5–50×103 CD34-enriched cells per well of MS5 on a 6 well plate in 1 mL OP9-D media. Final volume is 2 mL/well with 1× final cytokine concentration.\nOn day 17 of culture (day 7 on MS5) add 2 mL OP9-D media containing 1× cytokines: hIL7 20 ng/mL, hFlt3L 50 ng/mL, hSCF 50 ng/mL (final concentration). Final volume is 4 mL/well with 1× final cytokine concentration (excluding IL-3).",
    "On day 24 of culture (day 14 on MS5) carefully remove up to 2 mL (accounting for evaporation – i.e., leaving 2 mL residual media) of media and replace with fresh OP9-D media supplemented with 1× cytokines: hIL7 20 ng/mL, hFlt3L 50 ng/mL, hSCF 50 ng/mL (final concentration). Final volume is 4 mL/well with 1× final cytokine concentration (excluding IL-3).\nNote: At this stage non-adherent hematopoietic cells should be clearly visible in the center of the well; it is therefore advisable to take media from the edge of the well. If significant numbers of non-adherent cells are removed, centrifuge the media at 300g for 5 min and reseed the pellet into the initial well in the fresh OP9-D media supplemented with cytokines as above.\nNote: Small numbers of CD34+CD19+ proB cells are usually detectable by day 24 of culture (after 14 days on MS5)\nOn day 31 (27–33) harvest cells for analysis. Small hematopoietic cells can now be seen floating in the media as per Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/563-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Morphology after three weeks of MS5 co-culture\nMS5 co-culture with hematopoietic cells one day before harvest. Small, phase bright hematopoietic cells are seen floating in the media. The MS5 stroma can be seen in the background.\nMicroscope Olympus, CKX53. Scale bars were added using ImageJ software.\nUse a cell scraper to mechanically detach stroma and titurate with a 1 mL micropipette into a single cell suspension.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 g for 5min and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in 50 μL Fc receptor block and incubate for 10 min at 4°C, aiming for a total 100 μL final staining volume. This may need to be increased if large numbers of cells are stained.",
    "Stain for surface markers according to step 15. Suggested antibodies are listed in the Materials and Equipment section.\nAnalyze or flow sort cells for further analysis.\nNote: By day 31 the MS5 stroma usually detaches easily and enzymatic treatment with collagenase is generally unnecessary and can affect the detection of some antigens by flow cytometry.\nNote: By day 31 fewer primitive CD34+ progenitor and proB cells are present. If specific lymphoid progenitor populations are required harvesting earlier may be an advantage.\nFlow cytometric analysis (at day 10 to 31 of culture)\nCells are harvested at day 10 to 31 (from day 24–31 for B cells) of culture and stained with surface markers for analysis or sorting on a flow cytometer.\nMake antibody staining cocktail with 2× concentrated antibodies in MACS buffer.\nInclude unstained cells and fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls for all colors. A stroma only control is also recommended as the stroma may give high background.\nMix equal volume of 2× staining cocktail and Fc receptor blocked cells.\nStain in the dark on a shaker for 40 min at 4°C.\nWash with 1 mL of MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min.\nResuspend in MACS buffer containing 1× viability dye.\nSet up the flow cytometry with single stained beads and cells stained with only viability marker.\nSuggested antibody cocktails are listed in Materials and Equipment section and expected results can be seen in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] (day 10) and Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8] (day 31).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/563-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Flow cytometry analysis from approximately day 31 of co-culture\nCells were harvested after 3 weeks of MS5 co-culture and stained for surface markers.",
    "(A) Cells were gated for singlets and scatter and then for viability (7AAD) and CD45 expression as indicated in the figure (top panel). Expression of CD19 and CD34 is shown within the 7AAD-CD45+ fraction (second panel, left). The CD19 positive fraction is further gated for expression of CD10 and CD20 (right). Counting beads were used in this experiment and can be seen in the scatter plot in the top middle panel.\n(B) Cells were gated for singlets and scatter (as in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A, plots not shown). Contour plot of viability (7AAD) and CD45 expression as shown in the figure (left). Further gating on 7AAD-CD45+ cells for B lymphoid (CD19) and, within the CD19- gate, myeloid (CD11b and CD14) markers are shown to the right.\nNote: We recommend that you titrate the antibodies to find optimal concentration for your staining.\nNote: Staining volume needs to be adjusted to number of cells.\nNote: MS5 stroma may give a high background staining; we suggest growing and staining MS5 stroma with no hematopoietic cells as a control. We use anti-human CD45 to specifically gate on the hPSC-derived blood cells and exclude stroma that are of mouse origin.\nNote: Our staining suggestion was done on a BD Fortessa X20 or BD Aria III according to configuration in Materials and Equipment section. For cell sorting we recommend using 100μm nozzle to minimize mechanical stress on the cells.\nExpected outcomes",
    "At day 10 of the protocol hematopoietic progenitors can be harvested, identifiable by expression of the early hematopoietic marker CD43 and the later pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 (Carpenter et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Vodyanik et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). In our hands, about 70%–80% of the CD34-enriched fraction express CD43 (Vodyanik et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and of these approximately 40% also express CD45. A small fraction of cells (usually ≥0.5% of CD43+) express the lymphoid IL7R surface marker (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nB cells emerge upon further co-culture on MS5; in our experience CD34+CD19+ proB cells can be detected after about 2 weeks of MS-5 culture, but kinetics may differ between different hPSC lines. After three weeks of MS5 culture (31 days total) more mature CD19+ preB cells emerge; these have lost expression of CD34 and homogenously express CD10 and CD20 (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). Surface IgM expression is not detected (data not shown)."
