    "C. elegans media preparationPrepare NGM media (see Recipes) in a 1 L flask (see Note 1).Cover and seal the opening of the flask with two layers of aluminum foil, use a short stretch (2 cm) of autoclave tape to mark on top of aluminum foil.Autoclave NGM media, MgSO4, CaCl2 and KPI solutions (see Recipes) (see Note 2).Cool media to ~65 °C and add MgSO4, CaCl2, KPI, cholesterol (see Recipes) (see Note 3).For regular NGM agar plates: pour 20 ml media into each 90 mm Petri dish.For RNAi NGM agar plates: pour 20 ml media (supplemented with carbenicillin, tetracycline and IPTG [(see Recipes)] into each 90 mm Petri dish.Allow agar plates to solidify and dry overnight in a lamina flow hood at room temperature (see Note 4).Inoculate a single bacterial colony of OP50 or HT115(DE3) to 1 ml of LB (for HT115(DE3): 200 μg/ml ampicillin was supplemented) (see Recipes) in a sterilized polypropylene round-bottom tube and grow for 6 h at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm).Inoculate 1 ml of bacterial culture to 300 ml of autoclaved LB in a 1 L flask and grow for 16 h at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm).Harvest the overnight culture in 250 ml centrifuge bottles (Nalgene) by centrifugation (4,000 x g, 20 min, 4 °C) (Beckman Coulter, Avanti J-26 XP), discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet with fresh LB to a final volume = 7.5 ml (see Note 5). Seed each regular NGM agar plate with 300 µl concentrated E. coli OP50 culture and spread with a sterilized stainless steel spreader (see Note 6).Seed each RNAi NGM agar plate with 300 µl concentrated E. coli HT115(DE3) culture supplemented with 200 µg/ml ampicillin and spread with a sterilized stainless steel spreader.",
    "Allow bacteria-seeded plates to dry overnight in a lamina flow hood at room temperature (see Note 7).C. elegans cultureUse a sterilized surgical blade (passing over the flame of burner) to cut a small chunk of agar (chunking) from OP50 seeded-NGM agar plate containing larvae worms and transfer the chunk of agar to fresh OP50 seeded-NGM agar plate (see Note 8).Propagate the worms at 20 °C until sufficient gravid adults from offspring are obtained. Harvest gravid adults by washing the plates with autoclaved ultrawater and collect into a 15 ml centrifuge tube (see Note 9).Allow the worms settle and then remove the supernatant by aspiration.Perform hypochlorite bleach by adding 3.5 ml autoclaved ultrawater to resuspend the pellet.Add 0.5 ml of 5 N NaOH.Add 1 ml of 5% NaOCl (Bleach), total volume in the tube is 5 ml.Vortex the tube briefly and leave at room temperature for less than 5 min, vortex 5 sec every few minutes until the majority (80%) of worms are dissolved (observed under dissecting microscope).Immediately add 8 ml autoclaved ultrawater and invert the tube 5 times for mixing thoroughly.Centrifuge at 1,258 x g (Eppendorf, 5810 R) for 1 min and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet with 10 ml autoclaved ultrawater and invert the tube 5 times. Centrifuge again at 1,258 x g for 1 min (Eppendorf, 5810 R), discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet (eggs) with 2 ml M9 buffer.Incubate the egg suspension at 20 °C overnight with shaking (50 rpm) to obtain synchronized L1 worms.Aliquots L1 worms to RNAi NGM agar plates (see Note 10).Incubate the plates at 20 °C for 3 days to obtain Mock and G6PD-knockdown (Gi) adult worms (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170912/20170912183232_5657.jpgFigure 1.

    "B. Washed eggs harvested in a 15 ml tube (as a pellet) from 5 NGM plates; C. Eggs filtered by Falcon cell-strainer cap; D. Washed eggs transferred to a microcentrifuge tube; E. Egg suspended in ultrawater after Sonication I (see step D2); F. Folch solution added to lysate in a glass tube; G. Initial phase separation formed after vortex and Sonication II (see step D7); H. Enhanced phase separation after centrifugation.C. elegans sample preparationFour biological replicates of C. elegans gravid adults (see Note 11) are washed off from NGM plates by ultrawater (see Note 12). Place the 15 ml centrifuge tube on an ice bucket (see Note 13).Allow the worms to settle and remove the supernatant. Add 10 ml ultrawater to wash worms. Repeat this step to completely remove floating bacteria and eggs in the suspension.Perform hypochlorite bleach as described in previous section (steps B5-B11) (see Note 14).Centrifuge the tube at 1,258 x g for 1 min (Eppendorf, 5810 R), discard supernatant (Figure 1B). Add 1 ml ultrawater to suspend the eggs and keep the tube on ice. To filter the eggs, add 0.1 ml ultrawater to the top of Falcon cell-strainer cap to equilibrate the membrane.Once water is eluted from the membrane, transfer the egg suspension to the top of Falcon cell-strainer cap and allow to elute by gravity (Figure 1C).Add 1 ml ultrawater to wash the membrane.Centrifuge the tube at 1,258 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf, 5810 R). Discard the supernatant and the cap.Add 1 ml ultrawater to the tube and transfer the suspension to a microcentrifuge tube.Add additional 0.1 ml ultrawater to wash the tube and pool all suspension together in a microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge the microcentrifuge tube at 1,258 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf, 5810 R).",
    "Aspirate the supernatant carefully (Figure 1D).Store the pellet in a -80 °C freezer until use (see Note 15).Lipid extractionThaw the pellet on ice and resuspend with 0.5 ml ultrawater.Perform sonication with samples (tube) being placed in a 100 ml glass beaker filled with ice. The sonication cycle is set at 2 sec pulse (frequency: 20 kHz; amplitude: 10%) and 5 sec interval, 20 cycles, total 40 sec (Sonicate I, Figure 1E).Transfer the supernatants to glass tubes with screw cap.Perform Folch extraction by adding 1 ml ultrawater to each glass tube, followed by adding 6 ml of chloroform/methanol (ratio = 2:1) mixture to each glass tube (see Note 16).Vortex each glass tube for 30 sec, repeated 4 times (see Note 17) (Figure 1F).Place the glass tubes on a test tube rack in an ultrasonic cleaner pre-filled with ice and water, sonicate the samples for 15 min (frequency: 40 kHz) (see Note 18) (Sonicate II, Figure 1G)Centrifuge the tubes at 1,258 x g for 15 min (Eppendorf, 5810 R) to further enhance phase separation (Figure 1H).Transfer the lower fraction (hydrophobic) to a clean glass tube by a glass Pasteur pipette (see Notes 19 and 20).Dry the lower fraction under nitrogen flow in a nitrogen evaporator (see Note 21).Store the dried pellet in a -80 °C freezer until use.Lipidomic analysis (see Note 22) (steps of lipidomic data analysis are summarized in Figure 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170912/20170912183559_9757.jpgFigure 2. Summary of steps in lipidomic data analysis. A flow chart from sample separation to metabolites by tandem MS is presented.Add 1,000 μl solvent (isopropanol/acetonitrile/water, 2/1/1, v/v/v) to the lower fraction. Vortex the glass tube for 30 sec, repeat 4 times.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube (organic solvent-resistant) by using organic solvent-resistant tips and centrifuge at 15,294 x g for 15 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf, 5427 R). Transfer 800 μl supernatant to the HPLC vial for UPLC-qTOF/MS analysis. Each sample is carried out in three technical replicates for lipidomic profiling. Prepare mobile phase A (water:acetonitrile [60:40] supplemented with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid).Prepare mobile phase B (isopropanol:acetonitrile [90:10] with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid). Samples are injected and separated by using Acquity CSH C18 column.The column temperature is maintained at 55 °C, the flow rate is set at 0.4 ml/min.The solvent gradient is as follows: 0-2 min, 40-43% solvent B; 2-2.1 min, 43-50% solvent B; 2.1-12 min, 50-54% solvent B; 12-12.1 min, 54-70% solvent B; 12.1-18 min, 70-99% solvent B; 18-20 min, 99-40% solvent B.An injected volume of 1.5 μl sample is used in electrospray ionization (ESI) positive (+) mode, and 3 μl sample was used in ESI negative (-) mode (see Note 23).Mass spectrometric analysis is performed in both ESI+ and ESI- modes using the SYNAPT G1 HDMS system. The major parameter settings are as follows: The capillary and cone voltage are set at 3,000 V (2,000 V in ESI- mode) and 30 V, respectively. The desolvation gas flow rate is set at 800 L/h. The desolvation and source temperatures are 400 and 100 °C, respectively.Chromatograms are acquired over a range of m/z of 20-990 Da at a rate of 10 scans per second (see Note 24) (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170912/20170912183651_2458.jpgFigure 3.
