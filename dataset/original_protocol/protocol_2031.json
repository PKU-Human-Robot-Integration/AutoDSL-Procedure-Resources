    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInjection of Oxyphor 2P\nTiming: 10–15 min\nThis section describes two different methods of injection of the probe: intravenous injection for vascular imaging and cisterna magna injection for intravascular and extravascular imaging.\nThe choice of the probe delivery route determines the site of the pO2 measurements. Intravascular injection is suitable for measurements in the vasculature. The easiest delivery route in this case is probably via the tail vein (see below). Injection into cisterna magna is technically more demanding, but it leads to the distribution of the probe throughout the interstitial space as well as the vasculature, therefore permitting extravascular and intravascular pO2 measurements.\nNote: If you are performing intravenous (i.v.) injection, proceed to steps 1–9. If you are performing injection into cisterna magna, proceed to steps 10–29.\nPause point: It has been shown previously that Oxyphor 2P delivered via cisterna magna injection remains in the brain tissue for several days (Esipova et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The optimal measurement time frames are 1–48 h for intravascular and 6–24 h for extravascular measurements post injection.\nInjection of Oxyphor 2P via the tail vein\nWeigh the mouse.\nCalculate the total blood plasma volume (TBV) of the animal. In mice, the TBV can vary between 63 and 80 mL/kg (Diehl et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Using the recommended mean value of 72 mL/kg, the blood plasma volume is found as:\n  T B V  [ μ L ]  = w  [ g ]  ⋅ 72  [ μ L / g ]  ,  \nwhere w is the weight of the animal in grams.",
    "Calculate the required volume of the stock solution of Oxyphor 2P (Vss) based on its concentration (css) and considering the desired final concentration of the probe in the blood (cb). We recommend the final concentration of 5 μM, in which case the volume is determined as:\n   V  s s    [ μ L ]  =   T B V  [ μ L ]  ⋅  c b    c  s s    =   T B V  [ μ L ]  ⋅ 5  μ M   250  μ M   =   T B V  [ μ L ]   50   \nUsing aqueous NaCl (0.9%), dilute the stock solution of volume Vss to the final volume of 50 μL.\nNote: It is easier to inject larger volumes, considering that injection needs to be performed gradually at a constant speed. However, injecting too much solution can harm the animal (Diehl et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). 50 μL is a convenient compromise.\nFill a syringe with the prepared solution of Oxyphor 2P. For i.v. injections use a 30G needle.\nCritical: Avoid having air bubbles in the syringe.\nAnaesthetize the animal with isoflurane (4% induction in an oxygen/air mixture (30%/70%)).\nPlace the mouse on a heating blanket and reduce the isoflurane concentration to 1.5%–2%.\nWarm up the tail using warm water (about 40°C–45°C) or a heating lamp to dilate the tail vein (duration of warming: ∼30–45 s).\nCritical: Do not overheat.\nOnce the vein is clearly visible, align the needle parallel to the tail vein with the needle bevel facing up and insert the needle into the vein in the direction of the animal and inject the solution at a rate of ∼300 μL/min.",
    "Note: If the needle missed the vein, the injected solution, which is deep green in color, will localize near the injection site and will not distribute throughout the vascular system. The injection will need to be repeated in a location more proximal to the animal body.\nNote: Upon successful injection, Oxyphor 2P will distribute throughout the vascular system within seconds. Imaging can be performed for several hours after injection.\nAlternatives: Intravascular delivery can be performed via other vascular access routes (e.g., retro-orbital injection or injection into the femoral vein (requires catheterization)).\nInjection of Oxyphor 2P via cisterna magna\nThe protocol for intracisternal injections follows Ueda et al. and Furlan et al. (Ueda et al., 1979[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]; Furlan et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: The injection is best performed by two people: one person inserts the needle, another performs the injection.\nUsing tweezers, extract the metal cannula from a 26G syringe needle, removing the plastic adapter for attachment to the syringe.\nDraw a mark on the needle stem 3–3.5 mm away from the tip.\nUse a large forceps to bend the needle at the mark, forming a hook. The bevel should face the inside of the hook (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1625-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cisterna magna injection through the intact skin\n(A) A needle hook made of a 26G needle.\n(B and C) Correct positioning of the mouse and puncture site for cisterna magna injection through the intact skin (pink area): Side view (B), Top view (C). The head is bent downward over the edge of a support box.\n(D) Schematic of the sagittal cross-section illustrates the correct placement of the needle for cisterns magna injection.\nDisinfect the hook by dipping it into aqueous ethanol (70%).\nRinse and flush the hook with Ringer solution.",
    "Connect the hook to a 45 cm-long polythene tubing (I.D. 0.28 mm, Smiths Medical).\nConnect the other side of the polythene tubing to a 10 μL syringe (Hamilton).\nFill the tubing with Ringer solution by drawing it in using the syringe.\nDraw in the solution of Oxyphor 2P for cisterna magna injection slightly in excess of the desired amount, e.g., 10.5–11 μL instead 10 μL.\nCritical: Allowing a small bubble of air between the Ringer solution in the tube and the solution of the Oxyphor 2P probe helps to prevent mixing of the solutions and makes it easier to visually detect the amount of injected volume. On the other hand, drawing in a slight excess of the solution of the probe helps to avoid unintentional injection of the air bubble into the animal.\nAnaesthetize the animal with isoflurane (4% in an oxygen/air (30%/70%) mixture for induction).\nPlace the mouse on a heating blanket and reduce the isoflurane concentration to 1.5%–2%.\nShave the neck region of the animal.\nPlace the animal on its abdomen on a support stage (e.g., a box from pipette tips, ∼12.4 × 8 × 6 cm, Width: 8.5 cm, Height: 6.2 cm) and bend its head downward over the edge of the box (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2D).\nBy placing the mouse’s nose into the isoflurane tube the head is secured in the head-down position and has not to be further fixed.\nCarefully fix the mouse body with surgical tape on the support stage.\nDefine the injection site (see the note below and Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2D).\nDisinfect the skin at the injection site (Kodan®).\nInject 10 μL of the probe solution at a constant rate of approximately 5 μL/min.",
    "Note: The needle needs to be inserted into the gap between the occiput and the atlas vertebra (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Direct the needle tip along the midline drawn from the back of the head toward the neck, holding the stem of the hook parallel to the surface of the occiput, until the hook meets the end of the occiput bone. Insertion of the needle into the gap between the occiput and atlas vertebra should be done without applying excessive force. After the insertion, the stem of the needle hook should be positioned close to the surface of the occiput. Any rotations or other movements of the needle should be avoided. (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2D).\nCritical: Stable positioning of the needle stem (close to the surface) is crucial for successful injection. Holding the needle with a forceps can help the injection. In case of a failed cisterna magna injection, the animal should be carefully monitored and if there are no signs of pain and distress the injection can be repeated in the same animal after 48 h.\nAfter completing the injection, keep the needle inserted for a few seconds before removing it.\nLet the animal wake up and wait for at least 45 min before imaging. The intermission serves as a recovery phase for the animal and allows for distribution of Oxyphor 2P throughout the interstitial space (Iliff et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: If you are performing imaging in anesthetized animals, proceed to steps 30–33. If you are performing imaging in awake animals, proceed to steps 34–36.\nPreparation for imaging of anaesthetized animals\nTiming: 5–10 min\nThis section describes animal preparation for imaging under isoflurane anaesthesia.\nAnaesthetize the animal with isoflurane (4% in an oxygen/air (30%/70%) mixture for induction).\nPlace the animal on a heating blanket and reduce the concentration of isoflurane to 1.5%–2%.",
    "Use a microbrush, aqueous ethanol (70%) and water to clean the cranial window of any deposits.\nPosition the animal under the microscope and fix it by its head post, leaving it on the heating blanket. Maintain the anesthesia at a reduced level (1.5%–2% isoflurane).\nCritical: During imaging the animal should breathe normal air (21% O2). Higher concentrations of O2 in the inhaled mixture could lead to abnormally high tissue pO2 values.\nCritical: Keep in mind that anesthesia can affect the brain oxygen levels. For example, isoflurane, which is a known vasodilator, can cause an increase in the brain tissue oxygenation (Lyons et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). For comparing different experiments, it is crucial to conduct them using the same anesthesia.\nPreparation for imaging in awake animals\nTiming: 5–10 min\nThis section describes animal preparation for awake imaging.\nPosition the animal under the microscope and carefully affix its head without inducing stress to the animal.\nUse a microbrush, aqueous ethanol (70%) and water to clean the cranial window of any deposits.\nAnaesthetize the animal with isoflurane (4% in an oxygen/air (30%/70%) mixture for induction).\nNote: Animals that undergo awake imaging don’t have to be anesthetized to clean the cranial window.",
    "Critical: It is important to ensure that the head post of the animal is well fixed head does not move during imaging, since movements in the imaging plane caused by animal locomotion or other type of activities (e.g., licking) can affect the spatial accuracy of the measured pO2 values. In case fixation is insufficient to completely eliminate motion artifacts, it might be useful to include a motion detector into the setup that would allow rejection of the data obtained during motion. Additional information on 2PLM in awake animals can be found in e.g., Şencan et al., Li et al. (Li et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Sencan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nImaging parameters\nThis section describes spectral and temporal parameters relevant to and optimal for oxygen imaging.\nThe imaging procedure starts with the defining a pattern of points in a selected plane. The laser beam will then step through these points to generate the oxygen image. In particular, on each point the laser beam will irradiate the sample for a fixed time (excitation gate) and then will be turned off for a longer time interval to allow for the collection of phosphorescence (phosphorescence collection period). This excitation/collection pattern is repeated for a selected number of cycles to increase the SNR. The details of the imaging procedure are provided below.\nThe following parameters are appropriate for imaging phosphorescence of Oxyphor 2P:\nExcitation gate:                    10 μs (800 fs pulses at 80 MHz repetition rate).\nPhosphorescence collection period:   260 μs.\nExcitation wavelength:              960 nm.\nEmission detection range:           740 nm < λ < 900 nm.\nNumber of cycles (M):               adjust to reach the desired SNR (see below).\nAlternatives: Other wavelengths can be used for excitation of Oxyphor 2P. For the spectral properties of Oxyphor 2P see Esipova et al. (Esipova et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nSelecting excitation power",
    "This section describes the theoretical background and control experiments for the choice of the excitation power for oxygen imaging.\nToo low excitation power will result in poor SNR, while using excessive power can overwhelm the detector, lower spatial resolution and possibly lead to tissue photodamage. It is advised to perform tests to define the power range appropriate for imaging on your particular microscope prior to performing the actual imaging experiments.\nDefinitions\nSignal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nIn the shot noise limit (photon counting detection) signal-to-noise ratio is calculated as:\n  S N R =  N  ,  \nwhere N is the total number of photons (counts) per phosphorescence decay. Note that N should not include the dark noise, i.e., the integral under the baseline B in the fitting equation (see Data Analysis). Photon counting noise is the lowest possible noise achievable in phosphorescence decay measurements. In non-photon counting systems noise levels are always higher, and they depend on the imaging equipment. When multiple decays are averaged, the SNR is still calculated from the total number of photons, i.e., using the sum of the decays.\nDetector linear range and saturation\nExcitation power should be adjusted such that during imaging the signal intensity does not exceed the limits specified by the detector manufacturer. In the case of photon counting detection using photomultipliers (PMTs), the acceptable count rates are frequently referred to as the PMT linear range (usually up to ∼106–107 counts/s). Within that range arrival of each individual photon is detected, while at higher signal intensities some photons may be missed, which will cause signal distortion and inaccurate determination of the phosphorescence lifetime.",
    "For non-photon counting systems the upper limit corresponds to a certain value of the detector photocurrent, which is specific for each type of hardware. Exceeding that limit similarly will lead to signal distortion and will result in systematic errors in the phosphorescence lifetime determination.\nIn the limit of very high light (phosphorescence) intensities, the detector’s signal becomes insensitive to further increases in the light levels - a phenomenon referred to as detector saturation (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B for an example of traces exhibiting detector saturation).\nDepending on the microscope system, the user may or may not be warned automatically by the imaging program if the detector’s linear range has been exceeded. It is advised to implement such control to avoid detector saturation during imaging and errors in pO2 quantification.\nEven when working within the detector’s linear range, using excessive excitation power may lead to the saturation of the probe’s triplet state within the diffraction-limited volume, leading to a decrease in spatial resolution. This phenomenon has been discussed previously (Sinks et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). In brief, the highest spatial resolution is achieved when the detected signal originates only from the probe excited within the smallest possible volume near the focal point, known as the diffraction-limited volume (Helmchen and Denk 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). For each imaging setup and object, there is an excitation power range within which only a fraction of the molecules in the diffraction-limited volume is excited, while almost no excitation occurs outside that volume’s boundaries. If the power exceeds that range, probe molecules outside the diffraction-limited volume become excited as well, and the imaging resolution degrades.",
    "A method to test whether the signal emanates exclusively from the diffraction-limited volume, or if this volume has been exceeded, consists of recording the dependence of the phosphorescence decay intensity on the excitation power. We recommend performing a power dependence test prior to conducting the actual imaging experiments, especially if these are your first 2PLM measurements with Oxyphor 2P. Once the appropriate power range for a given object type (e.g., mouse brain) has been identified, imaging of similar objects can proceed without repeating the test. However, the power dependence test should be repeated if imaging parameters (e.g., excitation gate duration) or components of the optical system (e.g., laser, objective lens, optical filters etc.) are changed.\nTo perform the power dependence test, follow the steps below:\nSelect a measurement location (e.g., within a blood vessel at a selected depth), set measurement parameters (see above) and record a phosphorescence decay using an arbitrary number of cycles M (e.g., M=5000) and the maximal acceptable excitation power Pmax (see Note below).\nAdjust the detector gain to maximize the signal, while ensuring that the entire trace is contained within the detector’s linear range (see definitions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5.1] above).\nAdjust M so that the SNR in the data is sufficiently high (e.g., SNR>60 in the case of photon-counting detection).\nRecord phosphorescence traces while decreasing the excitation power P stepwise in the range 0<P<Pmax, keeping all the other imaging parameters unchanged. 7–8 excitation power steps should be sufficient (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1625-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Power dependency tests",
    "(A) Example of phosphorescence traces acquired using progressively higher excitation powers. The yellow region corresponds to the excitation-ON phase in the trace (10 μs). The gray-shaded area marks additional 5 μs after the end of the excitation phase. These 5 μs of the data are removed from the decay to minimize the interference of the detector response function, which in some systems can be slow (microseconds).\n(B) Example of decay showing the removal of the first 15 μs, the baseline to be subtracted and the area used to calculate the signal for power dependency plots.\n(C) Double logarithmic plot of phosphorescence signal as function of exciting laser power for a sample with good SNR. At lower powers the slope of the fitting line is about 2, as expected for two-photon excitation (red line), while at higher powers the slope is reduced as effect of excitation saturation (green line).\n(D) Double logarithmic plot of phosphorescence signal as function of exciting laser power for a sample with poor SNR. At lower powers, the points are too affected by noise to obtain a reliable fit.\nSelect the sections of the signal traces corresponding to the phosphorescence decays (i.e., starting ∼5 μs after the end of the excitation pulse). Analyze the resulting phosphorescence decays (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]). Subtract the corresponding baseline terms (B) from each decay and calculate the areas (A) under the resulting decays without baselines (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Areas A represent the decay’s integrated intensities.\nPlot areas A as a function of the excitation power (P) in log/log coordinates (e.g., log(A) vs log(P), Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D). Choose the power region where the slope of the plot is ∼2.00 (1.95<slope<2.05). This region corresponds to the excitation within the diffraction-limited volume and to the maximal imaging resolution.",
    "Note: Working at higher powers will give more signal and boost the imaging speed, however at expense of imaging resolution. In practice, a compromise between the resolution and speed can be chosen depending on the concrete goal of the experiment.\nNote: Control of excitation power is implemented differently in different microscope systems. If the power is adjusted prior to the beam entering the microscope, it is recommended to measure the beam power by an optical power meter inserted in the optical path immediately before the microscope. In this case, the measured power will not match the actual incident power on the sample (after the objective), but will be proportional to its values, which is sufficient for the purpose of the power-dependence experiment. If power control is performed inside the microscope, power measurements might need to be performed after the microscope objective. Either way, power measurements should be performed with the gating device (Pockels cell or acousto-optical modulator) in the fully open position.\nNote: Typically, the maximal power Pmax is chosen based on the environmental considerations, i.e., to avoid overheating of the sample and to minimize phototoxicity. This parameter is specific for each imaging experiment and microscope/laser system. This subject has been addressed in a recent study (Wang and Xu 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23])).\nNote: At low excitation powers phosphorescence decays may exhibit low SNR, which will result in the power dependence plot being noisy and thus poorly defined (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D as an example). The corresponding portion of the plot should be discarded.\nVisualizing the vasculature\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section describes the procedures for visualizing the vasculature as spatial reference for the following oxygen imaging steps.",
    "A large (e.g., 100 × 100 μm) field of view image (or a 3D stack of images at different depths) of the vasculature provides a convenient reference framework for the selection of locations for oxygen measurements. The phosphorescence of Oxyphor 2P can be used as a source of contrast to identify the vasculature, particularly upon vascular injection of the probe. Upon cisterna magna injection, additional contrast, e.g., by FITC-dextran (i.v; 50 μL, 70 kDa, 10% in 0.9% NaCl, Sigma) might be needed.\nSet the excitation and emission wavelengths and image the brain using the regular scanning mode of the microscope, as in conventional fluorescence intensity-based laser scanning microscopy.\nDefine the locations for pO2 measurements using the vascular image as a reference.\nNote: Save the image of the pial vasculature for subsequent imaging sessions. It will serve as a map for future measurements.\nNote: Images of the vasculature in the region of interest obtained directly before and after oxygen measurements help to determine whether a movement occurred during the measurements.\nSingle-point pO2 measurements\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section describes the procedures for oxygen measurements on pre-selected single points and patterns of points.\nSelect settings for single point pO2 measurements (see previous section).\nSelect several points within a vessel and/or in the interstitial space and perform a test run in order to estimate the signal strength and SNR.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1625-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Recording and analyzing phosphorescence decays\nThe phosphorescence decays are shown as they are presented by the imaging software in the authors’ laboratory. Other imaging programs may not be able to allow visualization of the phosphorescence decay data at the time of imaging.",
    "(A) Oxyphor 2P is excited by a 10 μs-long train of femtosecond pulses (150 fs, 80 MHz rep. rate). The excitation is followed by a 260 μs-long data collection period, during which the phosphorescence is detected. The excitation/detection cycles are repeated multiple times in order to increase the SNR.\n(B) Example of phosphorescence traces acquired using progressively higher excitation powers. The yellow region corresponds to the excitation-ON phase in the trace (10 μs). The gray-shaded area marks additional 5 μs after the end of the excitation phase. These 5 μs of the data are removed from the decay to minimize the interference of the detector response function, which in some systems can be slow (microseconds). At higher excitation powers the detector response becomes saturated, which is manifested by the truncation of the signal near the peak intensities (traces 1 and 2).\n(C) Phosphorescence decay and the fit to a single-exponential function (red line, see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).

    "(B) Dual-channel image (magenta = FITC-dextran channel, white = Oxyphor 2P channel) of a selected plane along the stack. While FITC-dextran is localized in the vessels only, Oxyphor 2P is present both in the vascular and extravascular space. For better visualization of the extravascular contribution, the image of the phosphorescence channel was converted to logarithmic scale before merging.\n(C) Color-coded grid-like image of pO2 values superimposed on the fluorescence intensity image shown in (B) (FITC-dextran channel).\n(D and E) Phosphorescence decays corresponding to the vascular (D) and extravascular (E) points. The signal in D exhibits a rapid drop in intensity following the excitation phase (gray shaded area) due to the fluorescence of FITC-dextran, which could not be removed fully by optical filtering. This fluorescence disappears almost instantaneously (nanoseconds) after the excitation pulse. In (E) fluorescence is not present. After removing the excitation phase (yellow) and the subsequent 5 μs of the data (gray), the remaining traces (D and E, lower graphs) correspond solely to the phosphorescence of Oxyphor 2P in the respective compartments. These phosphorescence decays are used for fitting and phosphorescence lifetime determination. The gray dashed horizontal lines represent the constant background due to electronic noise and stray light (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]). Scale bars 20 μm.",
    "Note: If the probe was injected intravascularly, the measurements at the locations within the vessels should reveal clear phosphorescence decays (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), while the measurements outside the vasculature should result in no signal. In the case of cisterna magna injection decays may be present originating from both compartments (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, points D and E). Depending on the imaging software, the operator might or might not be able to visualize the phosphorescence traces, such as those shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], at the time of imaging. If this useful feature is not a part of the imaging program, other means of monitoring the signal strength should be present, e.g., an indicator of the signal level with the respect to the detector’s linear range and run-time calculation of the SNR.\nAdjust the laser power so that it falls within the acceptable power range and the signal is within the linear range of the detector (see selecting excitation power[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]).\nRecord the decays.\nNote: It is possible to perform measurements in a set of points combined into a pattern, revisiting each point multiple times. Using a pattern is convenient, for example, for assessing pO2 levels in a large region (e.g., Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nNote: Special care is required when selecting excitation power for measurements that encompass both vascular and extravascular compartments, as signal intensities corresponding to these two compartments can be significantly different. In this case, the excitation powers should be chosen such that the signal levels in the two compartments are comparable."
