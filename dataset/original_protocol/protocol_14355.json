    "All procedures, including steps related to animal subjects, have been approved by the Animals Ethics Committee (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe) and follow the animal care guidelines of Heidelberg University.\n1. Preparation of Fixative (4% PFA/PBS)\nPrepare fixative fresh every day to ensure optimal preservation of histological tissue integrity.\nDissolve 0.2 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 90 mL double distilled water (ddH2O) while constantly stirring at room temperature.\nAdd 4 g paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stir until the solution is completely clear for at least 5-10 min to assure depolymerization of macromolecules.\n\tCaution: PFA is toxic, handle with care.\nDissolve 0.84 g of sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4) in the solution and control pH at 7.2 via measurement.\nAdjust volume to 100 mL with ddH2O and filter the solution through grade 3 filter paper.\nStore 4% PFA/PBS on ice.\n2. Preparation of Euthanasia Solution\nNOTE: The following steps were done with ABTL wild-type zebrafish strain at a general age of 6-8 mon.\nUse ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methane sulfonate, also named \"tricaine\" or MS-222, in a concentration of 0.31 mg/mL for zebrafish euthanasia16. Utilize 1x egg water, used to raise zebrafish embryos, as solvent for the euthanasia solution. Generally, control the correct anesthesia depth before working with sedated fish by demonstrating loss of equilibrium and touch reaction loss.\n\t\nTo attain 1,000 mL of 10x egg water, add these salts to 1,000 mL double distilled water (ddH2O) while constantly stirring in the following order: 10 g NaCl, 0.3 g KCl, 0.4 g CaCl2*6H2O, 1.32 g MgSO4*6H2O.\n3. Fixation of Zebrafish Tissue\nTransfer 6 mL 4% PFA/PBS solution per sample into the wells of six-well plates in advance.",
    "Euthanize the adult zebrafish (previously maintained on a standard light-day cycle, e.g., 12 h: 12 h) 2 h after lights turn on in the morning, by placing them in the tricaine solution and wait until they have reached euthanasia. Following the cessation of opercular movement, which can take up to 10 min.\nTake the fish out of the tricaine euthanasia solution and put them on fresh paper towels. Dry the fish and use a scalpel to cut the heads behind the operculum (see Figure 2A). Transfer the heads directly into the prepped well plates, which contain the freshly prepared fixative.\nStore the well plates containing the fish heads at 4 °C overnight for at least 24 h to assure the fixative penetrates the deeper retinal layers.\n\tNOTE: Zebrafish heads can be stored for a maximum of 48 h in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C before preparation without a relevant loss of fluorescence signal strength. Increased latency can lead to loss of tissue integrity and reduced picture quality, and thus should be avoided.\n4. Preparation of the Zebrafish Retinal Vasculature\nFill a petri dish up to a third with heated 2% agarose and wait until the agar is firm. Cover the agar plate with 1x PBS to create a workspace to dissect the eyes.\n\tNOTE: This will allow both preservation of preparation tweezers and low pressure on the tissue while dissecting, reducing the likelihood of structural damage. All further preparation steps should be performed in this workspace utilizing #5 straight forceps with fine tips under a dissecting microscope with additional epi-illumination.\n\t\nWhile dissecting, use magnification between 4.0x and 6.0x to allow for both overview and detail-oriented assessment of the tissue.",
    "Transfer the fixed sample into the petri dish and, by holding the head at the cut surface with one tweezer, insert another pinned-together tweezer below the eyeball at the orbital cavity. Slowly open the tweezer below the eye and grip the optic nerve, then carefully tear and detach the eyes (Figure 2B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56674/56674fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Removal of the adult zebrafish eye.

Since gripping the eyeball directly leads to internal vessel breakage, this technique is appropriately gentle to preserve the vasculature.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56674/56674fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Adult zebrafish eye with extraocular muscles in focus.

    "Use a 27G (0.4 x 19 mm) disposable needle to puncture the cornea (Figure 4C, red arrow) at the outer range. Through this opening hold the cornea with both tweezers and slightly tear it open. Afterwards carefully work to create a centered tear approximately the size of the respective pupil.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56674/56674fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Adult zebrafish eye after removal of all extraocular muscles.

This will create a small dent and push the lens to the height of the corneal tear. Run the tweezers under the lens and remove it (Figure 5A).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56674/56674fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Adult zebrafish eye in the process of lens removal.

Note that the sclera and cornea are connected and form the fibrous tunic of the eye bulb to protect the cup-shaped retina. (Figure 6).",
    "This shell, consisting of the cornea and sclera, is also called \"corneosclera\" and spares out the area around the optic nerve (Figure 4B, red dashed line). Insert a needle at this discontinuation once to create an opening between the sclera and the retina.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56674/56674fig6.jpg\nFigure 6: Corneosclera consisting of sclera and cornea, which is disconnected from the remaining intraocular tissue.

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56674/56674fig6large.jpg]\nUsing this access with both tweezers, carefully rip the sclera axially into stripes to increase the opening around the optic nerve. Be careful to keep the corneosclera intact at the transition to the corneal side circumference (see Figure 6A).\nHold the sclera with one tweezer and, by grabbing the optic nerve with the other and pulling away, wholly remove the corneosclera from the eye and discard it (Figure 6). Try to sever any connections before separating the corneosclera and the remaining intraocular tissue, as attachment to other structures will be a critical point; this step will provide a cup-shaped structure consisting of the uvea and retina containing the retinal vasculature (Figure 7).\nCreate a rupture in the choroidal/RPE layer by holding a 27G needle sideways to the remaining cup while scraping the outer surface with the rim of the needle tip. Use the rupture as an access point to get a grip on the choroidal/RPE layer and rip it with both tweezers into stripes, but keep the connection to the iris intact.",
    "Afterwards, run one tweezer under the iris and go around in a circuit from the outside while creating tension by pulling at the discontinued choroidal/RPE layer to achieve detachment of the combined structure.\n\t\tNOTE: The iris must be disconnected, so as to not obstruct the fluorescence while visualizing the vessels (Figure 8B). Grabbing the iris directly to remove it can lead to extensive vessel damage, especially at the inner optic circle (IOC), since the iris is still connected to the surrounding tissue. The choroidal layer and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) can be separated and often retain a connection to the iris, which allows for an easy secondary removal.\nIf parts of the iris cannot be removed, utilize a natural breaking point the adult zebrafish eye exhibits inside the photoreceptor layer (PL), in a similar fashion to step 4.9, to remove the iris.\nScrape over the outside of the remaining cup-shaped retina to induce discontinuations in the PL above the breaking point (Figure 11C, black arrow). Use the created access to remove the upper part of the layer while keeping the possible connection to the iris intact. Afterwards, run the tweezers under the iris and go around in a circuit as mentioned before to detach the combined structure.\n\t\tNOTE: One should exercise patience as the whole step 4.9 can be difficult, but this care will achieve a better vascular outcome than straightforwardly grabbing the iris at the rim of the pupil or forcing an opening by destroying connections to the choroidal/RPE or photoreceptor layer without their respective removal. Following this step will thus preserve retinal vascular integrity, but lead to damage of the outer retinal layers.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56674/56674fig7.jpg",

Mounting of the Retinal Vasculature\nWash the dissected retina two times for 5 minutes in 1x PBS. To transfer the retina after truncation of the optic nerve, utilize a lab spatula with a micro spoon end to avoid direct handling of the exposed tissue.\nPlace a drop of PBS onto a glass slide and transfer the retina into the droplet. Use a tweezer to keep the tissue in place while cutting the cup-shaped structure with a scalpel to create a flat four-petal or five-petal shape depending on the retinal size (see Figure 9).\nSuck up the leftover PBS with a fine piece of paper. Be careful not to touch the retina.\nCoat the flat-mounted retina in mounting media and cover with a coverslip. Be attentive not to create foam, as air bubbles can distort visualization of the retinal vessels.",
    "Minimize movement of the coverslip and seal the cover with clear nail polish.\n6. Visualization of the Retinal Vasculature\nKeep the time gap between preparation and visualization as short as possible to reduce image detail loss through fluorescence signal loss. Store the prepared retinal vasculature mounts at 4 °C to reduce signal loss, if direct visualization cannot be achieved, as degradation of image quality slowly becomes visible 48 h after preparation.\nVisualize the retinal vasculature mounts via fluorescence microscopy or laser scanning confocal microscopy.\n\tNOTE: Vessel visualization by fluorescence microscopy was achieved at 2.5x magnification with an exposure time of 2.0 s, gain of 6.0x and gamma settings of 1.67. For confocal microscopy, an Ar-laser (488 nm/20 mW) at 20% power was utilized in combination with a TD 488/543/633 excitation filter, a 20x/0.7 NA multi-immersion objective with ddH2O as immersion media, and emission filter settings of 505-560 nm. Confocal pictures are composed of 4x4, 4x5, or 5x5 singular images combined through a tile scan depending on the retinal size.\n7. HE Sections of the Zebrafish Retina\nNOTE: For HE sections of the zebrafish retina, prepare the tissue as described in the protocol until step 4.5 and afterwards skip directly to step 7.1.\nWash the enucleated eyes (after step 4.5) two times for 5 minutes in 1x PBS. Afterwards, transfer the tissue into 70% ethanol (EtOH). At this point, prepared eyes can be stored at 4 °C until paraffin embedding.\nWash the tissue the following way to dehydrate it before paraffin embedding: 2x15 min in 80% ethanol, 2x15 min in 90% ethanol, 3x15 min in 96% ethanol, 3x15 min in 99% ethanol, 2x15 min in acetone/99% ethanol (1:2), 3x15 min in acetone. Keep the tissue in paraffin at 62 °C overnight.",
    "Heat up fresh paraffin to 62 °C and pour it into embedding molds. Transfer the tissue into the molds directly and, at a fast pace, control correct orientation of the eyes for the desired section. Afterwards, apply an embedding cassette to the mold and cover with additional heated paraffin.\nRemove the embedding molds after paraffin blocks have cooled down. Cut the paraffin blocks at a microtome into 10 µm sections and float them out on a 45 °C water bath on the water surface long enough for them to flatten completely.\nCatch the sections on a glass slide and drain them vertically to remove excess water before drying them overnight in an oven at 45 °C.\nProcess the sections further with the following schedule to deparaffinize and HE stain: 4x1 min in xylol, 1x1 min in 99% ethanol, 1x1 min in 96% ethanol, 1x1 min in 80% ethanol, 1x1 min in 70% ethanol, 1x1 min in ddH2O, 1x4 min in Mayer's hematoxylin, 1x10 min in ddH2O, 1x2min in 0.5% eosin, 1x30 s in ddH2O, 1x30 s in 80% ethanol, 2x30 s in 96% ethanol, 3x1 min in 99% ethanol, and 1x1 min in xylol.\nTake the glass slide out of the xylol and quickly cover the tissue with mounting media. Avoid to let the tissue dry out completely, then place a coverslip on top and seal the stained tissue."
