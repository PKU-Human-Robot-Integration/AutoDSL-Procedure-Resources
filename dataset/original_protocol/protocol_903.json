    "1- Grow approximately 10,000 worms on 2 x 150 mm NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 bacteria.\n2- Harvest worms and wash them 3 times with 15 ml of M9 buffer.\n3- Wash worms once with 15 ml of ddH2O.\n4- Resuspend worms in 3 ml of ice cold MIB and transfer them into a 7 ml dounce homogenizer on ice.\n5- Perform 21 gentle strokes.\n6- Centrifuge at 200 g for 5 min and keep supernatant.\n7- Centrifuge at 800 g for 10 min and keep supernatant.\n8- Centrifuge at high-speed 12,000 g for 10 min to pellet the total mitochondria.  \n 9- MIB is removed and replaced by 500 µl of ice cold PEB.\n10- Add 100 µg of anti-HA magnetic beads.\n11- Incubate samples at 4 °C for 1 h while rotating at 10 rpm.\n12- Transfer the samples on a homemade setup consisting of a column and a magnet.\n13- Ensure that beads were attracted to the side of the tip and held by the magnet and then wash twice with 25 ml of ice cold PEB. \n14- After washings, resuspend the beads in 20 µl of MIB."
