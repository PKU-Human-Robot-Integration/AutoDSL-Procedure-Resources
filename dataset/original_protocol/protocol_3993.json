    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAssessment of memory bias (day 1)\nTiming: approximately 40 min (for 1 participant)\nMemory bias is assessed using a word identification task (WI) plus an incidental free recall task (IFR) (Tarsia et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). This task is comprised of four phases: exercise phase, priming phase, WI phase and IFR phase (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/957-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Task for assessing memory bias\nThis task is comprised of four phases: exercise phase, priming phase, WI phase and IFR phase. 16 blocks of three trials are included in the exercise phase. The words in the three trials of a single block are presented for a different duration (t1, t2, t3), which are preset by the experimenter at the beginning of the exercise task. In the WI phase, the word in each trial is presented for a fixed duration, which is the estimated threshold duration in the exercise phase.\nExercise phase (The purpose of this phase is to familiarize participants with the WI phase and estimate each participant’s reading threshold. The outcome of this phase is used to set up the exposure duration of the word stimuli for the WI phase to avoid floor or ceiling effect).\nLet the participant sit in front of a computer screen. Show the participant the instruction slide and read the following instructions to the participant: “A list of words will be presented one at a time in the center of the screen and the exposure duration of each word is very short. You are invited to guess all of the words presented and read them aloud even if you are not sure or did not believe that you had actually seen a word.”\nStart the exercise program and set the duration (number of frames) of the word images.",
    "A total of 48 neutral words are presented in pseudorandom order in 16 blocks of three trials in the exercise program.\nFor each block, the words in the three trials are presented for a different duration, which are preset by the experimenter at the beginning of the exercise task.\nIn each of the 48 trials, a word is preceded by a mask displayed for 1000 ms and followed by a mask with a variable duration. The total duration of a word and the mask following it is 3000 ms. Each trial is preceded by a fixation cross displayed in the center of the screen for 1000 ms.\nAs the participants read the words aloud, the experimenter checks the accuracy of their answers.\nCheck the accuracy of the participant’s answers at preset durations of the words. Record the corresponding duration of the word when the accuracy is approximately 50%. If the accuracy is too high or too low, the duration should be reset, and the exercise phase should be repeated.\nCritical: Computers with higher refresh rates will make it easier for the experimenter to evaluate the reading threshold for each participant, considering that the accuracy can change dramatically when tested near the threshold. Based on a preliminary, we found that it is hard to evaluate the threshold duration on a computer with refresh rate of 60 Hz. The refresh rate of the computer we used in this task was 120 Hz, and the initial preset number of frames for each block in the exercise phase was 7, 8 and 9.\nPriming phase (The purpose of this phase is to present participants with priming words. Participants are instructed to attentively watch these words and rate them for their emotionality. Participants don’t know they will be asked to recall these words. ).",
    "Show the participant the instruction slide and read the following instructions to the participant: “Pay attention to the words appearing one at a time in the center of the screen and rate them for their negativeness or positiveness on a five-point scale that appeared on the screen after each word.”\nStart the priming program.\nIn each of 48 trials, a word is presented in the center of the screen for 4000 ms, followed by a five-point rating scale (1 = very negative, 5 = very positive). The rating scale remained on the screen until the participant pressed the select key on the keyboard. The key that pressed by the participant is recorded by the program.\nThree types of words (negative, positive, neutral), with 16 words of each type, are presented in a pseudorandom order to the participant.\nWI phase (The purpose of this phase is to assess participants’ implicit memory bias.). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nShow the participant the instruction slide and read the following instructions to the participant: “A list of words will be presented one at a time in the center of the screen and the exposure duration of each word is very short. You are invited to guess all of the words presented and read them aloud even if you are not sure or did not believe that you had actually seen a word.”\nTurn on a recording device to record the participant’s answers during the task.\nStart the WI program and set the exposure duration of each word as the threshold duration recorded in the exercise phase.",
    "The WI phase is comprised of 96 trials. In each trial, word is presented as in the exercise phase, except for the exposure duration, which is constant and set as the threshold duration recorded in the exercise phase to avoid floor or ceiling effects.\nThree types of words (negative, positive, neutral), with 32 words of each type, are presented in a pseudorandom order in this phase. Half of the words are the same as those in the priming phase. And the other half are new words.\nAs the participants read the words aloud, the experimenter checks the accuracy of their answers.\nTurn off the recording device and save the data.\nIFR phase (The purpose of this phase is to measure participants’ incidental free recall for the priming words. Performance in this phase is used as indices of explicit memory bias.). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nImmediately after the end of the WI phase, ask the participant to recall the words they have encountered in the previous 3 phases, as many as possible, and write them down.\nAsk the participant to recall for at least 8 min.\nCritical: Before the IFR phase, the participants are not supposed to know they will be asked to recall the words encountered in the previous 3 phases. The IFR phase should be started immediately after the end of WI phase.\nNote: Although the aim of the IFR phase is to investigate the participants’ memory of the words encountered in the priming phase, the participant is asked to recall the words they have encountered in all of the previous 3 phases. This is to avoid false negatives (words not reported because they were falsely not attributed to the priming phase) (Tarsia et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).",
    "Note: The WI and IFR phases measure implicit and explicit memory biases, respectively (Tarsia et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Since we are only interested in explicit bias in this protocol, the data from the WI phase were not analyzed. Future researchers may consider utilizing the data from the WI phase if they are interested in implicit memory bias.\nPause point: Participants could take a break after finishing the IFR task.\nAssessment of interpretation bias (day 1)\nTiming: approximately 20 min (for 1 participant)\nInterpretation bias is assessed using the ambiguous scenarios test for depressed mood (AST-D, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) (Berna et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Participants are presented with several ambiguous scenarios and asked to rate the pleasantness of each scenario. The rating scores are used to evaluate the interpretation bias of participants.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/957-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Task for assessing interpretation bias\nThe AST-D task is comprised of 24 trials. The procedure of a single trial is shown in the figure.\nShow participants the instruction slide and read the following instructions to the participant: “You will be presented with a list of scenarios. Form a mental image of each of the scenarios. Imagine each scenario happening to you personally. Follow the first image that comes to mind and then rate how pleasant your image is, as well as how vivid it is.”\nCritical: Participants should be instructed to follow the first image that comes to mind and don’t think too much about each scenario.\nStart the AST-D program.\nA total of 24 ambiguous scenarios are presented in the AST-D task.\nIn each of the 24 trials, participants are presented with a sentence depicting an ambiguous scenario on the screen. Participants imagine the scenario happening to themselves. After the imagination is complete, the participant presses the blank key to go to the next step.",
    "Once participants press the blank key, a 7-point pleasantness rating scale (1 = extremely unpleasant, 7 = extremely pleasant) will be shown on the screen. The rating scale remains on the screen until participants press the select number key on the keyboard. The key that pressed by the participants is recorded by the program.\nOnce participants rate for the pleasantness, a 7-point vividness rating scale (1 = not vivid at all, 7 = extremely vivid) will be shown on the center of the screen. The rating scale remains on the screen until participants press the select number key on the keyboard. The key that pressed by participants is recorded by the program. Then, the next trial begins.\nCritical: The ambiguous scenarios used in the AST-D task should match the life experience of the participants. The scenarios we used in this protocol was translated from the materials of a previous study (Berna et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), because the participants’ age in that study (mean age = 22.49 years) is similar with the participants’ age in our study (mean age = 21.22 years). Researchers using this protocol should consider using other ambiguous scenarios if the participants in their study are children or other special populations.\nPause point: Participants could take a break after finishing the AST-D task.\nAssessment of attention bias (day 1)\nTiming: approximately 30 min (for 1 participant)\nAttention bias is assessed using a visual search task (VST, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) (Wieser et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Participants are presented with six faces at each trial and need to detect if the emotion of these faces are the same. The accuracy and reaction time in detecting a sad face among neutral faces can be used as indices of negative attention bias.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/957-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Task for assessing attention bias",
    "The VS task is comprised of 252 trials. The procedure of a single trial is shown in the figure.\nShow the participant the instruction slide and read the following instructions to the participant: “In each trial, six faces arranged in a circle around a fixation cross will be presented on the screen. Please attentively watch the displays on the screen and detect as quickly and accurately as possible a discrepant face in the presented search arrays of six faces. Please press different keys (“yes” or “no” button) depending on whether a discrepant target is present in the array. ”\nBefore starting the VST task, provide participants with some practice trials.\nThe purpose of the practice trials is to familiarize participants with the rules of VST task and the position of “yes” and “no” buttons.\nThe practice grogram consists of 7 trials with displays containing a target or not.\nThe practice trials are randomly intercepted from the trials of VST program.\nCritical: Participants should be instructed to response as quickly and accurately as possible. Besides, make sure participants don’t confuse the “yes” and “no” buttons. Based on our test, some participants may confuse the two buttons in practice trials. If that happens, provide the participants more practice before starting the VST program.\nStart the VST program. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nThe VST program consists of two blocks, with 126 trials in each block. A 30-s break is provided between two blocks.\nFaces from four men and four women (sad, neutral) selected from the Chinese affective picture system (Bai et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) are used as stimuli in the VST program.",
    "Visual search arrays contain 6 faces with sad targets among neutral distractors, neutral targets among sad distractors, all neutral distractors and all sad distractors (4 conditions). The six faces in each trial are from the same person.\nBefore each trial, participants are presented with a fixation cross in the center of the screen for 1000 ms. Then six faces arranged in a circle around the fixation cross are presented on the screen. Participants need to detect a discrepant face in the presented six faces as quickly and accurately as possible and press different keys (a “yes” or “no” button) depending on whether a discrepant target is present among the six faces. Once a “yes” or “no” button is pressed, participants will be presented with a blank screen for a random duration (1500, 2000 or 2500 ms). Then the next trial begins.\nNote: Only sad and neutral faces are used as stimuli in the VST task in this protocol since our primary interest is negative memory bias in Zhang et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]. Future researchers using this protocol may consider including other kinds of emotional faces (for example, happy faces) based on their own study purpose.\nNote: The VST lasts a long time. Thus some participants may not be able to keep their fingers on the keyboard during the whole time of the task. For example, their fingers may leave the keyboard to scratch. To avoid the effect of this issue, there is a 30-s break at the middle of the task. And the experimenter need to emphasize to participants the importance of keeping their fingers on the keyboard. Besides, the experimenter need to pay attention to participants’ performance during the task and label the trials when participants’ fingers leave the keyboard. The labeled trials should be deleted from the analysis.",
    "Pause point: Participants could take a break after finishing the VST.\nAcquire fMRI scanning data (day 1)\nTiming: approximately 30 min (for 1 participant)\nParticipants complete an emotional face viewing task during the fMRI scan (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The purpose of this session is to detect participants’ brain activation when watch different emotional stimuli.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/957-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Emotional face viewing task during fMRI scan\nThe fMRI experiment is a face viewing task with 2 runs, each with 6 blocks. In each block, 5 trials of male faces and 5 trials of female faces are shown. In each trial, a face is shown in the center of the screen for 200 ms, followed by a black screen. Each trial lasts for 2 s. Then, the next face appears. A fixation cross is presented for 20 s between two blocks and for 10 s before the first block and after the last block of each session.\nParticipants complete a safety screening form for fMRI scan. Participants with MRI contraindications should be excluded from the fMRI experiment.\nCheck the participant’s visual acuity.\nProvide the participant, who has a poor visual acuity, with a pair of corrective glasses that is compatible with the MRI scanner.\nNote: Step 11 (check the participant’s visual acuity) should be completed at the beginning of the fMRI scanning session, so that there are some time for the participant to adapt to the corrective glasses.\nRead the following instructions to the participant:\nYou will need to lie in a MRI scanner for about 20 min. Please keep your head still when you are in the scanner.\nYou will also need to complete an emotional face viewing task during the fMRI scan. Please attentively watch the faces presented on the screen during the task.",
    "Please remove all metallic objects from your body (for example, glasses, coins, phones, keys, etc.) before get into the scanner room.\nOpen the stimulus system.\nTurn on the stimulus computer and check the resolution and frame rate are set appropriately. In this protocol, the resolution of the stimulus computer is 1024∗768 and the frame rate is 60 Hz.\nTurn on the projector.\nOpen the projector control software on the stimulus computer and check the content on the screen of the stimulus computer is correctly projected by the projector.\nAdjust the position of the projector, so that all of the content on the screen of the stimulus computer can be projected on the MRI screen appropriately.\nMake sure scanner triggers and button box responses are registered by the stimulus computer.\nOpen the MATLAB software and the emotional face viewing program on the stimulus computer.\nBefore getting into the scanner room, ask the participant to change into MRI appropriate slippers and remove all metallic objects from their body. The experimenter also needs to remove all metallic objects from the body. Ask the participant to stuff up the ears with earplugs.\nCritical: Metallic objects can’t be brought into the scanning room. Otherwise, they will affect MRI signals and even cause damage to the scanner.\nAfter getting into the scanner room, ask the participant to lie on the scanner table in a comfortable position and keep their head in the head coil (an 8-channel phased array head coil is used in this protocol). Stabilize the participant’s head via foam padding within the head coil. Remind participants not to cross their hands or legs and keep their head still during the scan. Explain to participants that they may tell the experimenter to stop the scan at any time if they feel uncomfortable.",
    "Adjust the mirror system.\nMake sure the participant can have a full view of the screen projected by the projector.\nIf the participant cannot see enough of the screen, ask them to adjust the position and angle of the mirror on the top of their head.\nPut the button box into the participant’s hand and tell them the position of the buttons.\nMove the table into the scanner bore slowly. Then, the experimenter gets out of the scanner room.\nStart the scanning session. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nRegister the participant in the MRI scanning control system.\nThree-plane localization scan. Check that the head is in the right position.\nASSET Calibration. A calibration scan using array spatial sensitivity encoding technique (ASSET).\nRead the following instructions to the participant: Please keep your head still during the scan. If you feel uncomfortable or can’t see the screen in the mirror, please press the “1” button now. Otherwise, please press the “2” button.\nIf the participant presses the “1” button, stop the scanning session and check what the problem is. If the participant press the “2” button, continue with the scan.",
    "Acquire functional images using T2-weighted sequence (slice number = 36; slice thickness = 3 mm; repetition time [TR] = 2 s; echo time [TE] = 30 ms; flip angle [FA] = 90°; matrix = 64 × 64) while participants performing the face viewing task (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The total functional scan is composed of 2 runs, each with 6 blocks. The facial stimuli in each run consists of grayscale normalized sad, happy, and neutral expressions of 30 men and 30 women faces. In each block, 5 trials of male faces and 5 trials of female faces are shown. The expressions of the faces are the same in a single block and different between two adjacent blocks. In each trial, a face is shown in the center of the screen for 200 ms, followed by a black screen. Each trial lasts for 2 s. Then, the next face appears. A fixation cross is presented for 20 s between two blocks and for 10 s before the first block and after the last block of each run. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nAcquire anatomical images using T1-weighted sequence (slice number = 188, slice thickness = 1 mm, repetition time [TR] = 8.2 ms, echo time [TE] = 3.2 ms, slice orientation: sagittal).\nSave all the data acquired.\nNote: The experimenter need to constantly remind the participant to stay as still as possible in the scanner. Head movement may cause distortions that cannot be corrected.\nAssessment of future depressive indices (3 months after fMRI scanning)\nTiming: approximately 5 min (for 1 participant)\nFuture depressive indices are assessed three months later using internet-based BDI-II questionnaires.\nSend the participant a BDI-II questionnaire through the Internet (for example, through WeChat, email, etc.) 3 months later, and ask the participant to complete it.",
    "Note: Some of the nonclinical depressed participants’ future depressive indices were assessed during the pandemic, and the others were assessed before the pandemic, as reported in Zhang et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]. This provided us with the opportunity to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationship between cognitive bias and depression severity of nonclinical depression. Members of the NDG whose future BDI-II questionnaires were collected before the outbreak were further classified as the before the outbreak group (BG), and those whose future BDI-II questionnaires were collected during the outbreak were further classified as during the outbreak group (DG).\nSocializing information collection (in June 2020)\nTiming: approximately 5 min (for 1 participant)\nInternet-based questionnaires about socializing before and during COVID-19 were collected in June 2020 in Zhang et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nSend participants a questionnaire about socializing before and during the COVID-19 pandemic through the Internet in June 2020 and ask them to complete it.\nNote: The questionnaire used in this step is provided in the supplemental information."
