    "All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee (Regierungspräsidium Tübingen) and carried out in accordance by the German Animal Welfare Act and the EU Directive 2010/63/EU.\n1. In Utero Electroporation\nMicroinjection needles\nPull borosilicate glass capillaries (outer diameter: 1.0 mm, inner diameter: 0.58 mm, length: 100 mm) into microinjection needles using a micropipette puller with a box filament (2.5 mm x 2.5 mm) and the following program: HEAT: 540, PULL: 125, VELOCITY: 20, and DELAY: 140. Determine the HEAT value for every individual filament by performing a RAMP test (HEAT value: RAMP+25).\nBevel needles at an angle of 38° and intermediate to high revolution speed with a microgrinder to obtain a tip size of 20 to 30 µm for injecting at embryonic day (E) 13.5 or younger and 30 to 40 µm for injecting at older embryonic stages. For storage, fix needles in a box or petri dish with modeling clay to prevent damage to the tips.\nPlasmid DNA Solution\nPrepare plasmid DNA construct containing fluorescent reporter protein (e.g. GFP) using an endotoxin-free maxi preparation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nDilute plasmid DNA solution to a final concentration of 1 - 2 µg/µL in endotoxin-free Tris-EDTA buffer containing Fast Green at a final concentration of 0.01%. Aliquot solution and store at -20 °C.\nBacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Solution\nPrepare bacteriostatic sodium chloride solution by adding benzyl alcohol to a final concentration of 0.9% to isotonic 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Sterile filter solution immediately before use.\nCarprofen Injection Solution\nPrepare carprofen injection solution by adding carprofen to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL to sterile isotonic 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Store at 4 °C for up to 28 days.\nAnesthesia, DNA Injection, and Electroporation",
    "Weigh an E14.5 timed-pregnant mouse and place it into a transparent anesthetizing chamber connected to a vaporizer and saturated with 5% isoflurane. When the animal is unconscious, transfer it to an anesthetizing mask attached to a 37 °C warming plate and keep it anesthetized with 1.8 - 2.2% isoflurane.\nNote: Assess the development of surgical anesthesia by loss of tail pinch and pedal reflexes (toe pinch).\nFor analgesia, inject 100 µL of carprofen injection solution per 10 mg of mouse bodyweight (5 mg/kg bodyweight) subcutaneously. Turn the mouse with its back down and carefully cover the eyes with petroleum jelly to prevent them from drying.\nGently spread out the limbs and fix them to the warming plate with surgical tape. Sterilize the abdomen with 70% ethanol followed by iodine solution (7.5 mg/mL) using cellulose swabs. Repeat this procedure three times to ensure for proper disinfection.\nCover the abdomen with sterile gauze in which an incision has been cut to spare out a field (diameter: 2 - 2.5 cm) for the abdominal incision. Moisten the gauze with bacteriostatic sodium chloride solution.\n\t\tCaution: Reassess the development of surgical anesthesia by loss of the pedal reflex.\nUsing Micro Adson Forceps (serrated, length: 12 cm) and fine scissors (angled to side, length: 9 cm) cut the skin approximately 1.5 cm along the midline of the abdomen. Cut the underlying muscle along the linea alba.\nRemove one uterine horn with ring forceps (length: 9 cm, outer diameter: 3 mm, inner diameter: 2.2 mm) and gently place it onto the moistened gauze.\n\t\tCaution: Hold the uterine horn with ring forceps only in between embryos and do not perturb the placentas or any supply vessels. Keep the uterus moist at all times with bacteriostatic sodium chloride solution.",
    "Carefully position an embryo with ring forceps and locate the lateral ventricle, which presents as a crescent shaped shadow parallel to the sagittal sinus. The injection site lies approximately in the middle of a line between the pigmented eye and the confluence of sinuses, where the sagittal sinus branches to two transverse sinuses. Push the microinjection needle through the uterine wall and into the lateral ventricle.\n\t\tNote: If necessary, the depth of the injection can be corrected by retraction of the needle.\nInject 1 to 2 µL of DNA solution into the lateral ventricle with a microinjector, which is operated with a foot pedal, using the following settings: 25 psi, 10 to 20 ms per pulse, and 5 to 10 pulses. Successful injection can be monitored by the colored DNA solution, which should fill the ventricular system.\nPlace tweezers-type electrodes (3 mm diameter for E13.5 or younger and 5 mm diameter for E14.5 or older) in such a way that the 'positive' terminal is on the same side as the injected ventricle and the 'negative' terminal is on the opposite side of the injected ventricle below the ear of the embryo's head.\nMoisten the electroporation site with a few drops of bacteriostatic sodium chloride solution and apply 5 electrical current pulses (35 V for E13.5 or younger and 40 V for E14.5 or older) of 50 ms duration with 950 ms intervals.\n\t\tNote: Currents of 60 to 90 mA are usually sufficient for successful electroporation. Lower currents will not efficiently transfect neurons, whereas higher currents may lead to embryonic death.\nRepeat the procedure (c.f. Step 1.5.7. to 1.5.10.) for every embryo of the uterine horn and gently place it back into the abdominal cavity.",
    "Remove the uterine horn from the other side and repeat the procedure described in Step 1.5.7. to 1.5.11.\nClose the abdominal cavity by suturing the muscle layer before suturing the skin using Micro Adson Forceps, Mathieu Needle Holder (tungsten carbide, length: 14 cm), and non-absorbable surgical suture (3/8 circle, 13 mm, taper point).\n\t\tCaution: Be careful not to capture the uterus or any other organs during suture.\nCarefully disinfect the skin suture with iodine solution (7.5 mg/mL) and gently remove periocular excess of petroleum jelly using cellulose swabs.  Place the mouse under an infrared lamp until it wakes up. Closely monitor the mouse during the next two days. Repeat the analgesia treatment as described in Step 1.5.2 after 12 to 24 h.\n2. Organotypic Slice Culture\nLaminin Stock Solution\nDissolve 1 mg of lyophilized laminin in sterile water to obtain a 1 mg/mL laminin stock solution. Prepare 50 µL aliquots and store at -80 °C.\nPoly-L-Lysine Stock Solution\nDissolve 50 mg of poly-L-lysine in sterile water to obtain a 1 mg/mL poly-L-lysine stock solution. Prepare 0.5 mL aliquots and store at -20 °C.\nComplete Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (Complete HBSS)\nPrepare complete HBSS by combining 50 mL of 10x HBSS solution, 1.25 mL of 1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 15 mL of 1 M D-glucose solution, 5 mL of 100 mM calcium chloride solution, 5 mL of 100 mM magnesium sulfate solution, and 2 mL of 1 M sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. Add sterile water up to 0.5 L, sterile filter, and store at 4 °C.\nSlice Culture Medium",
    "Combine 35 mL of Basal Medium Eagle (BME), 12.9 mL complete HBSS (c.f. section 2.3.1.), 1.35 mL of 1 M D-glucose, 0.25 mL of 200 mM L-glutamine, and 0.5 mL of penicillin-streptomycin to obtain 50 mL of slice culture medium. Sterile filter and add horse serum to a final concentration of 5%. Store at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks.\nLow Melting Point (LMP) Agarose Solution\nPrepare 3% LMP agarose solution by dissolving 1.5 g of LMP agarose in 50 mL of complete HBSS by heating in a microwave oven for 1 to 2 min at intermediate power.\nNote: Monitor heat carefully to prevent overflow during boiling.\nPlace solution in a water bath at 38 °C until ready for use. Store at 4 °C and reuse once.\nCoating of Membrane Inserts\nAdd one aliquot of laminin stock solution (c.f. Step 2.1.1.) and one aliquot of poly-L-lysine stock solution (c.f. Step 2.2.1.) to 6 mL of sterile water to obtain coating solution (enough for 6 inserts).\nPlace membrane inserts into a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of sterile water in the bottom of each well. Add 1 mL of coating solution (c.f. Step 2.6.1.) on top of each membrane and incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere.\n\t\tNote: Only use inserts with optically clear membranes, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane.\nWash the membranes three times with 1 mL of sterile water and dry. Use coated membranes on the same day or store in a clean 6-well plate at 4 °C for up to four weeks.\nBrain Dissection and Embedding\nTwo days after the electroporation place the mouse into a transparent chamber connected to a vaporizer and saturated with 5% isoflurane. When the animal is unconscious, remove it from the chamber and sacrifice it by cervical dislocation.",
    "Remove the uterus containing the embryos and place it into a 10-cm Petri dish with ice-cold complete HBSS.\n\t\tNote: From this point onward keep all solutions, embryos, and brains on ice.\nUse a stereomicroscope, fine tipped forceps (straight, 11 cm) and a pair of Vannas Tübingen Spring Scissors (angled up, length: 9.5 cm) to separate each embryo from the uterus and transfer it to another petri dish containing ice-cold complete HBSS.\nMake an incision at the level of the brain stem and cut along the sagittal midline. Peel away the skin and cartilage covering the brain. Then, cut off the brain stem right behind the hemispheres and remove the brain from the skull. Transfer the brain with a micro-spoon spatula (185 mm x 5 mm) to a 12-well plate containing ice-cold complete HBSS. Collect all brains from the litter in the 12-well plate.\nUse a fluorescent stereomicroscope to screen the brains in the 12-well plate for fluorescence brightness as well as size of the electroporated region. Select 2 to 4 brains with bright fluorescent signals in the presumptive somatosensory cortex for further processing.\nPour 3% LMP agarose solution kept at 38 °C into peel-away disposable embedding mold. Remove brain from the 12-well plate with a micro-spoon spatula and carefully drain excess complete HBSS around the brain using fine tissue paper.\nPlace the brain gently into the agarose solution, push it to the bottom of the mold, and carefully adjust its position using a 20-gauge needle. For coronal sections, orient the brain with the olfactory bulbs pointing upwards. Keep the mold on ice until the agarose solution is solidified and continue with sectioning the brain.\nVibratome Sectioning and Slice Culture",
    "Remove the agarose block from the mold and place it onto the lid of a sterile petri dish. Trim away excess agarose with a clean razor blade leaving approximately 2 to 3 mm below the olfactory bulbs and 1 mm of agarose on the other sides. Fix the trimmed agarose block with the olfactory bulbs pointing downwards to a specimen stage using cyanoacrylate glue.\n\t\tNote: Sterilize instruments and equipment with 70% ethanol before sectioning.\nTransfer the specimen stage to the slicing chamber of a vibrating blade microtome containing ice-cold complete HBSS and position the brain with its dorsal side towards the blade. Cut 250 µm thick brain slices containing the electroporated region with a low to moderate amplitude of 0.9 mm and a very slow sectioning speed of 0.09-0.12 mm/s. Usually 4 to 6 slices with bright fluorescent signal are obtained from each successfully electroporated brain.\nWith a bent micro-spoon spatula and fine tipped forceps, carefully transfer the brain slices with the surrounding agarose to a 6-well plate containing ice-cold complete HBSS.\n\t\tCaution: Be careful not to damage the brain tissue by only touching the agarose rim around the sections with the forceps during transfer.\nProcess all selected brains as described in Steps 2.8.1. to 2.8.3.\nMoisten the membrane inserts with 100 µL of complete HBSS before placing the brain slices onto the membranes to facilitate positioning of the slices. Up to 5 slices can be placed on 1 membrane insert.",
    "Carefully transfer the slices onto the membranes using a bent micro-spoon spatula and fine tipped forceps. Gently pull a slice onto the spatula by only touching the agarose rim with the forceps and gently push the slice from the spatula onto the membrane. Position the slice using forceps and continue to transfer the remaining slices. Remove excess complete HBSS with a pipette.\n\t\tNote: Do not overlap the slices with one another.\nWith the help of forceps carefully place the membrane inserts with the slices into a 6-well plate containing 1.8 mL of slice culture medium (c.f. Step 2.4.1.) and incubate at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere until time-lapse imaging.\n3. Time-Lapse Imaging\nMicroscope Setup\nSet a climate chamber placed onto the stage of an inverted confocal microscope to 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. Use a hybrid detector to reduce laser intensity and improve cell viability. For detailed analysis, use an extra-long working distance 40X dry objective with a numerical aperture of 0.6 or higher.\n\t\tNote: All components of the microscope need to be pre-warmed to 37 °C for 2 - 3 h before imaging to provide a stable focus during the imaging process.\nSlice Imaging\nSelect a brain slice for imaging from the 6-well plate containing the membrane inserts using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\n\t\tCaution: Avoid prolonged exposure time to ultraviolet light as this may cause cellular photodamage.\n\t\tNote: Select a slice with bright single neurons in the upper SVZ migrating radially towards the pial surface of the slice. Fine fluorescent processes of radial glial cells that span the entire CP indicate an intact radial glial scaffold, which is used by radially migrating cortical neurons.",
    "Transfer the membrane insert with the slice, which was selected for time-lapse imaging, into a 50 mm diameter glass bottom dish containing 2 ml of slice culture medium with the help of forceps. Place the dish into the climate chamber of the confocal microscope.\nSet the resolution to 512 by 512 pixels and increase the scan speed from 400 Hz to 700 Hz in order to increase the frame rate from about 1.4 to about 2.5 frames per second, respectively. Use no more than two times averaging. Define a z-stack through the electroporated region (usually 400-100 μm) with a step size of 1.5 μm. Collectively, these settings allow for a sufficient resolution and brightness of the image while keeping photodamage low during acquisition. Start the time-lapse series by taking a z-stack every 30 min.\n\t\tNote: Prolonged exposure of the slice to laser light will induce photodamage reducing the viability of the cells. Adjust the exposure time to laser light accordingly.\nAnalyze time-lapse series using ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/iij/) or equivalent.\nSubscription Required.
