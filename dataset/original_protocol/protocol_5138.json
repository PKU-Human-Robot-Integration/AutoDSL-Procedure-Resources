    "Safety: Wear gloves, goggles and lab coat. Avoid contact and inhalation. Potassium ferrocyanide; Low toxicity as long as it is not heated, it will release cyanide gas.Hydrochloric acid; target organ effects on reproductive system and fetal tissue. Irritant to skin eyes and respiratory system.Deparaffinize tissue slide and hydrate to distilled water (use Histoclear reagent 2x, 100% EtOH 2x, 95% EtOH 1x, 90% EtOH 1x, 80% EtOH 1x, 70% EtOH 1x, ddH2O 1x. leave 3-5 min in each solution).Immediately transfer slides into working solution (avoid drying the tissue) and either use the microwave method (30 sec, then allow slides to stand in solution for 5 min in fume hood) or use the conventional method (room temperature for 30 min).Rinse in distilled water.Nuclear-fast red (incubate for 5 min at room temperature).Wash in tap water (several washes).Dehydrate, clear (reverse the order of step 1 above).Add mounting solution and coverslip. Results:table:\n﻿0,1\nIron (hemosiderin):,Blue\nNuclei:,Red\nBackground:,Pink\n(Slide shows mouse spleen at 400x)"
