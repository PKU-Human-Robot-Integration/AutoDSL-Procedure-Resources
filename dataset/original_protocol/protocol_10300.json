    "1. Preparation of the Prepolymer Solutions\nPreparation using water as a solvent\nAdd 10.00 g of deionized (DI) water to a glass bottle with a magnetic stir bar.\nMeasure 2.00 g of SBMA and transfer it to the glass bottle containing the water. Stir the solution for 30 min, until the SBMA is completely dissolved.\nIn a separate bottle, add 20.00 g of PEGDA (Mn = 700 g/mol).\nAdd 20.0 mg of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (HCPK), a photo-initiator, to the PEGDA solution. Let the solution stir for at least 30 min.\nUsing a disposable pipette, transfer 8.00 g of the PEGDA-HCPK solution to the SBMA aqueous solution. Continuously stir the mixture until the solution is homogenous.\nPreparation using water/ethanol mixtures as solvents\nAdd 6.00 g of DI water and 4.00 g of ethanol to an amber glass bottle with a magnetic stir bar. Stir the solution to allow thorough mixing.\nAdd 2.00 g of SBMA to the water/ethanol mixture. Stir the solution and allow the SBMA to completely dissolve.\nUse a pipette to transfer 8.00 g of the PEGDA-HCPK solution to the SBMA mixture. Stir to mix the solution thoroughly.\n2. Preparation of the Freestanding Films\nPlace two spacers with known thicknesses on a clean quartz disc; the thickness of the spacers controls the thickness of the obtained polymer films19.\nTransfer a small amount (~1.0 mL) of the prepolymer solution to the quartz disc using a disposable pipette.\nPlace another quartz disc on top of the liquid and ensure that there are no bubbles in the liquid film.\nPlace the sample in an ultraviolet (UV) crosslinker and irradiate for 5 min using UV light with a wavelength of 254 nm19.\n\tNOTE: Alternative irradiation times and wavelengths can be used depending on the type of photoinitiator.",
    "Separate the polymer film from the quartz discs using a sharp blade. Use tweezers to transfer the film to a DI water bath. Change the water twice during the first 24 h to remove the solvent, unreacted monomer/crosslinker, and sol from the film.\n\tNOTE: The polymer film should be kept in the DI water to preserve the pore structure, if there is any.\nPrepare dried films for ATR-FTIR and DSC analysis.\n\t\nRemove the film from the water bath and allow it to air dry for 24 h.\nPlace the film in a vacuum oven at 80 °C to dry overnight under vacuum.\n3. Preparation of the Impregnated Membranes\nPlace a sheet of porous support onto a quartz disc.\nUsing a foam brush, coat each side of the support twice with the prepolymer solution based on the water/ethanol mixture4.\n\tNOTE: Since the support is hydrophobic, the prepolymer solution containing ethanol can easily wet the support.\nPlace another quartz disc on top of the support.\nPlace the sample in a UV crosslinker and irradiate for 5 min using UV light with a wavelength of 254 nm.\nTo remove the impregnated membrane from the quartz discs, immerse the whole assembly in a DI water bath for 5 min and carefully remove the membrane using a sharp blade and tweezers.\nKeep the membrane in DI water. Change the water twice to remove the solvent, the unreacted monomer/crosslinker, and the sol from the membrane.\nPrepare dried, impregnated membranes for ATR-FTIR and DSC analyses.\n\t\nRemove the membrane from the water bath. Allow the membrane to dry at ambient conditions for 24 h.\nDry the membrane in a vacuum oven overnight at 80 °C under vacuum.\n4. Characterization of the Freestanding Films and Impregnated Membranes\nATR-FTIR analysis",
    "Prepare a sample of the prepolymer solution, as stated in step 1.1, for FTIR analysis.\nPerform a background scan before scanning the sample. Set the wavenumber range from 600 cm-1 to 4,500 cm-1 at a 4-cm-1 resolution of measurement.\nPlace the sample in the FTIR machine for analysis.\nRemove the sample. Clean the crystal and the tip with an appropriate solvent.\nRepeat steps 4.1.1 - 4.1.4 for the following samples: porous support, prepolymer solution, dried freestanding films, and dried impregnated membranes.\nDifferential scan calorimetry (DSC)\nPlace a DSC pan and lid in a weighing balance and record their weight.\nPlace a small amount of sample (5-10 mg) inside the pan and close it with the lid.\nWeigh the pan containing the sample. From the weight difference between the occupied pan and lid and the unoccupied pan and lid, calculate the weight of the sample.\nUsing a press, hermetically seal the sample inside the pan.\nPlace the sealed pan inside the DSC cell in which the inert reference is located.\nEnter the weight of the unoccupied pan and lid and the weight of the sample in the program.\nScan with the DSC from -80 °C to 160 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.\nPerform the DSC analysis using the manufacturer's protocol.\nRepeat the DSC experiments for different samples following the aforementioned steps.\nMeasurement of contact angles using a pendant drop method\nCut a rectangular strip of the membrane sample (approximately 30 mm by 6 mm).\nSoak this strip in DI water for 10 min and then dry it for 5 min.\nPlace the dried sample on the sample holder.\nSubmerge the sample holder in a transparent environmental chamber containing the DI water20.",
    "Using a microliter syringe with a stainless steel needle, dispense drops of n-decane (approximately 1 µL) onto the membrane sample.\nLeave the setup undisturbed for 2 min to ensure the stabilization of the droplets.\nUse an appropriate image analysis software to determine the contact angle of the samples by measuring the angles of the dispensed droplets on the membrane surface.\nTake the average of the contact angle values obtained for various droplets.\nCharacterization of water permeability using a dead-end filtration system\nUse a hammer-driven hole punch with an appropriate diameter to cut coupons of freestanding films and impregnated membranes.\nPlace a prepared coupon on the porous support inside a dead end filtration cell.\nPlace the O-ring on top of the sample. Screw the two halves of the permeation cell together.\nAdd approximately 50 mL of DI water to the permeation cell. Screw on the cap and place the permeation cell on a magnetic stirrer. Set the stirring rate between 300 and 900 rpm.\nPlace a covered beaker on a balance to collect the permeate water. Tare the balance.\nOpen the valve on the gas cylinder. Turn the pressure regulator valve clockwise until the desired pressure is reached (45 psig for freestanding films and 35 psig for impregnated membranes).\nOpen the release valve to deliver the pressure to the permeation cell.\nMonitor and record the weight of the beaker with time.\nCalculate the water permeance (Aw) and permeability (Pw) with the solution-diffusion model shown below4,21\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55426/55426eq1.jpg",
    "where Aw is the water permeance (L/m2hbar or LMH/bar), Pw is the water permeability (LMH cm/bar), ρw is the water density (g/L), A is the effective area of the membrane (m2), Δm is the change in the mass of water permeate (g) over a time period Δt (h), Δp is the pressure difference across the membrane (bar), and l is the thickness of the swollen film (cm).\nUse a BSA solution containing 0.5 g/L BSA in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with pH = 7.4 to evaluate the antifouling properties and rejection rates of the membranes.\nRepeat steps 4.4.5 - 4.4.10 to determine the water flux in the presence of BSA. Calculate the BSA rejection rate with the following equation22\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55426/55426eq2.jpg\n\t\twhere RBSA is the BSA rejection rate of the membrane (%), CP is the concentration of BSA in the permeate (g/L), and CF is the concentration of BSA in the feed (g/L); the concentration of BSA can be determined via UV spectroscopy.\nSubscription Required.
