  "procedures": [
    "In this procedure, imiquimod cream is applied to the dorsal skin of mice using small (8-mm-diameter) Finn chambers to induce typical psoriatic symptoms and histopathological alterations while minimizing systemic inflammation. Such localized application of small amounts of imiquimod cream reduces side effects by decreasing the likelihood of ingestion of the cream. In addition, it makes it possible to examine treated and control skin on the same animal, reducing inter-animal variability as well as the number of subjects needed for each experiment. Furthermore, like an occlusive dressing, the chamber may enhance penetration of active compounds. Treatment with active compound for as few as four consecutive days is sufficient to provide evidence of efficacy for the treatment of psoriasiform skin inflammation.\nMaterials\nC57BL/6 female mice, 8-10 weeks old, 20-25 g\nKetamine/xylazine solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-rec-0001])\nDepilatory cream (Veet)\nAldara cream (5% imiquimod; Meda Pharma)\nVaseline\nSmall animal laboratory scale\n1-ml syringes with 27-G needles\nElectric shaver\nRubber-edged spatula\nAdjustable heating plate (Temperature Controller TMP-5a, Supertech Instruments)\n8-mm (50-mm2) Finn chambers on Scanpor tape (SmartPractice)\nForceps\nDay 0: Prepare animals\n1. Select age- and sex-matched mice with at least six animals per group.\nFemale mice are recommended because development of imiquimod-induced inflammatory skin phenotype is exacerbated in female mice.\n2. Measure body weight and calculate the amount of ketamine/xylazine solution needed for anesthesia.\nUsing the recipe provided, an i.p. injection of 100 μl solution per 10 g body weight will give the desired doses of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine.\n3. Anesthetize by i.p. injection using a 1-ml syringe with a 27-G needle. Make sure that animals are completely anesthetized (e.g., by tail pinch).\n4. Shave an ∼3 × 4–cm area on the dorsal skin using an electric shaver.",
    "5. Remove any remaining hairs with depilatory cream. Remove cream with a rubber-edged spatula, being careful to avoid even microscopic skin lacerations and abrasions. Rinse the denuded area with wet cotton pads.\nA rubber-edged spatula is best, as it will not damage the skin.\nIt is important to perform this step the day before the initial imiquimod treatment to avoid unwanted chemical interactions and to allow sufficient time for healing of any skin damage caused by depilation.\n6. Place anesthetized animals on a 37°C heating plate to maintain constant body temperature during recovery, then return to their home cages.\nDays 1-4: Induce psoriatic reaction\n7. Measure body weight and anesthetize animal as before.\nIt is important to measure body weight prior to each treatment, as it is usually slightly decreased after the first and second treatments.\n8. Place animals on a 37°C heating plate to maintain body temperature, then evaluate baseline dorsal skin thickness, blood perfusion, and scaling (see Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0002]-3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0004]).\n9. Cut out two individual circular Finn chambers per animal from the Scanpore tape, ensuring that there is sufficient adhesive surface to apply firmly to the skin.\nFinn chambers adhere to the skin most firmly if the adhesive surface of the tape is larger than the chamber and circular in shape (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/304cce36-bce7-48bc-a2e8-84b5f1b52923/cpph78-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nDesired shape and adhesive surface size of Finn chambers.\n10. Fill one chamber with 25 mg Aldara cream and the other with 25 mg Vaseline.\n11. Place Finn chambers on two discrete spots on the dorsal skin at least 2 cm apart (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-fig-0002]).\nIt is best to place the chambers on opposite sides of the animal, with one on the upper region and the other on the lower region.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5f30afba-11d0-4adb-906c-1c223c2c6ad9/cpph78-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Placement of Finn chambers on the dorsal skin of a mouse.\n12. Return mice to their cages and house normally until the next treatment.\nFinn chambers usually stay in place without taping or bandaging, although occasionally mice may pick at the chambers.\n13. After 24 hr, use forceps to gently remove the Finn chambers from the dorsal skin.\n14. Over the next three days (Days 2, 3, 4), repeat measurements and treatment (steps 7-13), placing fresh Finn chambers on the same locations as on Day 1.\nDay 5: Perform functional measurements and collect tissue samples\n15. On Day 5, repeat measurements in steps 7-8, then sacrifice animals, collect skin samples for histology (see Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0005]), and measure spleen weight (see Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0006]).",
    "A typical symptom of imiquimod-induced psoriasiform dermatitis in mice is an increase in epidermal thickness. Dorsal skin thickness should be monitored daily after anesthesia but before treatment by measuring the treated skin areas in vivo with an engineer's micrometer.\nMaterials\nMice enrolled in Finn chamber experiment (Days 1-5; see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0001])\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nEngineer's micrometer (Moore and Wright, Sheffield, England)\n1.

Place the treated area of the double-folded mouse skin between the anvil and spindle face of the micrometer. Perform thickness measurement and record.\nThe double-fold skin thickness is determined most precisely by having the anvil and spindle face touch the skin gently with little or no compression.\n3. Thoroughly wipe the micrometer with 70% ethanol after each measurement to avoid cross-contamination of imiquimod- and Vaseline-treated areas.\n4. Repeat each day of the 5-day experiment.\nIt is critical that the same areas of skin be measured each day.\n5. Express data as percent increase in skin thickness compared with Day 1 baseline values (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-fig-0003]).",
    "Increased blood perfusion (erythema) is a hallmark of inflammatory skin conditions. Here, mean perfusion of the treated skin area is quantified non-invasively using Laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) imaging. Blood perfusion should be measured after anesthesia but before treatment on each day of the 5-day experiment.\nWhen measuring blood perfusion, anesthesia must be sufficiently stable to avoid involuntary movements, which could affect the accuracy of the measurement. Additionally, body temperature must be maintained, as fluctuations in this parameter can have a significant influence on peripheral microcirculation.\nMaterials\nMice enrolled in Finn chamber experiment (Days 1-5; see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0001])\nLaser speckle contrast analysis laser Doppler (PeriCam PSI, Perimed)\nPimSoft software (Perimed, Sweden)\n1.

    "Scaling should be monitored daily after anesthesia but before treatment. The calculation of the scaling score is based on Luo, Wu, Zhao, Liu, & Wang (2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-bib-0008]).\nMaterials\nMice enrolled in Finn chamber experiment (Days 1-5; see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0001])\nDigital camera (e.g., Sony Cybershot DSCW170)\nCamera stand (e.g., Manfrotto 290)\n1.

    "An important characteristic of imiquimod-induced psoriasiform dermatitis is its ability to recapitulate the structural changes associated with human psoriatic skin. This includes an increase in epidermal thickness, the appearance of Munro's microabscesses, and tortured dilated capillaries. Semiquantitative scoring of these parameters on hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue is used to determine the severity of psoriasiform skin inflammation.\nMaterials\nMice enrolled in Finn chamber (Day 5; see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0001])\n6% formalin\nHematoxylin-eosin solution\nForceps and scissors\nMicroscope slides\nLight microscope with 20× objective\nAnalySIS software (Olympus) or similar\nAdditional reagents and equipment for standard methods of sectioning fixed tissue and staining with hematoxylin-eosin\n1. Sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation.\n2. Excise the 8-mm treated full-thickness skin tissue using sterile forceps and scissors.\n3. Fix in 6% formalin for 48 hr.\n4. Prepare three 5-µm sections from the center of the treated area on microscope slides and stain with hematoxylin-eosin according to standard procedures.\n5. Count the total number of Munro's microabscesses throughout the entire section.\n6. Determine the number of dilated capillaries present in the dermal-epidermal border of the entire section.\n7. Measure the diameter of the epidermal layer of three separate sites in the field of view using the arbitrary distance function of AnalySIS software. Repeat for up to three fields of view on each tissue section. Average the collected data.",
    "8. Set the lowest and highest data values for each measured parameter (number of Munro's microabscesses, number of dilated capillaries and thickness of epidermal layer) as the low and high reference points for that parameter, then divide the difference between them into five equal ranges. Assign each range a point value from 0 to 4, with the lowest range being 0 and highest being 4. Plot each data set separately or calculate a composite score by averaging the three different scores (Munro's, capillaries, thickness) derived from the same experimental setup (i.e., same treatment, same exposure time, etc.).\nFor an example of plotted composite scores, see Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-fig-0006].

    "One of the major problems with the original imiquimod model was the appearance of systemic side effects including splenomegaly, loss of body weight, and increased serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, complicating the interpretation of the findings. This problem is largely overcome by using Finn chambers for localized application, which significantly minimizes the amount of irritant applied to the skin. Described below are ways to measure body weight and splenomegaly to assess the presence of imiquimod side effects.\nMaterials\nMice enrolled in Finn chamber experiment (Day 5; see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.78#cpph78-prot-0001])\nSterile forceps and scissors\nAnalytical balance\n1.
