    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTiming: 15 or more days, depending on expansion methodology used\nExpansion of activated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in the presence of TGFβ1.\nThis step describes methods used to activate and expand Vγ9Vδ2 T cells over a 2 week period in serum-free medium supplemented with IL-2 and TGF-β1.\nNote: Cells expanded using the combination of IL-2 and TGF-β1 are designated γδ[T2] cells. If cells are expanded in the same way but using IL-2 alone, they are referred to as γδ[2] cells.\nNote: Our RNA sequencing data suggests that cells are not phenotypically mature at day 8 (Beatson et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). We therefore recommend completing the 15 day culture period.\nDay -1.\nAlternative (antibody activation method only): Coat 24, 12 or 6 well plates (depending on the numbers of PBMCs expected) overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C with 0.8 mg/mL pan γδ TCR antibody (11F2 or B1 clones) contained in a volume of 1 mL, 2 mL or 3 mL PBS, respectively.\nCritical: We have not tested other pan γδ TCR antibodies for their ability to stimulate the activation of these cells.\nDay 0.\nWithdraw blood (typically 45 mL) from a consenting healthy volunteer and mix with 5 mL sodium citrate in pre-prepared 50 mL Falcon tubes (stored up to 6 months at 4°C).\nNote: Alternatively, blood can be collected into sodium heparin blood collection tubes.\nGently mix blood with an equal volume of PBS (1:1 ratio).\nGently layer the blood/PBS mix (using the gravity setting on a pipette controller) on top of 15 mL Ficoll Paque Plus in 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nCentrifuge the 50 mL tubes at 750 × g for 30 min at 20°C (acceleration and brake set to 0) to separate the PBMC cell fraction.",
    "Transfer the PBMC layer, seen as an interface between the plasma and the Ficoll layer, using a sterile Pasteur pipette to a fresh 50 mL Falcon tube.\nNote: After centrifugation, the layer above the PBMC fraction which contains plasma can be carefully removed using a Pasteur pipette to make the PBMC layer easier to harvest.\nIn the 50 mL tube containing the PBMCs, add PBS to a final volume of 50 mL and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min. The acceleration and brake can be set back to 9.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant leaving the pelleted cells.\nIf more than one tube has been used (due to the volume size), resuspend the pellets in TexMACSTM+ and combine in a single tube. Bring the cells up to a final volume of 50 mL of PBS for a second wash.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet an appropriate volume of TexMACSTM+ medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] Table above; usually 10 mL per 45 mL blood).\nCritical: We have not tested other serum free media for their ability to support the expansion of γδ T-cells.\nCount live cells using trypan blue staining and a hemocytometer. Resuspend cells at 3 × 106/mL.\nNote: Samples are normally diluted 1 in 10 with PBS prior to cell counting.",
    "Alternative (antibody activation method only – to expand both δ2 and non-δ2 γδ T cells): Aspirate the antibody-containing PBS solution from plates set up in step 1. Wash each well once with PBS. Plate PBMC immediately at a density of 3 × 106 cells/mL in 4 mL TexMACSTM+ medium per well of a 6 well plate. Add recombinant IL-2 (100 U/mL) and recombinant TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL). After 72 h, remove the cells are removed from this plate.\nOR\nAlternative (zoledronic acid method only – to expand δ2 γδ T cells): Plate PBMC at a density of 3 × 106 cells/mL in TexMACSTM+ medium. Add zoledronic acid (1 mg/mL), together with recombinant IL-2 (100 U/mL) and recombinant TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL).\nNote: We do not observe consistent differences in total yield of γδ T cells achieved using the two methods although the relative proportion of non δ2 γδ T cells that expand is greater using the antibody method.\nDays 1–14.\nMonitor cell density by microscopy and cell counting every 2–3 days.\nIf cell density exceeds 1 × 106 cells/mL, add 100% TexMACSTM+ medium followed by recombinant IL-2 (100 U/mL) and recombinant TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL).\nIf cell density is below this level, add cytokines alone.\nNote: Cytokine addition is corrected to the total volume of medium present. Where necessary, split and expand cultures into additional wells on the chosen plate type, and thereafter into T75 flasks.\nDay 15.\nDetermine the purity of γδ T-cells by flow cytometry:\nTransfer a minimum of 5 × 104 γδ[2] and γδ[T2] cells into two separate 5 mL flow cytometry tubes.\nWash each tube with 2 mL FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5 mM EDTA and 1% FCS) and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 50 μL PBS.",
    "Add 5 μL anti-human γδ TCR-FITC antibody (BD Biosciences; clone B1; Cat# 559878, RRID: AB_397353 – see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to one tube containing γδ[2] and γδ[T2] cells.\nNote: Other anti-human γδ TCR antibodies suitable for flow cytometry are commercially available and may potentially be used for this step.\nAdd 5 μL FITC-conjugated isotype control to the second tube containing γδ[2] and γδ[T2] cells. Place tubes on ice for 30 min.\nWash each tube with 2 mL FACS buffer and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cells in 100–250 μL PBS.\nAnalyze using flow cytometry.\nPause point: Cells can be maintained in culture for up to day 21. In this case, continue the feeding regimen as described in step 16.\nNote: Using this method, a median purity of 92.7% γδ T cells is achieved. The lowest purity achieved at which acceptable anti-tumor activity was observed was 74.9%. Flow sorting can be used to improve purity and also to remove contaminating αβ T cells and B cells, which are undesirable impurities in the event that allogeneic γδ T cells are infused for therapeutic purposes.\nNote: Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] presents an example in which γδ[2] and γδ[T2] cells were stained with differentiation markers, CD27 and CD45RA (Dieli et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). γδ[T2] cultures generally exhibit greater viability and display a less differentiated phenotype (Beatson et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: The evaluation assays described in the sections that follow are performed independently of each other, rather than representing a sequentially timed protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1589-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Assessment of differentiation state of γδ[T2] and γδ[2] cells",
    "Cells were co-stained with anti-γδ TCR-FITC, CD27-PE and CD45RA-APC antibodies. Quadrant settings were determined using isotype controls. Note the less differentiated nature of γδ[T2] cells. CM – central memory; EM- effector memory; Term – terminally differentiated cells.\nEvaluation of in vitro real time tumor cytolytic activity of γδ[T2] cells\nTiming: Up to 6 days\nThis step describes methods used to quantify the tumor cell killing activity of TGF-β-educated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells using the xCELLigence MP impedance analyzer.\nNote: It is recommended to use tumor cell lines that have been passaged 20 times or less.\nPlate MDA-MB-231 tumor cells (2 × 104 cells each) on a 96 well electronic microtiter plate (Agilent; Cat# 300601010) in 200 μL D10 medium.\nNote: DMEM medium is available from many commercial suppliers and may be used for this step.\nAfter 24 h, pulse the cells with ZOL (3 μg/mL) or medium alone as a control.\nAfter a further 24 h, remove 100 μL medium from each well. Add γδ[T2] and γδ[2] cells in 100 μL TexMACSTM+ medium to achieve a final 1:1 E:T ratio.\nNote: Add cells gently to minimize disruption to tumor monolayers.\nPerform dynamic monitoring of adherent tumor viability/ proliferation using an xCELLigence MP impedance analyzer.\nNote: This equipment measures cellular impedance (and thereby cellular viability) in a label-free manner. The xCELLigence MP impedance analyzer can host up to six 96-well electronic microplates. The analyzer is maintained in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nA representative example of the analysis is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1589-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Real time cytolytic activity of γδ[T2] and γδ[2] cells",
    "In this example, MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were added to a 96 well electronic microtiter plate. Zoledronic acid (3 μg/mL) and either γδ[2] or γδ[T2] cells were added after 24 and 48 h respectively. Tumor cell number is normalized to the number present at the time of γδ T cell addition (“normalized cell index”).\nEvaluation of in vitro tumor cytolytic activity and cytokine release by γδ[T2] cells\nTiming: 3–5 days\nThis step describes methods used to quantify the tumor cell killing activity of TGF-β-educated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells using an MTT assay. Measurement of cytokine release by these cells by ELISA is also described.\nNote: It is recommended to use tumor cell lines that have been passaged 20 times or less.\nPlate tumor cells (1 × 105 cells each) in a 24 well microtiter plate in 1 mL D10 medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] Table above).\nAfter 24 h, pulse tumor cell monolayers with the indicated concentration of ZOL or pamidronic acid (PAM).\nNote: These are alternative aminobisphosphonate drugs that cause phosphoantigen accumulation in tumor cells, thereby sensitizing them to γδ T cells.\nAfter a further 24 h, remove half of the medium and add γδ[T2] and γδ[2] cells in 500 μL TexMACSTM+ medium to achieve a final 5:1 E:T ratio.\nAfter a further 24 h, collect 200 μL supernatant from each well for cytokine analysis by ELISA, as described by the manufacturers.\nNote: Supernatants can be harvested 24–72 h after addition of γδ T cells. While IFN-γ is readily detectable at these time points, IL-2 levels are much lower and are optimally detected at 24 h after γδ T cell addition.\nNote: Supernatants are diluted 1 in 5 to measure IFN-γ and are analyzed undiluted to measure IL-2. Follow ELISA manufacturer’s protocols to measure IFN-γ and IL-2 for this step.",

    "Critical: An icebox should be placed within a tissue culture hood to maintain sterility and low-temperature.\nAspirate the blocking solution (see step 1) from the 24 well plate and replace with 650 μL TexMACSTM+ medium per well.\nMix BME with cold TexMACSTM+ media at a 1:1 ratio on ice (within hood) using a cold 1.5 mL Eppendorf and pipette tips (keep on ice).\nNote: The volume prepared should allow for coating of the required number of Transwell inserts with 80 μL of the mixture. A small excess should be prepared to allow for losses during pipetting.\nCoat ThinCertTM inserts (6.5 mm, 3 μm pore size) with 80 μL BME/TexMACSTM+ solution using cold pipette tips and placed in rows A and D of the 24 well plate.\nCritical: Make sure the solution is spread evenly and there are no bubbles. If there are bubbles, very gently use a tip to remove, being careful not to touch the membrane of the insert. If this is not possible, take a new insert and start again.\nPlace the 24 well plate in an incubator (37°C) for at least 30 min or at room temperature (approximately 20°C–22°C) for >1 h to allow the BME to solidify.\nRemove expanded γδ[T2] and γδ[2] cells from culture into a 15 mL Falcon tube and count live cells using trypan blue and a hemocytometer.\nNote: there is no need for trypsin or any disassociation agent as the cells do not attach to plastic.\nCentrifuge expanded γδ[T2] and γδ[2] cells at 350 × g for 5 min at room temperature (approximately 20°C–22°C).

    "If antagonism of cell surface proteins is being assessed, treat γδ T cells with an appropriate blocking antibody or control in PBS prior to the start of the assay.\nNote: In the example shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], the effect of CD11a blockade has been tested, making comparison with an isotype control at the same concentration. In this example, γδ T cells are treated with 10 μg/mL of anti-CD11a or isotype control immediately prior to placement of cells in ThinCertTM.\nIf migration towards a particular factor or supernatant is being assayed, add the relevant factor to (or substitute for) medium in the appropriate well in rows B-C.

    "At predetermined time points, carefully remove the inserts from the media and place these in the corresponding columns in rows A and D of the 24 well plate.\nCount the number of cells present in the medium using a hemocytometer. It is advisable to take three measurements for each well, as there can be large variations.\nNote: A representative example of this protocol is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Comparison is made between γδ[T2] and γδ[2] cells. Inhibition of invasion by CD11a blockade has also been evaluated, implicating CD11a in this process.\nEngineering of γδ[T2] T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor\nTiming: Minimum 2 weeks (to allow for transduction and expansion of the cells)\nThis step describes methods used to engineer TGF-β-educated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor.\nNote: For vector design protocols and transient retroviral production protocols using triple transfected 293T cells, please see Larcombe-Young et al. (currently under review as a Star Protocol). Using this method, viral titer typically ranges from 5–10 × 105 viral particles/mL. Viral titer is not routinely determined prior to proceeding as described below.\nNote: Parallel (p)CAR is a recently described technology in which a second generation (CD28-containing) CAR is co-expressed with a 4-1BB containing chimeric co-stimulatory receptor. The pCAR-H/T parallel CAR co-targets MUC1 and ErbB dimers and is shown in schematic form in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]. Transduced cells are conveniently detected using anti-EGF antibody which binds specifically to one targeting moiety present in pCAR-H/T. Further details of the pCAR-H/T pCAR are provided in (Muliaditan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: this protocol is optimized for transduction of γδ[T2] cell cultures which have been cultured for 72 h on immobilized pan γδ TCR antibody (11F2 clone).\n24 h before transduction:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1589-Fig6.jpg",

Calculate how many wells are needed for each construct to be transduced.\nCritical: RetroNectin® can stick to certain plastics. Use polypropylene Pasteur pipettes to minimize protein loss during reagent preparation.\nOn the day of transduction:\nRapidly thaw 1.5 mL aliquots of viral supernatant in a 37°C water bath for the retroviral constructs of choice.\nNote: A total of 4.5 mL viral supernatant is required per 1 × 106 cells to be transduced, of which 1.5 mL will be used to pre-load the appropriate well of the RetroNectin®-coated 6 well plate.\nSpray cryovials containing viral supernatant with 70% ethanol and transfer into a laminar flow hood.\nPre-load the RetroNectin®-coated 6 well plate with viral vector by removal of RetroNectin® from each individual well and prompt addition (to avoid drying) of 1.5 mL of thawed viral supernatant.\nIncubate virus coated six well plate for 2 h or overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.",

The method can also be extended to assess tumor re-stimulation potential. This provides a measure of resistance of the CAR-engineered γδ T cells to exhaustion, induced by repeated antigen exposure (Vardhana et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nNote: It is recommended to use tumor cell lines that have been passaged 20 times or less.\nDay 1 – prepare tumor cells:\nSeed tumor cells at 1 × 105 cells in 500 μL D10 medium per well in tissue culture treated 24 well plates.\nNote: Ensure that triplicate wells are plated for each T-cell population to be tested.\nIncubate cells at 37°C & 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nNote: validate tumor cell surface expression of the target antigen(s) recognized by the CAR under study prior to co-culture experiments. In this example, firefly luciferase-expressing BxPC3 tumor cells have been used which co-express both MUC1 and multiple ErbB dimers (Whilding et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and which have limited intrinsic sensitivity to killing by γδ T-cells.\nDay 2 – prepare T cells:\nCount transduced and untransduced γδ[T2] cells.

    "Note: No cytokine support is provided for T cells during the co-culture assay.\nDay 3 (Optional) – collect supernatant for cytokine analysis as per step 31.\nDay 4 – analyze cytotoxicity.\nAdd d-luciferin at 150 mg/mL immediately prior to luminescence reading.\nMeasure luminescence using appropriate apparatus and settings.\nCalculate tumor cell viability using the following equation:\n   ( l u m i n e s c e n c e  o f  t u m o r  c e l l s  c u l t u r e d  w i t h  T  c e l l s /  l u m i n e s c e n c e  o f  u n t r e a t e d  m o n o l a y e r  a l o n e )   x  100 % .  \nTo assess tumor re-stimulation potential, repeat steps 48–51 twice per week until T cells can no longer be retrieved or less than 25% tumor cell killing occurs.\nNote: Donor to donor variation is a significant issue in performing functional studies with primary human CAR T-cells. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section. An adequate number of biological replicates are required to ensure validity of results.\nNote: Representative examples of tumor cell cytotoxicity and tumor cell re-stimulation on BxPC3 tumor cells are shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1589-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "(C) Firefly luciferase BxPC3 tumor cells were co-cultivated with untrans(duced) or pCAR-H/T transduced γδ[T2] cells. Tumor cell viability was measured after 3–4 days. If >25% tumor cell killing occurred, γδ[T2] cells were re-stimulated by transfer to a new tumor cell monolayer. Total number of successful re-stimulation cycles is shown. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired Student’s t test.\nMeasuring in vivo antitumor activity of γδ[T2] CAR T cells\nTiming: 5–16 weeks\nThis method quantifies in vivo anti-tumor activity of γδ[T2] cells in a challenging intraperitoneal (i.p.) xenograft model of pancreatic cancer, established using BxPC3 tumor cells. A representative example of such a study is shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]. Tumor cells co-express red fluorescent protein (RFP) and firefly luciferase (ffLuc), achieved by retroviral transduction and flow sorting to purity (Whilding et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Comparison is made with unmodified γδ[T2] cells that have negligible cytolytic activity against these tumor cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1589-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. In vivo anti-tumor activity of pCAR H/T-engineered γδ[T2] cells\n1 × 105 ffLuc+ BxPC3 tumor cells were injected i.p. in NSG mice. After 12 days, mice were treated with 10 × 106 untrans(duced) or pCAR-H/T transduced γδ[T2] cells, making comparison with PBS. Serial BLI emission is shown (mean +/- SD, n=3). Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired Student’s t test.\nNote: It is recommended to use tumor cell lines that have been passaged 20 times or less.\nNote: Group sizes should be determined prior to the experiment. In the example shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8], a pilot study with 3 mice per group is shown. In definitive studies, a power calculation should be performed. One suitable online tool is found at http://www.biomath.info/power/ttest.htm[href=http://www.biomath.info/power/ttest.htm] (accessed February 1st, 2022).

    "Note: To reduce bias, the experiment should be performed in a blinded fashion whereby one team member prepares γδ[T2] cells in coded tubes for administration by a blinded second team member.\nNote: All in vivo experimentation must comply with local regulatory requirements. The experiment described here was performed using the authority of the U.K. Home Office project license number P23115EBF. The content of that license had been reviewed and approved by the King’s College London animal welfare and ethical review body (AWERB).\nDay -2 – Isolate and activate PBMCs.\nPerform steps 1–17/ 44–47 to expand sufficient numbers of pCAR-H/T transduced and untransduced γδ[T2] cells for each treatment group over a 2 week period.\nNote: CAR T-cell expansion data from previous experiments is required to calculate the number of γδ[T2] cells required for each group. In general, at least 10 million transduced cells can be generated from 1 million transduced γδ[T2] cells over 10 days when validated viral vector is used for the gene transfer step.\n6–10 week-old NSG mice are used for the experiment. In general, equal numbers of male and female mice should be used.\nNote: Adequate time must be allowed for mice to acclimatize after delivery from a commercial supplier (generally up to 7 days).\nDay 1 – Establish BxPC3 human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma xenograft in NSG mice.\nTake baseline weight readings and check mice for signs of ill health prior to tumor injection.\nInject 1 × 105 ffLuc/RFP-expressing BxPC3 tumor cells suspended in 100 μL sterile PBS into all mice using the i.p. route.\nWeigh mice twice weekly and check for signs of ill health daily.",
    "Note: Mice should be humanely killed using an appropriate procedure in the event of weight loss >15%, if total tumor flux exceeds 1 × 1010 photons per second (p/s) or if tumor growth impairs normal behavior or vital function. Abdominal distention, dyspnoea, neurological dysfunction, lameness, jaundice, piloerection, hunched posture, inability to groom, inactivity, and/ or inappetence are all additional humane end points and should prompt the humane killing of the affected animal.\nDay 6 – Perform bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of mice.\nInject mice i.p. with 150 mg/kg D-luciferin.\nPlace mice into an anesthetic induction chamber (isoflurane 2.5%, with flow rate 2 L/min) until fully anesthetized.\nFifteen minutes after the D-luciferin injection, image the mice with an IVIS Spectrum Imaging platform (Perkin Elmer) with Living Image software, using the auto-exposure function.\nDetermine total flux (p/s) by creating a region of interest over each entire mouse.\nAfter imaging, return the mice to their cages and monitor until they have fully recovered from anesthesia.\nDay 11 – Perform bioluminescence imaging of mice.\nMice that have total flux values greater than the enrollment threshold (usually >1 × 107 photons/second) are distributed into treatment groups with similar average tumor burden.\nDay 12 – Inject the appropriate dose of transduced and untransduced γδ[T2] cells into each mouse using the i.p. route (10 × 106 cells in this example).\nMonitor the mice daily for signs of ill health.\nWeigh the animals twice weekly.\nNote: Reduced weight, piloerection, ruffled coat, poor appetite, and reduced locomotion can all be signs of graft versus host disease (GvHD). Animals should be humanely killed if they show these signs without improvement for 48 h; if they lose >15% of body weight or if they develop other GvHD related signs such as diarrhea (>48 h).",
    "To monitor tumor status, weekly bioluminescence imaging is performed for the duration of the study.\nMice with total flux (p/s) values reaching the humane endpoint threshold (1 × 1010 p/s) are humanely sacrificed by cervical dislocation or asphyxiation in CO2.\nTumors are fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded for future analysis.\nCritical: Prior to starting experiments, follow Perkin Elmer protocols to determine the D-luciferin kinetic curve for your model (https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/SOP_Determine_Luciferin_Kinetic_Curve.pdf[href=https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/SOP_Determine_Luciferin_Kinetic_Curve.pdf], accessed January 2nd, 2022). Because bioluminescence emission is tissue dependent, optimal timings between injection of D-luciferin substrate and imaging should be determined prior to starting experiments. Serial imaging is performed every 5 min for a total of 40 min after injection of D-luciferin substrate. Total flux is plotted against time and this curve allows the determination of an imaging time at which maximum total flux is observed (most commonly at 10–20 min post injection)."
