    "1. Handle: Design and Shaping\nSecure an Nr 10 carbon scalpel blade on a wooden board with a tape.\nTag the center of the ring under the microscope. It should be located 1.2 cm straight from the grove of the scalpel blade.\nDrill a 2 mm hole with a spherical diamond bit, mounted on a high-speed drill.\nWiden the hole with fusiform or conic diamond bits. The final diameter varies according to the rat weight as shown in Table 1.\nDesign the shape of the handle with a permanent marker.  Figures 1 and 2 can be used as stencils.\nConvert the drill into a mini bench grinder and remove the part of the blade outside the shape.\nRound off the piece with a low speed rotating brush.\n2. Approximator: Design and Shaping\nThe approximator is obtained by modifying straight surgical Klemmer's or Kocher's forceps.\nCut off half of one branch under the microscope using the high-speed mini bench grinder.\nMake symmetrical grooves on both sides to allow for the handle to slide in completely. \nCut a longitudinal slit in the long arm and check that the center of the long arm and a well-positioned handle are on a same axis. \nDesign a notch on the long arm facing the center of the handle.    \nMake the branch as thin as possible and round off the piece with the low speed rotating brush. \n3. Cuffs: Design and Shaping\nCuff calipers vary according to the rat weight and strain. By contrast, their length should be kept around 4 mm.    \nTake fine-bore polyethylene tubing and round off one edge with an Nr 10 scalpel. \nDesign a grove 0.5 mm from the edge, and carefully cut out a slope going down to the grove.",
    "Cut out one or two full-thickness nicks into the tubing. These will help manipulating the cuff during graft preparation and transplantation.\nCut the cuff at 4 mm from its edge."
