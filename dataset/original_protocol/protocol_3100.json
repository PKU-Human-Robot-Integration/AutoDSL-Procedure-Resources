    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of cells\nTiming: 1–2 days for stable exponential cell growth, 40 min of hands-on time on the day of the experiment\nIn this step, mammalian cell lines are grown, and cells are fixed using formaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 70% ethanol. 2–5 million cells are fixed to allow downstream staining with multiple probe sets and technical replicates. For one FISH-Flow reaction, 2.5 × 105 fixed cells are typically stained, however, one can use as few as 2 × 104 cells. Adjust initial harvest numbers according to cell availability.\nCulturing cells.\nSeed the ER-HoxA9 suspension mouse cell line or any suspension or adherent mouse or human cell line in 10 mL of media at a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL.\nAllow the cells to recover from any prior stress and achieve exponential growth, reaching a density of no more than 8 × 105 cells/mL (1 or 2 days).\nNote: The results of rRNA FISH-Flow are not expected to vary with passage number. However, we recommend not using cell lines after 15 passages to avoid confounding due to cytogenetic drift.\nNote: Ribosome biogenesis is exquisitely sensitive to stress, and 47S FISH-Flow signal will be affected by overcrowded or excessively sparse cultures. ER-HoxA9 cells give highly reproducible FISH-Flow results at final densities between 2–8 × 105 cells/mL. We recommend optimization of density for each cell line to reduce variability. Related to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nHarvesting cells.\nPrewarm PBS-EDTA solution in a 37°C water bath. Pre-heat the centrifuge to 37°C.\nIf cells are adherent, detach cells from the flask using trypsin treatment for 5 min at 37°C.\nTransfer 2–5 × 106 cells to a 50 mL falcon tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 37°C.",
    "Note: This step can be performed with as few as 5 × 104 cells and as many as 1 × 107 cells, and the volume of fixing and permeabilizing solution should be scaled down or up accordingly.\nNote: If working with low cell numbers, we recommend increasing centrifugation time to 10 min, gentle pipetting (not touching the cell pellet with the pipet tip), and leaving residual liquid around the pellet after aspiration.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 750 μL of pre-warmed PBS-EDTA and resolve clumps by gentle vortexing.\nTransfer to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 37°C. Discard the supernatant.\nFixing cells.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 750 μL of PBS-EDTA and add 750 μL of 3.7% formaldehyde. Mix by inverting the tubes.\nAlternatives: For this fixation step, formaldehyde can be substituted by paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# AAJ19943K2).\nIncubate in a thermomixer at 37°C for 10 min with gentle mixing at 300 rpm.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g for 2 min at 37°C. Discard the supernatant.\nPermeabilizing cells.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 750 μL of PBS-EDTA and centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 2 min at 37°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 70% ethanol and transfer to a 15 mL tube. Add 2 mL (or appropriate volume) of 70% ethanol to achieve a cell concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells / 150 μL.\nNote: All protocol steps in the section ‘preparation of cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]’ are shown in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nPause point: Fixed cells at this stage can be used immediately or stored at 4°C for up to 3 months.",
    "Critical: It is important to maintain cells at 37°C throughout this process until fixation by formaldehyde because rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis are sensitive to cold temperatures.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Related to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Steps involved in preparation of cells for rRNA FISH-Flow, related to Steps 1–4\n    \nHybridization of FISH probes\nTiming: 14–16 h\nIn this step, fixed cells are washed to remove ethanol and then hybridized with FISH probes.\nWashing cells.\nPipette out 150 μL of well-resuspended cells (2.5 × 105 cells) per reaction into a V-bottom 96-well plate. This step can be performed with as few as 2 × 104 cells.\nNote: We recommend setting up the reaction in a 96-well V-bottom plate for efficient cell pelleting and to avoid cell loss during the staining procedure. Related to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: We recommend setting up the reaction with 3 biological replicates and 2 technical replicates for each condition. Related to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 3 min at 25°C. Using multi-channel pipette aspirate and discard the supernatant.\nNote: The cell pellet at this step will be diffused and translucent.\nCritical: Throughout this protocol, remove supernatant by pipetting, and not by inverting the plate to pour it out. The latter method causes variable cell loss across wells, and leads to significant variation in FISH-Flow intensity between replicates.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 150 μL of wash buffer.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 25°C. Discard the supernatant.\nNote: The cell pellet at this step will be focused and translucent.\nHybridizing cells with FISH probes.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 50 μL of hybridization buffer containing 2 μL (25 pmol, final concentration of 0.5 μM) of FISH probes for 47S rRNA or 1 μL (12.5 pmol, final concentration of 0.25 μM) of FISH probes for 18S/28S rRNA.\nCritical: The hybridization buffer is highly viscous, and care must be taken to add the same volume of hybridization buffer containing FISH probes in every well to avoid technical variation in FISH-Flow intensity. We recommend using low-retention pipette tips and slow pipetting speed in this step. We also strongly recommend preparing a master mix of probe-hybridization buffer for the required reactions and mixing thoroughly by inverting the tube 20 times. Related to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSeal the plate using parafilm and cover with aluminum foil. Incubate at 37°C for 14–16 h in the dark in a static position (without shaking or rotation).\nCritical: This period can be reduced to 6 h, but may be accompanied by a reduction in hybridization efficiency and fluorescence signal. troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: All protocol steps in the section ‘hybridization of FISH probes[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]’ are shown in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2. Steps involved in hybridization of FISH probes, related to Steps 5–6\n    \nDAPI staining and flow cytometry\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, the cells are washed to remove excess FISH probes and stained with DAPI.\nWashing excess probes.\nAfter incubation, add 150 μL of wash buffer directly to the cell-probe suspension.\nCentrifuge at 1000 × g for 5 min at 25°C. Discard the supernatant.\nNote: The cell pellet at this step will be transparent and may not be visible.\nNote: While removing the supernatant, slightly angle the plate and aspirate from one side of the well to avoid aspirating the pellet.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 150 μL of wash buffer.\nSeal the plate using parafilm and cover with aluminum foil.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min in the dark.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 25°C. Discard the supernatant.\nNote: The cell pellet from this step onwards will be focused and visible.\nDAPI Staining.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 150 μL of DAPI working solution.\nSeal the plate using parafilm and cover with aluminum foil.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min in the dark.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 3 min at 25°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 150 μL of 2× SSC buffer.\nRepeat the above steps (8d–8e) for a total of two washes.\nPre-fill the FACS tubes with 150 μL of DPBS.\nResuspend the cells in 150 μL of 2× SSC buffer and pass through the 35 μm strainer cap of the FACS tube to make a 300 μL final suspension ready for flow cytometry.\nCritical: It is essential to pass the cell suspension through a 35 μm strainer cap to avoid clogging of the flow cytometer.\nNote: For flow cytometry, it is recommended to have cells suspended in a minimum volume of 300 μL to ensure adequate data acquisition. If using a larger number of cells (>2.5 × 105), this volume can be scaled up.\nFlow cytometry.\nUse appropriate fluorescence lasers and filters as per the conjugated fluorophore and DNA staining dye. We analyze the fluorescent signal from FISH probes (conjugated to Quasar 670) using a red (640 nm) laser and 670/14 filter, and DAPI using a UV (355 nm) laser and 450/50 filter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2873-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(A) Histograms showing fluorescence intensity profiles of 47S, 18S, and 28S rRNA relative to unstained (gray) cells. Due to the significantly greater abundance of mature rRNAs compared to nascent rRNA, flow cytometer voltage settings for acquiring 18S and 28S signal are different than those used for 47S.\n(B) Scatter plots showing single cell abundance of 47S, 18S, and 28S rRNA, along with DAPI profiles defining cell cycle stages, highlighting the ability to gate and quantify ribosomal RNA levels in specific cell populations.\nNote: Since mature rRNAs are magnitudes higher in abundance per cell than nascent rRNA, 18S and 28S FISH-Flow signals require different voltage settings compared to 47S rRNA. Fluorescence signal is acquired using an LSRFortessa flow cytometry (BD Biosciences).\nAnalyze data with flow cytometry data analysis software using FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC).\nNote: All protocol steps in the section ‘DAPI staining and flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]’ are shown in Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3.
