    "The protocol was approved and followed the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from patients for including them and the data generated as a part of this study.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nApply the following inclusion criteria.\n\t\nEnsure that the radiological examination shows three or more diseased levels.\nEnsure that the symptoms are caused by pathological changes of the cervical vertebrae with the exclusion of other systemic diseases.\nLook for hypertonia, hyperreflexia, positive pathological signs, or symptoms of upper motor neuron injury.\nApply the following exclusion criteria.\n\t\nExclude those diagnosed with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy.\nExclude patients who have undergone cervical surgery or have a history of cervical injury.\nExclude patients with a cervical tumor or inflammation.\nExclude patients with serious ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.\nAfter general anesthesia and tracheal intubation are performed, place the patient in the supine position on the operating table.\nPlace a cylindrical pillow on the back of the patient's neck to maintain the cervical spine in a hyperextension position.\nDisinfect the surgical area with iodine and alcohol, and then lay the sterile sheets over the patient.\n2. Lesion exposure\nMake a right transverse or longitudinal incision (depending on the surgeon's preference) centered on the fusion segments (localization according to body surface markers).\nUse a scalpel to cut the skin, and use an electrocoagulation electrotome to isolate the subcutaneous tissue and cut through the platysma myoides (cut the omohyoid muscle if the scope of surgery is large and there is no need to suture the muscle).\nDetermine the carotid pulse and carotid sheath location with a finger. Perform blunt dissection of the muscle medial to the carotid sheath up to the prevertebral fascia.",
    "Use a periosteal detacher to separate the muscle along the attachment points. Use a goiter retractor to pull the thyroid and tracheoesophageal structures to the patient's left side.\nUse an electrocoagulation electrotome to cut the prevertebral fascia and expose the vertebral body; then, use a cervical spreader to widen the intervertebral space.\n3. Decompression\nACDF surgery\n\t\nUse a scalpel to cut the required amount of the annulus fibrosus. Then, use a curette and a nucleus pulposus clamp to remove the nucleus pulposus until the dura is exposed. Use a laminectomy rongeur to remove the endplates and hyperplastic bone.\nUse a nerve dissector to search for potential compression, and use to remove part of the posterior vertebral body edge to make a decompression.\nInsert a properly sized interbody fusion cage filled with autologous bone into the intervertebral space.\nACCF surgery\n\t\nUse rongeur forceps to remove the vertebral body located between two diseased discs. Use a curette and a nucleus pulposus clamp to remove the two adjusted discs and endplates, similar to step 3.1.1.\nAfter the dura is exposed, use the nerve dissector to search for potential compression. Use gelatin sponges or fluid gelatin accompanied by brain cotton pieces to stop bleeding.\nInsert a properly sized titanium mesh cage filled with autologous bone into the space between the two vertebrae.\n4. Titanium plate fixation\nChoose a titanium plate of an appropriate length to cover the surgical segment. Implant six screws into the vertebrae to fix the titanium plate.\n5. Closing the incision\nUse saline to flush the surgical area, and elicit hemostasis with bipolar electrocoagulation. Fill the void by using gelatin sponges, and insert a drainage tube.\nUse an interrupted suture to close the superficial fascia and skin (size 2-0 suture material).",
    "NOTE: The suturing method can be chosen according to the operator's preference or patient's request.\n6. Postoperative care\nMeasure the blood loss through the drainage bottle each day. When the daily blood loss is less than 50 mL, the drainage tube can be removed.\nAllow the patient to walk with a separated collar support the day after surgery. Advise the patient to keep wearing the support for 1.5 months.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
