    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes all steps of cell transplantation, intracerebral brain injection of pathological tau, and magnetic isolation of human microglia for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nStereotaxic injection of PMPs into neonatal mouse brain\nTiming: 4–6 h\nAll instruments are sterilized by autoclaving or using a hot bead sterilizer. The surgery is performed in a Class II biological safety cabinet.\nPrepare the PMPs.\nCollect the supernatant from a 10 cm dish and flow through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nCollect the flow-through and centrifuge at 400 g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets in 5 mL PBS.\nCount the PMPs and add DNase (100 U/mL).\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, aspirate supernatant and resuspend the PMP cell pellet to 1 × 105 cells/μL with PBS. Keep the cells on ice till transplantation.\nCritical: The typical yield of PMPs is around 40-fold higher than the number of inputs hiPSCs. Before resuspending the PMPs cell pellet, it is recommended to perform additional quick centrifugation to remove all supernatant in order to get a more accurate dilution.\nAnesthetize P0, sex unspecified neonatal pups via hypothermia:\nPlace pups (within 24 h of birth) in protective latex sleeves.\nImmerse up to the neck in crushed ice (4°C).\nNote: A 4–5 min induction time is required.\nNote: The pups should never be placed in direct contact with ice in order to avoid frostbite of the skin.\nAfter anesthetizing (pinch the tail and no movement), fix the heads of the pups on a stereotaxic device equipped with a neonatal mouse adaptor.\nLoad the cell suspension into the Hamilton syringe (5–6 μL for each pup).",
    "Critical: It is recommended that load cells into the Hamilton syringe right before cell injection. Keeping cells in a Hamilton syringe for too long may cause significant cell death.\nThe surgical site will be treated first with an antiseptic scrub and then with an antiseptic solution (povidone-iodine scrub and solution).\nNote: This step will be repeated 3 times, and the antiseptic solution will be applied last before surgery.\nInsert the needle directly through the skull to the hippocampus injection sites (coordinates: 1.0 mm bilaterally from the midline, 2.0 mm posterior bregma, and 1.2/1.5 mm depth) using a digital stereotaxic device.\nStart the cell injection:\nThe pups are injected with 0.5 μL (50,000 in 0.5 μL PBS) of cells into each site (total of four sites),\nNote: Keep the needle at each depth (1.5 mm and 1.2 mm) for at least one minute following injection.\nAfter the cell transplantation (approximately 30 min per pup), the pups are kept on a heating pad (37°C) for about 5–10 min of recovery. The pups are returned to dams after recovery.\nCritical: Before returning the pups to the dam, it is recommended to make sure that they are warm, pink, breathing, and capable of spontaneous movements.",
    "Note: At 4–5 months post-transplantation, we recommend immunostaining with a human-specific marker expressed by microglia (hCD45) to examine the distribution of microglia (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). At 3 months post-transplantation, our slices showed a wide distribution of xenografted, hTMEM119+ human microglia in the hippocampal region (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Normally, at six months post-transplantation, about 7% of total cells are donor-derived human microglia on our previous scRNA-seq analysis of chimeric brains (Xu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). The synaptic pruning and phagocytic function of microglia can be examined by staining hTMEM119/PSD95 or hTMEM119/CD68/PSD95 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). These chimeras can be used to study functional synaptic neurotransmission by patch-clamp recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and study long-term synaptic plasticity by inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices from microglial chimeric mice at 3 months post-transplantation (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D–2G).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2152-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The surgery is conducted in a Class II biological safety cabinet, and the whole procedure is performed on a heating pad.\nSoluble tau preparation:\nDSAD tau: soluble S1 fractions containing hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) from human brain tissues collected from DS individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (DSAD), following the methods as described before (Sanchez-Mejias et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]),\nControl (Cont) tau: cont tau was collected from age- and sex-matched healthy control brain tissues.\nWeigh the mice and calculate the appropriate dose for anesthesia. Administrate intraperitoneally a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg).\nCritical: The ketamine and xylazine are diluted with 0.9% saline and mixed at the concentration of 80 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL. Then the ketamine/xylazine mixture will be injected at 0.01 mL/g intraperitoneally.\nImmediately place the animal on a heating pad to maintain body temperature after the injection of anesthetics.\nNote: The animal should reach deep anesthesia within 10 min.\nCritical: Confirm the effective anesthesia by pinching the tail.\nShave the fur on the skull and clean the skin with the iodine-based wash. Apply lubricant to their eyes.\nBefore cutting the skin, inject the bupivacaine (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously along the incision line.\nMake a straight midline incision through the skin with surgical scissors from the back of the neck to the interpupillary line and gently push aside the connective tissue on top of the skull.\nPlace the animal on the platform of the stereotaxic apparatus and fix the head with ear bars.",
    "Use the position of bregma as the reference (stereotaxic zero) of the X and Y coordinates and the defined stereotaxic coordinates (2.0 mm bilaterally from the midline and 2.5 mm posterior bregma) to mark the intended sites of injection on the skull.\nAdjust the drill to 20,000 rpm and make a single burr-hole in the skull at the injection sites.\nInjection:\nLoad the Cont or DSAD tau into the Hamilton syringe (7–8 μL at a concentration of 0.8 μg protein/μL for each 2-month-old chimeric mouse),\nPosition the syringe over the burr-hole and inject pathological tau proteins into two depths in the hippocampus (1.8- and 2.4-mm depth in both sides of the mice brain).\nCritical: The injection of the fluid should be very slow to avoid an acute increase of intracranial pressure and facilitate diffusion of the fluid (1 μL each depth, total 4 μL per mouse).\nWhen the injection is completed, allow a minimum of 1 additional minute of rest time before starting to withdraw the syringe from the brain.\nPull the edges of the skin together and suture the skin at 3 separate points. Place the animal in the temperature-controlled cage until complete recovery.\nOnce the animal recovers, the analgesic treatment may be administered.\nAfter the surgery, the injected mice will be monitored every day for the first week.\nCritical: Before tau injection, we recommend sampling chimeric mice from each batch of cell transplantation experiments to confirm the wide microglia distribution.",
    "Note: At two weeks post-injection, we observed that AT8+ p-tau was distributed widely in the mouse brains that received DSAD tau (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). To characterize the responses of human microglia to p-tau, we examined phagocytosis of p-tau by double-staining p-tau with human microglia at 1–2 months post tau injection. hTMEM119+ DS microglia engulfed a large number of AT8+ or PHF-1+ p-tau in the DSAD Tau injection group (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). In the Cont tau injection group, few p-tau was seen in DS microglia. Both control and DS microglial chimeras can be used to study the senescence of human microglia in vivo. DS exhibits premature and accelerated aging (Gensous et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Zigman, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). In line with this, in the DS chimeric brains injected with soluble tau, we usually observe senescent phenotypes such as beading with shortened processes and fragmentation morphological changes and an increased number of ferritin+/hCD45+ DS microglia at 8 weeks post-transplantation (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4F). In control microglial chimeras, a small number of control microglia displayed the senescent phenotypes at 2 months post-injection of pathological tau proteins, and significantly more were seen at 6 months post-injection of tau proteins (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G and 4H).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2152-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM.\nMagnetic isolation of human microglia from chimeric mouse brain tissue for scRNA-seq\nTiming: 4–6 h\nTo focus on hiPSC-derived human microglia for scRNA-seq, we isolate and enrich human microglia from chimeric brains by removing mouse cells using a magnetic cell sorting-based mouse cell depletion kit. This is performed by following procedures described previously (Hasselmann et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) with modifications (Jin et al., 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nAfter two months of tau injection, the mice are perfused with ice-cold PBS. Then, the whole brain is dissected, and the cerebellum is removed.",
    "Tissue dissociation is then performed utilizing the Adult Brain Dissociation Kit and the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters according to manufacturer instructions[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0011920.PDF].\nThe cell pellets from mouse brains are resuspended in 160 μL MACS buffer (0.5% BSA in 1× PBS) + 40 μL Mouse cell removal beads and incubated at 4°C for 15 min.\nThe resulting samples are then isolated using LS columns and the MidiMACS™ separator, and the human cells are collected in the flow-through.\nUsing centrifugation (10 min, 400g, 4°C), the cells are pelleted and resuspended to 1,000 cells per microliter in MACS buffer for scRNA-seq library preparation.\nNote: As shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, using this method, we isolated human microglia and performed scRNA-seq. We identified 5 clusters and all clusters highly expressed microglial markers, including C1QA, CX3CR1, TREM2, TMEM119, P2RY12, and SALL1 (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C). Compared to Cont tau group, overall DSAD tau group as well as each cluster showed a shift towards a greater senescence signature (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D). In our microglia chimeric mouse brains, there are usually a large number of human microglia (about 8% of total brain cells) (Xu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Even without any purification steps, ample numbers of human microglia can also be obtained for scRNA-seq. In this case, gene expression profile of the host mouse brain cells can be analyzed (Xu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2152-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. scRNA-seq analysis of microglial chimeras receiving an injection of soluble tau\n(A) A schematic diagram showing the design of the scRNA-seq experiment.\n(B) A UMAP plot showing independent microglia subclusters (clusters 0–4).\n(C) Dot plots showing the representative conserved microglial markers from each subcluster.",
