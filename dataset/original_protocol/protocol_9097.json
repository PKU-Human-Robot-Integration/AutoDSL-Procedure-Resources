    "1. Preparation of Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid and Intracellular Solution\nBefore starting the experiment, one needs to prepare the internal solution for the patch clamp recordings, as well as the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for the hippocampus preparation. You will furthermore need a dissection kit consisting of surgical scissor and fine iris scissor, two spatulas and forceps (Fine science tools); a glass gassing device (micro-filter candle, ROBU Germany) and tissue grid (mosquito net or nylon tight), as well as superglue (Uhu Dent). The configuration of the electrophysiology slice patch setup was described by Finkel & Bookman, 20011.    \nFor the internal solution, dissolve (in mM): 105 K-gluconate, 30 KCl, 10 HEPES and 0.3 EGTA in deionized water (in 70-80% of the final volume). Cool the solution to 4 °C and add (in mM): 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Tris and 10 phosphocreatine. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with KOH and fill up with deionized water to the final volume. (Osmolaritiy: ~ 280 mOsm). Filter this solution (pore size 0.2 μm). Aliquoted solution is stable for 3-4 weeks at - 20 °C. For one experimental day, ~ 1 ml of internal solution is needed.",
    "Unless otherwise stated, the ACSF used for hippocampus preparation and recordings of cells in the CA1 region, contains (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 1 NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3 and 11 glucose. Dissolve these salts in deionized water (Osmolarity ~ 320 mOsm) and oxygenate this solution for at least 10 min (pH ~ 7.3 - 7.4) with carbogen (95 % O2 and 5 % CO2). Prepare at least 1 liter of solution per experiment. Particular care should be taken for preparation of hippocampal tissue that will be used to perform experiments in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Indeed, this region is prone to epileptiform activity and subsequent neuronal death. Thus synaptic activity should be strongly reduced during slice preparation, and this is achieved by performing the hippocampus dissection in ice-cold sucrose solution containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 1 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 10 Glucose and 75 Sucrose. In this solution, the combination of low sodium, low calcium and high magnesium concentrations massively reduce presynaptic firing and release probability, as well as postsynaptic NMDA receptor activity, thus minimizing spontaneous activity and cell death. Once prepared, hippocampal slices used for recordings of cells from the CA3 region are perfused with modified ACSF, containing 4 mM CaCl2 and 4 MgSO4, to minimize polysynaptic activity. \n2. Acute Hippocampal Slice Preparation\nCool down ~ 300 ml of ACSF for the slicing chamber, as well as for the preparation at 4 °C, while constantly oxygenating with carbogen. Prepare a small beaker with ACSF at room temperature (RT) for slice storage, which is also oxygenated with carbogen (Scheme Figure 1).    \nAnesthetize the mouse under a hood with a small paper towel soaked with 1 ml isoflurane that is added into the cage.",
    "After the mouse is deeply anesthetized, cut the head off and add it directly into a small dish with ice-cold oxygenated ACSF. Remove the scalp with a small scissor and transfer the head onto tissue for the subsequent steps. Start to dissect the hippocampus, as illustrated and described in Figure 1. \nCut 300-400 μm thick transverse slices at low speed (3 μm/sec) and vibration frequency of 70 Hz in ice cold oxygenated ACSF, and transfer them into a storage chamber. Let the slices rest at RT for at least 1 hr prior recording. Slices for CA3 experiments are stored 25 min at 34 °C and at least 30 min at RT, to recover from the slicing process. \n3. Dual Recording of Evoked Astroglial Currents and Neuronal Field Potentials\nWe here describe how to record synaptically-evoked astroglial and neuronal responses, i.e. responses induced by synapse activation through afference stimulation using an extracellular electrode. \nConstantly perfuse the recording chamber with oxygenated ACSF (1.5-2 ml/min, RT), containing 100 μM picrotoxin (GABAA antagonist) to isolate excitatory responses. Transfer a slice onto a poly-L-lysine (1.5 to 3 mg/ml) coated coverslip, soak the liquid to achieve a good slice adhesion and add a drop of ASCF on top of the slice. Place the coverslip into the recording chamber. Blockade of inhibitory transmission by picrotoxin can result in epileptiform activity, i.e. spontaneous, synchronous firing of neuronal populations, which will distort the measurement of evoked events. Thus, to prevent epileptiform activity, make a flat cut (only the surface) between the CA1 and CA3 regions to prevent the propagation via the Schaffer collaterals (as indicated in Figure 2a).",
    "Stratum radiatum astrocytes can be identified by their small soma size (~ 10 μm) and stellate process assembly. Choose a cell at least 20-30 μm below the slice surface. Mount a glass stimulation electrode (tip resistance ~ 1 MΩ) on the silver wire that is connected to the stimulus isolation box and grounded to the bath (simply by wrapping the second silver wire around the glass pipette). Place the stimulation electrode into the Schaffer collateral region, as indicated in Figure 2A at a distance of 200-300 μm away from the chosen astrocyte. Mount the field recording electrode (~2-5 MΩ) onto a chlorinated silver wire connected to the headstage of the amplifier. Both electrodes are filled before with ACSF. Choose in multiclamp the mode I=0, which disables external command input and place the electrode ~ 50 μm away from the astrocyte into the stratum radiatum region (Figure 2A). Record the responses with Gain 2 to 10 and filter with a 2 kHz Bessel filter. Electric current injection into the brain slice triggers action potentials in the surrounding Schaffer collateral axons and subsequent transmitter release at the presynaptic terminals that project to postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal neurons. The released transmitters will trigger a positive charge flow into the cells through postsynaptic ionotropic receptors, which is measurable extracellularly as a small negative potential. This field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) integrates the activity of a group of simultaneously active neurons, while inhibitory transmission is blocked pharmacologically. Apply some test pulses (0.1 msec duration) to evoke a fEPSP; some repositioning of the stimulation electrode might help to increase the fEPSP. A typical CA1 stratum radiatum fEPSP is illustrated in Figure 2B. Further details on positioning and response waveforms can be found in Yuan et al. 20032.",
    "The fEPSP amplitude in a healthy hippocampal slice should usually be more than twice as big as the amplitude of the fiber volley. For accurate quantification of fEPSP amplitude or slope, the evoked reponse should be monosynaptic, as polysynaptic activity (detectable as a multi-peak response) indicates synaptic activity independent of the electrical stimulation, which could be a sign for hyperexcitability. For experiments performed in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, stimulation and recording pipettes are positioned as illustrated in Figure 3C. To clearly identify mossy fiber inputs, which are strongly facilitating, paired-pulse stimulation (50 msec interpulse interval) and 1 Hz stimulation for a few seconds are applied to massively enhance the initially low amplitude evoked fEPSP responses.At the end of the experiment, DCGIV, a mGluR2/3 receptor antagonist, can be washed in to further verify that indeed mossy fiber inputs were stimulated. Application of this antagonist should reduce the fEPSP by ~ 90% due to the high expression of mGluR2/3 receptors, inhibiting presynaptic release from mossy fiber boutons.",
    "Fill a patch pipette (~ 2-5 MΩ) with filtered internal solution and mount it onto a chlorinated silver wire connected to the second headstage, apply positive pressure with a syringe, which is connected via tubing to your pipette holder. Constantly apply a 20 msec test pulse of 10 mV and move the pipette into the tissue until you reach the cell surface and a deflection in the membrane becomes visible. Zero the pipette offset, remove the positive pressure, and clamp the membrane to - 80 mV. Wait until a gigaseal (at least 1 GΩ) is reached (it should not take longer than several seconds). Gentle application of some negative pressure might help to reach a gigaseal. Break into the cell is achieved by a short application of negative pressure or using the zap function in multiclamp. Start the simultaneous recording of the Schaffer collateral evoked fEPSP and the astroglial response in voltage clamp (Vhold - 80 mV; frequency 0.1 Hz, bessel filter 2 kHz, gain 10). The astroglial current response is biphasic: first you will see a fast transient outward current, reflecting fEPSPs generated by adjacent pyramidal cells. This is followed by a slowly rising and decaying inward current (persisting several seconds (> 10 sec) after termination of neuronal responses). This current is mainly due to potassium entry into astrocytes, following release by surrounding depolarized postsynaptic terminals. A simultaneously activated fast transient glutamate transporter current (GLT), triggered by presynaptic glutamate release is masked by the potassium current. The holding potential of the astrocyte, as well as the access resistance of the patch should be monitored throughout the experiment and should not vary more than ~ 20%, to avoid inaccurate monitoring of astroglial reponses due to changes in the recording conditions.",
    "Only astrocytes with an initial holding potential > -70 mV should be investigated to study healthy cells.",
    "Switch from voltage to current-clamp in order to record the evoked astrocytic membrane depolarization. Isolate the glial glutamate transporter (GLT) current by perfusion of the ionotropic glutamate receptor blocker kynurenic acid (5 mM), until the fEPSP is fully blocked and the GLT amplitude has reached a plateau. To clearly identify the GLT current, apply the specific antagonist DL-threo-β-Benzyloxyaspartatic acid (DL-TBOA, 200 μM). Increase the stimulation strength by 2-fold to 5-fold to record neuronal and astroglial responses at different synaptic strength, and apply two closely spaced stimuli (50 msec interval) to investigate responses to paired pulse stimulation. Stability of series resistance and membrane potential of the glial cell should be monitored throughout the recording. \nTo visualize the extent of the gap-junction mediated astroglial networks, dye-coupling experiments should be performed in current clamp mode, without any current injection, to enable passive diffusion of low molecular dyes (< 1.5 kDa), such as sulforhodamine-B, through gap junction channels. To minimize dye spillover into the surrounding tissue, positive pressure should be applied through the patch pipette just when entering the tissue and the patch should be reached as soon as possible."
