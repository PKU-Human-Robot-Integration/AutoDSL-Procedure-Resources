    "Part I: Protocol for cultured cells Fixation Fix cells (18 mm coverslips, coated for optimal cell growth as desired) for 10 min at 37 °C using pre-warmed fixative. Fixative may be 4% PFA, 4% PFA + 0.1% glutaraldehyde (GA) for preservation of membranes, -20 °C MeOH, or extraction as described in Damstra et al. (2022).Wash with PBS twice.If no permeabilization will be performed (e.g., if no immunofluorescence IF labeling will be performed), permeabilize for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature (RT) (this is important to ensure gel spans membranes fully), followed by washing with PBS three times.IF (optional, most standard IF methods may be used) Block with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT.Incubate with primary antibodies in 3% BSA in PBS for 1–3 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C.Wash with PBS three times.Incubate with secondary antibodies in 3% BSA in PBS for 1–3 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C.Wash with PBS three times.Anchoring Incubate with 0.1 mg/mL AcX in PBS overnight at RT or 0.2 mg/mL for 1 h at RT.For AcX stock solution, dilute 5 mg of AcX in 500 μL of anhydrous DMSO (10 mg/mL), aliquot, and store at -20 °C (dilute a 20 μL aliquot in 2 mL of PBS just prior to use).Gelation Assemble gelation chamber [parafilm-covered glass slide and silicone ring (13 mm diameter)] and pre-chill on ice (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4698/bioprotoc-13-12-4698-g001.jpgFigure 1. Gelation chamber before (left) and during gelation (right). Gelation chamber consists of a parafilm-covered glass slide and a silicon spacer that is held in place by binder clips. The gelation chamber is formed when the coverslip that contains the cells is placed cell-side down on the silicon spacer (right) ensuring contact with the gelation solution.",
    "Prepare monomer solution [gelation solution (see Recipes) without the APS and TEMED] and keep on ice. Monomer solution can optionally be aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. When using an aliquot, please ensure the aliquot is fully thawed at RT because acrylamide has reduced solubility at low temperatures.Wash cells with PBS once.Add TEMED and APS to the monomer solution to form gelation solution, vortex thoroughly, and put back on ice.Transfer 170 μL to the chamber (pipette directly on the parafilm), tap the side of coverslip on a tissue to remove excess PBS, and put cells down on the monomer solution to close the chamber. Transfer directly to the incubator set at 37 °C for 1 h (Figure 1).Homogenization Gently remove gels from the gelation chamber and transfer to a 12-well plate. At this point, the gel typically remains attached to the coverslip. The gel will spontaneously separate from the coverslip during either enzymatic or non-proteolytic homogenization. For enzymatic digestion: add 2 mL of digestion buffer (see Recipes) and digest for 4 h at 37 °C. Optional: add DAPI to digestion buffer.Depending on the experiment, a non-proteolytic disruption (3 h incubation in 5% SDS, 200 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 at 80 °C) or a hybrid disruption and digestion approach can be used to increase the amount of protein retained after digestion (see below). For staining with general protein stains in combination with digestion, we typically wash the gel twice for 15 min with PBS, incubate with 20 μg/mL of fluorescently labeled NHS-ester or maleimide for 1.5 h at RT, and then proceed with digestion. When using disruption or a hybrid approach to increase the number of accessible residues for labeling, general protein stains can be added after the disruption step.",
    "Expansion Transfer gel to a 15 cm dish and completely fill with water (Milli-Q). Exchange water at least twice after 30 min and leave overnight at RT to expand (Figure 2a).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4698/bioprotoc-13-12-4698-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Scale bars: (a) 0.5 cm, (b) 5 cm.Part II: Protocol for expanding tissue Perfusion and post-fixation Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4% formaldehyde in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde between 2 h and overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing with PBS and slicing by vibratome at 100–300 μm.Wash with PBS twice.If no permeabilization will be performed (e.g., for IF), permeabilize for 30 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT (this is important to ensure gel spans membranes fully), followed by washing with PBS three times.IF (optional, most standard IF methods may be used) Block with blocking buffer (2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) at RT for 30 min to 2 h.Incubate with primary antibodies in blocking buffer at RT for several hours to several days.Wash with blocking buffer four times for 30 min.Incubate with secondary antibodies in blocking buffer at RT for several hours to several days.Wash with blocking buffer three times for 30 min and with PBS once.",
    "Anchoring Treat tissue slices with 0.1 mg/mL AcX in PBS overnight or 0.2 mg/mL for 1 h.For AcX stock solution, dilute 5 mg of AcX in 500 μL of anhydrous DMSO (10 mg/mL), and store at -20 °C (dilute 20 μL aliquot in 2 mL of PBS just prior to use).Wash with PBS.Gelation Unlike for cultured cells, tissue slices must be incubated with gelation solution (including APS, TEMED, and the radical inhibitor 4HT to delay the onset of gelation; see Recipes) to ensure the monomer solution can completely diffuse through the tissue. Prepare monomer solution (gelation solution without APS, TEMED, or 4HT), which can optionally be aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. When using an aliquot, please ensure the aliquot is fully thawed at RT because acrylamide has reduced solubility at low temperatures.For the gelation chamber, place four dabs of vacuum grease on a glass slide, spaced to coincide with the corners of a glass coverslip.On ice, add gelation solution to the specimen and incubate on ice for 20 min while shaking.Remove excess gelation solution and transfer the specimen to glass slide in the middle of the dabs of vacuum grease. To seal the chamber, place a glass coverslip on top of the dabs of vacuum grease and gently press down until the coverslip contacts the tissue.Gently pipette gelation solution in excess from the side, making sure the specimen remains at least ~3 mm away from air or silicone grease, and transfer directly to incubator set at 37 °C for 1 h.Homogenization Gently remove gel from gelation chamber by teasing the coverslip off with a razor blade and tweezers.Trim the gel close to the specimen and wash once in PBS for 5 min.Disrupt with proteinase K as with cultured cells.Wash with PBS four times for 30 min each.",
    "To preserve the most total protein for NHS-ester staining, the anchoring and disruption steps may be reduced in strength, though potentially at the cost of reduced expansion isotropy between different subcellular structures. For example, both the AcX and proteinase K concentrations can be reduced ~10-fold, with the digestion step followed by high-temperature non-proteolytic disruption with SDS, by transferring the gel to an excess volume of disruption buffer and incubating for 3 h at 80 °C.If cracks appear in the specimen upon expansion, increasing the proteinase K concentration or time in disruption buffer may help. If cracks persist, increasing the temperature of disruption buffer treatment (e.g., to 90 °C) can greatly increase the strength of disruption. The original ExM disruption method using proteinase K diluted 1:100 in buffer containing guanidium can also be tried if more aggressive digestion is needed. To add sub-cellular context, disrupted specimens may be stained with NHS-ester dyes, e.g., Atto594 or Alexa488, diluted to 20 μg/mL in 1× PBS for 1 h at RT.Expansion Transfer gel to a 6-well plate or 15 cm dish, wash with water for 30 min at least three times, and leave overnight at RT to expand. Keep covered to protect from acidification due to CO2 in room air."
