    "1. Preparation of the system\nConnect the MALS and dRI detectors downstream of the FPLC's UV detector. Bypass the pH and conductivity detectors since they will add significant interdetector volume between the UV and MALS detectors. Use capillary tubing of 0.25 mm i.d. from the column to and between the detectors, and 0.75 mm i.d. capillary tubing on the output of the detectors to waste or fraction collector.\nEnsure that the necessary signal connections between the FPLC and detectors have been established, including analog output from the UV detector to the MALS analog input, and digital output from the FPLC to the MALS Autoinject, via the FPLC's I/O Box.\nInstall a suitable analytical SEC column covering a fractionation range of at least 20 kDa to 500 kDa. Check the product info to determine if the column is suitable for the range of MW, pH and other properties of the sample and mobile phase.\n2. Preparation of buffer, f lushing the system overnight and checking cleanliness\nUsing HPLC-grade reagents, prepare 1 L of phosphate-buffered saline with 50 - 100 mM NaCl. Filter the buffer to 0.1 µm using a bottle-top polyether sulfone filter or similar. Filter the first 50-100 mL of buffer to a waste bottle and discard, in order to eliminate particulates from the dry filters, and then filter the remainder to a clean, sterile bottle that has been washed thoroughly with filtered, de-ionized water and capped to prevent dust from entering.\n\tNOTE: Other mobile phase solvents such as a Tris buffer may be used if additional proteins that are preferentially dissolved in those solvents are to be analyzed.",
    "Flush overnight at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, or as otherwise recommended by the column manufacturer, to equilibrate the column in the buffer and remove particulates. Use the FPLC's Continuous flow mode and ensure that the flow does not stop until all SEC-MALS runs are complete.\n\t\nPlace the dRI flow cell in Purge mode during the overnight flush. Turn the purge off before beginning sample runs.\nWhen beginning the flush, gradually ramp the flow rate to prevent \"column shedding\" effect (or release of particles) caused by a sudden change of pressure in the column.\nIf the system is known to be quite stable and particle-free, and in equilibrium with the desired mobile phase, replace the overnight flush with a shorter, 2-3 h flush.\nCheck system cleanliness by lightly tapping the tubing downstream of the column to release accumulated particles and observing the signal in the 90° detector on the front-panel display of the MALS instrument. Verify that the peak-to-peak noise is no more than 50 -100 µV.\nPerform a 'blank' injection to verify that the injector is clean of particles. A 'blank' is simply the running buffer, prepared in a fresh, sterile vial.\n\t\nIf the particle peak is no more than 1 mL in volume and no more than 5 mV above baseline, then the system is ready for samples. Otherwise, perform additional blank injections until clean, or perform maintenance to clean the injector.\n3. Preparing and loading the sample\nPrepare at least 200 µL of BSA at 1-2 mg/mL in the SEC buffer.\n\tNOTE: In order to prevent precipitation, BSA should never be dissolved in pure water.\nFilter the protein to 0.02 µm using a syringe-tip filter.\nDiscard the first few drops of filtrate in order to eliminate particles from the dry filters.",
    "Alternatively, centrifuge the sample at 10,000 x g for 15 min to enable precipitation of non-soluble aggregates and other large particles.\nInject 100 µL of the BSA solution into the loop.\n\tNOTE: This is the recommended amount of material, and more or less may be injected according to circumstances of the sample such as stability or availability. The quantity of protein required per injection varies inversely with molecular weight - twice as much protein mass is needed if the molecular weight is 33 kDa, or half that of BSA.\n4. Preparation of the MALS software\nOpen New | Experiment from Method in the MALS software menu and select the Online method from the Light Scattering system methods folder. If a DLS detector is present, select the Online method from the Light Scattering | With QELS folder.\nIn the Configuration section, set parameters of the sample and mobile phase.\n\t\nIn the Generic Pump view, set the flow rate to that used in the FPLC.\nIn the Generic Pump view, Solvent branch, Name field, select PBS.\nIn the Injector view, Sample branch, enter the Name as BSA, and set dn/dc = 0.185 (the standard value for unmodified proteins), A2 = 0, and UV extinction coefficient = 0.667 mL/(mg-cm).\n\t\tNOTE: For other proteins, the UV280 nm extinction coefficient may be found in the literature or calculated from its sequence using various public-domain software tools.\nIn the Procedures section, Basic Collection view, select the checkbox Trigger on Autoinject and set the duration of the run to 70 min so that data are collected for the entire elution until the total permeation volume of the SEC column is reached.",
    "NOTE: The necessary amount of time may vary with column and flow rate - 35 min of collection are required for a standard 7.8 mm x 300 mm HPLC-SEC column at 0.5 mL/min.\nStart the experiment in the MALS software by clicking on the Run button. It will start reading the data after receiving the pulse signal from the FPLC instrument via the MALS detector.\nZero the dRI signal by clicking the Autozero button on the instrument's front panel.\n5. Preparation of the FPLC software\nInsert the name of protein and the run in the FPLC software, in Manual | Execute manual instructions | Set mark.\nSwitch the injection valve from Manual load to Inject under Flow path | Injection valve.\nInclude a pulse signal by inserting a 0.5 s pulse under I/O box | Pulse digital out. This will trigger data collection in the MALS software.\n6. Inject the sample into the loop. Click Execute in the FPLC software to start the experiment run.\n7.Analysis of SEC-MALS BSA data\nPerform analysis, step by step, under the Procedures section in MALS software.\n\t\nVerify that peaks appear, at approximately the same elution volume in UV, MALS and RI, by checking the Basic Collection view.\nIn the Baseline view, define baseline for all signals (all LS detectors, UV and dRI). The baselines should be defined to indicate the level of pure solvent, preferable stretching from one side of the sample peaks to the other.\nIn the Peaks view, define the peaks to be analyzed by clicking and dragging the mouse. Select the central 50% of each peak. First select the monomer peak ('Peak 1') and then the dimer peak ('Peak 2'). Verify correct values of dn/dc = 0.185 and UV 280 nm extinction coefficient = 0.667 for BSA under each peak.",
    "Perform peak alignment, band-broadening correction and normalization procedures.\n\tNOTE: Normally the SEC-MALS method is periodically calibrated for peak alignment, band broadening and normalization of the angular detectors to the 90° detector using a monodisperse protein with radius of gyration Rg < 10 nm such as BSA monomer. In this example, BSA serves both as the calibration molecule and is itself the subject of MW analysis.\n\t\nIn the Procedures | Alignment view, select the central region of the peaks by clicking and dragging the mouse, click Align Signals and then OK.\nIn the Procedures | Band Broadening view, choose the central 50% of the monomer peak. Make sure the RI detector is specified as the Reference Instrument, then click Perform Fit and Apply to match the UV and LS signals to the RI signal.\n\t\t\nZoom in to the peaks to verify that they overlap very closely within the central 50-70%, then click OK.\nIf the overlap is not perfect, (it may be necessary to) perform the fit and \"Apply\" one or two more times until the overlap is excellent.\nIn the Procedures | Normalization view, select Peak 1, enter 3.0 nm as the Rg value, click Normalize then OK.\nIn the Procedures | Molar Mass and Rg from MALS view, review the data to determine which, if any, detection angles should be deselected from the analysis due to excessive noise. Typically, these will be the lower angles into which dust particles scatter a relatively high intensity. Select individual slices within the peaks from the graph on the right and view the angular dependence of the inverse reduced Rayleigh ratio in the graph on the left. If the lowest (and sometimes the highest) angles consistently deviate greatly from the fit, then deselect them from the list at the bottom of the view.",
    "View the graph of the results in the EASI Graph view. Select Molar Mass from the Display drop-down at the top of the window. Use Ctrl + click and drag to zoom in on the peak region.\nView the final tabulated weight-average molar mass results for the monomer and dimer peaks in the Results | Report (summary) view under Peak Results | Molar mass moments (g/mol) | Mw. Purity is reported under Peak Results | Mass fraction(%).\n\tNOTE: Other molar mass moments are also shown; these are usually relevant to heterogeneous polymers, but not to proteins with discrete sizes. Many other results produced by the software may be included in the report such as percent mass recovery (the fraction of protein that eluted via the concentration detector relative to the amount injected), peak statistics, polydispersity, Rg and Rh moments, etc. When provided, the measures of uncertainty reflect the precision of the value cited based on the noise within the measurement series and should not be considered to represent the accuracy. The true accuracy of the reported values depends on various factors such as the accuracy of the provided dn/dc and extinction coefficient values, instrument calibration, etc.\nFrom the File menu, select Save as Method and save the analyzed BSA data as a standard method for future measurements of all types of proteins. The normalization and band-broadening parameters determined for BSA will be carried over in the analysis."
