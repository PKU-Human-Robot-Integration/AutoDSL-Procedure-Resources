    "1. Culture of C. jejuni 11168H and extraction of total proteins\nNOTE: C. jejuni 11168H is a hypermotile clonal derivative of NCTC 1116812.\nStart the cell culture by rehydrating the cell pellet (approximately 0.15 g, NCTC) with approximately 5 mL of Mueller-Hinton culture medium. Use several drops of the primary broth tube to inoculate a Mueller-Hinton agar plate. Incubate at 37 °C for 18 h under a microaerophilic atmosphere, i.e., 5% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2.\nHarvest bacterial lawns with 1 mL of Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. Dilute the harvest to reach approximately 1 x 105 c.f.u./mL with BHI broth. Grow cells for 18 h with shaking (100 rpm) in a microaerophilic atmosphere at 37 °C.\nCool the cells by putting the plates on ice for 10 min and harvest cells by centrifugation (4,500 x g at 4 °C). Discard the supernatant and wash the cells 2x in 3 L of ice-cold 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8).\nResuspend cells (108-1011 C. jejuni cells) in 8 mL of ice-cold 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and lyse by sonication (Table of Materials). Perform sonication as follows: 4 s pulse, 1 s off, 1 min each time and three times total.\nCentrifuge at 9,500 x g for 45 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant to another tube. Dialyze proteins in the supernatant 2x against 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 3 h.\nDetermine the protein concentrations with a commercially available Protein Assay13 (should be in a range from 4 to 6 µg/µL).",
    "Dissolve 1 mg of proteins in 1 mL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and add 2.5 mg of Pronase E to the solution. Incubate at 37 °C for 48 h, followed by boiling the solution at 100 °C for 5 min to deactivate the enzyme.\nStore the protein digest solution at -80 °C for further use.\n2. Purification using porous graphitic carbon (PGC)\nActivate PGC cartridges (100 mg, 5 mL) by adding 1 mL of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1 % trifluoacetic acid (TFA) and repeat 2x.\nWash the PGC cartridge with 1 mL of water 3x.\nLoad the Pronase E digestion from 1 mg of protein on PGC (volume is dependent on protein concentration).\nWash the cartridge 3x with 1 mL of water each time to remove salts.\nElute Asn-glycans with 1 mL of 25% ACN in 0.1 % TFA, followed by 1 mL of 50% ACN in 0.1 % TFA.\nPool both fractions and dry the samples with the refrigerated vacuum concentrator (Table of Materials) for further processing.\n\t​NOTE: Use MS grade solvents for Asn-glycan purification.\n3. Permethylation of Asn-glycans\nSolubilize dried Asn-glycans with 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a 1.5 mL tube.\nPrepare DMSO-NaOH slurry by mixing two pellets of NaOH with 2 mL of DMSO. Add 200 µL of DMSO-NaOH slurry and 100 µL of methyl iodide to the sample.\nCap the tube tightly and stir at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature with a vortex mixer.\nQuench the permethylation by adding 1 mL of water.\nAdd 1 mL of chloroform and vortex for 1 min to extract permethylated Asn-glycans.\nCentrifuge at 9,000 x g for 3 min. Remove the supernatant and keep the lower chloroform phase with permethylated Asn-glycans.",
    "Wash the organic layer by adding 1 mL of water with vortexing for 1 min. Centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 3 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat 2x.\nPlace the organic phase in a fume hood and let it dry with a nitrogen stream at room temperature.\nStore permethylated Asn-glycans at -80 °C for mass spectrometric analysis.\n4. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) and ESI-MS/MS analysis\nDissolve permethylated Asn-glycans in 20 µL of 50% 2-propanol in water (v/v).\nPerform CE-ESI-MS analysis using a 90 cm bare fused-silica capillary with a sheath flow of 50% 2-propanol in water at 1 µL/min.\n\tNOTE: CE-MS is a system that combines capillary electrophoresis (CE) and a mass spectrometry. CE separate ions based on their ion mobility. In this protocol, the CE system is employed to introduce minute volume of samples and perform on-line desalting.\nSet the ESI voltage at 5 kV in positive mode.\nLoad permethylated Asn-glycan samples at 500 mbar for 0.2 min, corresponding to approximately 100 nL.\nAcquire MS data using a mass spectrometer (Table of Materials) using the following acquisition parameters.\n\t\nFor full MS, set dwell time at 2.0 ms per step of 0.1 m/z unit. In the MS2 and MS3 experiments with enhanced product ion scan (EPI), set the scan speed to 4,000 Da/s, with Q0 trapping. Set the trap fill time as Dynamic and the resolution of Q1 as Unit. For MS3 experiments, set the excitation coefficient to make sure that only the monoisotopic peak for a single charged precursor is selected. Set the excitation times at 100 ms.\n5. Analysis of permethylated glycans by MALDI-TOF MS\nDissolve permethylated Asn-glycans in 10 µL of 50% methanol/water (v/v).\nMix 1 µL of dissolved Asn-glycans with 2 µL of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid solution (10 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/water (v/v)).",
    "Add 1 µL of mixed sample to a 384-well MALDI plate and wait until the sample is completely dried.\nInsert the plate into MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm). Set the accelerating voltage at 20 kV in the positive mode.\nSet laser power to an arbitrary scale of 6,000 and acquire data in positive reflectron mode from m/z 1,000 to 5,000.\nSubscription Required.
