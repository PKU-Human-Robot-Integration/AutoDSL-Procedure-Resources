    "For large DNA fragments, such as BAC clones, start from step 6. If input DNA is small and composed of multiple pieces, such as individual PCR products, purified DNA pieces are quantified by a NanoDrop 2000 and pooled in an equal molar ratio.If using an input pool of multiple pieces of DNA, randomly ligated larger products are then generated using T4 DNA ligase in excess. Specifically, for each μg of DNA, the DNA pool are ligated with 4,000 U of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in a 50 μl reaction for 3 h at 37 °C. We start with ~20 μg total DNA that has 5’-phosphate groups. Note: This step has been added to avoid biasing against regions located near the ends of input DNA pieces (because we perform a size selection after this fragmentation step, and sequences close to the ends would be represented by very small fragments after fragmentation, and thus would be under-represented in the final library).If directly using PCR products, perform a kinase reaction prior to ligation using T4 polynucleotide kinase (TPK). Specifically, we followed the manufacture NEB’s protocol of a reaction consisting of 300 pmol of PCR DNA, 5 μl of 10x buffer, 5 μl of 10 mM ATP, and 1 μl (10 U) of T4 PNK, supplemented with distilled water to total 50 μl, The reaction is incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by inactivation at 65 °C for 20 min. DNA in the phosphorylation reaction is then purified by QIAGEN PCR DNA purification kit and eluted in 50 μl of distilled water prior to ligation.Run 10 μl or 200 ng of ligation products on 1% agarose gel with 0.",
    "5 μg/ml ethidium bromide in 1x TAE buffer, in order to check sizes of ligation products (usually > 10 kb on average). The ligated large amount of DNA is purified by ethanol precipitation. Add 10% volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol; mix and then precipitate in -20 °C for one hour; spin down using a pre-cooled microcentrifuge for 10 min, wash with 70% ethanol; air dry for one minute; and re-suspend in 150 μl water. To generate random DNA fragments, ~14 μg of the input DNA (ligated if originating from multiple pieces) in 120 μl of water is sonicated in a S220 Focused-ultrasonicator for 90 sec to result in fragments peaking at sizes of 400-450 bp (Peak Power = 140 V, Duty Factor = 5, Cycle/Burst = 200 and Average Power = 7). Run at least 2-4 μl (250-500 ng) DNA using 1 kb Plus DNA standard (Invitrogen) on 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide to check peak sizes of fragmented DNA (Figure 1A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615021309_8241.jpgFigure 1. DNA gel examples of critical steps in Molecular Chipper procedure. A. Sonicated DNA (2-4 μl or 250-500 ng) in step 6 was visualized on 2% agarose gel with the help of 250 ng of 1 kb Plus DNA standard, showing peak fragment size of 400-450 bp. B. 5 μl (~200 ng) of DNA fragments ligated to adaptor in step 9 was visualized on a 4% LMP agarose gel with 10 bp DNA standard, showing formation of adaptor dimer and trimer and ligated DNA fragment at higher molecular weight. C. The total ligation in step 9 was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel to visualize and to recover ligated DNA fragments in 200-1,000 bp linear DNA range, as detailed in step 10. D.",
    "Adaptor-ligated DNA fragments were digested with EcoP15I to release the 38-bp DNA ends and loaded onto 4% LMP agarose gel to purify the 38-bp DNA pool, as detailed in step 11. E. The full-length sgRNA pool digested with BamHI and HindIII was loaded onto 4% LMP agarose gel to view and purify the 115-bp sgRNA DNA pool, as detailed in step 15. Note: the ~115-bp DNA band appears faint due to high background.Sonicated fragments are repaired in a 150 μl End Repair reaction with 15 μl of the NEBnext End Repairing Enzyme Mix, 30 μl of NEBNext End Repair Reaction 10x buffer, supplemented with distilled water to total 300 μl and react at 25 °C for 30 min, followed by 1% agarose gel purification of the 400-450 bp DNA fragments (visualized with 1x SYBR Safe in the gel by a blue-light gel dock, such as the Maestrogen Illuminator, in order to avoid DNA damage under UV light especially short-wave UV light that is usually available in labs, when ethidium bromide is used to visualize DNA) by using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit. To obtain fragment ends from both ends of the random DNA fragments, an EcoP15I-adaptor is first prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides aaaactcgagcagcagtggatccG and /5phos/Cggatccactgctgctcgag (IDT) in equal molar ratio in 1x ligation buffer (NEB) at 10 μM by heating up to 95 °C and then gradually decreasing temperature by 1 °C per minute to 25 °C in a PCR machine or by incubating in boiled water cooling down gradually to room temperature. The annealed DNA adaptor contains an EcoP15I site (in bold) followed by a total 8-bp spacer, including a BamHI site (underlined) and a G (capitalized) at the end for later sgRNA cloning to serve as transcription start site from the U6 promoter.",
    "~12 μg of the DNA fragments are ligated, at a ~1:10 molar ratio to 6.0 μg of the above annealed EcoP15I-adaptor with 20,000 U T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in 300 μl reaction for 3 h at 37 °C. Run 5 μl of ligation on 4% low melting point (LMP) gel with 10-bp DNA standard (Invitrogen) to confirm successful ligation by visualizing formation of 44-bp adaptor dimer (we also saw trimer formation) and the presence of higher MW DNA (Figure 1B). The adaptor-ligated DNA fragments in 200-1,000-bp linear standard range are purified from adaptor monomer and other non-specific bands by running them on a 1% agarose gel with NEB 100 bp DNA ladder (Figure 1C) and by using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit. 1% gel is important to minimize gel volume to increase yield. ~5 μg of the EcoP15I-adaptor-ligated gel-purified DNA is digested by 100 U of EcoP15I enzyme (New England Biolabs) in 300 μl reaction with specified buffer and ATP concentration for exactly 1 h at 37 °C. To check completeness of digestion and efficiency of adaptor ligation in step 9, run 15 μl of the digestion with 10 bp DNA standard (Invitrogen) on 4% low-melting-point agarose gel with ethidium bromide to visualize the 38 bp (expecting ~25-50 ng of the 38 bp DNA fragment; Figure 1D).After digestion, EcoP15I digestion reaction is cleaned by equal-volume sequential phenol/PCI/chloroform extractions and centrifugation at 18,400 x g for 5 min after each extraction, to get rid of EcoP15I protein bound to DNA potentially. The upper phase is always collected during repeated extraction. The final supernatant is precipitated with ethanol by adding 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.",
    "7, and 2-volume of 100% ethanol to precipitate DNA, centrifuging at 18,400 x g for 10 min and washing DNA pellet with 70% ethanol, air-dried and finally re-suspended the DNA pellet in 50 μl of distilled water. Precipitated digestion products are gel-purified (on 4% low-melting-point agarose gel) to obtain a ~38-bp DNA fragment pool (EcoP15I-adaptor + 19/17 bases from ends of random DNA fragments) by diluting the gel slice with 2 volumes of 1x TAE buffer, melting the gel slice at 70 °C on a heating block, extracting by phenol/PCI/chloroform and dissolving DNA in 20 μl water. To ligate to the rest of sgRNA backbone, 280 ng of the purified 38-bp DNA pool is ligated in 50 μl reaction with 4,000 U (New England Biolabs, M0202T) of T4 DNA ligase for 3 h at 37 °C, at a 1:5 molar ratio to 2.75 μg of a sgRNA-backbone-adaptor. The sgRNA-backbone-adaptor contains two Ns for binding to overhangs from EcoP15I digestion products, the remaining sgRNA sequence (without the target-recognition domain), a polyT stretch for polymerase III transcriptional termination, and a HindIII site for cloning. This sgRNA-backbone adaptor was prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides below, followed by 4% low-melting-point agarose gel-purification, by using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit, to eliminate improperly annealed products. Two oligonucleotides: /5phos/nngttttagagctagaaatagcaagttaaaataaggctagtccgttatcaacttgaaaaagtggcaccgagtcggtgc-tttttttaagctttat ataaagcttaaaaaaagcaccgactcggtgccactttttcaagttgataacggactagccttattttaacttgctatttctagctctaaaac (IDT). See step 8 for details of annealing the two oligonucleotides to prepare for the sgRNA-backbone adaptor DNA.The ligated sgRNA DNA pool is cleaned by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, digested in 50 μl with 20 U each of BamHI and HindIII (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37 °C, and gel-purified by running with 10 bp DNA standard (Invitrogen) on 4% low-melting-point agarose (Figure 1E) and by using the MiniElute Gel Extraction Kit to obtain a ~115-bp sgRNA pool.",
    "The 115-bp DNA band on gel usually appears faint due to high gel background when running large ligated DNA amount.This sgRNA pool is quantified by SYBR Safe Gel Stain (Invitrogen) on a fluorometer (total ~10 ng sgRNA pool DNA generated from starting material specified in step 9), and ligated at 3:1 molar ratio with 40 U of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) per 100 ng total DNA per 10 μl reaction at room temperature overnight into BamHI-HindIII sites of a retroviral vector pSUPER-CRISPR which contains a U6 promoter and a puromycin selection marker (Cheng et al., 2016b). The ligated DNA is ethanol precipitated (see step 4 for details) and dissolved in 10 μl water.Ligation products are transformed into NEB5 alpha competent cells in 30 μl aliquots by electroporation using a GenePulser Xcell. The transformed cells from 10 electro-transformations are then pooled together, grown in 10-ml LB medium for 1 h. Several small fractions of transformation are plated to estimate total transformed clones. To estimate the % cloning efficiency, 10-20 colonies are grown up to miniprep DNA using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, and the cloned sgRNA inserts are confirmed by Sanger sequencing using oligo nucleotide ctccctttatccagccctca. We found that about 80% clones have 19-20 mer sgRNAs cloned. The other 20% clones have much shorter sgRNAs cloned, likely due to non-specific cleavage activity of the EcoP15I enzyme.The transformation culture is grown overnight in 100 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg ml-1 of ampicillin for plasmid DNA preparation. Properly prepared, a library of > 1 million clones can be easily achieved.For retrovirus preparation, an example of functional reporter screen, sgRNA enrichment data analysis to identify functional non-coding genomic regions, and examples of mechanistic studies, see our previous publication (Cheng et al., 2016b)."
