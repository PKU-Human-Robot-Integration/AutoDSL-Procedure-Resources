    "Note: The cell stimulation cocktails used in this step can influence the expression of several surface markers (please refer to troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] for more details).\nOptional: Cell-ID cisplatin can be replaced by cell-ID intercalator-Rh (Cat#201103A).\nFixing cells\nTiming: 30 min\nCell fixation is very important for cell preservation and subsequent surface and intracellular staining because of the long-time span of clinical sample collection. Before fixation, the CSB should be prepared at 24°C and ice-cold separately.\nAdd 1 mL of the 2× fixation solution to each tube and mix well. The final fixation working concentration should be 1.6% to reduce the damage of fixation to surface targets.\nIncubate the tubes at 24°C for 10 min. Then, add 4 mL of ice-cold CSB to each sample to slow down the fixation reaction.\nCentrifuge the cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nGently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume.\nPrepare the cryopreservation solution by adding 1-part DMSO into 9-parts CSB.\nAdd 1 mL of cryopreservation solution to resuspend cells and place them on ice.\nCount cells of each sample.\nCalculate the volume of the cryopreservation solution required to obtain a final density of 3.5 million/mL of cells.\nAdd the calculated volume of cryopreservation solution in the cells.\nAdd 1 mL cell suspension to the cryogenic vials for separate packing and store at −80°C.\nOptional: The incubation duration can be adjusted by adjusting the time of adding ice-cold CSB.\nNote: The greater cell recovery can result from increased centrifuge speed after cell fixation. The centrifugal speed of this protocol is 300 × g before fixation and 800 × g after fixation.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at −80°C for up to 3 months.",
    "Critical: It is necessary to thoroughly disrupt the pellet by vortexing before and after being incubated with the fixation solution.\nSample preparation and staining of cells with the surface antibody\nTiming: 1 h\nWhen sufficient clinical samples are collected, and antibodies and reagents are prepared, cell resuscitation and staining preparation can be performed.\nRecover PBMCs from −80°C storage.\nPreheat the water bath to 37°C.\nThaw cells of each sample from liquid nitrogen storage at 37°C in a warm water bath immediately.\nTransfer cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nSlowly add 10 mL CSB by drop to minimize damage from concentration changes.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL CSB to each tube to resuspend cells.\nCount cells and record viability.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nGently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume (50 μL).\nResuscitate four samples from the unstimulated group and four from the stimulated group for subsequent experiments.\nPrepare the mixture of surface antibodies CCR4 and CCR7 according to the titration results.\nAdd CSB to the antibody mixture for a total volume of 50 μL.\nAdd 50 μL of the antibody mixture to each tube.\nGently pipette to mix well and incubate at 24°C for 15 min.\nGently vortex samples and incubate at 24°C for an additional 15 min.\nAdd 2 mL CSB to each tube to resuspend cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min, carefully remove supernatant.\nRepeat wash one more time with CSB (2 washes in total).\nGently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume (50 μL).",
    "Note: The resuscitation of the PBMCs is very important for subsequent experiments, so it is recommended that two experimenters prepare the cells together.\nBarcoding samples with Cell-ID 20-plex palladium (Pd) kit\nTiming: 1 h\nThe Cell-ID™ 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit can be performed with barcoding staining of 20 samples.\nEach sample is tagged with a unique label so that they can be mixed into a multiplex group for subsequent staining and data acquisition. Because multiple samples are mixed, the kit reduces sample-specific staining and intersample manipulation errors (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for barcoding technical strategy). This protocol is adapted from the Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit User Guide, with the major changes listed below:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1545-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Barcoding technical strategy and results\n(A–C) There are 20 Barcode Plex in the Cell-ID™ 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit, enabling unique barcoding of 20 samples. With a specific code number (c#), each plex is labeled with three specific palladium isotopes (A). The debarcoding process is performed in the Helios software based on the Pd-Plex combination and then exported file will be numbered with plex (B). For example, c04 is positive for 102Pd and negative for 105Pd, while c12 is the opposite (C).\nFixing and Permeabilizing cells.\nPrepare the 1× Fix I Buffer by adding 1-part 5× Fix I Buffer into 4-parts PBS.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL Fix I Buffer and incubate at 24°C for 10 min.\nAdd 1 mL CSB to each tube to slow down the fixation reaction.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 10 min, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nPrepare the 1× Barcode Perm Buffer by adding 1-part 10× Barcode Perm with 9-parts PBS.\nRepeat the wash once more with Barcode Perm Buffer (2 washes in total).\nFully resuspend barcodes in 100 μL Barcode Perm Buffer.",
    "Fully resuspend each sample to be barcoded in 800 μL Barcode Perm Buffer.\nTransfer the barcodes to the corresponding samples, labeled with the respective barcoding group.\nMix the sample completely and incubate at 24°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and carefully remove the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL CSB to each tube to resuspend cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and remove supernatant.\nRepeat wash one more time with CSB (2 washes in total).\nAdd 1 mL CSB to each tube to resuspend cells.\nCount cells of each sample and calculate the volume of CSB containing 0.75 million cells.\nCombine the four barcoded samples (0.75 million cells per sample) into one tube to obtain the barcoded group.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and remove supernatant.\nGently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume (50 μL).\nNote: Because barcoding with Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd can affect surface antibody staining, previous studies emphasize that this step must be performed after surface staining (Thrash et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In this protocol, we improved the staining method of barcoding (see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] for more details).\nFcR-blocking cells and surface stain\nTiming: 1 h\nFollowing barcoding staining, samples can be mixed as a barcoded group. Then each barcoded group is performed with an FcR-blocking step and a surface-staining step for specific surface staining.\nAdd 5 μL of FcR Blocking Solution to each tube and mix well.\nIncubate the tubes at 24°C for 10 min.\nPrepare the mixture of surface antibodies according to the titration results.\nAdd CSB to the antibody mixture to a total volume of 50 μL.\nAdd 50 μL of the antibody mixture to each tube.",
    "Gently pipette to mix well and incubate at 24°C for 15 min.\nGently vortex samples and incubate at 24°C for an additional 15 min.\nAdd 2 mL CSB to each tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat wash one more time with CSB (2 washes in total).\nGently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume.\nOptional: The FcR blocking solution can be replaced by the reagent purchased from Miltenyi Biotec (Cat#130-059-901).\nIntracellular stain\nTiming: 1.5 h\nFixing and Permeabilizing cells.\nPrepare the 1× Fix I Buffer by adding 10 mL of 5× Fix I Buffer into 40 mL PBS.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL Fix I Buffer, and incubate at 24°C for 20 min.\nAdd 2 mL Perm-S Buffer to each tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat the wash once more with Perm-S buffer for (2 washes in total).\nGently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume (50 μL).\nPrepare the mixture of intracellular antibodies according to the titration results.\nAdd Perm-S buffer to the antibody mixture for a total volume of 50 μL.\nAdd 50 μL of the antibody mixture to each tube.\nGently vortex samples and incubate at 24°C for 30 min.\nAdd 2 mL CSB to each tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat the wash once more with Perm-S buffer for a (2 washes in total).\nGently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume (50 μL).",
    "Note: When there are too many antibodies, the mixture of surface and intracellular antibodies must be performed by two people simultaneously to reduce the operating error. In certain cases, you can skip this step if you are not concerned with intracellular proteins.\nStain cells with Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir\nTiming: 10 h\nAfter cells are stained with surface antibodies and intracellular antibodies, cells also need to undergo nuclear staining to identify single cells and cell fragments.\nPrepare 2 mL cell intercalation solution for each barcoded group by adding 2 μL Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir (125 μM) into 2 mL Fix and Perm Buffer to obtain a final concentration of 125 nM.\nAdd 1 mL cell intercalation solution to each tube and gently vortex.\nLeave overnight (8–10 h) at 4°C.\nOptional: If time is sufficient, the cells can be prepared for data acquisition after incubation in the cell intercalation solution at 24°C for 1 h.\nNote: Frozen aliquots of Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir should be used only once and immediately after thawing.\nPause point: At the end of this major step, cells can be left in the cell intercalation solution at 4°C for up to 48 h.\nPrepare cells for acquisition\nTiming: 4 h (for 2 barcoded groups)\nRewarm the cells from the 4°C storage.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of CSB in each tube to resuspend cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and carefully remove the supernatant.\nGently vortex to resuspend cells in residual volume.\nAdd 2 mL of cell acquisition solution (CAS) to each tube to resuspend and count cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and carefully remove the supernatant.",
    "Repeat the wash once more with CAS (2 washes in total).\nCalculate the volume of CAS required to obtain a final density of 1 million/mL of cells.\nPrepare a sufficient volume of 0.1× EQ beads solution by adding 1-part beads to 9-parts of the CAS.\nAdd the calculated volume of 0.1× EQ beads solution to resuspend cells.\nFilter cells into cell strainer cap tubes.\nAcquire each sample in Helios™ (WB Injector) with an acquisition rate of 300–350 events/s.\nAfter the acquisition, the files can be normalized, processed, and debarcoded using Helios software.\nEight Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files can be exported for subsequent analysis (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] for more details).\nNote: The start-up and tuning of the mass cytometer can be performed with sample washing at the same time. In addition, filtering cells with cell strainer cap tubes is necessary for the normal operation of the Helios™ Mass Cytometer.\nCritical: This protocol is specific for Helios™ mass cytometer with a WB injector and sample acquisition in CAS. It is known that the WB injector has the advantage of superior data quality compared to the High Throughput (HT) injector (Thrash et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])."
