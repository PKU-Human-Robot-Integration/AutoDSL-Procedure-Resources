    "The protocol follows the guidelines and animal care standards of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Lung Dissection\nMammary tumor dissection (optional depending on study goals and whether primary tumor analysis or tail vein injection was performed).\n\t\nEuthanize mouse using a lethal dose of isoflurane anesthesia according to IACUC and university regulation. Confirm euthanization by surgical dislocation. \nOn foam board, pin with dissection pins by placing mouse on its back with limbs spread.\nSpray mouse with 70% ethanol.\nUsing forceps, grasp the lower portion of the animal at the center.\nUsing scissor, cut upward toward the neck through the skin, being careful not to pierce the peritoneal cavity of the mouse.\nCut back skin at the limbs to reveal tumor tissue.\nDissect out tumor tissue and preserve by preferred method, such as freezing or fixation, for further analysis (not discussed further in this protocol). \nLung tissue dissection.\n\t\nIf tumor tissue was harvested as described above, pin down any excess skin.\nUsing forceps, grasp peritoneum at lower end of the animal and begin cutting upwards toward the base of the neck.\nCarefully cut along the left and right sides of the rib cage being careful to avoid severing any blood vessels that may bleed into the thoracic cavity. Remove the rib bones by cutting to the left and right through the diaphragm and upper portions of the rib cage.\nUsing forceps grasp the trachea of the mouse and pull forward.\nSever the trachea with dissection scissors and remove lungs from mouse.\n\t\tNote: The heart may remain attached to the lung. If this occurs, carefully dissect heart away from lungs being careful to collect all five lobes (see Figure 1).\nWash gently with PBS to remove excess blood.",
    "Gross evaluation of lung tissue.\n\t\nOption 1: In vivo imaging.\n\t\t\nFor luciferase imaging, ~10 min prior to imaging, give animals a 150 mg/kg dose of luciferin by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Image lungs in vivo in anesthetized animals or upon removal after dissection (Figure 2) 5.\nOption 2: Gross evaluation.\n\t\t\nExamine lungs under stereo microscope to visualize tumor nodules. Note: If cells are GFP labeled, a fluorescence capable stereomicroscope containing a light cube with the appropriate excitation/emission maxima (e.g. near 470/510 nm) to detect GFP may be used to examine lungs stereoscopically for fluorescence prior to processing.\nIf lungs are to be analyzed immediately, proceed to 'RNA Isolation' section. Otherwise, snap freeze tissue using liquid nitrogen or dry ice. Store at -80 °C.\n2. RNA Isolation\nNote: For the representative analysis, RNA was isolated using a RNA isolation kit (see Materials List). While the current analysis uses one specific manufacturer's product, a variety of isolation kits are available from several reputable vendors. Additionally, non-kit based centrifugation methods are also an option. cDNA should also be prepared from a positive control RNA sample, such as a cell line or plasmid, for standard curve analysis. Alternatively, a positive control specific for the primer probe set may be purchased (see Materials List).\nIf using previously frozen tissue, gather frozen tissue on dry ice.\nHomogenize tissue using one of the following methods such as: mortar and pestle grinding performed by hand over dry ice after freezing tissue in liquid nitrogen; tissue homogenizer or mechanical dissociation device per manufacturer's suggestion; sonication, or other preferred method.\n\tNote: For the representative analysis, the preferred method of homogenization is sonication.",
    "For the analysis presented in Figure 3, prepare lysis buffer (provided in RNA isolation kit) and 2-mercaptoethanol at a ratio of 20 µl 2-mercaptoethanol for every 1 ml of lysis buffer. Resuspend tissue in 300 µl lysis buffer supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol for every 30 g of tissue and sonicate for 10 sec with sonicator set at 30% amplitude.\nIf using mortar and pestle, resuspend ground tissue in 300 µl lysis buffer after grinding.\nAdd 10 µl proteinase K to 590 µl TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA). Add 600 µl proteinase K solution to every 300 µl (i.e. for every 30 mg) of tissue. Incubate for 10 min at RT.\n\tNote: Digestion time may vary.  \nCentrifuge samples at ≥13,000 g for 10 min to remove debris.\nTransfer supernatant to new tubes.\nAdd 450 µl ethanol (96%-100%) for every 900 µl of supernatant to precipitate RNA.\nTransfer 700 µl of the lysate/ethanol mix to the column.\nCentrifuge samples at ≥13,000 g for 1 min to bind RNA to column.\nDiscard liquid waste and add remaining supernatant to column and spin again.\nOnce all the lysate is spun through the column, add 350 µl of Wash Buffer 1 to the upper portion of the column and centrifuge samples at ≥13,000 g for 30 sec.\nDiscard liquid from column and replace upper portion.\nPrepare DNase by mixing 5 units of DNase I enzyme with 5 µl of 10x DNase and 40 µl of DNase/RNase free water per sample (total volume of 50 µl/sample).\nAdd 50 µl of DNase mix to each column and incubate for 15 min at RT.\nAdd 350 µl of Wash Buffer 1 to column and centrifuge samples at ≥13,000 g for 30 sec.\nDiscard liquid from column and replace upper portion.",
    "Add 600 µl of Wash Buffer 2 to the column and spin 30 sec at ≥13,000 g.\nDiscard liquid from column and replace upper portion.\nAdd 250 µl of Wash Buffer 2 and centrifuge for 2 min at ≥13,000 g.\nPut part of column into new collection tube and discard old collection tube.\nAdd 50-100 µl of RNase/DNase free water to column and incubate for 1 min.\nSpin for 1 min at ≥13,000 g.\nRe-run collected eluate through column to increase RNA yield.\nFor immediate use, keep samples on ice and proceed to quantitation. For use later, snap freeze on dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Store at -80 °C freezer until needed.\n3. First Strand Synthesis\nNote: For the representative analysis, the reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction was performed a First Strand cDNA synthesis kit designed for QRT-PCR (see Materials List).\nIf samples were previously collected, thaw tubes on ice.\nMeasure RNA quantity using a spectrophotometer.\nUsing 0.5-2 µg of total RNA, perform first strand synthesis using reverse transcriptase to generate cDNA stock.\n\t\nIn sterile, RNase/DNase-free PCR tubes/plates, prepare the reaction mix (Table 1). Mix gently and centrifuge. Program a standard PCR machine (Table 2).\nDilute finished reaction to desired volume (generally 50-100 µl) using sterile nuclease-free water.\n4. Real-time PCR\nNote: For the representative analysis, SYBR green was used. However, any preferred method can be substituted at the user's discretion.\nUsing a positive control cDNA, set up a standard curve for each primer set.\n\t\nFor the analysis shown in Figure 3, prepare the standard curve for human HER2 using the manufacturer recommended positive control cDNA (see Materials List). For mouse gapdh, use the negative control lung cDNA to generate a standard curve. For each probe, serially dilute the cDNA 1:4 to generate 5 standards.",
    "Calculate the number of total samples, which should include the standard curve and experimental samples.\n\tNote: For the analysis described here, 2-3 experimental replicates per sample were analyzed. Standard curve analysis was performed to generate a simple linear regression model that can be applied to determine the relative amount of HER2 and gapdh per sample to calculate final normalized quantity. This analysis will also ensure that the primer efficiency is adequate for the analysis at hand.\nIn a sterile, RNase/DNase-free tube, prepare master mix (Table 3).\n\t\nCalculate master mix amount per sample. Scale up for more than one sample. Use a master mix for each experimental gene of interest, as well as an internal control such as gapdh. Use primers for gapdh at a final concentration of 200 nM.\n\t\tNote: The internal control is particularly useful when trying to distinguish between human and mouse cell origin.\n\t\tNote: Primer concentration for HER2 was optimized and determined by the manufacturer.\nPrepare test plate containing 1 µl cDNAs corresponding to each standard or experimental sample. Allocate at least 1 cDNA sample/well for each primer probe. Add 19 µl of master mix per well for each primer probe.\n\tNote: For the representative data in Figure 3, the cDNA samples were analyzed in duplicate for each primer probe and graphed as the average of the two samples.\nRun reaction in QRT-PCR machine using recommended or previously tested PCR protocol. See Table 4 for the PCR protocol used for the representative data in Figure 3 and Figure 4. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
