    "Animal experiments were done after taking ethical approval from the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC), AIIMS, New Delhi, India (286/IAEC-1/2021).\n1. Preoperative procedure\nHouse male Wistar albino rats 6-8 weeks of age, weighing between 150-200 g each, at a Central Animal Facility (CAF) in separate individual cages. This ensures no surgical/fracture site injury when multiple rats share cages.\nKeep the rats at a temperature of 23 °C ± 2 °C in a humidity-controlled environment with a relative humidity of 50% ± 5%, expose them to a 12 h dark/light cycle, and give ad libitum access to food (standard semi-synthetic diet): pellet diet (dry) and water. The composition of the standard semi-synthetic diet is as follows: roasted Bengal gram flour (60%), wheat flour (22%), casein (4%), skim milk powder (5%), refined oil (4%), salt mixture with starch (4.8%), and vitamin choline mixture with starch (0.2%).\nAcclimatize the rats for a period of at least 48 h before surgery.\nWeigh each rat on a digital weighing scale and note the weight.\nAdminister intraperitoneal (IP) injections of cefuroxime (100 mg/kg body weight), tramadol (25 mg/kg body weight), and a combination of ketamine (75 mg/kg body weight) with xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight) to the rats 15 min before starting the surgical procedure. Apply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent dry eye.\nRemove the hair from the right lower limb, from the flank region up to the knee joint, with topical application of a hair removal cream.\n\t​NOTE: Blood (0.5 mL) can be collected from the tail vein of each rat for the baseline analysis of different parameters. Blood can be collected again every 2 weeks after the surgery.\n2. Surgical procedure for creating complete transverse fracture through open osteotomy",
    "NOTE: Use a designated operation room with an operating table and optimal ambient temperature (26 °C) for performing the procedure.\nPlace the wax block (aluminum tray 30 cm x 30 cm x 4 cm containing wax up to a depth of 2.5 cm) on the operating table and cover it with sterile drapes. The wax block prevents any change in the animal's position during surgery.\nConfirm the onset of anesthesia (by checking loss of toe pinch). Place the anesthetized rat on a sterile drape in the left lateral position. Ask an assistant to hold the right lower limb (knee and hip) in extension. Keep a sterile hard support (marble block) under the right leg to support the femur. Clean the surgical site with alcohol and betadine.\nInject local anesthesia (0.25 mL of 1% lignocaine) at the site of incision (lateral aspect of the right thigh), cut a hole in another sterile drape, and expose only the right leg of the rat through it for surgery.\nGive a 1 cm vertical skin incision on the lateral side of the right thigh, and extend it as per need with a no. 15 surgical blade.\nExpose the vastus lateralis muscle by separating the deep fascia using Metzenbaum scissors. Split the vastus lateralis in line with the muscle fibers using artery forceps until the shaft of the femur is reached.\nFree the bone from the muscles attached to it using the periosteal elevator.\nInject local anesthesia (0.2 mL of 1% lignocaine) in and around the periosteum to prevent vasovagal reflex.",
    "Create an indentation in the middle third of the shaft of the femur using the no.15 surgical blade, and fracture the bone in the middle-third of the shaft (complete fracture) by placing a chisel on the indentation made (so that the chisel does not slip) and gently tapping the chisel with a hammer. Use the sterile hard support (marble block) to support the bone while fracturing it to ensure a clean break.\n\tNOTE: The sterile hard support usually does not cause a significant injury to the muscles underneath.\nInternally fix the fracture using a sterile K-wire (1.0 mm) held with the help of a battery-operated power drill. Pass the K-wire into the medullary canal of the distal fragment through the fracture site. Then, drill out the K-wire through the distal end of the femur using the battery-operated power drill.\n\tNOTE: Disinfect the surface of the power drill with alcohol before use. Change gloves after the K-wire is fixed.\nAfter reducing the fracture, advance the K-wire from the distal end into the canal of the proximal fragment until it obtains purchase in the trochanteric region. Cut off the distal part of the K-wire protruding through the skin using a wire cutter.\nBend the tip of the K-wire to around 90° using pliers and use a gauze bandage soaked in betadine for pin-site dressing. The K-wire acts as an intramedullary splint for keeping the fracture in a reduced position.\nEnsure complete hemostasis before closing the skin using a 3-0 nylon suture. Apply pressure on the bleeding area using sterile gauze or artery forceps to stop any bleeding.\nClean the wound with betadine, and cover it with sterile gauze and micropore adhesive tape.\n3. Postoperative care",
    "Return the rats to their cages, allow normal ambulation, and continue giving a standard semi-synthetic diet until sacrificing them, as well as antibiotics (injection cefuroxime 100 mg/kg) and analgesics (injection tramadol 25 mg/kg/day in two divided doses) intraperitoneally for 5 days after the procedure.\n\tNOTE: The rats can be divided into treatment and control groups to test a particular drug. If the drug is water soluble, it can be given orally through gavage. The weight of the individual animals may be noted to calculate the dose of the drug to be used. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be followed to ensure homogeneity of the animal groups.\nHouse the animals in individual cages under similar conditions to the preoperative period. Inspect the surgical site every day to look for any signs of postoperative pain, wound infection, slipping of sutures, or any abdominal swelling or discomfort.\nAssess bone healing by X-ray of the fractured site once weekly.\n4. Radiological procedure\nBefore the X-ray, anesthetize the rats with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight).\nKeep the hip joint of the rat in a flexed and abducted position while the knee joint is kept semi-flexed to take the X-ray of the fractured limb with the following exposure settings: Ref. kVp ≈ 62; Ref. mAS = 6.4; and automatic exposure settings (Ref. mA=160).\n\t​NOTE: X-rays were taken at baseline (1 day after surgery) and then once weekly until sacrifice or 5 weeks.\n5. Animal euthanasia and callus retrieval\nSacrifice the rats by an overdose of carbon dioxide (administer 100% CO2 at a flow rate of 7-8 L/min for 1 min, followed by a waiting period of 4-5 min), at two previously determined time points, based on the radiological appearance of soft and hard bridging calluses, respectively.",
    "Incise the skin parallel to the femur and separate the overlying muscles carefully to avoid damage to the callus tissue.\nFracture the bone between the hip joint and callus tissue using a hammer and chisel. Similarly, fracture the bone between the callus and the knee joint. Remove the K-wire and clean the bone piece in saline to remove blood clots and soft tissue.\nTransfer the callus immediately to a labeled container with 10% neutral buffered formalin (20 mL per sample) and keep it for 3 days at room temperature (RT).\n6. Decalcification of bone and callus tissue\nTake the callus tissue from formalin and keep it at RT in 20% ETDA solution, pH 7, for decalcification of the bone tissue.\nChange fresh EDTA solution every 2 days for approximately 3 weeks, and check for bone decalcification by poking the bone with a needle without disturbing the callus tissue. Optimal decalcification is denoted by the loss of the normal gritty sensation of the bone tissue.\nAfter complete decalcification, cut the sagittal section of the callus and prepare paraffin blocks of the callus tissue. Cut 4 µm thick sections of the callus tissue for histopathological16 and any other comparative analysis17.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
