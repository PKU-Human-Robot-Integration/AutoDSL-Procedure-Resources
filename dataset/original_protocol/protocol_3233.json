    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExcess membrane reservoirs preparation\nTiming: ∼1 h\nLipid nanotubes are prepared using excess membrane reservoirs consisting of silica beads covered with supported lipid bilayers as previously reported.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] The supported lipid bilayers are formed by the adsorption and the fusion of liposomes on the surface of silica beads. The excess membrane reservoirs are thoroughly washed to remove liposomes remaining in the bulk solution.\nPrepare excess membrane reservoirs.\nAdd 40 μL of 5.0 M NaCl to 160 μL of liposome solution containing 250 μM of lipids.\nNote: Liposome adsorption to the surface of silica beads depends on salt concentration, lipid composition, and the number and size of silica beads.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nAdd 20 μL of suspension containing silica beads in water to the liposome solution.\nNote: Solution containing silica beads is recommended to be agitated using a vortex mixer before aspiration.\nAgitate the mixture intermittently with a vortex mixer for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 780 μL of water to the mixture and centrifuge it at 500 × g for 1 min at 25°C.\nRemove ∼950 μL of the supernatant, being careful not to aspirate the beads pellet.\nAdd ∼950 μL of water to the beads pellet and centrifuge it at 500 × g for 1 min at 25°C.\nRepeat steps 4e and 4f three times to remove liposomes remaining in the bulk solution.\nRemove ∼950 μL of the supernatant, leaving the beads pellet that contains excess membrane reservoirs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nCritical: Excess membrane reservoirs should be freshly prepared before membrane fission assay to produce lipid nanotubes efficiently.\nLipid nanotube preparation\nTiming: ∼30 min\nLipid nanotubes are prepared by rolling excess membrane reservoirs over the bottom of an observation chamber. The rolling can be achieved by simply tilting the observation chamber.\nPrepare lipid nanotubes.",
    "Prepare an observation chamber assembled with a C-shaped silicone rubber spacer sandwiched between a cover glass and a glass slide (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Any observation chamber can be used if the solution does not spill when tilted.\nFill HEPES buffer containing 1 mg/mL of BSA into the observation chamber at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the BSA solution immediately.\nNote: Longer incubation time will reduce lipid nanotube production likely due to excessive BSA coating on the glass surface.\nFill the observation chamber with HEPES buffer.\nAspirate solution containing excess membrane reservoirs and deposit it at the open side of the observation chamber.\nTilt the observation chamber more than ∼20° for the excess membrane reservoirs to roll slowly toward the inside over the bottom.\nRoll the excess membrane reservoirs until they reach the inside wall.\nPlace the observation chamber horizontally.\nPut the observation chamber on the stage of confocal laser scanning microscope to observe lipid nanotubes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: Lipid nanotubes must be freshly used within 1 h for membrane fission assay.\nObservation for fission of lipid nanotubes\nTiming: ∼30 min\nPurified mitofissin, SpAtg44, is applied to lipid nanotubes under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The local concentration of SpAtg44 near lipid nanotubes is increased by introducing it via a glass micropipette attached to a three-dimensional manipulator installed on the confocal laser scanning microscope. The sample application is hydraulically controlled while the pressure is monitored using a digital multimeter. The application system is optional to observe membrane fission.\nObserve membrane fission.\nPrepare a glass micropipette with a diameter of ∼20 μm using a puller and a capillary cleaving tool.\nLoad 100 μM of SpAtg44 in HEPES buffer into the micropipette by aspiration using a dry vacuum pump.",
    "Note: Protein concentration required for the observation of membrane fission depends on the protein of interest.\nConnect the micropipette to a hydraulic system through a silicone tube.\nSet the micropipette on the three-dimensional manipulator.\nAdjust the voltage induced by application pressure to be ∼3 V (positive) in a digital multimeter.\nNote: The value of positive application pressure may depend on the experimental environment.\nNote: Whether the pressure is positive or negative can be determined by whether the glass micropipette exhales or inhales fluorescently labeled lipid aggregates.\nAdjust the micropipette so that the tip is visible under the confocal laser scanning microscope.\nAdjust the voltage induced by application pressure to be neutral by reading it using the digital multimeter.\nPosition the tip of the micropipette near lipid nanotubes.\nApply the additional voltage induced by positive pressure to be up to 300 mV from the neutral value in the digital multimeter to introduce SpAtg44.\nRecord time-lapse imaging during SpAtg44 application to lipid nanotubes using FV31S-SW software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Take images of fluorescence from liss Rhod PE excited using a-561 nm laser at every ∼1-s for 15 min with ×60 oil immersion objective lens.\nAnalyze the time-lapse images using FV31S-SW or Fiji softwares to estimate fission events per tube length (40 μm in our case). Fission sites can be manually counted along the nanotubes based on fluorescence breaks after subtracting background (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The protein of interest can be directly applied using a pipette to lipid nanotubes. Lipid nanotubes are fragile, thus they should be handled with care during the application process to minimize any potential damage.\nNote: A negative control experiment should be conducted in parallel using a protein like green fluorescent protein irrelevant to fission activity.\nRadius of lipid nanotube estimation\nTiming: ∼1 h",
    "The radius of a lipid nanotube can be estimated from the fluorescence intensity.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] The total fluorescence intensity of a lipid nanotube in the region of interest (ROI) can be described by the equation, I = α(2πrL) where I is the total fluorescence intensity in ROI, α is the correlation coefficient, r is the tube radius, and L is the tube length in ROI. Supported lipid bilayers that have spilled out from an excess membrane reservoir are prepared to estimate the α value. After measuring the total fluorescence intensity and the membrane area of the supported lipid bilayer in ROI, α can be obtained from the equation, I = αA, where A is the membrane area in ROI. Eventually, the fluorescence intensity and the length of the lipid nanotube of interest are measured, thereby calculating the tube radius using α value.\nEstimate the radius of the lipid nanotube.\nPrepare an observation chamber assembled with a C-shaped silicone rubber spacer sandwiched between a cover glass and a glass slide.\nNote: An observation chamber similar to the one used in membrane fission assay is recommended. The chamber is not coated with BSA.\nFill the observation chamber with HEPES buffer lacking BSA.\nDeposit 20 μL of the solution containing excess membrane reservoirs to be scattered in the observation chamber.\nNote: Excess membrane reservoirs adhere to the glass surface, thereby spilling the membrane in the observation chamber without BSA coating.\nPlace the observation chamber on the stage of the confocal laser scanning microscope.\nTake images of supported lipid bilayers spilled out from excess membrane reservoirs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nMeasure the total fluorescence intensity and the membrane area in ROI after subtracting the background by Fiji software.\nPlot the total fluorescence intensity against the membrane area, determining the α value by Excel software (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Measure the total fluorescence intensity and the length of the lipid nanotube in ROI after subtracting the background by Fiji software. Tube radius, r, is estimated from the equation: r = I/2πLα (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nPlot the fission events per tube length against tube radius to visualize the tube radius dependency of fission activity in the experimental condition (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E)."
