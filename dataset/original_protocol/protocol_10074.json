    "1. Preparation of cells\nTwo days prior to the experiment, seed 3*105 HeLa or NIH3T3 cells in 2 mL of full growth medium per well of a 6-well cell-culture plate. Ensure that cells are handled in a laminar flow hood throughout this protocol.\nOne day prior to the experiment, prepare the transfection reagents according to the manufacturer’s recommendations or an empirically determined protocol, e.g.:\n\t\nDilute 1 µg of RFP-Lifeact and 1 µg of YFP-Vinculin in a total of 200 µL reduced serum medium. Vortex the transfection reagent briefly, add 4 µL to 200 µL DNA and vortex again. Incubate the transfection mix for 15-20 min at room temperature.\nAdd the entire transfection mix dropwise directly to the cells. Mix by shaking the plate and place it back into the incubator.\nOn the day of the experiment, prepare the sample for live imaging:\n\t\nPrepare a 10 µg/mL solution of fibronectin in PBS to coat the glass surface of a 35 mm glass bottom dish. Use only high quality 0.17 mm glass coverslips for optimal TIRF performance and avoid plastic bottom dishes. Leave the solution on the glass surface for 30 min at room temperature, then remove it and let the dish air-dry.\nDilute a 0.1 µm multi-fluorescent beads solution to a density of 1.8 x 109 particles per mL in distilled water and add the solution for 30-60 s to the fibronectin-coated glass surface. Immediately remove the solution and let the dish air-dry.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is necessary only if the TIRF plane should be found before seeding cells and/or to acquire a 2-color reference image for bead-based image registration.\nPrepare a 0.1 M ascorbic acid (AA) solution and dilute it to a final concentration of 0.1 mM in growth medium (AA-medium). Place the solution in a 37 °C water bath.",
    "NOTE: Use fluorescence-optimized cell culture medium if possible, such as phenolred-free and (ribo-) flavin-reduced medium. AA is an anti-oxidizing agent that can reduce phototoxic effects during live imaging14. We have tested it successfully in this assay, i.e. more cells appeared healthy under the conditions applied than without AA addition. However, the pH of the medium was lowered by 0.17 pH units.\nWash the cells with 2 mL PBS, add 250 µL Trypsin-EDTA and wait until the cells are fully detached (2-3 min in a 37 °C incubator). Resuspend the cells carefully in 1 mL pre-warmed AA-medium with a pipette and add it to 4 mL AA-medium in a 15 mL cell culture tube. Place the cell suspension with a slightly opened lid in an incubator set to 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the vicinity of the microscope.\nAdd 1 mL pre-warmed AA-medium to the glass bottom dish and place it in the holder of the pre-heated microscope (see next paragraph).\n2. Live imaging\nStart the environmental control of the microscope to achieve a stable 37 °C, 5% CO2 and humid atmosphere.\n\tNOTE: Here, a small stage top incubation chamber has been used that allowed stable settings within about 15min. Larger incubators will need more time to achieve stable conditions.\nFix all acquisition settings at the microscope before the cell suspension is applied:\n\t\nSet the time-interval to 30 s and the duration to 60-90 min. Activate the auto-focusing function of the hardware-based auto-focus for every time point (value “1”).\nAdjust the camera exposure and gain, as well as the laser power for every channel. High gain levels, low exposure time and low laser power are recommendable to reduce photo-toxicity.",
    "NOTE: The data presented here was acquired with 200 ms exposure, gain level 500 and 20% laser power that equals excitation intensities of 0.5 W/cm² for 488 nm and 1 W/cm² for 561 nm, respectively.\nSet the z-stack for the spinning-disk channels to 10 µm with 0.4 µm spacing. De-activate z-stacks for the TIRF channels. Set the bottom-offset to “0”, i.e. the lowest plane will be the focus position of the hardware auto-focus.\nActivate the multi-point function “stage positions”.\n\t\tNOTE: Up to 3 positions can be recorded in a 30 s time interval.\nFind the fluorescent beads with epi-fluorescent illumination at the ocular or on the computer screen, then activate one TIRF channel and set the illumination angle to a value that denotes TIRF illumination. Activate the auto-focus by pushing the button at the microscope panel and adjust the focus with the offset wheel. Acquire a 2-color dataset, i.e. TIRF-488 and TIRF-561, for subsequent bead-based image registration (see point 3.1).\n\t\nOptional: To ensure TIRF illumination, add a few microliters of the freely floating fluorescent multicolor beads suspension (see point 1.3.2.). Activate the live view of a TIRF channel and increase the illumination angle. The non-adherent beads will disappear beyond the critical angle, ensuring a correct TIRF illumination8.\nMix the cell suspension again by inverting the closed tube 2-3 times, and apply 1 mL of the cells to the imaging dish.\nQuickly find double-transfected cells with low level epi-fluorescent illumination. Center the cells in the live camera preview using bright field illumination and mark the position. Find another 1-2 points of interest and save them to the positions list.\n\tNOTE: At the beginning, the cells easily can detach due to stage movement, hence set 4-5 positions and re-check all before starting image acquisition. Afterwards, discard 1-2 positions.",
    "Start data acquisition by clicking on the “Sequence” button.\n3. Image post-processing in ImageJ\nIn order to generate a registration-free hyperstack in FIJI15, a macro named “SD-TIRF_helper” has been written that can be applied to 2-4 channel SD-TIRF timelapse datasets. Save the file “SD-TIRF_helper_JoVE.ijm” in the FIJI sub-folder “macros” and run the macro by clicking on the menu command “Plugins>Macros>Run…”.\n\t\nIf the color channels need registration correction, select the option and create a new bead-based registration reference (landmark file) or use an existing file that was created before.\n\t\tNOTE: The turboreg plugin16 will be applied to fluorescence beads reference images. Install the plugin in FIJI software according to general guidelines for plugin installations.\nImport the data with the bio-formats importer and choose hyperstack as a viewing option. Load the image dataset, select the SD-series in the first step, and the TIRF-series in the second step. FIJI will display the data sorted by channel and stage position, i.e. normally all SD-channels and all TIRF-channels show up as one hyperstack for every stage position that has been selected.\n\t\tNOTE: Data import is possible from various file types, for example TIFF-series or platform-dependent file types such as *.nd. The file type cannot be recognized only if it was not exported by the acquisition software as independent, compression-less TIFF format.\nApply the registration correction to the respective channels by loading the pre-determined landmarks file.\nSelect the desired color look-up table (LUT) for every SD- and TIRF channel and merge them into a single, multi-dimensional hyperstack.",
    "NOTE: During processing of the TIRF channels, a number of z-planes with zero intensity values are added on top of the bottom plane that matches with the number of z-planes in the SD dataset. This step is important for the visualization of the final hyperstack. This methodology is correct, since the depth of the TIRF illumination (less than 200nm7) is smaller than the z-step size of the SD stack (400 nm).\nSubscription Required.
