    "All animal experiments were conducted following the guidelines from the directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on protection of animals used for scientific purposes (Ethic committee approved, #G1071/09).\nNOTE: Preliminary preparation, anesthesia, post-operative care and monitoring work are the same as performed in traditional surgical methods1,2,4. BALB/c mice served as heart donors and C57BL/6J as transplant recipients. Mice were aged 8-12 weeks, weighed~30 g at transplantation and were housed under standard conditions.\n1. Preparatory steps\nFor anesthesia, give mice inhalative isoflurane (2%) until they fall asleep, followed by intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (100 mg/kg) + xylazine (10 mg/kg) + acepromazine (2 mg/kg). For postoperative analgesia, apply Metamizol (200 mg/kg) p.o. and Carprofen (5 mg/kg) s.c..\n\tNOTE: The application of antibiotics was abstained on purpose as these substances may influence immunological responses.\nFor surgery, use a set of microscopic instruments including a micro-scissor, micro-forceps, a needle holder and micro hemostatic clamps. An electrosurgical pen is also necessary. Perform sutures using 7/0er, 10/0er and 4/0er nylon types.\nPlace the mouse in a box for isoflurane inhalation (2%) for 40-60 seconds. Determine the depth of anesthesia by squeezing the paw with tweezers. If there is a complete lack of response for this stimulus, go to the next step.\nOnce the mouse has fallen asleep, weigh the mouse.\nApply an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) + xylazine (10 mg/kg) + acepromazine (2 mg/kg) to the anesthetized mouse.\nClip the abdominal fur and place the mouse on the operation table. Perform disinfection using povidone iodide for 3 times, then properly drape the mouse using a fenestrated surgical towel.\n2. Donor operation procedure\nUse scissors to cut the skin from the neck to the lower abdomen, and peel off the full layer of the skin to the midline of both axillae.",
    "Use scissors to cut the muscles of the abdominal wall and gently move the viscera to the left (from the operator's view). Wrap away the viscera with a saline imbibed gauze to safely expose the inferior vena cava.\nUse a 1 mL syringe to inject 0.4 mL of the heparin solution (contains 500 U heparin) slowly into the lower vena cava and wait for 1 minute before pulling out the needle.\nPull out the needle and use a micro-scissor to cut both the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta to accelerate exsanguination.\nUse scissors to open the chest cavity by performing a u-shaped cut; completely expose the heart, lungs and all chest blood vessels.\n\t\nExpose the thoracic aorta, cut 1/2 of the lumen, and then cut the pulmonary vein to facilitate irrigation and drainage.\nInsert an irrigation tube into the opening of the thoracic aorta, inject at least 2 mL of 4 °C cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate cardioplegia solution (Custodiol HTK solution)9 until the pulmonary vein outflow is completely clear and the heart completely stops beating.\nPull out the irrigation tube and detach the sternum.\nUse micro scissors to remove the thymus and to slightly strip the fat around the aortic arch.\nUse straight and curved forceps to expose and ligate the trunk of the arteria pulmonalis (on the right side of the aortic arch) with a 10/0 suture.\nUse micro forceps to separate the fat and connective tissue attached to the IIVC, expose and ligate the superior vena cava (on the left side of the aortic arch) with a 7/0 suture and use micro scissors to cut it behind the ligation.\nMake a 7/0 suture around the base of the heart underneath the aortic arch, the IIVC, and both auricles. Then ligate the pulmonary artery branches and venous lung vessels.",
    "Use micro scissors to transect the aortic arch as distal as possible, the lung vessels underneath the ligature and the IIVC near the diaphragm. Remove the heart out of the chest.\nPlace the explanted donor's heart into 4 °C cold HTK cardioplegia solution and preserve temporarily.\n3. Recipient operation procedure\nNOTE: The initial operation steps are similar to those previously shown for the donor mouse, including anesthesia and disinfection.\nPerform the abdominal skin cut in a transverse manner, cover the abdominal organs with a wet gauze using saline solution.\nUse micro forceps to expose the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta and free them from surrounding fat tissue.\nUse micro forceps to ligate or electrocauterize side branch vessels (lateral or under the vein/aorta) below the renal vessels.\nUse clip applicator forceps to position two micro hemostatic clamps at the abdominal part of vein/aorta coming from the right leaving more than 1 cm distance for both aorta/vein to ensure space for the construction of the anastomosis in between them.\nUse micro scissors to make an incision into the aorta a little nearer to the lower clamp than to the upper clamp. Alternatively, use a 30 G needle to make a small hole and open it up with micro scissors.\nPosition the recipient mouse so that the aorta is facing the operator with the vena cava on the other side. Then place the heart into the abdominal cavity and cover it with a small wet gauze pad.",
    "Use a 10/0 suture to adapt and stitch the donor aorta to the recipient aorta starting caudally, make a knot and proceed with a running suture to the top of the incision (about 4-5 stitches). Next, flip the heart over to the right (from the subject's view), cover it again and continue the suture on the left side until reaching the caudal end and knot it.\nUse an irrigation tube to inject at least 0.5 mL of 4 °C HTK cardioplegia solution to flush the donor's IIVC.\nUse micro-scissors to cut a round hole on the abdominal inferior vena cava of the recipient, which should have the same size of the donors IIVC lumen. The incision should be located above the aortic anastomotic opening. Make the vein incision larger than the aortic incision.\nUse a 10/0 suture to sew the donor IIVC to the recipient vena cava starting caudally. Tie a knot and perform a running suture until the top of the incision is reached. Use five stitches and continue the suture on the left. Finally, tie a knot in the tail corner, and carefully tighten (be careful not to pull too tight).\nPlace the small parts of the hemostatic sponge around the vein and aortic anastomoses.\nUse clip applicator forceps to remove first the lower and then the upper micro-hemostatic clamps and rinse the abdominal cavity with 38.0°C tempered 0.9% sodium chloride.\nUse micro forceps to take away the hemostatic sponge.\nObserve the heartbeat of the transplanted heart.\nUse forceps to put the intestines back into the abdominal cavity and two-layer sutures (abdominal muscles followed by skin) to close the abdominal wound with a 4/0 suture.",
    "Put the mice into an oxygen and temperature control workstation chamber (e.g., INVIVO2-400) to provide a warm and oxygen rich environment for the transplanted mice to recover, wait for the mice to wake up.\nFor postoperative analgesia, directly give Metamizol 200 mg/kg per os after operation. Four and 16 hours after operation give Metamizol 200 mg/kg per os+ Carprofen (5mg/kg) s.c. In the further followup, give Carprofen (5 mg/kg) s.c to the transplanted mice every 24 hours for three consecutive days after operation.\nSubscription Required.
