    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe method below provides step-by-step details to effectively engineer primary canine T cells. Compared to previously published methods (Panjwani et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Sakai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), our implemented protocol based on use of RD114 pseudotyped viral vectors and activation of canine T lymphocytes via anti-canine CD3/CD28-coated beads enables high transduction efficiencies using a single infection. Of note, we have also successfully employed chimeric RD114 and VSVG pseudotyped retrovirus for canine T cell transduction. While chimeric pseudotyped retrovirus is not necessary to efficiently engineer canine primary T cells, this strategy allows more efficient transduction of human cells compared with RD114-only pseudotyped virus, thus enabling side-by-side comparative, mechanistic studies in dog and human cells. For canine clinical trials, our retroviral vector of choice is MSGV1, which has been safely employed to generate CAR T cell products used in the treatment of human cancer patients without evidence of replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) production.\nProduction of RD114 pseudotyped retrovirus\nTiming: 4 days\nHigh titers of RD114 retrovirus can be produced by transfecting HEK 293T cells in 10 cm dishes. The final yield is usually 10–12 mL per dish. Several dishes can be transfected to produce clinical scale virus stocks, which can be stored as supernatants at -80°C in the long term and for at least 2 years without loss of their transduction potential. No special producing cell lines, ultracentrifuges or concentrating agents are required, making this method versatile and easy to perform in most laboratories. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] outlines the main steps of our procedure to produce RD114 pseudotyped virus supernatants.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1125-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow to produce RD114 pseudotyped retrovirus",
    "12–18 h prior to transfection (early afternoon on the day before), seed HEK 293T cells in 10 cm dishes at 4 × 106 cells per dish in 10 mL HEK 293T media. Gently rock the dish to ensure even cell distribution and return to 37°C incubator.\nCritical: Health of HEK 293T is a key determinant for high retroviral titers. When seeding them for transfection, HEK 293T cells should be a single cell suspension grown to 70%–80% confluency, >90% viable and not passaged more than 25 times (see troubleshooting, problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for further details). The number of HEK 293T can be modified based on the time of transfection on the following day. If transfection is performed after >18h, <4 × 106 cells per dish should be plated to avoid overgrowth.\nOn the day of transfection, check HEK 293T under an inverted microscope to confirm that they are evenly distributed and 70%–90% confluent. If so, proceed to transfection as follow:\ntransfer 4 mL HEK 293T media per dish into a sterile 50 mL conical tube and let warm to 37°C in a water bath.\nFor each virus to be produced, transfer 15 μL Lipofectamine 2000/dish into a sterile conical tube containing 1.4 mL transfection media/dish. Mix by gently flicking the tube, without pipetting or vortexing, and avoiding bubbles, as this may cause oxidation of lipofectamine cationic lipids and reduced transfection efficiency. Incubate the lipofectamine dilution at 20°C–25°C for ≤14 min.\nNote: If transfecting >3 dishes/virus, consider preparing 1 tube for up to 3 dishes to avoid prolonged incubations between the mix preparation and the last transfections.",
    "During the lipofectamine/media incubation, prepare the plasmid master mix by combining the Gag/Pol (GP) packaging plasmid, the RD114 (R) envelope plasmid and the MSGV1.CAR (M) plasmid in a sterile microcentrifuge tube. We use a molar ratio of GP:R:M = 1:1.5:3–5 for a total of 21–23 μg plasmid DNA/dish in up to 100 μL transfection media/dish.\nCritical: Use endotoxin-free maxiprep kits to produce plasmid DNA. Verify that DNA is predominantly supercoiled after maxiprep on an agarose gel, as relative increases in the proportion of nicked/linear DNA significantly impair viral titers.\nOnce Lipofectamine 2000 incubation is complete, carefully add plasmid mixtures to the center of the tube(s), gently flick to mix and incubate for ≤25 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAt the end of the incubation, take HEK 293T dish(es) from the incubator and completely remove media. Using a 2 mL pipette, immediately and carefully add the lipofectamine-plasmid mix dropwise (∼ 1.5 mL). Cover the entire layer of cells, then gently rock the dish back and forth for 30–60 s to evenly distribute the transfection complexes.\nNote: Handle 293T gently but quickly. To avoid detaching, HEK 293T should not be kept out of the incubator and/or without media and/or in direct contact with the lipofectamine-plasmid mix for too long. If transfecting several dishes, proceeding with set of 3 transfections at a time may help prevent unwanted delays.\nGently tilt the dish and slowly add ∼3.5 mL warm HEK 293T media without dislodging the cells. Tilt the dish back, then gently rock back and forth to ensure even distribution of the media/transfection complexes and return to the incubator for 6 h.\nNote: After addition of the warm media, the total volume should not exceed 6 ml per dish.",
    "6 h after transfection, completely replace the transfection media with 6 mL pre-warmed HEK 293T media and return the plate to the 37°C incubator.\n48 h after transfection, harvest supernatant containing retroviral vectors\n30 min before harvest, warm 6 mL of HEK 293T media per plate\nCarefully tilt the dish and collect the media into a sterile 50 mL conical tube. Pool supernatants if multiple dishes have been transfected with the same plasmid mix.\nCarefully replace supernatant with 5.5 mL of warmed HEK 293T media without dislodging the cells and return cells to the incubator.\nCentrifuge tubes at 500 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C to remove cellular debris. Harvest and filter supernatants with 0.45 μM PES filters to remove contaminating cells and large cell debris.\nAliquot supernatants into 1.5 mL screw-cap tubes and snap-freeze on dry ice for 30 min before storing at −80°C.\nRepeat harvest of vector supernatant 24 h later (72-h harvest) as described in step 4b-e.\nTitration of RD114 retrovirus batches on K562 cells\nTiming: 3 days\nTitrate supernatants on K562 cells.\nThaw virus on ice for 20 min, then complete thawing at 20°C–25°C.\nIn a 96-well flat-bottom plate (K562-titration plate) seed K562 cells in two or three 8-well columns for technical duplicates or triplicates respectively, at 4 × 104 K562 cells in 100 μL of K562 media per well. Repeat this for each virus batch to be titrated.\nOn a parallel 96-well round-bottom plate (virus-dilution plate), pipette 125 μL K562 media per well following the same pattern. Leave the first row empty. Then, add 250 μL of the virus to the top well of each column.",
    "With a multichannel pipette, prepare a 2-fold dilution series by transferring 125 μL of viral supernatant from row-1 wells to row-2 wells of the virus-dilution plate. Gently pipette up and down ∼6 times to mix the virus supernatant and K562 media. After the last mix, without discarding the tips, carry 125 μL down from row-2 to row-3 wells. Follow down to row-7 wells. Do not add any virus into row-8 wells.\nTransfer 100 μL of virus and dilution series from each well of column A of the virus-dilution plate to the corresponding K562 cell column of the K562-titration plate. Repeat for each column and, when done, incubate at 37°C for 72 h.\nAfter 72 h, transfer cells to FACS tube, proceed to CAR labeling as required (see below step 36 for details on our CAR labeling reagents and protocol) and determine transduction efficiency (TE) by flow cytometry. A representative K562 TE profile is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1125-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Titration of RD114 pseudotyped virus supernatants on K562 cells\nRepresentative TE profile of K562 cells infected with the indicated virus dilutions (D). No polybrene or other strategies to enhance transduction were employed.\nGraph titration results on a XY scatter chart by plotting the μL of virus supernatant on the x axis (e.g., 0, 1.5625, 3.125, 6.250, etc) and the TE percentages on the y axis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The virus supernatant volumes should approximate a linear correlation particularly with intermediate TE values (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, red line).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1125-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Determination of functional titer\n(A) Representative XY scatter chart of virus supernatant volumes and TE percentages (average TE of duplicates) from the same experiment shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. Data are represented as mean with range.",
    "(B) Selection of the best point for determination of functional titer. The same series as in A is shown, without extreme points, i.e., x=100 (no dilution) and x=0 (no virus). Linear regression modeling (superimposed red line) confirmed a good correlation between the virus volumes used and the resulting TE percentages (R2 >0.95). The point obtained using a dilution (D) 16 was chosen as the most appropriate for determination of the functional titer (average TE=6.09%). Data in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B are represented as mean with range.\n(C) Equation to calculate the number of virions per mL. TU/mL: number of transducing particles (viral vectors) per mL. F: fraction of CAR positive K562 cells (% of positive cells/100). N: number of K562 at the time of infection (4 × 104). D: dilution factor. 1000: correction factor to provide the number of TU per mL. V: volume of diluted virus added to each well (100 μL).\nTo determine the functional titer of the virus batch, select the point that most accurately represents the number of transduced cells. For TE<1%, flow cytometry may not be accurate enough. For TE>20%, multiple vectors are more likely to infect each positive cells, leading to underestimation of the number of transducing particles. TE values within the range of 1%–20% are usually associated with the most accurate estimate (Giry-Laterrière et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Once chosen the appropriate point, use the corresponding percentage of positive cells (F) and virus dilution (D) to determine the number of viral vectors per mL (TU/mL) as detailed in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.",
    "Note: Titration could be performed using different cells lines (e.g., 293T, Jurkat cells), vessels (U bottom 96-well plates), cell numbers (e.g., 100,000 cells), fold-dilutions (e.g., 3-fold), and strategies (e.g., additional polybrene or spinoculation). Such variations will result in different estimated TU/mL values and may require further trial transductions of primary canine T cells to identify and validate the most appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI).\nIsolation of primary canine T cells\nTiming: 1 day\nThe goal of the following steps is to purify canine T lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), i.e., monocytes, granulocytes, B lymphocytes and any potential circulating myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC), that can reduce efficiency of CAR engineering particularly in samples obtained from canine cancer patients. We routinely perform a negative selection to enrich for T cells. However, we have also successfully purified T cells by positive selection using anti-CD5 primary antibody, followed by labeling with appropriate MicroBead-conjugated secondary antibody.\nObtain peripheral blood sample from healthy dog or canine cancer patient and isolate PBMCs by gradient centrifugation using standard, sterile media and protocols optimized for isolating human lymphocytes, such as Ficoll-Paque Plus or Histopaque®-1077 (see manufacturer’s recommendations for Ficoll-Paque and Hstopaque-1077). If available, leukapheresis products may provide higher initial numbers of T cells, which may be particularly useful for clinical scale manufacturing of canine patient derived, autologous CAR T cells.\nTo remove any residual isolation media, resuspend isolated mononuclear cells in at least an equal volume of 1× PBS without Ca++ and Mg++, e.g., 25 mL cell suspension and 25 mL PBS. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min, and carefully aspirate supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Repeat twice.\nAfter the second wash resuspend in up to 50 mL T cell medium (TCM) and obtain cell count and viability using Trypan Blue.",
    "Calculate the amount of required antibodies (mAb), FcR blocking reagent and TCM in which to label the cells to perform T cell enrichment, as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Put TCM on ice to keep it cold throughout the selection.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1125_6.csv\nmAb: monoclonal antibody; TCM: T cell medium\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 500 × g for 10 min, aspirate supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in the required volume of TCM as determined above.\nAdd the required volume of dog gamma-globulins, gently mix and incubate for 10–15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd the primary antibodies, gently mix and incubate for 30 min at 2°C–8°C.\nAt the end of the incubation, wash out the excess of unbound mAb by adding at least 2 mL TCM / 10⁷ cells and up to 50 mL total TCM. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min and completely remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nOptional: Repeat this step once. While centrifuging the cells, calculate the volumes of TCM and anti-Mouse IgG MicroBeads required to resuspend the cell suspension in 80 μL TCM / 10⁷ cells and provide 20 μL microbeads / 10⁷ cells.\nResuspend cell pellet in 80 μL TCM / 10⁷ total cells.\nResuspend anti-Mouse IgG MicroBeads by vortexing for 30 s. Immediately, add 20 μL of Anti-Mouse IgG MicroBeads per 10⁷ cells.\nMix well and incubate for 15 min at 2°C–8°C.\nWash twice with TCM up to 50 mL, remove 200 μL for further flow cytometry analysis at the end of the selection. This will serve as the pre-selection control sample. Then, centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min. During this time,\nSterilize MACS multistand and MidiMACS separator with ethanol and set them in the hood with a rack for collection tubes. Let dry.\nLabel 2 FACS tubes as “flow-through”, “antibody-bound”.",
    "Place LS column(s) in the separator and 50 mL tube(s) in a rack under the column(s) without touching the tip(s). Note: LS columns bind up to 1 × 108 cells. One column every 108 cells will be required.\nRinse with 3 mL cold TCM and discard the flow-through.\nReplace the collection tube(s) with new 50mL tube(s), that will receive the flow-through enriched for the T cells.\nAspirate the supernatant from centrifuged cells and resuspend the cell pellet in TCM at 1.0 × 108 cells / 500μL.\nApply the cell suspension onto the column and collect flow-through containing unlabeled cells.\n(Optional) Close the “flow-through” tube with the unlabeled cells. If the antibody-bound fraction is needed for further studies, keep the “flow-through” tube in ice or at 4°C and retrieve the antibody-bound fraction as follows:\nOnce the upper chamber is empty and after the column stops dripping, add 3 mL of TCM. Repeat twice for a total of 3 washes.\nRemove LS column from the separator, place it on a new 15 mL conical tube, immediately pipette 5 mL TCM in the column chamber and firmly push the plunger provided with the column to flush out the antibody-bound cells.\nCombine the unlabeled cells from all “flow-through” tubes in a 50 mL conical tube. Add 10 mL TCM. Gently mix by pipetting up and down and remove 20 μL for counting and viability check by Trypan Blue.\nRemove 100,000 cells and check purity by flow cytometry. More than 90% of mononuclear cells in the flow-through should be T lymphocytes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1125-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Purity check after canine T cell selection",
    "Representative plots showing T cell enrichment after MACS negative selection. Cells were labeled with anti-canine CD3, CD5, CD4 and CD8a mAb for 30 min at 2°C–8°C. At the end of incubation, 1mL ACK lysing buffer was added for 1–2 min to lyse any contaminating red blood cells, followed by addition of 3 mL TCM and 5-min centrifugation at 500 × g. Supernatants were eliminated by decanting and cells resuspended in 300 μL FACS buffer with 2 μL 7AAD prior to acquisition by flow cytometer. All cells were alive and >90% were CD5+CD3+ cells. Gated on singlets.\nCentrifuge cells in the collection tubes at 500 × g for 5 min, resuspend at 2–4 × 106/mL TCM for immediate use (if virus has been already produced and titrated). Alternatively, resuspend at 20–50 × 106/mL and cryopreserve as follow:\nPre-cool a cell freezing container and cryovials at 2°C–8°C or on ice for a minimum of 30 min.\nResuspend cells in cold TCM at 20 × 106/mL and leave in ice while labeling the cryovials.\nAdd an equivalent volume of chilled 2× freezing medium (20% DMSO/FBS) to achieve a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL. Mix gently.\nDispense cell suspension aliquots into the pre-cooled cryovials, immediately transfer to the cell freezing container and store at −80°C.\nAfter ≥4 h, transfer the cryovials into liquid nitrogen storage. We usually transfer them on the following day.\nActivation and transduction of canine T cells\nTiming: 7 days",
    "Retroviral transduction requires rapidly dividing T cells. The steps below describe effective activation of T cells for ∼44–48 h with anti-canine CD3 and anti-canine CD28 mAb-coated beads in the presence of IL-2. We use cross-reactive recombinant human IL-2. Other cytokines such as IL-15, IL-7 and IL-21 are not necessary to successfully transduce canine T cells, but they may be included from the first day of activation to promote better recovery after thawing and preserve a more favorable T cell memory profile in the long term. Activation of 1.5 ×107 cells is usually sufficient to achieve clinically relevant products. 1–2 ×106 cells are suitable for trial transductions and/or small-scale studies aiming to test the ability of a donor/patient specific cell preparation to be gene engineered and to perform pilot experiments, such as screening of new CAR constructs and immunotherapy combinations.\nActivation: day −2 and −1\nTransduction: day 0\nRecovery post infection: day +1 and +2\nInspection, media supplementation or subculturing: day +3 and +4\nIf using fresh cells, skip this step and proceed to step 26. If transducing cryopreserved cells, thaw T cells as follow:\nRemove cryovials from storage and immediately thaw in the water bath at 37°C for 2–5 min.\nIn a biosafety hood, gently transfer thawed cells to a 50-mL conical tube, rinse the cryovial with 1 mL of warm TCM and add the rinse dropwise (1 drop per 5 s) to the 50-mL conical tube while gently swirling the tube.\nSequentially dilute cells in the 50-mL conical tube by slowly adding 2 mL, 4 mL, 8 mL media, approximately 1 mL/3–5 s with ∼1 min wait between additions. The final volume will be 16 mL. Slow, sequential dilutions, while swirling the tube, help minimize osmotic stress and preserve viability.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C, completely remove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of TCM. Add an additional 9 mL TCM at a speed of 1 mL/3–5 s.\nRepeat centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C, completely remove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of TCM. Determine the cell concentration and viability.\nPlate thawed T cells at 4 × 106 cells/mL (or 2.1 x 106 cells/cm2) in a suitable non-treated plate (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1125_7.csv\nOptional: Let T cells recover for 4–12 h at 37°C in TCM supplemented with IL-2 100 IU/mL.\nNote: A lower T cell density, e.g., 1–2 × 106 cell/mL, can be used when working with fresh T cells.\nOn day -2, activate purified canine T cells with canine activating beads. We generally use a 3:1 ratio to T cells, i.e., 3 beads to 1 T cell, to activate canine T cells prior to CAR-retrovirus infection. However, lower ratios, such as 1:1 and 2:1, have also been successfully employed.\nVortex tube to resuspend beads, which are at a concentration of 4 × 107 / mL.\nTransfer 75 μL beads / 106 cells to a sterile tube. Scale up or down accordingly.\nWash with at least 1 mL of TCM or the same volume of beads. Place on DynaMag magnet for 1 min or until supernatant is clear. Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the beads. Remove tube from magnet.\nRepeat step c for a total of 3 washes\nAfter the last wash, add the cells to the tube with the bead pellet. Gently resuspend the beads in the cell/TCM suspension by pipetting the mixture up and down until the beads are completely resuspended.",
    "If working with thawed cells that were plated at a density of 4 ×106 cells/mL in TCM supplemented with cytokines, simply harvest them and use this suspension to resuspend the beads. When done, replate at the same density.\nIf working with fresh T cells that have just been purified (see step 24) use 1 mL TCM to resuspend the bead pellet, then add the required number of cells in TCM, aiming for a final 2–4 × 106 cell/mL density. Add IL-2 100 U/mL (omit this if already added in step 26).\nPlace in incubator at 38.8°C for 12–16 h.\nOn day -1, check T cell health and activation under an inverted microscope. Activated T cells form clumps and blast, acquiring spindle-like morphology (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). A decrease in the number of T cells might be noticed, likely due to activation-induced cell death (AICD).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1125-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Canine T cell activation using canine-specific anti-CD3/CD28 dynabeads\n(A) Activation failure: T cells are uniformly rounded and do not clump.\n(B) Successful activation: most T cells appear enlarged with spindle-shaped morphology. Cells converge toward each other forming clusters. Scale bars indicate 50 μm.\nOptional: Consider an extra supplementation of IL-2 100 IU/mL if cells do not show morphological changes consistent with activation (see troubleshooting, problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and problem 3 for additional details).\nOn the day of transduction (day 0),\nCheck cells under the microscope and ∼4 h prior to transduction supplement with extra IL-2 200 IU/mL to ensure that they are dividing as rapidly as possible when exposed to the viral supernatant.",
    "Prepare RetroNectin coated plate(s) by diluting 10 μL RetroNectin stock in 990 μL PBS and dispensing it into appropriate non-treated, cell culture-grade plate, i.e., 2 mL/well in a 6 well plate for each 1.5 ×106 cells to transduce, or 1 mL/well in a 24 well plate for each 3 ×105 cells to transduce. Allow the plate to stand for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the RetroNectin solution and replace with the same volume of sterile 2% BSA/PBS solution. Allow the plate to stand for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: Use freshly made, sterile BSA. Poor blocking may lead to non-specific binding of RetroNectin to proteins in the media rather than virus and results in lower transduction efficiency.\nDuring BSA blocking, remove virus aliquot from −80°C. Thaw on ice for ∼20 min, then keep at 20°C–25°C for ∼10 min and determine the volume of virus that will be used to transduce the canine T cells (VT)\nNote: We have observed that compared to unconcentrated supernatants, RetroNectin concentrated RD114-pseudotyped virus is associated with higher transduction efficiencies of K562 cells, which result in greater functional titers when calculating the TU/mL. On this basis, we empirically correct the TU/mL values, as determined in step 6, by a factor 10, and load RetroNectin-coated wells with the required volume to achieve MOIs of 2–10 following the equation VT (mL) = N × MOI / (10 × TU/mL). N: number of cells per well (1.5 ×106/well in a 6-well plate; 3 ×105/well in a 24-well plate). MOI: number of times that a cell could be theoretically infected (2–10).\nCompletely remove the BSA solution and wash the plate once with at least the same volume of sterile 25mM Hepes/PBS solution (2.5% v/v).\nCritical: Residual BSA may result in lower cell viability.",
    "Remove wash solution. Immediately, add the required volume of virus as determined in step 28d plus serum-free IMDM to achieve 3 mL/well if using a 6-well plate, or 1 mL if using a 24-well plate. As control, add only serum-free IMDM to 1 well for side-by-side expansion of untransduced (UTD) T cells.\nCritical: Do not let the wells dry. Remove wash solution immediately before adding virus. If virus is not completely thawed, place the vial in 37°C waterbath for a few seconds. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles as this reduces virus titers.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g for 2 h at 32°C to facilitate binding of virus particles with RetroNectin reagent.\nDuring the last ∼15 min of centrifugation, harvest the T cells. Gently pipette up and down to disperse clusters and generate a single cell suspension, as this maximizes the number of cells transduced. Dilute to 6 × 105cells/mL with TCM supplemented with IL-2 at 100 IU/mL.\nDiscard the supernatant from the RetroNectin plate, but do not allow the plate to dry. Gently and without touching the well bottom with the tip, wash the plate with at least the same volume of 1× PBS.\nAdd 2.5 mL cells/well for a total of 1.5 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate or 500 μL/well for a total of 3 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate.\nIncubate at 38.8°C for 36–48h.\nOn day +2, add an equal volume of fresh media supplemented with IL-2 at 100–200 IU/mL (final concentration 50–100 IU/mL).\nNote: While cytokines may have a positive impact on cell viability and expandability, extra cytokine supplementation may promote competitive proliferation of residual non-transduced cells.\nDay +4: assessment of transduction efficiency\nTiming: 4 hours",
    "On day +4, we assess CAR T transduction efficiency by flow cytometry. Prior to flow cytometric analysis, activating beads and bead-bound cells are removed on a magnet separator. Identity and purity of CAR cells are then evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry using a CAR and T cell specific panel. Our anti-canine CD20 CAR harbors a murine scFv that can be detected via polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulin reagents. Different scFv may require different detection reagents. Assessment of co-engineered ‘marker genes’ can also be used as surrogate of CAR expression. The flow cytometry panel and labeling procedure will need to be optimized accordingly.\nBead removal: 1 h\nFlow cytometry assessment: 3 h\nRecover cells from RetroNectin coated wells by gently pipetting up and down several times. Transfer and pool cells into a suitable 15 or 50 mL conical tube. Remove an aliquot for counting and viability check. Ideally, cell density should be >1 ×106/mL prior to debeading.\nNote down the cell number and label a new flask or plate, that will receive the unbound cell fraction. Place the tube in appropriate DynaMag magnet for 2 min to allow the beads to migrate to the side.\nWith a suitable serological pipette, carefully remove cell suspension from the middle of the tube and transfer to the new, labeled culture vessel.\nRinse well(s) with the same volume of TCM to recover any residual cells. Remove tube from magnet and resuspend beads with the media used to wash the well(s). Repeat steps 31–32 and combine the supernatant with the cells already transferred into the new vessel.\nGently resuspend cells by pipetting up and down several times and adjust concentration at 1 × 106 cells/mL in warm TCM supplemented with IL-2 to achieve a final concentration of 50–100 IU IL-2/mL.",

Decant supernatants and treat cells with 10 μL of canine gamma-globulins for 10 min at 20°C–25°C. This will help reduce non-specific binding of mAb.\nProceed with CAR labeling as required (see representative CAR labeling procedure for our anti-canine CD20 CAR in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Additional mAb can be included, such as anti-canine CD3, CD5, CD4 and CD8a mAb, to characterize canine T cell phenotype, or to detect marker genes co-expressed with the CAR. Viability can be assessed with 7AAD viability dye.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1125-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Assessment of anti-canine CD20 CAR expression and transduction efficiency\n(A) Reagents used to label UTD and CAR cells. UTD and CAR cells were treated with 10 μL of dog gamma-globulins in ∼ 100 μL for 10 min at 20°C–25°C, followed by incubation with 0.5 μL (0.5μg) of Biotinylated Rabbit anti-mouse (RaM) IgG H+L for 30 min at 20°C–25°C (first step). At the end of incubation, the unbound immunoglobulins were removed by adding 4 mL FACS buffer, followed by 5-min centrifugation at 500 × g and complete removal of the supernatant by decanting the supernatant and gently touching the rim of the tubes to tissue paper, for a total of two washes. T cells were incubated with anti-dog CD3, CD5, CD4 and CD8 mAb and Streptavidin for 20–30 min at 2°C–8°C (second step). At the end of incubation, cells were washed once as above and resuspended in 300 μL FACS buffer with 2 μL 7AAD prior to data acquisition by flow cytometer.\n(B) Representative plots showing CAR transduction efficiency relative to UTD cells.",
    "Acquire ≥ 50,000 events on a flow cytometer to determine transduction efficiency (see troubleshooting, problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for details on how to improve transduction efficiencies).\nCanine CAR T cell expansion and final assessment\nTiming: 5–8 days\nMaintain CAR T cells at 38.8°C at ∼ 1 × 106 cells/mL in TCM supplemented with IL-2 to a final concentration of 50–100 IU/mL.\nNote: While a greater fold-expansion of total cells may be achieved by using higher doses of cytokines, lower concentrations will prevent the relative expansion of residual non-transduced cells co-existing in the CAR cell vessels.\nCount and adjust cell concentration every other day. Scale up aiming for 0.53–1.2 × 106 cells / cm2 in T25 flasks (up to 8–10 mL, flat) and T75 flasks (up to 25–30 mL, flat) (see troubleshooting, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for useful tips for expansion of CAR T cells) .\n9–12 days after transduction, repeat flow cytometry assessment to confirm CAR expression and CAR T cell purity as on day +4.\nEnd-of-expansion CAR T cells can be used for functional in vitro assays, such as flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays (see Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] for further details on flow cytometry based cytotoxicity assays). Alternatively, cells can be cryopreserved for later analysis and use as described in step 24 (see troubleshooting, problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for tips on how to preserve functionality of cryopreserved CAR T cell products).\nNote: End-of-expansion CAR T cells can be infused in dogs to investigate efficacy and/or safety of canine CAR T cell products in vivo in the clinically relevant setting of immunocompetent pet dogs with spontaneous cancers (see below Ancillary considerations for the use of canine CAR T cells in pet dogs: Dose and QC tests[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.7]).\nAncillary considerations for the use of canine CAR T cells in pet dogs: Dose and QC tests",
    "The use of autologous, genetically re-directed T cells has shown unprecedented success in the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, further implementation is needed to improve their efficacy particularly in solid cancers. Pet dogs share a close phylogenetic relationship with man and spontaneously develop tumors with similar clinical, immunological, biological, and genetic features as their human counterparts. Dogs and humans share the same environment that may influence tumor development and progression. Further, the size, longevity and physiology of the canine immune system resemble those of man. Lastly, comparable barriers to effective immunotherapy exist between dogs and humans. As many canine cancer patients are treated with the same therapies as humans, dogs are being increasingly recognized as a much needed, clinically relevant, parallel patient population in which to evaluate next generation cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies and to identify correlative biomarkers of response.\nThe Beau Biden National Cancer Moonshot Initiative provides funding mechanisms to support a network for canine cancer immunotherapy clinical trials (PRECINCT) aimed at catalyzing research productivity within a collaborative network and accelerating human translation through comparative oncology (www.precinctnetwork.org[href=http://www.precinctnetwork.org]). This, together with a standardized protocol for efficient transduction and expansion of canine CAR T cell, can greatly facilitate the use of the dog “model” by human and comparative oncology researchers, and promote the performance of multicenter clinical trials, with data harmonization across institutions.\nThe protocol described here enables effective engineering of primary canine T cells and their expansion up to clinical scale (see expected results). Our recommended target cell dose for infusion in canine patients is 0.2 to 5.0 × 106 CAR positive T cells/kg body weight. In addition, a series of quality control (QC) tests are recommended on end-of-expansion CAR T cell products. Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] summarizes a list of potential QC tests.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1125_8.csv\naCAR expression could be also confirmed by PCR.",
    "bThe same flow cytometry panel used for day-4 and end-of-expansion assessment may be sufficient to determine the proportion of CAR+ cells, T cells and viable cells.\ncGram staining can be performed in-house using commercially available kits, e.g., Remel™ Gram Staining Kit, Thermo Scientific™, cat# R40080, or at commercial microbiology laboratories, i.e., the microbiology laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\ndMycoplasma contamination can be quickly detected using a biochemical, luciferase-based assay that selectively detects the activity of mycoplasmal enzymes, e.g., MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).\neStrategies to monitor for the emergence of Replication-Competent Retrovirus (RCR), including RD114 pseudotyped retrovirus in canines, have been previously described (Narushima et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). These may entail qPCR assays and should be performed on CAR T cell samples during manufacturing and after infusion on patient samples obtained at defined time points.\nfTo assess IFNy release, we use the Canine IFN-gamma DuoSet ELISA kit, RnDSystems Cat# DY781B, according to the manufacture’s recommendations Canine-IFN-gamma-Duoset-ELISA[href=https://www.rndsystems.com/products/canine-ifn-gamma-duoset-elisa_dy781b%20-%20product-datasheets].
