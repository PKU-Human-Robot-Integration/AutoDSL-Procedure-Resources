Workflow to evaluate the cholesterol accepting capacity of acceptors in mouse primary cortical astrocytes\n(A–E) Graphical summary depicting the steps to evaluate the cholesterol accepting capacity of acceptors in mouse primary cortical astrocytes: (A) Primary APOE-knockout (KO) astrocyte culture; (B) Plating astrocytes for experiment; (C) Preparing 10× BODIPY-cholesterol; (D) Cell treatment with BODIPY; (E) Cell treatment with apoA1; data collection.\nCell plating\nTiming: 1 h\nCells are plated onto a 48-well plate one day prior to BODIPY-cholesterol treatment. The number of wells prepared depends on how many cholesterol acceptors are being tested (see note below).\nPassage primary astrocytes:\nAspirate culture medium from cells.\nRinse cells once with warm DMEM/F-12.\nCell dissociation:\nAspirate DMEM/F-12.\nAdd 5 mL of room temperature accutase to the cells.\nIncubate 10 min in a tissue culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nGently tap the sides of the flask to lift the cells off.\nAdd 5 mL of warm culture medium and pipette up and down a couple of times (∼10 times) with a 10-mL serological pipette. Avoid bubbles.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15-mL falcon tube and gently pipette up and down to further dissociate cell clumps.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of culture medium and pipette up and down with a 1 mL pipette to ensure the presence of single cells (∼30 times). Avoid bubbles.\nCell counting:\nTake 10 μL of the cell suspension and mix thoroughly with 10 μL of trypan blue.\nLoad 10 μL of the mixture onto a disposable cell counting slide and count cells (manually or using an automated cell counter).\nCell plating:",
    "Resuspend cells to a final density of 0.1 × 106 cells/mL in culture medium.\nPlate 25 × 10ˆ3 cells per well in a 48-well plate (250 μL per well).\nGently shake the plate to distribute the cells evenly across the well.\nIncubate overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2 to allow for the cells to settle and attach to the plate.\nNote: Alternative counting methods can be performed (step 2). The number of wells prepared (step 3) is dependent on the number of cholesterol acceptor being tested. Typically, we test each condition in triplicate (at least), and we include a baseline control (no acceptor).\nCritical: It is important to ensure that the primary astrocytes are not clumped together so cells can be plated as single cells.\nPreparing 10× BODIPY-cholesterol\nTiming: 5 h\nThe following steps describe the preparation of the stock BODIPY-cholesterol solution. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] depicts the workflow of this specific procedure.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2308-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of 10× BODIPY-cholesterol stock solution\nPictures depicting the different steps of preparing 10× BODIPY-cholesterol1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]: BODIPY-cholesterol suspension in organic solvent should look fluorescent green2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Formation of a lipid film is achieved by evaporating solvent under N23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; a lipid film has formed on the walls of the glass vial and should appear red; (4) the lipid film is resuspended in DMEM containing 20 Mm MβCD; (5) suspension is sonicated for 30 min at 37°C; (6) and incubated for 3 h at 37°C prior to centrifugation; (7) fluorescence of 10× BODIPY-cholesterol is measured and recorded.\nPrepare stock solutions of starting materials:\nDilute cholesterol at 10 mg/mL in chloroform. Store at −20°C for up to one year.\nDilute TopFluor Cholesterol (BODIPY-cholesterol) at 1 mg/mL in DMSO. Aliquots can be stored at −20°C for several months.\nPrepare MβCD at 20 mM in DMEM/F-12, no phenol red.",
    "Dissolve 66 mg in 2.5 mL DMEM/F-12, no phenol red.\nNote: 2.5 mL of 10× BODIPY-cholesterol yields 25 mL of 1× BODIPY-cholesterol, which allows for the treatment of 100 wells. The amount of 10× BODIPY-cholesterol should be tailored to the number of wells needed to be treated.\nIn a glass test tube, add:\n10 mg/mL cholesterol in chloroform to a final concentration of 0.1 mM (V = 9.75 μL for a final volume of 2.5 mL of 10× BODIPY-cholesterol).\n1 mg/mL TopFluor Cholesterol (BODIPY-cholesterol) in DMSO to a final concentration of 0.05 mM (V = 72.5 μL for a final volume of 2.5 mL of 10× BODIPY-cholesterol).\n(See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 1).\nDry the lipid mixture in a chemical hood in the dark under a flow of N2 until formation of a thin film (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], steps 2 and 3).\nResuspend the lipid film in 20 mM MβCD in DMEM/F-12, no phenol red (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 4; 2.5 mL of 20 mM MβCD in DMEM/F-12 for a final volume of 2.5 mL of 10× BODIPY-cholesterol).\nSonicate the lipid suspension in a water bath set to 37°C for 30 min, to promote solubilization (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 5).\nTransfer the sonicated lipid suspension to a capped glass vial and incubate in an orbital incubator shaker at 250 rpm, 37°C for 3 h.\nSonicate the lipid suspension again in a water bath set to 37°C for 30 min.\nTransfer the lipid suspension to a 15-mL falcon tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 4,696 × g to pellet the non-solubilized BODIPY-cholesterol.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant to a capped glass vial wrapped in foil (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 6). This supernatant is the final 10× BODIPY-cholesterol stock solution.\nMeasure the fluorescence of 10× BODIPY cholesterol:",
    "Add 100 μL to one well of a 96-well black microplate.\nMeasure fluorescence in a plate reader:\nSet the excitation wavelength to 482 nm.\nSet the emission wavelength to 515 nm.\nKeep a record of the fluorescence measured in RFU.\nNote: Using our plate reader, we typically get a fluorescence measurement over 2,000,000 RFU. The fluorescence of 10× BODIPY-cholesterol will vary with each preparation but we do not recommend using a stock solution with a fluorescence measurement below 1,500,000 RFU. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nStore 10× BODIPY-Cholesterol at 4°C for up to one week.\nNote: Other protocols filter their lipid suspension through a membrane filter to discard any undissolved BODIPY-cholesterol. We find that 10× BODIPY-cholesterol binds to PVDF membrane filters, resulting in a dramatic decrease in fluorescence post-filtering.\nPause point: 10× BODIPY-cholesterol can be kept at 4°C for up to a week in the dark. We would not recommend using 10× BODIPY-cholesterol after one week as there could be both a decrease in fluorescence, and the risk of formation of cholesteryl esters, which would not efflux from cells.\nCritical: Cyclodextrins can form complexes with cholesterol and fluorescent cholesterol analogs, facilitating their solubilization into aqueous solutions. It is thus important not to omit it from the preparation. One way to ensure that the 10× BODIPY-cholesterol solution was adequately prepared is by checking its fluorescence with a plate reader (ex: 482 nm; em: 515 nm). We find that a 10× BODIPY-cholesterol with low fluorescence (below 1,000,000 RFU) yields poor results.\nCholesterol efflux assay\nTiming: 2 days",
    "The steps below describe the loading of cells with BODIPY-cholesterol. This is followed by an equilibration step with cAMP to up-regulate ABCA1, essential to facilitate ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Finally, cholesterol acceptors are added to the cells. Their cholesterol accepting capacity is defined by the associated baseline corrected fractional efflux of BODIPY-cholesterol (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] below). All following experimental steps are performed in the presence of an acetyl-choline esterase inhibitor (Sandoz 58-035) to inhibit the formation of cholesteryl esters. ApoA1 at 10 μg/mL was used as cholesterol acceptors to illustrate this assay.\nLoading the cells with 1× BODIPY-cholesterol:\nDilute 10× BODIPY-cholesterol to 1× BODIPY-cholesterol in DMEM/F-12, no phenol red supplemented with Sandoz (an acetyl-choline esterase inhibitor) at 2 μg/mL (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] above).\nAspirate culture medium from cells.\nAdd 250 μL of 1× BODIPY-cholesterol in each experimental well.\nIncubate for 1 h in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nEquilibration with cAMP:\nPrepare Equilibration medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] above).\nRemove 1× BODIPY-cholesterol from cells.\nRinse cells twice with DMEM/F-12, no phenol red supplemented with 2 μg/mL Sandoz 58-035.\nAdd 250 μL Equilibration medium per well.\nIncubate overnight (∼16 h) in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nAddition of ApoA1:\nApoA1 was diluted to 10 μg/mL in DMEM/F-12, no phenol red, supplemented with 2 μg/mL Sandoz.\nThe equilibration medium was aspirated and 250 μL of 10 μg/mL apoA1 were added to each well. ApoA1 was tested in in triplicate.\n250 μL of DMEM/F-12, no phenol red, supplemented with 2 μg/mL Sandoz, were added in triplicate to measure the baseline cholesterol efflux (in the absence of apoA1).\nIncubate for 4 h in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nMeasurement of BODIPY-cholesterol:\nTransfer medium from each well to a 96-well plate.\nRinse cells once with PBS.",
    "Add 250 μL of RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor to cells and incubate at 4°C on a shaker for 20 min.\nTransfer 95 μL of culture medium to a 96-black fluorescence plate in duplicate.\nMeasure BODIPY-cholesterol in the medium using a plate reader (ex: 482 nm; em: 515 nm).\nTransfer RIPA cell lysate from each well to a 96-well plate.\nCentrifuge plate for 20 min at 2,000 × g.\nTransfer 95 μL of culture medium to a 96-well black fluorescence plate in duplicate.\nMeasure BODIPY-cholesterol in the lysate using a plate reader (ex: 482 nm; em: 515 nm).\nNote: We recommend using a 96-well plate to store the medium and lysate to avoid pipetting variation between each sample.\nCritical: It is important to ensure the presence of Sandoz, the acetyl-choline esterase inhibitor, at all steps to avoid esterification of cholesterol and BODIPY-cholesterol. Up-regulation of ABCA1 with 0.3 mM cAMP is also essential to facilitate a measurable cholesterol efflux."
