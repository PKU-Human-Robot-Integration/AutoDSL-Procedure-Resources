    "The study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Kentucky (protocol 00903M2005).\n1. Manufacturing and testing the nanopipettes\nCreate a program in the micropipette puller to obtain pipettes with a resistance between 200 and 400 MΩ, which corresponds to inner tip diameters of approximately 50-70 nm. The parameters will depend on the micropipette puller. To obtain short pipettes with non-flexible fine tips, check in the operational manual of the puller.\nUse borosilicate glass capillaries with outer/inner diameters of 1/0.58 mm and an inner filament to facilitate filling. The length of the pipette is crucial because it determines the frequency of the lateral mechanical resonance of the pipette. The longer is the pipette, the lower is the resonant frequency and the harder is to avoid this resonance.\n\tNOTE: The user should try to manufacture the shortest pipette the holder can accept. The length of nanopipettes in this experiment is usually 15-25 mm (Figure 2A).\nFill the nanopipette up to its middle point (Figure 2A) with a bath solution, either Leibovitz's L-15 or with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 20 mM D-glucose (to adjust osmolarity). To avoid potential artefacts, use the same solution that will be used in the bath for recordings.\nUsing an optical microscope with a magnification of 10x, check for any bubbles at the tip of the pipette (Figure 2B). The bubbles would prevent the current flow. It is harder to remove bubbles in the pipettes that have been pulled several hours before the experiment. Therefore, it is recommended to pull new pipettes with every experiment.",
    "Once the pipette is free of bubbles, mount it in the HPICM pipette holder (Figure 2C).\nPlace the sample (tissue or calibration standard) on the custom-built chamber and add 4 mL of the above-mentioned bath solution.\nPlace the custom-built chamber on the HPICM stage and introduce the ground electrode in the solution.\nMake sure that the voltage being applied to the pipette by the patch clamp amplifier is zero.\nMove the pipette in Z until it touches the liquid.\nSet the amplifier offset to zero and then add +100 mV to check the pipette current.\nCalculate the resistance and the diameter of the pipette, based on Ohm's law:\nR = V/I\n\twhere R is the resistance (MOhm), V is the voltage applied to the nanopipette (mV) and I is the current flowing through the nanopipette (nA).\n\t\nCalculate the inner diameter of the pipette as described elsewhere according to the following formula12:\nIDTip = 1000/ √R\n\t\tNOTE: The ideal resistance value is between 200 and 400 MΩ. Pipettes with a resistance higher than 400 MΩ might lead to an unstable current due to their small size (< 50 nm inner diameter). On the contrary, pipettes with resistances smaller than 200 MΩ are too large (> 70 nm inner diameter) and would not resolve small features. Its recommended to start imaging with the pipettes of 200 MΩ resistance, as they are easier to manufacture and tend to provide less electrical noise.\n2. Minimizing sample drifts and vibrations\nNOTE: To decrease the mechanical noise in the system during imaging, mount the samples on the custom-built chambers that utilize thick glass slides (~1.2 mm):\nRemove the glass portion off a 50 mm glass-bottom dish, leaving the plastic walls intact.",
    "Glue the plastic portion of the cell culture dish on top of the thick glass slide with silicon glue.\nMount the calibration sample in the middle of the chamber (on top of the glass slide) using either silicon glue or thin double-sided tape.\nFirmly secure the chamber onto the HPICM stage using double-sided tape.\nDuring imaging, close the Faraday cage and cover it with a blanket to minimize electrical interference and thermal drift, correspondingly.\n3.Testing the resolution with AFM calibration standards \nNOTE: It is strongly recommended to image AFM standards (see Table of Materials) before imaging live cells in order to troubleshoot the system and test its resolution in the X-Z-Y axes. The calibration standards have silicon dioxide pillars and holes of different shapes but fixed heights/depths (i.e., 20 or 100 nm) on a 5 x 5 mm silicon chip. Starting with the 100 nm calibration standard is recommended, to guarantee that the Z resolution is below 100 nm. After achieving a successful high-resolution image of the pillars or holes in this calibration sample (Figure 3A), move to the 20 nm standard. If the imaging of the latter standard is successful (Figure 3B), the resolution in the Z axis is guaranteed to be below 20 nm and appropriate for the imaging of the hair cell stereocilia bundles12. The following steps are used to image both calibration standards.\nAttach the calibration standard to the chamber with silicon glue.\nAdd 4 mL of HBSS to the chamber to cover the calibration sample. Then, secure the chamber to the XY stage of the HPICM setup using double-sided tape.\nClamp the magnetic holder of the ground electrode to the stage near the chamber and immerse the electrode into the bath solution (Figure 1B).",
    "Mount the nanopipette into the holder, immerse it into the bath solution, and set its current to ~1 nA following the steps described in Section 1.\nPosition the nanopipette approximately above the center of the calibration standard using a course patch-clamp manipulator. Visual inspection is usually enough for this positioning, since the area covered by silicon dioxide structures is relatively large (1 x 1 mm). In contrast to the organ of Corti explants (see below), calibration standard is non-transparent and, therefore, a more precise positioning guided by optical imaging is not possible for this sample.\nIncrease the setpoint while monitoring the signal from the sensor of the Z piezo actuator on an oscilloscope in real time. After establishing a stable repeatable Z approach cycle (as in Figure 1C, bottom), decrease the setpoint to the value that is just above the point of instability. This procedure would ensure the optimal setpoint for this particular nanopipette.\nMove the pipette down at a speed of ~5 µm/s with a patch clamp micromanipulator until it reaches the sample. At this moment, the bottom level of the real-time Z positioning signal (Figure 1C) will increase, indicating that the nanopipette is withdrawn due to \"sensing\" the sample surface. Any further movement of the nanopipette will result in further positive shift of Z-positioning signal.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to exceed the upper limit of Z piezo actuator movement.\nStart imaging at low resolution (see Table 1). Due to uneven mounting of the AFM standard, the highest point of the area of interest may be unknown. Therefore, set the amplitude of pipette retraction (hop amplitude) to at least 200-500 nm.",
    "Once the highest point of the sample in the imaging area is identified, decrease the hop amplitude. A smaller hop amplitude allows faster scanning, which is preferred for high resolution imaging due to diminished effects of the drifts and decreased vibration.\nBefore moving the pipette to a new X-Y location, retract it about 200 µm in the Z axis to prevent any undesired collisions with the sample.\n\tNOTE: In cases when the nanopipette is not aligned with the center of the calibration standard, it is possible that the scanning starts just off the area of surface features.\nAfter the area of interest is found, start imaging at a higher resolution (see Table 1).\n4. Making custom-built chambers to secure the cochlear explants\nNOTE: Mount the cochlear explants in the chambers with custom-built clamping systems that utilize either flexible glass pipettes (step 4.1) (Figure 4A) or dental floss (step 4.2) (Figure 4B). The glass pipette chamber could be sterilized and used for the cultured organs of Corti, while dental floss chamber provides a more secure holding of the sample and a control over stereocilia bundle orientation during mounting. These custom-built chambers need to be prepared in advance, but they can be cleaned and re-used in several imaging sessions.\nMake a chamber using flexible glass pipettes\n\t\nPull two thin and flexible glass fibers from glass capillaries using a pipette puller. Our pulled glass fibers typically measure 1 to 2 cm in length and are fairly flexible.\nPlace a small drop of the silicone elastomer on top of a glass coverslip. Use coverslips of 2 cm in diameter.\nPlace the ends of two glass fibers on the silicone drop and arrange the fibers to have a small degree of separation between them (Figure 4A).",
    "Place the coverslip on a hot plate to quickly cure the elastomer (1 to 3 min).\nGlue the coverslip onto the glass bottom of the chamber described in Section 2 using a small amount (1-3 µL) of silicone elastomer and allowing it to cure overnight.\nMaking a chamber using dental floss:\n\t\nRemove the glass portion of a 50 mm glass-bottom dish, leaving the plastic walls intact. Then glue the plastic portion of the cell culture dish on top of a 1.2 mm thick glass slide with silicon glue.\nMount one plastic coverslip (6.5 x 6.5 mm) with the same glue to the center of the chamber. Then repeat the process with another coverslip on top of the previous one.\nMount two small tungsten or gold-plated wires (12 mm of length and ~0.5 mm in diameter) with silicon glue, each one at opposites sides of the cover slides. Glue them far enough (> 10-15 mm) from the cover slides (Figure 4B).\nSeparate two dental floss strands and place them on top of the cover slides and secure them to the wires by making a knot. Leave a small gap between both strands (Figure 4B, short arrows).\nClean the chambers after every use\n\t\nGently remove the tissue from the chamber using fine tweezers and lightly scrape any tissue residues left behind.\nRinse the chamber first with 70% ethanol and then with distilled water.\nRepeat the rinse cycle if needed.\nPlace the chamber upside down on a filter paper to let it dry until next experiment. The chambers do not need to be sterilized, unless culturing of the organ of Corti is planned after the imaging.\n5. Dissecting the rodent organ of Corti\nPerform dissection of the young postnatal cochlear explants as described in detail elsewhere13.",
    "For HPICM imaging, dissect the organ of Corti from mice between postnatal days 3 and 6 (P3-6), and from rats between postnatal days 3 and 8 (P3-8).\n\tNOTE: Older hair cells are more susceptible to the damage during dissection and, therefore, cannot be used for hours-long time lapse HPICM imaging.\nDo not forget to remove the tectorial membrane before HPICM imaging.\nImmediately after dissection, secure the tissue in one of the chambers described in Section 4, either placing it under the flexible glass pipettes or under the two dental floss strands (Figure 4). Pre-fill these chambers with 4 mL of the room temperature bath solution (to minimize bubble formation).\n6. Imaging of the auditory hair cells\nMount the chamber with a freshly isolated organ of Corti on the X-Y piezo stage using double-sided tape and make sure that it is firmly secured to minimize chamber drift in X and Y axes (Figure 1B).\nFollow steps in Section 1 to place a new nanopipette and check for the correct pipette resistance.\nUsing patch clamp micromanipulator, position nanopipette over the hair cell region, while observing the organ of Corti explant in an inverted microscope.\nCheck if the system is stable with a setpoint of 0.5% or lower by recording the real-time current and Z positioning signal on the oscilloscope (as in Figure 1C). If Z signal is not stable, try to decrease the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter of the patch clamp amplifier. However, it cannot be lower than the response time of Z piezo actuator (to avoid pipette collision with the sample due to delayed current readings).\n\tNOTE: In practice, 5 kHz setting of this filter is found to be optimal. It is better to replace the nanopipette, if Z-signal is still unstable.",
    "Once a stable recording is achieved, determine the optimal setpoint and approach the sample with HPICM pipette as described in the steps 3.6-3.7 above.\nFirst, perform low resolution imaging (see Table 1), using a hop amplitude of at least 6 to 8 µm. To image tall structures such as the hair cell stereocilia bundles, make sure that the hop amplitude is enough to avoid collision with these structures.\n\tNOTE: If the hop amplitude is not enough, the pipette will not be able to jump over a stereocilium and there will be an imminent collision. The collision of the HPICM probe with a stereocilium may damage the hair bundle. Therefore, in cases when the height of the stereocilia bundle is uncertain, use a bigger hop amplitude.\nGet familiar with the topography of the organ of Corti by first performing and/or studying images obtained with scanning electron microscopy (Figure 5).\n\tNOTE: If the HPICM image is uniform with the heights smaller than 1 µm in every imaging point, the pipette is likely scanning the glass bottom and not the tissue. Alternatively, the pipette may \"land\" on a different region of the cochlear explant, away from the hair cells.\nIf the pipette needs to be moved to a new X-Y location, retract it about 500 nm to avoid collisions with any tall features within the tissue. Repeat low-resolution HPICM imaging until the region of interest with the hair cells is found.\nAfter the region of interest is found, start imaging at a higher resolution (see Table 1). Try to spend less than 15 min when imaging a whole hair bundle.",
    "NOTE: The hair cell bundles in the live tissue are not still but may change their orientation, for example, due to shape changes in the underlying supporting cells. Therefore, the images may exhibit movement artefacts if the image acquisition is too slow.\nOnce again, determine the tallest features in the low-resolution images before the decreasing the hop amplitude for high-resolution imaging. For a region of interest covering entire hair cell bundle, reduce the hop amplitude to 4-5 µm, while for a relatively small and \"flat\" region within the bundle (e.g., 2 x 2 µm) reduce the hop amplitude even further, down to less than 1 µm, thereby increasing the speed and resolution of imaging.\n7. Image processing\nNOTE: Imaging artefacts are common in HPICM imaging. Some of them can be corrected by image acquisition parameters, while others require post-processing either with a specialized SICM viewer or with more general data-processing programs like ImageJ or MatLab. Here we describe the most common artefacts and how we fix them with SICM viewer.\nPerform slope correction\n\t​NOTE: It is not obvious for a beginner, but human eye cannot resolve sub-micrometer size features at the surface of a cell, if the imaging area has an overall slope of equal or larger size (Figure 3A,B, left). Therefore, it is necessary to determine the average slope of an imaged area (by fitting HPICM 3D image data to a single plane) and subtract it from the HPICM image (Figure 3A,B, middle).\n\t\nClick Open to open an image with SICM viewer.\nSelect the Image Correction tab.\nSelect the Correct Slope tab.\nPress the Correct Slope button for an automated slope correction.\nPerform line alignment",
    "​NOTE: As mentioned before, mechanical and/or thermal drifts as well as cell movement artefacts represent a significant problem in HPICM imaging. A small drift with a speed of less than a micrometer per minute is usually not noticeable in a regular patch clamp setup. Yet, it could produce artefacts of several tens of nanometers in HPICM imaging, which is significantly larger than the resolution of HPICM. Therefore, it is not uncommon to encounter sudden jumps in Z axis between two neighboring HPICM scan lines during imaging. This could be corrected by analyzing differences between starting (and/or ending) Z-values in these neighboring scan lines.\n\t\nClick Open to open an image with SICM viewer.\nSelect the Image Correction tab.\nSelect the Correct Slope tab.\nChoose the width of lines to be aligned. Press on the button ButtonDestripeLineFit for an automated line alignment correction.\nPerform noise reduction\n\t​NOTE: While obtaining images with HPICM, small fluctuations in the nanopipette current can lead to the nanopipette stopping far from the surface of the sample, especially with low setpoints. It results in the appearance of small white dots in the image. In order to correct this imaging artefact, it is necessary to identify the imaging points with the Z-value significantly larger than that of the neighbors and replace this value with an average of the neighbors. This is be done by an adjustable median filter.\n\t\nClick Open to open an image with SICM viewer.\nSelect the Image Processing tab.\nSelect the Noise reduction tab.\nSet the Threshold filter (µm) for the pixels to be removed.\nSubscription Required.
