    "This protocol was performed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center under IRB#221597. Patients provided written consent for ex vivo 3D scanning and digital mapping of their surgical specimen prior to surgery and the addition of their scan to a 3D specimen model biorepository. Inclusion criteria were patients 18 and older with a suspected or biopsy-proven head and neck neoplasm undergoing surgical resection. 3D specimen maps were created based on surgeon and pathologist preference and staff availability.\nThis protocol follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committees of the Institutional Review Board (IRB#221597) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation. All patient data have been de-identified.\n1. Setting up the 3D scanner\nIdentify a 3 x 2 ft flat workstation available for scanner setup. Ensure the workstation is a dark environment where the scanner is enclosed or that the lights in the room are turned off. Alternatively, perform 3D scanning within a mobile cart setup as seen in Figure 1.\nSet up the three-legged camera tripod on the flat workstation. Carefully place the 3D scanning camera into the tripod. Angle the camera down toward the workstation at a 60° angle.\nConnect the two-part power cord to an external power source and the back of the camera.\nPlace the scanner turntable 1 foot in front of the 3D camera and tripod setup. Connect the turntable to the camera using the micro-USB cable.\nConnect the camera to the laptop computer using the camera to USB cable. See Figure 2 for the labeled setup.\n\tNOTE: If the laptop computer does not have a USB port, an external USB adapter may be required. An external mouse is recommended.\nTurn off the lights in the workstation to calibrate the scanner to current lighting conditions.",
    "Press and hold the power button on the back of the camera until a blue light appears.\nOpen the 3D capture software on the computer desktop. Center the turntable in the cross projected by the camera.\n\t​NOTE: Ensure the camera is powered on and the lights are off prior to opening the software.\n2. Specimen handling\nObtain the resected oncologic specimen from the surgical team.\nRinse the specimen to remove any blood or excess clots from resection. Gently pat dry.\n\tNOTE: This step is very important to obtain a high-quality scan. The 3D scanner has difficulty picking up data when a specimen is very shiny or has residual blood on the surface.\nPlace the specimen on a flat, clean surface.\nUsing a smartphone camera or digital camera, obtain high-quality 2D images of the specimen. Obtain one photograph of the anterior surface of the specimen. Flip the specimen over exactly 180° and obtain a second photograph of the posterior surface of the specimen.\n3. 3D scanning following en bloc resection of solid tumor\nPlace a thin sheet of plastic on the 3D scanner turntable to protect the target points from human tissue. Place the specimen onto the plastic sheet with the anterior surface facing up.\nClick on the 3D scanner software application on the desktop of the laptop.\nClick on the 3D scanner icon on the right side of the screen. Click on the New Work button.\nCreate a new folder, using a naming convention that is easy to understand.\n\tNOTE: Naming convention recommendation: YYYY-MM-DD_SPECIMENTYPE\nClick on Texture Scan. Leave the open global markers file section blank.",
    "Adjust all fixed settings in the menu on the left side of the screen (Figure 3). Select HDR OFF. select the ON option for With Turntable. Set align mode = Turntable Coded Targets, turntable steps = 8, turntable speed = 10, and turntable turns = One Turn.\nAdjust the brightness by sliding the brightness slider bar to the right to maximize the exposure (redness) on the dark surfaces of the specimen as demonstrated in Figure 3.\n\tNOTE: Attempt to maximize the exposure (redness) on the dark-colored parts of the specimen (muscle, soft tissue) without overexposing (too red) the light-colored parts of the specimen (bone, teeth).\nClick on the triangle play button on the right-hand toolbar labeled Start Scan or press the spacebar to start the first round of scanning. Wait for the platform to complete all eight rotations (~4 min). Do not touch the scanner or turntable during this step.\nOnce complete, rotate the scan to see if there are any scan data captured outside the green dots displayed on the screen or any obvious artifact. Once satisfied, click on the checkmark on the right side of the edit screen to proceed to the next half of the scan.\n\t\nIf any artifact is discovered, press Shift and use the cursor to drag a circle around the artifact outside the intended scan. Look for a red circle that appears around the unwanted artifact. Click on the Delete data button on the right-hand toolbar designated by a garbage can icon.\nUsing gloves, flip over the specimen to expose the opposite surface. Adjust the brightness as necessary, and keep all other settings the same. Repeat steps 3.8-3.9.\n4. Alignment and meshing",
    "The program will attempt to automatically align the specimen. If the alignment is accurate (rare), proceed to step 4.4. If the alignment is poor (see note), continue to step 4.2.\n\tNOTE: Accurate alignment is characterized by a fully formed specimen without any gapping or overlap on the sides. The yellow portions represent the inside of the scan and optimal alignment shows the least amount of yellow as possible.\nFor manual alignment, press the align button indicated by a puzzle piece on the right-hand toolbar.\nPerform three-point cross-registration to geometrically align the two 3D scans.\n\t\nClick and drag one set of scan data (Group 1 and Group 2) into each of the alignment frames. Place Group 1 in the Fixed box and Group 2 in the Floated box.\nUse the right-click function to rotate and position the two halves so that one side shows the outside of the specimen (3D scanned surface) and the other half shows the inside of the specimen (yellow). Orient the two halves such that the silhouettes create the same shape if superimposed. Use the middle scroll button on the mouse to zoom in and out on the specimen.\nIdentify three clear landmarks on each set of scan data to pick as alignment points that are present on both sets of data.\n\t\tNOTE: Choose three points that are roughly equidistant from each other on the edges of the specimen. Use the unique topography of the scans to choose these points.",
    "Press shift and left-click to select the first of three corresponding alignment points on each group of data as described above. Following selection by clicking the two corresponding points, look for a red dot that appears in the chosen corresponding positions. Repeat this process 2x and look for green dots to appear for the second set of chosen alignment points and orange dots for the third set.\nLook for the alignment result to appear in the larger pane below the two halves. If the scan is aligned well (see NOTE in section 4.1 for optimal alignment recommendations), proceed to step 4.4. To repeat the alignment process, proceed to step 4.3.6.\nTo re-select the alignment points, simply press the Control key + Z key to undo previous work or click on the X box in the top right corner of each pane and return to step 4.3.1.\nPerform these steps until the alignment result preview is accurate.\nSelect the square Global Optimization button on the bottom right toolbar. Proceed through the optimization screens, clicking the Confirm button each time it is prompted.\nOnce optimization is complete, select the triangular Mesh Model button on the bottom right side of the screen.\nChoose the watertight model option when prompted. Click on the option for Medium Detail.\n\tNOTE: High detail takes much longer to render and is not visually better than medium detail.\nUse the slider bars that appear on the left hand side of the screen to adjust the brightness to 50 and the contrast to 0 when prompted.\nClick on the Save Your Scan button at the bottom right toolbar. Keep the scaling ratio at 100% to preserve all original dimensions of the specimen.",
    "Export the model into 3MF and OBJ file formats and save the file within the folder created at the beginning of the scan. Use the naming convention as outlined in step 2.3.\n5. Cleanup\nUsing gloves, remove the specimen from the turn table. Return the specimen safely to the pathology team.\nRemove the plastic sheet and sanitize it with a wipe. Return it to its bag.\nReturn the scanner turntable and camera to their respective slots in the box. Ensure the camera is protected with a plastic bag or a box.\nUnplug all cords and replace them in the box.\nClean the scanning area with a sanitizing wipe.\n6. Virtual 3D specimen mapping\nWhen the specimen is ready for processing, set up the workstation to work alongside the pathology team member who will be grossing the specimen.\n\tNOTE: It is helpful to utilize a rolling computer stand to allow for mobility and to facilitate communication with the pathology team.\nSet up the laptop computer and external mouse on the workstation. Open the computer-aided design software from the laptop desktop to virtually annotate the 3D model.\nClick on the Import button indicated by the plus sign icon and import the previously saved 3mf file of the raw scan from step 4.9.\n\tNOTE: This software does not have an erase function; it only allows the user to undo prior work by pressing Ctrl Z. Be wary that the user cannot go back and change or erase markings on the specimen once the map is saved.\nVirtual inking\n\t\nSelect the paintbrush tool on size setting 15-30 to outline the borders of each inked region. Use the color palette to graphically represent each inked surface using software paint colors concurrent with the true ink colors.",
    "Use the paintbrush tool on size setting 35-45 to fill in each inked section with its corresponding color.\nConfirm with the prosector that all inked sides are correct and take note of the anatomic orientation (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, deep) of each inked side for the key.\nMargin sampling\n\t\nUse the paintbrush tool on size setting 20-25 to diagram perpendicular and shave (en face) margins, distinguished using color coding.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, use white to denote perpendicular margins and fuschia to denote shave margins.\nLabel each sampled section with the number or letter that corresponds to the cassette each section is placed within.\nPlane cuts\n\t\nFor any plane cuts (i.e., breadloaf cuts completely through the specimen), select the Plane Cut tool from the left-side toolbar. Select Keep Both in the upper left hand toolbar.\nDraw the plane cuts through the specimen exactly as the prosector performed. Ensure that the cuts are correct and then click on accept.\n3D specimen map completion and export\n\t\nConfirm with the prosector to verify the accuracy of the completed 3D specimen map. Revise any discrepancies and finalize the map.\n\t\tNOTE: An example of a completed specimen map is shown in Figure 4.\nIn the upper toolbar, click File | Save to save the specimen map. Click File | Export | select .3mf to export the file as a .3mf file.\n7. Creating a distributable video\nOpen the presentation software from the laptop desktop.\nTitle the slide file with the corresponding name of the specimen that was mapped.\nInsert the 2D images taken of the specimen and arrange them on one side of the slide.\nSelect Insert from the top toolbar. Click on the rubber duck icon and select Insert 3D model.",
    "Import the .3mf file of the raw scan generated in step 4.9 and the .3mf file of the mapped specimen generated in step 6.7.2.\nArrange the 3D models with the raw scan and mapped scan side by side. Arrange the two models so they are in the same orientation/alignment and are the same size.\nClick on Animations on the upper toolbar | select model #1 | select Add animation | Turntable | change the duration to 10 s | select On click.\nSelect model #2 and repeat step 6.8 for the mapped scan, but at the last step, select With previous instead of On click.\nSelect model #1 and repeat step 6.8, but select Effect Options, change the turntable direction to Up, and select After previous.\nSelect model #2 and repeat step 7.9, but at the last step, select With previous.\nSelect the Animation Pane and click on Play all to check that the scans are rotating at the same time in the same direction.\nTo create a shareable video, click on File | Export | Create video | select medium size file to export a .mp4 video to be shared by email or integrated into a presentation.\n\tNOTE: An example of the final video is shown in Figure 5.\nSubscription Required.
