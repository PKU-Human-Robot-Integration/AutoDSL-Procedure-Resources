    "Schedule:Day 1. Start culturing PLAT-E cells from freeze stockDay 4. Replate PLAT-E cells for transfectionDay 5. Transfect PLAT-E cellsDay 6. Preparation of c-kit positive cells and irradiation of miceDay 7. Transduction of retrovirus to c-kit positive cells and injectionNotes: Prepare a donor mouse (five-week-old female C57BL/6J mouse) and five recipient mice (seven-week-old female C57BL/6J mice) per sample.One positive control (MLL-ENL) and one negative control (Empty vector; pMSCV-neo) are required in this experiment.Virus preparationOn day 1, thaw 4 x 106 PLAT-E cells from freeze stock and culture in 10-cm dishes with D10 media (see Recipes). The freezing media need to be removed for the initial culture. Note: Culture size depends on the sample size.On day 4, replate 4 x 106 PLAT-E cells in two 10-cm collagen-coated dishes with 10 ml of D10 media for a sample. In detail, remove the culture media, add 10 ml of PBS, remove PBS, add 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 5 min in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator. Add 9 ml of D10 media, transfer into a 15 ml tube, spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and then remove the supernatant. Add 10 ml of D10 media, count the cell number, and replate 4 x 106 PLAT-E cells in two 10-cm collagen-coated dishes with 10 ml of D10 media for a sample.On day 5, transfect PLAT-E cells with 16 µg of DNA and 40 µl of LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent. At the time of transfection, the cell confluency should be 60-70%. In detail, dilute 16 µg of DNA in 1 ml of Opti-MEMTM media and dilute 40 µl of LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent in 1 ml of Opti-MEMTM media, separately. After 5 min, combine the DNA solution with the LipofectamineTM 2000 solution.",
    "Mix gently and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Add the DNA-Lipofectamine mixture to each dish and incubate in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator. After 6 h, replace the media with fresh D10 media and incubate in a 32 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 2 days.Preparation of c-kit (CD117) positive progenitor cellsOn day 6, euthanize the five-week-old female C57BL/6J mice by cervical dislocation, spray 70 % ethanol to the whole body in open air, and dissociate the femurs and tibiae from the donor mice in a laminar flow cabinet (Figure1). Peripheral muscle should be removed by surgical scissors as thoroughly as possible.Note: The volume of solution described in the following procedures is for the cells from one donor mouse. If the temperature is not specifically noted, all the procedures should be conducted at room temperature. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171127/20171127231758_3207.jpgFigure 1. Illustrative image of mouse tibia and femurCut the end of the femurs and tibiae and flush the bone marrow with 10 ml of PBS (see Recipes) using a 10-ml syringe attached with a 21 G needle (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171127/20171127231841_9730.jpgFigure 2. Isolation of bone marrow cells from tibia and femurHomogenize the bone marrow cells gently by passing them through the 21 G needle several times.Spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min, and then remove as much of the supernatant as possible.Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of ACK lysis buffer (see Recipes) and incubate on ice for 1 min.Add 10 ml of R10W10 media (see Recipes) and spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min, and then remove the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 10 ml of SM buffer (see Recipes) and spin down at 400 x g for 5 min, and then remove the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 0.",
    "5 ml of SM buffer, add 20 µl of CD117 microbeads, and incubate for 20 min on ice or in the refrigerator.Add 10 ml of SM buffer and spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min, and then remove the supernatant to wash the cells.Wash the cells again as in step B9.Install an MS column on a MACS magnetic stand and equilibrate with 1 ml of SM buffer.Place a pre-separation filter on top of the column and load the cells onto MS column through the pre-separation filter.Wash the column with 1 ml of SM buffer twice.Remove the column from the magnetic stand and place it on a new 15-ml conical tube.Add 1 ml of SM buffer to the column to elute c-kit-positive cells by gravity flow (optionally using a plunger).Add 10 ml of R10W10 media and spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min, and then remove the supernatant.Resuspend all of the cells in 1 ml of R10W10 and transfer the cells into one well in a 48-well plate.Add cytokines (10 ng/ml SCF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-6 at the final concentration) and incubate the cells in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator overnight.Irradiation of miceOn day 7, irradiate recipient mice with a sub-lethal dose (6 Gy) in a gamma-cell. Several mice can be irradiated at the same time using an individually separatable cage.Add 1 ml of 2.5% Baytril solution to 200 ml of drinking water and treat for 1 week. The Baytril-containing water is not necessarily changed during the 1-week treatment.Virus transductionOn day 7, count the cells. A total of 1-2 x 106 c-kit-positive cells are expected from a donor mouse.",
    "Add an appropriate amount of R10W10 media to make a 6 x 105 cell/ml suspension and add 1/250 volume of 10 mg/ml polybrene solution.Aliquot 1 ml of cell suspensions into 15-ml conical tubes (two tubes for each sample).Suck 10 ml of the virus supernatant from the PLAT-E cell culture using a 10-ml syringe, attach a filter (0.45-µm) to the 10-ml syringe, and add the virus supernatant directly to the c-kit-positive cell suspension.Spin the cell suspension at 1,100 x g for 2.5 h at 32 °C (Spinoculation).After spinoculation, remove the virus supernatant and wash the cells twice each with 10 ml of PBS.Resuspend the cells to 2 x 105 cells/100 µl in PBS. Note: The number of cells injected affects the duration and incidence of leukemogenesis. Thus, we can manipulate the duration by decreasing/increasing the cell number to some extent.Place the cell suspensions on ice until injection.TransplantationInject 300 µl of anesthetic solution (see Recipes) intraperitoneally using a tuberculin syringe. Mice will be anesthetized completely within 5 min and stay asleep up to 1 h.After 5 min, inject 100 µl of the cell suspension into the retro-orbital sinus using a Myjector® insulin syringe. Pop up the eye, place the needle 1-2 mm deep between the eye and skin toward the brain to reach the vein, and gently inject the cell suspension (Figure 3) (Yardeni et al., 2011).Notes: Alternatively, the tail vein injection is applicable instead of retro-orbital injection.Place the mice into a cage for recovery and monitoring.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171127/20171127232136_1462.jpgFigure 3. Retro-orbital injection in miceTumor cell isolation and cultureWhen a mouse exhibits a morbid look, sacrifice the mouse, and dissociate the tumor cells from the femurs and tibiae as the same method of bone marrow preparation (steps B1-B6). Optionally, dissociate the spleen for pathological analysis.",
    "Notes: Morbid look indicates the condition of losing weight, bad coat of fur, and minimum reaction against stimulation e.g., sound and poking with a fingertip. It can be normally observed from day 60 to day 140 in the primary transplantation, and from day 20 to day 50 in the secondary transplantation.Prepare the bone marrow cell suspension with ACK buffer treatment described in steps B2-B6.Add 1 ml of R10W10 media and count the cell number.Add an appropriate amount of R10W10 media to make a 5 x 105 cells/ml suspension.Aliquot 200 µl of the cell suspension, add 1 ml of AC media (see Recipes) using a 1-ml syringe attached with an 18 G needle, and mix by vortexing. Optionally, the residual cells can be stocked. In detail, spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min, and then remove the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in freezing media (We typically use the Bambanker freezing solution, but R10W10 plus 10% DMSO can be alternatively used.) and directly store at -80 °C. For long-term storage, storage tube should be transferred to liquid nitrogen from -80 °C freezer.Add 20 µl of G418 solution to eliminate normal cells and incubate in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 5 days.Transfer the cells into a 12-well plate using a 1-ml syringe with an 18 G needle and incubate in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for several days. During the culture, prepare the recipient mice for secondary transplantation. If the media turns orange during culture because of excess cells, add an additional 1 ml of AC media with G418. Note: It is important to maintain good culture conditions. Overgrowth drastically affects the incidence of leukemia in the second transplantation.",
    "Secondary transplantationCollect cells with 10 ml of PBS, transfer to 15-ml conical tubes, and spin at 400 x g for 5 min.Remove the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 10 ml of PBS, and remove the debris to pass through a Pre-separation filter.Count the cell number and resuspend the cells to 2 x 105 cells/100 µl in PBS. Note: The number of cells injected affects the duration and incidence of leukemogenesis. Thus, we can manipulate the duration by decreasing/increasing the cell number to some extent.Place the cell suspension on ice.Inject 300 µl of anesthetic solution intraperitoneally using a tuberculin syringe.Inject 100 µl of the cell suspension into the retro-orbital sinus using a Myjector® insulin syringe.Place the mice into a cage for recovery and monitoring. Note: The duration of survival in secondary transplantation shortens compared to that in initial transplantation (Figure 4). It could be because leukemia cells need to acquire genetic/epigenetic alterations during the first disease onset. Or, the cancer stem/initiating population may be more enriched at the time of second transplantation compared to the initial transplantation. It is unclear at this point why the duration has been shortened dramatically in the second transplantation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171127/20171127232400_0590.jpgFigure 4.
