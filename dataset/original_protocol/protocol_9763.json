    "Animal studies were approved by The University of Rochester Committee of Animal Resources. The mice used in this study were C57BL/6 males and females ranging from age 24-29 weeks of age. Mice were housed in standard conditions with food and water ad libitum. Upon euthanasia via carbon dioxide inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation, 20 right femurs (10 male and 10 female) were harvested and frozen at -20 °C until tested.\n1. Creation of custom 3D printed mounting guides\nNOTE: This step might be needed because different strains and genetic phenotypes might have different anatomical geometries.\nObtain µCT scans of the representative samples.\n\t\nScan representative samples on a µCT scanner with the following settings: 55 kV, 145 µA for 300 ms integration times, and resolution of 10.5 µm voxels.\nEnsure that the captured region covers the proximal end of the femur and continues down through the midshaft.\n\t\tNOTE: If a µCT scanner is unavailable, 2D planar X-rays of the representative samples can be used.\nAnalyze the µCT scans.\n\t\nUsing the representative set of µCT scans, obtain a 2D rendering of the anterior view of the proximal femur.\n\t\t\nObtain µCT images with a resolution of 10.5 µm voxels from the midshaft to the proximal end of the femur. Compile these slices using software (see Table of Materials) into a 3D rendering of the sample.\nDetermine a threshold to distinguish bone from the surrounding tissue and apply a Gaussian filter for noise reduction.\nOrient the 3D renderings to eliminate off-axis tilt and ensure that the femur's anterior surface is viewed.\nExport this 2D view of the 3D rendering as an image file, such as .jpg or .png.",
    "Using an image analysis software (see Table of Materials), measure the femoral shaft angle by drawing a line perpendicular to the femoral shaft 7 mm distally and a second line through the peak of the greater trochanter to the midpoint of the aforementioned perpendicular line (Figure 1).\nAlong the 7 mm distal perpendicular line, measure the femoral shaft diameter below the third trochanter.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63394/63394fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: µCT analysis. µCT images of femurs of C57Bl/6 mice are used to calculate the average shaft angle, measured from the top of the greater trochanter through the center of the midshaft, ~7 mm distally. The midshaft diameter was also measured at this position. The 3D renderings of the proximal femur were oriented in an anterior view to display the profile of the third trochanter. The average shaft angle was 93.13° (SD = 1.19°), and the average midshaft diameter was 1.53 mm (SD = 0.14 mm) (n = 20). Scale bar = 1 mm.

The angle of the slot will create a consistent angle of 20° from vertical. The guides should be consistent in length, height and width, but can be made with various slot diameters to accommodate anatomical differences among the bone samples.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63394/63394fig02.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Designing the guides. (A) 3D sketch and (B) visualization of midshaft angling fixture before 3D printing. Based on previous literature, a midshaft angle between 20° maximizes the stiffness. It minimizes the maximal bending moment in the femoral shaft to ensure fractures occur in the neck and variability in mechanical outcomes5. To compensate for the 3.13° deviation from perpendicular in the midshaft average angles, the fixture angle was set to 73.13° to produce an angle of 20°. Alignment fixtures were printed with diameters ranging from 1.9-2.2 mm to ensure a proper fit for varying midshaft diameters.

The guides can remain on during the testing process, so printing multiple replicates of the guides can be beneficial for preparing multiple samples at once.\n2. Sample preparation\nHarvest the mouse femurs by making a transverse incision entirely around the mouse abdomen and removing the tissue from the incision to the ankles. Following this, locate the hip socket and carefully use the tip of a pair of fine forceps to dislocate the hip. Cut the additional soft tissue to remove the leg from the mouse.\nOnce the leg is harvested, use a scalpel to dislocate and cut through the knee joint. Manually clean the femurs of all soft tissue using forceps, scalpels, and paper towels.\nTest the harvested samples immediately or store them at -20 °C for up to 6 months. If samples are frozen, allow them to come to room temperature and hydrate in PBS for 2 h before prepping.\nUsing ¼\" x ¼\" square aluminum tubing (see Table of Materials), cut tubing sections ½\" to 1\" in length. Using an etching tool, label each aluminum segment with the sample IDs.",
    "Fill half of the tubing segments with putty. Place these tubing segments into a fixture to hold them upright.\nPlace the cleaned femurs into the 3D printed guides. To do this, place the samples flat on the benchtop so the anterior surface is facing up. Place the guide directly below the third trochanter, where the shaft diameter becomes more consistent.\n\tNOTE: This will leave ~7mm of the proximal femur above the guide.\nTo prevent the femur from rotating to the lateral or medial side while placing on the guide, hold the proximal and distal ends with one hand when applying the guides, firmly press the femur onto the workbench and using your other hand, place the 3D printed guide on the midshaft of the femur. Ensure to apply the appropriate diameter guide gently, as the midshaft of the femur can snap if forced into a guide too small.\nOnce the guides are on the femurs, place them in front of the corresponding aluminum segments. Using bone cement or other hardening agents, fill the aluminum segments until just full, leaving a little room for displacement.\nPlace the femurs with guides on in the correct aluminum segment.\n\tNOTE: The guides will not be centered on the aluminum segments, seated slightly to one side to allow the distal end of the femur to sit in the center of the aluminum pot.\nAllow the hardening agent to set. Once set, place the samples in a Petri dish with room temperature phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and allow to rehydrate for 2 h (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63394/63394fig03.jpg",

Hardware set-up\nUsing a mechanical testing system (MTS), attach and calibrate a load cell with resolution <1 N (see Table of Materials) (Figure 4A).\n\tNOTE: The load cell can be mounted on the stage or, preferably, the actuator when possible.\nAttach a fixture with a square slot that will firmly hold the aluminum segments with the samples. Attach set screws to the two sides of the holding fixture to firmly hold samples in place. (Figure 4B).\n\tNOTE: This fixture can be 3D printed or machined and then tapped with threaded screw holes to mount to the testing frame.\nAttach a loading platen to the actuator. This can be simply a tapered screw with a flattened tip (Figure 4C).\nPlace a stereomicroscope on a table or surface directly in front of the MTS. If additional lighting is needed to see the set-up through the microscope, place these around the system.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63394/63394fig04.jpg",

Software set-up\nIn the MTS software, begin the creation of a new flexural (bending) protocol. Ensure that the protocol will operate in displacement control.\nSet the loading rate of the protocol to 0.5 mm/s.\nIf the software has a setting for soft keys, add the soft keys \"Balance\" and \"Zero Extension\" to the protocol.\n\tNOTE: This will quickly set the load and actuator position to 0 before testing each sample.\nEnsure that the software program will record the time in seconds, load in Newtons, and extension or displacement in millimeters at a minimum sampling rate of 100 Hz.\nSave the new protocol and return to the main screen of the software program to begin testing a new sample set.\n5. Testing set-up\nBefore mounting the specimens on the MTS, obtain an X-ray image of the samples in the aluminum pots. Multiple samples can be imaged at once. Ensure that the anterior view of samples is captured to allow for verification measurements of potting angle (Figure 5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63394/63394fig05.jpg",
    "Figure 5. Assessment of sample alignment. (A) The shaft angle from vertical is measured from planar digital x-rays. (B) Representative potted femoral shaft angles ranged from 18.11° to 23.99°, with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 7.1% (n = 20). Sex differences due to anatomical variations were not statistically significant, as determined using a one-tailed unpaired t-test (p < 0.05). Scale bar (Panel A) = 1 mm. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63394/63394fig05large.jpg]\nPlace the aluminum segment with sample into the holding fixture and tighten set screws.\nLower actuator/loading platen until it is within a few millimeters of the femoral head.\n\tNOTE: Do not preload the sample with any force and be careful not to lower the actuator too quickly, as it is very easy to damage samples.\nUsing the stereomicroscope, adjust the biaxial stage to align the position of the femoral head directly underneath the loading platen. Lock biaxial stage in place.\nIn the MTS software, zero the position of the actuator and balance the load cell using the soft keys added in step 4.3.\nBegin the loading protocol. Depending on how much space was left between the loading platen and sample, testing will only take 10-30 s.\nAfter testing, capture another anterior X-ray of the sample. This will be used to discern and document the mode of fracture (Figure 6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63394/63394fig06.jpg\nFigure 6: X-ray image of samples after testing.

Data analysis\nAfter data collection, export force and displacement data into software (see Table of Materials) that allows for graphing and mathematical calculations.",
    "Plot the load vs. displacement for each sample (Figure 7A). Fit a linear approximation to the linear segment of the load-displacement curve. The slope of this linear fit will define the stiffness, a measure of the elasticity of the sample.\nCalculate the additional outcomes such as maximum load, maximum displacement, yield load, displacement at yield point, energy to maximum load, and energy to yield point.\n\tNOTE: The yield point can be determined by off-setting the linear approximation determined in step 6.2 by 0.2%6. The point at which the off-set line and the load vs. displacement curve intersect will determine the yield point. In the case of very brittle samples that show little yield, the yield point may be the same as the maximum point.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
