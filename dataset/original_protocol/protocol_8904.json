    "1. Amygdala\nAnterior Slices of the AMY\n\t\nIdentify the first slice of the AMY in which the limen insula initially appears, where the white matter connection between the frontal and temporal lobes is continuous and visible30. In the coronal view, use the angular bundle as the inferolateral border of the AMY.\nLocate the optic chiasm as a landmark for the appearance of the AMY. Use the axial and sagittal views to distinguish the AMY in its early slices from the surrounding uncus. Follow the white matter tract around the AMY in the axial view to exclude the entorhinal area32.\nMoving posteriorly, identify the first slice in which the anterior commissure is continuous throughout both hemispheres20, where the AMY is visible in its typical shape. Trace the AMY counter-clockwise using the entorhinal sulcus as the superomedial border, the imaginary line from the fundus of the semianular sulcus along the white matter to the inferior tip of the AMY as the inferomedial border, the temporal stem as the lateral border, and back to the entorhinal sulcus to complete the tracing31.\nPosterior Slices of the AMY\n\t\nNote that at this level, both the AMY and HC are visible in the same slice(s).\nStill in the coronal view, identify the last slice of the AMY where the structure is superior to the medial extension of the temporal horn of lateral ventricle38 (or the alveus if the ventricle is not present) and lateral to the uncinate gyrus, the protuberance of the head of the HC. Check the sagittal and axial views for accurate and consistent tracing.",
    "Draw an imaginary line from the fundus of the inferior circular sulcus of the insula to the optic tract as the superior border of the AMY31, which also differentiates it from the grey matter of the globus pallidus and the putamen.\nTrace along the semilunar gyrus as the superomedial border and exclude the uncinate gyrus32. Use the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle and the temporal stem for the lateral delineation.\nConsecutive Slices of the AMY in Anterior-posterior Direction\n\t\nSystematically trace the AMY slice-by-slice using the relevant guidelines above. At the anterior portion of the AMY, use the same boundaries as for the anterior-most slice; conversely, at the posterior portion of the AMY, use the same boundaries as for the posterior-most slice.\nContinue to employ the axial and sagittal views to help define and further refine the AMY borders.\n2. Hippocampus\nLocalizing the HC\n\t\nBegin tracing the HC when the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle appears along the inferolateral border of the AMY. If the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle is already present on previous slices, note that the onset of the HC is then indicated by the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle enlarging and stretching superolaterally.\nEnd the tracing of the HC with its last appearance inferomedial to the trigone of the lateral ventricle31. Always utilize the alternative views to help localize the HC and its borders.\nBorder Definitions of the HC\n\t\nDelineate the lateral HC against the temporal horn. In cases where the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle is not perceivable enough, exclude one row of voxels from the segmentation to denote it.",
    "Inferiorly, use the angular bundle (or its imaginary extension) to the ventricular cavity to separate the HC from the PHG. Use the alveus along with the fimbria as the superior border. Trace the HC using the same definitions throughout.\nAdditionally, include the subiculum into the segmentation such that it medially borders the white matter bundle of the PHG, superiorly aligns with the curve of the uncus, and extends primarily horizontally from the HC39. Tracing posteriorly, maintain these definitions until the calcarine sulcus intervenes.\nNoting Divisions of the HC\n\t\nNote that the HC can be divided into three segments: head, body, and tail.\nUse the appearance of the uncal apex to mark the transition from the HC head to the HC body, and the rapid ascending and expansion in size, which typically coincides with the appearance of the crus of the fornix, to signify the appearance of the HC tail23,30,40.\nPay special attention when tracing the following structures.\n\t\nInclude the posterior uncus in the segmentation.\nOmit the choroid plexus above the alveus from the segmentation on the coronal slices, although this may not be possible on lower-resolution images.\nRefer to the two alternative views to avoid the inclusion of the tail of the caudate and the pulvinar at the superior aspect of the HC tail.\nAvoid inclusion of the fascicular gyrus by noting its emergence at the level of the crus of the fornix, where initially it is separated from the hippocampal tail by the fasciola cinerea and more posteriorly becomes the grey matter superior to the calcarine sulcus32.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50991/50991fig2highres.jpg",
    "Figure 2. A representative sagittal slice of the MTL traced using the present protocol, showing its actual position in the brain, and the relative positions among its major structures, i.e., the AMY (red), the HC (blue), the PRC (yellow), the ERC (pink), and the PHC (green).\n3. Parahippocampal Gyrus\nNoting Divisions of the PHG\n\t\nNote that the PHG can be divided into two main segments: the anterior PHG (i.e., the PRC and ERC), and the posterior PHG (i.e., the PHC).\nNote that in the anterior segment, the PRC appears earlier than the ERC, and flanks it laterally through its entire course.\nAfter the ERC disappears, note that the PRC subsumes its place on the PHG and continues on for 3 mm.\nBeyond this segment, trace the posterior PHG, where the PHC takes over the width of the PHG until its end30.\nAnterior Slices of the PHG\n\t\nDefine the first slice of the PRC with the appearance of the CS25,34. Before the onset of the ERC, trace the PRC from the medial edge of the lateral bank of the CS to the lateral fundus of the gyrus of Schwalbe, or that of the medial one if two gyri of Schwalbe are present, or the midpoint of the dorsal temporopolar surface in the absence of this gyrus25,34.\nStart to trace the ERC 5 mm anterior to the limen insula35,36.\nContinue tracing the ERC using the fundus of the medial temporopolar sulcus as the superior end35, and the fundus of the semiannular sulcus after the AMY appears, or the point where the imaginary extension of the angular bundle meets the ventricular cavity if the semiannular sulcus is indistinguishable25. Note that it extends inferiorly to meet the ventricular cavity or the pial surface directly.",
    "The border between the PRC and the ERC may vary from slice to slice. \n\t\t\nWhen the CS is deep (≥ 1.5 cm), trace the PRC from the medial edge of the medial bank of this sulcus, to the midpoint of its lateral bank25 .\nIn cases with a regular CS (depth of 1–1.5 cm), trace the PRC as the area from the midpoint of the medial bank of the collateral sulcus to the medial end of the lateral bank of the sulcus25.\nWith a shallow CS (< 1 cm), trace the PRC from the fundus of this sulcus to the midpoint of the crown of the fusiform gyrus25 .\nWhen the CS is interrupted, usually at the level of the uncal apex, by a small gyrus emerging from its fundus, trace the PRC to the fundus of the lateral sulcus25. Include or exclude white matter according to the goal for the ROI.\nTrace the ERC until 1.5 mm posterior to the uncal apex, or the end of the gyrus intralimbicus37 .\nExtend the tracing of the PRC medially to occupy the place of the ERC after its termination, where the definitions for the latter continue to apply until 4.5 mm posterior to the uncal apex, or the end of the gyrus intralimbicus37. The PRC is then substituted by the PHC25,30.\nPosterior Slices of the PHG\n\t\nStart to trace the PHC on the slice posterior to the end of the PRC, until 4 mm posterior to the end of the HC tail32. Alternative definitions from the literature are described in the Discussion section. Again, include or exclude white matter depending on the goal.",
    "Delineate the PHC using the same method described in the posterior portion of the PRC after the disappearance of the ERC. Also use the white matter of the cingulum as the superior border once it appears. Continue tracing in this fashion until the appearance of the calcarine sulcus, which restricts the PHC superomedially to the inferior edge of the sulcus30.\nShould a mini-sulcus appear before the emergence of the calcarine sulcus, include it in the segmentation, but be cautious in differentiating it from the calcarine sulcus.\nSubscription Required.
