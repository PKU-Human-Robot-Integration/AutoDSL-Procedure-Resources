    "Preparation of GNPs via Turkevich method Use HAuCl4in combination with sodium citrate as a reducing and capping agent for the nanoparticles.Prepare HAuCl4 solution (0.25 mM; see Recipes) in a conical flask.Put 100 mL of HAuCl4 solution (0.25 mM) into a 500 mL round-bottom flask with single neck and stir at 130 °C in an oil bath in a magnetic stirrer.When HAuCl4 solution starts to boil, add 0.7 mL of sodium citrate solution (5%; see Recipes) into HauCl4 solution.When the solution turns wine red, add 0.7 mL of sodium citrate solution (5%) again and repeat the addition process of sodium citrate solution twice.Cool the reaction solution down to room temperature and transfer the entire reaction mixture to multiple 2 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 30 min to collected precipitated GNPs.Add 100 mL of ddH2O to disperse the precipitated GNPs and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 30 min again. Repeat the washing twice with deionized water and collect purified GNPs.Characterize GNPs by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). TEM imaging shows the morphology of Au nanoparticles and DLS analysis reflects the size distribution.Place the precipitated GNPs in a 2 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tube and dry GNPs in the vacuum oven at 25 °C for two days (Figure 1a).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230614/20230614013143_3815.jpgFigure 1.

    "97 g of GNP power in 1,000 mL of ddH2O to prepare GNPs solution (10 mM; see Recipes).Add 2 mL of mono(6-mercapto-6-deoxy)-beta-cyclodextrin solution (2 mM) to 2 mL of GNPs solution (10 mM) in a beaker and stir in a magnetic stirrer for 2 h at room temperature.Centrifuge the resultant solution at 21,000× g for 8 min in a 2 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tube and collect the precipitated CD-GNPs.Dry CD-GNPs in a vacuum oven at 25 °C for two days (Figure 1b).Preparation of ADA-GNPs Dissolve 1-adamantanethiol in DMSO (2 mM, 2 mL; see Recipes).Add GNP solution (10 mM, 2 mL) into 1-adamantanethiol solution in a beaker and stir for 2 h.Centrifuge the resultant solution at 21,000× g for 8 min in a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube and collect the precipitated ADA-GNPs.Dry ADA-GNPs in a vacuum oven at 25 °C for two days (Figure 1c).Isolation of bacterial OMVs Inoculate E. coli in a polypropylene bacterial culture tube containing 50 mL of LB medium (see Recipes) for three days, and then centrifuge resulting bacterial culture in a 50 mL Falcon tube at 2,000× g for 5 min. Disperse the precipitated bacteria in ddH2O to achieve a OD600 value of 1.0, measured in a microplate reader at wavelength of 600 nm.Filter 50 mL of the supernatant through a 0.45 pore size nylon membrane filter.Transfer the resulting filtrate into Millipore 10 kDa filter and centrifuge at 5,000× g for 5 min to obtain the OMVs-rich solution in a Falcon tube.Centrifuge the OMVs-rich solution in a high-speed polypropylene copolymer (PPCO) centrifuge tube at ultra-high speed of 150,000× g for 3 h.Collect the precipitated OMVs in a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube and store at -80 °C (Figure 1d).Synthesis of OMV-coated CD-GNPs Lyophilize OMVs to get OMV power.",
    "Mix 1 mg of OMVs and 1 mg of CD-GNPs in 50 mL of ddH2O in Falcon tubes. Divide 50 mL of the resulting solution into two 50 mL Falcon tubes.Sonicate the Falcon tubes for 10 s at intervals of 10 s in a sonication bath at a frequency of 40 kHz (100 W) for 2 min at room temperature.Centrifuge the subsequent solution in the Falcon tube at 5,000× g for 30 min to precipitate OMV-coated CD-GNPs (Figure 1e).Place the solution of OMV-coated CD-GNPs in copper mesh and dry for TEM imaging, to analyze the coating layer on GNP surface.Place the solution of OMV-coated CD-GNPs in a quartz cuvette for DLS analysis, to measure the diameter change of GNP before and after OMV coating.Synthesis of OMV-coated ADA-GNPs Mix 1 mg of OMVs and 1 mg of ADA-GNPs in 50 mL of ddH2O solution. Divide 50 mL of the resulting solution into two 50 mL Falcon tubes.Sonicate Falcon tubes for 10 s at intervals of 10 s in a sonication bath at a frequency of 40 kHz (100 W) for 2 min at room temperature.Centrifuge the subsequent solution in the Falcon tube for 30 min at 5,000× g to precipitate OMV-coated ADA-GNPs (Figure 1f).Place the solution of OMV-coated ADA-GNPs in copper mesh and dry for TEM imaging, to analyze the coating layer on GNP surface.Place the solution of OMV-coated ADA-GNPs in quartz cuvette for DLS analysis, to measure the diameter change of GNP before and after OMV coating."
