    "NOTE: All animal experiments were approved by the ethical committee of KU Leuven (project number 090/2013). Maintain animals in accordance with the KU Leuven animal care guidelines.\n1. C. albicans Growth\nTwenty-four hours before the initiation of the animal experiment, prepare YPD plates by adding 10 g of yeast extract granulated, 20 g of bacteriological peptone, and 15 g of granulated agar. Make up volume to 900 ml with Milli-Q water and autoclave.\nAdd 50 ml of sterile 40% glucose. Mix thoroughly and pour into Petri dishes. Leave agar plates to cool and solidify.\n\tNOTE: In this study, use two strains, namely wild type C. albicans SC5314 –gLuc negative strain (referred to as WT)and C. albicans SKCA23 strain, which is a wild type C. albicans SC5314 transformed with Clp10::Act1p-gLUC59 plasmid 22.In this strain (named SKCA23-ACTgLuc) gLuc was fused to the endogenous PGA59 gene under the control of ACT1 (actin) promoter (this promoter is active in the yeast, as well as hyphal stage of fungal growth). This strain can be requested from the laboratory of Prof. Patrick Van Dijck, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. Plasmid Clp10::Act1p-gLUC59 plasmid 22 was kindly donated by Prof. C. d’Enfert, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France.\nMaintain both strains in glycerol stock and store at -80 °C.\nPrior to any experiment streak strains onto an YPD plate. Incubate plate at 37 °C overnight.\n2. Catheter Pieces Preparation\nBefore the experiment, determine how many catheters are needed. It is possible to implant up to 6 catheter pieces per mouse (3 catheters on the left and 3 catheter on the right side of the animal (Figure 2A).",
    "Twenty-four hr prior to the animal surgery, open the package containing triple-lumen catheter under the biological safety cabinet. Remove all unnecessary parts with sterile tweezers and cut the part attached to the catheter with a sterile scalpel. Place ruler under the plastic package and cut polyurethane catheter pieces of exactly 1 cm according to the scale on the ruler (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: It is important to mention that this type of catheter piece is not phosphorescent and therefore suitable for BLI 18,19.\nPlace a maximum of 15 cut catheter pieces (step. 2.2) into 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Always prepare 3 pieces extra, which are used to enumerate the amount of attached Candida cells on the device after the period of adhesion.\nSupplement catheters with approximately 1.8 ml of 100% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nVigorously vortex and add additional 100-200 μl of 100% FBS. Completely cover all catheter pieces with serum.\nIncubate at 37 °C overnight.\n3. Animals and Suppression of the Immune System\nKeep female BALB/c mice (approximately 8 weeks of age) in individually ventilated filter top cages with free access to standard food and water ad libitum.\nInitiate suppression of the immune system 24 hr before animal surgery by adding dexamethasone (0.4 mg/L) to the drinking water of animals. In order to avoid any bacterial contamination of the host, supplement the drinking water with antibiotic, e.g., ampicillin sodium powder (0.5 g/L).\nKeep immunosuppression of animals during the entire experiment (up to 6 days).\n4. Ex vivo C. albicans Adhesion on FBS-coated Polyurethane Substrates\nTransfer each serum-coated catheter piece into a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nScrape off some C. albicans cells grown on YPD plates (Step 1) and suspend them in 1 ml of PBS.",
    "Dilute Candida cells (1:100) in a separate microcentrifuge tube. Take 10 μl of the diluted sample and apply it on a cell counting chamber. Count at least 16 small squares.\nPrepare Candida cells (each strain separately) in RPMI 1640 medium to a final concentration of 5 x 104 cells/ml.\nAdd 1 ml of cell suspension to each serum-coated catheter piece.\nVigorously vortex and ensure that the catheters are submerged in the medium and not floating on top.\nIncubate catheters at 37 °C for 90 min (period of adhesion).\nRemove catheters with sterile tweezers and wash them twice with 1 ml of PBS. During this step make sure that the washing fluid goes through the lumen by keeping the catheter in vertical position while very gently flushing the catheters. Importantly, do not use a strong flow which may lead to the removal of attached cells.\nTransfer each washed catheter to a clean microcentrifuge tube (one piece per tube).\nPlace on ice and keep there until surgery.\n5. Anesthesia\nPrepare anesthesia by mixing 75 µl of ketamine (100 mg/ml) with 100 µl of medetomidine (1 mg/ml) and 825 µl of sterile saline. Administer intraperitoneally (i.p.) 60-80 µl of anesthetic cocktail per 10 g body weight, resulting in a dose of 45-60 mg/kg ketamine and 0.6-0.8 mg/kg medetomidine.\nFor reversal of anesthesia, dilute 50 µl atipamezole (5 mg/ml) in 4.95 ml saline, administer i.p. 100 µl per 10 g body weight as antidote, resulting in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg.\nAfter injection of anesthesia, place the animal into a separate cage and wait until it is fully asleep.",
    "Confirm proper anesthetization of the animal by light skin pinch and toe pinch, which do not cause any damage to the skin. Any observed movement indicates that the animal is not sufficiently anesthetized to perform surgery. If this happens, wait a couple of minutes longer until the animal does not show any signs of movement upon skin or toe pinch.\n6. Animal Surgery\nTransfer anesthetized animal from the cage on a clean tissue placed on the heating pad, pre-warmed to 37 °C (Figure 2A, (1)).\n\tNOTE: A cheaper alternative is to use electrically heated blankets. It is also possible to use isothermic pads, which must be warmed up in the microwave prior to the animal surgery.\nApply ophthalmic ointment on the eyes.\nShave the lower back of the animal with an electric razor. Remove all animal hairs and transfer animal on a clean tissue. Disinfect the skin (e.g., with 1% iodine isopropanol or 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol) and leave the disinfected area to dry for approximately 1 min (Figure 2A, (2)).\nMake a small incision in the skin (one on the left and one on the right side of the animal) (approximately 0.5–1 cm) (Figure 2A, (3)).\nDissect the subcutis with a scissor to create two subcutaneous tunnels. Each tunnel should be approximately 1.5 cm long and 1 cm wide.\nInsert three catheter pieces, previously infected with Candida, in each tunnel. Ensure that the catheters lie next to each other in a horizontal arrangement and that they do not cover each other to enable the implantation of six catheter fragments in total (Figure 2A, (4)).\nClose the incisions with sutures. Alternatively, use Dermabond to close the wound.\nDisinfect the wound very gently with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol or with iodine isopropanol (1%).",
    "Apply local anesthetic (xylocaine gel, 2%) directly on the wound.\nAdminister reversal of anesthesia (protocol 5, step 2): intraperitoneally 100 µl per 10 g body weight.\nTransfer animal to a clean cage previously placed on a heating plate. Keep the animal separate and warm until the animal is completely awake. Meanwhile, continue with the operation and implant of the next animal. Once all operated animals are fully awake. Transfer to one cage. Monitor animals regularly.\n7. Bioluminescence Imaging: Preparation of Coelenterazine (CTZ), the Substrate for G. princeps luciferase\nPrepare fresh coelenterazine (CTZ) stock solution by dissolving 5 mg/ml CTZ in acidified ethanol or according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nPrepare 1.2 mM working solution by diluting the stock solution 1:10 in sterile PBS.\n\tNOTE: Inject 100 µl CTZ working solutions subcutaneously in the area surrounding the catheters. Use insulin syringes for subcutaneous injection of CTZ.\nAlways keep CTZ in the dark (e.g., cover microcentrifuge tubes containing CTZ with aluminum foil). Store the stock solution at -80 °C for the duration of the experiments.\n8. Bioluminescence Imaging\nInitialize the BLI camera.\nAnesthetize the animals using an induction box. Use a gas mixture of isoflurane in oxygen, N2O/ O2, or air at 2-3%.\nAfter induction, maintain anesthesia in the induction box and in the imaging chamber at 1.5-2%.\nBefore starting the imaging session, place the imaging plate in position A, which corresponds to a FOV of 10 cm. Ensure that the right position of the anesthesia outlets and animal by placing a sleeping animal in the box.\nTake few photographs until animal is in the desired imaging position, in the FOV right under the camera.\nPrepare two insulin syringes each containing 100 µl of the CTZ working solution.",
    "Place one animal on the bench and keep it asleep by means of a nose cone providing gas anesthesia.\nBring the needles of the syringes in a place surrounding catheters subcutaneously and inject the CTZ simultaneously on top of the catheters.\nImmediately after injection, place the animal on the warm plate in the camera box and start the bioluminescence image acquisition.\nAcquire consecutive scans with acquisition times ranging from 20 to 60 sec (depending on the signal intensity) until the maximum signal intensity is reached. During the acquisition of the next frame, measure the BLI signal intensity of the previously acquired frames by placing a ROI over each catheters trio and measuring the photon flux through this ROI.\nRepeat from step 7 for the next animal(s).\nAfter imaging, return animals to their cage. Repeat BLI during the course of an experiment for longitudinal, non-invasive follow-up of biofilm formation.\nAnalyze the BLI data using Living Image software. Place a rectangular ROI of fixed size over each catheter trio and measure the photon flux (radiance) through each ROI. Repeat this for every animal.\nReport the BLI signal intensity of each catheter trio as photon flux per second. Represent the BLI data on a logarithmic scale by plotting the mean and SD of the photon flux per second for each group. Perform statistical analysis on the log10 transformed data.\n9. Catheter Explant\nPrepare microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 ml of PBS, one for each catheter device and keep them on ice.\nEuthanize the animals by cervical dislocation (Figure 2B, (1)).\nDisinfect the skin of the back with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol or with iodine isopropanol (1%).\nMake an incision (approximately 3 cm) above the catheters.",
    "Cut subcutaneous tissue and remove the catheter fragments one by one from under the subcutaneous tissue using sterile tweezers (Figure 2B, (2)).\nHandle catheter gently in vertical position and wash it twice with 1 ml of sterile PBS. Place each catheter piece into a separate microcentrifuge tube (prepared in Step 1).\n10. Quantification of Biofilm-associated Cells by Colony Forming Units Count (CFUs) and Statistical Analyses of Results\nSonicate catheters previously placed into 1 ml of PBS for 10 min at 40,000 Hz in a water bath sonicator and place them on ice.\nAfter sonication, vigorously vortex for 30 sec and place again on ice.\nPrepare two additional microcentrifuge tubes containing 900 μl of PBS.\nMake 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions from your original sample (the one which contains the catheter) and keep all microcentrifuge tubes on ice.\nPlate 100 µl of the original samples, 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions on YPD agar plates in duplicate.\nIncubate plates for 2 days at 37 °C and count CFUs.\nCount the colonies grown on YPD agar plates (countable amount of colonies, maximum 300 colonies/plate) and multiply them by the proper dilution factor (1x-original, 10x or 100x dilution). Further multiply each catheter piece by 10x, which corresponds to the final amount of colonies in 1 ml tube containing the catheter. Bring the final amount of colonies to log10 cells/catheter piece with standard deviation (SD). Express data as a mean ± SD.\nPlace all values for each catheter and specific group into a spreadsheet and/or statistical program, to perform the above-mentioned calculations and statistical analyses. Indicate specific groups to compare, i.e. WT vs. mutant or 2 days vs. 6 days biofilm formation and perform unpaired t-test and ANOVA with Tukey post-test on the log10-transformed data.",
    "Express the level of significance by a p value. In this study indicate significance if p value <0.05, represented as follows: * p <0.05, **p <0.005, ***p <0.0005.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
