    "All procedures described in this protocol have been approved by the University of Kentucky’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 2015-2225). Patient samples were collected under University of Kentucky’s Institutional Review Board (protocol 44672). All animal experiments performed following this protocol must be approved by the user’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Thawing Primary Patient Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells\nThaw primary patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from frozen stock in a 37 °C water bath. Immediately after cells have thawed, transfer cells in their freezing media (90% FBS + 10% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) to a 15 mL conical tube with slow pipetting, avoiding air bubbles. Add 10 mL of prewarmed 37 °C thawing media (25% fetal bovine serum [FBS] in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium [IMDM]) dropwise (approximately 2−3 s per mL) to the cells in the 15 mL conical tube.\n\tNOTE: PBMCs were collected from patient blood samples at the time of diagnosis. The buffy coat was separated by density centrifugation and cells were washed 2x in RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS. Cells were counted and 107 cells were frozen per cryovial in 1 mL of freezing media, and stored at -80 °C.\nCentrifuge cells at 100 x g for 10 min and aspirate media from the cell pellet. Repeat the addition of thaw media, centrifugation, and aspiration one additional time to remove any residual DMSO.\nResuspend cells in 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and remove 10 μL for counting on an automated cell counter or hemocytometer. Add 10 μL of trypan blue to 10 μL of cells removed for counting. Count number of cells per mL and record to later calculate the volume to resuspend cells in for xenografting (see step 2.5).",
    "NOTE: Typically, 500 cells are xenografted per larval zebrafish. For example, 5 x 105 cells are needed to inject 1,000 zebrafish. Viability should be >85% to use for xenografting. In this experiment, cell viability was 96% after thawing, assessed by trypan blue staining.\n2. Fluorescently Labeling Cells with DiI\nCentrifuge the desired cell number in 5 mL of PBS at 200 x g for 5 min and aspirate supernatant. Stain a minimum of 2 x 106 cells in case of clumping or problems loading the needle during injection.\nMake 1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) staining solution (5 mL of PBS containing 4 µL per mL of DiI stain, Table of Materials) and resuspend the cell pellet in the staining solution.\nNOTE: Cell density should not exceed 2 x 106 cells/mL when resuspended in the staining solution.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C protected from light for 20 min, vortex gently, then incubate cells on ice for 15 min protected from light.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 x g for 5 min and aspirate supernatant. Wash cells with 5 mL of PBS, centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min and aspirate supernatant. Repeat wash, centrifugation, and aspiration one additional time.\nResuspend cells in 1 µL of PBS per 250,000 live cells and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Keep resuspended cells on ice in the dark and immediately continue to microinjections.\nNOTE: This ensures that 500 patient cells are injected into the zebrafish with each injection pump of 2 nL volume.\n3. Microinjecting Zebrafish Larvae\nNOTE: Microinjections should be completed within 1−3 h of staining to improve viability of cells.",
    "Prior to staining cells and injecting, make agarose plates for injecting by pouring 25 mL of 3% agarose in 1x Tris/borate/EDTA (TBE) into a Petri dish and allow it to solidify. Store plates at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nAlso prior to staining cells and injecting, dechorionate 2 dpf zebrafish using forceps under a dissecting microscope. For manual dechorionation, pull from opposite ends of the protective chorion of the zebrafish with forceps until the chorion tears and the zebrafish becomes unenveloped10.\nNOTE: Dechorionation can also be performed by using enzymatic treatment with pronase, as previously described10. Casper (roy-/-;nacre-/-) zebrafish were used for these experiments11. Any zebrafish larval strain can be used for xenografting. If pigment interferes with imaging or visualization, propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment can be used to block melanin synthesis if optically clear zebrafish strains are not available12.\nPrechill needles at 4 °C or on ice to prevent clumping of cells during microinjection. Load 5 µL of stained cells into a chilled nonfilamentous borosilicate glass needle using microloader pipette tips.\nNOTE: Microinjector and needle setup methods have been previously published13.\nLoad the needle into the microinjector arm. Bevel the needle tip using a sterile razor blade. Measure the droplet size in mineral oil using a stage micrometer, keeping droplet volume consistently at 2 nL (~0.15 mm diameter) throughout.\nUse 350 µL of 4 mg/mL tricaine-S to anesthetize ~30 dechorionated 2 dpf zebrafish in a Petri dish containing 25 mL of E3 media. After ~1 min transfer anesthetized larvae to a flat-surface injection plate (3% agarose in a Petri dish) and inject larvae with one pump of stained cells at the desired injection site (e.g., the yolk or the pericardium; see Figure 2A,B).",
    "NOTE: Injection site should be chosen based on the goal of the experiment. The most common injection site is the yolk. To get cells circulating in the bloodstream, the pericardium, duct of Cuvier, perivitelline space, or retro-orbital space can be used as injection sites. Orthotopic injection sites can also be used, such as the brain.\nWash larvae off the injection plate into a 10 cm2 Petri dish (30 larvae per plate) containing E3 media14 without methylene blue and incubate at 28 °C for a 1 h recovery period. Continue injecting until a desired number of larvae have been injected.\nNOTE: Ideally, inject 2−2.5-fold the number of larvae needed for experiments. There will be some die-off of larvae due to stress from injection and the increased incubation temperature. Typically, after practice with the technique, 800−1,500 zebrafish larvae can be injected by a single person within the 1−3 h when stained cells should be injected.\nMove plates of injected larvae to a 34 °C incubator. Do not place the Petri dishes of larvae directly on a metal shelf in the incubator to prevent overheating of the E3 water. For example, place an empty Petri dish between the shelf and Petri dish of larvae to act as a buffer. Remove dead zebrafish larvae after 24 and 48 hours post injection (hpi).\n4. Setting Up Drug Screen with Xenografted Zebrafish\nAt 48 hpi, screen zebrafish larvae for fluorescence/tumor engraftment and health (Figure 2C,D). Remove any dead or malformed zebrafish and select zebrafish with similar engraftment (Figure 2C,D, 1−3 and 1’−3’). Remove unengrafted zebrafish (Figure 2C,D, 5 and 5’).",
    "For yolk injected fish, remove fish where borders of the yolk cannot be seen around engrafted cell mass (Figure 2C, 4) as it makes quantification difficult. For pericardium injected fish, remove fish where injected cell mass encroaches into the yolk sac (Figure 2D, 4’).\nAdd zebrafish to a 96-well plate. To do this, cut the tip off of a 200 µL pipette tip, just large enough for a 4 dpf zebrafish to fit through. Aspirate 150 µL of E3 media with one zebrafish from the plate using a P200 pipette, and add to an empty well of a flat-bottom 96-well plate.\nDilute the drug to be tested in the required volume of E3 media, at 150 µL per well. Prepare drug at 2-fold the desired concentration. For example, prepare 20 µM of drug in E3 if the desired final concentration is 10 µM, since half of the total volume in each well is comprised of the drug solution. For the DMSO control group, add DMSO at the same volume as the drug.\nAdd 150 µL of 2x diluted drug solution to each well containing zebrafish larvae in 150 µL of E3, for a final volume of 300 µL with 1x drug solution per well.\nIncubate the plate at 34 °C. Check for dead zebrafish daily. After 2 days, if desired, refresh the drug by removing 200 µL of liquid from each well of the 96-well plate and replacing with 200 µL of 1x dilute drug solution or DMSO in E3 media.\nNOTE: The best results were found after 3 days of drug treatment for this experiment; however, the length of drug treatment can vary between 2−4 days and may need to be optimized based on the experiment being done or drugs being used.",
    "5. Imaging Xenografted Zebrafish Using a Fluorescence Microscope Equipped Imaging Unit and Automated Sampler Unit\nPrepare 1 L of fresh 4 mg/mL tricaine and 1.5 L of E3 media. Fill media bottle 1 with E3 media and media bottle 2 with tricaine.\nRemove all unwanted fluorescent channels in the imaging software and add the desired channel (DiI for this experiment). Check the desired fluorescent channel as an image will only be taken for the channels with a check mark. Also, select how the images will be taken (z-stacks, automation, loops in series, etc.).\nNOTE: For this experiment, the focus was manually set for each fish imaged to obtain the highest number of images with optimal focus.\nImage the DMSO control fish before the drug-treated fish so that the appropriate exposure time can be set in the imaging software. Once the exposure is set, do not change the exposure time for the duration of the experiment.\nNOTE: The focus can either be adjusted manually for each zebrafish to ensure there are no out of focus images, or for fully automated imaging, the same focus can be used between fish with out of focus images being discarded or fish reimaged prior to performing analysis. Furthermore, this experiment could be conducted by using any fluorescent imager followed by quantification of fluorescence using the ImageJ software.\n6. Quantifying Fluorescence Using ImageJ\nOpen ImageJ software.\nGo to File | Open and select the desired .czi file. The software will bring up an import options window.\nFor stack viewing select Hyperstacks, check Open Files Individually, check Autoscale, and check Split Channels. For the color option select Colorized.\nClick Plugins | Macros | Record.",
    "Click Image | Adjust | Threshold. Select image type as red in the dropdown menu on the right side of the threshold window. Adjust the minimum threshold until the software is only highlighting areas with fluorescence (Figure 3A) and click Apply. The software will convert the photo to black and white, with the selected area in black.\nNOTE: Use the same threshold for each image in the drug screen to keep results standardized and comparable.\nClick Analyze | Measure. The software will pull up a results window containing the fluorescent area for that image.\nClick Create on the Macro Recorder window. This will open up a new window with the code for the macro. Highlight all of the desired images for analysis and open as in step 6.2.\nSelect Run on the window with the macro. The results window will now contain the area for each image.\nNOTE: The image analysis can be done individually without recording and running a macro as well as by repeating the above steps for each image.\nCopy the measured data into a spreadsheet. Average the total fluorescence of all control (DMSO) samples. Calculate the percent difference using the following formula: –[(average DMSO area – experimental area)/average DMSO area] x 100% (Figure 3B).\nSubscription Required.
