    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVerify and optimize assay conditions\nTiming: [3 days]\nVerify the specificity of the Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 antibody against H3K9 peptides with 4 different methylation status (H3K9Me0, H3K9Me1, H3K9Me2, H3K9Me3)\nIn a 384-well black low volume assay plate, 10 μL/well of H3K9Me0-Biotin, H3K9Me1-Biotin, H3K9Me2-Biotin or H3K9Me3-Biotin at 200 nM or 500 nM is first dispensed, followed by 10 μL/well of Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 (4 nM) and AF488-Streptavidin (40 nM).\nThe mixture is set still and incubated for 30 min under room temperature (18°C–22°C).\nDetection of the TR-FRET signals (fluorescence emission ratio of 10,000 × 520 nm/490 nm) of each group using a PHERAstar FS plate reader.\nNote: This test is to demonstrate the specificity of Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 antibody to the H3K9Me2-Biotin, but not others. (Supplementary Figure 1A in (Singh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]))\nIn a 384-well black low volume assay plate, 2 nM Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 and 20 nM AF488-Streptavidin at 20 μL/well are incubated with 1:2 dilutions of the substrate peptide H3K9Me3-Biotin or the resulting product peptide H3K9Me2-Biotin for 30 min.\nDetection of the TR-FRET signals of each group.\nNote: This test is to demonstrate the specificity of Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 antibody to the resulting product peptide H3K9Me2-Biotin at all tested concentrations but not to the substrate peptide H3K9Me3-Biotin. (Supplementary Figure 1B in (Singh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]))\nNote: Specific detection of the newly generated H3K9Me2 peptide by the Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 antibody confers the assay with great specificity.",
    "To identify an optimal assay buffer, three buffers (buffer 1 to 3) are tested. The presence of KCl and MgCl2 could negatively impact the KDM4B enzymatic activity, whereas the presence of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) could positively increase KDM4B enzymatic activity (Supplementary Figure 1E and 1F in (Singh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])). These observations indicate that salt and pH have significant impact on KDM4B activity in TR-FRET assay, and the mechanisms need to be further investigated. The optimal assay buffer (buffer 4) is then formulated based on the results from the initial three buffers (Supplementary Figures 1E and 1F in (Singh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_965_5.csv\nTo optimize the concentration of KDM4B protein and incubation time of the demethylation assay\n10 μL/well of H3K9Me3-Biotin (1.5 μM) is first dispensed in 384-well assay plate, followed by 5 μL/well of KDM4B at 0 nM, 750 nM, 1.5 μM, 2.25 μM or 3 μM.\nThe plate is incubated for 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 or 90-min under 18°C–22°C.\nThe reaction mixtures are then dispensed with 5 μL/well 8 nM Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 antibody and 80 nM AF488-Streptavidin, incubated for an additional 15-min before the detection of TR-FRET signals.\nNote: The final KDM4B concentration at 250 nM with a 30-min incubation time is optimal (Supplementary Figure 1C and 1D in (Singh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])). KDM4B continues removing methyl group(s) from the newly generated H3K9Me2 peptide, generating the H3K9Me1 peptide, which may consequently reduce the sensitivity of the Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 antibody over time. One alternative solution is to add a known KDM4B inhibitor at high concentration to all wells after incubation but before addition of the H3K9Me2 antibody. This would stop the reaction and make the assay less sensitive to different development times.",
    "Critical: It’s critical to detect the reaction at an optimal incubation time in which the presence of the maximal H3K9Me2 peptide allows the highest detection sensitivity.\nDMSO tolerance test for the KDM4B-mediated demethylation assay.\nIn the presence of DMSO at 0.0, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%, 250 nM KDM4B is incubated with 1 μM H3K9Me3-Biotin in 15 μL/well for 30 min.\n8 nM Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 antibody and 80 nM AF488-Streptavidin (5 μL/well) are dispensed for an additional 15-min incubation.\nDetection of TR-FRET signals.\nNote: DMSO has minimal negative impact under the tested concentration range from 0 to 10% (Supplementary Figure 1G in (Singh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])).\nPerform screening assay\nTiming: [1 day]\nDispense 10 μL/well of 1.5 μM H3K9Me3-Biotin peptide solution in an assay buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM α-ketoglutarate, 80 μM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 2 mM L-ascorbic acid and 0.01% BSA] to black low volume 384-well assay plates by a Wellmate.\nBriefly spin down the assay plates.\nDispense stock compound solutions from both compound plate (step 1) and control plate (step 3) using a robotic pintool at 30 nL/well (primary single dose screen) or 140 nL/well (dose response test) to an assay plate with 10 μL/well 1.5 μM H3K9Me3-Biotin peptide. Each compound is assayed in triplicates.\nNote: The 30 nL pintool is used to achieve final concentration of 20 μM for the primary screen. To obtain IC50 value for the compounds chosen from primary screen, we used higher volume of pintool (140 nl) in dose response assay to achieve a concentration range of 4.7 nM to 93.3 μM in a 1-to-3 dilutions for 10 concentration levels.",
    "Dispense 5 μL/well assay buffer to columns 1 and 13, 5 μL/well KDM4B (750 nM) in an assay buffer to columns 2-to-12 and 14-to-24 in the primary single dose screen, or 5 μL/well assay buffer to columns 23-to-24, 5 μL/well KDM4B (750 nM) in an assay buffer to columns 1-to-22 in the dose response test.\nThe contents in each assay plate are mixed by shaking.\nEach assay plate is spun down briefly, followed by 30 min incubation without shaking under 18°C–22°C.\nNote: The final tested compound concentration was 20 μM with 0.2% DMSO in the primary screen. The compound concentration range was 4.7 nM to 93.3 μM in a 1-to-3 serial dilution with 0.7% DMSO in the dose response test.\nDispense 5 μL/well of 8 nM Tb-anti-H3K9Me2 antibody and 80 nM AF488-Streptavidin to the incubated assay plates. The assay plates are then shaken, spun down briefly and followed by 15-min incubation under 18°C–22°C protected from light.\nTR-FRET signal (fluorescence emission ratio of 10,000 × 520 nm/490 nm) of each well in assay plates is detected by a PHERAstar FS plate reader.\nAnalyze activity of each tested compound by normalizing its TR-FRET signal to that of positive and negative controls in each plate for the primary screen and dose response test. For dose response test, the activities of each chemical at different concentration levels are analyzed by the GraphPad PRISM software by fitting into a sigmoidal dose−response equation to derive dose-response curve and IC50 value, if applicable. For representative primary screen figure, see Figure 1C in (Singh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). For representative dose−response curve, see Figure 1F in (Singh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).",
    "Note: The DMSO control wells with KDM4B protein and those without KDM4B protein are used as negative (0% inhibition) and positive (100% inhibition) controls, respectively; the dose response test was performed in triplicates."
