    "The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston has approved all methods described here.\n1. General recommendations\nIf time allows, complete the questionnaires and the oral health assessment on subsequent days or with a break between them as this reduces patient fatigue and resistance.\nBegin with the questionnaires to create rapport and trust between the screener and patient, which eases the transition to the oral screening, when the screener will be in close proximity to the patient's face and mouth.\nAlways allow the patient to rest between questions if they request. Elaboration on the questionnaire items is not necessary, so as needed, gently keep the conversation on topic.\nFor research purposes, randomize the order of the questionnaires and include information regarding the last time the patient had a meal or drink (other than water) and the last time the patient performed oral hygiene (i.e., brushing teeth, using oral rinse, etc.), as needed.\nUse proper infection control techniques. Be mindful of the sequence of physical contact the oral screener has with the patient and surrounding objects. For example, do not use examination gloves (or bare hands) to touch the patient's mouth, pick up a pen to write the results on paper, and then return to the patient's mouth.\nRecruit a second observer to serve as the scribe, writing the results of the oral screening on the paper questionnaires.\n\tNOTE: This allows the oral screening to proceed more quickly and also serves as an infection control, limiting the oral screener's physical contact exclusively to the patient.\nInclude all patients over 50 years of age.",
    "NOTE: As the assessment is intended for use to rate oral health for possible referral to a dentist, the method can be used on all patients, including those who have dentures, are edentulous, bed-ridden, mute, or cognitively impaired. In the latter cases, ask caregivers for responses to the self-report questions.\n2. Training\nRead the original research papers for the four oral health assessment tools included here. Pay particular attention to the Introduction and Discussion sections of the papers, as they describe why and for what populations each tool was created.\nWatch the video associated with this publication to see the oral health screening in action.\nPractice screening friends and family for oral health status using Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and the protocol described here. Repeat until an individual's oral screening can be repeated in under 30 min.\n3. General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI)9\nAsk the patient to sit comfortably to answer questions. Tell the patient to consider the last 3 months when answering. If the patient is unable to answer the questions due to a disability, have a caregiver answer the questions and make a note of this.\nAsk questions from Table 1 one at a time. Mark the patient's answers on a paper or digital copy of this GOHAI questionnaire. At the conclusion of the 12 questions, thank the patient and ask if he/she has any comments to add.\nScore the GOHAI in one of two ways, either the additive or simple count methods.",
    "NOTE: Additive score: For the 3 questions worded in a positive way (questions 3, 5 and 7), reverse the codes (1 = never, 2 = seldom, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = always to 1 = always, 2 = often, 3 = sometimes, 4 = seldom, 5 = never). Sum the response codes for the 12 answers. For this method, the GOHAI scores range from 12 to 60. The simple count GOHAI score is used to ensure that patients did not get confused using a 5-point scale. Score 0-points for \"never\" and \"seldom\" and 1-point for \"sometimes\" \"often\" and \"always\". Summed GOHAI scores with the simple count method range from 0 to 12. In both cases, higher scores represent poorer oral health-related quality of life.\n4. Swallowing subscale of the Radboud Oral Motor Inventory (ROMP)10\nTell the patient to consider the last 3 months when answering the next 7 questions. If the patient is unable to answer the questions due to a disability, have a caregiver answer the questions and make a note of this.\nAsk questions from Table 2 one at a time. Mark the patient's answers on a paper or digital copy of this swallowing subscale of the ROMP. Thank the patient and ask if he/she has any comments to add.\nSum the scores of each swallowing question for a total swallowing score.\n\tNOTE: ROMP swallowing scores range from 7 to 35; higher scores represent worsened swallowing ability. The simple count method can also be used with this questionnaire (see step 3.3 for more information).\n5. Brief Oral Health Status Examination (BOHSE)11",
    "Have a paper copy of the BOHSE for the oral screening and mark scores on it during examination of each oral and dental area (Table 3). Recruit a second observer to serve as a scribe to speed the examination and prevent infections.\nAsk the patient to sit comfortably and to expect observation of his/her neck, mouth, and teeth. Tell the patient he/she should not feel any discomfort and if they do, to communicate this by raising his/her hand.\nStand in front of the seated patient. Cup fingers and gently palpate the submandibular and submental lymph nodes just anterior to the angle of the jaw. Ask the patient if he/she is tender to the touch. Select the BOHSE score for lymph nodes (0−2) that applies.\n\tNOTE: Lymph nodes are small (~1 cm diameter) lumps beneath the skin but are not palpable if they are healthy. Infected lymph nodes are tender, soft, painful to the touch and are movable. Cancerous lymph nodes are hard, not painful and unmovable.\nTell the patient that next is observation of his/her lips. Observe the lips and corners of the mouth for their color, dryness and any other abnormalities (such as ulcers, bleeding, crusty scars, sores with rounded edges or discoloration at the edge of the lips that meet the facial skin). Ask the patient for how long he/she has had any abnormalities observed. Select the BOHSE score for lips (0−2) that applies.\nTell the patient that next is observation inside his/her mouth. Ask the patient to open his/her mouth and stick out his/her tongue. Observe the status of the tongue for color, dryness and any other abnormalities such as ulcers and bleeding.",
    "Touch the tongue (with examination gloves) and assess for texture. Ask the patient for how long he/she has had any abnormalities observed. Select the BOHSE score for tongue (0−2) that applies.\n\tNOTE: If the patient cannot protrude the tongue for as long as needed, grasp the tongue with thumb and forefinger and gently hold the tongue outside the oral cavity.\nObserve inside his/her mouth at the inside of the cheeks and the floor and roof of the mouth for their color, dryness and any other abnormalities such as ulcers and bleeding. Use a tongue depressor as needed to stretch open the cheeks and a penlight for better observation. Ask the patient for how long he/she has had any abnormalities observed. Select the BOHSE score for tissue inside cheek, floor and roof of mouth (0−2) that applies.\nExamine the patient's gums, using a tongue depressor to gently press his/her gums and evaluate for firmness and coloration. Ask the patient if he/she has any loose teeth or soreness around his/her teeth. Select the BOHSE score for gums (0−2) that applies.\n\tNOTE: The gums should not have redness, bleeding, food debris or plaque at the triangle between the teeth.\nTell the patient that next is looking at his/her saliva and touching his/her tongue with a tongue depressor. Observe for oral tissue dryness and salivary flow (i.e., by saliva pooling in the floor of the mouth). Ask the patient if his/her mouth feels dry when eating or if he/she has difficulty swallowing food without drinking water. Select the BOHSE score for saliva (0−2) that applies.",
    "Tell the patient next is inspection of the teeth. Count all of the natural (original) teeth and write the number at the bottom of the BOHSE table. Look for decayed, broken or chipped teeth while looking at the natural teeth. Select the BOHSE score for natural teeth (0−2) that applies.\n\tNOTE: Decayed teeth may have discoloration or breakdown of the tooth surface, widening of the fissures of the tooth, and there may be small holes in the white enamel or even brown or black visible discolored spots.\nLook at the condition of any artificial teeth (i.e., dentures, implants, or crowns). Look for chips and wear. Ask the patient: if he/she has partial dentures or has had any tooth replacements or implants, if he/she has lost any artificial teeth or other oral appliances in the past, and how often and for what purposes the artificial teeth are worn. Select the BOHSE score for artificial teeth (0−2) that applies.\nCount the pairs of teeth in the chewing position.\n\tNOTE: These are maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) teeth that contact when the jaw is closed, enabling bite. The pairs of teeth can be natural or artificial. For example, teeth 8 and 25 (Figure 1) are one pair; if one of them is missing, do not count as a pair.\nScore overall oral cleanliness by observing the entire oral cavity and teeth for food particles (called food debris), and tartar (called calculus). Select BOHSE score for oral cleanliness that applies (0−2). Thank the patient for his/her willingness to participate and ask if he/she has any comments to add.\n\tNOTE: Dental calculus is a crusty deposit at the gum line of the tooth that can trap stains on the teeth and cause yellow discoloration.",
    "Sum the scores of each BOHSE item for a total BOHSE score.\n\tNOTE: BOHSE scores range from 0 to 20; higher numbers represent poor oral health. Refer the patient to a dentist if any score for an item is a 2.\n6. Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S)12\nAsk the patient to sit comfortably. Tell the patient that a dye will be applied to his/her teeth to be able to see plaque accumulation. Explain that the dye may stay in the mouth for a few hours if he/she doesn't brush his/her teeth, but it will slowly fade away.\nHold the plastic blister pack containing the plaque disclosing dye swab. Locate the cotton tip with the pink line around it. Remove the other half of the plaque disclosing dye swab from its plastic blister pack, leaving the end with the pink line in the plastic. Locate the cotton tip with the pink line around it. With the thumb and index finger of each hand grasping either side of the pink line, break the cotton tip from the shaft by giving the pink line a sharp snap with both hands. Confirm that the pink dye, stored in the hollow shaft of the swab, drains quickly to the other cotton tip.\n\tNOTE: The pink disclosing dye will discolor clothing, skin, and gums, so be careful to touch the swab tip only to teeth. The dye adheres to tooth plaque and may remain in the mouth for hours, unless brushed or wiped away.",
    "Swab the six tooth surfaces depicted in red in Figure 1 with pink disclosing dye: the labial surfaces (outer side) of the upper right (tooth 8) and lower left (tooth 24) central incisors, the lingual surfaces (tongue-side) of the selected lower molars (teeth 19 and 30), and the buccal surfaces (cheek-side) of the selected upper molars (teeth 3 and 14). In the absence of the indicated upper or lower central incisor, substitute the central incisor (tooth 9 or 25, respectively) on the opposite side of the midline. Substitute upper (teeth 1, 2, 15, or 16) and lower molars (teeth 17, 18, 31, or 32) as needed. Gently rinse with water and score the debris index using the criteria in Figure 2 under the section \"Debris Index Before Tooth Brushing\".\nProvide oral hygiene instructions if the debris index is high.\nCalculate debris index by adding the debris scores for buccal, lingual and labial, and then divide the total by the number of examined surfaces.\nSubscription Required.
