    "Sf9 culture (perform in a tissue culture hood except for centrifugation steps)Sf9 cells in a cryo-vial are stored in liquid nitrogen.Thaw an aliquot (1-2 ml) of stock Sf9 insect cells (stored in liquid nitrogen) in a 37 °C water bath and resuspend into 10 ml Sf-900 III medium.Spin down the cells at 125 x g for 5 min, remove the medium by pipetting, and gently resuspend the cells in a 15 ml conical tube with 10 ml Sf900 III medium by pipetting up and down.Transfer the cells into a 250 ml flask and add 15 ml of Sf900 III to make a 25 ml cell suspension.Incubate the cells in a temperature controlled shaker at 27 °C and at 125 rpm.Monitor the cell density every day by manually counting the number of cells using a hemocytometer. When the cell density reaches 3.0-3.5 x 106 cells/ml (normally within 24-48 h), split the cells with Sf-900 III medium to make another 20 ml culture at 0.7 x 106 cells/ml. Incubate the cells in a temperature controlled shaker at 27 °C and at 125 rpm.After repeating the steps A6-A8 for 2-3 times, the doubling time should become approximately 24 h. Maintain Sf9 cultures at 0.5-3.5 x 106 cell/ml in a 250 ml flask and grow up in a larger flask for P2 virus infection. Preparation of bacmidsThe pNGFP-FB3 vector (Figure 1) harbors STREP tag, EGFP, thrombin recognition site, multiple cloning site (MCS) and a stop codon. The P2X7 receptor gene is subcloned between BamHI and XhoI sites.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830231714_8563.jpgFigure 1. Vector map of pNFGP-FB3.
