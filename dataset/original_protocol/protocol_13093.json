    "NOTE: The human plasma used is commercially available (Table of Materials). No further biological samples obtained from humans were used.\n1. ​Glycan release\nDenaturation of (glyco-)proteins\n\t\nPrepare the glycoprotein standards (e.g., IgG, a monoclonal antibody) at a concentration of a 10 µg·µL-1 in deionized H2O. For human plasma, the concentration used is 70 µg·µL-1.\n\t\tNOTE: The samples should be vortexed until all solid proteins are dissolved. Human plasma (lyophilized) was used for the preparation of the plasma samples.\nTake 20 µL of glycoprotein samples (200 µg) and lyophilized human plasma (1.4 mg).\nAdd 40 µL of 2% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) (w/v).\nIncubate the samples at 60 °C for 10 min to denature the (glyco-)proteins.\n\t\tNOTE: The samples could be mixed at 500 rpm by a thermomixer during the incubation. A shaking water bath could be used alternatively.\nGlycan release\n\t\nAdd 20 µL of 4% Igepal-CA630 to the samples from step 1.1.4.\nAdd 20 µL of 5x PBS (phosphate buffer saline).\nPrepare PNGase F enzyme at the concentration of 1 U·µL-1 in deionized water.\nAdd 1 U of enzyme for glycoprotein standards and 2 U of enzyme for human plasma samples.\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C for 16 h.\nProcainamide labeling\n\t\nPrepare labeling solution using procainamide hydrochloric acid (110 mg·mL-1 in DMSO/AA (dimethyl sulfoxide /glacial acetic acid) 7/3, v/v).\nPrepare reductive amination solution using sodium cyanoborohydride (65 mg·mL-1 in DMSO/AA, 7/3, v/v).\n\t\tCAUTION: Sodium cyanoborohydride is very toxic and flammable. Wear eye shields. 2-picoline borane complex (107 mg·mL-1 in DMSO) could be used alternatively.\nMix these solutions in a ratio of 1:1, v/v to prepare the labeling mixture.\nAdd 100 µL of this labeling mixture to the glycan released sample from step 1.2.5.\nIncubate the samples at 65 °C for 2 h.",
    "2. Purification of Procainamide Labeled N- glycans by Solid-phase Extraction (SPE) Cartridge\nPrepare a solution of microcrystalline cellulose (100 mg·mL-1) in deionized water.\nTake 300 µL of microcrystalline cellulose and insert it into the microcentrifuge tubes.\nWash the microcrystalline cellulose with 1 mL of deionized H2O.\nWash the microcrystalline cellulose with 1 mL of ACN/MQ (acetonitrile/dH2O), 85/15, v/v for conditioning.\n\tNOTE: The microcentrifuge should be used for 1 min to discard washing solutions carefully.\nTake 120 µL of glycan release solution and mix with 680 µL of ACN to obtain proper loading conditions (85/15, v/v, ACN/sample).\nMix this mixture with microcrystalline cellulose in the microcentrifuge tubes.\nIncubate it at room temperature in a thermomixer by shaking at 500 rpm for 15 min.\nTransfer the slurry to an SPE cartridge (1 mL volume capacity).\n\tNOTE: Do not allow air to enter cartridge packing.\nDiscard the loading solutions by passing slowly (1 drop/second).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the SPE system is connected to the vacuum pump. Solvents may flow with gravity. When necessary, apply vacuum via a vacuum pump. The applied vacuum pressure should be appropriately adjusted to transfer liquids down slowly.\nWash the sample by passing 1 mL of ACN/MQ/TFA (acetonitrile/dH2O/trifluoroacetic acid) solution (85/14/1, v/v/v) twice.\nWash the sample by passing 1 mL of ACN/MQ mixture (85/15, v/v) twice.\nElute the procainamide labeled N-glycans with 0.75 mL of water.\nDry the elution solution with a concentrator overnight.\n\tNOTE: Use a concentrator temperature of 45 °C for drying.\nDissolve the dried samples in a mixture of 100 µL of ACN/MQ (75/25, v/v) and transfer this solution to the vials, including an insert.\n\t​NOTE: The redissolved samples should be vortexed for 20 second.\n3. HILIC-FLD-MS/MS Analysis",
    "Insert Tee (T) adaptors to the HILIC column to separate the flow into the two equal volumes. Connect one of both to the FLD detector, the other to the MS detector.\n\tNOTE: The flow lines must be the same lengths.\nAdjust a gradient program for HILIC separations of procainamide labeled N-glycans as indicated in Supplementary Figure 1. Use Mobile Phase A: 50 mM ammonium formate (pH: 4.4 and Mobile Phase B: 100 % ACN).\n\tNOTE: The gradient program could be further optimized depending on the glycan heterogeneity of samples.\nClick the Sampler button and set the injection volume to 10 µL.\nClick the Column Comp and adjust the column temperature to 60 °C.\nClick FLD and adjust the FLD excitation and emission wavelengths to 310 nm and 370 nm, respectively.\nAdjust the MS source, tune, and MS/MS parameters as displayed in Supplementary Figure 2.\n\t​NOTE: The MS and MS/MS parameters could be changed depending on the mass spectrometry used in the analysis.\n4. Data Analysis\nIdentification of procainamide labeled N-glycans\n\t\nExport MS/MS data by a proper format for database searches (e.g., .mgf, .xml).\nInsert them into a database search tool for the identification of N-glycans.\nSelect the sample name listed in the software and click the Glycan Search button for the identification of procainamide labeled N-glycans by using the Carbbank database with given parameters (Supplementary Figure 3).\nOpen the edit chromatograms button in the data analysis software for raw data and select extracted ion chromatogram type by filtering in all MSn.\nAdd specific masses for core-fucosylated fragment proc-N1F1 (m/z 587.3+) and bisected fragments proc-H1N3 (m/z 1009.5+) and proc-H1N3F1 (m/z 1155.5+).\nDetermine the precursors containing core-fucosylated and bisected N-glycan structure fragments.\nExport the identified N-glycan structures by the software (Supplementary Table 1-3).",
    "Check the precursors detected manually for determination of core-fucosylated and bisected N-glycan structures.\nQuantification of procainamide labeled N-glycans by an open-source software24\nSelect FLD chromatogram in the chromatograms and click the method in the software. Open a method for exporting chromatograms as .xy file format.\nConvert the .xy file format of exported chromatograms to .txt files.\nOpen the quantitative analysis software.\n\t\tNOTE: The software used in the study can be downloaded from a Github source (https://github.com/Tarskin/HappyTools).\nFollow the instructions and tutorials of the program presented by the developer.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use a batch process to export relative areas.\nAdjust the setting parameters (Supplementary Figure 4). Define four minimum peaks and 27 signal/noise ratios for calibrations.\nOpen the results file with proper software such as Microsoft Excel for further evaluation.\nSubscription Required.
