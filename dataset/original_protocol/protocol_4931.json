    "Adult DRG neurons are obtained from adult C57BL6 mice. After animals are sacrificed, skin and paravertebral muscles are dissected to expose the vertebral column. Bilateral dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from the S1 up to the C1 level are freshly dissected using fine scissors and forceps under a dissecting microscope and soaked into fresh cold DMEM. Make sure to be careful not to damage DRGs when detaching the DRGs from the roots and nerves.  Note: It is critically important to dissect DRGs as quickly as possible. The collection of the total DRGs from one mouse should not take longer than 30 min.   Transfer DRGs to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube with a blue pipette tip with an end cut off. Quickly spin down DRGs and aspirate off DMEM. Add 1 ml of DMEM containing 125 U/ml type XI collagenase and incubate for 90 min at 37 °C with gentle rotation using a twist shaker kept in an incubator. The optimal range for rotation speed is around 35-45 rpm.   Aspirate off collagenase-containing DMEM and resuspend DRGs with 1 ml of DMEM. When DMEM is added, DRGs will float. Wait until DRGs fall down, and then aspirate off. Repeat this step at least five times to remove collagenase completely.  Note: Try not to aspirate off completely. It is important to prevent DRGs from being sucked out.    Transfer DRGs to 15 ml conical tube using a cut off blue pipette tip. Then triturate at least 15 times using a blue tip until a homogenous suspension of cells is achieved. Note: Trituration should be very gentle. Avoid making bubbles and try not to touch the bottom of conical tube.   Centrifuge the tube at about 239 x g for 3 min to remove cell debris in supernatant.",
    "Resuspend cell pellets in 1 ml Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and triturate 5 to 10 times. Then pass the cells through a 70 μm cell strainer installed on a 50 ml conical tube. Wait for 2 min, and then pour Neurobasal/B-27 medium using a pipette-aid to the strainer so that cells passing the strainer come off easily. Wait one more minute.   Plate dissociated cells onto a 6 well plate pre-coated with 0.01% poly-D-lysine and laminin (3 μg/ml), and shake the plate very gently for the cells to be evenly distributed. A total of 6 x 106 DRG neurons are plated for each well. Then, the plate is placed in a CO2 incubator maintained at 37 °C. Note: Poly-D-lysine (0.01%) and laminin (3 μg/ml) are diluted with distilled water. Poly-D-lysine coats the plate for 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C, after which the plate is washed twice with distilled water. Then, the plate is coated with laminin for 2 h at room temperature, and washed twice with PBS. Then the plate is dried at room temperature before cell plating.    The co-cultures need to be set up 4 h after the initial plating of dissociated DRG neurons. Primary peritoneal macrophages are prepared from adult C57BL6 mice. After sacrificing mice in CO2 chamber, abdominal skin is delicately dissected to expose the peritoneum.   Inject 10 ml of ice-cold PBS into the peritoneum. Gently massage the peritoneum for 1-2 min. Then, suck out PBS and transfer to a new 50 ml conical tube.    The lavage fluid is centrifuged at 239 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells.",
    "The cell pellets are resuspended in 3 ml of the red blood cell lysis buffer for 3 min at room temperature (RT) and then centrifuged at 239 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells again.   Pelleted cells are resuspended in macrophage culture medium. The peritoneal macrophages are plated on a cell culture insert placed on the 6 well plate where dissociated DRG neurons have been plated 4 h before. The number of plated macrophages is kept 5 times higher than that of cultured DRG neurons.   4 h after macrophage plating, the neuron–macrophage co-cultures are treated with dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP; 100 μM) or PBS as a control. In some wells, macrophage deactivator minocycline is added with db-cAMP at a concentration of 10 μg/ml.   After 24 h, the culture medium is replaced with fresh macrophage culture medium. The co-cultures are maintained for 72 h without changing the medium.   Then the conditioned medium is collected, centrifuged at 239 x g for 5 min, and passed through a 0.2 μm filter to remove any remaining cellular debris. The collected conditioned medium is stored at -70 °C until use.    For neurite outgrowth assays, adult DRG neurons are obtained and dissociated using the same method described in steps 1-3.    Cell pellets are resuspended in Neurobasal-A supplemented with B27 and a total of 1 x 104 cells (per well) are plated onto eight-well culture slides pre-coated with 0.01% poly-D-lysine and 3 μg/ml laminin. Precoating is done using the same method described in step 6.   The neuron cultures are maintained in an incubator for 2 h allowing for cell attachment to the bottom. And the culture medium is replaced with the thawed conditioned medium collected in step 15.",
    "After 15 h from the initial plating, the cells are directly fixed with 4% cold paraformaldehyde for 20 min.    The fixed cells on slides are washed three times with 1x PBS and incubated with a blocking solution consisting of 10% NGS and 0.1% Triton-X for 30 min. Then, wash with 1x PBS twice, perform primary antibody (Tuj-1) staining at 1:1,000 dilution with 10% NGS for 4 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C.   Wash twice with 1x PBS, and perform secondary antibody (goat-anti rabbit) staining at 1:500 dilution with 10% NGS for 2 h at RT. Then, wash the slides twice with 1x PBS and mount the coverslips on the slides with mounting gel.   Take images using confocal microscope for immunostained β III tubulin to visualize neurite outgrowth."
