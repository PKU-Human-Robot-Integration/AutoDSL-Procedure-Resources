Thaw the plasmids prepared in the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section (step 1 and step 2).\nIn the DNA tube, add plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2 N, M, E, and S (SWH or SDel) of the following amounts:\npCMV3-SARS2-NP-myc 6.7 μg.\npUNO1-SARS2-M 3.3 μg.\npUNO1-SARS2-E 3.3 μg.\npCAGGS-SARS2-S (SWH or SDel) 2.5 μg.\nThe total DNA amount is 15.8 μg. Dilute plasmid DNA with 158 μL H2O (final concentration: 0.1 μg/μL). Vortex for 5 s and spin briefly.\nPrepare 0.1 μg/μL PEI solution in the PEI tube by diluting 10 μL PEI stock (1 mg/mL) in 90 μL of PBS or medium. Add 17.38 μL PEI solution into the DNA tube (1.1 μL of PEI/1 μg of DNA). Vortex for 5 s and spin briefly.\nIncubate the mixture for 15 min at room temperature to allow the DNA/PEI complex formation.",
    "Add the PEI/DNA complex dropwise into the 293T cell dish and gently swirl the dish. Culture the co-transfected cells at 5% CO2, 37°C for 2–3 h.\nRemove the PEI/DNA-complex containing medium, add 10 mL of complete DMEM and continue culture for a total of 72 h.\nCollect the supernatant at 48 h in 50 mL tubes, and store at −80°C. Add 10 mL of new complete DMEM to cells in each dish and continue to culture.\nCollect the supernatant again at 72 h. Store at −80°C or directly use for following purification steps.\nNote: The PEI working solution (0.1 μg/μL) is freshly prepared for the same experiment. The PEI stock solution (1 mg/mL) store at −80°C or −20°C for up to 1 year, or at 4°C for up to 3 months.\nAlternatives: Lipofectamine 3000 can be used instead of PEI. In this case, add the DNA plasmids, 30 μL P3000, and 250 μL of Opti-MEM in the “DNA” tube. Add 15 μL Lipofectamine 3000 and 250 μL Opti-MEM in the “Lipo” tube. Vortex, spin briefly and sit for 5 min at room temperature. Add the DNA solution to the Lipo tube. Vortex, spin briefly and incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Add the Lipo/DNA mixture dropwise into the cells, incubate for 4–6 h at 5% CO2, 37°C, and change medium and culture as above described (step 1-g, 1h).\nAlternatives: 293TN cells can be used to produce VLPs with higher production.\nAlternatives: The supernatant collected at 48 h generally contains the major part of the VLPs that can be produced from the transfected cells, so it is optional to collect the supernatant at 72 h.\nPause point: The supernatants can be stored at −80°C for 4–8 weeks.",
    "Note: The number of 10 cm dishes with cells used for VLP production depends on the yield and the amount of VLPs needed. Generally, the startup is 2 dishes of cells.\nPurify the SARS2-VLPs by ultra-centrifugation in a Beckman 70Ti rotor.\nThaw the SARS2-VLPs containing supernatants collected at 48 h and 72 h post-co-transfection, and combine them in 50 mL tubes.\nClarify the supernatant with light centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at room temperature, filter through a 0.45 μm membrane.\nLoad the supernatant (20 mL) on the top of a 20% sucrose cushion (2–4 mL), ultracentrifuge at 100,000–120,000 × g, at 4°C for 3 h using a Beckman Type 70Ti rotor.\nResuspend SARS2-VLPs containing pellet carefully in 100 μL of RPMI-1640 plain medium for each ultracentrifuge tube. Mix all the VLPs solutions, aliquot (30μL /tube), and store at −80°C.\nNote: If the VLPs solution is turbid after ultracentrifugation, see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nCritical: The tube balance before ultracentrifugation is very important. The removal of supernatant after ultracentrifugation should be done carefully and as soon as possible. Because the pellet may dislodge over time, it is recommended to remove the supernatant immediately and finish all the tubes within 5–10 min.\nCollect producer cells in cold PBS and spin down (1000 × g, 5 min at 4°C). See step 7.\nProduce HIV-based SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped VLPs\nTiming: 4 days\nHIV-based Pseudotyped Virus Like Particles (PVLPs) incorporated with SARS-CoV-2 S protein from the SWH or SDel is produced in 293T cells by using co-transfection methods, as previously described.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] After the purification of PVLP-SWH and PVLP-SDel, these PVLPs needed to be characterized by WB and quantified by ELISA before the treatment of macrophages.",

Dilute plasmid DNA with double distilled H2O into 75 μL (0.1 μg/μL). Vortex for 5 s and spin briefly.\nPrepare 0.1 μg/ μL PEI solution by diluting the 10 μL of PEI stock (1 mg/mL) in 90 μL of PBS or medium in the PEI tube. Take 8.25 μL PEI solution into the DNA tube (1.1 μL of PEI/1 μg of DNA).

    "Note: The negative control HIV-VLP-Gag is produced at the same time via transfection without the SARS2-S plasmid. This empty HIV-VLP does not have the HIV envelope protein and SARS2-S.\nAlternatives: Lipofectamine 3000 can be used instead of PEI. In this case, the DNA plasmids are diluted in 250 μL of Opti-MEM and mixed with 15 μL P3000 in the “DNA” tube. Add 7.5 μL Lipofectamine 3000 and 250 μL Opti-MEM in the “Lipo” tube.

    "Note: If the PVLPs solution is turbid after ultracentrifugation, see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nCritical: The removal of supernatant after ultracentrifugation should be done carefully and as soon as possible.\nCollect producer cells in cold PBS and spin down (1000 × g, 5 min). See step 7.\nVerify viral protein expressions in producer cells and VLPs by western blotting\nTiming: 2 days\nWB is performed to determine the S (SWH and SDel) expression/incorporation and the VLPs (SARS2-VLP and HIV-PVLP) formation. The expression of S, the SARS-CoV-2 VLP’s core protein N (Nucleocapsid), and HIV Gag-p24 capsid in producer cells and VLPs/PVLPs samples are verified. The incorporation efficiency of different S proteins in VLPs is semi-quantified by comparing the ratio of S/N or S/p24 through the software ImageJ.\nPrepare samples for Western Blot.\nPrepare the VLP samples.\nDefrost the SARS2-VLP and HIV-PVLP samples.\nMix 30 μL (2–10 μg total protein) of SARS2-VLP or HIV-PVLP with 10 μL of sample loading buffer (4×).\nBoil the samples in capped tubes for 10 min in a boiling water bath.\nPrepare the producer cell samples.\nWash the producer 293TN or 293T cells (5×106) with cold PBS.\nLyse cells in chilled 500 μL of RIPA lysis buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor (Promega) for 30 min on ice.

The supernatant is transferred to a new tube.\nMix 30 μL of cell lysate with 10 μL of sample loading buffer (4×) and boil for 10 min.\nNote: In the tubes of boiled samples, the evaporated water will condense on the top. To homogenize the samples, spin the tubes for 10 s, vortex for 10 s, and spin for 10 s again.",
    "Note: The producer cell samples are used to determine if the transfection is successful and if plasmids can express proteins. One positive control for S, N, and p24 protein is needed in the same gel to confirm that the antibodies work well. Generally, the positive control is the commercial protein or peptide, or the cell lysate of cells transfected with the commercial expression plasmid.\nNote: Store RIPA lysis buffer at 4°C for up to 1 year. Store sample loading buffer at 4°C for 1 year or −20°C for up to 2 year.\nRun SDS-PAGE and transfer:\nLoad the SARS2-VLP or HIV-PVLP of 20–40 μL (boiled sample) and producer cell lysates of 20–40 μL (boiled sample) to wells of SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad, 10% TGX FastCast gel).\nRun the SDS-PAGE in a running buffer (1×) (120 V, ∼90 min).\nAlternatives: The total protein concentration of VLP/PVLP samples or cell lysates can be quantified by using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit to normalize the loading amount for SDS-PAGE. Load VLP/PVLP samples of 1–5 μg (total protein) or cell lysates of 10–30 μg (total protein) in each well of the gel.\nNote: Store the stock (10× Tris-Glycine-SDS buffer) and working running buffer at room temperature for up to 1 year.\nWet transfer the proteins in gel to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, 0.45 μm pore size; 100 V, ∼90 min) in an ice-cold transfer buffer.\nBlock the membrane in 5% skimmed milk (in PBST) with gentle shaking for 1–2 h at room temperature or at 4°C overnight (8–18 h) with shaking (waving shaker, 20–30 rpm).\nPause point: The membrane blocking can be performed at 4°C overnight with shaking.\nNote: Store the transfer buffer at 4°C for up to 1 year.\nAntibody incubation and protein detection:",
    "Detect the S proteins (SWH and SDel) by incubating with human anti-S-NTD antibody (Elabscience; diluted in PBST, 1:4000) at room temperature for 2 h or at 4°C overnight (8–18 h) with shaking.\nDetect the N protein in SARS2-VLP by incubating with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 N antibody (Sino Biological; diluted in PBST, 1:2000).\nDetect the HIV p24 in HIV-PVLP by incubating with rabbit anti-HIV Gag p24 antibody (NIH HIV Reagent Program; diluted in PBST, 1:10000).\nAlternatives: The S protein also can be detected with rabbit anti-RBD polyclonal antibody or mouse anti-RBD monoclonal antibody. The SARS2-VLP N protein also can be detected with rabbit anti-Myc antibodies.\nNote: The membrane can be cut into horizontal strips according to the appropriate protein size. For example, the S protein (full length is 180 kDa and S1 is 100 kDa) strip is from 65 kDa to the top edge of the membrane. The N protein (46 kDa) strip is from 30 kDa to 65 kDa. The HIV p24 protein (mature form 24 kDa; immature p55, 55 kDa) strip is from the bottom edge of the membrane to 60 kDa.\nPause point: The membrane can be incubated in the primary antibody at 4°C overnight (8–18 h).\nNote: Store the stock PBST (10×) buffer at 4°C for up to 1 year. Store the working PBST (1×) buffer at room temperature for up to 3 months.\nWash the transferred membrane 3 times at room temperature with shaking, in 20 mL PBST (1×) for 10 min per wash.\nIncubate the membrane with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG-HRP is used at 1:6000 dilution, anti-human IgG-HRP is used at 1:4000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Wash 3 times with PBST.",

When circling the bands of S, both two bands (S-180kDa and S1-100kDa) must be included.\nThe density of S bands and the density of VLP capsid proteins (N of SARS2-VLP and p24 of HIV-PVLP) in the same sample (lane) are used to calculate the density ratio (S/N or S/p24). This ratio indicates the S incorporation efficiency in VLPs or PVLPs.\nCompare the ratio of SWH and SDel and use this to monitor the quality of VLPs used for further treatment experiments.\nNote: The difference in antibody dilution, incubation/wash condition, and exposure time may affect the ratio of S/N or S/p24. This ratio is a relative parameter to monitor the S incorporation in the VLPs or PVLPs.\nQuantify the S protein amount in SARS2-VLPs and HIV-PVLPs by ELISA\nTiming: 2 days\nThe sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is performed to quantify the S protein amount in SARS2-VLPs and HIV-PVLPs by using the human SARS-CoV-2 RBD ELISA Kit (Invitrogen, # EH492RB). The protein amount of S (RBD) is calculated by the curve-fitting software (SoftMax Pro) based on the standard curve.

In the MSD 96-well plate, the first two columns (red to pink) are serially diluted standards and zero control, and each has two replicates. The next three columns are supernatant samples, and each has two replicates.\nAlternatives: Here we used HIV-PVLPs to treat hMDMs and tested the cytokine production (protein). This protocol also can be used for the SARS2-VLPs. The amount of SARS2-VLPs can be adjusted by the S levels.",
    "Note: The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the inflammatory immune response induced by S from different SARS-CoV-2 variants. MDMs are one of the contributors to this response. The contribution from other cells (Dendritic cells or lymphocytes) should also be considered. Here we used MDMs as a representative for the antigen-presentation cells (APCs). The MDMs purity at 80% or 100% will not affect the results.\nCulture the MDMs with PVLPs for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nOn Day 2, collect the supernatants and aliquot (75 μL/well) in a 96-well plate.\nIf the next step is performed immediately or the next day (Day 3), store the supernatants at 4°C.\nIf the MSD assay is performed later, store the supernatants at −80°C.\nNote: The supernatant samples should be aliquoted in arranged wells as planned for the MSD immunoassay (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). One day before the assay, take the samples out of the −80°C freezer and put them in a 4°C fridge overnight (8–18 h) to let them thaw.\nAlternatives: The supernatant can be collected at different time points (12–48 h) to investigate the production variation along with time.\nPause point: The supernatants can be frozen at −80°C for weeks (recommended less than 4 weeks) before the MSD immunoassay.\nMeasure the cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α) levels in the supernatants using the MSD V-PLEX proinflammatory Panel 1 (human) Kit (Meso Scale Discovery, USA, Cat# K15049D) following the manufacturer’s procedure. For each sample, two or three technical replicates are needed. Standards are placed on the same plate.\nNote: Here is a brief description of the MSD immunoassay. For more details, please refer to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.mesoscale.com/%7E/media/files/product%20inserts/proinflammatory%20panel%201%20human%20insert.pdf] (https://www.mesoscale.com/∼/media/files/product%20inserts/proinflammatory%20panel%201%20human%20insert.pdf[href=https://www.mesoscale.com/%7E/media/files/product%20inserts/proinflammatory%20panel%201%20human%20insert.pdf]).\nDilute supernatant samples (75 μL/well) 2-fold in Diluent 2 buffer (75 μL/well).",
    "Prepare 7 standards (calibrators) by 4× serial dilution with Diluent 2 buffer.\nWash the plate three times with wash buffer (150 μL/well).\nOptional: Washing before the sample loading is optional, but this can increase the uniformity of results.\nAdd the samples and standards to the coated 96-well plate (50 μL/well). Take two technical replicates for each sample. Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature with shaking for 2 h.\nWash the plate three times and add the detection antibodies in wells (25 μL/well). Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature with shaking for 2 h.\nWash the plate three times and add the 2× read buffer T in wells (150 μL/well).\nRead the plate with the Meso QUICKPLEX SQ 120MM. The cytokine concentrations are calculated by the analysis software (Discovery workbench 4.0) based on the standard curve.\nNote: If the MSD reads of samples are too low or higher than the highest standard concentration, see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11].\nDetermine the cytokine production (mRNA) from human MDMs treated with SARS2-VLPs\nTiming: 4 days\nHuman MDMs are treated with SARS2-VLPs harboring SWH or SDel. The mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages are measured by RT-qPCR, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10.\nSimilar to step 18. After 7 days of differentiation, the human MDMs reach the terminal state of macrophages and about 2 × 105 hMDMs in each well of the 24-well plate. Remove the supernatants and replace them with 0.5 mL of 5% FBS DMEM fresh medium.\nTreat the MDMs with SARS-VLPs.\nAdd an equal amount of each SWH-SARS2-VLPs and SDel-SARS2-VLPs (10 ng, as adjusted by the S levels) into the wells containing MDMs (similar to Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] left).\nThe non-treated well is used as a negative cell control.",
    "For each VLP and control group, treat two or three wells of MDMs as biological replicates.\nCulture the hMDMs for 20 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nAlternatives: Here, we described how to measure the cytokine mRNA levels in the SARS2-VLPs treated hMDMs. This protocol can also be used for the HIV-PVLPs treated hMDMs.\nExtraction of total RNA by using the PureLink RNA mini kit (Invitrogen).
