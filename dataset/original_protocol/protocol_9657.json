    "Femoral condyles collected from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty at the University Hospital of Tübingen, Germany, were used. Only articular cartilage samples from patients with degenerative and posttraumatic joint pathologies were included in this study. Departmental, institutional, as well as local ethical committee approval were obtained before the commencement of the study (Project no.674/2016BO2). Written informed consent was received from all patients before participation.\nNOTE: A flowchart of the experiment steps in their chronological order is given in Figure 1.\n1. Tissue processing and generation of cartilage discs\nTissue preparation\n\t\nFollowing post-operative resection, place the cartilage samples in a container filled with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin. Make sure the samples are completely submerged in the medium. The duration between surgical resection and further processing of the cartilage should not exceed 24 h. Ensure that, throughout the entire processing, the samples are fully submerged in media to avoid sample drying.\nCut the cartilage away from the bone using a scalpel.\nCartilage disc generation\n\t\nGenerate cartilage discs of 4 mm in diameter using a biopsy punch.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to select and resect the areas of the condyle where the cartilage layer thickness exceeds 1 mm. This might be problematic, especially around loadbearing zones, where the cartilage layer typically loses its thickness due to wear and tear processes or degeneration.\nPlace the previously generated 4 mm cartilage discs on a custom-made cutting device and fix and hold the cartilage discs stable by means of a spatula. When placing the cartilage discs on the cutting device, care must be taken. Position the samples so that the cartilage's topmost layer (the superficial zone of the articular cartilage) does not face the blade",
    "Cut the cartilage discs with a razor blade. Disc-shaped cartilage samples of 4 mm x 1 mm are, thus, generated. To prevent sample drying, perform tissue cutting as quickly as possible.\nCollect each disc with the help of a spatula and place the generated cartilage discs into 1.5 mL tubes containing 1 mL of DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin. Place approximately 15 discs in one tube.\nCryotome sectioning of the cartilage discs (for perpendicular slices)\n\tNOTE: This step is optional, and it can be employed if a side-view visualization of the cellular pattern distribution within the cartilage discs is desired. It can be used as a verification method as the distribution of cellular pattern is a 3D feature of articular cartilage26. Optical sectioning and 3D reconstructions of the entire cartilage discs using a confocal microscope can also be used, removing, thus, the need to section the samples as described in the protocol.\n\t\nCover the cartilage disc with water-soluble embedding medium and place it on its edge on the cryotome knob (with the surface of the disc perpendicular to the surface of the knob). In the cryotome device, the embedding medium freezes at low temperatures.\nUsing a standard cryotome, section the tissue sideways at a 60 µm thickness until the middle of the disc is reached (i.e., when cryosections reach a length of 4 mm) and collect the slices. By sectioning the disc explant perpendicularly, all zones of the cartilage (superficial, middle, and deep) can be visualized.\nCollect the sections on a glass slide and remove the water-soluble embedding medium by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n2. Cartilage disc sorting as a function of the cellular spatial pattern\nStaining of the disc-shaped cartilage samples",
    "Place one cartilage disc (section 1.2) in each well of a 96-well plate and add 130 µL of cell permeable fluorescence dye at a dilution of 1:1,000 to each well.\nVisually inspect the entire plate and make sure that only one disc is placed in each well. Incubate the plate for 30 min in the standard cell culture incubator at 37 °C.\nStaining of the 60 µm cartilage slices\n\t\nGently place the cartilage disc sections (section 1.3) on glass microscope slides with the help of forceps.\nCover the cartilage sections with mounting medium containing nuclear DAPI counterstaining and gently place coverslips that are suitable for fluorescence microscopy.\nSeal the edges of each coverslip with regular transparent nail polish and allow to dry for 3 min.\nTop-down and side-view cartilage sorting and imaging\n\tNOTE: Each disc must be examined under a fluorescent microscope. The aim of this step is to sort the discs based on their predominant cellular pattern (single strings, double strings, small clusters, big clusters, or diffuse).\n\t\nPlace the 96-well plate on the plate holder of the fluorescence microscope.\nSelect the appropriate fluorescence filter of either Em 495 nm/Ex 515 nm (for top-down imaging of the cartilage discs prepared in section 2.1.) or Em 358 nm/Ex 461 nm (for side-view imaging of the cartilage sections prepared in section 2.2) and the 10x objective.",
    "NOTE: Using the 10x objective allows the whole circumference of the disc to be inspected, and samples with inhomogeneous or improper staining can be excluded. However, using only the top-down view may result in the perception of changes in cellular organization as a result of analysis of the deeper tissue layers made visible to top-down observation by superficial erosion. As an example, an ascending string following the collagen arcades could be perceived as a single cell or scattered cells (diffuse pattern)26. As a result, both sides of the discs must be inspected to ensure proper cellular pattern selection.\nDetermine visually the cellular pattern displayed in each cartilage disc. It is unlikely that a disc will have only one type of cellular pattern. For the portion of the disc where the chondrocyte arrangement does not match the pattern of interest, only accept the samples if the undesired pattern is at the very periphery, where AFM measurements are not taking place (i.e., up to 0.5 mm from the disc border), and ensure that this does not exceed 10% of the total surface of the disc27,28.\nImage acquisition of the entire cartilage discs\n\t\nSelect the 10x objective of the microscope and position it underneath the preselected well containing an individual cartilage disc. Focus on the disc to see the cellular pattern.\nSelect the Navigator Function to get an overview of the entire well. Use the left mouse button and drag to navigate to a different stage position. With the mouse wheel, zoom in and out.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, a preview of the well with the entire sample can be seen by double-clicking on each area of interest sequentially.",
    "Select a square that encompasses the area of interest to be scanned; at this point, all single tiles that compose the mosaic will become visible.\nAdjust the exposure/light intensity so that the cells can be clearly visualized from the background. At this point, the picture's brightness/contrast has been adjusted for all the tiles and can no longer be customized individually for each tile.\n\t\tNOTE: As the cells near the disc's edge often emit a higher fluorescence signal than the cells in the center, the exposure/light intensity settings must be adapted.\n\t\t\nTo evaluate if the exposure time is appropriate for a particular channel, examine the distribution of the signal in the histogram. By using the automatic exposure mechanism included in the microscope's image software, visualize all the cells residing within the disc.\nSelect the software's Focus Map Point option, and then select each individual tile by left-clicking in the center of it.\nSelect the option Focus Map. A window is displayed with all the previously selected tiles. Double-click on a tile in the list to display and bring it into proper focus.\nClick Set Z to save the focal plan and proceed to the next tile. After adjusting the focal plan for each individual tile, begin image acquisition by pressing Start Scan.\n\t\t\nIf the scan is displaying darker horizontal and/or vertical bars, this may be due to improper and uneven illumination of the single frames. Resolve this by using the Linked Shading option incorporated in the software prior to the actual scan.\nSave, export, and correctly annotate the images.\n3. Biomechanical approach of cartilage explants\nSample preparation for AFM measurements",
    "Fix each preselected cartilage disc containing a cellular pattern (section 2) in Petri dishes by means of biocompatible glue.Add sufficient sample glue on the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the disc.\nCover the discs with 2.5 mL of Leibovitz's L-15 medium without L-glutamine. Add the Leibowitz medium gently onto the samples to avoid sample detachment from the surface due to waves created by the medium.\nLoading of the samples into the AFM\n\t\nPosition the Petri dish in the AFM device's sample holder and turn on the Petri dish heater set to 37 °C. Allow the tissue culture dish to reach the desired temperature. This is done to exclude possible artifacts caused by temperature variation.\nAFM-cantilever calibration\n\t\nInitialize the software setup as previously described by Danalache et al.29.\nSelect a suitable glass block cantilever holder for liquid measurements and carefully place it on the AFM head. A locking mechanism secures the glass block in the AFM head. Ensure that the glass block's reflective surface is straight and parallel to the AFM holder.\nPlace the cantilever on the surface of the glass block cantilever holder with care. The cantilever itself should rest on the polished optical plane, in the center of the glass block.\nCarefully place a silicone skirt (silicone membrane) on the base of the cantilever holder in order to prevent medium condensation in the AFM head.\nLower the cantilever in 100 µm steps using the stepper motor function until it is completely submerged in the medium.\nRun a scanner approach with the approach parameters described by Danalache et al.29. Retract the cantilever by 100 µm once the bottom of the Petri dish is reached.",
    "Calibrate the cantilever using the exact steps and run the parameters described by Danalache et al.29. At the end of the calibration, the vertical deflection is saved and displayed in newton (N) units of force rather than volts (V)-the unit of the original registration by the photodiode detector. In the experiments here, a set point of 4.47 nN resulted after calibration.\nUsing the stepper motor function, retract the cantilever to 1,000 µm.\nIdentifying the desired cartilage measurement site under the AFM\n\tNOTE: Due to the 1 mm thickness of the cartilage discs, the cantilever is not visible in the field of view while navigating over the sample.\n\t\nUse the CCD camera of the microscope to identify the cantilever. The AFM cantilever should be positioned in a sample-free area of the Petri dish.\nStart a scanner approach with the cantilever on a clean, sample-free area of the Petri dish, using the same parameters described by Danalache et al.29.\nFurther retract the cantilever 1.5 mm away from the bottom of the plate with the stepper motor control. This step is crucial in order to avoid a direct collision between the cantilever and the sample.\nSwitch from brightfield to fluorescence view and visually identify the top of the disc.\nMove the AFM sample holder exactly 2 mm toward the middle of the disc. This point is considered to be the center of the cartilage disc.\nRun a scanner approach and, once the surface of the cartilage disc is reached, retract the cantilever by 100 µm.\nForce-distance curve measurements\n\t\nFocus on the cells positioned in the desired measurement site. Click the Run button to start the measurements and the generation of force-distance curves in the targeted position.",
    "Acquire five force-distance curves on each measurement site. Retract the cantilever by 500 µm and move the cantilever to the next measuring site.\n\t\tNOTE: The retraction of the cantilever is a crucial step, as the cartilage disc surface is not homogenous and has irregularities. A high hillock on the surface of the sample can result in a dramatic collision, leading to unwanted cantilever tip/sample damage. We recommend selecting a minimum of five different measurement sites dispersed across the surface of the disc and acquiring a minimum of five force-distance curves at each site.\nInspect the force-distance curves and save them.\nEstimation of Young's moduli using the Hertz fit model\n\t\nOpen the generated force-distance curves to be analyzed (.jpk file) in the data analysis software using the Open a Batch of Spectroscopy Curves option.\nSelect the Hertz fit model and then select the Elasticity fit option.\n\t\t\nThe elasticity fit option automatically performs the following computations on the selected force-distance curve: calculates the baseline and subtracts from the whole curve to remove the baseline offset (the baseline is brought back to zero on the y-axis); determines the contact point by detecting the point where the force-distance curve crosses the zero force-line (the contact point is set to zero on the x-axis); calculates the tip-sample separation (the height signal of the piezo accounting for the bending of the cantilever is subtracted); and fits the force-distance curve automatically with the selected model. If desired, each of these steps can also be carried out independently.\nAdapt using the following fit parameters: Poisson ratio of 0.5 and the appropriate cantilever tip radius.",
    "NOTE: When using a cantilever with a spherical cantilever tip, the Hertz fit model should be used. The cantilever used in this study had a spherical tip with a radius of 5 µm. We recommend fitting the force-distance curve until the maximum applied force is reached (setpoint).\nCheck visually the force-distance curve fit to ensure correctness. This step has to be done for each of the force-distance curves analyzed.\nIndentation depth determination\n\tNOTE: Depending on the data analysis tool being used, this process may differ. The experimenter can easily read the indentation depth by following a series of steps that are included in the data analysis program.\n\t\nOpen each of the generated force-distance curves in the data analysis software and select the Hertz fit Model as the analysis process.\nApply the Subtract Baseline Offset option to zero the vertical deflection axis (y-axis) and select the Offset + Tilt function.\nUse the Find Contact Point function to automatically identify the contact point, which is automatically brought to an x-coordinate of zero.\nSubtract the distance accounting solely for cantilever deflection from the raw piezo height during the indentation using the Vertical Tip Position function.\nSelect the Elasticity Fit option to display the processed force-distance curve and select the area of the graph so that it lines up with the most negative value on the Vertical Tip Position Axis (x-axis).\nRead and document the indentation from the X Min box in the parameter tab. Save and document the results.\n4. Statistical analysis\nOpen the statistical software. Select New Dataset from the drop-down menu.\nOpen the Variable View tab after selecting the DataSet file. Define the numerical variables for each cellular pattern category: single strings = SS, double strings = DS, small clusters = SC, big clusters = BC, diffuse and the Young's moduli.",
    "In the data view tab, enter the measured Young's moduli data for each of the corresponding cellular pattern categories. Analyze the data distribution by selecting Analyze from the menu bar, and then Exploratory Data Analysis.\nSelect Young's Moduli as the dependent variable and Cellular Pattern as the factor list. A box plot used for the results section is displayed among the results in the output file.\nTo conduct a statistical analysis, choose Dependent Samples in the nonparametric test section of the analyze menu bar tab. Select Young's Moduli as Test Fields and Cellular Pattern as Groups under the fields tab. Press Run.\n\tNOTE: The results are displayed in the output file. For the statistical analysis, a Friedman test is performed.\nIncorporate the nonparametric test's p-values into the box plot that was created in step 4.4. Save the results by clicking File in the menu bar and selecting Save.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
