    "The protocol was reviewed and granted exempt status by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research.\nThe RPAC protocol involves preparation, facilitated group work (session 1), interim analysis, facilitated group work (session 2) and summary analysis. Suggested roles and time allocation are noted in parentheses for each major section of the session descriptions below. Suggested scripts for each step are shown in quotations. Direct questions to participants are in bold. Follow-up question probes to promote further discussion are in italics.\n1. Preparation for Session 1\nIdentify and form the research team, including collaboration with community-based organizations (CBO) serving the women at high socio-demographic risk for preterm birth [or other CBO serving the under-represented community experiencing a significant health disparity of interest]. The research team should include members of the under-represented community in all aspects of the research, including analysis, presentation and publication. Community based participatory research principles and methods4 are prominent within the RPAC protocol and it is recommended to have expertise on the project team or access to consultation.\nReview the RPAC protocol, participant recruitment materials and interview guides for the two sessions with the CBO partners and make any amendments to reflect the local context.\nObtain Institutional Review Board approval or exemption as required by responsible institution.",
    "Identify roles: a) CBO staff member liaison; b) Session facilitator(s) and project staff member supporting project preparation and in-session support. One or two facilitators (two facilitators recommended) can lead the session. The same person(s) should lead both session 1 and session 2. Facilitators should have previous experience of group facilitation, ideally with the community from which the participants will be recruited, and familiarity with the health condition of interest. We recommend that at least one of the facilitators have some affiliation with the community of interest, for example, having experienced the condition or a member of the under-represented community. Facilitators must refrain from providing their own opinions about the topic or slipping into a teaching or counselling role during the sessions.\n\t\nJointly plan the logistics, including: recruitment, scheduling the two 2-hour sessions 4-to-6 weeks apart, room configuration, session supplies (Table of Materials - Session 1[href=https://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56220/Table_of_Materials-Session_1.pdf]), food, child care and participant travel and reimbursement.\nArrange for audio-recording of the sessions and transcription services so that transcripts are available within 7-10 days of session 1.\nConduct participant recruitment (CBO staff member), by telephone or in-person. Invite women who are pregnant and at high socio-demographic risk for preterm birth, or who have had a preterm baby, to participate in the two-part sessions. Groups can be a mix of pregnant and non-pregnant women. Invite 10-to-12 participants to ensure attendance of 6-to-10 participants.",
    "CBO staff member invites participants using suggested script (to be modified for local context): \"We're partnering with [Insert your organization] to identify uncertainties or unanswered questions about the causes, prevention, treatment and outcomes of preterm birth. A preterm birth occurs when babies are born too soon, before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm birth is associated with numerous adverse infant outcomes, affects quality of life for the entire family and has a large cost to healthcare systems and society. Researchers should investigate questions that are important to people who might be affected by preterm birth, but we don't know very much yet about the views of women in communities at high risk for preterm birth. Our goal is to bring the views of women and families to prioritize the unanswered questions about preterm birth that need more research. This information will help ensure that those who fund health research are aware of what matters to women and families. To do this, we are going to be holding a series of two focus groups, each lasting two hours on [date] and [date] at [location] from [time] to [time] to identify unanswered questions about preterm birth that women think need to be answered by research. I am contacting you to see if you would be interested in joining other women who participate in our programs to share your views on this topic with us. If you participate, you will receive [insert information about participant reimbursement, transportation, child care, refreshments]. I also want to let you know the sessions will be audio-recorded and transcribed to a written record that we can review and summarize to share with researchers, research funders and the public. No names or identifying information will be included in any reports about this work. Would you be interested in participating?",
    "Do you have any questions? [if not interested in participating, ask about their concerns, see if they can be addressed, and if not, thank them for their interest].",
    "Several days prior to scheduled session, confirm attendance of 6-to-10 participants (CBO staff member); arrange for session materials (Table of Materials[href=https://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56220/Table_of_Materials.pdf]) (Facilitator).\n2. Session 1 Generating Research Questions - Group Facilitator Guide\nGreet participants on arrival. Provide name tags and take care of required documentation (e.g. participant reimbursement, photo consents), child care, etc.\nLead the group in an exercise intended to bring their attention to the present moment in preparation to focus on the task at hand. This can be an exercise commonly used by the CBO partner or a simple guided meditation as described here (CBO staff member; 5 minutes).\n\t\nCBO staff member leads group opening exercise: \"Hello and thank you for participating in this important group. Prior to beginning, we would ask all cell phones be placed on mute and that you fully bring yourself to this space. We will begin with some cleansing deep breaths where you inhale, hold for 3 seconds and exhale. Place all of your belongings under your seat and place your palms on your lap or knees, whichever is more comfortable. You may close your eyes if you wish. Now become aware of your breath and slowly, over a count of four, inhale in and exhale (repeat three times). Each time you exhale, let go of whatever is going on outside of this room. As you breathe in, become more aware of what is going on in your body and in the present moment in this room. Now, breathe normally, open your eyes if they were closed, and focus your attention on the discussion we are about to have together.\"\nWelcome and thank participants for coming and introduce the session (CBO staff member and Facilitator; 10 minutes).",
    "Introduce the session (CBO staff member): \"We are [insert role] from [insert organization] are here to listen and learn from you. We invited you to come here today because we are very interested in hearing your ideas and opinions about what research should be done to prevent or treat preterm birth. Government agencies, private foundations, universities and companies all give money to fund research with the goal of improving health. We are committed to partnering with communities that are affected to shape the research that is done to reduce preterm birth in [city or region]. Capturing what is important to the community to know, and learning about your lived experiences, will help us to conduct research that will ultimately protect future generations of this community's children. Researchers want and need to partner with communities to understand and address the underlying causes of preterm birth and together figure out what to do about it. We are grateful to be here today to do this work with you. We will start with asking you to each go around the room and introduce yourself and tell us why you were interested in coming here today. Now let's review the ground rules for this session. Babies Rule! If you need to attend to your child, please do and rejoin when you can. One person should speak at a time, for the recording and to hear all views. Let others finish talking before speaking. Confidentiality is important throughout this process so that you all feel comfortable to talk freely. What is said here should not be repeated elsewhere. Also, please remember that your participation today is completely voluntary and you may stop or refrain at any time from participating in answering any question or participating in the discussion.",
    "Invite participants to suggest other ground rules and then asks participants if they have any questions (CBO staff member). Once questions have been answered, ask participants' permission to turn on the recorder and begin the session (the CBO staff liaison).\nContinue with session description (Facilitator): \"Today's conversation is the first of two discussions we'll have together. In today's group, we'll focus on identifying unanswered questions about why babies are born early and how best to care for them and their families - topics or questions that you think need to be answered by research. We'll come back together in about 6 weeks for the second session to rank these topics and questions according to what you think are most important or should be done first.\nExplore participants' views about research (Facilitator; 15 minutes, approximately).",
    "Introduce the topic of clinical research and its relevance to an individual's health (Facilitator): \"Research is something that most people do not think about on a daily basis but it is something that touches all of our lives and directly affects our healthcare. Researchers are just catching on that it is important to ask individuals and communities what questions or uncertainties about their own health or healthcare should be researched. For example: If you had asthma, you might want to know: Are breathing exercises more helpful in controlling asthma than medication? And if you were to look this up on the Internet or to ask your health care provider, you would find that the answer really isn't known. You might feel strongly that money should be put toward finding out the answer to this question. But a drug company might want to lobby the government to spend more money on drug research instead. So, our goal is to make sure that your voice is heard by the research funders and researchers, not just those who would get paid to do the research or profit from the research. Please introduce yourself, and share your views about research. Have you participated in research projects? Do you know anyone who has participated in a research project? If yes, what was it like? If no, what do you think is involved? What are your thoughts about whether or not research affects your health and well-being or that of other people?\" What are your thoughts about how answering questions about preterm birth through research might or might not help women who are pregnant/want to become pregnant?\nExplore participants' questions and uncertainties about pregnancy and childbirth (Facilitator; 25 minutes, approximately).",
    "Introduce process for eliciting questions and uncertainties (Facilitator): \"Let's now talk about questions or uncertainties about anything related to why babies are sometimes born early. It can be easiest to come up with possible questions by remembering your conversations or consultations with health care providers before, during or after pregnancy. I'm going to ask each of you to share with us your experience and I will be listening for unanswered questions or uncertainties that you have. As you say them, we will write them on these cards and put them on the board. We will work together to get the wording just as you want it. We will not try to answer the questions today. Our goal is simply to get all of the questions you might have out onto this board. When we are done, we will talk about what we will do with them in our next session. Let's get started. What things did you want to know that your health care provider couldn't answer for you? What things did you wonder about after talking with family or friends or after reading about them? Can you describe the experience(s) seeking health care during your pregnancy that stands out in your mind? What would you change about this experience? What would you do differently? What would you have wanted that you didn't receive? Do you have any unanswered questions about pregnancy?\"\nAsk further questions if there is limited discussion in response to above. Script: \"To help you, here are some examples of unanswered questions about other health problems: What is the evidence for gargling with aspirin to relieve a sore throat? Which medications are the most effective and have the least side effects after an operation? Can you think of a question about pregnancy or childbirth?\"",
    "Explore participants' questions and uncertainties about preterm birth and care of preterm babies (Facilitator; 40 minutes, approximately).\n\tNOTE: if questions about preterm birth emerge in the earlier discussion, continue on. Periodic refocusing on discussion of questions about preterm birth or care of preterm babies may be needed.\n\t\nDirect participants to focus on questions and uncertainties about preterm birth (Facilitator): \"Now let's talk more specifically about when babies are born early. Do you have any unanswered questions or an uncertainty about the causes and prevention of preterm birth? What about treatment of babies and support for families?\"\n\t\tNOTE: If after several attempts with examples generated from above or from other conditions, the group is not able to generate questions or uncertainties related to preterm birth, then read a few of the examples from the JLA preterm birth research priorities list generated from parents, charities and front-line clinicians.19\nWhile conducting steps 2.4 to 2.6, ask clarifying questions as needed to encourage deeper discussion and reveal underlying questions or uncertainties (Facilitator). Examples: Can you tell me more about that? Say more about that. Do others feel this way? Could you give me an example of what you mean? What was your response? What did (specify person) say to you? Is there anything else you would like to add?\n\t \nWhile conducting steps 2.4 to 2.6, observe participants to see that all are participating and redirect conversations back to the topic as needed (Facilitator). Examples: Wait until dominant participant pauses to inhale and redirect the conversation as follows: \"Thank you, XXX, for your comments. We can see that you've had a lot of experience with XYZ and we appreciate your point of view. Now, it's important that we hear from the rest of the group. YYY, what do you think about XYZ?\"",
    "Bring closure to the discussion and explain next steps. (Facilitator; 15 minutes, approximately).\n\t\nReview the list of posted questions. \"Is this an accurate summary of our conversation? The goals of our discussion today were to identify what research means to each of you and to develop a list of possible questions that you think need to be investigated to improve healthcare for pregnant women and babies and to prevent or improve outcomes from preterm birth. You have certainly achieved these goals. Is there anything we missed? There are some very important questions here that if we had answers to them would really improve how pregnant women are cared for during pregnancy and childbirth and also could prevent early birth and improve outcomes for early born babies and their families. Thank you. If you think of additional questions after you leave today, please note them down to share in session 2, or share them with [CBO staff liaison or facilitator, as agreed by prior arrangement]. Are there any parting thoughts or comments?\"\nInvite participants to give closing remarks focused on gratitude (Facilitator). \"We would like to close this session in the spirit of gratitude and hope. \"In a few words, can each of you describe something you are grateful for about today's session and how you hope this work we are doing together will help you or other women and babies.\" Invite participants to come to the wall and take a photo of them standing next to all the questions they generated.\n3. Session 1 analysis\nMembers of the research team: Transcribe all of the potentially researchable questions that were written on the cards by the paticipants during the session into an electronic document.",
    "Obtain session 1 transcript from the audiorecording. Review the transcript and the audiorecording multiple times to identify additional questions that were not written on the cards and add these to the electronic potentially researchable questions document generated in step 3.1.\nRemove any questions for which there are definitive answers from systematic reviews or professional guidelines or regulations. Label a new document with these questions as \"Research questions with answers\" and set aside for later dissemination.\nConduct a thematic analysis20 of the potentially researchable question document to organize the questions under main topic themes. Prepare new cards with these questions and topic headings (one per card, at least 40 size font) to be used in session 2.\n4. Preparation for session 2\nContact CBO partner well in advance and confirm timing, logistics and staffing for session 2.\n\t\nContact participants and confirm their attendance at session 2, making any necessary transportation and childcare arrangements (CBO staff member).\nArrange for session materials (Table of Materials - Session 2[href=https://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56220/Table_of_Materials-Session_2.pdf]) (Facilitator).\n5. Session 2 Prioritizing Research Questions and Topics - Group Facilitator Guide\nGreet participants (CBO staff member). See step 2.1 to 2.2 above.\nWelcome and thank participants for coming back and introduce the session (Facilitator; 10 minutes).",
    "Introduce session 2 (Facilitator): \"As you remember, in our first session we talked about your questions and uncertainties about pregnancy, childbirth and preterm birth that you think should to be answered by research. Here on the wall are the questions you shared last time. You generated [number] questions in two hours - that is incredible! When we listened to the audio recording, we heard [number] additional questions that we hadn't written and they are now on the wall here (point to new questions). What you don't see here, are the [number] questions you raised last time for which there is strong research evidence. We will share those later with you and [CBO partner] so that more women can learn this information. Our focus today is to prioritize the large list of unanswered questions that you generated so that research funders and researchers know what questions are most important to women.\n\t\tToday's focus group will occur in two phases. First, we will review the list of questions to make sure we got the wording right, that they truly captured what you said, and to merge or move any of them. You will notice that we created some topic headings and grouped the questions and we want to check in with you to see what you think about the way that we have grouped and labeled your questions. Since we last met, or in this review process, you may have other questions and we will add those questions to cards and put them on the wall. In the second phase of today's session, we will ask you to work individually and then together to select the most important questions and topics and put the top 10 to 15 in order from most to least importance. Does anyone have any questions?",
    "Review and amend research question list and topic headings (Facilitator; 20 minutes)\n\t\nProvide each participant with a paper copy of the list. Read each topic heading and question out loud. Pause every few questions and at each topic heading and ask participants if they agree with the wording, believe the question to be important and, if not, to make any edits. Intermittentlyask if the discussion so far has caused them to think of or remember any other questions they have. If so, write them on a card and ask participants to place it under the appropriate topic heading (or ask participants to create a new topic heading, as appropriate).\nConduct round 1 of prioritization (Facilitator; 10 minutes)\n\t\nAsk participants to individually mark the top 15 questions on their question list.\nAsk participants to take their 15 sticky dots and go up to the wall and put a dot onto each card corresponding to one of their top 15 questions.\nConduct topic ranking and removal of lower priority questions (CBO staff member and Facilitator; 10 minutes).\n\t\nWhile participants are performing the prior step, lay out a second set of topic headings on the tables (CBO staff member).\nOnce participants return to their seats, engage them in placing the topic headings in order of importance (Facilitator). Ask prompting questions such as: Do you think this topic is more or less important than that topic? Should this topic be nearer the bottom or nearer the top of the list? Once all of the topics have been placed in order of importance, confirm that there is consensus. If any disagreements, continue the discussion, with prompting questions to uncover reasons for the differences in priority and to promote reaching a final consensus.",
    "Concurrent to the above activity, remove all of the questions from the board that do not have dots placed on them by the participants and set these aside (CBO staff member).\nConduct round 2 of prioritization with group voting on the top 10 to 15 most important research questions (Facilitator; 10 to 15 minutes).\n\t\nAsk participants to return to the wall and take their new 5 dots and put them on the cards with the questions they feel are most important. Point out that they are to use a different technique when deciding this time what questions are most important. They may put all of their dots on one question if they choose. They may talk with each other and lobby each other.\nOnce participants have placed all of their dots and returned to their seats, remove the questions with the fewest number of dots from both rounds and set these aside, leaving the top 5 to 15 questions. There may be an obvious breakpoint in the number of dots separating the question clusters, or there may not. If not, further work will be needed to engage the group in deciding where the breakpoint is so that only 5 to 15 questions remain on the board.\nRank order the top priority questions (Facilitator; 5 to 10 minutes).\n\t\nStand at the wall and move questions up or down in the order list based on the participants' responses. This is similar to the table exercise to rank order the topic headings. Ask prompting questions as needed (see 6.2.2).\nOnce the final order of the questions is agreed, add in the topic headings where appropriate.",
    "NOTE: Some topic headings may have no questions under them. Review the list with the participants, prompting them to notice what is there and what is not. Emphasize that although this list of topics and questions on the wall represents their most pressing questions at this time, the many other questions that they generated are still important and will be shared with researchers and funders. Ask participants to share any names of research organizations or funders they particularly would like the project team to inform about the research priorities.\nTake a photo of the wall. Invite participants to come up and take a photo of the participants standing next to the questions (CBO staff member).\nDebrief about the experience of participating in the sessions and closing (CBO staff member and facilitator; 10 minutes).\n\t\nAsk participants to provide feedback on the experience of participating in these sessions. Ask participants to elaborate on what worked well, and what they wish there was more or less of. Discuss how the results from this work will be summarized and shared with participants and presented to CBO partners, researchers and funders, and to the local community. Ask if participants would be interested in participating in these dissemination activities and/or in future collaboration with researchers.\nFacilitator invites participants to give closing remarks focused on gratitude: \"We would like to close this session in the spirit of gratitude and hope. \"We invite you to describe in a few words something you are grateful for about today's session and how you hope this work we are doing together will help you or other women and babies.\"\n6. Synthesis",
    "Obtain session 2 transcript from the audiorecording. Review the transcript and the audiorecording multiple times to identify additional questions that were not written on the cards. Amend the question document from session 1 with the additional questions written on cards in session 2 or from the session 2 transcript and audiorecording.\nPrepare a document with the top priority topics and questions from session 2.\nUse the top priority topics and question document and the complete question document in research priority setting and funding decisions and to influence local, national and international research priority setting for preterm birth.\nNOTES: a) The protocol steps for sessions 1 and 2 can be repeated within and across geographic regions. If this is done, then additional thematic analysis can be done to merge the question list and to explore similarities or differences in priority topics and questions across groups with similar or differing sociodemographic characteristics; b) Over the course of the two sessions, rich qualitative data about the participants' health and healthcare experiences will be generated in the discussion. These data are audiorecorded and transcribed along with the research questions and topics. These data may be subjected to qualitative analysis, using thematic analysis or another framework."
