    "Cell preparationExpression of GFP-Tagged proteins to label cell-cell junctions could be achieved by endogenously tagging a gene of interest using genome editing tools like CRISPR, virus transduction (see Priya and Gomez, 2013) or transient transfection of a plasmid encoding a junctional protein fused to GFP using Lipofectamine 3000 as it is described below (See Appendix I[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161212/20161212232416_8020.docx]). Note: The overexpression of plasmids should not cause any gain of function and/or alter cell’s physiology (i.e., abrupt changes in morphology).Plating and transfection of cells with E-cadherin-GFP constructs For ablation experiments, MCF-7 cells are cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and transfected with a plasmid encoding E-cadherin-GFP.Cells are incubated at 37 °C in DMEM + 10% FBS and when these are ~80% confluent harvested by trypsinization. Single-cell suspensions are seeded on glass bottom dishes at 75% confluence and allowed to grow for 24 h for transfection with plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000.On the day of transfection, medium of cells is changed to Opti-MEM (1 ml) in the absence of serum and antibiotics and transfection performed as described in Appendix I[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161212/20161212232416_8020.docx].24 to 48 h after transfection, and once cells are 90 to 100% confluent, cells were washed and incubated in the presence of imaging media for microscopy analysis. Figure 1 shows a representative image of the morphology of cells before ablation using 60x magnification.Note: The imaging media is used as it does not have phenol red, which can interfere with live cell imaging by increasing the fluorescence background. This leads to the use of higher laser power for imaging and the production of reactive species that might result toxic for cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161214/20161214235502_8392.jpgFigure 1.

Image acquisitionNotes:For the use of multiphoton lasers read carefully the Safety considerations associate to its use (Appendix IV[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161202/20161202024255_9869.",
    "docx])For recoil measurements, please ensure analyze cells with consistent level of expression of the E-cadherin-GFP construct. Ideally overexpression levels should be kept at minimal to prevent overexpression artifacts (see also Appendix I[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161212/20161212232416_8020.docx]) and being compatible with live cell imaging. Once identified the target cells, acquire time-lapse images of GFP fluorescence in a region of interest of 270 x 270 pixels, 0.1860119 μm/pixel (at 4x digital zoom, 0.8 μm optical section) before (2 frames) and after (5 frames, or until no more changes in junctional length are observed, ~1 min). Images are acquired with a time interval of 8 sec for a total time of 44 sec using a 488 nm laser line of an argon laser (30 mW) at 1-3% transmission (Figures 2A and 2B; Supplementary Video 1[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212626_2273.docx]; Appendix II[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161202/20161202024212_0416.docx]). Note: This region of interest is sufficient to acquire a single cell-cell junction to analyze its changes in length after ablation without the need of acquiring the entire field of view (512 x 512 pixels, Figure 2A) that would slow down the speed at which junctional recoil can be monitored.A constant region of interest of 2.8 x 1.7 μm with the longer axis parallel to the cell-cell contact (Figure 2A) was marked for ablation using 30 iterations of the Chameleon laser set at 790 nm with 40% transmission (See Supplementary Video 1[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212626_2273.docx] and Appendix II[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161202/20161202024212_0416.docx]). This resulted in efficient ablation without significant cell damage (Figure 2B, see also Supplementary Video 2[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212644_8538.docx] for a case where cell damage is significant).Note: For quantifications and statistical analysis this acquisition procedure is repeated between 15 and 25 times per condition per experiment in at least 3 independent experiments (See also Figure 14).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161214/20161214234702_5299.jpgFigure 2.

Slices of movie stills of a laser ablation experiment to measure tension on cell-cell junctions. Yellow lines: the original positions of vertices before laser ablation; Red lines: the real-time positions of vertices; Arrowhead: the site of ablation.Optimization of laser power and iterations for the ablation step (see Appendix V[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161212/20161212232428_4552.docx]).Note: This optimization should be done using the cell line of interest expressing the preferred junctional marker in sufficient amount for efficient detection using a laser confocal microscope and perform time lapse imaging. If the marker is overexpressed, the experimentalist should try to express it at minimal levels enough for imaging and avoid any gain of function effect due to overexpression.To set up this optimization step, it is imperative to start with cells that have tension on their junctions, as a successful ablation would lead to observable elongation of the junction, i.e., recoil of the vertices that define it (Supplementary Videos 1[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212626_2273.docx], 2[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212644_8538.docx] and 4[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212713_7138.docx]). In practice, perform initial tests with ablation settings using a high number of iterations (> 20 and increase more if necessary) and high laser power (~70% and increase more if necessary). Under these harsh conditions, significant cell damage should be observed, which will show that laser power of the infrared laser is effective and it is properly collimated (See also Appendix III[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161202/20161202024221_3548.docx], Supplementary Video 3[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212659_5958.docx]).Once this laser power and iterations have been attained, then these parameters could be reduced stepwise until recoil of junctions is observed but with much less cell damage. While keeping constant iterations (~10-20) the laser could be reduced until a level where no more recoil is observed, but bleaching of fluorescence occurs instead.",
    "These tests would help to identify the minimal laser power needed for an efficient ablation protocol.Once this is achieved, it is possible to obtain settings in which damage to the cell membrane is minimal. This could be done by doing additional controls ablating a junction (labeled with apical junctional marker) between a cell that expresses cytoplasmic mCherry and a cell that does not. Under these conditions, it should be possible to perform ablation experiments in which observable recoil is observed but no significant flow of mCherry fluorescence from one cell to another is observed (see Supplementary Videos 2[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212644_8538.docx] and 3[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20161130/20161130212659_5958.docx]).Moreover, acquisition of a DIC image together with GFP fluorescence images allow for checking that laser power is not too high to cause damage."
