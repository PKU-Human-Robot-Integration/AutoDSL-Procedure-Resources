    "Sample sectioning and fixationFemoral neck and head samples are sourced from patients who have undergone hip replacement surgery.Cut the femoral head into three sections from proximal end to distal end with the precision cutter.Cut the medial and lateral portions into three pieces transversely across the bone with the precision cutter.Section tissue, with the saw microtome, into 1 mm thick section along the plane of interest, e.g., coronal or sagittal plane, to allow for infiltration of fixation and embedding chemicals.Fix the sectioned tissue immediately after with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer at room temperature for 5 days.Note: Tissue must be fully submerged in solution.  Wash sample with cacodylate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.3) daily for 5 days.Note: Samples can be stored in cacodylate buffer for up to 2 weeks.DehydrationDehydrate the sample in an ethanol series (30%, 50%, 75%, 95%) for 3 days each, changing daily.Place the sample in absolute ethanol for 3 days, changing daily.Embedding and polymerizationFill glass container with polymer.Insert specimen with section side of interest facing down.Cover with foil and place in explosion-proof refrigerator for 48 h.Periodically remove from refrigerator, checking orientation.Allow container to remain at room temperature (25 °C) until polymerization occurs (3-7 days). Once polymerization extends slightly above the specimen, check hardness with a teasing needle then place into a 60 °C incubator overnight to complete polymerization.Place specimen in plastic bag and strike the glass with a mallet to shatter it.Carefully remove block and rinse under running H2O.Trim excess plastic from block with bandsaw.Note: Embedded samples can be stored indefinitely before progressing to the following stages.Surface preparationNote: Choose option Step D1 if precision-CNC milling is available. Choose option Step D2 if precision CNC milling is not possible or semi-automatic and hand polishing is preferred.",
    "Precision CNC-milling of bulk embedded samplesFix the sample onto a CNC-lathe.Mill to require depth using a carbide insert without a honed edged facing the sample surface.Gently polish the sample surface with a soft microfiber cloth, acrylic polish and ultra-pure H2O.Flow ultra-pure H2O over the sample to clear of all polish and residue.Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a lint free wipe.Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen).Manual grinding and polishingMount the 500-grit polishing disc on the polishing wheel.Start the polishing wheel at 200 rpm and place the surface face down with even pressure.Gradually resurface the sample using the 500-grit then lift from the wheel.Place the sample in a beaker of H2O and into an ultrasonic cleaner.Stop the wheel and then mount the 1,200-grit polishing disc.Start the polishing wheel at 200 rpm and place the surface face down with even pressure.Gradually resurface the sample using the 1,200-grit then lift from the wheel.Place the sample in a beaker of H2O and into an ultrasonic cleaner.Stop the wheel and mount the MD-Dac polishing pad and apply a small amount of 3 μm diamond suspension.Turn the polishing wheel to 200 rpm and spread the suspension across the polishing pad.Press the sample face down with even pressure and gently polish then lift from the wheel.Place the sample in a beaker of H2O and into an ultrasonic cleaner.Stop the wheel and mount the MD-Nap polishing pad and apply a small amount of 1 μm diamond suspension.Turn the polishing wheel to 200 rpm and spread the suspension across the polishing pad.Press the sample face down with even pressure and gently polish then lift from the wheel.Place the sample in a beaker of H2O and into an ultrasonic cleaner.",
    "Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a lint free wipe.Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen).Chemical etchingMount the sample onto the specimen holder, fixing it in place using silver paint (alternately carbon or copper tape may be used).Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a lint free wipe.Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen).Define edges of etched zone and protect areas unetched surfaces by covering with masking medium, leaving a large margin, i.e., electrical tape and/or finger nail polish.Pipette off 2 ml of HCl solution and place on the surface of the sample that is to be etched.Gently expose entire surface of etch area to solution using a cotton swab for 60 s.Rinse with copious ultrapure H2O and blot dry with dust-free wipes.Pipette off 2 ml of HCl solution and place on the surface of the sample that is to be etched.Gently expose entire surface of etch area to solution using a cotton swab for 25 s.Rinse with copious ultrapure H2O and blot dry with dust-free wipes.To remove flaked off organic material, pipette off 2 ml of NaClO and place on the surface of the sample that is to be etched.Gently expose entire surface of etch area to solution using a cotton swab for 60 s.Rinse with copious ultrapure H2O and blot dry with absorbent, lint free wipes.Gently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a lint free wipe and if electrical tape has been removed, making sure to remove any adhesive residue.Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen).",
    "Place in a protective specimen storage box to prevent exposure to elements or dust prior to carbon sputtering and SEM imaging.Note: Samples can remain in storage indefinitely before proceeding to the following methods.Preparation of sample for imagingGently clean the sample with absolute ethanol and a dust-free wipe.Ensure the sample is thoroughly dry and free of dust by placing it under a steady stream of inert gas (nitrogen).Carbon-coat the sample with a 20 nm thick layer of film.Mount the specimen to the stage or metal stub using silver paint (alternately, carbon or copper tape can be used), ensuring an unbroken and robust connection is made between the sample surface and sample holder.Place the sample under vacuum in preparation for imaging in accordance to your electron microscopy system."
