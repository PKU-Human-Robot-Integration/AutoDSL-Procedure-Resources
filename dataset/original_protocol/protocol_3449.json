    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of EVPs from cell culture\nTiming: 3.5–4 h (time increases with number of samples)\nPerform serial centrifugation and ultracentrifugation steps to isolate EVPs from conditioned cell culture media.\nHarvest culture media and remove cells, debris, apoptotic bodies, and contaminants through serial centrifugation.\nCentrifuge sample at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet cells and debris.\nCollect the supernatant without disturbing the cell/debris pellet. This can be done by quickly pouring off the supernatant into a new container/tube or carefully pipetting off the supernatant. It is essential to work as quickly as possible during these steps, as the pellet will become dislodged over time.\nNote: For this and all subsequent steps, supernatants and re-suspended EVP pellets should be kept on ice between isolation steps.\nNote: A step of 3,000 × g centrifugation for 20 min at 4°C should be added for cell culture supernatants before short-term storage (<24 h) at 4°C or before freezing to remove additional cell debris contaminants. This step has to be performed if further analysis of the post-12,000 × g microvesicle sample is planned.\nPause Point: Conditioned media supernatants can be stored at −80°C for long-term storage or at 4 °C for short-term (<24 h) storage before ultracentrifugation. Minor differences have been observed between EVPs isolated from fresh versus frozen samples in terms of yield and purity. However, frozen samples are often used to allow for retrospective studies, collaborative studies between different institutions and batch processing of test samples/subjects and controls.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to remove apoptotic bodies and aggregates and larger vesicles that could otherwise be co-isolated with EVPs and “contaminate” the EVP preparation.",
    "Note: This step can be performed in the ultracentrifuge or tabletop centrifuge depending on volume and availability of the ultracentrifuge. We recommend performing the 12,000 × g spin right before ultracentrifugation since contaminating material could develop by freeze-thaw cycles or extended storage times.\nCollect supernatant without disturbing the pellet and transfer to new/clean ultracentrifuge tube by pipetting, leaving a small volume behind to avoid contamination from pellet.\nCritical: Wash newly purchased ultracentrifugation tubes with soap and water and rinse them extensively in ddH2O before the first EVP isolation, since the factory coating on the inside of the tube will prevent the EVP pellet from adhering to the tube. After use, the tubes should be washed extensively and sterilized by autoclaving if required. Cleaning of ultracentrifugation tubes was performed as per standard cleaning procedure for laboratory glassware and utensils used for molecular and cellular biology applications. We extensively wash the tubes in soap and hot water while scrubbing with a brush. The tubes are then thoroughly rinsed with tap water to remove any traces of soap, followed by additional rinses in ddH2O. If EVPs are isolated for in vitro or in vivo work rather than molecular biology, the tubes can be autoclaved, this however shortens the life of the tubes. No contamination between samples has ever been observed using these procedures. The tube used depends on the volume of starting material rather than the type of specimen.\nNote: It is important to avoid disturbing the pellet with the pipette tip in these centrifugation steps since the aim is to remove pelleted contamination; instead, leave a minimal amount of media above the pellet to avoid dissociating the pellet. Remember to work as quickly as possible during these steps as the pellet will become dislodged over time.\nIsolate EVPs by ultracentrifugation",
    "Centrifuge supernatant at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 10°C in a fixed-angle rotor in a Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to collect EVPs.\nCritical: It is very important to accurately balance the tubes in the ultracentrifuge. An unbalanced rotor can cause spillage, contamination, run failure, or even damage the rotor/ultracentrifuge.\nNote: Before inserting tubes into the rotor, we recommend marking an area on the bottom of the tube where the pellet is expected to form, since it may not be easily visible. Avoid disturbing the pelleted area when discarding the supernatant and pay careful attention to it for successful retrieval of your EVP pellet (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/336-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Careful handling of the EVP pellet\n(A) After ultracentrifugation, carefully decant supernatant and (B and C) re-suspend the pellet in a small volume of PBS (0.5–1 mL depending on tube size) by pipetting and flushing the marked area of the lower side of the ultracentrifugation tube. Avoid generating bubbles.\nDiscard the supernatant by decanting or carefully pipetting without disturbing the pellet. If pipetting off the supernatant, keep the tip of the pipet on the side of the tube opposite from the pellet. If decanting the supernatant, be sure to pour the supernatant off the side of the tube opposite the pellet and use one quick, careful motion to invert the tube.\nOptional: Store supernatant if interested in EVP-depleted media for measurement of other secreted factors, such as cytokines.",
    "Note: In this and subsequent steps it is important to work quickly and remove the supernatant as fast as possible after the ultracentrifuge has stopped to prevent dissociation of the pellet. After removing the supernatant, leave the pellet untouched and place the inverted tube in a rack for 1–3 min to avoid backflow of liquid. This ensures minimal carryover of contaminants and prevents dissociation of the pellet. Remove drops of liquid from tube walls by vacuum aspiration or using a Kimwipe, if necessary. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nTo wash the pellet, re-suspend it in 500 μL of cold PBS by pipetting and flushing the marked area at the bottom of the ultracentrifugation tube. Ensure the pellet is re-suspended well so contaminants trapped in the pellet (free, abundant proteins) are washed away. Transfer the re-suspended pellet to a new ultracentrifuge tube and add 3 mL (tube #355645), 20 mL (tube #355631) or 44 mL (tube #355628) of cold PBS. We recommend using the same size tube throughout the protocol (i.e., depending on starting volume) since the starting volume affects the yield. Thus, small volumes, 1–3 mL should be spun in a small tube where these fewer EVPs can more readily be collected and concentrated. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCentrifuge the re-suspended pellet at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 10°C to collect the washed EVP pellet.\nDiscard the PBS supernatant by decanting and remove all liquid by gently tapping the inverted tube to avoid backflow.\nRe-suspend the EVP pellet in 100 μL (see note for range below) of cold PBS and store at −80°C. Reserve 10 μL aliquots for downstream quantification and characterization, such as protein quantification, NTA, and EM, to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.",
    "Note: The final re-suspension volume can be adjusted to create an appropriate concentration. As low as 50 μL or up to 500 μL can be used for high yields depending on the total EVP yield. Because cell lines vary in their EVP production, we recommend that users empirically establish their own EVP yield for each cell type. Final concentrations will depend on downstream applications but should be above the lower limit of detection of the BCA assay or other assay for protein quantification. If desired, the EVP pellet can be re-suspended directly in cell lysis buffer for downstream RNA or protein applications.\nOptional: After thawing of stored EVP samples and before downstream applications, depending on the type of downstream analysis, an additional centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C can be performed to remove potential aggregates/precipitates formed during storage.\nIsolation of EVPs from tissue samples\nTiming: 2 days",
    "This section describes culture of dissected tissue explants and serial centrifugation steps to isolate EVPs from conditioned media. Fresh human tumor tissues and peritumoral adjacent tissues were obtained from patients surgically treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Yonsei Cancer Center (YCC). The ages of patients ranged from 3 to 88 years old. All individuals or legal guardians provided informed consent for tissue donation according to protocols approved by the institutional review board of MSKCC, WCM, and YCC (IRB 11-033A, 16-774, 16-1514, and 15-015, MSKCC; IRB 0604008488, WCM; IRB 4-2019-0811, YCC). The study is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations regarding research involving human participants. All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AAALAS) guidelines (Weill Cornell Medicine animal protocol 0709-666A). Six to eight weeks old wild-type C57BL/6 or BALB/c female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.\nCollect the tumor tissue and adjacent tissue in ice-cold PBS at the time of surgery and transfer them on ice to the class II biosafety cabinet within 30 min.\nOptional: Tissue weight can be used to normalize the EVP yield. Work quickly or in PBS to avoid drying out tissue and decreasing EVP yield.\nNote: Viability will vary between tissue explant cultures depending on a number of factors, such as surgical approach, time to culture, and tissue composition. Viability can be assessed using suitable methods such as manual cell counting and trypan blue exclusion, automatic cell counting with dead cell discrimination dyes or flow cytometry with annexin V or propidium iodide. The process of making single cell suspensions can also affect the viability. We have compared our dissected tissue explants to whole tissue explants and found similar, slightly enhanced, viability in the dissected cultures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/336-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Comparison of cell viability between whole tissue versus tissue dissected into smaller pieces\n(A) Nanosight (NTA) profiles and protein concentration by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay for human colon that was cultured as whole tissue or dissected into smaller pieces.\n(B) Immunoblotting of lysates (20 μg of proteins) from baseline tissue (directly after collection, timepoint 0 h) immediately placed into lysing buffer without culturing, whole tissue, and dissected tissue (after 12 h culture) derived from the human colon. PARP antibody (#9542, Cell Signaling Technology [CST]), cleaved caspase-3 antibody (#9661S, CST), GAPDH antibody (#2118S, CST) were used for immunoblotting.\n(C) Comparison of human colon whole tissue and dissected tissue cell viability as determined by dual Acridine Orange / Propidium Iodide fluorescence and brightfield optics, using the LUNA automated cell counter. Live cells are green and dead cells are red.\n(D) Comparison of human colon whole tissue and dissected tissue cell viability by apoptotic flow staining shows similar viability between baseline tissue directly after collection and whole and dissected tissues after 12 h tissue explant culture.\n(E) Comparison of cell viability between baseline and 24 h cultures of mouse lung tissue explant.\n(F) Cell viability, as determined by flow cytometry with LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain, shows increased viability in dissected tissue cultures compared to whole tissue culture from mice.\nWash tissues in cold PBS × 3 and quickly cut the tissues into 2 mm3-sized pieces. Rinse tissue pieces again in PBS before plating if needed to remove debris and/or blood.\nNote: Heterogeneous tumor and adjacent tissues might require dissection of specific areas of interest, such as removal of adipose tissue, tumor and dissection of specific structures (i.e. tumor margin), and thus, trained personnel is required.",
    "Place tissue pieces in a 6-well plate (<10 pieces) or a 10-cm dish (10–15 pieces).\nCritical: It is important to limit the number of dissected tissues per dish to no more than 15 pieces, which will minimize loss of tissue viability.\nIf possible, allow tissue pieces to adhere to the plastic dishes for a few minutes before adding media. Pipet media slowly against the side of the dish to avoid disturbing the tissue pieces. Ensure enough media is added to cover the tissue pieces and try to minimize detachment from the plate.\nNote: After initial media collection, consider adding EVP-depleted FBS and other essential growth factors to culture media if establishing long-term viable cultures is desired. Alternatively, organoids can be generated from the fresh tissue and EVPs can be continuously collected from these organoid cultures.\nCarefully transfer plates to 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nNote: Keep in a separate incubator reserved for ex vivo work, away from routine mycoplasma-free cell cultures, if feasible.\nAfter 16–18 h, carefully collect culture media without disturbing tissue explants, especially if continuous culturing is planned. Keep the collected media on ice.\nCentrifuge explant culture media according to the centrifugation steps described above for EVP isolation from cell cultures.\nCentrifuge the culture media at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant to a new tube.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant to a new tube.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, in either a tabletop centrifuge or in the ultracentrifuge, depending on volume.",
    "Critical: Given the complex nature of tissue samples and the presence of significant debris compared to cell lines, always perform all three pre-ultracentrifugation steps (500 × g, 3,000 × g, and 12,000 × g) mentioned above to remove insoluble material. Additional filtrations and purification steps can be added as described below.\nIsolate EVPs by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 10°C.\nOptional: If further purification of a tissue sample EVP pellet is desired, re-suspend the EVP pellet in 2.5 mL of PBS and slowly overlay onto a 0.5 mL sucrose/deuterium oxide cushion layer by tilting the tube to 45°; then centrifuge at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 10°C (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Aspirate the lower fraction using an 18 G needle and 3 mL syringe. Ensure not to disturb the layers or eventual pellet and collect a volume similar to the amount of sucrose/deuterium oxide mixture added (0.5 mL here). Note: the amount of sucrose/deuterium oxide mixture will depend on the volume of the sample/ultracentrifugation tube size used and should be used in a ratio of 1:5 sucrose/D2O:EVP/PBS suspension (Lamparski et. al, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The end user will need to confirm that sucrose density-cushion purified EVPs retain their functional characteristics. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/336-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Ultracentrifugation of tissue sample EVPs over a sucrose/deuterium oxide density layer\n(A) EVPs re-suspended in PBS could be further purified by overlaying onto a sucrose/deuterium oxide cushion and centrifuging at 100,000 × g, resulting in a lower EVP-enriched layer that could be aspirated from the upper layer containing any potential contaminants.\n(B) Aspiration of the lower fraction using an 18G needle and 3 mL syringe.\nRe-suspend EVP pellet in 3 mL of PBS to wash and collect by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 10°C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and re-suspend collected EVP pellet in 100 μL of PBS.\nStore at −80°C. Save 10 μL aliquots for protein quantification, NTA, and EM to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nIsolation of EVPs from blood samples and other bodily fluids\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes differential centrifugation steps to isolate EVPs from whole blood or bodily fluids, such as lymphatic fluid, and bile. Human blood and bodily fluids were obtained from patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). The ages of patients ranged from 1 to 83 years old. All individuals or legal guardians provided informed consent for blood/fluid donation according to protocols approved by the institutional review board of MSKCC (IRB 11-033A, 16-774, 16-1514, and 15-015; MSKCC, IRB 0604008488, WCM). The study is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations regarding research involving human participants. All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AAALAS) guidelines (Weill Cornell Medicine animal protocol 0709-666A). Six to eight weeks old wild-type C57BL/6 or BALB/c female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.\nRemove cells, debris, apoptotic bodies, and other contaminants by serial centrifugation steps.\nCentrifuge the EDTA tube containing the blood at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The blood will separate into a lower layer containing red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) and an upper layer of plasma",
    "Note: The plasma should be yellow and clear but not red, which is a sign of RBC lysis at collection that could potentially affect and contaminate the EVP preparation. Following blood collection in anti-coagulant-coated tubes, we follow the manufacturer’s protocol, and roll/invert tubes several times, to ensure the blood is mixed with the anti-coagulant, thus minimizing clotting and hemolysis. However, if visual observation of hemolysis is not sufficient and the user would like to confirm by quantitative measurement, we recommend the Nature protocol by Dr. Olivier Wever and Dr. An Hendrix using a spectrophotometer to confirm the absence of hemolysis by the lack of a spectrophotometric absorbance peak for free hemoglobin at 414 nm (Tulkens et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Additionally, the presence of large amounts of lipids, as indicated by a cloudy appearance, might indicate the failure of fasting in subjects prior to blood collection. Consider excluding such samples.\nNote: For bile samples, and other very viscous samples, such as pancreatic duct fluid, add ice-cold PBS at a ratio of 1:1 and homogenize the mixture by repeated pipetting. Follow the same isolation steps as for blood.\nCritical: It is important not to disturb the pellet after each centrifugation step. Instead, collect most of the plasma while leaving a small residual volume above the pellet. We recommend handling a maximum of 10 plasma samples at one time since additional samples will increase the delay and the risk of EVP loss.\nCollect the plasma by pipetting the top layer without touching the interphase layer and transfer into a new tube.\nCentrifuge the plasma at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. This step will remove platelets that could otherwise be co-isolated with EVPs and contaminate the EVP preparation.",
    "Note: Platelet numbers can be assessed by classic hemocytometer counting, cell counting with size exclusion or more precisely through flow cytometry of the platelet suspension stained for CD61 (platelet glycoprotein IIb, broadly expressed on resting and activated platelets).\nCollect the plasma and discard the platelet-rich pellet if not needed.\nPause Point: The plasma can be frozen at −80°C for long-term storage.\nCentrifuge the plasma at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C in either a tabletop microcentrifuge or in an ultracentrifuge.\nNote: This step will remove apoptotic bodies and larger vesicles that could otherwise be co-isolated with EVPs and contaminate the EVP preparation.\nOptional: The sample can be further processed to remove contaminants, such as lipids, by filtering the cleared post-12,000 × g plasma supernatant through a 1.2 μm membrane.\nNote: We recommend performing the 12,000 × g spin right before the ultracentrifugation steps, especially for plasma and other bodily fluids as well as tissue-derived media, since protein aggregates and precipitates could develop through freeze-thaw cycles or over extended waiting times.\nOptional: After the 12,000 × g spin, save 100 μL aliquots of cleared plasma for EVP quantification and characterization by NTA.\nIsolate EVPs by ultracentrifugation.\nTransfer the plasma supernatant to an ultracentrifuge tube (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). For plasma, we recommend the 50.4Ti rotor with the #355645 tube for volumes up to 4 mL.\nCentrifuge sample at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 10°C in a fixed angle rotor in a Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nDecant or carefully pipet off the plasma, leaving the pellet untouched; place the inverted tube in a tube rack to drain and to avoid liquid backflow. Note the volume of plasma for calculating EVP numbers and protein per milliliter plasma.",
    "Re-suspend the EVP pellet in 500 μL of ice-cold PBS and transfer to a second ultracentifuge tube.\nAdd 3.5 mL of PBS to wash the pellet.\nCentrifuge the sample at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant by decanting and ensure there is no liquid backflow onto the pellet.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 100 μL of PBS. Store at −80°C. Save aliquots for protein quantification, NTA, and EM to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nCritical: EVPs can also be isolated from serum (in a red top blood collection tube without anticoagulant, Cat#366434G) using the same procedure; however, serum EVPs and plasma EVPs are not equivalent.\nNote: The complex nature of plasma and heterogeneity between patients makes EVP isolation challenging. Additional filtering and PBS dilutions can be made but could also introduce loss or bias. Optimization protocols are being developed to decrease the inter-sample variation in EVP isolation from blood. See further discussion under “Limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]” section.\nEVP sample preparation for AF4\nTiming: 10 min\nEVPs isolated from different sources via ultracentrifugation are pre-processed for AF4 analysis.\nAdjust the protein concentration of freshly isolated or thawed frozen EVPs to 0.5–1 μg/μL with PBS.\nPre-clear the EVP suspension by centrifuging in a tabletop microcentrifuge at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min to remove large protein and nanoparticle aggregates.\nTransfer the supernatant into a pre-chilled screw cap vial. A pulled point glass vial insert can be used for samples with small volume.\nPlace the sample vial into the designated position in the pre-chilled autosampler.",
    "Critical: To achieve the best resolution and yield, we have determined empirically that 40–100 μg of EVP protein is required for EVPs isolated from conditioned media of cell culture for AF4 processing (with our instrument settings). Due to the size of the sample injection loop, which determines the maximum sample volume to be loaded, a sample concentration range of 0.4–1 μg/μL is required for AF4. However, for EVPs derived from other sources, these parameters need to be optimized empirically due to different EVP complexity.\nAF4 of EVPs and data collection\nTiming: 70 min\nEVPs are separated based on their hydrodynamic sizes via AF4, and real-time data collection is carried out for concentration and size determination.\nAstra 6 (Wyatt Technology) is used for data acquisition and analysis, including MALS, DLS, and UV signals. Open a new experiment with the current configuration of the instrument, and set parameters for data collection: MALS data collection interval is 1 s and QELS interval is 2 s; total data collection time is 60 min. Save the file and click “RUN.” Data collection automatically starts once triggered by the autosampler sample loading.\nChemstation software (Agilent Technologies) with an integrated Eclipse module (Wyatt Technology) is used to operate the AF4. First, program a new method or load the desired method from the method library. The running method we have developed and optimized for EVP separation is the following:\nForward channel flow: 1 mL/min\nElution, 2 min, Vx 0.5 mL/min;\nFocus, 1 min, Vx 0.5 mL/min;\nFocus + Injection, 2 min, Vx 0.5 mL/min, injection flow 0.2 mL/min;\nElution, 45 min, Vx a linear gradient decreasing from 0.5 to 0 mL/min;\nElution, 5 min, Vx 0 mL/min;\nElution + Injection, 5 min, Vx 0 mL/min;",
    "In Chemstation, set the input sample volume in the autosampler module (<=100 μL), and set the parameters for fraction collection in the fraction collector module. Here, we collect fractions by time slice (0.5 min/fraction).\nClick “Run a single sample.” The sample will be automatically loaded and fractionated accordingly, and data collection by Astra 6 will start once the sample loading is done.\nFractions are collected into 96-well plates based on time slice by the Agilent Fraction Collector.\nAfter all samples have been processed for the day, switch off all lasers and thermostats for both autosamplers and fraction collector. Switch on the COMET of the Dawn Heleos II detector for ~30 min to clean the flow cell. Change the buffer to water and run the Night Rinse mode ~16–18 h. For long-term storage, the system can be stored in 20% ethanol after running a large volume of water through the system.\nCritical: A blank control of the running buffer (i.e., PBS) can be run using the same running method in parallel to the EVP samples. This control can assist in evaluating instrument performance, such as the background noise level and baseline drifting.\nNote: Samples more than 100 μg or of a volume larger than 100 μL can be sequentially fractionated via AF4 using the same running method and fractions can be pooled together according to their hydrodynamic sizes.\nPause Point: Collected fraction plates can be sealed with adhesive tapes and kept on ice in 4°C for 2–3 days. However, we recommend proceeding to the next step of fraction concentration and characterization shortly after fraction collection if time allows.\nFraction concentration and characterization\nTiming: 30 min or longer (timeframe varies based on the total amount of input samples to be analyzed)",
    "The size of EVP fractions is analyzed using the Astra 6 software and fractions of similar size are pooled together for further concentration and downstream characterization.\nIn Astra 6, adjust the baseline of data collected from each monitor in the experiment just completed and save the changes.\nOpen a new window of EASI Graph in Astra 6, and plot the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of particles vs Time. Please refer to Zhang and Lyden (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] for the underlying principle of hydrodynamic radius determination and fractionation efficiency evaluation using the Autocorrelation function. Both QELS and UV absorbance are displayed on a relative scale to illustrate the relative abundance of each subpopulation in the sample. A single peak or multiple peak regions can be selected for analysis simultaneously.\nOptional: Representative individual fractions can be first concentrated as described in steps 34–36 and a small aliquot can be subjected to negative staining TEM analysis for quick morphology examination.\nGuided by the particle size, abundance, and morphology, adjacent fractions with similar properties are then pooled together into 50 mL Falcon tubes and placed on ice.\nPre-wet the Millipore centrifugal filter columns with Ultracel-30 membrane (30 kDa cutoff) with cold PBS (fill to full) and spin in tabletop clinical centrifuge at 3,700 × g at 4°C for 5 min. Discard the residual liquid in the filter unit and flow-through in the collection tube and place the filter column back into the collection tube.\nTransfer the pooled fractions into the filter column (top part) and spin at 3,700 × g at 4°C for 7–8 min. Discard the flow-through but keep the samples retained in upper chamber of the filter column (the concentrated sample).\nRepeat step 34 until each pooled set is concentrated to the desired volume using a single filter column.",
    "Mix the concentrated samples gently and transfer to Eppendorf tubes on ice. For better recovery, an additional volume of PBS can be added to rinse the filter column and combined with the sample.\nRecord the volume of the final product and remove an aliquot for BCA assay and/or NTA analysis to determine the protein concentration and/or particle concentration. A small aliquot (~1 μg) can be saved to verify particle integrity and morphology by TEM.\nUse the EVP subsets immediately for downstream analysis or keep on ice for short-term storage. Aliquots can be kept frozen at −80°C for long-term storage.\nCritical: For EVP samples from a specific type of source material that has never been analyzed previously by AF4, it is critical to examine the morphology of EVPs present in representative individual fractions by TEM first, before pooling fractions together for further processing and analysis. NTA analysis is not applicable for exomeres, which, due to their size, are below the detection limit of NTA technology (minimum size detected is 50 nm).\nNote: An alternative approach to concentrate a large volume of pooled fractions is ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 10°C for 70 min. The pelleted EVP subsets can then be re-suspended in the desired volume of PBS or other types of solution as required by downstream analysis.\nNote: This AF4 fractionation protocol is developed and optimized for EVPs isolated via dUC method from conditioned media of cell culture. For complex samples, such as plasma-derived EVPs, further preparation of samples prior to AF4 fractionation may be required."
