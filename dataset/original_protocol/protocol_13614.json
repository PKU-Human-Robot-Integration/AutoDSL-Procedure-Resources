    "This study was conducted with the approval of the Research Ethics Committee (Institutional Review Board) of The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) (No. 2022085) and the Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (Shenzhen, China) (No. KY-2022-006-01).\n1. Preoperative preparation\nPut the patient on 3 h of preoperative fasting for fluid and 6 h fasting for solid food.\nAdminister general anesthesia via tracheal intubation.\nAdminister prophylactic antibiotics with second-generation cephalosporins 30 min before surgery.\n2. Gastroscopic exploration\nAfter administering general anesthesia, perform gastroscopy on the patient with CO2 insufflation.\nNext, aspirate the residual gastric fluid, and confirm the location of the tumor.\nAfter the exploration, completely aspirate the CO2 and fluid in the stomach and the fluid and mucus in the esophagus and throat.\n\tNOTE: In this hospital, GI surgeons perform gastroscopy.\n3. Laparoscopic exploration\nPlace the patient in a supine position with legs open. Have the surgeon stand to the left, the assistant to the right, and the camera holder between the patient's legs.\nUse a four-trocar method with two 10 mm and two 5 mm trocars, and apply a CO2 pressure of 10 to 12 mmHg.\nFirst, confirm the location and boundary of the tumor in the stomach with the help of gastroscopy, if necessary. Then, perform a wide intraabdominal exploration to exclude any other lesions.\n4. Laparoscopic tumor resection guided by gastroscopy\nDissect the omentum tissue around the mass. Ensure the dissection plane is just above the muscle to avoid vagal trunk injury.\nResect the mass en bloc with a 5 mm visual negative margin.\nAfter resection, place the specimen in the gastric cavity through the gastric wall defect.\n\t​NOTE: Before resection, it is recommended to make a 4-0 absorbable seromuscular suture ~5 mm from the tumor margin to facilitate retraction during the resection.",
    "5. Laparoscopic closure of the gastric wall defect\nFirst, perform a full-thickness running suture with an absorbable 3-0 V-lock suture to close the defect in the gastric wall.\nThen, perform a seromuscular running suture with the same 3-0 V-lock suture to strengthen the closure.\n6. Stomach wound check\nAfter laparoscopic closure, conduct a leakage test using a combination of laparoscopy and gastroscopy.\nLaparoscopically check if there are any bubbles coming out of the wound after flushing with water.\nCheck if there is wound bleeding, whether the suture is satisfactory, and whether the gastric cavity has been deformed by the gastroscopy.\n7. Oral specimen harvest\nPull the specimen out through the mouth using an endoscopic basket.\n\t​NOTE: If the tumor size is more than 3 cm, temporary deflation of the intubation tube sac may be necessary.\n8. Specimen management\nAfter the procedure, check the specimen visually to confirm the margin status.\nThen, immerse the specimen in a neutral 10% formalin solution.\n\tNOTE: Slice the tumor every 1 cm if the tumor is more than 2 cm in size to ensure full fixation."
