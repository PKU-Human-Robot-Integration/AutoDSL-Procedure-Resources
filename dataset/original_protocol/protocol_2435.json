    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nInduction of Anesthesia\nTiming: 3 min\nHere we describe the method for induction and maintenance of anesthesia of the pregnant dam.\nWeigh the mouse to define the amount of analgesic to administer pre- and post-surgery.\nPrepare the analgesic buprenorphine (Buprecare®): 0.03 mg/mL dilution to administer 0.1 mg/kg.\nNote: once the action of the analgesic is over (buprenorphine is effective for 8–12 h), assess post-operative pain by scoring pain behaviors (i.e., by using Grimace Scale; Langford et al. 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and evaluate re-administration of analgesic, in accordance with local and national directives.\nSedate the pregnant dam in an induction chamber where a mixture of 96% air and 4% isoflurane circulates.\nNote: monitor the breathing rate to assess the state of sedation, which takes approximately 60 s.\nQuickly, to prevent hypothermia, transfer the mouse on the heating pad with the abdomen facing down; apply ophthalmic lubricant (Fucithalmic Vet® 5 mg/g) to both eyes to prevent corneal drying, and inject the analgesic subcutaneously within the loose skin over the interscapular area.\nWith the abdomen facing up, place the nose of mouse inside the mask respirator and adjust the concentration of isoflurane vaporized to 2%.\nCritical: given the inter-individual variability in response to anesthesia, anesthesia depth should be closely monitored to prevent insufficient sedation or respiratory/cardiac depression. Parameters that can be clinically monitored are: 1) toe pinch response; 2) respiration rate (approximately 1 breath/s under optimal anesthesia); under too deep or too light anesthesia, flow rate of anesthetic should be adjusted to reach optimal anesthesia depth.\nIn Utero Cortical Electroporation and Post-op Care\nTiming: ~20–25 min; should not exceed 30 min, to ensure optimal viability",
    "The in utero electroporation technique consists of the injection of plasmid DNAs into the lateral ventricles of mouse brain embryos and their subsequent incorporation into the apical progenitors lining the ventricle surface by electroporation. By targeting the neuronal progenitors with reporter constructs, it is possible to trace the different steps of development of the derived cortical neurons.\nShave the abdomen wall with a depilatory cream and disinfect with 70% alcoholic solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/207-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation for Surgery\n(A) Incision area. Shave the abdomen of the pregnant dam kept under anesthesia and disinfect the skin with an alcoholic solution.\n(B) Skin incision. Cover the incision area with a surgical drape and incise the skin and peritoneum along the abdomen midline.\nMake an incision of approximately 1.5 cm along the skin abdomen midline first, and peritoneum afterwards (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPlace a surgical field with a rhomboidal aperture over the abdomen and wet the drape and the open abdomen cavity with warm saline.\nNote: we suggest to hydrate the drape with warm sterile saline to favor the subsequent step of the procedure, as it would prevent the uterine horns pulled out of the abdomen cavity from attaching to the drape. Make sure to not soak the drape excessively, to avoid mouse hypothermia.\nBy using ring forceps, carefully pull the uterus out from the abdominal cavity by holding it at the gaps between embryos; expose one of the two uterine horns on the surgical drape and, when necessary, apply warm sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to prevent drying of the embryos during the whole surgical procedure (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/207-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Microinjection of E14.5 Embryos",
    "(A) Exposition of the uterine horns. Pull uterus horns out the abdomen cavity by holding it at the gaps between embryos and expose the uterine horns. Keep the uterus hydrated with warm sterile PBS during the entire procedure.\n(B–E) Embryos microinjection. (B) Cut diagonally the tip of a previously pulled microcapillary to enable an optimal ejection of the plasmid solution. (C–E) Inject the plasmid solution into one of the lateral ventricles of the embryo (yellow dotted line in E).\nGently, hold an embryo with ring forceps or your fingers while inserting the microcapillary through the uterus into the lateral ventricle and inject the DNA plasmid mix (approximately 0.5 μL) by using a mouth-controlled tube or a microinjector activated via the foot pedal. The green dye filling the ventricles indicates the success of the injection. To reduce the lethality rate, a given embryo should not be injected more than two times (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B–3E).\nCritical: make an oblique cut of the microcapillary with optimal width (see also the Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section). This is a critical factor for the success of the electroporation. Microcapillaries shortened sub-optimally could compromise the integrity of the perforated tissues as well as lead to undesired dispersion of the plasmid solution from the injected to the other interconnected ventricles. The tip of the capillary can be cut progressively, to identify the minimal cut which enables the ejection of 0.1–0.2 μL droplets of plasmid solution.\nCritical: If the fast green is observed in other regions than the ventricles or cannot be released from the microcapillary, change the position of the microcapillary by slowly pulling it back until the fast green can be injected and observed in the ventricle.",
    "Place the anode on the injection site and the cathode on the opposite side of the brain, and deliver the electrical impulses by pressing the foot pedal of the electroporator; the correct delivery of the electric impulses is indicated by the formation of bubbles around the electrodes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/207-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. In Utero Electroporation of E14.5 Embryos\nHold the injected embryo with ring forceps to stabilize its position while placing the electrodes over the target site for electroporation.\nNote: electroporation at E14.5 was chosen for axonal transport recordings to target a sparse population of upper layer II-IV neurons, enabling the visualization of isolated fluorescent callosal projections.\nNote: in order to target the callosal projection neurons, the electroporation is performed by placing the anode at 45° with respect to the intra-hemispherical plane.\nCritical: warm PBS should be made available during the entire procedure, to keep embryos and electrodes wet.\nOnce the plasmid injection and the electroporation have been performed on the remaining embryos, hydrate the uterine horn and, gently, slide it back into the abdomen cavity; repeat the same procedure on the second uterine horn.\nSuture abdomen wall and skin; transfer the mouse from the operating table to a cage placed under a warming light and containing paper towel to monitor eventual bleeding. Monitor the mouse closely until recovery from anesthesia.\nCritical: skin and muscle layer should be sutured separately: this measure would prevent damage of the underneath muscle suture and potentially lethal bleeding if the mouse would bite and remove the external skin suture.",
    "After surgery, monitor and document the mouse well-being on a scoring sheet with daily observations by checking and evaluating the surgical wound, outer appearance, and spontaneous behavior. If properly performed, laparotomy for in utero electroporation is likely to not correlate with post-surgery symptoms of discomfort or pain.\nDissection and Embedding of P2 Brains\nTiming: 30 min\nBrain dissection of electroporated pups is performed at postnatal day two (P2), a stage at which the electroporated callosal projection neurons have crossed the interhemispheric midline. In order to provide mechanical support prior to slicing, dissected brains are embedded into an agarose matrix.\nDecapitate the P2 pup with surgical scissors, carefully dissect out the full brain including olfactory bulbs, forebrain, and hindbrain as elsewhere described (Beaudoin et al. 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), and collect into a petri dish containing ice-cold HBSS.\nNote: we recommend to dissect and perform the protocol described below on one pup at a time, given the strict time window of some of the steps and the importance of their timing for a successful execution of the protocol.\nNote: If a reporter plasmid was electroporated, dissected brains can be checked for fluorescence under a binocular microscope equipped with fluorescent illumination.\nPlace embedding molds on ice and pour the 4% agarose solution that was previously brought to 37°C\nNote: we generally prefer petri-dishes over conventional embedding molds as their larger diameter facilitates the brain rotation within the polymerizing agarose solution and its orientation in the position of interest.\nQuickly, remove the excess HBSS and transfer the brain into the agarose solution; with the forceps, rotate the brain gently and repeatedly while agarose polymerizes, until steady in the final position with the olfactory bulbs facing upwards and the coronal axis parallel to the mold bottom on an ice bucket.",
    "Critical: a gentle and repeated rotation of the brain within the agarose solution is important to remove the HBSS at the interface between the brain and the agarose solution; this precaution would prevent the detachment of the brain slice from the surrounding agarose layer while being sliced from the agarose block.\nCritical: orienting the brain within the agarose solution undergoing polymerization would simplify the downstream manipulation of the agarose block; By positioning the brain with the sectioning plane parallel to the mold bottom, the bottom side of the agarose block would not require further cutting adjustment and could be directly glued on the vibratome tray platform.\nLet the agarose block solidify on ice for about 15 min.\nSlicing and Mounting of Cortical Slices\nTiming: 20 min\nOrganotypic brain slices are generated and mounted on coated glass-bottom dishes, to be used for recordings of axonal transport along the projections of callosal neurons.\nSet the vibratome: fill the vibratome tray with cold HBSS and the vibratome bath with ice; adjust the sectioning parameters as follows (adjusted for a vibratome Leica VT100S): section thickness: 300 μm; cutting speed: 3; cutting frequency: 3.\nCoat the glass-bottom dish with a thin layer of culture medium containing Matrigel, by adding with a pipette 1 mL solution and aspiring back most of the volume, leaving a thin pellicle; keep it at RT (below the polymerizing temperature of 37°C).",
    "Once the agarose block is polymerized, shape it around the brain by making a cut at the rostral and ventral sides of the brain, parallel to each other and to the sectioning plane, at an approximate distance of 0.5 cm from the brain surface; apply the same procedure to remove the excess agarose also at the ventral and dorsal sides of the brain. We recommend cutting the block with a truncated pyramid shape making sure the olfactory bulbs of the brain face the minor base of the pyramid. This shape will provide a greater adhesion surface and will increase the stability of the agarose block glued onto the vibratome tray platform (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/207-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cortical Slices Preparation\n(A–C) Brain embedding. (A and B) Embed the brain in a 4% agarose solution ensuring the optimal positioning of the brain until agarose polymerization. Shape the agarose block to ensure a thickness of 0.5 cm from the brain surface, and glue the agarose block onto the vibratome tray platform. (C) Scheme for brain orientation within the agarose block. L.A., longitudinal axis; C.A., coronal axis.\n(D) Mounting of cortical slices. Slice the embedded brain to generate coronal slices and transfer them onto coated glass-bottom dishes.\nGlue the agarose block with the olfactory bulbs facing upwards onto the vibratome tray platform.\nFix the platform with the glued agarose block into the vibratome tray filled with cold HBSS.\nSection the agarose block to generate coronal slices and collect with a spatula the brain sections containing the callosal projections crossing the midline in a dish filled with ice-cold HBSS; check the collected slices for fluorescence and transfer onto coated MatTek dishes only the slices with the electroporated region of interest (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).",
    "Note: depending on the thickness of the agarose block, two or three sectioned slices can be placed per MatTek dish; it is very important to not overlap the edges of the agarose slices for an optimal live-imaging acquisition.\nCareful: gently manipulate the brain slices in order to avoid the separation of the brain slices from the surrounding agarose. Take care that the embedded brains stay at 4°C during the whole sectioning procedure by changing the HBSS regularly and refilling the vibratome bath with ice.\nWith a pipette, cover each section slice with a drop of culture medium containing Matrigel and place the glass-bottom dishes in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 20 min, to allow the Matrigel to polymerize and slices to recover.\nCareful: due to the short survival time of postnatal cultured organotypic brain slices (approximately 4 h), incubation times of all steps following brain dissection should be reduced to the minimum. Additionally, all steps should be performed at 4°C, by using ice-cold reagents and performing all the manipulations on ice. Altogether these measures would enable a longer recording time of axonal transport dynamics.\nTransport Recordings\nTiming: 2 h\nAfter recovery in the incubator (at least 20 min), the transport dynamics of fluorescently labeled organelles/vesicles can be recorded along the projections of callosal neurons.\nTo record axonal transport dynamics, use a 63× oil lens with a working distance of 0.14 mm and position the bottom-glass dish within a recording chamber controlled at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "Acquire time-lapse images using a confocal microscope (here, Zeiss LSM 880) for a desired capturing time at the corpus callosum midline to discriminate the directionality of the transport. As the movement of mitochondria and lysosomes relies on fast axonal transport, it is recommended to image at least three frames per second for 60 s. The number of acquisitions per second can be adapted depending on the speed of the cargos.\nNote: to locate the corpus callosum midline, we recommend to first use the 10× lens to identify the fluorescently labeled neurons in the electroporated hemisphere of the brain slice and follow the neuronal projections to the midline.\nCritical: set the microscope lasers at a power low enough to visualize the cargos for the entire acquisition time; as the neurons are sensitive to photodamage, this measure would limit the loss of fluorescent signal over time.\nCritical: given the critical survival time of the mounted brain slices, it is important to acquire the transport recording in the shortest time possible. For this, we recommend processing one brain at a time.\nOptional Step of the Protocol: Tamoxifen Injection\nTiming: 5 min\nTamoxifen is administered to activate a given Cre recombinase to temporally regulate the expression of a plasmid of interest. Tamoxifen is injected intra-peritoneally to the pregnant dam for a vertical diffusion via the blood system to the electroporated embryos, and after delivery to modulate the tamoxifen transmission to the pups via mother’s milk.",
    "To perform an IP injection, restrain the animal with the ventral abdomen facing up and the head slightly tilted downward. Insert the syringe at 4–5 mm depth into the lower right quadrant of the abdomen toward the mouse head, by keeping a 20°–30° angle to the abdominal surface; aspirate by pulling back syringe plunger to check if vital organs were punctured and, and if any fluid is aspirated inject slowly the tamoxifen solution. If aspirate is observed, withdraw and discard the needle, and gently perform the procedure again.\nCritical: injection volume should be the lowest possible (ideally less than 0.2 mL and needle size should be less than 21G). A new needle should be used for each animal, to reduce the risk of infection.\nObserve the animal to check for signs of bleedings at injection site or sign of pain or distress due to complication of injection. If complications persist 24 h after the injection, the animal is sacrificed.\nNote: misplaced intraperitoneal injections can lead to peritonitis, lacerations of abdominal organs, bleeding, or infections. All these complications are associated with pain or distress whose severity can be clinically evaluated (i.e., by using Grimace Scale; Langford et al. 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: for optimal plasmids effect at postnatal stage P2, we routinely perform injections on pregnant dams E17.5 and E18.5, and one day after delivery. Frequency and number of doses administered justify the time needed for cre-driven recombination and expression of the plasmids of interest; adaptations might be necessary depending on the timing for tissue harvesting and biological effects of the plasmid/plasmids of interest."
