    "This protocol is a broadening of a standard slide pretreatment protocol. It can be easily integrated into any FISH slide pretreatment protocol variant, encompassing a pepsin and formaldehyde step. The main point of the protocol is the inclusion of an initial formaldehyde treatment before the standard pepsin followed by formaldehyde pretreatment. Interestingly, formaldehyde fixation does not impair the capability of pepsin to remove superfluous proteins.\nMaterials\nDAPI (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, #124653), 1 mg/100 ml pure water (Ampuwa, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Hersfeld, Germany, #06605508)\nFormaldehyde (37%, Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany, #818708), 3 ml in 97 ml PBS/MgCl2\nFISH probe (SHOX, CytoCell, Cambridge, UK, #LPU 025)\nGlass slides (76 × 26 mm) (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA, #MENZAB00000102E012)\nPBS/MgCl2 (190 ml 1× PBS, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany, # L1825, and 10 ml of 1 M MgCI2, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, #2189.2)\nPepsin solution (50 µl of 10% pepsin, Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany, # P7012, in 100 ml distilled water with 1 ml of 1 M HCI, Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany, #1090571000)\nPatient sample (Cytogenetic preparation of blood or amnion cells in Carnoy's fixative, 3:1 methanol/acetic acid, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, # CAS 67-56-1 and #64-19-7)\n2× SSC solution (from 20× SSC, GIBCO BRL, Karlsruhe, Germany, #15557-036, in distilled water)\nCoplin jar (100 ml)\nFume hood with efficient ventilation\nPhase-contrast microscope (Zeiss or equivalent)\nMicropipettes (e.g., Eppendorf 200 and 20 µl)\n1. Put clean glass slide(s) into a Coplin jar with purified water. Place in the refrigerator at 4°C.\n2. Place suspension with interphases and metaphases on a slide using a 20-µl micropipette and let air dry for at least 1 hr. Let slide(s) dry overnight at room temperature for best results.\nThe amount of suspension to be placed on the slide depends on the density of the suspension. It may vary between 5 and 15 µl.",
    "3. Transfer glass slide(s) into the formaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature.\nSteps 3 and 4 must be performed under the fume hood. The solution must be in a Coplin jar to accommodate a few slides (30 ml) or up to 10 slides (100 ml).\n4. Rinse the slide(s) in 2× SSC solution for 5 min in a Coplin jar at room temperature.\nDiscard this fluid after use as special waste contaminated with formaldehyde.\n5. Transfer the slide(s) to freshly made pepsin solution for 3 min at 37°C in a Coplin jar.\n6. Rinse slide(s) in PBS/MgCl2 at room temperature for 5 min.\n7. Transfer slide(s) into formaldehyde solution again for 10 min at room temperature.\nThe solution can be the same used in step 3. Discard this fluid after use as special waste contaminated with formaldehyde.\n8. Rinse the slide(s) in PBS/Mg2 for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard this fluid after use as special waste contaminated with formaldehyde.\n9. Immerse slide(s) in 70% ethanol for 5 min; then remove slides and place in 90% ethanol for 5 min, followed by 100% ethanol for 5 min, all at room temperature.\n10. Air-dry the slides for 20 min and store them at −20° or use them immediately in FISH.\nSlide quality can also be checked under phase contrast. We recommended performing this step when establishing the protocol in a new laboratory."
