  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The following protocol provides instructions on how to analyze actomyosin at the local cellular and the tissue scale in Drosophila egg chambers. The local-scale approach allows users to analyze detailed actomyosin behavior in up to 15 cells per egg chamber and requires the acquisition of TLMs for a short period of time (5–10 min) by using high-speed imaging and an inverted confocal microscope. In contrast, the tissue scale provides users with actomyosin information in 50–100 cells and requires the acquisition of TLMs for a long period of time (≥30 min) by using low-speed imaging and an inverted spinning disc microscope (see Figure 2 and recommended parameters at each scale in Table 1). The decision at which scale to analyze actomyosin signals entirely depends on the user’s scientific question. Accompanied test TLMs should help to make this decision.\n1. Local Cellular Scale (LCS)\nNOTE: To dissect and image in vitro cultured Drosophila egg chambers, follow the protocol described in Supplementary File 1. To analyze acquired TLMs, continue with the following protocol. Links to accompanying test files of TLMs are provided in the Supplementary File 3.\nData processing of TLMs at the local cellular scale (LCS)\nBleach correction of TLMs to compensate for intensity decay of fluorescent labels\n\t\t\nMake sure an up-to-date Fiji application is installed on the computer being used by following these instructions: Fiji > Open a TLM (e.g., TestMovie1.tif from the Supplementary File 3).\nSplit the color channels by clicking Image > Color > Split Channels.\nPerform a bleach correction on both channels using Image > Adjust > Bleach Correction > Simple Ratio > Background Intensity 0.0.\nNOTE: If unsatisfactory results are obtained, explore which correction methods in this plugin fits best (e.g., use Histogram Matching instead of a Simple Ratio).",
    "Cell segmentation to generate a cell mask for TLMs\n\t\t\nIf Fiji is not already open, reopen it (and make sure it is up-to-date) following Help > Update > Apply Changes > OK.\nIf this has not already been done, download the macro TissueCellSegmentMovie.ijm (from http://adm.irbbarcelona.org/matlab/TissueCellSegmentMovie.ijm). Drag and drop this script into Fiji.\nOpen the bleach-corrected TLM .tiff file (see section 1.1.1). Split the channels of the bleach-corrected file using Image > Color > Split Channels.\nRun the uploaded script on the active cell membrane channel of the selected TLM by pressing the icon Run in the open script. Set the Gaussian blur to 2.500 and the cell detection sensitivity to -1 and click OK. In order to get a nice cell mask, do not change these parameters above. Set the estimated noise tolerance between 10–20 for TLMs acquired with the 63x objective and click OK.\nNOTE: For other objectives, different parameters may be required. The cleaner the background in a TLM, the lower Estimated noise tolerance is required.\nA generated cell mask appears in the analyzed TLM and also in a new window called ParticleStack (G), and in addition, a little window called Action Required appears. From the cell mask on the TLM, focus only on cells in the center of the TLM and select those that can provide complete and well-defined outlines throughout the TLM.\nIf selected cells contain artificial/extra cell outlines, use the merge tool window called Action Required in the TLM. For the latter, follow the instructions in the window.",
    "NOTE: Make sure that cell outlines are well-defined and correspond to real cell membranes in a TLM as any imprecision may impact subsequent analyses. Additional tweaks and changes, such as the removal of unwanted cells, can be done later using the Surface manager tool (described in section 1.1.3).\nWhen the selected cells in the center nicely correspond to the real cell membranes, save ParticleStack as a .tiff file following File > Save As > Tiff.\nLoading of the generated cell mask into Surface manager\n\t\t\nInstall Surface Manager Plugin15 into the used Fiji setup. Follow the instructions by Viktorinova et al.16.\nOpen Surface Manager using Plugins > Segmentation > Surface manager(3D).\nNOTE: The Surface manager window displays several action buttons on the right and an empty window on the left. To see all action buttons, it may be required to stretch the window in its height/width. Note that time frames will appear as z-slices.\nOpen the corresponding ParticleStack .tiff file into Surface Manager by clicking File > Open and select the image to open (e.g., ParticlesStack1.tif).\nIn Surface Manager, click the Read outline image button and set the Jacquard index to 60%.\nNOTE: Loading the ParticlesStack1.tif file can take up to several minutes, depending on the computer’s processing power.\nOnce loaded, each cell will be assigned with an S number and appear in the left part of the Surface manager window.\nNOTE: To show outlines and cell names for all cells, tick the Show all and Show labels checkboxes at the bottom of the Surface manager window. It is recommended to use this function once the cell numbers have been checked for their correctness.",
    "Click on the first S number; the imported cell outline from ParticlesStack1.tif appears on the TLM. Check each imported S number for cell outline quality throughout the TLM and remove unwanted cells that display incorrect cell outlines. To do so, highlight the cell outline and click on the button Delete.\nNOTE: It is also possible to correct for imprecise cell outlines and add new cell outlines. This is described in the discussion section.\nSave all corrected cells as a RoiSet.zip file by pressing the Save to disk button.\nNOTE: If the session needs to be interrupted, it is possible to load the RoiSet file into Surface manager later: open a TLM in Fiji (File > Open) and select a TLM. Open Surface manager via Plugins > Segmentation > Surface manager(3D). Load the corresponding RoiSet.zip file by clicking the Load from disc button and choosing the appropriate RoiSet.zip file. Double-check that the loaded cell masks correspond to the loaded TLM.\nCorrection for tissue drift in TLMs\nNOTE: During TLMs’ acquisition time, drift effects may be observed due to epithelial rotation or an unwanted movement. In both cases, we recommend correcting for any drift in order to simplify the manual actomyosin analysis later. Drift correction is required only for the manual actomyosin analysis. This tutorial requires up-to-date Fiji software with the MultiStackReg Plugin (https://git.mpi-cbg.de/scicomp/viktorinova_et_al_actomyosin_dynamics/blob/master/Software/Software_installation.md#multistackreg) installed.\n\t\t\nOpen the bleach-corrected TLM in Fiji via File > Open and select the bleach-corrected file created using the tutorial mentioned above.\nSplit the channels and select the one that identifies the cell membranes via Image > Color > Split Channels.",
    "Use the following protocol when the cell outlines are not visibly smooth: Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur. Set it to ~1–2 for a 63x objective and click OK and then Yes. Click Process > Binary > Convert to Mask using the default settings; then, click OK.\nLoad the MultiStackReg Plugin following Plugins > Registration > MultiStackReg.\nMake sure Stack 1 is set to the cell membrane channel, Action 1 is set to Align, and Transformation is set to Translation. Check the Save Transformation File checkbox and then click OK.\nReopen the selected TLM, the MultiStackReg Plugin, and the saved transformation file using File > Open and select a TLM. Split the color channels using Image > Color > Split channels.\nLoad the MultiStackReg Plugin by clicking Plugins > Registration > MultiStackReg. Select Load Transformation File as Action 1.\nLeave Transformation as Rigid Body and click OK. Select the previously saved Transformation File and click OK again.\nMerge the image channels and save the registered TLM as a .tiff file following Image > Color > Merge channels. Save the file by clicking File > Save As > Tiff.\nNOTE: There are alternative ways to correct for a tissue drift in Fiji, namely via Plugins > Registration > StackReg/Correct 3D drift.\nAnalysis of actomyosin pulses in Surface manager at LCS\nNOTE: This protocol step allows scientists to identify whether actomyosin pulses are present in the analyzed tissue and to understand the detailed behavior as well as the directionality of actomyosin signals.\n\t\nOpen Fiji and ensure that a TLM and its corresponding cell mask is open in Surface manager.\nNOTE: Ensure Fiji is installed and up-to-date and the Surface Manager Plugin is installed (step 1.1.3.1).",
    "Open a TLM with File > Open and select a TLM to open (e.g., TestMovie1_bleach.tif). Load the Surface manager Plugin via Plugins > Segmentation > Surface manager(3D). Load the saved cell mask created in the tutorial here (e.g., ParticlesStack1.tif) via File > Open and select a cell mask (e.g., ParticlesStack1.tif). Load the corresponding region of interest (ROI, e.g., TestMovie1_RoiSet.zip). See Figure 3A.\nSwitch to the channel of interest in the selected TLM.\nNOTE: To distinguish the channels, follow the color code indicated around the TLM.\nIn Surface Manager, click the Statistics button to obtain the window called Average grey value Slice by Slice (Figure 3B). Note that the mean/median intensity values of actomyosin signals in a given analyzed channel within the defined cell outlines over time will be displayed, as well as other parameters related to the cell area and cell shape.\nNOTE: The intensity values are in arbitraty units (A.U.); the cell area is in pixels and needs to be converted into square micrometers.\nSave the obtained values as a spreadsheet file. Click on the Statistics window, File > Save As.\nNOTE: It is possible to verify obtained statistical values later as follows: open the bleach-corrected TLM in Fiji and open Surface manager. Load the corresponding RoiSet.zip to the TLM by pressing the Load from disk button and open the file. The saved mask with cell outlines will be uploaded and the names of the cells will appear in the left Surface manager window. Click the Statistics button for statistical values.\nManual analysis of individual subcellular actomyosin signals at LCS\nNOTE: This protocol requires the most concentration and is time-consuming. In general, one acquired TLM can be comfortably analyzed within 1 day. This does not include time for fly preparation before their dissection, the dissection itself, and image acquisition.",
    "Open a selected, bleach-corrected and registered (drift-corrected) TLM in an up-to-date Fiji application. Use a bleach-corrected and drift-corrected TLM (e.g., TestMovie1_bleach_reg.tif) as a test example.\nAdjust the brightness and contrast to see the individual actomyosin signals using Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast.\nAlign TLMs in the same direction relative to the tissue/body axis. In the case of egg chambers, align the anterior side of the egg chambers always to the left of the image/submovie/TLM before the analysis.\nDivide the selected movie into short 30 s submovies and time-project each of them. Save nontime-projected and time-projected submovies with corresponding names. Keep the original source.\nNOTE: Submovies can be created from original TLMs by first deleting unwanted frames via Image > Stacks > Slice Remover. Define the slices to be removed and set Increment. Transform to RGB before using the slice remover when Increment = 1. To time-project a 30 s submovie, click Image > Stacks > Z-project > Max Intensity for the defined frames (slices) and then click OK. Skip every second 30 s submovie in order to avoid counting actomyosin signals 2x in two subsequent 30 s submovies.\nPlace a time-projected image next to the corresponding 30 s submovie (Figure 4A,B). Identify the signal line on the time-projected submovie. Identify the direction of the actomyosin signal movement (0°–360°) along this line in the original submovie by manually playing the submovie. Use the Angle tool (in the Fiji bar) to manually measure the direction of the signal movement relative to the defined tissue axis or a similar available tool.\nNOTE: Fiji works only on a 0°–180° scale (Figure 4C), and a recalculation of the obtained values onto a 0°–360° scale is required. A signal line corresponds to the trajectory of one actomyosin signal movement over time.",
    "To avoid duplication in the analysis of actomyosin signals, mark the analyzed signal lines within cells in the time-projected submovie (Figure 4B,D).\nAnalyze all selected cells in the 30 s submovie and save the obtained angles.\nNOTE: Analyze only subcellular cytoplasmic actomyosin signals in cells with well-defined cell outlines throughout a TLM. Exclude individual cells with less than 15–20 detected signals in the whole TLM. Ignore actomyosin signals that move across cells due to their unknown origin. An example of signal counts for one analyzed cell in the 30 s submovie is shown in Figure 4D.\nContinue until all 30 s-long submovies of one TLM are analyzed, and save all measured angles of actomyosin signals of one TLM in a spreadsheet file.\nSum up all measured angles over the relevant number of TLMs (dependent on the experiment). Plot the percentage of the direction of analyzed actomyosin signals, for example, as a rose diagram with a range from 0° to 360° with a preferred software.\nNOTE: To obtain statistically significant results, five to ten independent egg chambers of any egg chamber stage are recommended to be analyzed.\n2. Tissue Scale\nNOTE: To dissect and image in vitro cultured Drosophila egg chambers, follow the protocol in Supplementary File 2. To analyze acquired TLMs, continue with the following protocol below. Accompanied test files of TLMs are placed in the Supplementary File 3.\nSelective surface extraction of curved epithelial tissues\nNOTE: This protocol allows users to selectively extract a thin layer of actomyosin in a curved epithelial tissue over time. This protocol step is user-friendly and based on an intuitive graphical interface. It is possible to comfortably analyze (extract surface) several TLMs. Use TestMovie2.czi (from the Supplementary File 3) as a test TLM example.",
    "Open an up-to-date Fiji application (Fiji > Help > Update > Apply Changes > OK).\nEnsure the Ellipsoid Surface Projection Plugin15 is installed. Follow Viktorinova et al.16.\nOpen a TLM and export it as an XML/HDF5 file by clicking Plugins > BigDataViewer > Export Current Image as XML/HDF5 file.\nNOTE: It is required to define an export path. The saving itself can take several minutes and depends on the TLM length.\nOpen the exported file in Ellipsoid Surface Projection by clicking Plugins > BigDataViewer > Ellipsoid Surface Projection > Select XML file.\nNOTE: A new window with sagittal views of the egg chamber and a dialog to guide the user through the processing will appear. Details on how to navigate in the slice view can be found at https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer.\nThe dialog window called Ovaries Projection has several tabs. In the first dialog tab called Bounding box, define the x and y borders of an egg chamber in the TLM together with the z width of the bounding box (i.e., the depth of a z-stack/egg chamber) and press set (Figure 5A).\nTo define borders, drag buttons next to x, y, and z or define the number coordinates in the x, y, and z boxes. Ensure that the borders are generous enough to get the part of the egg chamber of interest into the surface extraction. The selected parts of the egg chamber are highlighted in pink.\nSwitch to the tab called Find blobs in the window Ovaries Projection. Define the sigma and the minimal peak value; then, press compute to identify the actomyosin signals (Figure 5B), which will appear as green blobs. Retry this step with different parameters until enough spots (around 100) are found.",
    "NOTE: Sigma 1‒3 with minimal peak value 20‒100 works the best to identify actomyosin signals of stage-6 to -8 egg chambers. Identifying actomyosin signals is a crucial step and depends on the signal quality and its size. It is important to confirm the correct size of the existing blobs. No visible green spots/blobs in the image means that the next step will not work. Browse through the selected z planes to see blobs.\nTo design the ellipsoid, continue with the tab called Fit ellipsoid. Set Random samples to 10,000, Outside/inside cut-off distance to 1‒10, and then, click Compute (Figure 5C).\nNOTE: The lower the cut-off distance, the more precise the desired ellipsoid will be. After this, the tab called Projection will automatically open and allows the definition of the surface extraction. The settings need to be optimized.\nContinue further with the tab called Projection (Figure 5D). Set up a minimum and maximum projection distance (i.e., the width of the desired ellipsoid). It is required to set a minimal and maximal projection distance so that the pink defined ellipsoid region includes the entire outside layer of the egg chamber. Define the slice distance (1 is recommended).\nNOTE: Examples of an incorrect and an optimal ellipsoid fit resulting in incorrect and optimal projection parameters are shown in Figure 6A,C. The thin circumferential layer of the interest can be defined later. Make sure that the pink region of the ellipsoid with the defined width on the egg chamber is visible before pressing compute. It is important that the desired ellipsoid (pink single line) nicely fits the ellipsoid surface of an egg chamber in order to obtain the best results. If the ellipsoid fit is not good, arrange different settings till the desired surface extraction is obtained.",
    "Set an output width (≥800) and height (≥400) of the ellipsoid. Set from which time point to which time point the surface extraction should be created (i.e., define the length of the TLM extraction). Choose either a spherical or a cylindrical projection. Flip Z and align Y if required.\nPress compute to obtain a surface extraction for both channels in new windows called Image. Adjust the brightness and contrast of the obtained image windows to be able to see the projected actomyosin signals, by clicking Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast.\nNOTE: An example comparison of a projection resulting from an incorrect and optimal ellipsoid fit is shown in Figure 6B,D.\nIf the surface extraction looks good, save the images (both channels separately) as .tiff. Additionally, save the Log window file for future reference as to how the surface of this particular egg chamber was extracted.\nNOTE: This is particularly important information if the extracted thin layer should be returned to its original unfolded shape (for developers only).\nMerge the channels with a preferred color code in Fiji.\nNOTE: If necessary, project selected z-stack layers with actomyosin signals. The projection of selected z-stack layers is required when the acquisition focus slightly changes over time in a TLM. For best results, project at most one to two z-stack layers.\nSave the results as .tiff files.\nNOTE: Representative examples of thin layers (selective basal and apical surface) that represent the Myosin II (MRLC::GFP) signal from the follicle epithelium of the control and fat2 mutant egg chambers can be found in Figure 8.\nData processing of a selectively extracted tissue surface\nBleach-correct the TLMs to compensate for intensity decay of the fluorescent labels.",
