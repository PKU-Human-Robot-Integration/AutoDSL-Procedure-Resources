    "If you are confident of your TF/DNA complex 3D structure, then you can use tFIRE default function pre-trained by all available TF/DNA structures in the PDB database. You can also construct your own energy function with tFIRE by several non-homology structures. You can use the PISCES server (Wang and Dunbrack, 2003) (http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/PISCES.php[href=http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/PISCES.php]) that this server will give you a subset of your input structure list (PDB id) that each protein in the subset has little homology to another.If you are not confident of your TF/DNA structure, you can train tFIRE with a single structure and subsequently predict PWMs using tFIRE."
