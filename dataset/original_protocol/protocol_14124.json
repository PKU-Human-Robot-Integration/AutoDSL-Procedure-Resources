    "All animal procedures and protocols were approved by the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System (VAHCS) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the \"Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals\" (The National Academic Press, USA)12.\n1. Choice of animals\nNOTE: C57Bl6 mice are used for all three arthritis models.\nUse either male or female mice, but note that the response to arthritis pain may vary depending on gender and the pathogenesis of the model being tested.\nSelect mice that have reached sexual maturity, are no longer rapidly growing and are not old enough to have developed spontaneous arthritis that could confound pain measurements.\n\tNOTE: Twelve weeks is an ideal age for pain measurement in the models described but this depends on the study design. Age at initiation of arthritis depends on the duration of time the model takes to develop. Acute inflammatory arthritis (carrageenan model) requires 3 h to develop, therefore animals are 12 weeks of age at the time of induction. Chronic inflammatory arthritis (CFA model) requires 3 weeks to develop, therefore animals are 9 weeks old at the time of induction. Chronic degenerative arthritis (collagenase model) requires 4 weeks to develop, therefore animals are 8 weeks at the time of induction. A more chronic model of degenerative arthritis can be used by inducing arthritis at 6 weeks of age. This allows 6 weeks of development of joint damage. However, chronic degenerative arthritis in mice does not produce significant evoked pain.\nObtain animals from a national commercial breeder source.\nHouse animals in groups of up to 8 animals in standard polycarbonate cages with ad libitum rodent diet and water.\nMaintain environmental conditions at 72 °C ± 1 °C and 33% ± 1% humidity with 12 h light/dark cycles.\n2. Intra-articular injections into the knee",
    "Create a 30 G 2.5 mm sterile by covering the length of a 0.5 inch needle with a sheath made of polyethylene tubing with an inside diameter of 0.38 mm and outside diameter of 1.09 mm, leaving only 2.5 mm of the needle protruding. This prevents inserting the needle too deeply and exiting the joint posteriorly.\nChoose a single knee to inject, shave it using any commercially available electric facial hair trimmer, and sterilize with providone-iodine scrub.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane in 100% O2 at 1 L/min for 3 min ± 1 min. Maintain anesthesia using a nosecone during the procedure. Confirm anesthesia depth by toe pinch. Take care to monitor respiratory status and minimize anesthesia exposure to maintain adequate respirations.\nEnter the joint at the midline through the patellar tendon just inferior to the lower edge of the patella using the sterile sheathed needle once the mouse is fully anesthetized. This anterior midline approach maximizes accuracy for entering the joint and injecting the substance of interest.\nUse the same approach for injecting both arthritis-inducing substances and analgesic substances. Sham controls are produced by inserting the needle as above but without injecting any substance.\n3. Production of arthritis\nAnesthetize animal as in step 2.3 above.\nWeigh the appropriate amounts (see below) of carrageenan, Complete Freund's Adjuvant and Type IV Collagenase and dilute to the appropriate concentration with normal saline in a laminar flow hood for safety and sterility.\nInject 10 µl of 2.5% carrageenan diluted in 0.9% sterile saline into the knee as above using a Hamilton syringe to produce acute inflammatory arthritis. Arthritis peaks 3 h after injection.",
    "Inject, 30 µL (30 µg) of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) into the knee to produce chronic inflammatory arthritis. There is an initial acute inflammatory phase that peaks at 1 week then a chronic phase that peaks at 3 weeks following injection.\nInject 10 µL containing 10 IU Type IV Collagenase to produce chronic degenerative arthritis. Arthritis pain peaks 4 weeks after injection.\n4. Measurement of evoked joint pain\nAlways examine the normal comparator knee first to minimize the cross-over pain response (windup) from the painful knee13. \nTrain the examiner to apply consistent and firm pressure of 700 gf/cm2 = 10 psi using a Palpometer level 4; the device will emit 4 beeps when this level of pressure is applied. This amount of pressure will consistently elicit a greater pain response from an arthritic joint than from a normal joint.\n\tNOTE: The device is calibrated at the factory to elicit 4 beeps when the appropriate level of pressure is applied. Use the device for training only; do not use on the animals but when examining the animals, apply the amount of pressure learned through the training.\nRestrain the mouse tightly enough to prevent casual movement by holding the scruff of the neck with the index finger and thumb and using the 4th and 5th fingers to restrain the tail. The mouse should be able to make discrete, brief movements with effort and when stimulated, but should not be able to move freely or continuously.\nAdminister repeated firm (Palpometer level 4) palpations concurrently to the lateral and medial sides of each knee at approximately the joint line with the thumb and index finger of the free hand once per second for one minute while restraining the mouse. Do not use the Palpometer for the mouse examination; it is used only for training.",
    "Have a second observer count the number of times the animal vocalizes and fights to escape the restraint during this one-minute time-period. The sum of fights and vocalizations is the Evoked Pain Score.\nAlways us the same examiner throughout the study and confirm the examiner and observer are blinded as to experimental condition.\n5. Measurement of spontaneous joint pain.\nNOTE: The Advanced Dynamic Weight Bearing (ADWB) device calculates the percent of total time the animal spends on each limb and the percent of total weight borne on each limb.\nFill a plastic beaker with 2 L of water. Place the foam pad and medium density fiberboard that are included with the equipment along with the filled beaker on a laboratory scale and record the combined weight.\nOpen the ADWB program and select Mice sensor type.\nCalibrate the system prior to each experiment:\n\t\nSelect Full calibration under the Calibration menus. Enter 0.00 as a Tare value and the weight of the foam pad, medium density fiberboard, plastic beaker, and water as the Calibration weight, then select Next.\nSelect Tare before placing anything on the sensor. Before selecting Gain preview, cover the sensor pad with the provided foam pad, medium density fiberboard, and plastic beaker filled with 2 liters of water, in that order. Select Gain preview once the calibration weight is on the sensor.\nAdjust the calibration weight so it is evenly distributed across the individual sensors and when the value of the Calibration indicator is above 95, select Gain definition. This process produces a normalized mean for the individual sensors and confirms the integrity of the individual sensors. Finally, select Next.\nSave the calibration file into the calibration folder.\nSelect New and where provided enter the Project name and the Animal name for the first mouse to be tested.",
    "Select Browse and open the calibration file that was created for the project. Select Next, ensure Enable video capture is selected, and select OK.\nWeigh the animal, select Capture, and record the weight in the software. Select OK.\nDo not acclimate mice to the chamber before the collection of data because this device measures spontaneous behavior.\nPlace mouse in the chamber for a period of 5 min of testing. When the animal is in the chamber select Launch. The software will record the animal's activity during this time, capture a video and synchronize with the sensor data, and automatically partition this video into analyzable and non-analyzable segments.\n\tNOTE: The software considers segments analyzable when at least one stable zone is detected. A stable zone is created when sensors detect ≥2 g on one sensor with a minimum of one adjacent sensor detecting ≥1 g and when the weight distribution of a zone is stable for more than 0.38 s.\nBefore the first analysis in a series select Easy scoring and Independent paws setting.\n\tNOTE: Easy scoring allows iteration validation of segments where the stable zone does not change based on the validation of the first stable zone of that segment. Independent paws setting provides the observer with access to the keyboard shortcuts that allow individual identification of each paw. The observer assigns zones that meet minimal criteria as right hind, left hind, right fore, left fore, both forepaws, other body part, or ignore zone by using the keyboard shortcuts while holding the cursor over the segment per the video and scaled map of activated sensors.",
    "Select >> to move to the first analyzable segment. If a stable zone does not have the correct paw identified then hold the cursor over that zone and press the shortcut (right hind, s; left hind, a; right fore, w; left fore, q; both forepaws, e; other section of the body, z, ignore zone, x) that corresponds with the correct body part.\n\tNOTE: A minimum of 1.5 min of analyzable time is required to meet analysis thresholds. Analyzed segments are added and averaged automatically for output per paw(s) by the software.\nThe ADWB software then automatically calculates the percentage of analyzed time spent and percentage of body weight (g) placed on each of the four limb options. Export these values into a new spreadsheet by selecting Results, Export, selecting Yes to the prompt question asking if only the first five summary lines should be exported, and selecting the location of the output.\nEuthanize animals by CO2 inhalation followed by thoracotomy at the end of the study period.\nFor each additional animal in the same group, select New and enter a unique animal name but do not change the project name. Select Next, ensure Enable video capture is selected, and select OK. Follow steps 5.5 to 5.12 as for the first animal."
