    "1. Blocking Free Cysteine Residues Using Iodoacetamide\nGrow U-2 OS cells in a 6 cm2 dish to 50%–60% conﬂuency in minimum essential medium with high glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% sodium pyruvate at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nMake a fresh stock of 10 mM iodoacetamide just prior to use, then discard any unused reagent.\nAdd 0.1 mM final concentration iodoacetamide directly to the cell culture media. Gently rock the dish at room temperature for 2 min.\n2. Harvesting the Cells\nAspirate the media from the cells.\nWash the cells with 5 mL of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times. Aspirate the final PBS wash solution then add 1 mL of cold PBS.\nScrape the cells off the bottom of the dish using a cell scraper. Using a 1 mL pipette draw up the PBS and cell suspension and dispense all the liquid into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin the cells at 7,500 x g for three min at 4 °C. Aspirate the PBS, leaving the cell pellet behind. The cell pellet can be stored at -80 °C until processing\n3. Extraction of Protein\nPrepare 100 µL of a 1x lysis buffer diluted in ddH2O (See Table of Materials). Add phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) immediately before use to a 1 mM final concentration.\nAdd 50 µL of the 1x lysis buffer directly to cell pellet and suspend. Incubate this on ice for 5 min.\nSonicate for 8 s using the constant pulse mode at 40% (see Table of Materials for sonicator; adjust as necessary for different sonicators), keeping the extract on ice.\nSpin the extract at 4 °C for 5 min at 16,000 x g. The supernatant is the soluble protein fraction. Bradford analysis can be performed to determine protein concentration if desired.\n4. Sample Preparation",
    "Take 10 µL of the soluble protein extract and add 10 µL of a 1x Laemmli SDS-sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, and 0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Do not add any reducing reagents.\nKeep samples on ice if SDS PAGE analysis will be performed that day; for long term storage, -20 °C is appropriate. Right before running the gel, heat the sample for 5 min at 85 °C.\n5. In Vivo Formaldehyde Cross-linking of Endogenous Proteins in U-2 OS Cells\nGrow U-2 OS cells in a 175 cm2 flask to 70%–80% conﬂuency (see section 1).\nPerform the formaldehyde crosslinking reaction\nIn a fume hood, aliquot a 37% formaldehyde solution purchased from commercial sources. Add the formaldehyde fixative directly to the medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 1% and incubate at room temperature with gentle agitation for 15 min.\nTo quench the reaction, add 1.25 M glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M and incubate at room temperature with gentle agitation on a rocker for 5 min.\nWash the cells with 5 mL of cold PBS three times. Aspirate the final PBS wash solution and add 10 mL of PBS. Scrape the cells off the bottom of the flask using a cell scraper.\nUsing a 10 mL pipette, draw up the PBS and cell suspension and dispense all of the liquid into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Spin the cells at 500 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the PBS, leaving the cell pellet behind.\n6. Fractionation of Nuclei\nPrepare 10 mL of homogenization buffer: 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.5% BSA at pH 7.4. Add PMSF immediately before use to a 1 mM final concentration and 3mL of nuclei suspension buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS).",
    "Add 5 mL homogenization buffer directly to the cell pellet and suspend completely. Centrifuge the suspension at 500 x g for 2 min at 4 °C then discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the pellet in 5 mL of homogenization buffer. Use a tight-fitting glass-Teflon homogenizer, dounce homogenize cells at 10 strokes/500 rpm.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 1,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, then discard the supernatant.\nNOTE: Use the supernatant for isolation of mitochondria by centrifuging at 10,000 x g for 10 min.\nSuspend the pellet in 1 mL nuclei suspension buffer and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 600 x g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.\nSuspend the pellet in 1 mL nuclei suspension buffer and centrifuge again. Discard the supernatant. The final pellet will be isolated nuclei.\n7. Extraction of Protein\nRepeat section 4, except adding 25 µL of the 1x lysis buffer directly to the cell pellet then suspending.\n8. Sample Preparation\nPrepare two samples for SDS-PAGE by taking 10 µL each of the soluble protein extract and add 10 µL of 2x Laemmli SDS-sample buffer and 1 µL of 2-Mercaptoethanol (BME).\nHeat one sample for 5 min at 37 °C and the second sample for 15 min at 98 °C to reverse the formaldehyde cross link.\n9. SDS-PAGE Analysis\nPrepare 1 L of 1x Tris-glycine running buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM Glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS).\nSet up the SDS-PAGE running apparatus.\n\tNOTE: This protocol uses a 16% precast TGX SDS-Page. Of note, any percentage gel can be used.\n\t\nPer the manufacturer protocol, open the package the gel is stored in and remove the cassette.\nRemove the comb that is lining the wells and the tape from the bottom of the cassette.\nPlace the gel into the running apparatus.",
    "Fill the chamber with the 1x running buffer until the wells are submerged in liquid. Using a plastic pipet, rinse out the wells with the running buffer.\nLoad the samples on the gel along with 10 µL prestained standard marker.\nRun the gel at 200 V until the dye front is approximately 1 cm from the bottom of the gel.\n10. Western Blot\nPrepare 1 L of 1x transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM Glycine, 20% methanol) and store at 4 °C until use.\nCarefully remove the gel and open the cassette. Using a razor, carefully cut and discard the stacking gel. Pick up the gel using one corner and place it into a tray with transfer buffer, allowing it to rock gently for 5 min.\nWhile the gel is rocking, place an ice block (stored in -20 °C) into the transfer tank and add the transfer buffer to ¾ full.\nWet the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane by soaking it in 100% methanol for 30 s.\nOnce the 5 min have passed, prepare to set up the transfer in a tray with transfer buffer. The transfer buffer should be enough to completely submerge the blot. Set up the blot transfer as follows: at bottom, the bottom of the cassette holder (black); then a thick sponge, extra thick blotting paper, the polyacrylamide gel, a PVDF membrane, extra thick blotting paper, and a thick sponge; then finally the top of the cassette holder (white) at top.\nLock the cassette and place the unit into the transfer tank with the PVDF membrane towards the positive anode and the gel towards the negative. Top off the unit with transfer buffer until your transfer is completely submerged.",
    "Place the unit on top of a stir plate. Add a stir bar to the unit and begin stirring at 125 rpm.\nRun at 100 V for 60 min.\nWhile the transfer is running, prepare a solution of 5% powdered milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline, with Tween-20, pH 7.5 (TBST).\nDismantle the unit and remove the membrane, noting which side was in contact with the gel; ensure this side stays up in the tray for the remaining steps.\nSoak the membrane for 2 min in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) followed by blocking the membrane by incubating in 5 mL of 5% milk-TBST solution for 30 min at room temperature.\nReplace the milk with a fresh 4 mL of 5% milk-TBST solution and add the primary antibody at the proper dilution (in this case, our dilution is 1:2,000 for the dUTPase antibody) and incubate over night with gentle rocking at 4 °C.\nThe following day, remove the blot from the 4 °C rocker to a room temperature rocker, discarding the primary antibody solution.\nDo three quick washes with TBST, using enough liquid to completely submerge the blot, followed by 3 washes, 5 min each, rocking slowly.\nFollowing the last wash, add 5 mL of the 5% milk-TBST solution and rock the blot for 15 min then discard.\nAdd secondary antibody diluted in 5% milk-TBST at the desired concentration. (In this case, 1:5,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit diluted in 5 mL of 5% milk-TBST solution)\nIncubate at room temperature, rocking for 1 h, then discard the solution.\nDo three quick washes with TBST followed by 3 washes, 5 min each, rocking slowly, then discard the final wash and add 5 mL of TBS.",
    "Prepare a 1:1 mixture of an ECL chemiluminescent detection solutions (1 mL of each reagent for a final volume of 2 mL) and add this directly to the blot incubating for 1 min.\nRemove the membrane using tweezers and dab the corner with a laboratory wipe, removing any excess solution. Place the membrane in shrink wrap and place the protein side up in an x-ray cassette.\nExpose the membrane to x-ray film. The time of exposure will vary.\nSubscription Required.
