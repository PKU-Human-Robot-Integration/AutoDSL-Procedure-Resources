    "Preparation of culture filtrate antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis   M tuberculosis H37Rv colonies were transferred from the Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) slopes to 2 ml of Sauton's liquid medium. LJ media is widely used in M. tuberculosis culture and contains glycerol, malachite green, coagulated egg and poured in McCartney bottles to solidify. Bacterial clumps are treated with 2 ml of LB media and 3 mm single glass beads, briefly vortex and spin the suspension briefly at low speed or leave it undisturbed for a few minutes for the clumps to settle and transfer the supernatant containing the bacteria for culture.   The bacterial cell suspension was then transferred to 10 ml of Sauton's liquid medium in a McCartney bottle for incubation at 37 °C for 2 weeks.   The bacilli were then transferred to 200 ml of Sauton's liquid medium and grown as shaker culture for 4 weeks. Innoculum from log phase culture is usually added to the culture media in 1/100th dilution for propagation of large volume mycobacterial culture.   The log phase cells were again transferred to a 4 L culture flask containing 1.5 L of Sauton's medium and grown as stationary culture for four weeks at 37 °C.   The mycobacterial cells continue to multiply during this period and form a surface pellicle.   The bacilli in the culture were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm (3,000 x g) for 30 min.   The culture supernatant was sterile filtered using Millipore filter (0.22 micron) to ensure complete removal of the bacilli and the supernatant containing the culture filtrate antigen was concentrated using 3 kDa cut-off membrane in stirred cell.   The protein content in the culture filtrate antigen was estimated using BCA assay kit.   The antigen was then distributed into smaller volumes along with sodium azide (0.",
    "002%) and protease inhibitor, PMSF at a final concentration of 2 mM per ml each.   The Culture Filtrate Antigen (CFA) was then stored at -70 °C for later use. This was used as the starting material to purify 38 kDa and 30 kDa antigens.      Purification of 38 kDa antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by two dimensional preparative electrophoresis.   Purification of the 38 kDa antigen  The 38 kDa lipoprotein of M. tuberculosis H37Rv CFA was purified by two dimensional electrophoresis (2-D).The first dimensional separation was based on the pi value of the protein using Preparative isoelectric focusing technique, followed by Preparatory SDS-PAGE wherein the proteins were separated based on their molecular weight. Two dimensional preparative electrophoresis (2-D)   Perparative isoelectric focusing The preparatory IEF cell was used for the first dimensional separation of proteins based on the fact that all proteins have a pH dependent net charge. During electrofocusing, the proteins are concentrated in discrete liquid fractions at their respective isoelectric points in an established pH gradient where the net charge on the protein is zero.   Sample preparation Whole M. tuberculosis H37Rv CFA (100 mg) was dialysed overnight against Milli Q water (4 L with 3- 4 changes of water advised at 3 -4 h interval) and then treated with 4 M urea (13.2 g), 0.2% Digitonin (137.5 mg of 80% stock), 0.2% CHAPS (110 mg), 10% qlycerol (5.5 ml) and 1% Carrier ampholytes pH ranqe 4-6 (0.5 ml). The final volume was made up to 55 ml with Milli Q water.   Experimental conditions The sample was loaded onto the preparatory IEF cell and focusing was carried out at 12 W constant power for 4-5 h at RT with cooling provided by a circulatinq cold water bath.",
    "According to the manufacturer’s instructions the Rotofor cell must be run with cooling or excessive heating may occur, damaging the unit. A refrigerated circulating water bath is recommended to keep the coolant temperature at 4 °C. The initial conditions were 500 V and 20 mA (30 min). At equilibration (4-5 h), the conditions were 1,200 V and 10 mA. Twenty fractions of 2.5 ml each were collected, their pH measured, and their polypeptide composition was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.     Peparatory SDS-PAGE The Model 491 Prep Cell was used for the continuous elution electrophoresis. During the run, samples were electrophoresised through a cylindrical SDS-PAGE. After optimization, 10% gel was used, wherein, the RF (Relative Front) value of 38 kDa protein was between 0.55-0.6.   Sample preparation Rotofor fractions containing 38 kDa antigen were pooled, dialyzed extensively against distilled water at 4 °C. The proteins concentrated (savant speed vac concentrator) up to 2.5 ml were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 6x SDS sample buffer (composition of 6x SDS sample buffer: 0.35 M Tris HCl (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 30% glycerol, 9.3% DTT, do not make up the volume) and applied to the model 491 Prepcell for purification.   Experimental conditions Total volume of sample applied: 3 ml Percentage of resolving gel: 10% Height of resolving gel: 6 cm Percentage of stack gel: 4% Height of stack gel: 1.5 cm Run buffer: 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS Elution buffer: PBS (0.01 M, pH 7-7.2) Run condition: 12 W for 8 h     After elution of Bromophenol blue tracking dye, the fractions were collected at the rate of 1.5 ml/min. The polypeptide composition of every tenth fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When the region with protein of interest was identified, every fraction within that region was analyzed to determine the level of contamination.",
