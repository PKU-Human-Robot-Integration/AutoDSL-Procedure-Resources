    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nCRISPR-dCas13-FP/gRNA Delivery Method\nTiming: 2 days\nThe purpose of this step is to deliver expression vectors including gRNA and dPspCas13b-FP into cells. The transfected cells followed by selection with antibiotics (puromycin in this protocol) is optional if the transfection level is low.\nNote: A dozen gRNAs targeting NEAT1, SatIII, MUC4 and GCN4 have been tested with dPspCas13b (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nPlate cells in 12-well plates at approximately 30% confluency.\nTransfect dPspCas13b-FP and gRNA expressing vectors.\nNote: Cell density should reach 70%–80% confluency.\nCritical: Plasmids transfection into cells should be performed within 24 h after cell plating to guarantee the cells are actively dividing.\nRecover Lipofectamine 3000 Reagent and Opti-MEM medium to 25°C.\nDilute 2 μL Lipofectamine 3000 in 50 μL Opti-MEM and mix well with a pipette.\nDilute 2 μL P3000, 0.7 μg gRNA and 0.3 μg dPspCas13b-FP plasmids in 50 μL Opti-MEM and mix well with a pipette.\nCritical: We recommend labeling NEAT1 with dPspCas13b in HeLa cells as a positive control due to the high expression and available proteins for positive signal confirmation (e.g., NONO, SFPQ, TDP43) when first set up CRISPR-dCas13b-FP labeling system in live cells. Additionally, mRNA MUC4 is another optional positive control for labeling cytoplasmic RNAs.\nCritical: At step 5, we suggest the ratio of each gRNA plasmid and dPspCas13b-FP plasmid above 2:1. In our previous study (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), we transfected 0.2 μg dPspCas13b-EGFP, 0.4 μg g5′-1 and 0.4 μg g5′-2 (targeting NEAT1) to label NEAT1 for cells in 12-well plate. Researchers could adjust the amount of transfected plasmids according to the requirements. In addition, to control artefactual and false-positive signal labeled by CRISPR-dPspCas13b, the positive gRNA control to label NEAT1 (available) and negative control (non-targeting gRNA) should be tested simultaneously.",
    "Alternatives: Beyond single RNA labeling and tracking, application of orthogonal dPspCas13b and dPguCas13b on dual-color imaging of different transcripts as well as combination of dPspCas13b and nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9, dSpCas9 used in this protocol) for simultaneous visualization of genomic DNA and RNA transcripts are optional.\nAt step 4, dilute 4 μL Lipofectamine 3000 in 50 μL Opti-MEM and mix well with a pipette.\nAt step 5, for dual-color RNA-RNA imaging, dilute 4 μL P3000, 0.3 μg dPspCas13b-FP, 0.7 μg gRNA (Psp), 0.3 μg dPguCas13b-FP and 0.7μg gRNA (Pgu) plasmids in 50 μL Opti-MEM and mix well with a pipette (dPspCas13b-3×EGFP-2×NLS-IRES-puro, gNEAT1 and dPguCas13b-3×mRuby3-2×NLS, gSatIII for NEAT1, SatIII labeling are used in this protocol); for dual-color DNA-RNA labeling, dilute 4 μL P3000, 0.3 μg dPspCas13b-FP, 0.7 μg gRNA, 0.3 μg dCas9-FP and 0.7 μg sgRNA (dPspCas13b-3×mRuby3-2×NLS, gMUC4/gSatIII and dCas9-Emerald, sgMUC4/sgSatIII for MUC4/SatIII DNA and RNA labeling are used in this protocol) in 50 μL Opti-MEM and mix well with a pipette.\nAdd diluted plasmids to diluted P3000 reagent at 1:1 ratio and mix well with a pipette.\nIncubate for 15 min at 25°C (or room temperature).\nAdd DNA-lipid complex dropwise and evenly into each well of the 12-well plates.\nIncubate cells for 8–12 h and refresh the medium (refresh the DNA-lipid containing medium will avoid the lipid toxicity), followed by plating into glass bottom dishes for microscopic observation.\nNote: Summary of recommended plasmids usage for different applications of CRSIPR-dCas13b on living cell imaging is provided in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_84_1.csv\nOptional: In order to increase the proportion of cell transfection, antibiotic selection is optional after step 8.\nNote: If take step of antibiotic selection, perform steps 10–12 listed below before transfection of dPspCas13b-FP and gRNA expressing vectors.\nPlating cells in 24-well plates at approximately 30% confluency.",
    "Add increasing amounts of antibiotics (e.g., 0–10 μg puromycin in this protocol) to duplicate wells of cells plated in culture medium.\nObserve the cells under a light microscope after 24 h and choose appropriate concentration of the antibiotic (the duration of culture may be extended, depending on the cell line used).\nPerform transfection of dCas13-FP and gRNA vectors according to steps 1–8.\nIncubate cells for 8–12 h and refresh the DNA-lipid containing medium.\nChange the medium to fresh culture medium supplemented with antibiotic (1 μg/mL puromycin for HeLa in this protocol) after 24 h.\nSelect for 24–48 h.\nAfter transfection and selection, collect the cells and passage into glass bottom dishes for the following microscopic observation.\nNote: Antibiotic selection should be performed when the transfection efficiency is low. In our previous study (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), gRNA expression vectors do not contain antibiotic resistance while dPspCas13b vectors do, thus, antibiotic selection is optional to select co-transfected cells. However, do not select for more than 2 days since transiently transfected plasmids are usually lost when cells divide. Additionally, package dPspCas13-FP into lentivirus for infection is also optional for some cell lines that are difficult to achieve desired level of protein expression by transfection.\nPreparing Cells for Microscopy\nTiming: 1 day\nThe purpose of this step is to prepare cells for observation under the microscope.\nAfter 24 h transfection (or antibiotic selection), cells are transferred into 35 mm No.1.5 glass-bottomed dishes (Cellvis) at 50%–70% confluency.\nWash cells with DPBS and exchange the medium with fresh FluoroBriteTM DMEM containing with 10% FBS (prewarmed to 37°C before used) while the cells confluency reaches 80%–100%, and place back in the incubator for 1 h before observation by microscope.\nEquilibrate the microscope to 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "Make sure cameras are aligned prior to image acquisition, if necessary, align using a multicolor calibration slide.\nIdentify suitable cells for imaging using dPspCas13b-FP channel.\nImage cells in the dPspCas13b-FP channel using suitable parameters according to each used microscope of application, and 50%T, 0.2 second and 0.2 μm z-step are set on DeltaVision Elite imaging system (GE Healthcare) in this protocol.\nImage processing based on used microscope, deconvolution plugin with softWoRx 6.5 is used in this protocol.\nCritical: In our experience, there are different FP expression and distribution patterns in cells under microscopic observation. For example, dPspCas13b-EGFP usually aggregates in the nucleolus with gNC (guide non-targeting control) (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Importantly, however, off-target gRNA can lead to an evenly redistribution of dPspCas13b-EGFP in the nucleus, and effectual gRNA targeting NEAT1 produces reliable NEAT1 (paraspeckle) signals (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/84-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Examples of dPspCas13b-FP Distribution Patterns with Different gRNAs\nTop, representative images of dPspCas13b-3×EGFP expressed cells with different gRNAs: gNC (guide non-targeting control), gOT (off-target gRNA), gNEAT1 (NEAT1 targeting gRNA). Bottom, line scans showing the relative intensity of the dotted lines in corresponding images. Arrows indicate the NEAT1 positive signal.\nCritical: A high level of dPspCas13b-EGFP expression generally introduces high background. Thus, the expression level of dPspCas13b-EGFP in the examined cells should be considered; its comparably lower expression as well as its uniform distribution in each nucleus (such as gNEAT1 panel in Figure1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) should be observed preferentially."
