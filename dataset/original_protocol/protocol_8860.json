Poly-lysine Coating of Coverslips\nNote: Carry out all cleaning and coating steps in a laminar flow chamber.\nPlace coverslips in a Petri dish containing 1 N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) for 2 hr.\nAspirate all HCl and rinse with 70% Ethanol (EtOH) 2-3x.\nLeave in 70% EtOH for 1 hr.\nAspirate all 70% EtOH and rinse with 100% EtOH 2-3x.\nLeave in 100% EtOH for 2 hr.

Prepare sylgard (polydimethylsilioxane, PDMS) lined dishes by pouring PDMS (elastomer and curing agent 10:1 by weight) into the dish to a thickness of 0.3 cm and allow to set at 30 °C O/N. Once this has set, cut a 2 cm by 1 cm inset into the PDMS. Clean and coat the inset with poly-lysine following the same steps as mentioned above for coverslips.\nStore poly-lysine coated coverslips and dishes covered inside the laminar flow chamber until use (up to 2 weeks, but achieve best adhesive results by preparing periodically every 3-4 days).",
    "Prepare a PDMS block, to pin the spinal cord in the vibrating tissue slicer. Mix Elastomer A and Elastomer B 1:1 by weight. Pour into a 100 x 15 mm Petri dish and allow to set O/N at 30 °C.

    "Carry out dissociations using the same procedure as mentioned in protocol section 3 Figure 2. Place one end of the spinal cord on the suture glue and press gently with forceps to adhere it strongly to the surface.

    "Image using 100X water immersion lens on confocal microscope.\n6. Electrophysiological Recording\nFabricate aluminosilicate glass patch pipettes (pipette resistance 2-5 MΩ) in a P-87 micropipette puller. Design patch pipette such that pipette tip encompasses entire presynaptic terminal diameter.\nPDMS coat patch pipettes by dipping the patch pipette under 50-60 psi pressure into PDMS23 (attach a silicone tubing, 0.89 mm inner diameter, connected to a nitrogen gas cylinder, to the back end of the patch pipette) and dry using a heat gun. Alternately, manually coat the pipette with PDMS, applying coating as close to the tip as possible, under a compound microscope.\nFire polish patch pipettes using a microforge (a custom built platinum filament fitted onto the stage of a compound microscope).\nIdentify isolated axons demonstrating labeled presynaptic terminals by fluorescence microscopy.\nFill recording solution (designed to isolate Ca2+ currents; 10 mM CaCl2 or 90 mM BaCl2 as charge carrier, HEPES buffered pH 7.6, osmolarity 270 mOsm) into the patch pipette using a syringe.\nInsert patch pipette into the pipette holder and position above bath using a motorized manipulator MP225. Gently lower the patch pipette into the bath and position against the face of a fluorescently identified presynaptic terminal.\nAdvance the patch pipette slowly until contact is made with the membrane. At this point, achieve a gigaohm seal by gentle mouth suction through a tube attached to the pipette holder.\nTo achieve the extremely low background noise levels required for recording single channel Ca2+ currents, use an Axopatch 200B with a cooled headstage for the recordings. Sample data at 20-50 kHz and filter using a 5 kHz Bessel filter. Carry out data acquisition using an Axograph X.",
    "Use a standard step protocol, in increments of 10 mV as stimulus. Incorporate a pre-pulse in the protocol, preceding the step protocol, to ensure maximal activation of Ca2+ channels. Incorporate a 10 mV leak step into the step protocol for post-analysis subtraction of leak currents.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
