As calcium and magnesium promote cell-cell adhesion, reducing these ions ensures efficient dissociation of single-cells.\nSelect one adult Aiptasia approximately 0.5–1.5 cm in total diameter, including tentacles (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2199-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Washing Aiptasia in CMF-ASW+EGTA\n(A) A representative microscopic image of adult CC7 Aiptasia symbiotic with Breviolum minutum (SSB01). Scale bar, 1 mm.\n(B) The animal is serially transferred across the first three wells of a 6-well plate and allowed to incubate in the final well.\nFill three wells of a 6-well plate with CMF-ASW+EGTA.\nUsing a transfer pipette, move the selected animal to the first well of the prepared 6-well plate and wash by gently pipetting the animal in and out of the pipette. The animal may produce mucus at this time. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nRepeat the washing process two additional times by transferring the anemone to the second and third wells of the 6-well plate. When transferring the animal between wells, take as little of the washing media as possible for each transfer.\nNote: When moving the animal between wells, do not draw the animal into the pipette, simply use the suction from the pipette to lift the animal out of the well and drop it into the next well for washing. This will minimize the transfer of washing media and debris between wells.\nCritical: If mucus or external particles remain on the animal at this stage, repeat steps 1a–1c until little to no mucus is observed on the animal. Mucus will interfere with the downstream steps of cutting and efficient centrifugation.",
    "After the final wash, allow the animal to incubate in the last well for at least 10 min.\nPause point: The animal can remain in the CMF-ASW+EGTA for up to 3 h.\nTentacle dissection\nTiming: 10 min\nMechanical separation of the Aiptasia tissue is necessary to increase the surface area of host tissue exposed to pronase in later stages of the protocol and enhances the number of host cells successfully dissociated.\nUsing suction from a clean transfer pipette, remove the Aiptasia anemone from the final washing well (taking minimal washing media) and place the animal on an empty, inverted petri dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2199-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dissection of Aiptasia tentacles\nThe tentacles are removed from the animal and chopped into fine pieces to increase surface area for enzymatic digestion. Scale bars, 1 mm.\n(A) The animal is transferred to a petri dish with minimal liquid.\n(B) The tentacles are oriented in one direction, and the animal is cut where the tentacles meet the body.\n(C) The body is removed and discarded.\n(D) The tentacles are chopped vertically and horizontally.\n(E) Representative view of results after tentacles are chopped and resuspended in CMF-ASW+EGTA.\nUnder a dissection microscope, use the suction of a p200 pipette to orient the animal so that it is laying on its side.\nDissect all of the tentacles from the body using a razor blade. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nDrag the body away from the tentacles and discard.\nFinely chop the tentacles horizontally and vertically with the razor blade.\nUse a small amount of CMF-ASW+EGTA (approximately 200 μL) to resuspend the chopped tentacle pieces and move them to a pre-weighed 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the chopped tentacle pieces at 70 × g for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5425 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2199-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Preparation of dissected Aiptasia tentacles for enzymatic digestion\n(A) The dissected tentacles form a pellet after centrifugation.\n(B) The supernatant is removed from the pellet of tentacles.\n(C) The tentacles are resuspended in pronase solution to begin enzymatic digestion.\nGently remove and discard the supernatant from the animal pellet (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nEnzymatic digestion\nTiming: 10–50 min\nA low concentration of pronase will digest proteins and disrupt the cell-cell protein interactions to quickly dissociate the tissue into single cells.\nOnce the supernatant is removed, weigh the 1.5 mL tube containing the pelleted tentacles. Determine the tentacle mass in milligrams by subtracting the mass of the empty tube.\nTo the tissue pellet, add 400 μL of 0.5% pronase solution in CMF-ASW+EGTA.\nNote: Prepare the 0.5% pronase solution fresh and use immediately by mixing 200 μL CMF-ASW+EGTA and 200 μL 1% pronase CMF-ASW+EGTA.\nMix slowly and gently by pipetting up and down with a p200 or p1000 pipette approximately eight times until the tentacle pieces are well mixed in the pronase solution (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nIncubate the tentacle pieces on an orbital shaker at 25°C with gentle agitation for approximately 0.7 min per milligram of tentacle mass (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Continue the incubation until the moment no visible tissue chunks remain in the solution.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2199-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Approximate time for dissociation in relation to the tentacle mass\nLinear model was generated using the ggplot2 package in R version 4.1.1.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Y axis represents the approximate time to reach a homogenized solution. X axis represents the mass of chopped tentacles used in the dissociation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2199-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative images of dissociated cells following enzymatic digestion and centrifugation\n(A) The dissociated Aiptasia cells appear homogenized in the pronase solution following enzymatic digestion.",
    "(B) The dissociated Aiptasia cells are pelleted for the removal of pronase solution and resuspension in staining solution.\nNote: During the incubation, flick the tube or slowly pipette the solution up and down to mix the pronase solution and check the status of tissue dissociations (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCritical: Avoid over-pipetting the mixture, as this will damage and rupture host cells. Avoid mixing more than twice during the incubation period.\nAfter incubation, centrifuge the dissociated cells at 70 × g for 5 min. Gently remove the supernatant and discard. The supernatant should be clear, as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nAlternatives: To complete the dissociation and staining process simultaneously, the following steps should be followed:\nGently suspend the chopped tentacles in a final concentration of 0.25% w/v pronase and 20–30 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 in CMF-ASW+EGTA. Pipette the suspension up and down eight times.\nIncubate the tentacle pieces in dark, at 25°C, on an orbital shaker with gentle agitation for approximately 20–30 min, or until no visible tissue chunks remain.\nProceed to centrifugation and resuspension for microscopy.\nFluorescent staining\nTiming: 40 min\nThe cell permeable Hoechst 33342 fluorescent dye in live cells will stain the host nucleus.\nGently suspend the dissociated cells in 200 μL of the staining solution and flick the tube to gently mix.\nIncubate the cells for 30 min in the dark at 25°C.\nCentrifuge the cells at 70 × g for 5 min. Remove and discard the supernatant (staining solution).\nResuspend the cells in 8–24 μL of CMF-ASW+EGTA.\nMounting and microscopy\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nFor observation under a microscope, the cell suspension can be mounted on a microscope slide.\nTake 8–10 μL of the cell suspension with a pipette onto a microscope slide.",
    "Note: It is recommended to use a larger tip, such as a 20 μL vs. a 10 μL, to avoid damaging the host cells during the transfer to the slide.\nWith tweezers, slowly lower a 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip over the droplet until flat, avoiding bubbles.\nTo avoid evaporation of the mounting media, seal the coverslip to the slide using clear nail polish or an alternative sealer.\nAllow the polish or sealer to dry, then view the slide on a fluorescence microscope. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nNote: We use the Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope with ZEN software and 63× oil immersion objective either in bright-field mode or Texas Red filter set for chlorophyll fluorescence (546/12 nm excitation, 590 nm long-pass fluorescence emission), and fluorescence filter set for Hoechst 33342 fluorescent nucleic acid stain (365 nm excitation, 445/50 nm band pass fluorescence emission).\nNote: Images can be analyzed and merged using ImageJ."
