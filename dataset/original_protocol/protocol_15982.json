    "The procedure for folding and biotinylation of pMHC I complexes is based on previously described protocols, with some adaptations (Garboczi, Hung, & Wiley, 1992[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0006]; Rodenko et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0015]; Toebes, Rodenko, Ovaa, & Schumacher, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0019]). Conditional complexes are produced from MHC I heavy chain inclusion bodies, prefolded β2m (described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0006]) and a template peptide (IAKEPVHGV for HLA-A*02:01 or FAPGNAPAL for H-2Kb). The MHC I heavy chain contains a 15-amino acid C-terminal recognition sequence for the BirA biotin ligase, which enzymatically conjugates a biotin molecule to the lysine in that sequence. The degree of biotinylation of pMHC I monomers following Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001] should be (near) complete, but it is recommended to determine the degree of biotinylation for each batch of pMHC I as described in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0007].

Prepare 500 µl fresh denaturing buffer.\n2. In a 1.5-ml reaction tube, dissolve ∼2.5 mg of MHC I heavy chain inclusion bodies (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0005]) in 500 µl denaturing buffer. Rotate at room temperature for at least 2 hr and preferably overnight to ensure complete dissolution.\n3. Set up 50 ml folding buffer in a 50-ml conical tube, rotate ∼15 min at RT, and then cool on ice for 1−1.5 hr.\n4. In the meantime, dissolve 3 mg of template peptide in ∼500 µl DMSO, and sonicate 10−15 min.\nPeptides that contain hydrophobic amino acids dissolve poorly in polar solvents, such as PBS or water. Therefore, it is recommended to dissolve peptides in DMSO and store them as 10-mM stocks at –20°C. Sonication of freshly prepared solutions, preferably in a warm water bath, improves solubility.\n5. Add template peptide solution to the tube containing 50 ml folding buffer (60 µM final concentration).\n6. Thaw a 1.2-mg aliquot of prefolded β2m (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0006]).\n7. Microcentrifuge β2m and MHC I heavy chain for 2 min at 16,000 × g, save 1 µl of each supernatant at −20°C as a reference for SDS-PAGE analysis (step 18), and add the remainder of each supernatant to the folding buffer containing template peptide (final concentrations: 6 µM β2m and 3 µM MHC I heavy chain).\n8. Filter the folding solution through a 0.22-µm filter using a syringe and leave in a 10°C water bath for 4−5 days.\nLarge-scale reactions can be filtered using a bottle-top filter.\nBiotinylation of pMHC I complexes",
    "NOTE: Folded complexes will dissociate at elevated temperatures, so from this point, keep all solutions and reagents on ice and centrifuges at 4°C!\n9. Sediment aggregates in the folding solution by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g, 4°C to, and filter supernatant through a 0.45-µm filter using a syringe.\nDepending on the purity of the inclusion bodies some protein aggregates may form during folding. Removing precipitates by centrifugation and filtering prevents obstruction of the filters used for concentration.\n10. Wash a 15-ml 30-kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator first with Milli-Q water and then with MHC buffer by centrifugation for 10 min each at 4,000 × g, 4°C. Add the filtered folding reaction (from step 9) and concentrate to ≤1 ml by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g, 4°C.\nFor concentration of large-scale reactions use a 30-kDa MWCO PES Vivaflow 200 protein concentrator system (Sartorius), driven by a peristaltic pump.\n11. In a cold room, recover concentrated sample and exchange the folding buffer for MHC buffer using a NAP-10 column: Wash the column 3 times with 1 ml MHC buffer, apply sample, and elute with 1 ml MHC buffer.\n12. Filter concentrated folding reaction through a SpinX centrifuge tube filter by centrifugation for 2 min (or longer if necessary) at 16,000 × g, 4°C.\n13. Prepare biotinylation solution (see recipe) on ice, and add 1 ml biotinylation solution to the 1 ml pMHC I solution. Incubate overnight at 4°C, preferably on a rotator.\nThe enzymatic activity of BirA biotin ligase is low at 4°C, and therefore the biotinylation reaction requires overnight incubation (∼16 hr).\nPurification of biotinylated pMHC I\n14. Sediment aggregates in the biotinylation solution by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g, 4°C.",
    "Some precipitation may form overnight. Sedimentation prevents obstruction of the filters used for concentration.\n15. Wash a 0.5-ml 30-kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator with Milli-Q water and then with MHC buffer. Concentrate biotinylation reaction to ∼500 µl by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g, 4°C.\n16. Filter concentrated solution containing biotinylated pMHC I through a SpinX centrifuge tube filter by centrifugation for 2 min (or longer if necessary) at 16,000 × g, 4°C.\n17. Purify biotinylated pMHC I complexes by gel-filtration chromatography at 4°C, for example, using an FPLC system equipped with a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare).\nOne 50-ml folding reaction typically yields between 0.1 and 2 mg of folded complex depending on the peptide and MHC I allele. The total volume can be concentrated to ∼500 µl for one injection on an S75 10/300 column. Larger-scale reactions yield higher protein quantities and should be purified in multiple 500-µl runs or using a larger column, such as an S75 16/600.\n18. Analyze fractions using SDS-PAGE. For reference include a protein standard, such as SeeBlue™ Pre-stained Protein Standard, and the reference MHC I heavy chain and β2m samples (set aside in step 7). Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0002] shows a typical FPLC chromatogram and corresponding gel.\nWe typically run our complexes on a 10% Bis-Tris gel for 30 min at 200 V in MES buffer. On a denaturing gel, the complex dissociates and two bands will be visible: one at ∼36 kDa corresponding to the heavy chain, and one at ∼10 kDa, corresponding to β2m. The peptide is too small to visualize on gel.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6f84bf7c-e343-4b0a-b1d0-981fdda57dec/cpim85-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "SDS-PAGE analysis (10% Bis-Tris gel in MES running buffer) of a typical pMHC I purification using FPLC. The first peak in the chromatogram contains mostly aggregates, whereas the second peak (marked with an asterisk) contains properly folded, pure pMHC I complexes, visible on this denaturing gel as two separate bands for the heavy chain (∼36 kDa) and β2m (∼10 kDa). Later peaks contain free heavy chain and free β2m. A protein marker, MHC I heavy chain inclusion bodies and prefolded β2m are included for reference.\n19. Pool fractions that contain pMHC I, and concentrate to 2−5 mg/ml using a 15-ml 30-kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator (prewashed with Milli-Q water and MHC buffer).\npMHC I complexes are more stable at higher concentrations.\nThe concentration can be measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and the Lambert-Beer Law: c = A/ε×L. The extinction coefficient (ε) at OD280 can be estimated from the number of tryptophans (W) and tyrosines (Y) in the protein sequence according to the following formula: ε = (nW × 5500) + (nY × 1490).\n20. Determine the volume of the sample and add glycerol to a final concentration of 15%.\nGlycerol is added as a cryoprotectant. It forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thus preventing the formation of ice crystals that can damage proteins.\n21. Aliquot the sample into PCR tubes or 1.5-ml polypropylene screw cap tubes, depending on the desired volume. Snap-freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at –80°C.\nWe typically store aliquots of 5, 10, and 25 µl. Frozen conditional pMHC I monomers can be stored at –80°C for at least a year. We recommend validation of the exchange performance (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0002]) before moving on to multimerization.",
    "For each batch of conditional pMHC I monomers, the thermal exchange performance should be validated. This protocol describes the use of gel filtration HPLC to confirm exchange at pre-established conditions, but can also be used to test additional exchange times and temperatures. When incubated at a higher temperature without peptide, the pMHC I monomer peak should disappear (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0003], magenta line compared to black line), but in the presence of an exchange peptide the complex is stabilized and the peak should remain visible (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0003], green line). For efficient stabilization the exchange peptide should have a higher affinity for its corresponding MHC I than the template peptide (<4,000 nM for H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL and <7,288 nM for HLA-A*02:01). A link to an affinity prediction tool is provided in Internet Resources.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bc602487-302c-40e2-8f02-03463e3abf71/cpim85-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nOverlay of typical gel filtration HPLC chromatograms that confirm thermal exchange of conditional HLA-A*02:01 monomers (left) and H-2Kb monomers (right). When incubated without peptide the HLA-A*02:01 monomer peak (0.5 µM) disappears (no peptide, magenta line), indicating dissociation, whereas in presence of a high-affinity peptide (50 µM) the complex remains stable (+peptide, green line) compared to nonincubated monomers (MHC input, black line). H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL dissociates at room temperature (pMHC I input black line), which can be “rescued” by addition of a high-affinity peptide (+peptide, green line).\nMaterials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001])\nConditional pMHC I monomers (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001])\nCold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4; tablets reconstituted in 500 ml demineralized water; Gibco)\n10 mM exchange peptide in DMSO, higher affinity than the template peptide (e.g., cytomegalovirus peptide NLVPMVATV for HLA-A*02:01 or ovalbumin peptide SIINFEKL for H-2Kb)\nHPLC system with gel filtration column (e.g., 300 × 7.8-mm BioSep SEC-s3000; Phenomenex, cat. no. 00H-2146-K0)\nPCR machine, Thermoblock, or incubator\nTesting the stability of pMHC I monomers at room temperature",
    "1. Thaw conditional pMHC I monomers on ice. Typically, a 5-µl aliquot of 2–5 mg/ml pMHC I monomer is enough for four to ten 100-µl injections of 0.5 µM pMHC I monomers.\n2. In a 1.5-ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tube, dilute conditional pMHC I monomers to 0.5 µM in PBS.\nWe typically prepare 10% extra to allow for variance when drawing up the sample for injection.\n3. Sediment aggregates by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 × g, room temperature.\n4. Analyze the sample by HPLC using a gel filtration column, such as a 300 × 7.8-mm BioSep SEC-s3000 column (Phenomenex) with PBS as running buffer.\nAnalysis of this sample provides information on the stability of the conditional complex at room temperature. Expect to see a sharp peak when injecting HLA-A*02:01-IAKEPVHGV, but no peak when injecting H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL, which is unstable at room temperature (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0003], pMHC I input; black lines).\nAnalysis of peptide-mediated stabilization of pMHC I monomers post thermal exchange\n5. Prepare 0.5 µM pMHC I in PBS containing 50 µM exchange peptide to confirm stabilization of the exchanged complex.\n6. Incubate at established exchange conditions in a PCR machine, Thermoblock, or incubator (3 hr at 32°C for HLA-A*02:01; 5 min at room temperature for H-2Kb).\n7. Sediment aggregates by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 × g, room temperature.\n8. Analyze by gel-filtration HPLC.\nWhen incubated with an exchange peptide, the MHC monomer peak should be at least as high as the input peak.\nThermal dissociation of conditional pMHC I monomers\n9. Prepare a 0.5 µM pMHC I solution in PBS.\n10.

    "11. Sediment aggregates by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 × g, room temperature.\n12. Analyze by gel-filtration HPLC.\nAt the optimal exchange conditions (3 hr at 32°C for HLA-A*02:01, and 5 min at room temperature for H-2Kb) the monomer peak should virtually disappear when incubated without peptide (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0003]).",
    "The low affinity of a T cell receptor (TCR) for pMHC I monomers enables sequential activation of multiple T cells by one pMHC in vivo. Through multimeric binding, the avidity of pMHC binding to TCRs becomes sufficiently high to stably label specific CD8+ T cells for visualization and isolation (Davis, Altman, & Newell, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0005]). Therefore, pMHC I monomers are biotinylated for multimerization on streptavidin in order to create tetrameric complexes. In addition, labeled streptavidin can be used to incorporate desired fluorophores. Allophycocyanin (APC) and phycoerythrin (PE) are typically used, but other fluorophores have also been successfully used in combination with pMHC I multimers. This protocol describes the preparation of 80 µl pMHC I multimer solution (0.625 µM final), but the reaction can be scaled depending on concentration and volume of pMHC I aliquots.\nMaterials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0002])\nBiotinylated conditional pMHC I monomers (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001])\n1 mg/ml APC-conjugated streptavidin (SA-APC; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, cat. no.

Keep all solutions and reagents on ice and centrifuges at 4°C!\n1. On ice, dilute biotinylated conditional pMHC I monomers in cold PBS to a concentration of 5 µM.\n2a. If making APC-labeled multimers: Add 53.6 µl cold PBS to 10 µl of pMHC I monomers.\n2b. If making PE-labeled multimers: Add 52.4 µl cold PBS to 10 µl of pMHC I monomers.\n3. Add either 1.4 µl SA-APC or 2.6 µl SA-PE. To ensure saturation of all four biotin-binding sites, add streptavidin conjugates stepwise. For example, three 0.47-µl additions of SA-APC or three 0.87-µl additions of SA-PE at 5-min intervals.",
    "To saturate all four of streptavidin's binding sites, 0.125 µM streptavidin should be added to 0.5 µM pMHC I monomer, corresponding to 2 µg of SA-APC (molecular weight ∼160 kDa) or 3.75 µg of SA-PE (molecular weight ∼300 kDa) per 100 µl pMHC I solution. To ensure binding sites are fully saturated, we add 70% of these amounts for a ratio of ∼6 pMHC I monomers to 1 streptavidin. With an excess of streptavidin not all binding sites would be saturated, resulting in the formation of lower order MHC I multimers that poorly bind T cells due to lower avidity. Ideally a little residual MHC I monomer remains present, ensuring full saturation of streptavidin.\n4. Add 15 µl cold glycerol and mix well.\n5. Aliquot into PCR tubes or 1.5-ml polypropylene screw cap tubes, depending on the desired volume. Snap-freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at –80°C.\nWe typically prepare 8-µl aliquots. Frozen pMHC I multimers can be stored at –80°C for at least a year.",
    "This protocol describes the thermal exchange of conditional pMHC I multimers for any number of desired peptides in parallel. Conditional multimers are temperature-labile and should be kept on ice until a peptide is added. For efficient stabilization the exchange peptide should have a higher affinity than the template peptide (<4,000 nM for H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL and <7,288 nM for HLA-A*02:01) for MHC I. One 10 µl aliquot of exchanged multimer is typically enough to stain ten to twenty samples, each containing 1,000,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).\nMaterials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001] to 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0003])\n10 mM exchange peptide(s) stock solution\nConditional pMHC I multimers (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0003])\n1. Dilute 10 mM exchange peptide stock(s) to 250 µM in PBS.\nHydrophobic peptides do not readily dissolve in PBS. Therefore it is recommended to dissolve peptides in DMSO and store them as 10-mM stocks at –20°C.\n2. Take an 8-µl aliquot of MHC I multimer from freezer and immediately place on ice.\nConditional MHC I multimers may dissociate at room temperature and should be kept cold prior to exchange, so make sure to keep them on ice when moving them from freezer to bench. Especially H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL is prone to rapid dissociation and should remain frozen until an exchange peptide is added.\n3. Add 2 µl 250 µM exchange peptide solution to frozen 8 µl MHC I multimer. As the mixture thaws, briefly pipette up and down to mix.\n4. Briefly spin and incubate exchange reactions in a PCR machine, Thermoblock, or incubator at defined temperature and time to induce exchange.\nH-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL readily exchanges within 5 min at room temperature. Exchange of HLA-A*02:01-IAKEPVHGV multimers is complete after a 3-hr incubation at 32°C.\n5. Briefly spin the tubes. The exchanged multimers are now ready for staining of T cells.",
    "Exchanged multimers can be stored at 4°C and used for at least a week without loss of function. They can typically be diluted 1:40 to stain 1,000,000 PBMCs in 40 µl of FACS buffer.",

    "Human β2m is used for the production of both human and murine MHC I complexes, because of its higher stability compared to its murine counterpart. Using prefolded β2m for folding of pMHC I ensures stabilization of MHC I and increases folding yields compared to using β2m inclusion bodies.\nMaterials\nDenaturing buffer (8 M urea/100 mM Tris•Cl, pH 8)\nPurified human β2m inclusion bodies (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0005])\n10 mM Tris•Cl (pH 7) in PBS\nDialysis tubing (10 kDa MWCO) and large beaker or bucket\n1.

    "This protocol describes how to use HPLC to determine the degree of biotinylation of MHC I monomers. Each batch of pMHC I monomers and preferably each batch of streptavidin should be tested. MHC I multimers will form by addition of streptavidin, and the height of the monomer peak in the chromatogram will decrease with increasing ratios of streptavidin (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0004]). Generally, 90%−95% of pMHC I monomers will be biotinylated. When testing highly unstable complexes, such as H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL, exchange peptide should be added for stabilization. If samples can be measured on a cooled (4°C) HPLC system, the peptide can be omitted.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e2e4b93b-3f5b-4c78-b593-6326e228954a/cpim85-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nOverlay of HPLC chromatograms that confirm biotinylation of pMHC I monomers. When incubated with increasing ratios of PE-conjugated streptavidin (SA-PE) the monomer peak decreases, whereas the streptavidin multimer peak increases, indicating the formation of MHC I multimers.\nMaterials\nConditional pMHC I monomers (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001])\nExchange peptide (of higher affinity than the template peptide; e.g., cytomegalovirus peptide NLVPMVATV for HLA-A*02:01 or ovalbumin peptide SIINFEKL for H-2Kb)\n1. Prepare five samples in 1.5-ml Sarstedt tubes to determine the biotinylation efficiency in 100 µl pMHC I monomer solution (0.5 µM). Prepare each sample fresh before analysis.\nAdd the components in the order listed. Keeping to this order will ensure the peptide is in solution and available for exchange and stabilization of MHC I. We typically prepare 10% extra to allow for variance when drawing up the sample for injection into the HPLC.\nPE can be bleached by UV light.
