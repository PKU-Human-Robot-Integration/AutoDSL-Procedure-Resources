    "All procedures performed in this study were approved by the National Taiwan University Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval No.: NTU-109-EL-00029 and NTU-108-EL-00158).\n1. Assessment of the volume alteration of dental cement\nNOTE: Changes in the volume of dental cement occur during the curing process. Test the volume changes of dental cement before implantation and baseplating. Researchers can test any brand of dental cement and use the brand with the lowest volume change to cement the baseplate. An example is shown in Figure 3.\nWeigh 0.5 g of each dental cement powder and mix it with its appropriate solution (1 mL).\n\tNOTE: The recommended powder/liquid ratio in the dental cement instructions is 0.5 g of powder to 0.25 mL of the solution to obtain a solid form. This testing protocol dilutes the ratio to 0.5 g/mL so that the mixture can be aspirated in liquid form in order to measure the volume change in pipette tips.\nUse 0.1-10 µL pipette tips to remove 2.5 µL of the dental cement mixture, and then seal the pipette tip with a light curing glue.\nPlace the tips on a rack, mark the top-most levels of the dental cement mixture, and measure the level of the dental cement mixture after 40 min (Supplementary video S1).\nIn addition to monitoring the level changes during the dental cement curing in the tips, measure the remaining dry dental cement density. To calculate the density, measure the weight of the dental cement, and measure the volume with Archimedes' principle.\n\t\nIn brief, place the remaining dry dental cement in a cup filled with water, and weigh the water that overflows.\nUse the dental cement with the least shrinkage for all the protocols detailed below.\n2. Anesthesia, surgical implantation, viral injection, and dummy baseplating\nAnesthesia",
    "NOTE: The present report aims to optimize the surgery and baseplating procedure for the UCLA miniscope; therefore, it was assumed that the optimal viral titer for infecting the target brain regions was known. The methods for finding the optimal viral titer can be found in steps 1 to 5 of Resendez et al.8. Once the viral dilution has been optimized, surgical implantation can be initiated.\n\t\nPlace the mouse in an induction container and provide oxygen (100% at an airflow rate of 0.2 L/min). Preoxygenate the mouse for 5 to 10 min.\nAdminister 5% isoflurane mixed with 100% oxygen (airflow rate: 0.2 L/min) until the mouse starts to lose its balance and is eventually anesthetized.\nRemove the mouse from the induction chamber and inject atropine (0.04 mg/kg; subcutaneous injection), to prevent the accumulation of saliva and buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg; subcutaneous injection) as an analgesic.\nShave the mouse's head.\nWear a mask, sterile gown, and gloves. Prepare a sterile space and sterile surgical instruments for surgery. Stabilize the mouse's head (maintain anesthesia with 3 to 2.5% isoflurane during this step) on the stereotaxic apparatus. After the analgesic and anesthetic procedures, ensure that the ear bars securely stabilize the head. Provide thermal support.\nEnsure that the head is set in a straight position, sterilize the shaved head with betadine, and then spray the head with xylocaine (10%), a local analgesic.\nApply veterinary ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness.\n\t\tNOTE: Use ophthalmic ointment for eye protection during all anesthetic events to prevent ocular injury.\nTest the animal's deep pain reflex by pinching its hind paw. Once the animal shows no paw withdrawal reflex, proceed with surgical procedures.",
    "Make a small incision along the mid-sagittal plane of the skull (starting from approximately 2 mm anterior to the bregma and ending approximately 6 mm posterior to the bregma). Then, clean the connective tissue on the skull, and anchor three stainless steel screws onto the left frontal and interparietal bones.\n\t\t\nAt this point, reduce the isoflurane to 1-2%. Monitor the breathing rate during the whole surgical procedure. If the breathing rate is too slow (approximately 1/s, depending on the animal), decrease the concentration of isoflurane.\nExecute a craniotomy for the relay lens implantation under a surgical microscope or stereomicroscope by using a burr drill with a 0.7 mm tip diameter. Use a micro-drill to grab the burr drill bit and draw an outline of the intended circle area (the full thickness of the calvarium does not need to be penetrated).\n\t\tNOTE: The relay lens used in the present protocol had a diameter of 1.0 mm, a length ~ 9.0 mm a pitch of 1, and a working distance range of ~100 µm - 300 µm; therefore, the craniotomy had a diameter of 1.2 mm.\n\t\t\nGently deepen the outline until the dura is exposed.\nPrepare 3 mL of sterile saline in a 3 mL syringe and cool it in an ice bucket. Frequently rinse the exposed area with 0.1 mL of saline from the syringe to cool the area and prevent heat damage and hemorrhage.\nLightly pick and peel away the dura with a 27G needle.",
    "Put a marking on a 27 G blunt needle at 1 mm from the tip and use it to carefully aspirate the brain's cortex in order to create a window for lens implantation8,11,13,17 (Figure 2B1). If needed, make a blunt needle by grinding down the tip of a 27 G injection needle with sandpaper. Then, connect the needle to a syringe, connect the syringe to a tube, and connect the tube to a source of suction to create a vacuum.\n\t\tNOTE: The relay lens is blunt and will compress the brain tissue when it is placed into the deep brain area. Thus, aspiration of the cortex reduces tissue damage due to relay lens implantation. The cortex is approximately 1 mm thick in mice but is difficult to visualize under a stereomicroscope. The mark creates a landmark to allow the depth of the needle to be determined more precisely than with a stereomicroscope alone. In addition, one can determine whether the cortex region has been reached or passed depending on the resistance; the top portion of the cortex feels relatively soft, while the subcortical region feels dense. Therefore, once the texture begins to feel denser, stop the aspiration (Figure 2B3).\nPrepare 3 mL of sterile saline in a 3 mL syringe and cool it in an ice bucket. Rinse the area with saline to stop the bleeding and decrease the possibility of brain edema.\nAdeno-associated virus (AAV) injection",
    "NOTE: AAV9-syn-jGCaMP7s-WPRE was used in the present experiment. jGCaMP7s is a genetically encoded calcium indicator that emits green fluorescence3. Because the present study used a wild-type mouse as a subject, a viral vector was needed to transfect the neurons with the green-fluorescent calcium indicator gene and enable the expression. Researchers using transgenic mice expressing the green-fluorescent calcium indicator as their subjects can skip protocol 2.2.\n\t\nMount the inner needle of a 20 G intravenous (i.v.) catheter onto the stereotaxic arm and slowly puncture (~100 - 200 µm/min) the brain at the appropriate coordinates (the same coordinates used during relay lens implantation) (Figure 2B3).\nLower the microinjection needle at a speed of 100-200 µm/min into the ventral CA1 and infuse (~ 25 nL/min) 200 nL of the viral vector into the target region (-3.16 mm AP, 3.25 mm ML, and -3.50 mm DV from the bregma).\nWait for 10 min to allow the virus to diffuse and to minimize the back flow.\nWithdraw (~100-200 µm/min) the microinjection needle.\nRelay lens implantation\n\t\nDisinfect the relay lens with 75% alcohol10,16 and then rinse with pyrogen-free saline. Soak the lens in cold pyrogen-free saline until implantation.\n\t\tNOTE: A cold lens minimizes brain edema when placed into the brain.\nHold the relay lens using a micro bulldog clamp (Figure 2B3) whose teeth have been covered with heat-shrink tubing.\n\t\tNOTE: The bulldog clamp can firmly hold the lens without damaging it. Refer to Resendez et al.8 for the method to make the tubing-covered bulldog clamp.\nSlowly place (~100 - 200 µm/min) the relay lens on top of the target region (-3.16 mm AP, 3.50 mm ML, and -3.50 mm DV from the bregma) and stabilize it with dental cement.\nDummy baseplating",
    "NOTE: The purpose of \"dummy baseplating\" during the implantation surgery is to create a dental cement base in order to reduce the amount of dental cement that needs to be applied during the real baseplating procedure several weeks later. In this manner, the risk of a change in the volume of the dental cement is minimized.\n\t\nFasten the objective lens on the bottom of the miniscope and assemble the baseplate onto the miniscope (in this step, the assembly of the anchored objective lens, baseplate, and miniscope has not yet been placed over the mouse's skull).\nWrap 10 cm of paraffin film around the outside of the baseplate (Figure 4A).\nHold the miniscope with the stereotaxic arm probe using reusable adhesive clay.\nAlign the objective lens on top of the relay lens with as little space between the lenses as possible (Figure 4B).\nUse dental cement to secure the positioning of the baseplate (such that the cement touches only the paraffin film).\nWhen the dental cement has dried, remove the film.\nRemove the baseplate and the miniscope. The dental cement base is hollow (Figure 4B).\nTo protect the relay lens from daily activities and from being scratched by the mouse, seal the relay lens with some molding silicone rubber until the relay lens is covered, and cover the silicone rubber with a thin layer of dental cement (Figure 4B).\nDisengage the mouse from the stereotaxic instruments and place the mouse into a recovery chamber.\nInject carprofen (5 mg/kg; subcutaneous injection) or meloxicam (1 mg/kg; subcutaneous injection) for analgesia and ceftazidime (25 mg/kg; subcutaneous injection) to prevent infection.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of antibiotics is not an alternative to an aseptic technique. Perioperative antibiotics (i.e., ceftazidime) may be indicated in certain circumstances, such as long-duration surgeries or placement of chronic implants.",
    "Watch the animal until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nHouse mice individually and inject meloxicam (1 mg/kg; subcutaneous injection; q24h) for one week to relieve postsurgical pain. Check the animal every day after surgery to make sure that it is eating, drinking, and defecating normally.\nPerform baseplating after 3 or more weeks.\n3. Baseplating\nNOTE: Usually, the baseplating procedure (Figure 5) cannot be performed within 2-3 weeks of the initial procedure due to the recovery and viral incubation time. The induction procedures for baseplating are similar to those described in steps 2.1.1 to 2.1.8. However, baseplating is not an invasive procedure, and the animal requires only light sedation. Therefore, 0.8-1.2% isoflurane is sufficient, as long as the animal cannot move on the stereotaxic frame. In addition, relatively light isoflurane anesthesia can also help facilitate the expression of the fluorescence transients of neurons during monitoring8 (Supplementary video S2).\nCarefully cut the thin layer of the dental cement roof with a bone rongeur and remove the silicone rubber. Clean the surface of the relay lens with 75% alcohol.\nFasten a set screw beside the baseplate to fix it to the bottom of the miniscope (Figure 5A1).\n\tNOTE: The baseplate must be tightened securely under the bottom of the miniscope because the difference between a tightened and lightly fastened baseplate may cause an inconsistent distance.\nAdjust the focus slide to be approximately 2.7 - 3 mm from the main housing (Figure 5A2).\n\tNOTE: Although the length can be further adjusted during the baseplating procedure, fix it to approximately 2.7 mm, because simultaneously adjusting the miniscope length and the optimal length between the implanted relay lens and preanchored objective lens is very confusing.",
    "Connect the miniscope to the data acquisition board and plug it into a USB 3.0 (or higher version) port on a computer.\nRun the data acquisition software developed by the UCLA team.\nAdjust the exposure to 255, the gain to 64x, and the excitation LED to 5%. These settings are recommended for initial baseplating; the specific settings will vary depending on the brain regions and the expression levels of the genetically encoded calcium indicator.\nClick the Connect button to connect the miniscope to the data acquisition software and watch the livestream.\nAlign the miniscope objective lens to the relay lens by hand and begin searching for the fluorescence signals (Figure 5B1).\n\tNOTE: Initially, searching for the fluorescence signal manually facilitates adjustments. Because an AAV system was used to express the genetically encoded calcium indicator, both the promoter type and AAV serotype affected the efficiency of transfection23,24. Researchers should need to check the expression of the calcium indicator by finding individual neurons that show changes in fluorescence before proceeding with future experiments.\nDrill the dental cement in any place where it blocks the miniscope (optional).\nWatch the live stream of the data acquisition software and use the margin of the relay lens as a landmark (Supplementary video S2). The margin of the relay lens appears as a moon-like gray circle on the monitor (Figure 5B1; white arrows).\nOnce the relay lens is found, carefully adjust the various angles and distances of the miniscope until the fluorescence signals are found.",
    "NOTE: The images of the neurons are whiter than the background. A precise neuronal shape indicates that the neurons lie perfectly on the focal plane of the relay lens. Round neurons suggest that they were near the focal plane. The neuronal shape is different across the brain, here ventral CA1 is shown as an example.\nIf no individual neuron displays changes in fluorescence as a function of time, reseal the base with silicone rubber. Fluorescence is not observed because the incubation period is also dependent on the property of the virus23,24. Perform steps 3.1-3.12 after an additional week. (This is optional).\nHold the miniscope at the optimal position and move the stereotaxic arm with a reusable adhesive clay towards the miniscope (Figure 5B2). Adhere the miniscope to the stereotaxic arm with reusable adhesive clay.\nSlightly adjust the x, y, and z arms to search for the best view (Supplementary video S2). Next, adjust the angle between the surface of the objective lens and relay lens by turning the ear bar, tooth bar, or reusable adhesive clay on the z-axis. Viral expression and lens implantation is successful when at least one cell displays fluorescence transients (Figure 6A; Supplementary video S2) during baseplating (which also depends on the area of the brain, such as the CA1).\n\tNOTE: If the monitor shows only white cells but no transients, there is another cause (see Figure 6B,C, Supplementary videos S4,S5, the Results section, and the troubleshooting section).\nCement the baseplate (Figure 5B2) with the dental cement.\nMonitor the region of interest during cementing to ensure that the optimal position does not change.",
    "Use the smallest possible amount of cement while still firmly gluing the baseplate onto the dental cement base (Figure 5B2). Apply a second and third layer of cement around the baseplate but be careful not to affect the GRIN lens.\n\tNOTE: Applying cement to the baseplate is easier in this step since the base of the baseplate was formed during the dummy plating procedure.\nCarefully detach the miniscope from the baseplate when the cement is cured. Then, screw on a protective cap.\nMove the animal to a recovery cage. Watch the animal until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nHouse mice individually. Make sure that it is eating, drinking, and defecating normally every day. Wait for 5 days for the mouse to fully recover and then check the calcium imaging.\n\tNOTE: There is only a small amount of dental cement holding the baseplate. Therefore, if the baseplate has shifted considerably since the baseplating procedure, remove the dental cement with a drill perform the baseplating procedure again.\nAnesthetize (by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (87 mg/kg) /xylazine (13 mg/kg) mixture) and perfuse25 the animal when all experiments are done.\nSubscription Required.
