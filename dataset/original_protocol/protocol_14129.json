    "1. Organ Culture\nPreparations\nPrepare agar solution as follows. In a small flask, prepare 1% agar and 1 mg/mL bovine collagen in DMEM-F12 up to 20 mL. Bring to boil on a hot plate. Put the solution into a 50 mL conical tube. Place tube in a water bath on a hot plate to keep the solution from solidifying.\nPrepare supplemented serum-free media (SSFM) as per the composition provided in the Table of Materials.\nNOTE: The necessary amount of SSFM to be prepared depends on the number of corneas to be processed. Usually 30 mL is enough media for 4 corneas.\nDissection\nNOTE: Perform this step in a dissection hood or a chemical hood. The eyes are shipped with lids still attached in individual bags to protect the globes.\n\t\nRemove globes from lids with a straight-edge surgical blade on an ethanol-cleaned chopping board. Remove excess fatty tissue from the eye using either a blade or a small scissors (Figure 3A, 3B).\nAfter removing the globe from the lid, hold the globe posteriorly with forceps and immediately dip the eye in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Quickly dip it 3x in 10% iodine (in a 100 mL beaker). Quickly dip 2x in PBS (~100 mL in a beaker, change PBS frequently).\nUsing a clean towel or tissue, wrap the eye circumferentially with enough pressure to have a taut corneal surface to cut with the trephine.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to prevent the towel or tissue from contacting the cornea.\nWounding\nUse a 6 mm trephine to wound the center of the cornea. Penetrate the epithelium and anterior stroma without making a full-thickness wound through the entire cornea.\nNOTE: If the endothelium is penetrated, a loss of pressure and leaking fluid will be seen. In this case the eye should be discarded.",
    "Place the trephine in the center of the cornea, rotate it 180° clockwise and counter-clockwise 5x (each time the direction is changed it will count as one time) while applying light pressure to deepen the wound.\nNOTE: The wound should now be deep enough to allow a tissue flap to be lifted using a pair of forceps. If this is not the case repeat step 1.3.2.\nLift the flap from the edges. At the same time, either with the other hand or with a second person, use a blade, cutting parallel to the globe to cut away the tissue as the forceps continue to lift off the anterior cornea within the wound margin. At the conclusion of this step there should be a circular wound located at the center of the cornea (See Figure 3C, 3D).\nCutting and Removing the Cornea from the Globe\nHolding the eye with the tissue, make a small incision 1 mm away from the edge of the cornea with a blade so that the limbus is included in the organ culture.\nUsing small, sharp scissors access the incision created in the prior step to cut around the globe, keeping a millimeter margin throughout the cornea to keep the limbus intact.\nPlace the cornea in a 60 mm dish with 1 mL of PBS, wound side down until mounting.\nMounting\nMake sure the agar has come to a warm temperature (approximately 25 °C).\nWith two pairs of forceps, create a cup by holding two sides of the cornea with the endothelial side up. Add the warmed-up agar solution into the cornea using a sterile transfer pipette until it is full.\nAfter the agar hardens (usually about 30-45 s) carefully flip the cornea with the agar into 60 mm plate (Figure 3E). Cover with a lid.\nIncubation",
    "Add 4 mL of SSFM to the plate, maintaining corneas at an air-liquid interface at the limbal border in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Refresh media after 24 h and thereafter every other day.\nNOTE: If performing a transfection into the wound, omit the antibiotics until after transfection.\nWet the corneal surface once daily by adding 1 drop of SSFM from the conditioned media in the dish to maintain moisture. For this, take the dish out of the incubator, place it under the hood, remove the dish lid, wet the surface with media from dish using a sterile pipette, cover again and put it back at the incubator.\nFor gene knockdown, treat the wound with gene-targeting or control siRNA that is complexed to a lipid-mediated carrier as per the supplier's instructions (see below).\nMix 5 µL (50 pmol) of siRNA into 50 µL of reduced-serum minimum essential media (e.g., Opti-MEM). Mix 2 µL of transfection reagent into 50 µL of reduced-serum media. Let this sit for 5 min and then mix them.\nAdd 200 µL of reduced-serum minimum media to the reagent/siRNA mixture.\nPipette dropwise onto the wound and incubate for 3 h.\nWash out siRNA from corneal surface with media in the dish.Change the incubation media to SSFM + antibiotics (see the Table of Materials). Continue incubation as mentioned previously (steps 1.6.1-1.6.2).\n2. Histology: Paraffin Sections and Immunostaining\nPreparing the Tissue\nAfter a two-week incubation, if using some of the tissue for quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, before fixing, cut the cornea in half through the wound. Place this half or only ¼ (either is enough tissue) into stabilizing RNA-protect reagent.\nUsing a standard isolation kit, isolate RNA and perform qRT-PCR.\nNOTE: Alternatively, the wounded part only can be isolated and tested for gene expression.",
    "Place the other half of the cornea into tissue pathology cassettes and submerge in fixative (10% formalin) for 2-4 days at room temperature (RT).\nParaffin embed this half of the wounded cornea using standard techniques.\nNOTE: Orient the wounded cornea to ensure that the tissue sectioning will produce a cross-section of the cornea.\nImmunostaining using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)\nDay 1\nLabel slides properly using a pencil. De-paraffinize the tissue by placing slides into a jar with clearing agent (2 changes, 10 min each).\nRehydrate the tissue by transferring the slides into ethanol at decreasing concentrations (100%, 100%, 70%, 50%, dH2O, dH20, 5 min for each change).\nPerform antigen retrieval by microwaving the slides in a plastic jar with citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.4) for 5 min. First cycle 5 min at 50% power. Refill the jar with citrate buffer and repeat. Cool down for 10 min.\nWash 3x with PBS, 2 min each. Permeabilize tissue with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS 10 min at RT. Block sections with 3% normal goat serum (NGS) for 1 h at RT in humid chamber.\nIncubate tissue with primary antibody (1:100 or as the supplier suggests) in 3% NGS overnight at 4 °C (300 µL per slide).\nDay 2\nRinse slides 3x with PBST (PBS plus 1% Tween 20), 2 min each. Place slides in 3% H2O2 for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase. Wash 3x with PBST, 2 min each. Incubate sections with HRP secondary antibody (1:250) in 3% NGS for 1 h at RT (300 µL per slide).\nWash slides 3x PBST, 2 min each. Treat slides with the DAB kit. Add 300 µL/slide for 3 min. Wash slides with dH2O 2x (quick dips).",
    "Counterstain with Hematoxylin for 20 s. Wash the slide with dH2O 2x (quick dips). Stain with bluing agent for 20 s. Rinse in dH2O for 20 s. Dehydrate tissue by placing slides into increasing concentrations of ethanol (50%, 70%, 100%, 100%, all quick dips).\nDry slides on a paper towel under the hood for 10-20 min.\nMount slides using 1 drop of mounting media, cover with coverslip. Label and store at RT.\nImage the slides under a microscope and quantify DAB signal with ImageJ7 (see section 4).\nImmunostaining: Fluorescence\nOn Day 1 follow steps described in step 2.2.1. Perform the following steps on Day 2.\nRinse slides 3x in PBST for 2 min each. Incubate sections with fluorophore-tagged secondary antibody in 3% NGS (1:200) for 1 h at RT.\nWash 3x in PBST, 2 min each. Mount slides using 1 drop of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) mounting media and cover with a coverslip. Dry on paper towel under the hood for 30 min. Store in the dark at 4 °C until fluorescence imaging.\nQuantification using Image J\nDownload the \"Fiji\" version of ImageJ, which includes the necessary plugins for DAB staining quantification.\nOpen an image in Fiji and select Image → Color → Color Deconvolution.\nSelect \"H DAB\" as the stain and then click OK. Three new images will appear. Select the image that contains only DAB staining.\nTo quantify stromal staining only, use the ImageJ eraser function to remove the epithelium from the DAB image.\nSelect Analyze → Measure (or Ctrl + M) and record the value.\nSubscription Required.
