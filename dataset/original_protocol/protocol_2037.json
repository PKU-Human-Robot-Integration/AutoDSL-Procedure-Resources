    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare embryos for injection\nTiming: 10 min\nRemove embryonic chorion.\nCollect embryos at 10–11 hpf (Kimmel et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and move to a 60 mm dish.\nPrepare 0.3 mg/mL Pronase solution by adding 50 μL 30 mg/mL Pronase (recipe above) to 5 mL egg water. Mix thoroughly.\nIncubate embryos in 5 mL Pronase solution for 5 min at room temperature in a 60 mm dish. Gently agitate the plate every 1–2 min to facilitate chorion removal.\nRemove Pronase solution and gently wash embryos with 28.5°C egg water 3–5 times to rinse excess Pronase and ensure embryo detachment from the chorion.\nTransfer embryos to 1% agarose pad. Keep embryos at 28.5°C until ready to proceed with step 15 below.\nCollect SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells\nTiming: 30 min\nPrepare SK-N-AS cells as a single-cell suspension for injection.\nNote: Prior to injection, cells should be approximately 75% confluent in a 6-well plate.\nRemove media from cells and rinse with 2 mL cell culture-grade PBS prewarmed to 37°C.\nAdd 300 μL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and ensure the entire surface of the well is coated evenly.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1–2 min.\nMonitor for cell detachment under an inverted microscope. Gentle tapping on the underside of the plate may help remove the monolayer, though excessive shaking should be avoided to minimize cell clumping.\nAdd 3 mL DMEM + 10% FBS to suspended cells, aspirate into a sterile collection tube, and spin down at 168 × g for 2 min.\nCarefully remove supernatant, resuspend cells in 1 mL of DMEM only (no FBS), and transfer to a 1.5 mL tube. Incubate at 37°C for 20–30 min until cells settle at the bottom of the tube.",
    "Note: If cells are not settling, you can also spin them down briefly (168 × g, 1 min) prior to injection.\nSet up microinjector\nTiming: 5 min\nThese steps describe setting up a Nanoject III microinjection apparatus but are broadly applicable.\nNote: The microinjector can be prepared at any point during this protocol.\nNote: Injection needles are created from capillaries using a micropipette puller. We used Sutter Instrument’s P-87 model with the following unitless parameter values: heat: 475; pull: 70; velocity: 50; time: 80.\nView pulled capillaries at high magnification with a microscope and snap with No. 5 forceps at a 45° angle. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D; Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: The optimal needle diameter will depend on the specific cells of interest and should be customized accordingly. The opening should be just wide enough to allow smooth passage of individual cells during injection but small enough to avoid major damage to the embryo (see Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]). In our experience, injection (as described below) yields a survival rate of approximately 90% within the first hour, after which embryo survival is comparable to uninjected controls.\nFill needle completely with mineral oil to eliminate the presence of air that would prevent a seal between the microinjector and needle. Attach needle to the microinjector probe, ensuring that the collet is tightened to obtain a tight seal.\nEject approximately half the mineral oil from the needle and ensure there are no air bubbles. Monitor needle briefly for excess mineral oil dripping from the end of the needle. If the seal is adequate, mineral oil will not accumulate.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Cutting the injection needle (step 12)\nEmbed embryos for injection\nTiming: 30–45 min\nTransfer 2 mL 0.9% LMA to a 40°C heating block.",
    "Aspirate 10–15 embryos into a glass pipette. Allow embryos to settle near the bottom of the pipette to displace egg water, then gently dispense into prewarmed LMA.\nNote: We recommend coating the glass pipette with 0.9% LMA prior to this step to decrease the risk of embryos sticking to it.\nAspirate LMA-coated embryos and deposit into a 100 mm petri dish. Evenly spread the 0.9% LMA into an area measuring roughly 15–20 mm by 10–15 mm to create an agarose pad.\nOrient embryos rapidly before the 0.9% LMA solidifies: To inject into the midst of migrating neural crest cells, embryos are positioned with their anterior aspect to the left, the dorsal side of the head at the top, and slightly tilted such that the left side of the embryo is angled up to facilitate injections. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A; Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1630-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Embryo injection and imaging orientations\n(A) 11 hpf zebrafish embryo embedded in 0.9% low melt agarose prior to injection. Arrow indicates the injection site.\n(B) Schematic depicting embryo embedding for inverted confocal imaging; the region of interest is positioned toward the base of the mold (arrow). MC, methylcellulose; LMA, low melt agarose. Scale bar: 200 μm.\nRepeat steps 16–18 until the desired number of embryos has been mounted.\nNote: A 100 mm petri dish can fit 6–8 pads of embryos depending on the volume of LMA used.\nIncubate agarose pads at room temperature for 3–5 min and then at 4°C for 2 min.\nOnce solidified, add egg water to keep the embedded embryos and 0.9% LMA hydrated during injection.",
    "Note: With experience, we have embedded up to 40 embryos within a single agarose pad and generated 4–6 pads per dish, resulting in approximately 200 embryos available for injection per dish. However, we recommend starting with 6–8 embryos per pad to practice proper mounting and injection timing.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Embryo mounting prior to injection (step 18)\nInject cells into embryos\nTiming: 30–60 min\nAspirate 50 μL of cells (from step 11) and place into a 30 mm petri dish. Pipette the droplet up and down to mix and minimize cell clumping.\nAllow cells to settle on the bottom of the dish for 3–5 min.\nAspirate cells into the injection needle (see Troubleshooting problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nWe recommend aspirating a small volume of media before collecting the cells to provide a buffer between the cells and mineral oil.\nWhen aspirating, bring the needle close to the bottom of the dish to obtain settled cells.\nNote: Cell density is important for this step to ensure consistency in the number of cells that are injected into each embryo. Using the parameters described in this protocol, we inject 5–10 cells per embryo.\nPosition embryos under the microscope. Ensure that cells are flowing through the needle by expelling a small volume into the egg water.\nSet microinjector to inject 1 nL at a rate of 8 nL/s. The injection volume can be decreased according to cell density but should not exceed 1 nL per embryo (see Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nPosition the needle just posterior to the developing eye, medial to the yolk/embryo interface.\nUse a combination of moving the needle on the microinjector and your hands to move the plate to puncture embryos at the appropriate depth (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).",
    "Note: You will cause a depression in the embryo as the needle starts to advance. Once the needle enters the embryo, it will relax. At this point, you may need to retract the needle slightly to position at the region of interest and not within the yolk (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nOnce at the desired depth, inject the cells. (See Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nOptional: To inject into neural crest cells, we recommend the use of Tg(-4.9sox10:eGFP)-positive embryos (labeling neural crest cells with eGFP) for subsequent imaging, as described below. At this stage, you can view injected embryos under a fluorescence microscope to determine if cells were injected into the desired location(s) relative to eGFP-positive cells.\nOnce all mounted embryos have been injected, proceed to the recovery stage. This point marks 0 h post-injection (0 hpi). (See Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Injection of NB cells into zebrafish embryos (step 27)\nEmbryo recovery and live imaging\nTiming: 1–16 h\nRemove embryos from LMA.\nUse a pair of No. 5 forceps to scrape away LMA as shown in Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5].\nAspirate embryos with a glass pipette and transfer to fresh egg water on top of a 1% agarose pad.\nCritical: All agarose must be removed prior to aspirating, or the remaining agarose can damage the embryos.\nAllow embryos to recover for 1 h at 28.5°C prior to proceeding with downstream applications.\nSelect embryos for imaging.\nDiscard visibly damaged embryos.\nStage embryos to confirm normal development and use a fluorescence microscope to select healthy embryos that harbor mCherry-positive NB cells in the desired anatomical location(s).\nMount embryos for imaging (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPrepare 1 mL of 0.3% LMA working solution (1:3 dilution of 0.9% LMA in 30% Danieau solution + 1.5× tricaine) and prewarm to 32°C.",
    "Add 500 μL of prewarmed 0.3% LMA working solution onto the embryo imaging mold.\nAspirate up to 12 embryos with a glass pipette, allow to settle near the bottom of the pipette, then drop into the remaining 500 μL 0.3% LMA working solution in the tube.\nTransfer embryos and remaining solution onto the embryo imaging mold.\nFor an inverted microscope, position embryos so that the region of interest is adjacent to the bottom of the imaging cassette. Remove any excess 0.3% LMA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nIncubate imaging cassette at 4°C for 5–10 min to allow the 0.3% LMA to solidify.\nAdd 2 mL of 32°C methylcellulose mounting solution on top of the solidified 0.3% LMA.\nNote: Experimental treatments can be added to the LMA and/or the overlying methylcellulose. Please see (Treffy et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) for examples.\nIncubate embryos at 32°C for 30 min prior to imaging, as the embryos may drift slightly as the LMA warms and embryos settle. Recheck orientation before beginning imaging session and adjust z-stack acquisition settings as necessary.\nObtain z-stacks with a 40×/1.1 W objective over 11–14 h, with the incubation chamber maintained at 32°C.\nNote: We prioritized our imaging settings to yield rapid z-stacks (2.5 min per embryo) across 12 embryos, resulting in 30-minute time intervals for each embryo. All data collation, segmentation, and analysis were performed using Bitplane’s Imaris software. These choices can be adjusted as desired for specific experimental goals.\nNote: Please see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for a detailed explanation of temperature changes throughout the protocol.",
    "Note: Upon injection of 5–10 cells, we reliably obtain live imaging of 3–8 cells. Due to the low density of injected cells, clumping is not an issue in the embryo. Cells that have entered a neural crest migratory stream travel as individual cells and are clearly distinguishable (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]; also see Treffy et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).
