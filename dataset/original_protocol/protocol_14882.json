    "NOTE: All experimental protocols adhered to the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Committee of the Universidad Complutense (following EU directives 86/609/CEE and 2003/65/CE).\n1. Cerebral Ischemia Model\nNOTE: The cerebral ischemia model in this paper involves permanent or transient occlusion of both CCA (common carotid artery) and MCA (middle cerebral artery) by ligation with a nylon suture.\nPre-surgical preparations\n\t\nSterilize all surgical instruments by autoclaving or with a glass bead sterilizer. Disinfect the surgical area with 70% ethanol as well.\nAnesthetize mouse with appropriate anesthetics. Achieve induction by isoflurane 2.5% and maintain with by isoflurane 1.5% in a mixture of 80% air / 20% oxygen using a vaporizer. Apply artificial tears to the mice eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad that is linked to a feedback device with a temperature probe placed in the rectum and set temperature at physiological levels (36.5 ± 0.5 ºC) during the surgical procedure.\nCommon carotid artery occlusion by ligation\n\t\nPlace the mouse in dorsal recumbency and immobilize with tape. Disinfect skin with 70% ethanol or povidone-iodide and cut the hair of the upper ventral part.\nUnder a surgical microscope, make a 1 cm midline incision around the ventral surface of the neck.\nPull apart all soft tissues (glandular tissue including sub-maxillary, sublingual and parotid glands) and identify the left Common Carotid Artery (CCA), which is localized lateral to the trachea. Retract the muscles and expose left CCA. Carefully dissect from vagus nerve.\nOnce dissected, occlude the left CCA by a ligature using a 6/0 nylon suture. Ligate with a permanent knot or a slipknot (to allow reperfusion if a transient cerebral ischemia model is desired).\nPlace the glandular tissue into its original position and close the incision on the neck skin with a 6/0 nylon suture.",
    "NOTE: Sham animals are subjected to the same surgical procedure as MCAO animals but the CCA is not occluded.\nDistal middle cerebral artery occlusion by ligation\n\t\nPosition the mouse on its right side and immobilize with tape. Disinfect the head skin with 70% ethanol or povidone-iodide and cut the hair of the mouse head (remove hair after cutting).\nUnder a surgical microscope, make a skin incision between the eye and the ear. Move the skin away and hold it with tape.\nMake a horizontal incision on the temporal muscle from the right to the left. Then, make a second vertical incision on the right side of the temporal muscle (be careful to avoid cut temporal vein). Pull apart the temporal muscle from the skull and hold it with a suture to maintain a clean skull surface.\nClean the skull surface with cold sterile saline to detect the exact position of the left Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) via skull transparency. Perform a round craniotomy (1 mm in diameter) with a stainless steel burr in the frontal lobe between the zygomatic arch and the squamosal bone. Remove carefully the skull and expose the MCA.\nApply a small amount of cold sterile saline solution to the surface of the brain and remove the meninges (dura and arachnoid mater) by using forceps.\nPerform ligation of the left MCA in the distal trunk just before the bifurcation between the frontal and posterior MCA branches. Occlude the left MCA by a ligature using a 9/0 nylon suture. Ligate with a permanent knot or a slipknot (to allow reperfusion if a transient cerebral ischemia model is desired). The period of time between CCA and MCA occlusion is approximately 10-20 minutes depending on the operator's experience.",
    "Place the temporal muscle into its original position and close the incision on the neck skin with a 6/0 nylon suture.\nReturn the mouse to the cage to recover from the anesthesia (generally 5-10 min) and inject the mouse with buprenorphine intraperitoneal (I.P.) (0.3 mg/kg).\n\t\t\nMonitor the mouse for several hr to detect any discomfort (do not leave the mouse unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency). Since post-surgical weight lost is generally observed, place mashed food in a Petri dish to facilitate eating.\nWhen the animal is fully recovered, return to the company of other animals.\nIf a transient MCAO model is desired, anesthetize the mouse again and remove the slipknot of the CCA and the MCA to allow reperfusion (usually between 0.5-2 hr (Figure 1)).\n\t\tNOTE: Sham animals are subjected to the same surgical procedure as MCAO animals but the MCA is not occluded.\n2. Perfusion and Sectioning of Brain Tissue\n24 or 48 hr after MCAO, sacrifice the mouse with a lethal dose of anesthetic (e.g., sodium pentobarbital, I.P. 86 mg/kg or an overdose with isoflurane).\nPerfuse the mouse with phosphate buffer 0.1 M followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).\nRemove the brain as follows:\n\t\nDecapitate the animal just above the spinal cord.\nMake a posterior-anterior incision on the head's skin to expose the skull. Make two lateral cuts at the junction of the lateral walls and the base of the skull and remove the small piece of bone.\nMake a cut through the skull along the sagittal suture.\nRemove the skull overlying each hemisphere by using a forceps to expose the brain. Use a spatula to separate the brain from the skull and transfer it into 4% PFA solution.",
    "Post-fix for 3 hr in 4% PFA solution at 4 ºC.\nRemove PFA solution and incubate the brain for 48 hr in 30% sucrose solution to cryoprotect the brain.\nRemove sucrose solution and freeze the brain quickly in cold isopentane (-40 ºC). Store frozen brain at –80 ºC.\nObtain coronal brain sections (30 µm) with a freezing microtome. Collect ten serial sets in a cryopreservative solution. Each serial set is composed of around 14-16 coronal slices with an interslice distance of 300 μm which adequately sample the mouse brain between 1.94 and -2.46 posterior to bregma.\n3. Nissl Staining and Infarct Volume Estimation\nNissl staining by cresyl violet\n\t\nMount brain sections into a superfrost microscope slide. For infarct volume determination by the Cavalieri method in Nissl-stained sections, use a 1/20 slice-sampling fraction (1/2 sections of one of the ten serial sets collected in step 2.7; approximately, a total number of 7-8 sections with an interslice distance of 600 μm are used). Be careful to maintain proper anterior-posterior orientation (infarcted area is placed in the right side).\nPerform conventional Nissl staining as follows:\n\t\t\nAllow slide-mounted sections to dry for several hr.\nRehydrate slide-mounted sections and stain with 0.1% cresyl violet solution for 5 min.\nDehydrate with a graded series of EtOH (70%, 90%, and 100%; 5 min per change). Clean the slide-mounted sections with xylene, add distrene-80 plasticizer xylene (DPX) mounting media and cover with a glass coverslip.\nUsing stereological software to estimate the infarct volume by the Cavalieri method in Nissl-stained serial sections",
    "Use parameters shown in Table 1 to quantify infarct volume by the Cavalieri method14 and a stereology system, which consists of a microscope fitted with a camera, a XYZ motorized computer stage, and stereological software (The main directions provided below are related to PCs but the directions could differ for other operating systems).\nTurn on PC, microscope, stage controller and camera in the appropriate order. Start the stereological software.\nMove the 10X objective into place and select the 10X from the objective drop down menu.\nMove around the first Nissl-stained section and find a suitable reference point. Click the mouse to establish the reference point (to move around it is necessary to active the joy free button).\nEstimate the “mounted section thickness” (the actual section thickness taking into account the shrinkage). Press the “Focus Position Meter” button and calculate the thickness from the bottom to the top of the section.\nCreate a contour tool for the contralesional and ipsilesional areas and the infarcted area.\n\t\t\nClick on the menu “Display” and select “Display Settings”. This opens the Display Settings Dialog.\nSelect the “Contours” tab and click the button “add Contour type”.\nCreate a contour for each region to quantify and make them visible in the contour down menu. Click OK.\nCreate a Marker tool for the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres and the infarcted area.\n\t\t\nClick on the menu “Display” and select “Display Settings” to open the Display Settings dialog.\nSelect “Markers” tab and change the markers name by double clicking over the available markers. Make them visible in the Marker Bar. Click OK.\nActivate the section manager.\n\t\t\nClick on the menu “Tools/Serial Section Manager”. Add a new section with the “new section” button. This button opens the “Serial Section Setup dialog”.",
    "Set the “Block Advance” as 30 µm. Set the “mounted section thickness” with the value estimated in the step 3.2.5.\nSet the “Evaluation Interval” as 20. Use a 1/20 slice sampling fraction.\nSet “the starting section number” as 1. Set the “Z axis value for the top of the first section” as 0. Click OK.\nDraw a contour to outline the contralateral hemisphere.\n\t\t\nSelect the Contralesional hemisphere tool (previously created in the step 3.2.6) from the contour down menu.\nDraw a contour to outline the contralateral hemisphere.\nTo finish tracing the contralesional hemisphere, right click the mouse and select “close contour”.\nEstimate the contralesional hemisphere contour by Cavalieri.\n\t\t\nClick on the menu “Probes” and select Cavalieri Estimator. Set “Grid Spacing” as 100 µm. Set “Grid Rotation” as 0. Set the “Block Advance” as 30 µm. Click OK.\nSelect “The contralesional hemisphere” button from the Markers Bar. Right click inside of the Contralesional hemisphere contour.\nSelect “Paint Cavalieri Markers Mode”. Right click inside the contralesional hemisphere contour again and select “Paint Markers into Contour”.\nDeactivate Cavalieri Estimator by clicking on probes and Cavalieri Estimator and deactivate the contralesional marker button from the marker bar.\nRepeat the same procedure for the ipsilesional hemisphere and the infarcted area (steps 3.2.7 and 3.2.8). Save the data after the estimation of the area of each section.\nCalculate the contralateral, ipsilesional and infarcted areas in the rest of the Nissl-stained section.\n\t\t\nCreate a new section as in step 3.2.6. Do not modify the values entered in the “Serial section Setup” dialog.

Select “Display Probe Run List”. This opens the “Previous Stereological Runs Dialog”.",
    "Select all the sections by clicking over them. Press the “View Results” Button. This opens “the Cavalieri Estimator Results” where the estimated area and volume for each region are displayed.\nTo export the results to a spreadsheet file, click the “Copy all Results to Clipboard” and paste to an excel file with the main results obtained from each region (Table 2).\nExpress infarct volume as mm3 or as % of the hemisphere that is infarcted (%IH) using the formula15 %IH = InfVol/ContrVol*100, where\nInfVol (Infarcted Tissue Volume) = ΣInfAreai,\nContrVol (Contralesional Hemisphere Volume) = ΣContrAreai\n4. Stereological Quantification of Infiltrated Neutrophils After Cerebral Ischemia by the Optical Fractionator\nStaining of the brain sections:\n\t\nFor estimating the total number of infiltrated neutrophils after MCAO by the optical fractionator16, use a 1/10 slice sampling fraction. Immunostain neutrophils by using conventional immunofluorescence techniques with the rat anti-Ly6G antibody (1A8) and the right secondary antibody on free-floating sections. In addition, a counterstaining with a nuclear maker like DAPI or TOPRO, although it is not necessary for neutrophil identification, can make easier to detect the infarcted area.\nMount brain sections into a superfrost microscope slide with the infarcted area placed in the right side.\nQuantification of infiltrated leukocytes in the ischemic brain by the optical fractionator\n\t\nUse parameters shown in Table 3 to quantify infiltrated leukocytes in the ischemic brain by the optical fractionator approach with a stereology system.

Select “Display Probe Run List” to open the “Previous Stereological Runs“ dialog.\nSelect all the sections by clicking over them. Press the “View Results” Button to open “the Optical Fractionator Results” where the estimated number of neutrophils is displayed.\nExport the results to a spreadsheet file by clicking the “Copy all Results to Clipboard” and paste to a spreadsheet file.\n5. Brain Dissociation and Flow Cytometry Analysis\nNOTE: Myeloid subpopulation characterization by flow cytometry on fresh brain tissue can be used as an alternative to the previous neutrophil characterization performed on fixed and immunostained brain sections.\nBrain dissociation and single cell suspension preparation",
    "Make 10 ml/animal of a RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium)-Percoll solution containing 8 ml of RPMI, 1 ml of 30% Percoll and 1 ml of a 10x PBS (phosphate buffered saline).\nRemove mouse brain after MCAO as described in the step 2.3.\nUnder a microscope, dissect out core and peri-infarct areas of the ipsilateral cortex from brain ischemic mouse (or a similar region for sham and naïve animals) from the brain. Weight brain tissue and place it into 5 ml of ice-cold RPMI-Percoll (the weight step can be performed for normalization between experimental groups).\nDissociate the tissue in a single cell suspension using a Potter-Elvehjem-type tissue grinder with Teflon pestles.\nTransfer cell suspensions to a 50 ml ultracentrifuge tube and add 5 more ml of RPMI-Percoll solution to the samples.\nCentrifuge the cell suspensions at 7,800 x g for 30 min at 25 ºC. After centrifugation, ensure a white-colored layer corresponding to myelin appears at the top of the solution.\nRemove the myelin layer carefully and filter the whole cell suspensions, including the pelleted cells, through 40-µm nylon mesh strainer.\nAdd 10 ml of RPMI on the strainer to ensure that all the cells are filtered and place the solution in a 50 ml tube. Add 30 ml of RPMI and centrifuge the 50 ml of cell suspension at 600 x g for 10 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the leukocyte pellet with 1 ml of PBS. Add 4 ml of lysis buffer (150 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM NaHCO3 and 0.1 mM EDTA) and incubate the cells for 2-3 min at RT to lyse erythrocytes from the cell suspension. Centrifuge the solution at 600 x g for 10 min at 4 ºC.\nCell staining and flow cytometry",
    "Prepare a labeling cocktail for flow cytometry, containing 200 μl of PBS-BSA (1%) 1:100 Fc-Block, 1:40 anti-CD45-PercP rat, 1:40 anti-Ly6G-APC rat, 1:40 anti CD11b-FITC rat and 1:40 anti-Ly-6C-PE rat per sample.\nResuspend the cells in the labeling cocktail and incubate the samples for 45 min in ice.\nWash the labeling cocktail with 1 ml of cold PBS and centrifuge the cells at 600 x g for 10 min at 4 ºC. Resuspend the pellet with 100 µl of FACS Flow and acquire the entire cell suspension by flow cytometry.\nUse a flow cytometry analysis software to characterize and quantify cell populations.\n\t\t\nMain leukocyte subsets corresponding to the labeling cocktail prepared in this protocol can be characterized as follows: CD45loCD11b+: resident microglial cells; CD45hiCD11b+Ly-6G+: neutrophils; CD45hiCD11b+Ly-6G-Ly-6Chi: pro-inflammatory monocytes."
