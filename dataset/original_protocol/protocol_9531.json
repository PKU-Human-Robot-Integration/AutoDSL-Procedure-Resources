    "1. Preparation of Buffers\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)\nDilute 50 ml of 10x PBS with 450 ml HPLC grade water to make a 1x PBS concentration. Sterile filter the solution with a 0.22 µm filter.\nStore solution at room temperature.\nPreparation of Tris Buffered Saline + Tween 20 (TBST)\nDilute 50 ml of 10x Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) with 450 ml HPLC grade water to make a 1x concentration. Add 250 μl of Tween-20 for a 0.05% (v/v) of Tween-20. Sterile filter the solution with a 0.22 μm filter.\nStore at room temperature.\nPreparation of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) Blocking Solution\nWeigh 0.45 g of HSA into 15 ml of sterile filtered 1x PBS to make a 3% w/v HSA solution. Vortex solution until HSA is fully dissolved.\nStore HSA solution at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) can also be used as a blocking solution.\nPreparation of PEGylated antibody (PEG-Ab) solution\n\tNOTE: The antibody solution must be free from carrier or stabilizing proteins such as BSA, which would interfere with conjugation reactions by competing for the n-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) binding sites. If the antibody comes in a Tris or glycine buffer solution, it must undergo a buffer exchange to prevent amines or ammonium salts from interfering with the NHS conjugation reaction. If the antibody is in a lyophilized form, it can be resuspended according to the manufacturer's recommendation at a concentration of 1-10 mg/ml.\n\t\nFor antibodies in a Tris or glycine buffer, perform a buffer exchange to 100 mM sodium bicarbonate using a desalting column. Use the 100 mM buffer to raise the pH to approximately 8.5 to speed up the conjugation reaction.\nHydrate ortho-pyridyl disulfide-PEG-NHS (OPSS-PEG-NHS) with 100 mM sodium bicarbonate to a volume of 1 ml at a concentration of 1 mg/ml or greater.",
    "NOTE: OPSS-PEG-NHS should be made fresh and used within approximately 20 min. The NHS group on the OPSS-PEG-NHS has a half-life of approximately 20 min in an aqueous solution at pH 8.5.\nAdd OPSS-PEG-NHS to the antibody solution at a 2:1 ratio (PEG: Antibody) conjugation ratio to be used for the test samples. In a separate microcentrifuge tube, add OPSS-PEG-NHS to the antigen solution at a 2:1 conjugation ratio to be used for the control.\n\t\tNOTE: The 2:1 ratio is assuming a 50% conjugation efficiency. The objective is to label each antibody with one PEG chain. In this step, over-labeling is better than under-labeling. Use the following equation to determine the appropriate volumes of OPSS-PEG-NHS and antibody solution:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54795/54795eq_2.jpg\n\t\twhere V is volume, C is concentration expressed in molecules or antibodies per ml. Subscripts PEG and Ab are OPSS-PEG-NHS and antibody, respectively. The final volume should be approximately 250 μl.\nIncubate PEG-Ab solution at 4 °C for 8 hr or overnight. Store solution in working aliquots of approximately 25 μl at -20 °C to limit the freeze thaw cycles and make sure to use low binding tubes.\n2. Prepare UV-Vis/Raman Probes\nPrepare bare AuNP solution\nPrepare a 2 ml solution of AuNPs with a concentration of approximately 1 x 1011 particles per ml.\n\t\t\nIf the AuNPs need to be concentrated, fill low binding centrifuge tubes with 2,000 μl of stock AuNP and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 20 min or until the supernatant is clear. Remove the supernatant by pipetting, being careful not to disturb the AuNP pellet.\nCombine the remaining AuNP solutions into one tube and estimate the concentration by obtaining a UV-Vis measurement and comparing values to known concentrations as this is a linear relationship.\nDetermine the appropriate Raman reporter labeling ratio",
    "Prepare a working solution of the Raman reporter dissolved in methanol. This concentration will be dependent on the reporter used. In this work, prepare 3,3′-diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DTTC) at a working solution of 200 μM.\nAssuming a final volume of 100 μl for each well, add enough of the working reporter solution to each well of the first row of a 96-well plate such that the Raman reporter will range in concentrations from 0.2 μM to 10 μM. Add enough HPLC grade water to each well such that the volume is 80 μl. Add 20 μl of AuNP to each well making a final volume of 100 μl for each well. An example is provided in Table 1.\nMeasure the UV-Vis spectra from 400 to 700 nm using a plate-reading UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The appropriate concentration is the highest concentration with defined peaks for the UV-Vis spectra. Repeat step 2.2.2 at increasing concentrations until the highest concentration ratio of Raman reporters to AuNPs is found.\n\t\tNOTE: The dye and the AuNP shape, size, and manufacturer influence the appropriate concentration. Therefore, the steps listed must be evaluated and altered depending on the components used. This protocol involved the use of a positively charged dye. As such, binding between the AuNP and reporter was improved by using negatively charged AuNPs. This was done by using citrate capped AuNPs. See the Discussion section for further details.\nBinding Raman reporter and PEG-Ab to AuNP\nPrepare two 1.5 ml batches of AuNP and Raman reporter at the previously determined concentration, allowing the Raman reporter to bind to the AuNPs for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Add the PEGylated antibody (PEG-Ab) to one batch of the AuNP and Raman reporter solution to create a 200:1 ratio of antibodies to particles. This solution will be for the test samples. In a separate microcentrifuge tube, add the PEGylated antigen to the other batch of the AuNP and Raman reporter solution at a 200:1 ratio of antibody to particles to be used as the control. Incubate the solutions for 30 min at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The ratio of antibodies to particles will be specific to the AuNPs and dye used and should be optimized for each individual case. The objective here is to have the highest ratio of antibodies for the AuNP probes to bind to while preventing aggregation of the particles. Use the following equation to determine the appropriate volumes to add together:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54795/54795eq_200.jpg\n\t\twhere V is volume, C is concentration expressed in particles or antibodies per ml. The final volume should be approximately 1.5 ml.\nBlock remaining sites on the AuNP surface with mPEG-SH.\nPrepare mPEG-SH by dissolving solid methoxy polyethylene glycol thiol to a 200 μM concentration using water. Vortex the solution until mPEG-SH is completely dissolved.\nAdd mPEG-SH at a 40,000:1 ratio to the AuNP-PEG-Ab solution made in step 2.3. Incubate the solution at room temperature for 10 min to ensure the remaining sites on the gold nanoparticle are blocked. Use the following equation to determine the appropriate volumes to add together:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54795/54795eq_40000.jpg\n\t\twhere V is volume, C is concentration expressed in particles or antibodies per ml. The final volume should be approximately 1.5 ml.\nRecover functionalized Raman probes.\nCentrifuge particles at 5,000 x g for 20 min in low bind centrifuge tubes or until the supernatant is clear. Remove the supernatant by pipetting being careful not to disturb the AuNPs.",
    "Resuspend the particles with 1 ml of 1x PBS solution that was made previously. Estimate the AuNP concentration by taking a UV-Vis measurement of a small volume of solution (3 μl) and compare the results to measurements from a known AuNP concentration. Adjust the volume such that the final solution is at least 1 x 1011 particles per ml.\nStore solutions at 4 °C until it is used for functionalizing of the immunoassay plate. Use the solutions within one week.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\n,Volumes to add of each component (ml),Volumes to add of each component (ml),Volumes to add of each component (ml)\nDTTC final concentration (mM),DTTC working solution (200 mM),AuNP,Water\n0.2,0.1,20,79.9\n0.6,0.3,20,79.7\n1,0.5,20,79.5\n2,1.0,20,79\n5,2.5,20,77.5\n7,3.5,20,76.5\n10,5.0,20,75\nTable 1. DTTC dilution example. Various dilutions of DTTC and the associated volumes of stock DTTC, gold nanoparticle solution, and water.\n3. Immunoassay Plate Preparation\nBind desired antigen to the immunoassay plate.\nPrepare enough diluted antigen (50 μg/ml) to fill the polystyrene wells. Vortex the solution, and immediately add the solution to the plate wells. Allow the antigen to bind to the plates for 1 hr at room temperature.\nWash off unbound antigens.\nRemove the excess antigen solution by dumping solution into a disposal container and hitting the plate against a paper-towel-covered tabletop.\nAdd TBST to the wells to wash the surface then remove the wash in the same manner as stated previously. Repeat this step two more times.\nBlock remaining binding sites on the plate to prevent non-specific binding.\nAdd 70 μl of HSA blocking solution to each well of the plate and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nRemove and rinse the plate using the same procedure as specified in step 3.2. Cover the plate and store dry at 4 °C until ready for further use.\nFunctionalize immunoassay plate.",
    "Add 70 μl of the probe nanoparticles prepared in Section 2 to the first column of a 96-well plate and dilute subsequent columns using a 1:2 serial dilution. Allow the plate to incubate for at least 1 hr. An example of how to prepare the immunoassay plate is given in Figure 3.\nWash the plate with TBST five times as detailed in steps 3.2, making sure to dispose of the AuNPs appropriately. After the final wash, add 70 μl of 1x PBS to each well and cover with a plate seal.\n\t\tNOTE: The control samples should be clear. If non-specific binding has occurred, the control samples will have a similar color as the test samples.\nTest assay sensitivity by UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy.\nFor each well, measure the UV-Vis spectra ranging from 400 to 700 nm using a plate-reading UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nUsing an inverted Raman microscope, focus the objective onto the surface of the well that has the AuNP probes. Obtain a Raman spectra of the well. Collect a spectrum ranging from 1,800 cm-1 to 400 cm-1. Repeat this step for all wells.\nUsing an appropriate spectral software, perform an 11th order polynomial baseline correction for the Raman spectra and a 3rd order polynomial for the UV-Vis spectra.\nUsing an appropriate spectral software, normalize the Raman and UV-Vis spectra. Set the maximum value to 1 and scale all other values accordingly. To normalize the Raman spectra, select a unique polystyrene peak and set it equal to 1 and scale all other values accordingly.",
    "Using an appropriate spectral software, perform peak integration for each spectrum. For Raman spectra, the peak representing the Raman reporter must be in a region absent of polystyrene peaks. To perform peak integration, specify the integral boundaries for the desired peak and record the desired peak area for all samples including the controls.\nPlot the average peak area of interest as a function of the log of the AuNP concentration with error bars for each point indicating its associated standard deviation. Fit these calibration points to a 4-parameter logistic curve.\nDetermine the mean value of the blank by averaging the area of the peak of interest for a blank sample. Determine the standard deviation of these areas; this is the standard deviation of the blank.\nFor the same peak analyzed in the previous step, find the standard deviation of that peak area for the lowest concentration.\nCalculate the limit of the blank and lower limit of detection as specified in the Representative results section. Use these values with the 4PL calibration curves to determine the LLOD in terms of AuNP concentration.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
