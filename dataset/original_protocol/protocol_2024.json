    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOrganoid cell staining\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step is to stain the dead intestinal organoid cells; propidium iodide (PI) is cell impermeable and therefore only stains dead cells. Dead cells within the intestinal organoid lumen are shielded from PI by the intestinal monolayer, and thus will not be stained by PI without an increase in organoid permeability (Bode et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nMix PI solution (5 mg/mL stock) in pre-warmed intestinal organoid growth medium with a final concentration of 5 μg/mL PI.\nReplace existing media from the well with the media with PI, and incubate at 37°C for 20 min.\nNote: PI (and HOECHST) are added to intestinal organoid growth medium rather than PBS to maintain organoid health.\nOptional: HOECHST can be used to stain alive and dead cells, since HOECHST is cell permeable. This is, however, not required to measure permeability, but can give an image of the entire intestinal organoid. HOECHST staining is toxic for intestinal organoids after prolonged exposure and therefore is not recommended in this protocol when measuring permeability for more than 12 h. When additionally staining with HOECHST, add HOECHST (5 mg/mL stock) to the pre-warmed intestinal organoid growth media with a final concentration of 5 μg/mL during step 1.\nOrganoid imaging and permeability analysis\nTiming: 1 day",
    "This step is to image the intestinal organoids in green (469–525 nm) and red (531–593 nm) channels to measure green background autofluorescence (AF) and PI respectively. By measuring PI stain within the organoid lumen at the same spot pre and post treatment, a toxin/compound’s effect on intestinal organoid permeability can be analyzed. The lumen of intestinal organoids can be defined by the green background AF of dead cells and other debris inside the organoid lumen (Bardenbacher et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The green background AF inside the lumen decreases with permeability, however, analyzing green background AF inside the lumen pre- and post- treatment was found to be less precise, and also more susceptible to bleaching and other processes (unrelated to permeability) that can interfere with this measurement compared to analyzing PI intensity inside the organoid lumen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1619-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustrations of expected EDTA treated intestinal organoids images\nIllustrations of bright field, HOECHST, green background autofluorescence (AF), and propidium iodide (PI) images of intestinal organoids treated with EDTA over time. In the PI images, the luminal areas of intestinal organoids are highlighted, which are made by selecting the luminal region in the green background AF. Analyzing PI stain over time in these luminal regions are indicative of organoid permeability.\nPlace the intestinal organoid plate into the Cytation 5 and image a Z stack of the intestinal organoids at 4× magnification in green 469–525 nm (luminal extruded dead cell debris) and red 531–593 nm (PI) channels for time point 0.\nNote: Imaging the organoids in focus can be difficult because of the 3D structure of organoids, therefore we recommend imaging a Z stack every time which can be stacked in Fiji and Z projected later to acquire a clear in-focus image of all the organoids.",
    "Optional: Bright field images can be taken during step 3.\nOptional: Imaging the blue (377–447 nm) channel is required during step 3 when also staining with HOECHST.\nAlternatives: An alternative automated fluorescent microscope, instead of the Cytation 5, that can image repeatedly on the same x-y-z axis can also be used (e.g., ImageXpress Nano Automated Imaging System), but requires optimization for this protocol.\nAdd the test toxin/compound(s), control (negative), EDTA (final concentration 2 mM, positive permeable control), and Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.5%, positive cell death control) to each single well with intestinal organoids.\nCollect a sample of medium (2 μL) for a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay before taking each image.\nPlace the intestinal organoid plate back into the Cytation 5 and image the intestinal organoids at the same spots in the same channels after treatment.\nNote: For the positive EDTA control, and positive Triton X-100 control imaging 150 min is sufficient to analyze permeability, however, longer measurement may be required before organoids become permeable, depending on the toxin/compound’s mode of action.\nDetermine degree of cell death by measuring LDH release.\nNote: The LDH assay, which measures LDH in the supernatant and is a marker for plasma membrane damage, allows this protocol to differentiate between increased permeability by cell death and increased permeability by decrease in intercellular junctions.\nAlternatives: A different cell death assay to LDH release can be used to analyze cell death in organoids, but needs optimization to work with 3D organoids.\nPause point: After the LDH release measurement (step 7) is a good pause point, since the following steps are analysis only and can therefore be performed at a later time once the images are acquired.\nOpen the green channel image of time point 0 as a stack in Fiji (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1619-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Screenshots from Fiji image capture\n“Z Project” the stack to get all organoids of the stack in focus (Image, Stacks, Z Project…, Max Intensity).\nSet the “Threshold” (Image, Adjust, Threshold) so that only green background AF of dead cell debris in the organoid lumen is selected.\nSelect this region of the binary image by “Create Selection” (Edit, Selection, Create Selection).\nOpen the red channel image of time point 0 as a stack in Fiji.\n“Z Project” the stack to get all organoids of the stack in focus (Image, Stacks, Z Project…, Max Intensity).\nPaste the previously selected region into this image (Control + Shift +E).\nMeasure the mean intensity of PI in this region by “Measure” (Analyze, Measure).\nOptional: Permeability can be measured at multiple time points by repeating steps 5–9 for multiple time points.\nOpen the other time points of the red channel and repeat step 9.\nCompare the mean intensity of PI stain of dead cells inside the selected organoid lumen of treated organoids to control (untreated) organoids.\nNote: By measuring mean PI intensity inside the selected organoid lumens at time point 0 the size and number of organoids are normalized and are equalized at time point 0. By comparing treated to control luminal mean PI intensity after treatment time any change in background fluorescence is accounted for. When analyzing data after a pre-selected time point a parametric/non-parametric test can be used, e.g., t-test or ANOVA.\nAlternatives: The ratio of luminal mean PI intensity after treatment to time point 0 can also be used to compare treated to control organoids for permeability."
