    "This study was conducted at the Medical School Teaching Facility (MSTF, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA), which is accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science. The study protocol was approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Animal selection and housing\nUse adult male swine (Sus Scrofa) weighing 60-80 kg.\nFollowing arrival to the animal facility, house the animals one per cage but with ability to interact with animals in the neighboring cages.\nHouse the animals for a minimum of 48 hours to assure acclimatization. Allow the animals free access to water and feed them a standard diet until the night before the experiment when the animals should be fasted to minimize the risk of aspiration during intubation.\nMonitor the animals regularly to confirm that they are in good health.\n2. Sedation and induction of general anesthesia\nSedate the animal while it is still in its housing area by intramuscular injection of Telazol (4-5 mg/kg)/xylazine (1.8-2.2 mg/kg) caudal to the ear or in the gluteus muscle.\nTransport the animal from the housing area to the operating room and place it in dorsal recumbency on the operating table.\nPlace a pulse oximetry probe on the animal’s ear, place a face mask on the animal’s snout and give Isoflurane in 100% O2, until the mandible is relaxed, to induce anesthesia.\nPlace an endotracheal (ET) tube using a laryngoscope. This should be achieved by holding the jaws open, pulling out the tongue, identifying the epiglottis, passing the tip of the laryngoscope into the oropharynx and displacing the epiglottis from the soft palate. Advance the ET tube through the vocal folds 6-10 cm and then rotate it in a curve down position relative to the top of the animal’s head.",
    "Inflate the ET cuff with air with 10 cm3, secure the ET tube to the animal’s snout using gauze ties and auscultate the animal’s chest to confirm correct placement of the tube.\nConnect the ET tube to a mechanical ventilator via a heat and moisture exchanger.\nConfirm appropriate mechanical ventilator settings to deliver an inspired O2 fraction of 30%, with a tidal volume of 7-10 mL per kg of body mass, a respiratory rate of 10-15 breaths/min, aiming for an end tidal CO2 tension of 38-42 mmHg.\nTo maintain anesthesia, use 1.5-3% isoflurane. Regularly asses the animal’s respiratory parameters.\n3. Surgery\nSurgical site sterilization and preparation\n\t\nRemove the hair overlying the site for the laparotomy incision and percutaneous access sites using an electric hair clipper.\nScrub all incision sites and percutaneous puncture sites with betadine and allow to dry.\nPlace sterile drapes around the operative sites to preserve the sterile surgical fields and prevent contamination. Secure these in place with staples.\nRetract the front and back hooves with slight flexion and restrain in place with rope or tape.\nPlace the ECG adhesive electrodes on the right forelimb, left forelimb, right hindlimb and left hindlimb and over the xiphoid. Attach the correct ECG leads to the adhesive electrodes.\nLaparotomy\n\t\nUse electrocautery to make a 20 cm midline abdominal incision.\nUse electrocautery to dissect through the subcutaneous tissue and linea alba. Enter the peritoneal cavity under direct vision using scissors.\nSplenectomy\n\t\nRemove the spleen to prevent autotransfusion in response to exsanguination.\nDeliver the spleen into the midline wound, clamp the hilum vessels with two hemostats and transect between the hemostats. Ligating the transected ends with 0 silk ties.\nIdentify the deeper lying short gastric vessels, place two hemostats, transect the vessels between the hemostats and ligate the ends with 0 silk ties.",
    "Carefully inspect the ligated vessels to ensure hemostasis. Ligate any bleeding vessels.\nExamine the spleen in situ to make sure it is dissected free and remove it.\nCystostomy\nDeliver the bladder through the laparotomy wound.\nGrasp the ventral part of the bladder between two DeBakey clamps and make a 1 cm incision using scissors.\nPass a suction catheter into the opening and remove the urine from the bladder.\nPlace a 14 Fr urinary catheter into the bladder. Inflate the catheter balloon with 10 mL of saline.\nPlace a purse string suture using a 3.0 nylon suture to secure the catheter in the bladder to prevent urine spillage.\nConnect the catheter to a collection bag.\nClose the laparotomy wound with a running stitch using a 3’0 nylon suture.\n4.

Pass an 0.035” Seldinger guidewire through the needle.\nRemove the needle, taking care to leave the guidewire in the venous lumen.\nMake a 5 mm skin incision adjacent to the wire, and thread a 7 Fr sheath with a dilator into the vein over the guidewire.\nRemove the guidewire and the introducer, leaving the sheath in position. Secure the sheath in place by suturing it to the skin with 1.0 silk sutures.\nRepeat the above steps to cannulate the contralateral Internal jugular vein.",
    "NOTE: One of the jugular vein sheaths is used for right atrial pressure monitoring, the other one can be used for drug delivery depending on the study protocol. Alternatively, external jugular veins can be used for cannulation.\nCarotid Artery Cannulation (Figure 1)\n\t\t\nLocate the carotid artery just lateral to the trachea using US guidance.\nPuncture the skin with an 18 G needle placed at a 45° angle to skin and introduce it into the arterial lumen under US vision, pass an 0.035” Seldinger guidewire through the needle.\nRemove the needle, taking care to leave the guidewire in the arterial lumen.\nMake a 5 mm skin incision adjacent to the wire, and thread a 7 Fr sheath with a dilator into the artery over the guidewire.\nRemove the guidewire and the introducer, leaving the sheath in position.

Exsanguination\nPreparing the setup",
    "Inject 15,000 IU of unfractionated heparin via the sidearm of the IJV sheath.\nLoad the exsanguination tubing into the roller of the peristaltic pump used for the exsanguination.\nConnect one end of the tubing to the circuit reservoir using standard IV tubing.\nConnect the other end of the exsanguination pump tubing using a straight coupler and a 2-inch segment of ¼” ID tubing to the end of the 15 Fr ECMO cannula in the femoral artery.\nRemove the clamp from the 15 Fr Cannula.\nCalculate logarithmic exsanguination rate intervals using the formula5. Interval length and exsanguination rate depend on the study protocol.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61573/61573equ01.jpg\nSet the desired pump rate according to the protocol using the programmable specific pump computer software -PUMPTERM.\nConnect the computer the programmable pump using a standard Ethernet port. Once the controlled pump is programmed with updated initial flow rate displayed on the digital display, it can be disconnected from the computer.\nPump controlled exsanguination\n\t\nBegin the exsanguination by pressing the START/ STOP button on the pump.\nContinue the exsanguination as per protocol until PEA is demonstrated by loss of aortic pressure (SBP <10 mmHg) with loss of pulsatility in the aortic root pressure waveform accompanied by sinus ECG rhythm.\nStop the exsanguination by manually pressing the START/ STOP button on the pump.\n6. SAAP\nSAAP circuit preparation\n\t\nConstruct the circuit tubing using barbed Y and straight connectors and 3/8” ID tubing to incorporate a reperfusion limb, main perfusion limb, SAAP perfusion limb and a peripheral perfusion limb (Figure 2). Secure the connections with cable ties.\nConnect the proximal tubing to the blood reservoir.\nConnect the tubing to the centrifugal pump.\nConnect the tubing to the oxygenator.",
    "Connect the oxygenator to the source of oxygen using a standard oxygen tubing by inserting it into the oxygen infusion port on the oxygenator.\nLoad the main perfusion limb of the circuit into the peristaltic pump head.\nDeliver the oxygen at 6 L/min by rotating the dial on the oxygen cylinder.\nAdd 15,000 IU of unfractionated heparin into the circuit reservoir.\nConfirm that the perfusion limb of the circuit is clamped, and the reperfusion limb is open as the shed blood is pumped into the blood reservoir during exsanguination. Activate the centrifugal pump in the SAAP circuit by pressing the START/ STOP button and set the flow at any rate. This will allow blood to circulate preventing coagulation.\nMark the balloon insertion length by placing it externally against anatomical landmarks. Aim for the balloon to sit in the proximal thoracic aorta.\nFlush the SAAP catheter and confirm it has a 3-way stopcock attached to the catheter hub.\nConfirm that the balloon is fully deflated and confirm the catheter has a 2-way stopcock at the balloon port.\nPrefill a 60 mL syringe with a solution of 0.1 mg of epinephrine (in 1 mL), 10 mL of contrast and 49 mL of saline. This solution is the aortic valve (AV) closure bolus which will be injected immediately prior to SAAP perfusion to prevent retrograde filling of the left ventricle.\nPrefill another syringe with 15 mL of saline/contrast solution (1:1). This will be used to inflate the catheter balloon.\nSet the peristaltic pump in the SAAP circuit to deliver the perfusate (oxygenated blood) at a rate of 10 mL/kg of the animal’s body weight by manually programming the pump using the “up” and “down” buttons on the pump dial.\nSAAP delivery",
    "Insert the SAAP catheter into the 14 Fr sheath in the femoral artery to a previously determined length, attach the syringe prefilled with 15 mL of saline contrast solution to the balloon port (Figure 2) and inject the volume of the syringe to inflate the balloon. \nConfirm the balloon placement with fluoroscopy.\nConnect the SAAP perfusion limb to the SAAP catheter and the peripheral perfusion limb to the venous catheter (Figure 3).\nClose the reperfusion limb of the SAAP circuit by applying the clamp to it and open the perfusion limb by taking the clamp off it (Figure 2).\nAttach the previously prefilled 60mL syringe with AV closure bolus to the side port of the three way stopcock at the arterial lumen of the SAAP catheter (Figure 3) and quickly manually inject the entire volume of the syringe, followed by closing off the side port to the syringe.\nImmediately open the end port of the arterial port stopcock.\nStart the Peristaltic pump in the SAAP circuit by pressing the RUN/STOP button.\nAfter sixty seconds stop the peristaltic pump by pressing the RUN/STOP button.\nDeflate the SAAP balloon by aspirating the entire volume from the the SAAP balloon port.\nClose off the flow to the catheter with stop stopcock at the arterial lumen of the catheter.\nAssess the SBP and ECG rhythm.\n\t\tNOTE: If after 2 minutes from starting SAAP SBP < 90 mmHg, up to 7 boluses of 200 mL of heparinized shed blood or pre-purchased citrated whole blood can be infused via the SAAP to maintain SBP >90 mmHg.",
    "If stored blood is used for SAAP, co- infusion with calcium gluconate is necessary to prevent citrate calcium binding in the myocardium. Inject calcium gluconate immediately before SAAP perfusion using a syringe attached to the side port of the 3- way stopcock connected to the SAAP Catheter. Use 1 gram of calcium gluconate per packed RBC unit and 3 grams per whole blood unit5.\nIf the animal develops ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, attempt defibrillation by placing paddles over the sternum and the apex and, following personnel clearance form contact with the animal.\n\t\t\t\nContinue ventilation, immediately prior to delivering shocks disconnect the pressure transducers from the signal conditioning units- reconnect these immediately after delivering the shock.\nDeliver a shock using a biphasic defibrillator starting at 150 J, reassess the rhythm for up to one-minute following this. If ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation are present deliver up to two more shocks at 200 J following one minute of rhythm assessment after each shock.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The defibrillation algorithm used here is for a biphasic defibrillator, monophasic defibrillators will usually require less energy. If other cardiac rhythms are identified- Atrial Fibrillation, PEA etc. defibrillation should not be attempted, and the animal should be treated according to specific study protocol.\n7. Peripheral perfusion\nNOTE: Following successful SAAP resuscitation depending on the study protocol, further volume replacement can be continued peripherally using the SAAP circuit.\nClamp the SAAP perfusion limb of the main perfusion limb.\nConfirm that the peripheral perfusion limb of the SAAP circuit is connected to the sidearm of the catheter in the femoral vein and the stopcocks and tubing are open.\nAssure appropriate resuscitation fluid and volume is in the SAAP reservoir.\nAssure that the recirculation limb of the SAAP circuit is clamped.",
    "Infuse the fluid according to protocol needs by setting the appropriate flow settings on the peristaltic pump.\n8. Euthanasia\nAt the end of the experiment, euthanize the animal by injecting >2 mmol/kg of potassium chloride into a central vein and wait for 1 minute of asystole.\nSubscription Required.
