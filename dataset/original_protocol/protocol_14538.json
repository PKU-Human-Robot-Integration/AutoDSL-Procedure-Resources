    "NOTE: This protocol has been approved by the Animal Research Committee at the University of California Los Angeles.\n1. Preoperative Preparation and Anesthesia\nBe sure to observe sterile technique throughout the procedure.\nSterilize all surgical supplies using a steam autoclave.\nTurn on heated rodent surgical platform prior to anesthetic induction so that it may warm to appropriate temperature (37 Â°C) and place under stereomicroscope for visualization during surgical procedure.\nPlace the mouse in the anesthesia induction chamber and induce with 4% isoflurane at a flow rate of 1 L/min.\n\t\nCarefully monitor the respiratory rate and footpad skin color of mouse during induction.\nAfter slowing of the respiratory rate, remove the mouse from the induction chamber and place on warmed pad for surgical preparation with face in separate nosecone and maintenance isoflurane concentration of 2.5%.\nPerform toe pinch to assess adequacy of anesthetic.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the corneas and administer preoperative carprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously.\nPlace mouse supine and use clippers to remove hair from abdomen.\nPrepare the surgical area with three alternating scrubs of povidone iodine and 70% isopropyl alcohol applied with sterile gauze pads.\nPlace mouse supine on heated rodent surgical platform with face in nosecone and secure all extremities and carefully position mouse such that the abdomen is visible with the stereomicroscope.\nPlace sterile, adhesive dressings along each edge of the prepared surgical area.\nTitrate isoflurane concentration to maintain adequate anesthesia during surgery while maintaining spontaneous respirations.\n2. Infrarenal Aortic Clamping\nMake a 3 cm incision down the midline of the abdomen using a scalpel, starting approximately 0.5 cm inferior to the xiphoid process.\nGently retract the skin with forceps and dissect skin away from the abdominal wall using fine scissors to cut the fine connective tissue.",
    "Apply 0.05-0.1 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine to the muscle wall and make a 2 cm incision into the abdominal wall to expose the abdominal organs.\n\t\nIf bleeding occurs along abdominal wall, apply gentle pressure with a cotton-tipped applicator.\nGently lift the intestines using saline-soaked cotton-tipped applicators.\n\tNOTE: Be careful to avoid blunt trauma to the jejunal and ileal arteries and place on a warm, sterile saline soaked gauze sponge outside the abdominal cavity.\n\t\nCover the intestines with another warm, sterile saline soaked gauze sponge to avoid moisture loss.\nPlace a retractor to lateralize the rectum and expose the retroperitoneum.\nPlace small gauze pads as necessary for visualization of retroperitoneum keeping track of the number used.\nAt the level of the inferior pole of the right kidney, use sharp dissecting forceps to make a retroperitonotomy lateral to the aorta.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to injure the inferior vena cava or surrounding vessels.\n\t\nBluntly dissect retroperitoneal tissue off the aorta being careful not to perforate the inferior vena cava or surrounding vasculature.\nPlace the vascular clamp over the aorta for at least 1 min, or other specified time, and verify occlusion by visually observing lack of pulsatility in distal aorta.\nRemove the vascular clamp and verify hemostasis. Hemostasis is achieved and ensured when no active extravasation of blood is seen.\n\t\nConfirm extravasation by adding 0.5 ml saline into abdominal cavity and assessing if the saline becomes increasingly blood-tinged. If this is the case, apply gentle pressure using the saline-soaked applicator for 1 min to ensure hemostasis.\nRemove any gauze pads placed to aid in visualization of retroperitoneum and replace intestines in situ into abdomen.\nIrrigate the abdominal cavity using pre-warmed sterile saline.\n3. Closure of Laparotomy and Skin\nClose the abdominal wall muscle layer using a 5-0 braided, absorbable single running suture.",
    "Close skin with 1-3 drops of polymer adhesive and then subsequently with wound clips once the adhesive is set.\n4. Recovery and Postoperative Assessment\nTransfer the mouse to a recovery cage on a heating pad with food and water on the floor of the cage.\nClosely monitor the mouse for signs of respiratory distress. Administer carprofen (5 mg/kg) daily for 48 hr postoperatively per institution guidelines.\n\t\nDo not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nReturn the mouse to a normal cage with food and water.\n\t\nDo not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nAssess wound on a daily basis for dehiscence and remove clips on postoperative day 14.\n5. Aortic Dissection and Staining\nSelect mice for sacrifice based on the specific time point of interest following denudation injury.\nSacrifice mice via isoflurane inhalation and immediately inject with 5 mg methacholine chloride to cause vascular smooth muscle relaxation.\nUpon confirmation of death by respiratory cessation, lack of corneal reflex and lack of movement, perfuse with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline at a perfusion pressure of 100 mmHg via the left heart ventricle for 10 min.\nUse a dissecting stereomicroscope to carefully separate the intact abdominal aorta from the surrounding tissues.\nTransect the aorta rostral to the renal arteries and caudal to the iliac bifurcation and opened via a longitudinal incision along the dorsal surface.\nPin the aorta flat on a 35 mm silicone coated dish with the luminal side up for fixation for no less than 2 hr but no more than 12 hr. Subsequently, the tissue can be either embedded for sectioning or used in en face whole-mount immunocytochemistry.",
    "Mount stained aortas with luminal side facing the coverslip on glass slides for confocal microscopy.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
