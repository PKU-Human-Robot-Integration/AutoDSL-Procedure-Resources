See main text for details.\n(B and C) Upon the addition of acetic acid to the NaBH4-treated samples (b,), the solution reacts rapidly and froth (C).\n(D) The samples take an orange tint after the addition of rhodamine-110 in acidic conditions.\n(E) Covering a thermomixer in aluminum foil allows the incubation of the samples with rhodamine in the dark.\n(F) Adjusting the pH with tris and phenol turn the samples yellow.\n(G) Following phenol RNA purification, unincorporated rhodamine separates in the lower, organic phase, while RNA (including rhodamine-labeled RNA) separates in the upper, aqueous phase.\nDihydrouridine reduction and RNA precipitation.\nFor each condition, mix in a RNase-free 2-mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1623_5.csv\nFor the R+ condition (effective labeling), add 40 μL of the reduction solution to the 360 μL RNA samples to obtain a final NaBH4 concentration of 10 mg/mL. For the R- control condition (mock treatment), only add 40 μL of KOH 0.01 M.\nIncubate 60 min at 25°C in the dark with agitation at 750 rpm.\nCritical: The reduction reaction releases fumes. Manipulate under chemical hood. To avoid over-pressure in the tubes and possible (small) explosions, we recommend opening the tubes briefly after the first 10 and 20 min incubation.\nAdd 20 μL of cold 6 M acetic acid to stop the reaction by lowering the pH to 4–5.",
    "Note: Be careful when adding the acetic acid as it rapidly reacts in contact to the RNA solution and froth (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nPrecipitate the RNA by adding 1050 μL of cold (−20°C) 100% EtOH and 42 μL of 3 M NaAC pH 5.2.\nVortex 20 s.\nFreeze 30 min at −80°C to help RNA precipitate.\nCentrifuge 10 min at 18 000 g, 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant by pipetting and add 420 μL of cold 70% EtOH.\nCritical: Do not resuspend nor vortex to avoid losing the (mostly invisible) RNA pellet.\nSpin 1 min at 18,000 g, 4°C.\nAspirate most supernatant, spin 5 s and remove rest of liquid with pipette.\nAir dry 10 min at room temperature.\nResuspend with 5 μL of DEPC-treated water and 85 μL of 0.1 M NaCOOH pH 4.0 by heating 7 min at 65°C at 550 rpm and pipetting.\nNote: To resuspend with a salt solution at pH 3 instead of pH 4 in step [1.m] enhances the efficiency of rhodamine incorporation and allows to use 0.1 M sodium acetate instead of sodium formate. However, it leads to a higher degree of RNA degradation (Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1623-Mmc1.pdf]).\nVortex, spin and proceed immediately to the next step.\nRhodamine incorporation in reduced dihydrouridine.\nAdd 10 μL of rhodamine 0.022 M (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nIncubate 90 min at 37°C in the dark (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nAdd 17 μL Tris-HCl 800 mM pH 8.5 to adjust the pH at 7.5.\nAdd 433 μL DEPC-treated water to adjust the volume to 550 μL.\nPhenol-purify with 550 μL of acidic (pH 4.3) phenol–chloroform, vortex 20 s (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nCritical: Phenol is toxic and volatile.

    "(C) Example Rho-seq results for a Lysine tRNA (SPMITTRNALYS.01). High D-ratio can be observed one nucleotide upstream of the known D-sites at position 16 and 20.\nMeasure rhodamine incorporation at 520 nm (Cy3 channel) in a fluorescent reader (Imagequant or similar). Calculate signal intensity with ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]) for each drop. To normalize the intensities, subtract the signal of the DEPC-treated water drop (background) from all other values. Then, scale to the signal of the pure Rhodamine 0.022 M drop (that is set at 100%). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nRNA ribodepletion and sample concentration\nTiming: 2 h\nAs ribosomal RNA (rRNA) accounts for a large majority of the transcriptome, efficient ribodepletion allows to increase the ultimate read coverage on mRNA and ncRNA (other than rRNA) genes. The following steps describe the use of the Ribominus depletion system but other kits can be used.\nRNA Ribodepletion.\nHeat 2× Hybridization Buffer 10 min at 50°C in a 2-mL heat block to bring salts into solution and thaw the Ribominus Eukaryote Probe Mix v2 on ice. Set heat blocks to 37°C and 70°C.\nPrepare 200 μL/sample of 1× Hybridization buffer by diluting 2× Hybridization buffer in RNase-free water.\nFollowing this order, mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1623_6.csv\nMix by gentle vortexing and incubate at 70°C for 10 min.\nImmediately transfer the tube to 37°C for 20 min.\nWash RiboMinus magnetic beads (add liquid, place the tubes on a magnetic rack until the solution clears, then remove supernatant) twice with 1 mL of DEPC-treated water.\nResuspend the beads in 200 μL 1× Hybridization Buffer and incubate in the 37°C heat block for a minimum of 5 min or until the 20-min incubation of the RNA/probe mix is complete.\nBriefly centrifuge the RNA/probe mix.",
    "Transfer the 100 μL RNA/probe mix to the 200 μL prepared beads from step [4.g] and mix well by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nBriefly centrifuge and place it on a magnetic stand until the solution clears.\nTransfer the 300 μL supernatant containing the rRNA-depleted RNA to an RNase-free 2-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSample concentration.\nBefore using Wash Buffer (W5) for the first time, add 6 mL 96–100% ethanol to 1.5 mL W5 included in the kit.\nAdd 300 μL Binding Buffer L3 (1 volume) and 900 μL 100% ethanol (3 volumes) for a final concentration of 60% ethanol.\nCritical: To avoid the loss of RNAs < 200 nt (such as tRNAs) during the concentration step, the binding of RNA is performed with 60% ethanol to retain all RNA species.\nMix by vortexing.\nTransfer 600 μL of the sample to a spin column in a collection tube (both supplied in the RiboMinus™ Concentration Module kit).\nCentrifuge 1 min at 12,000 g and discard flow-through.\nRepeat steps [d-e] with the remaining sample (in the same column).\nPlace the column into a clean wash tube supplied in the kit.\nWash the column by adding 600 μL Wash Buffer (W5) prepared with ethanol.\nCentrifuge the column 1 min at 12,000 g and discard flow-through.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 3 min to remove any residual W5 buffer and place the column in a clean 1.5-mL recovery tube.\nAdd 16 μL RNase-free water to the center of the column and incubate 1 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Keep the flowthrough.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C.\nVerification of ribodepletion.",
    "Quantify RNA samples using Qubit RNA HS assay or similar according to manufacturer’s instructions. Typical yield is in the 10–30 ng/μL range. A minimum of 100 ng is required to proceed to the rho-seq library preparation.\nCritical: At this step, it is important to measure RNA concentration with fluorescent assay (Qubit and similar) and not with photometric assays (nanodrop) as the later tends to report less reliable measurements.\nRun total RNA (input from step 1), treated RNA (R+/R- not ribodepleted, from step 30) and ribodepleted samples in a RNA 6000 Pico bioanalyzer chip according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nLibrary preparation\nTiming: 2 days\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1623_7.csv\nThe library preparation starts with the fragmentation of the ribodepleted RNA. Then, the 3′ of the RNA fragments are ligated to an RNA adaptor that hybridizes to a universal RT primer to allow reverse transcription. Because it is sensitive to rhodaminized nucleotides, RT converts the initial presence of D into a quantifiable signal and is therefore a central step of this protocol. Indeed, while D barely affects RT (Motorin et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]), we found that the addition of the bulky rhodamine moiety onto the D residue after effective rhodamine labeling (R+) effectively blocks reverse transcriptase and leads to specific RT drop-off (Finet et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). In consequence, the shorter, truncated cDNA fragments generated have 3′-ends that reflects the presence of D one nucleotide downstream on the template strand (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Critically, the information on the 3′-end position needs to be preserved during second-strand synthesis. This requirement precludes the application of the common RNAse-H-based method used to generate second-strand RNA primers in Illumina sequencing chemistry (Sultan et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). Instead, direct ligation of a second adaptor in 3′ of the cDNA allows to preserve its end during the PCR amplification and paired-end sequencing of the library (Engreitz et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Agarwal et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) (Figure S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1623-Mmc1.pdf]).\nCritical: Throughout library preparation, there are multiple purification steps using magnetic beads. In that context, to “wash the beads” means to add a liquid (volume and nature are indicated) to the beads, place the tubes on a magnetic rack until the solution clears, then remove supernatant by pipetting while leaving the beads in the tube.\nFragmentation.\nBring 90–125 ng of ribodepleted RNA to a 9 μL volume with DEPC-treated water.\nAdd 1 μL of 10× Fragmentation Buffer.\nMix by vortexing, spin briefly, and incubate at 70°C for 15 min in a heating block.\nAdd 2 μL of the Stop Solution and incubate 30 s at room temperature.\nSpin sample briefly then place it back on ice.\nElution.\nResuspend the MyONE SILANE magnetic beads by thorough vortexing and aliquot out 15 μL in a 1.5 mL nucleases-free tube.\nPlace tube on a magnetic rack and wait 30 s.\nDiscard supernatant and wash the beads with 15 μL RLT Buffer.\nResuspend bead in 42 μL RLT Buffer and add the beads to sample.\nAdd 54 μL 100% ethanol and mix well by pipetting (about 10 up and downs).\nIncubate for 2 min at room temperature.\nPlace tube on magnetic track and wait 1 min, then discard supernatant.\nWash twice by resuspending beads in 150 μL of 70% ethanol.",
    "Critical: Always work with a fresh stock of 70% ethanol.\nCarefully remove all remaining 70% ethanol and dry beads on magnetic rack at room temperature for 5 min.
