    "All animal handling procedures described below adhere to the University of Western Ontario's animal care committee (2016-014).\n1. Tissue Preparation and Sectioning\nExtract brain tissue from the rat through a process known as \"Fresh Frozen Extraction\" (FFE).\n\t\nEuthanize the rat with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium and monitor reflexes in the limbs. Once all reflexes have ceased, sever the head of the rat using a guillotine.\nCarefully separate the muscles and other tissues from the skull using a scalpel. Use bone-cutting forceps to break the skull to expose the brain, starting from the base of the skull (foramen magnum) to the anterior portion.\nOnce the brain is exposed, carefully scoop it out with a surgical spatula and immediately place on crushed dry ice for flash freezing.\n\t\tNOTE: The brain will be very malleable. Therefore, take extreme care when placing the brain on dry ice. If the brain is crushed or pressed against a surface, it will alter its shape and freeze in that position.\nRemove fresh frozen tissue (not perfused with formaldehyde or embedded in OCT) from - 80° C freezer and place on dry ice.\nPlace several drops of water on a cryostat holder and place on either dry ice or cryostat freeze bar. Press tissue lightly onto cryostat holder as it begins to freeze and hold until water freezes around the base of the tissue and anchors it in place. Add additional water to further secure the tissue on the holder if necessary.\n\tNOTE: Water is used instead of OCT media for mounting tissue in order to avoid contamination of the tissue with compounds which can affect the detection of the desired signal.\nPosition tissue in cryostat. Section tissue up to the desired anatomical location. Ensure that the cutting thickness is between 8 - 12 µm.",
    "NOTE: When sectioning tissue in communal cryostat devices, it is imperative that separate materials such as blades, brushes, anti-roll bars, and holders be used in order to avoid contamination with embedding compounds. The inside of the cryostat should also be cleaned thoroughly with ethanol before use.\nUsing the cryostat anti-roll bar, slowly section flattened tissue sections. Holes or markings on the tissue can occur if the roll bar placement is incorrect or blade is dull. Move the tissue to the center of slicing platform using clean paintbrushes.\nMounting\n\t\nFreeze conductive slides or metal plates by placing them in the cryostat while slicing. When the slide is completely frozen, carefully move the sectioned tissue onto the conductive surface of the slide using clean paintbrushes. Once all tissue sections are positioned correctly on the slide, place a finger under the slide, opposite the tissue, and press until the section thaws.\n\t\tNOTE: Sections may fold or curl during the thawing process when using this mounting method. This can be reduced by keeping the slide in the cryostat when thawing the tissue. If these issues become problematic, an alternative, warm-mount method is listed below.\nAlternatively, take a room temperature Indium-tin Oxide (ITO) slide (or metal plate) and lightly press down on frozen tissue section on the slicing platform surface, conductive side down. This will lead to the tissue section thawing evenly onto the surface of the slide with little curling or folding of the tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: Condensation may appear below the section when mounting using this method which may lead to loss of certain proteins and lipids.\nPlace slides with tissue in a desiccator for 5 - 10 min.\n2. Sublimator Apparatus Set-up\nNOTE: Perform these steps in a fume hood.",
    "Place a sand bath in an aluminum container onto a hot plate, with the hot plate on a metal scissor lift of appropriate surface area (i.e. larger than the hot plate). Turn on the hot plate and set the temperature to 140 °C.\n\tNOTE: The melting point for DAN matrix is between 187 - 190 °C. Do not exceed this temperature on the hotplate.\n\t\nIf the hot plate is equipped with a temperature feedback probe, use it to monitor sand temperature throughout the experiment and ensure temperature consistency. This feature can assist with experiment reproducibility across various sublimation experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: The sand bath should be contained within an aluminum container as a glass container may shatter at high temperatures.\nPlace 300 mg of DAN matrix onto the bottom surface of sublimation apparatus. Place the matrix in the center of the apparatus and spread out in an even layer in the approximate width and length of the slide being sublimated.\n\tCAUTION: DAN matrix is toxic. Therefore, it is important wear gloves, masks, and safety goggles at all times when handling the powdered matrix. DAN should be stored in the dark as it is light sensitive.\nTape a metal plate onto the inner surface of the apparatus with the plate making direct contact with the bottom of the condenser in order to ensure even distribution of temperature cooling across the entire surface of the slide during sublimation. Alternatively, sand the bottom of the condenser to ensure a flat surface.",
    "Place the tape along the outer edges of the plate and adhere to the sides of the inner glassware. If the tape is placed under the plate and adheres to the bottom of the inner glass surface, the temperature distribution may not be even and could result in uneven matrix distribution across the surface of the slide.\nTape a blank (test) slide diagonally across the surface of the metal plate with the tape again placed on the outer edges of the slide.\nConnect the top and bottom portions of the apparatus, with a rubber O-ring in the middle to ensure a complete seal.\nPlace a metal U-joint around the center of the apparatus and tighten vices until the top and bottom half of the apparatus are sealed tightly together. Place in the metal O-ring above the sand bath.\nTake a handful of crushed ice and place it in the condenser. Fill condenser ¼ to ½ full with cold water to create ice slush. The ice slush will cool the metal plate on the inside of the apparatus and subsequently the slide adhered to it. Wait at least 5 min for the temperature to reach a steady state.\nPour 300 mL of ethanol in the cold trap container and place the glassware into the container. Drop 2 - 3 small pieces of dry ice into the ethanol in the bottom of the cold trap container. The cold trap input has a glass tube running to the bottom of the cylinder, while the output does not.\nConnect the vacuum pump to the cold trap output using rubber tubing. Use another piece of rubber tubing to connect the cold trap input to the sublimation apparatus. Ensure that the tubing is tightly secured using metal clamps if available.",
    "Use the vacuum pump to deliver a vacuum of 30 - 50 mT. Allow the pump to run for at least 5 min for pressure equilibration. Vices on U-ring of sublimation apparatus may have to be tightened again once the vacuum pump is turned on because of decreased pressure in the apparatus.\n\tNOTE: It is highly recommended that a vacuum gauge be attached to the pump to monitor the pressure of vacuum during the experiment and to test for leaks in pressure in order to achieve the highest possible reproducibility between experiments. However, most pumps are designed to maintain a constant pressure, therefore the gauge may not be essential for experienced users. Additionally, vacuum seal grease can be used to help maintain vacuum pressure.\n3. Sublimation\nEnsure that the sand bath temperature has stabilized at 140 °C and that the apparatus is secured in the metal O-ring above the sand bath with all tubing connected and the vacuum turned on.\nSet timer for 7 min but do not start timer. Slowly raise the scissor lift and sand bath up to the sublimation apparatus until the U-joint of the sublimator is well above the metal O-ring. This extra space allows for adjustment of the apparatus on the sand.\n\t\nQuickly press the sublimator gently on the sand surface to ensure that the apparatus is sitting evenly on the sand, and then immediately start the timer.\nWhen the timer sounds, turn off the vacuum pump and carefully lower the scissor lift until the sublimator is no longer touching the sand bath and is sitting securely in the metal O-ring.",
    "Slowly loosen the micro-vent valve to release pressure in the apparatus. Loosen the metal clamp around the rubber tubing of the sublimation apparatus and slowly begin to loosen the tube. Once the rubber tube has been loosened slightly, bend the tube to one side to allow residual pressure to escape.\nWhen ambient pressure returns, carefully remove the rubber tubing from the sublimation apparatus.\nLoosen the vices on the U-joint of the apparatus and remove. Carefully separate the two halves of the sublimation apparatus and pull off the slide from the top of the inner glassware. Examine slide to confirm even matrix distribution.\n\tNOTE: If matrix is uneven, the powdered matrix in the bottom of the sublimator can be repositioned or the sublimator apparatus can be repositioned in the sand for the next slide. The sublimation process can be repeated several times using the same matrix, however, the matrix will eventually become darker from repeated heat exposure and the quantity of powder will decrease such that the sublimation time will have to be adjusted slightly to compensate. For this reason, it is important to monitor the amount of matrix being sublimated after each experiment to ensure consistency in matrix deposition between slides\nIf the distribution and amount of matrix sublimated is sufficient, tape a new slide with tissue onto the inside of the sublimator and repeat Section 3.",
    "NOTE: For quality control (QC) purposes, the amount of matrix sublimated can be measured after each experiment by weighing the slide before and after sublimation and dividing the weight of sublimated matrix with the surface area of the slide 2, it should be noted that due to the lack of precision of most scales beyond 4 decimal points and variability between scales, these measurements should be only be used a guide for optimal matrix deposition as opposed to a fully quantifiable means of QC unless a high precision balance is used (see Figure 3).\n4. Tissue Storage/Rehydration\nAfter sublimation, store slides in a sealed container or small cassette in sealed plastic bag.\nIncubate slides in -20 °C freezer for 2 h or overnight.\n\tNOTE: The goal of the freezing process is to act as a rehydration step for the desorption of tissue materials into the matrix. The freezing process has also been shown to prevent degradation of lipid signals for up to 1 week when stored at -80 °C 12. For this reason, the amount of time the samples are stored in the freezer can be varied to a certain degree to suit the needs of the experimenter without significantly altering signal detection (as observed in our lab). However, we have noticed some discoloration of matrix when samples are frozen for longer than 24 h at -20 °C. Thus, we recommend imaging the sublimated tissue before that time or storing tissue at -80 °C for longer incubation periods.\nRemove slides from freezer (and container) and place in a desiccator for 5 - 10 min.\n5. Imaging and Analysis",
    "Remove slides from desiccator and apply instrument standards to ensure mass accuracy of MALDI instrument during imaging. The type of standards will vary depending on instrumentation. Standards are generally applied evenly across entire slide, surrounding tissue to be imaged (Figure 3D).\nInsert slide into MALDI instrument and follow manufacturer's instructions for imaging experiments (instrument methods should be optimized for a 1,000 - 2,000 mass range). Representative result (Figure 4) was acquired in reflectron negative mode with a 70 µm raster and 20 shots/spectrum (acquisition time ~ 2 h).\nSubscription Required.
