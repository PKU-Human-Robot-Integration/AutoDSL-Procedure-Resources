  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures were approved by The University of Calgary Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. The atrial myocyte isolation, images, and representative results described below were obtained from a 15 week-old male wildtype C57Bl/6 mouse. We routinely use this protocol to isolate atrial myocytes from wildtype mice17,18, mice carrying genetic mutations19,20 and mouse models of disease such as chronic hypertension6,14. The protocol can be used similarly for male or female mice. We also utilized a similar version of this isolation procedure to isolate sinoatrial node myocytes from the mouse heart17,21,22,23. A flowchart of this experimental protocol is located in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of Stock Solutions and Equipment\nPrepare 1 dissecting dish by adding silicone elastomer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Add enough silicone elastomer compound to cover the bottom of a 10 cm Petri dish to a depth of 1 cm. Allow to cure and then insert 6 insect pins into the dish.\nNOTE: This silicone dissecting dish can be reused for months and stored at room temperature.\nPrepare 3 fire-polished Pasteur pipettes with an opening of 1 mm (small bore), 3 mm (medium bore), or 5 mm (large bore) in diameter as shown in Figure 2A. To make these pipettes, score a Pasteur pipette and then snap along the score mark to produce an opening that is slightly larger than the desired bore size. Use a metal file to smooth the surface and then fire-polish this opening using an open flame.\nNOTE: This will produce a smooth, fire-polished edge with an opening of the desired diameter. It is important that the opening is free of cracks and rough surfaces. These fire-polished pipettes can be stored at room temperature and reused for months.",
    "Prepare stock solutions for Tyrode’s pH 6.9 solution and Tyrode’s pH 7.4 solution as listed in Table 1. Also prepare 10 mL each of 1 M MgCl2, 1 M CaCl2, and 100 mM CaCl2. Use ultrapure water for all solutions and store at 4 °C for up to 2 months.\nPrepare 1 L of modified Kraft-Brühe (KB) solution as indicated in Table 2. Use ultrapure water. Divide the solution into 20 mL aliquots and store at -20 °C for up to 2 months.\n2. Preparation of Solutions and Isolation Setup for Atrial Myocyte Isolation\nPrepare 50 mL of a modified Tyrode’s pH 7.4 solution as described in Table 3 in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask, using 1 M CaCl2 and 1 M MgCl2 stock solutions. Place the Erlenmeyer flask in a 35 °C water bath until use, as shown in Figure 2B.\nPrepare the modified Tyrode’s pH 6.9 solution as described in Table 4 in a 50 mL tube, using the 100 mM CaCl2 stock solution. Aliquot 2.5 mL of this solution into each of three 5 mL round bottom tubes. Place these tubes in a wire rack placed in a 35 °C water bath until use, as shown in Figure 2B.\nPrepare the enzyme solution as described in Table 5 in a 14 mL round bottom tube. To make the protease solution, add 1 mg of protease per 100 μL of ultrapure water. Place the tube containing this enzyme solution in the wire rack and incubate in a 35 °C water bath until use.",
    "Thaw one aliquot of modified KB solution in a 35 °C water bath. Aliquot 2.5 mL of KB solution into each of three 5 mL round bottom tubes and 2.5 mL into a 14 mL round bottom tube. Place these tubes in the wire rack and incubate in a 35 °C water bath until use, as shown in Figure 2B.\nLay out the dissecting plate, dissecting tools, a Pasteur pipette, and the fire-polished pipettes as shown in Figure 2B.\n3. Dissection of Mouse Atrial Appendage(s)\nInject the mouse with 0.2 mL of heparin (10 000 USP U/10 mL) via intraperitoneal injection and wait 5 min for absorption.\nPlace the mouse in an induction chamber and anesthetize by isoflurane inhalation (3-4%). Isoflurane and oxygen are delivered using an anesthetic machine and waste anesthetic gas is scavenged. Once the mouse is anesthetized, and does not exhibit a toe pinch reflex, euthanize the mouse by rapid cervical dislocation. Place the mouse on a paper towel or a cork board and tape the paws down to hold the mouse in place.\nWet the chest of the mouse with 70% ethanol. Remove the fur and skin covering the chest using curved scissors. Next, use rat tooth forceps to lift the sternum and then cut the diaphragm along the edge of the ribs. Remove the entire rib cage using curved scissors to expose the heart.\nTo remove the atrial appendage (right or left), gently lift the appendage using fine dissecting forceps and cut it out with spring scissors. Immediately transfer the atrial appendage to a silicone coated dissecting dish containing 20 mL of the warmed modified Tyrode’s pH 7.4 solution described in step 2.1.",
    "Place one dissecting pin at the top and one pin at the bottom of the opening of the atrial appendage. Using a pasture pipette, flush the atria with the warmed modified Tyrode’s pH 7.4 solution to remove blood. Open the atrial appendage by cutting along the top and bottom edge of the atrial appendage. Next, pin the corners of the atrial appendage down to create a flat, rectangular piece of tissue, as shown in Figure 3A.\n4. Isolation of Atrial Myocytes\nNOTE: Steps in this section are all performed at 35 °C, with tubes submerged in a 35 °C water bath. Be careful when transferring tissue strips between round bottom tubes to ensure that only the tissue (and not the solution) is transferred between tubes.\nCut the atrial appendage into approximately 8-10 equal sized strips (approximately 0.7 mm in width) using spring scissors and fine forceps. An example of the strips of atrial tissue is shown in Figure 3B. Note that the strips contract once they are cut free from the main piece of tissue. Using the small bore fire-polished pipette, transfer the tissue strips into the first tube containing warmed modified Tyrode’s pH 6.9 solution described in step 2.2. Wait 5 min.\nWash the tissue strips by transferring them to the second and then the third round bottom tube containing modified Tyrode’s pH 6.9 solution prepared in step 2.2 using the medium bore fire-polished pipette.\n\t\nTo wash the tissue strips, cap the 5 mL round bottom tube and gently invert the tube 3 times. Let the tissue strips settle to the bottom of the tube before transferring the tissue strips to the next tube using the medium bore fire-polished pipette.",
    "Transfer the tissue strips into the enzyme solution described in step 2.3 using a medium bore fire-polished pipette and incubate for 30 min. Swirl the tube every 3-5 min to prevent the tissue strips from adhering together.\nNOTE: At the beginning of the enzymatic digestion, tissue strips settle quickly following swirling. At approximately 20 min of digestion, the tissue strips begin to float in the enzymatic solution following swirling. During this time, the atrial tissue strips also change in appearance from pale pink to white as they are digested.\nAfter enzymatic digestion, perform three washes using 2.5 mL of KB solution in the 5 mL round bottom tubes prepared in step 2.4. For each wash, gently invert the tube 3 times before moving the tissue to the next tube using the medium bore fire-polished pipette. Following the final wash, transfer the strips into the 14 mL round bottom tube containing 2.5 mL of KB solution. Wait 5 min.\nGently triturate the tissue for 7.5 min using the wide bore fire-polished pipette. This will mechanically dissociate the tissue strips and yield a cloudy solution filled with individual atrial myocytes.\nNOTE: During trituration, the tissue becomes white and the solution becomes cloudy. The force of trituration, achieved by altering both the frequency and velocity of expelling the tissue strips from the wide bore fire-polished pipette, should be tailored to the individual isolation. If trituration is too gentle, the cell yield will be low, while trituration that is too harsh will yield many dead cells. Avoid bubbles while triturating.",
    "Fill the 14 mL round bottom tube containing the triturated tissue strips with KB solution to a final volume of 7-10 mL depending on the desired density of cells for experimental use. Place this tube at room temperature for 1 h. Following this incubation period, cells can be used for a variety of experiments for up to 7 h. Cells can also be stored at 4 °C for up to 7 h."
