    "Note: Details of sample collection, storage and transport for low-biomass samples (tap water, shower curtain, mudflat water, leaf surface and human skin) please see the method described by Yan et al. (2017). Regarding mudflat sediment samples, details of sample collection and nucleic acid extraction are described in our recent work (Yan et al., 2018). Nucleic acid extractionExtract total RNA or total nucleic acids from low-biomass samples, which are unsuitable for DNase I digestion, using a mirVANATM miRNA Isolation Kit. Five or more swabs are preferred to be pooled for nucleic acid extraction, while a whole piece of filter membrane is preferred to be cut into small pieces (~0.5 mm2) for extraction. To completely disrupt microbial cell walls, vortex such preprocessed samples with 0.7 g glass beads and 0.7 ml Lysis/Binding Buffer in a 2 ml bead beating tube at maximum speed prior to extraction. After centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml tube and extract total RNA strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions.Visualize the RNA samples in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel after electrophoresis to assess the RNA integrity (Figure 1). Store total RNA or total nucleic acids at -80 °C. Quantify total RNA using a QubitTM RNA HS Assay Kit on Qubit 2.0 fluorometer before the preparation of RNA-Seq libraries.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180502/20180502001909_4499.jpgFigure 1. Total RNA electrophoresis for low-biomass samples. M: DL2,000 DNA marker; TW: tap water; SC; shower curtain; MW: mudflat surface water; LS: leaf surface; FH: forehead of human skin. Only TW and MW display integral 23S and 16S rRNA bands when 10 μl RNA is loaded, in contrast to samples that yield a very low concentration of RNA (< 2 ng/μl).",
    "Preparation of RNA-Seq librariesThis RNA-Seq library preparation protocol is modified from the Gnomegen RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit protocol (catalog number: K02421-T). Prepare RNA-Seq libraries following the steps described below.Total RNA denaturationAdd total RNA (10-100 ng) and DNase/RNase free water into a 0.2 ml PCR tube to make a 20-μl reaction volume.Mix well and incubate at 65 °C for 5 min using a thermal cycler program. Place the tube on ice immediately after the incubation and leave for at least 5 min.Note: We use this step to substitute the original fragmentation step as to keep the integrity of the RNA and directly ligate the RNA-Seq adaptor to the 5’ end of the rRNA in the following step.Adaptor ligation to 5’ end of RNAAdd the following reagents sequentially to the denatured RNA, and make a reaction volume of 40.6 μl:table:",
    "﻿0,1\n10x ligation buffer,3.6 μl (Final ~0.9x)\n10 mM ATP,4 μl (Final ~1 mM)\nLigation enzyme mix,1 μl\nLigation enzyme supplement,1 μl\nRNaseOUT (40 U/μl),1 μl (Final ~1 U/μl)\nLigation enhancer mix,8 μl\nRNA Seq 5’ Adaptor B,2 μl\nMix well and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h using a thermal cycler program. Place the tube on ice after incubation.Note: RNaseOUT is a separately-purchased reagent. Such specific ligation between single-stranded Adaptor B and RNA avoids the interference of DNA for the community analysis.Purification of ligation productTransfer 40 μl ligation product to a new 1.5 ml tube, and purify the product using a Gnome Size Selector, strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. A total volume of 10-μl purified product is obtained for the next step.Note: Warm Gnome Size Selector to room temperature, and completely resuspend the Size Selector before use. Accurately use the volume that is recommended.Synthesize the first strand of cDNA with a tagged random hexamer.Denaturation of ligation productAdd 1 μl tagged RT primer and 1 μl dNTP (10 mM) to the purified ligation product in a 12-μl denaturation volume.Mix well and incubate at 65 °C for 5 min using a thermal cycler program. Place the tube on ice immediately after the incubation and leave for at least 5 min.Reverse transcriptionAdd the following reagents sequentially into the denatured ligation product, and make a final 20-μl reaction volume:table:\n﻿0,1\n5x First Strand Buffer,4 μl\n100 mM DTT,2 μl\nRNaseOUT (40 U/μl),1 μl\nReverse Transcriptase,1 μl",
    "Mix well and use the following thermal cycler program to synthesize the cDNA: 25 °C for 12 min; 42 °C for 40 min; 70 °C for 15 min;Hold at 4 °C.cDNA purificationPurification is performed using a Gnome Size Selector strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 20 μl purified cDNA is obtained for the next step.Note: Warm Gnome Size Selector to room temperature, and completely resuspend the Size Selector before use. Accurately use the volume that is recommended.PCR amplificationThe complete reagent mixture contains:table:\n﻿0,1\nPurified single-stranded cDNA,20 μl\n2x HiFi PCR Master Mix,25 μl\nPCR Primer F,1.25 μl\nBarcoded reverse primer bcX,1.25 μl\nDNAse/RNase free water,2.5 μl",
    "Note: Forward and reverse primers are designed based on the RNA Seq 5’ Adaptor B and tag sequences, and are complementary to the standard Illumina forward and reverse primers. Therefore, the whole process avoids the utilization of microbe-related universal primers. The reverse primer also contains an 8-nucleotide (nt) indexing sequence to allow for multiplexing.The PCR amplification conditions are as follows: 98 °C for 45 sec; 15 cycles of: 98 °C for 15 sec, 60 °C for 30 sec, 72 °C for 30 sec; 72 °C for 1 min; Hold at 4 °C.Note: Usually, 1-2 μl PCR products is enough for visualization on a 1% agarose gel. As a result, a wide range of clear and smear bands (100-2,000 bp) will be observed.Purification of PCR productSize select the 400-600 base pair (bp) PCR product using a Gnome Size Selector strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Note: Warm Gnome Size Selector to room temperature, and completely resuspend the Size Selector before use. Accurately use the volume that is recommended. Other size ranges of PCR product can also be obtained using Gnome Size Selector according to the manufacturer’s instructions.High-throughput sequencingQuantify barcoded PCR product from different samples using a QubitTM dsDNA HS Assay Kit on Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. Mix together PCR product from different samples with equal quantity (at least 10 ng for each sample) and sequence on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the 2 x 300 paired end protocol. For each sample, paired-end reads formatted as two FASTQ files will be obtained."
