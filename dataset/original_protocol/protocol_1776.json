We use [U-13C]-glucose to trace glucose carbon, [4-2H]-glucose to trace electron transfer of glycolytic NADH, and [3-2H]-glucose to trace electron transfer of oxidative PPP. The overall workflow is illustrated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1365-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic workflow of isotope labeled glucose tracing of cells\n(A) [4-2H]-glucose tracing of NADH for 12 h.\n(B) [3-2H]-glucose tracing of NADPH for 4 h.\n(C) [U-13C]-glucose tracing of carbon for 5 min.\nCell maintenance and cell culture\nCulture 143B cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine.\nCritical: Use pyruvate-free medium, because pyruvate regenerates NAD+ to alter the NADH/NAD+ ratio (Birsoy et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Sullivan et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])\nSeed 3 million 143B cells onto a 6-cm dish and culture for 16 h, three repeats for one treatment.\nAspirate medium and add fresh medium with DMSO or ETC inhibitors (piericidin A: 10 μM; antimycin A, 10 μM) in the presence or absence of NAD+ regeneration supplementations (3 mM pyruvate or 3 mM α-ketobutyrate). Incubate for 2 h.\nNote: Pretreatment of cells with ETC inhibitors increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio to enable the detection of metabolic rewiring.\nIncubate cells with isotope labeled glucose or normal glucose and add the extraction buffer.\nFor deuterium-glucose tracing.\nQuickly wash cells with PBS twice.\nAdd 4 mL deuterium-glucose (10 mM) tracing medium supplemented with the same inhibitors as pre-treatment and incubate for the indicated time (12 h for [4-2H]-glucose, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A; 4 h for [3-2H]-glucose, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). 3 repeats of normal glucose (10 mM) medium are used as control medium.",
    "Note: Normal glucose medium is used to correct and calculate the natural abundance of the isotopes in metabolic data processing. Inhibitor treatment in normal glucose medium is not required.\nQuickly wash cells with PBS twice.\nAspirate PBS and add 1 mL ice-cold acetonitrile/methanol/water (4/4/2) containing 0.1 M formic acid to the dishes on ice.\nNote: This extraction buffer decreases the interconversion between NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+ (Lu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nIncubate cells on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 87 μL 15% ammonium bicarbonate to neutralize samples. Mix immediately after addition.\nFor [U-13C]-glucose tracing.\nQuickly wash cells with PBS twice.\nIncubate cells with the [U-13C]-glucose (10mM) tracing medium supplemented with the same inhibitors as pre-treatment (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Start a 5 min timer.\nAfter incubation for 4 min and 20 s, quickly aspirate medium and wash cells with PBS twice.\nAspirate PBS and add 1 mL −80°C pre-chilled 80% methanol when the timer reaches 5 min.\nPut the dish on dry ice immediately.\nNote: [U-13C]-glucose quickly saturates the 13C-labeling of glycolysis intermediates within minutes. 5-min tracing has reached the steady state labeling of glycolysis intermediates, but the interchange of glycolysis intermediates (F6P and G3P) with non-oxidative PPP intermediates (R/X5P, S7P and E4P) are not saturated, allowing the detection of the altered labeling pattern of non-oxidative PPP intermediates under ETC inhibition (see results in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]F).\nCritical: Because of the short tracing time, we strictly control the total time from step ii-iv as 5 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) and recommend handling the samples one by one.\nMetabolite extraction\nScrape cells on ice and collect the cell lysate in a tube.\nVortex the cell lysate at 4°C for 1 min.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully transfer the supernatants to a new tube and keep the pellets.",
    "Dry the supernatants by a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator at 4°C.\nStore dried samples at −80°C.\nCritical: To avoid metabolite degradation, analyze the samples within 24 h.\nDissolve the remaining cell pellets in step d in 600 μL 0.1 M KOH by shaking on a tube rotator at 4°C for 10–16 h.\nMeasure protein concentration by the Bradford assay kit.\nExtraction of the NADH/NAD+ ratio-sensitive metabolites in mouse plasma and liver following phenformin treatment\nTiming: 8 days for step 4\nTiming: 1–2 days for steps 5–7\nPhenformin treatment increases hepatic NADH/NAD+ ratio and alters ratio-sensitive metabolism in mice. This step performs oral gavage of phenformin, followed by collection of plasma and liver samples, and metabolite extraction from collected samples. The overall workflow is illustrated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nNote: Any animal procedures described in this protocol should be cleared with local ethics and animal handling regulations of your institution.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1365-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic workflow of measuring NADH/NAD+ ratio-sensitive metabolites in mouse plasma and mouse liver following phenformin treatment\nMouse maintenance and oral gavage administration\nMaintain C57BL/6J mice at 6–8 weeks old under a 12-h light/dark cycle and on a standard chow diet at the specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility.\nGently restrain the mouse by grasping the loose skin of the neck and back to immobilize the head.\nNote: Try not to cause any animal vocalization or other signs of distress.\nMaintain the mouse in a vertical position and pass the gavage needle into the esophagus.\nNote: If resistance is encountered, alter the needle position.\nInject the compound after the needle is passed to the stomach.\nNote: If the mouse struggles vigorously when compound administration begins, stop and withdraw the needle immediately. If compounds have been injected into the lungs, the mouse should be euthanized.",
    "Oral gavage mice daily with vehicle (water) or phenformin consecutively for 8 days before metabolic analysis.\nMouse blood collection and liver dissection\nRestrain the mouse with the left hand by grasping the loose skin over the shoulders and behind the ears (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nPuncture the vein with a 25 gauge needle slightly behind the mandible, but in front of the ear canal (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B–4D).\nNote: Use a swift motion to puncture and only the tip of the needle should enter the vessel to a shallow depth of 1–2 mm.\nCollect about 350 μL blood into the blood collection tube held by another person (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: Blood will flow immediately after puncture. The person holding the blood collection tube should be prepared right under the puncturing site.\nCritical: Do not squeeze the vessel during blood collection to avoid rupture of red blood cells.\nPut the blood sample on ice.\nSacrifice the mice immediately after blood collection.\nDissect out the liver and immediately put it into the 2 mL Eppendorf tube and freeze in liquid nitrogen within seconds.\nNote: If collecting multiple tissues (e.g., the liver and the brain) from the same mouse, we recommend collaboration by two people to shorten the processing time after mouse death.\nStore frozen tissues at −80°C.\nNote: Tissues can be stored at −80°C for weeks.\nExtract plasma metabolites immediately after blood collection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1365-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Blood collection and extraction\n(A) Depicting the mouse restraining gesture.\n(B–D) To determine the accurate puncture site, draw a straight line from the bottom of the mandible to the caudal portion of the ear (B) and from the top of the eye to the point of the shoulder (C).

The upper plasma layer is colorless, which suggests no occurrence of hemolysis.\n(G) White flocculent precipitation after mixing plasma with the extraction buffer.\n(H) The vortex with a microtube holder.\nMetabolite extraction from mouse plasma\nCentrifuge blood samples at 1,500 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: After centrifugation, if red blood cells are intact during blood collection, the upper plasma fraction is nearly colorless (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F). If the red blood cells are ruptured during blood collection, the upper plasma fraction is pink or red. The intracellular metabolites of ruptured red blood cells may enter the plasma and alter plasma metabolite concentration.\nDuring centrifugation, prepare a new Eppendorf tube with 1 mL extraction buffer (acetonitrile/methanol/water (4/4/2)) on ice for each sample.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully transfer 50 μL upper plasma fraction into the extraction buffer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nMix the extraction buffer and the plasma sample immediately by up and down shaking.\nVortex all the samples on a microtube holder (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H) for 1 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge samples at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatants to a new tube.\nNote: Be careful not to perturb the pellets.\nDry the supernatants by a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator at 4°C.\nStore dried samples at −80°C before mass-spec analysis.\nCritical: To avoid metabolites degradation, analyze the samples within 24 h.\nMetabolite extraction from mouse liver\nPut −80°C frozen tissues into liquid nitrogen.\nGrind the tissue in a mixer mill MM400 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) at liquid nitrogen temperature.\nPrechill the rack in a liquid nitrogen bath and put the tissue containing tubes into the rack.\nRun at 30 frequency/s for 30 s.\nPut the tissue containing tubes into liquid nitrogen before weighing.",
    "Note: This dry cryogenic grinding can also be done by liquid nitrogen grinding in a mortar manually.\nWeigh approximate 30 mg tissues into the pre-cooled homogenizing tube with 12 zirconia grinding beads (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Seal the tube and put it into liquid nitrogen.\nAfter weighing all the tissue samples, put the tubes on ice and add approximately 600 μL ice-cold acetonitrile/methanol/water (4/4/2) (20 μL/mg).\nHomogenize tissue for 1 min at 6.5 m/s at 4°C in the tissue homogenizer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) and put on ice for 2 min. Repeat homogenization and cooling.\nNote: It is critical to maintain low sample temperature during homogenization. We perform tissue homogenization in the 4°C cold room.\nCentrifuge samples at 20,000 g for 1 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatants into new Eppendorf tubes.\nCentrifuge samples at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatants to new Eppendorf tubes.\nDry the supernatants by a Speedvac vacuum concentrator at 4°C.\nStore dried samples at −80°C before mass-spec analysis.\nCritical: To avoid metabolites degradation, analyze the samples within 24 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1365-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "This step performs metabolite analysis of the cell line samples produced from steps 1–3 and mouse samples produced from steps 4–7. The cell line samples contain both isotope labeled and unlabeled metabolites, while mouse samples only contain unlabeled metabolites. The procedures for analyzing labeled and unlabeled metabolites are similar. We thus describe them together and also add notes in specific steps.\nPreparation of stock solution of metabolite standards.\nCritical: The solutions of NAD, NADH, NADPH need to be prepared freshly on the day of LC-MS experiment. Other standard solution aliquots can be stored at −80°C for 4 weeks.\nPrepare 1 mg/mL stock of metabolite standards (see table of metabolite standards[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]) with ultrapure water.\nNote: If the compound is not fully dissolved, sonicate at 25°C for 20 min.\nPrepare the 10 μg/mL mixed standard solution.\nTake 10 μL from each 1 mg/mL stock solution of metabolite standard.\nAdd to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 50% MeOH to make the final volume of 1 mL.\nSplit the 1 mL 10 μg/mL mixed standard solution into 10 aliquots of 100 μL and store at −80°C.\nOn the day of experiment, take one aliquot of mixed standard solution and run parallelly with biological samples.\nLC-MS analysis of metabolites\nPut dried samples stored at −80°C on ice.\nImmediately add 100 μL 50% methanol to the samples and vortex 10 s to resuspend samples.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nFilter the supernatants through 0.45 μm filters.\nNote: Filtration can remove the remaining insoluble particles to extend the column lifetime.\nTransfer filtered supernatants to HPLC glass vials with micro-inserts and screw the cap.\nAnalyze the biological samples parallelly with the 10 μg/mL mixed standard solution using a high-resolution LC-MS system, e.g., Vanquish UHPLC - Q Exactive HF-X Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap MS (Thermo Scientific).",
    "Note: Other high resolution mass spectrometers, such as QTOF, can also be used for this application with only slight modification of MS parameters according to the specific instrumental setup. In case of unit resolution mass spectrometers, such as QQQ, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode is recommended for higher specificity. For unlabeled metabolites, the MRM parameters need to be optimized using metabolite standards. For isotope-labeled metabolites, few metabolite standards are commercially available; therefore, both the position of labeling and the fragmentation pattern of the metabolites need to be known to calculate the MRM product ion.\nThe following Liquid chromatography conditions were applied: Column: SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column, 3.5 μm, 100 Å, 100×2.1 mm; Mobile phase A: 10 mM ammonium acetate in ACN/water 5/95 (v/v); Mobile phase B: 10 mM ammonium acetate in ACN/water 95/5 (v/v); Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min; Column temperature: 40°C; Gradient: 0–5 min, 99% B; 5–20 min, 99%–20% B; 20–21 min, 20%–99% B; 21–25 min, 99% B.\nThe following MS parameters were applied for Q Exactive HF-X system: ESI source setting (positive mode): Spray voltage 3.5 kV, auxiliary gas heater temperature: 380°C, capillary temperature: 320°C, sheath gas flow rate: 35 units, auxiliary gas flow: 10 units. ESI source setting (negative mode): Spray voltage: 2.5 kV, auxiliary gas heater temperature: 380°C, capillary temperature: 320°C, sheath gas flow rate: 30 units, auxiliary gas flow: 10 units.\nScan parameters: MS1 full scan, m/z range: 66.7 to 1,000, resolution 60,000, AGC target 3e6, and maximum injection time 200 ms.\nLC-MS data processing The following data processing was performed by the Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser software (4.2).\nNote: If another mass spec instrument is used, use the corresponding vendor software to retrieve the ion chromatogram, retention time and peak height of the target metabolite.",
    "Use m/z for unlabeled (M+0) metabolites (see table of retention time and m/z of targeted metabolites[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]) to calculate their M+1, M+2, M+3… isotopologues using the following equation:\n  m /  z  M + n   = m /  z  M + 0   + n × D i f f  \nwhere   m /  z  M + n     is the m/z of M+n isotopologue, n is the number of labeled atoms,   m /  z  M + 0     is the m/z of unlabeled metabolite, and Diff is the mass difference between 2H and 1H, or 13C and 12C (see the following table).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1365_8.csv\nFor example, the m/z of NADH M+0 is 666.1321, then the m/z of 2H-labeled NADH M+1 is 666.1321+1∗ 1.0063=667.1384.\nNote: NAD, NADP, NADPH are labeled by 2H while other glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolites are labeled by 13C. For unlabeled metabolites such as alanine and aspartate, use m/z of M+0 in the following steps.\nOpen the metabolite data by the software. Retrieve the ion chromatograms for the target metabolite using its [M+H]+ or [M-H]- accurate m/z (table of retention time and m/z of targeted metabolites[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]) with the mass tolerance of 10 ppm. Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A shows the retrieve setting for NADH isotopologues (M+0 to M+4).\nIdentify the retention time of the target metabolite in the metabolite standard sample. Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B shows the retention time of NADH isotopologues, e.g., 12.40 for NADH (M+0).",
    "Use the above retention time (retention time window: 0.1 min) as the reference to identify the metabolites and record the peak heights, which represents metabolite concentration. As shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, the NADH isotopologues in the normal glucose sample consist of M+0 (peak height: 2037327), M+1 (peak height: 537089) and M+2 (peak height: 172573). The NADH isotopologues in the [4-2H]-glucose sample consist of M+0 (peak height: 1229633), M+1 (peak height: 1192633), M+2 (peak height: 531912) and M+3 (peak height: 209730) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nCritical: Carefully check the retention times of all the metabolites.
