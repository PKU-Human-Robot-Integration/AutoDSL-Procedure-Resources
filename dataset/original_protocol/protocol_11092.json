    "All mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions at the University of Pennsylvania according to NIH guidelines and with approval of the University of Pennsylvania IACUC. Euthanasia was performed following the University of Pennsylvania Laboratory Animal Resources standard operating procedures.\n1. KitV558Δ/+ mouse breeding\nBackcross the KitV558Δ/+ mice more than 10 times onto a C57BL/6J background using C57BL/6J mice. To do this, breed the male KitV558Δ/+ mice with female C57BL/6J mice at a 1:2 ratio.\n\tNOTE: The homozygous KitV558Δ/V558Δ genotype is lethal in utero. It is possible to breed female KitV558Δ/+ mice with male C57BL/6J mice, but litter size is about half as that seen from female wildtype C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, female KitV558Δ/+ mice produce limited litters after 4 months of age.\nGenotype the pups at 7-14 days of age by toe clipping to confirm the presence of the KitV558Δ/+ genotype. Use the forward primer: TCTCCTCCAGAAACCCATGTATGAA; reporter 1: CCTCGACAACCTTCCA; reverse primer: TTGCGTCGGGTCTATGTAAACAT; and reporter 2: TCTCCTCGACCTTCCA for genotyping.\n2. KitV558Δ/+ mouse treatment\nAge and sex match the KitV558Δ/+ mice prior to treatment. Use the age- and sex-matched mice in cohorts as tumors from female KitV558Δ/+ mice are larger than those in male mice. Treat the mice at 8-12 weeks old, at which time tumors are established (Figure 1).\nGive tyrosine kinase inhibitors orally or by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection; KitV558Δ/+ tumors are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Provide imatinib in a dose of 600 mg/L in drinking water or i.p. injections of 45 mg/kg twice daily. Measure tumor weight reduction using digital scales after dissection of tumor as shown in step 3, which is approximately 50% at 1 week and 80% at 4 weeks following treatment with imatinib (Figure 2).\n3. KitV558Δ/+ mouse organ harvest",
    "Euthanize mice by CO2 narcosis at a flow rate of 60% chamber volume per min. Leave mice in the chamber for at least 2 min after respiration has ceased, then perform cervical dislocation to confirm death.\nSterilize all instruments, wear gloves throughout the procedure, and maintain a sterile field. Prepare the skin with 70% ethanol. Make a 2 cm midline vertical incision using scissors and enter the abdominal cavity. Sharply lyse any intra-abdominal adhesions.\nTo remove the draining mesenteric lymph node, follow the steps described below.\n\t\nIdentify the cecum and lift its mesentery superiorly. Approximately midway to the base of the colonic mesentery, identify the mesenteric lymph node and sharply dissect it. The lymph node is off-white and about 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm in size.\nDivide lymph node tissue into thirds for protein isolation, histology, and single cell suspension, as needed. For single cell suspensions, place lymph node tissue in 20 mL of serum free media (RPMI) and keep on ice.\nFor isolation of the GIST and cecum, follow the steps described below.\n\t\nThe cecum in KitV558Δ/+ mice is mostly replaced by a GIST. Carefully divide the ileocolic junction from the base of the tumor. To collect the cecum, divide the colon again, 2 cm proximal to the base of the tumor.\nIn 50%-60% of KitV558Δ/+ mice, the head of the tumor contains a cap of cecal tissue, which typically contains serous fluid but may rarely contain pus (Figure 3). Sharply dissect the cap tissue away from the tumor tissue.\nDivide tumor tissue and/or cecum into thirds for protein isolation, histology, and single cell suspension, as needed. For single cell suspensions, place tumor tissue or cecum in HBSS with 2% FCS, enough to cover the sample and keep on ice.\n4. Western blot analysis of GIST tissue",
    "Prepare tissue lysis buffer containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% nondenaturing detergent, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM NaF, and 20 μl/ml proteinase inhibitor mixture.\nPrepare a 1x Tris-buffered saline solution with 1% Tween 20 (TBST) by combining 1800 mL of deionized water, 2 mL of Tween 20, and 200 mL of 10x Tris-buffered saline (TBS).\nResuspend tissue from step 3.4.3 in a FACS tube in 5mL/g of tissue lysis buffer and homogenize twice with a mechanical homogenizer at 15,000 rpm for 15 s on ice. Incubate lysate for 30 min on ice.\nTransfer lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at max speed for 20 min at 4 °C. Transfer supernatant into a new microcentrifuge tube.\nRun lysates on a 4% to 15% gradient gel, then transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, as described in14.\nWash membrane once in 1x TBS for 5 min and then block membrane in 5% milk for 1 h. Again, wash membrane once in 1x TBS for 10 min.\nIncubate membrane in primary antibody diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA at 4 °C overnight. Wash membrane 3x in 1x TBST for 10 min each. Incubate blot with secondary antibody diluted 1:2500 in 2.5% milk for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash membrane once in 1x TBS for 5 min. Add enough HRP substrate to cover membrane, typically 200-500 μL, and use a digital imager to detect and quantify chemiluminescence.\n5. Immunohistochemistry of GIST tissue\nFix tissue from step 3.3.2 or 3.4.3 in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. Store tissue in 70% EtOH until ready for processing. Embed and section blocks at 5 μm thickness onto glass slides, as described15,16.\nComplete immunohistochemical detection using a basic immunodetection kit, as previously described17.",
    "6. Single cell suspension of mesenteric lymph node\nPour RPMI media with lymph node specimen from step 3.3.2 over a 100 μm filter. Move filter to new 50 mL conical and mash lymph node with the soft end of a 3 mL plastic syringe. Wash filter with 20 mL of RPMI media.\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 450 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant. \nResuspend pellet in 20 mL of 1% FBS in PBS (bead buffer) and pour over a 40 μm filter. Collect the cell filtrate. Count cells using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 450 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend in bead buffer at 6 x 107 cells/mL for flow cytometry.\n7. Single cell suspension of GIST\nPrepare collagenase buffer by adding 250 mg of collagenase IV, one tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor and 100 µL of DNase I to 50 mL of HBSS. Rotate for 10 min at room temperature until dissolved.\nPlace GIST in a sterile dish and add 2.5 mL of collagenase buffer. Mince tumor using a sterile scalpel and scissors until the tumor is in fine fragments. Use a large bore pipette to aspirate the tumor and collagenase into a 50 mL tube.\nIncubate in a shaking incubator at 100 rpm at 37 °C for 30 min. Quench reaction with 2 mL of FBS.\nPour collagenase with GIST specimen over a 100 μm filter and mash tumor with the soft end of a 3 mL plastic syringe and collect in a 50 mL tube. Wash filter with 20 mL of HBSS. Centrifuge the filtrate at 450 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant.",

Aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend in bead buffer at 6 x 107 cells/mL for flow cytometry.\n8. Single cell suspension of cecum\nPrepare collagenase buffer as in step 7.1. Using scissors, split the cecum longitudinally to expose the inner mucosa. Cut into 0.5 cm sections and place in a 50 mL tube with 5 mL of HBSS with 2% FBS. Shake vigorously for 30 s, centrifuge at 450 x g for 20 s, then aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL of HBSS with 2 mM EDTA. Incubate in a shaking incubator at 37 °C at 100 rpm for 15 min.
