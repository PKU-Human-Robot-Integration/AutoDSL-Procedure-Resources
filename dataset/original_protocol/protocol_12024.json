    "This protocol is designed to create human gingival tissue equivalents, gingival wound models, and gingivitis models. Human skin epidermal keratinocytes (HaCaT) were kindly provided from Professor Norbert E. Fusenig of Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg, Germany)7. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were isolated from gingival tissues according to the previously published protocols8. Informed consent was obtained beforehand, and the study was approved according to the guidelines set by the Committee of Ethics, the Nippon Dental University School of Life Dentistry at Tokyo (Authorization Number: NDU-T2012-35). Protocol steps 1–3 should be performed in a cell culture hood.\n1. Preparation of 3D Human Tissue Equivalents of Gingiva (GTE) (Figure 1A)\nMix collagen type I-A gel with 10% concentrated MEM-alpha and 10% reconstruction buffer (2.2 g of NaHCO3 and 4.47 g HEPES in 100 mL 0.05 N NaOH) in a 15 mL sterile tube by pipetting. Keep the mixed collagen solution on ice until used.\nPlace 24-well culture inserts (pore size 3.0 µm) into a 24-well plate.\nRemove HGFs from the culture surface using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution. Suspend the cells in 10 mL of culture medium A (MEM-alpha + 20% FBS + 1% GlutaMAX). Count the cells by a Bürker-Türk cell counter.\nExtract the desired quantity of cells (1-5 x105 cells/mL), then centrifuge for 4 min at 190 x g.\nSuspend the cells in the mixed collagen solution. Keep the mixture on ice until the next step.\nAdd 0.5 mL of the cell-collagen mixture (0.5–2.5 x 105 cells/well) into the culture insert without producing any bubbles. Incubate the mixture for 10–30 min in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C to coagulate the mixture into a gel.\n\tNOTE: Add the collagen mixture into the center of the culture insert to avoid unequal formation of collagen gel.",
    "Add 1 mL of the culture medium into the well and 0.5 mL into the insert. Incubate the culture plate for 24 h or overnight in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nRemove HaCaT cells from the culture surface using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution. Suspend the cells in 10 mL of medium B (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% GlutaMAX) and count the cells. Extract the needed quantity of cells (1–5 x 105 cells/mL) with a pipette, centrifuge for 4 min at 190 x g. Suspend the cells in medium B.\nRemove the medium from the culture inserts, which contain the HGF-collagen mixture, by aspiration. Add 0.5 mL of HaCaT cell suspension (0.5–2.5 x 105 cells/well) on the top of the HGF-collagen mixture. Incubate the cultures for 24 h or overnight.\n\tNOTE: At this time point, the medium in the culture well should be medium A, while the medium in the culture insert should be medium B.\nReplace the culture medium with KSR medium (co-culture medium) (MEM-alpha + 15% KnockOut Serum Replacement + 1% GlutaMAX) + 5% FBS. Add 1 mL of the culture medium into the culture well and 0.5 mL into the culture insert. Incubate the cultures for 24–48 h.\nReplace the culture medium with KSR medium + 1% FBS. Add 1 mL into the culture well and 0.5 mL into the culture insert. Incubate the cultures for 24 h or overnight.\nReplace the culture medium in the culture well with 0.7–1 mL KSR medium. Remove the medium completely from the culture insert (the culture surface should be exposed to air). Incubate the cultures for 1–2 weeks. Change the medium in the culture well two times per week.",
    "NOTE: Do not let the medium level rise above the culture surface (the top layer composed of keratinocytes). Always keep the culture surface dry.\n2. Preparation of Wounded GTE (Figure 1B)\nPrepare a 1–3 mm diameter tissue puncher. Sterilize it with an autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min.\nPush the tissue puncher perpendicularly into GTE about 300 µm deep, and punch a hole in the tissue to simulate a wound.\nAt this step, use the wounded GTE for investigating wound healing and tissue regeneration. Alternatively, fix GTE using 10% formalin neutral buffer solution to perform histological analysis.\n3. Preparation of Inflammatory GTE (iGTE) (Figure 1B)\nCultivate THP-1 cells according to the previous report9.\nMix collagen type I-A gel with 10% concentrated RPMI 1640, 10% reconstruction buffer (2.2 g of NaHCO3 and 4.47 g HEPES in 100 mL 0.05 N NaOH) and 10 ng/mL PMA. Keep the mixed collagen solution on ice until use.\nCount 1–2 x 106 THP-1 cells and centrifuge for 4 min at 190 x g. Suspend the cells in 1 mL of the mixed collagen solution. Keep the mixture on ice until the next step.\nAdd 10–30 µL THP-1-collagen mixture into the wounded area of GTE. Replace the culture medium to 0.7–1 mL KSR medium containing 10 ng/mL of PMA.\nIncubate the mixture in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 72 h.\nUse the model for investigating gingivitis or periodontal disease (for example, add potential anti-inflammatory medicine to iGTE to see its effects on cytokine release10). Alternatively, omit 72 h PMA-treatment, add 2 µg/mL of LPS into the culture, and incubate the tissue in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 48 h11,12.\n4. Fixation and Whole Mount Immunostaining of GTE and iGTE Cultures\nFixation of the cultures.",
    "Remove the culture medium from the 24-well plate. Wash the tissues 2 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 1 mL of 10% formalin neutral buffer solution to the insert and 1 mL to the culture well. Leave the 24-well plate in a refrigerator at 4 °C overnight.\nRemove the 10% formalin neutral buffer solution the following day.\nFor whole mount immunostaining, wash the tissues 3-4 times with PBS after fixation.\nFor hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and regular immunostaining, proceed with dehydration, paraffin embedding, and sectioning.\n\t\tNOTE: For whole mount immunostaining, this step can be omitted.\nWhole mount immunostaining\n\tNOTE: This protocol was modified from the one in reference 13.\n\t\nWash the tissues 3x in PBS 0.5–1% Triton, 10–30 min each time.\nIncubate the tissues twice for 30 min in blocking buffer (PBS 1% Triton + 10% BSA), at room temperature.\nWash the tissues 2× in blocking buffer, 5–10 min each time.\nAdd 50 µL of primary antibody solution at the required dilution/concentration to the inserts. Use a thin plastic cling film to wrap the inserts to avoid drying out the tissue.\nIncubate the tissue for 1 to 2 days at 4 °C.\nWash the tissues 3 times, for 30 min in PBS 1% Triton + 10% BSA. Wash again 3 times, for 5 min in PBS 1% Triton.\nAdd 50 µL of secondary antibody in blocking buffer (PBS 1% Triton + 10% BSA) and 5 µL of Hoechst 33342 solution (NucBlue Live Cell stain) to each insert. Use a thin plastic cling film to wrap the inserts to avoid drying out the tissue.\nIncubate for 1 to 2 days at 4 °C. Wrap the 24-well plate in a wet paper towel, and then put it into a plastic pack to be used throughout incubation.",
    "Wash the tissues 3 times, for 10 min in PBS 1% triton\nUse a sharp needle to cut the membrane of the culture insert to obtain the tissue. Place the membrane onto a slide.\n\t\tNOTE: The tissue should be on the membrane.\nAdd 2–3 drops of fluorescence mount medium. Cover the tissue with a cover glass and store at 4 °C in the dark until analysis.\nView tissues with a confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM).\nSubscription Required.
