    "1. Scanning for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), HRMA primer design, and primer validation\nSNP identification in wild-type laboratory colony mosquitoes\n\t\nSelect the target exon to disrupt proper polypeptide translation.\n\t\tNOTE: The target should be close to the start codon or amongst key residues required for protein function. The shorter the exon (e.g., ≤200 bases), the more difficult it is to target and analyze. Avoid editing close to the boundaries of an exon, as this forces one of the HRMA primers to either cross an intron or be in an intron. This is undesirable because SNP rates tend to be much greater in those regions.\nPrimer design\n\t\t\nGo to the NCBI Blast - Primer Blast website15, copy and paste the chosen exon in the box at the top of the page | choose the PCR product size (ensure it encompasses most of the exon) | choose the organism.\nClick on Advanced parameters | Opt (for PCR Product Tm) and add 60 (for an optimal temperature of 60 °C) | Get Primers. Keep the other parameters as default.\nObtain genomic DNA (gDNA) from the wild-type laboratory colony. Set aside 10 mosquitoes, anesthetize them with CO2, and place them in a Petri dish on ice to keep them inactive. Set up 10 tubes containing 0.5 µL of the reagent for release of DNA from tissue and 20 µL of dilution buffer, both provided in the DNA release kit suggested in the Table of Materials.\nRemove one leg from a single mosquito using forceps and place it in a corresponding tube of a diluted solution of the DNA-release reagent (from step 1.1.3), completely submerging the leg in the solution. Repeat this step with the remaining mosquitoes, wiping the forceps with 70% ethanol before proceeding to the next one.",
    "Incubate the leg-containing solution at room temperature for 2-5 min, then at 98 °C for 2 min, and allow it to cool down while setting up the PCR reaction.\n\t\tNOTE: Plates containing the released gDNA can be stored at -20 °C, and the protocol can be paused at this point.\nPrepare 10 tubes containing 10 µL of 2x PCR Master Mix, primers to a 0.5 µM final concentration, and molecular grade water to a final volume of 20 µL, and transfer 1 µL of the diluted sample to each tube. Perform PCR following these cycling parameters: 98 °C 5 min, 40 cycles of 98 °C for 5 s, 60 °C 30 s, 72 °C 20 s per kb; final extension of 72 °C for 1 min.\nPurify the PCR products with an enzyme to degrade the residual PCR primers and dephosphorylate excess dNTPs or any column clean-up kit. Proceed with sequencing the samples.\nAnalyze each electropherogram for the presence of double peaks/ambiguous bases, and adjust base calls manually in each sequence using the appropriate degenerate base code.\n\t\tNOTE: This step must be performed before multiple sequence alignment as it is common for the base-calling software to select the more prominent peak as the \"true\" base call, giving the false impression of an absence of SNPs.\nPerform a multiple sequence alignment using the alignment software, SeqMan Pro, listed in the Table of Materials or other open-source alignment software, such as ClustalW16 or T-Coffee17.\n\t\t\nOpen the alignment software | click on Add Sequences | select the desired sequences and click on Add | once all sequences are chosen, click on Done.\nClick on Assemble to perform the alignment. To open the alignment, click on Contig 1 and analyze the alignment and identify the SNPs (Figure 1).",
    "NOTE: As an alternative to steps 1.1.3-1.1.6, PCR can be performed from isolated genomic DNA obtained from bulk samples (derived from >10 individuals). Sequenced amplicons can be analyzed directly for the presence of SNPs appearing as double peaks in the electropherogram, though rare SNPs will be more difficult to detect.\nDesign 3-5 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), avoiding regions containing any SNP identified above, following the protocol described in18.\nHRMA primer design\n\t\nTest the exon sequence for the possible formation of secondary structures during PCR using mFold19.\n\t\t\nGo to the UNAFold Web Server | click on mFold | on the dropdown menu, click on Applications | DNA Folding Form.\nEnter the sequence name in the box and paste the exon.\nChange the folding temperature to 60 °C; on the Ionic conditions, change [Mg++] to 1.5 and on Units switch to mM; click on Fold DNA.\nOn Output, below Structure 1, click on pdf to open the Circular Structure Plots. \nGo to NCBI Blast - Primer Blast15 for primer design.\nCopy and paste the selected exon sequence determined by sequencing in step 1.1 (the sequence that contains the lowest number of SNPs or no SNPs) in the box at the top of the page.\nUse the symbol < > to mark and exclude sequences that contain SNPs, the target site, and regions with possible formation of secondary structure.\nSelect the PCR product size to be between 80 and 150 bp and choose the organism.\n\t\tNOTE: Larger fragment sizes can be successfully used (~300 bp). However, longer amplicons may decrease sensitivity between sequences differing in one or just a few base pairs.\nClick on Get Primers. Select 2–3 pairs of primers to be tested (ideally, primer sites are ≥20–50 bp away from any CRISPR target sites).\nPrimer validation",
    "Perform a gradient PCR using gDNA from a single individual.\n\t\t\nPrepare a master mix and remove one sample for the non-template control (NTC) in a separate tube. Add the template to the remaining master mix and aliquot into a 96-well plate.\nFollow the cycling parameters: 98 °C 30 s, 34 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55–65 °C 30 s, 72 °C 15 s; final extension of 72 °C for 10 min.\nGenerate thermal melt profiles following the parameters: denaturation step 95 °C for 1 min, annealing 60 °C for 1 min, melt curve detection between 75 °C and 95 °C in 0.2 °C increments, with a hold time of 10 s at each temperature.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Only annealing temperatures with a single thermal melt profile should be used.\nProceed to generate the mutant lines with embryo injections as described in12.\n2. Preparation of genomic DNA from mosquito legs\nSeparate the G1 mosquitoes by sex at the pupal stage so that they do not mate before genotyping, and make sure that age-matched, wild-type control mosquitoes will be available to be used for references and backcrosses. Sex-separate them likewise.\nGather the materials needed (Figure 2A) and prepare a 96 well PCR plate with 0.5 µL of the DNA-release reagent and 20 µL of dilution buffer (from the gDNA release kit) per individual to be genotyped (Figure 2B) and leave it on ice. Reserve two reactions for NTC.\nLabel a tray for mosquito vials (Drosophila vials) so each well on the 96-plate corresponds to the respective mosquito vial in the tray.\nAnesthetize the G1 mosquitos with CO2 and place them in a glass Petri dish to keep them sedated (Figure 2C,D). Anesthetize and place 8 wild-type mosquitoes in a second Petri dish.",
    "Wipe a pair of tweezers with 70% ethanol and remove one of the mosquito hind legs (Figure 2E,F).\nSubmerge the leg in the DNA-release reagent solution, place the mosquito in the corresponding vial, and close it with a sponge (Figure 2G,H).\nWipe the tweezers again with 70% ethanol and proceed with removing the leg from the next mosquito. Repeat steps 2.5-2.7 until the 96-well plate is completed.\n\tNOTE: It is important to wipe the tweezers with 70% ethanol. This minimizes DNA cross-contamination.\nSeal the plate with an optical PCR plate seal (Figure 2I) and incubate the 96-well plate containing the legs at room temperature (RT) for 2-5 min and then at 98 °C for 2 min. Allow the plate to cool down to RT while preparing the PCR mix.\n\tNOTE: The entire process typically takes 3-4 h. If the mosquitoes must be kept in the vials for more time than the expected duration (especially ≥1 day), place a small piece of raisin (or source of sugar and water) with each mosquito to ensure the survival of the mosquitoes during extended incubations.\n3. HRMA\nPerform PCR.\n\t\nPrepare a master mix containing the following components per each reaction: 10 µL of 2x buffer (from the gDNA release kit), 0.5 µM of each primer, 1 µL of EvaGreen dye, 0.4 µL of polymerase (from gDNA release kit), and complete to 19 µL with molecular-grade water.\nUsing a multichannel pipet, transfer 19 µL of the master mix into each well. Transfer 1 µL of the DNA release solution containing mosquito DNA prepared in section 2 to the plate (Figure 3A). Seal the plate with an optical PCR plate seal.",
    "Perform the PCR following the cycling parameters: 98 °C for 5 min, 39 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, the chosen annealing temperature (72 °C) for 30 s; final extension 72 °C for 2 min.\nGenerate thermal melt profiles following the parameters: denaturation step 95 °C for 1 min, annealing 60 °C for 1 min, melt curve detection between 75 °C and 95 °C in 0.2 °C increments, with a hold time of 10 s at each temperature. See the Supplemental Material and Supplemental Figure S1-S5 for a detailed description of the software setup for HRMA run using the CFX96 Real-Time System.\nExamine the melt profiles (Figure 3B). Assign wild-type control to the reference cluster.\n\tNOTE: The software (see the Table of Materials) automatically normalizes the data and designates clusters with colors for different melt curves.\nMark the different clusters with corresponding colors on the 96-well template (Figure 3C).\nSelect the individuals with curves of interest, remove them from the tubes, and backcross (Figure 3D). Blood-feed the mated females and collect G2 eggs.\n4. Sequence verification by Sanger sequencing\nPurify the PCR product from the wells with selected mosquitoes (from the plate prepared in section 3.1), using an enzyme to degrade the residual PCR primers, and dephosphorylate excess dNTPs. Alternatively, use any column clean-up kit and proceed with sequencing the samples.\n\tNOTE: Direct sequencing may be more challenging when the PCR product size is small (≤200 bp). In such cases, design primers to amplify larger fragments encompassing the target site (≥250 bp) and amplify by PCR using the DNA in the 96-well plate (step 2.2).\nAnalyze and identify the indels using trace viewer software (Figure 4). Alternatively, Poly Peak Parser software20 can help detect the mutation in heterozygous individuals.",
    "Go to the Poly Peak Parser website, select the sequence from the mutant individuals on the Browse menu, and copy and paste the reference sequence on the box.\n\t\tNOTE: The alignment between the alternate allele and the reference will appear automatically on the right side of the screen.\nSubscription Required.
