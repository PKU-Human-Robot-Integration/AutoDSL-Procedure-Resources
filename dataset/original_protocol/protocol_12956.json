    "Ethics statement: Manipulations included in this protocol were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Geneva University Hospital and by the Ethical Committee SUD EST IV (Agreement 12/111) 19. Human islets were isolated from pancreases of brain-dead multi-organ donors in the Islet Transplantation Centre at the University Hospital of Geneva (Switzerland) as described by us in references 16,18, or obtained from a commercial source.\n1. Preparation of Primary Cell Culture\nHuman Pancreatic Islet Isolation, Dissociation and Culture\n\tNOTE: Coat every tube, plastic tip or pipette with Connaught Medical Research Laboratories (CMRL) medium in order to prevent islets or islet cells from sticking to the plastic surface, which can lead to a significant loss of cell material.\n\t\nOne day prior to islet cell dissociation add 1 ml of laminin-5-rich extracellular matrix (derived from 804G cells as described in reference 29) per 3.5 cm dish. Before plating cells, aspirate the matrix and wash the dish 3 times with sterile bi-distillated water. Allow the dish to dry under the laminar flow cabinet for 5 min.\nInside the laminar flow cabinet, distribute the obtained islets with CMRL medium into 15 ml tube(s). Centrifuge at 272 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, and then resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) pre-warmed to 37 °C without calcium and magnesium. Centrifuge at 272 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of DPBS.",
    "To count the total number of islets, pipet 10 µl from the 1 ml islet suspension into a new 3.5 cm dish. Count the number of islets in the 10 µl drop under the microscope and from this calculate the total number of islets in the 1 ml islet suspension. Add 14 ml of DPBS and centrifuge the cell suspension one more time at 272 x g for 5 min.\nFor islet cell dissociation, aspirate the supernatant and add 1 ml of cell detachment solution for a maximum of 1,000 islet equivalents (IEQ). Place the tube in a water bath at 37 °C and gently mix the islets by pipetting up and down several times every minute, during 6-10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: To check the digestion quality, pipet a 2 µl drop of suspension on a glass slide and check under the microscope that all cells are well separated, and that no doublets or cell clumps have remained.\nStop the reaction by adding 14 ml of cold CMRL with supplements (10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% of L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S), 1% gentamycin, 1% sodium pyruvate). Centrifuge at 425 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and add 15 ml of CMRL medium to the cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in a small volume of CMRL with supplements. Count the number of cells under the microscope using a hemocytometer, adjust the CMRL volume in order to obtain a cell concentration of ~650, 000 cells/ml.\nPipet 3 separated drops of 100 µl each from the dispersed cell suspension obtained in step 1.1.8 in a 3.5 cm dish pre-coated with laminin.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells attach to the dish in about 24 hr.",
    "Incubate cells (Figure 1A) in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C in a humid chamber. Change the medium of the cell drops every 2-3 days by aspirating 100 µl from each drop and replacing it with the same volume of fresh medium.\nHuman Primary Myoblast Culture and Differentiation into Myotubes\n\t\nTissue biopsy, satellite cell isolation and myoblast culture\n\t\tNote: Muscle biopsies were obtained from the group of Etienne Lefai (INSERM, Lyon, France) 19.\n\t\t\nPurify primary skeletal myoblasts according to the previously described procedure 30.\nDifferentiating primary human myoblasts into myotubes\n\t\t\nTake one vial (1 x 106 cells) of human myoblasts stored in liquid nitrogen and thaw cells quickly by putting the vial for 30 sec to 1 min in a water bath at 37 °C with agitation.\nPipet cells (1 ml) into 24 ml of growth medium composed of HAM F-10 supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% P/S, 0.5% gentamycin and 0.2% amphotericin B.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 150 x g.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells with 15 ml of fresh growth medium per 2.5 x 105 cells.\nPlate at least 2.5 x 105 cells per F75 adherent flask. Keep the myoblasts in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOnce cells reach 60-80% confluency, dissociate cells with trypsin-EDTA 0.05% for 1-2 min and plate them in 2 ml of growth medium on adherent 3.5 cm petri dishes.\nAfter reaching confluence, remove the growth medium.\nStart the differentiation protocol of human myoblasts into myotubes by culturing them in 2 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 1 g/L of glucose, 2% FBS, 1% P/S, 0.5% gentamycin and 0.2% amphotericin B (differentiation medium) in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change the medium every 2 to 3 days.",
    "NOTE: Myotubes are usually formed within 7-10 days.\nCheck muscle cell differentiation under the microscope (Figure 2A) by observing the fusion of myoblasts into polynucleated myotubes 19.\n2. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection\nsiRNA Transfection of Human Islet Cells\n\tNOTE: The transfection protocol is performed in drops of 100 µl on the next day after cell dissociation (steps 1.1.1-1.1.10).\n\t\nAspirate 100 µl of CMRL medium from each drop and replace it with the same volume of serum-free Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) 2 hr before transfection by pipetting.\nPrepare a MEM-based mix of transfection reagent and 50 nM of target siRNA (siClock) or 50 nM of non-targeting siControl according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\t\nFor one dish with 3 drops prepare two 1.5 ml tubes with 200 µl of MEM each.\nAdd to one of these tubes 4 µl of transfection reagent.\nAdd to the second tube 1 µl of the of appropriate siRNA stock solution (20 µM).\nAgitate these two tubes slowly on the orbital shaker for 5 min and then mix the content of the tubes together and agitate for 20 more min.\nAspirate 100 µl of MEM from each drop and replace it with the same volume of transfection mix obtained in the previous step by pipetting.\nReplace the transfection solution with CMRL medium after 4 hr of incubation at 37 °C. Repeat steps 2.1.1-2.1.3 the following day for cell re-transfection.\nsiRNA Transfection of Human Myotubes\n\t\nBefore transfection, replace the medium (see step 1.2.2.8) with 2 ml of fresh differentiation medium per 3.5 cm petri dish.",
    "In a sterile 1.5 ml tube, prepare a mix of 20 nM siRNA (siControl or siClock), which corresponds to 2.4 µl of a 20 µM siRNA solution, and 12 µl of transfection reagent diluted in 100 µl of differentiation medium. Incubate the solution at room temperature for 15 min with gentle agitation.\nTransfect cells with 114.4 µl of the siRNA mix per 3.5 cm petri dish and place cells into a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 hr.\n3. Continuous Long-term Circadian Bioluminescence Recording Performed in Parallel with the Assessment of Hormone Secretion in Living Human Primary Cells\nIntroducing Circadian Bioluminescence Reporters into Human Primary Cells by Lentiviral Transduction\n\tNOTE: All procedures with lentiviral particles must be performed in a biosafety level 2 facility to take additional precautions for work with agents that pose a moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment.\n\t\nPrepare reporter lentiviral particles by co-transfecting the vector of interest pLenti6.4/R4R2/V5-DEST/Bmal1-luc or pLV156-Per2-dLuc (called Bmal1-luc and Per2-luc, respectively,) plasmid 31 with lentiviral vectors pMD2G and psPAX into 293T cells using the polyethylenimine method (for detailed procedure see reference 16).\nTitrate the obtained lentiviral particles (details on the titration can be obtained at http://lentilab.unige.ch/). For further experiments, use lentiviruses with titers ranging 104 to 105 transducing units [TU/µl].\nPlace dishes with human islet cells or human myoblasts (at 30-50% confluency) inside the laminar flow cabinet and replace the medium with 2 ml of fresh supplemented CMRL medium (see step 1.1.7) or growth medium (see step 1.2.2.2), respectively.\nCalculate the multiplicity of infection (MOI) (i.e. infectious particles (transducing units)/number of cells).",
    "Transduce the primary cell culture by pipetting lentivirus solution to the dish in order to obtain a MOI = 3 (for example, for 65,000 attached cells add 3 µl of the virus solution with the titer of 6.5 x 104 to 100 µl medium drop).\nIncubate overnight in a tissue culture incubator. Change medium the next day.\n\t\tNOTE: Transduce human islet cells at least 4 days prior to bioluminescence recording in order to achieve sufficient expression of the reporter construct. Myoblasts are transduced during the expansion phase, then grown to confluence, and subsequently differentiated into myotubes.\nIn Vitro Synchronization of Human Primary cells\n\t\nAdd 10 µM of adenylyl cyclase activator in 2 ml of medium per 3.5 cm petri dish containing the primary cells previously transduced in step 3.1.5.\nIncubate for 60 min at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator.\nChange the medium containing the adenylyl cyclase activator with 2.5 ml of the recording medium containing 100 µM luciferin.\n\t\tNOTE: For human islet cells use CMRL supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, 1% P/S, 1% gentamycin; for human myotubes use phenol red - free DMEM with 1 g/L glucose supplemented with 2% FBS, 2% L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, 1% P/S, 0.5% gentamycin and 0.2% amphotericin B.\n4. Parallel Assessment of Circadian Bioluminescence Recording and Hormone Secretion Profiles in Synchronized Human Secretory Primary Cells\nSetting Up Long-term Constant Perifusion and Bioluminescence Recording for Human Primary Cells.\n\tNOTE: When working outside the laminar flow cabinet, clean all contact surfaces and limit exposure of cultures or medium to the air to avoid contamination.\n\t\nTo prepare the perifusion medium, add 100 µM of luciferin to the medium.",
    "NOTE: For human islet cells use CMRL supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, 1% P/S, 1% gentamycin; for human myotubes use phenol red – free DMEM with 1 g/L glucose supplemented with 2% FBS, 2% L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, 1% P/S, 0.5% gentamycin and 0.2% amphotericin B.\nInside the laminar flow cabinet, open the 3.5 cm dishes containing the transduced, transfected and synchronized primary cell cultures (islet cells or myotubes) as described above. Insert sterile metallic caps (developed in house) (Figure 1B2) into the 3.5 cm dishes that are equipped with silicone influx/efflux connecting tubes (Figure 1B1/B5).\nPlace the dishes on the measurement platform in the 37 °C light-tight incubator. Fix the dishes to the platform by using a screwable adaptor (Figure 1B3). Insert the influx/efflux tubes of the perifusion system into the appropriate silicone tubes of the cap (Figure 1B1/B5) and set the speed of the pump at a flow rate of ~0.5 ml of medium per 1 hr.\nOpen the in-house developed Drip-biolumicorder software that records the signals from the photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. Chose the directory where the data will be stored and start continuous bioluminescence recording from each dish by clicking the \"start\" icon.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively to the Drip-biolumicorder software, other programs (e.g. LumiCycle), can be used to record signals from PMT detector.\nPlace sterile 6-well tissue culture plates in the collection box on ice.\nOpen the control software that controls the timing of the automated switch among the collection wells. Set up the time window of medium collection (sec). Start collection of the outflow medium every 4 hr (14,400 sec; ~2 ml per time-point) by clicking the \"run\" icon.",
    "Transfer and measure the outflow medium from each collection well into sterile 2 ml tubes by pipetting. Keep tubes in a -20 °C freezer before starting the next step. Repeat steps 4.1.5-4.1.6 every 24 hr.\nStop the bioluminescence recording and the medium flow by clicking the \"stop\" icon on the corresponding software. Remove the metallic caps and aspirate the residual medium from the dishes.\nIn order to normalize the secreted protein values obtained in different experiments, either extract DNA (normalization by genomic DNA content for myotubes 19), or add 1 ml of lysis acid-ethanol buffer (normalization by total hormone content for islet cells 18) to the dishes.\n5. Measuring Islet Hormone and Myokine Levels in the Outflow Medium Obtained by Continuous Perifusion of Human Primary Endocrine Cells\nInsulin\n\t\nQuantify basal insulin levels in the outflow medium from collected time-points by using a human insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nNormalize data to the absolute volume of collected medium in each well and to the total insulin content, extracted from acid-ethanol treated cells at the end of the experiment (step 4.1.9) 18.\nInterleukin-6 (IL-6)\n\t\nQuantify  basal IL-6 levels in the outflow medium from collected time-points by using a human IL-6 ELISA kit following the manufacturer's instructions. \nNormalize data to the absolute volume of collected medium in each well and to genomic DNA content at the end of the experiment (step 4.1.9).\n6. Circadian Dataset Analyses for Bioluminescence and Hormone Secretion Profiles\nBioluminescence Analysis\n\t\nAnalyze bioluminescence profile using the provided software 19.\nJTK-cycle Analysis\n\t\nAnalyze hormone secretion profiles and bioluminescence recording results by using the JTK_CYCLE algorithm 32.\nSet the circadian period width at 20-24 hr.\n\t\tNOTE: In case the experimental conditions were recorded in parallel, a paired statistical analysis can be performed to compare the experiments.",
