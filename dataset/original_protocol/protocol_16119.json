    "This basic protocol describes growing of donor plants used to produce immature embryos used in the transformation system.\nNOTE: Sequentially sow small batches of wheat seeds at weekly intervals to ensure a continued supply of immature embryos. Donor plants are grown at 20  ±  1°C day and 15  ±  1°C night temperatures, 70% humidity, with light levels of 600 μmol m−2 s−1 provided by fluorescent tubes and tungsten lighting in controlled environment growth rooms.\nMaterials\nJohn Innes cereal mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-rec-0001])\nWheat seeds\nControlled environment growth room\n24CT seed tray inserts with 5-cm-square cells\nSeed tray\nSmall dibber (or pencil)\nMedium dibber (optional)\n13-cm-diameter pots\nWatering can fitted with a fine rose\n1. Place a 24CT insert inside a seed tray and fill with John Innes cereal mix.\n2. Using a small dibber (or pencil) make a hole ∼1.5-2 cm deep in the center of the cereal mix within each module\n3. Place a single wheat seed in each hole and cover with a little more cereal mix (if needed). Tap the tray to level the cereal mix.\n4. Using a watering can with a fine rose fitted, gently water the seeds.\n5. Place the tray in a controlled environment room set to the conditions listed above (note). Plants should be monitored daily. The compost should be kept moist but not waterlogged.\nSeedlings will be visible within a week of sowing. After ∼30 days, the seedlings will be large enough to transplant.\n6. Filling 13-cm-diameter pots with John Innes cereal mix.\n7. Make a small hole in the center of the compost using a medium-sized dibber or your finger. The hole should be about the size of the 5-cm modules in which your wheat seedlings germinated.",
    "8. Water the seedlings that are about to be transplanted. Loosen the seedling roots from the module's walls by gently squeezing and release the seedling.\n9. Keep the root ball intact as much as possible by supporting the seedling from underneath. Gently plant the seedling into the hole in the fresh compost. Firm the compost around the roots gently.\n10. Water using a watering can with a fine rose fitted to it.\n11. Grow the plants in a controlled environmental room under the conditions listed above until they produce donor embryos (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-prot-0003] and Time Considerations). Continue to monitor plants daily. The compost should be kept moist but do not overwater.",
    "We recommend using a reporter-gene construct in your initial experiments for optimization of the protocol to your local conditions. The pGoldenGreenGate (pGGG) we describe here contains the hygromycin resistance gene (hpt) and Cat1 intron under the control of a rice Actin1 promoter, and the β-glucuronidase gene (GUS) with two introns (GUS2Int) under the control of the rice ubiquitin promoter (Addgene cat. no. 165418), along with the helper plasmid pAL155 containing an additional VirG gene (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-fig-0001]).

    "1. Thaw 50 µl electrocompetent cells of hypervirulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 on ice. This should take ∼5 min.\n2. Add 1 µl (∼100 ng) binary vector DNA (and the same amount of helper plasmid, if using) to the competent cells, gently mix by flicking, and place back on ice.\n3. Transfer the cells and DNA mixture to a prechilled cuvette on ice. Gently tap to ensure the contents are at the bottom of the cuvette. Maintain on ice.\n4. Electroporate using a Bio-Rad GenePulser, with the settings 2.50 kV, 25 μFD, 400 Ω, and time constant between 8.0 and 9.5 ms.\n5. Immediately add 100 µl liquid LB medium to the cuvette to allow cells to recover. Transfer the cells to 500 µl LB medium in a sterile Falcon tube. Wrap the lid of the Falcon tube with Parafilm to secure.\n6. Incubate the cells at room temperature, lay the Falcon tube horizontally on a shaker, and gently shake at 100 rpm for 4-6 hr.\n7. Spread 20 and 40 µl of the electroporation culture, respectively, onto two plates solid LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.\nFor C58 strains of Agrobacterium (such as AGL1), add rifamycin at 50 µg/ml for selection, and when using pGGG, use kanamycin at 50 µg/ml.\n8.

Make 400-µl aliquots in 0.5-ml microcentrifuge and freeze at −80°C.\nThe standard inoculum aliquots are stored at −80°C until required. They can be stored almost indefinitely.\n11. The day before wheat transformation, use a single 400-µl standard Agrobacterium inoculum to inoculate 10 ml of MG/L (Garfinkel & Nester, 1980[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-bib-0007]) liquid medium without antibiotics and incubate at 28°C in a rotary shaker, shaken at 200 rpm overnight (∼16 hr).\n12. On the day of transformation, pellet the bacteria by centrifugation in a 50-ml Falcon tube at 3100 rpm for 10 min at 24°C. Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells gently in 10 ml wheat inoculation medium (WIM) to an optical density of 0.5 OD (600 nm). Then, add 100 mM acetosyringone (AS) to 100 µM final concentration.\n13. Incubate the culture for 4-6 hr at room temperature with gentle agitation (80 rpm) in the dark (wrap Falcon tube with aluminum foil) before proceeding to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-prot-0003].",

Cut off the awns from the ears ∼3-5 mm from the grain.\nThe seed coat can be removed, but this is not essential unless contamination problems are expected.\n3. Separate the immature grains from the ear and place in a 150-ml Sterilin jar.\n4. Sterilize the grains under aseptic conditions (e.g., laminar flow cabinet) using 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 min.

    "This protocol describes the resting period immediately after transformation, the selection process, plantlet regeneration and rooting, and finally acclimation from in vitro culture to soil. The resting period is a 5-day period following co-cultivation in which the Agrobacterium is removed by using timentin; however, the plant material is not subjected to selection pressure. This resting period allows the material to recover from the Agrobacterium infection and initiates callus induction. The selection process that follows puts the calli produced from the immature embryos under selection pressure using the antibiotic hygromycin. Cells that contain the T-DNA and are therefore resistant to hygromycin can proliferate on medium containing hygromycin. The selection pressure continues through the remaining in vitro steps; however, it is these first two phases that are referred to as Selection 1 and 2. During these two selection stages it is important that subcultures are done at the scheduled time, as delay may result in the growth of latent Agrobacterium, causing overgrowth and browning of callus, and/or the reduced stringency of selection may result in the growth of “escapes”, i.e., non-transformed plants.\nMaterials\nInoculated wheat embryos (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-prot-0003])\nWheat callus induction medium (WCI; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-rec-0018]), solid and liquid\nWheat regeneration medium (WRM; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-rec-0020]), solid\nExtract-N-Amp™ Plant Tissue PCR Kits (Sigma XNAP-1KT)\nREDExtract-N-Amp PCR Reaction Mix (Sigma XNAS)\nPrimer pair HygF 5′-AGGCTCTCGATGAGCTGATGCTTT-3′ and HygR 5′-AGCTGCATCATCGAAATTGCCGTC-3′\nGUS solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-rec-0003])\n90-mm-diameter petri plate (Thermo Scientific No 101R20)\nDeep petri dishes (tissue culture dish, 90 mm diameter × 20 mm, Falcon 353003)\nDe Wit culture tubes (Duchefa W 1607)\nDe Wit tray (Duchefa T1608)\nClear plastic propagator lid\nMicropore tape\nAdditional reagents and equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis (Voytas, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-bib-0017])\nResting period, callus induction, and selection of transformed material",

Selection 1: After the 5-day resting period, transfer the embryos, scutellum side up, to fresh WCI plates as described above with the addition of 15 mg/liter hygromycin (10 mg/liter for Cadenza; Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-fig-0004]), and incubate at 24 ± 1°C in the dark for 2 weeks (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-fig-0004]).\n4. Selection 2: After 2 weeks, split the calli at the into clumps of ∼4 mm2. Callus pieces derived from a single embryo should be labelled to keep track of their origin. Transfer the calli to fresh selection plates (WCI plates) as above, but with 30 mg/liter hygromycin (15 mg/liter for Cadenza), reducing the number of calli per plate by approximately half.

Also, the concentration of hygromycin is reduced to 15 mg/liter for Cadenza.\nIf shoots/calli need to grow for longer on WRM, culture should be subcultured onto fresh medium.\n7. Transfer regenerated shoots that are 1-2 cm in length with visible roots (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-fig-0005]) to De Wit culture tubes containing 8 ml WCI without growth regulators and supplemented with 15 mg/liter hygromycin.\nLabel all plantlets derived from single embryos to keep track of their origins.\nPutative transformed plants develop a strong root system with root hairs (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.58#cpz158-fig-0005]).\nAcclimatization\n8.
