Procced to the next step immediately.\nBrain slice preparation.\nEmbed the brain tissues in 4% agar in PBS in a standard 6-well culture plate.\nNote: The temperature of the agar solution should be between 40°C and 45°C.\nNote: The viscous property by agaropectin, a major component of agar, improves ease of cutting.\nAllow the agar to solidify on ice for 30 min.\nFill the vibratome bath with crashed ice.\nStick a piece of mending tape on the bottom of the specimen tray.\nAttach the tray to the bath.\nTrim the agar block with a razor blade to square off the sides.\nMount the agar block onto the tape with superglue.\nPour ice-cold 0.1 M PB to the specimen tray.\nSet the sectioning speed to 0.14 mm/s with 1.4 mm amplitude.",
    "Set the vibratome frequency to 75 Hz–77 Hz.\nCut 1-mm-thick brain slices.\nCollect the slices in ice-cold PBS.\nPause point: The slices can be stored in PBS for 16 h–20 h at 4°C.\nCritical: NaN3 as a preservative should be avoided. NaN3 inactivates the enzymatic activity of APEX2.\nAPEX2/BT-GO reaction\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, we explain the procedure for APEX2/BT-GO reaction, where biotin molecules are deposited with tyramide signal amplification (TSA) reaction using the peroxidase activity of APEX2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) (Furuta et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). This step is essential for LM/EM dual labeling resistance for ScaleSF tissue clearing. All incubations are performed in a standard 6-well culture plate at 20°C–25°C, except where noted.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1900-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of APEX2/BT-GO reaction\nAPEX2/BT-GO is a TSA system that utilizes peroxidase activity of APEX2 and H2O2 produced during oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase (GO reaction) to deposit biotinylated tyramine (BT) onto tissues. APEX2 reacts with the H2O2 and oxidizes the phenolic part of BT to produce highly reactive intermediates, which in turn covalently bind to electron-rich moieties such as tyrosine residues at or near the APEX2. POD: peroxidase.\nCritical: APEX2/BT-GO should be performed prior to tissue clearing with ScaleSF. Peroxidase activity of APEX2 markedly declines following ScaleSF treatment (Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1900-Mmc1.pdf]).\nCritical: Samples should be protected from light.\nPermeabilization.\nImmerse the slices in 10 mL of permeabilization buffer in a 13 mL centrifuge tube.\nRock gently for 4 h (50 rpm–100 rpm).\nCritical: Brain tissues should be shaken thoroughly.\nWash.\nTransfer the slices in 8 mL of 0.1 M PB.\nWash the slices with 8 mL of 0.1 M PB for 5 min three times with gentle rocking (50 rpm–100 rpm).\nBT penetration.\nTransfer the slices in 1200 μL of BT-GO reaction mixture in a 2 mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Rock gently for 4 h (50 rpm–100 rpm).\nCritical: Brain tissues should be shaken thoroughly.\nBT deposition.\nAdd 12 μL of ß-D-glucose solution to the BT-GO reaction mixture.\nRock gently for 2 h (50 rpm–100 rpm).\nCritical: Brain tissues should be shaken thoroughly.\nWash.\nTransfer the slices in 8 mL of PBS.\nWash the slices with 8 mL of PBS for 15 min twice with gentle rocking (50 rpm–100 rpm).\nFixation.\nImmerse the slices in 8 mL of 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB.\nRock gently for 16 h–20 h at 4°C (50 rpm–100 rpm).\nWash.\nTransfer the slices in 8 mL of PBS.\nWash the slices with 8 mL of PBS for 5 min twice with gentle shaking (50 rpm–100 rpm).\nPause point: The slices can be stored in 0.02% NaN3 in PBS at 4°C for 1 week.\nTissue clearing\nTiming: 10.5–14.5 h\nThis step describes the procedure for ScaleSF tissue clearing. The clearing schedule is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A. All reactions are performed in a standard 6-well culture plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1900-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bar, 2 mm.\nCritical: Samples should be protected from light.\nScaleSF tissue clearing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nWarm ScaleS0 and ScaleS4 solutions to 37°C.\nImmerse the brain slices in 8 mL of ScaleS0 solution, and rock gently for 2 h at 37°C (90 rpm).\nTransfer the slices in 8 mL of 1× PBS (–), and wash twice for 15 min with gentle rocking at 20°C–25°C (50 rpm–100 rpm).",
    "Transfer the slices in 8 mL of ScaleS4 solution, and rock gently for 8 h–12 h at 37°C (90 rpm).\nBrain slices mounting\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis step describes how to mount the cleared brain slices on the imaging chamber.\nBrain slice mounting.\nPlace the cleared brain slices on the bottom coverslip of the imaging chamber.\nRemove excessive ScaleS4 solution around the cleared slice.\nScaleS4 gel embedding.\nDrop ScaleS4 gel on the cleared slice to fill the imaging chamber.\nNote: The temperature of the ScaleS4 gel should be kept at 37°C.\nMount a coverslip on the imaging chamber, and place a piece of Kimwipe paper and a slide glass on the coverslip in this order.\nTransfer the imaging chamber in a refrigerator at 4°C.\nPlace metal weights on the slide glass, and allow the gel to solidify for 30 min.\nRemove the metal weights, slide glass, Kimwipe paper and coverslip from the imaging chamber, and wipe away excess ScaleS4 gel.\nTissue equilibration.\nAttach the imaging chamber to the bottom of a 60-mm glass petri dish with Blu-Tack®. Adhesion at multiple points is required.\nPour ScaleS4 solution to the dish, and incubate the embedded slice in the solution for 60 min at 20°C–25°C with gentle agitation (40 rpm–60 rpm).\nSubstitute with fresh ScaleS4 solution.\nCritical: Air bubbles on the sample surface should be removed.\nOptional: Using microscope stage adaptors, the imaging chambers can be mount on a microscope stage directly. In this case, the coverslip should remain attached on the imaging chamber.\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging in cleared tissues\nTiming: 2–24 h\nSet the correction collar of a 16× multi-immersion objective lens (numerical aperture (NA) = 0.60, working distance [WD] = 2.5 mm) to 1.47.",
    "Critical: Refractive index (RI) mismatch-induced aberrations can highly degrade the image formation. ScaleS4 solution has a RI of around 1.47 (Hama et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Miyawaki et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nMount the imaging chamber on a microscope stage.\nImmerse the objective lens in ScaleS4 solution, and make it approach to the cleared slice slowly.\nCritical: Air bubbles trapped on the tip of the objective lens should be removed.\nAdjust imaging acquisition settings such as laser power, scan speed, pinhole diameter, detector gain, amplifier offset/gain, xy and z-axis resolution and bit intensity resolution.\nCollect images by a CLSM, and record captured images.\nImage processing is done with Leica Application Suite X and ImageJ.\nRe-sectioning\nTiming: 2 days\nHere, we explain the procedure for re-sectioning from the slices imaged with CLSM.

Rapid freezing is of importance to reduce ice crystal formation and preserve cellular structure.\nImmerse the cryomold in the cooled isopentane to freeze.\nTransfer the cryomold in a freezer at −20°C.\nPause point: The blocks can be stored at −20°C for a week.\nCryosectioning.\nMount the block onto the stage of a freezing microtome with OCT compound.\nQuickly freeze the OCT compound using dry ice powder and leave the block in place for 5 min.\nCut the slice into 40-μm-thick sections and collect in ice-cold 0.1 M PB.\nPause point: The sections can be stored in 0.02% NaN3 in PBS at 4°C for 1 week.\nOptional: Imaged slices can be embedded in agar or gelatin solution, and re-sectioned with a vibratome.\nCLSM imaging in re-sections\nTiming: 1 day\nHere, we explain the procedure for CLSM imaging in re-sections with a high NA objective lens, which allows for high-resolution imaging of targeted structures.\nCritical: Be sure to keep re-sections wet during this step.\nSection mounting.\nPlace a re-section on a slide with a brush.\nApply 75% glycerol in PBS to the re-section.\nLower a coverslip onto 75% glycerol in PBS to avoid trapping any air bubbles.\nCLSM imaging.\nMount the slide on a microscope stage.\nAdjust imaging acquisition settings such as laser power, scan speed, pinhole diameter, detector gain, amplifier offset/gain, xy and z-axis resolution and bit intensity resolution.",
