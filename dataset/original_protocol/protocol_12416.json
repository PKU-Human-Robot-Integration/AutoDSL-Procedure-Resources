    "NOTE: All experimental protocols conformed to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tel Aviv University, Israel, and to the guidelines of the NIH. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.\n1. Animal Preparation\nHouse rats in a room with a 12 hr light/dark cycle.\nDuring the experimental procedures maintain rats on a 22 hr food restriction schedule with freely available water.\nWeigh the rats twice a week to ensure that their body weight is not reduced below 90% of the weight of free-feeding rats, based on growth curves (e.g., Harlan, http://www.harlan.com/models/spraguedawley.asp[href=http://www.harlan.com/models/spraguedawley.asp]). Exclude rats whose body weight is reduced.\n2. Set-up\nUse two adjacent rooms. One to be used as a “waiting room” for holding rats prior to behavioral testing, and the other for carrying out the procedure. This room will house the operant chambers.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that rats in the waiting room are not exposed to the tones generated by the operant chambers.\nUse operant chambers with grid floor and a food magazine, which delivers one 45 mg food pellet accessible through a hinged Perspex panel.\n\tNOTE: Opening of the hinge activates a micro-switch; a 3 W light to illuminate the food magazine; two retractable levers (4 cm wide, positioned 2.8 cm from the side walls, 7.5 cm on each side of the food magazine and 5 cm from the floor); a house light located on the ceiling to illuminate the chambers; an audio signal device to produce a 80 dB, 2.8 kHz tone.\nSeat the operant chambers in sound-attenuated boxes with ventilating fans mounted on the side of each box.",
    "Prior to the beginning of the experiment, pre-program all training stages with the exact session parameters relevant for each stage using a designated software, which computer-controls and activates the operant chambers as well as automatically records all the relevant data accumulated during the running of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: The parameters for each training stage (magazine training, lever-press training, signal attenuation, test) are fully detailed below. The exact fashion in which these parameters are pre-programmed is dependent upon the software and hardware in use.\n3. Handling and Food Restriction\nHandle rats for about 2 min daily, 5 days prior to the beginning of the experimental procedure.\nLaunch a 22 hr food restriction schedule beginning on the first day of handling. Allow rats access to food for 2 hr in their home cages no sooner than half an hour after the end of handling/behavioral training.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that rats have water ad libitum when in their home cages, and especially during the 2 hr feeding period, as they will not eat properly without water.\nOn the last 3 days of handling, place 20 - 30 food pellets on a small tray and place the tray in the rats home cage. Remove the tray from the cage only after each rat has been observed to consume at least two pellets.\n\tNOTE: Later, use the pellets as reinforcement for operant training.\n4. Training Procedure\nIn order for the rats to get acclimated to the testing environment, transport the rats in their home cages at least 15 min prior to behavioral testing in the waiting room.\nMagazine training (days 1 - 3).\nOn the 1st day of magazine training, put a sufficient amount of food pellets in the food magazine so that they are visible to the rat.",
    "NOTE: One way to do so is to place the pellets so that they cause the hinged Perspex panel to remain slightly open.\nCompute the magazine training program so that the house light is turned on automatically at the start of each trial and a single food pellet is dropped into the food magazine following a 5 sec variable delay, simultaneously with the onset of a compound stimulus consisting of the magazine light and a tone.\nCompute the compound stimulus and house light to turn off after the rat's head enters the food magazine (collected trial) or after 15 sec (uncollected trial), whichever comes first. Define each trial to be followed by a 30 sec inter-trial interval.\nPlace the rats into the operant chambers and 5 min later verify manually that all of the rats have collected the pellets. If so, activate the training program. If not, allow an extra 5 min.\nProgram the magazine training session to stop running either after the rat has completed 30 collected trials or after a total of 40 trials has been attained.\nOn the 3rd day of magazine training ensure that the rats perform 30 collected trials out of a total of 32 trials at the most. Return rats that fail to attain this criterion to the operant chambers for another full training session at the end of the training day.\n\t\tNOTE: Run rats that fail to reach this criterion following an extra session on the last day of magazine training on the morning of the first day of lever-press training. Exclude rats that fail to reach criterion.\nLever-press training - Pre-training stage (day 4): Lever-pressing on a free-operant schedule.",
    "Activate the training program before placing the rats in the operant chambers. Compute the program so that the reinforced lever is present in the chamber and the house light is on during the whole training session and that the non-reinforced lever is always retracted.\n\t\tNOTE: Counterbalance the side of the lever (left/right) across rats and keep constant for each rat throughout the experimental procedure.\nPut some pellets on the lever and place a rat into the chamber.\nAllow the rat to explore the lever area until it incidentally presses the lever while collecting the pellets, triggering the delivery of a single food pellet and the onset of the compound stimulus.\nCompute the program so that the compound stimulus is turned off after the rat's head enters the food magazine (completed trial) or after 15 sec (uncompleted trial), whichever comes first.\nProgram the session to stop running after the rat has reached 30 completed trials.\nIf a rat does not reach this criterion within 30 min, put 3 - 4 pellets on the lever and wait for another 20 min. If a rat fails to complete 30 trials, return it to the operant chamber for additional training at the end of the training day.\n\t\tNOTE: Run rats that fail to reach this criterion following the extra pre-training session again on the morning of the first day of lever-press training. Exclude rats that fail to reach criterion. Generally, almost all rats acquire lever-pressing after 3 sessions of pre-training (most do within the first session). However, if the animals have more difficulties in acquiring lever-pressing, use shaping.",
    "During shaping, keep the door of the sound-attenuated box open and observe the rat in the operant chamber. When the rat approaches the lever use the software to activate the delivery of a food pellet and the onset of the compound stimulus. Do so repeatedly.\nIn the beginning, reinforce the rat when it is in the vicinity of the lever, but gradually start reinforcing it only when it makes actual physical contact with the lever, and finally reinforce only attempts to press it.\n\t\tNOTE: Shaping may take a while. Be as quiet as possible.\nLever press training (days 5 - 7): Lever-pressing on a discrete trial schedule.\nCompute the program so that the start of each trial is signaled by the onset of the house light and 5 sec later, both levers are introduced into the chamber.\nEnsure that responses on the non-reinforced lever (NRL) have no programmed consequences and presses on the reinforced lever trigger the delivery of a single food pellet into the magazine, together with the presentation of the compound stimulus.\nAfter the rat’s head enters the food magazine or after 15 sec have elapsed the levers are retracted and the compound stimulus and house light are turned off.\nDefine each trial so that it is followed by a 30 sec inter-trial interval. On the first day of lever-press training (day 5) define the compound stimulus to be turned off after 15 sec in order to facilitate acquisition of the lever-press response. On the following two days (days 6 - 7) define the compound stimulus to last only 10 sec in order to ensure that magazine entry closely follows the lever-press responses.\nPlace the rats in the operant chambers, and then activate the training program.",
    "Program the lever-press training session to stop running either after a rat has pressed the reinforced lever (RL) and collected the food pellet (completed trial) 40 times or after a total of 60 trials has been attained.\nOn the last day of lever-press training make sure rats complete 40 trials out of a total of 42 total trials at the most. If a rat fails to reach this criterion, return it to the operant chamber for an additional training session at the end of the day.\n\t\tNOTE: Exclude rats that fail to reach this criterion following an extra session on the last day of lever-press training.\nOn the last day of lever-press training record the number of unrewarded lever presses on each trial, i.e., the number of presses following the first response on the RL (extra lever-presses).\nRandomly allocate rats to the experimental groups.\nWhen conducting the experimental manipulation at the time of the Test stage (e.g., in studies testing the acute effect of a drug), use analysis of variance (ANOVA) with main factors of manipulation (with manipulation/without manipulation) and Procedure (post-training signal attenuation, PTSA/regular extinction, RE, see section 4.5) to analyze the number of excessive lever presses followed by pellet collection (named excessive lever-presses-completed, ELP-C) and unpressed trials on the last day of lever-press training before the beginning of the signal attenuation stage.\nEnsure that there are no statistically significant differences between the groups in this measure.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, there are only a few rats with a high number of extra lever-presses, so compare the groups without these rats. In addition, make sure that rats that underwent extra-training are distributed between the groups as evenly as possible.\nSignal attenuation/Regular extinction (days 8 - 10).",
    "Run the procedure in an identical manner to magazine training on days 1 - 3 with two exceptions:\n\t\t\nEmpty the pellet dispenser so that no food pellet is delivered to the food magazine following the onset of the compound stimulus.\nProgram the relevant stage so that the compound stimulus is turned off after 10 sec and not after 15 sec.\nMake sure both the RL and NRL remain retracted during the training session.\nEnsure each signal attenuation training session to consist of 30 trials. On the last day of training make sure rats attempt to collect a food pellet (i.e., insert their head into the food magazine following the onset of the compound stimulus) no more than 14 times.\nReturn rats that failed to attain this criterion to the operant chambers for an additional training session at the end of the day.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exclude rats that fail to reach criterion at this stage.\nBring the rats undergoing regular extinction to the “waiting room” and leave them in their home cages for a period equivalent to the average duration of the signal attenuation stage.\nUse a mixed ANOVA with main factors of manipulation (with manipulation/without manipulation) and Procedure (PTSA/RE) and a repeated measures factor of Session (sessions 1 - 3) to analyze the number of completed trials on the three sessions of the signal attenuation stage.\nEnsure that differences in performance at the test stage are not a result of an earlier difference.\nTest (day 11): Run the procedure in an identical manner to lever-press training, but under extinction conditions, i.e., pressing the RL results in the presentation of the compound stimulus, but no food is delivered to the food magazine because the pellet dispenser is empty.",
    "Compute the test session to consist of 50 trials for males and 60 trials for females, because usually females still respond after 50 trials. However, if both sexes are used in the same study (recommended), then give 60 trials to all subjects.\nCollect the the number of excessive lever-presses that were not followed by magazine entry (named excessive lever-presses-uncompleted, ELP-U); the number of excessive lever-presses that were followed by magazine entry (i.e., ELP-C); the number of lever presses on the NRL; and the number of nose-pokes (i.e., the number of times the rat inserted its head into the food magazine.\nAnalyze rats’ performance on the Test stage using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with main factors of manipulation (with manipulation/without manipulation) and Procedure (PTSA/RE) performed on the number of ELP-C, ELP-U, the number of completed, uncompleted and unpressed trials, and the number of nose-pokes and presses on the non-reinforced lever.\nFollow significant interactions with post hoc analysis comparing the treated group with the non-treated/control group, within each procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: When the exact parameters of the manipulation are not known (e.g., the relevant drug dose, the parameters of electrical stimulation) and in order to reduce the number of animals, test the effects of the manipulation in the PTSA procedure only, using different parameters (e.g., using several drug doses).\nFind the optimal parameters, that is, the parameters that exert the greatest effect on the number of ELP-U, without abolishing behavioral responding, and then run a full experimental design (PTSA and RE)."
