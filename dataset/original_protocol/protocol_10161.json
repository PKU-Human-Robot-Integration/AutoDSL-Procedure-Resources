    "1. Preparation of sucrose solutions\nNOTE: The sucrose solutions are used as cheap, Newtonian model media with elevated viscosity and density for reduced turbulence conditions (see Table 1).\nFill a Duran glass bottle with water and sucrose of different concentrations (20 - 60 %w/w).\nMix the content with a magnetic stirrer until the sucrose has completely dissolved.\n\t\nFor sucrose concentrations in excess of 40 %w/w, add the sucrose intermittently and heat the glass bottle slightly (~ 50 °C). Let the sucrose solution cool down to room temperature before use.\n2. Preparation of a measurement recipe and the data logging\nAfter starting the software, initiate the communication with the control unit by selecting the correct serial COM port from the dropdown menu and clicking the Connect button.\n\tNote: The Connect button will change the colour to green and the LED below the dropdown menu will switch on, once the communication with the control unit is initiated.\nSet up the data file path inside the bioreactor control unit software in order to store the data on the operator PC.\n\t\nOpen the Settings tab page and hit the folder symbol next to the Data file location text field.\nIn the file dialog window, browse to the desire folder, type a file name into the File name text field and click the OK button.\n\t\tNote: The data log file path and name are displayed in the text box and the DAQ start button is enabled, once a valid file path is defined.\nSet up a routine inside the recipe manager of the bioreactor control unit software in order to automate the measurement procedure.",
    "Open the Recipe tab page and type the desired input values for the recipe phase elapsed time (min) and the corresponding impeller speed (rpm) into the text field boxes. The profile is automatically displayed in the chart.\n\t\tNote: For example, the agitator speed is increased stepwise by 20 rpm from 100 rpm to 300 rpm, and each value is maintained for 4 minutes in order to guarantee a stable torque signal (see discussion below). The minimum and maximum speeds as well as the amount of the increase can be adjusted for different agitators and vessels.\n\t\tNote: Select the speed range carefully with respect to the torque sensor resolution, the nominal torque and vortex formation. The latter often occurs in unbaffled bioreactors agitated at higher speeds and can cause damage to the torque meter.\nClick the Save button, browse to the desired file path and type a file name in the text field. Hit the OK button to save the file.\n3. Installation of the torque sensor\nNOTE: The experimental setup is shown schematically in Figure 1.\nInstall the torque transducer in a specially designed holder that incorporates the air bearing (see Figure 1) using screws to fix the sensor into place. The air bearing used in this study has a porous carbon bushing material with an inner diameter of 13 mm.\n\t\nMount the brushless servo agitator motor onto the top of the holder. Fix the torque transducer to the vertical holder mounting using four screws.\nConnect the motor shaft to the drive shaft of the torque transducer using a metal bellow coupling that can compensate small axial misalignments of the shafts and tighten the coupling using screws. Connect the agitator shaft to the measurement shaft of the torque transducer using another metal bellow coupling.",
    "NOTE: In this study, specifically designed impeller shafts with a diameter of 13 mm (tolerance: - 0.0076 mm) and with lengths of between 270 mm and 520 mm were used for the different vessels investigated.\nMount the sensor holder onto the bioreactor head plate and install the impellers on the agitator shaft with the desired off-bottom clearance. Mount baffles and additional installations (e.g. sampling and harvest tubes, electrochemical sensors, etc.) inside the bioreactor if required.\nInstall the desired bioreactor in the vessel holder if required (bioreactors #1, #3 to #10) or place the head plate onto the bioreactor tank (bioreactor #2) and tighten the head plate with screws.\n\t\nFor investigations of glass bioreactors, place the bioreactor glass vessel into the holder.\nFor investigations of single-use bioreactors, disassemble the top mounted tubing ports and impeller shaft housing from the plastic head plates by using appropriate cutting tools. Place the plastic vessel into the holder.\nPlace a temperature sensor inside the bioreactor and connect it to the control unit. Connect the tubing for the pressurized air to the gas inlet port of the air bearing and apply a pressure of around 5.5 bar provided by a compressor. Connect the torque transducer to the A/D converter and power on the transmitter.\n4. Configurations in the data acquisition software\nOpen the software for the data acquisition of torque sensor signal and configure the measurement preferences.\n\t\nMake sure that the first two channels in the DAQ channels window are initialized and active. In this study, the torque signal was set on channel 0 and the rotational speed signal was set on channel 1.\n\t\t\nClick the Live update button to display the current measurement values.",
    "Set the torque channel signal to zero if the absolute torque signal without rotation is larger than 0.1 mN·m by using the right-mouse click on the channel item in the channel list and selecting the Zero balance option.\nNavigate to the DAQ job tab page and define a data acquisition rate of 2 Hz from the dropdown menu list. Use the options Immediately at job start and Duration from the dropdown lists to set the Start and Stop of the data acquisition, respectively.\nDefine a time span for the Sample duration that is longer than the time required to finish the measurement (for example, use 1 h 0 m 30 s for a one hour recipe defined in the second step).\nNavigate to the Data storage settings page and select the option ASCII + channel info from the dropdown list to set the File format for the data save file. Set a file path on the PC hard drive for the measurement Output file.\n5. Perform the torque measurement\nStart the data acquisition for the torque signal in the control and data acquisition software for the torque meter by clicking the Start button on the DAQ job menu page.\nStart the data acquisition for the agitator speed and the temperature in the bioreactor control unit software by clicking the DAQ start button on the Settings tab page.\nStart the agitator control in the control unit software with a manual set-point or the pre-defined recipe scheme.\n\t\nIf a single measurement is conducted, use the control box entry on the Main tab page of the bioreactor control software. Type the desired set-point into the text box and click on the ‘Agitator control on’ item.",
    "If multiple measurements with a recipe are conducted, navigate to the Phases tab page and click the Start button.\n\t\tNote: The software will automatically disable all manual entry boxes for the duration of the recipe and a window opens automatically to confirm the end of the process.\nIn the data acquisition software, a window opens automatically after the pre-defined measurement duration. Save the data for each measurement on the operator PC, preferably on the hard drive, by clicking the Save data now button.\nRepeat the measurement for each desired agitator speed without and with liquid inside the bioreactor vessel.\n\t\nPour water (or the sucrose solution) through a funnel into the bioreactor.\n\t\tNote: Make sure that the liquid completely covers the impellers since (partially) exposed impellers can result in undesired axial forces that could damage the torque sensor.\n6. Data evaluation\nNOTE: The obtained torque values in the empty vessel (dead torque) correspond to the residual friction losses of the bearing and must be subtracted from the values determined in the liquid in order to obtain the effective torque values (see Eq. 1).\nAverage the torque values for each agitator speed measured after a quasi-stable signal has been achieved (see discussion below). Ideally, calculate the mean value over a period of at least 2 min for each condition, corresponding to 240 data points at a measurement rate of 2 Hz.\nUse a Matlab code for the data processing by running the code from the software command line.",
    "NOTE: The code is provided for download in the supplement section of this manuscript. This script imports the raw data file from the data recording, calculates the phase average rotational speed, Reynolds number (from Eq. 3 based on user inputs) and torque values for each of the phases, visualizes the outcomes, and stores the results in a second text file, which then can be used to further process the data.\nSubtract the torque values obtained in the empty vessel from those measured in the liquid to obtain the effective torque values.\nCalculate the power input and dimensionless power number from the time-averaged torque values according to Eq. 1 and Eq. 2."
