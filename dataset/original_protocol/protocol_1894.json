    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes in detail the purification of HLA-A2 α chain and β2m.\nProtein purification\nTiming: 1 days\nIn this part of the protocol, bacterial cells are lysed, and the pellet is disrupted by sonication using ultrasonic fluid. Then, inclusion bodies are dissolved in denaturing loading buffer overnight at 4°C, which is subjected to a Ni2+-affinity chromatography taking advantage of the His-tag presence in the recombinant protein. Subsequently, the HLA-A2 α chain and β2m are refolded in the Refolding Buffer followed by dialysis. Finally, the product is concentrated by ultrafiltration and then purified by the size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column.\nCell Lysis\nUnfreeze the bacteria pellet at 20°C–24°C until it starts to melt followed by weighing the cell pellet. Transfer immediately to ice.\nCritical: Maintain the sample and buffer on ice.\nAccording to the cell pellet’ weight, resuspend and spin the pellet in 10 mL/g of Ordinary Wash Buffer (pH8, as described in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) and sonicate by soaking the probe of sonicator into the sample, setting the power at 400 watts. Perform 100 cycles of 10 min, alternating the tubes and keeping the samples on ice between each sonication cycle.\nCentrifuge the solution at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat step b to c twice.\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat step b to c five times after replacing the Ordinary Wash buffer in step b with a 2 M Urea Wash Buffer (pH8, as described in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat step b to c twice after replacing the Ordinary Wash buffer in step b with a 25 mM Tris-HCl.\nAdd denaturation solution, and place a magnetic stir bar into it and stir overnight at 2°C–8°C.",
    "Centrifuge the solution at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.22 μm-pore membrane with a syringe.\nCritical: Every sonicator is different and may require optimization.\nMetal-affinity chromatography\nCritical: All buffers must be filtered through a 0.22 μm-pore membrane.\nLoad the sample into the pre-equilibrated Nickel Column at a 1 mL/min rate.\nWash the column with 15×bed column of Nickel Column Clean Buffer as fraction.\nElute the protein of interest with 6×bed volume of Nickel Column Elute Buffer as fraction.\nCollect 6 number of aliquots of 10 mL (as show in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B: mark fraction 0–5).\nTake a sample of 60 μL to test for the presence of the protein of interested.\nAnalyze aliquots of the fractions and the LMW protein ladder (10 μL) by 15% SDS-PAGE. Stain the gel with Coomassie blue, using the protocol provided by the manufacturer, and verify the presence of a differential band of the expected size in the induced insert-containing clone (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nPool the fraction 1 and 2 (from step 2d) and determine the absorbance at 280 nm in a nanodrop using an aliquot of the protein containing fractions to determine the concentration of the protein of interest. Use the Nickel Column Elute Buffer as a blank.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1487-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Purification of HLA-A2 α chain and β2m\n(A and B) Aliquots, HLA-A2 α chain (A) / β2m (B), from metal-affinity chromatography eluted fraction (0–5) were solved analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. Fractions 1 and 2 were pooled for subsequent protein refolding. M, molecular weight marker. BC: before column chromatography. W, wash. F, flow-through.\nProtein preparation\nTiming: N/a",
    "This part of the protocol serves to assess the purity of the recombinant protein and its activity. Also, proper storage conditions to preserve HLA-A2 α chain and β2m integrity and function are described here.\nProtein storage\nAdd 0.2% phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to inhibit protein degradation and store the protein for up to 2 months at –80°C.\nCritical: Distribute the protein into several tubes and freeze-thaw only once. Once thawed, protein can be preserved at 4°C and used up within a week.\nProtein analysis\nAnalyze the purity of HLA-A2 α chain and β2m by a 15% SDS-PAGE. Continue to generate the HLA-A2 α chain and β2m and peptide monomer and check integrity of the refolded protein by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).\nProduction of the monomer\nTiming: 4 days\nA monomer is a combination of the HLA-A2 α chain and β2m with a peptide that can be either photosensitive or not. The photosensitive peptide is used for the exchange assay.\nRefolding of HLA-A2 α chain and β2m plus peptide, followed by purification. The peptides are antigen-specific peptide that were collected from Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB: http://www.iedb.org[href=http://www.iedb.orgl/]).\nMix HLA-A2 α chain, β2m and peptide in a 1:2:10 molar ratio and dilute into 40 mL refolding solution. Place a magnetic stir bar into the solution and stir gently at 2°C–8°C for 12 h.\nDialyze the folding mixture against 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0) for 72 h at 4°C. Replace the dialysate 4–5 times during this period.\nProtein ultrafiltration\nRinse the ultrafiltration tube (Amicon® Ultra) with filtered water.\nAdd 10 mL filtered water, and centrifuge the ultrafiltration at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the lower layer of liquid and residual liquid on the upper layer.",
    "Add 10 mL of sample (if there are more samples, add in multiple times and centrifuge under the same conditions) and centrifuge at 3,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nProperly extend the centrifugation time until the upper liquid volume of the ultrafiltration tube is about 1 mL.\nCollect the sample and place it in a new EP tube.\nTemporarily store the sample at 4°C and wait for purification by the Sephacryl S-200 column.\nPurify with the Sephacryl S-200 column\nTurn on chromatography instrument (MC99-2, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) 1 h earlier.\nCarefully immerse the inlet tube of the Sephacryl S-200 column in the sample.\nStart the pump at the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.\nWhen the sample is almost exhausted, quickly turn off the pump to avoid air bubbles generate.\nGently put the inlet tubing into the cold filtered and degassed 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0).\nStart the pump at the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.\nChange the flow rate to 1 mL/min after 10 min.\nThe first peak will appear in the displayer after 50 min or so and the second peak is our target protein. You would receive four peaks (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1487-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The refolded protein purified by gel filtration chromatography\n(A) Four aliquots collected from the Chromatography instrument. The number 1–4 represents the first to fourth peak collected.\n(B) The four aliquots were solved by 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue.\nCollect all peak and take a sample of 60 μL to test for the presence of the protein of interested (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nBiotinylation of monomer and refolding verification",
    "Timing: 1 h Streptavidin has a strong affinity for biotin. The HLA-A2 α chain contains an AviTag, which can be attached to biotin. The biotinylated monomer can connect with PE-conjugated streptavidin to stain antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.\nThe monomer is biotinylated by using the protocol provided by the manufacturer (https://www.genecopoeia.com/product/avitag-cdnaclone-reagent/[href=https://www.genecopoeia.com/product/avitag-cdnaclone-reagent/]). Biotin-Protein Ligase kit (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Fresh biotinylation solution is prepared as described in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]. Allow the biotinylation reaction to proceed at 30°C for 30–40 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1487_3.csv\nCritical: The biotinylation solution must be prepared freshly.\nPause point: Use immediately, or store the biotinylated monomer solution for up to one week at 4°C. For longer storage, add BSA (0.5% final concentration) and PMSF (0.2 mM final concentration) and divide into several aliquots in 0.2 mL tubes. The biotinylated monomer (MW 50.9 kDa) with a concentration of approximately 1 mg/mL can be stored for up to 1 year at –80°C.\nCritical: The monomer combined with a photosensitive peptide (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) is required to be protected from light. Photosensitive peptides are sensitive to light. Please avoid light, otherwise it will affect the subsequent peptide exchange effect.\nMonomer reconstruction confirmation by ELISA\nOnly when the HLA-A2 α chain, β2m and peptide are combined together, the monomer can be stabilized. The HRP-conjugated antibody is aimed at β2m, and the biotinylated HLA-A2 α chain is bound to the plate coated with streptavidin, so the ELISA signal can only be detected if it is correctly folded into a monomer.\nUse ELISA to verify whether the monomer has been biotinylated. Prepare the relevant reagents required for ELISA in advance.\nCoat a wells plate with 100 μL streptavidin solution (2 μg/mL). Seal the plate and incubate overnight (16 h–18 h) at room temperature (18°C–25°C).",
    "Discard the coating solution and wash the plate 3 times with at least 300 μL Wash Buffer per well and remove residual buffer by firmly tapping plate upside down on absorbent paper.\nTo block non-specific binding and reduce background, add 300 μL of 1× Dilution Buffer to all wells.\nSeal the plate and incubate it for 30 min at room temperature (18°C–25°C).\nDilute the sample 1,200-fold in 1×Dilution Buffer. Mix thoroughly.\nDiscard the Dilution Buffer from the plate and blot the residual buffer.\nPipette 100 μL of 1×Dilution buffer (blank) or 100 μL sample into the appropriate wells.\nSeal the plates and incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nDiscard the liquid from the wells and wash 3 times with 300 μL of wash buffer per well.\nDilute concentration HRP-conjugated antibody to 0.3 μg/mL in 1× Dilution Buffer and add 100 μL of diluted HRP-conjugated β2m antibody per well.\nSeal the plates and incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nDiscard the liquid from the wells and wash 3 times with 300 μL of wash buffer per well.\nAdd 100 μL of substrate solution.\nIncubate for 8 min at room temperature (18°C–25°C) in the dark whilst shaking at 450 rpm.\nAdd 50 μL of stop solution to each well and read the results at 405 nm on an ELISA reader within 30 min (Sample results are demonstrated in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B)\nCritical: Keep an eye on the color development to make sure the reaction is stopped before saturation.",
    "Use the ELISA method to verify whether the photosensitive monomer has been biotinylated (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B) and its exchange efficiency (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). Here, we regard the GILGFVFTL peptide as control and define its exchange efficiency with photosensitive peptide as 100%. The exchange efficiency is the percentage of their ratio of OD values corresponding to the antigen-peptide and the GILGFVFTL-peptide(Rodenko B. et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1487-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
