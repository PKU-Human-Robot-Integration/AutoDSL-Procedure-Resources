    "1. Storage\nStore the reservoirs, holders, O-rings and microfluidic devices in 70% ethanol. Use a container (e.g. jar or beaker) that has a lid to prevent evaporation and contamination by dust or outside particles. Place the devices in one container (1), reservoirs and O-rings in a second container (2), and holders in the third (3).\nNote: The use of 70% ethanol for storage is to maintain sterility. If the only components of the solution are ethanol and water (i.e. no denaturing agents), all system components should be fully compatible and will not degrade over time.\nChange ethanol solution in containers (2) and (3) before each use to prevent cross-contamination across experiments and minimize the presence of unwanted particles that can cause clogging.\n2. Experiment Preparation\nPlace containers (2) and (3) in an ultrasound bath for 5-10 min before each use. This helps remove any contaminating particles from previous experiments.\nClean workspace in biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol solution.\nSpray all materials (3 containers, and tweezers) with a 70% ethanol solution before placing them inside the biosafety cabinet.\n3. Assembly\nSet down 2-3 low-lint wipes in the work area.\nRemove plastic reservoirs from their container with tweezers and set them on the wipes to facilitate evaporation of ethanol solution from inner surfaces. Gently tap the reservoirs on the surface or blow air through them to facilitate removal of the ethanol solution.\nInsert O-rings into their appropriate slot on the reservoirs.\nRemove the holder and chips from respective containers and allow ethanol to evaporate (~1-2 min).",
    "Use tweezers to place the desired chip face-up (i.e. access holes up) in the holder. Raise the holder with the chip to eyelevel to make sure the chip is lying flat in the holder and adjust if necessary with the tweezers. IMPORTANT: If the device does not fit properly in its holder, there is a risk that it will break during the subsequent steps.\nNext, gently place the reservoirs on the holder and align them with the clips. Be careful that O-rings do not fall out of their slots during this process.\nGently press down on the reservoirs until they click into place. Ensure that both sides of the reservoirs are secure and that the chip appears to be in the correct position.\n4. Cell Preparation\nFor adherent cells (primary or established lines): Plate cells 1-2 days prior to the experiment such that they are no more than 80% confluent on the day of the experiment.\nPlace cells in suspension (in PBS or relevant media) and aim for an operating concentration of 1.0 x 106 cells/ml to 1.0 x 107 cells/ml. NOTE: We have not observed significant changes in delivery performance due to cell concentration.\nMix cells and the desired delivery material in a separate tube to obtain the desired material concentration for the experiment. IMPORTANT: Because the described delivery method relies on diffusion to facilitate delivery, a higher material concentration will yield higher delivery. If possible, it is recommended to use a 1 µM solution of the desired material for initial trials. This concentration can then be titrated down in future experiments as needed. The lowest reported concentration used with this device is 10 nM21.\n5. Operation",
    "Pipette mixture of cells and delivery material into a reservoir (current design has a max 150 µl capacity). NOTE: Most device designs are fully reversible therefore direction of flow through the channels does not matter. Samples may be loaded into either of the two reservoirs.\nAttach pressure tubing to the filled reservoir and tighten the nut to ensure proper sealing (finger tight is often sufficient).\nAdjust pressure to the desired level on the regulator. This controls the speed at which cells travel through the device. Note that cell flow does not start until button is pressed.\nNOTE: In previous work, nitrogen or compressed air have worked equally well as the carrier gas.\nRaise device to eye level and orient it so that the liquid in the reservoir is easily visible. NOTE: Track the liquid column to shut off the system before the reservoir is emptied.\nPress the button to pressurize the reservoir and begin cell flow.\nWhen the liquid level is approximately 2 mm from the bottom of the reservoir, quickly turn the regulator to 0 psi to stop flow. IMPORTANT: If one fails to stop the flow before the reservoir is emptied, one risks ejecting the sample from the collection reservoir. Also note that if the fluid column is not moving at an appreciable pace, or has slowed substantially relative to its initial flow rate (e.g. 3x slower), the mounted device is probably clogged and needs to be exchanged. Operating a clogged device can lead to higher cell death.",
    "Collect the treated cells from the appropriate reservoir and place them in the desired collection tube/plate. IMPORTANT: Do not dilute the collected cells in any buffers at this stage as the porated cells will continue to uptake material for up to 10 min20. After this window has passed, dilute the cells in the desired media/buffer.\nTo collect more treated cells or try alternative experimental conditions, repeat steps 5.1 - 5.7 as needed. Recall that the chips are reversible, therefore samples can be mounted in either reservoir. Be sure to exchange chips as needed if they clog. Discard clogged devices.\n6. Disassembly\nGently disconnect the reservoirs from the main holder by pushing aside the clip arms.\nPlace each part in the appropriate storage container (detailed in section 1).\nPlace used chips in a separate container for disposal.\nSubscription Required.
