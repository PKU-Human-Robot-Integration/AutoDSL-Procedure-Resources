    "This protocol complies with the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi 'an Jiaotong University (No. 2019ZD04).\n1. Preoperative preparation, patient position, and anesthesia\nEnsure appropriate dietary management before operation.\n\t\nPrescribe a preoperative oral carbohydrate drink to be consumed at bedtime and 4 h prior to surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: This was allowed based on the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol.\nDo not prescribe any additional oral antibiotics.\n\t\tNOTE: The implementation of these measures should be carefully considered according to the experience of each center.\nAdminister preoperative antibiotics and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\n\t\nInject preventive antibiotics (2 g of cefmetazole, 4.5 g of piperacillin/tazobactam, or 300 mg of clindamycin based on the drug allergy test) within 1 h prior to the incision.\nAdminister deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in the form of a subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin injection (Nadroparin calcium, 2850 IU) 2-4 h before anesthesia.\nInduce general anesthesia.\n\t​NOTE: This should be performed based on the experience of each center.\n\t\nAdminister multimodal analgesia to minimize narcotic administration, including regional nerve blockade and nonsteroidal analgesia.\nPerform appropriate restrictive intraoperative fluid management according to base requirements, blood loss and hemodynamic monitoring results.\nIn addition, during the operation, dynamically monitor the patient's electrocardiogram, radial arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, capnography, urinary volumes, temperature, and blood gas analysis 7.\nPlace a 16-18 Fr sterile urethral catheter.\nPlace the patient in a Lloyd Davis position and secure them carefully to the operating table. Ensure that the legs are carefully padded in stirrups and that both arms are tucked at the side.\n2. Operation settings and port placement\nNOTE: These measures can be appropriately adapted according to the experience of each surgeon.\nEnsure that the primary surgeon operates from the robotic console and customizes their settings (Figure 1).",
    "Have an assistant laparoscopic surgeon stand on the right side of the patient (Figure 1).\nHave a nurse stand on the left side of the patient (Figure 1).\nBefore the operation, confirm the white balance, adjust the focus and 3D calibration of the da Vinci Si robot lens following the operation system guidance, and heat the lens in warm water (not more than 55 °C) to prevent fog.\nEstablish the pneumoperitoneum and port placement.\n\t\nMake a 12-mm incision 2-3 cm above the umbilicus and slightly to the left.\nElevate the umbilicus and abdominal wall with a towel clamp and pierce into the abdominal cavity using a Veress needle.\nAttach a disposable syringe filled with 5 mL of normal saline to the Veress needle with the flow tap open. Aspirate the syringe and ensure that no blood or fecal matter was aspirated. Inject 5 mL of saline.\nRemove the syringe from the Veress needle with the flow tap left open. Observe the movement of the fluid column at the top of the Veress needle to confirm that the Veress needle pierced the appropriate location.\n\t\tNOTE: Free movement without any resistance of the fluid from the needle into the abdomen indicates a positive result for the saline drop test and the Veress needle has pierced the abdominal cavity.\nConnect the insufflation tube to the Veress needle. Then, start the CO2 insufflation apparatus at a pressure setting of 12 mmHg.\n\t\tNOTE: The pressure should be set between 8 and 15 mmHg. Confirm that the Veress needle is in the appropriate location by noting the pressure. If the pressure increases over the set pressure rapidly, this usually indicates that the Veress needle has not pierced the abdominal cavity.",
    "After the measured pressure reaches the setting pressure, remove the Veress needle and set a 12-mm trocar as a visual port (Figure 2).\nInsert the robotic camera lens and fully inspect the abdominal cavity. Search and biopsy suspicious metastatic nodules and send them for frozen section histology8.\nIf the adhesions disturb the trocar setting, release them first using the laparoscopic instrument.\nSet the three robotic arm ports. Place the trocar after making transverse 8 mm skin incisions for each trocar. Place arm 1 (R1) in the right McBurney's point (Figure 2). Place arm 2 (R2) in the left midclavicular line at the level of the visual port (Figure 2). Place arm 3 (R3) in the left anterior axillary line at the level of the visual port (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the distance between adjacent ports is 8-10 cm.\nPlace a 12 mm assistant port 1 (A1) in the right midclavicular line at the level of the visual port (Figure 2).\nPlace an 8 mm assistant port 2 (A2) approximately 1-2 cm above the pubic symphysis (Figure 2).\nPlace the patient in a 30° Trendelenburg position with a 15° right down.\nAfter setting these ports, place the da Vinci robot between the patient's legs and attach the camera arm and three operation arms to the trocar using system guidance.\nPlace the robotic instruments. Place monopolar scissors in R1, bipolar grasper in R2, and Cadiere grasping forceps in R3.\n\t\t​NOTE: The instrument in R1 can be replaced depending on the actions of the primary surgeon. The most commonly used instruments are monopolar scissors and harmonic scalpels.\n3. Total mesorectal excision\nMobilize the left colon.\n\t\nRetract the descending and sigmoid colon medially by Cadiere grasping forceps in R3 to expose the left paracolic sulci.",
    "Release the physiologic adhesions of the descending and sigmoid colon along the paracolic sulci with monopolar scissors in R1. Incise the peritoneum along paracolic sulci and dissect the descending colon from superior to inferior with monopolar scissors in R1 until the ureter is exposed to mobilize the lateral side of the descending and splenic flexure colon. Place a piece of sterile gauze near the ureter as an indicator.\nAfter mobilizing the lateral side of the descending and splenic flexure colon, grasp and keep elevating the sigmoid colon with its mesentery forward using Cadiere grasping forceps in R3. Create tension in the mesentery with a bipolar grasper in R2 and forceps in the assistant's hand. Then, recognize the \"white line\" of Toldt's fascia, an avascular plane. Incise the peritoneum along the \"white line\".\nSeparate along this plane toward the lateral paracolic sulci with monopolar scissors in R1 to mobilize the sigmoid colon. Afterward, create a tunnel between the medial and lateral compartments under the guidance of the indicator gauze that was set previously. Continue to develop this plane downward to the sacral promontory using electrocautery and combine sharp and blunt spreading. Perform the dissection rapidly to completely mobilize the descending and sigmoid colon.\nTransect the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and inferior mesenteric vein (IMV).\n\t\nAfter mobilizing the sigmoid colon, grasp and keep elevating the sigmoid colon with forceps in R3 to expose the aorta. Dissect along the aorta superiorly with monopolar scissors in R1 to expose the IMA.\nChange the instrument in R1 from monopolar scissors to a harmonic scalpel.",
    "From the root of the IMA, separate the lymphatic tissue from the vessels with an ultrasonic scalpel in R1 until the left colic artery appears. Have the assistant surgeon clip the IMA below the origin of the left colic artery with a large locking clip. Then, transect with the harmonic scalpel to minimize bleeding.\nContinue to separate the lymphatic tissue from the left colic artery with a harmonic scalpel in R1. Recognize the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and the descending branch of the left colic artery. Have the assistant surgeon clip and transect these 2 vessels.\nPerform pelvic dissection of the rectum.\n\t\nUse a ribbon retractor to lift the rectum. Place the grasping forceps in A2 by the assistant surgeon and control the movement of the rectum by griping the ribbon retractor. Change the instrument in R1 to monopolar scissors.\nLift the rectum forward with Cadiere grasping forceps inserted through the posterior margin of the sigmoid colon to expose the sacral promontory. Then, dissect into the retrorectal plane between mesorectal fascia and prehypogastric nerve fascia with monopolar scissors in R1. Develop along this plane and separate the mesorectal fascia from prehypogastric nerve fascia using monopolar scissors in R1 until the level of the levator ani muscle is reached (Figure 3A).\n\t\tNOTE: The integrity of the mesorectal fascia should be retained.\nIncise the peritoneum and open the lateral mesorectal plane close to the rectum with monopolar scissors in R1. Have the assistant surgeon move the rectum to the other side.\nChange the instrument in R1 to a harmonic scalpel. Carefully dissect and develop this plane until the level of the levator ani muscle is reached. Repeat this step for the contralateral side.",
    "NOTE: In fact, because anterior dissection has still not been performed, the lateral mesorectal plane is difficult to develop completely. If it seems difficult to operate, consider dealing with the anterior plane first.\nIncise the peritoneum 1 cm above the reflection of the visceral peritoneum with the harmonic scalpel in R1. After incising the reflection of the visceral peritoneum, identify the seminal vesicles and Denonvilliers' fascia that cover the posterior wall of the seminal vesicle.\n\t\tNOTE: In women, dissection should be performed between the vaginal posterior wall and mesorectal fascia. Surgeons should avoid damaging the thin vaginal posterior wall.\nContinue to develop the plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and mesorectal fascia until the level of the levator ani muscle is reached with the harmonic scalpel in R3.\nAt this time, conduct a digital rectal examination transanally to confirm that the dissection has proceeded past the distal margin of the tumor and that there are appropriate margins for resection.\nSeparate the adipose tissue surrounding the rectum at this level. Transect the rectum using a laparoscopic linear cutting stapler.\n\t\t​NOTE: Ensure that the rectum is transected below the distal border of the tumor with a distal margin of 2 cm or greater whenever possible.\nTake the rectum out from the pelvic cavity and copiously irrigate the pelvic cavity with distilled water. Perform hemostasis using electrocautery with bipolar forceps in R2.\n4. Lateral pelvic lymph node dissection",
    "NOTE: Bilateral LPLND can commence on either the left or the right side. The current technique guideline suggests starting on the left. After releasing and mobilizing the sigmoid colon and rectum, the left common/external iliac artery and left ureter can be identified clearly, which facilitates starting the lymphadenectomy on this side. The lateral pelvic lymph nodes involve the common iliac area (No. 273), external iliac area (No. 293), obturator area (No. 283), and internal iliac area (No. 263). However, previous studies indicate that common iliac and external iliac lymph node metastases are rare9. Therefore, treatment guidelines for colorectal cancer recommend primarily focusing on the obturator area (No. 283) and internal iliac area (No. 263) for dissection9.\nStarting on the left, incise the peritoneum just lateral to the ureter with the harmonic scalpel in R1. Extend the incision up to the vas deferens.\n\tNOTE: In women, the incision should be extended up to the round ligament. Use a harmonic scalpel to minimize vascular injury.\nIdentify the left ureter at the level of its crossing with the iliac vessels. Then mobilize the ureter and move it to the medial side with forceps in R3. Let the ureter and prehypogastric nerve fascia become the medial plane of the lateral node dissection.\n\tNOTE: Complete skeletonization of the ureter may damage the blood supply of the ureter, which should be avoided if possible. In addition, keep the dissection lateral to the ureter and prehypogastric nerve fascia to avoid damaging the pelvic autonomic nerve located medial to this fascia.\nFrom the lateral to the external iliac artery, separate the lymphatic tissue surrounding the external iliac artery and vein with the harmonic scalpel in R1.",
    "Retract the external iliac vein laterally with the aspirator in the assistant's hand. At the bifurcation of the internal and external iliac artery, separate lymphatic tissue with a harmonic scalpel in R1 and identify the obturator nerve and umbilical artery. At the lateral wall, completely release the lymphatic tissue from the surface of the psoas and internal obturator muscles (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: The bifurcation of the internal and external iliac arteries is at the proximal end of the lateral node dissection.\nRetract the umbilical artery and vesicohypogastric fascia medially with the aspirator in the assistant's hand and separate lymphatic tissue from vesicohypogastric fascia. Let the umbilical artery and vesicohypogastric fascia become the medial wall of dissection of obturator nodes (#283). Carefully separate the lymphatic tissue from fascia and nerve along the obturator nerve with the harmonic scalpel in R1 and identify the obturator artery and vein, which are the branches of the internal iliac artery and vein. Carefully isolate the obturator artery and vein to avoid injury.\n\tNOTE: Some patients may have two or more obturator nerve branches according to our experience. Injury or transection of one of these branches may not lead to severe dysfunction. However, complete transection of all the branches of one side of the obturator nerve should be avoided as much as possible.\nRetract the ureter and prehypogastric nerve fascia medially with the aspirator in the assistant's hand (Figure 3D). Completely release the lymphatic tissue from fascia with a harmonic scalpel in R1. Identify and isolate the 2-3 superior vesical arteries - these are the branches of the umbilical artery.\n\tNOTE: Avoid ligating all superior vesical artery branches to minimize urinary dysfunction. At least one superior vesical artery should be preserved, especially when bilateral LPLND is performed. Otherwise, severe urinary dysfunction can occur.",
    "Continue to dissect the lymphatic and fatty tissue distally with the harmonic scalpel in R1 until meeting the vas deferens.\n\tNOTE: In women, dissection should be performed until the round ligament is reached.\nRemove the lymphatic adipose tissue as a single specimen from the fossa using a sterile specimen bag (Figure 3E,F). Check and ensure that there is no residual lymphatic tissue and no bleeding.\nIf necessary, repeat steps listed in this section on the right to complete right-side lymphadenectomy.\n5. Reconstruction of the digestive tract\nNOTE: Here, depending on the experience and preference of the primary surgeon, either a stapled colorectal or handsewn anastomosis can be chosen via open or robotic laparoscopic methods. Methods of anastomosis include straight end-to-end anastomosis, small reservoir end-to-side colorectal anastomosis, or colonic J-pouch anastomosis10. Here, we provide a basic, open, straight end-to-end stapled colorectal anastomosis technique.\nMake a vertical midline incision below umbilical. Place a wound protector.\n\tNOTE: One can also select a Pfannenstiel incision or other type of incision depending on the experience and preference of the primary surgeon.\nDetermine the transection level according to the position of the tumor and the length of the colon. The transection level should be at least 10 cm proximal to the proximal border of the tumor. Attempt to attach the proximal colon toward the rectal stump and ensure that there is no undue tension.\nSeparate the proximal and distal mesentery. Ligate the vascular arch of colon. Release the fat tissue surrounding the transection level colon.\nClamp the colon using purse-string forceps at the level determined previously. Make a purse string using a purse-string needle. Transect the colon.",
    "Insert the anvil into the colon lumen and secure the purse string onto the anvil shaft with 0 silk sutures. Return the proximal colon to the abdominal cavity. Now, the specimen has been completely removed.\nIntroduce a circular stapler transanally under laparoscopic guidance, gently rotating the adjusting knob counterclockwise. Fully extend the trocar and pierce the tissue.\nSlide the anvil shaft over the trocar until the anvil snaps into a fully seated position. Close by turning adjusting the knob clockwise. Start the stapler complete the anastomosis.\n6. Diverting loop ileostomy\nNOTE: Whether a diverting loop ileostomy is performed depends on the height and quality of the anastomosis and whether the patient was treated with radiation preoperatively. If ileostomy is not chosen, please skip steps 6.1.1-6.1.7.\nMake an incision in the right lower quadrant away from any skin creases, bony prominences, and other incisions.\n\tNOTE: If diverting loop ileostomy is expected preoperatively, attempt to place R1 through the lateral aspect of the marked area to minimize the number of incisions.\nEvert a length of mobilized, well-vascular supplied small bowel loop through the abdominal wall while avoiding any twisting of the mesentery.\nMake a mesenteric defect at the avascular area. Place a drain in the mesentery to aid in the externalization of the loop for maturation as a stoma.\nDivide the antimesenteric wall of the ileum close to the distal limb at the level of the stoma bridge using electrocautery.\n\tNOTE: This opening should be created from one mesenteric edge to the other.\nPerform interrupted suturing at the edge of the stoma and the distal third of the abdominal incision.",
    "Attach the edge of the stoma to the seromuscularity of the proximal ileum wall by reversing the ileum wall. Interrupted suture the edge of the stoma, the seromuscularity of the proximal ileum and the proximal subcuticular layer of the abdominal opening. Create an everted bud.\nComplete the mucocutaneous junction.\nClose the fascia and incision.\n\t\nCopiously irrigate all wounds with saline.\nPlace a 19-Fr round channel drain beside the anastomotic stoma through the R3 incision.\nInterrupted suture the peritoneum and subcutaneous layer. Intradermal suture the skin layer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
