    "Animal experiments in this study were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Mackay Medical College. Eight-week-old Male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center (New Taipei City, Taiwan). All mice were bred and housed in accordance with the standard animal protocol.\n1. Induction of NIHL in mice\nPrepare the cage for the experimental mice\n\t\nTo do so, use a rat trap cage with dimensions of 14 cm × 17 cm × 24 cm. Cut four pieces of corrugated plastic boards into appropriate sizes, making them fit into the cage (13 cm × 23 cm and 13 cm × 16 cm).\nTo prevent the mice from getting their feet cut by the mesh grid, place two of the pieces at the bottom and on the back side, respectively. Place the other two pieces perpendicularly interlocked with each other, to divide the space within the cage into quarters.\nCarry out this study in a soundproof box. Place a speaker 8.5 cm in front of the cage, and place both the speaker and the cage in a soundproof box.\nOpen the CLIO application software\nMove the cursor to the speaker icon, then click on TwoSin. Enter and change the value of Freq 1 to 1000 Hz, Freq 2 to 6000 Hz, and click on OK to start playing the sound.\nUnder the Leq tab, change dBV to dBSPL. After setting the time on the software interface, click the green triangle button to play the sound.",
    "Place a microphone in front of the speaker at a distance of 8.5 cm to calibrate the noise level (see Supplementary File 1). Adjust the noise level to 125 dB SPL-A and continuously monitor for no less than 3 min to ensure that the noise level is sufficiently stable. Use a generator, an analyzer, and an amplifier to create and control the noise. (Figure 1)\n\tNOTE: Do this step in a soundproof box to avoid damage to the operator's hearing.\nPlace four male C57BL/6J mice into the cage (one for each quarter) for noise exposure. Randomly assign the mice in each quarter during the noise exposure. Place a microphone onto the top of the cage to monitor the noise level during the noise exposure (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Do this step in a soundproof box to avoid damage to the operator's hearing.\nExpose the mice to the noise at frequencies of 1 kHz and 6 kHz continuously for 6 h per day, for 5 consecutive days.\nMeasure the hearing thresholds of the mice 1 day after the noise exposure (i.e., on the 6th day) by measuring the ABR. Repeat these ABR measurements again 1 week after the noise exposure (i.e., on the 13th day). After the ABR measurements, sacrifice all the involved mice and harvest their cochleae (Figure 3).\n2. Auditory brainstem response (ABR)-based assessment of hearing threshold\nUse a commercial ABR testing system specifically designed for small animals10.\nIntraperitoneally inject a mixture of tiletamine and zolazepam (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (9.3 mg/kg) into the mice for general anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: ABR assessment takes ~2 h. Make sure to provide thermal support via a heating pad and apply eye ointment to prevent dryness while the mouse is under anesthesia.",
    "Measure the ABR in the mouse under general anesthesia. Place subdermal needle electrodes (12 mm) at the vertex, behind the pinna of the left ear, and back near the tail to measure the hearing threshold.\nPresent acoustic stimuli using a speaker placed 1 cm from the animal's left ear.\nUse an oscilloscope to control the acoustic stimuli. Choose Sine Wave for the stimuli and 10 k for the window scale. Turn the Frequency knob to obtain the desired frequency of the acoustic stimuli.\nAdjust the stimulus intensity by turning the AMLP knob on the function generator. Obtain the desired stimulus intensity by turning the AMLP knob to a suitable voltage, calculated from calibration.\nCollect the ABR measurements under a series of stimulus intensities, from 10 dB SPL to 100 dB SPL, with a 10 dB step size.\n\tNOTE: Measure the hearing threshold in a soundproof box. The minimum stimulus intensity level that could give rise to a discernable Wave V in the collected signal was assumed to be the ABR threshold10,11 (Figure 4). Post-ABR assessment, monitor the animal until it recovers from anesthesia (~1 h).\n3. Microscopic examination\nFixing the harvested tissue\n\t\nAfter the ABR measurements, sacrifice the mouse by intraperitoneally injecting a mixture of tiletamine and zolazepam (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (23.25 mg/kg) for the microscopic examination.\nHarvest the cochleae from the mouse and immediately immerse them in 10% formaldehyde (FA) for fixation (two cochlea/mL) for at least 8 h at 4 °C.\nFollowing fixation, replace the FA solution with a 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution for decalcification for 3-4 days at 4 °C. Then, check each cochlea with tweezers to confirm that the cochleae are sufficiently softened.",
    "Place the cochleae in a Petri dish filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cut the spiral-shaped organ of Corti (OC) (each decalcified cochlea) into three sections-the basal turn, middle turn, and apical turn-for tissue staining.\nUnder a dissecting microscope (magnification: 8x-35x), remove the bony structures (scala vestibuli, scala tympani, and modiolus) of the decalcified cochleae and obtain the soft tissue, including the OC (thickness: about 40 µm).\nCochlea immunofluorescence staining\n\t\nPreparation of the blocking buffer: Prepare 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2% Triton X-100 solutions in PBS.\nTransfer the tissue to be stained from the Petri dish to a microcentrifuge tube, and immerse the tissue in 0.1 mL of the blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature (RT).\nPreparation of the Myo7A primary antibody buffer: Dilute the Myo7A primary antibody in the blocking buffer at a volume ratio of 1:200.\nTreat the tissue in the microcentrifuge tube with 100 µL of Myo7A primary antibody buffer for 2 h at RT.\nRinse the tissue three times in PBS for 5 min each.\nPreparation of the Myo7A secondary antibody (Myo7A-Rb-488) and phalloidin antibody (phalloidin-594) buffer: Dilute Myo7A secondary antibody (1:400) and phalloidin antibody (1:200) in the blocking buffer.\nTreat the tissue with 100 µL of Myo7A secondary antibody and phalloidin antibody buffer for 2 h at RT.\nAfter antibody + phalloidin antibody treatment, rinse the tissue in PBS three times, for 5 min each.\nTransfer the rinsed tissue from the microcentrifuge tube to a Petri dish filled with PBS using a 1 mL plastic transfer pipette with a cut tip.",
    "To prepare for the microscopic examination, unfold the tissue, place it onto a glass slide, and add 15 µL of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluoromount medium onto the tissue to fully cover it. Place a glass coverslip gently over the tissue. Leave the slide overnight at RT before sealing it with nail polish.\nImage acquisition\n\t\nAcquire 2D images using an upright fluorescence microscope and image acquisition software.\nBefore performing the microscopic examination, center the tissue in the field of view and adjust the sensitivity to ISO 100. Adjust the exposure time initially by clicking on the Automatic Mode button of the software, and then fine-tune manually by clicking on the Adjust button to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.\nAdjust the wavelength of the incident light to excite the fluorophores by rotating the fluorescence cube. Pseudo colors were used to mark the emission from different fluorescent labels (blue light: DAPI; green light: Myo7A; red light: phalloidin).\nBy scanning the tissue sample, generate and collect the imaging data as .tif and .jpg image files.\nSubscription Required.
