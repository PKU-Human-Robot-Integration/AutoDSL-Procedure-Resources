    "Disruption of BBB by cerebral cold injury [see Material and Methods in Michinaga et al. (2014)] Mice (5 to 6 week old male ddY, SLC) were placed in a stereotactic device (Narishige, model: SR-6N) under anesthesia. The scalp was incised at the midline and the skull was exposed. A copper rod (10 cm length, 4 mm diameter) was kept in a 50 ml conical tube filled with powdered dry ice. The cooled rod was set on a micromanipulator with the conical tube. The tip of the cooled rod was applied to the skull of the left hemisphere at a position of 3 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to bregma for 60 sec. In this study, the injured mice were recovered for 72 h prior to perfusion.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150429/20150429195240_6377.jpgFigure 1. Procedure of cerebral cold injury. A copper rod (10 cm length, 4 mm diameter) was shown in the left photograph. It was set in a 50 ml conical tube and cooled by dry ice powder. After mice were placed in a stereotactic device under anesthesia, the cooled rod was attached in the left hemisphere on the skull shown in middle and right photographs.Mouse perfusionMake experimental manipulations to reproduce brain insults. Disruption of BBB and brain edema will gradually develop thereafter. Anesthetize mice deeply by pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i. p.).Perform laparotomy until the heart can be clearly seen.Tear the liver for outflow of the circulating blood.Connect the wing needle and syringe.Prick the winged needle into left cardiac ventricle and slowly inflow 50 ml PBS for about 20 min checking the outflow of blood from the liver.Protein samples from the mouse cerebrumDecapitate mice after perfusion by scissors and peel the skull by forceps.",
    "Set the cerebrum in the acrylic brain slicer and cut the cerebrum in coronal brain sections (4 mm thick between 1 and 5 mm posterior to bregma) by razor (Figure 2A-C).Collect the brain tissue in sampling tubes containing 200 µl of the lysis buffer (Figure 2D). Homogenize the brain tissue by Digital Sonifier® (20 kHz, 200 W) (Figure 2E-F). Centrifuge the lysates at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Collect the supernatant in sampling tubes (Figure 2G).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150506/20150506004815_7900.pngFigure 2. Procedure of mouse perfusion with PBS and collections of perfused cerebrum. A. Perfused mouse cerebrum was isolated and set in the acrylic brain slicer. B. The cerebrum in coronal brain section was cut. C. The injured cortex was isolated from the coronal brain section. D. Collection of the injured mouse cortex. The injured cortex was collected in sampling tubes containing 200 µl of the lysis buffer. E. Digital Sonifier® for homogenization was shown. F. The collected hemispheres were homogenized by Digital Sonifier®. G. After the homogenized samples were centrifuged, the supernatant was collected in sampling tubes.Measurement of proteinsDilute samples 10-fold by lysis buffer.Add 20 µl BSA standards (0, 125, 250, 500 and 750 µg/ml) or 20 µl samples to each  well in the 96-well plate.Mix BCA Protein Assay Reagent A and BCA Protein Assay Reagent B (at rate of 50:1) in a 15 ml conical tube.Add 150 µl mixture of BCA Protein Assay Reagent A and BCA Protein Assay Reagent B to each well in the 96-well plate.Incubate at room temperature (RT) for 30 min.Measure absorbance at OD570 nm by a microplate reader. The protein samples were diluted in 0.2 mg/ml prior to ELISA.Preparation of ELISA plateDilute anti-mouse albumin goat antibody in 1/100 with immobilizing solution.Add 100 µl of the diluted anti-mouse albumin to each well.",
    "Seal the plate and incubate it at RT for 4 h.Rinse the plate with PBST (200 µl to each well) 3 times.Add 200 µl of soaking solution to each well.Incubate at RT for 5 min.Dry the plate at RT.Pack the plate and store at 4 °C at overnight. If you want to finish the ELISA in one day, you can skip this step.ELISADilute mouse serum albumin at each concentration (0, 6.25, 12.5, 50 and 100 ng/ml) by lysis buffer. These mouse serum albumin solutions are used as standard solutions. Add 50 µl albumin standard solutions or 50 µl samples (10 µg protein) to each well in the prepared ELISA plate. Seal the plate and incubate it at RT for 2 h.Wash the plate with PBST (200 µl to each well) by using a microplate mixer at medium speed for 5 min 5 times.Remove PBST and dry the plate at RT for 15 min.Add 100 µl of a HRP-conjugated anti-mouse albumin goat antibody (diluted 1/1,000) with PBS to each well.Seal the plate and incubate it at RT for 1 h.Wash the plate with PBST (200 µl to each well) by using a microplate mixer at medium speed for 5 min 5 times. Add 100 µl of SureBlueTM TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate to each well.Incubate at RT for 5 min.Add 100 µl of 450 nm BioFX® Liquid Nova-Stop Solution for TMB Microwell Substrates to each well.Read the plate using a microplate reader at 450 nm.Calculate the concentrations of albumin using the standard curve."
