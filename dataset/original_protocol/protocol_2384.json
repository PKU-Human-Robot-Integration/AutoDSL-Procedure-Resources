Scale bars, 5 μm.\nPurifying the protein of interest\nTiming: ∼1 week\nThis step describes how to purify the protein used for phase separation. Here, we describe the procedure for preparing the Ago1-GFP fusion protein using Ni-Sepharose to purify His-tagged protein.\nNote: The details of the protein purification will depend on the identity of the desired protein.\nAlternatives: MBP, Flag, or GST tag can also be used to purify the interested protein. Except for the bacteria purification, Expi293 GnTi cell or pichiaPink yeast expression system can also be used to purify the protein.\nExpi293 GnTi expression system: https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/A39250?SID=srch-srp-A39250[href=https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/A39250?SID=srch-srp-A39250].\npichiaPink yeast expression system: https://wwwPthermofisher.cn/cn/zh/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-expression/yeast-protein-expression/pichiapink-yeast-expression-systems.html[href=https://wwwpthermofisher.cn/cn/zh/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-expression/yeast-protein-expression/pichiapink-yeast-expression-systems.html].\nDesign the primers. The primer sequence is shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2022_7.csv\nDesign the primers for the Ago1-GFP fusion gene using SnapGene software. Primer Ago1-F contains 15 bases of the pET28a plasmid for recombination. Primer Ago1-R contains at least 15 bases of GFP for recombination. Primer GFP-R contains 15 bases of the pET28a plasmid for recombination.\nConstruct the pET28a-Ago1-GFP plasmid.\nPrepare two 50 μL PCR reaction mixes in PCR tubes to amplify Ago1 and GFP, respectively. The PCR reaction mixes are shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], and the reaction cycling conditions are given in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2022_8.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2022_9.csv\nPurify the PCR products using the Vazyme gel purification kit.\nPause point: The PCR products can be stored at 4°C overnight.\nPCR product recombination with EcoR1/Xho1-digested plasmid.",
    "Recombine the PCR products with EcoR1/Xho1-digested plasmid. The recombination reaction is described in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2022_10.csv\nTransform Escherichia coli (E. coli) DH5α with the recombination mixture.\nPick a single colony and grow it in 1 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium.\nThe LB was cultured at 37°C for 5–6 h, taking 1 μL LB as a template and running PCR to identify positive clones.\nSequence to confirm the plasmid.\nExtract the plasmid with FastPure EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit.\nExpress and purify Ago1-GFP protein.\nTransform E. coli BL21 with the pET28a plasmid for the bacterial expression of the His-tagged fusion Ago1-GFP protein.\nPick a single colony and grow it in 5 mL of LB medium containing 100 μg/mL kanamycin Incubate at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm.\nNote: The antibiotic selection depends on the constructs that the users will employ.\nDilute the overnight culture with 250 mL of fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/mL kanamycin and continue shaking at 37°C until OD600nm = 0.6 (∼3–5 h).\nAdd 1 mM IPTG and shake for an additional 16 h at 16°C to induce Ago1-GFP protein expression. Collect the cells by centrifuging for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nNote: The bacterial cell pellet can be stored at −80°C for several weeks.\nResuspend the bacterial cell pellet in 40 mL of lysis buffer. Sonicate the cells at 40% power using 5 s on/5 s off for 15–25 min.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant to a new 50 mL tube, and filter the supernatant through a 0.45 μm filter.\nAdd 300 μL of Ni beads to a column and wash the beads with 10 mL of H2O followed by 10 mL of binding buffer.",
    "Add the lysate to the column and incubate to allow binding between the His-tagged protein and the Ni beads.\nWash the beads three times with 10 mL of washing buffer.\nNote: Vary the imidazole concentration to achieve optimal washing.\nElute the protein with elution buffer and separate the sample on SDS-PAGE. Stain with Coomassie blue G-250 to check the protein quality and quantity.\nUltrafiltration or dialysis to remove the imidazole. The protein was diluted in the dilution buffer.\nPause point: The protein can be used for the next step or can be stored at −80°C.\nNote: The protein can be further purified with an AKTA purifier to improve the quality of the protein sample.\nAlternatives: Dialysis or ultrafiltration to remove imidazole can also improve the quality of the protein.\nPreparation of GUVs\nTiming: 3–5 h\nA commonly used method to generate GUVs is the hydration method, which is based on the principle of membrane swelling (Reeves and Dowben, 1969[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). In this method, phospholipids and cholesterol are dissolved in an organic solvent such as chloroform that is then evaporated under a gentle flow of nitrogen until the solvent is removed. During the evaporation, a phospholipid film forms on the glass substrate. The film is then hydrated with an aqueous buffer, and GUVs begin to form owing to a combination of osmotic pressure, electrostatic interactions, and the hydrophobic effect (Stein et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Tsumoto et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The hydration method is easy and safe to prepare GUVs. This method not only allows the formation of charged lipids in GUVs but also avoids the disadvantages of the electro-formation method which might impact the oxidation of the lipids.\nDissolve the phospholipids or lipids in chloroform.",
    "Weigh 2.4 mg of DOPC (MW 786.113, C44H84NO8P) with Micro-Analysis Balance (METTLER TOLEDO) in 3 mL of chloroform to make a 0.8 mg/mL solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nWeigh 2.2 mg of DPPC (MW 734.04, C40H80NO8P) with Micro-Analysis Balance in 3 mL of chloroform to make a 0.73 mg/mL solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nWeigh 1.2 mg of cholesterol (MW 386.65, C25H49O19P3) with Micro-Analysis Balance in 3 mL of chloroform to make a 0.4 mg/mL solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nDissolve 0.1 mg of PI(4,5)P2 (MW 746.57, C25H49O19P3) in 1.33 mL of chloroform to make a 0.075 mg/mL solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). (The reagent contains 0.1 mg powder of PI(4,5)P2 total).\nNote: It is recommended to prepare a fresh solution because the chloroform is easily volatilized.\nLow temperature can reduce the volatilization, the stock solution can be transferred to brown screw-top bottles and stored at −20°C for no more than 6 months.\nNote: The users can also prepare a larger quantity of stock and store it at −20°C for no more than 6 months.\nIn a brown screw-top bottle, mix the lipids in the amounts shown in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5], the weight ratio of DOPC: DPPC: Cholesterol: PI(4,5)P2 is 36:23:6:6. Vortex to fully mix (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2022_11.csv\nNote: During this procedure, it is recommended to keep the stock solutions on ice to minimize the volatilization of chloroform.\nRemove the chloroform by blowing clean nitrogen (the purity is 99.999%) and further dry with nitrogen for at least 40 min.\nNote: The lipids dissolved in chloroform will be deposited onto the solid substrate. As the solvent evaporates, the amphiphilic structure of the lipids leads to the clustering of several stacks of bilayers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A right panel).\nCritical: The chloroform must be completely removed, otherwise the growth buffer will not support good GUV growth.",
    "Add 200 μL of growth buffer and incubate for 1 h at 60°C in the drying oven (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCritical: As PI(4,5)P2 is a negatively charged lipid, the absence of salt in the growth buffer may prevent the incorporation of PI(4,5)P2 in the GUV (Beber et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We recommended using the growth buffer containing at least 50 mM NaCl.\nAfter incubation, transfer the GUV to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge the GUV sample at 100 × g for 10 min at room temperature to remove aggregated lipid species.\nNote: The supernatant is used for the protein phase separation experiments (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: Although the deposited lipids are uniformly mixed, each vesicle will vary slightly in composition.\nCritical: Chloroform can harm the eyes, skin, liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Chloroform can be toxic if inhaled or swallowed. This step should be carried out in a fume hood.\nCritical: The chloroform must be completely removed. Residual chloroform can affect GUV growth.\nAgo1 forms phase separation on the PI(4,5)P2-containing GUV membranes\nTiming: ∼30 min\nIncubate the purified protein with the GUVs to make the protein phase separation on the membrane.\nIncubate the protein with GUVs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nRemove the protein from −80°C storage and place it on ice to allow the sample to thaw slowly.\nCritical: GUVs (especially PI(4,5)P2-containing GUVs) must be freshly prepared because PI(4,5)P2 can migrate from the bilayer to the buffer (Beber et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: It is recommended to freshly prepare the protein. However, the purified protein can be stored at −80°C for a short period. In our hands, Ago1 protein in dilution buffer was stored at −80°C for 1 week and still works.",
    "Note: The concentration of the protein used may be different depending on the identity of the desired protein. For AGO1 protein, it works at a concentration between 0.3-3 mg/mL. High protein concentration is not essential for its phase separation on the membrane because there always be excess protein compared with PI(4,5)P2. We recommend using the protein approximately at 1 mg/mL concentration for the first time.\nAdd the components separately as shown in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] in a 250 μL PCR tube at room temperature.\nTransfer the mixture immediately to a glass cell culture dish and cover it with a square coverslip, seal the coverslip with nail polish to prevent liquid evaporation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2022_12.csv\nImage acquisition: 3D and time-lapse imaging\nTiming: 0.5–2 h\nThe image acquisition time depends on the microscope, the file size, the image software processing time, and the user’s experience.\nHere, we describe the confocal settings and software processing procedures. The images in this protocol apply (Gao et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 980 with an Airyscan 2 confocal microscope. The microscope was controlled by ZEN 3.1 Blue software. We used Imaris 9.0.1 software for 3D reconstruction and movie export.\nAlternatives: Other confocal microscopes such as Nikon or Leica and their related software is also OK.\nOpen the ZEN 3.1 software.\nOpen ZEN 3.1 (blue edition) by double-clicking the software icon on the desktop. Select “ZEN System” to initialize the hardware (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2022-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(J) Details of exporting image.\nSet up the microscope and locate the GUVs.\nClick the Locate tab and find the GUVs through the eyepiece.\nNote: First, use the 10 × objective to find the GUVs, then change to the 40 × oil objective. Put some immersion oil on the 40 × oil objective before starting the imaging process.\nGo to the Acquisition mode and click the Smart Setup button. Select the channels needed (we mainly use 555 nm and 488 nm to observe the GUVs and proteins, respectively). Choose the Airyscan, SNR/Sensitivity, smartest (line) capture module (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nNote: The channel selection may be different depending on the fluorophore.\nHighlight a single track in the Channels window to set the parameters associated with the wavelength. Set the Laser Power to 0.4% initially. Increase the laser power if the detector gain cannot achieve the desired intensity. Values of 1%–3% are typically sufficient, but the Master Gain can be increased to obtain a stronger signal. The master gain should be set no higher than 850 V under the Airyscan module (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nOptional: Decrease the Digital Offset to reduce the background signal. Caution should be used here, as the true signal may be eliminated without altering the sensitivity. Increase the Digital Gain to amplify all signals and background, thereby stretching the histogram. Again, sensitivity is not directly altered with this function.\nAdjust the scanning parameters.\nGo to the Acquisition Mode window and select a suitable area and zoom setting to capture an area of interest. After a Live image has been stopped, use the Crop button to adjust the desired field of view (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nSelect a Frame Size to represent the desired area per pixel. 1024 × 1024 is often used as a starting point (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).",
    "Adjust the Scan speed to 9 for a quick scan speed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nSelect Bidirectional scanning mode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nSelect a value for Averaging that can improve image quality. A small amount of averaging (2–4) is enough to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nSelect the dynamic range with the Bits per Pixel setting. Eight-bit is often sufficient (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nClick the Snap button to acquire a single frame. For 3D or time-lapse imaging, please see the next step.\nZ-stack and time-series set up.\nSelect the Z-stack and Time-Series checkbox in the main experiment tool area.\nGo to the Z-stack window and select the preferred scanning mode; we use First/Last mode (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nSelect the Live button, use the focus knob to locate one end of the specimen, then click the Set First button. Focus on another end of the specimen, then click the Set Last button (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nSet the Interval to define the step size of the Z-stack. For the best 3D reconstruction, use the value of the Optimal button (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nGo to the Time-Series window and set the Duration and Interval values (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nFind a GUV that contains phase-separated proteins. Start imaging by clicking the Start Experiment button (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nFiles are processed by Airyscan and saved in .czi format (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J and 2K) which can be opened directly by Imaris 9.0.1 (see 3D reconstruction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5] below).\n3D reconstruction\nTiming: ∼30 min\nThis procedure is for reconstructing 3D GUVs containing phase-separated protein and mainly uses the “surfaces” module of Imaris. This construction enables us to visualize the behavior of the Ago1 protein on the GUV membrane.\nOpen the Imaris software.\nOpen Imaris 9.0.1 by double-clicking the software icon on the desktop.",

Set the Surfaces Detail and Background Subtraction. For background subtraction, if you are the first to set this, click on Slice mode in the top menu; from slice view, you can look at the slices of your image. Measure distances by left-clicking on the image. Here, we have measured a general granule as 0.6 μm. Set the measured distance as the background subtraction and go to the next step (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).",
    "Note: The parameters are sensitive to the image quality. Choosing a proper setting for the reconstruction is an iterative process.\nClick on either the blue or green arrow at the bottom to finish the surface reconstruction (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3E). Ensure you are satisfied with the reconstruction by dragging and zooming in and out. Examples of sufficient and insufficient surface reconstructions are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F.\nNote: Select/unselect the fluorescence channels and the reconstructed surfaces to check whether there is sufficient overlap. If refinement is needed, start over from step 19. If you are satisfied with the result, export the image by clicking Store As and save the image.\n3D time-lapse reconstruction and movie export\nTiming: ∼30 min\nThis procedure is for reconstructing a 3D time-lapse image, this construction enables us to visualize the dynamic change of the protein on the GUV membrane.\nOpen the 3D/time-lapse file in Imaris 9.0.1 as shown in step 17.\nClick the Animation button to see the dynamic change of the phase-separated proteins. View the movie by pressing the left mouse button to see different slices changing over time (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCreate a new surface reconstruction as shown in step 19.\nNote: Be careful when setting the Surface Detail. If the Surface Detail value is too low, it may result in a long time for reconstruction or even cause the software to crash. In addition, several tutorial videos can be useful for green hands: https://imaris.oxinst.com/tutorials[href=https://imaris.oxinst.com/tutorials].\nClick the Snapshot button to find the Preferences tab and click the Display button to change the background color.
