    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 0: Prepare cultures\nTiming: 1 h\nPrepare cultures for the experiment\nIn the morning:\nInoculate a single colony in 3 mL synthetic (complete or selective) yeast media.\nIncubate tubes at 30°C in rotating wheel.\nCritical: Use synthetic complete (SC) medium. Do not use YPD media since YPD has a high level of autofluorescence, which interferes with the actual signal during imaging. For ade- strains, supplement media with extra adenine to prevent high levels of autofluorescence.\nIn the evening (8–9 h after the inoculation of morning cultures):\nMeasure the OD600 of the cultures.\nDilute yeast in 25 mL of SC media such that the cultures are at OD600 of 0.5 the next morning.\nThe dilution varies, depending on the growth condition and growth rates of different strains. This step may require some optimization, or one can make a dilution series. As a starting point, wildtype yeast has a doubling time of approximately 1.5 h in SC+2% glucose. With a starting OD600 of ∼0.0008, a 25 mL SC+2% glucose culture will reach OD600 of 0.5 in ∼14 h.\nIncubate the cultures in a 30°C orbital shaker at 200 rpm overnight and harvest each sample when the OD600 is 0.45–0.55 the next morning.\nCritical: It is important to keep the cells at a low optical density at 600 nm (OD600) (i.e., OD600<1.0). Cells with OD600>1.0 are in diauxic shift or stationary phase, during which the carbon source becomes exhausted causing the cells to switch to aerobic respiration. In these growth phases, cells have been observed to have higher autofluorescence levels and are more resistant to cell wall digestion (next step).\nDay 1: Fix and spheroplast yeast cells\nTiming: 3–8 h (depending on number of samples and density of cultures)",
    "Cells are cross-linked using formaldehyde to trap all the interactions and the cell walls are digested to allow the entry the fluorescent oligonucleotides during hybridization (day 2)\nCool tabletop centrifuge to 4°C and prepare two buckets of ice for the subsequent steps—one bucket for a bottle of buffer B and the other bucket for the samples.\nCheck the OD600 and proceed with fixation when the OD600 of each sample is ∼0.5.\nCritical: It is important to let the cultures grow until they reach OD600 ∼0.5 before fixing them with formaldehyde. If the OD600 >0.6, it is best to dilute these cultures to a lower OD600 such that they have 1–2 division cycles for recovery before fixation. Since the concentration of lyticase (in the spheroplasting step) has been optimized for an OD600 ∼0.5 culture, cells in a culture with a OD600>0.5 may be underdigested, whereas cells in a culture with a OD600<0.5 may be overdigested. Furthermore, the overgrown cells exhibit autofluorescence when imaged.\nFor each sample, add 4 mL of 32% PFA to a 50 mL falcon tube.\nAdd 21 mL of each yeast culture to the PFA (5% final concentration) and incubate samples at 18°C–22°C for 20 min, inverting the tubes every 5 min.\nSpin the culture at 3000 × g for 3 min at 4°C and decant the media. Quickly remove excess media by laying the 50 mL falcon tube upside down on tissues. Gently tap off any excess media and place the samples on ice.\nNote: It is optional to use low adhesion tubes as they can significantly reduce cell loss during the subsequent washes.\nCritical: Keep the samples on ice for the remainder of the Day 1 protocol.",
    "Carefully resuspend each pellet with 10 mL of ice-cold 1× buffer B and spin at 3000 × g for 3 min at 4°C. Decant the media and remove excess media by laying the falcon tubes upside down on tissues.\nRepeat step (8) two more times.\nAfter the third wash step, dissolve the pellet in 1 mL 1× buffer B and transfer to a 2 mL eppendorf tube.\nPause point: Cells can be stored on ice for a few hours, until all samples have been fixed and washed. Cells can also be stored at 4°C overnight.\nCool microcentrifuge to 4°C and prepare fresh spheroplasting buffer (keep on ice).\nSpin down cells at 845 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nDecant the media and resuspend each sample in 500 μL of spheroplasting buffer, containing 300U of lyticase per sample.\nIncubate samples in a 30°C thermoshaker for 5 min (100–300 rpm).\nCritical: The units of lyticase and digestion time have been optimized for the number of cells at OD600 0.5. Incubating with lyticase for too long results in overdigestion of the cell walls, resulting in RNA leakage from cells. On the other hand, underdigestion of the cell wall prevents the probes from entering the cells. This step can be optimized by checking the digestion of cells at different times with a phase contrast microscope or a brightfield microscope. In a phase contrast microscope, undigested cells appear as dark cells, whereas digested cells are transparent. Alternatively, in a brightfield microscope, undigested cells will have a clear cell outline whereas the digested cells will lack an outline (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Ultimately, approximately 80% of cells should be digested.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/772-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Using light microscopy to optimize the spheroplasting efficiency with lyticase\n(A) Undigested yeast cells.",
    "(B) Optimal digestion of yeast cells with 300U of lyticase for 5 min at 30°C, with a starting OD600 of 0.50, where 80% of the cells are digested.\n(C) Example image of an overdigested sample. Top: Quasar570, bottom: DAPI. The main sign of overdigestion is the loss of cell structure (white arrows). Furthermore, as the RNAs leak out of the cells, some cells appear to have a cloud of RNAs floating around in the vicinity (yellow arrows).\nSpin samples for 4 min at 160 × g at 4°C.\nDecant the spheroplasting buffer and gently wash the pellet once with 1 mL ice-cold 1× buffer B. Spin at 160 × g at 4°C for 4 min.\nCritical: Do not vortex the cells after the lyticase treatment since cells are very sensitive to mechanical distortion and lysis.\nDecant the buffer and resuspend samples in 1 mL ice-cold 1× buffer B.\nGently pipet ∼400 μL of sample onto an 18 mm poly-L-lysine coated coverslips in a 12-well plate.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min to let the cells adhere to the coverslips. While the cells are incubating, make 70% ethanol and cool at −20°C.\nGently wash the coverslip wells with ice-cold 1× buffer B. Aspirate.\nNote: Since the cells are not stably adhered to the coverslip, pipet the 1× buffer B onto the wall of the well to avoid pipetting directly on the cells.\nAdd 2 mL of cold 70% ethanol to each well and incubate for at least one hour at −20°C before use.\nPause point: Seal the plates with parafilm and incubate overnight at −20°C. Samples can be left at −20°C in 70% ethanol for months.\nDay 2: Hybridization with fluorescent probes\nTiming: 6–7 h (including a 4 h incubation period)",
    "Cells are hybridized with the fluorescent oligonucleotides, washed, and mounted onto coverslips.\nPrepare:\nPetri dish for coverslips\nLabel the base of the dish with sample names. Each dish can fit four samples.\nCut circles of parafilm such that it fits inside a 10 cm petri dish.\nFold a kimwipe into a small square and dampen it with Milli-Q water. Place the moist kimwipe to the side of the dish, away from samples. This is to maintain humidity and prevent the coverslips from drying out (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nProbe hybridization solution\nThaw aliquots of hybridization buffer (precalculate the number of aliquots needed based on the number of samples and the number of probes—see (ii) for volumes) and probes at 18°C–22°C.\nMake a hybridization solution master mix:\nOne probe: for each sample, mix 52.8 μL of hybridization buffer and 2.2 μL of 2.5 μM of probe\nTwo probes: for each sample, mix 50.6 μL of hybridization buffer + 2.2 μL of 2.5 μM probe1 + 2.2 μL of 2.5 μM probe2\nVortex well and store at 18°C–22°C in the dark until ready to use.\nWash buffer (check materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) at 18°C–22°C\nTake samples from the −20°C and aspirate the ethanol.\nRehydrate the coverslips with 2 mL of wash buffer (at 18°C–22°C) and incubate at 18°C–22°C for 5 min.\nCritical: Perform the following steps without direct light and, when stated, use aluminum foil to prevent the bleaching of the dyes.\nPipet drops of ∼50 μL (for 18 mm coverslip) of probe hybridization solution in the petri dish, on the parafilm (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Avoid air bubbles or remove them by pipetting.",
    "Gently remove the coverslips from the 12-well plate with forceps and position them vertically (letting them rest on the side of a tip box on kimwipes works well—see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) for a few seconds to allow the fluid to naturally accumulate at the base of the coverslip.\nCritical: Do not leave the coverslips to airdry completely as this can dry out the sample.\nQuickly and gently tap off any excess liquid from the coverslips and place cell side DOWN onto the drop of probe mixture on the petri dish. Avoid bubbles. If bubbles are visible below the coverslip, gently tap on the coverslip to remove them (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nSeal the petri dish with parafilm and place in a humid 37°C incubator for 4 h in the dark.\nPause point: (Optional) Hybridization can be continued overnight at 37°C but this may result in increased background fluorescence.\nAt 3.5 h, place wash buffer in 37°C incubator or water bath.\nPlace coverslips into 12-well plates (cell side UP) and add 2 mL of pre-warmed 37°C wash buffer to each well. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 min in the dark.\nAspirate the wash buffer and add another 2 mL of pre-warmed 37°C wash buffer to each well. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 min in the dark.\nDuring the second 30 min incubation period:\nthaw Prolong Gold with DAPI media at 18°C–22°C\nmake 2×SSC by diluting 20×SSC with Milli-Q water 10-fold (2×SSC can be stored at 18°C–22°C and can be reused)\nlabel microscope slides\nAspirate the wash buffer and rinse coverslips with 2×SSC by adding the 2X SSC solution to each well and aspirating it again.",
    "Add 2 mL of 1× PBS to each well and incubate for 5 min at 18°C–22°C (cover plate with foil to avoid photobleaching).\nGently remove the coverslips from the 12-well plate with forceps and position them vertically (tip box on kimwipes works well—see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) to allow the fluid to fall down naturally.\nNote: Do not allow the coverslips to airdry completely and keep them covered with foil.\nFor an 18 mm coverslip, pipet (dispense until first stop) 12–15 μL of Prolong Gold mounting media onto the microscope slide. Using a new pipet tip, pipet off any visible bubbles and gently place coverslip face down on mounting media. Place the slide in the dark once the sample has been mounted.\nCritical: To avoid bubbles, it is crucial to depress the plunger of the pipet to the first stop (and not the second stop!) to dispense the Prolong Gold onto the microscope slide. Additionally, before use, spin the Prolong Gold at 2000 × g for about 5 min before use to force the air bubbles to the surface.\nCover the mounted slides with foil and let them dry on a flat surface at 18°C–22°C for 24 h before imaging.\nNote: after 24 h, the slides can be imaged or can be stored at −20°C for months. Since the smFISH slides are mounted in mounting media, loss of image quality over time is very minimal, in contrast to protocols that rely on antifade buffers (Raj et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Ji and van Oudenaarden, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), which require immediate imaging for good image quality.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. How to hybridize coverslips with fluorescent probes, related to steps 22–27\nDay 3: Imaging\nTiming: 15–60 min per coverslip, depending on number of positions.",
    "Coverslips are imaged and the recommended acquisition settings are outlined\nImage a rectangular region of the coverslip with several fields of view using the image tiling option of your microscope setup, such that a few thousand cells are imaged. Here are the recommended specifications for the imaging equipment:\nMicroscope: Standard wide-field inverted fluorescence microscope (e.g., Zeiss AxioObserver or Nikon TE2000 or Ti)\nNote: Although confocal microscopes offer several advantages, they are not recommended for smFISH imaging because they use high intensities of light, which can rapidly bleach the smFISH signals. Additionally, pinholes in confocal microscopes significantly decrease the amount of light that reaches the detector, and smFISH protocols aim to collect the maximum number of photons emitted by the smFISH probes.\nLight source: We use an LED lamp (Lumencor SpectraX) but a well-aligned laser, a mercury lamp or a metal-halide lamp will also suffice. Using excitation light with a narrow wavelength range (less than 30 nm wide) is recommended as they will have high excitation of the specific signal and limited excitation of autofluorescent sources.",
    "Objective: smFISH signal is difficult to detect due to the intrinsically low signal from each transcript and its sub-diffraction limit size. Therefore, a high numerical objective (NA>=1.3) with a high magnification (50–65×) (i.e., Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.40 Oil with 1.25× or 1.6× optovar) is recommended to ensure optimal optical resolution and section thickness. Since the NA determines the resolving power of the objective, high-NA objectives produce images which are highly resolved and contain more details compared to low-NA objectives. Furthermore, the NA has a significant impact on the optical section thickness and objectives with NA>1 allow for thinner optical sectioning. Additionally, choose a final magnification such that the pixel size is at least 100 nm. For example, for a camera (i.e., sCMOS) with a chip pixel size of 6.5 μm, the final magnification should be approximately 50×–65×. Since magnification decreases the image intensity, it is optimal to use a lower magnification if intensity information is more important for the research question, compared to positional information.\nFilter sets: For each channel, an excitation, dichroic, and emission filters are needed for each fluorophore. Choose the correct filters based on the fluorophores used. To prevent crosstalk between fluorophores, use narrow bandpass filters. For Quasar570 and Quasar670, these filter sets work well (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for additional information):\nFor excitation filters: 395/25 for DAPI, 550/15 for Quasar570 and 640/30 for Quasar670\nFor emission filters: 460/50 for DAPI, 595/50 for Quasar570 and 697/60 for Quasar670.\nFor dichroic mirrors: 350/550 for DAPI, 550/700 for Quasar570 and 550/800 for Quasar670\nNote: We recommend to start imaging from the longest wavelength to the shortest wavelength, as shorter wavelengths result in more photobleaching.",
    "Camera: Novel sCMOS cameras have a high dynamic range and are sensitive enough for low-light level imaging. Several sCMOS cameras have a small pixel size (6.5 μm) and a large field of view (2048 × 2048), which are ideal specifications for imaging large areas. Using an EM-CCD camera is also possible, but although they are more sensitive than sCMOS, the images will have more noise and a lower dynamic range. For optimal resolution, use 1 × 1 binning in the camera settings.\nImaging software: Standard microscope software that allows tiling and z-stacks, such as MicroManager. If tiling is not an option, the alternative is to manually image different positions on the coverslip.\nSet acquisition conditions in imaging software:\nExcitation power and exposure time: for each smFISH signal, it is recommended to use maximum (100%) power. The exposure depends on the light source and can vary between 250 ms and 1000 ms. For the DAPI channel, a low power setting (20%) and a very short exposure time will likely suffice. The user may need to adjust the exposure time to optimize spot detection. Note that longer exposure means better signal detection, but also increased background detection and bleaching, which may actually reduce the signal-to-noise ratio.\nZ-stacks: In order to detect RNA spots throughout the whole cell volume, multiple z-slices need to be acquired. It is recommended to use 300 nm z-steps and collect at least 21 sections to image diploid yeast. During acquisition, image all z-sections in one channel before switching to another channel.\nCritical: All slides from the same experiment should be imaged using the same conditions."
