    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nQuantification of oxygen consumption – day 2\nTiming: ∼3–4 h per run\nThe following steps accomplish isolation of the retinal tissue from treated animals and setting up of the Seahorse assay for determination of oxygen consumption rates of individual retinal punches.\nNote: This protocol is an optimization of previously published protocols (Kooragayala et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Joyal et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Shetty et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Sardar Pasha et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: There are no pause points in this protocol given the nature of the experiments. The whole process needs to be done without breaks due to the fragility of the tissue.\nPreparation of assay medium\nPrepare the assay medium for the retinal punches immediately prior to use by supplementing the Seahorse DMEM (which contains 5 mM HEPES) with 12 mM glucose and 2 mM L-glutamine (Sodium pyruvate between 0.12 - 0.5 mM can be included as an additional fuel source and buffering agent).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_654_2.csv\nPlace 180 μL of freshly prepared assay medium in each well.\nIsolation of retinal tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/654-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Retinal dissection and punch preparation\nLayout of the retinal dissection corresponding to step 2 in the protocol is shown. Incision marks are indicated with a pictorial scissors icon in steps 2b and 2c. After separating the sclera-choroid-RPE layer, the retinal cup is isolated, and four incisions are made. In step 2d, the resulting retinal “flower” is then used to isolate 1 mm sized punches using a biopsy puncher. Regions adjacent to the optic nerve are chosen as displayed.\nEuthanize animals using CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation, or other appropriate methods as approved by institutional guidelines.",
    "Immediately enucleate eyes by placing a pair of forceps directly under the eye socket and plucking gently from the optic nerve head; proceed immediately with dissection of the posterior cup.\nSeparate the cornea and lens from the posterior segment of the eye. Pull the scleral layer away from the neural retina gently and isolate the retinal cup devoid of retinal pigment epithelium layer.\nFlatten the retinal cup into a “flower” with four incisions from the periphery towards the optic nerve head. Cut disks of 1 mm diameter using a biopsy puncher (e.g., Miltex) carefully without disintegrating individual retinal layers. Isolate retinal punches from regions adjacent to the optic nerve head in all eyes to maintain homogeneity among the different retinal layers. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCritical: Only use intact punched disks for the experiment; discard any pieces that appear sheared or fragmented. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPlace each disk in one well with the ganglion cell layer facing upward. For experimental design, a maximum of three different conditions can be set up in a single XFp miniplate using two punches per condition (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for diagram). Always use duplicates to account for technical errors and variability.\nIncubate retinal punches in assay medium for ∼ 45 min to 1 h in a room air tissue culture incubator at 37°C to equilibrate CO2 levels between tissue and medium.\nCritical: Do not skip step 2f: it is critical for CO2 levels to equalize between the tissue and the assay medium prior to assay.",
    "Note: If placement of retinal discs on the bottom of the miniplate proves difficult, tissue adhesive (e.g., Cell-Tak, Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) can be coated on the plates before placing the tissue. Such adhesives can introduce random folding of the tissue pieces. Care should be taken to avoid interference with sensor probes while using the adsorption method to incorporate Cell-Tak.\nPreparation and loading of injection compounds in sensor cartridge\nResuspend FCCP and rotenone/antimycin mixture provided in the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress test kit in the assay medium as directed by the manufacturer.\nUse 0.5 μM final well concentration of FCCP and inject the respective volume (22 μL) in port B of the sensor cartridge.\nSimilarly, use 0.5 μM final well concentration of rotenone/antimycin A mixture and inject the compound in port C of the cartridge.\nNote: Skip the manufacturer’s recommended oligomycin injection due to high toxicity (Kooragayala et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) observed for use with retinal punches.\nRun the assay on the Seahorse XFp instrument. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nSet up the assay program in the instrument or by creating a program template in Wave software by selecting a cycle of mix (3 min), wait (2 min), and measure (5 min) conditions.\nTake five measurements of basal respiration, followed by four measurements after the addition of the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP, and four final measurements following the administration of rotenone/antimycin A mixture.\nPlace the loaded sensor cartridge and allow calibration of the plate (approximately 20 min) followed by OCR measurements as designed in step 4b.",
    "Critical: Calibration of the hydrated sensor cartridges takes approximately 20 mins on the XFp (time may vary depending on the type of Seahorse equipment). This should be considered while incubating the retinal tissue in the room air incubator for 1 h to avoid over-incubating the tissue and causing nutrient deprivation.\nCritical: Do not reduce the number of cycles of measurements after FCCP addition (for maximal respiration output). If needed, the number of cycles can be increased to capture the OCR spike expected after FCCP injection. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nOptional: To reduce total run time of the assay, measurements can be reduced to four and three for basal respiration and rotenone/antimycin A injections respectively."
