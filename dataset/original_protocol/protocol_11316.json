    "All methods described in these animal studies were conducted under the approved guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Ochsner Health System and in accordance with animal research guidelines. All patient tumors for this study were collected from consented patients undergoing cancer resection surgeries in accordance with the Ochsner Health System Investigative Review Board and the ethical standards of the Institutional Committee on Human Experimentation. Board-certified pathologists at Ochsner Health System determined the pathological diagnoses of patient specimens based on the microscopic features of tumor cells, their histological type, and grade level.\nNOTE: The following protocol describes the steps for two separate xenograft models, a UCC model via the electrocauterization of the bladder wall to instill UCC cells and an intrarectal injection of CRC cells for study in a CRC model. All steps preparing for and monitoring the experiments are identical for both models, while sections 7 and 8 specifically describe the procedure for UCC instillation and CRC injection, respectively.\n1. Culturing cell lines\nGrow HK cells in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 nM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin G, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\n\tNOTE: HK cells are normal human follicular dendritic cells and can be grown and expanded for ≤ 15 passages in vitro16.\nTo prepare for an experiment, trypsinize the cells.\n\t\nRemove media and add 2 mL of 1% trypsin in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) to cells. Place cells back in the 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C for 4 min.\nCollect cells from dish into a 15 mL tube using a handheld pipet aid with a 10 mL serological pipet attached. Add 8 mL of complete RPMI-1640 medium.",
    "Combine 40 µL of cells and 40 µL of trypan blue in a single well of a 96 well plate. Add 10 µL of mixture to a hemocytometer and count live cells. Add 1 million cells in 25 mL complete RPMI-1640 medium to a 150 mm sterile tissue culture-treated dish to continue growing the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: HK cell suspension prepared in this step must be used within an hour to mix with tumor cells for injection.\n2. Patient specimen collection\nCollect the UCC tumors from consented patient 15 (BlCaPt15, pT3b N1 M0) and 37 (BlCaPt37, pT3b pN0 M0) at resection surgery.\nCollect CRC tumors from consented patient 155 (CoCaPt155, T1 N0 M0) and 302 (CoCaPt302, T1 N0 M0) at resection surgery.\n3. Expansion of patient tumor\nCollect tumors at surgery in cold sterile McCoy’s medium containing penicillin G (500 U/mL) and streptomycin (500 mg/mL).\nImplant tumors directly into the left and right flank of 6−8 week old female NOD/SCID mice.\n\t\nMechanically mince tissues into small pieces (~1 mm3) using small surgical scissors.\nImplant tissue subcutaneously to the left and right flank using 13 G bone marrow aspiration biopsy needles.\n\t\tNOTE: Implant a total volume of 8 mm3 divided evenly to both sides of flank.\n4. Tagging and enrichment of luciferase labeled tumors\nMeasure tumor growth bi-weekly using a digital caliper.\nAt 1 cm in diameter, transduce tumor. Directly inject into tumor with single dose of Luc/red fluorescent protein (RFP)-lentivirus (50 µL/tumor, 1:30 dilution from concentrated high titer lentivirus stock) using a 1 cc syringe with a 27 G needle.\n\tNOTE: The patient tumor typically reaches 1 cm in diameter in 1−2 months. However, the growth rate is extremely variable and based on a number of factors including tumor grade and type.",
    "Monitor tumor weekly by bioluminescent imaging (BLI) in live animals.\n\t\nWeigh the mice. Inject conscious mouse with 150 mg/kg luciferin intraperitoneally and wait 5 min for the substrate to circulate in the mouse’s body.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 2.5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen, 1 L/min in an induction chamber.\nPlace mouse on stomach in a BLI imaging machine with isoflurane flowing and image. Take sequential images to confirm the presence of Luc/RFP positive tumor regions (false-color bio-luminescent image). Return mouse to cage after imaging is complete.\n5. Select appropriate portion of tumor for enzymatic digestion\nOn the day of UCC or CRC procedure, image mouse with luciferase tagged tumor as in steps 4.3.1−4.3.3.\n\tNOTE: The length of time for the subcutaneous tumor to grow depends on the speed of tumor growth and the planned number of animals to be injected in the experiment.\nHarvest tumor from mouse flank and image.\n\t\nEuthanize mouse by CO2 inhalation after imaging. Place mouse in the CO2 chamber, turn on gas at 1.4 L/min until respiratory arrest and leave on for 3 min. Follow this with cervical dislocation.\nClean skin with 70% ethanol. Tent skin directly above tumor. With surgical scissors make a small incision in skin. Separate skin from tumor with scissors.\nRemove tumor and place in a sterile petri-dish. Image entire dish in an imaging machine.\nUse sterile scissors or scalpel to separate luciferase-negative sections from luciferase positive sections in the tumor and re-image.\nRepeat until only most highly positive tumor pieces remain.\n6. Enzymatic digestion of tumor\nUnder laminar flow hood, mince luciferase positive tumor pieces (step 5.4) into the smallest possible pieces using sterile surgical scissors and put them into a sterile 50 mL conical tube.\n\tNOTE: Mincing the tumor into the smallest possible pieces will yield more individual cells.",
    "Prepare digest solution by adding 10 mL of collagenase IV (1.5 mg/mL), 80 µL of hyaluronidase (20 mg/mL), and 160 µL of deoxyribonuclease I (0.1 mg/mL) to 40 mL of HBSS. Mix solution by inverting.\nAdd 35−40 mL of the digest solution to minced tumor. Incubate at 37 °C with continuous rotation for 2 h.\n\tNOTE: Vigorously shake tube periodically throughout incubation to prevent tumor tissue from clumping.\nFilter entire digestion through sterile 100 µm cell strainer followed by a 40 µm cell strainer to remove debris. Save the flow through and discard debris.\nWash free cells by adding 20 mL of HBSS and centrifuge at 329 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 30 mL of HBSS.\nCombine 10 µL of cell solution and 90 µL of trypan blue in a single well of a 96 well plate. Count live cells using a hemacytometer.\nTransfer 1 x 104 to 1 x 106 tumor cells per mouse to a sterile 15 mL conical tube. Add 3 x 105 HK cells from step 1.2.3 per mouse, to the same tube with tumor cells.\n\tNOTE: Use sterile 50 mL conical tube if the total volume exceeds 15 mL. Always calculate more doses for additional animals per study group to account for loss of fluid during syringe use. For example, if a group contains 5 mice, make enough cells for 6 or 7 mice.\nCentrifuge at 329 x g for 5 min. Discard supernatant either by aspirating or pipetting.\nResuspend cells in 50 µL per mouse for UCC model or 10 µL per mouse for CRC model in complete RPMI media. Keep cell suspension on ice until ready for use.\n7. UCC mouse model\nPreparation of mice for procedure",
    "Obtain six- to eight-week old female NOD/SCID mouse. Shave the lower backs of the mouse using hair removal cream. Anesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber with isoflurane (2.5% in 100% oxygen, 1 L/min).\nOnce sedated, place mouse in supine position with its snout in an isoflurane nose cone and bare back firmly grounded on a dispersive electrode.\n\t\tNOTE: Mouse is completely sedated if unresponsive to toe pinch.\nInstill UCC cells prepared in step 6.9 to bladder using an angiocatheter (Figure 1Aa,Ab).\n\t\nSet up a monopolar electrocautery machine and set to a power of 4 W. Lubricate a 24 G sterile angiocatheter with lubricating jelly and insert through urethra of the female mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: Slight resistance may be felt. Gently push forward or remove angiocatheter and repeat. Do not force. If catheter bends on entry, insert a sterile guide wire (see 7.2.2) halfway into catheter to provide stability.\nFully insert the 0.025” fixed core straight guide wire 1 mm past the end of the angiocatheter.\n\t\tNOTE: The wire is marked with tape prior to the procedure to indicate the 1 mm stopping point and insure consistency.\nHold the monopolar pin to the guide wire for 1 s allowing for electrical irritation of the bladder mucosa.\nAttach a fresh sterile angiocatheter to 1 cc luer-lok syringe and draw up 200 µL of collected cells from step 6.9.\n\t\tNOTE: At least 100 µL is lost from the angiocatheter to the syringe. Compensate for loss volume when calculating volume of cell suspension needed.\nRemove guide wire and angiocatheter from mouse urethra. Insert angiocatheter with syringe of cells attached into urethra.\n\t\tNOTE: Advancement should be easier than before.\nInstill 50 µL of cells to mouse bladder. Wait a few seconds before removing the angiocatheter to allow for cells to adhere to the bladder wall.",
    "NOTE: Cells remain in the bladder and develop into a primary tumor.\nRemove mouse from isoflurane nose cone and grounding pad. Observe mouse for 1 h following procedure. Look for signs of distress, i.e., hunched back, labored breathing, etc.\n8. CRC mouse model\nAnesthetize six-to-eight-week old male NOD/SCID mouse with isoflurane (2.5% in 100% oxygen, 1 L/min) in the induction chamber. Confirm sedation with a toe pinch.\nPlace anesthetized mouse in supine position under a dissecting microscope, making sure to secure their snout to an isoflurane nosecone and to secure their front limbs with tape for stability.\n\tNOTE: Loupes may be used instead of a dissecting microscope. A small object can be used to improve visibility and angle when placed under the base of the tail, elevating the anus. Typically, small sections of gauze are rolled into a cylinder shape of 1-inch diameter.\nDilate the anal canal with curved lubricated blunt-tipped forceps to expose the distal anal and rectal mucosa. Remove feces.\nUse a sterile 30 G removable needle on a 50 μL glass syringe to inject 10 μL of tumor and HK cells (from step 6.9) into the distal posterior rectal submucosa 1 to 2 mm above the anal canal. The bevel of the needle should be covered by mucosa. Be careful not to pass into the pelvic cavity.\nRemove mouse from isoflurane nose cone. Observe mouse for 1 h following procedure. Look for signs of distress, i.e., hunched back, labored breathing, etc.\n9. Bioluminescent imaging\nMonitor the primary tumor, liver, and lung metastatic burden weekly using a bioluminescent imaging system for luciferase activity.\n\t\nObtain a mouse from UCC or CRC experiment and weigh. Inject 150 mg/kg luciferin intraperitoneally and wait 5 min for the substrate to circulate in the mouse’s body.",
    "Anesthetize mouse with 2.5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen, 1 L/min in the induction chamber.\nPlace mouse in BLI Imaging machine with nose fixed in nosecone. When exposing for the image, make sure that the area of interest is facing the camera. For UCC and CRC injection, the ventral side should face the camera for each image. Image mouse in supine position.\n10. Harvesting organs and tumor\nWhen the primary tumor luminescence radiance reaches 1 x 1011 photons or if mice exhibit signs of distress (i.e., weight loss, hunched back, harsh/labored breathing, etc.), euthanize mice by CO2 inhalation (as in step 5.2.1) after luciferin injection and whole-body imaging.\nRemove liver and lung, place in a petri dish and image to identify any metastases. Remove tumor, weigh and image. Fix organs and tumor in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h at ambient temperature.\n\tNOTE: Clean/wipe scissors and forceps between each organ to avoid transfer of tissue.\n11. Histological evaluation\nEmbed formalin fixed tissues in paraffin and slice the tissues at 5 µm thickness on a microtome for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.\n\tNOTE: All H&E staining of paraffin slides was done in the pathology laboratory of Ochsner Health System, and all IHC staining in this paper was performed in a research laboratory of Ochsner Health System after high-temperature antigen retrieval using Ki67 and cytokeratin 20 antibodies, followed by biotinylated secondary antibody, and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complexes according to manufacturer instructions13,17.\nSubscription Required.
