    "All of the procedures presented here conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Animal Welfare and Human Studies Committee at Shanghai Children's Medical Center (SCMC-LAWEC-2023-003). C57BL/6 mice pups (P7, males, 3-4 g) were used for the present study. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials). The mice pups and their nursing mothers (pups:mothers = 6:1 in a single cage) were kept under specific-pathogen-free laboratory conditions under a 12 h light and dark cycle at 22 ± 2 °C with free access to water and a nutritional diet. The pups were randomized into two groups: a VO group and a sham-operated (sham) group.\n1. Equipment and surgical tool preparation\nNOTE: The commercial details of all the materials/equipment are listed in the Table of Materials.\nEnsure that the following types of equipment are ready and properly functioning: operating table (foam plastic panel), inhalational anesthesia machine, microscope with vertical illumination and a built-in camera, ultrasound device with a 24 MHz transducer, and thermostatic heating platform.\nSterilize the surgical instruments (i.e., a micro-needle holder, fine-tip forceps, and round-handled Vannas spring scissors).\nAssemble the following consumables: 11-0 and 9-0 surgical suture needles (taper-point) with thread, tape strips, 5 mL syringe needles, 2-0 silk (surgical fixation), sterile cotton swabs, and ultrasound gel.\nEnsure the following reagents are present: Betadine, 70% ethanol, normal sterile saline, isoflurane, acetaminophen, ophthalmic ointment, and hair removal cream.\n2. Surgical procedure\nNOTE: The fistula surgery procedure was modified according to the previously described method11. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the AVF operation in postnatal mice.\nAnesthesia and restraint",
    "Place the mice pups into an anesthesia-induction box supplied with 2% isoflurane/oxygen for 2 min with the flow set to 1 L/min. Administer acetaminophen (0.1 ml PO of 80 mg/2.5 ml) using a TB syringe.\nPlace the pups in a supine position on the operating table with nasal inhalation of 1.5% isoflurane with a 0.8 L/min flow to maintain anesthesia. Adjust the pup's position by tying the legs to the fixed syringe needles. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the pups' eyes to prevent corneal desiccation.\nPinch the anesthetized pup's tail to check its pain responsiveness; no obvious body movements indicate adequate anesthesia.\nFistula surgery\n\t\nDisinfect the skin with three alternating scrubs of betadine and 70% ethanol, and then drape the surgical site. Cut the abdominal wall and peritoneum from the lower abdomen to the subxiphoid to fully expose the peritoneal cavity, taking care not to injure the abdominal organs. Drip normal sterile saline to moisten externalized organs.\nGently pull the gastrointestinal tract and bladder away from the surgical site using cotton swabs to visualize the vertical abdominal aorta (AA) and inferior vena cava (IVC) under the retroperitoneum. Rotate the operating table 90° counterclockwise and adjust the microscope magnification to visualize the two horizontal vessels clearly.\nPuncture the fistula from the AA into the IVC in an oblique direction 1 cm distal to the renal artery with an 11-0 suture needle (diameter = 0.07 mm). Verify successful fistula creation based on the swelling and mixing of venous and arterial blood in the IVC.\nNext, rapidly compress the bleeding point using an appropriate force applied with dry cotton swabs for 15 s. Replace the stomach, intestines, and bladder in the abdominal cavity as soon as possible to promote hemostatic compression.",
    "Suture the abdominal wall and peritoneum with a blanket stitch using a 9-0 suture thread. Discontinue anesthesia and provide the pups with 100% oxygen for 1 min.\nAnesthesia resuscitation\n\t\nPlace the pups on a 38 °C heating platform. After a complete awakening with vitality, return the pups to their nursing mother. The entire procedure lasts approximately 15 min.\n\t\t​NOTE: In the present study, the sham group undergoes the same procedure except for the puncturing step.\n3. Ultrasound confirmation of fistula\nNOTE: The general operation of the ultrasound device was identical to previous reports18,19.\nConfirmation of fistula by abdominal ultrasound\n\t\nAfter induction of anesthesia (step 2.1.1), fix the mice with tape strips in the supine position on the warm platform. Then, connect the mice to an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor with ultrasound gel. Maintain anesthesia using 1.5% isoflurane at a 0.8 L/min flow.\nPrepare the chest and abdominal skin using hair removal cream. After a few seconds, remove the cream with a warm water-soaked cotton tip. Place the transducer (24 MHz) on the midabdominal line and rotate the transducer marker to the head of the mice.\nMove the platform down to the left or right side of the mice and use B-mode and color Doppler mode to visualize the long-axis view of the vessels and blood signals18,19. Measure the blood flow velocity of the AA, IVC, and fistula to confirm AVF patency through pulsed wave Doppler mode.",
    "NOTE: Successful fistula creation on the ultrasound was indicated by a turbulent flow signal visible between the AA and IVC (Figure 2C). Doppler blood flow velocity at the AVF site was significantly elevated compared with a relatively lower systolic velocity in the AA (Figure 2A,C). Moreover, in contrast with normal flow patterns in the IVC (Figure 2B), the pulsatile waveform of IVC blood flow proximal to the AVF also confirmed the successful creation of the fistula (Figure 2D).\nConfirmation of VO by echocardiography\n\t\nMove the tail-end part of the platform downward, place the transducer (24 MHz) on the chest, and rotate the transducer marker to the right shoulder of the mice. Visualize the modified parasternal long-axis view of the pulmonary artery (PA) using B-mode and color Doppler mode.\nUsing pulsed wave Doppler mode, measure blood flow signals in the PA, including the velocity time integral (PA-VTI), diameter of the PA valve (PAD), pulmonary arterial acceleration time (PAT), and RV ejection time (RVET) (Figure 2E,F and Figure 3A,B).\nMeasure the ultrasound parameters from the mean of three consecutive measurements. Calculate the RV stroke volume (RVSV, mL) and RV systolic pressure (RVSP, mmHg) using the following formulas20:\n\t\tRVSV [mL] =1/4 × πD2 × VTIPA\n\t\tRVSP [mmHg] = -83.7 × PAT/RVET - index + 63.7\n\t\tNOTE: Considering the ultrasound measurement bias, an increase of >15% in the RVSV or VTIPA in VO mice compared to mice in the sham group was considered VO in the RV (Figure 2E,F).\nSubscription Required.
