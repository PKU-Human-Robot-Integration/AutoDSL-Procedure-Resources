    "Plant growth For individual experimental setup, we recommend plants to be grown according to your usual procedure. Pots with the various genotypes (3–4 pots, each with five plants per genotype) should be randomised, placed in the same tray, and grown together under the same conditions. As an example, the procedure to enable comparative pectin analysis on alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR) derived from leaves, as used in Guzha et al. (2022), is shown below.Prepare semi-sterile soil by heating it in the oven for 8 h at 80 °C.Transfer soil to 10 cm pots, water, and place 6–10 Arabidopsis seeds in the four corners and the centre of the pots. Cover with plastic dome.After stratification at 4 °C for two days, transfer to growth cabinet with short-day conditions (8 h light and 16 h darkness) at 22 °C, a relative humidity of 65%, and a light intensity of 120–140 μmol m-2·s-1. Remove the plastic dome after 3–4 days.Grow plants for 7–10 days, then thin out excess seedlings to leave five plants per pot (one plant per position).Grow until plants reach the desired growth stage depending on your experimental setup, e.g., 6-week-old plants for analysis of leaf AIR.A detailed description on plant growth and seed harvest for mucilage analysis is given in Dean et al. (2019) (see General note 1).Preparation of alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) The method used in this part of the protocol is adapted from Bethke et al. (2016) and involves the following steps:Flash-freeze the organs of interest (leaves, stems, roots, whole rosettes) in liquid nitrogen. Soil debris attached to roots or stems can be gently washed off using sterile distilled Milli-Q water.Note: To minimise starch contamination, leaf samples can be harvested after keeping the plants in the dark for 48 h, if the experimental setup allows (see General note 2).",
    "Grind the frozen plant material using mortar and pestle or a ball mill. Keep the plant material frozen throughout grinding and make sure that the plant material is ground as fine as possible to minimize non–cell wall contamination. Pause point:  The ground plant material can be stored at -80 °C.Transfer up to 100 mg of ground plant material in a pre-cooled 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Keep samples cooled before the addition of ethanol in the next step.Add 1.5 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol and vortex thoroughly.Centrifuge at 18,000× g for 10 min at room temperature and remove supernatant.Repeat steps B4 and B5 as described above.Add 1 mL of the solvent mixture chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) and vortex thoroughly. Caution:  Work with chloroform-containing solutions under a fume hood.Centrifuge at 18,000× g for 10 min at room temperature and remove supernatant. Caution:  Removal of the chloroform-containing solution should be carried out under a fume hood.Repeat steps B7 and B8 two times as described above. After the final washing step, the plant material should have a grey to off-white colour, as all chlorophyll-containing fractions have been removed. Carry out additional washes with chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) if the plant material is still green.Add 1 mL of acetone to the plant material and vortex thoroughly.Centrifuge at 18,000× g for 10 min at room temperature and remove supernatant.Air dry the resulting AIR at room temperature overnight. Keep samples in a dust-free environment to avoid contamination while drying.To avoid starch contamination, it is possible to carry out an α-amylase digest (see General note 2).Extraction and hydrolysis of pectin Pectin analysis from AIRPrepare at least four replicates for each genotype or growth condition. Weigh 2 mg of AIR for each replicate and place in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Record the exact weight of AIR placed in the microcentrifuge tube. Use AIR from plants grown at the same time and under the same conditions.Add 1.4 mL of water to the AIR.Add two glass beads (5 mm diameter) and homogenise AIR further with a ball mill for 1.5 min at 30 Hz.Incubate samples for 2 h at 90 °C under constant vigorous shaking (speed #4 on HLC HTM 130).Remove samples from heating block and allow the debris to settle for 5 min. Do not centrifuge the samples.Transfer 1 mL of the supernatant to a DURAN® glass culture tube with screw cap.Dry the samples under a stream of N2 gas at 50 °C.Note: The drying step might take a while due to the aqueous nature of the sample. Add 300 μL of 2 M TFA to the dried samples. Caution:  TFA is corrosive and attacks skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Wear chemical-resistant gloves and safety goggles and work with TFA only under a fume hood.Hydrolyse the samples for 1 h at 121 °C in a heating block for DURAN glass tubes.After hydrolysis, evaporate the TFA under N2 stream.Add 500 μL of water and 100 μL of the internal standard 0.05 mg/mL allo-inositol to the dried hydrolysis products. Pause point:  For long-term storage, dissolved hydrolysis products can be kept at -20 °C for several months.Sample preparation for subsequent measurements: dry 20 μL of the dissolved hydrolysis products under a stream of N2 gas.Derivatise the dried samples with 15 μL of MOX (30 mg/mL in anhydrous pyridine) at room temperature overnight. Use freshly prepared MOX (see General note 3). Wear chemical-resistant gloves and work with pyridine and MOX solution only under a fume hood. Use solvent-resistant tips for pipetting.",
    "After overnight derivatisation, add 30 μL of MSTFA and measure by GC–MS after at least 1 h incubation time at room temperature. Incubation time with MSTFA before GC–MS analysis should not exceed 6 h.Pectin analysis from mucilagePrepare at least four replicates of each genotype. Weigh 5 mg of seeds for each replicate and transfer them to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Record the exact mass of prepared seeds.Add 1.4 mL of water to the seeds and vortex for a few seconds.Place samples on a rotary shaker for 2 h to extract mucilage.Remove the samples from the shaker and allow the seeds to settle for 1–2 min. Do not centrifuge the samples.Transfer 1 mL of the supernatant to a DURAN glass tube.Dry the samples under a stream of N2 gas at 50 °C.Note: The drying step might take a while due to the aqueous nature of the sample. Add 300 μL of 2 M TFA to the dried samples.Caution:  TFA is corrosive and attacks skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Wear chemical-resistant gloves and safety goggles and work with TFA only under a fume hood.Hydrolyse the samples for 1 h at 121 °C in a heating block for DURAN glass tubes.After hydrolysis, evaporate the TFA under N2 stream.Add 500 μL of water and 100 μL of the internal standard 0.05 mg/mL allo-inositol to the dried hydrolysis products.Pause point:  For long-term storage, dissolved hydrolysis products can be kept at -20 °C for several months.Sample preparation for subsequent measurements: dry 20 μL of the dissolved hydrolysis products under a stream of N2 gas.Derivatise the dried samples with 15 μL of MOX (30 mg/mL in anhydrous pyridine) at room temperature overnight. Use freshly prepared MOX (see Notes). Wear chemical-resistant gloves and work with pyridine and MOX solution only under a fume hood.",
    "Use solvent-resistant tips for pipetting.After overnight derivatisation, add 30 μL of MSTFA and measure by GC–MS after at least 1 h incubation time at room temperature. Incubation time with MSTFA before GC–MS analysis should not exceed 6 h.GC–MS analysis Preparation of standards for calibrationFrom the stock solutions of the monosaccharides, prepare standard combinations of defined molar amounts by combining aliquots of dilutions from the respective stock solutions with the correct volume. (For example, for a mix of 1 nmol arabinose and 1 nmol galactose, combine 4 μL each of 1/1,000 dilutions of the stock solutions of arabinose and galactose.) Add 5 μL of 0.05 mg/mL allo-inositol.For less abundant pectic monosaccharides, prepare 3–5 different molar amount samples in the range of 1–5 nmol. For highly abundant pectic monosaccharides, prepare 3–5 different molar amount samples in the range of 20–100 nmol. Low or high abundance of the various monosaccharides depends on the sample; galacturonic acid will generally be highly abundant, whereas rhamnose is expected to be highly abundant in seed mucilage but less abundant in AIR from leaves. If the sample composition is unclear, it might be helpful to compare initial GC–MS results of a low and a high concentration of each standard with the sample result and then adjust the concentrations accordingly. You can combine different monosaccharide standards in the following combinations:1. Xylose, fucose, mannose2. Arabinose, galactose3. Glucose, glucuronic acid4. Rhamnose, galacturonic acidPrepare all standard combinations and different molar amounts in triplicates.Dry the prepared standard solutions under a stream of N2 gas.Derivatise the dried standards with 15 μL of MOX (30 mg/mL in anhydrous pyridine) at room temperature overnight. Use freshly prepared MOX solution (see General note 3). Wear chemical-resistant gloves and work with pyridine and MOX solution only under a fume hood. Use solvent-resistant tips for pipetting.",
    "After overnight derivatisation, add 30 μL of MSTFA and analyse on GC–MS after at least 1 h incubation time. Incubation time with MSTFA before GC–MS analysis should not exceed 6 h.Monosaccharide analysis with GC-MSInject 1 μL of the derivatised sample with a split value of 10. Helium is used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.Use the following temperature gradient: 150 °C for 2 min, ramp to 250 °C at 5 K/min (20 min), ramp to 320 °C at 15 K/min (4.67 min), 320 °C for 3 min. The inlet temperature is set to 250 °C.The transfer line temperature is set at 280 °C; ionisation is done with an electron energy of 70 eV and an ion source temperature of 230 °C. Mass spectra are recorded in an m/z range of 40–500.Data processing and peak integrationPerform peak assignment and integration according to your usual procedure. Here, we describe exemplarily data processing and peak integration with MSD ChemStation Data Analysis.Define compound list for the individual monosaccharides in the software MSD ChemStation Data Analysis. Use the GC–MS runs of the standards to determine retention times and characteristic fragment ions of the individual monosaccharides. Include the internal standard allo-inositol as additional compound.Note: For most monosaccharides, two peaks will be detected (Figure 1), as derivatisation with MOX yields two stereoisomers (compare retention indices in Table 1). For quantification, select the analyte peak without interference from other monosaccharide-derived analyte peaks. If there is no interference for any analyte peak of an individual monosaccharide, select the largest one. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4746/bioprotoc-13-16-4746-g001.jpgFigure 1. Example of the GC–MS chromatogram of monosaccharides from mucilage pectin as observed with MSD ChemStation Data Analysis. The vertical axis shows detected signals, while the horizontal axis shows the retention time in minutes after injection. allo-Inositol was used as internal standard (4).",
    "Fucose and glucuronic acid were not detected in this sample; the respective analyte peaks would have retention times of ca. 8.9 and 9.1 min for fucose, and 12.8 and 13.6 min for glucuronic acid. The peak at 9.1 min does not have the correct mass spectrum when compared with an external fucose standard.Table 1. GC–MS detection of individual monosaccharides. Possible target ions for quantification and the device-independent retention index are given in the middle columns. As an example, the retention times of the different monosaccharides as shown in Figure 1 are also given. Monosaccharide peaks that could not be detected in the respective sample are denoted as n.d.table:",
