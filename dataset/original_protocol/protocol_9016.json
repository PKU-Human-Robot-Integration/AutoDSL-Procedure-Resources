    "Part 1: RNAi-mediated double gene knockdown\n1. dsRNA Synthesis\nDesign primers of dsRNAs targeting vg, usp and a control gene encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP) which is not in the honey bee genome: primers were designed using online free software Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/[href=http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/]).\ndsRNA synthesis for vg, usp and GFP: use RiboMax T7 RNA production system from Promega for in vitro transcription.\ndsRNA purification:\n\t\nDenaturation and renaturation: heat the dsRNA to 85 °C for 5 min and let it cool down at room temperature for 1 hr.\nDNase I treatment: add 1 μl DNase I into each dsRNA reaction and mix them by flicking the tubes. Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 150 μl nuclease-free water and 750 μl TRizol - LS into each reaction, and gently mix them by inverting the tube. Incubate the samples for 5 min at 30 °C.\nAdd 200 μl chloroform into each sample. Mix vigorously for 20 sec. Centrifuge the samples for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant phase to each new tube and add 500 μl isopropyl alcohol into each tube. Mix them by inverting the tube. Incubate the mixture for 20 min at -20 °C. Centrifuge it for 10 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and use 1,000 μl 75% ethanol to wash the pellet. After centrifuging the tube for 5 min at 7,500 x g at 4 °C, air dry the dsRNA pellet, and use nuclease free water to dissolve the pellet. In order to ensure the efficacy of gene down-regulation, the dsRNA concentration should be around 9 -10 μg/μl.\n2. dsRNA Abdominal Injection",
    "For double gene knockdown, there are two strategies: 1) single injection: mix dsRNA of two genes and inject the mixture; 2) two-day injection: inject the first dsRNA targeting one gene on the first day, and inject the second dsRNA into the same bees on the second day.\nChill newly emerged bees in a 4 °C refrigerator for 1-2 min. When the bees are immobilized, mount 3-4 bees in parallel on Petri dishes full of solid wax with insect pins crossed between their abdomens and thoraces.\nChill the bees again in a 4 °C refrigerator. Ensure the bees are completely immobile. It takes about 1-2 min. The bees should look loose. If the bees become curled or contorted, it means they are chilled too long which should be avoided. Chilling too much causes high mortality, but complete immobilization is important as any movement increases the size of the wound and mortality.\nPut a disposable 30 G needle (BD) on a Hamilton micro syringe. Take 3 μl dsRNA and make sure there is no air bubble in the syringe. The needle is inserted to a side of the abdomen to avoid damaging internal organs. Press the syringe plunger slowly to allow the dsRNA to be absorbed. Since dsRNA is very viscous, it takes 2-3 sec to be completely expelled from the syringe. After completely pushing down the plunger, leave the needle in the wound for 4-5 sec. Observe bees for 3-5 sec after injections. If a hemolymph droplet leaks from the wound, discard the bee.",
    "Use different colors to mark their thoraces corresponding to different treatments. At this point if the single injection strategy was used, the bees can be placed back into a colony after 1 hr observation. However, if the two-day injection strategy was used, after being injected with the first dsRNA, the bees should be placed in a cylinder mesh cage with honey supplied on the side and be kept in an incubator at 34 °C and 80% humidity.\nOn the second day, follow steps 2.2 and 2.3 to chill the bees in the mesh cages and mount them on wax plates. Perform injections with the second dsRNA as it is described in step 2.4.\nLet the bees recover at room temperature for 1 hr and introduce them into a colony.\nNote: Knockdown effects can be detected by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. In general, knockdown efficacy varies and depends on many factors. In our study, the double gene knockdown can be detected 7 days after single injections and two-day injections.\nPart 2: Proboscis extension response (PER) assay\n1. Collecting Bees from the Hive\nOn day 6 after the injections, collect treated bees from the colony without using a smoker. Collect bees in metal mesh cylinder cages. Keep 3 bees in each cage.\n2. Mounting Bees for PER",
    "Chill the bees at 4 °C until they are completely immobilized. Mount each bee vertically into a plastic tube specially designed for PER. Keep the abdomen inside the tube by using two small pieces of tape, and keep the head sticking out of the tube. Put the tubes on a rack with two rows of small plastic columns, and assign each tube (bee) with an ID number. Then put treated bees on the racks into an incubator (34 °C and 80% humidity) and keep them in the incubator for 2 hr.\n3. Preparing a Series of Sucrose Water Solutions\nPrepare 0%, 0.1%, 0.3%, 1%, 3%, 10% and 30% sucrose water solutions and load the solutions into syringes with 15-20 G needles.\n4. PER Assay\nTouch the bee's antenna with a droplet of 0% solution (water) followed by 0.1%, 0.3%, 1%, 3%, 10% and 30% sucrose water solutions. Test all bees with water first and allow at least two minutes as the interval between each solution is used. Therefore, we usually have at least 20 bees for each trial. If a bee fully extends her proboscis, a positive response is counted.\n5. Data Management\nSum up the total positive responses for each individual for gustatory response score (GRS). Perform an appropriate statistical analysis on the data.\nPart 3. Gene knockdown validation",
    "Fat bodies are dissected from another set of 7-day old treated bees. A standard TRizol procedure is used for RNA extraction, which is followed by DNase I treatment 24. Vg and usp gene expression is analyzed by a two-step qRT-PCR. Actin is used as a reference gene since it has stable expressions in different tissues of honey bees. Published real-time PCR primers for vg and usp gene are used in this experiment 24. Data are analyzed by using Delta-Delta CT method 25.Subscription Required.
