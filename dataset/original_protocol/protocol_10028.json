    "1. Cell culture and the production of cell-conditioned medium\nGenerally, cultivate cells under the individual conditions required for the respective cell line.\nCultivate the cells for 24-72 h in serum-free conditions or in medium containing EV-depleted fetal bovine serum (FBS).\n\tNOTE: If EV-depleted FBS is used, employ a method proven to efficiently deplete the serum, to prevent contamination with bovine serum-derived EVs26.\nCollect the medium from the flasks. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min to pellet the cells. Carefully collect the cell-conditioned medium (CCM), without disturbing the pelleted cells. Preferably, use the CCM directly, or store it overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: It is always preferable to use freshly produced CCM. If storage for longer time periods cannot be circumvented, all relevant parameters should be recorded in accordance with MISEV2018 guidelines26, and the potential biases of the results acquired need to be taken into consideration.\nExample protocol for HUVECs\n\t\nCultivate HUVEC cells for 120 h in EGM-2 medium containing FBS and other supplements.\nCultivate HUVEC cells for 48 h in EBM-2 basal medium free of any additional supplements.\nCollect the medium from the flasks and perform the centrifugation step as indicated above (step 1.3). Typically, use 100 mL of medium for one EV-isolation.\n2. Ultracentrifugation of CCM\nImmediately before ultracentrifugation (UC), centrifuge the CCM for 15 min at 3,000 x g and 4 °C to remove cell debris and large agglomerates.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant to the UC tubes. If using a fixed angle rotor, mark the orientation of the tubes in the centrifuge to facilitate the retrieval of the EV pellet after the UC. Centrifuge for 2 h at 120,000 x g, with a k-factor of 259.4.\nAfter UC, carefully discard the supernatant using a serological pipet, to avoid the disturbance of the pelleted EVs.",
    "NOTE: The pellet might be invisible.\nAdd 200 µL of 0.2 µm-filtered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the first tube and use PBS and the residual supernatant to resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down. Transfer the resulting EV suspension to the next tube of the respective sample and use it for the resuspension. Proceed this way to resuspend all EVs of the sample in a final volume of approximately 300-350 µL.\nAfter resuspension, confirm the presence of particles by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Use the settings optimized for the given EV type, such as the settings below (step 2.5.1).\n\tNOTE: The papers of Gardiner et al.27 and Vestad et al.28 contain valuable information on how to optimize the parameters for measuring EVs.\n\t\nTo reproduce the results described below, use instruments (e.g., NanoSight LM14) equipped with a green laser. Record three videos of 30 s with a screen gain of 1.0 and a camera level of 13. For analysis, use a screen gain of 1.0 and a detection threshold of 5.\nUse the pellet immediately, if possible; otherwise, store it at 4 °C overnight.\n3. Glucuronidase encapsulation into EVs\nTo the resuspended pellet, add beta-glucuronidase (10 mg/mL in PBS) to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/mL and saponin (10 mg/mL in H2O) to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Mix well by vortexing for 3 s.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature with intermitted mixing by gently flicking the tube. After incubation, directly purify by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (see section 5).\n\tNOTE: Do not refreeze glucuronidase samples once thawed, to prevent enzyme degradation due to freezing.\n4. Liposome production",
    "To prepare liposomes for comparison with EVs, dissolve 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a 2:3 molar ration in chloroform to a final concentration of 5 mM. Prepare 1 mL aliquots in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) vials and let them dry overnight to form a lipid film.\n\tCAUTION: Chloroform is toxic and suspected to be cancerogenic. Take proper precautions when handling it.\nRehydrate the lipid-film with 1 mL of PBS containing 1.5 mg/mL glucuronidase. Heat it to 42 °C and vortex for 1 min. Heat the extruder assembly to 42 °C and extrude the lipid suspension 11x through a 200 nm polycarbonate membrane. Directly purify by SEC (see section 5).\n5. Purification by SEC\nPrepare the SEC column using the following protocol.\n\t\nUse only fresh purified water and freshly prepared buffers. Filter all buffers through a 0.2 µm membrane filter and degas them to prevent the formation of air bubbles in the column.\nFor the preparation of an SEC column, use agarose gel filtration-based matrix (e.g., Sepharose Cl-2b) or another SEC medium suitable to separate EVs and liposomes from protein impurities and excess enzyme. First, remove the 20% EtOH solution the medium is stored in, to prevent air bubble formation in the column. To this end, centrifuge the SEC medium at 3,000 x g for 10 min, remove the EtOH, and replace it with degassed water.\nFill a glass column (with an inner diameter of 10 mm) with the SEC medium to the 15 mL mark.\n\t\tNOTE: Volumes will differ for columns with different dimensions. Make sure to let the gel settle completely.",
    "Before a run, equilibrate the column with at least two column volumes of PBS. To store the column, first wash it with one column volume of water, followed by at least two column volumes of 20% EtOH. After storage, wash the column first with one column volume of water before equilibrating with PBS.\nUse up to 400 µL of EV or liposome suspension in one separation. Collect fractions of 1 mL. After SEC, either store the purified EVs (see section 7) or subject them to a glucuronidase assay (see section 6).\nConfirm the separation of EVs and liposomes from contaminating proteins and free glucuronidase. To this end, correlate the particle concentrations of the collected fractions with the protein concentration and the glucuronidase activity.\n\t\nAssess the particle concentration by NTA (see 2.5)\nAssess the protein content by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay or another suitable protein quantification assay. Perform the assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nAssess the glucuronidase activity by glucuronidase assay (see section 6).\nOptionally, assess the EV morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).\n\t\nFor the preparation of TEM samples, add 10 µL of EV suspension to a TEM grid, incubate for 10 min, and then blot away any excess liquid using a filter paper. Perform the fixation for 10 min with 10 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde and blot away any excess. Wash 3x with water. Stain the vesicles by 20 s incubation with 30 µL of 1% phosphor-tungstic acid hydrate. After blotting away the excess, dry the vesicles overnight. Visualize by TEM.\n\t\tCAUTION: Phospho-tungstic acid is highly caustic; thus, protect skin and eyes.\nFor SEM, fix the previously prepared TEM samples onto carbon disks and sputter them with a 50 nm thick gold layer. Visualize by SEM.\n6. Glucuronidase assay",
    "To allow a comparison between different samples and storage conditions by correlating particle number and enzyme activity, first measure the particle concentration of the sample by NTA (see step 2.5).\nPrepare a working solution of fluorescein di-β-D-glucuronide by adding 1 µL of the compound (10 mg/mL in H2O) to 199 µL of PBS. Add 25 µL of this solution to 125 µL of purified EVs to get a final concentration of 8.3 µg/mL. Pipet the sample into a black 96-well plate. Measure time point 0 h with a plate reader, using 480 nm as excitation and 516 nm as emission wavelength.\nCover the plate tightly (e.g., with transparent plastic foil used for PCR plates) to minimize evaporation and incubate in the dark for 18 h at 37 °C. Measure the fluorescein production using the plate reader parameters listed in step 6.2.\n7. Storage of EVs and liposomes\nNOTE: For all storage purposes, it is advisable to use low-binding tubes to reduce EV loss due to adsorption.\nFollow the parameters in this section to reproduce the representative results given below. Use samples consisting of 400 µL of EV suspension.\n\t\nStore at 4 °C or -80 °C or proceed to steps listed below.\nLyophilize the EVs.\n\t\t\nAdd trehalose (40 mg/mL in H2O) up to a final concentration of 4 mg/mL to the purified EVs. Freeze the samples at -80 °C for at least 1 h.\nLyophilize the samples using the following parameters. For main drying, set the shelf temperature to 15 °C and pressure to 0.180 mbar and leave the samples to dry for 46 h. For final drying, set the shelf temperature to 25 °C and pressure to 0.0035 mbar and leave the samples to dry for 2 h. Store the lyophilized samples at 4 °C.",
    "To rehydrate the samples, add H2O, equal to the amount of EV suspension present in the beginning (typically, 400 µL). Do not use any buffer for rehydration.\n8. Analysis after storage\nTo assess the enzyme activity, first remove the free glucuronidase, which may have leaked from the EVs during storage. Achieve this by an additional step of purification that is carried out either by SEC (see step 5) or asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) (see step 8.1.2).\n\tNOTE: Please be advised that both methods lead to a dilution of the EV sample; thus, use sufficient EV concentrations before storage to avoid moving below the NTA quantification limit. Expect a 1:10 dilution of the particles due to SEC or AF4.\n\t\nFor SEC purification, follow the protocol described above (see section 5).\nPerform AF4 purification.\n\t\t\nSet up the instrument using a small channel with a 350 µm spacer and a 30 kD molecular weight cut-off cellulose membrane. Place a 0.1 µm pore size filter between the HPLC pump and the AF4 channel. Use freshly prepared 0.1 µm-filtered PBS as the mobile phase to reduce the particle load and noise in the light-scattering detectors.\nDetect proteins using a UV detector set to 280 nm. To detect particles, use multiangle light scattering with the laser set to 658 nm.",
    "Use the following run method. Pre-focus for 1 min with a focus flow of 1 mL/min; then, inject 300 µL of the sample at a rate of 0.2 mL/min and keep up the focus flow for 10 min. After the injection, elute the sample at 1 mL/min while applying a cross flow that decreases from 2 mL/min to 0.1 mL/min over the course of 8 min. Elute for another 10 min without cross flow. Collect fractions of 1 mL, starting after 12.5 min and continuing until 27 min.\nPerform the glucuronidase assay as described above (see section 6).\nTo assess the size and concentration, use the NTA as described above (see step 2.5).\nOptionally, perform TEM and SEM to assess the morphology of the EVs after storage (see 5.3).\nSubscription Required.
