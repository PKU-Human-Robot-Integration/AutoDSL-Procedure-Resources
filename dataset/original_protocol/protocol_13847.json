  "procedures": [
    "The authors declare that the protocol follows the guidelines of the local Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Lublin.\n1. Qualification for the UAE procedure\nNOTE: This is addressed to gynecologists and interventional radiologists.\nInform the patient about the details of UAE procedure.\n\t\nDiscuss indications and contraindications for the UAE procedure.\nDiscuss with the patient the assumptions of UAE and alternative methods (described in the Introduction) in the treatment of uterine fibroids.\nWARNING! Inform the patient that the UAE is not a radical procedure (the myoma will not be removed).\nWARNING! Inform the patient that she will not receive a histopathology report of uterine fibroids after UAE.\nWARNING! Inform the patient that 1–3 cases out of 1,000 uterine tumors can be malignant (LMS). Discuss with the patient that the endometrial biopsy and MRI performed during UAE qualification is highly sensitive in the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, but not 100%. Inform the patient that performing UAE for leiomyosarcoma may delay diagnosis and proper treatment. Note that fact in the medical record.\nIf the patient knowingly wants UAE performed, continue this Protocol.\nInform the patient that the qualification takes place in two stages. Qualification by a gynecologist includes analysis of indications and contraindications, while an interventional radiologist assesses the technical capabilities of UAE.\nPlan or perform a gynecological consultation and plan a consultation with the interventional radiologist before UAE.\nIf possible, perform as many of the qualification procedures as possible at the outpatient clinic.\nEnsure that the patient has indications for UAE: symptomatic uterine fibroids (menometrorrhagia, metrorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain); the refusal of surgery treatment; no consent for blood transfusion; previously failed uterine fibroids surgery. Note them in the medical history.\n\t\nAsk the patient about the symptoms of fibroid(s).",
    "Discuss the effectiveness of UAE and the expectations of the patient (in the Representative Results).\nAsk whether the patient was treated for uterine fibroids previously. Ensure which method was used.\nIf the patient refuses surgical treatment or blood transfusion, take a written statement.\nEnsure that the patient who qualified for the UAE procedure does not have absolute contraindications: asymptomatic fibroids; a viable pregnancy; current or recent genital infection; diagnostic doubts due to clinical factors or inadequate imaging; contraindications for the use of radiological contrast agents; features of leiomyosarcoma on MRI; uterine or ovarian malignant tumor unless it is performed for palliation or as an adjunct to surgery87. Note them in the medical history.\n\t\nIf the patient demands UAE despite asymptomatic fibroids, explain that such cases do not qualify for the procedure. Explain to the patient that asymptomatic fibroids only require regular gynecological monitoring.\nIf there are relative contraindications to UAE (large fibroids and reproductive plans), discuss them with the patient and make a note of that fact in the medical record.\n\t\nFocus on the possible complications related to relative contraindication, described in the introduction, ensure the patient understands and agrees to the procedure.\nDiscuss the after-effect and complications of uterine artery embolization with the patient (see introduction) and note that fact in the medical record.\n\t\nWhen talking to the patient, pay special attention to the post-embolization pain.\nDiscuss post-embolization pain treatments.\nPerform a gynecological qualification.\n\t\nCollect medical history and perform a gynecological examination.\nPerform an ultrasound assessment of the reproductive organs to evaluate the size and type of fibroids (FIGO classification)88.\n\t\t\nUse a vaginal probe to estimate the size and location of the myoma (Figure 2). The uterine fibroids treated with UAE should be 2–5 (ideally, 3–4) according to FIGO classification, and the diameter should not exceed 10 cm.",
    "Include the protocol of the pelvis ultrasound scan in the medical record.\nEnsure that the ultrasound scan result gives indications for qualification for the UAE procedure.\nExclude malignant processes within the pelvis.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the patient has had a current (preferably performed within 6 months) results of cervical (PAP) smear and endometrial biopsy.\nDuring a pelvic ultrasound, use the vaginal probe to evaluate the ovaries and confirm that their structure is correct. If in doubt, check the previous ultrasound scan or perform the ROMA test.\nOrder an MRI to evaluate the uterine tumor for LMS features and UAE technical capabilities.\nNote the results of the cervical (PAP) smear, the endometrial biopsy, the ultrasound scan (possibly the ROMA test), and the MRI in the medical record.\nIf the results are incorrect, disqualify the patient from the procedure.\nInform the patients about the results of the gynecological qualification.\n\t\t\nNote that fact in the medical record. Refer the patient to the hospital.\nMake an appointment for the UAE procedure and remember that the patient should be before the 10th day of the cycle.\nAsk the patient if she refuses surgery. In case of refusal note that fact in the informed consent of the patient or the medical record.\nPatients with symptomatic fibroids who refuse surgery qualify for UAE.\nPerform the following tests at least 7 days before UAE to assess and avoid potential complications: microbiological test of vaginal smear (aerobic vaginal culture); urinalysis; selected blood tests: CBC, Coagulation tests (INR, APPT), Renal panel (creatine, urea), TSH, CRP.\n\t\t\nDescribe the results in the medical record.\nInform the patient that incorrect results disqualify her for the procedure.",
    "Check the patient’s ovarian reserve by testing AMH (recommended) or FSH (not recommended under 40 years) serum levels at the follicular phase. Discuss with the patient that the above test will be helpful to assess ovarian damage as a result of non-target embolization. Note that fact in the medical record.\nPatients who are qualified for UAE should not declare the will to become pregnant due to the increased risk of pregnancy complications14,32,38,50,51,52,89,90,91.\n\t\t\nInform the patient about the increased risk of pregnancy complications after UAE.\nNote the fact that the patient does not declare the will to become pregnant in the informed consent of the patient or the medical record.\nIf the patient still does not exclude pregnancy in the future, but requires UAE, take a written declaration that she has been informed about possible pregnancy complications after UAE.\nPerform radiological qualification.\n\t\nEnsure that pelvic MRI has been performed. MRI examination allows to exclude other pathologies of the reproductive organ and adjacent structures (step 1.6.3.3. of the Qualification for UAE procedure), assess the morphology and location of fibroids, and anatomy for the technical feasibility of embolization (Figure 3, Figure 4). If not, arrange the MRI examination and consultation with an interventional radiologist.\nAnalyze the imaging examinations and assess the type and size of fibroids.\n\t\t\nIf submucosal (FIGO 0–1) fibroids are found, inform the patient about the risk of sloughing into the uterine cavity. Complete excretion may cause sepsis, while excretion in fragments is usually asymptomatic50.\nIf subserosal narrow-stalked, pedunculated (FIGO 7) fibroids are found, inform the patient about the risk of post-embolization detachment of the fibroid into the abdominal cavity. It can lead to acute inflammation, and laparoscopic reoperation may be needed92.",
    "If large fibroids are found, inform the patient that the risk of complications remains unchanged, but the outcome of the procedure is better for small fibroids93.\nNote that fact in the informed consent of the patient or medical record.\n2. Preparing for the UAE procedure\nNOTE: This is addressed to gynecologists or vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists.\nAdmit the patient to the hospital (gynecological or vascular surgery department).\n\t\nEnsure that she is before the 10th day of the cycle at admission.\nPerform or order a gynecological examination and an ultrasound scan of the pelvis.\n\t\nEnsure that the diagnosis and qualification for the UAE procedure are correct.\nEnsure that no new contraindications have appeared since the qualification for UAE. If so, suggest other treatment options and change the date of the procedure.\nPerform the 3D transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVUS) and calculate the volume and vascularization indexes of the fibroid (VI, FI, and VFI) using the VOCAL software exam (which is used to assess the effectiveness of the UAE procedure72,75) (described in the introduction) (Figure 5 and Figure 6).\nNote that fact in the medical record.\nEnsure that the patient qualified for UAE has tests performed during qualification for UAE (described in steps 1.6.2, 1.6.3, 1.6.5 and 1.6.6 of Qualification for UAE).\n\t\nIf the patient has been pre-qualified by a gynecologist and does not have blood tests, a urine test, and an MRI, order the tests and arrange a consultation with an interventional radiologist (step 1.7 of Qualification for UAE).\nRate or order AMH (recommended) or FSH (not recommended under 40 years) serum level before UAE to enable the assessment of ovarian damage as a result of \"non-target\" embolization.",
    "Inform the patient that the test results will be available in about a day and the UAE procedure will be possible only after receiving these results.\nInform the patient that incorrect results disqualify her for the procedure.\nWARNING! In the case of missing or incorrect results of PAP smear, endometrial biopsy; the microbiological test of vaginal smear, disqualify the patient from UAE (too long time to obtain these results). Re-qualify after obtaining the correct results.\nNote that fact in the medical record.\nObtain an informed consent to perform UAE.\n\t\nProvide the patient with all information about UAE.\nDiscuss the possible complications of UAE (described in the introduction).\nLeave the patient time to think and ask questions; allow the patient to give an informed consent to perform the UAE procedure.\nInform the patient that she has the right to change her decision until UAE begins.\n\t\nIf the patient changes her decision regarding UAE, then suggest other treatment options for uterine fibroids (described in the introduction).\nNote that fact in the informed consent of the patient or medical record.\nImmediately before the UAE procedure, check and ensure that the tests described in sections 1.6.2, 1.6.3, 1.6.5 and 1.6.6 of Qualification for UAE as well as 3D TVUS, MRI, and consultation with an interventional radiologist have been performed, and the results are correct.\n\t\nDisqualify a patient from UAE if the tests are missing or results are incorrect.\nNote that fact in the medical record.\nInform the patient and take care of the prohibition on taking food and liquids from morning until the procedure. The exception is a small amount of liquid needed to take the morning dose of medication.\n\t\nEnsure in the morning (before UAE) that the patient is fasting.\nEnsure that the patient took the medications for own chronic diseases.",
    "Note that fact in the medical record.\nOrder the patient the following medications: 1 tablet of anxiolytic (for example, Estazolam) orally, 1 dose of intravenous antibiotics, 1 globule of Metronidazole intravaginally, Diclofenac 100 mg rectal suppository.\n\t\nGive the above medicines about 30–40 min prior to UAE.\nNote that fact in the medical record.\nPrepare the operative field by ensuring that the left armpit and right groin are shaved.\n\t\nIf the above areas of skin are not shaved, shave them gently.\nNote that fact in the medical record.\nEnsure that the patient does not have an intrauterine device (IUD).\n\t\nIf the patient has an IUD in the uterus, inform her of the increased risk of infection in the uterine cavity and offer to remove it before UAE.\nIf the patient does not agree to remove the IUD, note that fact in the informed consent of the patient or the medical record.\nEnsure that the patient reports any allergic reactions to medicines, contrast agents, and disinfectants and note that fact and results in the medical record.\n3. Performing the UAE procedure\nNOTE: This is addressed to interventional radiologists and anesthesiologists.\nPerform the procedure in sterile conditions.\n\t\nPut the patient on the operating table and disinfect the right inguinal region widely using a hospital disinfectant (with appropriate approval).\nGlue the surgical drape around the surgical site (right groin).\nSelect the type of anesthesia: local or epidural anesthesia (EA) and note the patient's choice in the medical record.\nUAE under local anesthesia.\n\t\nAnesthetize (subcutaneous administration) 2% lignocaine solution at the site of the surgery.\nAdminister 5 mg of morphine intravenously as needed.\nBefore starting the UAE procedure, make sure that the local anesthesia is operational.\nUAE under EA\n\t\nPrepare the patient properly for the EA.\nPerform the EA before gluing the surgical drape.",
    "Ensure that the patient qualified for the EA procedure does not have the following contraindications EA: procedure refusal, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic disease, taking anticoagulants, shock, infection at the site of epidural injection, bacteremia, local anesthetics allergy, anatomical deformities of the spine, increased intracranial pressure, neurological disease, severe aortic or mitral stenosis94. Note that fact in the medical record.\nCall an anesthesiologist and ask for EA.\nPlace a thin catheter to the epidural space in the lumbar region and give an anesthetic (procedure addressed for anesthesiologists).\nBefore starting the UAE procedure, make sure that the EA is operational.\nThe UAE procedure\n\t\nPerform the UAE procedure in Angio Suit under fluoroscopy guidance.\nObtain access to the vascular system using the Seldinger technique95,96 (Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9).\nInsert a pigtail catheter into the abdominal aorta just below the renal arteries.\nPerform angiography to visualize the vessels.\nPerform aortonephrography to assess the anatomy of the vessels that supply the fibroids and to plan the procedure (Figure 10).\nPerform angiography of the internal iliac artery in anterior-posterior and oblique projection to reveal the uterine artery ostium.\n\t\t\nStart from the left side, then the right one, due to the site of a puncture and specific shape of the catheter. Depending on the caliber of the vessel, the main catheter or microcatheter is selectively introduced into the uterine artery (Figure 11).\nPlace the catheter deep in the uterine artery. Embolize the vessel with hydrogel particles. Due to the presence of uterine-ovary anastomosis, the size of which is estimated at approximately 500 μm, the suggested size of the particles for embolization is 700 μm to reduce the risk of \"non-target embolization\".",
    "Continue embolization until the blood flow in the vessel is completely blocked. The endpoint of treatment is contrast stasis in the vessel, which proves its effective closure.\nPerform the embolization of the uterine artery on the opposite side with the same access. The treatment lasts for about 0.5 to 1.0 h66,67 (Figure 12).\nAssess the effectiveness of the embolization from a catheter placed in the internal iliac artery during control angiography. The absence of an active inflow of shading blood (to the uterine arteries) indicates that the procedure is considered technically correct (Figure 13).\nCarefully remove the catheter.\nClose the puncture site through manual compression with pressure dressing, which should be maintained for the next 6 h or closure device (Figure 14).\nDescribe the course of the UAE in the medical record.\n4. Patient care after the UAE procedure\nNOTE: This is addressed to gynecologists or vascular surgeons and anesthesiologists.\nStart analgesic treatment: patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump or EA.\n\t\nInform and discuss the options of analgesic treatment with the patient.\nInform the patient that EA provides better pain control and faster rehabilitation, compared to the PCA pump76.\nNote that fact and the patient’s choice in the medical record.\nAnalgesic treatment of post-embolization pain using a PCA pump.\n\t\nPrepare the syringe for the PCA pump with the morphine solution.\n\t\t\nFill the 50 mL syringe for the PCA pump with 50 mg of morphine and solution of 0.9% NaCl (concentration 1 mg/mL).\nPrepare the PCA pump for intravenous use.\n\t\t\nJoin the drain to the syringe.\nInsert the venipuncture using a cannula.\nInsert the syringe into the PCA pump.\nFill the drain, launch the PCA pump.\nTurn on the START button.\nLock the PCA pump.\nSet the PCA pump parameters (listed below) (Figure 15).",
    "WARNING! Higher doses of Morphine may cause respiratory depression.\n\t\t\nUse a Morphine concentration of 1 mg/mL. Use a dose of morphine infusion on-demand (intravenous bolus) (Bolus p.) of 0.5 mg with a time interval after which the next on-demand infusion can be provided (Lockout interval/[Karencja]) of 5 min (to avoid respiratory depression). Use a time of intravenous morphine injection during on-demand infusion of 10 s.\nEnsure that all the above steps are done.\nOrder morphine in the PCA pump for up to 24 h.\n\t\t\nMonitor pain according to the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Note the NRS value in the medical record.\nUse the Pain Assessment Card (PAC).\nInform the patient that when the pain symptoms come, she should press the “joy-stick” herself, thereby obtaining the medicine on demand.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the patient understands the instructions.\nObserve the amount of on-demand “intravenous bolus” to “empty bolus” (launched during lockout interval - section 4.2.3 of the Patient care after the UAE PROTOCOL) (Figure 16).\nIf the ratio of “empty bolus” to on-demand “intravenous bolus” reaches a value higher than 2/1 (67% / 33%), use the procedure below (Figure 17, Figure 18).\nTo improve the effectiveness of pain relief therapy using a PCA pump, and reduce the risk of morphine side effects, consider using paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in intravenous injections and standard doses.\nTake care of the situations when the patient needs to leave the bed.\n\t\t\nDo not turn off the pump.\nDisconnect the drain and secure it with a stopper.\nWhen the patient returns, reconnect the drain.\nAnalgesic treatment of post-embolization pain using EA.\n\t\nContinue EA if it was used for the UAE procedure.\nIf local anesthesia was used for the UAE procedure and the patient orders EA, before epidural catheter placement, ensure that CBC and coagulation tests are correct.",
    "Ensure that the patient qualified for the EA procedure does not have the contradictions described in section 3.4.3 of Performing the UAE procedure. Note that fact in the medical record.\nCall an anesthesiologist and ask for EA.\nMake sure that the EA is operational.\nDetermine the EA work mode (bolus or continuous) with the anesthesiologist. Note that fact in the medical record.\n\t\t\nIn continuous mode (CEA), consult with an anesthesiologist and check the infusion pump settings.\nIn bolus mode (BEA), discuss with the anesthesiologist the time intervals between administering the local anesthetic agent.\nMaintain the catheter for 24–48 h, depending on the needs.\n\t\t\nMonitor the pain with the NRS scale. Note the NRS value in the medical record.\nUse the PAC.\nContinue CEA/BEA until needed, no longer than 48 h.\nContinue analgesic treatment after PCA or EA if necessary.\n\t\t\nOrder Paracetamol 3 x 1.0 g intravenously.\nOrder Diclofenac 2 x 50 mg rectal suppository.\nIf the above analgesic treatment is not enough, include supportive analgesics.\n\t\t\nOrder Ketoprofen 2 x 100 mg intravenously.\nTreat urinary tract symptoms by ordering Furazidin 3 x 100 mg orally.\n5. Control visit after the UAE procedure\nNOTE: This is addressed to gynecologists.\nPerform the first control examination on the first day after UAE.\n\t\nAssess the general condition of the patient.\nMeasure the patient’s body temperature.\nRate pain after UAE according to the NRS scale. Use the PAC.\nAssess the wound where the vascular catheter was inserted.\nPerform CBC and coagulation tests.\nPerform a TVUS to assess the condition of the pelvic organs after UAE.\nPerform a 3D TVUS using volume probe to assess the volume and vascularization indexes of the fibroid (VI, FI, and VFI).\nIf there are no complications, and the post-embolization pain has been controlled by oral analgesics, discharge the patient home.",
    "Inform the patient that if fever, abdominal pain, and purulent vaginal discharge occur after hospitalization, the patient should immediately seek medical attention.\nPerform the next control visit 3 months after UAE.\n\t\nPerform a gynecological examination, CBC test, and AMH or FSH serum level.\nPerform MRI or TVUS to assess the condition of the pelvic organs after UAE (Figure 19).\nPerform 3D TVUS using volume probe to assess the volume and vascularization indexes of the fibroid (VI, FI, and VFI).\nPerform the last control visit 6 months after the UAE.\n\t\nPerform a gynecological examination, CBC test, and AMH or FSH serum level.\nPerform a TVUS to assess the condition of the pelvic organs after UAE.\nPerform 3D TVUS using volume probe to assess the volume and vascularization indexes of the fibroid (VI, FI, and VFI).\nAssess the effectiveness of UAE.\n\t\nCompare the results of the CBC test before and after UAE.\nCompare the volumes and vascularization indexes of the fibroid (VI, FI, and VFI) before and after UAE.\nCompare serum AMH or FSH levels before and after UAE to assess the possibility of iatrogenic damage to the ovaries during UAE as a result of \"non-target\" embolization.\nInform the patient that after uterine artery embolization, she should undergo regular gynecological check-ups.\nIn selected cases (no reduction of fibroid’s symptoms, suspected tissue demarcation, or doubt in other additional examinations), perform an MRI one year after UAE (Figure 20)."
