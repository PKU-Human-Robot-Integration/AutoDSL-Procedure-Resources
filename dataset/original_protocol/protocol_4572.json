    "Turn on the Oxymax instrument and computer, allowing the system to warm up for 2 h;Start the Oxymax v4.91 program;Perform CO2 calibration;Select calibration in the program, turn on the gas tank and set it to 5-10 psi；Press the CO2 button in “calibration” window (Figure 2a). Gain should be close to 1 after calibration (Figure 2b);Perform O2 calibration; Press the O2 button in “calibration” window (Figure 2a)； Desired O2 level is listed in the first prompt window (Figure 2d). Use the fine and coarse knobs (Figure 2c) to adjust the O2 level to desired level；Turn off the gas tank after finishing the O2 calibration. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150916/20150916055537_8137.pngFigure 2. CO2 and O2 calibrationSetup a new experiment, choose the chambers to be used, input the Identification number and weight of mice to be measured (Figure 3), only one mouse is allowed per chamber;imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150916/20150916054534_6074.pngFigure 3. Input of mouse informationSetup the measurement schedule including number of Intervals, time of cage settle, cage measure, reference settle, reference measure, and reference method (Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150916/20150916054719_1276.pngFigure 4. Setup schedule for measurement. “0” for intervals means the experiment will run indefinitely until stopped by the user. “8” for reference methods means the experiment will measure the reference air after every 8 subjects. Place the mice in the corresponding calorimetric chambers, standard cages are used (Figure 5);imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150916/20150916054751_1077.jpgFigure 5. Test chamber for mice (standard cage)Fill the cage with sufficient food and water for a period of 24 h.",
    "Ensure that food and water are available ad libitum (Figure 5);Check if there is any leakage in the system with software as follows:Open Tools → Select Sample Pump from Oxymax utility  →       Ensure Test in Valve open and N2 and Ref Air/Cal Valve closed       → Turn Sample Pump ON →      Select the chamber to be tested in Expansion Interface Disconnect drier input tubing from tested chamber     → put the finger over it, If there is no system leaks, the ball on the front of the system sample pump will drop to 0; If not, check all air fittings to assure an air-tight connection and test it again (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150916/20150916055443_1980.jpgFigure 6. Gas leakage checkRun the experiment for 24 h and export the data in Excel file format, which include the data listed as below:O2 consumption = (VO2 input) – (VO2 output), ml/kg/h;CO2 production = (VCO2 output) – (VCO2) input, ml/kg/h;Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) = VCO2/VO2 Ratio;Energy Expenditure (Heat production) = calorific value (Cv ) x VO2 =(3.815 + 1.232 x RER) x VO2, cal/h;Close the experiment and return the mice to their home cages;Turn off the system and clean the calorimetry with water and appropriate disinfectant."
