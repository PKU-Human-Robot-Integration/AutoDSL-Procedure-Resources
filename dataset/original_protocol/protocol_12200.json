    "NOTE: A schematic of the serum- and feeder-free CM collection protocol is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Materials (Preparation of MEFs, Medium, Plates, and Solutions)\nPrepare 500 ml of medium to culture the MEFs. Supplement Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS (ESC quality), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin.\nIsolate MEFs from embryos following an established routine protocol13 and maintain them in MEF medium.\nPrepare 500 ml of medium to culture the mESCs. DMEM is supplemented with 15% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 µM non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 100 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin.\nPrepare the gelatinized plates (5 gelatinized plates/1 mESC plate) by coating 10 cm cell culture dishes with 5 ml of 0.1% gelatin solution. Incubate for at least 10 min at room temperature.\nPrepare 500 ml of Reduced Serum Medium for a serum-free condition of mESCs. Supplement Reduced Serum Media with 1.2 g of sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.0). Filter through a 0.2 µm bottle-top filter.\nPrepare the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA β-gal) staining solution for the detection of senescent cells: 1 mg/ml X-gal (dissolved in dimethylformamide, DMF), 40 mM citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgCl214.\n\tCAUTION: (Hazardous) DMF is a toxic and corrosive solution. Wear personal protective clothing (e.g., nitrile or latex gloves, a lab coat, and goggles) when handling solution. Use a fume hood.\nPrepare 500 ml of medium to culture human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs, NHDF-Ad-Der-Fibroblast). Supplement DMEM with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.\n2. Culture of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (Figure 1A and 2A)\nNOTE: Carry out all steps in a cell culture biological safety hood.",
    "Treat the MEFs with 20 ml of MEF medium containing 10 µg/ml of mitomycin C in a 15 cm cell culture dish. Incubate for 2 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nAspirate the medium from MEFs. Wash the cells with PBS three times. Add 3 ml of trypsin-EDTA (TE, 1x) and incubate for 3 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 3 min, neutralize the TE with 6 ml of MEF medium and centrifuge for 3 min at 300 x g.\nResuspend in 5 ml of MEF medium. Determine the cell number in the resulting cell suspension using trypan blue staining and a hemocytometer. Plate inactivated MEFs (feeder) at a density of 2 x 106 cells per 10-cm cell culture dish in MEF medium. Incubate for 24 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nReplace the MEF medium with mESC medium 24 hr after plating the feeder (on the following day).\nPlate the mESCs (G4 F1 hybrid ES cell) at a density of 2 x 106 cells on the feeder with mESC medium. Incubate for 48 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: The anti-aging effect of mESC-CM is likely stronger when lower passage number mESCs are used15-17. We acquired a G4 mESC line from Dr. Andras Nagy in Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, ON, M5T 3H7, Canada.\nKeep the cells at a relatively high density and passage at a 70-80% sub-confluent state. Replace the medium with fresh mESC medium daily.\n3. Collection of Serum- and Feeder-free Conditioned Medium (Figure 1B and 2B)\nNOTE: Carry out all steps in a cell culture biological safety hood.",
    "Rinse the mESC plate with 5 ml of PBS. Add 1 ml of TE (2.5x) and incubate for 3 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 3 min, neutralize the TE with 2 ml of mESC medium and centrifuge for 3 min at 300 x g.\nResuspend in 5 ml of mESC medium and plate 1 ml into each gelatin-coated culture dish (5 gelatinized plates/1 mESC plate) in mESC medium. Culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until 80-85% confluency is reached.\nWash mESCs with sufficient PBS to cover the cells (8 ml per 10 cm plate) for 10 min per wash, for a total of three washes. Incubate in Reduced Serum Medium for 24 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: The washing step is important to prevent FBS contamination. It is important to follow the incubation time18,19.\nCollect mESC-CM into a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuge for 20 min at 2,500 x g. Collect the supernatant solution (CM) after the centrifugation. Filter through a 0.2 µm bottle-top filter.\n4. Effects of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell-conditioned Medium (mESC-CM)\nNOTE: The effects of mESC-CM were validated by several methods, such as SA β-gal assay, cell cycle analysis, and qRT-PCR.\nSA β-gal Assay (Figure 3A)\nSeed HDFs at a density of 2 x 104 cells per well in 6-well plates in HDF medium. Incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nFollowing an overnight incubation, discard half of the HDF medium and add mESC-CM and control medium. Incubate for 72 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Control medium is derived from serum-free medium (Reduced Serum Media) in a gelatin-coated dish in the absence of mESCs.",
    "Wash the cells with sufficient PBS to cover the cells (2 ml per 6-well plate) for 30 sec per wash, for a total of two washes. Add 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for fixation. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\n\t\tCAUTION: (Hazardous) Paraformaldehyde is a toxic and corrosive solution. Wear personal protective clothing (e.g., nitrile or latex gloves, a lab coat, and goggles) when handling the solution. Use a fume hood.\nAspirate the fixation solution. Wash the fixed cells with PBS twice, as described in step 4.1.3.\nAdd the SA β-gal staining solution (1-2 ml per well in a 6-well plate). Incubate for 17.5 hr at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: It is not to be incubated in a CO2 incubator.\nAspirate the SA β-gal staining solution and wash the cells with PBS twice, as described in step 4.1.3.\nAdd the Eosin solution for counter-staining. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Wash the cells with PBS twice, as described in step 4.1.3.\nImage cells at 100X magnification using a light microscope and capture images using an attached digital camera for subsequent analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: The total number of cells can be counted in a blind manner and the percentage of SA β-gal positive blue cells can be calculated.\nCell Cycle Analysis (Figure 3B)\nSeed HDFs at a density of 8 x 104 cells per well in a 6 cm cell culture dish in HDF medium. Incubate overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nFollowing an overnight incubation, discard half of the HDF medium and add mESC-CM and control medium. Incubate for 24 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "Trypsinize the cells, as described step in 3.1, and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g. Wash the cells with cold PBS solution (PBS with 0.5 mM CaCl2 and 2% FBS, 1 ml per 1.5 ml tube) twice and centrifuge for 3 min at 2,500 x g. Resuspend in 100 µl of cold PBS solution.\nFix the cells by dropping 200 µl of cold ethanol while vortexing. Store at 4 °C for at least 1 hr.\nWash the cells with cold PBS solution twice, as described in step 4.2.3.\nResuspend the cells in 250 µl of sodium citrate buffer (1.12%, pH 8.5) containing 50 µg/ml RNase. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 250 µl of sodium citrate buffer containing 50 µg/ml propidium iodide.

Quantify the extracted total RNA using a spectrophotometer21.\nSynthesize cDNA by adding 1 µg of the total RNA to a 20 µl of reaction mixture containing oligo (dT) primers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturer's protocol20.\nMeasure the amplification of the cDNA with a real-time PCR machine, using Green PCR master mix and specific gene primers (Supplement Table 1). Normalize the data with GAPDH expression. Use the following PCR protocol: initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C; 45 cycles for 15 sec at 95 °C, 20 sec at 55 °C, and 35 sec at 72 °C; and the melting curve stage for 15 sec at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 30 sec at 95 °C, and 5 sec at 60 °C15.",
