    "1. Culturing of Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells\nTake the Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs, from ATCC) out of a −80 °C freezer. Culture WJ-MSCs in DMEM-F12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FBS), 1% Pen-Strep, and 1% L-glutamine in a sterile laminar flow at room temperature, as described in Yurie et al.20.\nCryopreserve some of the cells at 1 x 106 cells/mL with freezing medium containing 35% FBS, 55% DMEMF-12, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). For this, count 1 x 106 cells on a Thoma cell counting slide and add the freezing solution dropwise. Quickly transfer the slide to a liquid nitrogen container.\nWhen cultured cells are 80% confluent in the flask, pour out the medium and wash with 5 mL of PBS. Add 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin and 2.21 mM EDTA-4Na. Incubate in an incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL of DMEM-F12 medium with 10% FBS to the cells removed from the incubator. Suspend it well, collect the medium, and transfer the medium to a centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at a rotational speed of 101 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and re-seed the cells in new flasks with fresh nutrient medium containing 10% FBS.\n\tNOTE: Commercial WJ-MSCs labeled with the GFP gene by the transduction method can be used to better visualize the biomaterial-cell interactions to be produced21. The groups to be used in this method can be created as shown in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nCreated Groups,Created Groups,Reasons to create,Reasons to create,Number of reps\n2D WJ-MSCs (2D-C),2D WJ-MSCs (2D-C),2D Control,2D Control,x 5\n2D WJ-MSCs & Graphene (2D-G),2D WJ-MSCs & Graphene (2D-G),Graphene toxic dose determination in 2D,Graphene toxic dose determination in 2D,x 5 reps to each of different concentrations",

Groups in the method. All 2D and 3D groups in the method are included.\n2. Graphene toxicity and 2D imaging\nPreparation of graphene concentrations and application to cells\n\tNOTE: Raw graphene nanoparticles were purchased commercially (industrial graphene nanoplates type) and were also donated. The dimensions of the particles were 5-8 nm in thickness, 5 µm in diameter, and 120-150 m2/g in surface area.",
    "Weigh the graphene to create a 1% solution (mg/mL). Make a stock solution by adding 10 mL of DMEMF-12 medium with 10% FBS to the weighed 100 µg of graphene nanoparticles and label this solution as stock solution. Sterilize in an autoclave at 121 °C under 1.5 atm pressure for 20 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The sterile graphene mixture is stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C until use. It may not be suitable for long-term use (maximum 1 month). In these cases, the mixture must be reconstituted and sterilized.\nPrepare a mixture of medium graphene at different concentrations to determine non-toxic doses. Set the initial dilutions as 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001%, and 0.0001% graphene/media.\nStarting with the 1% stock solution, take 1 mL successively from each concentration and transfer it into a new tube. Add 9 mL of DMEMF-12 medium with 10% FBS to each tube, making five gradually diluted samples, and shake and vortex the solutions to get equal distribution. Use only 10 mL of DMEMF-12 medium with 10% FBS as control.\n\t\tNOTE: The heavy flakes of graphene precipitate and, hence, need to be redistributed.\nSeed the WJ-MSCs in 6-well plates with 2 mL of fresh medium containing 10% FBS at 5 x 105 cells per well. Incubate for 1 day at 37 °C. Then, divide the plates into groups of equal and repeated wells. Do five repetitions for each concentration.\nDiscard the medium and then replace the medium with graphene medium concentrations at 2 mL per well. Use only the medium for the control group. Incubate the plates at 37 °C for 24 h.\nDetermination of non-toxic concentrations of graphene with MTT\n\t\nDiscard media with graphene after 24 h. Wash each well with PBS. Add fresh DMEMF-12 medium with 10% FBS at 2mL per well.",
    "NOTE: It is important to wash with PBS following the application of graphene concentrations on the cell because graphene nanoparticles, which are not taken into the cell by endocytosis, are removed from the environment. This makes the MTT test more efficient.\nUse the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) protocol to determine the IC50 value indicating 50% cell viability, as described in Kose et al.22 and in steps 2.2.3.-2.2.6.\nFirstly, weigh out 5 mg/mL of MTT salt and dissolve in PBS. Sterilize using a 0.45 µm filter. Wrap the MTT solution, made in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, with aluminum foil and store at 4 °C.\nAdd 10 µL of MTT to all the wells and incubate the plate for 4 h at 37 °C. Observe the formation of formazan crystals at 10x magnification under the microscope after incubation.\nTo dissolve the crystals formed in the cells, add 100 µL of DMSO to each well and mix by pipetting. Keep the plate in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Insert the plate into the ELISA plate reader. Set a wavelength of 570 nm from the program for absorbance measurement and have it read the plate22.\n\t\tNOTE: In addition, while graphene particles alone are read at 270 nm23, the read range of 570 nm24 here will be for reading cell viability only.\nPerform statistical analysis on the obtained results using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's test in a statistical analysis program.\nStitch imaging\n\t\nTo examine the interaction of different graphene concentrations with cells, perform a time-lapse of the cells with the method called stitch imaging. This method creates a time-lapse image using image samples taken at regular intervals under the microscope.",
    "To do this, turn on the computer first. Turn on the time-lapse imaging incubator and set it to 37 °C. Place the MTT plate in the time-lapse incubator slot.\nOpen the Stitch program on the computer. Specify the wells to be read in the system. Bring the reader to the first well and locate and focus the area at 10x magnification in white light. Start the program.\n\t\tNOTE: It is a program for creating high-quality 4 rows x 5 columns multiple photo collages. The program combines photos taken one after the other in HD quality. When you press the system start button, the wells are automatically read, and it takes and stitches 4 rows x 5 columns multiple photos.\n3. Graphene - Bioink biohybrid hydrogel production and WJ-MSCs differentiation\nProduction of bioinks\n\tNOTE: The lyophilized commercially available Alginate-Gelatin (3:5) powders are used as the basis of bioinks. The graphene bioink group (3D-G; 3D-GS) and the graphene-free control bioink group (3D-B; 3D-BS) are prepared with the same method (Table 1).\n\t\nUse 50 mL conical tubes for the preparation. First, weigh 4.5 mg of alginate and 1.5 mg of gelatin and transfer to a centrifuge tube. Add DMEMF-12 medium containing 10% FBS to the mixture to a total volume of 50 mL. This is the control (C) group without graphene.\nRepeat weighing 4.5 mg of alginate and 1.5 mg of gelatin and transfer to a centrifuge tube. Then, take 50 µL of the prepared 0.1% graphene from step 2.1.3. and add it to the tube. Add DMEMF-12 with 10% FBS to a total volume of 50 mL.\nMix the bioinks first by pipetting and then vortex. Sterilize in an autoclave at 121 °C under 1.5 atm pressure for 20 min. Alternatively, perform sterilization by microwaving until boiling point.",
    "After the mixtures are autoclaved, centrifuge at 280 x g for 2 min at room temperature to remove formed bubbles. Keep the bioinks at 37 °C until the cells are prepared.\nAddition of WJ-MSCs and 3D bioprinting\n\t\nFor counting, wash the cells when there is 80% confluence with approximately 5 mL of PBS, and add 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin and 2.21 mM EDTA 4Na. Leave for 5 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 10 mL of DMEM-F12 medium with 10% FBS to the cells after removing from the incubator. Suspend well, collect the medium, and transfer it to a centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 101 x g for 5 min at room temperatures and then discard the supernatant.\nLeave approximately 250 µL of medium with the pellet. Redissolve the pellet in 1 mL of fresh medium. To 48 µL of medium, add 2 µL of cell suspension and 50 µL of trypan blue (0.4 g trypan blue/100 mL) in a conical tube (1.5 mL) for counting4. Pipette it well.\nAdd approximately 10 mL of the prepared stained cell suspension to a Thoma cell counting chamber. Calculate the average number of cells falling into the squares on both sides of the light microscope.\nCalculate the vitality percentage (%) = (counted viable cells/total cells counted) x 100\n\t\tNOTE: The cell-bioink interaction is studied in two ways: (1) It can be printed by adding it into the bioinks (3D-B; 3D-G); (2) The cells are seeded on the bioinks after being pressed, and the cells form a spheroid (3D-BS; 3D-GS).\nFor the cell-bioink interaction, first create the bioink groups (Table 1). Group 1 includes 3D-B and 3D-G printed with bioink for bioprinting. Group 2 includes 3D-BS and 3D-GS bioinks on which spheroids were formed after bioprinting.",
    "Count the cells for group 1 so that there are approximately 1 x 107 cells in 0.5 mL of medium. Add 4.5 mL of bioink to bring the total volume to 5 mL. Transfer this to the cartridges in the sterile cabinet with the help of syringes. Install the cartridges in the corresponding extruder section of the bioprinter.\nFor the second group, take 5 mL from each of the bioink groups and transfer them to sterile cartridges with the help of an injector.\nUse the bioprinter with two coaxial printheads and the pneumatic-driven extrusion technology. Set the X/Y/Z resolution per microstep to 1.25 µm, the extrusion width to 400 µm, and the extrusion height to 200 µm. A 20 mm x 20 mm x 5 mm grid is one of the most used 3D models for 3D bioprinting work.\nCreate the 3D models using open-source, web-based CAD programs. Before bioprinting, create simple 3D models with one of the open-source platforms (e.g., infill). The model can be linear (like the model used here), honeycomb, or grid-shaped.Export and download in .stl format after creating a 5 mm x 20 mm x 20 mm square.\nThe bioprinter software uses .stl files and converts them to printable .gcode format using slicer modules. To get a printable grid shape, disable the outer shell in the slicer module. Wipe the device with 70% ethanol before operation and then sterilize by UV sterilization.\nFor the bioprinting process, transfer the bioink groups to the cartridges with the help of an injector. Install the cartridges in the corresponding extruder section of the bioprinter.\nSet the average pressure of the 3D printer to 7.5 psi and the cartridge and bed temperature to 37 °C. Set the speed to 60% and carry out a standard 3D printing process.",
    "NOTE: Planning the prepared models with spaces (like a linear model) allows cell culture to be done in the spaces after bioprinting.\nPut the system in the home position during the writing phase. Position the axes (X, Y, Z) automatically, select the extruder, and set.Start the printing process. After the bioprinting process, take the sample and place it under a laminar flow cabinet.\nSpray the bioinks with 0.1 N CaCl2 solution after printing or add 1 mL of the solution with a pipette at room temperature. Wait for about 10-20 s and wash the printed patterns 2x with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nAdd 2 mL of DMEMF-12 with 10% FBS medium on top of each of the cell-containing bioink groups. Incubate the plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Afterward, add 2 mL of suspension medium containing 1 x 106 cells to each group for spheroid formation.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 24 h incubation, observe the spheroid formation under an inverted microscope.\nWJ-MSCs differentiation to neuron-like cells\n\t\nObserve and photograph all batches of bioink after 24 h of incubation. Add 2 mL of neurogenic differentiation medium per well (except for the control group) and refresh every 2 days. Follow for 7 days to observe neural differentiation.\n4. Graphene-Bioink biohybrid hydrogel characterization\nNOTE: Time-lapse imaging, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT/IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses are performed for the characterization of graphene-bioink biohybrid hydrogel. The samples are created from 3D-B and 3D-G bioink groups by the drip method for FT/IR and SEM analysis.\nFT/IR analysis",
    "NOTE: FT/IR is a chemical analytical method based on the mathematical Fourier transform, indispensable for material characterization. Use an FT/IR device based on 28 °C Michelson interferometer principles, with a halogen lamp, water-cooled mercury light source, signal aspect ratio of 4 cm−1, measured for 1 min, at 2,200 cm−1.\n\t\nPrepare the FT/IR microscope and make sure the optics of the instrument are aligned. Calibrate the device.\nSince the sample is in a drop, take a piece of 1-2 mm thick hydrogel and place it with forceps on the sample part. Focus on the sample and raise it until close contact is made. Collect the sample spectrum by starting the process from the system.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis\n\tNOTE: The surface morphology, internal structure, cell distribution, and bioink-cell interactions can be examined by SEM analysis in different dimensions.\n\t\nDrop the hydrogel into 6-well plates containing 1 mL of CaCl2 crosslinker using the pipette tip droplet method (see Figure 1).\nWash the plates 2x with approximately 1 mL of PBS to free the solution of salts. Then, put these drops into a falcon tube containing 5 mL of 5% paraformaldehyde with the help of forceps.\nMake thin sections from the drop bioinks with the help of a scalpel. Stick the samples on the sticky side on the metal plate. Insert into the coating device where the gold palladium, which passes into the plasma phase by replacing the air with argon gas, covers the sample.\nPut it in the electron microscope (SEM). Open the microscope program that the SEM is connected to. Perform the scaling and take images of different parts of the sample. For this protocol, 5 µm, 10 µm, and 200 µm scales were used. A total of 40 images were taken for the 3D-B and 3D-G groups.\nTime-lapse imaging",
    "NOTE: During time-lapse imaging, not only bioink samples containing GFP gene transformed cells were used but also bioinks with spheroids are imaged for 16 h. Time-lapse imaging is performed to examine the effects of graphene on stem cells and to monitor cell interactions within the bioink.\n\t\nAdd commercially available 1 x 107 GFP-labeled MSCs into 5 mL of bioink and bioprint as in step 3.2.11. Add 1 mL of crosslinker, hold for 20-30 s, and wash 2x with PBS.\nTurn on the time-lapse monitor and open the program on the computer. Set approximately 16 h in Time-Lapse mode and set the temperature to 37 °C. Press the Start button. Videos in the form of 40 s time-lapse video samples are recorded by the system.\nFocus the microscope at 10x magnification every 2 h. Also, visualize the spheroids created by following the same steps.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63622/63622fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: 3D-B and 3D-G bioink groups produced as drops for use in characterization.

Determination of neurogenic differentiation by immunostaining method\nCollect the spheroids, without interrupting sphere forms, and reseed into new plates to restain with an easier method, instead of embedding in paraffin for tissue sectioning.\nCover the 48-well plates with about 20 mL of pre-autoclaved 0.1% gelatin solution and keep in an incubator for at least 1 h. Pipette approximately 500 µL of prepared 0.1% gelatin into 48-well plates. Leave the gelatinous plates in the incubator for 10 min.",
    "NOTE: This will allow the gelatin to swell slightly, covering the surface and creating a better environment for the collected spheroids to attach.\nCollect the spheroids by pipetting, distribute the collected spheroids from the incubator into the wells of the 48-well plate, and add fresh medium. Then, incubate for 12-24 h.\n\tNOTE: It is quite difficult to distribute the spheroids by counting. Collect the spheroids in a single tube and evenly distribute the total volume to the wells. For this study, each well contained approximately 4-6 spheroids.\n\tNOTE: For 2D samples, pre-stain washing is sufficient, and no media replacement is required.\nRemove the medium and slowly wash the cells with PBS as the spheroids will be at the top. Fix in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h.\nWash the samples with PBS again and block with about 10 mL of 2% BSA and 0.1% TritonX for 30 min. Then, wash with PBS 3x.\nDilute selected primer antibodies (N-cadherin-rabbit and β-III tubulin-mouse) at a 1:100 ratio with antibody diluent reagent solution. Add 100 µL of antibody solution to each of the samples and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the samples 3x with PBS. Incubate with anti-mouse IgG-FTIC-rabbit for β-III tubulin and anti-mouse IgG-SC2781-goat secondary antibody for N-Cad diluted to 1:200 at room temperature for 30 min. Perform all operations in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Whatever strain is used as the primary antibody (e.g., mouse) in double staining, a different strain (e.g., goat or rabbit) should be used for the secondary antibody.\nWash the secondary antibody with PBS 3x and then drip the DAPI solution (1:1) into each of the samples. Wait for 15-20 min. Perform immunofluorescence imaging.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
