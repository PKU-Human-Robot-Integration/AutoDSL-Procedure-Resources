Pre-surgical Steps",
    "Prior to surgery, the rats are housed under a 12:12 light/dark cycle with free access to water and rodent chow. \nAnesthesia is induced with 4% isoflurane in 100% O2 gas mixture in an induction chamber. \nThe crown of the head is shaved with electric hair clippers. \nThe rat is placed in a prone position on an absorbent pad lying on a temperature-controlled operating surface (thermal blanket) and the head is placed in the stereotactic apparatus starting with placement of the gas anesthetic face mask.\nNext, the ear bars are inserted and tightened.\nDuring the procedure anesthesia is maintained with 2% isoflurane in 100% O2 gas mixture.\nOpthalmic lubricant ointment is applied to both eyes, and the eyelids are closed to prevent eye desiccation during the surgical procedure. \nA rectal temperature probe is inserted to maintain a constant animal core temperature of 37±0.5 °C. \nWith the head of the anesthetized rat held firmly in the stereotaxic device the surgical area is cleansed with alternating chlorhexidine and saline three times. \n2. Pre-cranial Window Preparation\nPrior to creating a cranial window, the rat should be prepared for any experiments by implantation of other required hardware and should receive any required surgical procedures. For this protocol, we have previously implanted a guide cannula for endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced MCAO as shown in a companion publication titled \"Endothelin-1 Induced Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model for Ischemic Stroke with Laser Doppler Flowmetry Guidance in Rat.\"\n3. Creation of the Cranial Window\nAfter placement of a guide cannula or equipment required for experimentation, a cranial window is created to directly visualize proximal portions of the middle cerebral artery during a stroke procedure. \nFirst, scissors are used to incise the skin overlying the temporalis muscle starting medially and working laterally.",
    "The temporalis muscle is bisected using electrocautery and then retracted using 3.0 nylon suture to visualize the squamous portion of the temporal bone. \nAn approximately 3-4 mm square is drawn on the squamous portion of the temporal bone caudal to the orbit and superior to the base of the zygomatic process as it reflects off of the temporal bone. \nA drill is used to gradually cut the outlined piece of bone free from the temporal bone. Care should be taken to avoid applying too much pressure to the drill since it is possible to damage the dura or cerebral cortex.\nFrequent rinses with sterile saline are performed to improve visualization of the surgical field and prevent overheating of the skull.\nStarting at a loose corner, the piece of temoporal bone is carefully removed using fine rat-toothed forceps while making sure not to tear any vessels associated with the dura. \nThe dura is left intact and debris is rinsed away using sterile saline. \n4. Recording of Cerebral Artery Constriction\nTo demonstrate how to capture images in real time, a rat that is undergoing ET-1 induced MCAO is used for this protocol.\nPrior to application of vasoactive compounds, a baseline video should be recorded for at least 1 min. For ET-1 induced MCAO, the baseline recording is made once the needle has been lowered into the brain parenchyma but prior to the ET-1 injection. \nThe syringe pump is started for injection and recorded for 1 hr or until the desired endpoint. The needle is left in place during video recording in order to prevent disturbances of the focal plane. \nThe rat should be deeply anesthetized and euthanized according to an approved protocol following this procedure. \n5. Image Analysis",
    "Vessel diameter can be determined for any part of the visualized MCA. As an example, we will use one branch of the MCA to measure vessel diameter at time-points before and after ET-1 injection. Still frames from the video are captured at 1 min intervals using VLC media player (VideoLAN).\nVLC player is installed and opened. \nBy selecting tools and then preferences, the setting is changed to \"All\" under \"Show settings.\" \nThe \"video menu\" is expanded in the left side bar and \"output modules\" is then expanded. \"Scene filters\" is selected to bring up the scene video filter menu. \n\"Scene\" is typed into the box for filename prefix.\nA directory path prefix is defined. This is where still frames are saved.\nA recording ratio is selected based on the desired rate of still frame capture. If a video was captured at 29 frames per sec, then \"1749\" (29 frames/sec x 60 sec/min) should be entered in the box to save one still frame every 1 min. All changes are then saved.\nThe desired video is then opened in VLC player to automatically save still frames once every 1 min. \nVessel diameter is then measured using these images. First, ImageJ software (NIH) is opened. \nThen the still frames that you will measure are opened in ImageJ. \nBy selecting the \"analyze\" menu, \"set measurements\" is then opened and all boxes are unchecked. \nNext, the straight line tool is selected.\nThe keyboard shortcut \"Ctrl +\" is used to zoom in as needed and a line is placed perpendicular to the vessel path to measure vessel diameter. \nFinally, vessel length is obtained by selecting the \"analyze\" menu and then \"measure\" (ctrl+M) to obtain vessel length. \nThis process is repeated at least three times and averaged for each measured vessel measured in each still frame.",
    "Vessel diameter at each time point is normalized to the baseline vessel diameter so that comparisons can be made using multiple rats. To do this, use the formula current diameter/baseline diameter x 100% to calculate the % baseline diameter of each vessel. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
