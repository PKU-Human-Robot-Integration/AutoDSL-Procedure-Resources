    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEnrichment of mature thymic subsets by negative selection\nTiming: 1 h (Day 1)\nMature subsets CD4 SP, CD8 SP and iNKT cells are a small fraction of cells in the thymus, collectively comprising less than 20% of the cells in this organ (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Thus, it is critical to deplete unwanted cells such as double positive (DP) cells that consist the vast majority of thymocytes. To enrich our sample for mature thymic subsets we employ the method of negative selection. This approach is based on labeling with biotinylated antibodies the unwanted cells. Subsequently, by incubating the mix of cells with streptavidin magnetic beads, only the cells labeled with biotinylated antibodies will be bound to the streptavidin coated magnetic beads. Following a brief incubation of the samples on a magnetic stand, unwanted cells will be attached to the walls of the tubes that are in touch with the magnetic stand. The desired cells, untouched, will be in the supernatant and can be isolated for downstream applications such as cell culture, protein isolation for western blots or DNA/ RNA isolation for subsequent molecular analysis such as genome-wide assays.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2145-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Harvest the thymus from a euthanized mouse. Place the thymus into a 6-well plate (or a 15 mL tube) containing 3 mL TCM and put the 6-well plate on ice.\nObtain single cell suspension by dissociating the thymus:\nTransfer the thymus using clean forceps on a 70 μM cell strainer in a p-60 plate.\nAdd 3 mL TCM and gently dissociate the organ by using the end of the plunger of a 1 mL syringe without a needle.\nCarefully remove the cell strainer to avoid discarding any medium that contains cells.\nNote: After the complete dissociation of the organ the medium will appear cloudy.\nTransfer the TCM containing the thymocytes to a polystyrene tube.\nCritical: If you are processing simultaneously multiple samples make sure to clearly label the tubes to properly identify them.\nPipette the cells thoroughly (at least 10 times) in order to achieve single-cell suspension.\nCount the cells.\nTransfer 10 μL of the sample to 90 μL PBS (1:10 dilution) and count in a Flow Cytometer (for instance Novocyte 3005, ACEA, Agilent).\nAlternatively, prepare a 1:10 dilution of the cells and add Trypan blue (to identify and exclude from our count dead cells). Count the cells using a Neubauer hemocytometer.\nCritical: If you are preparing single stain controls using cells make sure to save some cells at this step. 1–3 million of cells/ single staining control are sufficient. Also, save cells for the unstained control.\nStain cells with biotinylated antibodies that recognize proteins expressed on the surface of unwanted cells that you aim to deplete. In this case, we stained 150–200 million cells to deplete CD24+ cells and any contaminating erythrocytes.\nCentrifuge the cells at 453 × g, 5 min, 4°C. Carefully remove supernatant using an aspirator.",
    "Resuspend the cells in the appropriate volume of FACS buffer using a 5-mL pipette to achieve a concentration of 1∗108 cells per mL.\nNote: The volume that can be used ranges from 0.1–8 mL. For instance, If the starting number of cells is 150 million, resuspend the cells in 1.5 mL FACS buffer. If the starting amount is 200 million, resuspend the cells in 2 mL FACS buffer. Transfer the cells to a polystyrene round-bottom tube.\nNote: The total amount of cells that can be processed depends on the magnet.\nIf you are using a magnet that can hold only a standard 12 × 75 mm (5 mL) polystyrene tube such as the Easysep Magnet (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no.: 18000) you can process from 107 up to 2 × 108 cells, resuspended cells in a volume of 0.1–2 mL of buffer respectively. However, if you have access to a magnet that can hold 15 mL tubes such as the Big Easy magnet (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 18001) or the EasyEights EasySep magnet (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. no. 18103) you can process per tube up to 8.5 × 108 cells resuspended in 8.5 mL of buffer.\nAdd 50 μL of Rat Serum that is thawed and has reached a temperature of 22°C in 1 mL of FACS buffer containing 100 million cells.\nFor instance, in 1.5 mL FACS buffer containing 150 million thymocytes, add 75 μL Rat serum.\nCarefully mix.\nAdd 3 μg/mL of the biotinylated anti-CD24 antibody and 1 μg /mL anti-Ter119 (to label erythrocytes).\nMix well the samples.\nNote: The amount of the biotinylated antibodies to use is determined by the abundance of cells that we aim to deplete. As a general guideline, consider the following:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2145_7.csv",
    "It is recommended to titrate the antibody/ antibodies of interest to ensure optimal enrichment of the target population and depletion of unwanted cells.\nIncubate the sample at 22°C for 10 min.\nNote: Optionally, to ensure optimal mixing, one can incubate the samples with gentle shaking.\nBind the labeled cells with biotinylated antibodies to magnetic streptavidin beads (e.g., mouse streptavidin beads EASYSEP RapidSpheres, from STEMCELL Technologies).\nAdd 100 μL RapidSpheres per mL of sample. Mix and incubate at 22°C for 2.5 min.\nCritical: Beads will settle gradually. Just before use, resuspend thoroughly the magnetic streptavidin RapidSpheres by vortexing them for 30 s. Ensure that the solution is homogeneous before aspirating the desired volume of beads.\nNote: The incubation can be performed with gentle shaking to ensure optimal mixing.\nNote: The amount of magnetic streptavidin RapidSpheres is determined based on the abundance of cells that we aim to deplete. Per the manufacturer, when the unwanted cells to be depleted are more than 30% of the total cells in the sample, the quantity of beads to be used is within the range of 75–125 μL of RapidSpheres/ mL.\nAttach the beads and the bound cells to the magnet.\nAdd FACS buffer up to 2.5 mL to each tube. Mix by pipetting 2–3 times.\nPlace the tube on the magnet (without the cap) and incubate for 2.5 min.\nAt this point you should be able to see the brown, magnetic streptavidin beads (RapidSpheres) retained on the wall of the tube that is in touch with the magnet.\nFor our experimental purpose, the cells that we aim to deplete are the vast majority of the sample. Thus, the supernatant becomes substantially less cloudy at this point. This is an indication that the enrichment has worked efficiently.",
    "Collect the supernatant that contains unbound, enriched CD24- mature thymic subsets.\nCount the cells. Typically, at this step we obtain 4–7 million cells that consist of approximately 50%–60% CD4 SP cells.\nKeep on ice while you prepare the next steps.\nIsolation of pure thymic subsets by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)\nTiming: 1 h to prepare samples (Day 1)\nWhile in the previous step we enriched for mature thymic subsets, our sample is still heterogeneous, containing distinct T cell lineages with unique molecular and functional characteristics. By combining antibodies conjugated with distinct fluorophores we can distinguish and isolate these subsets by FACS sorting and use the pure populations in downstream applications of our choice.\nSorting time varies. Estimate around 40 min for 10 million cells starting material.\nStain the cells using the desired cell surface staining master mix.\nMake sure to include a compatible viability dye, such as fixable viability dye conjugated with eFluor780, to exclude dead cells during sorting.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2145_8.csv\nPrepare the master mix in FACS buffer before use.\nStain up to 3 million cells in 100 μL of antibody master mix in a 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate cells at 4°C for 30 min.\nWash two times with ice cold FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 453 × g at 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant using a P1000 pipette, making sure not to disturb the pellet.\nResuspend cells in 500 μL FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 453 × g at 4°C. Repeat the steps i-iv once more.\nResuspend in appropriate volume to achieve the recommended concentration suggested by your Flow Cytometry core.\nNote: For our experiments we resuspend 10 × 106 cells/ mL FACS buffer.\nFilter cells using a round bottom tube with cell strainer cap.",
    "Critical: Filtering the cells is crucial prior to FACS-sorting in order to remove aggregates that might end up clogging the machine. In addition, running samples that contain single-cell suspension is instrumental for acquiring optimal signal.\nProceed with the FACS sorting using a 70 μm nozzle.\nPrepare collection tubes containing FBS (or other collection medium of choice).\nNote: Adding serum optimizes viability of the sorted cells.\nMake sure that the adaptor for the collection tubes is pre-chilled to make sure that the sorted cells are continuously kept at 4°C throughout the process.\nDuring sorting, record approximately 5,000 events from the sample.\nSet up the gates to exclude doublets and dead cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2145-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sorting strategy of enriched mature thymic subsets and purity assessment of sorted CD4 SP cells\n(A) Representative flow cytometry plots demonstrate the gating strategy to sort for live, mature (enriched for CD24 depleted) thymic subsets. From left to right: Thymocytes are gated, doublets are excluded and single cells are selected. Live cells are determined and dead cells are excluded based on staining with viability discrimination dye. iNKT cells are identified as aGalCer-CD1d tetramer+ and TCRβ intermediate cells. Then, gating on TCRβ+ aGalCer-CD1d tetramer negative cells, CD8 SP cells and CD4 SP cells are identified based on surface expression of CD4 and CD8 cells. In this example CD4 SP cells are sorted.\n(B) Representative flow cytometry plots depict the steps to evaluate purity of the sorted CD4 SP samples.\nSet the gates to sort for the desired mature thymic subsets e.g., iNKT cells, CD4 SP or CD8 SP cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAfter sorting, run a small amount of your sample (record 5,000 events) to assess purity and cell viability.\nNote: Typically, for our samples we get a minimum of 98% purity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Note: If cell numbers are limited or if you are sorting at single-cell level this is not applicable.\nAssessing gene expression by RNA sequencing\nTiming: 2 days total\nTiming: 45 min (Day 1) for step 10\nTiming: 30–45 min if you run an entire chip in the Bioanalyzer, can be performed at Day 2 or later (for step 11)\nTiming: 2 h for step 12\nTiming: 50–60 min for step 13\nTiming: 1 h for step 14\nThe goal of this step is to isolate total RNA from the sorted subsets and generate cDNA using the (SMART)-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit protocol for sequence. The advantage of this approach is that one can start with only 10 ng of total RNA. To prepare our libraries we utilized the Switching Mechanism at 5′ End of RNA Template (SMART)-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit[href=https://www.takarabio.com/a/114896] for sequencing (Takara, Clontech) that offers a straightforward approach to prepare RNAseq libraries when starting with low amount of RNA (we started with 10 ng of material but the protocol can work with as little as 10 pg of starting RNA). Depending on the starting RNA material it is critical to optimize the number of PCR amplification cycles. Too few will compromise the yield, whereas over-amplification will compromise the complexity of the library, resulting in an excess of duplicate reads that will be discarded from the subsequent analysis.\nIsolate total RNA.\nOnce the cells are sorted and their purity is confirmed, count the cells to obtain a precise quantification of the retrieved material.",
    "Note: Based on the number of retrieved cells one can determine the optimal RNA isolation method. For starting material equal or larger than 1 million cells we utilize the RNA plus mini kit (QIAGEN). For lower amount of starting material, one can use the RNA plus micro kit (QIAGEN). Typically, we have used mainly the RNA plus micro kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=e112adfa-cc06-4e29-87f8-4820062ae44e&lang=en] (QIAGEN).\nCritical: Typically, after sorting, the core facilities provide a cell count for each cell sample. While this count is most of the times an accurate estimate, it is important for downstream molecular applications to measure the cells just before the experimental procedure to get a precise number and design the best isolation strategy.\nNote: If the desired cell population is limited, one can directly sort the cells in lysis buffer.\nNote: The QIAGEN RNA plus kits provide columns that eliminate DNA in a fast and efficient manner. Alternatively, if a kit that is not providing these columns is used, DNase can be used to eliminate DNA.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 200 × g at 4°C for 5 min.\nWash once with ice-cold PBS and centrifuge the cells at 200 x g at 4°C. We will describe the RNA isolation process for 500,000 cells or less (using the micro RNA kit).\nCritical: Ideally, one can work on a dedicated clean bench or a clean room. If that option is not available, make sure to clean the bench and the pipettes with RNase ZAP.\nResuspend thoroughly the cell pellet in 350 μL RLT plus (provided in the RNA plus kit) containing 10 μL of β mercaptoethanol that was added just before the RNA isolation.\nTransfer the material to a DNA eliminating column (provided by the manufacturer).",
    "Centrifuge at speed higher than 8,000 × g (we typically perform this step at 9,600 × g) for 30 s at 22°C.\nDiscard the column (contains the bound DNA) and save the flow-through.\nAdd equal volume of 70% ethanol and carefully mix using the 1 mL pipette.\nThen transfer the mix (700 μL) to a new RNA isolation column (easily identifiable by pink color).\nNote: The RNA isolation columns of the RNA plus micro kit are stored at 4°C until they are used.\nCentrifuge at 9,600 × g for 30 s. Discard the flow through.\nWash the column with 700 μL RW1 buffer. Centrifuge at 9,600 × g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.\nWash with 500 μL ERP buffer. Centrifuge at 9,600 × g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.\nRepeat the wash with 500 μL 80% Ethanol. Discard the flow-through.\nPlace the column in a new, clean collection tube (provided) and centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min.\nCritical: This step is described as optional by the manufacturer, but we highly recommend to dry the membrane before eluting the RNA, to ensure that you remove any residual ethanol that might interfere with downstream enzymatic reactions.\nPlace the dried column to a new 1.5 mL certified DNase/ RNase free tube (provided).\nNote: Alternatively, if preferred, one might use low binding tubes at this step to ensure minimal loss of the desired material.\nApply directly to the membrane 13 μL of RNase free water (provided). Incubate for 1 min.\nThen centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Discard the column.\nStore the RNA at −80°C until you perform further analysis.\nNote: At this point, it is recommended to aliquot around 3 μL of RNA to perform quality control (step 11) to avoid multiple freeze/ thaw cycles of the RNA.",
    "Pause point: RNA can be stored at −80°C indefinitely.\nAssess quality and quantity of total RNA.\nThaw the RNA samples.

The Agilent High sensitivity RNA screen tape and reagents for Agilent Tapestation were used. Note that the trace for intact RNA (in this case RIN=9.7) exhibits two characteristic peaks corresponding to 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA.\nNote: Especially if you are using Bioanalyzer, timing is critical for the successful outcome of the experiment. Make sure to follow with precision the incubation times recommended by the manufacturer.\nCritical: For our assays we are using RNA samples with a minimum RNA integrity number (RIN[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/applications/5989-1165EN.pdf]) value equal to at least 9. However, some samples are more prone to degradation. In that case you might consider starting with RNA with less RIN value. The higher the RIN value is the higher the success rate and the quality of the prepared libraries are.\nFirst strand cDNA synthesis.\nNote: We used SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit[href=https://www.takarabio.com/a/114896] for sequencing (Clontech) to prepare the libraries. The first part is First strand cDNA synthesis.\nCritical: Perform the described reactions in a dedicated RNA bench that we clean with RNaseZap before we start the procedures. We recommend using dedicated pipettes and tube racks that we are thoroughly cleaned before the experiments.",
    "Thaw the 5× Ultra Low First-Strand Buffer at 22°C. Precipitates might form.\nNote: Vortex the buffer to ensure that all the components are properly mixed and a homogeneous solution is formed. Nuclease free water can also be thawed at room temperature. The rest of the materials required for the first strand cDNA synthesis must be gradually thawed on ice. Specifically, in a container with ice, place the following: 10× lysis buffer, 10× reaction buffer, 3′ SMART-Seq CDS Primer II A, SMART-Seq v4 Oligonucleotide. The RNAse inhibitor and the SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase are to be stored at the −20°C until they are used.\nNote: We recommend placing the SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase in a −20°C portable cooler (e.g., Nalgene) and use the enzyme directly from there to minimize exposure to room temperature that may compromise the enzymatic activity.\nPrepare a 10× Reaction buffer by mixing 19 μL of 10× Lysis buffer with 1 μL of RNase Inhibitor to a total of 20 μL 10× Reaction buffer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2145_9.csv\nMix gently to avoid forming bubbles and spin down. Store on ice.\nPrepare your samples in 0.2 mL pcr tubes (nuclease free certified) as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2145_10.csv\nPlace the tubes on a rack on ice.\nAdd 2 μL of the thawed 3′ SMART-Seq CDS Primer II A (12 μM).\nVortex gently to ensure a homogeneous solution. Spin down the tubes.\nNote: At this step the total volume of the reaction is 12.5 μL.\nIncubate the tubes at a thermocycler at 72°C for 3 min.\nCritical: Make sure that the lid has been preheated so that the reaction starts immediately.\nWhile the tubes are incubating at 72°C prepare the mix for the cDNA synthesis reaction.",
    "Critical: Make sure to calculate enough volume for all your samples. As a rule of thumb, prepare 10% more of the total volume needed to ensure you will have sufficient mix for all your tubes.\nThe volume needed per reaction is:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2145_11.csv\nImmediately after the completion of the 3 min incubation at 72°C, place the tubes on ice. Incubate for 2 min.\nDuring the 2 min incubation period, add to the master mix 2 μL per reaction, plus 10%, of the SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase.\nNote: The volume would be 2.2 μL.\nCritical: Add the enzyme immediately before use. Gently mix the reverse transcriptase enzyme, just before you add this to the master mix. Then spin down.\nTransfer 7.5 μL of the mix to each tube. Carefully mix the content of each tube by pipetting. Spin the tubes briefly. The total volume of the cDNA synthesis reaction is 20 ul.\nTransfer tubes to a thermal cycle with the pre-heated lid set at 42°C. Use the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2145_12.csv\nPause point: The tubes, containing cDNA, can be safely stored at 4°C or at −20°C overnight.\nNext, the cDNA will be amplified using PCR Primer II A. The Primer II A identifies and amplifies SMART sequences that were introduced in the previous steps by 3′ SMART-seq CDS primer IIA and the SMARTseq V4 oligonucleotide.\nCritical: Determining the number of PCR cycles depends on the amount of starting RNA. As we started with 10 ng of RNA we performed 8 cycles of PCR amplification. It is crucial not to overamplify the cDNA at this step to ensure complexity of the libraries. It is highly recommended to check the optimal yield for the cells that you use before determining the exact amount of PCR amplification samples to perform.",
    "Prepare the master mix for the PCR amplification reaction.\nCalculate the amount of reactions needed and prepare an additional 10% to ensure that there will be sufficient amount of mix for all the samples.\nMix the following reagents/ reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2145_13.csv\nCritical: Thaw the reagents on ice. Add the SeqAmp polymerase just before the reaction.\nAdd 30 μL of the master mix to the tube containing first strand cDNA (from step 12m) for a total volume of 50 μL.\nMix the content of the tubes and spin down.\nRun the following program in a thermocycler with heated lid:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2145_14.csv\nPause point: The tubes can be safely stored at 4°C overnight.\nCritical: The precise number of PCR amplification cycles is determined by the amount of starting total RNA and also the quality (evaluated as integrity at the quality control step) of the isolated RNA. For our purposes, we start with 10 ng of total RNA and high integrity (RIN value above 9). If the quantity is limited and the starting material is less or if obtaining RNA of high integrity is challenging then the amount of cycles should be increased.\nWe recommend to carefully define the optimal amount of cycles for your type of cells and the quality of total RNA that you can obtain before you proceed with large scale experiments. Determining the optimal amount of PCR amplification cycles is instrumental for the success of the experiment. While too few cycles might result in low yield and insufficient amount of library for sequencing, overamplification compromises the complexity of the library and results in duplicate reads that will be discarded at the analysis step.\nPurify the amplified cDNA.\nAdd 1 μL of 10× lysis buffer to each reaction.\nPurify the cDNA using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman).",
    "Critical: Make sure to bring the beads (stored at 4°C) at room temperature for a minimum of 30 min before use.

    "Critical: It is essential to dry the beads but at the same time you should make sure not to overdry these, as this may reduce the yield of the eluted DNA. Overdried beads appear cracked.\nRemove the beads from the magnetic stand and add 17 μL elution buffer.\nResuspend the beads in the elution buffer by pipetting up and down for 10 times.\nIncubate for 2 min at 22°C to allow rehydration of beads.\nSpin down.\nPlace on magnet and allow to stand for 2 min.\nNote: Make sure that the supernatant appears clear.\nCollect the supernatant (that contains the amplified DNA) and transfer to a low binding tube.\nPause point: The DNA can be stored at −20°C until quality control and sequencing.\nQuantify the libraries and perform quality control check.\nProceed to quantification and quality control.

    "This protocol describes a method to study the genome-wide binding of a transcription factor in FACS sorted, highly pure, murine CD4 SP cells. CUT&RUN allows to start with limited number of cells,4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] making it an ideal technique for studies with primary, less abundant populations such as mature thymic subsets. We used the CUTANA ChIC CUT&RUN kit[href=https://www.epicypher.com/cutana-cut-and-run-kit/] provided by EpiCypher and we modified the instructions provided in the CUTANA ChIC CUT&RUN kit manual[href=https://www.epicypher.com/content/documents/manuals/cut-and-run-kit_2.1.pdf] in order to be applicable for sorted T cells. Briefly, in this method, the antibody of interest is added to intact cells, which have been previously immobilized in 96 well plates.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Following the antibody incubation, cells are incubated with a fusion of Protein A and Protein G to Micrococcal Nuclease (pAG-MNase), which bind on the antibody of interest and cleave the chromatin around it. The cleaved DNA is released and purified using DNA Cleanup Columns. Since the quantity of the cleaved DNA is low, library preparation is modified for a low amount of initial DNA input as well as to retain very small DNA fragments (50–70 bp).6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] However, CUT&RUN can be also used to map histone modifications. In that case, the goal is to isolate larger fragments since the distribution of histones across the genome is broader, compared to the focal binding to the DNA of transcription factors.",
    "For these experiments, we used 5∗105 CD4-SP cells as starting material. However, if the starting material is limited, fewer cells can be used. Alternatively, cells from more than one mouse can be pooled. To assess the non-specific signal of our antibody of interest, we used a non-specific antibody that is in the same isotype as our antibody. For each experiment, the antibody of interest and the control antibody were added to samples from the same mouse donor. For each experiment, we used a minimum of two biological replicates for the antibody of interest.

    "Capture the protein of interest and the bound DNA by adding 0.5 μg of GATA3 (clone: D13C9) XP Rabbit mAb (antibody of interest) to the corresponding sample.\nNote: For the GATA3 antibody, check the precise concentration of the antibody listed in the “Certificate of analysis” on the right side of the product’s webpage[href=https://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/gata-3-d13c9-xp-rabbit-mab/5852]. If you are using a previous lot, contact the Technical support[href=https://www.cellsignal.com/learn-and-support/order-support] to ensure the precise concentration.\n0.5 μg of the IgG control antibody is added to the other sample.\nNote: For the IgG control, if you are using the CUTANA rabbit IgG CUT&RUN negative control antibody (Cat # 13-0042) prepare 1 mg/mL working stock dilution in antibody buffer. Add 0.5 μL of antibody in 50 μL antibody buffer.\nIf you are using the CUTANA ChIC/CUT&RUN Kit, the rabbit IgG antibody (negative control) is provided at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL so you can add 1 μL of antibody in 50 μL antibody buffer.\nNote: Mix each sample by gently pipetting. Use a P200 pipette by setting it to 40 μL.\nNote: It is important to use CUT&RUN validated antibodies if available. Keep in mind that an antibody that is validated for ChIP-seq experiments may not work well for CUT&RUN. We used 0.5 μg as suggested by the EpiCypher. However, for other antibodies, one might need to titrate the quantity of the antibody to determine the optimal concentration.\nCritical: The control antibody must be in the same concentration as the antibody of interest.\nIncubate the samples for 1 h at 4°C.\nNote: We have also tested overnight incubation. However, when we sequenced the libraries the enrichment for GATA3 peaks compared to the IgG control was very low.
