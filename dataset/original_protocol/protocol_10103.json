    "Human kidneys were isolated by LifeCenter Northwest following ethical guidelines set by the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations. This protocol follows animal care and cell culture guidelines outlined by the University of Washington.\n1. Preparation of Human Kidney Tissue\nPreparation of decellularization solution\n\t\nSterilize a 5000 mL beaker and a 70 x 10 mm stir bar.\nMix 1:1000 (weight:volume) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in autoclaved deionized water in the beaker. Leave the solution on a stir plate at approximately 200 rpm for 24 h or until the SDS is completely dissolved.\n\t\tNote: Typically, 2500 mL of 1% SDS solution is sufficient to decellularize a single human kidney.\nTransfer the solution to a 500 mL sterile vacuum filter and filter it into sterilized sealable containers.\nProcessing of kidney tissue\n\t\nWash and autoclave a pair of forceps, two hemostat clamps, a pair of general service grade scissors, two scalpel blade handles, a 1000 mL beaker covered with aluminum foil, and a 36 x 9 mm stir bar.\nLine a tissue culture hood with underpad. Place the beaker, a sterile tissue culture dish (150 x 25 mm), and the whole kidney organ into the hood. Fill the beaker with 500 mL of 1% SDS solution.\n\t\tNote: Human kidneys were received on ice from LifeCenter NorthWest.\nPlace the kidney in the sterile tissue culture dish (Figure 1A). Remove all perirenal fat by lightly shaving around the renal capsule with a scalpel (Figure 1B).\nMake a shallow 8-10 cm incision with the scalpel, just deep enough to break open the renal capsule without damaging the underlying cortex tissue, across the superior end of the kidney. Remove the renal capsule by peeling it away from the cortex tissue with two hemostat clamps (Figure 1C).",
    "Bisect the kidney along the coronal plane by using the scalpel along the lateral side of the kidney (Figure 1D). Isolate cortex tissue from both halves by carving out the medullar region with the scalpel (Figure 1E) and dice the cortex tissue into 0.5 cm3 pieces (Figure 1F). Remove any large visible vessels.\nIsolation of extracellular matrix\n\t\nIn a tissue culture hood, fill a 1000 mL beaker with 500 mL of 1% SDS solution. Place the diced cortex tissue and stir bar into the beaker containing SDS solution. Cover the beaker with autoclaved aluminum foil and place it on a stir plate at approximately 400 rpm outside of the tissue culture hood.\nAfter the cortex tissue has been on the stir plate for 24 h, bring the beaker into a tissue culture hood and add a 40 µm sterile cell strainer made with nylon mesh. Fill a separate 1000 mL beaker with 200 mL of bleach and place it in the tissue culture hood.\nPipette out the SDS solution through the cell strainer into the beaker containing bleach. Pipette out all SDS solution until only decellularized tissue and the cell strainer remain in the beaker.\n\t\tNote: The cell strainer should prevent any tissue from being removed during solution aspiration.\nLeave the cell strainer in the beaker and fill with 500 mL of fresh SDS solution. Cover the beaker with the same aluminum foil and place onto a stir plate at the same speed as before.\nRepeat steps 1.3.1-1.3.3 every 24 hours with fresh SDS solution for a total of five days.\nRinse decellularized tissue with autoclaved DI water every 24 h for 3 days total, following the technique outlined in steps 1.3.1-1.3.3.",
    "Rinse decellularized tissue with cell culture grade water every 24 h for 2 days total, following the technique outlined in steps 1.3.1-1.3.3.\nRepeat steps 1.3.1-1.3.2. Transfer the decellularized tissue (referred to as kECM from this point on) into a 30 mL self-standing conical tube and fill it with cell culture grade water until all the tissue is submerged.\n2. Fabrication of Hydrogel Stock Solution\nMechanical processing of decellularized tissue\n\t\nIn a tissue culture hood, mechanically homogenize the kECM within the conical tube with a tissue homogenizer for 2 min.\n\t\tNote: Homogenized kECM should resemble an opaque solution with no visible pieces of ECM.\nSubmerge the conical tube containing the kECM in liquid nitrogen until boiling surrounding the tube no longer persists. Store the kECM at -4 ˚C overnight.\nLyophilization of frozen decellularized tissue\n\t\nSlightly loosen the conical tube cap to allow for gas exchange and place the tube into a lyophilization machine. Lyophilize the kECM for three days or until it resembles a fine white powder. Store at -4 ˚C.\nChemical digestion and solubilization of gel\n\t\nAutoclave a 20 mL scintillation vial and cap, a 15.9 x 7.9 mm stir bar, and one pair of fine-tip forceps.\nWeigh the lyophilized kECM and calculate the volume of HCl and mass of pepsin needed to solubilize the kECM to a 3% (30 mg/mL) solution using the following equations, where mpepsin is the mass of pepsin, mtissue is the mass of lyophilized tissue, and VHCl is the volume of 0.01 N HCl:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58314/58314eq1.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58314/58314eq2.jpg",
    "In a tissue culture hood, add porcine gastric pepsin, 0.01 N HCl, and the stir bar to the scintillation vial, and leave it on a stir plate at approximately 500 rpm until all the pepsin has dissolved. Transfer the lyophilized kECM to the scintillation vial and leave the solution on a stir plate at approximately 500 rpm for three days.\n3. Hydrogel Gelation\nKidney ECM hydrogel preparation\n\t\nGel the hydrogel by mixing the kECM hydrogel stock solution with 1 N NaOH, 10x Media Supplement (M199), and cell culture media. Keep all the solutions on ice.\n\t\tNote: Final gel concentrations of 7.5 mg/mL were used for cell culture. 1 mL of kECM gel was sufficient for cell culture experiments presented.\nDetermine the volume of workable kECM gel produced and volume of stock kECM hydrogel needed by using the following equation, where Vfinal is the volume of gel created, Vstock kECM is the volume of stock kECM hydrogel needed, Cstock kECM is the concentration of the stock kECM hydrogel, and Cfinal is the concentration of the final gel:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58314/58314eq3v2.jpg\nDetermine the volume of neutralizing reagents needed by using the following equations, where VNaOH is the volume of 1 N NaOH, V10X is the volume of M199 10X media supplement, and V1X is the volume of cell culture media:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58314/58314eq4.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58314/58314eq5.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58314/58314eq6.jpg\nIn a tissue culture hood, pipette the neutralizing reagents (NaOH, M199, and cell culture media) into a sterile 30 mL self-standing conical tube. Mix the neutralizing reagent solution with a microspatula.\nUse a sterile 1 mL syringe to transfer the appropriate volume of stock kECM hydrogel to the neutralizing reagent solution. Use a microspatula to gently mix the solution until a homogeneous in color hydrogel solution is obtained.\n\t\tNote: Avoid introducing air bubbles by stirring slowly and gently.",
    "To incorporate cells into the kECM hydrogel, subtract 10 µL of cell culture media (V1X) from the neutralizing solution volume calculations in step 3.1.1.3.\n\t\t\nSuspend cells into 10 µL of cell culture media. Determine the number of cells to be suspended by using the following equation, where #cells implies the number of cells to suspend and Vfinal is the volume of gel created:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58314/58314eq7.jpg\n\t\t\tNote: 300,000 cells/mL is the concentration of cells used in the kECM gel.\nPipette the 10 µL of cell suspended solution into the final kECM gel after the kECM stock solution has been mixed with neutralizing reagent solution. Stir the solution with a microspatula until the cells are evenly distributed.\nUse a 1 mL syringe to fill a desired cell culture device with the kECM hydrogel.\nAllow the gel to set at 37 ˚C for 1 h before transferring or plating cells.\nSubscription Required.
