    "All mouse experiments were carried out under the Hebrew University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol MD-21-16429-5. In addition, the Hebrew University is certified by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).\n1. Cell line maintenance\nNOTE: The human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231) were used in this protocol.\nCulture all the breast cancer cell lines in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified carbon dioxide (5% CO2) incubator.\n\t​NOTE: Check the cell density regularly; split and expand for future usage when they reach 70% confluency.\n2. Virus preparation\nTreat the HEK293T cells with 1 mL of trypsin until they detach.\nAdd 10 mL of DMEM (10% FBS) to neutralize the trypsin activity, and transfer the cell suspension to a new 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 150 × g for 5 min to sediment the cells. Discard the supernatant after the centrifugation and add 1 mL of fresh DMEM medium.\nDetermine the cell concentration and seed 1.2 × 106 cells/well in a six-well plate.\nOn the following day, prewarm all the necessary reagents, including transfection reagent, serum-free DMEM, envelope plasmid (VSV-G), lentivirus packaging plasmid (ΔVPR), and pLX304 Luciferase-V5 blast plasmid or FUW GFP plasmid.\nIn a 1.5 mL autoclaved centrifuge tube, mix 50 µL of serum-free DMEM with 0.3 µg of VSV-G plasmid, 1 µg of ΔVPR, and 1.2 µg of pLX304 Luciferase-V5 blast plasmid or FUW GFP plasmid.\nAfter thoroughly mixing these plasmids with the medium, add 5 µL of the transfection reagent, mix gently, and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 15 min.\nFollowing incubation, add the mixture dropwise to the HEK293T cells.",
    "After 24 h, replace the growth medium with 2 mL of (30% FBS) DMEM. On the following day (48 h post-transfection), harvest the medium containing the viruses (\"pLX304 Luciferase-V5 or the FUW GFP viruses\").\n\tNOTE: The use of 30% FBS enhances the virus production efficiency.\nTo avoid any HEK293T cell residues, pass the virus-containing medium through a 0.45 µm syringe filter or centrifuge at 150 × g for 5 min, and collect the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: For long-term storage, keep the working aliquots of the virus at -80 °C.\n3. Establishing cells stably expressing GFP and luciferase (\"GFP  + Luc+ cells\")\nThe day before infecting the cells, seed 8 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate.\nAfter overnight incubation, replace the growth medium with fresh medium containing 8 µg/mL of polybrene. Add 200 µL of FUW GFP viruses dropwise to the cells.\nOptional: To enhance the virus efficiency, centrifuge the plate at 560 × g for 30 min (37 °C) (spin infection).\nIncubate the cells for 48 h, and verify the GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy.\nSort the GFP-expressing cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (GFP+) (Figure 1A).\nInfect the GFP-sorted cells with the pLX304 Luciferase-V5 blast viruses as described in step 3.2.\nTreat the cells with blasticidin (10 µg/mL) 30 h post-infection to enrich for pLX304 Luciferase-V5 blast-expressing cells (GFP+, Luc+ cells). Then, every two days, replace with fresh medium containing blasticidin. Additionally, as a control, treat naïve cells with the same blasticidin-containing medium.",
    "NOTE: A clear difference between the infected and control cells should be observed after a few days of blasticidin treatment. This effect is cell line-dependent and usually takes ~8-10 days. A poor survival rate will indicate a low viral production yield. If so, produce a new batch of viruses as low efficiency may affect future experiments.\n4. Validating in vitro luciferase activity\nGrow the MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 GFP+ Luc+ cells in a 15 cm plate to 80% confluency. Harvest the cells by trypsinization, as described in steps 2.1-2.2.\nSeed an increasing number of cells in each well (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 × 104) into a black 96-well plate.\n\tNOTE: Black 96-well plates are more suited for measuring luciferase levels as white or transparent plates will produce autoluminescence signals. As a control, use phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone in one well to ensure there is no autoluminescence from PBS.\nFill all the wells with 100 µL of DMEM and incubate for 16-24 h.\nPrepare luciferin solution in PBS at a 1.5 mg/mL concentration from the stock of 30 mg/mL. Aliquot the stock of luciferin solution and store at -20 °C.\nWash the cells once with PBS gently, add 100 µL of luciferin solution into each well, and wait for 2 min. Finally, measure the luciferase activity in all the breast cancer cells using bioluminescence.\n\tNOTE: Examining in vitro GFP and luciferase expression prior to animal experiments is crucial. Additionally, blank wells are used to subtract the background.\n5. Injecting mice with GFP+ Luc+ cells\nTransfer 5 × 106 (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468) or 2 × 106 (MDA-MB-231) GFP+ Luc+ cells into 200 µL or 100 µL PBS, respectively.",
    "Before injection, clean the sterile biological hood with 5% disinfectant solution (see the Table of Materials). Then, anesthetize the mice with filtered (0.2 µm) air containing 4% isoflurane at an airflow rate of 1 L/min for 2−3 min.\n\tNOTE: It is essential to confirm proper anesthetization; pinch the mouse's toe and look for any response.\nPlace a cone over the anesthetized mouse head in a supine position. Apply vet ointment to its eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nWipe the abdominal area of the mouse, above the mammary gland, with ethanol using a cotton swab and lift the 4th mammary gland with forceps.\nInsert the needle 27 G x 3/4 (0.4 x 19 mm) under the fat pad and slowly inject 100 µL of the cell suspension.\n\tNOTE: A round bulge will appear under the skin. In addition, an improper injection may lead to deviation in the tumor growth rate or absence of tumor in the same experimental group.\nAfter the injection procedure, take the mice out of the hood and transfer them to a new cage. Monitor the mice until they return to consciousness.\n\t​NOTE: Ensure that all the used needles and syringes are discarded in the sharps box.\n6. Measuring the luciferase levels in GFP+ Luc+ mice\nBefore the bioluminescence detection, restrain the conscious mouse by holding its neck with the left hand. Then, tilt the hand to the left, resulting in the mouse face upward with the lower body in a supine position.\nInject 100 µL of luciferin (30 mg/mL) intraperitoneally (i.p.) into the abdominal surface of the mouse in the lower-left abdominal quadrant using a 1.0 mL syringe with needle size 27 G x 3/4 (0.4 x 19 mm).",
    "NOTE: The tip of the needle should not be inserted more than 3-5 mm from the abdominal wall, as it might penetrate visceral organs. Additionally, it is recommended to perform i.p. injection without anesthesia as luciferin distribution in the body of anesthetized mice is slower than in conscious mice. Thus, monitoring luciferase levels in conscious mice is a faster procedure.\nKeep the mouse for 7 min without anesthesia followed by 3 min within the anesthesia chamber before measuring the tumor kinetics.\n\tNOTE: The incubation time varies between the different experiments, cell lines, and species to species. Thus, it is recommended to calibrate the incubation time before starting the experiments.\nAnesthetize the mice as described in steps 5.2-5.3.\nOpen the software (Table of Materials) during the incubation, initialize the imaging system, and click the Initialize button.\n\tNOTE: Be aware that the camera will take ~10 min to cool down and reach -90 °C. Additionally, as background control, measure the luciferase levels in naïve mice (i.e., GFP+ mice injected with cells that do not express the luciferase gene).\nKeep the setup in auto exposure using the following settings: exposure time auto, 60 s; Binning Medium, F/Stop 1; Excitation filter blocked; Emission filter open. When Initialization ends, select Imaging Wizard | Bioluminescence and then click Next | Open Filter | select Mouse in the image subject.\nIn Field View, select stage C (10 cm) and Subject Height: 1.50 cm.\nClick Image Setup Stage to C, and before clicking the Acquire button, ensure that the mouse is placed on the stage in the proper supine position.\nClose the door, click the Acquire button, and wait for an image to appear on the screen.",
    "NOTE: With the Auto-Exposure option, a strong signal takes 5-20 s depending on the signal; a weak signal will take around 60 s.\nRepeat this step for the other mice.\nTo detect lung metastasis, cover the strong signal of the primary tumor using thick black cardboard paper and expose only the ventral side of the lungs towards the camera. Capture the image using the same parameters described above.\n7. Acquiring ex vivo image using bioluminescence and fluorescence\nEuthanize the mice using carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation in the desiccator and dissect the mice using autoclaved scissors and forceps.\nPerfuse the mice using 0.9% saline, harvest the organs, and rinse with 1x PBS to eliminate bloodstains from the organ.\nTransfer the rinsed organ to a Petri dish and place it into the stage of the bioluminescence machine. Apply the same bioluminescence setting as described in steps 6.2-6.6.\n\tNOTE: Due to the decrease in luciferase signal, this step is time-limiting. Thus, after euthanizing mice, immediately visualize the organ by bioluminescence.\nFor GFP images, apply the same setting as described in step 6.3, using Fluorescence GFP filter instead of Bioluminescence.\nTake lung images using a stereo microscope to examine the presence of GFP+ colonies.\n8. Bioluminescence data analysis\nDouble-click the software and select Open from the File menu.\nOpen all the files and minimize them. Ensure all the units are Radiance (Photons). Additionally, click Apply to All to keep the same parameters for all the images.\nFrom the View menu, select the Tool Palette, which will open a new window.\nFrom the Tool Palette window, select the ROI Tools tab and in Type, choose the Average Bkg ROI.\nFrom the ROI tools, select Circle, and draw a small circle on the thoracic area of the mouse.",
    "Double-click on the circle, select the Use as BKG for future ROIs option from the Background ROI tab, and click Done.\n9. Measuring the total flux\nFrom the Tool Palette window, select the ROI Tools tab and in Type, choose the Measurement of ROI.\nFrom the ROI tools, select Circle, and draw a big circle on the primary tumor of the mouse.\nRight-click Copy ROI and right-click Paste ROI into every individual file of each mouse.\nClick Measure ROIs from the ROI Tools tab, which will open a new window named ROI Measurements. From this tab, keep the Measurements Types as Radiance (Photons) and Image Attributes as All Populated Values.\nExport the file as Measurements File (*.txt) or Csv (*.csv) format.\nOpen the exported data in a spreadsheet and take the Total Flux (p/s) and the values for the weeks.\n\tNOTE: This step can be used to measure different groups. For example, mice treated with a vehicle vs. those treated with a drug.\nGenerate an XY plot, where the Time is presented along the X-axis and Total Flux (p/s) along the Y-axis. For each week, take the Total Flux (p/s) parameter for each sample group and determine any significant differences using the non-parametric Student's t-test.\nSubscription Required.
