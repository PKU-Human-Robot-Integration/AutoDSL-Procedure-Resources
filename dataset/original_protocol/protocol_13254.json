    "This study was approved by the institutional review board of Peking University School and Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from the patients. The tissue samples used in this study were deidentified. The study scheme is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Sample preparation\nCut formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded oral submucous fibrosis tissues into continuous sections of 3 µm and 10 µm thickness on a microtome.\nUnfold the sections in water and then fish out onto the slides. Fix the 3 µM and 10 µm sections on adhesion microscope slides (slide A) and PEN-membrane slides (slide B), respectively.\nPlace the slides on a hot plate at 60 °C for 2 h.\n2. Hematoxylin-eosin staining\nPlace slides A and B in xylene (CAUTION) for 10 min and repeat this step thrice.\nHydrate slides A and B in graded ethanol solutions in the order of 100%, 100%, 90%, 80%, and 70% for 1 min in each concentration.\nPlace slides A and B in ultrapure distilled water for 30 s\nPlace slides A and B in Harris hematoxylin dye solution for 90 s.\nPlace slides A and B in ultrapure distilled water for 30 s and repeat this step thrice.\nPlace slides A and B in div-hematoxylin solution (CAUTION) for 2 s.\nPlace slides A and B in ultrapure distilled water for 30 s and repeat this step thrice.\nPlace slides in A and B in 1% re-blue solution for 2 s.\nPlace slides A and B in ultrapure distilled water for 30 s and repeat this step thrice.\nPlace slides in eosin solution for 2 s.\nPlace slides A and B in ultrapure distilled water for 30 s and repeat this step thrice.\nDehydrate the slides in graded ethanol solutions in the order of 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, and 100% for 2 s in each concentration.",
    "Place slide A in xylene for 3 min and repeat this step twice.\nAdd a drop of mounting medium (CAUTION) to slide A and cover it with a cover glass.\n3. Observation of histological morphology and laser capture microdissection\nInitiate the laser microdissection system and software (Figure 2).\nPlace slide A on the slide stage and observe the histological morphology to identify the area of interest for laser microdissection.\nRemove slide A and place slide B inversely on the slide stage.\nClick the Unload button (Figure 2) to push out the collection device. Insert a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tube into the collection device and ensure that the tube is held fixed. Click the OK button (Figure 3).\nSelect a cap by clicking the corresponding red circle marking the Collector Device: Tube Caps. The selected circle will turn green.\nClick the Draw button and Draw + Cut button and use the mouse to sketch the area of interest.\nClick the Start Cut button to capture the area of interest; the captured sample will be collected by the cap (Figure 4).\nClick the Lower button to ensure that the captured sample is collected (Figure 5).\nClick the Specimen button to capture the next sample.\nClick the Unload button to unload the PCR tube with the captured sample.\nSubscription Required.
