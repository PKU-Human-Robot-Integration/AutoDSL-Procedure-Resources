    "The protocol here describes a three-step procedure for generating multilayered alginate microbeads (Figure 1).  First, alginate microbeads are formed (Figure 2A).  This procedure is described in section 1 below.  Cells or proteins can be added to the microbeads in this step in order to act as a delivery system. The next step involves the formation of a permselective layer on the microbeads and is described in section 2.  The final step involves the formation of an additional alginate layer and is described in section 3.  This layer forms on the outside of the surface of the beads (Figure 2B) can be used to encapsulate and deliver therapeutic molecules (Figure 2C) to direct cellular response to the system following transplantation.\n1. Alginate Microbead Preparation\nPrepare a 1.5% (w/v) LVM alginate solution by dissolving 15 grams of LVM alginate in 1 mL of inner layer alginate solution (25 mM HEPES buffer, 118 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, and 2.5 mM MgCl2 in DI water, adjusted to pH 7.4). Mix on a Vortexer until the alginate power has fully dissolved to form a clear, viscous solution. Note: This protocol describes conditions optimal for islet encapsulation within alginate microcapsules. 1 The concentration and composition of the alginate microspheres can be altered to tune properties for other applications (e.g. drug delivery, tissue engineering, etc.) Note: For islet encapsulation the islets can be added to the alginate solution at this step prior to loading in the microencapsulator.    \nPrepare the crosslinking solution (22 mM CaCl2 in DI water) by dissolving 100 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM HEPES buffer in DI water and adjusting to pH 7.4. Note: other divalent cations such as Br2+, Sr2+ etc can be used instead of Ca2+, depending on the nature of alginate gelation desired.",
    "Set up the two-channel air jacket alginate microencapsulator by adding a 25-gauge needle to a syringe, and adjust the valves on each side to make sure the needle is in the center of the air jacket. Different gauge needles can be used for this step, depending on the size of alginate microbeads targeted.    \n    This step can also be performed with a syringe, should a microencapsulator not be available. Add the alginate solution to the syringe, and select a needle gauge based on the size of microbeads desired. \nPlace a flask containing 10 mL of crosslinking solution directly underneath the needle. Place a stir bar in the solution. \nInject droplets directly into the CaCl2 solution in order to crosslink the alginate to form microbeads. Incubate the beads in the crosslinking solution to cure for at least fifteen minutes, with continuous stirring. \nTransfer the beads to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Remove the residual solution, and perform three washes with a 0.2% CaCl2 in normal saline solution for two minutes each. \n2. Coating the Microbeads with Poly-L-ornithine\nPrepare 3 mL of a 0.1% (w/v) solution of poly-L-ornithine (PLO) in normal saline. Place the solution on a vortex until it is completely dissolved, forming a clear solution. Poly-L-lysine (PLL) can be used instead of PLO for this step, which results in similar levels of permselectivity.    \nTransfer the alginate microbeads into the PLO solution. Place on a Vortex for 30 minutes to allow the PLO sufficient time to interact with the alginate, forming a polycation-polyanion complex. At the end of 30 minutes, there should be a distinctly visible white coating around the alginate microbeads. \nRemove the PLO solution, and perform three washes with 0.2% CaCl2 in normal saline for two minutes each. \n3. Creating the Outer Alginate Layer",
    "Prepare an alginate solution of desired concentration that is to be used to create the outer layer. The solution is prepared as described in (1.1) above. The size of the outer layer is influenced by the composition and concentration of alginate used (Figure 3).    \nTransfer the alginate microbeads to a cell-strainer. Use a Kimwipe to absorb excess solution in order to dry the microbeads as much as possible. \nTransfer the microbeads to a Parafilm surface. Other smooth surfaces such as glass or even a plastic Petri dish can be substituted for Parafilm, if desired. \nTransfer the alginate solution prepared in (3.1) onto the alginate microbeads. The volume of alginate solution be should completely cover the alginate microbeads. Let the microbeads remain in the alginate solution for 45 minutes. \nUse a pipette to remove the excess alginate solution not bound to the microbeads. \nTransfer the microbeads into a solution of 22mM CaCl2. This crosslinks the alginate solution around the microbeads, resulting in the formation of the distinct outer alginate layer. \nPerform three washes with 22 mM CaCl2 in normal saline for two minutes each. Viewing the microbeads under a microscope should allow for a distinct outer alginate layer to be seen formed around the core microbead. \n4.

The size of the outer alginate layer can be varied based on the composition and concentration of alginate used. Our results show that, for both LVM and LVG alginate, the outer layer size increases with increasing alginate concentration, and that LVG alginate yields thicker outer layers than LVM alginate at equal concentrations.
