    "Make and titer I1 antibody; use enough concentration to produce full inhibition of wild type. Alternatively the antibody can be purchased from Kerafast https://www.kerafast.com/p-171-hybridoma-8g5f11-i1.aspx.[href=https://www.kerafast.com/p-171-hybridoma-8g5f11-i1.aspx]On day 1 BHK-21 stock cells are washed twice with saline solution, trypsinized and ~0.8-1.0 x 105 cells are seeded in T25 flasks with MEM-E supplemented with 7% BCS and 0.06% PP3. The flasks are gassed for 2 sec with 10% CO2 using a plugged Pasteur pipette.  Caps are locked.The cells are incubated for 24 h to produce monolayers 90% confluent.On day 2 virus mixtures are prepared. If the test virus is expected to be low fitness, the test: reference ratio should be close to 1:1. If the test virus is expected to be neutral of high fitness, ratio should be 10:1 or higher. The final viral concentration should be 106 PFU/ml (virus stocks should be titrated in advance).Note: A number of other neutral markers can be used for these assays. Any neutral single-nucleotide substitution may be monitored by qRT-PCR. Some nucleotide substitutions can be engineered to create or destroy restriction sites that can be identified in agarose gels and quantified by densitometry.Aspire growth medium in a T-25 flask using a Pasteur pipettedand use 200 μl of virus mixture to infect a monolayer. Incubate 10 min at room temperature (RT) and 40 min at 37 °C.  Add 5 ml of MEM-E + FBS. This is the competition passage.Note: This will result in the determination of fitness in BHK-21 cells under the incubation conditions specified here. Virus fitness can be determined under other kind of conditions of interest (different cell types, temperatures, presence/absence of antiviral molecules, etc) by changing the conditions of this passage.  The rest of the procedure remains the same after adjusting for dilutions so one can count 20-200 plaques/flask.",
    "Dilute a sample of the virus mixture to 1,000-fold and infect 3 BHK-21 monolayers with 200 μl to carry out plaque assays in the absence of I1Mab. This will produce approximately 200 plaques. Incubate 10 min at room temperature (RT) and 40 min at 37 °C. Melt agarose solution and add to prewarmed MEM-E+BCS to a final concentration of 0.2%. Add 5 ml to each flask.Infect 3 BHK-21 monolayers with 200 μl of the appropriate dilution to carry out plaque assay in the presence of I1Mab. If ratios are close to 1:1, 1,000-fold dilution a good choice.  If there is excess of 10:1 or more reference virus, a 100-fold dilution should produce the desired results.  Do not neutralize the mixture with I1Mab, as it will result in incorrect data due to phenotypic mixing and hiding (Valverde and Ortin, 1989; Holland et al.,1989). Incubate 10 min at room temperature (RT) and 40 min at 37 °C.  Prewarm a mixture of MEM-E + BCS and I1Mab at enough concentration to achieve complete neutralization of wild type, add agarose to a final concentration of 0.2%, and add mixture to flasks.Note: I1Mab needs to be titrated in advance.  Different batches, particularly if produce in the laboratory from the hybridoma, may differ greatly in their final I1 activity.Incubate competition passage and plaque assays for 24 h at 37 °C.Develop all plaque assays. Just let the overlay slide out and add 2-3 ml of crystal violet solution. Wait for 5 min at RT and rinse with tap water.Note: Because of the low agarose concentration there is no need to fix the cells.Count plaques and calculate initial ration (P0): (total virus – I1-resistant virus)/I1-resistant virus. The transilluminator is helpful for plaque counting.",
    "Take the yield from the competition passage yield and carry out triplicate plaque assays in the presence and absence of I1Mab as described (except that dilutions will need to be adjusted).Calculate the ratio after competition (P1) as described in step 10.Fitness is calculated as P1/P0.To increase the accuracy of the determination and increase the statistical power for subsequent analyses.If fitness values are closed to neutrality and the changes in ratio are small, use the yield of the first competition passage to carry out a second competition passage as described in step 5 and continue the process for up to 6-7 passages. Calculate fitness as the antilogarithm of the slope of log-ratio changes.If fitness values are very large or very small, carry out multiple independent competitions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140313/20140313001232_4922.jpgFigure 1. Determinations of relative fitness.  A test virus (white particles) is mixed with a reference virus (grey particles) and the mixture is used to infect BHK-21 cells. The viruses will compete during replication, and the virus that is best adapted will produce a higher relative number of progeny virions. When compared to a reference, strains whose relative numbers increase are high fitness; strains whose relative numbers don’t change are neutral; strains whose relative numbers decrease are low fitness."
