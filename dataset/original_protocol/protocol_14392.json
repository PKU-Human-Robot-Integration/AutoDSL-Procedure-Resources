    "The study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the University of Thessaly, Department of Exercise Science, Βiοethics Committee.\n1. Preparation of the Surgery Equipment and Consumables\nPosition a disinfected surgical field on a 4-wheel surgical Mayo stand.\nPosition the following consumables and surgical equipment on a 4-wheel surgical Mayo stand:\n\tOne pair of straight operating scissors (15 cm)\n\tOne scalpel (No. 11)\n\tOne scalpel handle\n\tOne pair of curved scissors (14 cm)\n\tOne mosquito forceps\n\tOne pair of Kocher tweezers\n\tOne surgical tweezer\n\tPovidone-iodine (on a sterile gauze)\n\tOne suture (4.0)\n\tOne pair of straight scissors (11 cm)\n\tOne needle holder (15 cm)\n\tFive sterile gauzes\n\tOne adhesive sterile gauze\n\tOne 10-mL syringe with a disinfected needle\n\t10mL of 2% xylocaine (no adrenaline)\n\tOne pair of disinfected surgical gloves\nPosition the following materials on a separate bench:\n\tTwo microcentrifuge tubes\n\tOne tube containing 5 mL of 10% formalin\n\tOne small container containing 50-100 mL of liquid nitrogen at -190 °C.\n2. Preparation of the Participants\nHave participants follow an 8 h fast15 prior to the biopsy procedure.\nHave participants refrain from physical exercise, excessive stressors, alcohol, and active and passive smoking 72 h prior the biopsy16,17.\n3. Performing the Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Biopsy\nPosition the participant on the surgical bed in a supine position.\nDisinfect the region of the incision using povidone-iodine.\nInject 10 mL of 2% xylocaine (no adrenaline) slowly and steadily18 into the selected region to serve as local anesthesia.\nPosition a sterile surgical field over the area to cover the body of the participant, excluding the region of the incision.",
    "At least 3-5 min afterwards, apply pressure with a pair of tweezers to the area of local anesthesia and ask the participant if he feels any pain19 to ensure that local anesthesia has been achieved.\nAttach the No. 11 scalpel to the scalpel handle.\nCreate an incision of 2-2.5 cm in length, 3-5 cm to the left or right of the navel.\nRemove the subcutaneous tissue with a pair of straight 15 cm operating scissors.\nOnce the adipose tissue is revealed, capture it with a pair of tweezers and a pair of curved 14 cm scissors.\nCut and remove approximately 1 g of adipose tissue.\nFollowing tissue removal, position sterile gauzes over the incision to achieve hemostasis.\nWhen hemostasis is confirmed, capture the 4.0 suture with a 14 cm needle and the skin with a pair of surgical tweezers until the subcutaneous tissue is visible.\nInsert the suture-needle into the skin, moving towards the subcutaneous tissue while the skin and subcutaneous are closely aligned.\nWith the suture-needle, follow a continuous zig-zag technique into the subcutaneous tissue until driven externally off the skin. Continue until the skin incision is closed.\nExternally tie the suture.\nClean the area of incision with saline and cover it with an adhesive sterile gauze.\n4. Deposition of the Tissue\nSeparate the collected adipose tissue into three pieces: 150, 350, and 500 mg.\nPosition the 150 and 350 mg pieces of sample tissue in microcentrifuge tubes.\nImmerse the two microcentrifuge tubes in the small container with the liquid nitrogen at -190 °C until final deposition in a freezer at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: In advance, use a sterile needle to puncture a small hole in the microcentrifuge tubes to avoid cup failure during the immersion of the microcentrifuge tubes in the liquid nitrogen at -190 °C.",
    "Immerse the 500 mg piece of sample tissue-to be used for histological analysis-in a tube containing 5 mL of 10% formalin.\n\tNOTE: Use the mosquito forceps only in cases of excessive bleeding during the surgery. In such cases, capture the vessel with the mosquito forceps to ligate and close until hemostasis is achieved.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
