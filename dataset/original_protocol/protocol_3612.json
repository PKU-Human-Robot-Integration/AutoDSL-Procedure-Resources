    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1: Introduce the Hermes transposon and transposase plasmids sequentially into strains characterized by TIS\nTiming: 10 days\nNote: To identify genes important for heterochromatin formation we use two strains that differ in that one (YHL10155) has ura4 inserted into the centromere of chromosome 1 (cen 1 otr1R::ura4) where it is silenced by heterochromatin. The other strain (YHL912) does not have ura4 in the centromere (cen1 WT) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Hermes transposition is induced to generate high-density profiles of transposon integration in both strains. Integration of the Hermes transposon that disrupts genes required for heterochromatin silencing results in the expression of ura4 in the centromere. These cells are removed from the culture by FOA. Genes with a potential role in forming heterochromatin accumulate significantly fewer insertions in the strain with ura4 in centromere 1 that the strain with the wild type centromere. In this initial Step of the protocol we introduce the plasmid containing the Hermes transposon with kanMX6 (pHL2577) and the plasmid that expresses the transposase (pHL2578) into the strains to be assayed by TIS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The transposase excises the Hermes transposon and integrates it into the host genome (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/537-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Step 1: Introduce Hermes transposon and Hermes transposase expression plasmids into wild type (WT) and reporter strains (otr1:: ura4)\nThe plasmid pHL2577 contains the Hermes transposon with kanMX6, the marker that encodes resistance to G418 and is used to select for the plasmid. The Hermes transposase is expressed from the plasmid pHL2578 which contains LEU2, the selection marker used to retain the plasmid.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/537-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Induction of Hermes transposition in S. pombe",
    "(A) Two plasmids were generated to induce Hermes transposition. pHL2577 provides the source of transposon DNA flanked by TIR-R and TIR-L. The kanMX6 cassette was inserted between the TIRs, giving cells with transpositions resistance to the drug G418. pHL2578 uses the nmt1 promoter to express the Hermes transposase. TIR: terminal inverted repeats.\n(B) The TIRs are bound by the transposase that excises the Hermes transposon and integrates the transposon DNA into a new genomic location.\nPrepare competent cells\nScrape a matchhead sized amount of YHL10155 and YHL912 cells from the YES plates and resuspend the cells thoroughly in 1 mL of YES media. Measure the OD600 of the resuspended cultures using dilutions with YES media to obtain a reading in the linear range of your spectrophotometer, usually between OD600 0.1 and OD600 0.6. Use these measurements to start a 50 mL culture of YHL10155 and YHL912 in YES media at OD600 = 0.05. Shake cultures at 32°C for 16 h.\nWhen the cultures reach a density of OD600 = 0.5, centrifuge at 1600 g, 5 min at 25°C.\nResuspend cells with 50 mL sterile ddH2O and centrifuge as above.\nResuspend cells in 25 mL TE + 0.1 M LiOAc and centrifuge as above.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 mL TE + 0.1 M LiOAc.\nPut each strain in a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube and roll at 32°C for 60 min.\nMake 0.1 mL aliquots for immediate use.\nFirst transformation to introduce plasmid containing Hermes transposon (pHL2577)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_537_3.csv\nNote: The PEG solution can be stored at 25°C for 6 month.\nAdd 5 μL of pre-boiled ssDNA (10 mg/mL), which is to enhance the uptake of plasmid.",
    "Add 5 μL plasmid DNA to each aliquot except one which will serve as a transformation control to test whether colonies isolated in steps 14 and 15 are derived from the S. pombe being studied and not contamination of bacteria or mold.\nIncubate the mixture on roller at 32°C for 30 min.\nAdd 0.7 mL PEG solution.\nIncubate 60 min. at 32°C.\nHeat shock 5 min. at 42°C.\nPellet cells with a brief spin in a microfuge, resuspend in 0.2 mL sterile ddH2O and spread onto two YES plates equally. After 24 h, cell mass should form. Then replica-print the plates onto YES + G418 plates. After 3 days, cells containing the plasmid should form colonies.\nPick 4 average-sized clones with a sterile toothpick.\nStreak each on YES + G418 plates to form single colonies.\nUse these purified colonies to inoculate patches on YES + G418. When cells are grown, place into vials with 1.5 mL YES containing 15% glycerol for storage at −80°C.\nPause Point: The strains can be stored at −80°C indefinitely until ready to proceed to next step. To continue the protocol use the frozen vials to inoculate plates containing YES + G418.\nSecond transformation to add the plasmid with the Hermes transposase (pHL2578)",
    "Repeat steps (1–14) for the 2nd transformation to introduce the transposase expression plasmid (pHL2578) or empty vector (pHL1768) into the strains containing the Hermes transposon plasmid (pHL2577) obtained in step 14 with the following modifications: In step 1 inoculate replicate strains containing pHL2577 and start the culture in YES + G418 for 16 h, which is to keep selection pressure for the Hermes transposon plasmid. In step 14, instead of YES, spread cells directly onto PMG + U – L + B1 + G418 plates to select for pHL2577 with G418, and pHL2578 with –Leucine. After 3 days, pick 4 single clones and streak on PMG + U – L + B1 + G418 plates. Use the purified colonies to inoculate patches on PMG + U – L + B1 + G418. Once grown at 32°C for 16 h these cells will be used immediately in step 16.\nNote: We found maintaining cells with both plasmids causes genome instability because the Hermes transposon is very active. So every effort should be made to limit the number of cell divisions between transformation of the transposase plasmid and start of the induction cultures.\nStep 2: Generating library of Hermes insertions\nTiming: 15 days",
    "Note: This Step is to induce Hermes transposition and generate pools of cells with single integration events (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The expression of Hermes transposase is induced in the absence of vitamin B1, which represses the nmt promoter. The Hermes transposase is expressed from the plasmid pHL2578 which also contains LEU2, the selection marker used to retain the plasmid. The plasmid pHL2577 contains the Hermes transposon with kanMX6, the marker that encodes resistance to G418 and is used to select for the plasmid. The expression cultures are passaged until approximately 10% of the cells have an integration as monitored by the quantitative transposition assay (step 22). Typically, 12 sequential passages (approximately 80 generations of cell division) are required. Additional growth risks introducing unneeded selection bias in the insertion strains and could generate too many cells with more than one insertion. Following transposition, pHL2577 is removed so that G418 can be used to identify cells with de novo insertions of Hermes. For this step URA3 is used with FOA to evict pHL2577. FOA not only selects against the plasmid with Hermes-kanMX6 but it also provides the selection that removes cells with defects of the centromeric heterochromatin that silences ura4.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/537-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Step 2: Generation of Hermes integrations\nInsertions of the transposable element Hermes were produced in cells with WT cen1 and cen1 otr1R::ura4. The transposition process began with expression of Hermes transposase. The cells were passaged for multiple generations until ~10% of cells had Hermes integrations which were monitored by comparing colony numbers on PMG + FOA plates with and without G418. Growth in liquid medium with FOA removed the expression plasmid. Subsequent growth in liquid medium containing FOA + G418, selected for cells that lacked the expression plasmid and had insertions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_537_4.csv",
    "Critical: To ensure robust statistical measures of integration density in each gene we recommend that four biologically independent cultures of each strain be processed as described below. Our independent cultures were also independent transformants of the plasmids.\nFor each strain, use the patches of step 15 to inoculate a matchhead amount of cells into one 5 mL PMG + U – L + B1 + G418 culture. Let the cells grow for 16 h at 32°C shaking at 230 rpm.\nNext morning, briefly centrifuge and resuspend the cells to wash the starter culture four times with 5 mL of PMG + U – L – B1 + G418 media.\nCritical: This step removes residual B1 which will inhibit the nmt1 promoter that induces expression of transposase.\nWith these cells, inoculate 50 mL PMG + U – L – B1 + G418 cultures for each strain at a starting OD600 = 0.05.\nGrow cultures in 32° C shaking incubator over night to achieve OD600 >2.0.\nThe next day measure OD600, and use these cells to inoculate new 50 mL cultures of PMG + U – L – B1 + G418 at OD600 = 0.05.\nRepeat steps 19–21 until 10% of cells contain an integration event as monitored by the method described below (step 22). During the multiday procedure that measures integration frequency, continue the daily passages of the transposition cultures (steps 19–21).\nMeasure the transposition frequency every two or three days of passaged cultures.\nPlate 100 μL of OD600 = 0.05 and 100 μL of OD600 = 0.005 on PMG + FOA. Plate 100 μL of OD600 = 0.5 and 100 μL of OD600 = 0.05 on PMG + FOA + G418.",
    "After 3 days of incubation at 32° C, count the number of colonies. The transposition frequency is calculated as the number of colonies on PMG + FOA + G418 divided by the number of colonies on PMG + FOA taking into account dilution factors required to count colonies.\nRepeat until the transposition frequency > 10%.\nOnce the transposition frequency exceeds 10%, use the cells from the PMG + U – L –B1 + G418 culture of step 21 to inoculate a 500 mL culture of PMG + U + L + B1 + FOA at starting OD600 =0.5. This selects against the plasmid containing the Hermes transposon.\nAfter 24 h of growth at 32°C, use these cells to inoculate a 500 mL culture of PMG + FOA + G418 at starting OD600 = 0.5. Grow this culture around 12∼16 h until it reaches saturation, approximately OD600 =6. This culture selects for cells with Hermes integration that also lack the plasmid containing the Hermes transposon.\nNote: FOA is used to select against cells expressing URA3 in the Hermes transposon plasmid. FOA is toxic to the yeast cells because URA3 converts the FOA into the toxic substance 5-fluorouracil.\nWe reserve and freeze these cells in 10 mL aliquots at OD600 = 5.0. To make 25 10 mL aliquots determine the final OD of the PMG + FOA + G418 culture and calculate the volume of culture containing 1,250 OD units of cells.\nCentrifuge this volume of culture at 1,700 g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nDecant the supernatant and re-suspend in 250 mL of sterile 15% glycerol with YES media.\nDistribute to twenty-five 15 mL snap-cap Falcon tubes, in 10 mL/aliquots and store at −80°C.",
    "Pause Point: The aliquots can be stored at −80°C until ready to proceed to next step.\nStep 3: TIS to identify genes important for forming heterochromatin\nTiming: 15 days\nNote: The cells from the previous procedure have been grown for approximately five generations in the presence of FOA. This selection accomplishes two goals; it selects against the Hermes transposon containing donor plasmid and it begins the selection against Hermes insertions that disrupt genes important for forming heterochromatin. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Such mutations that impair heterochromatin in the centromere activate expression of ura4 and as a result inhibit growth. The following procedure passages the cultures for 80 additional generations in FOA which allows the identification of many more genes that contribute to heterochromatin. Following growth in FOA the cells are used to perform high throughput sequencing to map insertion sites.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/537-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Step 3: TIS selection to identify genes important for forming heterochromatin\nThe cultures obtained from Step 2 were passaged for additional generations in the presence of FOA. The cells from the second FOA cultures represented the initial time point. Subsequent passages in FOA occurred until a total of 80 generations were achieved.\nFor each strain and its replicates, thaw 1 −80°C frozen aliquot (each aliquot is 10 mL of OD600 = 5.0) on ice.\nCentrifuge cells at 1,700 g for 5 min to pellet.\nPour off glycerol, wash twice by resuspending in PMG + U + L + B1 liquid media.\nPour off media, resuspend in 10 mL of PMG + U + L + B1 + FOA.\nUse 2 mL to inoculate a 100 mL culture of PMG + U + L + B1 + FOA.\nMeasure OD600, should be ∼ 0.1, which is a total of 2.0 × 108 cells.",
    "Grow cultures for 16 h shaking in 32°C incubator.\nThe next day, the OD600 should be approximately 6.0. Use these cells to inoculate new 100 mL cultures of PMG + U + L + B1 + FOA at starting OD600 = 0.05.\nNote: With the remaining cells of the culture, approximately 200 OD units, pellet and freeze the cells at −80°C. These will be used to isolate genomic DNA for deep sequencing insertions sites at this initial point of propagation in FOA.\nRepeat inoculating fresh 100 mL PMG + U + L + B1 + FOA cultures at OD600 = 0.05 every day until the number of cumulative generations reaches 80. Calculate generations using equation:\nGenerations = ln(ODfinal/ODinitial)/0.693\nWhen number of generations reaches 80:\nSpin down a few 10 aliquots of culture and resuspend in 2 mL 15% glycerol to make perms and freeze at −80°C (in case you decide to grow for additional generations).\nSpin down remaining cultures at 1,700 g for 5 min and make 200 OD unit pellets to be stored at −80°C. These will be used for deep sequencing the insertion library at 80 generations of growth.\nStep 4: Library preparation for deep sequencing of integration profiles\nTiming: 6 days",
    "Note: The goal of this Step is to prepare libraries for deep sequencing and identify Hermes integrations throughout the genome by bioinformatic analysis. Separate libraries are made for each replicate of each strain. The process is a specialized form of targeted sequencing using ligation mediated PCR (Guo et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). We incorporate Illumina’s P5 and P7 binding sequences into primers that recognize the TIR-L of the Hermes transposon. We describe the extraction of genomic DNA, the digestion of the DNA with MseI, the ligation of linkers to the MseI fragments, the PCR amplification of insertion sites, the gel purification of the PCR products, and Illumina sequencing of the amplified DNA (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/537-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Step 4: Scheme of library preparation and deep sequencing\nHigh-throughput sequencing of Hermes integrations depends on amplifying insertions with ligation-mediated PCR.\nExtracting genomic DNA\nTo identify genes with strong contributions to heterochromatin we isolate DNA and sequence insertions from cells obtained early in the propagation in FOA (step 36). Many more candidate genes are identified from genomic DNA of cells grown for 80 additional generations in FOA (step 37). From steps 36 and 38b re-suspend cell pellets of 200 OD units in 5 mL of SP1 buffer with 30 mg zymolyase previously dissolved.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_537_5.csv\nNote: Combine 50 mg of dry zymolyase with 5 mL of SP1 buffer and mix gently. The zymolyase may not dissolve completely, but do not heat for the solubilization. Use a short spin in a microfuge to remove the precipitate. Use the supernatant and store this solution in aliquots at −20°C.\nIncubate at 37oC for 2 h or until cells are dark under a phase contrast microscope.\nPellet spheroplasted cells by spinning at 1600 g for 5 min.",
    "Re-suspend in 15 mL 5X TE (50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.9). Add 1.5 mL 10% SDS and incubate at 25°C for 60 min. Then incubate at 65°C for 5 min.\nTransfer to 50 mL Falcon screw-cap tube. Add 5 mL 5 M KOAc and incubate at 25°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 1600 g for 15 min to pellet debris. Pipette supernatant into high-resistance, thick-plastic tube (next step requires high-speed centrifugation).\nAdd 20 mL ice-cold isopropanol to supernatant, incubate on ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 8000 g for 10 min to pellet the nucleic acids. Decant and let pellet air-dry until liquid evaporates.\nRe-suspend pellet in 6 mL 5X TE. Add RNase A to a final concentration of 100 μg/mL.\nIncubate at 37oC for 1 h.\nAdd 0.2 mL 10% SDS and Proteinase K to final concentration of 50 μg/mL. Incubate for 2 h to 16 h at 50°C.\nAdd equal volume of equilibrated Phenol and mix vigorously. Centrifuge at 8000 g for 5 min. Extract the top aqueous layer to a fresh tube.\nRepeat step 50 twice, or until interface between aqueous and organic layer is clear.\nAdd equal volume of Phenol/CHCl3/IAA, mix, centrifuge at 8000 g for 5 min. Extract the top aqueous layer to a fresh tube.\nRepeat step 52 twice, or until interface between aqueous and organic layer is clear. For last extraction, leave 20% of aqueous volume behind.\nEtOH precipitate DNA by adding 1/10 volume 5 M NaCl and 2.5 volumes 100% ethanol.\nOptional: keep in −20°C freezer for 2 h\nAliquot solution to micro-centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge at 8000 g for 20 min on table-top centrifuge.\nWash pellet with 70% ethanol. Air dry the pellet.",
    "As an optional step to improve purification re-suspend DNA in 200 μL TE and perform an additional ethanol precipitation by adding 20 μL 5 M NaCl and 2.5 volumes 100% ethanol. Wash pellet with 70% ethanol. Air dry the pellet.\nRe-suspend DNA in 200 μL TE. Run small aliquot (5 μL) of DNA on 1% agarose gel with standards to gauge the quality of purified gDNA. Two examples of genomic DNA (gDNA) are shown below and we estimate the size of the gDNA is between 10 kb and 23 kb (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Here you can use Qubit or Picogreen to quantify the gDNA concentration and normalize the concentration of each sample at 50 ng/μL. The total yield of gDNA extraction from 200 OD unit cells is around 10∼20 μg.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/537-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

The digestion generates fragments containing Hermes transposon TIR-L and genomic flanking DNA (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nMake a pool of common reagents (enough for 7 digests) for MseI digestion. The instructions and proportions below are used to make a high coverage library of a single culture replicate.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_537_6.csv\nTo each of 7 micro-centrifuge tubes, add 80 μL of pool mix, 20 μL of gDNA (concentration ∼ 50 ng/μL).

The two bright bands in lanes 8 and 9 are the free linker. Two independent library preps are shown.\nLinker preparation",
    "Note: It is critical that HL1871 have a 3′ blocked nucleotide. Otherwise the 3′ end of HL1871 in linker ligated to both ends of any fragment of genomic DNA would be extended and result in amplification during PCR (described below). With the 3′ block PCR specifically amplifies Hermes TIR-L and the adjacent genomic DNA. The linker annealing can be done in advance of the linker ligation to the genomic DNA fragments. The annealed linker can be stored at −20° C for several months.\nMix the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_537_7.csv\nNote: 10x Clontech PCR buffer: 100 mM Tris-HCl(pH 8.9), 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2\nAliquot to small PCR tubes.\nRun the following (pre-set) program in PCR machine (Bio-Rad Thermal Cycler T100):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_537_8.csv\nLigate linker to MseI-digested fragments of gDNA\nSet up following pool (× 12) of common reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_537_9.csv\nCritical: Here, you need to set up a no-linker control to test for efficient ligation. You will see an upward shift due to ligation of larger fragments (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], lane 6–9). The upward shift is an indication of robust ligation.

    "Note: This set of steps is to use the linker-ligated genomic DNA fragments as templates for PCR amplification of genomic sequences flanking Hermes integration sites. TIR primer specifically binds to the end of Hermes TIR-L and extends across the linker filling in the 3′ end allowing the linker primer to anneal and initiate amplification (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCritical: To produce libraries with the highest numbers of insertions we use up to 95 independent PCR reactions for each sample.\nSet up following pool of common reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_537_11.csv\nTo one PCR well in plate, add 18.4 μL of mix and 1.6 μL dH2O (no DNA negative control).

    "Collect the PCR reactions from each library in 15 mL tube and add 7.5 mL buffer PC from Qiagen PCR purification kit. Add 100 μL 3 M NaAc (pH5.2) to adjust the pH. Distribute equally on 6 Qiagen PCR purification columns (following kit instructions; yield is improved when DNA-buffer PI mixture is loaded on column twice; yield is improved when Buffer EB eluate is loaded on column twice). Elute with 50 μL Buffer EB on each column (total 300 μL).\nPrepare a 2% preparative agarose gel with a large capacity well (by taping together 8 teeth in comb).\nAdd 10X loading dye to DNA sample.\nRun preparative gel at 70 V for ∼ 2 h. Excise the gel with single use razor between 200 bp and 500 bp (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nFollow procedure in Qiagen Gel Purification Kit (yield is improved with above modifications, as well as loading DNA-Buffer QG mixture to column twice). Elute each column with 30 μL Buffer EB.\nConcentrate the gel-extract product on one Qiagen PCR purification column (following kit instructions, with above modifications). Elute with 100 μL 1X TE. Store at −20°C.\nQuantify DNA concentration following KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche). Typical concentrations are above 100 nM.\nLibrary is now ready for sequencing. This DNA is sequence ready for Illumina machines. We do not add sequencing adapters because we have included the Illumina P5 and P7 sequences in our PCR primers. However, to achieve registration of clusters during the first four cycles of sequencing you need to combine and multiplex different samples for simultaneous sequencing using additional versions of primer HL3508 with different sequences at positions indicated with an N in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. Design the N sequences so that when the amplicons are combined all four nucleotides are detected at each N position."
