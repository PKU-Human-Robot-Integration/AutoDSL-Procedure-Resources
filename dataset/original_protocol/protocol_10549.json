    "1. Standard Operating Protocol\n1.1 Instrument Setup and Sample Preparation\nConnect the instrument to a computer with the Izon Control Suite software installed.\nChoose the nanopore size to use: for size and concentration measurement of EVs a NP150 (target size range 85 - 300 nm) or NP200 (target size range 100 - 400  nm) are most often used. When working with EVs that have been isolated using a protocol that involves removal of larger EVs, for instance by passing the sample through a 220 nm filter, a NP100 pore (target size range 70 - 200 nm) can be used. When working with EVs in a biological sample or EVs isolated using a different protocol, the NP200 can be used, as it will get clogged less often. Other nanopores such as the NP300 (target size range 150 - 600 nm) or the NP400 (target size range 200 - 800 nm), or even larger nanopores, can be used for larger types of EVs.\nChoose the polystyrene calibration particles that complement the nanopore selected in step 1.1.2. For a NP100, NP150 and NP200 nanopore use the CPC100, CP100 and CPC200 particles, respectively. For accurate size estimation, ensure that the calibration particles have a similar size as the unknown particles.\nTo ensure homogeneity of the calibration particles, vortex briefly (30 sec). Optionally, apply sonication to remove aggregates.\nDilute the calibration particles in PBS to the target concentration in a volume of at least 40 µl. Note: The target concentration varies based on the nanopore selected in step 1.1.2. Target concentrations are supplied with the nanopores.",
    "Apply and directly remove 78 µl of PBS on the lower fluid cell; this wetting of the lower fluid cell reduces the risk of air bubble formation under the nanopore when applying an electrolyte to the lower fluid cell when the nanopore is in position.\nPlace the nanopore onto the 4 arms of the instrument. Use the digital calipers to measure the distance between two opposite arms and enter the distance in mm into the “Stretch” input field and click “calibrate stretch” to calibrate the nanopore stretch.\nStretch the nanopore to 47 mm, by turning the side wheel and thus increasing the distance between the opposing arms of the instrument, before reapplying 78 µl PBS to the lower fluid cell.\n\tNote: Electrical interference can substantially influence the quality of measurements. When using a laptop to run the Izon Control Suite software, make sure the laptop is connected to the power grid using a grounded socket and plug. Mobile phones kept close to the instrument can also be a source of electrical interference. Electrical interference is observed as constantly repeated peaks in the baseline current, often with root mean square (RMS) noise >10 pA.\n\tNote: Almost any buffer can be used to dilute calibration particles and EVs for tRPS characterization. The presence of salts is a prerequisite for establishment of an electric current. For EV measurements use PBS as a buffer. Calibration particles should always be diluted in the same buffer as the EVs to ensure accurate measurements.\n1.2. Determine the Optimal Settings for Measurement",
    "Note: Before recording, it is important to establish optimal measurement settings. The blockade magnitude caused by a particle passing through the nanopore is dependent on the applied stretch and the voltage applied. For reliable measurements the RMS noise should be <10 pA and the mode blockade magnitude should be >0.1 nA.\nPlace the upper fluid cell and shielding cage on the nanopore and introduce 40 µl of diluted calibration particles in the upper fluid cell. Use the VPM to apply ≥0.8 kPa positive pressure.\nReduce the applied stretch slowly towards 44 mm whilst analyzing the blockade events caused by the calibration particles. Note: When reducing the pore diameter the movement of particles through the nanopore will be less likely and thus the particle rate will decrease. However, due to increased relative blockade of the pore a larger blockade event will occur resulting in improved signal-to-noise ratio. Increasing the voltage may further increase the blockade magnitude but can also increase the RMS noise.\nReduce the stretch until appropriate blockade events (Figure 1c) are observed in the “Signal Trace” panel. (mode >0.1 nA) and the corresponding particle rate is >100/min. Note: The particle rate is a less strict cut-off, however as measurements of at least 500 particles are ideal, particle rates of <100/min will cause recording durations of at least 5 min. Particle rates higher than 2,000/min can result in less accurate measurements (if present, sample dilution should be performed).\n1.3 Measurement of Calibration Particles, Washing of the Uper Fluid Cell and Sample Measurement\nIn this section EVs from the cell culture supernatant of the glioblastoma multiforme cell line U87-MG/EGFRvIII are characterized. The isolation and preparation of these EVs has previously been described and visualized18.",
    "Place the calibration particles in the upper fluid cell. Apply pressure (for example 0.8 kPa) using the VPM and record >500 particles.\nIf performing a multi-pressure measurement, increase the applied pressure (for example to 1.0 kPa) and record a second calibration file. Note: A minimum of 0.2 kPa difference is required.\nRemove the calibration sample from the upper fluid cell. Wash the upper fluid cell 3 times with 100 µl PBS to remove residual particles. Before introduction of the sample into the upper fluid cell, use lint-free tissue to remove any residual PBS from the upper fluid cell.\nIntroduce the sample to the upper fluid cell. Make sure the baseline current is within 3% of the baseline current observed when measuring the calibration particles. If not within 3%, apply the strategy described below to stabilize the baseline current. Apply the exact pressures as applied to the calibration particles and record the sample files.\n\tNote: The particle rate plot should display constant particle detection (Figure 2a). In case of sudden interruption of particle detection, a sudden drop in baseline current, or a sudden increase in RMS noise, the pore may be clogged; thus, pause the recording. In order to restore the baseline, tap or twist the shielding cap, apply the plunger, or completely remove the nanopore and wash it with deionized water and replace it on the instrument.\n\tNote: Alternatively, increase the nanopore stretch to 47 mm in combination with maximum pressure from the VPM for approximately 5 min.\n1.4 Data Analysis\nClick on the “Analyze Data” tab to enter the analysis section of the software. Process the calibration and sample files by right-clicking the “Unprocessed Files” and selecting “Process Files”.",
    "Click the checkbox next to the sample in the “Calibrated” column to couple the sample files to the calibration recordings. Select corresponding sample and calibration files and click “OK”. Note: when using the multi-pressure calibration option select the “Multi-pressure Calibration” tab on the left to couple multiple samples to multiple calibration files.\nOnce successfully coupled, the Izon Control Suite software will display different sample characteristics such as a size-distribution (Figure 2b), baseline durations, full width half maximum (FWHM) and a concentration analysis. Optionally: For each sample, individual data points can be exported as a comma separated file.\n2. Alternative Protocol – Spiking Samples with Calibration Beads\nNote: In general, the standard operating procedure can be used when working with isolated EVs. When working with non-isolated EVs in biological samples, or isolated EV preparations contaminated with large protein aggregates, operating the instrument can be challenging. These challenges consist mainly of a high rate of nanopore blocking (sudden drop in baseline current), inability to recover baseline currents within 3% of calibration measurement or significant differences in particle rates between identical samples (Figure 3a). For samples displaying these difficulties an alternative protocol to quantify EVs was developed17. This methodology relies on the introduction of larger polystyrene calibration beads into the sample of interest (Figure 3b). A detailed procedure for this alternative protocol is discussed below.\n2.1. Sample Preparation\nNote: When preparing samples using the alternative method, it is desired to establish an EV-to-bead ratio of around 1. Also, it is essential to include a ‘calibration bead only’ sample, to allow for accurate ‘gating’ of the calibration beads and to determine the number of background particles (for example protein aggregates) present in the buffer.\nCentrifuge 100 µl of cell culture supernatant for 7 min at 300 x g",
    "Add 20 µl of the supernatant to 20 µl of PBS and 10 µl of 75 times diluted 335 nm polystyrene beads (stock 7e10/ml).\n2.2. Sample Measurement\nUse the strategy described in section 1.2 to determine the optimal instrument settings.\nMeasure the ‘calibration bead only’ sample first. Ensure that the background detection of small non-bead particles is as low as possible (<10% of the beads).\nMeasure each individual sample once before recording replicates in order to distribute fluctuation in nanopore conditions equally over the different samples. Measure at least 3 replicates of each sample.\nRemeasure the ‘calibration bead only’ sample after finishing the recording of all samples.\n2.3. Data Analysis\nNote: When using the alternative protocol, exclusive use of the Izon Control Suite software does not suffice for concentration calculation. Additional spreadsheet software is required. Table 1 indicates an example of the concentration calculation of the samples depicted in Figure 3.\nOpen the ‘calibration bead only’ sample and one or more sample files.\nDetermine which blockade event size (in nA) can be used as a cut-off for distinction between EVs and polystyrene beads. Determining the blockade value (nA) corresponding to the left base of the polystyrene beads population (Figure 3b). Note: ensure equal setting of the bin-sizes of all measurements (can be adjusted in ‘ViewSettings’ which is accessed by clicking the “pop-up” button below “Individual Blockade Trace”).\nRetrieve the values of the total particle count for each sample by clicking the “Particle Analysis Summary” tab of the sample.\nFilter the data sets using the cut-off level determined in step 2.3.2. by selecting the “Data Filtering” pop-up. Display only particles smaller than the cut-off.\nRetrieve the values of the EV count for each sample from the “Particle Analysis Summary”.",
    "Subtract the amount of EVs from the total particles to determine the amount of calibration beads.\nDetermine the EV-to-bead ratio by dividing EV count by calibration bead count.\nDetermine the average background ratio by averaging the ratios determined for each “bead only” calibration sample. Subtract this value from each individual sample.\nMultiply the adjusted EV-to-bead ratio by the concentration of calibration beads to determine the concentration of EVs for each sample.\nMultiply the concentration found in step 2.3.9 by the EV dilution factor introduced by the addition of calibration beads to the EV sample. Note: In the example sample setup, the total dilution of sample in PBS and calibration beads is 2.5 times and thus the concentration found in step 2.3.9 should be multiplied by 2.5 to determine the raw EV sample concentration.\nCalculate statistics such as the averages, standard deviation and standard error of the mean for each group of replicates.\n\tNote: in some cases overlap between EVs and spiked polystyrene beads is observed. If correction for the underestimation of EV concentration is required, samples without spiked polystyrene beads should also be measured. Use the same cut-off as determined in step 2.3.2 to determine a “bead-to-EV” ratio, to calculate the ratio of EVs that fall within the range of the spiked polystyrene beads. This bead-to-EV ratio should be added to the EV-to-bead ratio determined in step 2.3.8.\n2.4. Optional: EV Size Distribution Using the Alternative Method.\nOpen a sample recording twice in the Control Suite Software.\nSet the filter options of one of the samples to only display particles bigger than the cut-off determined above. This will display the calibration particles only.\nSet the filtered sample to “calibration file” and enter the mode size of the calibration beads.",
    "Couple the sample file and the “calibration file” created in step 2.4.3 as described in 1.4.2. The sample file will now display a size distribution of both EVs and calibration beads based on the spiked calibration beads.\n\tNote: The standard operating protocol will most often suffice for the determination of size-distributions of EVs. Sometimes however, exact buffer components are unknown (for example in plasma or urine) which makes it impossible to prepare a sample of calibration beads in the same buffer as the EVs of interest. An EV sample spiked with calibration particles can be used for EV size-estimation in these specific conditions."
