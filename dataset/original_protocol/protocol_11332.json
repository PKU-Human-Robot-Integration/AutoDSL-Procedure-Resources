    "This study was approved by the Academic Ethics Committee of Inner Mongolia Medical University in Hohhot, China. The parents of all children included in this study provided signed and informed consent. In the study, we used the Actigraph GT3X+ device which is referred to as an accelerometer hereafter.\n1. General aspects of method development\nObtain accelerometers to evaluate PA. The accelerometer is a small (3.3 cm x 4.6 cm x 1.5 cm, 19 g), watch-like unobtrusive device that measures acceleration in three axes: vertical, antero-posterior, and medio-lateral.\nConnect the device to a laptop PC with USB cable. Use an exclusive software for data recording, processing, and analyzing.\nSelect participants according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\t\nInclude 20 children between 7-12 years of age who accept table tennis training as the Sports group. Include children who attend the table tennis club regularly, with three-to-five weekly training session,s with each training session lasting 2 h. Include children living majorly in a house or rented flat with their parents with a short home-to-club distance.\nSelect 20 children from the same class as the Sports group as an age and gender matched Control group. Children of the Control group don't attend any sports club.\nExclude participants whose parents do not know their children's PA information at school and home.\nExclude participants who were diagnosed to have any neurodevelopment disorder such as Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), etc.\n2. Initialization of data collection using the accelerometer\nDownload and run the software for the device.\nType in the duration for collecting data by clicking the button Select Start Time and entering the date (e.g., 2022/2/9) and time (e.g., 13:00).",
    "Click the button Enter Subject Info to enter the next step about demographic information setting. Type in the demographic information of the participant, including name, gender, height, weight, date of birth, ethnic, side (right), limb (waist), and dominance (dominant).\n\tNOTE: For the left-handed participants, in step 2.4 select the opposite side.\nInitialize the data collection by clicking Initialize 1 device. Make sure that the battery is charged to more than 80%, otherwise the initialization will fail. Initialize to record raw accelerations at a frequency of 30 Hz.\nInstruct the participants to wear the accelerometer on the right hip with an elastic waistband. Ensure that the accelerometer is positioned on the right mid-axilla line at the level of the iliac crest.\nRepeat step 2.2. Set the same start date (e.g., 2022/2/9) and time (e.g., 13:00), to ensure that the data from both devices is collected at the same time.\nRepeat 2.4 with the following modifications: side (left), limb (wrist), dominance (non-dominant).\n\tNOTE: For the left-handed participants, in step 2.8 select the opposite side.\nInstruct the participants to wear the accelerometer on the wrist of the non-dominant hand on a watch belt.\nRemind the participants to wear the devices all day long, except while bathing, swimming, and showering.\n\tNOTE: The duration of data collection should not be shorter than 7 days. (e.g., from 13:00, 2022/2/9 to 12:59, 2022/2/16).\nFor the raw data collected, get the data confirmed by a physician, institutional researcher, or professional coach, according to the VM chart and counts (Figure 1).\nDelete any extreme data that is unexplained (e.g., from 21:41, 2022/2/12 to 22:07, 2022/2/12, the data was zero, and cannot be explained). Delete such data from the collected raw data.\n3. Data collection from diary entries",
    "Ask the participants to wear the device all day long. Ask the trainers to maintain a diary of table tennis training, including the exact time schedule. For the children of the Control group, no diary of training is needed.\nMake sure that the participants performed their daily routines during data collection.\nAsk the parents to maintain a diary of leisure time at home. Instruct the parents to collect the data of sleep, the time to bed, and the time of waking up in the diary.\n4. Accelerometer data output\nTake off the device from the right hip and connect it to a laptop/PC with a USB cable. Run the software of the device.\nDownload the accelerometer data of the participant, by clicking Download. Analyze raw accelerometer data in 60 s epochs.\nTake off the device from the non-dominant hand and connect it to a laptop/PC with a USB cable. Repeat step 4.2.\nRaw acceleration outcome variables for the accelerometer are based on vector magnitude (VM) counts. Confirm the accelerometer data of LTPA according to the diary of training, leisure time, and sleep.\n5. Scoring the data\nOpen the scoring page of the software (Figure 2).\nSelect Algorithms > Cut Points and MVPA > Puyau Children (2002) on the left of the page.\n\tNOTE: Other algorithms for the cut points of PA can be selected if necessary.\nClick Calculate and then Export, and the scoring output will be displayed automatically, including SBs (sedentary behaviors), LPAs (light physical activities), MPAs (moderate physical activities), and MVPAs (moderate-to-vigorous physical activities).",
    "Obtain everyday-LTPA by adding diary timing and defining leisure time (e.g., the leisure time of 2022/2/9 is from 19:00, 2022/2/9 to 21:00 2022/2/6, according to the diary). Then, define the mean VM counts during this time as 715.75, and the LTPA for this epoch as 715.75.\nAverage all the everyday-LTPAs, to get the LTPA for the participant.\n6. Statistical analysis\nUse Student's t-test to measure group differences with a P value less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Use a commercially available statistical software package to conduct all statistics.\nUse the Bland-Altman procedures to assess agreement for each PA, including MPA, VPA, and MVPA, between hip-worn and wrist-worn devices based on raw data and counts. Calculate the mean difference between the two methods of measurement and 95% limit of agreement for the mean difference calculated.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
