    "NK cell culture supernatants preparation Maintain the NK cells expanded in vitro in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.Change the FBS to exosome-free FBS on the 14th day of culture and continue the culture for two days.Note: Exosome-free FBS is obtained by centrifugation of FBS at 100,000× g for 16 h followed by the collection of supernatants. Adjust cell density to 1 × 109 cells/500 mL and collect the cell culture supernatant for pretreatment.Centrifuge the cell culture supernatant at 300× g for 10 min to remove cells and then transfer the supernatant to a new centrifuge tube.Note: The centrifugal force of the first step should be controlled below 350× g to avoid damage to NK cells. Centrifuge the supernatant obtained in the previous step again at 2,000× g for 10 min to remove cell debris, and then transfer the supernatant to the sample cup of the TFF system for subsequent treatment.Note: The volume of supernatant can be increased by increasing the number of sample cups or by adding liquid multiple times to a single sample cup. Concentration of NK cell culture supernatants by TFF system Note: All the following steps are performed at 4 °C; for reference, we performed all steps in cold storage. Connect the sample cup, the liquid inlet pipe, the peristaltic pump, the filter cassettes (100 kD), the liquid outlet pipe, the waste liquid pipe, and the waste liquid cup successively, and install the pressure indicator at the connection of the liquid outlet pipe to complete assembly of the TFF system (Kim et al., 2021).Note: The sample cup should be autoclaved in advance, and the entire TFF system should be sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation 30 min before operation.",
    "Add the pretreated cell culture supernatants from steps A4–A5 into the sample cup, start the peristaltic pump, and concentrate at a pressure of 2.5 bar until the concentrated volume is approximately 13 mL.Transfer the concentrate to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and add 10 mL of PBS into the sample cup.Reduce the pressure of the peristaltic pump to 1 bar.After recirculating the TFF system approximately five times, shut down the peristaltic pump and transfer PBS to the above 50 mL centrifuge tube.Note: All residual fluid in the pipeline should be drained as far as possible to improve exosome recovery. Preparation of NK-Exo using ultracentrifugation Note: All following steps should be performed at 4 °C as much as possible; steps in the biosafety cabinet should be performed on ice. Transfer the concentrated solution from step B5 to an ultra-speed centrifuge–fitted centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 10,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C; then, filter through a 0.22 μm filter.Note: The centrifuge tube should be irradiated by UV 30 min in advance, and all following steps should be performed aseptically in the biosafety cabinet. Centrifuge the liquid from the previous step at 100,000× g for 70 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatants, re-suspend the exosome pellet with 20 mL of precooled PBS, and centrifuge again at 100,000× g for 70 min at 4 °C.Note: The suspended liquid should account for at least 1/2 of the centrifugal tube volume, so as not to damage the centrifugal tube due to high centrifugal force. Remove and re-suspend the supernatants with 500 μL of PBS. Then, immediately use or store at -80 °C.Note: NK-Exo should be used as soon as possible or stored at -80 °C for up to three months.",
    "Detection of particle concentration, particle size, and phenotypes by nanoflow cytometry Calibrate the particle concentration of the instrument with 200 nm PE and AF488 fluorescent-conjugated polystyrene beads and calibrate the particle size of the instrument with silica nanosphere cocktail.Dilute NK-Exo serially to an optimal recording range of 2,000–12,000 particles/min during the final detection and record all particles passing through the 1 min interval during each detection.Notes:  NK-Exo should be diluted at a ratio of 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1,000 until its detection rate reaches 2,000–12,000 particles/min. Incubation should be done in dark conditions. Then, wash the dyeing mixture with PBS and centrifuge at 100,000× g for 70 min at 4 °C.Note: PBS should account for at least 1/2 of the centrifugal tube volume, so as not to damage the centrifugal tube due to high centrifugal force. Re-suspend NK-Exo with 50 μL of PBS and test by nanoflow cytometry.Using a standard curve, convert the flow rate and lateral scattering intensity to the corresponding concentrations and size in NanoFCM software.NK-Exo detection by transmission electron microscopy Re-suspend exosomes (> 109/mL) purified from NK cell supernatants in 50 μL of PBS.Obtain a 10 μL sample and drop it on a copper grid. After 1 min of precipitation, use a filter paper to remove the excess liquid.Obtain 10 μL of uranyl acetate and add it onto the copper grid to precipitate for 1 min; use a filter paper to remove the excess liquid.After drying at room temperature for several minutes, the image results are obtained using a transmission electron microscope (100 kV).NK-Exo detection by western blot analysis Add 150 μL of RIPA containing 1.5 μL protease inhibitor (PMSF) to NK-Exo. After leaving to crack on ice for 5 min, collect the supernatants after centrifugation at 13,000× g for 20 min.",
    "Note: These steps are performed at 4 °C. Add 5× loading buffer to the supernatants obtained in the previous step and heat at 95 °C for 10 min.Separate the products from the previous step by 12% SDS-PAGE and use 10–180 kD marker as an indicator ruler.Note: Choose the gel percentage according to the molecular weight of the protein of interest. Run the gel in running buffer at 80 V for approximately 30 min, then adjust the voltage to 120 V and run for 50 min until the loading dye reaches the bottom of the gel.Note: The run time may vary according to the equipment used or type and percentage of gel. Transfer the gel using a PVDF membrane at 300 mA for 80 min in transfer buffer.Block the membrane with Western blocking buffer at room temperature for 2 h.Incubate the membranes with primary antibodies (Table 1) overnight and shake at 4 °C.Wash the membranes in 1× TBST three times for 10 min each time.Incubate the membrane with the appropriate secondary antibody (Table 1) and shake at room temperature for 2 h.Wash the membrane three times with 1× TBST for 10 min each timeImages are displayed using Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate under chemiluminescence instrument.For phenotype analysis, NK-Exo is first suspended in 50 μL of PBS according to the concentration of 1 × 109 particles/mL, mixed with 5 μL of PE-conjugated mouse anti-human CD56 (a marker of NK cells) and FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD107a (a marker for NK cell degranulation), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min.NK-Exo uptake Stain NK-Exo with PKH67 green fluorescent cell linker Midi kit and mix NK-Exo with diluent buffer (Diluent C).Note: Do not use a vortex to mix vigorously; use a pipette to gently mix.",
    "Add the NK-Exo mixture from the previous step into the pre-prepared 2× PKH67 dye solution, mix gently, and incubate for 4 min.Note: NK-Exo must be added to the dye solution—the order must not be changed—and the dye must be mixed from time to time during incubation. Add an equal volume of FBS to stop staining for 1 min.Centrifuge at 100,000× g for 70 min to wash the residual dye.Note: If the dyed exosomes are not used immediately, they can be stored at -80 in the dark for one week. Culture SKOV3 cells in 24-well plates with 5 × 104 cells per well and add 20 μg of NK-Exo to each well for a 6 h co-culture at 37 .After incubation, wash the cells with PBS and fix in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stain the nuclei with DAPI.Note: Washing with PBS should be sufficient to avoid residual dye affecting the experimental results. Image using a fluorescence microscope and quantify the uptake of NK-Exo by SKOV3 cells using ImageJ 1.53a software.Functional characterization of NK-Exo To evaluate the cytotoxicity of NK-Exo on tumor cells, add SKOV3 and OV-90 ovarian cells into 96-well plates at the concentration of 1 × 104 cells per well.Add NK-Exo with a concentration of 80 μg/mL to each well and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h.Add 10 μL of Cell Counting kit 8 (CCK8) reagent to each well and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h.Note: For this suspension volume, 10 μL of CCK8 reagent was added to each well. For other volumes, a corresponding volume of CCK8 is added. Measure cell viability at 450 nm. Repeat each experiment in triplicate and analyze statistically using GraphPad Prism 8 software.",
    "Calculate cell survival rate using the following formula:Survival rate = (ODexperiment - ODblank)/(ODcontrol - ODblank) × 100%Use an Annexin -FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit to detect the proportion of tumor cell apoptosis induced by NK-Exo.Pre-treat SKOV3 and A2780 ovarian cancer cells with 80 μg/mL of NK-Exo for 24 h.Wash cells twice with 1× PBS and re-suspend in 1× binding buffer.Stain with 5 μL of Annexin -FITC for 10 min in the dark, followed by 5 μL of PI for 5 min before flow cytometry analysis.Use a flow cytometer for quantification of apoptotic cells and analyze with FlowJo 10."
