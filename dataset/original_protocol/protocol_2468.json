    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCD34+ cells isolation from cord blood\nTiming: 6–8 h\nHuman CD34+ cells are isolated from human cord blood and cryopreserved in order to be used whenever mice humanization is required.\nNote: Cord blood unit quality varies. Investigator should order cord bloods <36 h post-partum and with a weight greater than 100 g.\nCritical: Cord blood units, being recently post-partum, are usually not tested for infectious virus presence such as HIV or hepatitis. For this reason, it is crucial that the researcher works in sterile conditions and with appropriate PPE (Personal Protection Equipment).\nDilute cord blood 1:2 with PBS-EDTA.\nIsolate mononuclear cells.\nAdd 15 mL of Ficoll-Paque Premium to 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nLayer 30 mL of the diluted blood carefully on top of the Ficoll.\nCritical: Add the diluted blood at the minimum speed with the pipette controller and touching the wall of the falcon tube, avoiding the mixing of the blood and the Ficoll. Do not let the blood lie on the Ficoll for more than 10 min or it will start mixing. Additionally, when going to the centrifuge, take care not to disturb the gradient.\nCentrifuge tubes at 400 g for 30 min at 21°C without acceleration or brake in a swing-bucket rotor centrifuge.\nAspirate the upper yellow layer (plasma), leaving the white thin layer (mononuclear cells) undisturbed. Harvest the white layer with a 5 mL pipette and transfer it to a new 50 mL tube, taking care of taking as little Ficoll as possible (transparent layer under the mononuclear cells). Top up with PBS-EDTA diluting it at least 4 times.\nCentrifuge at 700 g for 10 min at RT. Aspirate supernatant.\nPut together the pellets in two 50 mL Falcon tubes per cord blood and centrifuge at 700 g 5 min.",
    "Lyse red blood cells.\nAdd 5 mL of warm 1× RBC Lysis Buffer per falcon tube. Incubate at RT for 4 min, gently shaking them for the first 2 min. Top up with PBS-EDTA.\nCentrifuge at 600 g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant and check if the pellet is white. If not, repeat step 3a. one more time for a maximum of two RBC Lysis Buffer incubations.\nCount mononuclear cells.\nResuspend and mix both pellets together in 40 mL of PBS 1×. Count cells with the desired method.\nTransfer 0.5∗106 cells to an Eppendorf tube and keep on ice. This will be the “Pre-enrichment sample”. Always use the same counter to have more reproducible results.\nCentrifuge at 600 g for 5 min the rest of the cells.\nPurify CD34+ cells.\nPrepare a cell suspension at 50∗106 cells/mL in recommended medium and transfer it to a 14 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube.\nCritical: Investigators are strongly encouraged to use polystyrene tubes, as they have been proven to work much better than other material tubes for magnetic separation.\nAdd the EasySep Human Progenitor Cell Enrichment Cocktail with Platelet depletion at 50 μL/mL of cells. Mix well and incubate 15 min at RT with overhead shaking.\nVortex the EasySep D Magnetic Particles for 30 s and add 100 μL/mL of cells. Mix well and incubate 15 min at RT with overhead shaking, avoiding sedimentation.\nPlace the tube without cap in a suitable magnet for the round bottom tube. Set aside for 10 min.\nNote: This protocol is performed with a negative magnetic enrichment of CD34+ cells. There are alternatives of positive enrichment of CD34+ cells commercially available, although is preferably to leave the desired cell population undisturbed.",
    "Note: This protocol is performed with a specific magnet and specific polystyrene tubes that fit into, but investigators could perform the magnetic separation with different material.\nHarvest the supernatant by inverting the tube without getting it out of the magnet.\nCritical: Do not collect the supernatant with a pipette or you will collect magnetic particles bound to undesired cell types. Supernatant has to be collected by inversion.\nCentrifuge at 600 g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 2 mL PBS 1×.\nCount cells with desired method. Take a note of the number of CD34+ cells obtained after the purification.\nTransfer 20,000 cells to an Eppendorf tube and keep on ice. This will be the “Post-enrichment sample”\nIf not going to be used the same day, cryopreserve purified CD34+ cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 600 g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend pellet in 500 μL of CryoStor CS10 freezing medium (one vial per cord blood unit). Use Mr. Frosty and store at −80°C for 24 h.\nTransfer vials to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.\nEvaluate enrichment of the sample by flow cytometry.\nAdd 500 μL of FACS buffer to the Pre and Post-enrichment samples for 20 min at 4°C to block membrane proteins.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min, discard supernatant, and add anti-huCD45-PE and anti-huCD34-AF488 at a 1/300 dilution in FACS buffer, 100 μL per sample. Incubate 30 min at 4°C, protected from light.\nCentrifuge, discard supernatant, and add the viability marker propidium iodide (PI) at a 1/500 dilution in PBS 1×, 300 μL per sample.\nNote: Different viability markers can be used, such as DAPI, Zombie Aqua, etc. If changed, the investigator should take into account the possible overlap with the other fluorophores.",
    "Analyze the enrichment of CD34+ cells in the Pre and Post-enrichment samples in the cytometer, by means of double positive CD45+ and CD34+ cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2101-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gating strategy for the number determination of CD34+ cells pre and post-enrichment\nFlow cytometry plots displaying a representative analysis of CD34+ cells in a cord blood unit in the pre and post-enrichment samples. Arrows represent the steps of the gating strategy used in this protocol.\nNote: This protocol has been performed with BD Bioscience cytometers, the BD FACSCanto II and the BD FACSCelesta. Other cytometers could be used if they allow the analysis of the specified panel. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software.\nNote: Comparison between Pre and Post-enrichment sample will give the investigator the efficacy of the enrichment of CD34+ cells performed. This can vary between samples.\nPDX generation\nTiming: 6–12 months\nThis step describes the process to generate and expand PDXs from both primary and metastatic tumor samples from breast, pancreatic, colorectal or gastric cancer origin.\nOptional: Biopsies can be frozen in Bambanker before implantation, although it is not recommended.\nCollect the sample from the clinicians.\nNote: It is crucial to have a good circuit of biopsies and surgery samples between clinicians and researchers, so that samples get to the investigator in the best possible conditions.\nNote: This protocol is optimized for fresh samples from either surgery pieces or core-needle breast biopsy (CNB), and implanted in female immunodeficient mice, such as NOD.SCID or NSG.\nTransfer the tumor sample to a 50 mL falcon tube with 10 mL DMEM:F12 media supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin.\nIn sterile conditions under laminar flow hood, place the tumor sample in a sterile plastic dish and mechanistically dissociate it with scalpels in fragments of approximately 3 × 3 mm.",
    "For mice orthotopical implantation of breast cancer tumor pieces, these steps should be followed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2101-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Orthotopic implantation of a breast cancer PDX in the mice mammary fat pad\nImages showing the process of the PDX implantation. From left to right, incision and exposure of the mammary fat pad, PDX implantation and suture of the wound. Scale bar represents 5 mm.\nAnesthetize the female mouse by injecting intraperitoneally the ketamine-xylazine mix. Put a drop of methocel to each mouse eye to prevent eye drying and consequent blindness.\nShave the ventral area of the mouse.\nExpose the 4th pair of mammary glands (abdominal ones) with a minimal incision.\nPlace a fragment subcutaneously of top of the exposed mammary gland. One tumor piece per flank. Pieces should not be larger than 3 × 3 mm.\nClose the wound using surgical absorbable suture.\nFor breast cancer PDXs, maintain mice with 17-β-estradiol at 1 μM in the drinking water.\nNote: Ketamine-Xilacine mix should not be stored for more than 1 month at RT (20°C–25°C).\nFor mice subcutaneous implantation of pancreatic, colorectal and gastric cancer tumor pieces these steps should be followed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2101-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Subcutaneous implantation of a pancreatic cancer PDX in mice\nImages showing the process of the PDX implantation. From left to right, incision of the back of the mouse, PDX implantation and suture of the wound. Scale bar represents 5 mm.\nAnesthetize the mouse by injecting intraperitoneally the ketamine-xylazine mix. Put a drop of methocel to each mouse eye to prevent eye drying and consequent blindness.\nShave the back area of the mouse.\nExpose left and right flanks with a minimal incision.\nPlace each fragment subcutaneously. One tumor piece per flank. Pieces should not be larger than 3 × 3 mm3.",
    "Close the wound using surgical absorbable suture.\nMonitor tumor growth by measuring once a week the volume of the PDX with calipers and using the formula: (length × (width)∗2)/(π/6).\nBefore tumors reach a volume of 1,000 mm3, mice should be euthanized and tumors resected and cut in pieces to be expanded for the next PDX passage into new mice. Follow steps 11 or 12 to implant them again.\nOptional: The rest of the excised tumor pieces that are not implanted into new mice should be kept as a cryopreserved material using Bambanker cryopreservation media or as Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) blocks. These preservations will allow the researcher to recover old PDX passages and further study its biology. Ideally, after every PDX passage a piece of the tumor should be assayed for a complete pathogen infection (in particular C. Bovis). This can be performed by different companies with a variety of pathogen analysis by PCR. Our group uses IMPACT Mouse Profiles from IDEXX Bionalytics.\nOptional: After the first passage, PDXs could be digested and implanted as steps 19 and 20.\nNote: We recommend female mice for usage with all PDX generation, as male mice tend to be more aggressive and mouse death occur more often.\nMice humanization\nTiming: 5 months\nImmunodeficient NSG mice are humanized with CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in order to generate a large variety of immune cell types mimicking what would be a human immune system.\nMyeloablate NSG mice by injecting 15 mg/kg busulfan intraperitoneally in PBS 1× 24 h before CD34+ cells injection (200 μL per mouse).\nOptional: Mice myeloablation can be done by irradiation. Investigator should decide the best strategy. In our case, busulfan was decided because it does not affect the animals’ health.",
    "Defreeze the CD34+ cells. When using cells purified the same day, this step is not necessary.\nPut the frozen vials in a 37°C water bath until CS10 frozen media is liquid.\nTransfer the cells to 15 mL falcon tubes containing 10 mL of defreeze media. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 10 min and resuspend in 500 μL of defreeze media.\nCount cells with the desired method.\nTake 20,000 cells for staining and follow step 7.\nCalculate cells for injection, considering cell number, viability and CD34+ staining.\nInject 105 CD34+ cells per mouse in 100 μL PBS into the tail vein, using 27G needles and 1 mL syringes.\nNote: Preferably use vials with >0.5 × 106 of CD34+ cells for humanization, increasing the number of mice humanized with the same unit and avoiding variability.\nCritical: Humanization must be performed in young NSG mice, up to 6 weeks.\nAfter 20 weeks of CD34+ cells injection, analyze humanization levels in peripheral blood.\nCollect a minimum of 50 μL of blood per mouse from the facial vein using Microvette heparinized tubes.\nTransfer 50 μL of blood to 15 mL falcon tubes and add 2 mL of RBC Lysis Buffer to each tube. Incubate for 4 min at RT with gently shaking for the first 2 min.\nCritical: Mice erythrocytes are harder to lyse; therefore, the sample should be incubated with at least 2 mL of RBC lysis buffer.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min and aspirate supernatant. Repeat step 18b once again if the pellet is still red, to a maximum of two RBC Lysis Buffer incubations. Pellet should be light orange.\nResuspend pellet in 200 μL and transfer all the volume to a well of a V-bottom shape 96-well-plate.",
    "Centrifuge the plate at 400 g for 5 min and remove supernatant throwing it directly to the bin or sink with a single move. Add 200 μL of FACS buffer per well and incubate 20 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge the plate, remove supernatant, and add primary antibodies in FACS buffer. Add 100 μL per well and incubate at 4°C protected from light for 30 min. The antibody cocktail, all at 1/300 dilution, consists of:\nmuCD45-AF488.\nhuCD45-PE.\nhuCD4-BV421.\nhuCD8-PE/Cy7.\nNote: This protocol is optimized for this antibody cocktail, if other antibodies are used, investigators should titrate them.\nCentrifuge the plate and resuspend pellet in 120 μL PBS 1× with 1/500 viability marker Zombie Aqua.\nAnalyze in the cytometer, acquiring 80 μL per well in the V-bottom 96wp with the HTS mode from the cytometer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2101-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Gating strategy for the percentage determination of huCD45+ cells in humanized mice blood\nFlow cytometry plots showing a representative analysis of mice humanization in peripheral blood. Arrows represent the steps of the gating strategy used in this protocol.\nCritical: A minimum of 20% human CD45+ cells in the peripheral blood of the mice is required to consider it humanized. Investigators should use more mice and cord blood units than expected to assure the availability of humanized mice when desired. Usually, around 30% of CD34+ cells are lost after thawing. The ratio of success of mice humanization after 5 months is around 70%.\nGeneration of an acquired immunoresistance model in PDX\nTiming: Around 1 year\nThis step describes the process to generate a model of acquired immunotherapy resistance to T Cell Bispecific antibodies (TCBs) or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR Ts) with PDX in humanized mice.",
    "Note: This protocol could be used to generate models of resistance to other immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nDigest the PDX sample.\nExcise the tumor from the mice bearing it before it reaches 1,000 mm3.\nIn sterile conditions under laminar flow hood, place the tumor sample in a sterile plastic dish and mechanistically dissociate it with scalpels until you obtain a tumor mass.\nCollect the sample with 10 mL of enzymatic digestion mix and put it into 50 mL falcon tubes. This enzymatic mix has to be freshly prepared everytime.\nPlace the tubes horizontally in a shaker at 37°C and 70 rpm (10 g) for 1 h.\nFilter the mixture with 100 μm cell strainers into new 50 mL falcon tubes. If the sample does not go through, you can force it with the back of a sterile syringe.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 400 g and aspirate supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL of warm 1× RBC Lysis Buffer per falcon tube. Incubate at RT for 4 min, gently shaking them for the first 2 min. Top up with PBS 1×.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant and check if the pellet is white. If not, repeat step 3a. one more time for a maximum of two RBC Lysis Buffer incubations.\nResuspend cells with PBS 1× and count cell number.\nNote: Digestion of the tumor is recommended for a more homogenous mix of the original tumor, as heterogeneity of the previous tumor passage can mask the differential response of the tumors.\nImplant cells into new humanized mice.\nResuspend the desired number of cells in a 1:1 mixture of PBS 1× and Matrigel and place the sample into Eppendorf tubes in ice.",
    "Inject 100 μL of cells orthotopically or subcutaneously depending on the tumor origin as in steps 11 or 12. Cell number should be assayed by researcher as it depends on the PDX, but normally 106 should be sufficient.\nMonitor tumor growth by measuring once a week the volume of the PDX with calipers and using the formula: (length × (width)∗2)/(π/6). When tumor is palpable, measure should be done twice a week.\nWhen tumors reach 300 mm3, start the treatment with increasing concentrations.\nWhen treating with a TCB, depending on the tumor expression of the targeted antigen and the potency of the TCB, a wide range of concentrations from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg have been observed by our group to be ideal. Treatments are performed twice a week (Martínez-Sabadell et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Arenas et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Rius Ruiz et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nWhen treating with CAR T cells, 3 × 106 have been observed to be efficacious regardless the targeted antigen. Treatments are performed once a week or once every 14 days.\nNote: A pilot in vivo experiment with the desired treatment is recommended to decide the starting dose of the treatment for immunoresistant PDX generation. A dose in which tumor complete response is not achieved is recommended. Tumors should reach a 90% of tumor response with a volume around 100 mm3 in order to be transplanted.\nWhen tumor regresses, stop the treatment and let the tumor grow. When regrown, treatment can be restarted again. This process can be sustained for up to 5 months, as lymphocytes get exhausted after chronic treatment. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Note: Mice humanized with CD34+ cells do not present graft vs host symptoms, which gives the advantage that mice can last for more than 180 days after PDX implantation. Ideally, investigators should assay mice humanization every 2–3 months, as immune cells can get exhausted and the mice loose its humanization phenotype due to treatment.\nPassage the tumor digesting it as in steps 19 and 20.\nNote: Investigators should cryopreserve a tumor pellet in Bambanker after every passage so that the model is not lost due to technical problems in the future.\nNote: In our experience, resistance to TCBs or CAR Ts is achieved after 3 passages. Each immunoresistant PDX model should be treated independently. This will allow to have a greater number of immunoresistant PDX models, and therefore strength the identified mechanism of resistance.\nConfirm the acquired resistance phenotype of the generated model by performing an in vivo experiment with the parental PDX and the newly generated resistant PDX.\nNote: Mice should be randomized before implantation according to levels of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood, and it should be noted which mice belongs to which cord blood unit.\nCritical: For downstream studies such as immunohistochemistry, protein isolation or RNA isolation tumor pieces are used, and a minimum number of 6 replicates should be assayed, as PDX tumor pieces can be heterogenous."
