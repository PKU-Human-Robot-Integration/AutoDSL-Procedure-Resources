    "1. Growth of an age-synchronized population of C. elegans\nMaintain the C. elegans strains on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 at 20 °C according to standard procedures18.\nPerform a synchronized egg-lay by placing 10 adult nematodes onto a 6 cm seeded NGM plate with a platinum worm pick. Leave the adults to lay eggs for ~2 h at 20 °C before removing them. Prepare 1-4 plates per strain, depending on the fertility of the strain and the number of time points to be taken.\nPlace the plates with eggs in the incubator at 20 °C. Monitor the development of the animals until they reach adulthood.\n\tNOTE: The day on which the animals have reached adulthood is defined here as day 1. Typically, this is three days after the egg-lay.\nStarting from day 1, transfer the animals to new seeded NGM plates daily to separate them from their offspring. To compensate for animals that die or are lost during transfer, transfer ~40 animals per strain times the number of points to be imaged (see step 2). Proceed until the animals have ceased to lay fertilized eggs (~day 6 of adulthood).\n\t​NOTE: Exclude animals with bagging or other developmental phenotypes. Bagging is commonly observed in strains expressing aggregation-prone proteins.\n2. Sample preparation of C. elegans in a multiwell plate\nNOTE: As the imaging procedure requires anesthetics that will eventually kill the animals, the same animals cannot be reused for subsequent time points. Instead, different animals from the same age-synchronized batch are imaged on different days. Even though most strains will have few inclusions at day 1, it is recommended to include this time point as a baseline.",
    "Prepare the 384-well plate by filling the required number of wells with 100 µL of M9 buffer supplemented with 25 mM NaN3 as an anesthetic. Fill one well per strain to be imaged.\n\tNOTE: Sodium azide (NaN3) is toxic and should be handled with care.\nFor each strain, transfer 20 animals into one well using a platinum worm pick.\n\t​NOTE: The worms must be placed outside the bacterial lawn before placing them in the well. Bacteria make the animals adhere to the worm pick, which can prevent their release and will cloud the well contents. Generally, 20 is the optimal number of animals per well to prevent overlap between the worms while limiting unnecessary imaging of empty well space.\nCover the plate with the lid to prevent evaporation, and image the plate within 1 h after preparation.\nRepeat steps 2.1-2.3 daily until a steady plateau in the inclusion numbers is reached or until most animals have died. Perform the sample preparation and imaging at the same time every day to ensure intervals of 24 h.\n3. Image acquisition on the high-throughput confocal microscope\nNOTE: This experiment can also be set up on a regular spinning disk confocal microscope with a multiwell plate holder. A camera with a large field-of-view is beneficial to limit the number of tiles needed to be imaged to span the entire well. See the Table of Materials for details about the microscope and software used in this protocol.\nSwitch on the instrument and open the software.\nStart a new protocol by going to Measurement Settings | New. Select the correct multiwell plate type and click Create a New Measurement Setting.",
    "Set up the channel for fluorescence by going to Ch 1. Set the objective to 10x. Select 488 nm as the light source and BP525/25 as the emission filter to image YFP. Set binning to 2x2 to reduce file size.\nClick Add Channel and select Brightfield as the method.\nTo add a z-stack confocal fluorescence image to the measurement, choose 3D Fluorescence acquisition under Action List. Go to Select and choose Ch 1. To minimize file sizes, set Image Processing to Maximum so that the maximum projection image is saved rather than the full z-stack.\nClick BF/Ph Acquisition | Select | Ch 2 for the brightfield channel.\nClick on the play button (look for the right-pointing triangle symbol) next to Unload Well Plates and place the 384-well plate in the microscope.\nUnder 3D Fluorescence Acquisition, click Test and select a well containing worms to determine the optimal shifting distance at which the worms are centered correctly. Set Ascending Distance to 50 µm, Descending Distance to -50 µm, and Slicing Interval to 2 µm to capture the entire thickness of the animals in the z-stack.\nOptimize the exposure time to get a good signal intensity for all four strains while avoiding saturation. Use the same exposure time for all strains and time points.\nSelect the wells to be imaged under Well Plate Scan Setting. Select Tile and Acquire Whole Well.\nSave the Measurement Setting and start the experiment by clicking Start Measurement. For subsequent time points, open the same Measurement Setting and adjust the shifting distance and the wells to be imaged.\n4. Stitching tiled images in ImageJ",
    "NOTE: This step is only required when using an objective larger than 4x, for which the image of each well is acquired as multiple tiles. In this analysis workflow, stitching of the tiles is performed using the free software FIJI/ImageJ19 (Figure 2). Depending on the instrument used in step 3, it may also be possible to perform stitching directly in the accompanying software.\nDownload FIJI20 and open it.\nGo to Plugins | Stitching | Grid/Collection Stitching21.\nIn the popup window, Grid/Collection Stitching, select the type and order by which the tiles were collected. Choose Grid: row-by-row and Right & Down.\nIn the next window, Grid stitching: Grid: row-by-row, Right & Down, insert the number of tiles in x and y directions. For the 10x objective used here, choose 2 as the Grid size x, 3 as the Grid size y, and 0 as the Tile overlap.\nClick Browse and select the folder containing the TIFF images to be stitched.\nInsert the common file name under File names for tiles, using {i} at the position of the tile number in each file name.\nUntick all boxes below.\nRun the plugin.\nSave the resulting images as TIFF files for analysis in the next step.\n5. Automated inclusion counting using CellProfiler22\nDownload and install the open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler23. Download the InclusionCounting.cpproj pipeline from github.com/sinnigelab/aggregate-quantification.\nOpen CellProfiler and drag the pipeline into the Drop a pipeline file here window. Click Yes to load the project.\nClick on the Images input module and drag the stitched images into the window Drop files and folder here.\nClick on the Metadata input module. Adjust Regular expression to extract from file name according to the names of the stitched images.",
    "Click on the NamesandTypes input module and adjust Select the rule criteria to match the channels in the file names.\n\tNOTE: In the default settings of the pipeline, file names containing BF are recognized as brightfield images and are named Worms. File names containing YFP are recognized as fluorescence images and are named Fluorescence.\nClick on View output settings to select a default folder to save the output from CellProfiler.\nClick on Start Test Mode to check the settings of the pipeline using the first imaging dataset. Click on Run to run through all modules in the pipeline or Step to run through the pipeline one module at a time. To adjust the worm outlines in the EditObjectsManually module, click on Help to see the instructions and click on Done to continue running the pipeline.\n\tNOTE: The extracted measurements will not be exported while in test mode. The thresholding parameters to detect worms and inclusions may need to be adjusted based on the strains and magnification used.\nClick on Exit Test Mode and Analyze Images.\nOpen the output folder to view the output files. Open the images with the original file name followed by outlines to check whether the worms and inclusions were correctly overlaid.\n\tNOTE: The number of inclusions per worm can be found in the file named ExpandedWormObjects. More information about the input images can be found in the file named Image. Additional output can be selected in the ExportToSpreadsheet module in the pipeline.\n6. Global fitting of inclusion count data using AmyloFit5",
    "NOTE: This step can only be performed when data for multiple protein concentrations are available. For Q40-YFP, a set of four strains with different levels of overexpression in the body wall muscle cells has been created previously17. In other cases, novel strains should be generated using plasmid microinjection and genomic integration24.\nGo to the free online fitting platform for aggregation kinetics AmyloFit25. Either register or log in with an existing account.\n\tNOTE: An extensive manual on how to use AmyloFit can be accessed for additional help. See the link on the top-left of the webpage (after login) for more information.\nTo start using AmyloFit, name the project and click on Create project. Open the project by clicking on Open and create a session by giving it a name and clicking on Create & load session.\nClick Add Data and upload the file containing the average numbers of inclusions per animal, following the data format requirements shown in the left panel. Click Load New Data.\nSkip the preprocessing steps, which are not required for inclusion count data, by setting number of points to average over for zero-point offset and number of points to average over for plateau to 0. Click Submit. Repeat this step for each protein concentration (i.e., each column in the uploaded file).\nSelect Custom in the model panel, enter Ncells*(1-exp(-Kcell*m**(n)*(t-1))) in the equation box and click Load model.\n\tNOTE: As AmyloFit was originally designed for the analysis of kinetic data from in vitro assays, a custom-made model must be loaded to analyze the inclusion count data of C. elegans. In the equation used here, Ncells is the number of cells in which inclusion formation takes place, Kcell is the nucleation rate constant, m the intracellular protein concentration, and n the reaction order of nucleation.",
    "Set the parameter types to Global Const for Ncells, Global fit for Kcell and n, and Const for m. Set Value of Ncells to 95 for body wall muscle cells and Initial guess for Kcell and n to 1. Enter the values of m for the different strains in the left panel.\n\tNOTE: Initial guesses are not relevant for the relatively simple model used here. For more complex models, it is beneficial to enter an estimate of the expected values to shorten the calculation time.\nLeave the number of basin hops unchanged and click Fit in the fitting panel.\nExtract the fit by clicking Download Data and Fit.\n\tNOTE: The parameters extracted by the global fit of the model will be listed in the bottom-right corner. A plot of the data and fit will be automatically generated in the top-right panel. This plot can be extracted by clicking Download pdf and customized by going to Display Plot Options. Kcell has units of molecules concentration-n time-1 cell-1. To compare values with different n, Kcell can be converted to the nucleation rate at a given protein concentration by multiplying it with mn."
