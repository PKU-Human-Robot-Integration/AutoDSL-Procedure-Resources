    "Preparation of cell culture sample for volatile metabolite analysisChorionic villus samples (CVS) from three independent samples60 mm culture dishes are coated with 2 ml of 0.1% gelatin and incubated at 37 °C for at least 20 min.CVS cells are disaggregated after several PBS washes by serial incubation with collagenase XI at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min. Aggregates are dissociated using gentle pipetting, centrifuged at 266 x g for 10 min and seeded on three gelatin-coated 60 mm culture dishes with 2 ml Chang medium (see Recipes) as previously described in Spitalieri et al., 2009.CVS cells are detached from 25 cm2 culture flasks using trypsin and seeded at 2.5 x 106 with 2 ml Chang medium (see Recipes) on three gelatin-coated 60 mm culture dishes.Cell culture dishes are incubated at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2 for 24 h.Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)CVS cells are reprogrammed in human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using a single lentiviral ‘stem cell cassette’, flanked by loxP sites (hSTEMCCA-loxP), encoding for reprogramming factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) in a single polycistronic vector (Spitalieri et al., 2015). Details are reported in Figure 3.Once derived, hiPS cells are expanded, using mechanical passage under the stereomicroscope when reach confluence (Please see Note 1) and placed on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers on until line is well established in 35 mm culture plates for at least five passages. hiPSC medium (see Recipes) is changed every day. Please see Note 2.Three independent hiPS cell lines with different genotype are passaged on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers with 2 ml hiPSC medium on 60 mm culture dish (4 x 106 cells/dish). Please see Note 2.",

Timeline of GC/MS analysis in CVS cells and hiPSCs. CVS cells are isolated from human samples, analyzed for volatile metabolite by SPME linked to GC/MS and then reprogrammed in hiPSCs. Embryonic stem cell-like colonies are observed on feeder layers after 14 days of infection and after expansion using mechanical passage are subjected to VOCs analysis.Floating EBs Days 1 to 6 Neural induction is performed after the formation of cell aggregates called embryoid bodies (EBs) as reported, with some modifications, by Nakahama and Di Pasquale, 2016.hiPS cell lines are treated with collagenase IV/Accutase solution at 37 °C for 8 min and detached from the plate bottom using a cell scraper. The colonies are collected in a 15 ml conical tube, centrifuged at 17 x g for 5 min and plated in hiPSC medium without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on ultra-low attachment plates in 2:1 ratio (e.g., for two 35 mm dish of hiPSCs, use 1 dish of 60 mm ultra-low attachment dish). The cell pellet is gently resuspended, avoiding to break up clumps too much. Please see Note 3. hiPSC medium without bFGF is daily changed for the first 6 days, except for the day after passage. Please see Note 4.To change medium EBs are collected in a 15 ml conical tube, centrifuged at 17 x g for 5 min and gently resuspended in fresh medium.Three independent floating EBs samples (2 x 106 samples/dish) are placed in 2 ml hiPSC medium without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on 60 mm ultra-low attachment culture dishes.Cell culture dishes are incubated at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2 for 24 h.",
    "Days 7 to 13On day 7, EBs are collected using a 10 ml pipette into a 15 ml conical tube under the stereomicroscope, centrifuged at 17 x g for 5 min and gently resuspended in EB medium 1 (see Recipe 4).Cell culture dishes are incubated at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2 and EB medium 1 is daily changed for another week.Days 14 to 20On day 14, EB medium 1 is removed and replaced with EB medium 2 (see Recipe 5), following the same procedure reported above at step A3e.Cell culture dishes are incubated at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2 and EB medium 2 is daily changed for another 7 days.Day 21Early Neural Progenitors (NPs)60 mm Petri dishes are coated with 0.01% poly-L-ornithine overnight at 37 °C and then with 20 µg/ml laminin for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates are washed with PBS three times and left in a laminar flow hood to dry (Varga et al., 2014).Floating EBs are collected into a 15 ml conical tube, centrifuged at 17 x g for 5 min and gently resuspended and transferred onto 60 mm poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated-plates (Varga et al., 2014) in 2 ml EB medium 2.Cell culture dishes are incubated at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% for 24 h. All samples preparation are performed as previously described in Capuano et al., 2017.Differentiation steps of hiPSCs into NPs and timeline of analysis are shown in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130175401_1225.jpgFigure 4. Timeline of GC/MS sampling during NPs differentiation. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are differentiated into early neural progenitors (NPs) through the formation of floating embryoid bodies (EBs).",
    "VOCs analysis is carried out at different days of differentiation (floating EBs days 1-4, floating EBs days 9-11, floating EBs days 15-18 and early NPs 24 h after plating).Analysis of cell culture volatile metabolite by SPME linked to GC/MSThis protocol is applied to the analysis of the following samples:CVS and hiPSCs after an incubation time of 24 h (after steps A1d and A2d respectively);Floating EBs at different differentiation steps on days 1 and 4, 9 and 11, 15 and 18 (during phases A3e, A3g, A3i respectively);Early Neural Progenitors (NPs) 24 h after plating (after step A4b);Chang medium;hiPSC medium;hiPSC medium without bFGF;EB medium 1;EB medium 2.Note: Cell culture media are always previously incubated for 24 h before VOC sampling. These are the ‘sample zero’ for the analysis of each cell line.The customized lid is sterilized under UV light in a biological hood for 20 min before any sampling procedure, in order to prevent culture contamination.Immediately after sterilization, the lid is put on the Petri dish containing the cell culture of interest cultivated in the incubator.SPME fiber holder is assembled (Figure 5).To ensure the reproducibility of the volatile compounds sampling, it is recommended to set the depth of the SPME needle at the same value. In this experiment, the sampling system required to set it to the 4-depth gauge setting on the plunger.Note: In order to prevent SPME fiber contamination, it is better to assemble this component immediately before its use. Twelve hours before any sampling procedure, SPME fibers have been conditioned following SUPELCO guidelines: DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber was baked at 270 °C for 1 h and then stored in its own box until use. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130175608_9785.jpgFigure 5.

    "Components (a), (b) and (c) constitute the SPME Fiber Holder for use with manual sampling; the element (d) is the needle system that contains and protects DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber.The needle protecting SPME fiber is inserted in the appropriate lid support and then the fiber is exposed to the cell culture headspace.Volatile metabolites are preconcentrated using Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME) technique (Capuano et al., 2017). A 50/30 μm Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PSMS) fiber (SUPELCO) is inserted for 1 h to cell culture headspace. Samples are maintained in the incubator at a temperature of 37 °C and 5% CO2 during fiber exposure, in order to avoid any stress effect on cell growth (Capuano et al., 2017).After VOC adsorption, fiber is pulled inside the needle and removed from the holder to be placed in its box; fiber is stored at 4 °C until GC/MS analysis, performed within three hours.GC/MS analysis is carried out using a GCMS-QP2010 (Shimadzu) equipped with an Equity-5 (or equivalent) capillary column and a proper liner for SPME (for details see Equipment section). The volatile compounds adsorbed onto DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber are desorbed in splitless mode at 250 °C for 3 min in the GC injection port. High-purity helium is used as a carrier gas at 0.7 ml/min of column flow, total flow of 5.9 ml/min and pressure of 24.9 kPa. Analysis is performed working in linear velocity constant mode at 30.2 cm/sec. Inlet, ion source and transfer line temperatures are maintained at 250 °C. Initial oven temperature of 40 °C is maintained for 5 min, followed by temperature gradient to 220 °C at 7 °C/min, then increased by 15 °C/min to a final temperature of 300 °C, held for 3 min (total runtime: 39 min). The mass spectrometer is a single quadrupole analyzer operating in electron ionization mode, with electrons energy of 70 eV.",
    "Mass spectra are recorded from 40 to 450 m/z in full scan mode.Steps from B2 to B8 are summarized in Figure 6.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130175735_1904.jpgFigure 6. Workflow of VOC analysis on cell culture by SPME coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometryChromatogram acquisition and data elaboration are made with Shimadzu workstation software GCMS solution (version 2.4). Chemical identification of detected peaks is performed using both NIST 127 and NIST 147 libraries. Examples of GC/MS spectra are shown in Figures 7 and 8.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130175811_7128.jpgFigure 7.

Comparison of GC/MS spectra derived from total ion chromatograms of the volatile metabolic profiles of Chorionic villus (CVS) (red line), floating embryoid bodies (EBs) at day 9 (black line), human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (blue line) and early neural progenitors (NPs) (pink line). Data elaborated with the GCMS solution software. Volatile compounds profiles may differ from those shown here, in terms of composition and concentration, as a result of altered cell culturing conditions and/or different considered cell lines.The identity of those compounds in Table 1 which are commercially available was validated comparing the retention times and the mass spectra registered in sample chromatograms with those obtained from the analysis of a solution composed by standard compounds and culture media. The VOC collection and the analysis have been performed following the same procedure used for the samples (see steps B6-B8). The abundance of a subset of these compounds was found statistically different among the cells lines (Capuano et al., 2017).Table 1.",
    "List of compounds found in the chromatogram of all samples and for which identification has been validated with an analytical standardimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130180047_8411.jpgStyrene and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol are identified and quantified by comparing the retention times and the mass spectra with those obtained with analytical standards. Three concentrations of Styrene and 1-hexenol-2-ethyl are prepared diluting 1, 10, 100 times the pure compounds in 2 ml of different culture media in 60 mm Petri dishes. VOCs in the headspace are collected by DVB/CAR/PDMS-SPME fiber exposed for 1 h to the sample. The concentration (Cx) of Styrene and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol in the headspace of standard solutions is estimated by Antoine’s law (considered in parts per billion by volume (ppbv)):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130180130_4985.jpgwhere, P is the vapor pressure (bar) and T the working temperature (K). Parameters A, B and C are empirical constants depending on the nature of the substance using the parameters available, in NIST database (http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry[href=http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry]). The amount (Ax) of styrene and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (in ppbv) in the cells culture headspace (CVS, hiPSCs, EBs at different stage, and early NPs) and their culture media is calculated from the peak area in the sample (PAx) and the peak area of the standard (PSx), as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130180230_9878.jpgNote: This procedure is valid for any compound identified by an analytical standard."
