Nucloefection of AAVS1:: opto-α-syn construct into PD hiPSCs using CRISPR-Cas9\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, we employed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based approach combined with optogenetics to investigate α-syn aggregation. By utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we integrated an optogenetic α-syn construct (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) into AAVS1 site which is known as a safe harbor locus4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] of PD hiPSCs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3021-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

The which dotted lines indicate the lack of compact colony formation, and double-headed arrows indicates the spread-out morphology of the cells. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nPrepare puromycin-resistant irradiated DR4 MEFs at least a day before nucleofection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, Day -1).\nThaw a frozen stock of DR4 MEFs in 37°C water bath.\nAfter washing with 10 mL of PBS, seed 1 × 106 DR4 MEFs in 12 mL 10% DMEM medium in a 10-cm cell culture dish.\nCulture at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nAt least 1 h before nucleofection, discard the medium and wash once with 12 mL of PBS.\nSlowly add 20 mL hiPSC medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.",
    "Incubate the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator until the time of nucleofection.\nPrepare nucleofection reagents as well as DNA/gRNA mixture immediately before the nucleofection (Day 0).\nAllow nucleofector® solution V and Supplement provided in the kit (Lonza, Cell Line Nucleofector™ Kit V, Cat# VCA-1003) to warm up to room temperature in the cell culture hood.\nMake nucleofector® solution for both opto-α syn vector and GFP control by mixing 205 μL of nucleofector® solution V with 45 μL of Supplement in Eppendorf tube and gently tap the tube with 3 times.\nPrepare the mixture of plasmid DNA containing 7.5 μg of AAVS1::opto-α-syn donor vector and 2.5 μg of AAVS1 gRNA in Eppendorf tube. As a control, use the mixture of 7.5 μg of GFP vector (from the Cell Line Nucleofector™ Kit V, Lonza) and 2.5 μg of AAVS1 gRNA.\nNote: Add an additional condition for the opto-mock construct (mCherryCry2clust) control by mixing 7.5 μg of AAVS1::opto-mock donor vector with 2.5 μg of AAVS1 gRNA, if Cry2clust control is required in PD ihPSCs. This cell line proves beneficial not only for optimizing the light illumination condition and the dosage of drug treatment in step 5 but also for data analysis in step 6.\nPlace the Nucleofector™ II device near the cell culture hood where nucleofection will take place and set the program on Nucleofector™ II device to B-16.\nNote: Place the Nucleofector™ II device as close as possible to the site of nucleofection to minimize the exposure time of cells to the nucleofection solution (recommended no longer than 15 min) and maximize cell viability and gene transfer efficiency.\nPlace the cuvettes and plastic pipettes in the cell culture hood from Nucleofector® kit V.\nDissociate the hiPSCs for nucleofection (Day 0).",
    "When feeder-free hiPSCs reach 80% confluency, add 1 mL of TrypLE™ enzyme medium to each well of the 6-well plate of SNCA triplication PD hiPSCs and then incubate for 5–10 min at 37°C.\nBy gentle pipetting for 5 times to harvest the cells completely, transfer hiPSC suspension to 10 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 min.\nResuspend the hiPSC pellet with 2 mL of hiPSC medium by gently pipetting and count the number of live cells using a hemocytometer.\nDivide the cells to achieve a concentration of 2 million cells per 1 mL of hiPSC medium by adding the necessary amount. Each 1 mL aliquot, designated for nucleofections of either the opto-α-syn vector or GFP control, should be transferred into individual Eppendorf tubes.\nCentrifuge hiPSC suspensions at 300 × g for 3 min.\nPerform nucleofection.\nNote: Work quickly from this point on. Make sure that everything for nucleofection is ready to go, including Nucleofector™ II device (B-16 program), cuvettes, plastic pipette, and labelled 10 cm dish of DR4 MEFs. It is important to check whether the DR4 MEFs are in a confluent state and healthy. Avoid introducing air bubbles while pipetting.\nAspirate supernatant from each Eppendorf tube carefully.\nResuspend the cell pellet carefully in 100 μL of nucleofector® solution by gentle pipetting 3 times\nCombine 100 μL of cell suspension with 10 μg GFP DNA mixture by gentle pipetting 5 times.\nTransfer cell/DNA suspension into cuvette and apply the B-16 program.\nTake the cuvette out of the device and bring it to the cell culture hood.\nImmediately transfer the cell/DNA suspension into 10 cm culture dish of DR4 MEFs with plastic pipette gently and distribute evenly.",
    "Repeat the procedure with other cell pellets, using 10 μg of AAVS1::opto-α-syn DNA mixture (prepared in step 2c) and plate each nucleofection into a fresh 10 cm dish of DR4 MEFs.\nNote: The sequence of nucleofection steps involving the GFP DNA mixture and the opto-α-syn vector, which are prepared in step 2c, can be interchanged without significant impact on the outcomes.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nStep 2. Single colony selection\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThe opto-α-syn construct transfected in PD hiPSCs contains a puromycin-resistant gene. Therefore, after nucleofection, PD hiPSCs are treated with puromycin to eliminate cells that were not nucleofected or improperly knocked in. This step ensures that only cells with successful integration of the opto-α-syn construct are retained, increasing the purity and reliability of the resulting cell clones.\nFeed cells daily with hiPSC medium after nucleofection.\nAspirate the medium and gently add the 20 mL of hiPSC medium to each 10 cm plate.\nNote: For the first two days after nucleofection, add 10 μM Y-27632 to the hiPSC medium to avoid the cell death caused by nucleofection toxicity.\nStart puromycin selection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nOn day 4, change the fresh 20 mL of hiPSC medium containing 0.5 μg/mL of puromycin.\nNote: Each colony should contain a minimum of 30 cells. If the number of the cells in a colony is less than 30, postpone the puromycin selection until the cell count reaches at least 30 in each hiPSC colony.\nNote: Nucleofection efficiency can be checked by the expression of GFP control via fluorescence microscopy.\nMaintain a puromycin concentration of 0.5 μg/mL with daily fresh hiPSC medium until day 9.\nOn day 10, Change and feed cells daily with puromycin-free hiPSC medium for 2 days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).",
    "Note: Make sure that GFP control colonies are dead by puromycin selection. If colonies are not completely dead, selection can be extended for 1–2 days more.\nOn day 12, colonies can be picked for colony expansion and validation.\nPassage manually the picked hiPSC colonies on MitC-treated feeder MEFs (Gibco, Cat# A34964). For a detailed protocol on handling MitC-treated feeder MEFs, please refer to the manufacturer’s protocol: https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0016997_CF6Neo_Mouse_Embryonic_Fibroblasts_MitCTreated_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0016997_CF6Neo_Mouse_Embryonic_Fibroblasts_MitCTreated_UG.pdf].\nNote: It is important to maintain the feeder MEFs in a healthy state for optimal hiPSC growth. Prior to passaging, ensure that the MEFs are in a confluent state and have been properly prepared according to the established MEF culture protocols.\nUse a stereomicroscope to discern the undifferentiated and healthy colonies, and then determine the number of AAVS1::opto-α-syn hiPSC colonies that you want to passage.\nNote: Concerning the ideal count of colonies for passage, it is customary to select between 10 to 20 well-defined, healthy colonies for each distinct experimental condition.\nNote: Undifferentiated and healthy hiPSC colonies typically have a compact and round shape with well-defined edges (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). However, differentiated hiPSC colonies tend to lose their compact shape and exhibit more irregular or spread-out morphology (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). Please exclude any differentiated colonies.\nAt least a day before passaging hiPSC colonies, plate 0.8 × 105 mitotically inactivated MEFs in 24-well plates with 0.5 mL of 10% DMEM medium.\nNote: Each well of the 24-well plate is intended for a single colony. Therefore, prepare as many wells as the total number of colonies that will be transferred.\nAt least 1 h before passaging hiPSCs, wash with 1 mL of PBS once and add 1 mL of hiPSC medium with 10 μM Y-27632 into mitotically inactivated MEFs in 24-well plates.",
    "Using a stereomicroscope positioned within the culture hood, gently scrap one hiPSC colony along with a small volume (e.g., 100–300 μL) of the hiPSC medium using a pipette tip, and transfer it to 15 mL conical tube.\nCarefully pipette the cell aggregate mixture up and down for 6 times to break up the aggregates.\nUsing a pipette, transfer the colony suspension carefully into each designated well in the 24-well plate.\nNote: Make sure to distribute the suspension evenly among the wells.\nRepeat the passaging procedure described in step d-f with the remaining colonies.\nGently swirl or rock the 24-well plates to distribute the colony.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nFeed cells daily with 1 mL of hiPSC medium for 4–6 days.\nStep 3. Validation and expansion of colonies\nTiming: ∼2 weeks\nTo validate the knockin cell lines, extraction of genomic DNA and PCR amplification are performed using specific primer sets targeting the integrated AAVS1 site as well as the unintegrated AAVS1 site. By analyzing the PCR results, it can be determined which colonies have successfully undergone the knockin process. Also, it allows the distinction between homozygous and heterozygous opto-α-syn knockin cell lines. These validated colonies can then be expanded further for subsequent experiments.\nExtract genomic DNA from each colony and validate the colonies by performing genomic PCR.\nNote: It is important to label each Eppendorf tube with the corresponding label from each well at first. This will ensure proper identification of the knockin cell lines among the hiPSC colonies later. Make sure to label the tubes clearly and consistently to avoid any confusion during further steps of the experiment.\nNote: It is important to prepare the PD hiPSCs as a negative control for PCR analysis.",
    "Alternatives: Genomic DNA PCR is an efficient method for colony validation, especially when working with a small number of hiPSCs. However, the assessment of cell lines can be additionally conducted by performing western blotting with an anti-mCherry antibodies (Cat# 677701 for mouse; Cat# AB356482 for rabbit) due to the presence of an mCherry tag in the opto-α-syn construct. To ensure that the colony have the correct integration, a simple imaging step with the mCherry tag can be employed. This imaging approach verifies that 100% of the cells of the colony show mCherry fluorescence, providing additional assurance. Therefore, in addition to confirming opto-α-syn expression using western blotting in the small number of cell lines that have been screened by extraction of genomic DNA and PCR amplification, it is recommended to perform mCherry imaging. This approach allows for a more direct detection of the mCherry-tagged opto-α-syn and provides a complementary analysis to the PCR results. For a detailed protocol on western blotting to access the protein level of mCherry in knockin cell lines, please refer to Kim et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nWhen the size of colony reaches 0.5–1 mm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), gently scrap two thirds of the hiPSC colony along with 200 μL of the hiPSC medium from each well of 24-well plates using pipette tip.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3021-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

GAPDH serves as a loading control.\nTransfer the scraped colony into Eppendorf tube and centrifuge the tubes at 300 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.",
    "Pause point: If you wish to pause the procedure at this step, you can freeze the cell pellet at −80°C up to 6 months.\nAdd 40 μL of QuickExtract solution to each tube containing the cell pellet.\nIsolate genomic DNA using QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction solution (https://biosearchtech.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/manual_B009_QuickExtract-DNA-Solution[href=https://biosearchtech.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/manual_B009_QuickExtract-DNA-Solution]).\nNote: Store the extracted DNA at –20°C for up to 1 week, or at –70°C for longer periods.\nPrepare the following primers at a concentration of 10 μM in nuclease-free water.\n5′-Flanking region primers:\n      Forward primer: 5′-CTGCCGTCTCTCTCCTGAGT-3′.\n      Reverse primers: 5′-GTGGGCTTGTACTCGGTCAT-3′.\nNon-integrated AAVS1 allele primers:\n      Forward primer: 5′-TTCGGGTCACCTCTCACTCC-3′.\n      Reverse primer: 5′-GGCTCCATCGTAAGCAAACC-3′.\nGAPDH primers:\n      Forward primer: 5′-ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTT-3′.\n      Reverse primer: 5′-CTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTGGG-3′.\nAdd 1 μL primer each, 2 μL DNA extract, and 16 μL nuclease-free water into the PCR tube of AccuPower® PCR premix (Each tube contains DNA polymerase, dNTPs, a tracking dye and reaction buffer in a premixed format, freeze-dried into a pellet).\nGently mix the reaction mixture by flicking the tube up and down, and centrifuge the tube briefly to ensure all solution is collected at the bottom.\nNote: Avoid introducing air bubbles into reaction mixture.\nPerform PCR amplification using a PCR machine according to the following cycling conditions:\nPCR condition with 5′-Flanking region primers.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3021_9.csv\nPCR condition with Non-integrated AAVS1 allele primers.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3021_10.csv\nPCR condition with GAPDH primers.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3021_11.csv\nAfter PCR amplification, analyze the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nNote: Prepare a 1.2% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer and load 10 μL PCR products onto the gel along with a DNA ladder as a size reference.\nVisualize the gel under UV light with using an appropriate imaging device and capture an image. The expected results are as follows:\nFlanking region amplification: A 1,033 bp fragment indicates successful insertion of the opto-α-syn construct into the AAVS1 locus.",
    "Non-integrated AAVS1 allele amplification: An ∼500 bp fragment indicates the presence of the untargeted AAVS1 allele.\nAmplification length of GAPDH is 283 bp.\nSelect both heterozygous as well as homozygous knockin cell lines based on the PCR result (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B; Images from Kim et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nPassage 3–5 colonies of each heterozygous or homozygous knockin cell lines into 6-well plate containing MEF feeder cells for further colony expansion.\nPrior to initiating mDA differentiation, prepare an adequate amount of frozen opto-α-syn knockin hiPSC stock using a 10% DMSO FBS solution. This will serve as a backup and allow for the preservation of the hiPSC lines.\nNote: It is crucial to prevent overgrowth of hiPSCs as it can result in karyotype abnormalities. Regular monitoring of cell density and timely passaging of hiPSCs is essential to maintain their healthy growth and stability.\nStep 4. Neural progenitor expansion and mDA differentiation\nTiming: 3 weeks\nα-Syn aggregation is a characteristic feature observed in dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. In order to create a platform for drug screening in PD, hiPSCs expressing opto-α-syn are differentiated into mDA neurons through a neural progenitor cell stage. The expansion step of neural progenitor cells within the mDA differentiation protocol plays a crucial role in efficient differentiation and isolation of mDA neurons.\nNote: Before initiating the differentiation, prepare the neural expansion medium as well as mDA differentiation medium by adding the prepared cocktail solution into proper medium.\nPrepare a Geltrex-coated 24 well-plate at least 30 min prior to cell plating.\nAdd 500 μL of Geltrex coating solution into each well of a 24 well-plate.\nNote: Return the Geltrex coating solution to the ice immediately after use to prevent premature solidification.\nNote: Avoid introducing the air bubbles.\nAlternatives: Geltrex can be replaced with Matrigel (Corning, Cat #354277).",
    "Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 min to allow the Geltrex to form a coating.\nPrior to plating the cells, remove the liquid from the wells by gentle aspiration.\nDissociate the opto-α-syn hiPSCs using TrypLE™ as previously described. Incubate the dissociated hiPSCs onto the 0.1% gelatin-coated 6-well plate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 15 min to eliminate MEFs. Then transfer cells onto Geltrex-coated 24-well plate at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in mTeSR™1 medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nWhen the cells reach 90%–100% confluency (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), initiate the differentiation into neural progenitor cells (Day 0) until Day 11.

    "Note: each well of the 6-well plate should receive 6 mL of media as specified in step 12d. Using a volume less than 6 mL could potentially lead to decreased cell viability of neural progenitor cells.\nCulture neural progenitor cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nEvery two days, remove the old medium from the wells and replace it with fresh medium until neural progenitor cells reach 100% confluency (P0; Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPassage the neural progenitor cells using TrypLE™ and seed the cells in a 1:2 to 1:4 ratio (75,000 cells/cm2) on a geltrex-coated 6-well plate (6–8 mL/well of medium).\nNote: Prior to initiating mDA differentiation, it is important to prepare an adequate amount of frozen opto-α-syn knockin neural progenitor stocks using a 10% DMSO in neural progenitor medium. It is recommended to stock early passage of progenitor (P0-P3) as P6 progenitors tend to stop expanding.\nPause point: Neural progenitor cells can be cryopreserved indefinitely in a liquid nitrogen tank.\nNote: It is important to maintain at least 6 mL of neural expansion medium in each well of the 6-well plate to ensure cell viability.\nCritical: Neural cells can easily detach in cold medium, so be sure to warm up the media to 37°C before handling the neural progenitor cells.\nResuspend the TrypLE™-mediated dissociated neural progenitor cells in mDA maturation medium at a cell density of the 6 × 105 cells/mL.\nGently add 1 mL of the cell suspension to each well of a geltrex-coated 24-well black flat bottom imaging microplate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3021-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

This helps to minimize light reflection from the clear 24-well plate, resulting in uniform light exposure to the cells.\nEvery two days, remove the old medium and replace it with fresh 1 mL of mDA differentiation medium. Allow the progenitor cells to differentiate for at least 10 days (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: Differentiated neural cells can easily detach in cold medium, so warm up the mDA maturation media to 37°C before handling the differentiated mDA neurons.\nStep 5. Blue light illumination into opto-alpha-syn-mDA neurons with small molecules\nTiming: 1 week",
    "These steps outline the process of generating opto-α-syn aggregates in differentiated mDA neurons through blue light illumination. Illumination device consists of three parts: power supply, illumination plate, and laptop having customized software. The illumination plate is placed in a 37°C/5% CO2 incubator, and the power supply and laptop are located outside the incubator. The maximum output of 470 nm light in a 24-well plate is measured to be 34 μW/mm2 using a LaserCheck device. In our experiments, we optimized the conditions for inducing opto-α-syn aggregates without causing a neuronal cell death. We subjected mDA neurons to blue light illumination at 34 μW/mm2, 470 nm, with a frequency of 0.17 Hz and a light cycle of 0.5 s on followed by 5.5 s off, for a duration of 7 days. These specific parameters served our purposes effectively, but users may need to adjust them based on their experimental setup to optimize the protocol further. During light exposure, small molecules are applied to access their effectiveness in potential PD treatment, as outlined in step 6.\nSet up the device for blue light illumination (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nPlace the illumination plate inside the CO2 incubator and route the cable (white arrowhead; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) out of the incubator through the back hole.\nConnect the power supply-laptop (white arrowheads; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) and power supply-illumination plate cable (white arrow; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nPlug the power supply into an electrical outlet (red arrowhead; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nUse a LaserCheck device to verify the maximum intensity of blue light.\nInitiate light illumination (34 μW/mm2, 470 nm, 0.17 Hz, and 0.5 s on/5.5 s off).\nSet the intensity of blue light to 100% on the power supply (red box; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).",
    "Enter and configure the appropriate COM number for the power source and set the on duration to 0.5 s and the off duration to 5.5 s (a-c; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nCheck the continuous playback (d; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nClick the start illumination button to begin continuous light emission (e in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D and 4E).\nTreat the differentiated mDA neurons expressing opto-α-syn with either vehicle or small molecules in 1 mL of mDA maturation medium.\nNote: Due to the heightened sensitivity of differentiated mDA neurons compared to other cell types, start with a 1/10 lower concentration of small molecules for optimization purposes.\nNote: Add the mDA maturation media gently to prevent cell detachment from the plate.\nNote: To create a dark condition, place aluminum foil at the bottom of each well to shield it from the LED light source. For accurate assessment of the impact of blue light, it is advisable to establish a dark condition within the same 24-well black imaging plates. This setup enables precise quantification of the alterations in aggregated α-syn and TH neuron levels in response to blue light illumination.\nPlace 24-well black plate on the illumination plate inside the CO2 incubator for 3 days (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nNote: It is recommended to check the continuous light illumination randomly to prevent unexpected malfunction of the light illumination device and laptop.\nReplace the medium in each well of the 24-well plate with fresh mDA maturation medium containing the same small molecule, three days after initiating light exposure.\nContinue the light exposure for a total of seven days of illumination.\nStep 6. Immunostaining and data analysis\nTiming: 3 days",
    "In this step, immunostaining is performed on the blue light-illuminated mDA neurons using antibodies against aggregated α-syn6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] (5G4; disease-related aggregates of α-syn, found in the brains of PD patients), pS129-α-syn8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] (pathologic PD-associated phosphorylated forms), and TH (a marker of mDA neurons). Image-based analysis is then conducted to determine whether a specific small molecule can inhibit/degrade α-syn aggregates as well as prevent the cell death of mDA neurons.\nFix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nNote: To prevent the detachment of mDA neurons, fixation steps are divided into 2 steps.\nCarefully remove 700 μL of the culture medium by pipetting.\nAdd 300 μL of PFA carefully to each well.\nNote: Use the pre-warmed PFA to prevent cell detachment.\nNote: Follow appropriate safety guidelines when working with paraformaldehyde.\nSeal the culture plate with Parafilm to prevent PFA toxicity.\nPlace the 24-well plate on the blue light illumination plate inside the 37°C/5% CO2 incubator and incubate for 15 min.\nCarefully aspirate all the medium and add 400 μL of fresh PFA to each well.\nSeal the culture plate with Parafilm and place the 24-well plate on the blue light illumination plate.\nIncubate for an additional 10 min.\nAspirate PFA solution and wash with 1 mL of PBS.\nAdd 400 μL of the staining solution to each well of the 24-well plate and incubate at room temperature for 15 min for cell permeabilization/blocking.\nAdd 400 μL of either 1:500 5G4 (final working concentration: 2 μg/mL) or anti-pS129-α-syn (Final working concentration: 2 μg/mL), combined with 1:500 anti-TH antibody (final working concentration: 0.2 μg/mL) solution in the staining solution, to each well and incubate on the shaker (40 rpm) overnight at 4°C.\nWash each well with 1 mL of PBS at least for 5 min on the shaker (65 rpm), repeating the wash three times.",
    "Add 400 μL of 1:500 Alexa Fluor 488- (Goat anti-mouse) and 647- (Goat anti-rabbit) labeled secondary antibody solution in the staining solution to each well and incubate for 1 h 30 min at room temperature.\nWash each well with 1 mL of PBS for 5 min.\nAdd 400 μL of 2 μg/mL DAPI in PBS into each well and incubate for 5 min.\nWash each well with 1 mL of PBS at least for 5 min, repeating the wash three times.\nAdd 300 μL of Fluoromount™ Aqueous Mounting Medium into each well.\nAcquire 8–10 images from each well of the 24-well plate using a fluorescence microscope.\nNote: Use a lower magnification (10×) to capture images of TH + mDA neurons and a higher magnification (40×) for 5G4+ or pS129+ aggregates due to the small size of the aggregates. Each florescent image needs an image of DAPI+ nuclei for quantification.\nAnalyze the acquired images from vehicle- or small molecule-treated samples using ImageJ software.\nNote: Ensure the same threshold range is applied across all images in the same set of experiments. This includes the dark control and compound treated samples. This is important for maintaining consistency in your measurements.\nFor Analyzing 5G4+ or pS129+ Aggregates in Images Using ImageJ:\nConvert RGB to 8-bit: The first step is to convert your RGB images into 8-bit grayscale images (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). From the 'Image' menu, select 'Type', then '8-bit'.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3021-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative images of the measurement of 5G4+ aggregates in opto-α-syn-expressing PD iPSC-mDA neurons",
    "(A–F) Cells were either kept in the dark or exposed to blue light (34 μW/mm2 at 470 nm, 0.17 Hz, 0.5 s) for 7 days, followed by immunostaining with the 5G4 antibody. After staining, the images were captured and subsequently analyzed using ImageJ software. The images were converted to 8-bit grayscale (A), inverted (B), background-subtracted (C), and the particles were analyzed based on their size and circularity (D and E). Finally, the number of aggregates was measured (F).\nInvert the Image: To get a clearer view of the 5G4+ aggregate dots, the image will need to be inverted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Go to the 'Edit' > 'Invert' to reverse the color scheme.\nSubtract Background: To minimize the effect of any background noise, the image’s background will need to be subtracted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Go to 'Process' menu, and select 'Subtract Background'. Set the 'rolling ball' radius to 50 pixels and make sure the 'light background' option is selected.\nNote: Depending on the background in your images, you may need to adjust the ‘rolling ball’ radius during the 'Subtract Backround' step. Start with 50 pixels and refine based on the results you observe.\nSet Threshold: To accurately count the number of aggregate dots, you need to set an appropriate threshold (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). Navigate to the 'Image' menu, choose 'Adjust', then 'Threshold'.",
    "Analyze Particles: After thresholding, you can count and measure the size of the particles (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). Go to the 'Analyze' menu, and select 'Analyze Particles'. Set the size range as 3–100 pixels and the circularity as 0.70–1.00. In the 'Show' field, choose 'Outlines'. This will display outlines around each particle recognized by ImageJ. Make sure the 'Display results', 'Clear results' and 'Include holes' options are also checked. This command will analyze particles, displaying a results table that includes the number and size of the aggregates (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nNote: Depending on the size and shape of the aggregates in your images, you may need to adjust the size and circularity settings during the 'Analyze Particles' step. Start with a broad range and refine based on the results you observe.\nFor Analyzing TH + neurons in Images Using ImageJ:\nSubtract Background & Set Threshold: Follow the same steps for background subtraction and thresholding as detailed in the 5G4+ aggregates protocol. Adjust the settings as needed to best suit the TH+ neuron images.\nWatershed: To separate larger, contiguous areas of TH+ neurons into distinct particles for accurate measurement, ensure that your image is in binary format. If needed, use 'Make Binary' from the 'Process' menu. Then, navigate to the 'Process' menu, select 'Binary', and then choose 'Watershed'.\nAnalyze Particles: To count and measure the size of the particles, navigate to the 'Analyze' menu, and select 'Analyze Particles'. Set the size range as 10-Infinity pixels. This will measure all particles larger than 10 pixels. Ensure the 'Display results', 'Clear results', and 'Include holes' options are checked.\nTo analyze DAPI+ cells, follow the same steps as those used for analyzing TH+ neurons using ImageJ.\nTo further analyze 5G4+ or pS129+ aggregates and the number of DAPI+ cells within TH+ neurons specifically:",
    "Subtract Background & Set Threshold: Refer to the same steps used in the TH+ neurons protocol for background subtraction and thresholding.\nNote: Do not press the \"Apply\" button at this stage.\nCreate Selection of TH+ Neurons: Navigate to ‘Edit’, ‘Selection’, ‘Create Mask’ to highlight the TH+ neurons. Then, select ‘Edit’, ‘Selection’, ‘Create Selection’. This series of actions isolates the TH+ neurons within the image.\nApply TH+ Neuron Mask to 5G4+, pS129+, or DAPI+ Images: Open the desired images containing the specific aggregates or cells. Go to ‘Edit’, ‘Selection’, ‘Restore Selection’ to retrieve the previously created selection of TH+ neurons, and select ‘Edit’, ‘Clear Outside’ to delete the outside region of TH+ neurons. This step isolates the areas of interest corresponding to the TH+ neurons.\nThen analyze the aggregates or the DAPI+ cells as previously described in .c.\nNormalize the value of 5G4+ or pS129+ aggregates or the area of TH+ neurons with the number of DAPI+ cells.\nObtain the relative values to the control sample, normalize each value with the average of blue light illuminated images for 5G4 and pS129-α-syn, and dark images for TH, respectively. This means that the number of 5G4+ or pS129+ aggregates induced by the blue light condition is set as 1.0, and the value of TH+ neurons in dark images will be 1.0."
