    "Warning: RNA is easily degradable by RNases and not very stable on ice! Therefore, clean all surfaces with 70% ethanol or RNase away, change gloves often and sterilize all materials used. Lysed samples should not be kept on ice for more than one hour as mRNA will degrade.Notes:  This protocol can be used for all larval stages, dauers and embryos of nematodes.A new sterile needle should be used for each worm. Isolating and lysing nematodes from cultured platesNote: Prepare the buffers freshly on the day of worm collection. Prepare lysis buffer (see Recipes in the end of the protocol) with Proteinase K by combining 46.8 µl of lysis buffer stock with 3.2 µl of Proteinase K for a total of 50 µl.From Step A1 combine 18 µl of lysis buffer with Proteinase K with 2 µl RNase inhibitor for a total of 20 µl of lysis buffer. Use the lysis buffer with Proteinase K and RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor for lysing worms.Set up a station for nematode collection (Figure 1A).Wash nematodes three times with deionized water:To wash nematodes from cultured plates, add 1 ml of water to plate. Swirl the plate three times to dislodge nematodes.Transfer worms with a pipette to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Briefly spin down.Remove supernatant and bring up to 1 ml with water.Repeat Steps A5d and A5e two more times or until the water becomes clear.Collect one worm using a pipette in 2 µl of water and transfer to the wall of PCR tube (Figure 1B). Cut the worm with 25 gauge needle (Figures 1C-1D) (Video 1). Note: Cutting is suggested for all larval stages. Note that we did not cut the embryos.    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1.",

    "A nematode is cut and lysed to release total RNA. 2. The Oligo(dT) binds the poly(A) tail at the 3’ end of mRNA (section A of Procedure). 3. The 1st strand of cDNA is synthesized by MMLV reverse transcriptase (RT) which adds non-template guided cytosines at the 3’ end of the cDNA. These cytosines are used to anchor the LNA-modified TSO. Reverse transcriptase then uses the TSO as a template to complete the 1st strand (section B of Procedure). 4. The ISPCR primer anneals to the 3’ end of the 1st strand allowing DNA polymerase to bind and to synthesize the 2nd strand of cDNA and subsequently amplify the cDNA (section C of Procedure). 5. The double-stranded (ds) cDNA is purified and checked for quality (sections D and E of Procedure). 6. Transposomes tagment the ds cDNA by fragmenting it and ligating adapter sequences (section F of Procedure). 7. The tagmented ds cDNA is cleaned and 8. Ligated to sample specific indexes (section G of Procedure). cDNA bead clean-up Take samples out of -20 °C and let them sit at room temperature for 10 min. Take Ampure XP beads from fridge and vortex at high speed for 1 min. The solution should be homogenous. Aliquot 26 μl of Ampure XP beads into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Beads need to be warmed up to room temperature approximately 8 min. Add the sample (~26 μl) to the Ampure XP beads (1:1). Pipette up and down 10 times until thoroughly mixed.Incubate the sample with the Ampure XP beads for 8 min at room temperature on a tube rack. Make 600 μl of fresh 80% nuclease-free ethanol. After incubation, place sample on a magnetic bead stand for 5 min. Note: The beads will be bound to cDNA of interest.",
    "Remove supernatant using pipette without disturbing the beads. Note: Place the supernatant into the old sample PCR tube and keep it until the cDNA concentration is checked.Leave tubes on magnetic bead stand, add 200 μl of 80% ethanol to the beads. Wait 30 sec. Remove supernatant using a needle attached to a vacuum line or a pipette, being careful not to disturb the beads. Note: Do not let beads dry out.Repeat Steps D9-D10 two more times. Let beads dry on the magnetic stand for ~5 min with the cap open. Monitor the drying. When the beads begin to crack, remove the tube from the magnet and immediately add 17.5 μl of EB buffer to the beads. Pipette up and down 10 times to thoroughly mix. The solution should be homogenous and brown.Incubate the sample on a tube rack at room temperature for 2 min. Put the sample back on the magnetic bead stand for 2 min or until the liquid turns clear. Collect 15 μl of supernatant from the tube while on the magnetic stand. Be careful not to disturb beads. Place the supernatant into a clean labeled Eppendorf tube and place on ice. Note: There should be no brown specs in the liquid collected. If you aspirate any beads, return the sample to the bead tube and repeat Steps D14-D15.Discard tubes left in the magnetic stand.Measurement of cDNA concentration and sample quality checkNote: Calibrate the Qubit Fluorometer according to manufacturer’s guide. Qubit reagents for one sample:198 μl of dsDNA HS Buffer 1 μl of dsDNA HS reagent 200x1 μl of cDNA Add the dsDNA HS reagent, dsDNA HS buffer and cDNA to a Qubit tube. Quickly vortex and spin down in a mini-centrifuge.Incubate the tube for 2 min in the dark.Place cDNA sample into the Qubit fluorometer.",
    "On the Qubit screen, select ‘DNA’, select ‘High Sensitivity’, and select ‘read sample’. Select ‘read stock concentration’ and change the volume to ‘1 μl’. Record the cDNA concentration (ng/μl).Run BioAnalyzer (BA) on the cDNA following the protocol for the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit. Samples should be run on a BioAnalyzer machine using an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit to generate profiles of the distribution of cDNA lengths (representative of the mRNA transcript lengths) in each sample. If the sample is not degraded, you will see a clear peak in the fragment sizes in the 500-10,000 bp range with no peaks at smaller fragment sizes indicative of full length cDNA resulting from full length mRNA transcripts (Figure 3A). The profile will show no peaks or many small peaks if the mRNA transcripts were degraded (likely due to RNase contamination or mishandling of the RNA) (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210173356_7697.jpgFigure 3. Examples of Smart-seq2 BioAnalyzer (BA) profiles. A. An ideal BA profile of cDNA showing full length transcripts with large peaks around 1,000 bp and no PCR primer contamination (70 bp). B. A BA profile of cDNA made from highly degraded RNA resulting in an abundance of small fragments shown by multiple peaks between 35 and 300 bp.Tagmentation of cDNA (Figure 2)Notes: All reagents and samples should be kept on ice. This protocol uses the standard Nextera DNA library prep kit rather than Nextera XT DNA sample prep kit. Buffer PM is used because it has acetic acid and consequentially addresses the pH value of samples. Set a heating block to 55 °C and warm 30 μl of EB buffer. Calculate how to get 20 ng of cDNA from sample in 8 μl (see example below).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210173822_8331.jpgIn a PCR tube place 20 ng of Ampure-purified PCR product. Add EB to bring volume to 8 μl.",
    "In a NEW PCR tube, add 10 μl of Tagment DNA buffer from Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit.Add 2.2 μl Tagment DNA enzyme 1 from Nextera DNA Library prep Kit.Set a new P20 pipette to 15 μl and mix the transposase enzyme and transposase buffer by pipetting up and down 10 times. Transfer all of the mixed transposase enzyme and buffer into your cDNA and IMMEDIATELY pipette up and down at least 10 times to mix very well. Place sample on the PCR block for 5 min at 55 °C to initiate the tagmentation reaction. While sample is on PCR block, obtain a QIAquick DNA cleanup column, buffer PM and PE. The tagmented cDNA will be passed through this column to remove the enzyme from the DNA fragments. Add 60 μl of buffer PM to the 20 μl of tagmented cDNA. Mix well by pipetting up and down until the solution becomes clear. Pipette the entire volume into the QIAGEN spin column.Spin the QIAGEN column down in a centrifuge at 12,470 x g for 1 min. The cDNA will stick to the white filter in the column, and the liquid will pass through into the collection tube. Dump the flow-through into the trash. Place the column back inside the collection tube.Add 750 μl of buffer PE to the column. Spin the QIAGEN column down in a centrifuge at 12,470 x g for 1 min. Dump the flow-through into the trash. Place the column back inside the collection tube. Spin the QIAGEN column down in a centrifuge at 12,470 x g for 1 min. Place the column into a new, clean the Eppendorf tube that is labelled with the sample name.",
    "Add 30 μl of warmed EB buffer to the center of the white filter inside the column, being careful to not touch the filter with the pipette tip or to pipette the buffer onto the walls of the column.Let the column sit for 1 min.Spin down the column in a centrifuge at 12,470 x g for 1 min. Remove the column and keep the flow-through. The flow-through is the tagmented cDNA.Note: At this step samples can be handed to the facility at which they will be sequenced. If barcodes are to be added by researcher, follow the next steps. Amplification of adapter-ligated fragments (Figure 2)In a PCR tube add the following reagents: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210174005_5744.jpgPut samples on PCR cycler and run the following program (Buenrostro et al., 2015):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210174050_0188.jpgNote: After the stopping point, samples can be stored at -20 °C indefinitely.DNA library bead clean-up Follow steps described in Procedure D with the following changes:Step D3, use 70 μl of Ampure XP beads (1:1).Step D4, add the sample (~70 μl).Step D14, add 30 μl of EB.Step D16, collect 27.5 μl of supernatant.Measurement of DNA library concentration and sample quality checkFollow steps in Procedure E to acquire DNA library concentration with Qubit. Run BioAnalyzer to check quality of library. (Optional, but highly recommended!)Samples should be run on a BioAnalyzer to check for quality of tagmentation from Procedure F. A fully tagmented library will have a BioAnalyzer profile with a clear peak around 200 bp (Figure 4A). A partially tagmented library will have a BioAnalyzer profile with a uniform plateau between 150 to 1,000 bp and possibly some smaller peaks below 150 bp or above 1,000 bp (Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210174443_1611.jpgFigure 4. Examples of Smart-seq2 BioAnalyzer profiles after tagmentation and library preparation. A.",
    "An example of a sample that has been fully tagmented shows one peak around 200 bp. B. An example of a sample that was not fully tagmented shows a broad distribution of fragments ranging from 150-1,000 bp.Library sequencingThe libraries can be handed to a sequencing facility. Samples are sequenced using pair-end, 43 base pair reads. Pair-end sequencing improves the quality of the dataset enabling reads to more accurately align to the reference genome. Libraries can also be sequenced with single-end reads. Each sample should be sequenced to a depth of at least 10 million reads to reliably detect one transcript per million (TPM)."
