    "1. Preparative BN-PAGE\nGel preparation\n\t\nUse a middle-to-large format vertical gel electrophoresis system (>10 cm gel separation distance; 14 cm x 11 cm, 1.5 mm spacer) with effective cooling set to 10 °C.\nCast linear or hyperbolic pore gradient gel (1.5-3.0 mm spacers) using a stirring two-chamber gradient mixer driven by a pump (see Table of Materials and Reagents). In the presented example (linear gradient gel 1%-13%):\n\t\t\nPrepare a 13 mL solution for the front (mixing) chamber consisting of: 13% acrylamide (from 30% stock solution, 37.5:1.0 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 0.75 M aminocaproic acid, 50 mM Bis-Tris (pH = 7.0), and 10% glycerol.\nPrepare a 10 mL solution for the reservoir chamber consisting of: 1% acrylamide (from 30% stock solution, 37.5:1.0 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 0.75 M aminocaproic acid, 50 mM Bis-Tris (pH = 7.0), and 0.2% CL-47 detergent.\nStart the stirrer and add 30 microliters of APS (ammonium peroxodisulfate, 10% stock solution) and 2.5 μL of TEMED (N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl ethylenediamine) and 2.5 microliters of TEMED to the solution in the front chamber. Start the pump and open the front valve (flow should be adjusted to complete casting in 10 min). After 1 min add 90 μL of APS and 5 μL of TEMED to the solution in the reservoir chamber and open the chamber connection.\nAllow the gel to polymerize slowly but thoroughly for at least 24 h at room temperature (RT) to generate a homogenous pore size gradient. When kept moist, the polymerized gel can be stored upright at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\n\t\tNOTE: Intentionally, the top of the gel will have a soft/slimy consistency. This will later be removed but allows for smooth entry of proteins into the gel, with minimal risk of protein precipitation that may otherwise lead to migration artifacts (i.e., streaking or protein precipitation).\nSample preparation and loading",
    "Prepare loading slots by inserting appropriate spacers (e.g., silicon tubes) between the glass plates for separating 0.5-2.0 mg of protein. The slots should be made at least 3 cm wide (or better, 5-6 cm wide).\nSolubilize ~2.5 mg of membrane (mouse kidney endosome-enriched preparation) in 2 mL of solubilization buffer containing 1% (w/v) non-denaturing detergent (ComplexioLyte CL-47) for 30 min on ice. Ultracentrifugate (sedimentation cut-off = 200 S or less; 130,000 x g/11 min is used here).\nConcentrate the solubilisate on a short 50%/20% (w/v, 0.3 ml each) sucrose step gradient by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 400,000 x g. The final protein yield should be at least 1 mg.\nAdd 0.05% (w/v) Coomassie G-250 to the solubilisate and load the sample on the gel. Limit the protein load to a 10-15 µg/mm2 gel lane cross-section to obtain high resolution and avoid artifacts resulting from protein precipitation.\nBN-PAGE running conditions\n\t\nFor running buffers, prepare a standard cathode buffer consisting of 50 mM tricine, 15 mM Bis-Tris, and 0.01% Coomassie G-250. Prepare a standard anode buffer consisting of 50 mM Bis-Tris (pH = 7.0).\nRun a preparative BN-PAGE at 10 °C overnight using a three-step voltage protocol13 consisting of: an equilibration phase for 30 min at 100 V, then a slow (3 h) ramp to maximum voltage (40-50 V/cm gel length) that is finally maintained for at least 6 h for endpoint focusing of proteins.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to pause electrophoresis when the migration front has reached the middle of the gel and exchange the cathode buffer for fresh buffer without Coomassie G250. This helps to avoid precipitation artifacts in the gel resulting from local collapse of the matrix pore structure.\n2. Gel sampling and digestion\nExcision of gel lanes",
    "After the run, scan the gels for documentation purposes while keeping it between the glass plates.\nDisassemble the plates and excise the lane section(s) of interest.\nTake a sample strip of the lane for analysis by 2D BN/SDS-PAGE and protein staining or western blotting (as shown in Figure 1B) to determine regions of interest, effective complex size resolution, and protein abundance.\nFix selected gel lanes twice for at least 30 min with 30% (v/v) ethanol and 15% (v/v) acetic acid.\nTransfer the sample to embedding medium and allow it to soak and equilibrate for at least 2 h at 4 °C, while keeping the gel slab in slow motion on an orbital shaker.\n\t\tNOTE: The gel separation should be carefully inspected for overall separation quality and migration artifacts. Gel bands representing dominant proteins should be distortion-free and homogeneous in intensity. Local artifacts on the gel should be excised or left out of analysis.\nEmbedding and cryomicrotome slicing\n\tNOTE: This is an improved version of the embedding procedure described and photo-documented previously that allows for embedding and slicing of broader gel lanes of up to 8 cm11.\n\t\nFirst, cut fixed gel lanes into sections (here, 3 cm) exactly parallel to the protein migration front/band pattern. For easier handling, place each section on a plastic film support with equal dimensions.\nTransfer the lanes into an open tube with stoppers (closed on the bottom, centrally perforated on the top, both precisely aligned with the upper and lower ends of gel section).\nDip the cylinder briefly into liquid nitrogen to rapidly initiate the solidification. The transparent embedding medium solidifies within seconds and becomes white in color.\nFill the cavity with embedding medium, briefly dip it into liquid nitrogen, and freeze the cylinder at -20 °C for several hours.",
    "NOTE: Cooling the cylinder rapidly by dipping it into liquid nitrogen helps to avoid displacement of the gel slab within the tube. Distortion should be avoided to ensure high resolution in the following MS analysis.\nAfter disassembly, remove the plastic film and transfer the block with the embedded gel section to a cooled, larger in diameter, metal cylinder placed on a flat support (i.e., Petri dish) and sealed with embedding medium on the outside of the cylinder. Fill the cylinder with embedding medium and freeze thoroughly.\nRepeat this procedure with the other side of the cylinder to obtain a solid block with coplanar surfaces.\nRemove the block from the cylinder, glue it with embedding medium on a precooled metal holder, and insert the holder into the cryoslicing machine (cryotome). The surface of the block has to be carefully aligned with respect to the slicing plane. Allow it to equilibrate at the optimum temperature for the slicing process (here, -15 °C).\n\t\tNOTE: Use a slowly progressing manual slicing cycle of 0.1 mm step size until hitting the surface of the embedded gel section to ensure correct positioning.\nHarvest the gel slices one after another, with a final desired thickness of 0.25 mm step size, and transfer them individually to reaction tubes with low protein binding properties.\n\t\tNOTE: In this set-up, uniform gel slices can be readily obtained as thin as 0.1 mm and as thick as 0.5 mm.\nTryptic digestion\n\t\nPerform in-gel tryptic digestion after extensive washing of the gel slices (at least three additional rounds of washing are recommended to remove polymeric components of the embedding medium) following a standard procedure11.\nVacuum-dry eluted peptides and redissolve in 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid by shaking at 37 °C (10 min) followed by bath sonication (5 min) and brief centrifugation.\n3. Mass spectrometry",
    "nanoHPLC and MS set-up\n\t\nLoad digested samples onto a C18 precolumn (particle size = 5 µm; diameter = 300 µm) with 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid using a (split-free) nano-HPLC coupled to a mass spectrometer with high resolution.\nElute captured peptides with an aqueous-organic gradient (eluent A): 5 min 3% B, 120 min from 3% B to 30% B, 20 min from 30% B to 99% B, 5 min 99% B, 5 min from 99% B to 3% B, 15 min 3% B (flow rate = 300 nL/min).\n\t\tNOTE: csBN-MS gel slices typically result in samples with low to intermediate peptide abundance and a limited degree of complexity. nanoLC-MS/MS analysis should therefore be performed with a set-up providing reasonable sensitivity and sequencing speed, high mass resolution (>100,000) and maximum dynamic range (effectively 3-4 orders of magnitude). However, it does not require long column dimensions or elution gradients extended beyond 3 h.\nSeparate eluted peptides in an emitter (i.d. 75 µm; tip = 8 µm) manually packed approximately 20 cm with C18 material (particle size = 3 µm). Electrospray the samples at 2.3 kV (positive ion mode) into the heated transfer capillary (250 °C) of the mass spectrometer.\nPerform analyses with the following instrument settings11: maximum MS/MS injection time = 400 ms; exclusion duration = 60 s; minimum signal threshold = 5,000 counts, top 10 precursors fragmented; isolation width = 1.0 m/z).\n\t\tNOTE: To facilitate calibration of mass, retention time, and assignment of peptide signals in a large number of datasets or measurements, it is recommended to perform respective MS measurement series without interruptions or changes in parameters and hardware (i.e., on the same C18 column/emitter).\nProtein identification (MS data evaluated as described previously11)\n\t\nExtract peak lists from fragment ion spectra using the \"msconvert.exe\" tool (part of ProteoWizard).",
    "Shift all precursor m/z values for each dataset by the median m/z offset of all peptides assigned to proteins in a preliminary database search with 50 ppm peptide mass tolerance.\nSearch the corrected peak lists with a suitable search engine (here, Mascot 2.6.2) against all mouse entries of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (release 2018_11).\nSelect \"Acetyl (Protein N-term)\", \"Carbamidomethyl (C)\", \"Gln | pyro-Glu (N-term Q), Glu | pyro-Glu (N-term E)\", \"Oxidation (M)\", and \"Propionamide (C)\" as variable modifications.\nSet peptide and fragment mass tolerance to ± 5 ppm and ± 0.8 Da, respectively, and allow one missed tryptic cleavage. Set the expect value cut-off for peptide identification to 0.5 or less. Use a decoy database search to determine the false positive discovery rate (FDR). Set the FDR to 1% or apply additional quality criteria to ensure reliable identification.\n\t\tNOTE: The presented experiment identified more than 3,500 proteins, with an average peptide FDR of 4.4 ± 0.77% (n = 101 slice samples), or 3,000 proteins when peptide FDR was set to 1%. Importantly, more stringent criteria were used for the selection of profiled proteins (2,568). It included all proteins that were identified with at least two peptides, at least one of them being protein-specific, in at least one of the 101 slice samples.\nProtein quantification\n\t\nUse peptide signal intensities (peak volumes [PVs]) for protein quantification that are obtained from FT full scans and correct for retention time and mass shifts using appropriate software (here, MaxQuant v1.6.3).\nAlign MS datasets one-by-one to reference (total average) peptide elution times using LOESS regression. Assign PVs to peptides either directly (MS/MS-based identification) or indirectly (i.e., based on their matching m/z and elution time within very narrow tolerances).",
    "NOTE: This protocol uses in-house software for assignment of the \"inserted\" termed peptides. Set parameters result in effective m/z and elution time matching tolerances of ± 2 ppm and ± 1 min, respectively (see Figure 2A,B).\nCorrect for systematic run-to-run variations in peptide load and ionization efficiency by peptide intensity rescaling calculated from the median differences of relative peptide intensities between neighboring slice samples (Figure 2C).\nFilter PV data for outliers and remaining false-positive assignments identified by internal PV consistency analysis.\nNormalize PVs of each peptide to their maximum values over all slice datasets yielding relative peptide abundance profiles.\nFinally, calculate relative protein abundance profiles as averages of at least two (and up to six or 50%, whichever value is greater) of the best correlating peptide profiles over a window of three consecutive slices. This allows bridging of missing PV values and reducing noise.\n\t\tNOTE: This finally resulted in 2,545 (of 2,568 preselected) protein profiles (Figure 2D).\nCharacterization of protein complexes\n\t\nAnalyze protein profiles by first performing peak detection using the local maxima method, and consecutively fit normal distributions to these peaks, yielding the position (i.e., slice index or apparent complex size) of their maxima and FWHM (full width at half-maximal intensity) values (inset of Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: In the dataset, profiles are analyzed automatically using custom scripts. The smallest FWHM values are indicative of the effective size resolution of the approach (here, 6 x 0.25 = 1.5 mm).\nUse reference protein complex peaks with defined molecular mass (as reported in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database) for linear regression analysis of the log10(predicted molecular mass) values to convert slice number indices to apparent molecular sizes (i.e., apparent complex size in kDa).",
    "NOTE: 23 marker complexes in the sample were selected in this study (Figure 4) based on (i) monodisperse shapes of profile peaks, (ii) experimental support of molecular weights, and (iii) distributions along the investigated BN-PAGE gel sections."
