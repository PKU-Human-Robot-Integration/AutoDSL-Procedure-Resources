    "Mice are allowed ad libitum access to food, water, and maintained on a 12-hr light-dark cycle. All procedures involving laboratory animals conformed to National and European laws and were approved by the French Ministry for Education and Scientific Research (CEEA-LR-00651-01). A total of 6 transgenic 5xFAD and 4 littermate wildtype (WT) control mice were used for this procedure.\n1. Pre-operative Preparation\nIntraperitoneally (IP) inject Methoxy-X04 (10 mg/kg) 48 hr before surgery to label Aβ deposits11.\nPrepare sterile artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (120 mM NaCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose; bubble with 95% O2/ 5% CO2 before adding 2.5 mM CaCl2).\nSterilize surgical tools (scissors, forceps, razor blade and drill bit), using an autoclave or a hot bead sterilizer before aseptic surgery.\nClean the surgical bench and microscope plate with 70% ethanol and cover with a clean absorbent cloth.\nInject ketamine/xylazine (75 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and the analgesic ketoprofen (2.5 mg/kg) IP.\nCheck the appropriate level of anesthesia with paw or tail pinches.\nApply sterile ophthalmic ointment to the eyes and shave the fur (nose to ears) while avoiding the whiskers. A depilatory cream can be used as long as it is followed by carefully rinsing with water to prevent skin irritation. Shave the remaining fur with a razor blade. Sterilize the skin with povidone-iodine antiseptic solution.\nPlace the mouse under the binocular microscope and make a skin incision from the ears to the nose. Pull the skin sideways to expose the skull. Incise the periosteum and repeatedly rinse the skull with sterile aCSF to stop possible bleeding.\n2. Vasculature Labeling and Thinned Skull Window Preparation (40 min)",
    "Remove the eye ointment with a cotton tip. Apply a drop of topical ophthalmic anesthetic (tetracaine 1%) and gently pressure the skin around the eye socket to achieve protrusion.\nInject Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with Dextran (70 kDa) (100 mg/kg or 50 µl of a 50 mg/ml solution; hypodermic insulin needle) in the retro-orbital sinus following the procedure described by Yardeni and colleagues 12. Apply sterile ophthalmic ointment to eyes.\nEnsure that the skin is retracted and the skull is clean and dry around the selected imaging area. Apply a small amount of cyanoacrylic glue around the window of the head mount device (consisting of stacked razor-blades, see Figure 1), and glue around the target region applying gentle pressure for several seconds 10.\nPull the ends of the skin to the edge of the window of the head mount device, making sure the area is dry. Secure the skin and the edge of the window with a small amount of veterinary grade cyanoacrylic glue and wait until dry (Figure 1).\nSecure the animal at the stage using the head-mount device. Rinse with sterile aCSF and ensure that the well between the skin and head-mount device is perfectly sealed. Wrap the mouse in a survival blanket to maintain normothermia.\nPerform thinning of the skull in aCSF solution as previously described10. Note that the scalp is not completely removed. Regularly change the aCSF to clear bone debris and to avoid tissue overheating. Any remaining bone debris can be removed with brief air puffs. The aCSF solution also attenuates vibrations created by drilling.\n\tNOTE: The mouse skull thickness varies between 80 to 150 µm depending on the age of the animal and the region of interest.",
    "Using a dental drill (at medium speed and a 0.7 mm burr) start thinning the skull surface in an area 1.0 mm in diameter using a regular vertical motion parallel to the skull and remove most of the spongy bone (first 40 - 70 µm). remember to replace aCSF every 20-30 sec and limit uninterrupted drilling to  3-4 sec. Note that bone near sutures is highly vascularized. Apply aCSF presoaked gelfoam to stop eventual bleeding.\nUse a sharp disposable ophthalmic microsurgical blade to continue with the thinning of the skull, being careful not to apply excessive pressure. The final region is of about 0.5 mm in diameter and with a thickness of 20 - 35 µm.\n\tNOTE: Due to bone regrowth and scarring, it is necessary to further thin the window at each imaging session.\n3. Two-photon Microscopy (45 min)\nIf necessary, inject with 19 mg/kg ketamine to maintain adequate anesthesia. \nTransfer the mouse (fixed to the headmount stage) under the two-photon laser microscope. Using a 20X water immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.0, locate the thinned cranial window at the center of the optical field using the epi-fluorescent lamp. Ensure that the objective is always immersed in aCSF.\nStart laser scanning with a mode locked pulsed laser (Ti-Sapphire 680-1040nm). Set excitation wavelength at 750 nm to detect the emitted fluorescence of the methoxy-XO4 and FITC-dextran in the blue and green channels respectively.\n\tNOTE: The microscope has two beam splitters at 506 nm and 555 nm. Blue light is captured by an NDD detector equipped with a 470 ± 12 nm filter. Green light is captured by a high sensitivity GaAsP detector equipped with a 525 ± 25 nm filter. The maximal laser power emitted from the objective should not exceed 10 mW to avoid laser-induced tissue damage.",
    "Acquire a low magnification stack (500 µm x 500 µm, 512 x 512 pixels; 2 µm step) at a 0.7X numerical zoom to create a 3D map for the precise relocalization of the ROI at later time points.\nAcquire a mosaic of 4 high digital magnification images with a 2X numerical zoom (200 µm x 200 µm, 512 x 512 pixels; 1 µm step). Using the imaging software move the window in 200 µm steps to capture all regions. Depth of stacks is typically 250 µm, starting from the pial surface in each image of the mosaic.\nBefore removing the mouse from the microscope, take a picture or make a hand-drawn 2D map of the pial vasculature for future relocalization of the imaging field.\n4. Recovery and Re-imaging\nRemove the head-mount device by applying traction while holding the skull underneath. If any glue remains attached to the skull or skin, scrape it off carefully with fine forceps. Suture the scalp and place the mouse in a heated cage to monitor recovery from anesthesia before returning it to the home cage. Apply topical antibiotic cream to the suture and inject ketoprofen (2.5 mg/kg) IP the following 2 days.\nRepeat steps 1.1 to 2.5 for repeated imaging sessions. If necessary, shave the bone with a microsurgical blade to ensure optimal quality of the image.\n\tNOTE: Additional thinning with the dental drill may be necessary when the interval between imaging sessions is longer than one month.\nPosition the mouse underneath the microscope using epifluorescent light according to the 2D map of the pial vasculature taken from the previous session (step 3.6).\nStart two-photon laser scanning and adjust microscope stage to achieve alignment at the micrometer scale using the 3D map obtained in step 3.4. Proceed to detailed imaging as described in step 3.5.",
    "5. Post-acquisition Three-dimensional Reconstruction and Image Analysis\nObtain three-dimensional reconstructions of the vasculature and the amyloid depositions using the 3D image analysis software such as IMARIS (version used 8.0 and 7.7.2).\nUse the Normalize Layer plugin on the image processing menu and contrast change submenu to obtain ideal contrast of the two channels in the entire depth of the image stack.\nOpen the images from the same region at all time points simultaneously and always process them in parallel in order to compare the different time points.\nTrace vessels using the filament tracer module.\n\t\nClick on the filament icon to create a new filament, skip the automatic tracer and choose the auto-path method.\nBe sure the selected channel corresponds to the vascular image and using the select function of the pointer, click at a vessel bifurcation that is conserved across the imaging sessions while holding the shift + control keys to determine a starting point. Use the select function of the pointer and click while holding the shift key to select the end points of the filaments.\n\t\tNOTE: Comparison of the obtained skeletons will show structural changes of the vasculature.\nPerform plane by plane analysis to track new plaques. Apply surface module to the blue channel for tracking the growth of Aβ plaques. Click on the surface icon to create a new surface and proceed with the automated surface creation. Use the thresholding method to set and subtract the background signal. The statistics menu provides data relative to the surface of individual amyloid deposits.\nSubscription Required.
