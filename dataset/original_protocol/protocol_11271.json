    "1. Generation of Cell Spheroids\nDay 1\nPrepare the standard culture medium as required by the cell line under investigation.\nCarry out all tissue culture-associated steps in a tissue culture hood using sterile handling techniques.\nTrypsinize and count cancer cells. Use 20 mL of cell suspension per plate. Keep the cell suspensions in clearly labeled sterile universal tubes.\nAdd a predetermined number of cells to each well. Both the initial number of cells and ultimate spheroid size required depends upon the proliferation rate of the cell line being investigated.\nNOTE: For established glioma cell lines such as U251 and KNS429,10, 5 x 103 cells/mL will produce a microscopically visible spheroid (200 or 800 µm) after 4 days of incubation.\nResuspend the cells in universal tubes by gentle inversion to avoid cell clumping. Pipette 200 µL of the cell suspension into each well of a 96-well plate. If all wells are not required, it is advisable to add 200 µL of 1x PBS to each empty well to avoid evaporation.\nIncubate the cells in an incubator as normal at 37 °C.\nNOTE: Cell lines such as glioma cancer cell lines will form spheroids within 24 h. Allow 3D cellular architecture to form by incubating the spheroid for 72 h.\nDay 2\nCheck cells by bright-field microscopy after 24 h. Depending upon the cell line, cells may have formed a spheroid detectable in the bottom of the well.\nNOTE: Established glioma cancer cell lines readily form spheroids within 24 h. Patient-derived glioma cancer cell lines may take up to 1-2 weeks.\n2. Collagen Invasion Assay\nDay 3\nPlace collagen, 5x culture medium, 1 M NaOH, and one 20 mL tube on ice.",
    "Carefully and slowly add 10.4 mL of cold collagen into a chilled culture tube. Avoid bubbles. This quantity of collagen is enough for one 96-well plate. Upscaling is possible, but it is recommended that one 20 mL tube per plate is prepared at a time.\nGently add 1.52 mL of cold sterile 5x culture medium. Avoid bubbles.\nJust before use, gently add 72 μL of cold sterile 1 M NaOH. Keep solution on ice.\nMix gently by pipetting. Avoid bubbles. Efficient mixing leads to a color change (from red to orange-red (pH 7.4) in the medium. Leave the mixture on ice until use.\nCrucial step: Remove 190 μL of supernatant from the 96-well plate prepared on day 1. Be very careful not to disturb the spheroids that formed in the bottom of the well. Use the pipette at an angle towards the side, not the center, of the well.\nGently add 100 μL of the collagen mix to each well. To prevent any spheroid disturbance, pipette the mix down the side of the well. Avoid bubbles. Keep any remaining collagen mix in the 20 mL tube at room temperature to assess polymerization.\nIncubate plate in the incubator for at least 10 min to allow the collagen to polymerize. As a guideline, if the leftover collagen has set, becoming semisolid and sponge-like, the spheroids are ready to be treated with inhibitor.\nAdd the drugs or inhibitors at 2x concentration to the culture medium. Add the medium gently to each well (100 µL per well). Again, pipette the medium down the side of the well to avoid spheroid disturbance.\nObserve and image each spheroid by bright-field microscopy at times T = 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h to assess drug activity. Then return the plate to the incubator.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the invasive behavior of the cell line, migration away from the original spheroid core may be observed from 24 h onwards.\n3. Preparation of Collagen Embedded Spheroids and Migratory Cells for Confocal Microscopy\nPlace the plate in a tissue culture hood and gently remove the supernatant (200 µL). Again, take care not to disturb the spheroid and avoid touching the collagen, as this may interfere with the collagen plug.\nReplace the supernatant with 100 µL of 1x PBS. Repeat this wash step 3x.\nRemove the final wash and replace with 4% formaldehyde in 1x PBS (100 µL per well).\nCAUTION: Formaldehyde is a potential carcinogen. Handle with care in accordance with health and safety guidelines.\nPlace the 96-well plate on a lab bench, cover with foil, and leave for 24 h at room temperature.\nCarefully remove the formaldehyde and replace with 1x PBS. Repeat this 1x PBS wash 3x.\nPrepare 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS. Remove the 1x PBS wash and replace with 100 µL of the Triton X-100 solution. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. In the meantime, prepare the blocking solution with 1x PBS and 0.05% skimmed milk powder and mix thoroughly.\nRemove Triton X-100 and wash 3x with 1x PBS. Add 100 µL of blocking solution to each well and incubate for 15 min.\nDilute the required primary antibody in blocking buffer at the predetermined concentration. Here, use anti-mouse IgG acetylated tubulin antibody (1:100).\nCentrifuge the primary antibody-blocking buffer mix for 5 min at 15,682 x g. Carefully remove the blocking solution and add the supernatant (25−50 µL) to each well. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 1 h.\nRemove the antibody solution and wash 3x with 1x PBS (100 µL per well).",
    "Dilute the secondary antibody in the blocking buffer at the recommended or predetermined concentration in addition to any additional fluorescent stains. Here, use 1:500 anti-mouse fluorophore-488 conjugated antibody, phalloidin-594 (1:500) for actin staining, and the DNA stain (DAPI).\nAgain, centrifuge the secondary antibody solution for 5 min at 13,000 rpm.\nRemove the blocking solution from each well and add 25−50 µL of the secondary antibody/phalloidin/DAPI mix. Incubate in the dark for 1.5 h at room temperature.\nRemove secondary antibody-dye solution and wash 3x with 1x PBS (100 µL per well).\nCarefully lift individual collagen plugs by suction with a plastic pipette (200 µL) onto the center of a high-quality plain glass slide.\nAdd one drop of a suitable mountant to the collagen plug, ensuring the plug is completely covered. Avoid bubbles.\nApply coverslip of the optimal thickness for the microscope objective that will be used for imaging and allow to set overnight. Store the slides at room temperature in the dark.\n4. Fluorescence Microscopy\nCapture fluorescent images using a suitable confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
