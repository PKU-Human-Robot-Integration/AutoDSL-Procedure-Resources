Coverslip coating and fiducial markers attachment procedure\nFirst, the coverslip is coated with Poly-L-lysine (A), followed by incubation with a Au NPs suspension (B) and then air-dried (C). Once the surface is ready for cell culture, reference marks are added to the bottom of the coverslip for further alignment (D).\nNote: On the presented example, poly-L-lysine has been used only to ensure correct adsorption of the Au NPs to the glass surface, since MDCK cells do not require any substrate coating to grow. Though this possibility has not been tested, alternative coatings required to ensure cell attachment should not interfere with the protocol, provided that they allow the correct visualization of the Au NPS over the substrate.\nRinse with deionized water and air-dry.\nNote: Though sterile working conditions are optional during this phase, drying steps should be performed in a fume hood to keep the coverslip surface as clean as possible.\nPrepare a suspension of Au NPs (in deionized water) to achieve a final density along the coverslip surface of around 1–5 × 104 particles mm−2.\nThoroughly vortex the Au NPs stock before pipetting the required volume on a separate tube.\nSonicate the suspension in a bath sonicator for 3 cycles of 30 s at the highest output setting to break up NP aggregates.\nDilute the suspension to the desired concentration in deionized water.",
    "Note: In our case, 250 nm spherical gold nanoparticles were used, as they can be easily observed both under the confocal and scanning electron microscopes. Au NPs with smaller sizes or different shapes can also be used, though final density may need to be adjusted to ensure that individual NPs can be observed near the structures of interest.\nCritical: The presence of salts in the Au NPs suspension could cause undesired aggregation.\nAdd 650 μL of Au NPs suspension to the inset, incubate for 2 h at 37°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: You may need to optimize the final density of fiducial markers by adjusting Au NPs concentration and/or incubation time. Au NPs suspension volume may vary for different dish sizes.\nRetire the remaining solution and air-dry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nMark the bottom of the coverslip with an ethanol-resistant marker to orient the sample during subsequent image acquisition steps. Two marks, defining “north” and “east” of the sample are typically enough (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCell culture\nTiming: 2–3 days\nCritical: These steps should be carried out under sterile working conditions.\nNote: This protocol has been optimized for the imaging of midbody remnants on renal epithelial MDCK cells, other cell types or structures of interest may require additional steps or different conditions.\nSterilize the dish previously coated with Au NPs by exposing it to the germicide lamp of a cell culture hood for 15–30 min.\nAdd 2 mL of MDCK cells expressing the desired fluorescent fusion proteins (7.5 × 104 mL−1) suspended in MEM to the plate.\nCritical: The initial number of cells must be optimized according to the cell line and the duration of the culturing phase, so that the culture is not completely confluent by the time of fixing.\nNote: Culture media may vary for different cell types.",
    "Culture the cells for 48–72 h at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nCritical: For the alignment strategy to work, culture must be subconfluent at the time of fixing. For this, the initial number of cells and duration of the culturing phase must be adjusted. The goal is not to achieve a specific percentage of confluence, but to ensure that the substrate and Au NPs are exposed in some areas (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If the use of subconfluent cultures represents a limitation, see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]: Use of confluent cultures.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/915-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Confocal dataset of the CLEM procedure\n(A) Confocal large-FOV image (contrast enhanced).\n(B) Confocal medium-FOV image.\n(C) Look-up image showing the localization of the medium-FOV images and structures of interest (squares and circles respectively). Arrowheads in (B) show the position of the Au NPs that are closer to the structure of interest (circle). Magenta box in C corresponds to the imaging area shown in B.\nFixation\nTiming: 2–10 h\nCritical: Only electron microscopy-rated fixatives must be used, common-use aldehydes might include traces of organic solvents, such as methanol, that can damage the cell surface.\nAdd a volume of 2× fixing solution (4% paraformaldehyde + 4% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer 0.2 M) equal to the volume of culture medium (MEM) in the dish. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature (RT; 20°C–22°C).\nRemove most of the liquid and add fresh 1× fixing solution (2% paraformaldehyde + 2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer 0.1 M). Incubate for 2 h at 20°C–22°C or 8–10 h at 4°C.\nPause point: Samples can be stored in fixing solution at 4°C for up to a week.\nAlternative: Different storage solutions, such as PBS, can also be used. In such case, the addition of antibacterial agents (Penicilin-Streptomycin or sodium azide) is advised.\nConfocal imaging",
    "Timing: 4–6 h\nDuring this phase, the localization of the surface features of interest labeled with fluorescent proteins and the Au NPs present in the sample is determined by confocal fluorescence and reflection microscopy, respectively. Candidate structures for CLEM analysis are selected, and all the relevant confocal images are acquired.\nSubstitute fixing solution with phosphate buffer 0.1 M.\nPlace the dish on the sample stage, using the marks added during step 6 as a reference. Perform the imaging at the center of the coverslip if possible.\nAcquire a large field-of-view (FOV) (2 × 2 mm) image for alignment and navigation purposes, including the fluorescence signals and the reflection channel showing the Au NPs. In our case, these images were generated by acquiring a 10 × 10 tilescan z-stack (5 μm total with 250 nm steps) with a resonant scanner, 8× averaging and pixel size of 200 nm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: Acquisition settings must be optimized depending on the abundance of the structure of interest, the proportion of cells expressing the fluorescent protein and signal strength.\nCritical: We strongly recommend performing all the confocal imaging in one session to guarantee a fixed sample orientation. If this is not possible, the rest of the images can be acquired on a different session, though alignment might be an issue and require special attention.\nLocalize candidate surface features and acquire medium-FOV (100 × 100 μm) images, including the fluorescence signals and the reflection channel showing the Au NPs. We acquired these images with a unidirectional galvano scanner, no averaging and 50 nm pixel size (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The closer a candidate structure is to an area with exposed substrate, the easier will be to localize it under the scanning electron microscope (SEM).",
    "Critical: When selecting the imaging region, be sure to include an area with exposed substrate including Au NPs near the structure(s) of interest (see arrowheads on Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAs medium-FOV images are recorded, keep track on their position relative to the large-FOV image. This information is needed for the elaboration of the look-up map (see next step). A convenient way of doing this is by using the option that most microscope manufacturers offer of re-centering the stage to a given position of a previously acquired image when a motorized stage is available. During this process, the position of each medium-FOV image is generally annotated on an additional copy of the large-FOV image. If this capability is not available, see “troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]: Confocal dataset tracing” for alternatives.\nPrior to sample removal, record the objective position, and thus imaging area, relative to the coverslip. For this, a picture of the stage adaptor during the imaging session can be taken. Additionally, once the backside of the coverslip has been cleaned, make an additional ethanol-resistant mark on the same position to frame the imaged area.\nNote: The mark indicating the area imaged by confocal microscopy is used as starting point for SEM imaging, and thus should be as accurate as possible.\nPause point: Samples can be stored for up to a week at 4°C upon substitution of the phosphate buffer by 1× fixing solution.\nAlternative: Different storage solutions, such as PBS, can also be used. In such case, the addition of antibacterial agents (Penicilin-Streptomycin or sodium azide) is advised.\nLook-up map elaboration\nTiming: 30 min",
    "In order to facilitate the correlation process, it is recommended to elaborate a look-up map prior to the SEM imaging session. This consists of the large-FOV confocal image of the full area where the position of each medium-FOV imaged is indicated. This will be helpful both for navigation and identification of individual structures in the sample along the SEM session.\nOpen the large-FOV image in ImageJ. Given the file size, performing a z-projection and creating a compressed jpeg version is advised.\nHighlight and identify the regions that correspond to each medium-FOV image, repeat the process with the candidate structures present inside them. This will allow to identify each structure, keeping track of its corresponding medium and large-FOV images (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCoverslip extraction\nTiming: 5 min\nCritical: This process involves removing most of the liquid from the dish, it must be carried out as fast as possible to avoid uncontrolled drying.\nNote: This phase must be carried out on a fume hood.\nRemove most of the liquid from the dish, turn it upside-down and add some drops of acetone around the perimeter of the coverslip. Incubate for 5–10 s (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B), then and clean any remaining acetone.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/915-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Coverslip extraction procedure\n(A) First, imaged region is marked on the bottom of the coverslip.\n(B–F) (B) Following buffer removal, the dish is turned upside-down, and acetone is added around the perimeter of the coverslip. Once the adhesive has softened, coverslip is extracted by uniformly applying pressure from the sample-side on the coverslip with a hollow cylinder (C and D) or by using a scalpel (E and F).",
    "Now that the adhesive is soft, apply pressure homogeneously along the coverslip perimeter from the inside (sample side). This can be done by pushing the dish against a hollow cylinder with a slightly smaller diameter than the inset (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nNote: This coverslip detaching technique involves touching the periphery of the sample surface, and must be carried out with extreme care.\nAlternative: If a hollow cylinder of the appropriate size is not available, or the nature of the sample is incompatible with the aforementioned technique, the coverslip can also be detached with the help of a scalpel. For this, Introduce a scalpel in between the coverslip and the plastic and gently rotate the dish to liberate the coverslip (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F). This technique, however, is prone to coverslip cracking and must be carried out with extreme care.\nOnce the coverslip is detached, place it (sample facing up) quickly on a 6-well plate with phosphate buffer and remove any remaining adhesive if needed.\nDehydration and drying\nTiming: 10 h\nNote: This protocol has been optimized for the acquisition of high resolution SEM images, which requires high vacuum conditions. Therefore, the samples must be dehydrated and dried before the session.\nSample dehydration is carried out in order to substitute all the water in the sample by an organic solvent (ethanol), preparing it for subsequent drying steps (Katsen-Globa et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Ethanol is substituted then by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), a low tension volatile non-polar solvent that mediates sample drying without requiring any special equipment.\nCritical: These steps must be carried out on a fume hood. HMDS is highly toxic and must be handled wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment.",
    "Immerse the samples in increasing concentrations of ethanol starting with 10%, increasing with 10% increments up to 100%, incubating 3 min per solution.\nAfter reaching 100% ethanol, incubate 3 min in a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and HMDS, followed by an additional 3 min incubation in pure HMDS.\nCritical: Increased incubation times with HMDS can cause severe cell shrinkage.\nRemove all the liquid from the dish and air-dry on the fume hood overnight.\nNote: This protocol has been optimized for epithelial cells, non-adherent cell types might require additional steps, such as osmium post-fixation.\nPause point: Uncoated biological samples might re-hydrate or degrade after drying. We therefore recommend carrying out these steps within one week before SEM imaging session. In the meantime, samples must be stored in a dry environment to help preserving their integrity.\nSEM imaging\nTiming: 2–5 h\nThis step includes a first stage where the candidate cell surface features imaged by confocal microscopy are located. This is followed by a second phase where small-FOV SEM images of those structures are acquired.\nMount the sample on the SEM stub (large stub, diameter > 30 mm, see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Keep track of the substrate orientation and position of interest, as marked after confocal imaging:\nUse a thin conductive double sided tape (carbon) to attach the sample (cells on the upper side) to the aluminum stub (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B). Align the reference marks done on the sample during the last stage of “coating and addition of gold fiducial markers to the coverslip[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]” section [step 6] with the stub in such a way that you can keep track of orientation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/915-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. SEM sample mounting\n(A and B) Carbon double-tape is used to attach the coverslip to the stub holder.",
    "(C) Copper tape is used to provide some electric contact between the sample surface and the stub holder.\n(D) Sample is then placed on the holder, aligned to its axis using the reference marks (arrowheads) and introduced on the SEM chamber.\n(E) An in-chamber image can be used for navigation purposes, reference marks (arrowheads) can be used to align the sample with the microscope moving axis.\nAfter that, frame the edges of the glass substrate with metallic tape (copper, aluminum) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). In this way, the upper surface of the substrate is in electric contact with the SEM holder and this slightly helps to mitigate sample charging during imaging. Be careful not to cover or touch the area imaged by confocal microscopy.\nPlace the stub on the SEM stage holder (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) and introduce it on the SEM chamber. Orient the sample matching the microscope motion axis by using the reference marks.\nKeep track of the position of the imaged area (marked at the end “Confocal imaging” stage [step 17]) relative to an easy to identify part of the sample, such as the border.\nNote: Some SEM microscopes include optical navigation systems that allow to use an image of the mounted sample as a navigation reference (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nLocate the surface features of interest identified by confocal microscopy:\nNavigate to the area imaged by confocal microscopy.\nSet the working conditions for the electron beam: desired working distance (we used 4 mm), very low voltage and low current to minimize charge effects. For the latter two parameters, we recommend 0.5–1 kV and 13–25 pA, respectively. Align the column.\nNote: when adjusting the working distance, consider that it must allow the acquisition of all the different FOV sizes required.",
    "Acquire a large-FOV (2 mm wide, around 50×) image in order to compare with the look-up map (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Either the in-chamber or the in-lens SE detectors can be employed here. Beam dwell times around 1–3 μs are usually adequate, as charge is not a big problem at this low magnification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/915-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. SEM large-, medium- and small-FOV images and initial alignment\nLarge FOV SEM image (A) is compared to its confocal counterpart (contrast-enhanced) (B). The contours originated by the cell colonies (dotted lines in all panels) serve as navigation cues and allow to unequivocally find the same imaging area using different imaging techniques. Occasional imperfections in the sample, such as the dirt fiber shown in the top-left of A and B panels, can also facilitate orientation and alignment process. This allows the localization of the mid-FOV imaging areas (C and D) (magenta boxes on panels A and B) containing the structure of interest. The pattern formed by the Au NPs on the substrate (arrowheads on panels C and D) is used to localize the structures of interest on the SEM (blue box in C). Once the surface feature of interest has been localized on the mid-FOV SEM image, the small-FOV (E) and tilt images (F) can be acquired. Magenta dotted boxes in C and D correspond to the regions aligned in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and represented after alignment on Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nCompare both confocal and SEM large-FOV images and identify relevant structures such as the pattern formed by the cells, occasional defects, etc., that allow correlating them (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). Correct the position and the orientation of the sample if needed. Typically, Au NPs are still not visible at this stage and therefore they cannot serve as a reference yet.",
    "Using the look-up map, start identifying the sections of interest in the sample. Acquire medium-FOV (100 μm wide, around 1,000×) images (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Dwell times in the range of 100–300 ns are appropriate here. The imaged area should be equivalent to the medium-FOV confocal microscopy images obtained in step 15 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). Areas of the substrate showing the Au NPs must remain visible. For the medium-FOV images the in-lens secondary electrons detector is preferable to the in-chamber one as it provides better resolution.\nNote: Depending on the size of the structures of interest, higher resolution images, in terms of pixels, might be needed at this point. As a reference, we employed 3072∗2048 pixels for the medium-FOV images, keeping the rest of the images at 1536∗1024 pixels. Image definition here must be high enough to allow the observation of the Au NPs and the identification of the surface features of interest by using the position of the Au NPs as a reference.\nBy comparing confocal and SEM medium-FOV images, identify the regions where the structures of interest are located (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D). Then, the pattern formed by the Au NPs is used to univocally localize them.\nSmall-FOV SEM image acquisition of the surface features of interest:\nTake small-FOV images (in the range of 10,000×−100,000×) with the in-lens SE detector. For imaging of midbody remnants, the range 25,000×−60,000× with FOV width of around 2–5 μm was employed (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). At these high magnifications, low-dwell times (50–100 ns) will be mandatory to reduce charge effects. Frame integration (around 100–200 frames) with software drift correction activated will allow to increase the image signal-to-noise ratio.\nNote: Charge accumulation might be an issue at this magnification level. For persistent charge effect issues, see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]: Charge during SEM imaging.",
    "If views of the structures from different orientations are needed, tilt and rotate the sample stage (depending on the options available in your SEM equipment) and acquire images in the same conditions (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nCritical: Intensive focusing on the structures can produce damage by the electron beam or induce the deposition of carbon coating. Therefore, careful alignment of the beam in a region close to the structure of interest is recommended before moving to the intended section. This way, the image is acquired without any previous exposition of the area of interest to the beam.\nImage alignment\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIf the goal of the correlative approach is to localize a structure that stands out against the cell surface, the analysis of the overall pattern of the cells and the Au NPs (as exposed in the previous steps) is usually enough. If a more precise localization or correlation is required, confocal and SEM images must be aligned.\nOpen the medium-FOV confocal and SEM images on ImageJ, perform brightness and contrast adjustments if needed. Find the structure of interest and crop a region around it, including the closest Au NPs, in both images (magenta boxes in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D).\nNote: The closer the structure of interest is to the Au NPs, the better the alignment will be (see “troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]: Image alignment” if this requirement is difficult to fulfill).\nGenerate the final confocal image by selecting the desired planes, making projections, etc. Then, split the channels and save each one of them as a different TIFF file.\nStart a new TrakEM2 project (File – New – TrakEM2 (blank)), two windows will appear:\nThe “Project” window, formed by three columns (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/915-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Alignment process with TrakEM2 plug-in",
    "(A) Detail of the “Project” window of TrackEM2, showing the “Layers” section including two layers for the confocal and SEM images respectively.\n(B) Overview of the “Navigation” window, including the “Patches” list in the left and an overview of the currently visible image (Au NPs in the example).\n(C) Magnification of the “Patches” list after confocal images have been imported, linked, and only the one containing Au NPs left visible.\n(D) Result of manual landmark registering in both confocal (left) and SEM images (right), note that the number assigned to each fiducial marker is the same in both images, and that their size is not the same due to different sampling.\n(E) Same images after alignment, note that the confocal image has been scaled and translated to match its SEM counterpart, which has remained unchanged.\n(F) Magnification of the “Patched” list after the inclusion of the SEM image in the same layer as the confocal counterparts, note that all the images are linked together to preserve the alignment.\n(G) Small-FOV SEM image is placed on top of the mid-FOV one and manually aligned.\n(H) Final state of the “Layers” section prior to stack exportation to ImageJ, note there is one layer per image in the dataset. Red arrowheads and arrows in C and F highlight the visible images and the linked ones, respectively.\nThe “Navigation” window, consisting of a black canvas and surrounding menus (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nNote: For further details on how to use TrakEM2 plugin, please refer to the manual available at www.ini.uzh.ch/∼acardona/trakem2[href=http://www.ini.uzh.ch/%7Eacardona/trakem2].\nCreate a new layer (on the “Project” window, layers column: select “Top Level [layer set]” - right click - new layer – z coordinate:1 – OK). Rename the layers as “Confocal” and “SEM” respectively (right click on each layer – rename) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).",
    "Critical: When creating a new layer on TrakEM2, a “z coordinate” value different than 0 must be chosen, otherwise the alignment process will fail.\nImport all the confocal images to the “Confocal” layer (drag-and-drop the files from a folder to the canvas). The three images will be placed on top of each other, and will be listed on the “Patches” list in the left side of the window (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C). Move to the “SEM” layer (use “<” and “>” keys to navigate between layers) and add the SEM image to it following the same procedure.\nNext, link all the images in the “Confocal” layer (so the different channels remain aligned) and make visible only the channel containing the Au NPs. This is achieved by using the “link” (chain) and “visibility” (eye) icons (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nRegister both images using the Au NPs as manual landmarks (right click on the canvas – align – align layers manually with landmarks). Then, select the Au NPs near the feature of interest one by one in the same order (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nAlign both images by “similarity” (right click on the canvas – apply transform – model: similarity – Propagate to first layer – OK), the layer containing the confocal image will be translated, rotated and scaled according to the Au NPs position (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nCritical: The selected layer during the alignment process will be used as a reference, and will not be modified. In order to keep the orientation stable along the SEM dataset, the mid-magnification SEM image must be the one used as a reference.\nOnce both medium-FOV images are aligned (see limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section), put them all in the same layer and link them (right-click on the SEM image in the “Patches” list – “Send to previous layer”) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F).",
    "Scale the images to match pixel size with the high magnification SEM image:\nSelect all images from “Patches” list\nRight-click on canvas – transform – transform (affine)\nRight-click on canvas – specify transform. Introduce the same scaling factor in X and Y.\nRight-click on calvas – apply transform.\nNote: Pixel size can be found on the image metadata, or calculated considering the field of view and the resolution of the images. If necessary, re-scale the canvas to fit the entire image (Right-click – Display – Autoresize canvas/LayerSet).\nImport the small-FOV SEM image to the same layer, and manually align it to the mid-FOV SEM image (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]G). For this, image “visibility” icon (eye) can be used.\nCreate as many new layers as necessary, then move every image to a separate layer (select images on the “Patches” list – right-click – send to next layer) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]H).\nMake sure all the images are visible and export the final stack to ImageJ (right-click on canvas – Export – Make flat image, set “Start” and “End” fields to span all the layers)."
