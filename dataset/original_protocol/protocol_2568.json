    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRehydration and antigen retrieval round 1\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step describes how to rehydrate tissue sections and perform antigen retrieval using a pressure cooker (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2201-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of cyclic rounds of staining and stripping\nStaining starts in rehydration and endogenous peroxidase blocking. Continues with heat-induced antigen retrieval process with a pH solution. Staining steps with primary and secondary antibodies follow. The secondary antibody is coupled to HRP-enzyme, which in the presence of VIP substrate precipitates in a chromogenic reaction (purple). Staining finishes with counterstain, dehydration and mounting of cover slip. Finally, the staining is imaged using a microscope slide scanner.\nMake sure slides are marked with appropriate information.\nNote: Pencil is recommended for labelling the slides. Pens can be washed away due to subsequent steps using alcohols. Alternatively, pathology services use histology printer slides.\nLoad slides into a rack and place in de-waxing xylenes, 2 × 5 min.\nTransfer slides to ethanol 99% solution for 3 min.\nBlock any endogenous peroxidase activity by placing slides into H2O2 Endogenous peroxidase blocking solution, 2 × 3 min.\nNote: See recipe in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section “H2O2 Endogenous peroxidase blocking solution”.\nTransfer to final ethanol 99% solution for 3 min.\nAlternatives: Gradual rehydration with decreasing concentrations of ethanol (99%, 70% and 50%) leads to comparable results.\nRinse in running water, 1 min.\nUse pressure cooker for heat-induced antigen retrieval (HIAR).\nAlternatives: A water bath or microwave are also reliable methods for HIAR.\nSwitch on hotplate and set to full temperature (400°C) by turning the dial to maximum.\nCritical: For safety reasons, this protocol has been adapted for a conventional pressure cooker with a laboratory hot plate. Electrical pressure cookers can also be used.",
    "Prepare the Antigen-retrieval buffer. See recipe in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section “Citrate antigen retrieval”.\nReplace the lid, but do not lock.\nAllow solution to warm until boiling (∼10 min).\nCarefully lower the rehydrated histological slides into the boiling solution.\nReplace lid and lock and set pressure selector to the highest-pressure symbol.\nOnce the red pressure indicator has risen and a steady flow of steam is escaping from the outlet valve, start timing for 10 min.\nAfter 10 min, switch off the hotplate using the dial, carefully remove the pressure cooker and transfer to a sink.\nNote: Changes in concentration, pH and Formalin exposure will introduce variability. Some epitopes are formalin-resistant while others undergo substantial changes (formalin-sensitive).\nAlternatives: Citrate buffer (pH 6.0) is the most used solution for HIAR. This protocol uses citric buffer for antigen retrieval. Alternatively, EDTA (pH 8.0), Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0), and Tris (pH 10.0) buffers can be used. The pH of the buffers is an essential factor for antigen refolding or for antigenic determinant exposure. pH 8–9 is suitable for most antigens, although certain nuclear antigens show optimal staining at pH.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Unless the antigen retrieval method is stated on the antibody datasheet, the optimal method for each antigen must be tested experimentally.\nCritical: Enzymatic digestion such as proteinase K, trypsin and pepsin are not suitable for the current IHC multiplex protocol. Enzymatic digestion compromises the detection of epitopes that are suitable for HIAR. For instance, proteinase K is recommended when using anti-F4/80 antibodies, while poor antigen quality after consecutive anti-CD206 staining using pressure cooker antigen retrieval will lead to negative staining.\nLifting (or removing) the valve, pushing a button or turning a dial (depending on the pressure cooker). This method involves strong vapor evacuation.",
    "Critical: This release method does not cool down the pressure cooker like the cold-water release method. To avoid scalding injury, care must be taken when releasing the steam.\nOnce pressure cooker is open, allow the tissue slides to cool down in running tap water for 5 min.\nTake out the slides from the pressure cooker and place them in a slide jar with ddH20 ensuring the slides do not dry. The slides are now ready for subsequent staining.\nNote: Tissue slides can be kept in water during 1–2 h. However, if longer periods are required, slides should be kept in TBS-Tween 20 (TBST).\nCritical: Reagents for dehydration and rehydration inside the staining jars can be kept under the fume hood at RT. However, it is important to change them once a week especially the H2O2 endogenous peroxidase blocking solution.\nImmunohistochemistry round 1\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes how to detect antigen-antibody binding in tissue sections (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: All the incubation processes should be performed under a humidified chamber in a staining tray at RT and covered to avoid slides drying out. To create a humidified chamber, add a piece of tissue paper covered in water at the bottom of the tray. Washes can be performed in histology staining jars.\nUse ImmEdge Hydrophobic Barrier PAP Pen to draw a circle around a specimen on the slide. It will help to keep reagents localized on tissue specimens and prevents mixing of reagents when multiple sections are mounted on the same slide.\nCritical: PAP pen is considered as Cancer and Reproductive Harm. www.P65Warnings.ca.gov[href=https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov].\nTransfer the slides into TBST.\nNote: see recipe in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nAlternatives: Commercial wash buffers with similar composition such as Dako wash buffer 10× can be used instead.",
    "Remove unspecific staining by incubating the sections with 1%BSA-TBS for 30 min RT.\nAlternatives: Normal serum can be used to block non-specific binding matching the species of the secondary antibody. Serum contains antibodies that bind to non-specific sites in the tissue or to Fc receptors. Pooled serum from healthy adult animals at 2.5% is commercially available. In this experiment, 2.5% Normal Goat Serum was used since the secondary antibody was raised in Goat.\nAdd 100–300 μL (depending on size of specimen) of primary antibody, in this case Anti-PD-L1 (1:200, 4.37 μm/mL) to antibody diluent (Emerald antibody diluent) for 40 min RT.\nAlternatives: Emerald diluent is commercially available –but 1% BSA-TBS can be used instead.\nCritical: This protocol was optimized for PD-L1 and CD206 detection in consecutive rounds. The antibody order needs to be optimized for each experiment.\nRinse with TBST for 2 × 5 min at RT.\nApply 100–300 μL (depending on specimen size) anti-rabbit secondary antibody polymer conjugated (ImmPRESS® Polymer Reagent) Ready to Use (RTU). Incubate for 45 min at RT.\nNote: ImmPRESS reagents are sold as RTU solutions. Small biopsies or tissue sections such as mouse spleen are covered in 100 μL. However larger sections such as those from mouse primary tumors may require 300 μL to cover the entire section.\nRinse with TBST for 2 × 5 min at RT.\nNote: Meanwhile prepare VIP substrate chromogen. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for preparation (3 drops each bottle in 5 mL of PBS).\nSee link: https://vectorlabs.com/products/substrates/vector-vip-hrp-substrate-kit[href=https://vectorlabs.com/products/substrates/vector-vip-hrp-substrate-kit].",
    "Critical: It is especially important to use PBS as diluent for VIP chromogen. ddH2O, antibody diluent or 1%BSA-TBS are not recommended. As specified by the manufacturer instructions, deionized water may contain inhibitors of the peroxidase reaction. Solutions containing sodium azide or other inhibitors of peroxidase activity should not be used when diluting the peroxidase substrate.\nApply Vector VIP HRP substrate chromogen for 10 min at RT.\nNote: Previous published protocols use alcohol soluble chromogens for multiplex staining. VIP chromogen is stable in alcohol, but it is heat sensitive. Advantages of this chromogen: it is as sensitive as DAB and can be removed using regular antigen retrieval procedures such as pressure cooker, water bath or microwave. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nTransfer slides to running tap water for 2 min at RT.\nCritical: Avoid direct contact from running tap water, it could displace the tissue attached to the glass slide.\nCritical: Always run appropriate positive and negative control sections with each staining batch. For the purposes of this protocol mouse spleen was used as positive control.",
    "Note: Tissues where presence of a specific cellular population or antigen are known or expected can be used as positive controls in IHC. For unknown or undescribed antigens of interest https://www.proteinatlas.org/[href=https://www.proteinatlas.org/] can be an indicator. For immune cell populations in mice, mouse spleens are commonly used as positive controls. For human samples, tonsils are used due to easy access for pathology units. Appendix is also a widely used control since it is a tissue rich in inflammatory cells, epithelial cells and stroma. Negative controls are also recommended (no primary antibody or Isotype control antibody can be used). To evaluate specificity of new antibodies, cell lines transfected with siRNA targeting the gene/protein of interest can be used. Agar pellets of cells after RNAi transfections are embedded in paraffin and the same IHC protocol can be applied to confirm specific antibody binding. Efficiency of RNAi transfection needs to be confirmed by either qPCR or western blot.\nCounterstain, clear, and mount round 1\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes how to counterstain with Hematoxylin, dehydrate the tissues and mount with cover-slides (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nIncubate the slides in Harris Hematoxylin for 3 min at RT.\nTransfer slides to running tap water for 2 min at RT.\nDip quickly in Acid alcohol (1%) for 2–3 s at RT.\nCritical: It is especially important not to leave the slides for longer than a few seconds in Acid alcohol, as it can remove most of the Hematoxylin and part of the VIP chromogen.\nTransfer slides to running tap water in tap water for 2 min.\nIncubate in Ammonia water solution (0.2%) for 3 min.\nRinse in tap water for 2 min.\nTransfer slides to ethanol 99% solution for 3 × 3 min.",
    "Alternatives: Gradual dehydration with increasing concentrations of ethanol (50%, 70% and 99%) leads to comparable results.\nTransfer slides to Xylene 2 × 3 min.\nMount the slides using DPX mounting media adding the coverslip.\nCritical: Aqueous mounting media is not suitable for dehydrated slides in Xylene or organic solvents.\nLet to dry out the slides for 12–16 h under the fume hood.\nAlternatives: Gill’s or Meyer’s Hematoxylin can also be used. However, these hematoxylins are progressive, and steps 22–25 should be avoided. The incubation time should be 3–4 min longer if Gill’s or Meyer’s Hematoxylin are used.\nTissue scanning round 1\nTiming: 30 min–4 h\nThis step describes how to image the stained sections using a high-capacity digital pathology slide scanner. In this case, we have used NanoZoomer s210 Digital slide scanner from Hamamatsu (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPlace the slides in the scanning tray and perform single or batch scanning, according to the number of slides in the experiment.\nSet the Region of scan and place crosses in the focus points. Set 40× as resolution.\nPause point: If needed the slides can be stored and re-start Round 2 when desired. They can be used up to 6 times.\nNote: Mounted stained tissue slides should be stored at RT in an airtight container. Slides can be reused even after two years, if the slides are kept dry.\nRehydration and antigen retrieval round 2\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes how to perform rehydration and antigen retrieval procedure in slides that have already been stained (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPlace the slides from round 1 into Xylene jar for at least 12–24 h.\nRemove the coverslip carefully.\nRe-start the process of rehydration and antigen retrieval as in “rehydration and antigen retrieval round 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]” section.",
    "Critical: After antigen retrieval, slides should be unstained. If strong staining is observed in previous round, longer HIER is required to remove completely the VIP chromogen. This should be optimized by the user depending on the antibodies used. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nImmunohistochemistry round 2\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step describes how to perform rehydration and antigen retrieval in slides that have been previously stained, while blocking the previous primary antibody.\nUse PAP pen to draw a circle around a specimen on a slide.\nTransfer the slides into TSBT.\nIncubate sections for 30 min with Fab fragment anti-rabbit (1:50, diluted in TBS) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min.\nNote: Step 37 might be optional depending on the species of the primary antibodies. For instance, if in round 1 the primary antibody was rabbit, and in round 2 is mouse or rat there is no need to use Fab.\nIncubate sections for 40 min at RT with a solution of 100–300 μL (depending on size of specimen) of primary antibody, in this case anti-CD206 (1:1000, 1 μm/mL) in antibody diluent.\nRinse with TBST buffer for 2 × 5 min.\nApply 2–6 drops (depending on size of specimen) of secondary antibody polymer conjugated (ImmPRESS® Polymer Reagent) Ready to Use. Incubate for 45 min at RT. In this case it was an anti-rabbit antibody.\nRinse with TBST for 2 × 5 min. Meanwhile prepare VIP substrate chromogen. Follow manufacturer instructions for preparation, see recipe in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section “VIP HRP substrate chromogen”.\nApply Vector VIP HRP substrate chromogen for 10 min at RT.\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nTransfer slides to running tap water.\nCounterstain, clear, and mount round 2\nTiming: 30 min\nThis part of the protocol is the same as Round 1 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nTissue scanning round 2",
    "Timing: 30 min to 4 h\nThis part of the protocol is the same as Round 1 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nImage alignment and pseudocolor image\nTiming: ∼30 min per slide\nThis step describes how to align images of two consecutive staining procedures and scans in the same tissue section. Furthermore, it creates a digital multiplex image that can be exported for quantification. To do so, QuPath6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and FIJI ImageJ7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] were used (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2201-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Registration of WSI is complex. TrakEM2 does not allow registration of WSI.\nImporting ROIs for alignment.\nDrag the folder (should start with trackem2.) with the two images, in this case PD-L1 and CD206 from the same region to the TrakEM2 plug-in.\nSet up the alignment tools. Once the folder containing the images is dragged, the plug-in will ask type of Directory.\nPress stack. Next, the slide separation by default 1.\nNext, “Right click” in the first image “Align”> “Align stack slices”. Leave by default all the Registration options (Rigid Registration).\nNote: Scroll the mouse to verify the alignment between the images. If images are not automatically aligned, manual supervised co-registration is possible. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nExporting aligned images.\nPress “Right click” on the image “Export”> ”Make flat image…”.\nNext choose Type: “RGB Color”, Start: “1: z=0.0 [layer]” and End: “2: z=1.0 [layer]”. Click Best Quality and Continue.\nMerged imaged in Tiff format will be created. Scroll the mouse to verify that the two staining images are completely aligned.",
    "Transform stack to flat images.\nGo to “Image”> “Stacks”> “Stacks to Images”.\nName is each registered image. For example, PD-L1, CD206 in this case.\nColor Deconvolution. IHC images in this case have been counterstained with hematoxylin to identify the nucleus and perform a better alignment. Each image needs to be split in three channels: Channel 1: Nuclei or Hematoxylin, Channel 2: Chromogen VIP and Channel 3: Residual.\nGo to “Image”> “Color”> “Color Deconvolution”. We choose Vector: “H AEC” for PD-L1 and “H DAB” for CD206in the window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). AEC is a Red/Purple chromogen. Discard Channel 3 stack images.\nRepeat the process for Channel 1 and Channel 2 Stacks.\nChoose only one image for Channel1 or nuclear staining. Keep both images from Channel 2. Change the name to images to better identification. “Click” on the image “Image”> “Rename…” Give names such as Nuclei, PD-L1 and CD206.\nNote: Custom color deconvolution can be performed if the chromogens used are different to the ones used in the present protocol. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nMerge the images.\nGo to “Image” > “Color”> “Merge Channels…” Choose for each image one color. For instance, in C1 (red) select “CD206” Image, in C2 (green) select “PD-L1” and in C3 (blue) select “Nuclei” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCreate a pseudo-color composite image. Following the previous process, a new stack image will be generated.\nGo to “Image”> “Color”> “Channel Tool…” Channel to “Color” mode. For “Channel 1” go to “More”, select color “Red”, press “More” again and “Edit LUT” and “Invert…”\nPerform the same step in the Channel 2 and 3 using color Green and Blue accordingly.\nFinally Change “Color” mode to “Composite”. Save the image in Tiff format (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F).\nImage analysis and quantification\nTiming: 1–2 h for project",
    "In the example below, 5555 murine melanoma cells derived from the BRAF-V600E mouse melanoma model8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] were selected for their lack of response to anti-PD-1 in vivo (anti-PD-1/NR). 1 million 5555-anti-PD-1/NR cells were injected subcutaneously into 7-week-old C57BL/6J female mice. Tumors were grown for up to 27 days (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Tumors were excised and fixed. The combination therapy of anti-PD1 plus ROCK inhibitor resulted in higher number of regressions (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), and IHC was performed to assess effects on macrophage markers (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2201-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Image analysis of multiplexed images\nSteps described in image analysis and quantification[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.10] section.\n(A–C) (A) Growth curves, (B) regression rates and (C) quantification of PD-L1 in CD206 positive cells from JL Orgaz., et al.

In our example, we used Channel 1: Blue, Channel 2: Green and Channel 3: Red.\nCreate annotations in all the cases.",
    "Critical: Before any segmentation or analysis, you need to generate annotation in the region of interest.\nRun> Cell detection (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). Use “channel 2” (green, CD206) for detection channel. Furthermore, set-up an appropriate threshold to calculate different intensities. We used “Channel 3: Cell Mean” (red, PD-L1) for “score compartment” and threshold +1: 30, threshold +2: 50 and threshold +3:70.\nNote: Depending on antigen of interest subcellular localization, the score compartment should be optimized (Cell, Cytoplasm or Nuclear). Intensity thresholds should be adapted to the specific staining. Percentage of positivity instead of Histoscore can also be used as a measure by clicking “single threshold”.\nNote: For quantification purposes we use Histoscore instead of positive percentage since it provides semiquantitative information. Histoscore or H-score is used commonly in quantitative pathology. Hscore is calculated combining the intensity of staining (graded as: 0, non-staining; 1, weak; 2, median; or 3, strong) and the percentage of positive cells. The range of scores is from 0 to 300.\nCritical: Default settings may allow cell detection, but this step may require some optimization. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section, problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nExport “Annotation measurement” table (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nPlot the H-score results. This method follows the analysis used in J.Orgaz et al. Cancer Cell 2020. We used Box-plot graph Boxplots show median (center line); interquartile range (box); min-max (whiskers); and individual mice (circles). p-values by ANOVA with Yekutieli correction (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nAutomation and batch analysis\nScripts can be used for Color deconvolution in FIJI and Image analysis in QuPath.\nCreating macros in Fiji-ImageJ. Use recording tool in macros section. Go to Plugins>Macros>Record.\nColor Deconvolution Macro. Now that ImageJ is recording. Select the image of interest and perform color deconvolution. Go to the window macro and create a script (See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2201-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
