    "All animal experiments complied with international regulations for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the regional regulatory authorities (No. 1250, Regierungspräsidium Tübingen, Germany). All mice were maintained in groups of two to five animals per cage on a 14-h light, 10-h dark circadian rhythm with water and food provided ad libitum.\n1. Preparation of the Surgical Material and Pre-treatment of the Mice\nSterilize all surgical material. Use an autoclaving temperature of 120-135 °C for 20-30 min of sterilization time.\nPurchase C57BL/6 mice or mice from another strain which are between 19-35 g of body weight. Follow the appropriate animal care and experimental protocols in accordance with national guidelines that is approved by the investigator's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Allow a minimum of 7 days acclimatization period before starting the procedure.\nProvide analgesia to all mice via the drinking water one day before surgery until the third postoperative day.\n2. Surgical Procedure and Application of the External Fixator\nPlace the mouse into a tube preloaded with 5-7% isoflurane and 60 mL/min oxygen. After loss of postural reflexes, remove the mouse from the anesthesia induction tube and maintain the anesthesia via an inhalation mask providing 1-3% isoflurane and 60 mL/min oxygen.\n\t\nMonitor the breathing pattern and hind paw reflex during anesthesia. Ensure that the breathing rate is around 100 cycles/min and the hind paw reflex is absent.\n\t\t​NOTE: The amount of gas needed is dependent on age, sex, body weight, and strain of the mouse.\nPrior to surgery, inject the mouse with a single dose of antibiotics subcutaneously (clindamycin, 45 mg/kg). Furthermore, for maintenance of the physiological fluid balance, inject the mouse with a subcutaneous fluid depot of 500 µL saline (0.9% NaCl).",
    "To prevent corneal drying, apply eye ointment to the mouse eyes. Place the mouse on a heating plate at 37 °C during the anesthesia and surgical procedure to maintain physiological body temperature.\nRemove the fur from the right hind limb and scrub the surgical area with an alcohol-based disinfectant. Cover the right hind paw with a small part of a sterile glove to avoid unsterile areas. Disinfect the right hind limb three times. Place a sterile drape over the whole mouse except for the surgical area.\nIncise the skin approximately 1 cm longitudinally along the anterior side of the right femur with a scalpel. Separate bluntly the m. biceps femoris and the m. vastus lateralis with micro scissor and forceps. Cut the tendon origin side at the femur trochanter with a micro scissor to allow free access to the anterolateral part of the bone. Make sure that the sciatic nerve is preserved.\nPosition the external fixator (axial stiffness of 3 N/mm, Figure 1A) parallel to the femur. Manually drill the boreholes through cortex with a 0.45-mm drill bit and place the ceramic mounting pins into the boreholes. Start with the most proximal pin, followed by the most distal pin, and the two pins in between.\n\t\nMake sure that there is no tension, compression, or shear stress on the fixator during the mounting procedure, otherwise the achieved osteotomy gap will not be sufficient due to relaxation of the fixator.\nHumidify the bone with a small amount of sterile NaCl to avoid dehydration during the sawing procedure.\nCreate a 0.4-mm osteotomy through the whole bone between the two inner pins by using a 0.4 mm gigli wire saw.",
    "NOTE: Optionally, an oscillating micro saw can be used to create the osteotomy. Make sure to avoid any metal chips from the saw at the osteotomy area.\nFlush the osteotomy gap carefully with 2 mL of sterile NaCl to remove bone chips between the two fractured cortices.\nAdapt the muscles by using a continuous suture with a resorbable suture (see Table of Materials). Then adapt the skin by using interrupted non-resorbable sutures (see Table of Materials). To avoid wound biting, do not place the suture at the cranial part of the wound.\n\tNOTE: Do not use skin glue or clips since mice usually remove it from the wound causing further damage to the skin.\nClean the surgical area with a disinfectant and place the mouse into its cage. Monitor the mouse and supply sufficient heat (e.g. by infrared light) until it is fully awake. Monitor water, food intake, and body weight after the surgery to make sure the animal is not in pain and distress. Provide analgesia to all mice via the drinking water until the third postoperative day.\n\tNOTE: Mice may be housed in groups of up to four animals.\nMonitor the mouse's activity on days 1 to 5 after surgery. During that time course, the mouse should bear weight on the operated limb. Otherwise, the mouse must be excluded from further analysis.\n3. MRI Procedure and Image Analysis\nPrior to the MRI scanning procedure, anaesthetize the mouse according to the protocol in steps 2.1 and 2.3, and keep the respiratory rate around 100 cycles/min. Insert the external fixator at the right hind limb of the mouse carefully into a custom-made mounting device (Figure 1B, C).\n\t\nMake sure to avoid bending or compression of the fixator during this step since this may interfere with fracture healing.",
    "Note: The MRI scans can be conducted as early as 3 days after surgery, depending on the animal care and experimental protocol.\nPlace the mouse on a temperature controlled cradle for introduction into the MRI device. Attach the mounting device rigidly to the four-element head coil.\nAcquire MRI data using a dedicated high-field small-animal MRI system operating at 11.7 T.\n\t​NOTE: The MRI data acquisition geometry is aligned with the femur bone, orthogonally to the screws.\n\t\nAcquire data by applying a proton-density fat-suppressed multi-slice TSE sequence (PD-TSE) using acquisition parameters: echo/repetition time TE = 5.8 ms/TR = 2,500 ms, resolution Δr = 52 × 52 × 350 µm³, field-of-view (FOV) = 20 × 20 mm², and bandwidth Δω= 150 KHz.\nNOTE: The total acquisition time for 22 slices is 36 min.\nOpen the acquired data with image analysis software. Enter the voxel size as 0.05 x 0.05 x 0.35 mm3. Segment the different tissues in the fracture callus (bone, cartilage, fibrous tissue/bone marrow) based on their intensity with semi-automatic thresholding as follows.\n\t\nClick the \"Edit New Label Field\", click \"Add Material\", and rename the material to \"callus\". Distinguish the callus area from the surrounding tissues based on the hypo-intense signal from the periosteum using the \"Lasso\" tool.\nClick \"add to material\". Click \"Add Material\" and rename the material to \"cartilage\". Segment the cartilage by using the \"threshold\" tool and \"Select only current material\" from \"callus\". Click \"cartilage\" and \"add to material\". Repeat these steps with \"bone\" and \"bone marrow/fibrous tissue\".\nGenerate 3D reconstructions of the fractured femurs based on the tissue segmentation data using image analysis software. Click \"Generate Surface\", apply \"None\" for \"Smoothing Type\" and click \"Surface View\".",
    "NOTE: Very small, hyper-intense areas surrounding the ends of the fractured cortices are likely to be artifacts due to the transition from bony to soft tissue. These areas should be excluded from further analysis. Hyper-intense areas in the middle of the fracture callus during the endochondral phase of fracture healing represent cartilaginous tissue. Hypo-intense areas at the fracture callus distal from the osteotomy gap at the endochondral ossification phase and areas with the same intensity throughout the whole fracture callus at later healing stages represent newly formed bony callus tissue. Although these areas have a hypo-intense signal, the signal intensity from mature bone (cortex) is even lower. After thresholding the signal intensity for bony tissue and cartilaginous tissue in the fracture callus, mark the remaining tissue as bone marrow and fibrous tissue. Values for tissue segmentation are: bony tissue (including mature cortex, trabecular bone, and bony callus tissue) is segmented within the range of 1-3.3 (normalized signal intensity to mature cortex), bone marrow/fibrous tissue within the range of 3.4-5.4, and cartilaginous callus tissue within the range of 5.5-6.2.\nIf needed, repeat the MRI scan longitudinally during the fracture healing process. To monitor cartilaginous callus development, scan the mice on days 10, 14, and 21 after surgery.\n\tNOTE: The time points may depend on the animal care and experimental protocol.\nSubscription Required.
