    "All procedures described in this protocol were approved by the Radboud university medical center Institutional Review Board (file no. 2016-3074).\n1. Preliminary research\nFocus groups to assess unmet needs in dyspepsia management\n\t\nCreate a structure for a focus group with dyspeptic patients and with general practitioners.\nConduct a focus group. Keep conducting additional focus groups until saturation of information is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: For this study two focus groups were conducted.\n\t\t\nRecruit participants from patient organization platforms and the gastroenterology outpatient clinic.\nRecruit general practitioners through local general practitioner networks.\nProvide all participants with a patient information form, explaining the concept and goal of the focus group. Do not present the questions of the focus group in the information form.\nObtain written informed consent from all participants.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Informed consent was obtained from all participants in this study.\nConduct the focus groups with two researchers. Appoint a moderator and an observer. As a moderator, emphasize that there are no wrong answers, ensure all participants have the opportunity to express their views, and monitor the time. As an observer, observe and take notes of the group dynamics and body language of participants.\nStart the recording of the session using a voice recorder.\nPresent each question to the group and encourage discussion about varying views. Ask the following questions; 'Could you describe the symptoms you feel?', 'How do the symptoms influence your day-to-day life?', 'What measures have you taken yourself to relieve your symptoms?', 'Where did you get most information about your disease?', and 'Which elements lacked in the management of your disease?'.\nTranscribe the voice recording. Process the focus groups and interviews using the qualitative data analysis software (e.g., ATLAS.ti version 8.3.16).",
    "Highlight and connect topics and views that overlap. Use the observer notes for interpretation of discussion and opposite views of participants.\nExtract the main themes resulting from the focus group to form the structure of the tool.\nExisting scientific evidence\n\t\nBased on the main outlines that resulted from assessment of needs, make an overview of the topics that should be supported by literature. Examples are pathophysiology of dyspepsia, dietary interventions, pharmacological treatment, and (the value of) diagnostics.\nUse the online databases Medline and EMBASE to search for recent literature. To build a search, MeSH terms (Medline) or Emtree terms (EMBASE) should be combined with free text words.\nSelect the most relevant articles to use as scientific background in the tool.\nFind local and national guidelines related to dyspepsia management. Make a selection of recommendations most relevant to the target audience.\nSummarize existing national patient information on dyspepsia. Use approved primary and secondary care information, as well as government supported web-based information.\n2. Content development\nSoftware development partner\n\t\nSelect a partner for software production to involve in the development. Make a selection based on available products, such as 3D visualization, video recording, user friendly content management system, and possibilities to do adjustments after pilot test.\n\t\t​NOTE: For this study, Medify Media B.V. was contracted for software development.\nOrganization of data\n\t\nCombine all collected data in one file and merge related topics. Create a clear overview of all items that should be addressed in the tool.\nCategorize the information into manageable chapters.\nOrganize the items into a logical flow that will be maintained in the tool, for example by drawing up a flowchart illustrating the flow and content of each chapter and interconnection between chapters.\nOrganize the chapters in a nonlinear structure, allowing completion of chapters in random order.\nProcess session",
    "Organize a process session with all stakeholders, including involved researchers, doctors, software developers, and visual designers.\nWithin the process session, identify all elements that can be visualized through real-life videos or animation or should appear as text.\nCreation of content\n\t\nStart every chapter with an overview of the chapter, introduce important items and terms.\nAt the end of every chapter, give a chapter summary. Refrain from giving redundant information that may distract attention.\nHighlight essential information using bullet points and/or bold text.\nUse plain language writing when writing texts.\n\t\t\nClearly consider the target audience and write from that perspective.\nMaintain a 7th to 8th grade reading level.\nUse active rather than passive sentences, writing in a conversational style, including the frequent use of questions and personal pronouns (e.g., 'do you regularly feel full after a normal sized meal? Try to avoid fatty foods.', rather than 'if a full feeling after a normal sized meal is regularly encountered, avoiding fatty foods may be tried.').\nLimit the amount of text per paragraph to a maximum of 10 sentences.\nFor the videos:\n\t\t\nMake a list of people needed for the real-life videos (e.g., patients, doctors, dieticians).\nWrite detailed scripts and log files for all videos.\nSelect an entourage for shooting of the videos, appropriate to the subject of the video, and with reduced noise level.\nFor 3D visualization of elements of the content:\n\t\t\nUse visual references for each step of the desired 3D animation.\nSplit animations into clips of 8−12 s. Before and after a clip, provide text blocks with information about the clip.\n3. Building the digital educational tool\nAdd all the content to a content management system to adjust the order and appearance.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the Medify B.V. content management system was used.",
    "Add all the text and the videos to panels. Choose a background image or a 3D visualization. Add customized questionnaires.\nCheck whether everything is correctly incorporated in the tool.\nWhen all content is built into the content management system, create a pilot version of the educational tool.\n4. User experience and validation\nAdminister the pilot educational tool to two patients and two general practitioners and ask for feedback on lay-out, content, and user friendliness.\nAdjust the tool based on the test comments.\nValidate the efficacy and usability of the educational tool in a randomized controlled trial.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
