    "The present study was approved by the ethics committee of Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University (B2016-142R) and all participants gave their informed consent.\n1. Diagnosis of the Aortic Anomaly by Symptoms and Acquisition of Imaging Data\nIdentify patients who have symptoms such as chest pain, dysphagia, or a blood pressure difference of the upper limbs in out-patient clinic. Exclude patients who may be intolerant of the operation.\nPerform CT angiography in these patients to diagnose Kommerell’s diverticulum8.\n2. Segmentation of Regions of Interest\nImport all the CT angiography images into the software in a DICOM format. The resolution of these images was 512 × 512 pixels, and the slice thickness was 1 mm.\n\t\nDouble click the patient case from case library and open it.\nSelect the DICOM series and click Model Recon to open the model recon page.\nHave an engineer and a team of cardiac surgeons review the DICOM formatted raw data to identify key anatomic features and region of interest (ROI).\nUse gray value-based thresholding to segment the ROI.\n\t\nClick the Threshold Segmentation button and adjust the threshold range for the vascular mask. The default range is between 226 to 3071.\nClick the Confirm button for threshold segmentation and the vascular mask will show in the object list. Click the Recon button from the right of the mask and the 3-D vascular mask will be reconstructed and shown in 3-D viewer.\nClick the Threshold Segmentation button and adjust the threshold range for the trachea mask. Click the Marquee Segmentation button to limit the region of interest to the mediastinum and the lung. The default range is between -1024 to -520.\nClick the Mask Edit button and erase the connection between the trachea and the lung.",
    "Click the Region Grow button and select a seed by clicking any point/pixel at the mask in any one of the 2-D viewers. Check and confirm that the region grows as result, and that the trachea mask will show in the object list.\nClick the Recon button on the right of the mask, and the 3-D trachea will be reconstructed in the 3-D viewer.\nSave the ROI as masks for 3-D reconstruction.\n3. 3-D Reconstruction of the ROI\nAdopt the gray value interpolation algorithm to calculate the surface mesh of the 3-D model. Make the surface a triangle to match the outmost voxels of the mask.\nClick the Export button to export the 3-D model as an STL file.\nPlace the model on the center of the building platform. Orient the model by aligning the tangent of the vessel centerline at its extremity to be parallel to the Z axis of the building platform. Supports were automatically generated to the overhangs using the default parameters.\nClick the Slice | Save to save as a file ready for 3-D printing.\n4. 3-D Printing\nPerform stereolithographic printing with a 3-D printer. Use the following parameters: a slice distance of 1 mm, a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, a building layer thickness of 0.1 mm, and a laser spot diameter of 80 μm.\nUse ultraviolet light at 405 nm to harden the photosensitive resin by scanning the contours sliced by the software. The ultraviolet light laser speed is 3 m/s.",
    "NOTE: When one slice of the digital 3-D model was built, the building platform went up 0.1 mm for the next slice. The physical model was built layer by layer. The next layer was formed on top of the previous layer. The 3-D physical model was built layer by layer in this way.\n5. Preoperative Planning and Intraoperative Review Using 3-D Printed Models\nBefore the surgery, have surgeons make detailed and accurate surgical plans for each patient by learning the 3-D printed models.\nDuring the surgery, place the 3-D printed models in the operation room and have a nurse hold them. The anatomic details were reviewed by surgeons during the vascular location and separation.\n\tNOTE: The surgical treatment included resection of diverticulum and reconstruction of aortic branches. The impregnated woven polyester tube graft was applied to replace the resected aorta1,2,3,9. All patients were sent to cardiac surgery intensive care unit after surgery.\nSubscription Required.
