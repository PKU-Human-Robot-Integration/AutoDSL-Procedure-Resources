IM, intramuscular.\n(B) Dose-dependent muscle-paralyzing activity of BoNTA proteins.\n(C) The therapeutic index of BoNTA proteins.\nDetermine the half intramuscular effective dose (IMED50) (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] and 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B).\nCalculate the intramuscular therapeutic index by dividing IMLD50 by IMED50 (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C).\nImmunofluorescence analysis of treated gastrocnemius muscle\nTiming: 3 days (for step 30)\nIn this step, the mice injected with CPP-BoNTA in the previous experiment will be sacrificed and the gastrocnemius muscle tissue is collected and immunofluorescence stained for evaluation of the cell-penetrating activity of CPP-BoNTA in vivo.\nSample Preparation.\nSection fresh gastrocnemius muscles into small pieces.\nFix immediately with 4% paraformaldehyde at 25°C for 10 min.\nDehydrate for 12–16 h in 30% sucrose.\nDry the tissue blocks with paper towels.\nPlace the tissue blocks on tissue molds.\nIncubate the tissue blocks with 100% optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) over a total period of 4 h at −80°C.\nFrozen-section OCT-embedded gastrocnemius muscles serially at 10 μm interval along the transverse and longitudinal direction.\nBlocking step.\nBlock non-specific binding site with PBS supplemented with 5% BSA at 25°C for 1 h.\nWash the sections 5 times with PBS for 5 min each time.\nPrimary antibody incubation.\nIncubate the slices with goat anti-FLAG antibody and anti-SV2A antibodies which are diluted 200-fold in PBS supplemented with 0.2% BSA at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nWash the slices 3 times with PBS supplemented with 0.2% BSA.\nWash the slices 3 times with PBS.\nWash the slices 3 times with PBS supplemented with 0.2% BSA.",
    "Secondary antibody incubation.\nIncubate with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody which is diluted 1000-fold in PBS supplemented with 0.2% BSA for 1 h at 25°C in dark.\nWash the slices 3 times with PBS supplemented with 0.2% BSA.\nWash the slices 3 times with PBS.\nWash the slices 3 times with PBS supplemented with 0.2% BSA.\nNote: From this point on, the slices need to be kept in the dark.\nNucleus Staining.\nIncubate with Hoechst 33342 which is diluted 5,000-fold in PBS for 10 min at 25°C in the dark.\nWash the slices 3 times with PBS.\nMounting.\nPrepare microscope slides and add the coverslips on microscope slides with Prolong gold antifade reagent.\nCoat the edges of the coverslip with a thin layer of clear nail polish and leave to dry in the dark for 12–16 h.\nStore at 4°C for long-term use.\nPause point: The slides can be stored at 4°C for up to three months but prolonged storage may affect imaging resolution.\nConfocal microscopy imaging.\nPrepare microscope slides and add the coverslips on microscope slides with Prolong gold antifade reagent.\nVisualize the samples on a LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany), with the excitation/emission filters for red and green channels to be 493 nm/598 nm and 410 nm/507 nm respectively.\nMeasure the fluorescence intensity in each cell by ZEN 2011 imaging software (Zeiss) (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2356-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11.
