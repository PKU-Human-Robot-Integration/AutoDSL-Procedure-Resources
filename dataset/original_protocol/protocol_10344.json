    "All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with US Animal Welfare Act and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Minnesota.\n1. Method for Mouse Heart Isolation\nEuthanize a neonatal mouse by decapitation with a single use blade.\nSwab the thorax with 70% ethanol.\nDissect the skin from the chest by cutting it away from the chest wall with standard scissors while pulling the skin laterally with a pair of #5 forceps.\nPerforate the abdomen just inferior to the sternum with the scissors by cutting through the abdominal wall. Grasping the xiphoid process with #5 forceps, retract the sternum rostrally from the body while cutting though the ribs on either side of the chest with the scissors. The rib cage is reflected superiorly with the forceps to reveal the heart.\nBluntly dissect the two main lobes of the thymus by pulling laterally with #5 forceps, exposing the arch of the aorta, as well as the caval and pulmonary veins.\nTransect the major arteries from the aortic arch, and the aorta itself, with the 10 cm spring scissors. Retain the aorta between the base of the heart and the brachiocephalic artery. Grasp the ends of the severed vessels with the #5 forceps to reflect the heart forward, separating it from the trachea and esophagus.\nTransect the pulmonary vasculature and other major veins, by cutting between the lungs and the heart on both sides of the heart with the 10 cm spring scissors. The veins remain open to provide drainage.\nRemove the heart from the mediastinum with the #5 forceps, grasping the severed ends of the major vessels. Place the heart in a 60 mm culture dish containing sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for catheterization.\n2. Method for Decellularization by Langendorff Perfusion",
    "Prepare the catheter assembly in advance. Draw a 4 cm section of PE 50 tubing in a small alcohol flame to create a smaller, thinner catheter. Trim the ends with a blade to meet the dimensions (Approx. 300 µm outside diameter O.D. with a flange of approx. 500 µm O.D.) shown in Figure 1. This will provide two symmetrical catheters from each side of the pull.\nPoint the cut end of the tubing into the flame briefly, to melt a flange onto the opening at the thin end.\nFill the 12 ml syringe with PBS and assemble the catheter by placing a 3-way stopcock on the syringe. Add a 22 G x 1 needle to the stopcock and drive the needle through the septum. Slide the drawn PE tubing catheter onto the needle (Fig. 1).\nIrrigate the assembled parts with PBS, assuring that all air bubbles have been removed.\nInsert the catheter, prepared as outlined above, into the aorta of the isolated heart, not extending past the aortic valve and ligate with one tie of 7-0 suture. Rest the flange of the catheter proximally against the tie, making a tight seal and preventing the heart from coming off the catheter.\nObserve the catheterization under magnification, while gently perfusing the heart using the syringe containing PBS. Ensure that there are no leaks in the system and the tissue homogeneously blanches as latent blood is removed.\nPlace the septum into the neck of the inlet adaptor and seal it by folding the sides over the glass.",
    "Attach the reservoir filled with 60 ml of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in distilled water (dH2O) via a line of sufficient length to produce a column that generates 20 mm Hg pressure as shown in Fig. 1. Calculate the pressure from the liquid column height based on the relationship of 1 mm Hg is equal to 1.3595 cm H2O.\n\tCaution: SDS is a highly flocculent powder with irritant properties. Contact should be avoided. Handle the powder using appropriate protective clothing.\nPerfuse the heart with 1% SDS for 14 hr. The heart will be translucent in appearance with no observable remaining tissue.\nFlush the system up to the stopcock of the remaining SDS solution and replace it with 10 ml dH2O. Perfuse the heart with 10 ml 1% Triton X-100 (diluted in distilled water), followed by 10 ml dH2O, followed by 60 ml PBS containing 1x penicillin streptomycin (Pen-Strep).\nStore the heart in PBS with 1x Pen-Strep at 4 °C. If the intended post decellularization application requires perfusion then the catheter in the aorta should be maintained, otherwise cut the suture tie and remove the catheter.\n3. DNA Determination\nPrepare a digest of the decellularized ECM or control heart using 200 μg/ml proteinase K in 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.45% Tween 20 in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.3).\nIncubate the tissue at 55 °C with agitation until the tissue is dissolved, typically 4-5 hr.\nQuantitate the DNA content of the homogenate with a DNA binding assay4,11.\n4. Fixation and Sectioning of Tissue\nFix decellularized, recellularized or control P3 hearts in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash the tissue in PBS 3x.\nPlace the tissue in a solution of 7.5% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4 °C until it sinks.",
    "Change the solution to 15% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4 °C, again, until it sinks.\nWarm the tissue to 37 °C, replace half of the volume with gelatin solution in 15% sucrose & 0.1 M phosphate buffer and equilibrate overnight. Concentrations of gelatin are increased stepwise through 1%, 2.5%, 5% and finally 7.5% twice.\nPlace the samples in cryomolds using fresh 7.5% gelatin. To restore the shape of the decellularized samples, liquid gelatin can be perfused into the chambers as the hearts are molded. Freeze by floating the cryomolds on liquid nitrogen. Store at -80 °C.\nCut (10 µm thick) sections with a cryostat. Bring the slide close to the section surface and observe the section move off from the knife onto the surface due to the charge on the electrostatically treated slides. Dry the slides overnight and store at -80 °C for future analysis.\nRemove the slides from the freezer, equilibrate to room temperature and then place in a Coplin jar containing PBS for 20 min at 37 °C to dissolve the gelatin.\nStain the cut sections from Step 4.7 with Hematoxylin and Eosin. Place slides in a Coplin jar. Expose the slides hydrated in Step 4.8 to Hematoxylin for 45 sec, tap water for 1.5 min, buffer for 3 min, tap water for 1 min, bluing agent for 1.5 min, 80% ethanol for 1 min, Alcoholic Eosin Y for 8 sec, 80% ethanol for 1 min, 100% ethanol for 1 min 2x, clearing agent (xylene substitute) for 1 min 3x, coverslip with resin based mounting medium. Examine the slides microscopically.",
    "To confirm the retention of ECM protein reactivity of the heart ECM, stain for ECM structural proteins such as collagen IV by placing the hydrated slides in a humidified chamber and treat with 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) in phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% Triton-X100 (PBST) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). Use a sufficient volume to cover the tissue sections.\nReplace the solution with the primary antibody of choice at an empirically determined dilution in 5% NDS / PBST. For example, the Collagen IV antibody was diluted at 1:150. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the slides with PBST 3x and apply a secondary antibody of choice conjugated with a fluorescent dye. Dilute the antibody by an empirically determined amount. Incubate for 1 hr at RT. Wash with PBS 3x.\nStain the slides with a DNA binding dye such as DAPI to verify absence of cell nuclei by using a DAPI containing mounting medium when cover slipping the slides.\nExamine the slides with a fluorescent microscope at 50 to 400X.\n5. P1 Neonatal Murine Ventricular Cardiomyocytes for Recellularization\nSpray each pup with 70% ethanol and decapitate with a single use blade.\nHold each pup between the thumb and forefinger while the thorax is split at the midline with small sterile scissors to expose the thoracic cavity. Apply pressure to allow the heart to protrude freely from the chest while it is cut free of the major vessels and the atria leaving only the ventricular tissue.\nPlace each heart directly into a 50 ml tube containing 20 ml ice-cold Calcium, Bicarbonate free Hank's buffered saline solution with 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (CBFHH) until all the hearts are collected.",
    "Aspirate the CBFHH and add 10-15 ml of fresh CBFHH (ice-cold) to the tube. Wash the tissue by swirling the tissue in the tube several times.\nDecant the solution containing the hearts into a 60 mm plastic Petri dish.\nDissect any latent atrial tissue from the hearts under magnification on ice by trimming it away from the hearts with the spring scissors. Mince up the ventricles into homogenously sized small pieces. Remove any separated non-ventricular tissue from the dish with #5 forceps.\nPipet as much of the CBFHH solution as is needed to transfer the tissue fragments into a small sterile vial that contains a sterile micro stir bar.\nAllow the tissue to sediment to the bottom of the vial and remove the CBFHH solution.\nMake up 50 ml of an enzyme solution 1.75 mg/ml trypsin, 20 µg/ml DNase II in CBFHH. Pipet 5 ml of this enzyme solution and add it to a tube containing minced ventricular tissue and place on a magnetic stirrer. Stir at a constant rate (340 rpm) at room temperature for 8 min.\n\tNOTE: The stirring action should be gentle and yet allow for the suspension of the slurry.\nRemove the vial from the stir plate and allow the slurry to sediment for 3 min. Pipet and discard the initial digest supernatant, as it primarily contains blood cells and tissue debris.\nPipet a second 5 ml aliquot of the enzyme solution and add it to the digesting ventricle. Stir for 8 min and allow it to sediment for another 3 min. Prior to beginning the digests, prepare two 50 ml tubes (labeled 1 and 2) each containing 12 ml ice-cold fetal bovine serum (FBS). Place a 40 µm cell strainer atop each tube. Pipet this supernatant through the filter on tube 1.",
    "Repeat the digestion process an additional 8 times, alternating the placement of the digest supernatant between the two tubes containing FBS. Split the last supernatant equally between tubes 1 and 2 to ensure equal volumes in each tube.\n\tNOTE: Each collection tube will now contain 32.5 ml total volume of cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the tubes containing the supernatant 150 x g for 6 min at 4 °C.\nWhile collecting the digestion aliquots, prepare five 100 mm tissue culture plates with 6 ml of media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) with 10% FBS, 1x Pen-Strep, 1x L-glutamine) per plate. Incubate these aliquots at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min to equilibrate the media.\nAspirate the CBFHH enzyme mixture and resuspend the cells into the 30 ml of culture media prepared above, combining the cells from both collection tubes.\nReturn 6 ml of cell suspension to each of the 100 mm plates and incubate for 45 min at 37 °C.\nAt the end of the incubation, transfer the non-adherent cells to 5 new dishes and re-incubate for 45 min (the fibroblast fraction will have begun to adhere to the dishes and can be grown out separately if desired).\nAt the end of the second round of pre-plating, collect the media and non-adherent cells from the dishes and spin the media at 150 x g for 6 min.\nDraw off excess media to bring the cells to the approximate desired concentration, (4.0 x 105 cells per construct in 100 µl of perfusate). Remove an aliquot for counting and or viability testing14.\n6. Bioreactor Recellularization of P3 Heart Matrix\nPretreat the isolated heart matrix with culture media (see Step 5.15) overnight before adding the cells.",
    "Assemble the elements of a Langendorff system as shown in Fig. 2. Autoclave the glass parts and ethylene oxide sterilize the plastic parts to assure sterility. Various sub units of the system can be assembled in a laminar flow hood before being mounted on the support stand. Circulating water bath and heated water flow path has been omitted for clarity.\nFill the assembled system with 120 ml of tissue culture media (see Step 5.15).\nPlace the catheterized heart matrix from Step 2.14 in a 60 mm culture dish under magnification and connect a 1 ml syringe with 22 G x 1 needle loaded with cell suspension from Step 5.20 to the catheter. Ensure that this assembly is free of air bubbles to avoid embolizing the heart.\nGently perfuse the 100 µl of cell suspension into the heart matrix via the coronary arteries. Once complete, detach the syringe/needle combination.\n\tNOTE: A slow perfusion of approx. 20 µl per min is required to prevent the cells from flowing out of the veins, transiting the heart.\nWith a 22g blunt stub secured to the Luer fitting on the underside of the bioreactor heart jar lid, push the catheter onto the stub.\nStart the peristaltic pump and observe that the flow proceeds as outlined in Figure 2. Flow proceeds from the reservoir via the pump through the bubble trap to the catheter placed in the aorta in Step 2.5 (red path in Fig. 2). Observe the flow of the cardiac circulation out of the veins and drip from the apex, recirculating to the media reservoir.",
    "NOTE: The perfusion flow rate is dependent on individual factors such as the vascular resistance of the construct, and the size of the heart, but a rate of 50 to 100 µl/min is a good starting point. At intermediate time points, functional assessments can be executed. The size scale of the neonatal recellularized heart limits the assessments, that can be performed but we have determined that optically based systems can be used to quantify beating behavior just as they have been used in adult rat hearts.4 The construct can be perfused for extended periods of time (up to 23 hr).\nSubscription Required.
