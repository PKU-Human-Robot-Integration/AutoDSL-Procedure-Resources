    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPoly-l-lysine cell attachment\nTiming: 3–4 h\nPoly-l-lysine coating of the cell culture surface.\nNote: To perform time-lapse experiments, the cells must be plated on Poly-l-lysine coated 24-multiwell, while the electrophysiology experiments are done in Poly-l-lysine coated coverslips.\nDilute the poly-l-lysine in sterile water from the stock solution (0.1 mg/mL) to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL.\nAdd the appropriate amount of diluted poly-l-lysine to the culture surface; typically 1 mL per 25 cm2 is required in sterile conditions (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7]).\nCover and incubate at 37°C for 1–2 h.\nRemove the solution by aspiration and thoroughly rinse the surface with sterile water.\nCover and allow to dry at RT for at least 1 h.\nDissection and papain digestion\nTiming: 2 h (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9])\nSacrifice the P0 mice in accordance with current regulatory guidelines and using protocols approved by the institution. Euthanize the mouse pup by decapitation, separate the head from the body and wipe the head of the pup with 70% ethanol.\nPlace the embryo’s head in a 60 mm Petri dish with cold Neurobasal (NB) medium and hold the head with 13 cm stainless forceps to clearly see the back of the skull. Insert the microdissection scissors into the foramen magnum and cut straight toward the eyes. Using curved forceps, gently peel away the skin of the head and lift the skull to expose the brain.\nCritical: Take care to not cut through the brain tissue when removing the skull bone.\nPinch off the cerebellum and transfer it to the 35 mm Petri dish with EBSS medium. Under the dissecting microscope, gently remove the meninges from the cerebellum with one 30G syringe needle while using the other needle to fix the cerebellum to the dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1190-Fig1.jpg",

Preparation of the P0 cerebellum\n(A) P0 mouse brain after extraction.\n(B) View of the isolated P0 cerebellum.\n(C) P0 cerebellum after removal of the meninges.\n(D) Cerebellum after mechanical dissociation into pieces of approximately 1 mm.\n(E) Bright field image showing the general aspect of the cell culture.\n(F) Identification of the neural progeny by immunocytochemistry. Scale bar (A–D: 5 mm) (E and F: 30 μm)\nNote: The meninges can be easily identified by observing the blood vessels on the surface of the cerebellum. Remove the meninges until the cerebellum appears to be completely white.\nOnce the dissection has been completed, carefully remove all the EBSS medium with a Pasteur pipette and leave only the tissue.\nAdd the papain solution (vial 2, prepared previously) to the dish and chop up the tissue with a surgical blade (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]).\nIncubate for 45 min at 37°C in 5% CO2 in sterile conditions.\nTransfer the pieces of cerebellum to a 15 mL conical tube with a siliconized Pasteur pipette. Mechanically dissociate the tissue by pipetting up and down until the lysate is homogeneous. About 15 up and down strokes with the pipette should be sufficient to dissociate the tissue, producing a cloudy solution (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]).\nCritical: Avoid making bubbles and the formation of any froth.\nCentrifuge at 200 ×g for 5 min at RT.\nDuring centrifugation, prepare the re-suspension medium by mixing 2.7 mL EBSS + 300 μL reconstituted albumin-ovomucoid inhibitor (vial 4) + 150 μL of DNase solution (vial 3) + 30 μL APV (5 mM) in a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "After centrifugation, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in the solution prepared in the previous step using a siliconized Pasteur pipette. Resuspend the pellet by gently pipetting up and down with a siliconized Pasteur pipette.\nPrepare a discontinuous density gradient by carefully layering the resuspended cell suspension on top of albumin-ovomucoid inhibitor (vial 4). The boundary between the two layers of the gradient should be clearly visible.\nCentrifuge at 200 ×g for 5 min at RT, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of NB medium.\nCount the number of viable cells by mixing 50 μL of Trypan blue + 40 μL of NB medium + 10 μL of cell suspension in a tube and put 10 μL of this mix into a hemocytometer (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nPlate the cells at low density (50,000 cells/cm2) in NB medium supplemented with 2% B27, 100 U/mL penicilin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, amphotericin 0.25 μg/mL and l-glutamine 0.5 mM in adherent 24 multiwell cell culture plates (for time-lapse imaging) or coverslips (for electrophysiology recordings) (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9]).\nLive time-lapse video-microscopy imaging\nTiming: 4–5 days\nPower up the computer, CO2 and temperature control systems, the microscope and the hardware.\nAdjust the temperature to 37°C and the CO2 to 5%.\nWait 1–2 h for the CO2 and temperature levels to stabilize.\nMake a small mark on the bottom of a well that does not contain cells.\nNote: This mark will be used to set the xyz coordinates.\nPlace the culture plate in the microscope chamber.\nCritical: Tightly fix the plate to the microscope to prevent any movement during the video-microscopy experiment.\nWait 20 min until the temperature of the cell culture medium has equilibrated in the chamber.",
    "Note: This step will avoid any loss of focus due to the dilation of any component.\nRun the software and set up the time-lapse experiment.\nSelect the length of the experiment and the image acquisition cycles. We use cycles of 5 min and the experiments typically last 4 or 5 days.\nNote: The temporal resolution improves if higher image cycle frequencies are used and the experiment can be finished before the final cycle.\nCritical: Determine the frequency necessary to avoid the cell death potentially produced by phototoxicity of the transmitted light.\nSearch for the mark made previously in the plate and define it as the reference point, (position 1, equivalent to xyz zero coordinates).\nCritical: Take a photo of the zero position to be able to reset the coordinates if necessary.\nSelect the rest of the positions (x and y coordinates) and adjust the focus (z coordinate) for each position.\nChoose the type of acquisition and the exposure time in the “wavelength selection tab menu”. In our experiments we only select brightfield with an exposure time of 10–50 ms.\nCritical: To avoid the toxicity induced by light exposure, the shutters for the transmitted light and epifluorescence must be closed between cycles and positions.\nName the experiment and the folder where the data will be stored to be able to reload the experiment at your convenience, save the list of positions.\nClick on the “run now” button to start the experiment.",
    "Pause the experiment once a day to re-adjust the focus conditions by employing the “overwrite z button” (if it is necessary). If the medium needs to be changed, pause the experiment and take the plate out of the chamber. Change the medium under sterile conditions and put the plate back into the chamber (see step 21). Finally, re-adjust the focus and continue with the experiment.\nNote: We recommend maintaining the plates at constant temperature to avoid changes in focus during the experiment. Alterations to the pH of the medium caused by over-proliferation or cell death might also affect the focus.\nPost-imaging immunocytochemistry\nTiming: 2 days\nAfter finishing the experiment, click the “finish” button and remove the plate to perform post-imaging immunocytochemistry (PIIC).\nRemove the medium from the wells and add 500 μL of sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to wash the cells. Repeat this step twice.\nAdd 500 μL of 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and fix the cells at RT for 10 min.\nCritical: Handle the PFA carefully and avoid contact with the eyes or skin as PFA is a strong fixative. PFA should be used inside a fume hood.\nWash the cells 3 times with 500 μL of sterile PBS.\nAdd 500 μL per well of the blocking solution: PBS containing 2% (wt/vol) BSA and 0.2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100. Incubate for 1 h at RT.\nRemove the blocking solution, add 200–400 μL of the primary antibody solution and incubate 18 h at 4°C. The primary antibody solution contains the primary antibodies used in this experiment diluted in blocking solution: GFAP (1:200), βIII-tubulin (1:800), SOX2 (1:100), VGLUT1 (1:500) and VGAT (1:100).\nRemove the antibody solution and wash the wells 3 times with PBS (5 min each).",
    "Add 200–400 μL of the secondary antibody solution prepared by diluting the secondary antibodies in the blocking solution and incubate for 1–2 h at RT in the dark: Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) 594 (1:500), Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) 488 (1:500), Anti-Mouse IgG2b 488 (1:1000), Anti-Mouse IgG1 (1:500).\nWash three times with 200–400 μL of PBS (5 min each).\nNote: To amplify the VGAT signal it is necessary to use the biotin-streptavidin amplification system. Incubate for 1–2 h at RT in the dark with the diluted biotin Anti-Mouse (1:500) secondary antibody, then perform step 39 and incubate for 1 h at RT in the dark with Streptavidin 594 (1:500) diluted in the blocking solution. Repeat step 39.\nMaintain the cells in 1 mL of PBS prior to performing the next steps.\nNote: we recommend removing the PBS and adding two drops of the aqueous mounting medium Aqua-Poly/Mount to preserve the immunocytochemistry for longer.\nPlace the plate back in the microscope chamber and fix it tightly.\nReload the zero position using the indication made previously and re-set the rest of the positions to this reference point by clicking the “Offset All X, Y, Z” button. Re-set the focal distance (z coordinate).\nNote: Wait around 20 min to allow the temperature of the plate to equilibrate in the chamber, thereby avoiding the appearance of bubbles and a loss of focus.\nTo detect the antigens, configure the conditions for fluorescence emission in the “wavelength tab menu” and obtain a final round of images.\nNote: Adjust the fluorescence exposure to acquire the best quality images.\nSave the data and export using the software’s file/export to Tagged Image File Format (Tiff) option.\nData processing\nTiming: 3–4 days",
    "Rename the image channels (c). For brightfield images change c1 to c0, for FITC images change it to c2, for CY3 images to c3 and CY5 images to c4.\nConvert the images to a PNG format.\nStart the “tTt Converter tool” software, define the input and output folder, and the markers used for each of the channels (c), positions (xy) and time-points (t).\nClick the “convert images\" button.\nNote: Each position of the experiment should be stored in individual folders.\nSingle-cell tracking\nTiming: Approximately 4 h for each position\nOnce the data is renamed, run the tTt software (Hilsenbeck et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), selecting a user name and tTt work folder.\nNote: All the data analyzed and the results exported will be stored in the tTt folder named as tTt export, which will contain the following subfolders: “AVIexport”, “Configs”, “TreeExport”, and “tTtfiles”.\nIn the “select experiment folder window”, choose the experiment and indicate the path of the tTt export folder. Then, click the “Load experiment” button.\nExecute the log file converter to modify the images into a format that can be read by the tracking software.\nNote: This will be automatically requested by the software when you load an experiment for the first time.\nSelect a position, which will be shown as a picture of the position and its corresponding number, and then pick the list of available images that appear on the right side of the window and click the “Load images” button (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1190-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Layout of the single-cell tracking software",
    "(A–C) The images show an overview of the different windows available at the TTT software, including: (A) the general experiment window with a scheme corresponding to the different positions monitored during the experiments; (B) the cell movie window where cells can be tracked; and (C) the cell editor window where the lineage tree is automatically displayed according to the tracking options selected in (B).\nSelect the wavelength 0 that corresponds to the brightfield image and click twice on the position to be tracked in the “Cell Editor Window”, adjusting the contrast and brightness (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPress the F2 key to start tracking.\nNote: In the course of tracking situate the mouse pointer on the cell and press the “0” key. Specific cell events like cell division, apoptosis or cell loss are among the options available in the “Cell Editor Window”. These events will then appear in the lineage tree (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nMatch the brightfield images to the immunofluorescence image in order to define the nature of the cell progeny.\nOnce all the positions are tracked, save the experiment and export the results through the “Export menu” which appears in the “Cell Editor Window”, exporting the cell data and the lineage tree to the tTt export folder.\nWhole-cell patch-clamp recording in cell cultures\nTiming: 6–8 h",
    "Live imaging by time-lapse video microscopy revealed that after completing 3–5 rounds of amplification divisions, some cerebellar cells adopted a neuron-like morphology. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry indicated that cells with a small ovoid soma and bipolar processes express the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), while cells with a polygonal soma and multipolar cytoplasmic processes express the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), indicative of their glutamatergic and GABAergic nature, respectively. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on these cells to investigate the functional phenotype of these morphologically distinct cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1190-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Equipment for electrophysiology recording\n(A) Patch-clamp set-up.\n(B) Patch-clamp amplifier.\n(C) Microscope stage and recording chamber.\n(D) Vertical pipette puller and patch-clamp pipettes.\n(E) The PATCHMASTER program window.\nMake the patch-clamp recording pipettes for the day.\nPull the glass electrodes using a two-step pipette puller having adjusted the settings so that the resistance is about 4 MΩ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPolish the pipette’s tip with a microforge so that the resistance becomes 4.5–5 MΩ.\nMake the drug application pipettes similarly.\nPlace the pipettes in a closed container to prevent the pipette tip from being soiled by airborne dust.\nNote: A good compromise must be reached between the ease of seal formation, membrane-patch rupture and a suitable series resistance during recording (see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.11]).\nThaw an aliquot of the internal solution and keep it on ice, protected from the light.\nPrepare dilutions of the stock drug solutions in the external solution (see steps 10a–d in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”).\nSwitch on all the apparatus and run PATCHMASTER, the software for cell stimulation and electrophysiological data acquisition. Open a “new experiment” in the program’s menu (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3E).\nFeed the gravity-driven perfusion line with external solution and check there are no air bubbles in the line (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "Critical: Since the external solution contains glucose, flush the perfusion line and recording chamber with ddH2O at the end of each recording day to avoid bacterial contamination. If lipophilic compounds are used in the experiments, rinse the pipelines with ethanol before washing them with ddH2O.\nWith straight forceps, transfer a poly-l-lysine coated coverslip loaded with cells to the recording chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nConnect the ground electrode to the head stage of the patch-clamp amplifier and secure the plate in the recording chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nStart perfusion of the external solution at a rate of 1 mL/min and turn on the vacuum aspiration so that the solution can be removed from the recording chamber through an outlet connected to an Erlenmeyer container. Check that the level of liquid in the recording chamber stays above the cell’s plane.\nNote: Experiments are performed at room temperature (24°C–26°C) and there is therefore no need to heat the external solution.\nUse a low power objective (10×) and move the stage of the microscope to situate some cells in the center of the field of view. Under IR-DIC, the cells appear to be bi-refringent with a smooth and clear outline.\nFill a glass-pipette with the external solution containing a drug (see step 58), in accordance with the experimental protocol.\nFirst, dip the pipette tip into a 1 mL Eppendorf tube with the external solution containing the drug for a few seconds such that the solution enters the pipette by capillarity.\nThen, use a needle attached to a 2 mL syringe to backfill the pipette with the same solution.\nRemove any air bubbles from the pipette’s interior by shaking the pipette as if it were an old mercury thermometer.",
    "Fit the drug application pipette to a pipette holder and use a micromanipulator to orientate the pipette towards the recording chamber. Steps 65 and 66 can be repeated 2 or 3 times for other drug application pipettes, depending on the experimental design (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nFill a recording pipette with a filtered internal solution to 60%–75% of capacity, as described for the drug application pipettes, intercalating a 0.22 μm filter between the syringe and the needle.\nInsert the glass-pipette into the electrode holder so that the chlorinated electrode, which is connected through a gold pin to the amplifier head stage, is placed into the internal solution, and secure the pipette in the holder.\nActivate the “SET-UP” mode in the PATCHMASTER and configure the recording conditions:\nSet the amplifier gain to 5 mV/pA\nSet digital oscilloscope gain and time resolution depending on the expected response size\nSet the capacitance cancellation and series resistance compensation to 0\nSet the current filter bandwidth to 2.9 Hz\nSet the test pulse parameters to 5 mV for 5 ms every 30 ms from a holding potential of 0 mV.\nSet the baseline correction to 0.\nNote: Since the electrical circuit is still open (e.g.: there is no electrical continuity between the recording and the ground electrodes), no current is measured.\nUsing a micromanipulator, lower the recording electrode into the bath and visualize the pipette current offset and the current response to test pulses in the oscilloscope screen;djust the current offset to zero in the amplifier.\nNote: The current response to voltage pulses allows the pipette’s resistance to be calculated by applying Ohm’s law: R = V/I (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nMove the pipette tip into the field of view (the pipette can be readily visualized under a 10× objective).",
    "Again, lower the pipette to permit the 10× objective to be exchanged for an objective with a higher magnification (63×) and a shorter working distance (1.5 mm). Focus the plane immediately above the cell of interest and lower the pipette until its tip can be clearly seen. Focus the cell and capture an image of it (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A).\nNote: This image will be used to relate the electrophysiological data to the cell morphology.\nWhile continuously applying test pulses, bring the electrode tip close to the cell and press it up against the cell membrane. Start to apply negative pressure inside the pipette and monitor the reduction in the current amplitude due to the increase in the pipette resistance.\nNote: Negative pressure is applied by suction through a side port of the pipette holder connected to a 10 mL syringe by a silicone tube when the plunger is retracted. Alternatively, negative pressure can be applied by sucking through the tube. Pressure is carefully adjusted for each cell to achieve a more effective reduction of the current amplitude.\nGradually adjust the holding potential to negative values up to −70 mV at ≈3 s intervals (−10 mV, −20 mV, −30 mV, ...), and monitor the formation of a seal with high mechanical and electrical resistance between the pipette tip and the plasma membrane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B; see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1190-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Scheme of the steps needed to achieve whole-cell recording\n(A) Electrode in the bath. In this situation the current is determined solely by the pipette resistance (Rp). Below (in each panel), the voltage (Vp; test pulses) and current (Ip) traces are shown on the left, and the corresponding electrical circuit is depicted on the right. The Rp can be calculated using Ohm’s law (R = V/I).",
    "(B) On-cell. In this configuration, the current is determined by the Rp in series with the access resistance (Ra), which comprises both the patch and seal resistances. Note that as the Ra is very high (GΩ), the current across this resistance is negligible.\n(C) Whole cell. In this configuration, the current is determined by the series resistance (Rs), in series with a parallel circuit of the membrane resistance (Rm) and the membrane capacitance (Cm). The input resistance (Rinput) is the sum of Rs and Rm, and it can be calculated using Ohm’s law (R=V/I). In (B) and (C), the pipette and cell capacitative current transients are canceled.\nNote: Pipette resistance should increase to a minimum of 1 GΩ (“giga-seal”). Depending on the cell, this might occur rapidly after coming into contact with the cell and applying negative pressure, or it may require tens of s of continuous negative pressure at negative potentials in the pipette. The formation of the seal implies a dramatic reduction of the current to values close to 0 pA during the voltage pulse. This indicates that the \"cell-attached\" configuration has been achieved and a patch of membrane is encircled beneath the pipette’s tip\nCancel the pipette capacitive transients that are apparent upon giga-seal formation due to current charging/discharging the pipette’s capacitor.\nNote: To best perform this task, it is advisable to increase the gain of the amplifier and/or the oscilloscope screen. Depending on the amplifier, oscilloscope and software used, this can be done manually or automatically (e.g., by pressing the “On-cell” key in PATCHMASTER)\nSet the holding voltage to −70 mV to bring the pipette potential closer to the resting potential of the cell and to prevent cell depolarization when the membrane patch is broken.",
    "Apply brief, intense negative pressure pulses to break open the membrane patch enclosed in the pipette. Do this with care, as excess suction can also disrupt the giga-seal and the cell will no longer be useful. Once you break the patch, electrical access to the cell cytoplasm is achieved and the membrane potential becomes the pipette potential, thereby reaching the “whole-cell” configuration of the patch-clamp technique (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: The whole cell configuration is manifested by a sudden reduction in membrane resistance and the appearance of large capacitive transients.\nCancel the cell capacitive transients (due to the charging/discharging of the membrane capacitor), and adjust the amplifier gain and oscilloscope screen parameters to the expected recording conditions (i.e., the size of the currents to be measured). Depending on the amplifier, oscilloscope and software used, this can be done manually or automatically by the software (“Whole-cell” in PATCHMASTER).\nNote: In the whole-cell configuration, current flows mostly through the cell membrane as long as the seal resistance is preserved. If the pipette potential is set close to the cell's resting potential before breaking the patch, very little current would be expected during the test pulses and symmetrical current transients will become apparent at the beginning and end of the pulses. These transients reflect both the cell membrane capacitance and the series resistance between the pipette and the cell cytoplasm.\nCompensate a proportion (70%–90%) of the series resistance for a better voltage-clamp when fast and large currents are to be measured (e.g., voltage-gated Na+ currents responsible for action potential generation). It is also convenient to monitor series resistance throughout the experiment.",
    "Note: Ideally, series resistance should be less than twice the pipette resistance. The series resistance should remain low during the whole-cell recording to favor dialysis of the cytoplasm with the internal solution and to prevent voltage-changes caused by large transmembrane currents. Recordings in which series resistance rises by more than 20% with respect to the initial values are usually discarded.\nWait several minutes (3–10) to complete the cell dialysis with the internal solution, while monitoring the leak current amplitude and series resistance to assess the stability and voltage-clamp suitability of the seal.\nConfigure or select (if previously configured) a stimulation protocol and then apply it to the cell under study. Typical protocols include step depolarizations (e.g., a 100 ms pulse to +10 mV) capable of activating voltage-gated ion channels, such as the Na+ and K+ channels involved in action potential firing. The currents produced in response to voltage-stimulation are recorded and stored for subsequent display and analysis (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C).",
    "Note: Most protocols to measure voltage-activated currents include the so-called \"P/n\" procedure to subtract the leak and capacitive currents evoked by any voltage pulse. These are voltage-related currents that are not due to ion flux through membrane ion channels. Since leak and capacitive currents are linearly related to voltage (as they follow Ohm's law), in the P/n procedure they are triggered by small voltage pulses that are unable to activate ion channels (e.g., one quarter or one sixth of the test pulse), and subsequently scaled to the current size produced by the test pulse (e.g., multiplying their amplitudes by four or six). Subtracting the scaled leak and capacitive currents from the current responses evoked by the test pulse allows the voltage-activated ion currents to be isolated. Their presence is taken as evidence of the functional expression of the ion channels mediating them.\nCarefully bring the pipette close (5–15 μm) to the cell being recorded while monitoring the holding (leak) current as an indicator of seal integrity. Repeat this procedure for every pipette you plan to use in the experiment (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nNote: It is convenient to clear external solution from the pipette tip by applying several pressure pulses when it still is far from the cell under study.\nApply a pulse of pressure to the interior of the application pipette to deliver the drug (1 mM glutamate, 100 μM GABA or 100 μM 5-HT) used to activate ionotropic receptors. The currents produced in response to agonist-stimulation are recorded and stored for subsequent analysis and display (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]D)",
    "Note: Sustain drug application for the time needed to produce a clear response and its eventual decline and then, cease the application and washout the drug by perfusion of the external solution. Once the membrane current recovers the baseline, a second drug from a different pipette can be applied.\nIn cells with a leak current of a few pA at a voltage close to the resting membrane potential, it is possible to switch from the voltage-clamp to the current-clamp mode. This allows:\nTo record the resting potential (when Ip = 0 pA).\nTo assess changes in membrane potential when current is injected (e.g., a current step of +75 pA for 250 ms) or a receptor agonist is administered (e.g., 100 μM 5-HT). Positive current steps and ligand-gated inward currents evoke depolarizing responses and, occasionally, elicit action potentials (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]E).\nNote: The leak current should remain low during voltage-clamp recordings and particularly during current-clamp recordings. Cells with a leak current larger than −100 pA are usually discarded.\nTry to record synaptic currents evoked by transmitters released from a cell making a synaptic contact with the recorded cell (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]F).\nApply 5-HT (100 μ) to an unclamped bipolar cell to elicit glutamate release which, in turn, could activate synaptic-like currents in a multipolar voltage-clamped cell.\nStart local application of MK-801 (10 μM), a NMDA antagonist, to this latter may reduce the amplitude of the currents, thereby allowing the receptors responsible for them to be identified and the glutamatergic nature of the bipolar cell to be inferred.\nNote: Synaptic-like currents can be recognized by their rapid onset and brief duration.",
    "Once the experiment is finished, proceed to stop recording, save the file and pull the recording pipette away from cell. Finally, lift the electrode out of the bath and remove the glass pipette from the electrode holder.\nNote: An experiment is finished when the experimental protocol has been completed or when the recording conditions (leak current, series resistance, current run-down, etc.) make the results unreliable or difficult to interpret.\nIf attempting to perform a new experiment on the same coverslip, repeat steps 67–83. If you decide to use a fresh coverslip, start the procedure again from step 61.\nNote: The decision as to whether the coverslip should be changed will depend on the time it has been kept in the recording chamber (a maximum of 1 h is advisable), the number of cells previously used, and whether the local drug application and washes are performed effectively.\nCritical: Never reuse patch pipettes.\nBasic current measurements and processing of electrophysiological data can be performed within the PATCHMASTER software. This software allows replaying data and measuring peak currents or voltage amplitudes in the digital oscilloscope window, which provides a readout of the current or voltage traces by placing a cursor on any sampled value. Likewise, baseline currents or potentials can be manually or automatically subtracted from the peak values."
