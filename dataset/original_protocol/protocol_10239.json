    "Caution: Please consult all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. Acetone is highly flammable and can cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. The voltage involved is as high as several thousand volts; hence, electrical sparks are expected when conducting the experiment. Carry out the experiments in a room with good ventilation to avoid explosions and fire from the sparks.\n1. Fabrication of the Plates and Holder\nNOTE: In this work, the electrode plates and holder are fabricated by a production line in a factory. Only the material and the parameters of all parts in this paper will be introduced due to the complicated processes.\nMaterial and size of the electrode plate\nFabricate the electrode plates using 1.4 mm FR-4 CCL with a thin copper layer of 35 Âµm. See Figure 1 for detailed parameters of the electrode plate.\nParameters of the electrodes\nOrder the electrode plates from the factory. See Figure 2 for more details.\nInspection of the electrode plate\nAfter the preparation of the electrode plate, use an electron microscope to inspect the electrodes for any noticeable flaws under 100X and 300X magnification. Note that any tiny defects on the surface of the electrodes can cause short-circuiting, as shown in Figure 3.\nInspect and measure the electrode width and spacing to determine whether the dimension accuracy meets the requirement.\nTest the plate with an amperemeter to see if an electrical short-circuit occurs.\nPreparation of the chamber plate\nCut some silicone membrane to the same size as the electrode plate, as shown in Figure 4. Choose silicone membranes with different thicknesses to make chamber plates with different heights.\nUse a special punching tool to punch the chamber hole, as shown in Figure 5.\nProcessing of the holder",
    "Order the holder from a factory. The detailed parameters are shown in Figure 6.\nFabrication of the cover plate\nDrill two holes on the top of the cover plate using a drilling machine to install the inlet and outlet tubes. See Figure 7 for their positions and sizes.\n2. Assembly of the Micropump\nUse acetone to wash all the plates, the holder, the inlet and outlet tubes, and other tools used in the experiments. Put these tools and plates inside a beaker and then pour enough 99.5% acetone to immerse them. Put the beaker inside the ultrasonic washer. Turn on the ultrasonic washer and set the timer to 5 min.\nInsert the inlet and outlet stainless-steel tubes into the two holes on the cover plate.\nPlace a chamber plate made of silicone membrane on the electrode plate and then cover it with the cover plate.\nStack and align the cover plate, the chamber plate, and the electrode plate from top to bottom and insert the aligned plates into the holder.\nUse an M5 bolt to fix the plates inside the holder. See the explosion view and normal view of the assembled micropump, as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, respectively.\nPress the plates together by tightening the bolts.\n\t\tNOTE: The tubes and the cavity on the chamber plate will form a passage for the working liquid. The elastic chamber plate can also seal off the gap between plates to prevent liquid from flowing out. See the explosion view and the normal view of the assembled micropump in Figure 8 and Figure 9, respectively.\nUse two polyurethane hoses with external diameters of 4 mm and internal diameters of 2 mm to connect the inlet and outlet stainless-steel tubes.",
    "Connect an amperemeter, a 500 V DC power source, and the micropump in series. Insert a 1 mA fuse between the amperemeter and the power source to protect the amperemeter in case the micropump is shorted.\nInsert the inlet hose into a 50 mL beaker with 20-30 mL of acetone inside.\n\tNOTE: Figure 10 shows the completed platform.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nPreparatory work before the experiment\nUse a cylinder to inject acetone to fill up the micropump. After the liquid level reaches the outlet hose, continue to inject 10 mL of acetone inside until all bubbles are pushed away from the chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: It is impossible to see if there are any bubbles left inside the chamber because the cover plate and the electrode plate are not transparent. Continuously injecting acetone helps to remove bubbles, but it cannot guarantee that no bubbles are left inside the micropump. Bubbles may block the passage of liquid, or they may short the circuits and cause a micro-explosion inside the micropump, which will burn the electrodes. The effect of bubbles on the pump operation is not totally clear yet, but the breakdowns they cause have been observed several times.\nPour 20-30 mL of acetone into the beaker and put the inlet hose inside the beaker. Ensure that the liquid level is at least 5 mm higher than the inlet so that acetone can flow into the pump and no air can be sucked into the micropump chamber.\nStatic pressure test\nAttach the outlet hose to a small frame so that the hose can remain straight and vertical. Put a ruler alongside the outlet hose to measure the liquid level.\nConnect the micropump to the power source.\nStart the test by pressing the switch and then mark down the initial liquid level.",
    "After the liquid level becomes stable, record the time, the final liquid level, and the electric current.\nContinue to record the liquid level and the current every 10 s until the micropump breaks down.\nFlow rate test\nUse a large measuring cylinder to collect the liquid coming out of the outlet hose. Be sure to fix the outlet hose so that the end remains at the same altitude as the liquid level in the beaker.\nConnect the micropump to the power source.\nStart the test by pressing the switch and then mark down the initial liquid level.\nAs the liquid starts to flow out of the outlet hose, record the volume of acetone inside the measuring cylinder every 10 s. As the experiment goes on, add acetone to the beaker to maintain the liquid level.\nReliability test\nUse the average working time to evaluate the reliability of the pump. During the flow rate test and the static pressure test, record the operation time before the pump breaks down. Record the detailed phenomena of each breakdown during the experiment and inspect the electrode plate surface afterwards for further analysis.\nSubscription Required.
