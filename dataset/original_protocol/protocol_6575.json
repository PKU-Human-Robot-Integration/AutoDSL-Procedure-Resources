  "procedures": [
    "Prepare 10 mg/ml docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) stock solution (see Recipe) Dilute DHA solution with pure ethanol at 10 mg/ml.Note: DHA will stick to plastic material. Always remember to use glass pipettes when you work with fatty acids. Aliquot DHA stock solution into small glass bottles, 10 ml each.Ambient air above the solution should be displaced to avoid oxidation of DHA by priming pure nitrogen gas on the surface of the solution prior to closing the container.Store at -20 °C. DHA Stimulation assaySeed 2 x 106 STC-1 cells in 6-cm dishes two days prior to experiment in duplicates. Culture the cells in tissue culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, using DMEM with 10% FBS and 20 ng/ml enrofloxacin.On experimental day cells should be 80% confluent.Aspirate media and wash the cells twice with 3 ml of HEPES buffer.Add 3 ml of HEPES buffer into each dish.Put cells back to tissue incubator for 30 min. The lack of nutrients in the buffer is meant to serve as a ‘starvation’ period prior to nutrient stimulation.Prepare 100 µM DHA stimulation buffer.To prepare 20 ml of 100 µM DHA stimulation buffer, add 66 µl of 10 mg/ml DHA (30.4 mM) stock solution into a glass beaker using glass capillary micropipettes. Then add 20 ml of HEPES buffer.Sonicate the solution immediately at output level 5 and constant duty cycle for 3 min prior to stimulation to prevent DHA precipitation. If using a different sonicator, set the amplitude as 40%. After sonication, the solution should be clear, with minimal bubbling.Note: Always prepare this DHA solution freshly, just prior to use. Aspirate HEPES buffer gently. Then add 1 ml of HEPES buffer into each control dish and 1 ml of DHA stimulation buffer into each stimulation dish. Put all dishes back to tissue culture incubator for 15 min.",
    "Collect 600 µl of media from each dish and put into a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, then place them on ice.Add 0.6 µl of 100 mM PMSF (see Recipe) into the 600 µl of media at final concentration of 100 µM.Spin the microcentrifuge tubes at 850 x g for 5 min, at 4 °C.Transfer 500 µl of media into a fresh tube.Note: Samples are now ready for ELISA measurement. One can also store samples at -80 °C up to two weeks. Measure GLP-1 concentration in samples by ELISA kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Make sure to set the standard as suggested by the manufacturer.Lyse the cells in the culture and measure protein concentration from all dishes by Bradford assay   Note: This is meant to account for differences in the number of cells in each dish in these experiments.Carefully remove any residual HEPES buffer in each dish.Add 1 ml of cold PBS into each dish.Scrape cells down very carefully using a cell lift. Collect cells into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and put on ice. Spin the tubes at 850 x g for 5 min, at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatants, then add 50 µl of cell lysis buffer and pipette up and down gently to homogenize. Put tubes on ice.Lyse the cells for 20 min. Vortex every 5 min. Spin the tubes at 21,130 x g for 15 min, at 4 °C.Transfer supernatants into a fresh tube. Measure protein concentration using protein assay dye reagent concentrate according to manufacturer’s instructions."
