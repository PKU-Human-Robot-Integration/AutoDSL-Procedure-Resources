  "procedures": [
    "The following procedure outlines four main steps: (A) preparation of mammalian cells, (B) cell counting, (C) annexin V staining of adherent cells, and (D) preparation of GUVs. The last step was originally applied to study the binding specificity of annexin V to different membrane lipid compositions (Weingärtner et al., 2012; Grifell-Junyent et al., 2022). We recommend this analysis before applying new probes in cell studies.Preparation of mammalian cells Grow adherent cells in sterile culture vessels (T-75 flask) in growth medium (see Recipe 1) in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) until they reach ~60%–70% confluency.Caution:  C2C12 cells will differentiate if grown too confluent and start to fuse. Differentiation and fusion are accompanied by transcriptional changes, which can lead to different results.Aspirate and discard growth media with sterile serological pipette.Wash cells twice with 5 mL of HBSS (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free, pre-warmed at 37 °C) using a sterile serological pipette.Add 1.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution (pre-warmed at 37 °C) using a sterile serological pipette and incubate the T-75 flasks in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity). Tilt the vessel back and forth a few times to make sure the thin layer of trypsin is evenly spread.After 5 min, check for detachment by gently tilting vessel and/or observing under the microscope. If all cells have not detached in 5 min, incubate an additional 1–2 min and check again. Continue to incubate and check as necessary, only until cells are no longer attached to the plate surface.Caution:  Avoid prolonged incubation period with trypsin-EDTA solution.Stop trypsinization by adding 7.5 mL of growth medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipe 1) to the cell suspension.Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube and set aside 100 μL in a 1.",
    "5 mL microcentrifuge tube for cell counting, e.g., using the hemocytometer (see section B).Centrifuge cells in the 15 mL Falcon tube at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant to remove the trypsin-EDTA containing medium from the cells.Add 10 mL of fresh growth medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipe 1) to the cell pellet and re-suspend completely by gently pipetting up and down using a serological pipette.Caution:  Cells in suspension settle quickly. After counting, we recommend gently re-suspending the cell suspension approximately every 2–3 min when seeding multiple dishes.After counting (see section B), seed 1.5 × 104 cells per 35 mm polymer bottom dishes and add growth medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipe 1) up to a final volume of 1 mL per dish.Note: Prepare sufficient Petri dishes for control samples (see section C). We used a low cell number for seeding because C2C12 is a fast-growing cell line (doubling time: ~20 h) and this cell number guarantees that single cells are still present when the assay is performed the next day. Keep the cells in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) overnight.Cell counting (supplemental; if information on cell counting is not required, proceed to section C) The purpose of this step is to quantify the cell concentration to resuspend the cells at the appropriate concentration for the assay. We routinely use the trypan blue hemocytometer assay. Alternative cell counting methods such as automatic cell counters may be used.Prepare the hemocytometer by cleaning the chambers and coverslip with ethanol. Dry the hemocytometer by using lint-free tissue. Place the glass coverslip over the counting chambers.Note: The correct placement is indicated by the appearance of the Newton rings.Add 100 μL of 0.",
    "4% trypan blue solution to 100 μL of cell suspension (step A7) to obtain a 1:1 dilution using a P200 Eppendorf pipette.Load the hemocytometer with 10 μL of cell suspension per counting chamber with a P20 Eppendorf pipette and examine immediately under an inverted phase contrast microscope at low magnification (e.g., 5–10× magnification).Critical:  To ensure accurate results, it is important to avoid over- or underfilling the cell suspension chamber.Count the number of viable (seen as bright cells) and non-viable cells (stained blue) in the large outer quadrants.Calculate the percentage of viable cells: % viable cells = [1.00 - (number of blue cells ÷ number of total cells)] × 100. Cell viability should be at least 95%.Calculate the cell concentration based on the premise that each square accounts for a volume of 10-4 mL of cell suspension.To obtain the total number of viable cells per milliliter of aliquot, multiply the total number of viable cells by 2 (the dilution factor for trypan blue) and the correction factor of 104 (volume of each square).Annexin V staining of adherent cells We suggest that at least four samples are prepared (Figure 1): i) a negative control without staining to determine background fluorescence, ii) a sample stained with DAPI only, iii) a sample to be stained with DAPI and annexin V in the presence of calcium, and iv) a sample to be stained with DAPI and annexin V in the absence of calcium.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4754/bioprotoc-13-14-4754-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the annexin V binding assay. Preparation of a negative control without DAPI and annexin V staining, a control with DAPI-stained cells, and cells stained with DAPI and annexin V conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 for 10 min on ice with TBSS with or without calcium, respectively.",
    "The negative control without staining is used to assess the level of background fluorescence in the sample. This is important because even in the absence of a fluorescent stain, there may still be some level of background fluorescence present due to autofluorescence or other sources. DAPI staining (at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL) is used for visualization of nuclei and cell counting. Non-specific binding of Ca2+-dependent annexin V is tested in the same assay by using TBSS without Ca2+.Prior to the start of the assay, prepare TBSS with and without calcium (± Ca2+; see Recipes 2 and 3) and a DAPI stock solution (see Recipe 4).Note: Annexin V requires the presence of Ca2+ to bind to PS. TBSS without Ca2+ is used as a negative control. To prepare the cells for labeling, carefully aspirate and discard the growth medium using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.Wash cells twice with 1 mL of TBSS (± Ca2+; cooled on ice, see Recipes 2 and 3) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.After washing, add 0.5 mL of TBSS (± Ca2+; cooled on ice, see Recipes 2 and 3) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.Add 5 μL of the annexin V conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 using a P20 Eppendorf pipette and incubate for 10 min on ice in the dark.Note: Skip steps C5–C8 for the negative control (i); skip steps C5–C7 for the sample only stained with DAPI (ii). Remove staining solution and wash the cells twice with 1 mL of TBSS (± Ca2+; cooled on ice, see Recipes 2 and 3) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.After washing, add 0.5 mL of TBSS (± Ca2+; cooled on ice, see Recipes 2 and 3) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.",
    "Add DAPI stock solution to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL (stock 1 mg/mL: add 5 μL using a P20 Eppendorf pipette). Incubate the cells at room temperature for 10 min in the dark.Note: At the concentration used here, DAPI stains the nucleus of both live and dead cells and is used for the visualization of nuclei and cell counting. When using DAPI for dead cell staining, a final concentration of 0.1 μg/mL is recommended. Alternatively, other dead cell staining reagents such as SYTOX Blue can also be used. Remove staining solution and wash cells twice with 1 mL of TBSS (± Ca2+; cooled on ice, see Recipes 2 and 3) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.Add 1 mL of TBSS (± Ca2+; cooled on ice, see Recipes 2 and 3) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette and image on the microscope.Preparation of GUVs Prepare the stock and working solutions of the lipidsClean the Hamilton syringes by flushing them ten times with chloroform:methanol (1:1, v:v).Caution:  Chloroform is a hazardous solvent. Conduct all work in a fume hood, while wearing proper protective clothing.To have a 5 mg/mL lipid film, transfer 500 μL of a 10 mg/mL DOPC stock solution (see Recipe 5) into a round bottom glass tube on ice using Hamilton syringes. For 5 mg/mL DOPC:DOPE or DOPE:DOPS lipid mix, add 9 mol DOPC and 1 mol DOPE or DOPS (lipid stocks, see Recipe 5). In this study, the lipid mixtures DOPC:DOPE and DOPC:DOPS will be named only DOPE and DOPS, respectively.Caution:  Avoid any use of plastic ware when handling organic solvents. For more complex or different lipid mixtures, the volume of used lipids needs to be adjusted.",
    "Evaporate the organic solvent at room temperature under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator at 250 mbar for 2–4 h followed by evaporation at ~10 mbar for 15 min (see Figure 2A and 2B).Store the lipid film at -20 °C until use.Dissolve the lipid film in 1 mL of chloroform:methanol (1:1; v:v).Transfer into a glass vial with screw caps closed with parafilm and store it at -20 °C.Cleaning of the glass slidesClean the glass slides with detergent, deionized water, and 70% ethanol.Dry the slides with wipes.Place glass slides in the UV/ozone cleaner.Run the UV/ozone cleaner for 30 min.Caution:  The UV/ozone cleaner must be placed under a fume hood.Turn off the UV/ozone cleaner and wait at least 15 min before opening the chamber.Preparation of GUVsGlue the O-ring using vacuum grease onto the cleaned side of one of the glass slides to have a tight, closed chamber. Apply 35–40 drops of 1 μL of lipid mix inside the O-ring under the fume hood (see Figure 2C).Evaporate the solvent under vacuum for 30–60 min at 250 mbar in a desiccator.Fill the O-ring with swelling buffer (see Recipe 6) and place the other glass slide on top with the cleaned side facing downwards.Place the chamber in a dark room for 2–4 h at room temperature (see Figure 2D).Carefully tap on each side of the chamber.Transfer the GUVs to a 2 mL tube by removing the glass slide and O-ring.Store the GUVs covered in aluminum foil at room temperature.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4754/bioprotoc-13-14-4754-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "The desired volume and type of lipid is mixed in chloroform:methanol (1:1; v:v) in a glass tube and (I) the solvent is evaporated in rotary evaporator under the reduced pressure of 250 mbar for 2–4 h; (II) the resulting thin lipid film on the glass tube is dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:1; v:v) and (III) stored in a glass vial with screw caps sealed with parafilm. (B) The glass tube containing the lipids in chloroform is connected to the rotary evaporator. (C) Equipment for a GUV formation of the home-made chamber. (D) Schematic workflow of GUV formation by the swelling method. The lipid mixture is applied to the cleaned glass slides and (I) dehydrated in a desiccator at 250 mbar for 30–60 min. The dried lipid film is then (II) rehydrated in a swelling buffer for 2–4 h, resulting in the formation of giant vesicles.Annexin V staining of GUVsPlace 25 μL of GUVs (with a cut tip) in 25 μL of binding buffer (see Recipe 7) on a cover glass slide.Note: As additional control, a GUV sample in buffer without Ca2+ can be prepared. Place the cover glass slide under the microscope.Let the GUVs settle for approximately 5 min before imaging in a white light channel and an annexin V channel."
