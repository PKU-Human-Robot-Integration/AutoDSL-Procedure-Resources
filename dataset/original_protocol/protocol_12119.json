    "This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco. Participants were scheduled to arrive at the lab between 4:30-5:00 PM.\n1. Rinse Mouth\nAsk the participant to go to the restroom and rinse out their mouth with water only. Have the participant swish with cold water for 5-10 s and spit in the sink. Do this only once.\nSay to participant, \"This is to make sure there's no food or crumbs in your teeth for saliva collection.\"\n2. Resting Period\nUsher participant into a solitary room and allow them to sit for at least 10 min. Have the participant complete non-invasive or non-provoking questionnaires such as a contact information sheet and daily living questionnaires, as well as watch a 3 min peaceful video of sea life.\n3. Saliva collection #1 (Pre-stress)\nPlace a line to indicate 1 mL of saliva on a 2 mL cryovial, and tell the participant to fill the cryovial to this line. Collect participant's saliva via passive drool through a two-inch straw into the 2 mL cryovial36 and freeze immediately (-80 °C).",
    "Say to participant, \"I will ask you to fill this vial with saliva right up to this line. The way to do it is to let saliva collect in your mouth and then let it run through the straw into the vial. It's best if you don't spit because that gets bubbles in your sample - just let the saliva run through the straw. It will help if you don't talk while you're doing this. Please try not to cough up phlegm, we just want normal saliva. Keep an eye on your saliva vial and how full it is. If there are bubbles at the top of your saliva, they should go over the line, so there is just liquid saliva right up to the line. Tell me when it fills up to the line. Here are some pictures of food posted on the wall (POINT OUT PICTURES), since thinking of favorite foods makes peoples' mouths water.\"\nOffer water after the participant has completed the saliva sample. Do not allow the participant to keep the water; take it back when he/she is finished.\n4. Preparation Period",
    "Say to participant: \"In a few min, we would like you to give a five-minute speech about how you are a good friend. There is a committee of two trained reviewers who are in the room next door who are going to be listening to your speech. Your job is to make the reviewers believe that you are a good friend. They want you to explain what things make you a good friend to others. You are competing against a lot of other people for how good you are at giving your speech and convincing people that you are a good friend. The reviewers are experts in judging facial expression and body movement, and they are going to compare your speech to other people in the study. You may notice that the reviewers are taking notes. This is so we can review their notes at a later time. You will also be videotaped so that we can rate your performance later.\nYou'll have 3 min now to prepare for your speech. Remember, your speech should explain what it is about you that makes you a good friend, and you are competing against other people for how believable you are. After that, I will take you to the next room, where you will introduce yourself to the reviewers and give your 5-minute speech. There will be another task that comes after the speech, but the reviewers will let you know what the task is after the speech. Do you have any questions? You may write notes if you want, but you won't be able to take them into the room with you. Ok, please start preparing. I'll return in a few minutes.\"\nHand participant paper, pen, and clipboard to allow them to take notes.\nLeave the participant alone in the room.",
    "Wait 3 min and then come back in the room.\n5. TSST Set Up\nSay to participant, \"Okay, it's time to go next door and get started.\" If the participant has written notes, take them from the participant. Say, \"I can take those from you now. Thanks.\"\nWalk the participant to TSST room and indicate that they should face the confederates and the video camera.\nStart the video recording before the participant enters the room. Record the entire speech and math tasks (approximately 10 min total).\nHave the Youth Interviewer introduce the committee. \"This is_(participant's name)_. _(Participant)_, do you know either of these people?\"\nIf the participant answers no, have the Youth Interviewer says \"Okay, you can get started.\"\nIf the participant answers yes, have the Participant indicate whom s/he knows, and have the Youth Interviewer say \"Okay, _(confederate)__, please excuse yourself. The judges need to be people who don't know you.\"\n6. TSST Speech Task\nHave Confederate 1 say, \"Please tell us why you are a good friend. Begin speaking now.\"\nSet the timer for 5 min. Start timer.\nAfter 30 s of silence, use one of the following prompts to keep the participant talking. Use prompts in order each time there is a 30 s pause.\nSay \"You still have time. Please continue.\"\nSay \"Why else are you a good friend?\"\nSay \"Please give an example of when you were a good friend.\"\nSay \"Be as creative as you like. Why else are you a good friend?\"\nAfter all prompts above have been used, continue prompting thereafter with, \"You still have time. Please continue.\"\nAfter 5 min, have Confederate 1 say: \"Please stop. Your time is up.\" (Proceed to math task.)\n7. TSST Math Task",
    "Have Confederate 1 say, \"We are now going to ask you to count out loud backward. Start at 423, and count backward by 7's. Keep counting backward by 7's out loud until we tell you to stop. If you make a mistake, we will let you know and ask you to start over. Please be as quick and accurate as possible. Now we would like you to begin counting backward - start at 423, and subtract 7. Continue subtracting 7's out loud until we tell you to stop.\"\nSet the timer for 5 min. Start timer.\nIf participant looks confused, have Confederate 1 say, \"Would you like me to repeat that?\"\nIf the participant makes a mistake, have Confederate 1 say, \"That's incorrect. Please start again. 423 minus 7.\"\nIf the participant does not start counting out loud after 30 s, move to the next easier math problem, using same instructions as above with same prompts.\nUse the following as the easier math problems include (in this order):\n\t423 - 5 = ?\n\t95 - 5 = ?\n\t66 - 3 = ?\n\t6 + 3 = ?\nIf the participant stops after each correct answer to wait for confirmation, have Confederate 1 say, \"Continue counting backward by 7. We will only correct you if you make a mistake - otherwise, keep going.\"\nAfter 5 min, have Confederate 1 say, \"Time is up. Please go next door to give your next saliva sample.\"\nEscort participant back to solitary room.\n8. Stop Protocol\nEmpower both confederates to stop the protocol early. Both confederates are not required to consult with each other before doing so.",
    "If participant cries or appears teary-eyed, becomes obviously angry or aggressive, or otherwise shows distress or if participant begins to posture in a way that appears aggressive or odd, stop protocol immediately but as normally as possible.\nSay, \"Time's up. Please go next door to give your next saliva sample.\"\nDirect participant to the next room.\n9. Saliva Sample # 2 (15 min Post-stressor Onset)\nWhen youth re-enters next room, set the timer for 15 min.\nSay to the participant, \"That's the toughest part of your visit; thanks for doing that and we're going to talk about it in a second. It's time to collect another saliva.\"\nIf participant mentions TSST, say to the participant, \"We can talk about that in a minute, but please do the saliva sample first. \nPlace a line to indicate 1 mL of saliva on a 2 mL cryovial, and tell participant to fill the cryovial to this line. Collect participant's saliva via passive drool through a two-inch straw into the 2 mL cryovial36 and freeze immediately (-80 °C).\nOffer water to drink after the participant has completed the saliva sample. Do not allow the participant to keep the water; take it back when he/she is finished.\n10. Debrief\nSay to participant, \"Okay, let's talk about the speech and math activities. You may have guessed this already, but the whole purpose of those activities was to create stress. You may have noticed that the \"reviewers\" weren't exactly the friendliest in the world, right?\"",
    "\"Well, first of all, I want to tell you that the 'reviewers' are just research assistants. Their job is to make teens do the activities but not give any positive feedback no matter how great you do. So their behavior in there had nothing to do with your performance on those tasks - they act the same way with every single participant they meet. \"\n\"You're probably wondering why we did that. We had a scientific reason for doing it. We are studying whether the amount of stress you experience in your daily life affects how strongly you respond to a stressful situation like this one. One point of the study is to understand why teens react differently to stress. We were measuring something called cortisol in your saliva samples as a way to see your stress response.\"\n\"If you found the speech and math stressful, you're not alone! We chose making speeches and doing math because we know that even though they're safe to do, they make a lot of people nervous. Let me tell you, we needed to do those activities ourselves, and we all found it really hard! Even the scientists from Berkeley messed up the math. And we all said 'those were the longest 10 minutes of my life!' Did you feel that way?\"\n\"A few more things I want to mention…\"\n[IF VIDEOTAPED] \"We videotaped this for 2 reasons. The main reason is so our bosses can make sure that WE are doing the activity correctly. In the future, we may also look at the videos to get more information about people's facial expressions. It's just another way of looking at how teens respond differently to stress.\"",
    "[IF NOT VIDEOTAPED] \"The truth is we weren't actually videotaping you. The camera wasn't really turned on. This was another part of the acting to make it more stressful.\"\n\"The people in there weren't really writing notes about your performance. They were just writing nonsense notes as part of their acting.\n\"We would like to ask that you please not mention this activity to anyone else who might be in the study, even if they're your best friend, brother, sister, cousin, or whatever. If other people learn about this activity before they come in for the visit, they may practice their speech at home or get nervous before they even get here, and they will have a totally different experience than you just did. We don't want that to happen. Does this make sense? For the same reason, if you talk with your parents about it, please ask them not to tell friends or family in the study.\"\n\"Do you have any questions?\"\n11. Saliva Sample #3 (30 min Post-stressor Onset)\nPlace a line to indicate 1 mL of saliva on a 2 mL cryovial, and tell participant to fill the cryovial to this line. Collect participant's saliva via passive drool through a two-inch straw into the 2 mL cryovial36 and freeze immediately (-80 °C).\nSet timer for 15 min.\nOffer water to drink after the participant has completed the saliva sample. Do not allow the participant to keep the water; take it back when he/she is finished.\n12. Saliva Sample #4 (45 min Post-stressor Onset)\nPlace a line to indicate 1 mL of saliva on a 2 mL cryovial, and tell participant to fill the cryovial to this line. Collect participant's saliva via passive drool through a two-inch straw into the 2 mL cryovial36 and freeze immediately (-80 °C).",
