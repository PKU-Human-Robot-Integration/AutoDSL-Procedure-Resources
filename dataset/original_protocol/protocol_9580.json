    "This study was conducted with approval of the Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board (HS-20-01011), and all subjects gave written informed consent.\n1. Preparation before starting the protocol\nAppropriate folder structure is necessary for this program. Start by creating a main folder for the project anywhere on the computer by right-clicking and selecting the New Folder option in the files directory. All input DICOM files and results will be stored in this main folder.\n\tNOTE: All DICOM headers required by this program are standard. Therefore, the program is translatable across scanner platforms.\nWithin this main folder, create two new folders by right-clicking and selecting the New Folder option twice.\nRename the first of these two folders to make it obvious that it stores raw data (e.g., Original_Data) by right-clicking on it and selecting the Rename option.\n\t\nCreate a new folder for a given patient within this Original_Data folder by right-clicking and selecting the New Folder option. Rename it as an anonymized patient identifier by right-clicking on the folder and selecting the Rename option. Import only the complete set of raw DICOM files for this patient into this folder.\nRepeat step 1.3.1 for all the patients to be analyzed in the program.\nRename the second of these two folders as Meta_Data for the storage of results by right-clicking on it and selecting the Rename option. This folder will be empty until the program is run and results are generated.\nDownload the program file (Supplementary File 1) and the cover art image (Supplementary File 2) and move them from the downloads folder to the main project folder by dragging and dropping. The final setup of the project folder should look similar to Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65458/65458fig01.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Format of main project folder. This figure shows how the project's main folder should be structured and formatted for proper use of the program.

Launching the Program\nOpen the program's code by double-clicking on its file in the project's main folder. This will open the software and display the program's code.\nEnter the editor window by single-clicking anywhere on it. Click the green Run button located in the top ribbon of the editor tab to launch the program. The initial program window, after opening, should look like the image in Figure 2.\n\tNOTE: Written instructions on the expected actions from the user and the progress of result generation will be displayed in the bottom left area throughout the course of using the program.\nClick the Open DICOM button in the bottom left corner. This will open the files directory.\nNavigate to the project's main folder, the folder containing the original data, and to a patient to analyze. Single-click on the patient's folder so that it's highlighted and click Open.\nThe images will now appear in three views: axial, sagittal, and coronal. Hovering and scrolling on a particular view will go through the slices in that view. The crosshairs on each view display the location of the pointer at that moment. Adjust the brightness and contrast in the bottom right area of the program by sliding the bars, as in Figure 3.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65458/65458fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Initial program window. The program, when initially launched, has the buttons laid out along with an art image.

    "Figure 3: Graphical user interface (GUI). Once images are loaded in, the program's GUI shows three anatomical views of the images along with crosshairs on each view, representing the cursor.

Analyzing coronary artery calcification\nWhen ready to start analyzing, click the 0 mg/mL Phantom button. Hover over the axial view and scroll up or down until the 0 mg/mL section of the phantom is visible.\nMove the cursor to the center of the 0 mg/mL phantom in the axial view. Now, without moving the cursor, observe the crosshairs in the sagittal and coronal views.\nSlowly scroll up and down a few slices until the crosshairs in all three views are in the center of the 0 mg/mL phantom. Single-click to place a 10-by-10 grid of points on the current slice and its neighboring two slices. Doing so will cause a red cluster of circles to appear in the axial view and a column of three points to appear in the sagittal and coronal views. These points will be used in the calculation of the weighting function.\nRepeat steps 3.1-3.3 for the 100 mg/mL phantom.\nIf a phantom is not available or is unusable due to quality issues, click the No Phantom button for an aggregation of 10 sample phantoms and its corresponding weighting function to be used.\nWhen done selecting the phantoms, begin tracing each of the four coronary arteries by clicking on one of the artery buttons- LAD, LCA, LCX, or RCA.\nHover over the axial view and scroll to navigate to either the proximal or distal end of the chosen artery. Observe the shape of the artery in this slice.",
    "If the shape of the artery is circular in the axial view of this slice and at most 5 mm in diameter, follow these sub-steps. If it is not circular, move on to step 3.9.\n\t\nPlace a point on the artery by single-clicking on the center of the artery in the axial view. The point placed will be displayed with a circle that is 5 mm in diameter. If the artery does not fit in the circle, delete it by double-clicking on it and move on to step 3.9 to draw an ROI. The point will appear in the sagittal and coronal views as well.\nIf the artery is easier to visualize in the sagittal or coronal view, place a point there instead. Ensure it aligns with the center of the artery in the axial view.\nIf a point placed is accidental or is not optimal, it can be deleted by rapidly double-clicking on it in any of the three views. The text in the bottom left area will give a notification that the point has been deleted.\nIf the shape of the artery is not circular in the axial plane, follow the steps below.\n\t\nWhile ensuring the desired axial slice is in view, click on the Draw ROI button. In the pop-up window, scroll to zoom in/out and start single-clicking around the artery to trace it, as in Figure 4.\n\t\tNOTE: ROIs, unlike points, can only be placed in the axial view.\nWhile the ROI is still open, the backspace key may be utilized to delete the previous point placed in the tracing of the artery. To close the ROI, either double-click where the last point is to be placed or double-click on the first point placed.",
    "Adjust the closed ROI further and refine by dragging the ROI's perimeter points or double-clicking on the perimeter of an ROI to add a point.\nOnce the ROI is closed, two buttons will appear at the bottom of the pop-up window: Lock in and RedrawÂ ROI. If the ROI needs to be redrawn, click the Redraw ROI button to clear the current one and draw a new one.\nWhen satisfied with the current ROI, click the Lock in button and close the pop-up window by clicking the red button in the top left corner (Mac) or the X button in the top right corner (PC) of the pop-up.\nA ROI can be deleted even once it is locked in by double-clicking on any of the perimeter points in the axial view of the main program window (not the pop-up).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65458/65458fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Draw ROI feature. When the Draw ROI option is chosen, a pop-up of the current axial slice appears. The yellow shows an ROI that was previously drawn on this slice. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65458/65458fig04large.jpg]\nScroll up or down one slice in the axial view and repeat steps 3.8-3.9 until the end of the chosen artery is reached. When done, re-click on the finished artery's button to review the tracing of the artery and ensure no accidental points were placed.\n\tNOTE: More than one point or ROI can be placed on any given axial slice. Extra lines connecting two ROIs on a slice can be ignored. If any slices for a given artery are not labeled, an error message will appear. Close the message and label the missed slice(s).\nMove on to the next of the four arteries and repeat steps 3.6-3.10.",
    "When all four arteries have been traced, click the SWCS button in the bottom right corner to generate the results. The bottom left area will show the progress and will display \"Done Processing\" when finished. Close the program window by clicking the red button in the top left corner (Mac) or the X button in the top right corner (PC).\n4. Accessing the results\nTo access the results for the case just analyzed, open the files directory and navigate to the project's main folder. Go into the Meta_Data folder and notice that a new folder with the same name as the original data folder for that subject has appeared.\nWithin this folder, there will be three types of documents: CSVs, PNGs, and PDFs. Review the PDFs to get the final SWCS and Agatston score for the case, as well as the weighting function used.\n\tNOTE: The CSVs store the coordinates of the various points/ROIs placed when analyzing this subject. Having these CSVs will allow this subject's images to be reopened in the program on a later day and have the previous points/ROIs appear automatically. Any changes made to the case, when reopened, will be automatically reflected in the CSVs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
