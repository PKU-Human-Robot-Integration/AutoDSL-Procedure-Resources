    "The images scored in this study were collected as part of a larger taste study conducted in the Genetics of Taste Lab at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (the Museum)10. Subjects of the larger study were museum visitors (n = 1195) ranging in age from 18-93. While subjects came from six of the seven continents, participants were primarily of European descent. Each subject’s data was collected in one 30 min lab session. The Western Institutional Review Board approved the protocol, informed written consent was given, and subjects volunteered their time and were not compensated for their participation in the study.\n1. Data Collection\nImage Capture\n\t\nShow subjects a photograph of how to pose themselves (Figure 1) and what the captured image will look like.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52860/52860fig1.jpgFigure 1: Image Capture Pose. This is the photograph shown to subjects in the GoT Lab in order to correctly pose for their tongue photo.\nDirect subjects to dry their tongue with a paper hand towel and leave tongue protruding from their mouths.\nApply approximately 3 ml of blue food dye at a 1:36 concentration to the apex of the tongue using a sterile, rayon applicator with a 1-inch tip. Have subjects return tongue to their mouth and swallow to remove excess dye.\nHave subjects pose themselves as shown in Figure 1, with their chin on their hands and elbows propped on a table for stability. Direct subjects to extend their tongue a comfortable distance and secure it gently between their teeth.\nAdhere a 2.5 cm piece of filter paper with a 10 mm diameter circular cutout punched in it to the tip of the anterior of the left side of the tongue next to midline (see Figure 1).",
    "Take at least three close-up images of the tongue, capturing the entire 10 mm circular cutout to ensure visualization of all FP within that area. Use the macro setting of a high-quality digital point and shoot camera attached to a tripod for stability.\n\t\t\nZoom in to the extent that the entire cutout is photographed while still within the camera’s recommended zoom range. Ensure that the plane of the camera lens is parallel to the plane of the tongue and that the cutout appears circular in the photo instead of oblong. Review photos to ensure they are high quality and useful for counting.\nImage Selection and Preparation\n\t\nUpload the photos to the computer.\nOf the images taken of the same subject’s tongue, select only one for further analysis based on clear definition between structures on the tongue at the highest zoom and the least distorted angle so the tongue is broad and flat toward the camera.\nOpen the selected raw image in the open source software, ImageJ. Click on “Plugins” and in the dropdown menu scroll to “Analyze” and click “Cell Counter.” When the cell counter opens, click “Initialize” to link the image to the cell counter.\n\t\tNote: Here, use ImageJ 1.45 sec with 32-bit Java 1.6.0_10 version.\n\t\t\nUse a standard magnification of 50% for consistency between scorers and for use in subsequent steps to score FP. Move this image to the left side of the screen next to the cell counter. This image will be referred to as Copy A (See Figure 2, left side of screen).",
    "Open a second copy of the raw image (copy B) for measuring the diameters of the papillae being quantified. Zoom in and out as needed to the preference of the individual scorer throughout the scoring process. Move this copy to the right side of the screen so the two copies are not accidentally confused. (See Figure 2, right side of screen)\nClick on the line tool. Using copy B, zoom in as much as necessary to accurately draw a diameter across the 10 mm inner circle of the filter paper at any angle and click “Analyze” and “Set Scale.” Fill in the “Known Distance” to be “10.” Verify the scale is correct by measuring an alternate angle and ensure the diameter range is between 9.8-10.2 mm. If it is not, repeat this step.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52860/52860fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Copy A and Copy B. Copy A (left) is linked to the cell counter window and remains at 50% magnification for consistency from scorer to scorer while copy B (right) may be zoomed to the preference of the individual.\n2. Scoring FP Using the Denver Papillae Protocol Dichotomous Key\nFor each candidate papilla, use the following dichotomous key (step 2.2-2.5) detailing the criteria to determine if it is a FP. Refer to Figure 3 for a visual of papillae that are classified as FP and for ones that are rejected at each step in the process.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52860/52860fig3.jpgFigure 3: FP vs. Rejected Papillae. Figure 3a is a tongue with several qualifying FP while 3b-3e have circled areas that violate each rule. (3b) area is amorphous; (3c) papillae are too small; 3d) papilla is blue compared to those surrounding it, (3e) papilla is recessed compared to those around it.\nShape",
    "Determine if the candidate papilla is amorphous (shapeless). At 50% zoom see if there is a commonly-recognized geometric shape (oval, cuboidal, round).\nIf there is a geometric shape (see Figure 3a), move to step 2.3.\nIf there is no geometric shape (see Figure 3b), go to the cell counter window and click “Type 1.” On copy A (50% zoom), click the candidate papilla to mark it as amorphous and not a FP. Clicking on types 1-4 in this and subsequent steps allows scorers to know they have addressed all candidate papillae and categorizes which rule was violated when rejecting a structure which will aid in the discussion in step 2.7.2.\nColor\n\t\nRefer to copy A at 50% zoom and determine if there is any color differentiation over the surface of the tongue. If so, continue to the next 2.3.2. If not, do not use color as a determining factor; move to step 2.4.\nDetermine if the candidate papilla is lighter than the tissue or papillae surrounding it (see Figure 3a). If any part of the candidate papilla has remained pink or stained lighter, move to step 2.4.\nIf the candidate papilla is blue and the surrounding papillae are lighter (see Figure 3c), go to the cell counter window and click “Type 2” on the cell counter. On copy A, click the candidate to mark as too blue and not a FP.\nSize\n\t\nUsing copy B, zoom in to the distance where one can comfortably see the outline of the candidate papilla.\nClick on the line tool and measure across the longest dimension of the candidate papilla. Click “Analyze” and then “measure.” If the measured length is 0.5 mm or greater (see Figure 3a), move to step 2.5.",
    "If the measured length is 0.499 mm or less, measure once more to ensure accuracy. If it is still 0.499 mm or less (see Figure 3d), click “Type 3” on the cell counter window and on copy A, click the candidate papilla to mark it as too small and not a FP.\nRecession\n\t\nUsing copy A, assess if the candidate papilla is either uniform height with the rest of the tongue or elevated. If the papilla is in a crevice, determine its height compared to the other structures in the crevice, not the surface of the tongue. If the papilla is lower than the papillae surrounding it (see Figure 3e), use “Type 4” and on copy A, click the candidate papilla to mark it as recessed and not a FP.\nIf the candidate papilla is either of uniform height with the rest of the tongue or elevated (see Figure 3a), use “Type 5” to click it and mark that this is a FP. This type 5 total is the raw FP score. Do not close the copies at this point as ImageJ does not save the scores on the cell counter nor the colored marks from types 1-5 on copy A.\nSaving Copy A\n\t\nWrite down in notebook raw FP score.\nOn the cell counter window, click “Export Image.” Save with the desired naming system of the lab. This will allow the opening of copy A in the future to retain the colored marks from types 1-5. It will not save the raw FP score.\nQuality Control\n\t\nScore each photo by two individual scorers and compare7.",
    "If the higher FP raw score is within 10% of the lower FP raw score, average the two scores together for a consensus FP score. If the two FP raw scores differ by more than 10%, pull both scored photos onto the screen.\n\t\t\nUse counter types 1-4 to aid in discussion of discrepancies and confer on a final consensus score. If no consensus can be reached during the discussion, take a break from scoring. At a later point, rescore the image and discuss. If a consensus still cannot be reached, pull in a third scorer. Ask them to score the image and dialogue with the other two.\n3. Training Scorers to Use DPP\nBackground on Training\n\t\nHave two scorers count a variety of images, scoring individually and conferring regularly to ensure that they were using the same criteria. Only when individual counts were consistently within 10% of each other for each the images when scored was the method (finalized above) considered acceptable and termed DPP.\nChoose 15 official images and 15 training images (Supplemental Figures 2-17) in sequential order to score. If an image was deemed uncountable during selection, skip the image and choose next sequential image.\n\t\tNote: These images vary in quality and size as they were chosen while the Lab was still mastering the correct photography technique. One of the selected images was deemed uncountable through this primary counting process but was left in to ensure that scorers were able to make that call when needed. Therefore there are 16 images given to trainees though only 15 scored images.\nUsing DPP, have the above-mentioned scorers count the 15 training images and create a consensus score for each.",
    "Give trainees the 15 official images and ask to score using Miller & Reedy to create a baseline. Record scores. Conduct a group training which followed step 3.2. Once step 3.2 was completed, have the scorers score the 15 official images again and record their scores.\nTraining Subsequent Scorers on DPP\n\t\nGive training scorers the first training image and demonstrate DPP for a few papillae on this image. Discuss reasoning for selecting or rejecting each papilla as an FP. Allow trainees to continue practicing scoring for the rest of that photo and confer with the consensus number (for the GoT Lab’s consensus number and Type 1-5 markers, see supplementary Figure 1). For this photo discuss any discrepancies regardless of the 10% to ensure understanding of DPP.\nGive subsequent scorers the second training image and have them score using DPP.\nIf the trainee raw FP score is within ten percent of the established consensus count from section 3.1.3., allow trainee to move onto the next image and repeat steps.\nIf the score is outside the ten percent range, use the trainee’s colored marks representing types 1-5 to understand and identify the inconsistency and then address discrepant understanding of DPP.\nGive the trainee the opportunity to rescore the image and verify the new score once more. If successful, trainee moves onto the next image until all images are completed."
