    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nSynaptogliosome Extraction (Day 2)\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step aims at purifying synaptogliosomes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Synaptogliosomes are composed of pre- and postsynaptic compartments along with the PAP, which surrounds the synapse. This protocol enables the conservation of these compartments’ cellular contents, including mRNAs and ribosomes. The following protocol has been developed on hippocampal tissue from adult (P60 and older) mice. Performing this protocol on younger brain tissue and on different brain regions might require adjustments in homogenization volume and sucrose concentrations.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/306-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 4). From Mazaré et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\n(C) A confocal immunofluorescence microscopy image of synaptogliosomes from an Aldh1l1:L10a-eGFP mouse. The ribosomes in PAPs were immunolabelled with eGFP (green). Pre- and postsynaptic areas were immunolabelled for VGluT1 (red) and Homer1 (blue), respectively. Scale bar: 2 μm. From Mazaré et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nNote: All steps are performed on ice, in RNase-free conditions.\nPrepare CHX at stock concentration 100 mg/mL in MetOH; Prepare DTT at stock concentration 100 mM in DEPC-treated water.\nSet centrifuge to 4°C.\nNote: DTT stock solution can be prepared beforehand and stored as aliquots at −20°C for several months. Once defrosted, aliquots cannot be re-used. CHX should be prepared right before use.\nAdd the following to 10 mL synaptogliosome buffer (SB) right before use:\n1 tablet of cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail\n10 μL CHX (Final: 100 μg/mL)\n5 μL 1 M DTT (Final: 0.5 mM)\n10 μL Ribonuclease inhibitor (Final: 1 μL/mL)",
    "Add 800 μL SB in a 1 mL tissue Grinder kept on ice.\nExtract mouse brain and dissect hippocampus. Place one hippocampus directly in the tissue grinder, place the other one in a small cell culture dish filled with SB.\nHomogenize one hippocampus by applying 20–30 strokes with a tight glass pestle.\nCritical: Make sure the pestle does not rise above solution to avoid forming air bubbles.\nTransfer the homogenate to 1.5 mL tubes and keep on ice.\nRepeat step 5 with the second hippocampus.\nSpin the two tubes at 900 × g for 15 min at 4°C in microcentrifuge.\nCollect supernatant (S1) fractions and transfer to new tubes. Discard pellet (P1).\nSpin S1 at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatants and resuspend pellets (P2) with 600 μL synaptogliosomes buffer (SB).\nSpin again at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nMeanwhile, add Ribonuclease inhibitor (1 μL/mL final), CHX (100 μg/mL final) and DTT (0.5 mM final) to TRAP homogenization buffer.\nAt the end of the centrifugation, discard supernatants. The pellets (P3) contain the synaptogliosomes fraction.\nResuspend the first pellet in 500 μL of TRAP homogenization buffer and take this homogenate to resuspend the second pellet. The preparations from both hippocampi are now pooled (500 μL total volume).",
    "Note: It is necessary to test the quality of the synaptosome. It can be done by Western blot (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Compared with the first supernatant obtained from hippocampal homogenate (S1), the synaptogliosome fraction (P3) should contain a lower level of GFAP and higher levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD95 and the cytosolic PAP protein Ezrin (Derouiche and Frotscher, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Lavialle et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Rpl10a-eGFP should also be detected in this fraction, indicating that the P3 fraction comprises astrocytic ribosomes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The presence of astrocyte ribosomes and synapses in the P3 fraction can also be visualized via the immunofluorescent detection of eGFP, VGluT1 (pre-synapse) and Homer1 (post-synapse) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Histone 3, a nuclear marker, is present in the total tissue fraction but should be absent from both S1 and P3 fractions (not shown).\nTranslating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step consists in extracting astroglial ribosome-bound mRNAs from the previously isolated synaptogliosomes from Tg(Aldh1l1-eGFP/Rpl10a) JD130Htz mice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/306-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3). From Mazaré et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\n(C) Purity heat map of RNA-seq data for TRAP on synaptogliosomes for a selection of mRNAs specific for each type of brain cell. The centered value represents mRNAs with log2 (500 normalized reads), which corresponds to our threshold for the presence of an mRNA. Each column represents an independent cDNA library (n = 3 libraries). From Mazaré et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],",
    "(D) Capillary electrophoresis of RNAs extracted from synaptogliosomes from dorsal hippocampi (PAP-TRAP). As a comparison, capillary electrophoresis of RNAs extracted from whole dorsal hippocampi (Astro-TRAP) is also shown.\nGet the pre-clean 1, pre-clean 2, and IP tubes.\nPlace the tubes in the magnetic holder, wait 30 s, and remove supernatants. Add 1 mL 0.15 M KCl Wash Buffer to each tube and invert several times. If necessary, perform a short-pulse spin to remove drops from the wall and lid of the tube. Place the tubes back in the magnetic holder, wait 30 s, and remove supernatants. Repeat twice more for a total of three washes for each tube. Store the tubes on ice in 0.15 M KCl Wash Buffer.\nCritical: Make sure you leave at least 200 μL 0.15 M KCl Wash Buffer on tubes to avoid the beads from drying.\nAdd Ribonuclease inhibitor (1 μL/mL final), CHX (100 μg/mL final) and DTT (0.5 mM final) to the remaining 0.15 M KCl Wash Buffer and 0.35 M KCl Wash Buffer.\nTransfer the homogenate to the 1 mL tissue grinder Potter-Elvehjem kept on ice.\nConnect the pestle to the ES overhead stirrer, preferably installed in a cold room, and insert it into glass tube. Gently rise the speed to 900 rpm and perform 20 strokes. Transfer to a 1.5 mL tube on ice.\nCritical: Make sure the pestle does not rise above solution to avoid forming air bubbles.\nCritical: Ensure that the homogenate stays at 4°C during the whole homogenization procedure.\nSpin at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new tube and add NP-40 to 1% final concentration and DHPC to 30 mM final concentration.\nMix by inversion and incubate for 5 min on ice.",
    "Spin at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nPlace pre-clean 1 tube on the magnetic holder, wait 30 s for the solution to clear and discard extra 0.15 M KCl Wash buffer.\nTransfer the supernatant to the pre-clean tube 1 and incubate for 30 min at 4°C on slow tilt rotation using the Rotoflex Tube Rotator.\nPlace the pre-clean tube 2 on the magnetic holder, wait 30 s for the solution to clear and discard extra 0.15 M KCl Wash buffer.\nPlace the pre-clean tube 1 on the magnetic holder, wait 30 s for the solution to clear and transfer the supernatant from the pre-clean tube 1 to the pre-clean tube 2. Incubate for 30 min at 4°C on slow tilt rotation using the Rotoflex Tube Rotator.\nPlace the IP tube on the magnetic holder, wait 30 s for the solution to clear and discard extra 0.15 M KCl Wash buffer.\nPlace pre-clean 2 tube on the magnetic holder, wait 30 s for the solution to clear and transfer the supernatant to the IP tube. Add 20 μL of 300 mM DHPC, resuspend and incubate for 30 min at 4°C on slow tilt rotation using the Rotoflex Tube Rotator.\nCollect IP beads with magnetic holder, wait 30 s until the solution clears, then place the supernatant, which contains the unbound fraction, in a new tube.\nStore the unbound fraction at −80°C.\nNote: Astroglial ribosome-bound mRNAs are now bound to the anti-GFP-coated magnetic beads.\nNote: After immunoprecipitation, the 0.35 M KCl Wash Buffer is used for a more stringent wash.",
    "Add 1 mL 0.35 M KCl Wash Buffer to the IP beads and invert several times. If necessary, perform a short-pulse spin to remove drops from the wall and lid of the tube. Place the IP tube back in the magnetic holder, wait 30 s, and remove supernatants. Repeat twice more for a total of three washes.\nPlace the IP tube back in the magnetic holder, wait for the solution to clear and discard extra 0.35 M KCl Wash buffer, making sure all liquid is removed.\nAdd 300 μL RLT (RNeasy lysis buffer), remove the magnetic holder, resuspend beads and incubate for 5 min at around 20°C.\nNote: The ribosome-bound mRNAs are now detached from the beads and free in the supernatant.\nCollect beads with the magnetic holder, wait until the solution clears and transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nCritical: Make sure no beads are transferred with the RLT supernatant.\nPause Point: Ribosome-bound mRNAs can be stored at −80°C in RLT for several months as well as the unbound fraction.\nProceed to mRNA extraction following the RNAeasy Mini kit standard protocol (https://www.qiagen.com[href=https://www.qiagen.com]). Elute RNA in 30 μL of RNase-free water.",
    "Note: Yeast tRNAs are about 70 bp length and are therefore lost during the RNA purification step. It is possible to test the purity of the ribosome-bound PAP mRNA extraction with regards to neuronal transcripts by qPCR, comparing in the unbound versus TRAP fraction the level of mRNAs such as Grin1, Slc12a5, Cacna1a, or Bsn, which have previously been detected in the synapses or in the neuropil of the hippocampus (Cajigas et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Hafner et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). The level of mRNAs from other neural cell types, including oligodendrocytes, vascular cells (endothelial cells, and mural cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells)) and microglia, were also verified by RNA-Seq and found to be below the threshold of detection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C)."
