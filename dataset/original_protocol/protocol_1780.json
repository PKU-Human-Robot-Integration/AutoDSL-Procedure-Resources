    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRecovering and inducing yeast libraries\nTiming: 3 days\nYeast libraries are refreshed in growth media (SDCAA) prior to use in sorting. This growth step can be used to allow the library to recover after previous storage of the frozen library. Transferring the nanobody library to induction media (SDGCAA) then promotes nanobody expression on the surface of yeast cells for sorting.\nThaw a frozen aliquot of the nanobody yeast library on the benchtop at room temperature.\nThe frozen library aliquot has >10-fold coverage of the diversity with >109 cells.\nAdd thawed yeast cells to 500 mL of SDCAA media in baffled flask.\nSupplement SDCAA media with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 100 μg/mL kanamycin, and 0.01× Pen-strep.\nIncubate the flask at 30°C at 225 RPM for 18–24 h.\nCalculate the cell density by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600). One OD600 unit is equivalent to approximately 3 × 107 cells/mL.\nCalculate the volume of cells required to seed 500 mL SDGCAA culture at a final OD600 of 1.\nCentrifuge the required number of cells at 2500×g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the cells in SDGCAA, and move the cells to a 500 mL SDGCAA culture in shake baffled flask.\nSupplement SDGCAA media with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 100 μg/mL kanamycin, and 0.01× Pen-strep.\nIncubate the flask at 20°C at 225 RPM for 36–48 h.\nNote: Yeast induction could be performed at 30°C for 18–22 h or at 20°C for 36–48 h. In certain cases, longer induction times help with higher surface expression.\nMagnetic-activated cell sorting, MACS (sort 1)\nTiming: 5 h",
    "Initial MACS selections allow for the processing of a large number of cells (108–109) in early rounds of sorting. In order to ensure full processing of the entire library diversity, approximately 10-fold greater number of cells are processed than the expected library diversity. Performing a MACS selection enriches the library for clones that bind antigen and reduces library diversity to a level that can be processed via FACS.\nCalculate the OD600 of the SDGCAA culture.\nTransfer volume corresponding to 109 cells to a 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 2500×g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cells by resuspending in 25 mL PBSB.\nRepeat Steps 9 and 10.\nCentrifuge the cells at 2500×g for 5 min (room temperature) and discard the supernatant. Prepare 10% w/v milk solution in PBSB by dissolving 500 mg non-fat dry milk in 4.5 mL PBSB followed by end-over-end mixing at room temperature for 10–15 min.\nSpin down milk solution at 2500×g for 5 min (room temperature). Move the supernatant to a new tube.\nNote: Centrifuging the milk solution prior to use removes insoluble aggregates and produces more consistent results.\nResuspend the cells in a final volume of 5 mL with 1% milk (dilute 10% milk solution in PBSB from Step 12) and 300 nM of biotinylated monovalent antigen (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain).\nIncubate cells with antigen for 3 h with end-over-end mixing at room temperature.\nPost antigen incubation, centrifuge the cells at 2500xg for 5 min and wash the cells once by resuspending in 25 mL ice-cold PBSB.\nCentrifuge the cells at 2500×g for 5 min (room temperature).\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the cells in 40 mL ice-cold PBSB.\nAdd 750 μL Miltenyi MACS Streptavidin MicroBeads to the resuspended cells.",
    "Incubate the cells and beads with end-over-end mixing at 4°C for 30–45 min.\nCentrifuge the cells at 2500xg for 5 min and wash the cells once by resuspending in 25 mL ice-cold PBSB.\nCentrifuge the cells at 2500×g for 5 min (room temperature).\nDiscard the supernatant.\nPass the cells through a LS column under a magnetic field.\nNote: LS columns are gravity columns. Before passing cells through them, they need to be placed on magnetic adapter (MidiMACS Separator and MACS MultiStand). Refer to manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001298.PDF[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001298.PDF]) for more details.\nOptional: Pass cells through a 70 μm filter immediately prior to running cells through the LS columns. Filtering cells removes aggregates and allows cells to pass through the column without clogging.\nWash the captured beads once by passing 5 mL ice-cold PBSB through the LS column under the magnetic field.\nRemove the LS column from the magnet and elute beads by passing 5 mL SDCAA through the column.\nTransfer eluted beads and cells to a 50 mL SDCAA media.\nSupplement culture with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 100 μg/mL kanamycin, and 0.01× Pen-strep.\nPlate dilutions (10–1000× from the 50 mL cultures) of the cell culture on yeast dropout plates to evaluate the numbers of cells retained during the selection.\nGrow cells in SDCAA culture and on dropout plates at 30°C at 225 RPM for 2 d. The culture OD600 is typically >8–10 after 2 d of growth.\nPause point: Cells in SDCAA culture can be stored at 4°C for several weeks. After storing at 4°C, cells should be refreshed in fresh SDCAA for 18–24 h prior to induction in SDGCAA.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting, FACS (sorts prior to CDR shuffling)\nTiming: 5 h",
    "FACS selections performed prior to CDR shuffling enrich the sorted library to obtain a population of yeast cells from which binding signal can be easily distinguished from the background. This stage of sorting maintains or sequentially decreases the antigen concentration in order to selection for a binding population that displays modest affinity for the target antigen.\nInduce the yeast cells collected in sort 1 in SDGCAA media as described above in Steps 3–6. Culture volume at this stage may be decreased to 5–8 mL.\nCalculate the OD600 of the SDGCAA culture.\nTransfer volume corresponding to 107–108 yeast cells (adjusted to sample 10-fold greater number of cells compared to the isolated library diversity in the previous sort) to a sterile 1.5 mL tube. Typically, at least 107 cells are prepared to enable collection of at least 3,000–5,000 cells.\nCentrifuge the cells in a tabletop centrifuge at 16,000×g for 1 min (room temperature) and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of PBSB.\nRepeat Steps 30 and 31.\nCentrifuge the cells in a tabletop centrifuge at 16,000×g for 1 min (room temperature) and discard supernatant.\nIncubate the cells with antigen.\nResuspend ∼100–1000 nM antigen (see Note on determining concentrations below) and cell solution in a final volume of 200 μL in a sterile 1.5 mL tube along with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-Myc tag antibody.\nIncubate with antigen at room temperature for 3 h with end-over-end mixing.\nA control sample containing the cells and all reagents except for the antigen should also be included.\nCritical: It is recommended to sample at least 10-fold coverage of nanobody diversity in the early FACS selections (e.g., rounds 2–3) to sample full diversity obtained from the MACS selections (e.g., round 1).",
    "Note: Reducing the antigen concentration in progressive rounds of sorting allows for the separation and selection of nanobodies with higher affinities.\nNote: It is recommended to prepare samples at two different concentrations for sorting. In cases in which enrichment for clones that bind to the antigen is modest, it is recommended that the samples are prepared with the same antigen concentration and a three-fold dilution compared to the previous round. In cases in which enrichment for clones progresses rapidly between rounds, it recommended that the samples are prepared with three-fold and 10-fold reductions in antigen concentration compared to the previous round. Collection of cells from the lower of the two examined antigen concentrations that shows a distinct binding population typically allows for more efficient isolation of nanobodies with increased affinity.\nOptional: Add milk to achieve a final concentration of 1% milk. The presence of milk may help in reducing the collection of nanobodies with poor specificity.\nPost primary incubation, centrifuge the cells in a tabletop centrifuge at 16,000×g for 1 min (room temperature) and discard supernatant.\nWash the cells once by resuspending them in 1 mL ice-cold PBSB.\nCentrifuge the cells in a tabletop centrifuge at 16,000×g for 1 min (room temperature) and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in ice-cold secondary labeling reagents and incubate on ice for 4 min.\nPrepare secondary labeling solution in ice-cold PBSB\nAdd a 1:200 dilution (final concentration of ∼10 μg/mL) of goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor 488 for detection of nanobody expression on yeast surface.\nFor a bivalent antigen (antigen-Fc fusion protein), add a 1:300 dilution (final concentration of ∼5 μg/mL) of goat anti-human Fc IgG AlexaFluor 647 for detection of antigen binding.\nFor a monovalent biotinylated antigen, add a 1:1000 dilution (final concentration of ∼2 μg/mL) of streptavidin AlexaFluor 647 for detection of antigen binding.",
    "Note: Nanobody expression and antigen binding can be detected using different fluorophores. For optimal sorting results, it is recommended to choose fluorophores with minimal overlap in their emission spectra.\nPost-secondary incubation, centrifuge the cells at 16,000xg for 1 min (room temperature) and wash the cells once by resuspending them in 1 mL ice-cold PBSB.\nCentrifuge the cells in a tabletop centrifuge at 16,000×g for 1 min (room temperature) and discard supernatant.\nPlace cells on ice.\nImmediately before loading cells into a cell sorter, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL ice-cold PBSB.\nCritical: Cells should be resuspended immediately prior to sorting in order to prevent dissociation of nanobody-antigen binding. Keep cells and PBSB on ice for use in sorting.\nSort the cells on a cell sorter, such as a Beckman Coulter MoFlo Astrios, under sterile conditions.\nExamine a plot of the forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) of the yeast cells using the 488 nm laser.\nAdjust the FSC and SSC voltages such that the population of cells spread out in a diagonal line (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1369-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. FACS selections incorporating CDR-swapping mutagenesis enable rapid selection of high-affinity nanobodies",
    "The nanobody library is sorted first using MACS (e.g., one MACS sort against monovalent SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, RBD). Next, the enriched library is sorted by FACS against bivalent antigen (e.g., RBD-Fc) at relatively high antigen concentrations, and then it is further sorted by FACS against monovalent antigens (e.g., monovalent RBD) and/or at reduced antigen concentrations. A diagonal gate is drawn during FACS selections to collect yeast cells that bind antigen in a manner that is proportional to nanobody expression to enrich for high-affinity clones. The gates are drawn to minimize the percentage of cells appearing within the gates in the control sample to avoid enrichment of nanobodies that bind the secondary reagents. After several rounds of enriching the library via FACS, yeast plasmid DNA is isolated and CDR-swapping mutagenesis is performed. Finally, additional FACS sorts are performed following CDR-swapping mutagenesis to isolate high-affinity nanobodies.\nDraw a gate surrounding the main population of cells in the plot of FSC versus SSC such that events in the bottom left-hand corner (dead cells and debris) are not included.\nFilter the cells from within the gate on the FSC versus SSC plot into a subplot. This subplot should be used to examine the log area of signal from the fluorophore used to detect nanobody expression on the x-axis and the log area of the signal for the fluorophore used to detect antigen binding on the y-axis.\nAnalyze a control sample to assess nanobody expression and secondary reagent binding. This sample should be labeled with primary and secondary antibodies for detecting nanobody expression as well as secondary reagent for detecting antigen binding.\nAdjust voltages for lasers exciting the fluorophores for detecting nanobody expression and antigen binding.",
    "Adjust the voltage for the laser used for detecting nanobody expression such that two distinct cell populations are observed (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nOne population (left) is cells that do not express nanobodies on their surface.\nThe other population (right) is cells that express nanobodies.\nQuadrants may be drawn to guide distinguishing the nanobody non-expressing and expressing cells.\nAdjust the voltage for the laser used for detecting antigen binding such that signal from this laser is minimal in the control sample.\nVoltage should be adjusted such that the signal is spaced away from the cytogram axis.\nVoltage and quadrants should be adjusted such that minimal signal is seen in the upper two quadrants.\nAnalyze positive samples to assess both nanobody expression and antigen binding. Positive samples should include samples in which cells have been incubated with antigen at desired concentrations and labeled with the secondary reagent for detecting bound antigen. These samples should also be labeled with primary and secondary reagents for detecting antibody expression.\nDraw a gate for cell collection in the upper right-hand quadrant of the cytogram.\nGate should be drawn sufficiently above the horizontal line dividing the quadrants such that a minimal number of cells fall within this gate in the control sample.\nGate should be drawn to have a diagonal slope on the right side.\nCritical: Drawing a collection gate which minimizes the number of cells present in the control sample is critical to avoid enrichment of nanobodies that bind to secondary labeling reagents.\nSort cells and transfer into an 8 mL SDCAA culture.\nSupplement culture with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 100 μg/mL kanamycin, and 0.01× Pen-strep.\nGrow cells in SDCAA culture at 30°C at 225 RPM for 2 d.",
