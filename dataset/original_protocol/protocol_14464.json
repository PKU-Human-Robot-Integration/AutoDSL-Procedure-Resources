    "NOTE: All procedures are performed as individual healing attempts (\"Individueller Heilversuch\"). And comply with the local ethics board (Ethikkommission Heidelberg) as well as national laws regarding individual healing attempts. Patients are extensively informed by the treating physician about the nature of the therapy, the procedures, the risks and benefits. All patients give written informed consent before beginning with the procedure. Individual healing attempts need the approval for reimbursement by the patient's health care service. This has to be obtained by the treating physician before scheduling the procedures.\n1. Indication\nMake a diagnosis of chronic, treatment resistant, trigeminal nociceptive and/or neuropathic pain in one or more unilateral trigeminal branches.\nInclude individuals who fit the following criteria: duration of pain of at least 6 months, and two or more failed attempts of standard medical and/or surgical therapy.\nDocument information on the number and duration of daily attacks as well as the type and dose of pain medication (for both permanent and paroxysmal pain). Assess the quality of life with the SF-36 questionnaire by asking the patient to rate his or her current state.\n\t\tNOTE: SF-36 is a questionnaire that consists of eight domains regarding quality of life (e.g. vitality, physical pain) to be rated on a scale between 0 and 100.\nExclude individuals with any major psychiatric disease (e.g. depression, schizophrenia), medical contraindication, severe medical conditions for surgery and general anesthesia, allergies to titanium or local anesthesia reagents (e.g. Mepivacain).\n2. Trial Electrode Placement\nPlace the patient in supine position and turn his head to the contralateral side of the pain.\nThoroughly disinfect the facial area with a non-colored skin disinfection agent.\nApply sterile drapes around the surgical field to minimize the risk of contamination and infection.",
    "Mark the painful area according to the patient's information with a sterile pen to plan the electrode position and position of the skin puncture.\nPlan the skin puncture no further away than 9 cm (length of the Tuhoy cannula) from the medial border of the painful area.\nFor the first trigeminal branch, choose a position to puncture the skin on the lateral side of the forehead roughly 10 cm lateral and 1 cm above the medial border of the eyebrow.\nFor the second trigeminal branch, choose a position roughly 1 cm anterior of the tragus.\nFor the third trigeminal branch, choose a position that is located roughly 1 cm anterior and 4 cm below the tragus to perform the skin puncture.\nDo not perform a skin puncture 2 or more cm anterior of the tragus to spare facial nerve fibers from injury.\nMark the desired direction of the implanted electrode with a sterile surgical pen for guidance.\nInject 1 mL of a local anesthetic (e.g. 1% Mepivacain) with a 20 G cannula into the subcutaneous tissue at each site of the planned skin puncture and wait several minutes for the local anesthetic effect. Perception of pain is absent, however pressure and movement are still perceived.\nPerform the skin puncture with a 14 G Tuhoy needle at the previously marked position. Place the tip of the Tuhoy cannula roughly 0.5 cm below the skin surface to stay within the subcutaneous tissue.\nWithdraw the needle and repeat step 2.5 in case the patient feels any pain at the site of the skin puncture.\nPush the Tuhoy cannula gently through the subcutaneous tissue in the previously marked direction and aim for the medial border of the painful area.",
    "For the first trigeminal branch, aim towards midline parallel to the eyebrow. For the second trigeminal branch, aim towards the wing of the nose. For the third trigeminal branch, aim towards the chin.\nMake sure to maintain a depth of 0.5 cm and turn the sharp tip of the Tuhoy needle away from the skin to prevent any unintended skin perforation.\nSlightly bend the Tuhoy cannula manually to take the curvature of the skull into account if needed.\nRemove the Tuhoy cannula's stylet and insert the test electrode into the Tuhoy needle. A soft resistance is detected once the electrode reaches the end of the Tuhoy needle.\n\tNOTE: The electrode is 60 cm long and has a diameter of 1.3 mm. Eight contacts for stimulation (each 3 mm long) are arranged in a row with a 6 mm distance in between contacts. The electrode is stabilized by an internal removable stylet.\nRemove the Tuhoy cannula while keeping the electrode in position by gentle pressure towards the medial border of the painful area.\nPull out the electrode's stylet for about 5 cm and insert the contacts into the port of the screening cable connected to the external neurostimulator.\nRepeat steps 2.6-2.10 for each additional electrode.\nStart test stimulation. Inform the patient that once activated a tingling sensation (paresthesia) in the painful area will be perceived.\nUse the physician programmer to activate stimulation.\nApply bipolar stimulation with alternating anodes and cathodes on the contacts (e.g. 1+, 2-, 3+, 4-, 5+, 6-, 7+, 8-) with a frequency of 30-40Hz and a pulse width of 120-180 Âµs.\nIncrease the stimulation amplitude until the patient can easily perceive the stimulation without being painful.\n\tNOTE: Patients usually report perception of stimulation at amplitude of 0.5 to 2 V.",
    "Watch for signs of direct muscle stimulation like ptosis or facial muscle contractions indicating that the electrode is too deeply implanted.\nAsk the patient what percentage of the painful area is covered by paresthesia. Try to achieve an at least 80% paresthesia coverage.\nIncrease the stimulation amplitude and/or pulse width with the physician programmer to enlarge the field of stimulation.\nIn case of direct muscle stimulation and/or insufficient paresthesia coverage, stop stimulation, disconnect the electrode from the screening cable, remove the electrode and repeat steps 2.6-2.13.\nStop stimulation, disconnect the electrode from the screening cable and fully remove the electrode's stylet while keeping the electrode in place with forceps.\nUse the fixation device with the applicator to keep the electrode in place at the site of the skin puncture. Suture it to the skin using a non-absorbable 3-0 silk suture.\nMove the fixation device with the applicator over the distal end of the electrode all the way until it touches the skin surface. Push the lever to apply the fixation piece to the electrode. Remove the applicator.\nSuture the electrode with the fixation device to the patient's skin with two single stitches.\nApply sterile draping at the site of the skin puncture.\nReconnect the electrode to the screening cable.\n3. Stimulation Trial and Assessment of Therapy\nProgram the stimulation regimen.\n\tNOTE: Active contacts, stimulation frequency, pulse width and amplitude are adjusted for optimal pain relief. Stimulation regimens will differ among patients. However, a bipolar stimulation (alternating cathodes and anodes in the electrodes), and a low frequency stimulation (30-40 Hz) are common in most patients.\nInstruct the patient to use the handheld patient controller to turn stimulation on and off and to increase or decrease stimulation.",
    "To switch stimulation on or off and to change stimulation amplitude, activate the handheld patient controller by pushing the on/off button. Place the handheld patient controller on the external pulse generator and press the black \"communicate\" button on the side of the patient controller.\nPress the grey \"stimulation off\" button on the side of the patient controller to turn stimulation off and the white \"stimulation on\" button to turn stimulation on.\nPress the \"+\" and \"-\"button on the front of the patient controller to increase or decrease the stimulation amplitude.\n\t\tNOTE: Information on stimulation amplitude, stimulation status and battery capacity are provided on the patient controller display.\nAsk the patient to continuously stimulate. Instruct to switch the stimulation off for 1 h per day to compare the pain with and without stimulation.\nDischarge the patient for a 12 day ambulatory stimulation trial.\nAssess the effect of the stimulation at the outpatient clinic.\nAsk the patient to rate the pain with and without stimulation with a number between 0 and 10 on the VAS\n\t\tNOTE: A pain reduction of at least 50% on the visual analogue scale (VAS) is regarded as successful trial stimulation. The VAS is a numerical rating scale that ranges from 0 \"no pain\" to 10 \"most pain imaginable\" and is subjective to the patient's assessment. Further measures for success are: reduction of attack frequency of 50% or more, reduction of medication and increase in quality of life. Compare the data with the preoperative status.\nTake A/P (antero-posterior) and lateral x-rays of the skull to document the position of the electrodes for the second procedure14.\nRemove the draping, cut the sutures and remove the test electrodes. Apply new draping after disinfection and inspection of the site of the skin puncture.",
    "In case of successful trial stimulation, schedule an appointment for a procedure to implant electrodes and an internal pulse generator (IPG).\n\tNOTE: Schedule the second surgery 4-6 weeks after the trial electrodes are removed to enable good wound healing, to minimize the risk of infection and to give the patient time to reflect on the amount of pain reduction during the trial stimulation.\nDocument the effective stimulation regimen during the trial stimulation for programming the IPG after the second surgery.\nConnect the physician programmer's antenna with the external pulse generator\nChoose the \"connect\" option on the programmer's display\nGo to the \"Stimulation Settings\" section and document the patient's stimulation regimen in the file.\n4. Implantation of Permanent Electrodes and IPG\nPlace the patient in a supine position under general anesthesia. Turn the head to the contralateral side of the pain. Place a pillow under the ipsilateral shoulder to expose the clavicle.\nAdminister intravenous single shot antibiotics (e.g. 2 g cephazoline) 20 min before the start of the procedure.\nShave the area around the ear of the painful side of the face. Remove any loose hair. If necessary, tape away the surrounding hair to prevent them from moving into the surgical field.\nThoroughly disinfect the surgical field from the facial area, around the ear down to the clavicular area.\nMark the desired position of the permanent electrodes using the x-rays obtained during the outpatient appointment and the marks of the previous skin punctures for guidance.\nApply sterile draping around the entire surgical field.\nPerform the skin puncture with a 14 G Tuhoy cannula and implant the permanent electrodes as previously described for the first trial procedure.\n\tNOTE: Size and length of the electrodes are identical to the trial electrodes (length 60 cm, diameter 1.3 mm, 8 contacts).",
    "Make a 1 cm long vertical incision in the supraauricular area and form a small subcutaneous pocket there.\nInsert the Tuhoy cannula to subcutaneously tunnel from the supraauricular incision to the sites of the skin puncture. Remove the Tuhoy cannula's and the electrode's stylets and insert the distal end of the electrode into the cannula.\n\tNOTE: The third trigeminal branch requires the length of two Tuhoy cannulas and an additional small skin incision in the preauricular area to fully cover the distance.\n\t\nRemove the Tuhoy cannula while keeping the electrode in place with forceps.\nUse a 3-0 non-absorbable silk suture to suture the electrode to the muscle fascia to prevent electrode dislocation.\nIn case the patient wears glasses, fix the electrodes at a position that is located above the frame of the glasses to prevent local pain and skin erosion.\nPerform a 6 cm long infraclavicular incision and manually form a subcutaneous pocket to house the IPG. Use a bipolar electrical forceps to coagulate any bleeding vessels.\nInsert a tunneling spear in the infraclavicular incision and subcutaneously tunnel behind the ear towards the supraauricular incision.\nMake a small retroauricular incision for the spear to exit the skin. Then use a second spear to tunnel from the supraauricular to the retroauricular incision.\nRemove the spears' stylets and insert the electrodes until they are buried in the subcutaneous tissue without any loops or kinks.\nRemove the spear by pulling it out from the infraclavicular incision while keeping the electrodes in place with a forceps.\nPay attention to not penetrate the skin with the tunneling spear (especially in patients that have previously undergone surgery for microvascular decompression as they have a retroauricular scar).\nConnect the electrodes to the IPG and secure them with torque screws.",
    "Suture the IPG to the pectoralis muscle fascia with a non-absorbable silk suture (3-0) to prevent IPG dislocation.\nCheck the system impedance to detect any faulty connection or damaged electrode contacts.\nPlace the antenna of the Physician Programmer in a sterile drape and position it over the IPG. Connect the programmer with the IPG and go to the \"check electrode impedance\" section.\n\t\tNOTE: Low impedances under 250 Ohm indicate open circuits. High impedances over 500 OHM indicate insufficient connection of the electrode to the IPG or electrode breakage.\nPerform skin closure with subcutaneous absorbable 3-0 sutures and non-absorbable 3-0 cutaneous sutures in the facial area and absorbable intracutaneous sutures at the site of the IPG.\nDisinfect all wounds, clean the surgical field with saline and apply sterile draping.\n5. Postoperative Care\nNOTE: The patient is transferred to the ward to be observed overnight and is given oral analgesic medication.\nProgram the IPG using the stimulation regimen of the trial stimulation (see 3.8).\nPlace the Physician Programmer's antenna on the skin over the IPG and choose the \"connect\" option to communicate with the neurostimulator.\nInsert the stimulation regimen documented at the end of the trial stimulation in the \"stimulation settings\" section.\nAdjust the stimulation settings according to the patient's statements regarding the paresthesia coverage. Increase amplitude and/or pulse width to achieve a wider field of stimulation. Decrease amplitude and/or pulse width in case of painful stimulation of direct muscle stimulation.\nProvide the patient with a personal patient controller as during the trial stimulation to enable him or her to switch stimulation on or off or to change the stimulation amplitude.\nIf a rechargeable IPG is implanted, instruct the patients on how to check the battery capacity with their handheld device and how to perform the recharging procedure.",
    "NOTE: Patients receive oral prophylactic postoperative antibiotics (e.g. 960 mg trimethoprime sulfamethoxazole twice daily) for 5 days.\nDischarge the patient on the day after surgery.\nRemove sutures seven days after the surgery in the outpatient clinic.\nMake follow-up appointments 4 and 12 weeks after surgery to assess the stimulation effect and to change stimulation settings if needed.\nSubscription Required.
