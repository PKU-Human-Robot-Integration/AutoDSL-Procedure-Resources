    "The experimental protocol was previously approved by the Ethics Committee of the University's School of Health Sciences (EC.ECTS/P10.21). Procedures fully respected the principles of good clinical practice defined for human research13. A convenient sample of six healthy participants of both sexes (n = 3 per sex) with a mean age of 32.8 ± 11.9 years old was chosen from the university community. Selected participants were required to be normotensive, non-smokers, and free of any medication or food supplementation. Blood pressure, cardiac frequency, and the Body Mass Index were also registered. All participants were previously informed of the objectives and duration of the study and provided informed written consent.\nNOTE: This study was performed using the MSOTAcuity (see Table of Materials), henceforth referenced as the optoacoustic imaging platform.\n1. Preparation for Acquisition\nNOTE: In the experimental description that follows, screen commands are in Boldface type.\nLoading subject information: Turn on the optoacoustic imaging equipment. While the equipment is warming up, introduce the participant information. The main welcome window of the software opens to the Scan overview. Introduce data (including name, the study denomination, personal data, and any relevant observations) after clicking on Patient ID, and finish the application by pressing Select.\nPreset selection: Make sure the Laser is Ready message appears on the equipment screen. Following the warmup time, the laser status bar on the equipment screen must change from Laser Standby to Laser is Ready. For this protocol, the preset is designed for chromophores Hb, HbO2, and melanin. After selecting the correct preset, the laser power will be tested.",
    "At this point, ensure that there is a message on the screen that reminds every participant in the room to apply laser safety googles. Press the laser (power) switch foot pedal and wait for the laser power self-check. After a few seconds, a window appears with the current laser status with a check-up report. Release this window by pressing the available OK button.\n\tNOTE: The optoacoustic imaging platform uses a Nd:YAG laser, considered a class 4 laser particularly dangerous to the human eye. Thus, this laser must be handled with adequate care.\n\t​CAUTION: No acquisition should take place without ensuring all safety procedures, including appropriate eye protection, are in place.\n2. Positioning and Image Acquisition\nAcclimatize the participant to the laboratory environment (21 °C ± 1 °C; 40%-60% relative humidity), choosing a comfortable position to minimize unnecessary movement. Ensure that the area to be scanned is previously cleaned.\n\tNOTE: The manufacturer's recommendation to clean the area to be imaged with a 70% ethanol/water solution is recommended. Additionally, for best image acquisition, removal of hair (when applicable) is suggested.\nProbe holder and image stabilization\n\t\nApply a thin layer of ultrasound gel to the 3D cup. Image stabilization requires holding the 3D cup in the desired imaging position. Position and stabilize a lockable arm for the area of interest. The arm used in this study was designed in-house and built with aluminum profile components (Figure 1).\nAfter placing the 3D cup on the area of interest, partially lock the stabilizing arm lock for image acquisition.\n\t\tNOTE: The quality and even application of the ultrasound gel is critical; the presence of air-bubbles may compromise the image definition.\nImage acquisition for dynamic conditions, using the Post-Occlusive Reactive Hyperemia (PORH) maneuver, in the Examination menu tab.",
    "Acquire the baseline control scan. After finding a field of view for imaging, with the deflated blood pressure cuff in place, securely lock the 3D cup positioning arm.\nApply minimal pressure to the imaging site, as higher pressures might compromise the readouts. Push the manufacturer's default preset Hb, HbO2, and Melanin that simultaneously measures chromophores for Hb, HbO2, and melanin.\n\t\tCAUTION: It is mandatory to protect the eyes with proper safety goggles during operation.\n\t\tNOTE: Skin phototypes IV to VI (dark skin) are prone to misreading, requiring a baseline control image for further processing. The use of safety goggles during image acquisition (when the laser is active) only allows the human eye to recognize yellow and blue colors. Colors can be edited during image processing.\nSelect the anatomical area for baseline image acquisition. For exploratory purposes, the ventral forearm is recommended. Proceed by pressing the laser footswitch pedal.\n\t\tNOTE: The touch screen button labeled View (colored yellow), which shows the live image on the screen when pressed. The image stability status is shown as a grey bar in the middle of the touch screen, indicating the stability of the 3D probe.\n\t\t\nWhen the image stability is maximized, take (or capture) a snapshot of the area by pressing the Snapshot button on the touchscreen. Each scan will acquire 10-12 frames at an acoustic depth of 150 mm for every wavelength defined within the preset over an acquisition time of 2 s. This baseline acquisition scan will include a total of 30-36 frames.\n\t\t\tNOTE: 10 frames for each chromophore detected (Hb, HbO2, and melanin) are collected with a maximal depth of 15 mm.",
    "Continue pressing the laser footswitch pedal for continuous video acquisition and pay attention to the View button (colored yellow) on the touch screen. The stabilized image will appear. Press Record (colored blue) to begin live image recording.\nStop the recording by pressing the Stop button (colored black). The optoacoustic imaging platform will stop recording and automatically render the video to preview mode.\nDynamic measurements (PORH illustration): Adjust the pressure cuff to the patient's arm above the elbow to illustrate this maneuver. Inflate the cuff with supra systolic pressure (~200 mmHg) and proceed according to steps 2.3.1 to 2.3.3.1 to acquire the imaged vasculature under pressure.\nTo acquire a video to assess the impact of the pressure release on the imaged vasculature, open the pressure valve while acquiring the video as in 2.3.3.2. As before, follow the live image on the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: To execute this maneuver, supra systolic pressure should be maintained for 1-5 min; it is important to be aware that this pressure might induce different degrees of tolerance and discomfort in the patient. This aspect should be carefully managed during the experiments.\n3. Image analysis protocol\nCopy the recorded scans to a selected/dedicated folder for backup and further analysis on a separate computer workstation using the manufacturer's dedicated analytical software. Each scan is stored by acquisition time and ordered by the program in a study folder with a running code.\n\tNOTE: A backup copy is strongly recommended. Working directly with the recorded raw data is possible but strongly discouraged, as any potential hard drive crash might damage the raw data.",
    "Open the analysis program on the workstation computer. Choose program Menu > Open Study to import files and access backup scans. Open the study and scroll to the bottom of the folder (with recorded scans) to find files with a .NOD extension. This is the only file type recognized by the software to open a study.\n\tNOTE: .NOD files are named automatically with a running number given to each study and carry no patient information in the file name.\nFor image reconstruction, open the image analysis module by accessing the software Menu > Advanced processing.\n\t\nEnsure that the program workflow tabs are visible (colored black) on the top menu bar (Supplementary Figure 1): Menu; Scan Overview; Reconstruction; Fluence Correction; Spectral Unmixing; Visualization & Analysis. During analysis, any activated workflow tab is colored blue.\n\t\tNOTE: If Advance Processing is not opened, the software shows only Scan Overview and Visualization & Analysis.\nReconstruct the image via the Reconstruction tab of the software. Select the scans to reconstruct from the left side of the main program menu. Loaded scans appear on the right side of the screen. Leave the default six optoacoustic emission wavelengths (700, 730, 760, 800, 850, and 900 nm), as they include the maximum optoacoustic signal for HbO2 at 900 nm, for Hb at 760 nm, and melanin at 700 nm.\n\t\nPerform the scan reconstruction using the icon on the right side. Follow the program workflow by selecting the Scan preset and Field of View (resolution). Information is presented at the top left corner of the main screen. Adjust the speed of sound to adjust scan focus (Supplementary Figure 2). The Reconstruction panel also shows the number of frames of each acquired scan and allows the selection of the repetitions to be analyzed (if necessary).",
    "NOTE: Each scan is loaded with a default speed of sound of -90, which should be adjusted by the user. The speed of sound may also be adjusted automatically with an auto-focus function (AF).\nPush the button Reconstruct Scans at the top of the screen to advance to scan reconstruction. A temporary dashboard will appear with the message Job Processing. This panel can also be accessed from the Menu > Processing Status. After finishing the reconstruction, the image post-processing analysis must advance to Fluence Correction.\nActivate Fluence Correction of reconstructed images in the dashboard menu. Reconstructed images must be loaded for fluence correction. These appear with a flag next to each scan number. Loaded files will be immediately displayed on the right side of the screen as Selected Reconstructions. Activate Fluence Correction by interacting with the icon on the right side of the screen (Supplementary Figure 3). Push the Save Fluence Correction(s) to progress.\nAfter saving the fluence correction, perform the spectral unmixing of the acquired preset (Hb, HbO2, and melanin). Select the Spectral Unmixing tab to open the list of Selected Reconstructions for spectral unmixing. A list with each scan of the selected study will be displayed with the history of the previous image processing steps.\nLoad the previously saved fluence correction files. Loaded scans will be immediately displayed on the right side of the screen as Selected Reconstructions (Supplementary Figure 4). Activate spectral unmixing by pushing the icon on the right side of the screen.\n\t\nObserve the wavelengths to be unmixed. All six optoacoustic emission wavelengths (700, 730, 760, 800, 850, and 900 nm) taken into the reconstruction step (step 3.4) are automatically chosen for spectral unmixing. Edit the desired spectra to be processed (e.g., Spectra: Hb, HbO2, and melanin) using the XYZ icon, if necessary.",
    "After confirming the adjusted parameters, click on Start Spectral Unmixing for the spectral unmixing to progress. A processing menu bar appears, displaying the operation progress.\n\t\tNOTE: Various parameter adjustments are possible during spectral unmixing, and several unmixing methods are available. In this protocol, the Linear Regression method is used as a standard to unmix Hb, HbO2, and melanin.\nAccess the Visualization and Analysis tab. Click an activated scan to display all subject information and comments introduced in step 1.1 (Supplementary Figure 5).\n\tNOTE: Multiple scans may be visualized in parallel.\n\t\nPush the + button to create a multiple scan analysis. In this window, introduce a multiple scan view and press the Save button. After saving the view name, a new dashboard is displayed, including all the scans of the study being analyzed.\nSelect each desired scan to Add (each) to the saved Analysis View. Add additional scans at the top left corner icon, and they will be automatically displayed in the Analysis View.\nWithin the analysis view, set proper color lookup tables to prepare the image for analysis. Click More Image Control Options on the top menu bar and activate the Max Intensity Projection icon. Attribute colors to layers by pressing the icon available in the bottom right corner of the image display, adjacent to the 2D+ image display.\nSelect More to edit the colors of all channels simultaneously. This menu shows all chromophores unmixed and allows the selection of multiple layers for display.\n\tNOTE: Moving the mouse over the software icons shows their name in gray as displayed in the protocol.\nAdjust each layer's color intensity with the tools available at the bottom left of the screen.\n\t​NOTE: Adjustment with min/max interpolation for each channel generally yields good results.\n4. Region of Interest (ROI) analysis",
    "NOTE: The selection of a Region of Interest (ROI) is mandatory for data analysis.\nIdentify the ROI to be analyzed. Surround the ROI with the shapes available (within the menu bar) in the XY image while tracing the same ROI within the orthogonal views available in the XZ and YZ axis (Supplementary Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: A polygon shape was used for the current ROI analysis.\n\t\nFollow the ROI shape in the remaining XZ and YZ axis (example in Figure 2) while placing multiple polygon layers with the Add Interpolate and Remove sub-regions function. The data can be plotted after defining/selecting the desired ROI.\nPress the icon Import Region of Interest to Quantification and observe the multi spectra component shown on the right side of the screen as a graphical detail of the selected ROI.\nExport ROI data by pressing the Excel icon at the bottom of the graphical view of the ROI data. The entire data package from all regions is exported as a bundle to a spreadsheet for subsequent analysis. Figure 3 shows data from one participant who submitted to a pressure cuff inflated to 200 mmHg and vasculature was analyzed in comparison to vasculature resting state at 0 mmHg.\nQuantify multiple ROI objects simultaneously by following steps 4.1-4.1.3.\nExport images from the same menu as TIFF files with all embedded data and built-in ROI outline (Figure 2).\nSubscription Required.
