    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province.\n1. Preparation of the DC-ECM hydrogel\nNOTE: In this study, the cartilage was obtained from the knee joints of 12 month old Bama miniature pigs, avoiding the collection of bone tissue.\nTake the collected cartilage, and block and chop it into 1-2 mm3 pieces with a scalpel.\nPlace 20 g of the minced cartilage in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and add 20 mL of hypotonic Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) to submerge the tissue completely. Place the centrifuge tube in a −80 °C freezer for 3 h and then in a 37 °C oven for 3 h. Repeat the freezing and heating step six times. In this step, the hypotonic Tris-HCl buffer does not need replacement.\nShake the centrifuge tube for 30 s using a vortex mixer at a speed of 1,000 rpm. Place a stainless-steel sieve (pore size: ~250 µm) on a new 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nSlowly decant the decellularized cartilage into the stainless-steel sieve, wash the tissue three times with sterile PBS, and collect the cartilage.\nAdd 10 mL of trypsin solution (0.25% trypsin in PBS), and place the tube on a shaker at 37 °C for 24 h. During this period, replace the trypsin every 4 h. Filter the suspension using the stainless-steel sieve, and preserve the tissue. The trypsin can be treated overnight during one of the digestion processes, and this will not affect the final digestion.\nWash the trypsinized tissue with hypertonic buffer (1.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6).\nAdd 10 mL of nuclease solution (50 U/mL deoxyribonuclease and 1 U/mL ribonuclease in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and place the tube on a shaker at 37 °C for 4 h.",
    "Remove the nuclease solution, wash the cartilage three times with sterile PBS, and add hypotonic Tris-HCl solution. Place the centrifuge tube on a shaker, and rinse for 20 h at room temperature (RT).\nRemove the hypotonic Tris-HCl solution, wash the cartilage three times with sterile PBS, and add 1% Triton X-100 solution to submerge the tissue for 24 h.\nRemove the Triton X-100 solution, and thoroughly rinse the decellularized cartilage with distilled water for 3 days, changing the distilled water every 12 h.\nSoak the cartilage in peracetic acid solution (0.1% PAA in 4% ethanol) for 4 h. Remove the peracetic acid solution, and wash the cartilage three times with sterile distilled water.\nPlace the stainless-steel sieve (pore size: ~250 µm) on a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Slowly decant the decellularized cartilage into the stainless-steel sieve, and collect the cartilage. Test the degree of decellularization and the matrix retention of the cartilage by estimating the DNA, collagen, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content.\nPut the decellularized cartilage into a grinding bowl, add liquid nitrogen, and grind the decellularized cartilage to form a powder. Take 2 g of the decellularized cartilage powder, add 80 mL of 0.5 M acetic acid and 20 mg of pepsin, and digest for 24 h. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min; discard the sediment, and collect the supernatant solution (DC-ECM solution).\nDecant 1 mL of DC-ECM solution per well into 6-well plates. Place the 6-well plates in a lyophilizer. Freeze the DC-ECM solution. Once the temperature in the freeze-dryer drops to −40 °C, turn on the vacuum pump, and maintain the vacuum degree at 10 Pa for 22 h.",
    "Take out the freeze-dried DC-ECM solution, place it in centrifuge tubes, and store at −20 °C. The minimum storage period of freeze-dried DC-ECM solution exceeds half a year.\nAdd 1 mL of sterile distilled water to dissolve 20 mg of freeze-dried DC-ECM solution in the centrifuge tube. Shake for 1 min using a vortex mixer at a speed of 1,000 rpm at RT. Add 1 mg of vitamin B2 (0.1% w/v) to the DC-ECM solution, incubate at 37 °C for 60 min, and irradiate with UV light (370 nm, 3.5 mW/cm2) for 3 min to form a hydrogel (DC-ECM hydrogel).\n2. Detection of decellularized cartilage\nDNA content detection of decellularized cartilage\n\tNOTE: Extract the DNA using the DNEasy Blood & Tissue Kit.\n\t\nFirst, take 20 mg of DC-ECM cartilage in a centrifuge tube. Add 180 µL of Buffer GTL and 20 µL of Proteinase K by vortex oscillation, and incubate the cartilage at 56 °C for 4 h until it is completely dissolved.\nShake the centrifuge tube for 15 s using a vortex mixer at a speed of 1,000 rpm at RT. Next, add 200 µL of Buffer GL and anhydrous ethanol, and thoroughly mix by vortex vibration. Centrifuge the samples for 1 min at a speed of 6,000 x g at 4 °C.",
    "Add 500 µL of Buffer GW1 to the adsorption column, and centrifuge the samples for 1 min at a speed of 12,000 x g at 4 °C. Add 500 µL of Buffer GW2 to the adsorption column, and centrifuge at 20,000 x g at 4 °C for 1 min. Finally, add 50 µL of sterilized water to the adsorption column, and centrifuge for 1 min at a speed of 6,000 x g at 4 °C to collect the DNA solution. Determine the DNA content using a spectrophotometer.\nCollagen content detection in the decellularized cartilage\n\t\nTo detect the collagen content in the decellularized cartilage, use hydroxyproline as a collagen amino acid marker. Acidify 5 mg of decellularized cartilage with 5 mL of 6 M hydrochloric acid at 100 °C for 20 min, and then neutralize it with 5 mL of a 6 M sodium hydroxide solution.\nCalculate the content of hydroxyproline by measuring the absorbance of the sample at 570 nm with a spectrophotometer. Obtain a concentration-absorption linear regression using the standard hydroxyproline sample.\nGAG content detection in the decellularized cartilage\n\tNOTE: The GAG content in the DC-ECM cartilage was detected using a tissue GAG colorimetric quantitative detection kit. All the reagents below are available in the kit.\n\t\nTake 200 mg of DC-ECM cartilage powder, and add 500 µL of Reagent A by vortex oscillation. Incubate the sample at 4 °C for 16 h, and then centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 min.\nTake 50 mL of sample solution, and add 50 µL of high-salt solution (Reagent B) and 50 µL of acid solution(Reagent C) by vortex oscillation. Incubate the sample for 10 min.",
    "Add 750 µL of dye solution (Reagent D) by vortex oscillation, and incubate the sample for 30 min in dark conditions. Centrifuge the sample at 14,000 x g for 10 min, and then discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 µL of cleaning solution (Reagent E), and mix well. Centrifuge the sample at 14,000 x g for 10 min, and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 µL of dissociation solution (Reagent F) to the sample, and mix well. Incubate the sample for 30 min under dark conditions. Finally, determine the GAG content using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm.\nScanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis of the decellularized cartilage\n\t\nCompare the decellularized cartilage and normal cartilage tissue. Place the sample in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution, incubate at 4 °C overnight and then wash with PBS three times.\nFix the sample in 1% OsO4 for 1 h, and then wash three times with PBS.\nDehydrate the sample by sequential immersion in 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol, as well as 100% acetone for 15 min each.Place the sample in a mixed solution of hexamethyldisilazane and ethanol (1:1) for 15 min, followed by immersion in pure hexamethyldisilazane for 15 min.\nPlace the sample in an HCP-2 dryer, and then dry using liquid nitrogen. Then, coat the fully dried specimen with a thin layer of gold-palladium using sputter coating, and image using SEM. The sputter coating was performed at a power of 120 W for 5 min. The experiment was carried out under the following conditions: a working voltage of 15 kV, and a vacuum degree lower than 5 x 10−5 Pa.",
    "For the TEM analysis, place the sample in a mixture of anhydrous acetone and resin (1:1) for 1 h, followed by a mixture of anhydrous acetone and resin (1:3) for 3 h. Then, place the sample in resin overnight.\n\t\t\nPlace the sample in embedding medium-filled capsules, and heat at 70 °C for 9 h.\nAfter embedding, cut the specimen into 70 nm thin slices using an ultrafine microtome, and place on a copper mesh.\nPipet 20 µL of uranyl acetate staining solution onto the copper mesh, and stain for 15 min at RT. Remove the staining solution by gently washing the mesh twice with distilled water.\nThen, pipet 20 µL of lead citrate staining solution onto the copper mesh, and stain for 15 min at RT. Wash the mesh three times with distilled water.\nPlace the copper mesh onto a clean Petri dish lined with filter paper. After air-drying, photograph the sections using TEM. The probe was applied with a downward force of 500 nN, scanned at a rate of 1 Hz, and had an elastic constant (k-value) of 40 Nm-1. The radius of the probe tip was measured to be 8 nm.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
