    "1. Preparation or Procurement of Stock Solutions (to Be Stored at Room Temperature or Frozen until Use)\nPrepare a 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) stock solution by dissolving 400 mg NaOH in 10 mL ultrapure water at room temperature, and mixing the materials well.\n\tNOTE: Ultrapure water is defined as water without impurities such as particulates, bacteria, nucleases, ions, or traces of organics. A purification system is used to obtain the ultrapure water, resulting in its resistivity of up to 18.2 mΩ·cm, indicating a low anionic contamination. The use of commercially available bottled ultrapure water is not recommended. Henceforth, this ultrapure water will be referred to as water, unless otherwise specified.\nPrepare a 6M NaOH stock solution by dissolving 2.4 g of NaOH in 10 mL of water, and store the solution at room temperature.\nPrepare a 250 mM stock solution of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) by dissolving 1 g of dried HAuCl4 in 10.16 mL of water. Dilute 1 mL of 250 mM HAuCl4 with 9 mL water to obtain working concentration of 25 mM HAuCl4. Store the HAuCl4 solution at room temperature.\nPrepare a 0.1 M carbonate buffer at pH 8.8, by dissolving 84 mg sodium bicarbonate in 10 mL water and adjusting the pH to 8.8 by adding 6 M NaOH from step 1.2. Store the carbonate buffer at room temperature.\nMix 20 mL of tetrazolium compound, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS), with a stabilizing agent, phenazine ethosulfate (PES) (see Table of Materials). Store the MTS/PES mixture in aliquots (for a maximum of 10 freeze-thaw cycles) at -20 °C in dark.\n2. Synthesis of the Gold Nanoparticle Cores\nPrepare a diluted THPC solution by adding 12 µL of 80% THPC in water to 1 mL of water in a microcentrifuge tube at room temperature.",
    "Secure a 100-mL round bottom flask over the center of a magnetic stir plate. Pour 45 mL of water into the flask and stir the water at 300 rpm using a small egg-shaped magnetic stir bar. Add 0.5 mL of 1 M NaOH and 1 mL of diluted THPC solution. Continue to stir the reaction mixture vigorously for 5 min.\nContinue stirring the mixture and add 2 mL of 25 mM HAuCl4 solution. The color of the mixture will change from yellow to dark brown within seconds, indicating the formation of THPC capped AuNPs with a negative charge. Stir the mixture for an additional 15 min to allow for complete formation of the gold cores.\n3. Addition of the Polymer Corona Around the Gold Nanoparticles\nDuring the 15 min period described in step 2.3, prepare the PEG solutions by dissolving each of the following in 1 mL water in 4 mL glass vials: 30 mg NH2-PEG-SH; 7.5 mg m-PEG-SH; 7.5 mg COOH-PEG-SH.\n\tNOTE: The resulting concentrations should be 8.8 M NH2-PEG-SH, 3.75 M m-PEG-SH, and 3.75 M COOH-PEG-SH.\nAfter reducing the stirring speed of the solution in the round bottom flask to 100 rpm, add the PEG solutions to the solution of THPC capped AuNPs dropwise. Continue to stir the mixture gently overnight, at room temperature, to ensure efficient removal of THPC and the replacement by PEG.\nFor the next 72 h, use a 12-14 kDa molecular weight cutoff cellulose membrane to dialyze the stirred mixture against a 4 L bucket of water stirred at 60 rpm. Tie the ends of the membranes by dialysis clips and transfer the solution via pipette.\n\tNOTE: This dialysis process with the 12-14 kDa cutoff membrane only removes unreacted PEG, THPC, and other chemical reactants, by diffusion along a concentration gradient.",
    "To maintain high concentration gradient and promote continuous diffusion, change the water every 2 h for the first 6 h and every 6-12 h for the remaining 66 h.\n\tNOTE: The purpose of this water change schedule is to accommodate the rapid diffusion that occurs early on, because of the initially high concentration within the sample. The dialysis process described above leaves the nanoparticle solution semi-purified, because the nanoparticles, precipitates, aggregates, and other large size impurities cannot pass through the pores of the 12-14 kDa cutoff membrane.\nFilter the semi-purified nanoparticle solution into a 50-mL conical tube using a 0.2 µm syringe filter to remove the remaining precipitates, aggregates, and other large size impurities.\nPlace the conical tube in a -80 °C freezer and allow the purified PEGylated AuNP (PEG-AuNP) solution to freeze for about 5 h.\nUse a freeze dryer to lyophilize the purified PEG-AuNP.\nStore the dry, purified PEG-AuNP at 4 °C until use.\n4. Conjugating Fluorophores using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) Ester onto the NH2 Groups on the PEG-AuNP\nSecure a 50-mL round bottom flask over the center of a magnetic stir plate. Fill the flask with 18 mL of water and stir the water at 100 rpm using an egg-shaped magnetic stir bar.\nWeigh 2 mg of the lyophilized PEG-AuNP in a 4 mL conical tube, using a high precision benchtop scale. Use an anti-static gun to eliminate static charge and clinging of the PEG-AuNP powder to the tube surface. Add 2 mL of water to the tube. Pour the 2 mL PEG-AuNP solution into the round bottom flask for further reconstitution in a total of 20 mL of water. Continue to stir the mixture at 100 rpm using an egg-shaped magnetic stir bar.",
    "Add 1 mL of 0.1 M, pH 8.8 carbonate buffer to the 20 mL of reconstituted AuNP contained in the round bottom flask. Continue stirring.\nAdd 5 µL of 10 mg/mL fluorescent NHS ester in dimethyl sulfoxide.\n\tNOTE: Any fluorescent dye can be used in this process. Stir the fluorescent PEG overnight. Keep it at room temperature and covered in foil.\nFor the next 72 h, remove excess fluorophores using the protocol described in step 3.3. Briefly, dialyze the stirred mixture using a 4 L bucket of water and a 12-14 kDa molecular weight cutoff cellulose membrane. Change the water every 2 h for the first 6 h and every 6-12 h for the remaining 66 h.\nObtain 1 mL of the purified fluorescent PEG-AuNP solution, to be used for characterization described below in section 5. Freeze and lyophilize the remaining solution to obtain fluorescent nanoparticles in powdered form for storage at 4 °C, as described in steps 3.5-3.7.\nUse a 0.2 µm syringe filter to sterilize and remove any potential precipitates once reconstituted for cell culture applications.\n5. Characterization of Fluorescent PEGylated Gold Nanoparticles\nUsing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the gold nanoparticle core and quantify the sizes\n\t\nDrop 10 µL of the purified fluorescent PEG-AuNP solution onto a carbon coated mesh TEM grid.\nAfter 5 min, use a piece of filter paper to carefully wick away excess liquid from the edge of the TEM grid until a film containing the fluorescent PEG-AuNPs is left behind.\nView the fluorescent PEG-AuNPs at 80 kV and at a magnification of 50,000-150,000. Take digital pictures.\n\t\tNOTE: Only the gold core will be visible because the PEG is not electron dense on the TEM.",
    "Using a measuring software, set the measurement scale in correlation to the scale bar. Calculate the diameters of approximately 20 gold cores, and then determine the average gold core diameter.\n\t\tNOTE: The TEM imaging system automatically places a scale bar on the digital pictures.\nMeasurement of hydrodynamic nanoparticle size using dynamic light scattering (DLS)\n\t\nTransfer 1 mg of lyophilized THPC-coated AuNPs into a microcentrifuge tube using the approach described in step 4.2. Transfer 1 mg of lyophilized PEG-AuNP in a separate tube. Add 1 mL of water to each tube and transfer each AuNP solution to a 1 mL clear plastic.\nPlace a cuvette into a DLS instrument and measure spherical hydrodynamic diameters using the particle analyzer software that is built into the DLS system.\nPlot the measured hydrodynamic diameters using a histogram format.\n\t\tNOTE: The histogram will group nanoparticles by size. The largest group of nanoparticles will clarify the diameter that best describes the size of the AuNPs synthesized in this protocol.\nFluorometric fluorescence confirmation\n\tNOTE: The same sample and cuvette from step 5.2 can be used to measure fluorescent signal.\n\t\nRemove the cuvette from the DLS and insert into a spectrofluorometer. Set the excitation wavelength to 633 nm and read the emitted fluorescence signals along a wavelength range of 650-800 nm.\nConfirm that the peak is approximately 665 nm, which correlates to the emission peak for NHS.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust the excitation and emission wavelengths according to the fluorophore used in the process.\nMTS assay11 to assess biocompatibility\n\t\nIn a 96-well clear bottom sterile tissue culture treated plate, pipette 100 µL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and 3.2 x 103 cells into each well.",
    "NOTE: In this study, rat fat pad endothelial cells are used. A total of 21 wells are used to allow for 3 replicates for each of the 7 different nanoparticle concentrations (see step 5.4.3 for specific concentrations of interest).\nAllow the cells to grow to confluency in humidity and 5% CO2 controlled incubators at 37 °C11.\nPrepare individual microcentrifuge tubes, each containing 300 µL of DMEM with nanoparticles of various concentrations. This study requires 7 different tubes of DMEM with the following PEG-AuNP concentrations: 0 µg/mL, 10 µg/mL, 50 µg/mL, 100 µg/mL, 250 µg/mL, 500 µg/mL, and 1,000 µg/mL.\nAspirate the DMEM from the tube. Fill the wells in triplicate with 100 µL of DMEM media containing 0, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, or 1,000 µg/mL of AuNP.\nAllow the cells and nanoparticles to co-incubate for a pre-determined length of time, here for 16 h.\nNear the end of the incubation period, thaw the MTS/PES mixture from step 1.5.\nAfter incubation, aspirate the DMEM and the suspended, loosely attached nanoparticles from the wells. Add 100 µL of fresh DMEM along with 20 µL of MTS/PES solution to obtain 1:5 MTS/PES to DMEM ratio according to the manufacturer's protocol. Incubate the cells with MTS/PES at 37 °C for 2 h.\n\t\tNOTE: This 2 h incubation time is determined by the metabolic activity of endothelial cells and can be increased to up to 4 h for other cell types. Within the 2 h period, the MTS is metabolized by the endothelial cells into colored formazan that mixes with the DMEM. Biocompatibility of PEG-AuNP and the likelihood of cell viability will be demonstrated with more colored formazan. Toxicity of PEG-AuNP and the chance that the cells are dying will be shown with less intense color.",
    "Perform colorimetric analysis of each well by reading absorbance at 492 nm with a compatible plate reader.\nFor each nanoparticle concentration, calculate the average absorbance from triplicate absorbance values. Divide the average absorbance by the value obtained from averaging absorbance in wells containing 0 µg/mL nanoparticles.\n\t\tNOTE: These wells that contain no AuNPs serve as controls for calculating percentage cell viability in response to nanoparticle treatment administered in other wells.\nFluorescence confocal microscopy assessment of nanoparticle uptake in adherent endothelial cells with intact or dysfunctional glycocalyx11\nSeed 1.0 x 104 cells/cm2 rat fat pad endothelial cells onto sterile 12 mm glass coverslips and feed cells with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Allow the cells to grow to full confluency in humidity and CO2 controlled incubators at 37 °C, for approximately 3 days.\nAdd treatments to modify the glycocalyx, if applicable. For example, 2 h treatment of the cultured endothelial cells with 2.5 x 10-6 IU heparinase III enzyme degrades the glycocalyx by specifically cleaving its heparan sulfate component.\n\t\tNOTE: Healthy glycocalyx can be modeled by growing the endothelial cells as described in step 5.5.1 without the addition of degradation enzymes.\nWith the endothelial glycocalyx left intact or rendered dysfunctional, incubate the endothelial cells with fluorescent AuNPs at 550 µg/mL for 16 h or other desired time.\nGently wash the cells with 2 mL of 37 °C 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; containing 100 mg/L calcium and 100 mg/L magnesium). Submerge the cells in 2 mL of 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, and allow the cells to fix for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemove the aldehyde fixing solution and wash the cells with room temperature PBS for three 5-min cycles.",
    "Prior to primary antibody application, expose endothelial cells to 2% goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature to block non-specific binding sites. Cells must be fully covered by the blocking solution.\nIncubate endothelial cells overnight with 1% anti-heparan sulfate primary antibody in 2% goat serum in PBS in 4 °C to label the heparan sulfate component of the glycocalyx. Ensure that the fixed cells are fully in contact with the antibody solution.\nThe next day, wash out the antibody with room temperature PBS for three 10 min cycles.\nIncubate the endothelial cells with 1:1,000 dilution of the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark or covered with aluminum foil.\nWash out the secondary antibody with room temperature PBS for three 10 min cycles.\nMount the coverslip onto microscope slides using an anti-fade mounting medium containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) for nuclei staining. Seal the edges of the coverslip using nail polish.\nImage the fluorescent immunostained endothelial cell samples with confocal microscopy, using blue, green, and far red channels to visualize the nuclei, heparan sulfate glycocalyx, and the nanoparticles, respectively."
