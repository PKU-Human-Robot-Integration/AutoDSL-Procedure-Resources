    "1. Preparation of larvae\nTwo or more days before beginning the assay, set up crosses of the desired experimental and control combinations (minimum 20 females and 10 males each) in egg-lay dishes as described by Wieschaus and Nusslein-Volhard 13 but using 50 mL polypropylene beakers and 6.0 cm disposable Petri dishes containing grape agar and smeared with yeast paste just before use. Keep flies in egg-lay dishes in darkness at room temperature until needed.\nGrape agar recipe – combine 100 mL frozen 100% grape juice concentrate, 350 mL deioinized water, 5 mL glacial acetic and 13 g D. melanogaster agar in a 1L glass beaker. Microwave in 1-2 min bursts, stirring between bursts, until agar is all dissolved. Cool the solution for a few minutes then add 10 mL of 10% (w/v) of Nipagen (methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate) in 95% ethanol. Mix, then pipette 7 mL per plate into disposable 6.0 cm Petri dishes, allow to gel and dry at room temperature for 3-4 h. Store at 4 0C in plastic bags.\nYeast paste recipe – 7 g dried yeast, 10 mL deionized water, mix with a spatula until uniform consistency.\nTimed egg collections to generate experimental and control larvae. Using new, yeast-smeared, grape plates, collect eggs at room temperature for 4 h in darkness during the morning hours. Remove these 4 h collection plates and replace with fresh plates. Incubate the 4 h collection plates overnight at 25 0C until the afternoon of the next day, when most of the larvae will have hatched. Collect these first instar larvae and use them to set up the experiment.\n2. Setting up assay plates",
    "Preparation of assay plates. For a single run of the assay, prepare five assay plates each of 10 experimental larvae and five plates of 10 control larvae. Use a 1.5 cm cork borer to remove a central core of agar from each plate creating a hole for the food. Put yeast paste (0.8 - 0.9 g) into the hole and pat gently with a spatula to make a mound filling the hole.\nAgar plate preparation – combine 700 mL deionized water with 16 g D. melanogaster agar in a 2L glass beaker and microwave for 5 min. Remove from microwave and stir with a glass rod to bring undissolved agar into the solution. Add 17.5 mL of 10% (w/v) Nipagen in 95% ethanol, mix, then continue microwave heating in 30 s bursts followed by stirring, until all agar is completely dissolved. Cool for a minute or two, then pipette 15 mL aliquots into 10 cm plastic Petri dishes. Allow agar to gel, cover plates with lids and let them dry at room temperature for a few hours or overnight. Store plates in sealed plastic bags at 18 °C.\nNote 1: To avoid formation of Nipagen crystals on the surface of the plates due to excess dessiccation, use plates within a few days of preparation. If necessary, crystals can be re-dissolved by dropping a few microliters of 95% alcohol onto them.\nNote 2: batches of agar can have different gelling properties. The dry gel plates should be firm to the touch and sufficiently resilient that a clean, intact circle of agar can be removed when using the cork borer to create the food hole (see above).",
    "Setting up larvae in assay plates. Use mechanical pressure to curve the tip of a plastic microspatula and dip the tip in yeast paste to provide “adhesive” for picking up larvae. Pick up first instar larvae individually and place them on the agar plate close to the food mound. Prepare at least five replicate plates of 10 larvae for both experimental and control genotypes. Once completed, cap and label each plate and set the plates (lid side up) in a dark space at room temperature (in our lab this is 22 °C).\n3. Monitoring assay plates\nExamine plates daily under a dissecting microscope and record the number of larvae on top of the food or out on the agar surface. Note any visible dead or dying larvae. Note when, and if, tunneling into the agar substratum is seen as larvae move into third instar. Note dates on which pupae begin to form and note any pupal abnormalities. Continue daily observations until all larvae have died or pupated.\nRemove pupae carefully from the plate with a bent teasing needle and transfer to a grape plate. If desired, continue monitoring pupae to determine how many eclose as adults.\n4. Preparing assay plates for imaging\nCarefully remove and discard all yeast food from the central well of each plate.\nGently flood each plate with tap water and use a soft artist’s paint brush to carefully rub off debris that has been tracked onto the agar surface. Replace the water several times and continue gentle brushing until each plate is completely clean. Give plates a final rinse with deionized water, cap them and leave at room temperature overnight to dry.",
    "Note: Tunneling into the agar is most intense around the food mound (see Figure 2). As a result, the rim of the food hole is usually expanded beyond the initial 1.5 cm diameter. In addition, the fragility of the worked agar in this region may cause small pieces of tunneled agar to be lost from the circumference of the hole during cleaning. Increasing the gel agar concentration could help with these problems, but corrections are possible during the Image J quantitation steps (see below).\n5. Quantitation of tunneling\nImage the plates. Prepare an image of each plate taken against a black background so as to show the tunnels in the agar as bright white lines.\nNOTE: We use a system commonly used to image DNA gels for this step (see Table of Materials and Reagents). Alternative imaging systems capable of generating tiff files, such as digital cameras or cell phone cameras could be adjusted to produce suitable images.\nUse the public domain program NIH Image J to quantitate larval tunneling. Download the program from http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html. For more information about the program go to http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/intro.html.\n\tNOTE: Other imaging systems could be used to quantitate tunneling. The instructions below apply to NIH Image J.\nAfter opening a tiff file image of a tunneling plate, use the Oval tool to define an area for quantitation that represents the entire agar surface but crops out the plastic edge of the plate.\nApply the automatic threshold to produce a reverse image of the plate, with the tunnels showing as black lines. Use the Color picker and Paintbrush tools to white out any black areas that represent damage to the agar rather than tunnels.",
    "Under the Analyze pull-down menu, select Set scale | Click to remove scale and then on the Set measurements window (also under Analyze), check Area and Limit to threshold.\nPress Cntrl key + M key to show the black area (tunnels) in pixels.\nCopy and paste the pixel value for each plate is into a spreadsheet program (such as Excel) that will permit quantitative analysis.\nThe central hole is usually expanded due to intense tunneling in this region. To quantitate the missing tunneling, uncheck “Limit to threshold” and use the Wand tool to define the central hole. Press Cntrl key + M key to obtain the pixel value of this area. Subtract from this value the pixel value of a 1.5 cm hole and add the difference to the tunneling value obtained in step 5.6.\nFor some plates, the central hole may be missing a piece of tunneled agar that includes a region of untunneled agar adjacent to the hole. When quantitating the central hole for these plates use the Color picker and Paint brush tools to add a black bar across the missing region to define the tunneled region and exclude the non-tunneled area from quantitation. \nNote 1: If the experimental larvae perform any tunneling, this quantitation permits calculation of average tunneling values for sets of plates and statistical comparison of control and experimental values."
