This was entirely designed and 3D-printed in-house; the CAD files and full details have been made public (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nLet the animal enters the tube from the rear entrance until its head emerges from the anterior hole.\nSecure this position by lowering the neck plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3003-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. First week of MRI training: Familiarization with the body restraint\n(A–C) Frontal (A), superior (B) and lateral (C) views of the setting used for the first week of MRI training. During this week, the marmoset’s head is not fixed to the body restraint and no gradient-coil sounds are played.\nOnce the plate is closed, and the animal cannot withdraw into the tube, place a back plate of variable size in the tube, above the animal’s back, to further reduce the animal’s movements by filling the dead space.\nNote: The size of this plate depends on the size of the monkey. For this first step, the animal remains in this position without any other type of stimulus or constraint (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Methods videos S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] and S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4] depicts the steps needed to get the animal into the body restraint, close the neck and tail plates and place the back plate.",
    "During the second week, restrain the animal inside the body restraint and then insert this latter inside a mock-MRI tube (a simple plexiglass tube, with a diameter sufficient to allow the animal holder to enter, can serve this purpose: see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3003-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Second week of MRI training: Gradient-coil sounds in the mock-MRI scanner\n(A–C) Frontal (A), superior (B) and lateral (C) views of the setting used for the second week of MRI training. During this week, the marmoset’s head is not fixed, but the body restraint is positioned inside a mock-MRI scanner and gradient-coil sounds are played during the session.\nWithout fixating the head, play gradient-coil sounds, increasing their volume up to 80 dB, to simulate the noise that animals will hear during the experimental sessions.\nNote: This sound level is actually lower than the noise of our ultra-high-field MRI scanner at 9.4 T, but during the experimental sessions this noise will be muffled by silicone earplugs.\nIncrease the duration of this training gradually by 10 min, up to 60 min.\nIn the last week of training, carry out the same steps described for the first two weeks, but fixing the animal’s head post (represented in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) to the appropriate head-post clamp (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3003-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Third week of MRI training: Head fixation\n(A–C) Frontal (A), superior (B) and lateral (C) views of the setting used for the last week of MRI training. During this week, the marmoset’s head is fixed to the body restraint via the head-post clamp. The body restraint is then positioned inside the mock-MRI tube and gradient-coil sounds are played during the session.",
    "Critical: To validate each step of the training and move on to the next, the animal must exhibit relatively calm behavior. It is advisable to reward the animals during training sessions (with small portions of pudding or marshmallow fluff for example) so the animals face forward and reduce their movement. To successfully complete the training, each animal must achieve a score of 1 or 2 on the behavioral assessment scale developed by Silva and co-workers.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nMarmoset positioning before fMRI session\nTiming: 10–15 min\nThis section describes how to position the marmoset inside the body restraint before the fMRI session. All these steps are performed outside the MRI scanner room, in the adjacent preparation room. You need to prepare the room with all the necessary materials before the marmoset arrives, to avoid long times of preparation, which would result in higher stress for the animal being in an unusual room.\nPlace the respiratory pillow around the marmoset’s chest (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nWhile one experimenter holds the animal below the shoulders and at thigh level, exposing the thorax, the second experimenter wraps the respiratory pillow containing the sensor capable of measuring respiratory rate.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Procedure to correctly place the respiratory pillow around the marmoset’s chest, related to Step 4\n    \nNote: Secure the pillow with tape to stabilize the sensor, ensuring it remains in place during any subsequent manipulations. However, be careful to not impede the marmoset's breathing.\nLet the marmoset enter the body restraint.\nHolding the animal with both hands, insert the head into the rear opening of the body restraint, paying attention that the head post does not hit or get stuck in the holes dedicated to the tail plate.",
    "Note: As it is possible to observe in the Methods videos S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3], S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4], S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5], S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6], S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7], and S8[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8], our experimental setup uses a cradle to load the animal within the body restraint into the scanner during the MRI sessions. The body restraint is positioned within the crate throughout all the steps described above, to keep it stable during the positioning procedure. However, the edges of the cradle may represent an obstacle during setup. To avoid this, use a support that raises slightly the body restraint from the cradle. This step can facilitate the procedure but does not affect positioning of the animal inside the body restraint. The support we use can be seen in the Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6].\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2.

Practical implementation of the steps necessary to secure the two earphones once the head of the marmoset is fixed, related to problem 2\n    \nGently push the animal into the body restraint with one hand, using the other hand to hold the neck plate open, thus allowing the head to exit. If the marmoset tries to resist this procedure, see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nWhile still restraining the animal with one hand, close the neck plate and tighten the two side screws, thus preventing the marmoset from backing up in the body restraint (see Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nNote: Check that the closure of the neck plate is not pinching the skin of the animal's neck or shoulders.\nRemove the protective screw contained within the head post.\nInsert the head post into the appropriate cavity of the head post clamp, then use the PEEK screw to connect the head post to the clamp.\nScrew in the four screws (two front side, two rear) which allow you to finalize the fixation of the marmoset’s head.",
    "Note: The head fixation system shown in the video and described here is a modification of what is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. The previous model, with only two fixation screws, located on the rearmost part of the head post clamp, allowed animals endowed with greater strength to make small vertical movements of the head. In order to reduce this movement, the new version (represented in Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]) includes two additional fixation screws, located in front of the animal's head. This four-points fixation system eliminates any form of head movement, even by the strongest animals. The only difference in this protocol, if using the old version, pertains to this step: instead of using the 4 screws, only the two rearmost screws will be used.\nSelect the back plate that best fits the size of the marmoset.\nSecure the back plate with the two appropriate screws.\nNote: To find out which back plate is the best choice, insert your hand through the back opening, passing over the marmoset's back. Flatten the animal's back and observe the space between it and the upper surface of the body restraint. If in doubt, start with the smallest back plate and try to fit your hand. The ideal back plate prevents the animal from arching its back but at the same time does not apply pressure on the marmoset.\nClose the tail plate.\nNote: The body restraint has two openings for the tail plate. Depending on the size of the animal, the tail plate can be placed in the most posterior slot, for bigger marmosets, or in the more anterior slot. Check during the procedure which slot best fits the body length of the marmoset inside the body restraint.",
    "Optional: In the Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4] it is possible to observe the presence of a folding tail cover, which can be closed after the positioning of the tail plate. This element is not essential for the good fixation of the animal, but it is effective in limiting the movements of the tail. Continuing in the video, it is indeed possible to observe that the cables of the 8 channels of our coil pass a few centimeters above the tail, and the movements of the tail can therefore hit the cables or the connectors. Also, a long tail may become entangled with the cables, causing signal interference. To avoid all this, it is possible to provide a tail cover which can be closed at the end of the procedure, to limit the movements of the tail. In the case of animals particularly inclined to wag their tails, it is advisable to add a piece of adhesive tape to this cover, to prevent accidental reopening.\nEncase the ends of the two insert earphones with silicone earplugs, creating a protective layer that will shield the ear from the scanner’s noise.\nNote: These earphones are small enough to fit the marmoset’s ears, and they are connected with a transformer and an audio amplifier. The latter receives the auditory signal directly from a computer, though a common jack connector.\nPlace the first earphone in one ear, keeping it in place by shaping the silicone inside the ear of the marmoset. Once the first is secured, move on to the second earphone (see Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nNote: If the experiment does not include auditory stimuli, the earphones are not necessary. Thus, skip step j and position the silicone earplugs in the ears of the marmoset, modelling them to the shape of the auricle.",
    "Critical: Do not put pressure directly on the earphone to try to hold it in place, but rather press on the surrounding silicone. Excessive pressure on the earphone could push it too far into the animal's ear, damaging the eardrum. If the silicone is not sufficient to hold the earphone in place, proceed to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nPlace the two removable coil housing parts, securing them with the two suitable screws. Check that the frontal border of the two parts is at the same level and not shifted posteriorly/anteriorly (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), as this shift may influence the quality of the signal.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3003-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Detailed view of the removable coil housing positioning\n(A and B) Representation of an erroneous (A) and a correct (B) position of the two removable coil housing parts. The frontal-posterior shifting of the two parts may negatively affect the quality of the signal during the MR scan.\nRemove the support below the body restraint, then slide the latter until the mark indicated on the coil housing parts matches the isocenter position marked on the cradle (see Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]).\nNote: This step depends on the experimental setup present in the laboratory. In our case, the cradle is inserted inside the scanner up to a predetermined position, and it is therefore possible to mark the position of the isocenter on the cradle. Matching the body restraint with the isocenter is therefore relatively straightforward. Different experimental setups may include different methodologies, different cradles or even the absence of a cradle (especially in the case of larger diameter scanner bores, as in the case of a 7T or 3T scanner).\nPosition the pre-amplifiers behind the body restraint.\nConnect the eight channels of the coil to their respective connectors (see Methods video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7]).",
    "Note: All the steps described here, except for step 4 (respiratory pillow), can be performed by a single experimenter. We suggest, however, that two people take care of positioning the animal inside the body restraint, to speed up the procedure and reduce the animal's stress period. In the case of two people, we suggest that the division of tasks is done on a spatial basis: one experimenter can take care of the tasks related to the \"posterior\" part of the body restraint (insert the animal, apply the back plate, close the tail plate, position the pre-amplifiers and connect the cables related to the eight channels). The second experimenter can take care of the \"frontal\" part of the body restraint (close the neck plate, remove the protective screw from the head post, fixate the marmoset head, position the earphones/silicone earplugs and screw the two parts of the coil into the appropriate slots). However, this distribution of tasks can be modified as needed.\nPush the cradle and the body restraint slowly into the magnet bore until the predetermined position is reached and the marmoset’s head is at the isocenter.\nConnect the cables of the MRI-compatible camera and the respiration pillow to the correspondent devices.\nMonitor the state of the animal, both visually through the images provided by the MRI-compatible camera, and by checking the physiological signal transmitted by the respiratory pillow.\nfMRI acquisition\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the steps to record BOLD signal changes in awake marmosets using a 9.4 T Bruker scanner (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nLocalize the marmoset’s head and brain through a standard localizer, checking they match the position of the isocenter.\nCalibrate the power of the transmit RF coils.\nOptimize the homogeneity of the magnetic field using a MAPSHIM shimming protocol.",
    "Note: Positioning the head of the marmosets in the isocenter should improve the efficacy of B0 shimming and reduce inter-animal variations in spatial distortion. However, in some sessions it is possible to observe highly distorted images or low signal after B0 shimming. If this is the case, see Troubleshooting 3."
