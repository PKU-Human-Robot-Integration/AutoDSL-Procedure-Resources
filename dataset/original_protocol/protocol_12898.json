    "1. Inducing Hypoxia\nOne day or more before the hypoxia time course: Prepare the incubator, cell filtering system, vacuum, gas tank, flasks, stoppers, glass tubing, and tubing, as in the Materials Table.\nPlace the N2 tank, incubator, vacuum and filtering system in close proximity, to enable quick processing of cells.\nPrepare sterile liquid YPD media (1% Yeast Extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) by mixing the components in a glass bottle and autoclaving.\nPlan layout of flasks in the incubator.\n\tNOTE: From the N2 tank, the first flask will be a water trap, the second flask will be the last time point, the third flask will be the second-to-last time point and so on until the last flask which is a final water trap. Figure 1 shows the order and connections between the flasks.\nThe day before the time course, inoculate a yeast colony into a culture of 5 mL liquid YPD within a sterile test tube. Specifically, pick up a full colony from a plate using a sterile applicator stick. Place the stick into the liquid YPD and shake the stick until most of the cells are in suspension.\nRotate the tubes at 30 °C overnight (~16 h).\n\tNOTE: After 16 h, wildtype cells will achieve saturation (~2 x 108 cells/mL), indicated by a very cloudy culture. Other strains may take longer to reach saturation and should be tested by measuring cell concentration with a spectrophotometer, as indicated in Step 1.9.4.\nOn the day of the time course, after 16 h of incubation, dilute the saturated culture 1:50 by using a 5 mL pipet to place 4 mL of overnight culture into 196 mL of liquid YPD within a sterile 500 mL flask. Grow with shaking at ~200 rpm for 4 h at 30 °C.",
    "NOTE: After 4 h, a wildtype culture will reach a mid-log concentration of ~1-2 x 107 cells/mL.\nDuring the 4 h incubation, label the flasks (for hypoxia and water traps) and the 50 mL collection tubes. If the incubator in step 1.7 above is not used for the hypoxia time course, turn on the other incubator and set to 30 °C.\nJust before subjecting cells to hypoxia:\nAdd ~50 mL water to two of the sterile 250 mL flasks which will serve as the water traps.\nFill 1/3 of an ice bucket with liquid nitrogen and submerge a polystyrene foam rack to hold 50 mL centrifuge tubes.\nSet up the filter system for collecting cells. Add a sterile filter disc onto the bottom unit of the filtration system using sterile tweezers, being careful to only touch the edges of the filter disc. Place the filter top unit onto the filter bottom unit and secure with the clamps provided with the system. Ensure that the bottom and top units are aligned so that there is a tight seal and no leakage.\nMeasure the cell concentration with a spectrophotometer. Dilute cells so that they can be measured in the linear range of the spectrophotometer – OD600 between ~0.2 - 0.6, depending on the spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: One OD600 unit is ~3 x 107 cells/mL, depending on cell morphology and spectrophotometer. A concentration of ~1-2 x 107 cells/mL is expected, corresponding to OD600 of ~0.33 - 0.66.\nQuickly obtain the time 0 sample.",
    "Connect the filter system to a strong (~10 mbar) vacuum via vacuum tubing and a 1,000 mL flask trap. Turn on the vacuum. Pour the culture (usually ~20 mL) into the top unit and wait for liquid to be pulled through the filter (~10 s, depending on the strength of the vacuum).\nCarefully remove the filter disc with clean tweezers and place into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Immediately place the centrifuge tube into the rack submerged in liquid nitrogen. Importantly, do not pre-chill the tubes before inserting the filter as the tubes will explode.\nAfter >30 s, place the tube into a -80 °C freezer for later RNA extraction. After each filtration, clean and reassemble the filter system. Rinse the system by pulling water through for 10 s without a filter disc. Finally, wipe dry the system with a paper towel.\nDilute the 4 h culture into different flasks for the various time points, so that each flask reaches mid-log concentration (~1-2 x 107 cells/mL) at the indicated time point of hypoxia.\n\t\tNOTE: Table 1 shows dilutions that were used for the wild-type S288C HAP1+ haploid strain. It is recommended to test each strain in these hypoxic culture conditions and adjust the dilutions accordingly.\nOnce cells and media are added to flasks, replace the aluminum foil covering the flask opening with a stopper containing two glass tubes inserted.\nPlace the flasks in the incubator in the layout determined earlier.\nSecurely connect the tubing as shown in Figure 1.\nCheck that all the stoppers are tightly pushed into the flask openings.\nAt time 0, open the regulator valve. Then set the flow meter to 3 L/min.",
    "NOTE: Bubbling will be observed in both water flasks, indicating proper gas flow. If this is not the case, check that all stoppers are tight and tubing is properly attached.\nClose the incubator and set the shaking speed to ~200 rpm. Start a timer.\nBefore each time point, set up the filter system as describe above in step 1.9.3.\nAt each time point (e.g., 5 min, 10 min, etc.), have two people quickly process the cells as follows:\nFirst person: remove the appropriate flask from the holder and take out the stopper (with glass tubing attached).\n\t\tNOTE: This will not break the flow of N2 to any of the remaining culture flasks but will temporarily break the flow to the last water trap.\nSecond person: Pipet 1 mL of culture and dispense into a cuvette. Reconnect the tubing from the culture flask that is now at the end of the line to the last water trap (One tube and one stopper will be removed in the process.). Then, measure cell concentration in the cuvette, as described above in step 1.9.4.\nFirst person: Pour the remainder of the culture into the vacuum filtration system, and then perform filtering and freezing as described above in step 1.9.5.\nWhen finished with all the time points, turn off the N2 gas. First close the regulator and wait for the pressure to release, and then turn off the flow meter. Finally, disassemble the system and clean all materials with water and then 70% ethanol.\n2. RNA Extraction\nPrepare RLT buffer for RNA column purification, as described in the Materials Table.\nPrepare a working solution of DNase by adding 10 µL of the DNase stock solution to 70 µL of buffer RDD per sample (see Materials Table).",
    "Remove the 50 mL tubes containing filters and cells from the -80 °C freezer and place on ice to thaw (~15 min). Perform the following steps with tubes on ice.\nLabel 2 mL screw-cap tubes and place them on ice, one tube for each sample. Add ~0.6 mL of acid-washed beads to each tube, using a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to scoop and measure the beads.\nAdd 0.6 mL of cold RLT buffer to the 50 mL tubes.\nPipet up and down to remove cells from filter and suspend into solution. Avoid letting the filter remain in the solution as the filter will soak up the solution. Remove all solution absorbed into the filter by using the pipet tip to squeeze the filter against the wall of the tube.\nTransfer all of the liquid from the 50 mL tube to the screw-cap tubes containing beads.\nPlace the screw-cap tubes into a bead mill homogenizer and run for one min.\n\tImmediately place the tubes on ice for three min. Again, place the tubes into the homogenizer and run for one min.\nRemove the tubes from the homogenizer and place on ice for 5 min. The beads will settle to the bottom of the tubes.\nPerform the remainder of the steps at room temperature.\nWith a pipet, transfer only the lysate (~350 µL), avoiding the beads, to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nMicrocentrifuge for 2 min at max speed and then transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 volume of 70% ethanol (made from 200 proof molecular biology-grade ethanol). Mix well by pipetting.\nTransfer the solution and any precipitate to an RNA column that has been placed inside a 2 mL collection tube.",
    "Centrifuge for 15 s at ≥12,000 x g and discard the flow-through (the liquid in the tube).\nAdd 350 µL of buffer RW1 to the column. Centrifuge for 15 s at ≥12,000 x g and discard the flow-through.\nAdd 80 µL DNase I incubation mix to the column membrane (do not get on sides of tube) and allow to sit for 15 min.\nAdd 350 µL of buffer RW1 to column. Microcentrifuge for 15 s at ≥12,000 x g and discard the flow-through.\nAdd 500 µL of buffer RPE to the column. Microcentrifuge for 15 s at ≥12,000 x g and discard flow-through.\nAdd 500 µL of buffer RPE to the column. Microcentrifuge for 2 min at ≥12,000 x g.\nCarefully remove the column and place into a new 2 mL collection tube. Microcentrifuge at full speed for 1 min (to completely dry the membrane).\nDiscard the collection tube and place the column into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 30 µL of RNase-free water to the column membrane.\nElute the RNA from the column by microcentrifuging for 1 min at ≥12,000 x g. When loading the columns into the microcentrifuge, make sure the lids of the collection tube are facing in the direction the centrifuge spins, to prevent the lids breaking off.\nAdd another 30 µL of RNase-free water to the column membrane, while keeping the column in the same microcentrifuge tube.\nMicrocentrifuge for 1 min at ≥12,000 x g, so that the final eluate volume is 60 µL.\nStore each 1.5 mL tube containing 60 µL of RNA in the -80 °C freezer.\n3. Determining RNA Concentration and Quality",
    "Measure the concentration of RNA and DNA in each RNA sample, using (a) a fluorometer, (b) DNA- and RNA-specific fluorescent dyes and (c) assay tubes, as listed in the Materials Table. Follow the instructions of the fluorometer and the dyes.\nAlternatively, measure the nucleic acid concentration with a UV spectrophotometer set at 260 nm.\n\tNOTE: An A260 reading of 1.0 is equivalent to ~40 µg/mL single-stranded RNA.\nTest RNA quality by running the RNA on a commercial nucleic acid analyzer (see Materials Table) or on a standard formaldehyde/agarose gel 26.\n4. RNA-seq Analysis\nFrom the total RNA stock, make up 21 µL of 100 ng/µL RNA in RNase-free water. Use 1 µL of this 21 µL to test the RNA concentration as above. Submit the remaining 20 µL (2 µg) total RNA to an external sequencing center for mRNA enrichment, strand-specific library preparation (with eight or more barcodes for multiplexing) and sequencing (see Materials Table). Alternatively, locally perform mRNA enrichment and library preparation, and then submit the library for sequencing.\nPool eight or more multiplexed samples and sequence in one lane of a next-generation sequencer.\nDownload the FASTQ file containing all of the sequence reads and the corresponding index reads. Also, download the text file containing the multiplex barcodes.\n\tNOTE: The index reads may be present in a separate FASTQ file. Place all of these files into one directory.\nPlace the shell script provided here, \"fastq_pipeline.sh\", in the same directory. Edit this script as appropriate for the experiment and the computer directories.\n\tNOTE: this script contains extensive annotations explaining the steps. In brief, the script quality trims the reads, maps the reads to the genome, and generates a tab-delimited file containing the number of reads per gene for each sample.",
    "Deposit the FASTQ files and raw read count data into NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus before publication 27. Follow the instructions for \"Submitting high-throughput sequence data to GEO\": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html.\nImport the read count data into the R statistical environment and perform statistical analysis, using the R script provided here, \"time_course_script.R\". Edit this script as appropriate for the experiment and the computer directories.\n\tNOTE: This script contains extensive annotations explaining the steps. In brief, this script imports the read data, normalizes the reads, identifies genes that change significantly during the time course, performs PCA analysis, and graphs the expression of selected genes.\nSubscription Required.
