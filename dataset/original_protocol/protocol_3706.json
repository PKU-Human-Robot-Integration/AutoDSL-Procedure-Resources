    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSection 1: library preparation\nTiming: 8 days\nDay 0: Preparation of RH-Cas9 T. gondii parasites (from two 150-mm dishes of HFFs, infected two days before)\nUse a cell scraper to remove the parasite-infected cells from the surface of the 150-mm dishes.\nPool the parasite-infected cells from the two 150-mm dishes in one 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 570 × g for 7 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the medium and resuspend the parasite-infected cells in 5 mL CytoMix.\nPass the parasite-infected cells through two successive syringes (5 mL volume) with 27 G needles to mechanically break the cells and release the parasites. Collect in a 15 mL conical tube.\nDetermine the number of parasites using a hemocytometer (Neubauer Chamber).\nTransfer the volume of parasites necessary to obtain 5 × 107 parasites total to a new tube and centrifuge at 570 × g for 7 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the parasite pellet in 800 μL of Complete Cytomix + digested sgRNA-containing plasmid library.\nCollect 10 μL in a 15 mL conical tube containing 1 mL of M1 medium. Those parasites will be used for plaque assay to determine parasite viability before transfection.\nSplit remaining parasites evenly between two electroporation cuvettes (400 μL each).\nPlace the cuvettes in the electroporator and electroporate each following this setup:\nVoltage (V): 1250\nCapacitance (μF): 25\nResistance (Ω): ∞\nLet the transfected parasites recover in the cuvettes for 15 min at room temperature. During this time, remove four 150-mm dishes of HFFs from the incubator and change the medium to M1 medium (25 mL per dish).\nPool parasites from both cuvettes in a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Collect 10 μL in a 15 mL conical tube containing 1 mL of M1 medium. Those parasites will be used for plaque assay to determine parasite viability after transfection.\nUse the transfected parasites (∼800 μL) to infect four 150-mm dishes of HFFs, each with ∼200 μL.\nNote: For the viability before transfection (in step 8), dilute the parasites from 10 μL (6 × 105 parasites) in M1 medium until a concentration of 100 parasites/mL (in a total volume of 10 mL). Then, add 1 mL of this dilution into four individual wells of a 24-well plate of HFFs. For the viability after transfection (in step 13), dilute the parasites from 10 μL (6 × 105 parasites) in M1 medium until a concentration of 5,000 and 1,000 parasites/mL (in a total volume of 10 mL). Then, add 1 mL of each dilution into four individual wells of a 24-well plate of HFFs. Incubate both plates at 37°C.\nDay 1: Selection\nRemove the M1 medium from the 24-well plate at step 8, add 1 mL of M3 medium into each well, and incubate the plate at 37°C undisturbed for five days. Remove the M1 medium from the 24-well plate at step 13, add 1 mL of M2 medium into each well, and incubate the plate at 37°C undisturbed for five days.",
    "Critical: Do not move the infected 24-well plates during the incubation time. Otherwise, parasites from a formed plaque could generate new plaques and skew parasite viability. For example, 3% out of 1 × 107 parasites means that 2.1 × 105 parasites incorporated the sgRNA-containing plasmid into the genome and acquired resistance to pyrimethamine. Because the library contains ∼2,000 sgRNAs, the parasite mutant coverage will be (2.1 × 105)/2,000 sgRNAs = 105 × coverage. In vitro, a minimum of 50 × coverage is required to maintain library diversity (Sidik et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nStart the pyrimethamine selection the following day after electroporation.\nAspirate the M1 medium from each 150-mm dish of infected HFFs.\nAdd 25 mL of M2 medium (+ 10 μg/mL of DNaseI) in each 150-mm dish of infected HFFs.\nCritical: For the first passage of the parasites after electroporation, add 10 μg/mL of DNaseI (10 mg/mL stock) to the M2 medium. The enzyme will digest any remaining extracellular sgRNA-containing plasmid, thereby preventing its amplification during the PCR steps of section 4.\nDay 3: (Passage of parasites to new 150-mm dishes of HFFs. Parasites are mostly in big vacuoles or starting to lyse out):\nScrape the 150-mm dishes and combine two 150-mm dishes into one 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 570 × g for 7 min at 4°C and resuspend in 10 mL of M2 medium.\nOptional: There is no need to add DNaseI to the M2 medium at this point.\nPass the parasites through two syringes (10 mL) with 27 G needles and collect them in a new 50 mL conical tube.\nCount parasites as indicated in step 5.\nCollect 1 × 107 parasites as the first lysis sample.\nPellet down the parasites in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube at 15,000 × g for 1 min.",
    "Aspirate supernatant and freeze the tube at −80°C.\nWith the rest of the parasites, infect two to four 150-mm dishes of HFFs (containing 25 mL of M2 medium), each with 1 × 107 parasites.\nNote: Always use 1 ×107 parasites to infect 150-mm dishes of HFFs. 1 × 107 theoretically represent 5,000 × coverage of a 2,000-sgRNA library. This number will be used for the inoculum because a high coverage is necessary to prevent random drop-out of mutants due to the strong bottleneck during the in vivo infection.\nDay 5: Parasites viability before and after electroporation\nTo determine the viability, take out the plates, and use a microscope to count the number of lysis plaques formed on the HFF monolayer.\nFor the viability before transfection: for 100 parasites/well, if all of them were alive (100% viability), 100 plaques would be observed. Therefore, if the four wells have an average of 70 plaques, the viability would be 70%.\nFor the viability after transfection: for 1,000 parasites/well, if all of them were alive (100% viability), 1,000 plaques would be observed (technically, it is impossible to count 1,000 plaques in a 24-well). Therefore, if the four wells have an average of 30 plaques, the viability would be 3%.\nNote: There is no need to fix or stain the 24-well plate with a crystal violet solution to count the plaques. The plaques are well visible by direct observation of live cells on the bright field of the microscope.\nDay 6: (Passage of parasites to new 150-mm dishes of HFFs)\nRepeat steps 17 to 23 and collect 1 ×107 parasites as the second lysis sample.\nWith the rest of the parasites, infect four to eight 150-mm dishes of HFFs (containing 25 mL of M2 medium), each with 1 × 107 parasites.\nSection 2: Mouse infection",
    "Timing: 4 days\nDay 8: The parasites from Day 6 are mostly in big vacuoles or starting to lyse out.\nPrepare the parasites for peritoneal injection of mice by repeating steps 17 to 20 in section 1.\nNote: Perform an additional centrifugation step to have all the parasites in the same 50 mL conical tube, and resuspend them with 10 mL of M1 medium.\nAfter counting, dilute the parasites to 5 × 107 parasites/mL.\nCollect 1 × 107 parasites (200 μL) as the Inoculum sample and follow steps 22 to 23 in section 1.\nPour the parasites into a reagent reservoir and load fifteen Insulin syringes, each with 200 μL of M1 medium containing 1 × 107 parasites.\nInject fifteen mice intraperitoneally, each with 1 × 107 parasites (200 μL).\nCritical: Be careful when loading the syringes and during the intraperitoneal injection. Follow safety measures to avoid any direct exposure to infected needles. Prepare extra syringes in case injection needs to be repeated or needles are defective. Ten mice will be used in section 3; however, infect fifteen mice to anticipate unexpected deaths before the final time point or mistakes during the mice injection.\nNote: To determine the inoculum’s viability, bring an extra 1 × 107 parasites (200 μL) aliquot in a 15 mL conical tube to the mouse facility, and then back to the lab, add 9,800 μL of M1 medium to have 1 × 106 parasites/mL. Then perform serial 10-fold dilutions until reaching a concentration of 100 parasites/mL. Infect four wells of a 24-well plate, each with 1 mL (100 parasites).\nEvery day, two times a day, monitor the condition of the mice. Mice usually present the first signs of infection (rough hair coat, inappetence, lethargy) around day two post-infection.",
    "Note: The goal is to maximize the parasite's dissemination throughout the mice before euthanasia. However, with the inoculum of 1 × 107 parasites, the mice will likely need to be euthanized around four days (96 h) post-infection. It is essential to avoid using death as an endpoint by ensuring that mice are euthanized as soon as their condition significantly deteriorates (unable to reach food/water, inability to move, patent distress, etc.).\nDay 12: Euthanize the infected mice.\nStop the infection when the condition of the mice requires it.\nCritical: Between three- and four-days post-infection. 1) The coat of the mice is rough. 2) Mice show reduced activity and cuddle together. 3) Mice stop eating and drinking (less food and water consumption are indirect effects of the previous condition cited). 4) The abdomen of the mice is swollen. Make sure not to reach the final stage before death, which is complete body lethargy with slow breathing. For more information about euthanasia, see (Avma, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nPlace the ten mice into a CO2 chamber and monitor until no movement is detected. Maintain the CO2 for one more minute before removing them from the chamber. The death should be confirmed by a total absence of breathing, then direct palpation of either the pulse in the carotid or femoral artery or direct cardiac palpation to assess the heartbeat.\nNote: Apply the following steps on each of the ten mice.\nSoak the dead mouse entirely into 70% ethanol for about 30 sec.\nWith scissors, make a small midline incision in the abdomen, and enlarge the incision with your fingers to remove the skin from the peritoneal membrane.\nInject 5 mL of PBS into the peritoneal cavity (5 mL syringe + 30 G needle). Vigorously shake the mouse to homogenize the peritoneal lavage.",
    "Use a new 5 mL syringe + 27 G needle to retrieve the peritoneal lavage and transfer it to a 15 mL conical tube.\nOpen the peritoneal cavity and collect any organ of interest.\nWith scissors, open the thoracic cavity, collect the heart and lungs, and transfer them to different 50 mL conical tubes containing 10 mL of PBS.\nUsing forceps, collect the eyes and open the skull with scissors to collect the brain. Transfer both eyes to the same 50 mL conical tube and the brain to a separate 50 mL conical tube containing 10 mL of PBS.\nCritical: Soaking each mouse into 70% ethanol reduces the chance of contamination with bacteria, fungi, or yeasts. Be careful when taking peritoneal lavage as it contains a high number of parasites. Follow safety measures to avoid any direct exposure to infected needles. It is crucial to prevent the transfer of the peritoneal parasites to the thorax or skull. Use different sets of tools to collect each organ or wash the tools with 70% ethanol in between. Discard the carcass in an adequate biohazard container.\nOptional: Our initial experiments showed that liver and spleen sgRNA profiles were almost identical to the peritoneal lavage profile.\nCritical: Section 3 starts as soon as all the organs and peritoneal lavages are collected on Day 12.\nSection 3: Genomic DNA extraction\nTiming: 3 weeks",
    "Note: Section 3 contains only two steps with subheadings. Step 45 will detail how to amplify the sgRNAs by PCR (direct PCR method) using the genomic DNA extracted from the organs and peritoneal lavages from five mice. This method is limited by the amount of parasite genomic DNA available in the total amount of DNA. Step 46 will explain how to culture the organ suspensions and peritoneal lavage from five mice, allowing parasite replication, genomic DNA extraction, and PCR amplification of the sgRNAs (HFF culture method). This method introduces an extra in vitro step in the screen. We found that for organs with higher parasite loads (e.g., peritoneal lavage, lung), the sgRNA profiles were similar for both methods, indicating that both methods are reliable. However, for organs with low parasite loads, the best method to obtain the largest sgRNA diversity was previously described in (Sangaré et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nGenomic DNA extraction from organs and peritoneal lavages of five mice (Direct PCR method). A summary of the digestion process and expected DNA yields for each organ is shown in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_632_6.csv\nCentrifuge the peritoneal lavages from step 41 in section 2 (peritoneal lavages for only five mice) at 570 × g for 7 min at 4°C. Use the pellets for DNA extraction.\nNext, aspirate the PBS from the 50 mL conical tubes containing the organ suspension from step 44 in section 2 (organs for only five mice) and place each of them in a 100-mm dish.\nCut the organs into small pieces using razor blades. Use a separate blade for each organ.\nUse the blade to scoop up the organ pieces and transfer them to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nUse a scale to weigh each organ.",
    "Pause Point: All the organs and peritoneal lavages for the direct PCR method can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nNote: The genomic DNA extraction will follow QIAGEN’s protocol (DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, Cat#69506). If an organ's weight exceeds the maximum amount of tissue per digestion with Proteinase K, split it into different reactions to digest the whole organ.\nCritical: Before starting step 46, remove the medium from all the 150-mm and 100-mm dishes of HFFs and add fresh M3 medium (20 mL and 10 mL, respectively). This is very important because HFF cells need a rich medium when organ suspensions or peritoneal lavage are added on top of them.\nGenomic DNA extraction from parasites after HFF culture of the organs and peritoneal lavages of five mice (HFF culture method). A summary of the organ suspension culture procedure is shown in Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_632_7.csv\nCentrifuge the peritoneal lavage from step 41 in section 2 (for the five other mice) at 570 × g for 7 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellets with 1 mL of M3 medium.\nInoculate 150-mm dishes of HFFs (one peritoneal lavage for one 150-mm dish) with 1 mL of the resuspended peritoneal lavage.\nNext, aspirate the PBS from the 50 mL conical tubes containing the organ suspension from step 44 in section 2 (for the five other mice) and place each organ on top of a cell strainer (70 μm).\nPlace the cell strainer + organ on top of a new 50 mL conical tube.\nTake a 5 mL syringe, remove the plunger.\nUse the hard edge of the plunger to crunch the organ inside the cell strainer.",
    "When the organ is completely crunched, rinse (with up to 10 mL of M3 medium) the plunger and cell strainer to collect the organ suspension into the 50 mL conical tube.\nUse the organ suspension to inoculate 150-mm or 100-mm dishes of HFFs as follows:\nOptional: It is possible to increase the number of 150-mm dishes per organ; however, the expected lysis time will be longer.\nRegularly (at least once daily) check the dishes and gently stir them to resuspend the organ debris.\nCritical: Regularly move the dishes to avoid too much organ debris clamping on top of HFFs and to spread the newly lysed parasites all over the dish (see Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nWhen the parasites are mostly in big vacuoles or starting to lyse the cells, follow steps 17 to 23 in section 1, collect 1 × 107 parasites from each organ and peritoneal lavage cultures.\nPause Point: Here, all the parasite pellets can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nNote: Prepare several parasite pellets from each culture and store them at −80°C. The genomic DNA extraction will follow the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Cat#69506). For 1 × 107 parasites, the genomic DNA yield can vary between 50 to 200 ng/μL in 100 μL.\nSection 4: Amplification of sgRNAs\nTiming: 1 to 2 weeks\nDay 33: Start the PCR steps\nNote: The sgRNAs amplification was adapted from steps 57 to 59 from the published protocol (Sidik et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The minimal amount of genomic DNA recommended (from 1 ×107 parasites) is 1 μg in a total reaction volume of 100 μL. The primers listed for each sample is shown in Table S5 (Sangaré et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
    "Critical: Be aware of cross-contamination between samples. To avoid that: make small aliquots of UltraPure water in Eppendorf tubes used for the PCR reactions. Do PCR reaction in groups according to each type of organ (for example, only brain samples at the same time). Start with organs expected to have less diversity (e.g., eyes first, then brain, heart, lung, and peritoneum). The library plasmid should be the last reaction. Do not set PCR reactions on a bench where the sgRNA-containing plasmid was purified, digested, dialysis, etc. If possible, use a specific PCR station with a hood. Clean with a DNAse solution (e.g., diluted bleach), and perform ultraviolet treatment for a set of pipettes between each group of PCR reactions. Gloves are an important source of cross-contamination; change them between each group of PCR reactions. Always include a negative PCR control, which adds UltraPure (DNase-free) water instead of template DNA to know if the primers or other reagents are contaminated.\nTable 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8] details the number of PCR reactions necessary according to the origin of the genomic DNA.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_632_8.csv\nPrepare the PCR reaction mix according to Table 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl9].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_632_9.csv\naEach sample has a specific P2.\nNote: Primer 1 (P1) contains the P5 Illumina adaptor, and it is the common primer for all the samples. Primer 2 (P2) contains the P7 Illumina adaptor and a specific barcode. Each sample should have a specific P2 primer for sgRNA amplification. See Table S5 (Sangaré et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) for P1, P2, and barcode sequences.\nPerform PCR following the cycling conditions detailed in Table 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl10].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_632_10.csv\nPool together PCR reactions from the same sample and analyze 10 μL of the pool using standard gel electrophoresis. The expected band size is between 368 to 369 bp (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/632-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. sgRNA amplification",
    "Left, genomic DNA was extracted from mice's lungs and used as a template to amplify sgRNAs (Samples 1 to 5). Right, lungs were put in HFF cell culture to allow the parasites to replicate. Subsequently, parasites were isolated, genomic DNA extracted, and used as a template to amplify sgRNAs (samples A to E). The red arrow indicates sgRNA bands 368–369 bp, and the black arrow indicates remaining primers from the PCR reaction. neg= negative control for PCR reactions.\nCritical: If there is no band for direct PCR organ and peritoneal lavage samples, see Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nThen for each sample, run 100 to 200 μL of the pool using standard gel electrophoresis.\nPlace the gel on a glass cutting board with blue light (do not use UV light).\nUse a clean blade to cut out the band corresponding to the amplified sgRNA fragments (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPurify the PCR product using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Cat#28704), following the manufacturer's instructions.\nCritical: The manufacturer's protocol indicates melting the gel at 50°C for about 10 min. We recommend melting the gel at room temperature. The process will take more time but will avoid amplicon denaturation and PCR bubble formation (PCR bubbles contain considerable amounts of single-stranded DNA that will not be quantified). Here, it is not recommended to keep the PCR products for a long time before sequencing. The products can be kept at 4°C for a maximum of one week but do not freeze/thaw them.\nSection 5: Illumina sequencing and analysis\nTiming: 2 weeks (Time for the Illumina sequencing is not included)\nUse the samples from step 52 in section 4 for next-generation sequencing.",
    "Note: The samples for next-generation sequencing should be prepared following the corresponding sequencing facility’s protocol. We used a NextSeq (Illumina 2500) with single-end reads using primers P150 and P151 to sequence the sgRNAs and barcodes, respectively (See Table S5 (Sangaré et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])). From here, the peritoneal lavage will be mentioned as peritoneum and the sgRNA-containing plasmid as the library.\nDay 48: Start of the Analysis\nAnalysis of sgRNA sequencing reads and calculation of fitness scores for each gene.\nExtract the Illumina sequencing reads and match them against the sequences of the sgRNA library. Follow Steps 61 to 66 from the published protocol by Sidik et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nCount the number of exact matches and consider these as raw read numbers.\nNote: Due to reduced sgRNA coverage (Sangaré et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), we decided to pool the reads of the five individual mice for the heart, brain, and eye to have three different samples. We kept ten separate samples for lung and peritoneum.\nNote: We followed steps 61 to 66 of the published protocol (Sidik et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) to get each gene’s fitness score from each sample. Here the fitness score corresponded to the average log2 fold-change in sgRNAs abundance between organ/peritoneum vs. inoculum.\nFitness scores calculation.\nHFF fitness score = Inoculum vs. Library\nPeritoneum fitness score = Peritoneum (for each peritoneum) vs. Inoculum\nLung fitness score = Lung (for each lung) vs. Inoculum\nHeart fitness score = Heart (pooled hearts) vs. Inoculum\nBrain fitness score = Brain (pooled brains) vs. Inoculum\nEyes fitness score = Eye (pooled eyes) vs. Inoculum\nRank the genes from the lowest to the highest fitness score.\nRank the genes in each of the ten peritoneum samples.\nRank the genes in each of the ten lung samples.",
    "Calculate the Z-score for the gene ranks in peritoneum and lung. Gene Z-score = (100.5 - gene average rank)/ gene average rank standard deviation. 100.5 represents the population ranking mean = (R1 + R2 + .... + R200)/200. Where 200 is the number of genes in the population.\nNote: The Z-score will identify genes with a consistent top ranking in the peritoneum and lung, which means those genes have the lowest fitness scores in each organ.\nCriteria to identify genes that confer fitness in the peritoneum and/or organs.\nGenes with a Z-score ≥ 2 in the peritoneum were considered as peritoneum fitness-conferring genes. Those genes will also have a high Z-score in the lung and a low fitness score in the heart, brain, and eye.\nGenes (excluding peritoneum fitness conferring genes) with a Z-score ≥ 2 in the lung and/or with a fitness score of ≤ −1 (2-fold decrease in abundance of sgRNAs) in at least three other organs (heart, brain, and eye) were considered as organ fitness conferring genes."
