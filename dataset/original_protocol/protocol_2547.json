    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nReprogramming of human hepatocytes\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nHuman hepatocytes are reprogrammed into iPS/iTS-L cells using Sendai virus (SeV) vectors expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC from a vender; see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] in this protocol.\nOn Day -1, wash human hepatocytes twice with 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nThe cells are then dissociated with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA for 5 min.\nAdd 5 mL of hepatocyte basal medium and break up cell aggregates by pipetting up and down with a 5 mL pipette.\nThe samples are then centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nRemove the supernatant.\nCount cells and dilute to 1.0 × 105 cells/mL in hepatocyte basal medium.\nPlate cells (1.0 × 105 cells/well) in 6-well plates.\nHuman hepatocytes are placed in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, and 85% humidity for 24 h.\nOn Day 0, prepare a 15 mL tube containing 2 mL of hepatocyte basal medium with 10 μL of SeV KOS (5.0 × 105 CIU), 10 μL of SeV Klf4 (5.0 × 105 CIU), and 10 μL of SeV Myc (5.0 × 105 CIU) ((5.0 × 105 CIU)/(1.0 × 105 cells)=5 multiplicity of infection (MOI)) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2182-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic Representation of Sendai Virus (SeV) vectors\n(A) SeV vector that allows the expression of human KLF4, OCT3/4, and SOX2 proteins.\n(B) SeV vector that allows the expression of human KLF4 protein.\n(C) SeV vector that allows expression of human c-MYC protein. NP; Nucleocapsid Protein. P; Phosphoprotein. M; Matrix protein. HN; Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase. L; Large protein.\nAspirate the culture medium.\nAdd 2 mL hepatocyte basal medium with SeV.\nPlace the 6-well plate in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, and 85% humidity for 24 h.",
    "On Day 1, aspirate the culture medium and renew with fresh hepatocyte basal medium.\nRenew with fresh hepatocyte basal medium daily for 3 days.\nOn Day 4, dissociate the hepatocytes and plate the hepatocytes in 60 mm dish containing MEFs using human ES/iPS/iTS-L cell culture medium.\nThe 60 mm dish is then placed in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, and 85% humidity.\nChange human ES/iPS/iTS-L cell culture medium daily.\nOn Days 14–21, the reprogrammed cells should now transform to a round morphology. Every single clone should be independently expanded for characterization and freezing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2182-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Time schedules for the induction of iPS/iTS-L cells transfected with SeV vectors\nOpen arrowheads indicate the times of cell seeding, passaging, and colony selection. Solid arrowheads indicate the times of transfection.\nTeratoma formation assay\nTiming: 10–15 weeks\nThe colonies similar to human ES cells or gut tube endodermal (GTE) cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) are selected for further cultivation and evaluation. Colonies similar to human ES cells should be iPS cells and generate teratomas. The colonies similar to GTE cells should be iTS-L cells and generate no teratomas.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2182-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The morphologies of iPS and iTS-L cells\n(A) The morphology of iPS cells.\n(B) The morphology of iTS-L cells. The morphologies of iPS cells are similar to those of human ES cells. The morphologies of iTS-L cells are similar to those of gut tube endodermal cells. Scale bars = 200 μm.\nImmunodeficient male mice (age: 7 weeks; C. B-17/Icr-scid/scidJcl) are anesthetized with isoflurane inhalation.\nA total of 1.0 × 106 or more cells in 0.1 mL of cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) are subcutaneously injected into the shoulders and buttocks using a 22 G injection needle.",
    "The mice are examined daily, and tumors are extracted at 10 or 15 weeks after surgery.\nQuantitative RT‒PCR\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThe iTS-L cells continuously express HNF1β and HNF4α mRNA but not iPS cells.\nThe iPS/iTS-L cells are cultured in Primate ES Cell Medium to approximately 80% confluence.\nRNA is prepared using a SuperPREP II Cell Lysis & RT Kit for quantitative PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nReal-time PCR analyses are performed using a LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR system. The PCR protocol is as follows. Luna Universal qPCR Master Mix is used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2182_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2182_2.csv"
