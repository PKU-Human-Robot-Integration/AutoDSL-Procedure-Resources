    "1. Settings\nSurface electrode heads were placed over the muscle bellies of left (L) and right (R) respiratory muscles: sternocleidomastoid (SC), scalene (S), upper trapezius on midclavicular line (UT), clavicular portion of pectoralis on midclavicular line (P), diaphragm on parasternal line (D), intercostal at 6th intercostal space on anterior axillary line (IC), rectus abdominus at umbilical level (RA), obliquus abdominis on midaxillary line (O), lower trapezius paraspinally at midscapular level (LT), and paraspinal paraspinally on iliac intercrestal line (PS)6. The ground electrodes were placed over the acromion processes. A Motion Lab System Back Pack Unit, with attached electrodes, was connected to a Motion Lab EMG Desk Top Unit and Powerlab System (Figure 1).\nT-piece Monitoring Circuit to record the airway pressure was assembled as shown in Figure 2 and connected to the Low Pressure Transducer (MP45) using air tube.\nMP45 was connected to CD15 and Powerlab System (Figure 1 and Table 1).\n2. RMCA Protocol\nThe respiratory motor tasks consisted of Maximum Inspiratory Pressure Task (MIPT) and Maximum Expiratory Pressure Task (MEPT). To perform MIPT or MEPT, subjects were asked to produce maximum inspiratory effort from residual volume or expiratory efforts from total lung capacity for 5 sec using a T-piece Monitoring Circuit (Figures 1 and 2). Each maneuver was cued by an audible 5-sec long tone and repeated 3x. At least 1 min of rest was allowed between each effort.\nEMG input was amplified with a gain of 2,000; filtered at 30-1,000 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Airway pressure input was calibrated at 100 cm of water and sampled at 2,000 Hz. The EMG and airway pressure inputs were converted by the Powerlab acquisition system using 16-bit full scale ADC resolution. Airway pressure, sEMG and marker signals were recorded simultaneously9.\n3. Data Analysis",
    "Multi-muscle activity distribution analysis windows of 5 sec each for MIPT or MEPT were determined from the event marker and airway pressure recorded with the cuing tone that signaled the subject when to begin and end the task (Figure 3). The sEMG activity for each muscle was calculated using a root mean square (RMS) algorithm6,12 (Figure 4). Three repeated trials for each task were averaged13 for each muscle (channel).\nThe multi-muscle activation patterns were evaluated based on a vector analysis method known as the Voluntary Response Index (VRI)8 (Figures 4-6) using custom-made Matlab software (MathWorks). For each maneuver, the VRI calculation produces two values, a Magnitude and a Similarity Index (SI) (Figures 5-6). The Magnitude parameter, the amount of combined sEMG activity for all muscles within the specific time window, was calculated as a length of the Response Vector (RV) for specific task (Figure 7). The Similarity Index (SI) provides a value that expresses how similar the RV of SCI subject is to the Prototype Response Vector (PRV) obtained from healthy subjects during the same task. The SI value was computed for each task as a cosine of the angle between the SCI subject RV and PRV. The SI value ranges between 0 and 1.0 where value of 1.0 represents the best match for compared vectors9 (Figure 8) .\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
