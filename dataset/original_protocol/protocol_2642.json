    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPreparing AML Patient Cells\nTiming: 2 h\nPatient samples frozen in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS and 10% DMSO have been stored in liquid nitrogen for 10–30 years. Thus, the thawing process is one of the most critical steps because it determines the viability of AML patient cells and the ultimate success of cell engraftment in mice.\nThaw frozen patient cells rapidly in a water bath at 37°C (<1 min).\nImmediately transfer the thawed cells dropwise into a large volume of pre-warmed 20% FBS-containing RPMI-1640 medium in 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40 μm Cell Strainer to remove cell clumps and debris.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 250 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of 0.25% FBS-containing PBS.\nCount the number of cells in a hemocytometer.\nNote: Perform a 1:10 dilution cell count by resuspending in 5 μL of cell suspension with 45 μL trypan blue\nDetermine the number of viable patient cells to be injected into NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice.\nNote: Divide the total number of viable cells by the number of mice to be injected to calculate how many cells will be injected into each mouse.\nThe mouse number is largely dependent on the total number of viable cells.\nIf possible, inject more than 1 × 106 viable cells per mouse, for at least three individual NSG mice. Otherwise, a minimum of 5 × 105 cells will need to be injected per mouse.\nTransfer the cell suspension to an Eppendorf tube.\nKeep the Eppendorf tubes on ice for injections.\nPerform intravenous (IV) injections in NSG mice.\nNote: Prior to injection, warm mice under a heat lamp till tail vein dilation (5–10 min).",
    "Place mouse cages in the front of a heat lamp and no closer than 15 cm from the lamp.\nMonitor all mice being heated frequently. If mice are observed to be inactive, panting, sweaty, or have red extremities, remove cages from the heat before mice may experience heat exhaustion.\nNote: Load a syringe with patient cells and inject cells into the lateral tail vein using a 27- or 28-gage sterile needle.\nEnsure there are no air bubbles in the syringe.\nThe maximum recommended injection volume is up to 5 mL/kg.\nIV injections should be performed by experienced researchers.\nCritical: Make sure that the cells are kept on ice and are injected immediately after preparation. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nMonitoring Engraftment of Patient Cells in Mouse Peripheral Blood\nTiming: 15 min\nAfter mice are injected with patient cells, assess engraftment of human leukemic cells in mouse peripheral blood starting from 3–4 weeks of implantation. The peripheral blood will be collected and analyzed once per week over a period of 6 months.\nNote: AML patient cells often take 3–6 months to engraft depending on the number and quality of viable cells injected in NSG mice.\nPrepare 1× RBC (red blood cell) lysis buffer.\nPerform a 1:10 dilution of BD Pharm RBC Lysing solution (10×) with ddH2O.\n700 μL of 1× RBC lysis buffer is used for one sample (~20–40 μL of peripheral blood).\nStore the RBC lysis buffer at room temperature (~20°C).\nPrepare a cocktail of antibodies for FACS analysis.\nAdd 4 μL of human CD45 (hCD45)-APC and 2 μL of mouse CD45 (mCD45)-FITC to 94 μL PBS (per reaction/sample).\nmCD45 has a final concentration of 2 ng/mL.\nhCD45 has a final concentration of 1.25 ng/mL.\nKeep on ice until further use.\nProcessing Peripheral Blood to Monitor Engraftment\nTiming: 2 h",
    "About one month after injection, patient cell engraftment in mouse peripheral blood will be monitored through measuring the profile of hCD45+ and mCD45+ cells using FACS analysis.\nCollect about 3 drops (~ 20–40 μL) of tail vein blood into a 0.5 mL MiniCollect tube (K3E K3EDTA).\nNote: The MiniCollect tube prevents coagulation of the blood as it contains EDTA.\nNote: Tail vein blood collections are performed by experienced researchers.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS in the MiniCollect tube and then transfer it to an Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge the Eppendorf tube for 8 min at 250 × g at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nAdd 700 μL of 1× RBC lysis buffer, gently mixing each tube immediately. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nIncubate in the dark at ~20°C for 15 min.\nNote: Do not incubate for longer than 15 min as it could lyse white blood cells.\nAfter incubation, top up with PBS to ~1.4 mL and invert tube to mix.\nCentrifuge at 250 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 95 μL PBS and add 100 μL of antibody cocktail to each tube and mix well.\nVortex briefly to mix well.\nIncubate the tube in the dark for 35 min at 4°C. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nTop up the cell and antibody mixture with PBS (~1 mL) and invert tube to mix.\nCentrifuge at 250 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend one sample aliquot in 200 μL PBS and filter through 35 μm blue filter cap into a polypropylene FACS tube to proceed with FACS analysis using a multicolor flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCanto II).\nAnalyze flow cytometry data using BD FACSDiva software.\nUnstained samples and single stained samples are used to set appropriate photomultiplier tubes voltages that have clear positive and negative populations.",
    "Analyze the results using the FlowJo software (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/230-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Flow Cytometry Plots Depicting Percentages of hCD45 versus mCD45 in the Peripheral Blood of NSG Recipient Mice at the Indicated Days After Implantation\nHarvesting Bone Marrow from AML Patient-Derived Xenograft Models\nTiming: 3–6 h\nEffective collection of bone marrow is an integral part in the process of PDX mouse model establishment and use. This step is to ensure the maximum bone marrow collection from a PDX mouse by harvesting spinal cord and femurs/tibias.\nCritical: To preserve tissue cell viability, it is important to collect and process the tissue samples within 6 h after surgical resection.\nUse scissors and forceps with curved ends.\nUpon confirmation of patient cell engraftment in peripheral blood, euthanize the mouse with carbon dioxide asphyxiation or an alternative method approved in accordance with institutional animal care and use guidelines.\nPlace the mouse onto a sterile surgical pad in a sterile hood.\nPin the mouse in a supine position to a dissection board by putting a pin through each of the four paws. Spray the entire body with 80% ethanol.\nOpen the lower abdominal cavity with sterile scissors and remove the surface muscles to find the pelvic-hip joint and tibia ankle joint (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/230-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dissection of the Mouse Femur and Tibia\nCut off the hind leg above the pelvic-hip joint and below the tibia ankle joint with sharp sterile scissors.\nRemove the residual muscle tissues surrounding the femur and tibia with sterile forceps and scissors.\nNote: Increased spleen size is an important sign of leukemia. Mice with significant engraftment of leukemic cells often have an enlarged spleen.",
    "Femurs and tibias: Cut along the inner side of bone up to the pelvic-hip joint until the incision cannot be continued. Attempt to cut as close to the bone as possible. Then cut along the top of the bone structures. Cut at the hip joint, and then cut the distal tibia ankle joint. Then remove the bones and place them on a rediwipe and proceed to remove as much residual muscle as possible. Cut the bony structure at the knee joint and place in PBS. Repeat for the other femur/tibia.\nSpine: Turn mouse over into the prone position, re-pin, and spray 80% ethanol on the back. Make an incision in the skin over the base of the spine and cut right up till the head and down to the tail. Cut along the left side of the spinal cord until the cut cannot continue any further, then repeat along the right side. Cut underneath the spinal cord removing as much tissue as possible. Cut at the top of the spinal cord and then the bottom at the tail. Place the spinal cord on a rediwipe and proceed to remove as much residual muscle and connective tissue as possible, cutting in one motion alongside bone, and then place in PBS.\nIn a biological safety cabinet, cut and wipe away all muscle tissue from the spinal cord and femurs on a rediwipe, and then place tissue samples in a petri dish submerged in a small amount of PBS.\nPour a small amount of fresh PBS into a mortar and pestle.\nCut the spinal cord into small pieces and place them into the mortar.\nNote: Place scissors and forceps on a petri dish lid to avoid contamination.",
    "Crush the spinal cord, and then place femurs and tibias into the mortar and continue crushing until the fibrous texture is achieved.\nUsing a P1000, pipette in 1 mL PBS from the mortar into a 50 mL centrifuge tube with a 40 μm cell strainer to remove debris. Pipette PBS from the surface, trying not to pipette any bony fibers.\nPour some fresh PBS into the mortar and crush until the remains are white and fibrous.\nPipette PBS from mortar into the tube using stripettes.\nNote: Using stripette will speed up the process.\nNote: If the filter becomes blocked, replace with a new filter and pipette any remaining liquid from the old filter into the new filter.\nPour some fresh PBS into the mortar and pipette the mixture into the 50 mL centrifuge tube with a stripette.\nRepeat steps 44 and 45 until the liquid in tube reaches ~40 mL.\nPlace the centrifuge tubes on ice.\nMice from same cage: wipe away all remaining fibrous tissue with rediwipe and rinse mortar and pestle with PBS.\nMice from different cages: Wash and wipe mortar, pestle, scissors and forceps with 80% ethanol and rinse with PBS.\nRepeat steps 39–47 for all samples, keeping all tubes on ice.\nSpin all the tubes together at 250 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant carefully and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 1× RBC lysis buffer.\nIncubate for 7 min at ~20°C, then inactivate lysis buffer by topping up the tube to 50 mL with PBS.\nCentrifuge at 250 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL freezing media.\nNote: Sterile freezing media composes of 10% DMSO, 50% FBS and 40% RPMI-1640 medium.",
    "Pipette 5 μL of the cell media into an Eppendorf tube for counting.\nDilute 5 μL cell media with trypan blue.\nCreate a 1:100 dilution by adding 495 μL trypan blue to 5 μL of cell suspension.\nCount cells using hemocytometer by putting 10 μL of solution under the coverslip.\nNote: Make sure to wipe hemocytometer with ethanol and wipe dry with chemwipe.\nAfter the cell count, determine the quantity of cells to freeze down for later use. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: Do not put more than 107 cells per cryovial to prevent freeze-thaw cycles and reduce cell viability.\nNote: Aliquot a small number of cells (e.g., 2–5 × 105) in several cryovials for FACS or other downstream analysis.\nTransfer the remaining cells into cryovials (1 mL/vial) to freeze at −80°C freezer for 18–24 h in Nalgene Cryo 1°C Freezing Container, and then transfer to liquid nitrogen on the following day.\nCritical: Be aware of the potential presence of human pathogens. Be sure to adhere to appropriate biosafety protocols when handling human tissues. In addition, appropriate antibiotics should be added to the media to prevent bacterial contamination during tissue processing."
