    "Data collection and data analysis in this project have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Georg-Elias-Müller Institute for Psychology of the University of Göttingen (proposal 289/2021); the protocol follows the guidelines on human research of the Ethics Committees of the Georg-Elias-Müller-Institute for Psychology. The CTG software can be downloaded from the OSF project (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/U24PX) under the link: https://s.gwdg.de/w88YNL.\n1. Prepare technical setup\nPrepare online consent forms and questionnaires\n\t\nPrepare an online consent form in an online questionnaire tool.\nIf applicable, prepare an online questionnaire in an online questionnaire tool.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to include a short questionnaire within the HoneyComb program (see step 1.3.5). To use longer questionnaires, use a separate online questionnaire tool instead. Examples for online questionnaire tools are given in the Table of Materials.\nPrepare remote desktop server\n\t\nInstall a Linux-based operating system on a remote server. If possible, ask technical assistants about the available resources at the institution. Otherwise, follow an installation guideline39.\nCreate different users on this server40.\n\t\t\nCreate a user admin which has root permissions and is accessed solely by the technical lead in the experiment.\nCreate a user experimenter which has permissions to create shared folders, import and export data, and can be accessed by all personnel collecting data (including students/research assistants, etc.).\nCreate multiple users named participant-1, participant-2, etc.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Researchers will only be able to test as many participants in one experimental session as users that are created.\nExecute the command java -version on the admin user to ensure that a Java runtime environment is available on the server. If not, install the most recent Java version before continuing and make sure all users can access it.\nInstall the program\n\t\t\nDownload the program.",
    "NOTE: The program can be downloaded as a zip-file HC_CTG.zip containing 1) the runnable HC.jar, 2) three files for configuration (hc_server.config, hc_panel.config, and hc_client.config), and 3) two subfolders named intro and rawdata.\nCreate a folder on the experimenter user and share it with the other users41. Extract the files from the compressed file HC_CTG.zip into this folder.\nFor each participant user, access this shared folder and check that the user can access the files.\nOpen the three configuration files.\n\t\nEdit hc_server.config and save the edited file.\n\t\t\nConfigure the number of players by setting n_Pl to the desired number. For example, enter 4 behind the =.\nConfigure the number of rounds to play (playOrder) by repeating the game number 54a (e.g., 54a, 54a, 54a, 54a for four rounds).\n\t\t\tNOTE: i54a stands for the instructions and should not be deleted in the configuration file.\nConfigure whether a questionnaire should be shown in HoneyComb by including 200 at the end of playOrder. Delete 200 if a separate online questionnaire tool is used.\nConfigure the investment scale. To configure the scale for investors (iscale), enter which values should be available as investment steps (e.g., 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72). Use integers that are multiples of three so that payouts are also integers.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These configured values are also displayed as possible investment steps to the investors.\n\t\t\t\nConfigure the display scale for trustees (tlabel) by choosing which values should be displayed as possible returns on the playfield (e.g., 0, 1/6, 2/6, 3/6, 4/6, 5/6, 1). NOTE: This scale does not influence the calculation of payouts.\nConfigure the scale for trustees (tscala) by choosing which return values should be possible as returns (e.g., 0, 0.166666, 0.3333, 0.5, 0.6666, 0.833331, 1). Use digital values only (i.e., no fractions).",
    "NOTE: These values are used to calculate payouts and are NOT displayed on the playfield.\nConfigure the time-ins (timeInI for investors, timeInT for trustees) and time-outs (timeOutI for investors, timeout for trustees) in seconds. For example, timeInI = 0, timeOutI = 30, timeInT = 30, and timeout = 45.\nConfigure the amount of money investors and trustees are endowed with in each round in cents (r52).\nConfigure the factor with which the investment is multiplied before being sent to the trustee (f52).\nConfigure whether the group has to reach a unanimous decision (set bUnanimous to true) or not (set unanimous to false)\nConfigure whether the group is paid out in equal parts (set bCommon to true) or according to how much each investor has contributed to the investment (set bCommon to false).\nIf bUnanimous is set to true, configure the penalty-the amount of money deducted from the investors if a unanimous decision is not reached (p52).\nEdit hc_client.config if necessary. Make sure to set ip_nr to localhost so that the clients can connect to the experimenter.\nEdit hc_panel.config.\n\t\t\nAdjust the size of the hexagons (radius) according to the screen resolution. Test the experiment on multiple different screens to ensure that the experiment will be visible on a wide variety of screens.\nAdjust the text that is displayed on the playfield under labels (e.g., Your role is: investor, Account Balance, etc.)\nAdjust and/or translate the instructions, if necessary. To do so, edit and save the simple HTML-files (Figure 2A) in the \"intro\" folder within the HoneyComb program folder.\nIf you want to use the questionnaire within the HoneyComb program, adjust and/or translate the questionnaire in the file qq.txt and save the file.\nKeep this setup constant across all experiment sessions (within one experiment condition). Document all configurations.\n2. Participant recruitment",
    "Online advertisement\n\t\nRecruit participants over available channels (e.g., social media, university blog, flyer with QR-code). Name important information about the experiment, such as its purpose, duration, and maximum payment calculated according to game behavior.\n\t\t​NOTE: The sample presented here was recruited via an online blog for psychology students at the University of Göttingen as well as unpaid advertisements in social media groups. An example flyer can be seen in Supplemental Figure 1.\nMake potential participants aware that participation will require usage of personal laptops/PCs with a stable internet connection and in a quiet, secluded area. Make participants aware that they might need to install a program to establish the Remote Desktop connection.\n\t\tNOTE: Participation via mobile phones or tablets is not possible.\nMake sure the participants meet the experiment's inclusion criteria such as language requirements or color sightedness.\nMake sure the participants have not taken part in previous experiments on the CTG.\nBook experimental sessions with the participants\n\t\nAsk the participants to book time-slots for their participation.\nUse a participant management software to send automated invitation or reminder e-mails.\nOverbook time-slots by at least one participant to ensure enough participants are present to run the experiment.\nSend participants a confirmation e-mail with the following details: guide on computer setup, installation of Remote Desktop Connection Tool, and establishing connection to Remote Desktop. Make sure to NOT send any log in information yet, in order to avoid technical issues due to earlier log in.\nSend participants reminder e-mails about 24 h prior to the experiment, including the link to the video conferencing platform. Include the information about installation that was sent in the confirmation e-mail.\n3. Experimental setup (before each experimental session)\nPrepare the video conferencing platform (Figure 3)",
    "Make sure the participants are blocked from sharing their microphone or camera. Make sure the participants cannot see each other's names.\nShare the experimenter's microphone and camera, and share the screen with minimal instructions on the video conferencing platform (Figure 3).\nPrepare the remote desktop\n\t\nUser experimenter\nStart a remote desktop connection with the experimenter user. Open the shared folder and start a terminal by right clicking in the directory and choosing Open Terminal here.\nStart the server program HC_Gui.jar by typing the command java -jar HC_Gui.jar in the terminal and pressing ENTER.\nUsers participant-1, participant-2, etc.\n\t\t\nEstablish a remote desktop connection with users participant-1, participant-2, .... Open the shared folder and start a terminal in this folder as before.\nStart the client programs for each user by typing the command java -jar HC.jar in the terminal and pressing ENTER.\nCheck whether the connections are established correctly on all participant users.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The participant users' screens should display the message Please wait. The computer is connecting to the server. It is recommended to have as many laptops present as users (Figure 4).\nUser experimenter\n\t\t\nCheck that a line appears in the server GUI, displaying the IP address of each of the participant users. When all participant users are connected, check that the server program displays the message All Clients are connected. Ready to start?. Click on OK.\nCheck that the screens of the participant users display the welcome screen of the experiment (first instructions page).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The experimenter can prepare the session up to this point.\n4. Experimental procedure\nAdmit participants to the video conference at the scheduled experiment time-slot. Welcome all participants using a standardized text. Explain the technical procedure to participants.\nShare the link to the online consent form. Check that all participants have given written consent.",
    "Guide participants to open the Remote Desktop Connection tool and send each participant their individual login data via personal chat in the video conference.\n\tNOTE: When the participants log in to the participant users, the notebooks in the laboratory will lose connection to the participant users. From here on, the experiment runs automatically until the participants reach the final page, instructing them to return to the video conference.\nHave participants confirm that they have read the first instructions page by clicking on OK. Once all participants have confirmed, wait until the participants have completed the game.\n\tNOTE: The participants can page through the instructions at their preferred pace. Once all participants have confirmed that they have read the instructions, the CTG automatically commences. The game progresses automatically through as many rounds as indicated in the server.config file.\nTesting phase\n\t\nAssign participants to one of two roles: investor or trustee.\n\t\tNOTE: Multiple participants can be assigned the same role.\nHave investors start on the bottom-most field (indicated investment of 0) and trustees on the upmost field (indicating return of 0) (Figure 1B).\nInstruct participants to move their avatar by left-click into an adjacent hexagon field. Instruct participants that only adjacent fields can be chosen and fields cannot be skipped. Instruct participants that their avatar will display a small tail for 4000 ms after each move that indicates the last direction from which they moved to the current field (Figure 1C).\nAllow investors to move from the beginning (time-in = 0) to indicate through movement how much they would like to invest. After a certain amount of time, prohibit the movement of investors (time-out).",
    "NOTE: The field on which they stand will then indicate how much is invested. In the middle of the playfield, a blue number will additionally show the amount sent to the trustee. If the experiment is set up to require unanimous invests, investments will only be made if all participants stand on the same field.\nExplain in the instructions that the invested amount is multiplied by a factor (e.g., three) and sent to the trustees. Restrict the trustees from moving for as long as the investors are moving by setting the trustee time-in to the length of the trustee time-out.\nInstruct the trustees to move to indicate the fraction they would like to return to the investors. Once the trustee time-out is reached, the field on which the trustees stand is taken to indicate the fraction that is returned to the investors. The amount returned is also indicated in the middle of the playfield by a yellow number (Figure 1D).\nHave the pop-up window display the amount of money the person has earned at the end of the round (Figure 1E).\nRepeat the game round as needed (i.e., as indicated in the server.config file).\nOnce all rounds are completed, ask participants to generate a personal unique code so that the in-game earnings can be connected to their name while keeping the behavioral data anonymous.\nAfter participants have generated the code, display a screen which instructs participants to return to the video conference and close the Remote Desktop connection.\n\t\t​NOTE: The experimental procedure (section 4 in this protocol with 15 game rounds) takes 35 min.\nIf technical issues or failure of a participant require that the experiment session is aborted, refrain from restarting the experiment with the same participants.\nPost-testing phase",
    "Once the game is completed, make sure that all participants have closed the Remote Desktop connection. Have the participants fill out questionnaires as seen fit for a specific research question.\nWhile the participants are filling out the questionnaires, close the server program on the experimenter user by clicking on Stop & Exit. This will also close the program on the participant users.\nThank participants for their time and explain how and when their earnings will be transferred to them. Make sure all participants have left the video conference, especially if another experiment time-slot is scheduled directly afterwards.\n5. Finishing the experiment\nTransfer and back up the data (e.g., in the cloud), in the form of one *.csv and one *.txt file per group and experiment time-slot, marked by a day- and time-stamp of the experiment.\nClose all Remote Desktop connections.\nSubscription Required.
