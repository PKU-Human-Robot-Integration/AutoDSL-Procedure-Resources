    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of liposomes encapsulating a diluted E. coli TX-TL system\nTiming: 90 min\nIn this step, liposomes are prepared by a modified droplet-transfer method (Fujiwara and Yanagisawa, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])\nPreparation of lipid solution\nDry 40 μL of 25 mg/mL POPC (dissolved in chloroform and stored at −20°C in a round glass microtube) under Ar or N2 gas flow. We typically perform this process without using a vacuum desiccator.\nAdd 500 μL mineral oil to the dried POPC.\nIncubate the lipid solution at 80°C for 1 h (e.g., in an Aluminum block incubator). Do not cap the tube in this process.\nCool the tube to room temperature (20°C–30°C).\nAfter capping the tube by an attached screw cap, vortex the lipid solution for 1 min.\nNote: The lipid solution can be stored at room temperature (20°C–30°C) for at least more than several hours with the tube wrapped by aluminum foil. Vortex again before the emulsification (step 2).\nEmulsification\nPrepare the TX-TL system solution on ice.\nAdd 20 μL of ultrapure water to 5 μL of the TX-TL system to generate a 1/5-fold dilution.\nAdd 50 μL of the lipid solution into a 0.6 mL tube and pipette 1 μL of the diluted TX-TL system to the lipid solution.\nNote: From this step, prepare samples at room temperature (20°C–30°C) .\nTap the tube about 10 times for emulsification.\nNote: The size range of liposomes depends on how strong and how many times you tap the tube in this step. We recommend preparing liposomes larger than 5 μm (diameter) for microscopic observation. You may need to optimize this step in order to get an appropriate size range.",
    "Note: Keep the emulsified solution at room temperature (20°C–30°C) until used in step 3d. Tapping the tube might be required to form emulsions again just before step 3d.\nPreparation of liposomes\nPrepare the External buffer.\nAdd 80 μL of ultrapure water to 20 μL of the External buffer in a 1.7 mL tube to generate a 1/5-fold dilution (in order to balance the osmotic pressure between the inside and outside of the liposomes).\nCarefully add 50 μL of the lipid solution (prepared in step 1) on top of the diluted External buffer with pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAdd 50 μL of the emulsified solution (prepared in step 2) onto the oil phase with the lipids (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: Be careful not to mix the emulsified solution with the phase of diluted External buffer (water phase).\nCentrifuge at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and remove the oil phase.\nNote: Remove as much of the oil phase as possible. Contaminant oil forms a liposome-like sphere structure in the solution (oil in water emulsion).\nRecover liposomes by gently pipetting the bottom of the tube and transfer the liposome solution into a new 0.6 mL tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1241-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Pipetting emulsion onto the oil phase\n(A) Lipids in oil is added on top of the diluted External buffer.\n(B) Emulsion is pipetted onto the oil phase.\n(C) A resultant solution with phases. The solution is centrifuged to form liposomes at the next step.\nActivation of the TX-TL system inside liposomes by hypertonic treatment\nTiming: 1–16 h. (Depending on reaction time.)",
    "In this step, the prepared liposomes are treated by osmolytes to concentrate molecules within liposomes, and the activation of the TX-TL system is confirmed by measuring sfGFP fluorescence. A fluorescent microscope is used to obtain the fluorescent images. We use sfGFP expression as a demonstration of this protocol. Other genes should be expressed by the protocol. We have confirmed the expression of α-hemolysin by the protocol (Akui et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nFor the experimental condition, mix 20 μL of 2× External buffer with 20 μL of liposome solution in a 1.7 mL tube by gently pipetting. As a negative control (without hypertonic treatment), mix 20 μL 1/5-diluted External buffer with 20 μL of liposome solution in another 1.7 mL tube by gently pipetting.\nIncubate the sample at 25°C for an appropriate time (1–16 h).\nNote: The activation of the TX-TL system starts as soon as you add a 2× External buffer to the liposome solution. It may take 30 min to an hour for the sfGFP to be expressed to a detectable level. (In the case that T7 promoter is used for DNA template, the speed of protein synthesis and the final amount will be higher than when the endogenous promoter is used.)\nPipette the reacted sample (hypertonic treatment) into the central chamber made of silicon spacer on a slide glass (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Do the same for the negative control on a separate glass slide.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1241-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Note: To prevent the reacted sample from drying, cover the sample with another slide glass (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), especially if the pipetted sample volume is a few microliters or the observation takes a long time.\nObserve the fluorescence of mCherry (indicator) and sfGFP (synthesized protein), respectively, by fluorescent microscope."
