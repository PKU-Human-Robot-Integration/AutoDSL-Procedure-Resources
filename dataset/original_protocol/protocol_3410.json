Schematic of production of lentivirus (LVs) from transfected HEK293T cells\nLVs that up-regulation of PTN gene were constructed by the third-generation lentiviral vectors. Virus particles are harvested immediately after consecutive 3-day viral supernatant collection.\nNote: Dilute total DNA (target plasmid and helper plasmid) and PEI (1 mg/mL) in 1:2.5 ratio (1 μg of DNA: 2.5 μL of PEI)\nTake one sterile 50 mL Eppendorf (EP) tube, add 5 mL of Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Media, and add the plasmids as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3174_6.csv\nMix this mixture by pipette (approximately 10 times) using a 5 mL disposable pipette. Label the tube “DNA” and incubate for 5 min at 25°C.",
    "Note: When you first use those plasmids, check your plasmid with restriction enzymes or sequence to make sure you have right plasmid (e.g.: cutting the VSV-G plasmid with restriction endonucleases HindIII and EcoRI produces three fragments of 5.4 kb, 1.6 kb and 0.58 kb in length; cutting the pMDLg plasmid with restriction endonuclease EcoRI produces three fragments of 4.3 kb, 4.1 kb and 0.4 kb in length; and cutting the pRSV-Rev plasmid with restriction endonuclease EcoRI produces two fragments of 4.1 kb and 0.3 kb in length). The concentration of plasmid also needs to be confirmed to ensure the amount added (e.g.: the original concentration of VSV-G is 800 ng/μL (measured by NanoDrop instrument), therefore the volume of VSV-G added is 50 μL (40∗1000/800 = 50 μL)).\nTake another sterile 50 mL EP tube, add 5 mL of Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Media, add 862.5 μL PEI (1 mg/mL), mix by pipette (approximately 10 times) using a 5 mL disposable pipette. Label the tube “PEI” and incubate for 5 min at 25°C.\nNote: PEI, a non-viral cationic polymer, can be used to transfect plasmid DNA or siRNA into suspension or adherent cells due to its low toxicity, low cost, and low immunogenicity.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nAlternatives: You can use Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent to replace PEI.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nAdd PEI diluent to plasmid diluent 50 mL EP tube (DNA tube), gently mix by pipette (approximately 10 times) using a 10 mL disposable pipette. Incubate for 20 min at 25°C.\nTake out 5 dishes of HEK293T cell from incubator, add 2 mL the mixture of DNA-PEI drop by drop to each dish, gently mix, mark dishes, and put them back to incubator.\nRemove media by aspiration after 4–6 h transfection, add 13 mL fresh culture media (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to each dish.",
    "Critical: Transfection time cannot over 6 h, if the transfection time is too long, it will affect the cell heath and survival.\nHarvest released viral particles by collecting viral supernatant at 40, 64, and 88 h in a T75 flask, stored at 4°C.\nNote: It is important to change the media with extreme gentleness to avoid the detach from the plate.\nCritical: Check the transfection efficiency approximately 40 h after transfection through detecting whether the transfected cells have bright florescent. If efficiency is <80%, it means that you should have not made virus out of it, stop your experiment.\nFilter virus through a 0.22 μm vacuum bottle filter and centrifuge at 49000 g, 4°C for 2 h. Discard the supernatant by aspiration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3174-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation for lentivirus (LVs) harvest by ultracentrifugation\n(A) Main components before LVs harvest by ultracentrifugation.\n(B) The ultracentrifuge is used for LVs harvest.\n(C) The proper SW32Ti swinging-bucket rotor and the matched six tubes were well installed.\n(D) Choose the right rotor and laboratory consumables.\n(E) Set up the correct parameters in order: 20,000 rpm, 2 h, and 4°C.\nAlternatives: If you do not have ultracentrifuge, you can use polyethylene glycol 6000 to concentration and purification of the virus.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nWash virus once with cold DPBS and then perform the final centrifugation at 49000 g, 4°C for 2 h.\nLeave approximately 100 μL of cold DPBS in the tube to resuspend the viruses’ particles, and then stored at 4°C for 24 h.\nAliquot the viruses at 10 μL per 1.5 mL tube, store at −80°C.\nNote: All instruments, container, tips, tubes used for packaging LVs should be decontaminated with freshly made 10% bleach after use.\nMeasure virus titer by infecting HEK293T cells with serially diluted virus preparations.",
    "Plate HEK293T cells in 6-well plate (5 × 10ˆ4 cells/per well) a day before viral titer infection.\nPrepare viruses of different titers by serial dilution (1:1, 1:10, 1:100…1:10ˆ6).\n2 μL different titers of virus are added separately to each well with 72–120 h incubation at 37°C.\nWash with PBS three times.\nAdd 200 μL trypsin (stored at 4°C for several months) to each well for 5 min, then collect the cells solution into a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tube and add 600 μL 4% PFA.\nNote: Samples can keep stable for one week when stored at 4°C in the dark.\nCalculate viral titer from FACS result.\nSince 5∗10ˆ4 cells are cultured the day before infection, there are 1∗10ˆ6 cells at the time of viral infection. It is calculated as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3174_7.csv\nThe average of the three viral concentrations is (2.5 + 3.5+5)/3∗10ˆ5 = 4.0∗10ˆ5 particles/μL or 4.0∗10ˆ8 particles/mL. The viral titer is 4.0∗10ˆ8 particles/mL.\nNote: A minimum of ∼1×109 infectious particles per ml is recommended.\nFor more detailed protocol of lentivirus production see Fricano-Kugler et al. and Guo et al.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nPreparation for surgery of animals\nTiming: 1 h\nAssemble the stereotaxic instrument, the dental drill and the rodent anesthesia machine (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3174-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Surgical instruments and key procedures of lentivirus (LVs) stereotactic injection into the dentate gyrus (DG) of adult hippocampus\n(A) Main components of the stereotactic system.\n(B) Stereotaxic markers on the skull.\n(C) Two small holes drilled for LVs injection. The coordinate used for the LVs injection into the DG (AP: 2.0 mm, ML: ±1.7 mm, DV: -1.9 mm).\n(D) LVs injection at a rate of 0.2 μL/min through the syringe pump controller.\n(E) After injection, close the incision and place the mouse on a heating pad until it wakes up.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane by a mask.\nNote: Induction with 5% gas in air mixture before transferring to the stereotactic frame, then maintenance at 2%.\nAlternatives: The 2% isoflurane can be replaced by sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection) or avertin (400 mg/kg i.p. injection).\nWait until the mouse is fully anesthetized, then inject Ketoprofen (3–5 mg/kg) via i.p. route to manage pain.\nAlternatives: Ketoprofen can be replaced by Carprofen (5–10 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection).\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad to keep a steady body temperature.\nNote: Mice under anesthesia may have difficulties regulating body temperature, a heat pad will prevent hypothermia and unexpected animal deaths during surgical procedures.\nMoisten the mouse eyes with ointment to prevent drying and infection.\nUse an electric razor to remove hair from the top of the head.\nSanitize the skin with 75% ethanol.\nNote: If possible, please perform a complete surgical scrub consisting on 3 independent cleaning procedures alternating Alcohol and iodine.\nExposure of the skull and drilling\nTiming: 10 min\nLatch the mouse front teeth onto the anterior clamp of the adapter on the stereotactic instrument, and adjust the rods into the crevices just anterior to the animal’s ears to fix the head.\nNote: Make sure the mouse head well fixed and firm.\nUse a scalpel to make an anterior-posterior incision of about 1.5 cm between the ears.\nNote: A local injection of 0.25% bupivacaine (30 μL) for at least one minute prior to incision can help improve postoperative pain until the NSAIDs kick in.\nUsing a sterile cotton swab clean the surface of the skull to make sure the bregma and the lambda are visible (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: Bregma is the intersection between the coronal and sagittal sutures; Lambda is the intersection between the coronal and lambdoid sutures.",
    "Point the tip of the microinjection syringe, held by the needle holder, to the bregma point, considered as the zero point of the three axes.\nKeep the syringe on a vertical axis so as not to scratch the skull during planar movement and then move the syringe head to the correct position.\nCritical: Zero the instrument on the range to be used for measurement.\nNote: Not all stereotactic frames are built in digital measure tools. It requires operators have a knowledge in the use of Vernier scale in non-digital equipment.\nFind the coordinates of the DG based on the atlas of the mouse brain8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]: −2.0 mm posterior to the bregma, ±1.7 mm lateral to the midline, -1.9 mm ventral to the surface of the skull.\nMove the needle of the syringe according above coordinates, label the two positions with a marker.\nRaise the syringe in the vertical axis and move the tip to a safe position.\nUsing a fine dental drill (0.6 mm drill bit) carefully grind the skull at the target site to two shallow holes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: It is recommended to use angled Drill position instead of vertical to avoid falling deep in to the brain tissue. If bleeding occurs during this procedure, use a small medical cotton ball to soak up the blood.\nCritical: Drilling holes must be properly controlled, otherwise brain tissue damage can easily be caused accidentally after drilling through the skull, which adversely affects the process and results of the experiments.\nLentivirus injection\nTiming: ∼20 min\nTake out the moderate consumption of LVs from -80°C refrigerator, and put it on the ice right before viral loading.",
    "Note: Lentivirus expressing PTN are named as lenti-PTN and lentivirus without the gene of interest (e.g.: PTN) are named as lenti-NC to be prepared and used as control.\nCritical: Virus is stored in the freezer at −80°C. Use it immediately after removal, and avoid multiple freeze-thaw processes.\nClean the microinjection syringe with sterile PBS and withdraw 1 μL of the concentrated LVs solution.\nNote: When connecting the needle to the micro syringe pump, ensure that the tip of the needle is vertical and that there are no air bubbles inside the needle. A good practice is to collect and withdraw volumes to remove the air. Specifically, a first collection with a Hamilton will take significant air that can be seen in the plunger end (more than 5μL).\nPlace the syringe over the hole and slowly lower it vertically until it reaches the surface of the brain. Set the dorsal/ventral (D/V) coordinate (depth) to 0.\nLower the syringe to reach the DG, set D/V to −1.9 mm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nSet the digital pump to 0.2 μL/min (1 μL would be injected in 5 min) and start infusion.\nNote: Infusion at a slow pace allows the virus to spread efficiently into the tissues and prevents reflux.\nAfter finishing the infusion, wait an additional 5 min to complete diffusion of LVs into the brain rather than backflow of viral solution up the needle track.\nSlowly remove the syringe out of the brain and watch for fluid backflow.\nNote: If reflux is clearly observed, it means partial loss of LVs injection.\nRinse the microinjection syringe with sterile PBS again to remove traces of blood on the tip of the needle and keep the syringe is unobstructed.\nRepeat step 27–32 for another hemisphere.",

Nonsignificant comparisons were not identified. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.\nCritical: Make fresh solution for BrdU injection each day.\nNote: Take the injection at the same time each day.\nEdU injection\nOne week after the operation, mice receive EdU injection to assess NSCs proliferation.\nNote: In this study, PTN overexpressing lentivirus showed higher infection efficiency in mouse hippocampus one week after injection, so we performed proliferation assay one week later. However, the timing can be adjusted depending on the purpose of the experiment; for example, some studies have assayed NSCs proliferation 2 or 3 weeks after viral injection.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nTreat mice with EdU at 100 mg/kg i.p. and then sacrificed 2 h after injection to assess NSCs proliferation in vivo (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nCritical: Make fresh solution for injection.\nBrain sections preparation\nTiming: ∼4 days\nNote: At the experimental time point, mouse is anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% PFA.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nFix brain in 4% PFA for 24 h.\nEquilibrated in 30% sucrose (stored at 4°C for 1 month) for 2 days.\nCut 40 μm-thick coronal sections by a sliding microtome.\nFloating sections stored in 96-well plates filled with cryoprotectant solution at 4°C.\nEdU detection and immunofluorescent staining\nTiming: 2 days\nTake out brain sections of 96 well plates.\nWash the floating sections with 0.01 M PBS three times, each time for 5 min at 25°C, and gently shaking.",
