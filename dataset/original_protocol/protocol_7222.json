    "Optimization of FCM parametersTake 50 mL exponentially growing cultures of unicellular (S. elongatus PCC 7942 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803) and filamentous (Fremyella diplosiphon BK14) cyanobacteria grown under the abovementioned conditions (item 14 of Materials and Reagents).Remove growth medium by centrifugation at 6,000 × g and 25°C for 10 min and dilute the samples with 0.1 M PBS buffer to different O.D.750, i.e., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8. Make 1 mL final volume of each cell concentration in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Clean nozzle of BD FACSCalibur with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution and Milli-Q water.Note: Turn on the BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer 10–15 min before conducting the experiment. Calibration of BD FACSCalibur with QC beads at regular intervals is recommended. Draw two dot plots in BD CellQuest Pro software, i.e., Forward Scatter (FSC) vs. Side Scatter (SSC) and FSC vs. Fluorescence channel 3 (FL3). Similarly, draw two histogram plots of Fluorescence channel 1 (FL1) and FL3. Set log scale for all parameters. FL1 and FL3 are two Fluorescence channels that detect DCF fluorescence (green fluorescence, emission range 515–545 nm) and autofluorescence of Chlorophyll (Chl) ɑ (red fluorescence, emission range >670 nm), respectively. The FSC vs. SSC plot provides information about cell size, shape, and granularity; the FSC vs. FL-3 plot is used to select the cyanobacterial population-based on Chl ɑ autofluorescence and cell size. The FL-1 and FL-3 histogram plot provides the fluorescence intensity of DCF and Chl ɑ, respectively.Transfer samples from step 2 to a 3 mL round bottom polystyrene tube and acquire all samples with a low flow rate (12 μL/min), adjusting the PMT voltages of FSC, SSC, FL1, and FL3 for different organisms, as shown in Figure 1A.",
    "The adjusted optimal PMT voltage is used for analyzing all the samples of the same organism, which provides fluorescence intensity from the cell in the absence of DCFH-DA. This background fluorescence of cells is excluded while measuring the mean fluorescence intensity of DCF in DCFH-DA treated cells to estimate ROS levels. Set FSC as the primary parameter and FL3 as the secondary parameter.Acquire 50,000–100,000 events. Keep sample acquisition rate below 1,000 events/second to avoid exposure of more than one cell to laser beam at the same time.Note the minimum O.D.750 (from step 2) value that gives sample acquisition rate between 500–1,000 events/second to determine the appropriate cell density of each cyanobacterium required for getting proper signals from FCM.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4417/bioprotoc-12-10-4417-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Dot plot diagram of FSC-H vs. SSC-H showing relative size and cellular complexity, respectively, of the test organism (D).Optimization of DCFH-DA dye concentrationTake 10 mL sample of optimized O.D.750 (refer to steps 2–7 of section A) for each organism in a 15 mL Falcon tube. Add 100 mM H2O2 to each sample and incubate for 1 h under growth conditions described in item 14 of the Materials and Reagents section.After incubation, pellet cells by centrifugation at 6000 × g and 25°C for 10 min, and wash the cells twice with 10 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4).After washing, suspend the cells in 10 mL of 0.1 M PBS and divide into 1 mL of aliquots.",
    "Add different concentrations (0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 µM) of DCFH-DA to 1 mL of cell aliquots using DCFH-DA stock solutions (item 20 of Materials and Reagents section).Incubate cells for 1 h in the dark with ~150 rpm rocking at 25°C.Analyze cells using FCM immediately after 1 h of incubation.Wash FCM and set BD CellQuest Pro software with optimized PMT voltage (refer to section A).Acquire samples with low flow rate (12 μL/min).Determine the minimum concentration of dye required for in vivo detection of ROS for each organism by analyzing the titration curve, as shown in Figure 1B.Detection of in vivo ROS using FCMAfter determining the optimum cell and dye concentration for each organism (refer to sections A and B), take cyanobacterial cells from different experimental conditions. Here, we used different cyanobacteria that were grown in conditions mentioned in item 14 of the Materials and Reagents section.Pellet cells by centrifugation at 6,000 × g and 25°C for 10 min, and wash the cells twice with 1 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). After washing, resuspend cells in 1 mL of 0.1 M PBS buffer.Incubate cells with the determined concentration of dye for 1 h in the dark with rocking.After incubation, separate samples in two microcentrifuge tubes and immediately acquire one of them with the help of a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer using optimized settings. Use another aliquot of cells for ROS detection by fluorescence microscopy, as described by Rastogi et al. (2010) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4417/bioprotoc-12-10-4417-g002.jpgFigure 2.
