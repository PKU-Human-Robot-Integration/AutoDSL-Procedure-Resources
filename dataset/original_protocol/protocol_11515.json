    "All procedures were approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Cell Preparation for Orthotopic Injections\nCulture human ES cells under standard conditions. Use approximately one 15-cm cell culture plate not exceeding 70% of confluency for injection of 5 mice.\n\tNOTE: For this study, SK-ES1 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) on collagen-coated plates and TC71 cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and 1% 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES). Both media were supplemented with antibiotics — penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml) and fungizone (1 µg/ml).\nWash the ES cells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsinize at 70% confluence with 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 5 min.\nRemove the ES cells from the plate with cell culture media, then centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g at room temperature. Re-suspend the ES cells in 10 ml of cold PBS and then count the number of cells.\nCentrifuge ES cells for 5 min at 200 x g at room temperature, and then re-suspend at 2 x 107 (SK-ES1) or 107 (TC71) cells per ml in cold PBS. Keep the final cell suspension on ice while performing injections.\n2. Orthotopic Injection of ES cells into Gastrocnemius Muscle\nUse 4-6 week old female SCID/beige mice.\nTo inject ES cells, gently hold the mouse and stabilize its left leg between the fourth and fifth fingers, exposing the medial side of the lower hindlimb.\nUsing a 28 G ½ needle, inject 0.1 ml of the previously prepared cell suspension that contains either 2 x 106 (SK-ES1) or 106 (TC71) ES cells into the gastrocnemius muscle (Figure 2A).",
    "NOTE: Although maximum volume for intramuscular injections is typically 0.05 ml, for this particular procedure the volume increase to 0.1 ml is necessary due to the high cell number injected. This procedure has been approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\t\nInsert the needle into the gastrocnemius muscle anteriorly at approximately a 30 - 45 degree angle in the direction of the tibial crest/tuberosity.\nSlightly withdraw the needle once it touches the tibial crest/tuberosity. Slowly inject the cell suspension solution, gradually withdrawing the needle to release pressure.\nMonitor the injected mice over the next 24 hr for signs of distress. \n\tNOTE: Investigators with less experience in animal handling should consider anesthetizing mice for tumor cell injections. Some institutions may require anesthesia for safety reasons.\n3. Monitoring Primary Tumor Growth\nMonitor the growth of primary tumors daily until the tumor size reaches the desired volume.\n\tNOTE: In the current study, a calf volume of 250 mm3 was used as a starting point of the experiment (Figure 2B). Typically, it takes approximately 1 - 2 weeks for the tumors to reach this size.\n\t\nMeasure the calf size daily with digital calipers via its medial-lateral and anterior-posterior lengths.\nDetermine the calf volume by the formula (D x d2/6) x 3.14, where D is the longer diameter and d is the shorter diameter of the tumor-bearing lower hindlimb.\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the normal adult mouse calf is of approximately 40 - 50 mm3. Its volume will increase due to tumor growth and at the later stages the calf will be mainly comprised of tumor tissue.\n4. Femoral Artery Ligation (FAL) for Inducing Hypoxia in the Tumor-bearing Hindlimb",
    "Prepare the surgical tools needed for this operation: curved or pointed fine forceps, pointed forceps, surgical scissors and a needle holder. Sterilize these tools prior to surgery using an autoclave or a hot-bead sterilizer. Additionally, have fine cotton swabs ready for this surgery.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended that the tools be re-sterilized at the tips as needed during the procedure.\nInject analgesic agent (Carprofen 5 mg/kg) subcutaneously (SQ). To detect and confirm hypoxia, inject hypoxyprobe-1 (pimonidazole, 60 mg/kg).\n\tNOTE: This dose equates to 1.5 mg per mouse and is achieved by injecting 0.1 ml of 15-mg/ml hypoxyprobe solution in PBS intraperitoneally (IP). The hypoxyprobe is then detectable postmortem in animal tissues by immunohistochemistry.\nPlace the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber containing 3 - 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 1 L/min.\nLeave the mouse in the induction chamber until it is unresponsive to external stimuli. Then remove the animal from the induction chamber. Place the animal in the supine position on a sterile drape placed atop a warming pad on the operating surface. Use a nose cone to connect it to a continuous flow of 1 - 3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 0.8 L/min.\n\t\nApply sterile non-medicated ophthalmic ointment to each eye to prevent corneal drying. To thoroughly depilate the surgical area, apply hair removal cream, leaving it on the skin for no more than 10 sec. Then wipe off the hair removal cream using an ethanol prep pad.",
    "Extend and secure the hindlimb with a piece of tape approximately 45 degrees from the midline of the mouse. Once the hindlimb is secure, wipe the exposed skin with 10% povidone/iodine swab/solution, followed by ethanol, repeating two more times each. For the remainder of the surgical procedure, use a stereo microscope to obtain an enlarged view of the hindlimb region.\nUsing pointed forceps and surgical scissors, make an incision of the skin, approximately 1 cm long, from mid-thigh towards the inguinal region. Using saline-moistened fine cotton swabs, gently brush away subcutaneous fat tissue surrounding the thigh muscle.\nCarefully reveal the underlying femoral artery via blunt dissection through the subcutaneous fat tissue. Stabilize the wound and surgical field to expose the vasculature of the mid-upper adductor muscle.\nUsing fine forceps, gently pierce through the membranous femoral sheath to expose the neurovascular bundle. Using a clean set of fine forceps, dissect and separate the femoral artery from the femoral vein and nerve at the proximal location near the groin, distal to the inguinal ligament. Use caution to avoid piercing the femoral vein wall.\nFollowing dissection, pass a strand of 6-0 silk suture underneath the femoral artery and distal to the branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA). Occlude the femoral artery using double knots (Figure 3).\nClose the incision using 6-0 polypropylene sutures. After closing the incision, inject SQ 0.5 ml of warm saline for fluid balance therapy. Place the animal on top of a draped warm pad in the recovery cage and monitor continuously until awake.\nMonitor the animals during first 6 hr after surgery and inject the analgesic agent (Carprofen 5 mg/kg, SQ) every day for 3 days. Remove sutures 10 days post-surgery using sterile scissors.\n5. Primary Tumor Excision by Leg Amputation",
    "NOTE: Amputate the tumor-bearing lower hindlimb when the calf size reaches 250 mm3 for the control group or 3 days after FAL for the hypoxic group.\nShave hair from the tumor-bearing limb from the distal tibia to the pelvic region with hair clippers while gently holding the animal. Inject the analgesic agent (Carprofen 5 mg/kg, SQ) before the procedure.\nPlace the mouse into an anesthesia induction chamber containing 3 - 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 1 L/min. Leave the mouse in the induction chamber until it is unresponsive to external stimuli. Then remove the animal from the induction chamber.\nPlace the animal in the right lateral recumbent position on a sterile drape placed on a warming pad on the operating surface. Use a nose cone to connect it to a continuous flow of isoflurane 1 - 3% in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 0.8 L/min. Apply sterile non-medicated ophthalmic ointment to each eye to prevent corneal drying\nPrepare the surgical site using 10% povidone/iodine swab/solution, followed by ethanol, repeating 3 times. Apply a sterile gauze (e.g., surgical drape) over the mouse to obtain a sterile surgical field.\nMake a middle femoral circumferential skin incision, followed by blunt dissection and retraction of the skin proximally. Expose the medial femoral neurovascular pedicle on the median side of the leg, and then ligate near the inguinal ligament using 4-0 coated (polyglactin 910) absorbable suture material.\nPerform a mid-femoral transection of muscle groups with scissors, followed by blunt dissection of soft tissue to the coxofemoral joint. Using a bone cutter, perform a mid-femoral osteotomy. Using a sterile fine cotton swab or an absorbable gelatin sponge, gently press the osteotomy site to minimize and prevent bleeding.",
    "Close the overlying skin using surgical wound clips and inject 0.5 ml of warm saline SQ for fluid balance therapy. Place the animal on top of a draped warm pad in the recovery cage and monitor continuously until awake.\nUpon surgery, collect tissue samples from primary tumors for RNA, DNA or protein isolation, snap freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 ˚C. For primary cell culture, collect tissue samples at this step, as described in section 9 below. Fix the remaining limb tissue in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for histology and immunochemistry, including hypoxyprobe-1 detection.\nMonitor the animals for locomotion, pain and food consumption during the first 6 hours after surgery, then every day for 3 days. Inject the analgesic agent (Carprofen 5 mg/kg, SQ) daily for 3 days. Remove the wound clips 10 days after amputation using a wound clip remover.\n6. Monitoring Mice for the Presence of Metastases\nObserve the mice daily and evaluate them for clinical signs of metastasis at least twice a week.\n\t\nObserve the animals for the presence of macrometastases presenting as masses that develop in various locations, typically shoulders, contralateral legs and jaws. To this end, carefully palpate head, neck and axillary regions, and contralateral hindlimb. Check for internal organ metastases via abdominal distension along with MRI scanning.\nCheck for the presence of lung metastases by pressing the xyphoid process (the lower end of the sternum) with index finger.24\n\t\tNOTE: This pressure diminishes the diaphragmatic respiration capacity. Mice with advanced lung metastases show signs of respiratory distress manifested by laborious breathing.\nObserve the animals for neurological symptoms, such as leg paralysis and ataxia suggesting metastases to the central nervous system.",
    "Monitor the mice at least once per week for weight loss, as an indication of potential disease progression. Body weight loss exceeding 15% of the pre-procedural weight is considered a humane endpoint. \n7. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for Detecting Metastases\nPerform MRI to detect metastases at desired time points.18\n\tNOTE: In the current study, a 7-Tesla horizontal spectrometer was used. MRI was performed at days 15 and 35 post-amputation for SK-ES1 cells and at day 15 for TC71 cells.\nPlace the mouse into an anesthesia induction chamber containing 1 - 3% isoflurane in a gas mixture of 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide.\nLeave the mouse in the induction chamber until it is unresponsive to external stimuli. Then remove the animal from the induction chamber.\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse onto a stereotaxic holder with respiration and temperature monitorization with continuous administration of 1.5% isoflurane and 30% nitrous oxide. Apply sterile non-medicated ophthalmic ointment to each eye to prevent corneal dryness. Image the animal either in a 40 or 23 mm Bruker mouse volume coil for whole body or brain imaging, respectively.\nUse a two-dimensional, T2-weighted RARE sequence: TR = 3,000 msec, TE = 24 msec, matrix = 256, FOV = 4.35 x 3.0 cm, slice thickness = 0.5 mm, RARE factor = 4 and averages = 4.18\nPlace the animal in a warm recovery cage and monitor continuously until awake.\n\tNOTE: The mice will recover rapidly since a shallow plane of anesthesia is used.\nMonitor the animals during the first 6 hr after imaging to make sure that there are no adverse effects of the anesthesia.\n8. Euthanasia and Necropsy\nEuthanize the mice once the animals present with metastases detectable by MRI and/or clinical symptoms of disease progression.",
    "NOTE: In the current study, the mice were sacrificed at days 50 and 25 post-amputation for animals bearing SK-ES1 and TC71 xenografts, respectively. In some cases, earlier euthanasia was necessary due to a high metastasis burden.\nEuthanize the mice by exposure to CO2 at 1.5 L/min (CO2 at 10 - 30% of the euthanasia chamber vol/min). To ensure animal death, perform cervical dislocation after CO2 exposure.\nSpray the entire mouse with 70% ethanol and place it into the laminar flow hood. Collect the blood by heart puncture using a 25 G ½ needle with a 1 ml syringe and transfer to a blood collection tube containing 2 mg of EDTA.\nCollect the following tissues: spleen, adrenal glands, ovaries, kidneys, liver, lungs, brain, right leg, bone marrow from both humeri and spine, as well as macroscopic metastases present in other locations.25,26\nFix half of each tissue in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for histology and immunochemistry, including hypoxyprobe-1 detection. Snap freeze the other half in liquid nitrogen, then store at -80 ˚C for RNA, DNA or protein isolation.25,26 For primary cell culture, collect tissue samples as described in section 9 below.\n9. Primary Cell Culture\nTo perform primary cell culture, dissect tissues from the amputated limb (section 5 above) or during the necropsy (section 8 above) under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.\nPrepare cell culture media appropriate for the cell line used for orthotopic injections, supplemented with penicillin (200 units/ml), streptomycin (200 µg/ml), fungizone (1 µg/ml), and 0.2% mycoplasma prophylactic antibiotic. Place 2.5 ml of the primary culture medium into a 6-cm cell culture plate.\nSelect viable tumor tissue areas from primary tumors or metastases, and then isolate two to three segments at 2-3 mm each using sterile scissors.",
    "NOTE: Viable tumor tissue is usually found on the edges of the tumor and can be discriminated from necrosis by its pinkish or reddish color, significant luster and overall wet appearance. In contrast, necrotic tissue is commonly seen in the center of the tumor and presents as a whitish/cream color mass with a dull, cheesy appearance.27\nTransfer the isolated segments to a 6-cm cell culture plate containing primary culture medium described in step 9.2.\nCulture cells under standard conditions, as described in section 1 (NOTE) and 9.2.18,28 Check the culture for cellular outgrowth arising from the tissue pieces, which should be observed within a few days. Once cells reach confluence, trypsinize and propagate them according to standard cell culture techniques.\n\tNOTE: The primary cell culture can be subsequently used to evaluate growth and metastatic properties of the cells derived from control and hypoxic tumors, as well as their molecular features, as previously described.18\nSubscription Required.
