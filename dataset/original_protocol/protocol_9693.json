    "1. Required material and preparations for microfluidics\nFor the described microfluidic procedure, use 1 mL and 5 mL glass syringes and syringe pumps. On-chip droplet formation is observed via an inverted microscope equipped with a high-speed camera.\nCreate the microfluidic chip design (Figure 1B) using a computer-aided design software and produce a master template as already reported12.\nAchieve controlled UV-irradiation using a self-constructed UV-LED (λ = 365 nm, spot diameter ~4.7 mm) providing irradiance at 957 mW/cm2 through a 0.13 mm thick cover glass.\n\tNOTE: Take into account possible local heat generation by the UV-LED during irradiation. If this is the case, ensure sufficient cooling by external airflow.\n2. Microfluidic device production\nNOTE: The microfluidic device production is based on a previous publication13.\nPrepare 20 g of a 10:1 (by mass) mixture of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and curing agent. Mix vigorously for 3 min.\nMix 60 mg of Oil Red O in 2.0 g of toluene. Add 50 µL of Oil Red O in toluene solution to the PDMS mixture. Mix until there is homogeneous color distribution to decrease undesired light scattering and keep the spot size focused during on-chip gelation.\nRemove the bubbles by placing the mixture into a desiccator equipped with a vacuum pump.\nCast the PDMS mixture into the master template to a height of 5-5.5 mm and degas again.\nAllow the PDMS to cure for 18 h at room temperature to avoid diazo dye degradation.\nCut out the PDMS structure and punch inlet and outlet holes into the structure using a line core sampling tool (0.77 mm inner diameter, 1.07 mm outer diameter).\nWash the PDMS and cover glass with isopropanol and deionized water repeatedly 5x and, subsequently, remove the liquid via pressured air or nitrogen flow after each washing step.",
    "Treat the dry glass and PDMS together in a plasma oven at 0.2 mbar, with an oxygen flow of 20 mL/min for 60 s at 100 W, and connect directly to bind the glass and PDMS together to form the microfluidic device.\n\tNOTE: Avoid bending the PDMS structure during the binding process to minimize channel structure deformation.\nTo render the channels of the microfluidic chip hydrophobic, place the device together with 50 µL of trichloro-(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoroctyl)-silane in a desiccator under vacuum overnight (close the connection to the pump after decreasing the vapor pressure). Rinse the outside of the device with hydrofluoroether.\n\tCAUTION: Perform these steps in a fume hood and avoid any contact with the perfluoro silane. Use a glass vacuum desiccator sealed with grease. Clean the desiccator thoroughly before using for other purposes.\n3. Solution preparation for microfluidics\nFor the continuous oil phase, mix paraffin oil and hexadecane (1:1 v/v) and add 8% (w/w) of a non-ionic surfactant. Fill one 1 mL (first oil, Figure 1) and one 5 mL (second oil, Figure 1) glass syringe.\nPrepare the prepolymer solutions for the disperse phase in brown glass vials to prevent photoinitiator decomposition and unintended gelation.\n\t\nAmine component prepolymer solution containing GRGDS-PC\n\t\t\nFor a 300 µL solution, weigh out 33.3 mg of star-polyethylene glycol-acrylate (sPEG-AC) and 3.03 mg of lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP).\nDissolve 18.74 mg of 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AMA) in 1.5 mL of deionized water and pass the solution through a syringe filter (0.20 µm pore size).\n\t\t\tNOTE: AMA is hygroscopic and should be discarded as soon as the solid forms lumps in the storage container.\nPrepare sterile 36 mM GRGDS-PC aliquots in water and keep at −20 °C until use.",
    "Use 291.7 µL of the AMA solution to dissolve sPEG-AC and LAP, and add 8.3 µL of the GRGDS-PC solution. Take up the solution with a 1 mL glass syringe and protect from light using aluminum foil.\nEpoxy component prepolymer solution\n\t\t\nFor a 300 µL solution, weigh 33.3 mg of star-polyethylene glycol-acrylate (sPEG-AC), 3.03 mg of LAP and dissolve in 300 µL of deionized water. Add 2.4 mg of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Vigorous shaking accelerates GMA dissolving. Take up the solution with a 1 mL glass syringe and protect from light using aluminum foil.\n4.

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64010/64010fig01largev2.jpg]\nInsert the needles into the PE tubes and remove the gas from the syringe and the tube.\nInsert a PE tube into the outlet for product collection.\nPlace all the glass syringes in the syringe pumps and insert each tubing end into the corresponding inlet (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Protect the prepolymer tubing from light via aluminum foil or a black tube to avoid unintentional gelation.\nFocus the microscope on the oil-water cross-section.",
    "Start the first oil syringe pump (flow rate = 100-200 µL/h) to fill the channel with oil first to prevent channel wetting by the disperse phase.\nDecrease the first oil flow rate to 30 µL/h and start the prepolymer syringe pump (flow rate = 100-200 µL/h) until the dispersed aqueous phase can be observed at the cross-section.\nSet the prepolymer flow rate to 30 µL/h and focus the microscope on the outlet.\nStart the second oil syringe pump (flow rate of 300 µL/h) and wait until the flow regime is stable.\nPlace the outlet tube in a collection container.\n\tNOTE: Place the end of the tube in the upper part of the container to avoid a pressure increase due to the accumulation of the product over time.\nSet the UV irradiation system such that the irradiance is in the range of 900-1000 mW/cm2 (used irradiance = 957 mW/cm2) and the irradiation spot is in the straight channel part before the outlet (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Make sure to not irradiate near the oil-water cross-section to avoid clogging the channel. For additional protection, cover the channel structures prior to the irradiation spot on the top of the unit.\nBefore UV irradiation, adjust the flow rates of the prepolymer and the first oil to achieve the desired aspect ratio in the range of 3.0 to 4.5, and set the irradiation time of the dispersed phase to ~2.3 s, depending on the size of the irradiation spot.\nStart UV irradiation and, if necessary, adjust the flow rates again according to the previous subsection.\n\tNOTE: Observe the production at the beginning and monitor for stable flow behavior in the outlet and the uniformity of the microgel rods. The second oil flow can be adjusted to optimize product transport within the outlet.",
    "Change the collection container and note the product collection start time and flow rates.\n\tNOTE: Protect the product from dust. Stop collecting before any syringe runs low on solution.\nTo end collection, remove the collection container, noting the time. Stop irradiation and all the syringe pumps.\nWash the product subsequently 5x each with n-hexane, isopropanol, and deionized water. Remove the supernatant after rod sedimentation.\n\tNOTE: After each solution addition, disperse the product carefully and wait 10 min before replacing the solvent, considering molecular diffusion. Replace the isopropanol gradually with water to prevent the rods from floating to the surface of the liquid. Multiple additional washing steps with water decrease the remaining isopropanol traces.\n5. Macroporous scaffold formation\nDetermine the number of microgel rods per dispersion volume for the epoxy and amine functionalized samples.\nAdjust the number of epoxy and amine functionalized samples by dilution or concentration to a similar value between 1,000-5,000 rods/100 µL.\n\tNOTE: Use a centrifuge at ~2,000 x g for 5-10 s to speed up the sedimentation of the microgel rods. If the number of rods per dispersion volume is low, rod-interlinking may result in smaller rod clusters instead of one stable construct. If the number of rods per dispersion volume is high, the mixing quality of the two components will be compromised.\nTransfer the first component (~1,200 rods) dispersion into a conical 1.5 mL or 2 mL transparent vial.\nAdd the second component in a controlled manner in a continuous operation (100 µL pipette). After addition, mix the contents directly using the pipette to take up liquid and add it again. The interlinked structure forms within seconds during mixing.\n\tNOTE: If multiple clusters form instead of one coherent structure, recheck the number of microgel rods per volume or provide more controlled mixing of the two components.",
    "6. Cell adhesive post-modification\nCalculate the theoretical number of epoxy groups in the interlinked structure based on the flow rate of the dispersed polymer phase, the number of microgels collected during a specific time, and the dilution factor of the microgel dispersion used for scaffold formation.\n\tNOTE: Approximate the theoretical number of epoxy groups per scaffold by the following equation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64010/64010eq01v3.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64010/64010eq02v2.jpg\n\tnth: Theoretical amount of substance\n\tcGMA: GMA concentration in prepolymer solution\n\tQ: Flow rate of prepolymer solution\nAdd GRGDS-PC solution to the interlinked structure to modify all remaining epoxy groups with the cell adhesive peptide bearing a free amine and thiol (n[theoretical epoxy groups]/n[GRGDS-PC] = 1). Leave at room temperature overnight.\nRemove the unreacted molecules by washing with deionized water and removing the supernatant.\n7. Sterilization and transfer into cell culture media\nReduce the water level to just submerge the interlinked scaffold.\nOpen the vial and irradiate with UV light of λ = 250-300 nm. Close the vial and transfer the vial onto a clean bench. Wash 1x with sterile water.\nReplace the water in the vial with cell culture media and allow for equilibration for 5 min. Repeat this with fresh cell culture media 2x.\nTransfer the macroporous scaffold into a cell culture well plate for the experiment by pouring or using a spatula.\n  Subscription Required.
