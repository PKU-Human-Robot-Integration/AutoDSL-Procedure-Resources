    "Isolation of nuclei by bead-beating (3-4 h)Place a single 3 mm stainless steal bead into each cluster tube (Figure 1A). Place cluster tubes into 96-wellrack (Figure 1B). Label the tubes and mark positions of samples (as schematic drawing in the lab book).  Fix the silique on a sticky tape and slit it open with a dissection or hypodermic needle (Figure 1C-D). Add a single mature but still green seed (Figure 1C-D) into each cluster tube. In Boechera spp. endosperm degrades upon seed maturation. If a fully mature seed of the species under investigation contains endosperm, the mature seed can be used. This can be checked by microscopic analyses of cleared seeds at various stages. The method of clearing depends on the species and should be chosen and adapted based on published protocols.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604191652_1798.jpgFigure 1. A. A single 3 mm stainless steel bead in a cluster tube. B. Cluster tubes containing single beads in the appropriate 96-well rack. C. Optimal seed stage for Boechera spp. seeds. The top silique has seeds that are too young to be used (too few cells), and the bottom silique has seeds at an optimal stage. D. The top silique has seeds that are too old (they start to turn brown, coinciding with degradation of the endosperm). The lower silique has seeds at an optimal stage. E. Close-up of C. F. Close-up of D. Lines indicate that part of the picture was removed in the close-up.Add 80 μl of Otto 1 (0.01%) to each tube. Close the tubes using the storage plate cap strips.Crush the seeds by shaking the samples for 3 min at 30 Hz using the mixer mill. Turn plates 180° and repeat step A6. The distal part of the arm of the mixer mill has a larger amplitude than the proximal part.",
    "Turning the plates compensates for the different amplitudes of the mixer mill. Control whether the seeds are crushed by visual inspection. Seeds are crushed if the solution turned milky (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604000531_4582.jpgFigure 2. Crushed and non-crushed seeds. The green arrows indicate successfully crushed seeds and a milky solution. The white arrow points to a non-crushed seed. The red arrow shows a tube without a seed. If the solution is clear and the seed is visible in the cluster tube, it was not crushed and cannot be measured.If not all seeds are crushed repeat steps A7-9 until all seeds are crushed. Shake down the solution to remove drops from the lid, either by gently knocking the plate flat against the table, or by a quick spin (5 sec) in the centrifuge.Add 80 μl of Otto 1 (1%) to each tube. Be careful to not touch the tube or the foam with the tip to not cross-contaminate the samples. Close the tubes and mix by inverting 40x manually and avoid generating foam by fast movements. Now the volume is 160 μl and the concentrations are 0.1 M citric acid and 0.5% Triton X-100.Place a filter plate onto a clean 96-well V-bottom plate (Figure 3A).Label the plates.Transfer the solution with the extracted nuclei into the fritted deep well plates, either by using a multichannel pipette or by pouring. Be careful to keep the order of the samples.Centrifuge 5 min at 150 x g at room temperature (20 °C) to pellet the nuclei.Carefully remove the plates from the centrifuge. The pelleted nuclei are very loose.Remove the fritted deep well plates. If they are thoroughly washed with tap water and rinsed with deionized water, they can be reused.Remove the supernatant with a pipette tip placed at the edge of the V (Figure 3B).",
    "Do not pipette fast; otherwise nuclei will be sucked up. The pellet should be of white to light brown appearance. Add 30 μl of Otto 1 (0.5%) to resuspend the nuclei. Adding the buffer by fast pipetting is sufficient to resuspend the nuclei.Samples can now be stored for up to 72 h at 4 °C until used.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604000551_0207.jpgFigure 3. A. A fritted deep well plate on a 96-well V-bottom plate. B. Cartoon representing the placement of the tip to remove the supernatant.Measuring DNA-content (ploidy) (ca. 7-8 min per sample, depending on the concentration of the nuclei)Start the flow cytometer and the UV lamp. Please refer to the user manual of the flow cytometer or get an introduction from the person in charge.While the UV lamp heats up (30 min), place the samples at room temperature to equilibrate (see Notes).Load or change the detection settings so that the diploid peak is at channel 200 (relative fluorescent units) on a linear scale (see Notes).Add 160 μl of Otto 2 solution either manually or by using the flow cytometer’s robotics.Measure the sample and record the data. Stop collecting data either after a total count of 6,000 (this takes about 7-8 min) or after a certain time period (e.g. 5 min).Treat all additional samples accordingly.Manually annotate the peaks (see Figures 4-6). Discard the samples in which the endosperm does not give a clear peak! It is essential to see the peak of the endosperm (see Notes).Save your data in a table that provides at minimum the sample name, mean, median and coefficient of variance.Analyzing the dataCompute the ratio of endosperm to embryo.If the ploidy of the mother plant is available, compute the ratio of embryo to mother plant."
