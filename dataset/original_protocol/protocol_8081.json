    "All experimental procedures were conducted in agreement with the German Animal Welfare Legislation after approval by the Landesdirektion Sachsen (licenses TVV 2/2015 and TVV 21/2017).\n1. Preparation for in utero electroporation\nPrepare the DNA mixture. In this protocol a final concentration of 1 µg/µL of pGFP is used. Dissolve DNA in PBS and supplement with 0.1% Fast Green to facilitate visualization. Once prepared, mix the DNA mixture by pipetting up and down several times or by finger tapping. Store at room temperature until use.\n\tNOTE: For coelectroporations, the DNA mixture is prepared to contain a final concentration of 1 µg/µL of plasmid encoding a gene of interest along with 0.5 µg/µL of pGFP diluted in PBS.\nPrepare the surgery table with all the required tools and instruments.\nPull glass capillaries using the micropipette puller. Adjust the diameter of the capillary tip by cutting off the distal part of the capillary using forceps as previously described41.\n2. Preparation of ferrets for surgery\nKeep the pregnant jills with embryos at E33 fasting for at least 3 h before the surgery to reduce the risk of vomiting.\nPrior to the surgery sterilize all the tools by autoclaving. Perform the surgery in a specially assigned room in aseptic conditions to eliminate potential sources of contamination.\nPlace the pregnant jill in the narcosis box with 4% isoflurane.\nWhen anesthetized, place the ferret on the operation table with a heat pad and attach the narcosis mask with a constant 2–3% isoflurane flow to the nose. To ensure the appropriate level of anesthesia, check for the lack of the following reflexes:\n\t\nThe palpebral reflex by touching the periocular skin\nThe flexor reflex by pinching the skin between the 2nd and 3rd, or 3rd and 4th toe of both hind limbs",
    "If the palpebral reflex is absent and flexor reflex is clearly reduced, check for the pain reflex by pinching one toe of each hind limb.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure to have a stethoscope at hand to monitor heart rate and rhythm if required.\nInject the ferret subcutaneously with analgesic (0.1 mL of metamizol, 50 mg/kg of body weight), antibiotic (0.1 mL/kg of body weight of 20 mg/kg of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid), and glucose (10 mL of 5% glucose solution).\nPlace a drop of eye ointment solution on the eyes to prevent eye dehydration during the surgical procedure.\nShave the ferret belly using a shaver.\nClean the skin with water and soap, disinfect the belly with 70% ethanol scrub, disinfect 2x with iodine, and let it dry.\n3. In utero electroporation of ferrets\nEnsure that the surgical area is sterile: place sterile surgical tools on sterile tissues, and change coat and gloves.\nPlace a sterile surgical drape on the animal.\nUsing a scalpel, surgically open the belly at the linea alba with a ~5 cm long cut.\nCut the muscle layer using scissors.\nPlace gauze swabs around the incision site and wet them with PBS. The gauze swabs will absorb the additional PBS that will be added during the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Maintain heat and PBS support throughout the surgery.\nExpose the ferret uterus and place it on the gauze swabs.\nLoad a glass capillary with the injection solution using a pipette with a long loading tip. Ensure that the loading volume is approximately between 5–20 µL depending on the number of embryos and number of different experimental conditions. The average injected volume per embryo is 3–5 µL. Attach the loaded glass capillary to a holder and connect the other side of the holder to a tube and a mouthpiece.",
    "Inspect the first embryo and find the head.\nPlace the fiber optic light source next to the embryo's head to facilitate visualization.\n\tNOTE: Ferret uterine walls are very dark, and it is difficult to see through them unless light is shined directly on them.\nPerform a single intraventricular injection into the ventricle of one of the cerebral hemispheres and keep the other hemisphere intact to serve as an internal control. The ventricle itself is not easily distinct by eye, so its location is estimated based on the location of the pigmented iris, which is visible. The intraventricular injection is done by taking the holder attached to the glass capillary and penetrating the skin, skull, and cerebral tissue with the tip of the glass capillary.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to not damage the placenta, which is darker than murine placentas.\n\t\nWhen the tip of the glass capillary is in the ventricle, inject approximately 3–5 µL of the injection solution by mouth-pipetting using the mouthpiece connected to the glass capillary holder. Because the injected solution contains 0.1% Fast Green, the injected ventricle will now turn dark green, and will be visible as a kidney-shaped structure.\nPlace the tweezer electrodes on the uterus above the embryo's head so that the positive pole is placed above the area that will be targeted and the negative pole below the injected area.\nSet the following electroporation conditions on the electroporator: Pulse length = 50 ms; Pulse voltage = 100 V; Pulse interval = 1 s; Number of pulses = 5. Then, press the \"Pulse\" button on the electroporator.\nQuickly drop several drops of warm 1x PBS on the electroporated embryo.\nRepeat the procedure for all the embryos. Keep the uterus constantly wet with warm PBS.",
    "NOTE: If the first embryos facing the vagina are not easily accessible, it is best to not electroporate them.\nWhen all the embryos are electroporated, place the uterus back into the peritoneal cavity.\nSuture the muscle layer with the peritoneum using a 4-0 suture.\nSuture the skin using the same thickness and spray the wound with aluminum spray.\nPlace the animal in a cage and keep it warm with a heat source. Carefully monitor the animal until it wakes up.\n4. Postoperative care and housing of targeted animals\nFor 3 days after the surgery ensure that the animals are undergoing the following postoperative care: 20 mg/kg amoxicillin (antibiotic) 1x daily; 25 mg/kg metamizol (analgesic) 3x daily.\nEnsure that the ferrets are housed individually.\nEnsure that the ferrets are examined by a veterinary at least 1x per day.\nEnsure that the ferrets are disturbed as little as possible during delivery.\nAfter the pups are weaned or sacrificed, prepare the jills for hysterectomy.\n5. Hysterectomy of ferrets\nNOTE: A hysterectomy is performed to reduce the number of sacrificed animals so that the sterilized animals can be donated for adoption as pets. The presurgical procedure for hysterectomy is the same as in step 2.\nShave and sterilize the ferret belly as described in steps 3.1 and 3.2.\nSurgically open the belly at the linea alba. Cut the muscle layer. Lift the muscle layer and shelter the gut with a finger while fully opening the muscle layer.\nPlace gauze swabs around the incision site and wet them with sterile PBS. Expose the ferret uterus and the ovaries and place them on the gauze swabs.",
    "Start the hysterectomy on one side by ligating the arteria ovarica and vena ovarica cranial to the mesovar. Put a clamp on each side of the ligation and perform another ligation cranial to the clamps. Attach the third clamp at the ends of the ligation to save them. Repeat on the other side.\nCut between the clamps and detach the cornua uteri from the mesentery on both sides.\nLigate the arteria uterina on both uterine sides caudal to the ostium uteri. Then ligate the vagina and fix the ligature. Attach the clamp at the ends of the ligations to save them. Put two clamps cranial to the ligature. Cut between the clamps and detach the uterus from vagina. Remove the uterus and ovaries and dispose of them. Scrape the residual mucous membrane from the uterus butt.\nDetach all the remaining clamps and shorten the ligature ends. Make sure to control for bleeding after the clamps have been removed.\nSuture the muscle layer and the skin as described in steps 3.16 and 3.17. Follow the postoperative protocol as in steps 3.18 and 4.1–4.3. Keep the animals in the animal facility for at least 2 weeks with regular veterinary visits. After the animals are fully recovered, they can be donated for adoption.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
