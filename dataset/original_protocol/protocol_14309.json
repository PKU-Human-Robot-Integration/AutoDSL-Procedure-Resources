    "1. Animals:\nAll animals were treated according to the guidelines of the Swiss national laws. The study was approved by the local animal experimentation committee of the Canton of Bern (permission no. BE 25/16).\nUse large white pigs of both sexes (~30 ± 5 kg). Divide the animals blindly into two groups, one group receiving a bicyclic (80 kDa protease) inhibitor of FXIIa or treatment of choice and the other an inactive control.\n2. Surgical procedure (Figure 1)\nAnesthesia and preparation of the animal:\nFast the animals for 12 h before starting the experiment.\nPre-medicate the animal with 20 mg/kg Ketamine and 2 mg/kg Xylazine via an intramuscular injection into the neck, using a 10 mL syringe. Record the animal weight and sex.\nInduce anesthesia by injecting 0.5 mg/kg Midazolam and 0.05 mg/kg Atropin into the auricular vein. Intubate the animal with an endotracheal tube.\nMaintain the anesthesia by mechanical ventilation using a respirator (O2/air 1:3, Sevorane 1.5%), a 7 - 8 mm airway tube and a filter. Adjust the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to 35% and the tidal volume to 6-10 mL/kg.\nDepth of anesthesia is assessed as adequate in absence of either motor or autonomic responses to nose pinching. Palpebral reflexes and jaw tone were monitored continuously as well targeting relaxed jaw tone and absence of palpebral reflexes. Core temperature was continuously monitored and maintenance of normothermia (38-38.5 °C) was ensured with passive warming (isolating blankets and warm bottles).\nDissect free, as previously described by Koudstaal and his colleagues steps 3-1 to 3-318, the carotid arteries on both sides and cannulate them with a 7F sheath. Cannulate the left jugular vein with a 7F sheath for venous blood sampling.",
    "Administer a bolus dose of 250 µg Fentanyl analgesic through the central venous line followed by 250 µg/h as a continuous intravenous infusion using an infusion pump. Monitor body temperature, heart rate and rhythm with a 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial and central venous pressure during the whole experiment. \nUsing standard blood collection tubes, withdraw the following baseline blood samples from the venous line: 5 mL citrated plasma and 2.9 mL EDTA plasma into the respective tubes. Centrifuge immediately at 2,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Take 2.9 mL blood into a serum tube and allow to coagulate for 30 min at room temperature before centrifuging as described above.\nAliquot 200 µL of plasma or serum into 500 µL tubes and store all samples at -80 °C for further analysis.\nWithdraw 0.5 mL of blood from the arterial line using the special blood gas analysis (BGA) syringes to measure BGA using the BGA machine according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nWithdraw 0.5 mL of blood from the venous line using a standard 2 mL syringe and immediately transfer it into the ACT cartridge using a 30 G needle. Insert the filled cartridge into the ACT machine to measure clotting time according to the manufacturer's instructions. See Figure 2 for time points.\nAdminister 5000 IU unfractionated heparin into the venous line using a 2 mL syringe and allow the animal to stabilize for 20 min before starting the MI experiment.\nMonitor ACT every 30-45 min as mentioned in 2.1.11. Inject 2500 IU unfractionated heparin intravenously if ACT is < 180 s.\nMyocardial infarction experiment\nUse a standard C arm fluoroscopy equipment (coronary angiography program, angle 0°, 12 frames per second, ~70 kV) - or alternatively a dedicated angiography system - to perform the coronary intervention.",
    "Use fluoroscopic guidance to insert a pressure catheter (5F, 120 cm) via the previously placed sheath in the left carotid artery. Advance it into the left ventricle. Connect the pressure catheter to an acquisition system to record left ventricular pressure. The acquisition system needs to continuously calculate and record heart rate, developed pressure, dP/dt maximum (contractility of left ventricle) and dP/dt minimum (relaxation of left ventricle) during the entire experiment. Record baseline values for 10 min.\nInsert a 6F (100 cm, EB3.75) guiding catheter via the previously placed sheath into the right carotid artery. Advance it to the left coronary artery to reach the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) under X-ray guidance. Inject contrast medium using a 20 mL syringe via the guiding catheter to perform a baseline coronary angiography.\n\t\tNOTE: Injection of contrast medium was done by manual pressure but a dedicated power injector system could be used as well.\nAssess the size of the LAD on the X-ray monitor to select the appropriate size of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) catheter. Use PCI balloons with a length of 15-25 mm and diameters between 2 and 3.5 mm depending on the LAD size. Assemble PCI catheter and coronary guidewire (F 014/J, 175 cm). Connect the PCI catheter with the inflation device pre-filled with contrast medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The LAD diameter can be measured directly on a calibrated monitor using a ruler and the size of the PCI balloon is then selected accordingly.\nInsert the assembled system from 2.2.4 into the lumen of the guiding catheter. Advance the guidewire into the LAD until it reaches beyond the second diagonal branch of the LAD.",
    "Use fluoroscopic guidance to advance the PCI catheter until it reaches about the middle of the LAD. Choose the LAD blocking site depending on the anatomy of the coronaries, usually after the second, sometimes after the first diagonal branch (Figure 3) in order to have similar percentages of the AAR of the left ventricle (LV).\n\t\tNOTE: The choice of the blocking site depends on the length of the diagonal branches and thus the area of tissue which is supplied by blood via the respective branch. In case of a long, bifurcated first diagonal branch the blocking site will be just after this. In case of a shorter first diagonal branch, the blocking is done after the second diagonal.\nRemove the guidewire and then increase the pressure in the inflation device to 7-10 bar to inflate the balloon of the PCI catheter and induce myocardial ischemia for 1 h. Gradually increase the FiO2 to 50-60% between 15 and 40 min of ischemia. Keep tidal volume at 6-10 mL/kg.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure will reduce the occurrence of extrasystoles and decrease the frequency of ventricular fibrillations.\nRecord a 5-10 s video sequence while injecting contrast medium through the guiding catheter to have an angiogram of the balloon of the PCI catheter in place just after starting ischemia; repeat after 10 min of ischemia to verify complete occlusion of the LAD distal to the balloon of the PCI catheter.",
    "Monitor the animal closely to immediately detect and treat (2.2.10) cardiac arrhythmias. Extrasystoles usually occur and increase in frequency (>3 per min) between 20 and 40 min after induction of myocardial ischemia. If this occurs, gently massage the neck on both sides just below the cheek. In most cases this will be sufficient to re-establish a regular heartbeat, probably by stimulation of the vagal nerve baroreceptors located on the common carotid artery.\nIf cardiac arrhythmias progress into ventricular fibrillation, use an external, biphasic defibrillator to re-establish a sinus rhythm. Apply 5-10 chest compressions using the defibrillator pads immediately before applying the shock in order to fill the coronaries with oxygenated blood and then shock with 150 J (for 30 kg animals).\nRepeat if necessary and increase the energy to 175 J after the 3rd shock. Use higher energy settings for heavier animals.\nFive min before the end of the ischemia time repeat the blood sampling mentioned in 2.1.8-2.1.13. Inject the test substance (either the bicyclic FXIIa inhibitor or control 4 mg/kg, do this this blindly) intravenously through the central venous line and flush the line with 20 mL saline.\nWithdraw one plasma citrate sample (as mentioned in 2.1.8 and 2.1.9) 4 min after injecting the substance in 2.2.12.\nPerform an angiogram (2.2.3) to confirm LAD occlusion, then deflate the balloon of the PCI catheter and remove this catheter from the guiding catheter. Confirm perfusion of the LAD distal to the occlusion site by angiogram immediately after deflation and removal of the balloon of the PCI catheter, 10 min thereafter, whenever signs of myocardial ischemia were visible by ECG for more than 5 min, and immediately before re-occlusion of the LAD.",
    "Allow reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium for 2 h. Take plasma and serum samples at 10, 30, 60 and 115 min of reperfusion (2.1.8 and 2.1.9). Monitor BGA at 60 and 115 min (2.1.10).\nReinsert the PCI catheter together with the guidewire to exactly the same position as used for the ischemia. Inflate the balloon of the PCI catheter as before and confirm LAD occlusion by angiogram (2.2.3). Remove the pressure catheter from the left ventricle and stop recording.\nInject 100 mL 2% Evans Blue in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) into the central venous line. About 30 s later, when the whole animal turns blue, inject 40 mL 20% KCl to euthanize the animal. Death was confirmed by the absence of ECG signals and pulse waves.\n3. Sampling techniques\nExtracting, dissecting and sampling the heart (figure 4)\nPerform a sternotomy to expose the heart. Follow the protocol previously described by Koudstaal and colleagues, steps 8-2 and 8-318. Cut open the pericardium while inspecting for abnormalities, which might stem from earlier pericarditis, and exclude the animal from further evaluation.\nDeflate and remove the PCI as well as the guiding catheter. Excise the heart for further analysis. Cut the vena cava and remove blood using a suction pump, then cut all the large vessels connecting the heart with the body.\nRinse the heart inside and out with room temperature saline. Weigh the whole heart.\nWithin 30-40 min, cut the heart into slices of about 3-5 mm from the apex to the Chordae tendinae of the mitral valve, perpendicular to the long axis using a sharp knife.\nBe careful to always place the heart in the same orientation with the ventral side facing up in order to keep the orientation of the cut samples (Figure 5).",
    "Photograph the slices of the heart using a digital single lens reflex camera.\nCut away the right ventricle (discard as not needed). Photograph the left ventricle slices and weigh all the slices for the total weight of the left ventricle.\nDifferentiate between the Evans Blue positive and Evans Blue negative tissue in all the sections. Dissect the slices to separate the ischemic (Evans Blue negative) from the non-ischemic tissue (Evans Blue positive) using a scalpel.\nFirst analyze the Evans Blue negative sections (the ischemic area at risk, AAR). Weigh them all and put them all into a plastic container.\nCover the slices entirely with 100-150 mL (according to the heart size) triphenyl tetrazolium chloride solution (2 g TTC, 16 g Dextran, molecular weight 48000-90000, in 200 mL PBS, freshly prepared) so that the heart pieces can move freely inside the solution. Cover the container and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C while gently shaking.\nDuring this 20 min incubation time weigh the Evans Blue positive pieces (area not at risk, ANR), take samples for Tissue-Tek embedding (choose the most distal part from the injury) and store at -80 °C for further analysis. Transfer the rest into 4% formaldehyde solution and store at room temperature for histology sections.\nRemove the pieces of the AAR from the TTC solution. The red stained tissue is viable ischemic tissue (VIT) and the non-stained tissue is necrotic ischemic tissue (NIT). Cut 2 small pieces (blocks of 2-3 mm) from both the NIT and VIT, embed them into Tissue -Tek and store at -80 °C for further analysis. These samples should have the same weight.",
    "Fix the rest of the pieces (all slices derived from the AAR) by pinning them down in a Styrofoam container and covering completely with 4% formaldehyde solution for 24 h at room temperature in a fume hood. The pieces should stay flat for the photographic documentation in the next step.\nThe next day photograph both sides of the pieces with a high-resolution camera with the same zoom setting and distance from the tissue (same magnification). Add automatic scale bars to all pictures. All bars need to have the same length.\n\t\tNOTE: The high-resolution camera should be connected to software that automatically adds the scale bar to each photo.\nCalculation of the AAR and the infarct size\n%AAR of left ventricle = (weight of AAR in g/ weight of left ventricle in g)* 100.\nUse ImageJ software to calculate the total surface area of both the AAR and NIT (both sides of each piece) based on the photographs.\nAdjust the scale bar by selecting the scale bar length using the straight line from the angle tool. Choose from the menu Analyze > Set Scale and insert the known distance and unit of the scale bar. Choose \"global\" so the same scale will be applied to all pictures.\nMark the whole surface area of the tissue using the free hand selection tool to calculate AAR. Be careful not to include the side (height) of the tissue and/or the fatty tissue (figure 6-C).\nSet the measurement by choosing \"area\" and \"display label\" from Analyze > Set Measurements menu. Measure the surface area from Analyze > Measure.\nRepeat step 3.2.5 to measure NIT (mark only the non-stained tissue). Note: Don't include the fatty tissue (figure 6-D) in the NIT calculation. Repeat the step on the other side of the tissue.",
    "Calculate the average AAR and NIT for each piece of tissue.\nUse the values obtained from 3.2.7 to calculate the NIT as a percentage of the AAR:%NIT of AAR = (Σ average surface area of NIT in cm2/ Σ average surface area of AAR in cm2)* 100.\nTwo different investigators should repeat the above method. The acceptable margin of difference is < 10%.\nIschemia markers\nUse the EDTA plasma samples, which have been previously stored at -80 °C (2.1.9) to measure the level of cardiac troponin-I using a single-plex Luminex-type assay as previously described 19.\nSubscription Required.
