  "title": "Thirty-Second Net Stressor Task in Adult Zebrafish",
  "procedures": [
    "Adult zebrafish were individually isolated in 2.8 L housing tanks and placed on a stand alone rack system with filtration.   Zebrafish were allowed to habituate to being in isolation for 7 days prior to the stressor (Tran et al., 2014).   On the day of the stressor, the housing tank was moved to the testing room and zebrafish were allowed to acclimatize to the new environment for 1 h.   Zebrafish were netted out of the tank using a fish net and suspended above the tank and fully exposed in air for 30 sec, with the lid covering the net.   Following the 30 sec net stressor, zebrafish were placed back in their housing tanks.    Zebrafish behavioral responses can be recorded and/or tissue samples can be collected after 15 min post-stressor,."
