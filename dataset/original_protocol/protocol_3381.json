Setup for human lung tissue processing and cryopreservation: Representative pictures for lung tissue processing\n(Step 1) The left lung, including a partial portion of the trachea, is used for the processing. The tissue is oriented with the distal (alveolar) portion on the left and the proximal (bronchial) portion on the right. (Step 2) Cut the tissue into five sections from the apex (upper part) to the lower part. (Step 3–4) Cut each section into smaller pieces. Track the pieces from different areas of the lung as follows: for example, those from the alveolar region are named LA, and those from the bronchial region are named LB. From each region, either snap-freeze small pieces in OCT for histology or subject them to cryopreservation (10% FBS and DMSO).\nTransfer the lung tissue to a sterile beaker (1000 mL) containing media for tissue preservation 1× PBS supplemented with 50% FBS.\nNote: Add approximately 400–500 mL to cover the tissue.\nSeal the beaker with sterile aluminum foil and parafilm.\nPause point: You can keep the lung tissue at 4°C under the conditions described above (a-b) for at least 8 h until tissue processing.\nTransfer the lung into a large sterile Pyrex container (24 cm × 36 cm × 6 cm).\nAnatomically orientate the lung tissue.",
    "Note: For example, for the left lung, place the lung facing the researcher in a way that the distal area (alveolar part) is on the left and the proximal part (bronchial part) is on the right close to the trachea (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Step 1).\nCut the lung tissue into slices (approximately 4–5 cm thick) with a sterile scalpel in function of anatomical orientation.\nNote: For example, start from the apex (upper part) to the bottom part of the lung, then from distal (more alveolar) to proximal (more bronchial), (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Step 2).\nCut each lung tissue slice into smaller pieces (approximately 3 cm × 3 cm in size), with a sterile scalpel (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Step 3).\nEmbed representative lung pieces from each region (approximately 3 cm × 3 cm in size) in OCT.\nSnap freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nNote: Name each OCT tissue block based on anatomical region and donor code: for example, LA for “alveolar” and LB for “bronchial” (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Step 4(a)).\nMince the remaining tissue into smaller pieces, of approximately 3 mm × 3 mm in size.\nPlace around 25 small pieces into each cryovial (2 mL cryovial size).\nImmediately add 1 mL of cold cryopreservation media (FBS 10% DMSO) to each cryovial.\nTransfer to an optimized freezing container.\nPause point: Store the cryovials at −80°C for at least 24 h before transferring them to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. Similarly, label each cryovial based on anatomical region, donor code, and date: (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Step 4(b)).\nCritical: Using this method, we process human lung tissue sections by anatomical region, allowing us to obtain organoids efficiently and fully differentiated ALI cultures from each area.\nHuman lung tissue viable freeze-thawing & lung airway organoid generation\nTiming: approximately 4 months",
    "This section describes the workflow to culture primary airway organoids, including the isolation, expansion, and cryostorage of lung organoid-derived progenitor cells, along with quality control screening of organoids for epithelial enrichment (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3147-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Viable frozen tissue processing and generation of primary airway lung organoids\n(A) Schematic experimental design for primary human lung organoid generation: viable frozen tissue is thawed and digested to obtain a single cell lung suspension containing airway cell progenitors. The cell lung suspension is resuspended in Cultrex, dispensed as a dome, and cultured in a medium containing factors allowing airway organoid expansion and lung epithelium enrichment. After each passage dissociated organoids are cryopreserved.\n(B) Representative photomicrographs of primary lung organoids at different passages were captured using a bright-field microscope. Images were generated using ImageJ. Scale bars 500 μm, in black on the left corner.\n(C) Representative immunofluorescent (IF) images of whole mounted lung organoids showing markers for epithelial cells (PAN-CK, green), extracellular matrix (Fibronectin, red), and nuclei (DAPI, blue). Pan-CK is present exclusively in epithelial cells and fibronectin allows visualization of the presence of the remaining extracellular matrix from tissue dissociation. The fibronectin disappears after four passages and characterizes the enrichment of lung epithelial cells. Scale bar 80 μm, in white in the left corner.

    "Thaw the cryopreserved tissue by placing 2–3 cryovials into a dry bath at 37°C for 5 min.\nImmediately, transfer the minced tissue into a 50 mL tube containing AdDF+ media (20–30 mL).\nNote: Pre-warm the media in a dry bath (37°C).\nCentrifuge at 300g for 5 min (20°C–25°C)\nNote: This step allows to remove the DMSO.\nResuspend the minced tissue with 10 mL of media for tissue digestion.\nNote: Pre-warm the media in a dry bath (37°C).\nIncubate on an orbital shaker at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 1 h. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nShear the digested tissue between sterile slides.\nStrain the digested tissue through a 100 μm filter.\nNote: To improve the straining, use the piston of an insulin syringe to press the tissue through the filter. For tissue remaining in the filter, repeat the shearing and filtration steps to remove as much connective tissue as possible to obtain a single cell suspension.\nStop the digestion process by adding 1× PBS supplemented with 2% FBS (20°C–25°C).\nCentrifuge at 300g for 5 min (20°C–25°C).\nResuspend the pellet in 1× PBS (approximately 5 mL, at 20°C–25°C).\nAlternatives: In case a visible red pellet is present, centrifuge for 5 min at 300g (20°C–25°C) and proceed to erythrocyte lysis using 2 mL red blood cell lysis buffer for 5 min at 20°C–25°C before the addition of 10 mL AdDF+ to stop the lysis.\nStrain the cells through a 100 μm filter using a new insulin syringe piston.\nCentrifuge at 300g for 5 min (20°C–25°C). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of AO media (pre-warmed, 37°C in a dry bath).\nAssess the cell viability.",
    "Note: Counting on a chamber Malassez. Dilute approximately, 10 μL of single cell suspension 5 times with 1× PBS. Then, mix one volume of the diluted cell suspension with one volume of trypan blue (0.4% in 1× PBS) to reveal blue dead cells. Apply approximately 10 μL of the cell mix to the counting chamber. Count the cells within 3–5 min of mixing with trypan blue, on the four corner squares plus the central big square of the chamber (5 big squares total). At this point, we expect to obtain 5 to 7.5 × 106 cells/mL with a viability of 80%–90%. To calculate the total cell concentration and then deduce cell viability, use the following formula:\nTotal\ncells\n/\nml\n=\n(\nnumber\nof\ncells\nx\nfactor\ndilution\nx\n10000\ncells\n/\nml\n)\n/\n5\nPrimary human lung organoid generation is performed based on Sachs et al.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and will be summarized in this protocol manuscript (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nResuspend the lung cell suspension at 7.5 × 106 cells/mL final in a mix of ice-cold AO media and liquid Cultrex growth factor reduced BME type 2.\nNote: Use the liquid Cultrex growth factor reduced BME type 2, at 1 mg/mL final of basement membrane extract protein concentration for optimal obtention of organoids. To keep the Cultrex growth factor reduced BME type 2 liquid, place the mix on ice until you are ready to proceed to cell culturing. For more details refer to the Cultrex growth factor reduced BME type 2 manufacturer (R&D, Bio-Techne[href=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhja5Rv9bqk]) methodology resource.\nMix the lung cell suspension.\nDispense approximately 300,000 cells/40 μL/well as a dome.\nNote: In this step pre-warm the CELLSTAR P24-well culture plate.\nGentle, flip the plate upside-down.",
    "Incubate the plate in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator at ambient O2 for 20 min to allow gellification. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nGentle, flip the plate right side up.\nAdd 400 μL of pre-warmed AO media (37°C in a dry bath).\nNote: AO media contains factors allowing the enrichment of lung epithelial cells.\nChange media every day.\nPassage organoids every 2 weeks as described below.\nRemove media and add ice-cold 1× PBS.\nIncubate the plate on ice for 30 min.\nNote: the incubation on ice allows to melt the gel without full disruption of the organoids.\nPipette (1 mL pipette) up/down to break the organoids.\nCombine the organoids of all the wells in a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 300g for 5 min (7°C).\nFor full organoid dissociation, add pre-warmed 1× TrypLE express.\nIncubate 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nMechanically, by pipetting up/down, dissociate the organoids.\nStop the reaction by adding ice-cold 1× PBS supplemented with 2% FBS.\nCentrifuge at 300g for 5 min (7°C).\nNote: During the process of organoids dissociation, monitor cell viability on chamber Malassez as described above in step (2. s), allowing also to verify that dissociation is complete. This leads to a distinct single cell suspension, free from intact organoids. If necessary, repeat the steps above from (vi) to (x).\nResuspend the cells in a mix of ice-cold AO media and liquid Cultrex growth factor reduced BME type 2.\nReplate 300 000 cells/40 μL as a dome.\nRepeat the steps above from (b) to (i).\nAfter each dissociation, count cells.\nCryopreserve at least 3–4 cryovials with 1.5 × 106 cells/mL/vial in FBS with 10% DMSO.",
    "Note: Having these backup stocks for later expansion is critical as bacterial or fungal contamination may occur during the expansion, which is a risk while working with primary tissues. Once the organoids are clear of the connective tissue, (after approximately 4–7 passages), generate a large frozen stock of dissociated organoids at 1.5 × 106 cells/cryovial. At this stage, there are usually 3–4, P24-well plates of organoids in culture from which you could expect to produce 20–25 cryovials.\nCritical: During the initial 1–4 passages, there is a substantial amount of connective tissue, which gradually decreases with each passage (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Perform a quality control check on domes containing spherical organoids free of connective tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Typically, after 4–7 passages, you can expect a high enrichment of lung epithelial progenitors. This outcome may vary depending on the donor.\nQuality control screening for epithelial enrichment in airway organoids by immunofluorescence (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nKeep 10–20 μL of the organoid suspension.\nNote: After removing the gel, keep a sample of organoids, (See above step 3.i.ii).\nCentrifuge at 300g for 5 min (4°C).\nNote: Keeping the centrifuge cold allows to remove the liquid Cultrex growth factor reduced BME type 2.\nGently, resuspend the intact organoids in 20 μL of cold 1× PBS.\nTransfer the organoid suspension on a Superfrost plus slide.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 10 min in a fume hood.\nFix and permeabilize organoids by applying 20 μL of −30°C acetone.\nIncubate approximately for 5 min in a fume hood until acetone evaporation.\nUse a hydrophobic pen (pap-pen) to create a hydrophobic barrier around the organoids.\nNote: The hydrophobic barrier will help to define the area of interest for staining.\nGently rinse the organoids with 1× PBS.\nTreat the organoids with Fc Receptor Block (one drop, 45 min, at 20°C–25°C).",
    "Wash three times with 1× PBS (5 min at 20°C–25°C each time).\nTreat the organoids with Background Buster treatment (one drop, 30 min, at 20°C–25°C).\nNote: One drop of each product is approximately 60 μL.\nRepeat the wash step above in (L).\nPrepare the mix of primary antibodies (unconjugated, approximately 100 μL per slide, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nNote: Dilute the antibodies anti-pan-Cytokeratin (pan-CK, to reveal enrichment of epithelial cells, 1.6 μg/mL final), anti-alpha-SMA (aSMA, to reveal presence of fibroblasts, 1 μg/mL final) and anti-Fibronectin (FN1, to reveal presence of connective tissue, 0.15 μg/mL final) in staining buffer 1× PBS/5% BSA/0.05% saponin.\nIncubate in the dark for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nRepeat the wash step above in (L).\nPrepare the mix of secondary antibodies (conjugated, against primary antibodies, approximately 100 μL per slide, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nNote: Dilute the antibodies anti-mouse IgG1 (specie of the anti-pan-CK antibody), anti-mouse IgG2a (specie of the anti-aSMA antibody) and anti-rabbit IgG (specie of the anti-Fibronectin antibody) in staining buffer 1× PBS/5% BSA/0.05% saponin.\nIncubate in the dark for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRepeat the wash step above in (L).\nCounterstain sections with 1 μg/mL final concentration (in 1× PBS, 5 min, at 20°C–25°C) of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI),\nRepeat the wash step above in (l).\nWhole mount organoids slide with Fluoromount-G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cover glass.\nImage acquisition using a confocal microscope.\nNote: For example, Leica SP8 for high-resolution images.\nImage analysis.\nNote: For example, using Imaris software (Bitplane).\nPrimary human lung organoid-derived air-liquid interface (ALI) generation, differentiation & viral exposure\nTiming: approximately 6 weeks\nThis part describes the workflow to culture primary human lung organoid-derived air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, along with TEER measurement to monitor the quality of tight junction formation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3147-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Generation of primary human lung organoid-derived ALI cultures to study response to virus\n(A) Schematic experimental design for primary human lung organoid-derived ALI culture generation: (1) cell expansion in submerged culture to obtain confluence at 100%; (2) initial differentiation in submerged cultures to foster tight junctions and barrier integrity, monitored by TEER values (>500 Ω cm2). (3) TEER goals are achieved, and cultures are transitioned to airlift by removal of apical media, which initiates final differentiation into pseudo-stratified epithelia. Cultures are monitored for a minimum of 4 weeks for the presence of beating cilia and mucus production.\n(B) Representative photomicrographs of primary lung organoids-derived ALI cultures at Step 1 (3–4 days after seeding), Step 2 (at confluence approximately 12–14 days after seeding) and Step 3 (at 34 days post-airlift) captured using a bright-field microscope. Images were generated using ImageJ. Scale bars 500 μm, in black on the left corner.\n(C) Measurement of trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER, Ω cm2) with error bars (mean ± SD), 3 measurements per time-point performed 3 times per week starting when the epithelium is confluent, one representative experiment per donor (four donors).

    "Prepare fresh complete medial for ALI expansion supplemented with Y-27632.\nThaw lung organoid-derived cell suspension by placing 1 cryovial (containing 1.5 × 106 cells/mL) into a dry bath at 37°C for 5 min.\nTransfer the cells into a conical 50 mL tube with fresh pre-warmed (37°C in a dry bath) ALI Expansion media (1 cryovial with 10 mL media).\nCentrifuge at 300g for 5 min (20°C–25°C).\nResuspend in ALI Expansion media (final concentration: 300,000 cells/mL).\nPlate the cells (30 000 cells/100 μL/well).\nNote: One cryovial can usually seed ∼48 inserts.\n(1) Expansion step:\nUse complete ALI expansion media supplemented with Y-27632 until reaching 100% confluence.\nChange the media every day after on the apical (100 μL) and on the basal side (500 μL).\nNote: ALI cultures reach 100% confluence in approximately 10–12 days, depending on the donor.\n(2) Differentiation step 1:\nUse complete ALI differentiation and maintenance media supplemented with Y-27632.\nChange the media every day after on the apical (100 μL) and on the basal side (500 μL).\nNote: During this step, ALI cultures establish tight junctions. Perform TEER measurements using the EVOM2 ohm meter during days 13–19 after every media change (3 times per week). Once TEER values rise values > 500 Ω cm2, this indicates a healthy confluent layer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\n(3) Differentiation step 2:\nAirlift ALI cultures by removal of media from the apical side.\nUse complete ALI differentiation and maintenance media without Y-27632.\nKeep maintaining media supply to the basal side, (500 μL/well).\nNote: At this stage, ALI cultures initiate the differentiation into a pseudo-stratified epithelium. Typically, after airlift, the TEER values drop to approximately 250–500 Ω cm2 depending on the donor.\nChange the media on the basal side, 3 times per week.",
    "Note: Check ALI cultures under a bright-field microscope for evidence of beating cilia (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) and mucus production. It takes approximately 4 weeks post-airlift until full differentiation.\nAlternatives: Assess mucus and cilia presence by immunofluorescence as outlined further in the step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] section related to “examples of readouts to assess response to viral exposure[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]”.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.

Usually, the apical wash viscosity indicates the presence of mucus.\nChange basal media.\nProceed to viral exposure by applying 105 PFU virus apically.\nNote: Approximately 25–100 μL at day 0 (D0). Usually, we do not remove the viral suspension.\nIncubate the mock inserts (non-infected controls) with an infection medium containing no virus with a similar volume to the infected conditions.\nPerform viral infection in a kinetic fashion.\nHarvest inserts every day from 1 to 6 post-infection for analysis.\nNote: As summarized in this protocol, multiple readouts can help assess the response to a virus.\nCritical: Note that during ALI generation, the TEER evaluation is critical. The cultures will collapse if you airlift ALI cultures without reaching the TEER peak. Additionally, using volumes larger than 100 μL for apical infection may result in tissue damage and collapse of the culture.\nExamples of readouts to assess response to viral exposure",
    "Timing: approximately 3 weeks\nThis part describes five methods to assess the response to SARS-CoV-2 virus: Plaque assays (Viral titers); Flow cytometry (virus detection on dissociated tissue); Immunofluorescence on non-dissociated tissue (quality controls steps during ALI culture generation, cell composition, virus detection, immune marker detection); RNA data (bulk RNA) and GeoMx analysis (probe-based), (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). After viral exposure, harvest ALIs daily from 1 to 6 days post-infection. Keep at least 1 insert for each readout at each time point.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3147-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Readouts to assess response to a virus, ALI culture OCT embedding, and OCT cutting\n(A) Schematic workflow presenting five methods to assess response to virus. Flow cytometry and RNA extraction require tissue dissociation versus Immunofluorescence, plaque assay (viral titer on apical supernatant) and GeoMx WTA do not require tissue dissociation.\n(B) Procedure of embedding ALIs in OCT and cryopreservation. First, turn the insert upside-down, and with a scalpel cut the mesh in the middle and partially around the edges, enough to hold the mesh and pull out from the insert. Be careful not to damage the cell layer. Place the ALI mesh on top of a layer of OCT and cover it with OCT to fully embed the ALI insert. Gently, with a pipette tip make sure the ALI is not curved or too close to the bottom or surface of the cryomold. Then, snap freeze in liquid nitrogen. To ensure no liquid nitrogen (LN) enters the tissue, the cryomold should be placed on top of a plastic lid resistant to LN.",
    "(C) ALI section cutting and transfer to Superfrost plus slides. Make a mark with a Sharpie pen to indicate the location of the ALI culture on the cryomold then on the solidify OCT block. This tip will facilitate the OCT trimming until the mark and visualize the ALI (slightly in yellow). The diagram allows to picture the configuration of the ALI culture in the OCT block. Finally, ALI culture sections could be transferred into Superfrost plus slides. These steps will ensure good-quality sections for further experiments.\nPlaque assays for viral titers on apical supernatants:\nAdd 150 μL of pre-warmed 1× PBS to the apical side of each ALI culture.\nIncubate in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator at ambient O2 for 15 min.\nCollect supernatants by pipetting up/down.\nStore at −80°C in a BSL3 facility until further use.\nSerially dilute (10-fold) each apical supernatant from infected and non-infected ALI (mock) cultures in 1× PBS containing 1% BSA.\nNote: Adjust the volume for a P12-well plate.\nOverlay each dilution per condition on pre-seeded confluent VeroE6 cell (for USA/WA1-2020) or Vero-E6 TMPRSS2 (for Beta, Delta, and Omicron) monolayers.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h with gentle shaking every 5 min.\nNote: When performing in 12-well plates, infect each well with 200 μL of diluted samples.\nOverlay a solution containing 2% Oxoid agarose mixed with 2× MEM supplemented with 0.3% FBS.\nIncubate for 72 h at 37°C.\nFix with 4% formaldehyde solution (100 μL apically and 500 μL on the basal side, at least 12 h at 20°C–25°C).\nWash with 1× PBS, 3 times 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nVisualize viral infection by immune staining with SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody (1C7C7, 1/250) primary antibody for 1.5 h at 20°C–25°C with gentle shaking.\nRepeat the wash step above in (k).",

    "(A) Heatmap representing differentially expressed genes over time in response to SARS-CoV-2 variants. ALI cultures from four donors were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and harvested for sequencing at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dpi, and mock-infected (control media without virus) samples were collected from days 1 through 6 days as well. The sequencing was performed in multiple batches with at least 2 independent experiments at each time-point, the cut-off used for defining differentially expressed genes: |logFC| > 1;   adjusted  p −  value   < 0.01; normalized counts   >   10. Rows represent individual transcripts and columns represent individual biological replicates ordered by time-points and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Batch effect was removed using SVAseq R package. All variants induced expression of genes associated with the viral response at later time-points. This response to the virus from 1 to 6 DPI is depicted by the schematic covering the heatmap, with two “clusters”: one on the lower part “down-regulation” from 1 to 6 DPI, enriched for cilia and epithelium maintenance signatures whereas the upper part showed “up-regulation” of signatures enriched for inflammatory, immune and IFN response.",
