    "NOTE: The clinical study was approved by the Medical Ethics Association of the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (NO. KY01-2019-02-27) and has been registered at the China Clinical Trial Registration Center (No. ChiCTR1800017487 and entitled, \"The multiple modal tasks on gait control and motor cognition after stroke\").\n1. Recruitment\nRecruit stroke patients with the following inclusion criteria: patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for cerebrovascular disease of the Neurological Branch of the Chinese Medical Association (2005); cerebral infarction confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging; damage to the unilateral cortex or with a subcortical lesion; ability to walk independently, Brunnstrom stage ≥ 4 stages; Modified Ashworth Scale11 ≤ 2 points; meeting the requirements of three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis and the ability to tolerate the whole process; and the ability to give informed consent.\nEnsure the following exclusion criteria are met: congestive heart failure, deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities, malignant progressive hypertension, respiratory failure or other diseases, and serious risk of falling.\nObtain written informed consent from all patients before beginning the study.\n2. Clinical evaluation\nRecord the demographic characteristics of the patient including the name, gender, date of birth, level of education, chief complaint, current medical history, past history, medical treatment, and current medications.\nCognitive function assessment\n\t\nAsk the patient to complete the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)12 record the patient's responses to a 30-question scale with a total score of 30 points for cognition evaluation, which involves the following seven aspects: time orientation, position orientation, instant memory, attention and computing power, delayed memory, language, and visual space.\n\t\t​NOTE: The scores of MMSE are closely related to the level of education. The normal cognitive standard is illiteracy > 17 points, primary school > 20 points, and junior high school > 24 points13.",
    "Ask the patient to complete the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)14 record the patient's responses to an 11-question scale with a total score of 30 points for cognition evaluation, which involves the following eight aspects: attention and concentration, executive function, memory, language, visual structure skills, abstract thinking, calculation, and orientation.\n\t\t​NOTE: The normal cognitive standard is ≥ 26 points. If the subject has been educated for less than 12 years, they should add 1 point to the score15.\nWalking ability assessment\n\t\nConduct the 10-m walk test (10 MWT)16. Ask the patient to perform three consecutive trials at a self-selected pace for safety, comfort, and higher speed, respectively. Record the time taken to walk to the middle 6 m in each trial (to exclude acceleration and deceleration effects).\nConduct the timed up and go test (TUGT)17. Ask the patient to perform three consecutive TUG trials (stand up, walk 3 m, turn, walk back, and sit down) at a self-selected pace for safety and comfort18.\n3. 3D gait analysis\nPatient preparation\n\t\nInform the patient about the precautions and the purpose of the experiment.\nAsk the patient to wear tight underwear to fully expose the neck, shoulders, waist, and lower limbs.\nRecord the values of various anthropometric indicators including height, weight, bilateral width of the ankle joints, bilateral knee diameter, pelvic width, bilateral pelvic depth, and bilateral leg length.",
    "Place 22 markers on key points of the patient based on the Davis protocol19: three markers on the trunk (7th cervical vertebrae, shoulders on both sides); three markers on the pelvis (both sides of the anterior superior iliac spine and ankle joint); six markers on the thigh (bilateral femoral greater trochanter, femoral condyle, and middle point of femoral greater trochanter and femoral condyle on the same side); six markers on the calf (bilateral humeral head, lateral ankle joint, and middle point of humeral head and lateral ankle joint on the same side); four markers on the foot (the fifth metatarsal head and the heel on both sides) (Figure 1).\nClick on the Start button of the 3D gait analysis system, and make a new profile for the patient.\nEnter basic patient information and previously measured parameters.\nStanding data acquisition\n\t\nInstruct the patient to maintain an upright position on the force plate for at least 3-5 s to gather the baseline data.\nClick on the Proc_Davis_Standing button to quickly check the position of the marker.\nWalking task data acquisition\n\t\nDetermine the random order of three walking tasks by drawing lots.\nAsk the patient to walk on the walking pass for five trials at a self-selected comfortable speed, which is marked as Task 0 (consider the single walking task as the Baseline task).\nAsk the patient to walk while holding a bottle of water on the walking pass for five trials at a self-selected comfortable speed, which is marked as Task 1 (simple dual-motor task).\n\t\tNOTE: Ask the patient to hold a 550 mL bottle of water in the unaffected hand while holding the arm position of the shoulder joint at 0° and elbow flexion at 90°.",
    "Ask the patient to walk across the line in the middle of the walking pass for five trials at a self-selected comfortable speed, which is marked as Task 2 (complex dual-motor task).\n\t\t​NOTE: Place a soft ruler in the middle of the walking pass before Task 2 data acquisition.\n4. Data processing and analysis\nSelect the middle three trials of each walking task to be processed to ensure the patient is stable.\nIdentify each gait cycle with two consecutive heel stride points on the same side.\nMark the toe-off point in each gait cycle20.\nClick on the Proc_DavisHeel+GI_AE button to compute the kinematic parameters of gait, as well as the computation of the Gait Performance Score (GPS) index.\n5. Data extraction and statistical analysis of interest\nSelect region of interest parameters from the processed data, which include special-temporary parameters (stance phase, swing phase, single stance, double stance, cadence), joint angle parameters (trunk obliquity (frontal plane), trunk tilt (sagittal plane), trunk rotation (transversal plane), pelvic obliquity (frontal plane), pelvic tilt (sagittal plane), pelvic rotation (transversal plane), hip flex-extension, hip ab-adduction, hip rotation, knee flex-extension, ankle dorsi-plantarflexion, and GPS index.\nCalculate DTC values based on the following formula[10]:\n\t([single-task gait velocity - dual-task gait velocity]/ single-task gait velocity) × 100 (1)\nPerform the statistical analysis (see the Table of Materials) using the methodology described previously20,21.\n\t\nPresent parametric data as means and standard deviation if normally distributed or as medians if not.\nUse the paired t-test to compare the differences in kinematic parameters between patients in Task 1 and Task 2 conditions.\nUse one-way analysis of variance to compare three different tasks (Task 0, Task 1, and Task 2) of the kinematic parameters. Set statistical significance at P < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
