    "All animal procedures were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care (IACUC) committee at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n1. Preparation of Reagents\nMaintain murine oviductal epithelium (MOE) cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator in alpha Minimum Essential Medium (αMEM) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mg/mL insulin, transferrin, selenium (ITS), 1.8 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mg/mL gentamycin, and 18.2 ng/mL estradiol-17β. Pass the cells every 3–4 days, ensuring there are enough cells on the same day the mice will be sacrificed.\nPrepare 2% agarose by mixing 1 g of low-melting agarose with 50 mL of distilled water. Autoclave the agarose, allow to cool, and then aliquot (1 mL) in 2 mL tubes (see Table of Materials) before agarose solidifies. Agarose can be stored at -20 °C indefinitely.\nPrepare at least 2 mL of 1x Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) media.\nFor the matrix for MALDI-TOF MS, prepare 10 mL of 5 mg/mL 1:1 alpha-cyano-4-hyroxycinnamic acid (CHCA):dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) (see Table of Materials) in 90:10 ACN:H2O + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Sonicate solution until matrix is dissolved.\n2. Mouse Colony and Ovary Removal\nMaintain breeding pairs of CD-1 mice using standard housing procedures. Near the day of parturition, check the mice every day so that the age of the pups is known.\nEuthanize pups at 16–18 days of age by CO2 inhalation per NIH guidelines. Deliver CO2 (100%) at a flow rate of 10%–20% chamber volume per minute and continue for two minutes after respiration had stopped. Confirm euthanasia by cervical dislocation.",
    "Disinfect all surgical equipment by submerging in 70% ethanol. Warm Leibovitz’s L-15 media with 1x penicillin-streptomycin to 37 °C.\nWet the abdominal surface with 70% ethanol to disinfect the area and minimize contamination with hair. Grasp the skin covering the abdominal wall using blunt forceps and use surgical scissors to make a large V-shape cut through the skin and abdominal wall, exposing the internal organs.\nMove the internal organs to the side using forceps. Individually grab each uterine horn with fine forceps and lift slightly.\nLocate the ovary, which will be at the end of the uterine horn, immediately below the kidney. Use surgical scissors to dissect the ovary free of connective tissue. Then, cut the ovarian horn in half.\nMove the ovary, oviduct, and approximately one half of each uterine horn to pre-warmed Leibovitz’s L-15 media.\nUnder a dissecting microscope carefully move each ovary from the surrounding bursa, freeing it from the oviduct, bursa, and any adipose tissue. Move each ovary to a new dish of Leibovitz’s L-15 media.\nCut each ovary in half axially. Keep the ovarian pieces (now called explants) kept at 37 °C until plating of agarose.\n3. Setting Up and Incubating the ITO-treated Slide for Cocultures\nUndivided cocultures\nLiquify the agarose at 70 °C on a hot plate.\nPlace the 8-well divider on top of the indium tinoxide (ITO)-treated slide (Figure 1A). The rubber bottom on the divider aids in adhesion to the slide, but make sure to apply continuous gentle downward pressure during agarose plating to ensure no leaking or mixing between wells.",
    "Collect cells in a 15 mL conical tube, centrifuge (5 min at 800 rpm), and resuspend to 50k cells per 150 µL in 1x DMEM media. If a different cell density is optimal, make sure that at this step the cell suspension is 2x the final density desired (e.g., for a final concentration of 50,000 cells in 300 µL, cell density at this step is 50,000 cells in 150 µL).\nBefore plating cell culture, add ovarian explant to center of well (Figure 1B).\nAdd agarose to each cell culture in individual 2 mL tubes just before plating. For each well, combine 200 µL of cell suspension and 200 µL of liquified agarose in a 2 mL tube. For example, for four wells, combine 800 µL of cell suspension and 800 µL of 2% agarose. Some mixture will be left over, but making slightly more than necessary avoids air bubbles during pipetting.\n\t\t\nAdd agarose to individual cell cultures immediately before plating that cell culture. The agarose will cool in under a minute, so be prepared to plate quickly.\nImmediately add 300 µL of the cell/agarose mixture to each well (Figure 1C). Figure 1C shows three cell conditions and one media condition, each plated with and without an ovary.\nIncubate slide at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.\nDivided Cocultures. \nCut dividers from thin, smooth plastic (Figure 2A).\n\t\tNOTE: This experiment uses the sides of a sterile disposable media basin because they are flat and thin. Cut them just wide enough to fit snugly into the hypotenuse of the well (~13 mm).\nLiquify the agarose at 70 °C on a hot plate.",
    "Place the 8-well divider on top of the ITO-treated slide (Figure 2B). The rubber bottom on the divider aids in adhesion to the slide, but make sure to apply continuous gentle downward pressure during agarose plating to ensure no leaking or mixing between wells.\nCollect cells in a 15 mL conical tube, centrifuge (5 min at 800 rpm), and resuspend to 50k cells per 150 µL in 1x DMEM media. If a different cell density is optimal, make sure that at this step the cell suspension is 2x the final density desired (e.g. for a final concentration of 50,000 cells in 300 µL, cell density at this step is 50,000 cells in 150 µL).\nInsert plastic dividers diagonally into wells (Figure 2C).\nAdd agarose to each cell suspension one at a time just before plating. For each well, combine 100 µL of cell suspension and 100 µL of liquified agarose in a 2 mL tube. For example, for four wells, combine 400 µL of cell culture and 400 µL of 2% agarose. Some cell/agarose mixture will be left over but making slightly more than necessary avoids air bubbles during pipetting.\n\t\t\nAdd agarose to individual cell cultures immediately before plating that cell culture. The agarose will cool in under a minute, so be prepared to plate quickly.\nOn one side of the divider, plate 150 µL of cell/agarose mixture. Allow agarose to cool and solidify (approximately one min) and then remove the divider (Figure 2D).\nPlace ovary explant in the center of the empty half of the well. Place 150 µL media/agarose mixture over top of the ovary, and only in the correct side of the well (Figure 2E).\nIncubate slide at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.\n4. Drying Slide and Preparing for MALDI-TOF MS",
    "After four days (or any preferred time point), remove the chamber divider from the agarose plugs and the slide (Figure 1D). Gently detach the sides of the agarose from the chamber with a flat spatula and gently pull the chamber upward, being careful not to move any agarose plugs. If they do move, gently reposition them so that they are not touching one another.\nPlace the slide in a 37 °C oven for approximately 4 h, rotating 90° every h.\nNOTE: The rotation of the slide is important to ensure even heat distribution throughout the sample.\nOnce dry, remove the slide from the oven (Figure 1E).\nApply matrix solution using the sprayer (Figure 1F), with the following parameters: temperature = 30 °C, flow rate = 0.2 mL/min, number of passes = 8, direction = CC, and nozzle distance = 40 mm.\n\tNOTE: In lieu of a matrix sprayer, an artistic airbrush can be used to apply liquid matrix. The same matrix solution can be used to spray, but approximately twice as much solution is required. With the slide clamped so that it hangs vertically, spray the slide from a 90° angle from approximately one foot away (Adapted from Hoffmann15) until the matrix layer is visible.\nAdd 1 µL of calibrant (Phosphorus Red for targets <500 Da, a peptide mixture (see Table of Materials) for targets <5,000 Da) to clear spot on slide. Phosphorus Red requires no mixing with matrix, but the peptide mixture requires 1:1 mixture with matrix to aid ionization. Wait for calibrant to dry.\nDraw an X using a permanent marker in each corner of the slide and take an optical image using a camera or a scanner at 1,200 dpi.\n5. Imaging Mass Spectrometry Data Acquisition",
    "Open a new sequence on the IMS data analysis software (see Table of Materials). Set the raster width to desired spatial resolution, at least 50 µm.\nUpload the optical image of the slide to the analysis software and set three teach points using the intersections in the X’s drawn in each corner.\nDesignate regions of interest for imaging in the acquisition software and name them accordingly.\nCalibrate the instrument using the data acquisition software (see Table of Materials) within 5 ppm error.\nSave the optimized method and begin run. This experiment optimized the following parameters: Polarity = Positive, Detector = Reflectron, Laser size = 2, Laser power = 50%, Reflector mode detector gain = 3x.\n6. Processing IMS Data\nImport .mis file into statistical software (see Table of Materials) for analysis of significance.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
