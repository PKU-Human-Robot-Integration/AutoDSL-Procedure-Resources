  "procedures": [
    "Zebrafish were maintained in the fish facility of the Institute of Toxicology and Genetics (ITG) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Experiments on animals were performed in accordance with the German animal protection standards and were approved by the Government of Baden-Württemberg, Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany (Aktenzeichen 35-9185.81/G-272/12 'Adulte Neurogenese').\n1. Generating a Stab Wound in the Telencephalon\nAnesthesia\n\t\nTo prepare a stock solution of tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester, also called ethyl 3-aminobenzoate) use 400 mg of tricaine powder and dissolve it in 97.9 ml water and 2.1 ml 1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9). Adjust the pH to 7. Make 5 ml aliquots and store them at -20 °C until usage.\nTransfer an appropriate number of 0.5-1 year old zebrafish from their tanks into plastic mouse cages. Note: The skull of an adult zebrafish at about 12 months of age is still relatively soft and can be perforated easily with a needle (see section 1.2.3 and Figure 1A).\nTo anesthetize the adult zebrafish, combine 5 ml tricaine (stock solution) in a plastic crossing cage with ~100 ml of clean fish tank water (final concentration of tricaine 0.02% (w/v) tricaine).\nIncubate the fish in the anesthetics until they do not move anymore (45-60 sec).\nTelencephalon Injury\n\t\nPlace individual anesthetized zebrafish into a slit in a block of tricaine-soaked foam.\nUnder a dissecting microscope with light from the top gently hold the fish with one hand and orient it in a way that allows access to the head from the top.",
    "With the other hand push a 30 G syringe (insulin syringe with integrated needle) vertically through the skull into the medial region of one telencephalic hemisphere (Figures 1A-1B). The hemispheres of the telencephalon are visible through the skull. Make sure that the introduced lesion is not deeper than 2 mm (Figure 1C). Note: It is highly recommended to introduce the lesion always into the same hemisphere to ease the identification of the site of lesion when dissecting the brain out of the skull.\nAfter introducing the telencephalic injury, place the fish into fresh fish water. Keep up to 10 fish in a 2 L mouse cage filled with fish water for recovery and connect the mouse cage to a water flow system. Note: The survival rate is usually ~97% if fish are healthy and no other experiments were performed with the fish before. Addition of antibiotics to the fish water is not necessary. After recovery, fish behave normally: they swim, feed, and mate.\n2. Analyzing the Effect of Telencephalic Injury\nBrain Dissection and Fixation\n\t\nRe-anaesthetize the recovered fish at different time points after lesion (typically, 1, 3, 5, and 14 days post lesion (dpl)) with 0.02% (w/v) tricaine as above and euthanize them by putting them into ice water for 5 min.\nPlace the fish on a paper tissue soaked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and separate the head from the body by cutting behind the gills with a sharp scissor.\nKeep the heads in 1x PBS for 5 min in order to allow bleeding. Note: This drains blood from the tissue, which may perturb further steps in the protocol.\nFix the heads overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS or 4 hr at room temperature (RT).\nWash fixed heads twice with 1x PBS in a petri dish.",
    "Dissect brains carefully in 1x PBS under a dissecting microscope23. The lesion is usually visible under the dissecting microscope. Brains without a visible lesion should be discarded.\nTransfer brains into 2 ml reaction tubes filled with 1.5 ml 100% Methanol (MeOH) and invert the tubes 5x before incubating them at -20 °C for at least 16 hr. Note: The brains can be kept for several months in MeOH at -20 °C until needed for immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization.\nTissue Preparation for Immunohistochemistry\n\t\nRehydrate the brains through a descending methanol series in 2 ml plastic tubes (sequentially 75% MeOH (1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 = PTW); 50% MeOH, 25% MeOH. Incubate the brains (15 brains/2 ml reaction tubes) for 5 min in each solution.\nWash the brains in PTW for 5 min. Repeat 4x with fresh PTW.\nEmbedding of the Brains for Sectioning\n\t\nFor embedding, transfer the brains from the 2 ml reaction tube in PTW into the cavities of a polyethylene molding cup tray with a transfer pipet (5 mm diameter).\nPrepare 2% agarose (DNA grade) in 1x PBS in an Erlenmeyer flask. Heat it in the microwave at 600 W until the agarose is dissolved completely. Prepare 50 ml for 10 brains. Let the agarose cool down for 3 min at room temperature before usage. Keep the agarose on a pre-heated heating block (60 °C) while embedding the brains in order to prevent solidification.\nRemove the 1x PBS from the mold containing one brain by using a Pasteur pipette (1 mm diameter). Be careful not to damage the brain.\nPour agarose into the mold and fill it entirely. Then use a dissection needle to swirl the brain in the agarose to wash away the PTW making it easier to embed the brain.",
    "Orient the brain in the mold ventral side down, dorsal side up and place it straight.\nLet the agarose cool down. For faster cooling, place the mold on ice. Repeat steps.\nRepeat 2.3.3-2.3.6 for all brains.\nTrimming of the Agarose Block\n\t\nUsing a dissection needle, pop out the agarose block.\nWith a sharp razor blade, cut the agarose at the posterior end of the brain. Make sure this plane is parallel to the telencephalon.\nCut the agarose at the anterior end of the brain. Then flip the block so that it stands on the posterior plane.\nRemove the excess of agarose by cutting in parallel to the brain’s dorsal and ventral sides. Then flip the brain back so that it lies on its ventral side.\nCut the block to a truncated triangle in which the telencephalon is located at the smaller plane (Figure 2).\nPreparing the Vibratome for Sectioning\n\t\nPrepare the vibratome according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use a new razor blade and replace it after 10 brains.\nFill the buffer bath with 1x PBS to a level that just reaches the bottom of the blade.\nPlace a small dot of superglue on the top of the specimen disc of the vibratome.\nCarefully place the plane that is located posterior to the brain on the superglue. The glue will harden as soon as it is in contact with the 1x PBS in the vibratome buffer bath.\nInsert the specimen disc with the specimen into the buffer tray using the manipulator of the microtome.",
    "Use the manipulator to rotate the specimen disc into the desired position. Orient the block in the buffer bath in a way that locates the telencephalon just under the surface, with the dorsal part of the brain facing the blade. Then tighten the scrw with a 3 mm Allen key and remove the manipulator. Note: The clamping screw or one of the clamping devices must not be located over the gap in the specimen disc; in these positions clamping the specimen disc is not possible.\nSectioning the Brain\n\t\nPrepare a 24-well plate to collect the sections. Per brain to be sectioned, fill one well with 1 ml of blocking buffer (0.1% (v/v) 10% Tween-20, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in PBS).\nStart sectioning at 50 μm thickness, 1 mm/sec speed, and 70 Hz frequency using a vibrating microtome.\nUse a synthetic brush (1 mm) to pick up the thin slices of agarose as they come off the blade and collect them in the 24-well plate.\nImmunohistochemistry on Vibratome Sections\n\t\nBlock non-specific binding sites for 1 hr at RT in blocking buffer (0.1% (v/v) 10% Tween 20, 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 1% (v/v) DMSO in PBS).\nRemove the supernatant and add 250 μl of antibody diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Alternatively, incubate the primary antibody for 2 hr at RT. Then wash 3x for 10 min in PTW. Note: For PCNA staining use a 1:400 dilution (mouse anti-PCNA. For details see table of materials). Multiple primary antibodies can be incubated at the same time.",
    "Incubate the sections in secondary antibody for 2 hr at RT then wash 3x for 10 min in PTW. Note: 1:1,000 dilution in PTW, for detail see table of materials. Multiple secondary antibodies can be incubated at the same time.\nOptional: The best results are observed when sections are kept in PTW overnight at 4 °C in order to allow washing out of non-specifically bound secondary antibodies. In this case, replace the PTW once again before mounting.\nAdult Brain RNA in situ Hybridization (alternatively to immunohistochemistry)\n\t\nBrain Dissection and Fixation (same procedure as for immunohistochemistry):\n\t\t\nHybridization of probe.\nRehydrate brains in 2 ml reaction tubes as described for immunohistochemistry.\nIncubate brains in proteinase K (ProtK; 10 μg/ml final conc.) in PTW for 30 min. After incubation time remove ProtK/PTW and fix the brains again for 20 min in BT-Fix (4% PFA, 4% sucrose, 0.12 mM CaCl2, 77 mM Na2HPO4, 23 mM NaH2PO4).\nWash brains 5x for 5 min in PTW (0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS).\nRemove PTW and rinse the brains in 500 μl HYB buffer (50% (v/v) deionized formamide, 5x SSC, 500 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 50 μg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween-20, 9 mM citricacid). Wait until brains sink to the bottom of the tube then discard the supernatant and add 500 μl of clean HYB buffer and incubate at 65-70 °C for 3-4 hr.\nDilute the RNA probe to 1:200 or 1:400 (depending on the probe) in 400 μl final volume of HYB buffer. Heat the diluted RNA probe at 70 °C for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant from the brains and add the RNA probe, incubate at 65-70 °C (O/N). All wash buffer solutions should be prewarmed and kept at 70 °C. \nLabeling",
    "Wash the brains at 65-70 °C (during all 4 washing steps) with 500 μl of wash buffer 1 (50% formamide, 1x SSC, 0.05% Tween 20) twice for 30 min. Replace buffer 1 by buffer 2 (2x SSC, 0.1% Tween 20), and incubate for 15 min. Remove buffer 2 and wash brains in buffer 3 (0.2x SSC, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min, repeat this step 2 twice. Replace buffer 3 by buffer 4 (0.1x SSC, 0.05% Tween 20 in PTW), incubate for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and wash for 5 min in 500 μl of PTW at RT.\nEmbed brains in 2% agarose (in 1x PBS) and cut vibratome sections (50-100 μm) as described for immunohistochemistry.\nWash 1x for 5 min in 500 μl blocking buffer (1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 1% (v/v) DMSO).\nRemove supernatant and add 500 μl blocking buffer for 2 hr at RT.\nRemove supernatant and add 300 μl anti-Dig AP-coupled antibody diluted 1:4,000 in blocking buffer.\nIncubate o/n at 4 °C.\nNBT/BCIP Staining\n\t\t\nWash 5x for 15 min with PTW buffer at RT.\nRinse 1x in staining buffer. Wash twice 5 min in staining buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl pH 9.5, 50 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20).\nRemove supernatant and stain with 500 μl staining solution (3.5 μl of 4-Nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) and 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) per 1 ml staining buffer).\nStop staining by rinsing 3x to 5x with PTW.\nMounting of Sections\n\t\nMount the sections on slides using a water-soluble, non-fluorescent mounting medium (see the Materials table).\nKeep slides in the fridge at 4 °C. Note: The staining is stable for several weeks or even months.\nAnalyze the slides under a compound or confocal microscope."
