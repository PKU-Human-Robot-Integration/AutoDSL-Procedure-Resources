    "The local ethical committee approved the publication of this clinical case. A written informed consent form was collected from the patient.\n1. Clinical and audiological evaluation\nCollect personal or familiar history of VHL disease or compatible symptoms from the patient.\nPerform a neurological examination to investigate central causes. Ensure that there is no pathological cause to be underlined and the facial nerve function is normal.\nAssess external, middle, and inner ear functionality and assess whether a complete audiological and otoneurological evaluation is necessary.\nAfter a bilaterally negative otoscopy, perform a hearing assessment using a pure tone and vocal audiometry with a classical clinical audiometer and a tympanometry with stapedial reflex study with a clinical tympanometry.\n2. Imaging study\nPerform an MRI to further exclude other causes of vertigo and to study the internal auditory canal (IAC) and pontocerebellar angle (PCA), 2 days after the hospitalization.\n\t\nUse a 1.5 T MRI system equipped with an 8-channel phased array head coil to perform the brain, brainstem, and petrous bone examination.\nFor the MRI examination protocol, use axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and axial fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences. Target steady-state free precession (SSFP) images with a FIESTA (Fast Imaging Employing Steady-state Acquisition) sequence on the inner ear. Acquire high-resolution volumetric images with T1-weighted SPGR (Spoiled Gradient-Recalled) sequence before and after contrast media administration.\nPerform a high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) of the petrous bone, with a 64-slice scan to confirm the presence of any isodense mass.\nAfter the execution of the MRI and the HRCT, define the grading of the tumor and plan the surgical approach for the mass resection. Discuss the prognosis of the surgery and the disease with the patient.\n3. Surgical management",
    "Twenty-four hours before the surgery, have an experienced interventional neuroradiologist perform an arterial embolization of the mass on a biplane angiograph.\nPerform the embolization with poly vinyl alcohol particles of 150-250 microns size with selective catheterization of the feeding vessels.\nIf as in this case, there is limited extension of the tumor but a relevant hearing deficit, schedule a surgical resection of the mass through a translabirinthine approach to be performed by a 25 years-experienced surgeon of the ear and the lateral skull base.\nAfter a C-shaped retroauricolar incision and the raising of a temporalis muscle's flap, perform an ample mastoidectomy with a Striker S2 πDrive drilling system.\n\t\nCut round precision and fluted tips, as well as coarse and fine diamond round tips, depending on the drilled structures.\nExpose the sigmoid sinus and the dura of the middle cranial fossa posteriorly and superiorly, respectively.\nComplete an ample antrotomy with a complete exposure of the small process of the incus and then, prepare a posterior tympanotomy.\nDrill out all the retro-facial mastoid cells up to the mastoid tip, until the identification of the jugular bulb.\nComplete the posterior labyrinthectomy with semicircular canals until the identification of the internal auditory canal (IAC).\nIdentify the neoplasm after the complete exposure of the dura of the middle and posterior cranial fossa, in the endolymphatic sac area. If the the neoplasm is indivisible from the dura of the posterior cranial fossa, cut the dura and remove it en-bloc with the tumor. If the neoplasm has reached and invaded the IAC, open the IAC to completely remove the tumor.\nConduct an intraoperative extemporaneous histological examination.\nSeal the posterior tympanotomy and the antrotomy with surgical wax, and fill the ample mastoid cavity with autologous abdominal fat and fibrin glue.",
    "Check for post-surgical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and assess the blood loss due to surgery.\n4. Postsurgical course\nIn the post-operatory course, check for vertigo, residual hearing, CSF leakages, and facial nerve palsy among other complications.\nSubscription Required.
