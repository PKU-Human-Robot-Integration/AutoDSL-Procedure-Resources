    "All rats were treated according to Danish national guidelines described in the Danish law on animal experiments and Ministerial order on animal experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board and conducted in accordance with the Danish law for animal research (authorization number 2012-15-2934-00384, Danish Ministry of Justice).\n1. Adjustment of the Ligating Clip Applier\nNOTE: The banding of the pulmonary trunk is performed with a modified open ligating clip applier with an angled jaw. The applier is modified with an adjustable stop mechanism to stop the compression when the jaws reach an exact distance from each other. When a small titanium ligating clip is compressed with the modified applier, a lumen persists between the legs of the clip with a specific diameter according to the adjustment of the stop mechanism (Figure 1).\nChoose the diameter of the desired banding, e.g., 0.6 mm.\nAdjust the ligating clip applier until the distance between the jaws is 1.0 mm when fully compressed. This leaves a lumen of 0.6 mm as the two clip legs have a thickness of 0.2 mm each.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58050/58050fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1: The PTB procedure. (A) The surgical instruments used for the PTB procedure including the ligating clip applier (blue arrow). (B) The adjustable stop mechanism of the ligating clip applier. Turning the cogwheel (blue arrow) will adjust the position of the pin (yellow arrow), which stops the closing of the applier when the jaws reach a certain distance from each other. The distance corresponds to twice the thickness of the legs of the clip plus the inner diameter of the clip, when the clip is compressed, and can be calibrated by using for example a needle with a known outer diameter. (C) The applier compresses a titanium clip to an exact inner diameter pre-specified by adjustment of the applier. (D) The inner diameter of the compressed clip can be adjusted in order to induce different severities of RV hypertrophy and failure. For the data presented, an inner diameter of 1.0 mm was used to induce mild RV hypertrophy, an inner diameter of 0.6 mm was used to induce moderate RV failure, and an inner diameter of 0.5 mm was used to induce severe RV failure.

Preparation of the Rat\nNOTE: Other regimens of analgesics may be applied.\nUse Wistar rat weanlings weighing approximately 100–120 g. In order to maintain body temperature during the surgery, use a covered heating pad.\nFor surgery, use a mechanical ventilator set to a tidal volume of approximately 1.75 mL and respiratory rate of 75 per min.",
    "Anaesthetize the rat with sevoflurane (7% mix in 1.5 L of O2) in an induction chamber for 5 minutes. Intubate the rat using a 17 G IV cannula, where the distal 2 mm of the needle have been cut off in order for the soft catheter to cover the tip. Remove the needle and connect the cannula to the ventilator.\nPlace the rat on its back on the heating pad. Make sure that the intubation is correct by observing the movements of the thorax. These should be without side differences and in pace with the ventilator.\nNOTE: Absence of movements of the thorax, abdominal contractions and inflation of the stomach in the upper left abdomen are signs of a misplaced tube. Remove the cannula, put the rat back in the induction chamber and re-intubate.\nAfter correct intubation, reduce the sevoflurane to maintenance concentration (3.5% mix in O2, 1.5 L/min) and fix the paws of the rat to the heating pad.\nConfirm prober anesthetization by checking withdrawal reflexes of the extremities using a forceps to squeeze the paws of the rat.\nInject the rats with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.)) and carprofene (5 mg/kg s.c.) to relieve post-operative pain.\nShave the chest and disinfect with chlorhexidine.\n3. Isolation of the Pulmonary Trunk\nWith a pair of scissors, make a 2 cm incision in the skin along the middle part of the sternum. Identify the major pectoral muscle and cut its sternal attachment. Identify the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th costa below.\nOptionally, grab the 2nd costa with a fixation forceps, put a suture (4-0, multifilament, absorbable) around the 2nd costa from the 1st intercostal space to the lower medial part of the 2nd intercostal space. Tie a firm knot in order to ligate the anterior thoracic artery.",
    "NOTE: This can be useful if bleeding from the anterior thoracic artery is a recurrent issue.\nCut the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd costa close to the sternum with a pair of scissors and carefully dissect the intercostal muscles until a complete left thoracotomy has been performed. If any bleeding from the anterior thoracic artery occurs, compress with a pean and ligate the artery.\nInsert a retractor between the sternum and the costae and open it to get a good operating field. At the top of the field is the thymus covering the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. Carefully lift the thymus using a pean and flip it upwards in order to expose the aorta and the pulmonary trunk below.\nGuide the tip of a small surgical hooklet with a 85° angle through the transverse pericardial sinus located behind the left atrial appendage. Pull it halfway back through the sinus and guide the tip of the ear hook upwards until it appears between the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk.\nRemove any connective tissue covering the tip with an iris scissor in order to separate the pulmonary trunk from the ascending aorta.\nRepeat the step with a larger hook (optional).\nGuide an angled muscle forceps around the pulmonary trunk through the passage made with the hook(s). Grab the end of an approximately 10 cm ligature (4-0, multifilament) and pull half of the ligature back through the passage. Now the pulmonary trunk is separated from the ascending aorta and can be controlled by the ligature around it.\n4. Application of the Clip",
    "Load the adjusted ligating clip applier with a clip. Carefully guide one of the jaws and one leg of the clip though the passage around the pulmonary trunk. Use the ligature to gently pull the pulmonary trunk upwards and into the fork of the clip.\nWhen the pulmonary trunk is in the fork of the clip and the two tips of the clip legs are free of any connective tissue, compress the clip with the applier to apply the banding.\nObserve how the RV immediately dilates in response to the banding and remove the ligature.\n5. Closing of the Thorax\nRemove the pean from the thymus and reposition the thymus to its natural position. Remove the retractor.\nClose the thorax in three layers: the intercostal layer, the major pectoral muscle, and the skin with suture (4-0, multifilament, absorbable). Inject 2 mL of saline s.c. to replace fluid lost during surgery.\nTurn the sevoflurane off and and keep the rat on the ventilator (1.5 L of O2) until it starts breathing spontaneously. Then, extubate the rat.\nTreat the rats with buprenorphine in the drinking water for the following three days14 or apply a similar analgesic protocol. After three days, the rats have recovered and are without discomfort.\nIn the following weeks, the well-being of the rats and possible adverse effects should be evaluated on a daily basis. The healing of the wound from the thoracotomy should receive special attention during the first week in order to detect any signs of infection or insufficiency of the cicatrices. If the rats show signs of failure to thrive including bristly fur, impaired mobility, respiratory problems, and weight loss, they should be monitored closely and euthanized if they lose more than 20% of their body weight or develop fulminant respiratory insufficiency. \n6.
