    "1. Nanoparticle Preparation\nAll steps involving solvent or dissolved/emulsified polymer should be performed in a chemical fume hood.\nWeigh 100 mg (+/- 5 mg) of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and place in a 13 mm x 100 mm test tube.\nTransfer 1 ml solvent (ethyl acetate (EtAc) or dichloromethane (DCM)) to the sample with a glass serological pipette.\nCover the top of the tube with a small piece of aluminum foil, and Parafilm the foil securely, being sure to wrap the Parafilm tightly across the top edge of the vial as well as the bottom edge of the foil.\nMark the level of the solvent on the outside of the test tube. Let the polymer dissolve overnight, adding additional solvent the next day if evaporation occurs.\n\tNote: Polymer can also be dissolved the day of nanoparticle preparation, if needed. Follow steps 1.1-1.3, then vortex on high until all polymer is completely dissolved (~10 min).\nPrepare a work area in the fume hood with the following equipment/materials next to the ultrasonicator: a vortexer, two small glass Pasteur pipettes with rubber bulbs, and a magnetic stir plate. Place a large beaker full of ice water on a stand below the ultrasonicator.\nAdd 45 ml of 0.3% w/v Vitamin E-TPGS to a 200 ml glass beaker with a magnetic stir bar and set stirring speed to 360 rpm.\nAdd 2 ml of 0.3% w/v Vitamin E-TPGS to a 13 mm x 100 mm glass test tube.\nAdd drug:\nFor hydrophobic agents: add encapsulant directly to the polymer solution (being careful to avoid the walls of the test tube) and vortex the tube until encapsulant is homogenously dispersed.",
    "For hydrophilic agents: emulsify encapsulant with the polymer solution before proceeding. Add up to 50 μl of drug in water or buffer to the surface of the polymer solution. Ultrasonicate briefly to emulsify the drug with polymer (typically 10 sec, or as necessary to achieve a homogenous, opaque solution). This sonication step should be performed on ice.\nPlace the open tube polymer/encapsulant near the vortexer. While holding the test tube containing Vitamin E-TPGS vertically and on high vortex, use a glass Pasteur pipette to add the polymer/encapsulant solution dropwise. Be careful to avoid the sides of the tube and drop the polymer solution directly onto the surface of the vortexing emulsifier. After the entire 1 ml of polymer solution has been added to the Vitamin E-TPGS, continue vortexing the solution (now an emulsion) for an additional 15 sec.\nImmediately transfer the emulsified polymer to the ultrasonicator. Keep the test tube immersed in ice water and sonicate the emulsion in three 10 sec bursts (40% amplitude for a 700 W sonicator, 1/8 in probe tip size). Move the emulsion up and down the probe to ensure even sonication, being careful to avoid touching the probe to the sides or bottom of the test tube. Pause between each ten second sonication to allow the solution to cool before proceeding.\nAdd 1-2 ml of 0.3% Vitamin E-TPGS from the stirring solution to the emulsion with a glass Pasteur pipette, which thins the emulsified polymer so that it will pour more easily. Empty the emulsion into the stirring solution. Repeat this step to wash out any remaining solution from the test tube into the stirring solution.",
    "Allow nanoparticles to harden while stirring for three hours. If the encapsulant is light-sensitive, the beaker may be wrapped in aluminum foil, leaving the top open to facilitate solvent evaporation.\n2. Nanoparticle Collection\nSplit the hardened nanoparticles into two Oak Ridge centrifuge tubes (30 ml nominal volume) and balance to within 0.1 g.\nCentrifuge nanoparticles in a fixed-angle rotor for 15 min at 17,000 x g. Longer centrifugation times will result in the collection of a higher fraction of smaller nanoparticles.\nDiscard the supernatant, being careful not to disturb the nanoparticle pellet (water may be poured or pipetted off). Add 15 ml diH2O and use a water bath sonicator and/or vortexer to completely resuspend the nanoparticles.\nCombine the contents of the two centrifuge tubes into one and repeat steps 2.1-2.3 2x more, for a total of three washes in 30 ml of diH2O each time. The fluid volume of the last pellet resuspension should be 4-5 ml.\n\tA weight ratio of 1:2 trehalose:polymer may be added at this point as a cryoprotectant (freeze a small aliquot of nanoparticles without trehalose for SEM imaging). Ice crystals that form during the freezing process may damage the particle surface and induce aggregation, and inclusion of trehalose has been shown to improve the uniform and complete resuspension of PLGA nanoparticles13.\nTransfer the nanoparticles to a preweighed 5 ml centrifuge tube and freeze at -80 °C for a minimum of 30 min.\nMoving quickly so as not to let the frozen contents melt, uncap the tube and cover the top by securing lab tissue across the top with a rubber band. **If any melting occurs, refreeze before placing in the lyophilizer.\nLyophilize 72 hr for a 5 ml volume. Store lyophilized particles in Parafilm-wrapped tube at -80 °C.\n3. Sizing and Surface Morphology",
    "Scanning Electron Microscopy\nSamples for SEM should be prepared the day of imaging. Place a strip of double-sided carbon tape on an SEM stub. Permanent marker may be used to label the metal portion of the stub for later reference.\nUse a metal spatula to collect a small quantity of lyophilized nanoparticles and gently spread them across the surface of the tape. Brush the surface of the stub with a lab tissue or use compressed air to remove loose nanoparticles.\nSputter coat the sample with gold-paladium for 30-120 sec. A longer sputter time will produce a smoother surface for imaging, although this may result in the loss of fine surface details.\nTypical parameters for visualizing particles are a working distance of 5-15 mm, beam strength of 5-12 kV, and a spot size of 1-3. Higher beam strengths may result in regional heating of the sample, which will alter the surface morphology of the particles. Microparticles are observed at 100X magnification and nanoparticles will be distinguishable at 3,000X magnification.\nThe ideal sample will consist of a uniform coating of particles across the flat surface of the stub. Occasionally, secondary structures (including flakes or spheres) may result from lyophilization. Focusing on the edge of a flake, where the flake meets tape, or the top of a sphere will help to locate particles that can be easily visualized with SEM. Collect at least three images per batch in order to obtain a representative sample of particle size and morphology."
