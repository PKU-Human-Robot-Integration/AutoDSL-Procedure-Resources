    "The fat tissues were obtained from orthopedic surgeries as certified by the Institutional Review Board of Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Animal Care Committee at National Defense Medical Center, Taiwan (R.O.C).\n1. Wet Spinning Process\nSolution preparation\nDissolve 5 g of gelatin powder in 100 mL of double-distilled water to obtain 5% (w/v) solution concentration.\nStir the mixture slowly at 60 - 70 °C overnight to achieve a completely homogeneous dispersion without any bubbles.\nWet spinning\nFiber formation\nNOTE: A schematic of the method is shown in Figure 1A. The spinning setup is equipped with a peristaltic pump machine (see Table of Materials) that provides high-precision speed and controls the smooth delivery of the flow.\n\t\t\nPlug a 26 G x 1/2 inch (0.45 mm x 12 mm) syringe as the solution injector into clear vinyl tubing.\nPrepare 100 mL of 99.5% acetone solution in a beaker glass to be used as the coagulation bath.\nRun the peristaltic pump machine at 21 rpm (3.25 mL/min) and let the gelatin solution stand for several seconds in acetone solution before rolling it up.\nTake out the gelatin fibers from the acetone solution and immerse them into 2.5% (w/v) of polycaprolactone/dichloromethane (PCL/DCM) solution with 1:20 (w/w).\nLet the gelatin fibers in the PCL/DCM solution dry overnight, under the hood at room temperature.\nTube formation\nNOTE: A schematic of the method is shown in Figure 1B.\n\t\t\nUse a peripheral venous catheter of 24 G x 3/4 inch (0.7 mm x 19 mm) as tube mold.\nLoad the catheter into the gelatin solution and hold it there for 3 s.\nLoad the catheter into the acetone solution and hold for 1 min.",
    "Load the catheter again into the gelatin solution and hold it there for 3 s.\nRepeat this alternate procedure 20x.\nTake out the catheter from the acetone solution and let the molded tube dry at room temperature for 5 min.\nGently take out the gelatin tube from the catheter by using a hemostat and carefully transfer the gelatin tube into a glass Pasteur pipette with the immersion of 2.5% (w/v) of the PCL/DCM solution.\nLet the Pasteur pipette containing the gelatin tube and PCL/DCM solution dry overnight, under the hood at room temperature.\n2. Morphology of the Gelatin Tube\nMount the piece of dried gelatin tube on a carbon stub.\nPut the sample into the ion sputter coater machine (see Table of Materials) and coat the sample with gold for 60 s; then, observe its morphology by scanning electron microscopy(see Table of Materials).\n3. Culture of Human Adipose Stem Cells\nPlace the fat tissues (obtained from oral adipose tissue by clinical surgery) into a Petri dish containing 10 mL of transfer solution consisting of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.1% glucose.\nCut the tissues into small pieces (less than 1 mm2) with a scalpel blade.\nTransfer the tissues into a 15 mL plastic tube and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and incubate the sediment in a plastic tube containing 10 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, consisting of 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 15 mg/L phenol red) with 0.1% collagenase at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2, for 1 day.",
    "Centrifuge the plastic tube at 500 x g for 5 min, discard the supernatant carefully (do not touch the sediment), and then, suspend the sediment gently by adding 10 mL of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and let it stand for 1 day at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.\nCentrifuge the plastic tube at 500 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant carefully; then, add 1 mL of stem cell medium (consisting of keratinocyte serum-free medium (K-SFM), 5% of FBS, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, streptomycin, and amphotericin) to suspend the sediment, transfer it into a T25 culture flask containing 4 mL of stem cell medium, and let it stand for 3 days at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and incubate it at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 3.5 min, to detach the cells from the bottom of the culture flask.\nAdd 1 mL of FBS, suspend the mixture, and transfer it to a microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 500 x g for 3.5 min, suspend the sediment with 1 mL of stem cell medium, and transfer it to the culture flask containing 5 mL of stem cell medium; then, keep it at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.\nMaintain the subculture by changing the stem cell medium every 3 days.\n4. Cultivation of Cells on the Gelatin Tube\nSterilize the gelatin tube with UV light for 2 h; then, immerse it in 75% (v/v) ethanol and wash it 2x with stem cell medium to remove the residual ethanol.",
    "Collect the human adipose stem cells (hASCs) from the culture flask.\nRemove the medium from the culture flask.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 3.5 min, to detach hASCs from the bottom of the culture flask.\nAdd 1 mL of FBS, suspend the mixture, and transfer it to a microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the microcentrifuge tube at 500 x g for 3.5 min; then, discard the supernatant carefully, and suspend the sediment with 1 mL of stem cell medium.\nPlace the gelatin tube in a 6-well plate containing 3 mL of stem cell medium and seed 4 x 104 of hASCs to the tube; incubate them for 2 weeks at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.\nChange the stem cell medium every 3 days to provide enough nutrition for cell growth.\n5. Immunocytochemistry\nRemove the stem cell medium and wash the well with PBS.\nFix the tube with cells with 0.1% acetic acid glacial for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash the well 2x with PBS.\nAdd a surfactant (NP-40, 0.05%) and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash the well 3x with PBS.\nAdd 2% normal goat serum and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nDecant the solution, add primary antibody nestin (neural progenitor cell marker), and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the well 3x with PBS.\nAdd secondary antibody donkey anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and keep the sample in the dark for 2 h.\nWash the well 3x with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of Hoechst 33342 to stain the nuclei and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash the well gently and observe it under a fluorescence microscope.\n6. In Vivo Biocompatibility Test",
    "NOTE: Rats with a weight between 201 - 225 g have been successfully tested using this protocol.\nAnesthesia\nInduce and maintain anesthesia; preferably, anesthetize a rat (8-week-old Sprague Dawley rat, female) via an intramuscular injection of tiletamine and zolazepam (25 mg/kg + 25 mg/kg, respectively) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). Perform a pain stimulation test by pressing the rat's fingers to confirm the anesthetization.\nSterilization of the surgical site\nShave and clean the skin of rat’s trapezius area (over the back of the neck) and wipe it with povidone-iodine lotion to prepare the aseptic condition of skin (100 mg/mL).\nCover the rat with sterile surgical drapes to reduce bacterial transfer and subsequent contamination of the surgical site.\nImplantation of the gelatin tube\nGently cut the skin of rat’s trapezius area with a surgical scissor.\nCreate a wound of 2 cm and place the gelatin tube directly on the layer between the fascia and the muscle.\nPostimplantation surgery\nClose the wound with nylon suture and wipe it with povidone-iodine solution (100 mg/mL).\nInduce the rat via an intramuscular injection of ketoprofen (2.5 mg/kg) and cefazolin (15 mg/kg).\nKeep the rat under aseptic conditions for 7 days.\nEuthanasia\nRat is euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation in accordance with AVMA Guidelines for Euthanasia. Confirm the death of rat by toe and tail pinch, followed by chest touching to ensure the heartbeat.\nCut the rat gently with a scalpel blade, remove the implanted tissue, and take photos for observation.\nSubscription Required.
