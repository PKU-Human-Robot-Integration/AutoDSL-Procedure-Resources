    "Preparation of E. coli suspensionInoculate 50 ml LB broth with an E. coli colony from an LB agar plate under sterile conditions. Add ampicillin (200 µg/ml final).Incubate overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Use spectrophotometer to measure optical density at 600 nm (OD600).Dilute 500 µl aliquot of bacterial over-night suspension 5-fold with 2 ml of LB brothMeasure OD600 of diluted bacteria with broth, and broth alone.Subtract OD600 of fresh LB broth from bacteria with broth and calculate OD600 of over-night culture.Dilute over-night 50 ml bacterial culture to OD600 = 0.1 with LB broth.Spin 50 ml of bacterial suspension 4,000 x g for 10 min in Falcon tubes at room temperature.Decant LB broth.Re-suspend in 50 ml of 1x PBS by vortexing. Adjust with PBS to OD600 = 0.1.Heat-Kill bacteria (optional; see Note 2)Aliquot 1 ml bacterial suspension into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Incubate at 65 °C for 20 min.Bacterial solution is now ready for injections.Preparation of injection needlesPlace glass capillary in Micropipette puller.Run program to create needles tapered like the needle pictured (Figure 1).Ramp + 5, Pull = 90, Velocity = 70, Delay = 70imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426185046_8687.jpgFigure 1. Tapered injection needle. Arrow indicates preferred place to break it.Stretch a Kimwipe taut over a Falcon tube and stab needle through the Kimwipe to break the very tip of the needle.Fly sterilizationUse a small needle (26 G) to poke three to four holes in the paper filter of the spin columns and place back into collection tube.Add 25 anesthetized flies to one spin column (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426230425_0146.jpgFigure 2. Spin column for Fly sterilization. 25 flies are loaded into a spin column (S) and covered with 70% ethanol. Spin columns are placed in a collection tube (C) to contain the flow through of wash solutions in the centrifuge during the quick spin.",
    "Flies are retained in the spin column by the paper filter at its bottom.Add 700 μl 70% ethanolQuick spin on mini benchtop centrifuge (~3-4 sec).Remove spin column from collection tube and pour out flow through and place spin column back into collection tube.Repeat ethanol wash steps 3c-3e.Wash with 700 μl sterile water.Quickspin on mini benchtop centrifuge (~3-4 sec).Repeat water rinse steps 3g and 3h.Fold Kimwipe and place in empty fly vial.Put flies into vial with Kimwipe, plug and place at 25 °C until flies have recovered.Calibration of injection volume (see Note 3)Load 1 μl bacterial solution into the pulled needle using Microloader tips.Attach needle to Pico-injector.Adjust Pico-injector pressures, injection time to achieve 50 nl per injection.Typical starting values for our set-up: 1) Balance pressure = -0.2 psi–Should be neutral .2) Injection pressure = 15 psi.3) Injection time = 2 msec.For calibration: put a drop of mineral oil on a microslide.Inject bacterial solution into oil to determine nl per injection (a needle loaded with 1 µl should yield 20 equal sized droplets of 50 nl each).Adjust injection time and pressure until desired amount is injected.Optimal Pico-injector values will vary slightly between needles.Injection of sterilized flies (see Notes 4 and 5)Sterilize fly pad with 70% ethanol, allow to dry.Place sterilized flies on fly pad.Under dissecting microscope hold a fly in place by its legs with a small brush.Hold injecting rod and needle with other hand.Insert needle into the notum of the immobilized fly (Figure 3).Inject bacterial solution into fly using foot pedal–Audible beep will confirm.Repeat until all flies have been injected.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170426/20170426185424_3147.jpgFigure 3. Injection of flies with bacterial suspension. Anesthetized flies are held with a brush as they are injected using a pulled glass needle (see Figure 1) filled with a bacterial suspension.",
    "Incubate flies and monitor survivalPlace ≤ 15 injected flies into vial containing fresh standard Drosophila media.Vials should be lightly yeasted and contain no more than 1.5 ml of fly food. This minimizes the danger of flies getting stuck in yeast or between the side of the vial and the food as the food tends to dry at later days and separate from the vial.Place vials with flies into 25 °C incubator and note how many flies are alive 2 h after injection. Flies that do not recover from injections should be discarded from the dataset and subsequent analysis.Count dead and living flies every day, once a day until all are dead. For bacteria more pathogenic than E. coli, shorter time intervals will be important.Flip flies into fresh vials every 5 days."
