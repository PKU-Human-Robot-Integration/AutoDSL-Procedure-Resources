    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue collection, transport, and banking\nTiming: 2 h\nHere we describe the best practices to transport and store the resected hippocampal tissue after surgical removal.\nThe neurosurgeon collects the anterior and posterior hippocampal tissue by initially resecting the lateral temporal cortex to expose the hippocampus after opening the temporal horn of the ventricle.\nFollowing division of the amygdalo-hippocampal sulcus, the hippocampus is reflected inferiorly on its vascular pedicle until the fibria and adjacent choroidal fissure are visualized. After opening the alveus just lateral to the fimbria, an anterior-posterior line of dissection is carried along the hippocampal axis until the arteries feeding the hippocampus are identified and sequentially divided, freeing the hippocampus from its pedicle in an en bloc fashion. The tail of the hippocampus is severed posterior to the lateral geniculate nucleus.\nNote: Only specimens greater than 3.5 cm in length in the anterior-posterior dimension are included.\nAn approximately 0.5 cm segment is removed from the anterior and posterior poles of this specimen for processing. Anterior specimens are taken from a location anterior to the uncal notch.\nSend the middle portion of the hippocampus for neuropathological analysis.\nCritical: This pathological analysis is a key step of the tissue exclusion criteria. Specimens with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) are excluded unless the scope of the study includes studying the pathogenesis related to MTS. Other neuropathological findings such as astrogliosis are noted and shared along with the study results.\nCarefully drop anterior and posterior hippocampal specimens into separate 50 mL conical tubes containing ice-cold Neurobasal A Medium after surgical resection. Place the tubes on ice and transport the tissue back to the laboratory within 20 min for processing.",
    "Wash tissue in ice cold 1× PBS. Using a scalpel, dissect out ∼25% of each specimen for RNA integrity analysis.\nCritical: Since it is not possible to get RNA integrity (RIN) values once tissue is processed as single nuclei, it is important to isolate RNA from a small piece of adjacent tissue. RIN values for each specimen will provide insights into RNA quality for a given sample and can be used as a covariate for computational analysis.\nTransfer specimens into prechilled and prelabelled Eppendorf tubes. Flash-freeze the tissue in liquid nitrogen.\nRNA isolation and RIN: Isolate total RNA from the dissected piece (from Step 4) using a standard RNA isolation. Determine RIN values for each sample using a RNA Screen Tape Analysis system (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions\nCritical: Label the tubes with both case identification number and date of the tissue collection. Update the tissue inventory spreadsheet accordingly. Using the date and time of the surgery can be a more reliable way to track the samples and helps avoid any confusion between the lab and surgical department.\nNuclei isolation\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section includes steps for the complete digestion of the plasma membrane yielding single-nuclei dissociation of human hippocampus. Similar approaches have been used in previous studies (Habib et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). We adopted this dissociation protocol and the coupled it with a modified sucrose gradient.\nUsing a scalpel, dissect the surgically resected hippocampal tissue into smaller than ∼0.3 cm3 on a petri dish placed on ice. This step should be performed quickly without allowing the tissue to thaw.\nLyse the tissue pieces\nTransfer tissue pieces to a Dounce homogenizer containing 2 mL of ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis buffer.\nUse pestle A for 20 strokes, followed by 20 strokes with pestle B while on ice.",
    "Transfer the homogenate to a 15 mL conical tube, add 2 mL of ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis buffer and mix by pipetting with a glass pipette. Incubate on ice for 5 min.\nCollect the nuclei by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant and carefully resuspend nuclei in 4 mL of ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis buffer. Incubate on ice for 5 min.\nRepeat the centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspended the nuclei in 500 μL of nuclei suspension buffer (NSB) consisting of 1×PBS, 1%BSA and 0.2 U/ul RNAse inhibitor.\nFilter nuclei suspension using a Flowmi Cell Strainer (Bel-Art, H13680-0040). Based on the amount of debris in the suspension, it might be hard to filter. Try filtering smaller volumes and using a new filter for every ∼100 μL volume.\nNote: At this point of the protocol tissue lysis is complete and nuclei are dissociated in the suspension. However, using adult human brain as starting tissue results in a large amount of debris. Filtering is effective in removing debris larger than nuclei however smaller size cellular and/or myelin debris often remains after filtering. We implemented the following sucrose gradient to obtain a cleaner nuclei suspension.\nSucrose gradient\nTiming: 1 h\nPreparing a nuclei suspension with minimal debris is key to minimize technical noise in snRNA-seq datasets. Typically, ultracentrifugation at higher speeds has been used to separate subcellular compartments such as nuclei (https://www.protocols.io/view/nuclei-isolation-from-human-brain-using-sucrose-gr-scneave[href=https://www.protocols.io/view/nuclei-isolation-from-human-brain-using-sucrose-gr-scneave]). Working with relatively smaller tissue amounts from human hippocampus, we noticed that there is a high degree of nuclei loss during ultracentrifugation potentially due to the larger volume of tubes used in the ultracentrifuge. Adopting the modified sucrose gradient using a tabletop centrifuge as is detailed below minimized the nuclei loss.",
    "Remove the debris using a density gradient centrifugation\nAdd 500 μL of the sucrose solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to a 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 900 μL of the sucrose solution to 500 μL of isolated nuclei in NSB.\nLayer 1400 μL nuclei suspension (from Step 11b) to the top of the sucrose solution (from Step 11a).\nCentrifuge this gradient at 13,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C.\nResuspend and wash nuclei pellet\nCarefully remove the myelin layer on the top and the supernatant containing the cellular debris (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1025-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Insets show closeup displaying individual nuclei without DNA blebbing. Scale bar = 50 microns.\nResuspend the nuclei pellet in 500 μL NSB and transfer the solution to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100–300 μL NSB\nFilter the suspension through a 40-μm Flowmi Cell Strainer (#H13680-0040, Bel-Art).\nQuality control and nuclei count\nTiming: 30 min\nHere we describe how we evaluate the quality of the nuclei suspension and calculate the nuclei concentration. In terms of quality control, we consider this protocol successful if 1) nuclei appear as a single-nuclei solution and are not clumped together, and 2) nuclei look intact. For these quality control steps the following staining approaches were used.\nAssess nuclei integrity with Ethidium Homodimer-1 (EthD-1) staining.\nStain 10 μL of nuclei suspension (from 11e) with 4 μM EthD-1 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). EthD-1 emits red fluorescence upon binding to DNA and will show DNA blebbing if the sample quality is low. Visualize stained nuclei under an epifluorescence microscope in the red channel.",
    "Count nuclei with Trypan Blue staining\nStain 10 μL of nuclei suspension (from Step 11e) with 10 μL of premade 0.4% Trypan Blue.\nLoad the stained sample on a hemocytometer and visualize the nuclei under a bright field microscope. Count blue/purple stained nuclei.\nAdjust the final concentration of nuclei to 1000 nuclei/μL with NSB.\nContinue with preparation of droplet-based single-nuclei RNA-seq libraries using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ kit (10× Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol"
