    "1. Setting up the genetic cross and preparing the egg collection cup\nSelect female flies (virgin) from the optogenetic line UASp-CIBNpm (I); UASp-CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry (III) on a CO2 pad under a stereomicroscope and set up a cross with male flies from the maternal GAL4 driver line 67 Sqh-mCherry; 15 E-cadherin-GFP.\n\tNOTE: The 67 and 15 stand for maternal-Tubulin-GAL4 inserted into the second (II) and third (III) chromosomes, respectively52. The GAL4 line used in this protocol also expresses the mCherry-tagged myosin regulatory light chain Sqh (Spaghetti squash)37 and GFP-tagged E-cadherin53. Flies from the optogenetic line may still contain FM7 and TM6 balancer chromosomes. Flies from the maternal GAL4 driver line may still contain the CyO and TM3 balancer chromosomes.\nAfter ~10 days, select F1 female flies having the following genotype: UASp-CIBNpm/+; 67 Sqh-mCherry/+; 15 E-cadherin-GFP/UASp-CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry. Set up an egg collection cup with the male flies.\n\t\nEnsure that the female flies with the correct genotype do not contain any balancer chromosomes (i.e., they should not contain curly wings [Cy], short bristles [Sb], bar- or kidney-shaped eyes [B], or extra humeral bristles [Hu]), which are markers for the CyO, TM3, FM7, and TM6 balancers used in generating the stocks, respectively. Cover the cup with an apple juice plate with a tinge of fresh yeast paste on the surface.\n\t\tNOTE: In F1 females, the optogenetic components are expressed maternally. Therefore, the F1 females used for setting up the cup do not need to be virgins. It is recommended to use male flies from the same F1 population for the cup for convenience.",
    "Keep the cup in a cardboard box covered with aluminum foil to avoid any possible light leakage from the environment. Change the apple juice plate every day for cups kept at room temperature (~21-23 °C), or every two days for cups kept at 18 °C.\n\t\nImmediately before plate change, knock the cup on a flat surface (e.g., bench top) to keep the flies at the bottom of the cup and prevent them from escaping. Change the apple juice plate in a dark room and use a headlamp with red light for illumination (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: To increase the expression of the constructs that are under the control of maternal-Tubulin-GAL4 and UASp, it is recommended to keep the cup at 18 °C for a minimum of 3 days before embryo collection. This incubation period also allows the flies to adapt to the cup and be well fed on the yeast paste to achieve optimal egg production.\n2. Collection of embryos at the desired stage and preparing them for optogenetic stimulation\nNOTE: All sample collection and preparation steps need to be performed in a dark room, using a \"safe light\" (e.g., red light) for illumination. The optogenetic components are immensely sensitive to ambient light. Even the slightest exposure to ambient light leads to premature stimulation of the specimen. Typically, lights in the green-red range (>532 nm) do not cause unwanted stimulation.\nFor collecting embryos at early embryogenesis, place a new apple juice plate on the cup 8 to 16 h prior to embryo collection (at 18 °C).",
    "At the time of embryo collection, change the apple juice plate. Label the plate taken off from the cup and cover the plate's surface with a thin layer of Halocarbon oil 27 (see Table of Materials). Wait for 30-60 s for the eggshell to become transparent.\nPlace an orange-red plastic shield (see Table of Materials) on the stage of an upright stereoscope. The placement of the orange-red shield prevents undesirable stimulation during sample illumination by blocking the blue-green wavelengths from the transmitted light.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, an upright stereoscope is used for embryo collection (see Table of Materials).\nPlace the apple juice plate on top of the orange-red shield. Turn on the transmitted light of the stereomicroscope to illuminate the sample. Collect 5-15 embryos at the appropriate stage from the apple juice plate using a pair of tweezers. Do not squeeze the embryos with the tweezers.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, the appropriate embryo should be at the early-mid cellularization stage. The embryo at this stage should have a dark opaque yolk surrounded by a clear, uniform periplasm layer that contains the forming blastoderm cells. The leading edge of the cleavage furrows (\"cellularization front\"), which appears as a continuous line parallel to the surface of the embryo, should not pass half of the depth of the periplasm.\nGently blot the embryos on a piece of paper towel (~1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) to remove excess oil from the embryos using the tweezers.",
    "Add several drops of freshly prepared 40% bleach (~3% sodium hypochlorite; see Table of Materials) to a new small square piece of paper towel (~1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) using a plastic transfer pipette so that the paper towel is covered with a thin layer of bleach. Transfer the embryo from the dry paper towel to the bleach-soaked paper towel using the tweezers and make sure the embryos are soaked in bleach. Wait 2-4 min for the embryo to become dechorionated.\nAfter dechorionation, use the tweezers to blot the square paper towel on a large piece of tissue paper to remove excess bleach. Ensure that the side with the embryos is facing up.\nTo rinse the embryos, use the tweezers to gently soak the square paper towel in a drop of deionized water and quickly blot it on a large piece of tissue paper. Repeat this process eight times to ensure the removal of any residue bleach.\nUse an eyelash tool to transfer the embryo from the paper towel to a 35 mm glass-bottom dish (see Table of Materials). Add deionized water to the dish to cover the embryos entirely. Fine-tune the position and orientation of the embryos using the eyelash tool.\n\tNOTE: After dechorionation, the embryo tends to stick on the surface of the glass and is immobile without perturbation, so it is not necessary to apply additional treatment (such as glue) to immobilize the embryo on the glass-bottom dish.\nPlace the 35 mm glass-bottom dish with the embryos inside a lightproof black box (see Table of Materials) to protect the sample from light exposure during the transfer process. Bring the box to the room with the multiphoton microscope.\n3. Optogenetic stimulation, laser ablation, and imaging of the embryo",
    "NOTE: The multiphoton system used in this experiment (see Table of Materials) is capable of simultaneous dual-wavelength imaging. It also contains a photostimulation unit with a 458 nm laser and a separate galvanometer scanner, allowing photo-activation/stimulation within a defined region of interest (ROI). Of note, the 920 nm laser, which is used to excite green-yellow fluorescent proteins, will stimulate Opto-Rho1DN, albeit more slowly compared to blue laser-mediated stimulation.\nCover the multiphoton microscope with a lightproof black cloth (see Table of Materials) to avoid unwanted stimulation of the embryos during sample setup and imaging.\n\tNOTE: The same approach is used during regular multiphoton imaging to protect the light-sensitive detectors equipped on the microscope.\nTurn off the room light and the computer screens. Turn off the touch panel controller by clicking OFF under 'Backlight of touch panel controller' in the software. Ensure there is no other ambient light in the room.\n\t\nOpen the front side of the black cloth cover on the microscope. Take the 35 mm glass-bottom dish from the black box and place it on the microscope stage.\nIlluminate embryos with a green light normally used as the excitation light for epifluorescence. To do this, turn on the fluorescence illumination unit, select Ocular under the 'Ocular' panel in the software, and change the 'Cube turret' to 4:TRITC. Use the eyepiece to identify the embryo of interest and bring it into focus.",
    "NOTE: The green light visualization is achieved by allowing a white light generated by the fluorescence illumination unit to pass through a built-in standard TRITC filter cube, which contains a 528-553 nm excitation filter, a 565 nm beam splitter, and a 590-650 nm emission filter. Other non-blue lights should also work fine for sample illumination. It is not necessary to wear eye protection at this step, since the excitation light has a low intensity and will not be directed to the eyepiece. The embryo will appear uniformly red due to autofluorescence.\nClose the black cloth cover so that the sample is fully protected from light. Turn on the computer screen to access the software that controls the microscope. Change the 'Ocular' to LSM in the software for image acquisition.\nPerform laser ablation in control, unstimulated embryos using a 25x water immersion objective.\n\t\nClick Bright Z, Sequence Manager, and LSM Stimulation from the 'Tool Window' in the software. Set the scanner type as Galvano and the scan size as 512 × 512. Turn on CH1 and CH3 under the 'PMT setting' panel to allow the use of the 1,040 nm laser, and click Live × 4 to visualize the embryo.\nRotate the embryo using the Rotation function in the software so that the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo is vertically oriented. Set the zoom to 3. Draw a region of interest (ROI) using the shape tool under 'Scan Settings' and set the size of the ROI in the 'Reference' panel. Set the ROI as 512 pixels in width and 100 pixels in height (171 × 33 µm2).\nSet acquisition parameters for the pre-ablation Z-stack.",
    "Register the surface of the embryo as 0 under the 'Z Section'. Set the start as 0 and the end as 100 µm. Set the step size as 2 µm. Activate the Z acquisition mode by checking Z under the 'Series' tab.\nSet 1,040 nm laser intensity to increase linearly from 3% to 7% using the Bright Z function.\nSave the current imaging setting as the first task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The pre-ablation Z-stack is obtained to confirm the stage of the embryo. In this experiment, CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry and Sqh-mCherry will be excited by the 1,040 nm laser. During apical constriction, the Sqh-mCherry signal is enhanced at the medioapical region of the ventral mesodermal cells, whereas CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry is cytosolic before stimulation. The laser intensity employed for pre- and post-stimulation imaging is decided empirically based on the balance between the optimal signal-to-noise ratio and the avoidance of photobleaching.\nSet acquisition parameters for the pre-ablation movie.\n\t\t\nDelete any existing ROI to allow imaging of the entire 512 × 512 pixel region (171 × 171 µm2, 3x zoom) near the ventral surface of the embryo, as described in step 3.5.2. Set the 1,040 nm laser intensity to 3%.\nCheck Time and uncheck Z under the 'Series' panel. Keep the 'Interval' as FreeRun under the 'Time Lapse' panel. Set cycle as 10.\nSave the current settings as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The purpose of this task is to obtain a 10-frame single Z-plane pre-ablation movie with a 1,040 nm laser for image acquisition. The image acquisition speed is approximately 1 s per frame.\nSet the parameters for laser ablation.",
    "Define a 3D region from immediately below the vitelline membrane to ~20 µm deep for laser ablation (Figure 1A). Set the start of the Z-stack as the plane that is immediately below the vitelline membrane and the end as 20 µm deeper than the start plane. Set the step size as 1.5 µm.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The ROI of the ablated region is ~30 pixels in width and ~10 pixela in height (~10 µm along the medial-lateral axis and ~3.3 µm along the A-P axis). The purpose of ablating the sample at multiple Z-planes is to ensure that the apical surface of the ventral cells is ablated. This is specifically important for the stimulated embryos, as the ventral cells experience rapid apical relaxation after Rho1 inhibition.\nTurn on CH2 and CH4 under the 'PMT setting' panel to allow the use of the 920 nm laser. Set the intensity of the 920 nm laser to 30%. Set image acquisition with the 920 nm laser for a single Z-stack within the 3D region defined in step 3.5.5.1 for laser ablation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The laser intensity chosen in this step is sufficient to ablate the tissue (as indicated by tissue recoil immediately after the laser treatment) but meanwhile does not obviously damage the plasma membrane (as indicated by the lack of burn marks on the cell membrane) (Figure 1B,C).\nSave the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\nSet acquisition parameters for the post-ablation movie.\n\t\t\nSet image acquisition for a 100-frame single Z-plane post-ablation movie using both the 1,040 nm and 920 nm lasers. Set the intensity of the 1,040 nm laser and the 920 nm laser to 3% and 0.3%, respectively. The region specified in step 3.5.4 will be imaged with identical image acquisition speed.",
    "Save the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The purpose of storing the parameters described in steps 3.5.3-3.5.6 as sequential tasks in 'Sequence Manager' before any actual acquisition is to ensure the capture of the immediate tissue response after laser ablation.\nSelect Sequence under 'Acquire'. Change the data-saving path and file name as needed. Click Ready and wait for the software to initialize the pipeline. Then click Start to execute the pipeline.\nPerform laser ablation in stimulated embryos.\n\t\nSet acquisition parameters for the pre-ablation Z-stack, as described in steps 3.5.1-3.5.3. Save the current setting as the first task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\nSet parameters for optogenetic stimulation within a defined ROI.\n\t\t\nChange the zoom to 1 and select an ROI that covers the ventral surface of the embryo (~512 × 300 µm2). Turn off the CH1-CH4 detectors.\nClick LSM Stimulation. Uncheck Continuous within Duration and type 12 s. Check the 458 nm with 0.3% laser intensity.\nSave the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking Stimulation in 'Sequence Manager'.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A more rapid stimulation may be achieved by increasing the 458 nm laser intensity. However, when using higher laser intensities, the scattered laser light may stimulate the region adjacent to the ROI, which is not ideal if a spatially confined stimulation is required.\nSet a 3 min wait time after stimulation to ensure total inactivation of myosin and disassembly of apical F-actin, and to achieve a static tissue morphology before laser ablation. This is achieved by clicking on Wait/Pause under 'Sequence Manager' and setting the desired time for 'Wait'.",
    "NOTE: Recruitment of CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry to the membrane caused by a single round of stimulation (0.3% 458 nm laser for 12 s) is clearly detectable 10-15 min after the stimulation. This is in alignment with the published dissociation half-time of ~9 min47.\nSet acquisition parameters for the single Z-plane pre-ablation movie, as described in step 3.5.4, except that both the 1,040 nm and 920 nm lasers are used for image acquisition. Turn on the CH1-CH4 detectors. Set the intensity of the 1,040 nm laser and the 920 nm laser to 3% and 0.3%, respectively.Save the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\nSet parameters for laser ablation, as described in step 3.5.5. Save the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\nSet acquisition parameters for the single Z-plane post-ablation movie, as described in step 3.5.6. Save the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\nSelect Sequence under 'Acquire'. Change the data-saving path and file name as needed. Click Ready and wait for the software to initialize the pipeline. Then, click Start to execute the pipeline.\n4. Quantifying the rate of tissue recoil after laser ablation\nOpen the post-ablation movie in ImageJ.\nDraw a small ROI along the ventral midline that covers the ablated region using the Rectangle Selection tool. The width of the ROI is nine pixels. The height of the ROI is set such that the ROI is large enough to cover the full range of tissue recoil after laser ablation.\n\t\nClick Duplicate under the 'Image' tab. In the pop-up window, check Duplicate stack and then click OK to duplicate the stack within the selected ROI.",
    "Generate a montage from the duplicated stack through Image > Stacks > Make Montage. In the pop-up window, set the row number to 1 and the column number to the total number of frames in the stack (100 in this case).\nMeasure the A-P width of the ablated region over time from the generated montage.\n\t\nUse the Multi-point tool in ImageJ to mark out the A-P boundaries of the ablated region for each time point on the montage.\nSave the coordinates of the marked dots using File > Save as > XY Coordinates.\nImport the measured XY coordinates into MATLAB. Calculate the A-P width of the ablated region for each time point by subtracting the Y coordinate of the upper boundary from the Y coordinate of the lower boundary.\nDetermine the rate of tissue recoil by fitting the first 20 s of the \"width over time\" curve into a line using the 'polyfit' function in MATLAB. Report the slope of the fitted line as the rate of tissue recoil.\nPerform statistical tests to compare the rate of tissue recoil between the stimulated and non-stimulated samples.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to obtain data from at least five embryos per condition. Both the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the two-sided student t-test can be used for statistical comparison.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
