    "Culture the cyanobacterial cells at 30 °C in 200 ml of BG11 medium, with illumination (10 W m-2) and aeration, to the exponential phase of growth (optical density at 730 nm ca. 0.3 to 0.4).Harvest cells in 4 x 50 ml tubes by centrifuging at 3,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature (Tabletop centrifuge). Discard supernatant by decantation and collect precipitated cells in one of these 50 ml tubes by resuspending them in 50 ml of ice-chilled HN buffer. Repeat the cell-washing step, i.e., centrifugation-resuspension step, twice, with the cells finally resuspended in 3 ml of the same buffer. Transfer the cell suspension into a glass test tube. Work under a dim light on ice for all following steps.Agitate the cell suspension with 2 g of Zirconia/Silica beads by a vortex mixer to disrupt the cells. Agitation for 30 sec at the maximal speed is repeated 4 times with ice-cooling intervals of 60 sec. Transfer the whole cell extracts into a PPCO centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the cell extracts at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C for removal of cell debris (high speed refrigerated centrifuge). Transfer supernatant into a PPCO centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the supernatant at 30,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C (high speed refrigerated centrifuge). Discard supernatant by pipetting and resuspend precipitate in 5 ml of pre-chilled HN buffer. Repeat this centrifugation-resuspension step twice, with the precipitate finally resuspended in a small volume (< 0.5 ml) of the same prechilled buffer.Transfer the resuspended membranes sample for cytochromes and P700 measurement into a micro centrifuge tube. Divide the sample into five aliquots to be stored at -80 °C until use.Dilute the sample with 50 mM Tricine buffer (pH 7.5) to a chlorophyll a concentration of 50 to 70 μM (see Note 1).",
    "Sonicate the diluted sample twice for 1 sec at 20 W with 10 sec interval on ice to disperse the membranes (Ultrasonic cell disruptor). Transfer 200 µl of the sonicated sample into a micro cuvette.Add 2 µl of 100 mM potassium ferricyanide solution (final concentration 1 mM) to the sample in the micro cuvette and mix it well with a micro spatula. Incubate the sample for several minutes at room temperature to completely oxidize cytochromes and P700.Set the micro cuvette in a spectrophotometer and record the absorbance spectra at the range of wavelengths from 500-750 nm at room temperature. The complete oxidation can be confirmed by observation of no further change in the spectrum (see Note 2).Add a few powder particles of hydroquinone to the sample in the micro cuvette and mix it well with a micro spatula to reduce Cyt f. Record the absorbance spectra at the same range of wavelengths in step 10 at room temperature. Check that Δλ maximum in difference spectra of this step minus step10 is exhibited at 556.5 nm. Repeat step 11 several times until Cyt f is completely reduced, i.e., until the spectrum shows no further change (the final amount of hydroquinone, ca. 0.02 to 0.09 mg) (see Note 2).To reduce Cyt b559 and P700 in the sample, add a few powder particles of sodium ascorbate to the sample in the micro cuvette and mix it well with a micro spatula. Record the absorbance spectra at room temperature. Check that Δλ maximum in Cyt b559 difference spectra of this step minus step 11 is exhibited at 559 nm. Also check that Δλ maximum in P700 difference spectra of this step minus step 10 is exhibited at 700 nm. Repeat step 12 several times until Cyt b559 and P700 are completely reduced, i.e.",
    ", until the spectrum shows no further change (the final amount of sodium ascorbate, ca. 0.04 to 0.16 mg) (see Note 2).Add a few powder particles of sodium hydrosulfite to the sample in the micro cuvette and mix it well with a micro spatula to reduce Cyt b6. Record the absorbance spectra at room temperature. Check that Δλ maximum in Cyt b6 difference spectra of this step minus step 12 is exhibited at 563 nm. Repeat step 13 several times until Cyt b6 is completely reduced, i.e., until the spectrum shows no further change (the final amount of sodium hydrosulfite, ca. 0.03 to 0.14 mg) (see Note 2).Quantitate Cyt b559, Cyt b6, Cyt f and P700 by using following formulas, [1], [2], [3] and [4], respectively (see Note 3). The quantitative results should be presented by mean values ± standard deviations from at least three experiments.Cytochrome b559 [μM] = 64.5 x {(A559 - A580) reduced (step12) - (A559 - A580) oxidized (step 11)} [1]Cytochrome b6 [μM] = 71.4 x {(A563 - A580) reduced (step13) - (A563 - A580) oxidized (step 12)} [2]Cytochrome f [μM] = 46.5 x {(A556.5 - A544.5) reduced (step11) - (A556.5 - A544.5) oxidized (step 10)} [3]P700 [μM] = 15.6 x {(A700 - A730) reduced (step12) - (A700 - A730) oxidized (step 10)} [4]"
