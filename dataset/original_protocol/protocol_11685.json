    "All procedures involving the care and use of animals conformed to U.S. National Institute of Health guidelines (NIH Pub. No. 85-23, revised 1996) and the chicken embryo protocols were approved by the Laboratory Animal Management and Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Yangzhou University, China (No.201803124).\n1. Fertilized egg collection and preparation\nNOTE: Unlike mammals, the chicken has millions of follicles in a single ovary, but only a few of these follicles are mature enough to ovulate. Each follicle contains one oocyte or germ cell. As soon as the follicle matures and releases its yolk, it is incorporated into the funnel of the fallopian tube.As the follicle enters the jugular abdomen of the oviduct, semen binds to the egg in the hen's body, and the calcium in the hen's body forms a shell that envelops the fertilized egg, forming a soft-shelled egg in the body. The calcium shell gradually thickens until the egg is produced.\nCollect fertilized eggs from a local vendor or institution, which can be stored at 16°C for 1 week.\n\tNOTE: The high storage temperature will help the embryo to develop, while the low temperature will decrease the embryo viability. The embryos will fail to develop if the storage time is too long.\nScrub the eggshell softly and slowly with 75% ethanol before transferring the eggs to the incubator.\nPlace the eggs sideways, neatly on a rack in an incubator at 37.8 °C and 60% humidity. After 60 h of incubation (HH stage 17), embryos will develop visible blood vessels and the heart begins to beat15.\n\t​NOTE: After 2 days of incubation, small primordial dots, the early stage of the heart, appear. This process is called cherrybeading. At ~2.5 days, heart and other body segments are formed with visible vessels.\n2. Preparation before injection",
    "Prepare glass capillaries that will be used as needles. Before the injection, pull 90 mm glass capillaries with an outer diameter of 1 mm and an inner diameter of 0.6 mm using the puller. Break tips using forceps (the angle of glass capillary usually is 45°) and sterilize the capillaries under UV light for 2 h.\nPrepare exogenous materials such as plasmids, packaged lentiviruses, and PGCs.\n\t\nGently mix the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (an enhanced GFP expressing plasmid, 1µg/µL) with liposome at a 1:3 ratio (m/v). Add water to obtain a final DNA concentration of 10 ng/µL. Let the DNA mixture sit at 37 °C for 20 min before injection.\nThaw viruses on ice before injection. The titer of lentivirus used for injection should be over 5 x 106 Tu/mL.\nDilute parental or modified gonad PGCs (E4.5, HH stage 24) to 2,000-5,000 cells/µL.\n\t\t​NOTE: Here we have shown the injection procedure using trypan blue.\n3. Windowing\nBefore exposing the embryos, sterilize them by gently and softly wiping the surface of the eggshells with 75% alcohol using a cotton ball, ensuring to sterilize the blunt edge of the eggs thoroughly.\nAfter the sterilization, gently tap the blunt end with forceps to create a small window (0.5 cm x 0.5 cm) on the eggshell surface to expose the embryo. Remove the embryo membrane and then place the egg on the holder under the dissection microscope.\n4. Injection\nLook for blood vessels under the microscope and adjust the focus of the dissection microscope to locate the embryo, and then find the blood vessel ready for injection.\nFill the glass needle with the exogenous solution (plasmid, lentivirus, or PGCs) using a pipette slowly, avoiding air bubblesin the needle.",
    "Aim the needle with exogenous solution at the blood vessel, with the needle parallel to the blood vessel being injected.\nGently insert the filled needle into the vessel and turn on the pump to eject the solution (usually the injected volume is ~1-5 µL) under the microscope. The air pump pressure should be low enough to prevent the destruction of vessels, as the excessively high air pressure would damage blood vessels leading to highspeed flow.\n\t\nOnce the exogenous solution is injected into the vessel, ensure that the color of the vessel turns into the solution color and recovers to red in 2-5 s, indicating the exogenous solution is successfully delivered to the vessel. At this point the solution enters the artery, and with the beating of the heart is circulated back to the embryo through the artery, and then to the vein.\n\t\tNOTE: There are two injection sites for vascular injection (Figure 1B): one is the head, where the exogenous solution is injected from the vein in the head of the embryo and into the heart through the blood flow, then circulates to the whole embryo with the heart beating (Figure 1B, Arrow 1). Another is through the dorsal aorta of embryo blood; the exogenous solution is injected and spreads to the whole embryo (Figure 1B. Arrow 2) with the beating of the embryonic heart.\nAfter injection, remove the egg from the stereo microscope and drop 200 µL of Penicillin solution inside the eggshell. Cut a 3 cm long piece of medical tape and seal the window. Gently scrape the tape with scissors to squeeze out any air bubbles and then cut another piece to seal the opening across.\nLabel and place the injected egg back into the incubator and incubate until the required developmental stage or hatching.",
