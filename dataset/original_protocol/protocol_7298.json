    "Cell synchronization and induction of LacI binding Plate U2OS 40-2-6 cells at 4 × 104 cells in 0.5 mL of D-MEM medium supplemented with 8% FBS for each well of a 4-well chamber slide, so that the cells are 50%–60% confluent the next day.Incubate cells in a cell culture incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.Add RO-3306 to a final concentration of 7 μM to the D-MEM medium supplemented with 8% FBS in each well.(Optional) For induction of LacI binding in S phase, add 4-OHT to a final concentration of 1 μM.Note: LacI binding in S phase induces additional replication stress; however, it does not increase a frequency of MiDAS, probably because of the limited capacity for MiDAS (Ishimoto et al., 2021). Incubate cells with RO-3306 at 37 °C for 20 h to synchronize cells at late G2 phase.After 16 h incubation, to induce LacI binding in G2 phase, add 4-OHT to a final concentration of 1 μM (4 h treatment with 4-OHT in the presence of RO-3306) for the remaining 4 h of incubation with RO-3306.Release into mitosis and labeling with BrdU After 20 h incubation, cells are now in late G2 phase.Wash cells three times with 1 mL of 1× PBS, pre-warmed to 37 °C, to remove RO-3306.Add 0.5 mL of pre-warmed D-MEM medium supplemented with 8% FBS.Simultaneously, add BrdU to a final concentration of 10 μM to label nascent DNA.Incubate cells at 37 °C for 20 min, allowing cells to enter prophase.Note: Be quick with washing and treating cells to limit exposure to room temperature (RT), which may disturb cell cycle progression. Pre-warming PBS and D-MEM to 37 °C is also critical for rapid and synchronous entry into mitosis.",
    "Cell fixation, permeabilization, and immunostaining of LacI Gently remove growth medium with a water aspirator attached with a yellow tip (200 μL).Carefully add 1 mL of ice-cold PBS to each well.Gently remove PBS, and carefully add 1 mL of PTEMF buffer for simultaneous fixation and permeabilization of the cells.Incubate at RT for 20 min.Aspirate PTEMF buffer and disassemble chambers from the glass slide. Be careful not to dry out cells during disassembly.Note: Glass slides could be handled by hand, but tweezers should be used to remove and transfer the slides from the solution in Coplin jar. Wash slides by immersing them in Coplin jar containing 50 mL of ice-cold PBS, three times for 5 min each.Place slides in a rectangular dish facing up and remove excess PBS in the hydrophobic area around the wells with a cotton swab. Be quick not to dry out cells.Add 95 μL of primary anti-LacI antibody solution (diluted 1:500, see Recipes) to each well.Close the lid of rectangular dish and incubate at RT for 1 h.Gently drain the antibody solution by tilting slides on paper towel.Wash slides with ice-cold PBS in Coplin jar three times for 5 min each.Place slides in a rectangular dish facing up and remove excess PBS with a cotton swab. Be quick not to dry out cells.Add 95 μL of Alexa 594 secondary anti-rabbit antibody solution (diluted 1:1,000, see Recipes) to each well.Close the rectangular dish and incubate at RT for 1 h.From now on, shield the samples from light to avoid photobleaching of fluorescent dyes.Re-fixation, DNA denaturation, and immunostaining of BrdU Gently drain the antibody solution by tilting slides on paper towel.Wash slides with 50 mL of ice-cold PBS in Coplin jar, three times for 5 min each.",
    "Refix samples by immersing slides in Coplin jar containing 100% methanol (pre-chilled in -30 °C freezer overnight) for 10 min on the bench (at RT).Wash slides with 50 mL of ice-cold PBS in Coplin jar, three times for 5 min each.To denature DNA, immerse slides in Coplin jar containing 50 mL of 1M HCl for 15 min at RT.Note: DNA denaturation is required for immunostaining of BrdU; however, too much treatment with HCl may cause weak DAPI staining at step E3. Wash slides with ice-cold PBS in Coplin jar, three times for 5 min each.Place slides in a rectangular dish facing up and remove excess PBS with a cotton swab. Be quick not to dry out cells.Add 95 μL of primary anti-BrdU antibody solution (diluted 1:200, see Recipes) to each well.Close the rectangular dish and incubate at RT for 1 h.Gently drain the antibody solution by tilting slides on paper towel.Wash slides with ice-cold PBS in Coplin jar, three times for 5 min each.Place slides in a rectangular dish facing up and remove excess PBS with a cotton swab. Be quick not to dry out cells.Add 95 μL of Alexa 488 secondary anti-mouse antibody solution (diluted 1:1,000, see Recipes) to each well.Close the rectangular dish and incubate at RT for 1 h.DAPI staining and mounting Gently drain the antibody solution by tilting slides on paper towel.Wash slides with 50 mL of ice-cold PBS in Coplin jar, three times for 5 min each.Immerse slides in Coplin jar containing DAPI working solution (0.2 μg/mL, protected from light) in PBS for 15 min at RT.Wash slides with 50 mL of ice-cold PBS in Coplin jar, three times for 5 min each.",
    "Place slides on a paper towel facing up and remove excess PBS by cotton swab, taking care to prevent cells from drying out.Add one drop of Fluoro-KEEPER antifade reagent to each well of the slide.Mount with a glass coverslip, ensuring to avoid air bubbles.Wipe off excess Fluoro-KEEPER antifade reagent from the edge of the coverslip.Seal with nail polish at the edge of the coverslip and let it out to dry and cure at RT for at least 2 h or overnight.Proceed to microscopy or store the slide at 4 °C for 1–2 months, keeping protected from light.Image acquisition Image the slide using a fluorescence microscope.Find an area including cells in prophase/prometaphase using the DAPI channel and focus on LacI foci using the Alexa 594 channel.Acquire images for each channel (DAPI, Alexa 488, and Alexa 594) consecutively at the same field position without changing the focus (Figure 2).To evaluate the induction of MiDAS at lacO arrays, calculate colocalization frequencies of BrdU foci with lacO arrays. The numbers of prophase/prometaphase nuclei with a LacI focus and frequencies of nuclei in which BrdU signal forms a focus on the LacI focus are manually scored. Although prophase/prometaphase cells are enriched in this condition, BrdU foci colocalized with lacO foci can be observed in prophase/prometaphase and metaphase cells. In contrast, BrdU incorporation is not detected in G2-arrested cells (not released from RO-3306), as previously reported (Ishimoto et al., 2021).Note: These images should be compared with the control assays without BrdU labeling (Figure 2, bottom) to confirm the specificity of the BrdU signals. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4504/bioprotoc-12-17-4504-g002.jpgFigure 2.
