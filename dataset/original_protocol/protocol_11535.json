    "1. Cleaning the Glass Surface and Preparing Reagents\nPlace a glass surface in an oxygen plasma machine for 5 min at 50% power to clean it.\nPrepare 2.5 ml 2% reconstituted (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) solution, by adding 50 µl of APTES and 2.45 ml of ethanol in a conical tube.\n2. APTES and DSB Functionalization\nAdd APTES solution to the surfaces. Pipette 150 µl per well for 8 well plates. Pipette 100 µl per well for 24 well plates. Pipette 1.1 ml for 60 x 15 mm glass dishes. Cover the surfaces to prevent evaporation and uneven distribution of APTES solution. Place the surfaces on a platform shaker for 50 min at room temperature, which creates an even distribution of the APTES layer.\n\tNOTE: APTES is an aminosilane that forms the first layer of the surface. If using a different surface, heuristically determine the volume of solution needed to cover the surface.\nSelect the temperature for the oven, while the surfaces are on the shaker: Heat to 55 °C for 2 hr for the 8 well plates and 24 well plates. Heat glass only dishes to 90 °C for 1 hr.\nRinse the surfaces with ethanol.\n\t\nAdminister the amount of ethanol required by referencing based on the surface used. Add 150 µl ethanol to each well for 8 well plates. Add 125 µl ethanol to each well for 24 well plates. Add 1.1 ml ethanol for glass dishes.\nRinse the surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface. Rinse twice more using ethanol.",
    "NOTE: If any of the glass bottom well plates have any plastic in them, do not heat them above 65 °C, as the plastic will begin to melt and warp.\nDry with 100% nitrogen gas dispensed from a tank. Place the surfaces in the oven.\nPrepare 2.5 ml of d-desthiobiotin (DSB) solution by combining 1.5 mg/ml DSB in 37.5 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 5 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) in 2462.5 µl of the 0.1 M 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid hydrate (MES) (pH 6) buffer. Then combine both solutions.\nAdd 1 µl of 2-β mercaptoethanol, after 15 min, into the solution to quench the reaction between DSB and EDC. Remove hot APTES functionalized glass surfaces from the oven. Wait 5-10 min for the glass surfaces to cool.\nAdd MES buffer the surface to rinse, using amounts based on the surface. Add 150 µl MES buffer to each well for 8 well plates. Add 125 µl MES buffer to each well for 24 well plates. Add 1.1 ml MES buffer for glass dishes.\nRinse surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface. Rinse twice more with MES buffer.\nApply the DSB solution to the surfaces to allow them to incubate. Add 150 µl DSB solution per well for 8 well plates. Add 100 µl DSB solution per well for 24 well plates. Add 1.1 ml for glass dishes DSB solution.\nPlace the DSB covered glass surfaces on a damp paper towel inside a Petri dish. Cover and incubate in a 4 °C fridge for 18-24 hr.\n3. Streptavidin Functionalization",
    "Rinse each glass surface three times with 1 ml of 1.0x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Rinse surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface. Dilute the streptavidin (SAv) stock solution to 0.4 mg/ml (recommended).\n\tNOTE: PBS is isotonic so it can be used as a medium for dilution and rinsing. PBS is used as a solvent for the SAv, and therefore, will not affect the ability of the SAv to bind to the surface.\nApply 0.4 mg/ml of SAv solution evenly to the surfaces so that a thin layer of forms at the bottom of the glass, select the amount of solution based on surface. For 8 well plates, add 150 µl 0.4 mg/ml SAv solution per well. For 24 well plates, add 100 µl 0.4 mg/ml SAv solution per well. For glass dishes, add 1.1 ml 0.4 mg/ml SAv solution.\nCover and move the plates to a 14 cm Petri dish to retain moisture. Incubate the Petri dish in refrigerator for 18-24 hr.\n\tNOTE: It is essential to utilize consistent volumes of APTES, DSB, and SAv on each surface.\nRinse each glass surface three times with 150 µl of PBS to remove SAv. Rinse surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface.",
    "Wet a paper towel with de-ionized water and place the paper towel flat in 14 cm Petri dish surrounding the plates to retain moisture in the wells. Cover the Petri dish containing the wells. Incubate the Petri dish in a 4 °C Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) refrigerator until needed.\n4. Cell Capture and Release\nStart with T175 flask(s) of cells intended for the experiment. Aspirate the media from flask(s). Wash out the remaining media with 5 ml of room temperature PBS. Aspirate PBS from the flask(s).\nAdd 10 ml of non-enzymatic lifting agent, such as Cell Dissociation Solution, to the T-175 flask of cells. Put the flask in the incubator for 6 min to allow for lifting of the cells from the flask.\nAfter 6 min, add 10 ml of cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; See List of Materials) to inactivate the lifting agent. Take out 20 µl of cells to count number of cells in solution using a hemacytometer.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the functionalized surfaces used in the capture experiment, the number of cells needed varies. For functionalized 8 well plates, use 300,000 cells per well. For functionalized glass dishes, use 1.1 million cells. For functionalized 24 well plates, 125,000 cells are recommended. More information on cell counting is found in the Supplement.\nRepeat steps 4.1- 4.3 for another flask of cells, if fewer cells are present than needed for the experiment. Combine cell suspensions and recount cells to get total number of cells in solution.",
    "Spin down cell suspension in a centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to get a pellet of concentrated cells. Find the appropriate amount of HBSS to add to the cell suspension to get a concentration of 1 x 106 cells per ml, then aspirate the supernatant from the spun down cells, and add the calculated volume. This volume can be calculated using the equations in the Supplement.\nPipette up and down (triturate) to resuspend the cells in solution and reduce cellular clumping in solution that may reduce antibody binding. Split the cellular solution into separate control and experimental solutions. View Supplemental File for components and calculations.\nAdd the biotinylated antibodies to the respective cell solutions as described in the Supplemental File. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C on an end-over-end mixer.\n\tNOTE: For MCF7GFP cells, 0.5 mg/ml hIgG or 0.5 mg/ml HLA-ABC antibodies are recommended. For RAW macrophages, 1 mg/ml mCD11b are recommended at half the volume to account for the dilution differences. For Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs), 0.5 mg/ml hCD31 is recommended.\nWash the functionalized glass surface with HBSS. For this experiment, an 8 well plate is advised.\n\t\nAdd 150 µl HBSS to each well for 8 well plates. Rinse twice more using HBSS. Rinse surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface. Keep cold at 4 °C.\nAdd cell solutions to the wells and wait 45 min for the cells to incubate on ice on the shaker. Make the solution of biotin in sterile HBSS by using calculated volumes as described in the Supplement.",
    "Remove the cell solution from the glass wells by using HBSS.\n\t\nGently pipette 150 µl HBSS into each well. Then pipette out the HBSS. Rinse surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface.\nRepeat two more times. After washing, add HBSS to the wells to keep the cells wet.\nAdd 150 µl of 20 mM biotin solution to each respective release well, and then wait 20 min to allow for reaction.\nRecollect non-specifically bound cells by washing with HBSS as stated above, and then if using fluorescently labeled cells, proceed to fluorescence image the cells. Also image live cells in a flask (as a control, to compare with the cells in the well). If using green fluorescent protein (GFP) transfected cells, the excitation will be 470 nm, and the emission will be 515 nm.\n5. Antibody Optimization: Antibody Titration\nBegin by lifting the cells from the T75 or T175 flask as explained in step 4.1- 4.3.\n\tNOTE: These volumes are calibrated for 24 well plates, but can be changed to suit any glass functionalized surfaces through heuristic testing. A representative antibody titration is shown in Figure 1.\nCount cells using the hemacytometer, and then spin down the cell solution in a conical tube at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Reconstitute cells to 1 million cells per ml, using the calculations described in the Supplement.\nSplit the 1 million cells per ml solution into six different solutions of 500 µl in different centrifuge tubes for the antibody (Ab) solutions.",
    "Dilute the antibody stock solution to 10 µg/ml, 1 µg/ml, 100 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml. Create the controls by using 100 µl of Stain Buffer (PBS + 1% sodium azide + 1% BSA), and 500 µl of cells for the control with no Ab in it. For the blank control (No Ab and no cells), use a solution of 300 µl PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: CAUTION: Sodium azide is extremely toxic, explosive, and extreme care must be taken when using it. Please consult the material safety data sheet (MSDS) and use the appropriate safety equipment.\nCombine and incubate the Ab solutions with the cell solutions in the end-over-end mixer at 4 °C for 30 min. Rinse the functionalized 24 well plates with HBSS three times. Rinse the surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface.\nAliquot 125 µl of each sample solution into the appropriate APTES, DSB, and SAv functionalized well. Incubate at 4 °C or on ice for 45 min on the glass surface. Rinse the surface with HBSS three times to remove non-specifically attached cells. Rinse surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface. Do NOT rinse the bottom row, as those are controls.\nAdd 150 µl of HBSS to each washed well, put the 24 well plates on ice, and then use a plate reader to measure fluorescence of GFP cells (Excitation 485 nm / Emission 528 nm) .\n6. Cell Optimization: Cell Titration",
    "Lift the cells as mentioned in steps 4.1 -4.3.\nCount cells using a hemacytometer. Spin down cell solution in conical tube at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Reconstitute cells to 1 million cells per ml.\n\tNOTE: More information on the use of the hemacytometer can be found in the Supplement.\nPipette 1.6 ml from the cell solution for the 1.6 million cells stock and place in a conical tube. Pipette 800 µl of cells from the cell solution for the 800,000 cells stock and place in a conical tube. Pipette 80 µl from the cell stock for the 80,000 cells stock and place in a conical tube. Pipette 8 µl from the cell stock for 8,000 cells stock and place in a conical tube.\n\tNOTE: Concentrations are given per 8 well plate measurements, replicate as needed. An example of plate output is shown in Figure 2.\nTake the four stock solutions and spin in a centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Re-suspend all stock solutions in 400 µl of HBSS.\nAdd 1.6 µl of 100 ng/ml antibody to the 1.6 million cell stock, 0.8 µl to the 800,000 cell stock, and 0.5 µl to all other stocks. Incubate the antibody for 30 min in the end-over-end mixer for 30 min at 4 °C. Wash the functionalized glass surface with HBSS three times.\n\tNOTE: The functionalized 8 well plate is recommended for microscopy quantification, while the functionalized 24 well plate is recommended for plate reader quantification. Antibody concentration for 8,000 cell stock was not reduced to allow the limiting factor of the capture surface to not be the lack of antibodies in solution, but rather the capturing properties of the surface.",
    "Apply 150 µl of the sample solutions to each well. Apply the 1.6 million cell stock to the first column of wells on the left. Apply the 800,000 cell stock to the second column from the left. Apply the 80,000 cell stock to the third column from the left. Finally apply the 8,000 cell stock to the last column. Incubate for 45 min at 4 °C on the shaker.\n\tNOTE: The 1.6 million cell stock serves as the highest concentration to be tested, and is double the amount of cells that is used typically in cell separation experiments (600,000 cells per well) The 800,000 cell stock serves as the control for the experiment as it is the typical cellular concentration that is used in cell separation experiments (3,000,000 cells per well). The 80,000 cell stock serves as a ten-fold dilution to test for lower concentrations for cellular capture (30,000 cells per well). The 8,000 cell stock serves as a hundred fold dilution to use as a test to check the lower limit of cellular separation (3,000 cells per well).\nRinse with HBSS three times. Rinse surface by discharging and drawing the liquid from a fixed point such as the corner of the well. Hold the pipette at approximately a 70° angle so the tip is not directly pointed into the surface. Collect all washes.\nImage the cells on a fluorescence microscope, if using 8 well plates, take pictures of each surface, and apply 150 µl biotin to each surface for one hour at 4 °C on the shaker. After one hour, rinse biotin release wells with HBSS 3 times as before. Collect all washes from wells for counting with the hemocytometer and image the release wells.",
    "Apply 150 µl of 20 mM excess biotin solution to appropriate biotin release wells for 1 hr, if using 24 well plates, and then rinse those wells 3 times with HBSS. Quantitate 24 well plates using a plate reader. Use a hemacytometer to count cells from all collected well washes.\n7. Image Analysis\nNote: The FIJI software package (http://fiji.sc/Fiji) is recommended for image analysis. Initially, the images were converted into grayscale image, and then the brightness/contrast was altered to bring out the cells.\nLoad up the image, and convert to grayscale by clicking the image tab then scrolling down to \"Type\" and then clicking \"8 bit\".\nIncrease the contrast of the image by clicking the image tab and then scrolling to \"Adjust\". Click on \"Brightness and Contrast\", and then use the scroll bars to make the cells stand out. If using fluorescence images, invert the images to make the cells more defined.\nLoad a plugin onto ImageJ called ITCN (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/itcn.html) to analyze the images.\nOpen ITCN. When a dialog box appears that prompts the user with several parameters to estimate the size of the cell, set the minimum width of the cell of interest first. Click the \"Detect Dark Peaks\" option if the image is fluorescent and the cells are darkened.\nSet the threshold value at 2 initially, and then hit the \"Count\" button. A newly counted version of the picture will appear with red dots delineating where cells have been counted.\nAdjust the threshold and width parameter to get more accurate cellular data by defining the size of a \"cell\". Note: The number of cells counted will be in a dialog box on the right. Changing parameters will give different number of cells counted.",
    "Continue to iterate through the threshold and width parameters until a good estimate is reached for the number of cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
