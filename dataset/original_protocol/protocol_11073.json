    "An established and well-growing PDO culture represents the basis for a successful subculture and cryopreservation described in this protocol. Here, EAC PDOs were generated from EAC patients' primary tumor tissue using the protocol described by Karakasheva T. A. et al17. EAC tissues were collected from biobank under the approval of BioMaSOTA (approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Cologne, ID: 13-091).\nNOTE: EAC PDOs have been cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using a PDO culture medium (Table 1). In the following steps, two methods of the subculture are described in detail. A 12-well plate is recommended for subculturing the PDOs with a seeding density of three extracellular matrix (ECM) gel domes per well, as it allows flexible use of each well and appropriate quantity of PDOs for different purposes. An aseptic technique is compulsory while handling the PDOs.\n1. Preparations in advance\nPre-warm a 12-well plate by placing it into a 37 °C CO2 incubator overnight before subculture to ensure complete warming of the plate. If available, use empty wells from a plate with the current PDO culture.\n\tNOTE: Continuous storage of 1-2 fresh plates at 37 °C is recommended for flexible subculture planning.\nPre-cool 1,000 µL and 200 µL tips with a wide orifice at -20 °C (continuous storage recommended). Pre-cool centrifuge at 4 °C.\nSet up the temperature of the rotating incubator to 37 °C (if single cell digestion is performed).\nIncubate an appropriate volume of ECM gel for 1 h on ice to liquefy. Place cell recovery solution on ice.\n2. Harvesting organoids\nRemove the plate with growing PDOs from the CO2incubator.\nAspirate old medium using a vacuum pump.\n\tNOTE: Avoid touching the domes.\nAdd an appropriate volume of ice-cold cell recovery solution (500 µL/dome) into the well.",
    "Disintegrate the ECM gel by pipetting up and down several times to fragment ECM gel domes into small pieces using 1,000 µL tips with a wide orifice.\nCombine the mixture of PDO, ECM gel and cell recovery solution from a maximum of two wells (six domes) and transfer it into a 5 mL low bind tube (use a second tube in case more wells are used for subculture).\n\tNOTE: Optionally, if ECM gel was not dissolved completely, add an additional 1.5 mL of cell recovery solution to the mixture of PDO, ECM gel, and cell recovery solution.\nIncubate the tube containing the mixture in step 2.5 on ice for 20 min, mix every 5 min by inverting the tube five times to ensure the liquefaction of the ECM gel.\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min at 4° C.\nIf there is a visible and stable pellet after centrifugation, proceed with step 2.10. Otherwise, continue with step 2.9.\nIf there is no visible pellet and the PDOs still seem to be stuck in a gel phase, carefully remove the supernatant with a vacuum pump until the phase containing ECM gel-PDO-Solution is reached and add 3 mL of ice-cold cell recovery solution.\n\t\nInvert the tube a few times and incubate on ice for another 10 min. Mix by inverting the tube from time to time.\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min at 4 °C and continue with step 2.10.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully using a vacuum pump or a 1,000 µL pipette. Try to remove the supernatant as much as possible.\n\tNOTE: Due to the low bind surface of the tube, the pellet will not be as stable as usual.",
    "Store the PDO pellet on ice and proceed with step 3 (without digestion) or step 4 (with single cell digestion) depending on the different purposes.\n3. Subculturing without digestion\nNOTE: This method aims to increase the PDOs' size and density. The larger size and higher density facilitate the embedding process, histological characterization, and PDO expansion. Depending on the PDO split ratios (based on the density of PDOs, a ratio between 1:3 and 1:6 is recommended), resuspend the pellet from step 2.8 in an appropriate volume of liquid ECM gel.\nRemove pre-cooled 200 µL and 1,000 µL tips with a wide orifice from the -20 °C freezer and place them onto a clean bench.\nResuspend the pellet from step 2.11 in ECM gel using pre-cooled 1,000 µL tips. Mix by pipetting up and down about 10 times to make sure PDOs are not clumping and are evenly distributed in the ECM gel.\n\tNOTE: Use 50 µL ECM gel/dome. Always calculate for one dome more than required (e.g., for nine domes (i.e., three wells), resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of liquid ECM gel (450 + 50 µL extra). Try to avoid producing bubbles during resuspension!\nRemove the pre-warmed 12-well plate from the incubator right before seeding the domes.\nSeed domes containing 50 µL ECM gel into the warm plate (three domes/well). Avoid pipetting bubbles into the ECM gel domes.\nPut the plate back into the 37 °C and 5% CO2incubator and incubate for 20-30 min to solidify the ECM gel.\nAdd pre-warmed PDO medium (Table 1) carefully without disturbing the domes.\nCulture the PDOs for 7-14 days until the required density and morphology occur.\n4. Subculturing with single cell digestion",
    "NOTE: The following steps aim to increase the number of PDOs per dome. The single cell digestion facilitates cell number control and PDO expansion.\nPrepare digestion medium by mixing 2 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and 20 µL DNase I (for digestion of three domes).\nResuspend the pellet from step 2.11 with an appropriate volume of pre-warmed 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA + DNase I and mix it about 10 times by pipetting up and down using a 1,000 µL pipette (use normal 1,000 µL tips).\nIncubate for 10 min at 37 °C in a rotating incubator with a rotation speed of a minimum 28 rpm.\nPrepare a 15 mL tube containing 6 mL of Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor (STI, Table 2) solution (per 2 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA).\nAfter digestion, mix the digested PDOs thoroughly a few times with a 1,000 µL pipette to disrupt the PDOs.\nTransfer the digested PDOs to the 15 mL tube containing STI solution to stop the digestion process.\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant carefully using a vacuum pump or a 1,000 µL pipette. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of basal medium (Table 3).\nDetermine cell concentration and viability using an automated cell counter or a Hemocytometer.\nSeed digested PDO into a 12-well plate with 2 x 104 cells per dome.\n\t\nCalculate the cell number according to the domes planned for seeding and transfer them to a fresh 1.5 mL low bind tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Calculate for one dome more (+ 2 x 104 cells extra). For example, for seeding three domes into one well, take 8 x 104 (2 x 104* 3 + 2 x 104 extra) cells.\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min at 4 °C.",
    "In case there is no visible pellet, remember the orientation of the tube inside the centrifuge to know where the pellet is located.\nCarefully discard the supernatant using a 1,000 µL pipette. Remove the supernatant as much as possible without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd appropriate volume of ECM gel to the pellet using a 1,000 µL pipette with pre-cooled 1,000 µL wide orifice tip (50 µL/dome + 50 µL extra).\nFollow steps 3.3-3.7.\n5. Cryopreservation of the digested and undigested PDOs\nNOTE: Single cell digested and undigested PDOs are suitable for the preparation of frozen backup stocks. Note that re-cultivated PDOs from the single cell frozen stocks require a longer time to recover and to reach a certain size.\nCryopreservation of the undigested PDOs.\n\t\nStart cryopreservation process with the pellet from step 2.8. Use 500 µL of cold freezing medium to resuspend the pellet and transfer it to a cryogenic vial.\n\t\tNOTE: Store two domes per vial.\nFreeze PDOs overnight in a -80 °C freezer using an appropriate cell freezing container.\nCryopreservation of the single cell digested PDOs\n\t\nAfter harvesting and digesting PDOs, start cryopreservation from step 4.8.\nFor storing one cryogenic vial, transfer 4-5 x 105 cells into a fresh 1.5 mL low bind tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Store three domes/vial.\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 4 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant carefully using a 1,000 µL pipette. Remove the supernatant as much as possible without disturbing the pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of freezing medium (500 µL/vial) and transfer it to a cryogenic vial.\nFreeze PDOs overnight in a -80 °C freezer using an appropriate cell freezing container and transfer them into a -150 °C freezer or liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nSubscription Required.
