    "Setup of the microscope (Video 1)Position the dissection microscope ~5 cm off the bench by placing two boxes under both sides of the dissection microscope base. Take down the illuminator from the microscope.Fix the illuminator to the surface of the bench between the two boxes using a piece of tape, and make the direction of the light source vertically towards the observer. Remove the lens of the camera and install the camera on the top of the microscope.Remove the object stage that is embedded in the base of the microscope.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Setup of the dissection microscope Preparation of pneumococcal colonies for observing colony morphologyThaw a frozen stock of pneumococcal strain ST556 in a water bath at 37 °C.Inoculate 5 ml THY medium with 50 μl of the thawed frozen stock.Incubate the culture in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for about 5 h. Check the optical density (OD) of the culture at a wavelength of 620 nm using a spectrophotometer until the culture reaches mid-log phase (OD620 = 0.4-0.6).Note: The phase-variable colonies can be formed by either bacterial cells from fresh cultures or frozen stocks. If you want to use the freshly grown culture as described in 2d to make colonies, proceed to step 2g. Mix the bacterial culture with an equal volume of 30% glycerol in THY, and store the stocks at -80 °C for future use. Thaw a frozen stock of S. pneumoniae strain ST556 in a water bath at 37 °C.Dilute the culture or thawed stock with PBS at 1:10,000 dilution to approximately 104 colony forming unit (CFU)/ml.Thaw a frozen stock of catalase working solution at room temperature.Mix 50 μl of bacterial diluted stock with 100 μl of the catalase working solution, and spread the mixture on a TSA plate.",
    "Incubate the plate in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 16 h. Note: In this protocol, we only detected the phase variation in colony opacity of pneumococcal strain ST556. Based on our previous observations (Li et al., 2016), 6 out of 8 strains showed opaque and transparent colony phenotypes at the 16-h time point, such as ST556 (serotype 19F), TH2901 (serotype 6B), and TH2835 (serotype 14). However, TIGR4 (serotype 4) and D39 (serotype 2) displayed different colony phenotypes at the 24-h time point. The incubation time of the plates should be adjusted according to the strain you use.Observation of pneumococcal colonies (Video 2)Open the lid of the plate (Procedure 2), and put the plate with its open side down on the stage of the dissection microscope. Turn on the illuminator, and use a small mirror under the stage of the microscope to reflect the light onto the plate.Adjust the intensity of the light and angle of reflected light by the mirror until you can see the colonies.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Observation of pneumococcal colonies Adjust the magnification of the microscope based on your needs.Adjust the focus of the microscope to make your field clear.Turn on the camera, and turn off the flash and automatic brightness adjustment system of the camera.Fix the angle of the mirror by holding it steadily.Photograph the colonies."
