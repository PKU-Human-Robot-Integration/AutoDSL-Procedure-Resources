    "The present study has been approved by the Committee on Animal Research and Ethics (CARE), Universiti Technologi MARA (UiTM) [Reference No: UiTM CARE 346/2021, dated 7 May 2021].\nNOTE: The published protocols22,25,26 for standard husbandry and maintenance of the 6-OHDA-lesioned adult zebrafish PD model were utilized. Experiments were conducted with adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) aged more than five months old with a standardized length of 3.2-3.7 cm.\n1. Zebrafish maintenance and pre-ICV microinjection preparations\nMaintain the fish in an aerated water tank under a controlled temperature of 28 ± 1.0 °C. For zebrafish husbandry and maintenance, use distilled water mineralized with commercial sea salt (1 g/L) throughout the experiment27.\nHouse a maximum of 25 fish per 45 L tank or one fish per 1.8 L water and expose them to a schedule of 14 h light and 10 h dark photoperiod. Feed the fish at least twice per day with food pellets supplemented with freeze-dried worms.\nPrepare a concentrated stock solution of tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) by dissolving 2.5 g of MS-222 and 5 g of sodium bicarbonate in 250 mL of distilled water. Dilute 2 mL of stock solution to produce 200 mL of working anesthesia solution.\nPrepare 99.96 mM of 6-OHDA by first dissolving 0.2 mg of ascorbic acid in 1 mL of 0.9% w/v sterile-filtered NaCl. Filter the solution with 0.2-micron filter before adding 25 mg of 6-OHDA in powder form into the solution. Prepare the solution fresh before each injection and store it in dark at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (i.e., gloves, laboratory coat, and face mask) and practice good laboratory practices when handling the chemicals. All handlings of the chemicals should be done within a biosafety cabinet.\n2. Anaesthetisation and ICV injection of zebrafish",
    "Fast the fish for 24 h to avoid regurgitation during anesthesia. Anaesthetise the fish by immersing it into a container containing 0.01% w/v of MS-222 solution for approximately 1 min or until all visible muscular movement ceases.\nPosition the anesthetized fish on a water-soaked sponge placed under a stereomicroscope and wet the fish regularly.\nIdentify the position for injection based on the intersection between the metopic suture (MS), coronal suture (CS), and sagittal suture (SS) that connects the frontal and parietal skull of the zebrafish brain.\nMake a small hole of 1.0 mm2 area using a sharp 27 G needle in the skull guided by the specific anatomical position on the zebrafish skull (Figure 1A,B).\nLower the microcapillary injector at a 60° angle until it reaches a depth of 1,200 µm from the cranial roof of the zebrafish skull (Figure 1C). Press the Z limit to fix the position.\nSet the initial injection pressure to 4000 hPa and compensation pressure to 10 hPa. Set the duration of injection to 0.3 s. Lower the intensity of injection with each subsequent injection.\nInject 0.5 µL of 99.96 mM neurotoxin 6-OHDA (or 0.9% w/v saline for sham control group) and let the microcapillary rest for 20 s. Continue to wet the fish with distilled water throughout the injection process to prevent drying out.\nSlowly remove the microcapillary and resuscitate the fish under running distilled water. Place the fish in an isolated recovery tank and remove any distractions that can potentially disturb the recovery process.\nFlush the microcapillary before the next injection to clear the blockage and ensure that the intensity of injection is sufficient to yield the desired volume of 0.5 µL of 6-OHDA.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63355/63355fig01v2.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Injection site of neurotoxin, 6-OHDA. (A) The point of microcapillary entry is guided by the intersection between the metopic suture (MS), coronal suture (CS), and sagittal suture (SS) that connects the frontal and parietal skull of the zebrafish brain (plan view). (B) A schematic drawing (plan view) of the zebrafish skull and brain shows the microcapillary, which is lowered directly above the habenula (Hab), and its point of entry at the intersection between hemispheres. (C) A schematic drawing (sagittal section) of the zebrafish brain shows the angle of injection and depth of penetration. The black dot represents the lesioned site that is situated above the targeted area, the ventral diencephalon.

Locomotor assessment\nNOTE: Locomotor assessment of zebrafish (n = six / group; sham vs lesioned) was assessed individually via the open tank test using established protocols28,29 at day three and day 30 post-6-OHDA lesion.\nVideo recording\n\t\nPlace the experimental tank (length 20 cm, width 11.5 cm, height 13 cm) with its walls covered with white paper on a raised platform (Figure 2A).\nIlluminate the tank from the bottom using a light source. Fill the tank with distilled water (80%-90% full) and maintain the temperature at 28 ± 1.0 °C. Measure the temperature using a thermometer and regulate it using a commercial aquarium heater.",
    "After a minimum of 2 min of acclimatization, record the fish swimming behavior from a plan view on the 2-dimensional (2D) plane of the experimental arena using a video camera for 5 min (Figure 2B). To avoid inconsistency in the swimming behavior of the earlier and the last batch of recordings, do not exceed the acclimatization by 10 min30.\nAnalyze the videos using video tracking software with the open-tank protocol for the acquisition of distance traveled (cm) and mean speed (cm/s) of each subject.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63355/63355fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Experimental setup of an open tank test for assessment of zebrafish locomotor behavior. (A) The experimental tank (front view) is placed on a raised platform that is illuminated from below. The four walls of the tank are covered with white paper and the recordings are captured axially. The temperature is measured using a thermometer and regulated at 28 ± 1.0 °C using a commercial aquarium heater. (B) Screenshot (plan view) of video recording that is captured using the setup.
