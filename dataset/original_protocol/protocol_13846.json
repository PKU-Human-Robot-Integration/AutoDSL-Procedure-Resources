    "The protocol described here has been approved by the National Animal Ethics Committee of Finland (protocol number ESAVI/9520/2020 and ESAVI/6421/04.10.07/2017).\n1. Experimental animals and mouse OIR model induction\nNOTE: Use time-mated animals, e.g., commonly used C57BL/6J mice, to get pups born on the same day. Use fostering dams, e.g., 129 strain (129S1/SvImJ or 129S3/SvIM) lactating dams, to nurse the pups during and after the induction of hyperoxia. Alternatively, make sure that there are extra lactating dams available in case the nursing dams need to be replaced due to exhaustion. Restrict the litter size to 6-7 pups for each dam when using C57BL/6J mice/dams (if the litters are larger than that the pups tend to have restricted weight gain)16.\nRecord the weight of the animals before and after hyperoxia induction, and at the time of sacrifice.\nMake sure that there is enough food on the bottom of the cage, so the dams have an easy access to food.\nAdd soda lime with color indicator to the bottom of the chamber to absorb excess CO2 when a filtration system is not used.\nMonitor the humidity and temperature inside the chamber and keep the humidity between 40 to 65%. Increase the humidity of the chamber, if needed, by placing dishes with water on bottom of the chamber (e.g., Petri dishes).\nCalibrate the O2 sensor with 100% O2 and normal room air.\nPlace the P7 mice into a chamber and set up the O2 level to 75%. Keep the mice in the chamber for 5 days, until P12. Avoid opening the chamber during the hyperoxia induction. Check the gas pressure of the O2 cylinder and replace the cylinder when needed. Monitor the animals during the induction.",
    "Take the mouse cages out of the chamber and weigh all the pups. Group the pups based on the weight so that each experimental group has similar weight distribution in pups.\n2. Experimental animals and rat OIR model induction (using semi-closed system)\nNOTE: Use time-mated animals to get the pups born on the same day. For rat OIR, use increased litter size, approximately 18 pups/dam, to obtain sufficient NV induction in the rat model. Pool pups from several litters to obtain enough pups to each litter.\nRecord the weight of the animals before and after induction, and at the time of sacrifice.\nMake sure that there is enough food on the bottom of the cage, so the dams have an easy access to food.\nAdd soda lime with color indicator to the bottom of the chamber to absorb excess CO2 when filtration system is not used.\nMonitor the humidity and temperature inside the chamber. Absorb extra humidity (generated from multiple number of rats) by adding silica gel on the bottom of chamber.\nCalibrate the O2 sensor with 100% N2 and normal room air.\nPlace the rats into the chamber at P0 (few hours after the birth). Set the O2 level to 50% and connect O2 cylinder to the chamber for 24 h. After that, switch the settings to 10% O2 and connect nitrogen (N2) cylinder to the chamber for 24 h. Continue the 24 h cycling between 50% and 10% O2 levels for 14 days.\nMonitor the gas consumption and the wellbeing of the animals during the study. Open the chamber during the change between 50/10% O2 and add more food and water if needed. Change the cages of the animals to clean ones during the induction.",
    "Take the rat cages out of the chamber and weigh all the pups. Group the pups based on the weight so that each experimental group has similar weigh distribution in the pups.\n3. Drug administration (optional)\nNOTE: Commonly used drug administration route in OIR is by intravitreal treatment (ivt), at P12-P14 for mice and at P14 for rats. Determine the treatment day based on the experimental setup. When multiple litters of pups are used in experiments, divide the treatment groups to have animals from all the litters. Preferably, inject the drug to only one eye, and keep the contralateral eye as a control.\nWeigh the animals and make identification marks to the tail and/or ear.\nAnesthetize the animal either with injectable anesthesia (for example mixture of ketamine and medetomidine, 30 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg for mice) or with inhalation anesthesia (isoflurane at 2-3.5% isoflurane and 200-350 mL/min air flow). Check the depth of the anesthesia by pinching the toes. Keep the animal on a heating pad during the treatment.\nFor local anesthesia, apply a drop of analgesic onto the eyelid. Open the eyelid carefully with forceps before performing the ivt, as mice and rats open their eyes around P14. Apply a drop of analgesic (e.g., oxybuprocaine hydrochloride) onto the cornea.\nApply a drop of iodine before conducting the ivt injection.\nFor the ivt injection use a glass syringe with a 33-34 G needle attached. Press the eyelids down and grap the eyeball with forceps. Make the injection posterior to the limbus, approximately in 45° angle needle pointing towards optic nerve.\nAvoid injecting more than 1.0 µL into the intravitreal space. Keep the needle in place for 30 s after injecting the drug to avoid reflux of the injected solution.",
    "Examine the eye (e.g., with an ophthalmoscope) for any complications, such as hemorrhages or retinal damage, after removing the needle. Apply antibiotic ointment on top of cornea after the injection.\n\tNOTE: The ivt injection volume for mice should be 0.5 – 1.0 µL.\nReverse the anesthesia (for example with an α2-antagonist for medetomidine (2.5 mg/kg) and return the pup to the cage. House the litter normally until the end of the study.\n4. In vivo imaging and electroretinography (optional)\nIf desired, conduct in vivo imaging on live animals during the follow-up period to record changes that develop in retina during the angiogenic responses. For example, perform fluorescein angiography (FA) or scanning laser confocal microscopy19 to visualize the vasculature (Figure 4). Use spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to visualize retinal layers in vivo (Figure 4).\nIf desired, investigate functional changes in different retinal cell populations after OIR induction by using electroretinography (ERG) (Figure 5).\n5. Tissue collection and preparation of retinal flat mounts\nNOTE: Collect the tissues according to the desired research hypothesis. For mice, collect the samples for example at P12 (to study vaso-obliteration after the hyperoxic phase) or at the hypoxic period (P13-P17). Collect the mouse OIR samples at P17, which is the most common time point for sampling, to detect the peak in NV amount. In rat OIR, collect the samples at P18-P21 to observe the highest amount of NV (Figure 3).\nWeigh the animals before sampling.\nTo label the retinal vasculature, deeply anesthetized animals can be transcardially perfused with FITC-dextran. (Alternatively, stain the retinal flat mounts with Isolectin later).\nSacrifice the animals using either overdose of anesthesia drugs (for example mixture of ketamine and medetomidine, 300 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg for mice) or CO2 inhalation.",
    "Collect the eyes of the animals by grabbing behind the eyeball with curved forceps, cut the tissue around the eyes and lift the eye out from the orbit.\nIncubate the eyeballs in freshly made, filtered 4% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) for 1-4 h. Remove the fixative and wash the eyeballs 3 x 10 min with PBS. Dissect the retinas immediately or store them in PBS at +4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed. Please read safety data sheet before working with it.\n\tNOTE: Do not apply pressure to the eyeball during the sampling or any phase of the tissue processing in order to avoid retinal detachment, if cross-sections from whole eyeballs are done.\nPrepare retinal flat mounts to quantify the amount of NV and the size of AVAs. Alternatively, process the eyeballs/retinas for histology, or RNA or protein analysis. Dissect the retina under a stereo microscope using micro scissors and forceps.\n\t\nPlace the eyeball in PBS to keep it moist and puncture the eyeball at limbus with a needle (23G) and cut around limbus with curved micro scissors to remove iris and the cornea.\nCarefully place the tip of the scissors between sclera and retina and cut sclera towards the optic nerve. Do the same to the other side of the eyeball, and carefully cut/tear the sclera until the retinal cup is exposed. Pull the lens out from the retinal cup and add PBS to the cup.",
    "Remove all the hyaloid vessels, vitreous and debris without damaging the retina. Wash the retina by adding PBS to the retinal cup. Perform four incisions (at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock) to the retina with straight micro scissors to make a flower-like structure. Optionally, make the cuts with surgical blade prior mounting the samples. Lift the retina using a soft paintbrush to a well-plate for staining.\nLabel the retinal vasculature using Isolectin B4 which stains the surface of endothelial cells (if the animals were not perfused with FITC-dextran). Incubate the retinas in blocking buffer (10% NGS + 0.5% Triton in TBS) for 1 h and wash with 1% NGS + 0.1% Triton in TBS for 10 min. Incubate the retinas with fluorescent dye conjugated Isolectin B4 (5-10µg/ml) in 1% NGS + 0.1% Triton in TBS overnight at +4 °C while protected from the light.\n\tNOTE: If desired, label other cells such as inflammatory cells and pericytes using specific antibodies.\nWash the retinas 3x for 10 min with 1% NGS + 0.1% Triton in TBS and lift retinas on a microscopic slide, inner retina facing upwards. Carefully spread out the retina using soft paintbrush and remove any remaining hyaloid vessels or debris. Add mounting medium to a cover slip and place it on top of the retina. Store retinas at +4 °C and protect from light.\n6. Analysis of the flat mounts\nTake images of the retinal flat mounts using a fluorescence microscope with 10x objective. Focus to the superficial vascular plexus and to the preretinal neovascularization. Make a tile scan image to capture the whole retina and merge the tile scans\nQuantify the images by measuring the AVAs, area of NV and total retinal area using an image processing program (see Table of Materials).",
    "Draw the AVAs and total retinal area using a free hand drawing tool and select the neovascular areas using a selection tool. The software measures the regions of interest in pixels, and the AVA and NV areas (expressed in pixels) can be used to calculate their percentage in relation to the total retinal area. Also, some software tools are available for quantifying NV.\n\t\tNOTE: Recently, an open-source, fully automated programs for the quantification of key values of OIR images using deep learning neural networks have been introduced and provide a reliable tool for reproducible quantification of retinal AVA and NV (e.g., https://github.com/uw-biomedical-ml/oir/tree/bf75f9346064f1425b8b9408ab792b1531a86c64)20,21.\nIf using antibodies for immunohistochemical detection of individual cell populations, quantify the number of stained cells (such as microglia, Figure 2B) from the retinal flat mounts by hand or by automated image analysis systems if desired.\n7. Statistics\nAnalyze normally distributed data by Student’s t test or One-Way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, as appropriate. Use nonparametric tests like Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal Wallis test for non-normally distributed data. Consider differences statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
