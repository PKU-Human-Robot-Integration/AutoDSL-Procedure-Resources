Quantification of traps will take 3 days from the seeding of cells.\nThis step explains the induction of extracellular traps by dopamine (DA) and their identification by staining with 4′, 6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody. It also explains the identification of extracellular traps in culture supernatant.\nPlate 2 × 104 BV2 cells into two well chamber slide or 2 × 105 cells in 6-well plate as needed for the experiment. Use 1 mL culture medium for two well chamber slides and 2 mL culture medium for 6-well plate. Incubate the cells 12 h–16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nCritical: Remember to keep untreated wells as experimental secondary antibody control for Immunocytochemistry (ICC). For 6-well plate only untreated well is needed as experimental control.\nTreat cells with 250 μM of dopamine dissolved in water (Stock concentration = 20 mM) and incubate for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nPerform ICC on cells in two well chamber slides for staining of extracellular traps.\nNote: This step helps in visualization of the ETs produced.\nDiscard the medium and wash the cells two times with 1 × PBS for 5 min.\nFix the cells with 500 μL 4% PFA (prepared in 1 × PBS) for 10 min at room temperature (RT; 20°C–25°C).\nCritical: Formaldehyde is hazardous. Use gloves and protective glasses while preparing.\nWash the cells two times with 1 × PBS for 5 min.\nPermeabilize cells with 500 μL of 0.1% Triton X-100 (prepared in 1 × PBS) for 15 min at RT.",
    "Block with 500 μL of 5% FBS in 0.1% Triton X-PBS (Blocking Buffer) for 1 h at 4°C in a humidified chamber.\nPause point: At this step the protocol can be paused for longer if needed. Overnight blocking (12 h) can also be done.\nAdd 500 μL of 1:250 dilution of MPO primary antibody prepared in blocking buffer in the marked chambers and incubate 12 h–16 h at 4°C in a humidified chamber.\nDiscard primary antibody and wash the cells two times with 1 × PBS for 5 min.\nCritical: Discard the supernatant in beaker containing 10% bleach. The solution should be further discarded as per the guidelines for discarding biological waste materials. Carefully tilt the chamber slides and aspirate the supernatant slowly from a corner using a pipette to avoid detachment of cells.\nAdd 500 μL of 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit secondary antibody prepared in blocking buffer in each chamber and incubate at room temperature for 1 h. From here all the steps will be performed in dark.\nDiscard secondary antibody and wash the cells two times with 1 × PBS for 5 min.\nDry the slides and mount them with VECTASHIELD mounting medium containing DAPI.\nKeep the slides at 4°C for 10 min to allow coverslips to settle properly. Slides are ready to be imaged (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/834-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. DA-induced extracellular traps in BV2 microglia\nBV2 microglia were incubated with 250 mM of DA for 24 h. ETs were stained with DAPI (blue) and MPO (Red). The images are representative of three experiments. At least 7 frames were imaged per well in a two well chamber slide. Scale bars 50 μm.\nQuantify the amount of extracellular traps present in the culture supernatant.",
    "Note: This protocol was adopted from Robledo-Avila et al., Yoo et al. and Joshi et al. with modifications (Robledo-Avila et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], Yoo et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], Joshi et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). While ICC helps in visualization of the ETs, this step helps in quantifying the amount of traps produced. This determines, in an unbiased way, whether traps production is significant or not.\nAdd 10 U/mL DNase I to media in the wells to digest the traps. Mix well and incubate at RT for 15 min.\nStop the reaction by adding 5 nM EDTA. Mix well and collect supernatants in clean microfuge tubes.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at RT to get rid of cell debris. Transfer supernatant into clean microfuge tubes. Keep them on ice until ready.\nAdd 200 μL of collected supernatant in 96-well plate.\nAdd 5 μM SYTOX Green in the wells.\nIncubate for 15 min at room temp in dark.\nMeasure fluorescence using a plate reader at excitation/emission = 485 nm/530 nm.\nNote: Blank will be the culture supernatant from untreated well without SYTOX Green.\nMechanism and functionality of the traps\nTiming: Protocol for checking dopamine induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production will take 3 days from the seeding of BV2 cells. Protocol for checking the role of ROS in generation of traps and the functionality of traps will take 4–5 days from seeding of the BV2 cells. MTT assay will take 3 days from the seeding of cells.\nThis step will determine whether the extracellular traps formation is dependent or independent of cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and actin polymerization. The step will also check the functionality of the traps by investigating their ability to tap FITC tagged Escherichia coli.\nCheck whether Dopamine induces ROS production or not.",
    "Seed 10,000 cells per well in duplicates in 96-well microtiter plate and incubate 12h–16 h at 37°C in 5% CO2\nAdd 20 μM of (2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate) DCF-DA (prepared in DMSO, Stock concentration = 2 mM) and incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nDiscard the culture media and wash cells once with 1 × PBS. Be gentle with pipetting.\nAdd 100 μL of fresh culture media to each well.\nTreat the cells with 10 mM NAC for 3 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nTreat cells with 250 μM of dopamine for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nMeasure fluorescence at excitation/emission =485 nm/Em=535 nm.\nNote: cells can also be treated with other compounds as required by the experiment and the ROS production can be measured.\nTreat the cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or cytochalasin D (CytoD) to check whether extracellular traps formation is dependent of independent of ROS or actin polymerization.\nPlate 2 × 104 BV2 cells into two well chamber slide or 2 × 105 cells in 6-well plate as needed for the experiment. Use 1 mL culture medium for two well chamber slides and 2 mL culture medium for 6-well plate. Incubate the cells 12h–16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nTreat the cells with 10 mM NAC for 3 h or 10 μM CytoD for 20 min. Incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nTreat the cells with 250 μM dopamine and incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nPerform ICC on cells in two well chamber slides for staining of the traps as explained in step 3 of induction and identification of extracellular traps section, and take images.\nIncubate the cells with FITC tagged Escherichia coli to check the functionality of the traps.",
    "Plate 2 × 104 BV2 cells into two well chamber slide or 2 × 105 cells in 6 well plate as needed for the experiment. Use 1 mL culture medium for two well chamber slides and 2 mL culture medium for 6 well plate. Incubate the cells 12h–16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nTreat the cells with 10 mM NAC for 3 h or 10 μM CytoD for 20 min. Incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nTreat the cells with 250 μM dopamine and incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3 h.\nAdd 40 μL of FITC tagged E. coli from Vybrant Phagocytosis Assay Kit to the wells and incubate for additional 21 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nAlternatives: FITC tagged E. coli can be used from any source. We used the Vybrant Phagocytosis Assay kit as it was available.\nPerform ICC on cells in two well chamber slides for staining of the traps as explained in step 3 of induction and identification of extracellular traps section, and take images.\nNote: The steps for staining with primary and secondary antibody can be skipped as the ETs will be stained with DAPI.\nPerform MTT assay to check for the cytotoxicity of dopamine. This step will help in determine whether dopamine induced trap formation are cell death dependent or independent.\nSeed 10,000 cells per well in duplicates in 96-well microtiter plate and incubate 12h–16 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nTreat the cells with 250 μM of dopamine and incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nNote: Cells can be treated with other compounds as required by the experiment.\nRemove the media carefully from the wells.\nAdd 100 μL of fresh serum free media to wells",
    "Add 10 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT (prepared in 1 × PBS) to each well.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 2 h.\nAdd 100 μL of acidic isopropanol to each well and mix properly.\nMeasure the absorbance at 570 nm using a plate reader.\nIdentification and quantification of traps in glioblastoma multiforme tissues\nTiming: The protocol will take 2 days.\nThis step will confirm the presence of extracellular traps in GBM tissues. Paraffin embedded, pathologist graded, GBM tissues are required for this step. Use tissue sections from normal brain cerebrum as reference and secondary control. The human tissue sections were prepared and section as per protocol explained by Fischer et al. (Fischer et al., 2008b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], Fischer et al., 2008a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: This protocol is adapted from Jha et al. with slight modifications (Jha et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nWash the 5 micron thick paraffin embedded tissue section slides with xylene and rehydrate slides through decreasing concentration of alcohol.\n2 washes with 100% xylene for 20 min in 2 different coplin jars.\n2 washes with 100% ethanol for 8 min in 2 different coplin jars.\n2 washes with 95% ethanol for 8 min in 2 different coplin jars.\n2 washes with 70% ethanol for 8 min in 2 different coplin jars.\n2 washes with 1 × PBS for 8 min in 2 different coplin jars.\nCritical: Follow the wash timings strictly.\nMark around the tissue using ImmEdge Hydrophobic Barrier PAP Pen.\nPermeabilize the tissue with permeabilizing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 × PBS) for 15 min at RT.\nRemove the permeabilization buffer and stain with Ricinus communis agglutinin-1 (RCA) (1:500 prepared in permeabilizing buffer) at 37°C for 1 h.\nCritical: Further steps of the protocol must be performed in dark.",
    "Block with 5% FBS in 0.1% TritonX-PBS (Blocking Buffer) for 1 h at 4°C in a humidified chamber.\nPause point: At this step the protocol can be halted if needed.
