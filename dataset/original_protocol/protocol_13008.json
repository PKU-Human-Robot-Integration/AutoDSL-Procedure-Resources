    "1. Coverslip preparation\nNOTE: For this step, one needs to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), which includes a double layer of nitrile gloves, safety glasses or face shield, and a lab coat.\nPerform piranha etching to remove organic debris from the glass.\n\tCAUTION: Piranha solution is a strong oxidizing agent that is corrosive and highly reactive when in contact with organic materials. Reaction with organic debris is exothermic and potentially explosive. Thus, the procedure must be performed in a chemical fume hood with the sash lowered. Pyrex glassware is required to handle the piranha solution.\n\t\nPrepare the workspace inside a chemical fume hood. Arrange coverslips without overlap in the bottom of a 4 L glass beaker, the \"reaction\" beaker, and place the reaction beaker on a hotplate with gentle heat. Allow the glassware to warm for 10 min. Place a \"waste\" 1 L glass beaker with 500 mL of ddH2O proximal to the reaction beaker.\nAdd 49 mL of 12 N sulfuric acid (H2SO4) slowly to the reaction beaker with a glass serological pipette. Rinse the pipette in the waste beaker before disposal.\nAdd 21 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dropwise with a glass serological pipette to the reaction beaker. Slowly distribute the H2O2 droplets evenly across the bottom of the reaction flask to prevent localized quenching of the piranha etching reaction. Rinse the pipette in the waste beaker before disposal.\n\t\tCAUTION: Always add H2O2 into the H2SO4, and never vice-versa.\nPiranha etch the coverslips for 30 min. Gently agitate the contents of the reaction beaker every 5 min.\nQuench the piranha solution by pouring the contents of the waste beaker into the reaction beaker. Transfer the liquid slowly down the wall of the reaction beaker to minimize splashing. Remove the reaction beaker from the hotplate.",
    "When the reaction is quenched and cooled, pour the piranha solution back into the waste beaker for neutralization without removing the etched coverslips from the reaction beaker.\nNeutralize the piranha solution with the gradual addition of a weak base. For example, use an excessive mass 20 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)/100 mL piranha solution.\n\t\tCAUTION: Do not store piranha solutions in sealed waste containers. The solution must always be neutralized before disposal. The neutralization reaction produces vigorous bubbles and may be explosive if not controlled by the gradual addition of the weak base.\nStir the neutralized solution with a glass stir rod and let it react for 2 h. Raise the pH to >4 and dispose of the solution.\nBetween the additions of weak base to the piranha solution, transfer the etched coverslips from the reaction beaker into a Buchner funnel with a glass stir rod and rinse for 5 min in running ddH2O.\n\t\tNOTE: Proceed immediately to the next step or store the piranha etched coverslips for up to 2 weeks in ddH2O in a sealed glass jar or Petri dish (wrap with sealing film, see Table of Materials).\nBath-sonicate the coverslips in organic solvents following the steps below.\n\t\nPlace the coverslips in a glass Coplin jar (see Table of Materials) and cover with methanol (CH3OH). Seal the lid to the jar with sealing film and bath-sonicate for 10 min. Carefully pour the methanol out of the Coplin jar into a glass storage bottle.\nFill the Coplin jar with acetone (C3H6O), seal the lid, and bath-sonicate for 10 min. Carefully pour the acetone out of the Coplin jar into a glass storage bottle.",
    "CAUTION: Methanol is flammable and acutely toxic. Use in a chemical fume hood. Acetone is flammable and an irritant. Therefore, handle with and store it in glass, and use it in a chemical fume hood. Dispose of as hazardous waste according to local regulations and guidelines.\n\t\tNOTE: Methanol and acetone can be reused up to five times each.\nActivate the coverslip surface for silane functionalization.\n\t\nBath-sonicate with 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) for 20 min. Carefully pour the KOH out of the Coplin Jar into a 50 mL conical tube for reuse.\n\t\tCAUTION: KOH is corrosive and an irritant. Use in a chemical fume hood and do not store in glass. Store it in polypropylene tubes. Dispose of as hazardous waste according to local regulations and guidelines.\n\t\tNOTE: KOH can be reused up to five times.\nRinse twice with ddH2O. Drain ddH2O from the coverslips, and then heat each coverslip by waving through the flame of a Bunsen burner to drive off all surface moisture. Place the coverslips in a dry Coplin jar.\nPerform coverslip aminosilanization.\n\t\nPrepare the aminosilane solution by mixing 69.4 mL of methanol with 3.6 mL of acetic acid (CH3COOH) in a conical flask. Add 720 µL of N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (aminosilane) and mix well (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tCAUTION: Acetic acid is flammable and corrosive. Handle with glass pipettes and store in glass. Work with acetic acid in a chemical fume hood. Aminosilane is an acutely toxic inhalation hazard, a sensitizer, and an irritant. It is harmful to aquatic life. Use in a chemical fume hood. Dispose of the chemicals as hazardous waste according to local regulations and guidelines.",
    "NOTE: Aminosilane is photosensitive and hydrolyses rapidly in water. All steps with this reagent need to be performed under minimal light conditions to retain activity. Purge the bottle with nitrogen gas and apply sealing film before storage in a dark desiccator. Replace every 6-9 months.\nImmediately add the aminosilane solution to the Coplin jar. Cover and apply the sealing film, continuing to protect from light.\nIncubate the coverslips in the aminosilane solution for 10 min in the dark at room temperature (RT). Bath-sonicate for 1 min and then incubate for another 10 min. Carefully pour the aminosilane solution into a waste container designated for CH3OH with trace aminosilane and CH3COOH.\nRinse the coverslips with methanol and pour the solution into a waste container designated for methanol.\nRinse the coverslips three times for 2 min each with ddH2O. Drain the coverslips, dab away excess moisture, and air dry completely for 10 min.\nPerform the array preparation/biotin-PEG functionalization of the coverslips.\n\t\nPrepare 1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) working stock by dissolving 84.5 mg of NaHCO3 into 1 mL of ddH2O. For final concentration of 10 mM NaHCO3, dilute 1 M NaHCO3 into ddH2O (1:100).\nDraw a grid array on the dry aminosilanized coverslips with a hydrophobic barrier pen (see Table of Materials) and wait for the ink to dry. Write an identifier on the coverslip to mark the proper orientation. Place the coverslips in a humidified chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: The array should consist of 16-20 squares, approximately 4 mm x 4 mm in size.",
    "To make the biotin-PEG succinimidyl valerate (biotin-PEG)/mPEG succinimidyl valerate (mPEG) solution, first, remove mPEG and biotin-PEG (see Table of Materials) from the freezer and equilibrate to RT. Add 153 mg of mPEG and 3.9 mg of biotin-PEG (~1:39 biotin-PEG:mPEG) to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and resuspend in 609 µL of 10 mM NaHCO3 by gentle pipetting. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min at RT to remove bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: The hydrolysis half-life of succinimidyl valerate in pH 8.5 buffer is ~30 min. After adding the buffer to mPEG, proceed with the following steps as rapidly as possible. This step is critical.\nApply the biotin-PEG/mPEG solution to completely cover each square in the coverslip arrays, typically 10-15 µL per square. Do not allow liquid to overflow the defined space. Store the coverslips in a humidity chamber in the dark for 3-4 h at RT.\nWash the coverslips with copious amounts of water by sequentially dipping them into 3x 250 mL glass beakers filled with ddH2O for 10 s each.\nDrive off all moisture from the coverslips with nitrogen gas. Store the coverslips back-to-back in a nitrogen-filled 50 mL conical tube wrapped with sealing film at -20 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: Proceed immediately to step 2 or store coverslips at -20 °C for up to 1 week before use.\n2. Preparation of SiMPull lysate\nCAUTION: The required PPE for the remaining steps of the protocol are nitrile gloves, safety glasses, and lab coats.",
    "NOTE: The lysates were prepared from the adherent CHO cells expressing EGFR-GFP. The cells were plated in a 60 mm tissue culture (TC60) dish overnight12,13. CHO cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 500 ng/mL of geneticin (see Table of Materials). Other adherent cell lines or suspension cells can also be used.\nPlate the cells following the steps below.\n\t\nWash the culture dish (containing the cells) with 1 mL of 1x PBS. Add 1 mL of 1x Trypsin and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C to detach the cells. Using a pipette, transfer the detached cells from the dish to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nTake 10 µL of trypan blue and mix with 10 µL of cell suspension in a separate centrifuge tube. Count cells using 10 µL of the cell mixture in an automatic cell counter, according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials).\nPlate 8 x 105 cells overnight in a TC60 petri dish. Plate one dish per condition.\n\t\tNOTE: For the present study, the cells were either untreated or treated with Pervanadate and EGF as described in step 2.4.1.\nPrepare the following solutions for the cell lysate preparation.\n\t\nPrepare ice-cold 1x PBS (pH 7.4).\nPrepare lysis buffer, a solution of 1% non-ionic, non-degenerating detergent (see Table of Materials) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 150 mM NaCl supplemented with Protease/Phosphatase Inhibitor (PPI) (1:100 from stock). Place tube on a nutator and allow buffer to mix for 15 min. Keep the prepared solution on ice.",
    "Prepare the Tyrode's buffer for a final concentration of 135 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 0.4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 20 mM glucose, and 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (see Table of Materials). Warm the solution to 37 °C.\nPrepare the positive control for phosphorylation - 1 mM pervanadate treatment.\n\tNOTE: This step is optional. Pervandate is the peroxidized form of vanadate-an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases16. Preventing protein dephosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase activity results in a highly phosphorylated sample.\n\t\nPrepare a 200 mM stock of activated sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4).\n\t\t\nTo prepare 100 mL solution, add 3.89 g of Na3VO4 (see Table of Materials) to 90 mL of ddH2O and dissolve while stirring. Adjust the pH to 10 by adding HCl or NaOH dropwise. Adding HCl will turn the solution yellow.\nBring volume to 100 mL with ddH2O. Boil the solution by heating it in the microwave. After boiling, the solution will be colorless.\nCool the solution to RT and readjust pH to 10. Repeat the boiling, cooling, and pH adjustment two to four more times, until the pH stabilizes at 10. Aliquot and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare a stock of 30 mM pervanadate (PV) by mixing 20.4 µL of 3% H2O2 with 100 µL of 200 mM Na3VO4 and 546.8 µL of ddH2O (equimolar concentrations of H2O2 and activated Na3VO4). Incubate in the dark at RT for 15 min.\nPrepare 1 mM PV in Tyrode's buffer. For 10 mL solution, add 0.33 mL of 30 mM PV stock to 9.67 mL of 37 °C Tyrode's buffer. Treat cells immediately.\nWash cells once with 3 mL of Tyrode's buffer. Add 3 mL of 1 mM PV in the Tyrode's buffer to the cells and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.",
    "Perform the ligand stimulation.\n\t\nStimulate cells with the ligand of interest using appropriate concentration, time, and temperature. For maximal EGFR stimulation, incubate with 1 mL of 50 nM Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF, see Table of Materials) + 1 mM of PV in Tyrode's buffer for 5 min at 37 °C.\nPerform cell lysis.\n\t\nAfter desired cell treatment, place the dish on ice and wash with ice-cold 1x PBS. Completely remove the full volume of PBS using a pipette.\nAdd 180 µL of lysis buffer (step 2.2.2) to the plate. Use a cell scraper to pull buffer around the plate to cover the cells fully. Apply firm, consistent pressure with the cell scraper across the entire cultured surface to lyse the cells fully.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume of lysis buffer needs to be kept at a minimum to ensure a high protein concentration.\nPipette the lysed cells and transfer them to a 1.5 mL tube. Keep the tube on ice for 30 min. Vortex the lysates every 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: If the POI consists of multiple subunits or is sensitive to dissociation, do not vortex the lysates.\nCentrifuge the lysed cells at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube using a pipette. This contains the total protein lysate.\nReserve 10 µL of the lysate and dilute it into 90 µL of the lysis buffer for bicinchoninic colorimetric assay (BCA) analysis17. Store the remaining total protein lysate at -80 °C.\nDetermine lysate total protein concentration using BCA analysis (see Table of Materials).\n\t\t​NOTE: Total protein lysates can be prepared on the experiment day and used fresh or stored as single-use aliquots at -80 °C for up to 12 weeks. Do not freeze/thaw.\n3. Functionalization of the array with the biotinylated antibody",
    "Prepare the following solutions.\n\t\nT50 Buffer, a solution of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl. The solution is stable for 1 month at RT.\nT50-BSA by supplementing T50 buffer with 0.1 mg/mL of BSA. Keep the prepared solution on ice.\n10 mg/mL of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in 1x PBS. Prepare this immediately before use.\n0.2 mg/mL of NeutrAvidin (see Table of Materials) in T50 buffer.\n\t\tCAUTION: NaBH4 is a reducing agent and is flammable. Always purge the container with nitrogen gas after use and store it in a desiccator.\nFunctionalize the array with the biotinylated antibody.\n\t\nRemove the PEG-biotin functionalized arrays from the freezer and equilibrate the conical tube to RT before opening. Place the coverslip with the array oriented up onto a sealing film lined 100 mm tissue culture (TC100) dish.\n\t\tNOTE: Minimize overhead lighting. All solutions should \"bead up\" on the squares defined by the hydrophobic array. Add an appropriate volume of solution to completely cover each square (typically 10-15 µL) and do not allow liquid to overflow the defined space. To rapidly remove liquids, use an in-house vacuum line attached to a vacuum flask to capture waste. Allow NaBH4 to degas for 1 h before disposal by leaving the tube open in the chemical fume hood. NaBH4 treatment is necessary to reduce background autofluorescence, thereby reducing false-positive single molecule detections.\nTreat each square of the array with 10 mg/mL of NaBH4 in 1x PBS for 4 min at RT. Wash three times with PBS.\nIncubate each square for 5 min with 0.2 mg/mL of NeutrAvidin in T50. Wash three times with T50-BSA.\n\t\tNOTE: NeutrAvidin binds to PEG-biotin and provides a binding site for biotinylated antibodies12,13,15.",
    "Incubate each square for 10 min with 2 µg/mL of biotinylated POI-specific antibody in T50-BSA; wash three times with T50-BSA.\n\t\t​NOTE: The present protocol uses biotinylated anti-EGFR IgG (see Table of Materials) to capture EGFR-GFP.\n4. SiMPull of POI from whole-cell lysates\nNOTE: Place the TC100 dish of functionalized SiMPull arrays on ice for the remainder of the SiMPull preparation. This step is the pull-down of a POI from total protein lysate. The lysate must not be reused after thawing.\nPrepare the following solutions.\n\t\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/0.1% glutaraldehyde (GA) in 1x PBS.\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA and GA are toxic chemical fixatives and potential carcinogens. Wear PPE. Dispose of the chemicals as hazardous waste according to local regulations and guidelines.\nPrepare 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4.\nThaw and mix the lysate by gently pipetting up and down. Keep on ice.\nDilute 1 µL of the lysate into 100 µL ice-cold T50-BSA/PPI.\n\tNOTE: If needed, determine the appropriate dilution factor of the total protein lysate by applying a range of dilutions to the array. The optimal density of SiMPull receptors per array area is 0.04-0.08/µm2. Lysate dilutions can be assessed in step 6 (Data analysis).\nIncubate the lysate on the array for 10 min; then wash four times with ice-cold T50-BSA/PPI.\nDilute AF647-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (see Table of Materials) in ice-cold T50-BSA/PPI and incubate on the array for 1 h.",
    "NOTE: In the present protocol, a pan anti-pTyr (PY99)-AF647 IgG is used to identify the phosphorylated population of EGFR-GFP. The use of directly labeled antibodies removes the need for secondary antibodies, increasing the labeling options and improving the consistency of the results. Fluorescently-labeled antibodies can be obtained from commercial sources. If not commercially available, antibodies can be custom labeled using standard bioconjugation techniques, and commercial bioconjugation kits are available. Each batch of fluorescently labeled antibodies needs to be tested for optimal labeling conditions by performing SiMPull to measure a dose curve and find the saturation point.\nWash six times with ice-cold T50-BSA for a total of 6-8 min.\nWash twice with ice-cold 1x PBS.\nIncubate the array with 4% PFA/0.1% GA solution for 10 min to prevent antibody dissociation.\nWash twice for 5 min each with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4/PBS to inactivate the fixatives.\n\tNOTE: For experiments using more than one antibody, (e.g., detecting multiple phosphotyrosine sites), repeat steps 4.5-4.9. See step 6.2.9 for information on determining steric hindrance between two antibodies.\n5. Image acquisition\nNOTE: Single-molecule image acquisition is performed using a 150x TIRF objective and an image splitter that captures each spectral channel in a specific quadrant of the emCCD camera (see Table of Materials). Calibration images are first acquired to allow for channel registration and camera gain calibration with a nanopatterned channel alignment grid (nanogrid) that contains 20 x 20 arrays of 200 ± 50 nm holes at an intrahole distance of 3 ± 1 µm (total size ~60 µm × 60 µm).\nPerform channel registration following the steps below.\n\tNOTE: Accurate channel registration is needed to properly calculate the colocalization of emitters. This step is critical.",
    "Clean the oil objective and deposit a drop of oil on the objective. Place the nanogrid on the stage for imaging. Using transmitted white light, focus on the grid pattern.\n\t\tNOTE: Images with the nanogrid are acquired using transmitted light, which passes through the nanogrid and is detected in all spectral channels. Alternatively, one can use multifluorescent beads that emit fluorescence detected in each channel. Image acquisition will need to be optimized according to each microscope setup.\nAcquire a series of 20 images of the grid. Ensure that pixels are not saturated. Save the image series as \"Fiducial.\"\nDefocus the nanogrid to create an Airy pattern18. Acquire a series of 20 images for gain calibrations. Save the image as \"Gain\".\nAcquire a series of 20 images for camera offset by blocking all light from going to the camera. Save the image as \"Background\".\nAcquire SiMPull images.\n\tNOTE: Before imaging the coverslip array, exchange the Tris solution for T50-BSA and equilibrate the array to RT.\n\t\nClean the oil objective and deposit additional oil on the objective. Secure the coverslip array on the microscope stage.\nOptimize each fluorophore's excitation power, TIRF angle, and camera integration time. The goal is to achieve the highest signal-to-noise while minimizing the photobleaching of the sample. Record the laser power for consistency in future measurements.\n\t\tNOTE: The present study used 300 ms exposure time for the far-red channel and 1 s for the green channel. The 642 nm laser was used at approximately 500 µW laser power, while the 488 nm laser was used at 860 µW, measured before the tube lens.",
    "Acquire images for each sample. Image the far-red channel first, followed by each lower wavelength fluorophore to reduce photobleaching. Due to the low volume used for each sample, check the buffer level every 30-45 min and replenish as needed.\n6. Data analysis\nDownload the demo codes.\n\tNOTE: The provided demo code and example data sets demonstrate the full data analysis workflow (Supplementary Coding Files 1-4). The system requirements listed in SiMPullMain.m are found in Supplementary Coding File 1.\n\t\nUnzip and Save into a personal Documents/MATLAB (MacOS/Linux) or Documents\\MATLAB (Windows) directory.\n\t\tNOTE: This generates four new folders: SiMPull_class, smite, Sample Data, Sample Analysis Outputs.\nOpen the \"ReadMe_Setup.txt\" file found in the SiMPull_class folder.\nInstall MATLAB and MATLAB Toolboxes: Curve Fitting Toolbox, Parallel Computing Toolbox, and Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox.\nInstall DipImage19 according to the download instructions.\nInstall \"smite\" single-molecule analysis package as described in ReadMe_setup.txt.\n\t\tNOTE: \"smite\" is available on the GitHub repository (see Table of Materials).\nOpen SiMPullMain.m, found in SiMPull_class folder, by dragging the file into the MATLAB window.\nChange directory to ...\\MATLAB\\Sample Data\\ by clicking on the Browse for folder icon and selecting the folder.\nOverview of data processing steps\nRun SiMPullMain.m - following instructions for each section. Execute each section individually by placing the cursor in that section and clicking the Run Section icon.\n\t\tNOTE: The general steps for data analysis are described in this section. Detailed instructions are found in the accompanying SiMPullMain.m code.\nRun the \"Initialization\" section to set the path to define spectral channels and image size.\nRun the \"Find Camera Gain and Offset\" section to convert camera gain to photons using the Gain and Background datasets.\nRun the \"Channel Registration\" section to calculate the local weighted mean transform used for image registration.",
    "Format and curate the data. Run the \"Join Sequential Channels into a Quad Image\" Section. Run \"Remove Bad Frames\".\nRun the \"Fit Single Molecules and Find Overlapping Molecules\" Section.\n\t\tNOTE: This section executes multiple functions to localize single molecules in each channel and determine colocalization events between spectral channels.\nTo determine the minimum photon count per true GFP fit, run the \"Optimize Minimum Photon Threshold\". This is an iterative process.\n\t\t\nFirst, set smf.Thresholding_MinPhotons = [0, 0, 0] and run the section. Select \"Blank Data\" files when prompted. Repeat with the \"CHO-EGFR-GFP\" files.\nSelect an appropriate minimum threshold value by comparing the two histograms. Set smf.Thresholding_MinPhotons = [475, 0, 0] and run the section again.\nRun the \"Calculate Percentage of GFP fits Positive for FR Signal\" section to correct background localizations and calculate final values.\nPerform Option 1 (step 6.2.10) or Option 2 (step 6.2.11) as per experimental need.\nOption 1: Correct for the number of receptors available at the plasma membrane for ligand binding, as described in Reference15.\n\t\t\nFirst, label surface receptors with saturating levels of fluorescent NHS Ester dye (NHS-AF647, see Table of Materials). Then perform a SiMPull experiment to determine the percentage of GFP localization that colocalizes with AF647.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This provides an estimate of the fraction of receptors available for NHS labeling and the ratio of receptors on the surface (SR).\nApply the SR correction in the final calculation: NGFP = (NLOC - NBG)*SR, where NGFP is the corrected number of GFP localizations, NBG is the background localization number, and NLOC is total localizations.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In the present example, this correction is not applied because Pervanadate is membrane permeable16 and, therefore, the action of phosphatase inhibition is not limited to surface receptors.",
    "Option 2: For multisite phosphorylation measurements, consider the potential for steric hindrance when two antibodies are used.\n\t\tNOTE: Steric hindrance may cause a reduction in the observed percentage of phosphorylated receptors for Antibody 1 when in the presence of Antibody 2 (P12), compared to Antibody 1 alone (P1).\n\t\t\nUse SiMPull to determine P1 and P12 and calculate the correction factor for steric hindrance, following previously published Reference15.\nSubscription Required.
