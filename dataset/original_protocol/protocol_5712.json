    "Extraction of small molecules from fecal samplesThe donor should collect a fresh fecal sample using a clean–not necessarily sterile–polypropylene container, store it in the fridge, and bring it to the laboratory within the next 24 h.Once the fecal sample is in the laboratory, weight the sample using a digital scale.Note: Extracts can be prepared from samples of any weight. However, in order to achieve the desired concentration for testing, we recommend a minimum sample weight of 50 g.Transfer the sample to a clean glass bottle, not sterile.Based on the weight of the sample, add 1 volume of ethyl acetate into the glass bottle containing the sample.Close the bottle tightly, wrap it with aluminum foil, and place it horizontally in an orbital shaker.Fix the bottle to the shaker using tape.Incubate it overnight at room temperature, setting the orbital shaker to 50 rotations per minute.After the incubation, remove the bottle from the shaker, place it vertically on the bench and let it stand for 5 min, so that the solid material can precipitate.Carefully remove the solvent from the bottle using a glass pipette and transfer it to a new bottle.Measure and record the volume of solvent recovered using a graduated glass cylinder.Note: It is not possible to recover the entire volume of ethyl acetate used to perform this extraction. This is due to the fact that some of the solvent will be absorbed by the fecal sample.The extract can then be stored in a -20 °C freezer (Note 1).Drying the extractTransfer the desired volume of extract to a glass boiling flask or 2-ml Safe-Lock tubes using a glass pipette or Axygen pipette tips and a micropipettor.Completely evaporate the solvent using a rotary evaporator or a Speed-Vac concentrator (Note 2).",
    "Note: Because ethyl acetate has a low boiling point and some of the bioactive molecules may be temperature-sensitive, it is not recommended to increase the temperature on the evaporator or Speed-Vac above 37 °C.Store the dried extract in the original vial (a glass boiling flask or 2-ml plastic tubes) at -20 °C (Note 1).Purification of small molecules with potential bioactivityThaw the dried extracts at room temperature.Note: Thawing the dried extract may produce some water precipitation. If this is the case, the precipitate can be dried by applying a gentle stream of nitrogen gas into the flask or tube.Add 1 volume of 25% methanol (in water) to the vial(s) containing the dried extract.Scrape the walls of the vial with a glass pipette or a pipette tip, pipetting up and down and thoroughly vortexing the vials periodically.Take the desired number of C18 cartridges and, using a syringe, apply 2 ml of methanol through each cartridge.Using a syringe, apply 2 ml of water through each cartridge.Apply a maximum of 5 ml of extract through each column.Collect the flow-through using a conical tube.Wash each column with 4 ml of distilled water. Elute the molecules bound to the resin using 2 ml of solutions of increasing methanol concentrations–concentrations should be determined by the user, we suggest using 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100% methanol (in water).Collect each fraction using a conical or Safe-Lock tube.Completely evaporate the solvent using a Speed-Vac concentrator.Save fractions in a -20 °C freezer until testing (Note 1).Preparing culture medium containing the desired extractThe desired extracts or fractions obtained above should be removed from the freezer and LB broth should be added to the tubes–the volume added will vary, but we recommend starting with the same volume of culture medium as the volume of solvent evaporated (1x concentration).",
    "Scrape the walls of the tubes with a glass pipette or a pipette tip, pipetting up and down and thoroughly vortexing the tubes periodically.Note: Some samples will not solubilize completely. Due to the nature of the solvents used, some extracts will have a high fat content. In some cases, a significant amount of the material will either stick to the tube wall or form insoluble flakes in the culture medium.Filter the culture medium using a syringe and a 0.22-µm-pore filter to remove debris and any insolubilized material.Measure the pH of the solution.Adjust the pH to approximately 7.3 using HCl or NaOH. Add streptomycin to achieve a final concentration of 100 µg/ml.Filter-sterilize the solution using a syringe and a 0.22-µm-pore filter.Save the medium at room temperature until used (for storage times longer than 48 h we recommend storing the medium in a 4 °C fridge) (Note 1).Testing the effect of small molecules from the fecal metabolome on bacterial growthUsing an inoculation loop, take a small amount of bacterial culture from a frozen stock of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 and streak a plate of LB containing 100 µg/ml of streptomycin.Note: SL1344 can be obtained from the National Collection of Type Cultures, Public Health England, at https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/collections/nctc.aspx[href=https://www.phe-culturecollections.org.uk/collections/nctc.aspx].Incubate overnight at 37 °C.Using an inoculation loop, take a single colony of Salmonella and transfer it to approximately 2 ml of LB broth containing 100 µg/ml of streptomycin, in 16 x 100 mm borosilicate tubes.Incubate it overnight at 37 °C with shaking (225 RPM).Dilute the culture 1:10 using phosphate-buffered saline.Measure the optical density of the suspension and multiply the value obtained by 10 to achieve the optical density of the original suspension.",
    "Calculate the volume of culture required to inoculate 8 ml of culture medium and achieve a starting optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.05.Inoculate the desired number of 16 x 100 mm borosilicate tubes containing 8 ml of either LB broth or LB broth to which the fecal extract had been added, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin.Note: If previously stored at 4 °C, culture medium should be equilibrated to room temperature before inoculation with Salmonella.Incubate at 37 °C with shaking (225 RPM).Every 30 min, remove a small aliquot from each of the cultures and use it to measure and record the OD600 of the cultures.Note: After the initial time points, the cultures will need to be diluted in phosphate-buffered saline before measurements can be made. This should be done to make sure that the optical density values obtained fall within the linear range of the equipment. Please be mindful of the linear range of your specific spectrophotometer.Using GraphPad Prism, plot the values obtained in a curve where the y-axis represents the optical density values and the x-axis represents the time of incubation.Compare the curves to evaluate if the extract has any effect on bacterial growth–statistical analyses can be performed within GraphPad Prism.Testing the effect of small molecules present in the extract on bacterial gene expressionPrepare a growth curve experiment exactly as described above, using either LB or LB containing a fecal extract–the number of replicates per condition can vary, but we recommend a minimum of 4 replicates per condition.Based on the growth curve previously performed using the same fecal extract, grow the cultures to the desired growth stage–we suggest that the cultures used for RNA extraction be in the exponential growth phase.",
    "Collect between 1-2 ml of each culture and transfer to a conical tube containing 2-4 ml (2 volumes) of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent.Manually invert tubes 5 times to mix.Let it stand for 5 min at room temperature.Centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Note: At this stage, the pellet can be stored at -80 °C and the extraction can continue in the next few days.Extract RNA using the RNeasy Mini Kit, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, using protocol 4 of the RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent Handbook (version 01/2015)[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180403/EN RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent Handbook.pdf].Continue the extraction procedure using protocol 7 of the RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent Handbook (version 01/2015)[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180403/EN RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent Handbook.pdf], including the on-column DNAse treatment.Determine the amount and concentration of the RNA obtained using a UV spectrophotometer.Test the samples for the presence of contaminant genomic DNA by polymerase chain reactions (PCR):Perform a regular PCR using Taq Polymerase and primers targeting the desired gene–we recommend using the housekeeping gene gapA (forward: GGCGCTAACTTTGACAAATACGAAGG, reverse: AGTCATCAGACCTTCGATGATGCCG; Peixoto et al., 2017).Use 1 ng of genomic DNA from Salmonella as a positive control and 100 ng of the RNA extracted for testing.Run the PCR products on a 1.5% agarose gel.Note: Stain the gel using your preferred method of nucleic acid staining.Observe the bands under UV light–the presence of a band of the expected size in the positive control and the absence of such band on the RNA samples tested indicates that no significant DNA contamination exists.Note: RNA should be stored at -80 °C while the presence of DNA in the samples is being tested.Synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) using between 500-1,000 ng of RNA and the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.Purify the cDNA using the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.Quantify the cDNA using a UV spectrophotometer.",
    "Dilute the cDNA so that all samples are at a concentration of 5-10 ng/µl.Perform Real-Time PCR using 1 ng of the cDNA as template, primers targeting the desired genes, and the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix.Determine the relative expression levels between samples grown in the absence or presence of the fecal extract using the ΔΔCt method, and the gapA gene as the housekeeping control."
