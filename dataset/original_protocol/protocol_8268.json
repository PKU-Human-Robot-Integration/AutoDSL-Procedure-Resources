    "All vertebrate animal work was approved by the Committee on the Use and Care of Animals at the University of Michigan (protocol # PRO00007096). Experiments are carefully planned to minimize the number of animals sacrificed. Pregnant female wild-type (WT), non-transgenic Long Evans rats (Rattus norvegicus) are housed singly in chambers equipped with environmental enrichment, and cared for by the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (ULAM) at the University of Michigan, in accordance with the NIH-supported Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All rats were kept in routine housing for as little time as possible prior to euthanasia, consistent with the recommendations of the Guidelines on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association and the University of Michigan Methods of Euthanasia by Species Guidelines.\n1. Material Preparation\nDissect cortical neurons from embryonic day 19–20 rat pups and culture rat cortical neurons at 0.5 x 106 cells per milliliter on poly-D-lysine coated plates for 4 days in vitro, as described previously13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\nPrepare the plasmid DNA of interest following the steps outlined by an endotoxin-free plasmid DNA isolation kit (see Table of Materials). Quantify the resultant DNA using a spectrophotometer.\nOn in vitro day 4 (DIV4), aliquot, filter sterilize, and incubate the following media at 37 °C: 6 mL reduced serum media (RSM; e.g., OptiMEM), 25 mL neuronal basal media (NBM), 40 mL NBKY (NBM + 1 mM kynurenic acid + 10 mM MgCl2, adjusted to a pH of 7.4), 10 mL NBC (NBM + 1x neuronal cell culture supplement + 1x L-glutamine supplement + 1x Pen Strep).\nNOTE: Volumes listed are sufficient for transfecting one 96-well plate. Refer to the Table of Materials for specific reagents.\n2. Transfection of Rat Cortical Neurons",
    "Modify the provided Example transfection sheet (see Supplemental File 1) by adjusting the plate type, plate map, number of DNAs, DNA concentration, and number of wells (green boxes).\nNOTE: The total DNA sums to 0.2 µg per well, regardless of whether one (e.g., DNA A) or multiple (e.g., DNA B and C) DNA constructs are added to each well.\nWorking from the spreadsheet, combine the appropriate amount of RSM and DNA in one tube. Combine the appropriate amount of RSM and transfection reagent (e.g., Lipofectamine) in a separate tube.\nIncubate at room temperature (RT) for 5 min.\nCombine the DNA and transfection reagent RSM mixtures and incubate at RT for 20 min.\nDuring this incubation step, use a multichannel pipette and sterile plastic troughs to wash cells 2x with 100 µL per well of NBM. Reserve the conditioned media (CM) and store at 37 °C. For this and following steps, take care to minimize the amount of time neurons are exposed to air.\nRemove the NBM media and replace with 100 µL per well of NBKY.\nAfter 20 min have passed, add 50 µL of the transfection reagent/DNA mixture dropwise to each well.\nIncubate cells with the transfection reagent/DNA complexes for 20 min at 37 °C.\nRinse 2x with NBKY and replace with 100 µL of CM and 100 µL of NBC per well.\nSuccessfully transfected cells should be visible by fluorescence microscopy within 16–24 h of transfection. To gauge efficiency, use a fluorescent microscope to check the transfection after overnight incubation at 37 °C.\nNOTE: This technique results in an overall transfection efficiency of 5 to 10%.\n3. Imaging",
    "Place the plate on a fluorescent microscope with a motorized stage, and establish a fiduciary (e.g., a mark on the bottom of the plate) that will allow the user to align the plate each time it is imaged. Save an image of this fiduciary for reference.\nNavigate to a field of interest and note the x-y coordinates relative to the fiduciary.\nFocus on transfected cells expressing a fluorescent label.\nTake fluorescent images in the appropriate channel or channels (e.g., red fluorescent protein [RFP], green fluorescent protein [GFP], 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI]), either manually or in an automated manner. By taking several images at regularly-spaced intervals, a montage of the well can be assembled during image processing (see step 4).\nNOTE: The spacing depends on several factors, including magnification, the optics of the microscope, and the detector size. In general, the optical spacing between adjacent images will be between 90–95% of the size of each individual image, to allow for a small degree of image overlap and feature alignment.\nRepeat this process as often as required, aligning to the original fiduciary each time. For survival analysis, imaging takes place every 6–24 h, depending on the cell type and the purpose of the experiment.\n4. Image Processing\nNOTE: Following image acquisition, a series of processing steps are required prior to image analysis. These include, but are not limited to, stitching, stacking, and background subtraction (Figure 1). The goal of these steps is to produce an image stack, or time series, in which cells are clearly discernible from their background and easy to follow over multiple time points. A dedicated FIJI macro (Image_Processing.ijm, see Supplemental File 2), performs basic stitching, stacking, and background subtraction. An explanation of each step and the parameters to consider when performing image processing is provided in the discussion section.",
    "Adjust the raw data or input directory to match the formatting shown in Figure 2.\nIf time points are not contiguous (i.e., T1, T2, T3), rename these folders so that they are. This step is critical to ensure that the Image_Processing macro does not crash during stacking.\nDouble-click on the Fiji icon to open the program, then click and drag the Image_Processing macro onto the Fiji bar. This will open the macro within Fiji.\nAdjust lines 2-7 of the Image_Processing macro to specify the input directory containing images, the desired output directory for stitched and stacked images, the number of imaging timepoints, number of fluorescent channels and plate format.\nDetermine the order in which the images were acquired. To test this, manually stitch a montage of images in FIJI by maneuvering to the Plugins drop down menu | Stitching | Grid/Collection stitching. Adjust the settings within the dropdown menus Type and Order until an accurately stitched image is produced.\nAdjust the GRID_TYPE and STITCH_ORDER variables in lines 8 and 9 of the Image_Processing macro to match these selections.\nSpecify the number of images per well by adjusting line 10 in the Image_Processing macro.\nNOTE: For a 2 x 2 montage of images, this line would read DIM = 2.\nIf background subtraction is required, adjust line 14 in the Image_Processing macro to BGSUB = true.\nSet the rolling ball radius by adjusting line 15 in the Image_Processing macro.\nNOTE: For optimal results, set the radius to at least the diameter of the largest foreground object in the image.\nClick Run to start the Image_Processing macro. Once started, Image_Processing will automatically advance through stitching, stacking, and background subtraction.\n5. Scoring Cell Death\nNOTE: See the Discussion section for more information on scoring cell death and censoring data.",
    "Locate the image stacks produced by the Image_Processing script. Open these in FIJI.\nUse the point tool within FIJI to individually label each cell with a number. Pressing t after each point will add the cell identifier to the ROI (region-of-interest) Manager.\nNOTE: The identifiers can be visualized by clicking the labels and show all checkboxes in the ROI Manager.\nProgress through the timepoints in each image stack and record the timepoint when each cell either dies or needs to be censored in the file Survival_spreadsheet.csv (see Supplemental File 3).\nEach cell occupies a single row in the spreadsheet, where a unique identifier (ID) for each cell consists of its corresponding well and ROI number within that well. tp_death is the last time point a cell is observed to be alive, while time_death represents the actual time of death in hours. For each cell, input these data. It is critical to maintain this structure for subsequent analysis using survival.R (see Supplemental File 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The criteria for determining cell death are crucial and may vary depending on cell type. Three main criteria are used in the identification of dead neurons11,20 (Figure 3): loss of fluorescence intensity (e.g., Neuron 1 at 69 h), rounding of the cell body (e.g., Neuron 2 at 188 h), and the loss of neurite integrity or blebbing (e.g., Neuron 2 at 188 h).\nRecord the censor status of the cell in the last column.\nNOTE: Here, due to the peculiar way censoring is handled by R, censored cells are marked by 0, while uncensored cells are marked by 1. Note that all cells that live to the last time point are censored, and therefore marked as 0.\n6. Performing Cox Proportional Hazards Analysis and Visualizing Results\nIf necessary, download R studio at https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html.",
    "Open R studio and double-click the icon for the survival.R script.\nPlace the cursor on line 2 of survival.R and click the run button in the main R studio window in order to load the survival library.\nChange line 5 of the survival.R script to match the location of the file Survival_spreadsheet.csv. Click on run to load the survival data as a dataframe.\nHighlight lines 8 and 9 and click the run button in the R studio console window in order to perform Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results and output statistics appear in the console window of R studio.\nHighlight lines 12-16 of survival.R and hit the run button in order to produce a cumulative risk of death plot, which will appear in the plots tab in R studio. This file can be saved by clicking on the export button above the plot.\nIf it is desirable to plot the survival data as a Kaplan-Meier curve, highlight lines 19-24 of survival.R and hit the run button.\nSubscription Required.
