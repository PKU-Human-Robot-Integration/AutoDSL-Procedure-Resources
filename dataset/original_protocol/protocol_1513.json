    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSelection of query strains mated to the yeast deletion library\nTiming: 3 weeks\nNote: Keeping the environment as sterile as possible at the bench is critical. Pinning steps leave plates vulnerable to contaminations.\nFreshly grow the query strains IRE1 (YGT1228) and IRE1ΔLD (YGT1202) from frozen glycerol stocks.\nStreak out the query strains on YPD agar plates containing 200 μg/mL Hyg and incubate at 30°C for 2–3 days.\nInoculate a single colony into 5 mL of YPD liquid medium. Incubate at 30°C for 2 days using a culture rotator (40 rpm).\nPrepare the query strain lawns to start the screen.\nUsing a spreader, evenly spread 800 μL of each saturated liquid culture onto a single-well YPD agar plate.\nRepeat and prepare a total of thirteen query strain lawns for a genome-wide screen with thirteen condensed 384-density format deletion arrays.\nAllow the lawns to dry and incubate at 30°C for 2 days.\nNote: Perform both IRE1 and IRE1ΔLD query strain screens in parallel for fair comparison of downstream data.\nMate query strains with the gene deletion arrays (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1054-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Reporter-synthetic genetic array functional genomic screen for UPR activation\n(A) A MATα query strain containing either one of the two integrated recombinant UPR sensors selectable by Hygromycin (Hyg) due to the dominant HygR selectable marker. The query strain also possesses a MATa-specific reporter (can1Δ::STE2pr-Sp_his5), a recessive marker (lyp1Δ) to counter-select diploid population, and the UPR reporter with auxotrophic markers MET15 and URA3. Each yeast strain of the MATa array inoculated from the yeast deletion library contains a single gene deletion replaced by the dominant KanR selectable marker. The query strain is mated to the array strains on YPD agar plates.",
    "(B) Successfully mated strains yield heterozygous diploid with HygR and KanR phenotype that grow on YPD agar plates containing Hyg and G418.\n(C) Sporulation of the diploid strains occur upon transfer onto the enriched sporulation agar plates, resulting in the formation of haploid meiotic progeny.\n(D) Selection of the MATa meiotic haploid progeny on SD-His/Arg/Lys/Ura/Met agar plates containing canavanine/thialysine.\n(E) KanR meiotic haploid progeny selection on SDMSG-His/Arg/Lys/Ura/Met agar plates containing canavanine/thialysine/G418.\n(F) KanR (xxxΔ) and HygR (IRE1 or IRE1ΔLD) haploids are selected with the same media as in (E) with the additional supplementation of Hyg (SDMSG-His/Arg/Lys/Ura/Met containing canavanine/thialysine/G418/Hyg).\nPin the query strain (MATα, HygR) from the lawn onto fresh single-well YPD agar plates using the 384 Solid Pin Multi-Blot Replicator.\nPin the 384-density deletion library (MATa, KanR) on top of the query strain.\nIncubate at ∼22°C for 1 day.\nSelect for diploids by pinning the colonies onto single-well YPD agar plates containing G418/Hyg. Incubate the plates 2 days at 30°C.\nSporulate the selected diploids by pinning the colonies onto single-well enriched sporulation agar plates. Incubate 7 days at 22°C.\nSelect for MATa meiotic haploid progenies by pinning the spores onto single-well SD-His/Arg/Lys/Ura/Met agar plates containing canavanine/thialysine. Incubate at 2 days at 30°C.\nSelect for MATa, KanR meiotic haploid progenies by pinning the spores onto single-well SDMSG-His/Arg/Lys/Ura/Met agar plates containing canavanine/thialysine/G418 solid medium. Incubate 2 days at 30°C.\nSelect for MATa, KanR, HygR meiotic haploid progenies by pinning the haploids onto single-well SDMSG-His/Arg/Lys/Ura/Met agar plates containing canavanine/thialysine/G418/Hyg. Incubate at 2 days at 30°C.\nNote: The resulting selected progenies will contain either IRE1 or IRE1ΔLD, marked by HygR, and a KanR cassette that replace a non-essential gene.\nNote: Ammonium sulfate interferes with G418 selection. It is replaced with monosodium glutamic acid (MSG) at steps 6 and 7.",
    "Measurement of reporter fluorescence levels by flow cytometry\nTiming: 2 days\nPreparation of cell cultures for flow cytometry\nInoculate the selected haploid progenies from the 384-density format arrays into four 96 well plates using the 96 Floating E-Clip style Pin Multi-Blot Replicator. Each well should be prefilled with 200 μL of YPD liquid media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nGrow 12–16 h at 30°C to allow cell cultures to reach saturation.\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, dilute the cell cultures to a density of 0.05 OD/mL while maintaining the 200 μL volume in each well.\nIncubate the diluted cells 4.5 h at 30°C.\nCritical: The absorbance at 600 nm should not exceed 0.4 OD/mL to prevent UPR activation in these cells.\nMeasure the fluorescence levels of GFP and mCherry reporters from each well with an automated high-throughput sampler (HTS) connected to the LSRFortessa X-20.\nIt is important to resuspend the cells with a multi-channel pipette before reading with the flow cytometer to prevent clogging of the instrument.\nAcquire cells at low speed.\nExcite GFP and mCherry at 488 and 561 nm and collect through a 505 and 595 nm long-pass filter and a 530/30 and 610/20 band pass filter, respectively.\nOne 96-well plate is read within 5 min, with a read of 10,000 cells per well.\nUse the software FACSDiVA v 8.0 to acquire data in .fcs file format. Read files with the software FlowJo 10.8.0 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1054-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Typical flow cytometry gating workflow to quantify UPR activity",
    "(A) Density plot of the recorded events was gated (gate 1, left panel) to include most intact or viable cells but not ruptured or dead cells. This population was then replotted in another density plot (right panel) where the sequential gate 2 was defined to isolate single cells. Only the gate 2 subpopulation was included in the subsequent fluorescence quantification.\n(B) Overlay histograms displaying the fluorescent activity of the constitutive reporter mCherry (left panel) and the inducible UPR reporter GFP (right panel) in the gate 2 subpopulation of IRE1 query strain. In this example, the blue population was treated with DMSO (carrier) and red population with the UPR inducer, DTT, respectively. The median of the GFP was normalized to the median of mCherry to determine the relative UPR activity.\nNote: The potent UPR inducer gene deletion opi3Δ strain and wild-type (WT) strains are included in each 96 well plate. Typically, each library microplates contain at least 2 empty wells that were used to include positive (opi3Δ) and negative (WT) controls. OPI3 deletion was selected because it causes high UPR by lipid bilayer stress in both query strains IRE1 and IRE1ΔLD (Ho et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nData analysis\nTiming: 1 day\nNormalizing the GFP fluorescence levels using Microsoft Excel.\nCalculate the GFP/mCherry ratio signal for each mutant (m) strain (GFPm/mCherrym).\nCalculate the median of GFP/mCherry ratio signal for each plate (GFPmedian/mCherrymedian)\nCalculate the UPR reporter level of each mutant strain (Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1])",

Validation of positive hits from the screens\n(A and B) Typical validation of positive hits by flow cytometry. The reporter-synthetic genetic array mutants carrying single deletion of SCJ1 and SPC2, respectively, were passed through the flow cytometer. Indicated by the GFP gate, disruption of SCJ1 resulted in strong UPR activation in both query strains IRE1 and IRE1ΔLD (top left panel), whereas disruption of SPC2 weakly induced the UPR in both of the query strains (middle left panel). The signal of the reference reporter mCherry was consistent across the samples’ right panels. The data was analyzed using the same strategy as described in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].",
    "(C and D) Typical validation of positive hits by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The same reporter-synthetic genetic array mutants from Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A were validated by confocal microscopy. A strong cytosolic expression of GFP was observed in the scj1Δ mutants and a relatively weaker GFP signal was observed in the spc2Δ mutants. Scale bar: 10 μm.\nPlace cells on slides coated with 1 mg/mL ConA mounted onto Attofluor cell chambers.
