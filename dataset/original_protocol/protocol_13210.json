    "The protocol demonstrated a clinical protocol for conduction of SGUS and the demonstration of scanning is performed on a de-identified healthy volunteer. Ethical approval is not required as the study is beyond the common rule and FDA definition of human research subject. Verbal consent from patients was obtained for taking clinical photos and their publication.\n1. Transducer and machine settings\nSelect a high-frequency linear transducer of 10 MHz (see the Table of Materials).\nSet to B mode.\nUse the highest frequency of the probe.\nAdjust the depth (3 cm) and gain (50%-60%).\n\tNOTE: The depth is usually 1 cm deeper than the target structure. Auto-gain function is available for some ultrasound consoles.\nFor a right-handed examiner, place the ultrasound machine next to the patient's right shoulder.\n2. Patient preparation\nPosition the patient in the supine position with the neck slightly extended. Use a pillow to support the patient's head.\nRemove any clothing or jewelry around the neck that may obstruct the ultrasound transducer.\n3. Scanning of the thyroid gland\nOrient the probe with the marker pointing towards the patient's right side for transverse images. For longitudinal scanning, orient the marker at the cephalic side.\nApply gel to the probe surface.\nPlace the probe below the thyroid cartilage for scanning of the thyroid gland. The right and left lobes of the thyroid gland are connected by the isthmus. Save the images and take the echogenicity of the thyroid gland as a reference (Figure 1).\nIf there is concomitant thyroid disease, compare the echogenicity to that of the surrounding muscles. Normal salivary glands are usually more echogenic than muscle.\n4. Scanning of the parotid gland\nTurn the patient's head to the opposite side of the gland being examined.",
    "Place the transducer longitudinally along the anterior border of the parotid gland, just anterior to the ear and parallel to the tragus, moving from the superior to the inferior pole of the gland (Figure 2).\nPlace the probe transversely at the angle of the mandible to obtain the transverse scan. Ideally, the parotid gland is located between the mastoid and mandible ramus in transverse view. Scan the parotid gland transversely from the superior to the inferior pole (Figure 3).\nSlide the probe below the ramus of the mandible to visualize the deep part of the parotid gland, which could be partially obscured by the mandible. Place the probe between the mastoid process and the angle of the mandible.\nSave and label the images in both the longitudinal and transverse views.\nAssess the size of the parotid gland.\nCompare the echogenicity with that of the thyroid gland. The echogenicity of the normal parotid gland is similar to that of the thyroid gland.\nThe retromandibular vein and external carotid artery divide the superficial and deep parotid lobes. Turn on the color doppler to differentiate blood vessels from the dilated intraglandular duct.\nCapture the degree of inhomogeneity, the clearness of the gland margin, and the presence of hypo-/an-echoic areas within the glands.\nNote the presence of focal lesions and document the size, location, shape, and echogenicity. Turn on the color doppler to look for vascularity.\nScore the degree of sonographic involvement on a scale of 0-3 as defined: Grade 0: normal, homogenous parenchyma; grade 1: mild inhomogeneity without hypo-/an-echoic areas; grade 2: moderate inhomogeneity with the presence of scattered hypo-/an-echoic areas; grade 3: Diffuse inhomogeneity with the presence of hypo-/an-echoic areas in the entire gland4.",
    "The presence of lymph nodes within the parotid gland could be normal and common, especially when located in the superficial lobe. Measure the diameter of the lymph nodes. Evaluate the shape, echogenicity, and preservation of fatty hilum.\nRepeat the scanning at the contralateral parotid gland. Compare the size and echotexture between the two parotid glands.\n5. Scanning of the submandibular gland\nPosition the patient in the supine position with the head maximally tilted to the back.\nTo obtain the transverse view of the submandibular gland, position the transducer just below the angle of the mandible at the submandibular area, which is bounded by the mandible, mylohyoid muscles, and the anterior belly of the digastric muscles. Examine the entire submandibular gland from anterior to posterior (Figure 4).\nObtain the longitudinal view by placing the probe medial to the horizontal body of the mandible. Visualize the facial artery in this plane (Figure 5).\nSave and label the images in both transverse and longitudinal views of the submandibular gland.\nAssess the size of the submandibular gland.\nExamine the echogenicity of the submandibular gland, which is usually less echogenic than the parotid gland.\nAssess the degree of inhomogeneity, the clearness of the gland margin, and the presence of hypo-/an-echoic areas within the glands. Note the presence of focal lesions.\nGrade the degree of inhomogeneity using the OMERACT score: Grade 0: normal parenchyma; Grade 1: minimal change with mild inhomogeneity without hypo-/an-echoic areas; Grade 2: moderate change with moderate inhomogeneity with focal hypo-/an-echoic areas; Grade 3: severe change with diffuse inhomogeneity with hypo-/an-echoic areas occupying all the surface of the gland. If the evaluation of the gland is not possible due to qualitative parameters, the fatty gland refers to grade 1, and the fibrous gland indistinguishable from adjacent tissue corresponds to grade 34.",
    "Measure the size of the submandibular lymph nodes. Evaluate the shape, echogenicity, and preservation of fatty hilum.\nRepeat the scanning at the contralateral submandibular gland. Compare the size and echotexture between the two submandibular glands.\n6. Documentation\nDocument the sonographic involvement on a scale of 0-3 at all four major salivary glands. A Score of â‰¥2 at any gland is considered compatible with SS.\nDocument the presence of lymph nodes if any. Record the diameter, shape, and whether fatty hilum is preserved.\nDocument the presence of focal abnormalities if any.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
