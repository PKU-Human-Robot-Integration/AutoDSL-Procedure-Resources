    "1. Fabrication of devices and preparation of reagents\nFabrication of stainless-steel module\n\t\nFabricate the stainless-steel module from a grade 316 stainless-steel using a CNC milling machine according to the engineering drawing provided (Figure 1).\n3D printing of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold\n\t\nPrepare a 3D computer aided design (CAD) model of the PDMS mold using SolidWorks according to the engineering drawing provided (Figure 2).\nExport the CAD model to an STL file and import the STL file to Cura 2.6.2.\nSlice the model into layers with a print speed of 50 mm/s and infill density of 60%.\nExport the file as a G-code and upload it to an Ultimaker2 3D printer for printing. Use polylactic acid (PLA) as the printing material.\nCasting of PDMS ring\n\t\nMix the PDMS base and curing agent (both from a silicone elastomer kit) with the ratio of 90.9% base and 9.1% curing agent.\nPour approximately 2.6 mL of the well-mixed solution into the 3D printed mold.\nRemove bubbles in a vacuum degassing chamber.\nCure it for 1 h in an 80 °C furnace.\nAllow the PDMS ring to cool to room temperature, then remove the cured PDMS ring carefully from the mold. The engineering drawing of PDMS ring is shown in Figure 3.\nPreparation of 1% Pluronic F-127\n\t\nWeigh out 5 g of Pluronic F-127, pour it into a glass bottle, then add 100 mL of sterile water into the glass bottle. This gives a 5% Pluronic F-127 solution.\nEnsure that all Pluronic F-127 powder is submerged in the water, close the cap and autoclave it using a liquid sterilisation cycle program.\nAfter autoclave, let the solution cool to room temperature before use.",
    "Add 10 mL of 5% Pluronic F-127 solution to 40 mL of autoclaved sterile water to make 1% Pluronic F-127 solution. Perform the dilution in a biosafety cabinet (BSC) hood.\nStore both 1% and 5% Pluronic F-127 at room temperature.\nPreparation of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)\n\t\nAdd 800 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a glass beaker and heat it to 60 °C whilst stirring (keep stirring from step 1.5.1 to 1.5.5).\nWeigh 40 g of PFA powder and add it to the warm PBS solution.\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is hazardous, perform steps 1.5.2 to 1.5.6 in a fume hood.\nAdd 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) slowly dropwise into the PFA solution until the solutions turns clear.\nAdjust the pH of the PFA solution to approximately 7.4 with 1 M of hydrochloric acid (HCl).\nTop up the solution to 1 L with 1X PBS. This gives 1 L of 4% PFA.\nFilter the PFA solution with 0.2 µm filters to remove any particulates, aliquot and freeze in a -20 °C freezer.\nPreparation of 0.1% Triton-X\n\t\nAdd 50 µL of pure Triton-X into 50 mL of PBS to make 0.1% Triton-X solution.\nPreparation of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)\n\t\nWeigh 0.5 g of BSA, pour it into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and then add 50 mL of PBS into the tube.\nLet it roll for 1 h at room temperature on a roller to dissolve.\nStore 1% BSA at 4 °C for up to two weeks.\n2. Coating of a 6-well plate\nAutoclave stainless-steel module, PDMS ring, and tweezers before use. Perform all the subsequent procedures in a BSC hood and observe aseptic techniques to ensure sterility.",
    "Place the PDMS ring in a 6-well using tweezers. Use the external rim of the PDMS ring to align the PDMS ring concentrically with the well.\n\tNOTE: Only non-tissue culture treated well plates should be used.\nPlace the stainless-steel module on top of the PDMS ring using tweezers.\nInsert the tips of the internal retaining ring pliers into the grip holes of the retaining ring, squeeze the holder to reduce the diameter of the retaining ring. Fit it into the 6-well, press it firmly on the stainless-steel module and release the pliers to secure the PDMS ring in the well.\nAdd 1 mL of 5 µg/mL fibronectin into the center or the edge of the well (depending on the region of interest) through the opening of PDMS ring and stainless-steel module.\nSwirl the plate to ensure that the fibronectin solution covers all the region of interest.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 95% air/5% CO2.\nRemove the fibronectin solution from the well and wash twice with PBS. Completely remove the PBS from the well.\nRemove the retaining ring, stainless-steel module, and PDMS ring from the well.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 1% Pluronic F-127 into the center or the edge of the well (uncoated surface) and incubate for 1 h at room temperature to passivate the uncoated surface.\nRemove the Pluronic F-127 solution from the well and wash three times with PBS.\nUse the coated well immediately or store it at 4 °C for up to two weeks with a layer of PBS in the coated well.\n3. Seeding of HUVECs\nUse HUVECs below passage 5 in the experiment.\nRemove all culture medium and wash cells once with PBS.",
    "Add 3 mL of 0.05% trypsin and incubate for 3 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 95% air/5% CO2. Gently tap the flask to dislodge the cells.\n\tNOTE: This protocol has been tested using HUVECs and the concentration of trypsin and its incubation time may be different for other type of ECs.\nTransfer the solution to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and neutralize the trypsin using 6 mL of culture medium (e.g., Lonza EGM-2) prewarmed to 37 °C.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min. Remove the neutralized trypsin solution and resuspend cells with 1 mL of prewarmed culture medium.\nCount the cells using a haemocytometer and seed 180k cells into a coated 6-well plate in 1.5 mL of prewarmed culture medium.\nShake the well plate laterally to ensure that the cells distribute evenly in the well.\nLeave it in a 37 °C humidified incubator under 95% air/5% CO2 overnight.\nRemove the unattached cells and culture medium and replace with 2mL of prewarmed culture medium.\n\t​NOTE: many unattached cells floating in the medium are expected.\n4. Shear stress application using an orbital shaker\nHUVECs should reach confluence after 3 days of growth. Replace the medium with 1.9 mL of prewarmed culture medium (to achieve a height of 2 mm).\nPlace the plate on the platform of an orbital shaker in a humidified incubator under 95% air/5% CO2 and swirl it at 150 rpm for 3 days.\n\tNOTE: Wipe down the exterior surface of the orbital shaker using 70% ethanol before placing it into the incubator.\n(Optional) After 2 days of shear, cytokines can be added to the culture medium to investigate the interplay between cytokines and shear stress. After treatment, shear the cells for another day. In this study, TNF-α was used to activate the cells.",
    "Perform analyses after 3 days of shear stress application.\n5. Staining and imaging of cells\nAfter 3 days of shear, remove the plate from incubator and wash cells twice with PBS.\nFix the cells by adding 1.5 mL of 4% PFA into the well and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nRemove the 4% PFA from the well and wash twice with PBS.\nPermeabilize the cells by adding 0.1% Triton-X into the well and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the 0.1% Triton-X solution from the well and add 1.5 mL of 1% BSA into the well for blocking. Incubate the cells with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature.\nDilute rabbit anti-human ZO-1 antibody at a 1:200 dilution in 1% BSA. Add 1.5 mL of diluted antibody into the well and incubate it with the cells overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter overnight incubation, remove the diluted antibody and wash cells three times with PBS.\nDilute Alexa Fluor 488-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody at a 1:300 dilution in PBS. Add 1.5 mL of diluted secondary antibody into the well and incubate it with the cells for 1 h at room temperature.\nRemove the diluted secondary antibody and wash cells twice with PBS.\nDilute DRAQ5 at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS. Add 1.5 mL of diluted DRAQ5 into the well and incubate it with the cells for 15 min at room temperature to stain the cell nuclei.\nRemove the diluted DRAQ5 and wash three times with PBS.\nPerform a tile scan from the edge to the center of the well with a confocal microscope.\n6. Quantification of shape index and cells number\nPost process the images using MATLAB R2016a.",
    "Read the LIF file from confocal microscope into MATLAB and convert the merged tile scan to a binary image, then threshold the image by area and intensity to distinguish nuclei from background.\nSubdivide the binary tile scan into 1 mm radial segments.\nFit an ellipse to each individual nucleus.\nCount the number of ellipses within each radial segment to give a cell number.\nDefine the shape index = as SI = 4π x Area / Perimeter2. Calculate the shape index for each ellipse18.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
