    "BMDM harvest and preparationFor differentiation of primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), cultivate murine bone marrow cells (isolated from one tibia and femur) in BMDM medium and 10 cm square tissue culture dishes for 10 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Note: For BMDM cultivation in general, please refer to Bourgeois et al. (2009). Harvest BMDMs from 10 cm square dishes by gently scraping with a natural-rubber scraper 24 h before the experiment on Day 10 of cultivation and centrifuge at 300 x g, 20 °C for 6.5 min.Aspirate medium and resuspend the BMDM pellet in 1 ml BMDM medium.Accurately determine the BMDM cell concentration by using an automated cell counter.Transfer 2.5 x 105 BMDMs into a 24-well plate, supplied with a total volume of 300 μl BMDM medium.Note: Per every experimental condition, at least 3 technical replicates each for untreated and FeHQ-treated BMDMs have to be prepared (in total: minimum 6 x 24-wells/condition). Further, include one replicate of untreated BMDMs as unstained control for flow cytometry analysis. Incubate BMDMs overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.BMDM stimulationStimulate BMDMs with the respective reagent (e.g., LPS, cytokines, bacterial or fungal pathogens) under the desired condition.Incubate BMDMs at 37 °C, 5% CO2.BMDM staining and preparation for flow cytometry analysisThirty minutes before the end of BMDM stimulation, warm PBS to 37 °C in a water bath, freshly prepare FeHQ solution in sufficient amounts and adjust all required materials for subsequent BMDM staining procedure.Immediately before the end of the BMDM experiment, prepare the Calcein-AM staining solution and store it in the dark.Note: Calcein-AM is highly susceptible for hydrolysis in aqueous buffer solutions. Therefore, to ensure maximal BMDM staining efficiency, work as quick and as accurate as possible from this step on. Remove the BMDM medium by quickly tilting the 24-well plate onto a stack of tissue papers.",
    "Wash BMDMs 3x with 300 μl pre-warmed PBS and remove the wash solution by quickly tilting the 24-well plate onto the used stack of tissue papers.Note: Completely remove FCS-containing cell culture medium, since FCS residuals alter Calcein-AM staining of BMDMs. Always dispose the used stack of tissue papers into the corresponding safety waste. Add 300 μl Calcein-AM staining solution/well with a motorized single-channel pipet and incubate BMDMs at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 15 min.Remove the Calcein-AM staining solution by quickly tilting the 24-well plate onto a fresh stack of tissue papers.Wash BMDMs 3x with 300 μl pre-warmed PBS and remove the wash solution by quickly tilting the 24-well plate onto the used stack of tissue papers.Add 300 μl PBS to BMDMs of the untreated condition and 300 μl FeHQ solution to BMDMs of the FeHQ-treated condition with a motorized single-channel pipet and incubate BMDMs at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min.Note: BMDM incubation in FeHQ solution longer than 30 min will detrimentally affect BMDM membrane integrity. Therefore, subsequent BMDM harvest and flow cytometry analysis should also be performed as soon as possible. Remove the solutions by quickly tilting the 24-well plate onto a fresh stack of tissue papers.Wash BMDMs 3x with 300 μl pre-warmed PBS and remove the wash solution by quickly tilting the 24-well plate onto the used stack of tissue papersAdd 250 μl trypsin solution per 24-well with a motorized single-channel pipet and incubate BMDMs at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 min.Place 24-well plate on ice and add 750 μl ice-cold complete DMEM to the wells in order to prevent further trypsinization.Detach BMDMs by pipetting up and down with a 1,000 μl single-channel pipet, transfer the cell suspension of every technical replicate to a separate 1.",
    "5 ml reaction tube and store on ice in the dark.After harvesting all BMDMs, centrifuge cell suspensions at 400 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.Aspirate medium, resuspend BMDM pellet in 300 μl FACS buffer and transfer to 5 ml round-bottom FACS tubes.Process all BMDM samples and store FACS tube on ice in the dark.Analyze BMDM samples on a flow cytometer equipped with appropriate lasers and filters for the detection of Calcein fluorescence with excitation maximum ~490 nm and emission maximum ~510 nm (Sabnis, 2010) as soon as possible."
