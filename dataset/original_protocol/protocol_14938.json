    "All described procedures were reviewed and approved by our institutional animal care and use committee.\n1. Plan the Experiment\nChoose cells to be injected. Cells from a variety of sources are candidates for injection: adherent cell culture lines, genetically modified clones, neurosphere cells, primary cultures, or disaggregated tumors. The type of model desired will define the most appropriate site of injection.\n\t\nDetermine cell number for injection. The number of cells required to form tumors varies with cell line and must be determined empirically; tumor growth rate depends heavily on cell type, cell number and tissue culture passage number. Cell numbers ranging from 1 x 104 to 2 x 105 or more per injection have produced tumors of varying growth rates.\nLimit the volume for injection. The cells should be suspended in the smallest volume of serum free media or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) that allows for smooth, easy passage through a 26 G needle. The smaller the volume actually delivered into the brain, the more precise and defined the resulting tumor; optimal results are obtained by injecting volumes ranging from 3 to 6 µl. Plan to prepare a final total volume of at least 50 µl of suspended cells, regardless of the number of injections planned, to allow accurate measurement, mixing and sampling.",
    "Choose appropriate mice for the model. Murine models of human tumors typically utilize young immune-compromised mice to avoid immune mediated graft rejection. It is not necessary for the work to take place in a biological safety cabinet if appropriate precautions are taken, including decontamination, disinfection, and sterilization of materials and equipment. The work shown here has been done in athymic nude mice, male and female, between 6 and 12 weeks of age. Mice that weigh less than 20 g can be difficult to position on a stereotaxic frame and may be more susceptible to hypothermia.\n2. Assemble the Equipment\nObtain and decontaminate a mouse stereotaxic frame, alignment console, and mouse gas anesthesia head holder, microsyringe pump, heat pad, anesthesia machine, fiber optic work lamp, and variable speed rotary drill. Clean and decontaminate all equipment.\nProgram the injection parameters (including injection volume, flow rate, rate units, syringe type) and other variables necessary for the operation of the syringe pump. Optimize settings for each particular model.\n\tNOTE: In these injections the settings were 3,000 nl samples at a rate of 400 nl/min (rate units “M”) using a 25 µl syringe (Device Type “E”) in the Non-Grouped (“N”) mode.\nClean a precision microsyringe with 26 G needle with several rinses of sterile deionized water (diH2O) and 70% ethanol (EtOH), doing a final rinse with diH2O. Some but not all models are designed to be autoclaved. Ensure that the plunger movement is smooth and free.\nObtain anesthesia delivery equipment. Isoflurane is the preferred anesthetic as it is easy to regulate the depth and duration of anesthesia. Ensure that the stereotaxic unit is equipped with a mouse anesthesia gas attachment and that the necessary tubing and connectors are in place to deliver the gas mixture from the anesthesia machine to the mouse.",
    "Autoclave surgical tools, including fine tip scissors, two forceps/hemostats (with teeth) for suturing, medium sized scissors, medium- and fine-tipped tweezers, and at least two 1 mm dental drill bits. Keep instruments clean during the procedure with 70% EtOH, disinfectant, or a bead sterilizer.\nObtain isoflurane, analgesic, ophthalmic ointment/lubricant, antibiotic ointment, saline, 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), antiseptic, and bone wax (if desired) from a veterinary or medical supply. Prepare sterile diH2O and 70% EtOH. Disposables such as gauze pads, sterile dressings, sutures, ethanol swabs, cotton tipped swabs, sterile surgical gloves, surgical blades and more are itemized in the materials list. A fine tip permanent marker for marking the skull should be decontaminated and dedicated for surgical use.\n3. Prepare Cells for Injection\nIn the experiments shown here, select an immortalized human GBM cell line. Determine the number of cells (2 x 105) and the volume of suspension to be injected (3 µl) empirically; details may vary with cell type. Use a volume of at least 50 µl to facilitate accurate measuring, mixing, and injection.\nTrypsinize cells and resuspend in media or PBS. Perform the following steps just prior to cell injection:\n\t\nRemove media from cells by aspiration and rinse with 10 ml PBS per 100 mm plate; remove PBS.\nAdd 1 ml trypsin to each 100 mm plate and incubate at RT just long enough to yield a single cell suspension.\nStop trypsin activity with 5 ml Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) + 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) per 100 mm plate.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 450 x g and resuspend in ~5 ml serum free DMEM (SF-DMEM) per 100 mm plate.\nCount viable cells using a hemacytometer or an automated cell counter.",
    "Adjust the live cell density to 2 x 105 cells/3 µl (or as determined by experimentation) by pelleting the cells and resuspending in SF-DMEM.\nKeep cells chilled on ice or a chill pack (do not allow cells to freeze). Mix gently by finger flicking.\n4. Anesthetize and Prepare Mouse for Surgery\nInduce anesthesia using ~5% isoflurane (oxygen flow ~2 L/min) or as directed by veterinarian. Induction should take 2 to 3 min. Maintain mouse at an adequate depth of anesthesia with ~3% isoflurane.\n\t\nCheck depth of anesthesia by toe pinch, adjust isoflurane if indicated and continue to monitor breathing and toe pinch response throughout the procedure. Cover mouse with gauze pads for warmth and monitor mouse regularly throughout the procedure, which may take 45 min to 1 hr, depending on the rate of injection.\nPosition the mouse in stereotaxic frame by carefully sliding the palate bar over the tongue and into the mouth. Hook the front incisors into the tooth hole. Use ear bars to stabilize the head, with the ear-to-eye surface as near horizontal as possible. Do not force bars into ear canal. It is critical to position the head securely: check side-to-side and up-and-down motion gently with fingertips. Use the adjustable controls of the stereotaxic unit to optimize fit.\nLubricate the eyes with ophthalmic ointment. Clean the skin between ears and eyes twice with alternating applications of a povidone-iodine antiseptic and 70% EtOH.\nInject chosen analgesic subcutaneously (SQ) into flank (or as directed).\n5. Perform Injection\nDetermine the injection site. The injection site may vary with the size and strain of mouse and the type of cell. Cells injected too close to the ventricles may lead to cranio-spinal spread of disease. Cells injected too shallow may grow out through the needle track.",
    "NOTE: In the experiments shown here, the target was defined as the frontal region of the cerebral cortex a site 2.5 mm lateral (right), 1.5 mm anterior, and 3.5 mm ventral with respect to the bregma was chosen (Figure 1), producing a midbrain tumor in mice ranging from 20 to 30 g.\nMake a small incision (~8 mm long) using sterile technique through the skin of the head to expose the bregma and the site of injection. A diagonal cut, from a point between the midline axis and the right eye towards the right ear (Figure 2) allows access to both the bregma and the injection site.\nRetract the skin and use a sterile cotton swab to dry the surface of the skull. Blot the bone with another swab moistened with H2O2 to visualize bregma. The H2O2 will produce oxygen bubbles, leaving thin lines of white foam along the coronal and sagittal sutures that intersect at bregma.\nLock an empty syringe with needle onto the micropump and maneuver the tip of the needle directly over the bregma; set coordinates on the alignment console to 0.0 mm lateral, 0.0 mm anterior/posterior, and 0.0 mm ventral/dorsal.\nMove the needle to 2.5 mm lateral (right) and 1.5 mm anterior with respect to bregma (or desired location) using the control knobs on the stereotaxic unit. Raise the syringe slightly and mark the exact location on the skull with a dedicated felt-tip pen. If the outer surface of the skull is not on a level plane with bregma (i.e., the dorsal/ventral coordinate no longer reads zero), reset the ventral/dorsal reading to 0.0 to ensure that the depth of the injection is not shifted.",
    "Drill a small hole into the skull with a hand-held rotary drill outfitted with a sterile dental tip at the appropriate site marked with the pen in step 5.5. Hold the drill at an angle to the skull and very gently touch the tip to the bone. Repeat as needed. Drilling almost but not completely through the bone, leaving the needle to actually penetrate this layer of the skull, results in the cleanest injection.\nRemove bone dust with a cotton swab moistened in PBS or saline. Return the syringe to the pump and lower the needle straight down to the burr hole to confirm location. If the burr hole is not centered with the needle, use the drill to enlarge the opening.\nGently mix the cell suspension and draw the cells into the syringe using the pump controller. Avoid bubbles and clumps and wipe the needle with an alcohol swab to remove contaminating cells on the exterior surface. If the syringe/needle is clogged or frozen, remove and quickly clean with sterile water and 70% EtOH.\nLower the needle to the level of the skull surface (0.0 mm ventral/dorsal). Then slowly (over approximately 1 min) lower the needle to pierce through the full thickness of the skull and penetrate the brain to a depth of 4 mm ventrall. Withdraw the needle slowly to 3.5 mm ventral. If the mouse head is held securely in the stereotaxic unit, there should be almost no movement of the skull.",
    "Confirm that the correct parameters are entered into the pump controller (Section 2.2) and press “RUN/STOP” (or as directed by product manual) to autoinject cells. Monitor the mouse and adjust isoflurane if indicated. Watch the syringe and ensure that the plunger is moving in the barrel. Frozen or clogged movement can result in a bent/broken plunger.\nWait 1 to 2 min with the needle in the brain, then very slowly (over 3 to 4 min) withdraw needle from tissue. Total time to remove the needle after the injection is complete is 5 min. Use a cotton swab to blot the area around the burr hole; leave the edges of the skin open to allow the bone to dry.\nRemove syringe from the pump and quickly rinse 3x with sterile H2O, 3x with 70% EtOH, and 3x with sterile H2O (or as directed by maker). Wipe needle with EtOH and set aside.\nApply sterile bone wax (equivalent to 1 or 2 µl) to the burr hole and use the wooden end of a sterile cotton swab to tamp the wax onto and into the bone. If the surface is dried adequately, it should stick.\nSpread sterile drape over the mouse and surrounding work area and suture the incision; three stitches should be sufficient. Alternatively, surgical adhesive may be used. Apply a topical antibiotic.\nReduce isoflurane to 0% and remove the mouse from the stereotaxic unit, being careful to protect teeth. Check ears, mouth and tongue.",
    "Monitor the mouse closely following injection. Place mouse on a heat pad for 5 to 10 min; then transfer to cage (on heat pad) and observe until mouse wakes and is ambulatory. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it has regained enough consciousness to maintain sternal recumbence. Do not return mouse to the company of other animals until fully recovered. Consider the use of additional analgesic if signs of pain are noticed.\n6. Finish and Monitor Recovery & Tumor Development\nClean all instruments and equipment using 70% EtOH, a bead sterilizer or disinfectant between mice.\nMonitor the injected mice for two days after the procedure for signs of pain, infection or other complications. Inject analgesic at 24 and 48 hr (or as indicated) after procedure. Remove sutures at 7 to 10 days, if necessary.\nEvaluate the mice for clinical signs of disease, paralysis, decreased activity, weight loss, seizures, or general illness.\nMonitor the tumor development by the appropriate method [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), In Vivo Imaging Systems (IVIS), etc.].\nSubscription Required.
