    "Purify proteins for in vitro reconstitution assayPrepare the H. volcanii cells for MsrA-StrepII and His6-UbaA purification as follows.Using a sterile toothpick, streak H. volcanii LR03-pJAM3010 (MsrA-StrepII) and LR03-pJAM1209 (His6-UbaA) from -80 °C glycerol stocks onto agar plates of ATCC974 medium with novobiocin (0.2 μg∙ml-1) (ATCC+Nv medium, Recipe 1). The stocks consist of stationary phase cells frozen in ATCC+Nv medium with 15 % (v/v) glycerol. Incubate the plates in plastic zip-lock bags at 42 °C for 5 days until isolated colonies appear. Using a sterile loop, transfer the isolated colonies from the plates into 4 x 25 ml ATCC+Nv medium (in 250 ml baffled culture flasks covered in foil). Grow the cells at 42 °C with rotary shaking at 200 rpm to log-phase (OD600 of 0.6-0.8).Transfer the log phase Hfx. volcanii cells to fresh 4 x 1-L ATCC+Nv medium (in 2.8-L Fernbach flasks covered in foil). Grow the cells to stationary phase (OD600 of 3.5-4.0) at 42 °C with rotary shaking at 200 rpm. Note: Ectopic expression of MsrA-StrepII and His6-UbaA are constitutive in the H. volcanii strains; hence, an inducer is not required.Prepare the E. coli cells for MsrA-StrepII and Flag-His6-SAMP2 purification as follows.Freshly transform plasmids pJAM3200 (for purification of MsrA-StrepII) and pJAM1132 (for purification of Flag-His6-SAMP2) into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) by chemical transformation as previously reported (Hanahan et al., 1991). Select for transformants by spread plating cells onto solid LB medium (Recipe 2) with kanamycin (50 μg∙ml-1) (LB+Km medium) and incubating the plates at 37 °C for 14 h.Transfer ~100 colonies of the freshly transformed cells into 25 ml LB+Km liquid medium (in 250 ml baffled culture flasks covered in foil) by adding 5 ml LB+Km medium to the plate using a 10 ml pipettor for resuspension and transfer.",
    "Note: Not all proteins require this type of approach but we do find that a subset of the proteins we work with are not readily expressed in E. coli if the cells are not freshly transformed. Note that some proteins are expressed in E. coli using the pET system even in the absence of IPTG which can cause mild toxicity and selection for cells that display loss of target gene expression. We did not want to take this type of risk that the MsrA and/or other proteins of this study would be of low level expression in E. coli.Grow the cells in the 25 ml medium at 37 °C with rotary shaking at 220 rpm to log phase (OD600 of 0.6-0.8). Subculture the cells into 500 ml fresh LB+Km medium (in 2.8 L Fernbach flasks covered in foil) to a final OD600 0.01 and grow the cells to log phase (OD600 of 0.6-0.8) at 37 °C with rotary shaking at 220 rpm. Induce protein expression in E. coli by addition of 0.4 mM IPTG. After induction, shift cell cultures to 25 °C for 12 h at 200 rpm prior to harvest.Harvest the H. volcanii and E. coli cells by centrifugation (4,500 x g, 10 min, 15 °C) using a Sorvall Evolution RC centrifuge with a Fiberlite F9-4x 1000y fixed angle superspeed rotor.Resuspend the cells at 4-5 vol per wet weight of cell pellet in lysis buffer formulated for HisTrap or StrepTrap HP chromatography (Recipes 3 and 4). Passage the resuspended cell material 4-6 times through a chilled French Press cell with a French Press at 24,000 psi. Collect the cell lysate in 50 ml polypropylene Nalgene centrifuge tubes on ice.",
    "Clarify the cell lysate by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 20 min, 4 °C) using a Sorvall Evolution RC centrifuge with a Sorvall SS-34 fixed angle rotor.Filter the cell lysate using SFCA syringe filters (0.8 μm then 0.45 µm pore size). Perform all chromatography steps at room temperature (as halophilic proteins are typically thermotolerant). Equilibrate the columns with 5-10 column volumes of Tris-salt buffer pH 7.4 (Recipe 5). Warm the clarified lysate to room temperature and apply the sample to a HisTrap HP column (5 ml bed volume, GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 1 ml∙min-1 or StrepTrap HP column (1 ml bed volume, GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml∙min-1. Control the flow rate of the chromatography using a BioLogic DuoFlow 10 System. Monitor protein fractions by A280. Remove the unbound proteins by washing the column with 140 ml Tris-salt buffer pH 7.4 at a flow rate of 1.2 ml∙min-1.Elute the bound proteins in Tris-salt buffer pH 7.4 supplemented with 5 mM d-desthiobiotin (for the StrepII tagged proteins) or 500 mM imidazole (for the His6-tagged proteins). Collect 1 ml fractions in 13 mm borosilicate glass tubes.Reducing 12% SDS-PAGE can be carried out using small portions of the eluted fractions (typically 5 μl is sufficient), followed by Coomassie Blue staining, to confirm the presence of the target protein in the eluted fractions.Concentrate the eluted protein fractions by centrifugal filtration using an Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit with Ultracel-3 membrane (Merck) in an HL-8 swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C and 4,000 x g. We recommend concentrating the eluted fractions to a final volume of approximately 1 ml.Further purify the proteins by gel filtration chromatography by applying 0.5 ml of protein sample onto a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Tris-salt buffer pH 7.",
    "4 at a flow rate of 0.3 ml∙min-1. Collect peak fractions based on A280. Repeat this chromatographic step as needed. His6-UbaA purifies as a dimer, while Flag-His6-SAMP2 and MsrA-StrepII purify as monomers. Check the purity of eluted fractions as indicated in Step A12 above. The volume of each fraction applied to the gel should be adjusted based on the A280: typically for an A280 of 0.5, 7.5 μl of protein is sufficient.Repeat Steps A13- A15 as necessary until desired purity is achieved. Usually, two successive gel filtration chromatography steps will result in a highly purified preparation of protein.Once the protein preparation is of sufficient purity, concentrate the protein using an Amicon Ultra-4 to a final volume of 100 μl or less. Measure the protein concentration by BCA Protein Assay according to the supplier using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the protein standard. Store the purified proteins at 4 °C for future assay.Note: The purified proteins can be stored at 4 °C for 1 month. Preparation of cell lysate for in vitro reconstitution assayGrow cultures of Hfx. volcanii LR03 (Δsamp1 Δsamp2 Δsamp3 ΔmsrA ΔubaA) in 25 ml of ATCC974 medium similarly to Steps A1a to A1c.Subculture cells to an OD600 of 0.01 in 500 ml ATCC974 medium with and without 25 mM DMSO (in 2.8 L Fernbach flasks). Grow cells to stationary phase (OD600 of 3.5-4.0) at 42 °C with rotary shaking at 200 rpm. Harvest cells by centrifugation (4,500 x g, 10 min at 15 °C) using a Sorvall Evolution RC centrifuge with a Fiberlite F8-6 x 1000y fixed angle superspeed rotor.Resuspend cells in 8 ml of Tris-salt buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 µM bortezomib (LC Laboratories), and 30 μg∙ml-1 DNase I from bovine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich).",
    "Dilute the bortezomib from a 200 mM stock of bortezomib dissolved in 99.8% (wt/vol) DMF.Lyse cells by French Press (20,000 psi) (similarly to Step A5). Clarify the cell lysate by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 20 min, 4 °C) using a Sorvall Evolution RC centrifuge with a Sorvall SS-34 fixed angle rotor. Filter the lysate by using a 0.2 μm SFCA syringe filter. Study the effect of different chemical agents on the stimulation of SAMP conjugate formation by dialyzing (3 times, at 4 °C) the cell lysate against 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 supplemented with 2 M NaCl. As an example, load 7 ml of cell lysate into the dialysis tubing (3.5 kDa MWCO, SnakeSkin pre-wet according to the manufacturer’s instructions, Fisher Scientific). Place the sample in 4 L of buffer and stir the buffer for 1.5 to 2 h at 4 °C. Replace the dialysis buffer with fresh buffer and dialyze the sample for an additional 1.5 to 2 h at 4 °C. Repeat this last step for a total of three buffer exchanges against the sample. Measure protein concentration of cell lysate by BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockville, IL) according to the supplier using bovine serum albumin (BSA, Thermo Scientific) as the protein standard. Store cell lysate at 4 °C for future assay.Note: We recommend using cell lysate for in vitro assay within 8 h after preparation. In vitro reconstitution of MsrA-dependent sampylationIn a microcentrifuge tube, combine each component listed in the table below in the order shown.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180521/20180521014226_1324.jpgNotes:  If the purpose is to purify and identify SAMP conjugates from the in vitro reconstitution assay, set the total reaction volume to 1.6 ml and use a 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube.We always use freshly prepared concentrated assay buffer for every in vitro reconstitution assay.",
    "Mg-ATP, DMSO and protein components are selectively removed from the assay as controls. MsrA-StrepII can be purified from E. coli or H. volcanii LR03 (ΔmsrA ΔubaA Δsamp1/2/3, a sampylation deficient strain) with no detectable effect on conjugate formation. *Indicated molar concentration of His6-UbaA reflects the molecular mass of a His6-UbaA monomer, although His6-UbaA is purified as a dimer. For example, 5 µM* His6-UbaA is equivalent to 154 μg·ml-1 His6-UbaA.Incubate the reaction in a 45 °C water bath for 0, 2, 4, 8 and 18 h.Divide the 1.6 ml reaction sample into 2 parts (80 µl for Western blot and remaining 1.52 ml for purification of SAMP conjugates as described in Procedure D). After assay, remove salt from the 80 µl reaction mixtures using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (7K MWCO) according to the supplier’s instructions (Thermo Scientific). Prior to application of the sample, equilibrate the column in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer at pH 6.8. Centrifuge the column at 1,500 x g for 1 min using the Eppendorf microcentrifuge at room temperature. The final sample volume obtained is 100 µl.Terminate the reaction by mixing the desalted samples with an equal volume of 2x SDS reducing buffer (Recipe 7). Boil the samples for 3 x 5 min. Vortex for 30 sec after each boiling. Apply the reaction products to lanes 2-10 and the precision plus protein dual color molecular mass standards (2.5 μl) to lane 1 of reducing 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Recipe 8). The volume of sample applied may need to be adjusted based on detection sensitivity; good starting points are 3.5 µl for detection by anti-Flag antibody, and 6 µl for anti-StrepII or anti-His antibody. Separate the samples by electrophoresis at room temperature in 1x running buffer (diluted from 10x stock, Recipe 9) at 150 V for 70-90 min.",
    "Transfer the proteins to PVDF membrane at 4 °C using the mini trans-blot module in transblot buffer (Recipe 10) according to the supplier’s instructions (Bio-Rad) for 3 h at 90 V or overnight at 20 V.Remove the membrane from the cassette. Mark the location of the gel and the protein standards on the membrane using a pencil.Place the membrane upright in an 18 by 10 cm plastic container. Briefly rinse the membrane with 25 ml of 1x TBS. Block the membrane for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in 25 ml blocking buffer composed of TBST buffer (Recipe 11-12) supplemented with 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Publix). Slowly rock the membrane during this blocking step on the medium setting of the BenchRocker 2D Rocker (Alkali Scientific Inc). Add the primary antibody to 10 ml of the blocking buffer in the following dilutions: 1:5,000 of the anti-Strep-tag II antibody to detect MsrA-StrepII, 1:5,000 of the anti-His IgG2 monoclonal antibody to detect His6-UbaA, and 1:10,000 of the alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody to detect Flag-His6-SAMP2. Incubate the membrane with the primary antibody solution for 60 min at room temperature using the medium setting of the rocker. Rinse the membrane for 3 x 15-30 min at room temperature with 25-50 ml TBST buffer using the high setting of the rocker. To detect the anti-Strep-tag II and anti-His primary antibodies, incubate the membrane with a 1:10,000 dilution of the secondary antibody [goat anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule)-alkaline phosphatase-linked antibody] in blocking buffer and rinse the membrane 3 x in TBST buffer as described above.Visualize the antibody: protein complexes on the PVDF membrane by chemiluminescence using CDP-Star (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and exposure to X-ray film (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the supplier’s guidelines.",
    "Note: The HRP-conjugated His6 monoclonal antibody can be used in place of the discontinued anti-His IgG2 monoclonal antibody. HRP activity is detected using ECL Prime with X-ray film according to the user guidelines. Purification of SAMP-conjugates from the in vitro reconstitution assayPurify sampylated proteins from the in vitro reconstitution assay by use of Flag-His6-SAMP2 as the substrate and cOmplete His-tag resin (Roche) as the purification resin. Equilibrate 200 μl of the His-tag resin (Roche) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Mix the sample (1.5 ml) after the in vitro assay with 8.5 ml PBS [5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 1 mg∙ml-1 EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0] prior to application to the His-tag resin (200 µl). To enhance the protein yield, apply the flow-through of the sample to resin for one more time.Note: Total reaction volume is 1.6 ml. Use 0.1 ml to analyze SAMP conjugation reaction products by Western blot and the remaining 1.5 ml to purify SAMP conjugates. Remove nonspecific proteins by washing the His-tag resin with 40 column volumes of PBS buffer. Elute bound proteins from the resin by addition of 80 μl of PBS supplemented with 200 mM imidazole. Transfer the resin with elution buffer into a new microcentrifuge tube and rotate for 20 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge the sample at 10,000 x g for 10 min using the Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C (in the cold room). Carefully remove 70 μl of the supernatant without touching the resin.Mix the supernatant with an equal volume of 2x SDS reducing buffer and boil 2 x 5 min with 30 sec vortex after each boiling. Separate proteins by 12% SDS-PAGE.",
    "Analyze the samples in parallel gels by immunoblotting and staining for total protein by SYPRO Ruby (Bio-Rad) followed by Bio-Safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad) as directed by the manufacturer. Excise the major band of SAMP-conjugates in gel slices for mass spectrometry analysis. Include gel slices of the negative control in this analysis.*Note: Apply 10 μl of the sample for total protein staining and subsequent excision for mass spectrometry analysis. For immunoblotting analysis, apply 3.5 µl for detection by anti-Flag antibody, and 6 µl for anti-StrepII or anti-His antibody."
