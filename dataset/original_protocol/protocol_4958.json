    "Expression and reconstitution of aequorinGrow PAO1 strain carrying plasmid pMMB66EH encoding aequorin gene for overnight at 37 °C on LB agar plate with carbenicillin (300 μg/ml).Inoculate 5 ml of BMM medium with 2-3 single colonies grown on LB agar plate and incubate for 12 h at 37 °C while shaking at 200 rpm. Antibiotic was omitted hereafter to avoid its effect on bacteria.Transfer 1 ml of 12 h culture of OD600 0.25 (Adjust OD if needed by diluting in fresh BMM medium) to 100 ml of fresh BMM medium in 500 ml flask. Grow culture at 37 °C, 200 rpm until the mid-log phase, as determined in previous growth studies. For example, for PAO1, mid-log phase is reached at OD600 of 0.16 after 12 h of incubation.Once reached mid-log phase, induce cells with 1 mM IPTG (1 ml of 100 mM IPTG) and incubate for 2 h, at 37 °C, 200 rpm. At the end of induction, measure OD600 of the culture and compare with the previously recorded growth curve, to make sure that cells are still in their logarithmic phase of growth.Transfer cells into 250 ml ice cold centrifuge bottles. From this step and until the reconstitution step, maintain cells on ice.Harvest cells by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard supernatant and wash the cell pellet with 100 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer. For this, first carefully resuspend cells by pipetting into of 2 ml HEPES buffer, and then add the remaining 98 ml of HEPES buffer.Collect cells by centrifuging at 6,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend collected cell pellet in 1,250 μl of HEPES buffer by pipetting and transfer 1 ml of cell suspension into a fresh microfuge tube.",
    "Add coelenterazine to a final concentration of 2.5 μM. For this, add 5 μl of 500 μM coelenterazine solution to 1 ml of cell suspension. Since coelenterazine is light sensitive, the procedure from this point onward must be carried out in the dark (see Notes).After addition of coelenterazine, incubate cell suspension at room temperature without shaking for 30 min. Note: This step is referred to as a reconstitution step. Since coelenterazine undergoes slow oxidation in the presence of atmospheric oxygen, shaking should be strictly avoided.Collect the cell pellet by centrifuging at 6,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and wash two times with 1 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer. Resuspend the final collected cell pellet into 1 ml HEPES buffer by pipetting.Measure OD600 of thus prepared sample. Adjust the final OD600 of the cell suspension to 0.4 by adding HEPES buffer if needed. Measurement of luminescencePipette 100 μl of cells suspension with reconstituted aequorin into 96-well luminescence (white) plate and equilibrate at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. When the effect of inhibitors or other compounds on Ca2+in to be tested, add the compounds during this step.Load the plate with samples into a Synergy Mx plate reader, and record luminescence for 1 min, at 5 sec interval. Use this reading to calculate a basal level of Ca2+in.To study the response of the intracellular Ca2+ levels to extracellular Ca2+ elevated to the millimolar concentrations commonly present in some environments including a human body, expose the cells prepared as above to the addition of 1 mM CaCl2. For this, inject 20 μl of 6 mM CaCl2 into each well by the plate reader injector. Prior to injection, prime the injector with 5 ml of 6 mM CaCl2.",
    "If the immediate effects of other compounds need to be tested, inject the latter at this step (before, after or instead of CaCl2) through a second injector, followed by luminescence measurements.Immediately after injection, mix the samples for 1 sec, and record luminescence for 20 min at 5 sec interval (Figure 1 A). Mixing and measurements were pre-programmed in the instrument.In order to estimate the remaining aequorin present in the samples, briefly take out the plate from the reader, and manually add 120 μl of discharge buffer to each sample, mix well, but quickly by pipetting, and the load back the plate into the plate reader. Read luminescence for 10 min at 5 sec interval (Figure 1B). Estimate the total aequorin by summing the luminescence detected during the entire experiment including the discharge. Use this value of total aequorin for data normalization, when calculating the concentration of Ca2+in (Figure 1C). Note: it is important to ensure that no bubbles are formed during mixing, as bubbles will interfere with the luminescence reading."
