    "All the animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University. NOD-SCID immunodeficient mice aged 4-6 weeks old (of both sexes) and female Balb/c nude mice aged 4-6 weeks old were used for the present study. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials). The ethics committee of West China Hospital authorized the study with human subjects (protocol number 2020353). Each patient provided written informed consent.\n1. Experimental preparation\nArrange disposable blades, sterilized scissors and tweezers, and other instruments required for tumor transplantation, place them on the ultra-clean workbench, and irradiate them with ultraviolet light in advance.\nPrepare sterile saline and Petri dishes for use during the test.\n2. Acquisition and transport of fresh tumor tissue\nObtain fresh tumor samples (usually larger than 5 mm x 5 mm in size) from the operating room, and place them in a 15 mL or 50 mL centrifuge tube containing sterile HTK solution (see Table of Materials) or saline. Label the centrifuge tubes.\n\tNOTE: Fresh tumor samples were obtained by surgical removal or puncture from patients with ATC or HNSCC.\nPut the centrifuge tubes in an ice box prepared in advance.\n\tNOTE: During this time, the transplant operator must prepare the necessary items for transplantation (see Table of Materials).\nEnsure that the time between sample collection and transportation to the laboratory for PDX construction does not exceed 2 h. During transport, surround the tubes containing the tissues with an ice-water mixture or ice packs to preserve the tissue activity.\n3. Tumor transplantation\nOnce the tumor tissues arrive at the laboratory, record and renumber them.",
    "NOTE: For the present study, the patient information was kept strictly confidential. The remaining steps of the procedure were performed in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory. When entering the laboratory, wearing a smock over the work clothes or protective clothing, a hat, and a mask is recommended. The treatment of tumor tissue is conducted in a biosafety cabinet.\nDisinfect the centrifuge tubes containing the tumor tissues with 75% alcohol, and place them on the operating table. Transfer the tumor tissues to 6 cm Petri dishes filled with saline using sterilized ophthalmic forceps. Next, cut them into small pieces of about 2 mm x 2 mm and 3 mm x 3 mm using a blade.\nTransfer the pieces of tumor tissues into a 6 cm Petri dish containing the appropriate amount of saline, wrap the dish with the sealing film, place it in an ice box, and carry it into the specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal room along with the necessary instruments (a pair of scissors, forceps, and inoculation needles).\nPrepare the animal following the steps below.\n\t\nRemove the hair on the right lateral thorax of 4-6 week-old female or male NOD-SCID immunodeficient mice, and disinfect the skin with 75% alcohol. Anesthetize the mice by an intraperitoneal injection of 80 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine (see Table of Materials), and smear their eyes with vet ointment to prevent dryness. Confirm anesthesia depth via loss of pedal reflex.\nMake a 2 mm incision with scissors through the skin at the middle of the right lateral thorax of mice.\nTake a tumor piece from the Petri dish, and place it into the 2.4 mm x 2.0 mm trocar needle (see Table of Materials) with forceps.",
    "Hold the mouse, tighten the skin at the puncture site, use the trocar containing the tumor pieces to insert the tumor through the initial 2 mm skin incision, move to the back of the shoulder, and push the trocar core.\nEnsure that the tumor piece is pushed out and is left in the transitional sinus formed by the trocar puncture, and then pull out the trocar.\nIf the tumor moves with the needle when it is withdrawn, use the trocar to reset it and suture the incision.\n\tNOTE: In this study, each mouse was inoculated at the dorsal fore and hind limbs. One to three mice were inoculated per tumor sample from each patient based on the tumor size.\n4. Tumor tissue preservation, fixation, and protein freezing\nNOTE: The remaining tumor tissues were used for seed preservation, fixation, and DNA/RNA/protein freezing, respectively.\nRemove the saline from the tumor surface with a sterile gauze before placing it in the cryopreservation tube to ensure that the tumor surface is not excessively wet.\nPut four to six pieces of 2 mm x 2 mm tumor tissue in a 2 mL cell cryopreservation tube, add 1 mL of cryopreservation solution composed of 90% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into the tube, put the tube in a gradient cooling box, freeze it at −80 °C overnight, and finally, transfer it to liquid nitrogen.\nPlace the 3 mm x 3 mm tumor tissue blocks in 10% buffered formalin for tissue fixation for pathological examination.\nPut the 3 mm x 3 mm tissue block into a 2 mL cell cryopreservation tube, quickly freeze it in liquid nitrogen, and then transfer to a −80 °C refrigerator for DNA/RNA and protein extraction.",
    "Collect the clinical information of the patients, such as the smoking history, tumor size, differentiation, pathological subtype, cancer grade, cancer stage, distant metastasis, origin, medical history, immunohistochemistry, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in HNSCC patients, and treatment medication.\n5. Passaging, cryopreservation, and resuscitation of PDX model tumors\nMeasure the length and width of the subcutaneous tumors in mice by using vernier calipers once a week, and calculate the tumor volume according to the formula: tumor volume = 0.5 × length × width2. Draw the tumor growth curve.\nWhen the PDX tumor reaches 2,000 mm3, passage it to the next generation of mice, and perform tumor re-transplantation. Perform the preparation of the instruments following step 4.\nEuthanize the mice by cervical dislocation after anesthetizing with 80 mg/kg ketamine.\nDisinfect the skin with 75% alcohol. Then, cut the skin surrounding the tumor using scissors, then remove the tumor with forceps, and place it in a Petri dish. \nPerform the tumor transplantation procedure following step 3.\nPerform the preservation and cryopreservation of the PDX model tumors following step 4.\nFor the resuscitation of the tumor tissue, follow the principle of slow freezing and quick dissolving. After taking out the cryovials from liquid nitrogen, quickly place them in a water bath at 37 °C for rapid dissolving.\nGently shake the cryovials in the water bath to accelerate the thawing process.\nThaw, transfer the tumor pieces to the prepared normal saline for washing, and then inoculate the next generation of mice. For the specific operation, please see the tissue transplantation procedure in step 3.\n6. Determining the therapeutic efficacy of lenvatinib and cisplatin in the ATC PDX model\nNOTE: The ATC PDX model was used to test the therapeutic effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib and the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin25,26,27.",
    "Select the P5 generation tumor tissue of an ATC PDX model (THY-017), cut into 2-4 mm3 tissue pieces, and inoculate subcutaneously (step 3) to the right back of ten 4-6 week female Balb/c nude mice.\nSelect 15 mice with tumor volumes between 50-150 mm3, and divide them into three groups.\nAdminister lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) intragastrically to one group once daily for 15 days, administer cisplatin (3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to one group every 3 days for a total of six doses, and administer the control group with the same volume of normal saline.\nMeasure the body weight and tumor volume of the mice twice per week.\nAt the end of the test, euthanize the mice (step 5.3), and weigh the tumors.\nSubscription Required.
