    "1. Fermentation and Sampling\nPreparation of media and fermenters\n\tNOTE: All the fermentations are carried out in parallel, using the same strain and in the same chemically defined synthetic medium (SM, composition provided in Table 1), which includes a mixture of ammonium and amino acids as nitrogen sources15. For each fermentation, a single nitrogen compound is provided exclusively in a uniformly labeled 13C or 15N form (100%), while the others remain unlabeled. For each labeled nitrogen source that is used in the set of experiments (here: 15NH4, U-15N4-Arg, U-15N2-Gln, U-13C6-Leu, U-13C5-Val, U-13C6-Ile, U-13C4-Thr), two fermenters are prepared. For each condition, duplicate fermentation is performed using only unlabeled molecules (7 control fermentations).\n\t\nFor each N-source to be studied, prepare 500 mL of SM medium that contains all the nitrogen sources listed in Table 1, with the exception of the compound to be used in 100% labeled form.\n\t\tNOTE: The labeled molecule is added in the next steps.\nPasteurize each medium in a 1 L flask (10 min, 100 °C) containing a magnetic stirring bar. Weigh the appropriate amount of labeled molecule to reach the final concentration that is reported in Table 1 and dissolve it in the medium.\nSterilize the medium using a disposable vacuum filtration system (cellulose acetate membrane, 0.22 µm). Using a sterile measuring cylinder, divide the medium between two pre-sterilized fermenters (250 mL) that contain a magnetic stirring bar and are equipped with fermentation locks to avoid the entry of oxygen but allow the release of CO2.\nHeat the fermentation flasks to 28 °C by placing them in the incubation room for 1 night (temperature set at 28 °C).\nInoculation and monitoring of fermentations",
    "Grow S. cerevisiae strain in sterile tubes containing 10 mL of YPD medium at 28 °C with shaking (150 rpm) for 12 h. Then, pipet 1 mL of YPD preculture and transfer it to 10 mL of SM medium (in 15 mL sterile tubes). Incubate the culture for 12 h at 28 °C with shaking (150 rpm).\nUnder laminar flow, collect a preculture aliquot and quantify the cell population using an electronic particle counter that is fitted with a 100 µm aperture. Centrifuge the preculture (2,000 x g, 15 min, 4 °C) and suspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of sterile water to obtain a final concentration of 2.5 x 108 cells/mL. Inoculate each fermenter with 1 mL of the cell suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: The robotic system used to monitor the fermentation progress is described in Figure 1.\nPrepare the fermentation platform by installing the fermenters in the support guides that are properly placed on the 21-position stirring plates and set the stirring rate at 270 rpm. To start the on-line monitoring of each fermentation, launch the robot-control application, then click the \"start assay\" button and select the fermentation volume to be carried out (300 mL).\nThe displayed interface permits the indication of the number and the position of fermenters on the platform. To ensure this occurs, right click on the slot location and choose \"enable\" to activate the monitoring of the fermenter located at this position.\nInitialize the calculation software, permanently running on the system, before starting the weight acquisition. Click on the \"Initialiser\" button and validate with \"ok\". Click on the \"Start button\" of the robot-control application to start the weight acquisitions.\nSampling Procedure",
    "NOTE: For each fermenter, samples are taken when the CO2 production (value shown on-line on the computer running the calculation software) reaches the required set-point: 5, 10, 40, and 90 g/L in this study.\n\t\nSampling procedure for cultures with labeled compounds.\nCentrifuge two 6 mL samples (2,000 x g, 5 min, 4 °C). Save and store the frozen supernatants in two aliquots at -80 °C. Wash the pellets twice with 5 mL distilled water and store at -80 °C for the measurement of isotopic enrichments.\nSampling procedure for cultures without labeled compounds\n\t\t\nHarvest 10 mL of culture, which will be used for dry weight determination. Pellet the cells from two 10 mL samples by centrifugation (2,000 x g, 5 min, 4 °C). Wash the pellets twice with 10 mL of distilled water and store them at -80 °C for the determination of protein and amino acid content.\n2. Quantification of Consumed Nitrogen Sources\nEnzymatic determination of residual ammonia concentrations\n\tNOTE: The determination of ammonia concentration in supernatants is carried out using a commercial enzyme-based kit; all the reagents are provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\nPrepare a standard ammonia solution (61.4 mg/L) by dissolving 25 mg of precisely weighed (NH4)2SO4 in a 100 mL volumetric flask.\nTo fulfill the manufacturer's instructions, perform a 1:2 dilution of the samples that were taken before fermentation and at 5 g/L of CO2 released. Adjust the pH of the samples to approximately 8 by adding 1 M KOH. Take note of the added volume and take it into account in the dilution factor.",
    "In 4 mL spectrophotometer cuvettes, mix 100 µL of sample (diluted if necessary), distilled water or standard ammonia solution with 2 mL of reagent 1 (0.75 mM ADP and 30 U/mL glutamate dehydrogenase in pH 7.8 buffer) and 500 µL of reagent 2 (1.3 mM NADH). Incubate for 15 min at room temperature and read NADH absorbance at 340 nm (A1).\nAdd 500 µL of reagent 3 (60 mM α-ketoglutarate in pH 8 buffer), incubate the sample for 20 min at room temperature, and read the NADH absorbance at 340 nm (A2).\nCalculate ammonia concentration using:\n\t\tCammonia (g/L) = 0.083 x [(0.839 x A1 -A2)sample- (0.839 x A1 -A2)distilled water]\nCheck that the correct concentration is obtained with the standard solution.\nChromatographic determination of residual amino acid concentrations\n\tNOTE: The determination of amino acid concentrations in supernatants is achieved using a dedicated amino acid analysis system that is based on ion-exchange chromatography with post column derivatization of N-compounds with ninhydrin, which allows their colorimetric detection.\n\t\nPrepare a reference solution by adding 200 µL of a commercial mixture of neutral and acidic amino acids, 200 µL of a commercial mixture of basic amino acids, and 200 µL of 2.5 mM glutamine to 400 µL of 200 mM lithium citrate buffer, pH 2.2. This chemically defined reference solution is treated as a sample.\nAdd 200 µL of 25% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid solution that contains 2.5 mM norleucine (internal standard) to 800 µL of sample to remove molecules with high molecular weights. Incubate for 1 h at 4 °C, centrifuge (3,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C) and filter through a 0.22-µm pore-size nitrocellulose membrane (syringe system).",
    "In the programmer software, click on the button \"Run\" to begin the liquid chromatography (LC) analyses with the analyzer equipped with a cation-exchange column (lithium form). Elute the amino acids with successive lithium buffers to create both a pH gradient and a gradient in counter-ion concentration in combination with a temperature gradient (Table 2).\nQuantify the nitrogen compounds after ninhydrin derivatization by a spectrophotometric detector at 570 nm (purple coloration: reaction between ninhydrin and amine group of amino acids) and 440 nm (yellow coloration: reaction between ninhydrin and imine group of proline).\nPerform a single-point internal calibration using the reference solution and norleucine as an internal standard to calculate the concentrations of amino acids in the samples using the manufacturer's software.\n3. Quantification of Proteinogenic Amino Acids\nMeasurement of dry cell weight\nFilter 10 mL of culture through a nitrocellulose filter (pore size 0.45 µm) that is pre-weighed in an aluminum cup, using a vacuum device. Wash twice with 50 mL of distilled water.\nPlace the filter in the aluminum cup and dry in a heat oven at 105 °C for 48 h (until no further change in weight is observed) before reweighing the filter in the cup. Calculate the weight difference.\nCalculate the average of at least 3 independent measurements to accurately determine the dry cell weight of the yeast culture.\nQuantification of protein content of cells\n\tNOTE: The quantification of the protein fraction of the cells is performed at least in triplicate using unlabeled cell pellets that were obtained as described in section 1.3.2.\n\t\nExtract proteins by addition of 1 mL of DMSO solution (50 % v/v) to frozen pellets and incubate at 105 °C for 1 h in a dry heat oven.",
    "Quantify the protein content in the DMSO extracts using the biochemical colorimetric assay that is based on the reduction by proteins of Cu++ into Cu+ ions that are further precipitated by bicinchoninic acid in a blue complex (BCA assay).\nDetermination of the relative contributions of amino acids within proteins\n\tNOTE: The profile of proteinogenic amino acids is determined at least in triplicate from unlabeled cell pellets (1.3.2.).\n\t\nPrepare an oxidized extract by suspending the cell pellet in 200 µL of performic acid (90% formic acid, 10% hydrogen peroxide). Incubate for 4 h at 4 °C and stop the reaction by the addition of 33.6 mg sodium sulfate.\n\t\tNOTE: The oxidation step is required to convert cysteine and methionine into methionine sulfone and cysteic acid, which will be further quantified by ion-exchange chromatography. However, some amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, and arginine) are denatured during oxidation treatment. Consequently, two hydrolysates (with and without oxidation) are prepared.\nAdd 800 µL of 6N HCl to cell pellets or oxidized extract and incubate the sample in a hermetically sealed glass tube for 16 h at 110 °C in a dry heat oven. Add 200 µL of 2.5 mM norleucine and remove HCl with a stream of nitrogen. Wash (resuspending the dried extract and then removing the liquid with a nitrogen stream) twice with 800 µL of distilled water and then with 800 µL of ethanol. Take up in 800 µL of 200 mM lithium acetate buffer, pH 2.2.\n\t\tNOTE: Attention should be paid to the incubation time for the hydrolysis as some amino acids are not stable under acidic conditions. The tryptophan fraction in protein is estimated from data found in the literature16, as this amino acid is entirely denatured during HCl hydrolysis.",
    "Prepare a hydrolysate standard for the single-point internal calibration. Add 160 µL of a commercial solution of hydrolyzed amino acids to 840 µL of 200 mM lithium acetate buffer, pH 2.2, that contains 625 µM methionine sulfone, 625 µM cysteic acid, and 625 µM norleucine.\nDetermine the relative concentrations of amino acids within proteins using the chromatographic method described in section 2.2.\nCalculations\nCalculate the weight percentage of each amino acid in proteins by dividing the measured amount of each amino acid (mg/L) by the total amount of amino acid that was measured in the protein extract (sum in mg/L).\nMultiply this percentage by the concentration of proteins in the culture (mg/L), i.e., the product between the protein content of the biomass and the dry weight, to assess the concentration of each proteinogenic amino acid in the culture (mg/L).\n4. Measurement of Isotopic Enrichment of Proteinogenic Amino Acids\nNOTE: For the measurement of isotopic enrichment of proteinogenic amino acids, use the labeled cell pellets. Three different agents are used for the derivatization step to quantify the isotopic enrichment of amino acids. The intensities of cluster ions are measured to estimate the labeling patterns of the amino acids. The signal from each cluster ion corresponds to the abundance of the mass isotopomers (m0 = without labeling, m+1 = 1 labeled atom, …) of an amino acid fragment. An example of a chromatogram that is obtained after the DMADMF procedure is provided in Figure 2.\nBiomass hydrolysis\nHydrolyze the cell pellets (corresponding to 1-2 mg of dried biomass) by adding 1.2 mL of 6 M HCl and incubating the sample for 16 h at 105 °C in tightly closed glass tubes in a dry heat oven.",
    "Add 1.2 mL of distilled water and centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. Distribute the supernatant into six 400 µL fractions in open glass tubes. Dry the fractions in a heat oven at 105 °C until they reach the consistency of syrup (4-5 h).\nEthylchloroformate (ECF) derivatization\nDissolve the dried hydrolysate in 200 µL of 20 mM HCl; then, add 133 µL of pyridine:ethanol (1:4). Add 50 µL of ECF to derivatize the amino acids and wait until all CO2 has been released. Transfer the mixture to centrifuge tubes that contain 500 µL of dichloromethane to extract the derivatized compounds.\nVortex the tubes for 10 s and centrifuge them for 4 min at 10,000 x g; collect the lower organic phase with a Pasteur pipet and transfer to GC vials that contain conical glass inserts so that the samples may be directly injected into the GC/MS instrument.\n(N,N)-Dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) derivatization.\nDissolve the dried hydrolysate in 50 µL of methanol and 200 µL of acetonitrile. Add 300 µL of DMFDMA. Vortex the tube and transfer the samples to GC autosampler vials that contain conical glass inserts.\nN,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) derivatization\nSuspend the hydrolysate in 200 µL of acetonitrile. Add 200 µL of BSTFA, hermetically close the glass tube and incubate for 4 h at 135 °C before transferring the extract directly to GC vials.\nGC-MS analysis\nAnalyze samples with a gas chromatograph that is equipped with an autosampler injector and is coupled to a mass spectrometer.\n\t\t\nUse instrument-specific software to control the instrument and analyze the chromatograms. In the \"Sequence\" menu, click the \"Sample Log Table\" to create the sample list, and click the \"Run\" button to start the injections.",
    "NOTE: The gas chromatograph is fitted with a 30 m x 0.25 mm apolar silica capillary column with a 0.15 μm film thickness. Set the mass spectrometer quadrupole temperature at 150 °C and hold the transfer line at 250 °C for all the analyses. Three analytical programs, each one specific to each derivatization agent, are used.\nECF derivatives: Use helium as the mobile phase with a flow of 1.2 mL/min. Set the temperature of the inlet at 230 °C and that of the source at 250 °C. Program the autosampler to inject 1 µL of samples with a split ratio of 3:1. Run the analyses, gradually increasing the oven temperature as follows: 130 °C for 3 min; gradient of 15 °C/min to 260 °C; maintain temperature at 260 °C for 20 min.\nDMFDMA derivatives: Use helium as the mobile phase with a constant flow of 1.2 mL/min. Set the temperature of the inlet at 230 °C and that of the source at 250 °C. Program the autosampler to inject 1 µL of samples with a split ratio of 3:1.

    "Detection procedure: For each mode of derivatization, inject a sample (1 µL) in SCAN mode with positive electron impact ionization at 70 eV and take note of the retention time of each amino acid.\nUse these values to define the time windows throughout the chromatogram and for the different selected ions, which are characteristic of each amino acid and listed in Table 3; these values should be included for each amino acid. Include this information in the SIM detection program and run the analyses in SIM mode with positive electron impact ionization at 70 eV.\nCollect the outcomes of the analyses; namely, for each amino acid, record a cluster of intensities that correspond to its different mass isotopomers. Process the data using the dedicatedsoftware17 to correct for natural labeling and calculate the isotopic enrichment of the proteinogenic amino acids (defined as the labeled fraction of an amino acid with respect to its total amount in the protein samples).\n\t\tNOTE: The isotopic enrichment of a molecule (I.E.), expressed as a percentage, is calculated dividing the sum of the corrected intensities of the mass isotopomers with labeling (m1, m2, …mn) by the sum of the corrected intensities of all the mass isotopomers (m0, m1, m2,… mn):\n\t\tI. E. = (m1 + m2 + …+ mn) / (m0 + m1+ m2 + …+ mn)\n5. Quantification and Isotopic Enrichment of Volatile Compounds\nExtraction of labeled volatile compounds",
    "Add 10 µL of deuterated internal standards to 5 mL of supernatant (final concentration of deuterated compounds: 100 µg/L) in a 15 mL glass tube.

    "Use an external 7-point calibration to quantify the concentrations of volatile molecules from the sums of the intensities of the corresponding ion cluster. Prepare stock solutions of each compound (10 g/L) in 100% ethanol. Then, prepare standard solutions for each class of volatile molecules (ethyl esters, acetates, alcohols, and acids) by mixing stock solutions. Finally, dilute different amounts of the standard solutions in a 12% hydroalcoholic solution containing 5 g/L tartaric acid with the pH adjusted to 3.3 to prepare calibration solutions.\nIn parallel, correct for the natural labeling of the intensities of each ion cluster and calculate the isotopic enrichment of volatile compounds, which is defined as the labeled fraction of the molecules and is expressed as a percentage using the dedicated software17.\n6. Calculations for an Integrated Analysis of the Dataset\nCollection of the raw data\nUsing the spreadsheets shown in Tables 5, 6, 7, and 8, enter the raw data values that correspond to the concentration of extracellular amino acids, cell dry weight, protein content of cells, concentration of volatile molecules, and isotopic enrichment of proteinogenic amino acids and volatile molecules.\n\t\tNOTE: The data shown in tables are expressed in mM. All the results are also expressed in mg/L by multiplying the values in mM by the molecular weight of each molecule or in mg N/L by multiplying the millimolar concentration of a proteinogenic amino acid by the atomic mass of nitrogen (14 u) and by the number of nitrogen atoms that are provided by the catabolism of this molecule.\nCalculate the mass percentage of each amino acid in proteins by dividing its amount in mg/L in the hydrolysate by the total amount of amino acids (their sum in mg/L).",
    "Calculate means, standard deviations, and standard errors of the mean from the data that were obtained in the independent experiments.\nCalculate the proteinogenic concentration (mg/L) for each amino acid by multiplying the percentage of this amino acid in proteins (mg aa/g proteins) by the protein fraction in the biomass (g proteins/g DW) and the dry weight content (biomass production) in the medium (g DW/L).\n15N isotopic tracer experiments\nUsing the spreadsheets that are presented in Table 9, calculate the labeled and unlabeled fractions of nitrogen that are present in the proteinogenic amino acids (expressed in mg N/L) from their total concentrations (expressed in mg N/L) and their isotopic enrichments. For each amino acid, the labeled fraction corresponds to the product between its total concentration and its isotopic enrichment, and the unlabeled part is the difference between the total and the labeled amounts.\nThen, determine the fraction of total nitrogen in proteins that is contained in the proteinogenic amino acids quantified in this study by summing the total amount of Ala, Gly, Val, Asp, Phe, Leu, Ile, Thr, Ser, Pro, Lys, His, Glu and Arg (in mg N/L) and dividing the total amount of nitrogen contained in proteins by this sum.\nCalculate the nitrogen provided by arginine, glutamine or ammonium that was recovered in the proteinogenic acids quantified in this study by summing the labeled fraction (in mg N/L) of proteinogenic amino acids that were quantified in the study (Ala, Gly, Val, Asp, Phe, Leu, Ile, Thr, Ser, Pro, Lys, His, Glu, and Arg) during experiments in the presence of 15N-labeled arginine, glutamine, or ammonium and dividing this labeled-nitrogen fraction by the total amount of nitrogen in the quantified proteinogenic amino acids.",
    "Assess the contribution of the 3 most abundant amino acids to the intracellular pool of nitrogen used for de novo biosynthesis by combining data from the 13C and 15N isotope tracer experiments (spreadsheet in Table 7).\nFrom the total amount (expressed in mM) of proteinogenic Val, Leu, Ile, or Thr, deduct the part derived from the direct incorporation of consumed compounds (13C experiments) and the part that was de novo synthetized using nitrogen from the 3 major sources in order to assess the fraction that was de novo synthetized using nitrogen from the other amino acids.\nThen, calculate the ratio of the amount of amino acid de novo synthetized using nitrogen provided by Gln, Arg, and NH4+ (sum expressed in mM) to the total amount of proteinogenic amino acids (in mM) to quantify the contribution of arginine, glutamine, and ammonium to the intracellular nitrogen pool.\n13C isotopic tracer experiments\nCalculate the labeled and unlabeled fractions of the proteinogenic amino acids from concentrations expressed in mM and isotopic enrichments of proteinogenic amino acids that were obtained during experiments in the presence of 13C-labeled Leu, Val, Ile or Thr.
