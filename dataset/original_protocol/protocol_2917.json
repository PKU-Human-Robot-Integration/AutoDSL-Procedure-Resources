In standard assays, cells are inoculated in microtitre plates, and biofilms eventually assemble at the surface-air-liquid interface.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Biofilms are stained to measure the extent and robustness of their formation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] We adapted these methods to grow biofilms on microscope cover glass from a mixture of cells containing either red or green fluorescence. Our modifications make biofilms formed through these assays amenable for high-magnification, cellular-scale imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2663-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of standardized hydrostatic assay for biofilm formation in microtitre plates\nGrow biofilms using 96-well microtitre plate static assays.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nFill wells of microtitre plates with 200 μL of fresh LB containing 1:10 dilution of overnight cultures, such that green and red fluorescent cells are mixed in a 1:10 ratio (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). This initial inoculum can be diluted as desired.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2663-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration of modifications to standardized assay to image cellular arrangement in biofilms\nNote: 1:10 mixture of fluorescent cells is beneficial as the color added in higher concentration serves as the background to make patterns for clonal cell organization within biofilms evident. Ratio of the different color fluorescent cells could be varied as desired.",
    "Note: Alternatively, cells without fluorescence can be used as background, and red and green fluorescent cells could be added in lower amounts to visualize clonal cell arrangements (this case is illustrated in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). When including cells without fluorescent reporters, it is important to not use antibiotic while inoculating biofilms so that the cells without plasmids are not affected. As cells without plasmids may not have antibiotic resistance, antibiotics should not be used when the biofilm inoculum contains non-resistant cells.\nNote: A lower dilution factor can be used for the inoculum for growing biofilms. Since our investigation also utilized mutant strains that relied on aggregation, we used a more concentrated inoculum to increase robustness of mutant biofilms for comparison of their structures to wild type.\nCarefully break 18 × 18 mm cover glass into pieces big enough to fit inside the wells of a microtitre plate.\nNote: In the study, we broke cover glass into pieces by taking 3–4 cover glass squares at a time and using a glass slide as a solid support to break them into smaller, approximately rectangular pieces. Glass cutting tools can also be used if desired. We recommend sterilizing cover glass pieces by autoclaving.\nNote: We recommend preparing 3–5 replicates.\nNote: Alternatively, cover glass pieces can also be inserted in wider wells, e.g., 6-well plates. Wells should be filled such that the liquid covers at least three quarters of the height of these wells.\nInsert cover glass pieces perpendicularly inside the wells for the biofilm to grow on. Use tweezer when handling cover glass pieces (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2663-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) Prepared 96-well plate for biofilm growth. Inset depicts cover glass pieces inserted in wells for the biofilm to grow on. Plates were loosely covered with a lid and incubated at 37°C.\n(B) Image of cover glass with biofilm prepared for imaging. Cover glass pieces taken out from wells were placed on a glass slide and a 22 × 50 mm cover glass was fixed on top by taping the edges.\nIncubate plates overnight (16–24 h) or for desired duration for biofilm formation without shaking at 37°C.\nNote: Though this protocol is optimized for biofilm growth of E. coli cells in LB media, different cells and media conditions can be tested through these methods.\nCritical: It is important prevent movement and disturbances during incubation. Unwanted vibrations could disrupt the assembling biofilm. It is best to leave the plate undisturbed in a stationary incubator for biofilm growth.\nCritical: It is essential to prevent evaporation of liquid during biofilm growth. For this, we used custom plastic lids to cover plates while incubating them overnight. The lids were lightly placed to cover but not seal the plates. They were high enough so as to not disturb the cover glass pieces. We also placed a water bath in the incubator to increase hydration.\nCritical: When preparing the cover glass, appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid injury from sharp glass pieces. We recommend using gloves, cut resistant guards for fingers, eye shield, and lab coat while preparing cover glass pieces for biofilm growth. Remaining glass pieces should be disposed with broken glass waste.\nSample preparation for biofilm imaging\nTiming: ∼30 min (depending on the number of samples)",
    "As expected in static approaches, biofilms assemble at the air-liquid interface on the cover glass pieces inserted in wells of microtitre plate. The following steps are optimized for sample preparation for imaging biofilms formed on the cover glass.\nUsing a tweezer, carefully take out the cover glass piece from a well.\nNote: The submerged part of the cover glass corresponds to the liquid region and the part of the cover glass not in the liquid corresponds to the air region. The biofilm is formed and distinctly visible at the air-liquid interface.\nLay this cover glass piece flat on a fresh glass slide. Label the glass slide with any necessary cell names or conditions that are being tested.\nCover the glass piece with formed biofilm using a fresh 22 × 50 mm microscope cover glass.\nNote: This step is necessary to cover the glass piece containing the biofilm so that it can be imaged on a microscope.\nFix the 22 × 50 mm cover glass on the glass slide by taping its edges (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCritical: In step 8, before placing a fresh cover glass to cover the glass piece with biofilm, we recommend waiting for at least a minute for the excess liquid to dry. Spreading of liquid over the entire cover glass piece could confound biofilm imaging.\nCritical: In step 8, we recommend applying the fresh 22 × 50 mm cover glass at ∼45° angle, starting from the air to the liquid portion of the cover glass piece with biofilm. This would prevent spreading of unwanted liquid phase cells over the biofilm and air regions, which could confound imaging.\nHigh magnification biofilm imaging\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on the number of samples)",
    "Following steps outline the procedure for high magnification imaging of biofilms formed on the cover glass pieces prepared in the previous section. We used Leica DMi8 microscope with a DIC HCPL APO 63X oil immersion objective, equipped with 1.6× magnification changer, Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera, and Lumencore Spectra-X light engine. This system allowed for wide-field imaging of biofilms in differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence (red and green channels) imaging modalities. Confocal microscopy could also be applied to resolve the 3D structure of these communities.\nSet up glass slide, prepared in steps 6–9, on the microscope for imaging.\nAfter focusing, capture a wide-field view of the biofilms using red and green fluorescence channels. Image biofilms at high magnification to resolve their structures at the cellular level.\nNote: We overlaid images captured using the red and green fluorescence channels using LASX software to visualize clonal internal structure of the biofilm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). We recommend capturing images at 100× resolution. We also used DIC to image biofilms in bright field.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2663-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Imaging cellular arrangement in biofilms\n(A) Representative image of biofilm imaged through the described procedure. Biofilms were inoculated from a 1:10 mixture of cells with fluorescence (red and green combined in equal amounts; green is represented with cyan in this image) and cells with no fluorescence.\n(B and C) Highlighted region is magnified in (B) (multi-fluorescence) and (C) (bright field). The altered cell-mixing ratio for this biofilm illustrates the case described in the notes, where the inoculum contains cells with no fluorescence (in higher amounts) and fluorescence (in lower amounts; containing an equal ration of red and green fluorescent cells). In this case, cells without fluorescence served as background to visualize red and green (depicted in cyan here) cellular chains.\nImaging of clonal communities detached from growing biofilms",
    "Timing: ∼1 h (depending on the number of samples)\nThe following part of the protocol outlines methods to image unattached biofilm cells and/or clonal structures.\nUsing a tweezer, take a piece of cover glass with formed biofilm out of the well of microtitre plate.\nHold the cover glass perpendicularly over an agarose pad8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] made of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nWash the biofilm by pipetting ∼50 μL (or desirable volume depending on size of substrate) of PBS over the cover glass. Let the liquid run-off from washing fall on the agarose pad.\nCover the agarose pad with a fresh piece of microscope cover glass. Image using DIC and fluorescence (red and green channels) imaging modalities to analyze the washed biofilm (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2663-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Clonal communities washed from biofilm\n(A) Illustration of procedure for washing biofilms.\n(B and C) Representative image of clonal communities washed off of a biofilm: (B) wider field of view of the agarose pad and (C) a higher magnification example. Biofilm was grown from a 1: 10 mixture of cells containing green (represented as cyan here) and red fluorescence respectively. Washing procedure is described in steps 12–15.\nNote: Excitation and emission for fluorescence microscopy was performed at 470 nm and 500–550 nm for green fluorescence and 510 nm and 592–668 nm for red fluorescence, respectively. Fluorescent exposures were 30 ms at 30% intensity."
