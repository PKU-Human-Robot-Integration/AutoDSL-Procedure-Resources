  "procedures": [
    "All the procedures and protocols involving animals were in accordance with EC Directive 86/609/EEC and ratified by ComEth, the French national committee for consideration of ethics in animal experimentation (protocol 11-0043). The animals were housed and cared for in ANSES’s approved experimental facilities in Lyon (approval B 69387 0801).\n1. Preparation of Mice\nEuthanize mice by an intraperitoneal injection of lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital.\nRetrieve the whole brain from the mouse skull and place it in a 35 mm plastic Petri dish on ice until extraction.\nExtract the cervical spinal cord.\nNOTE: Extract αS either from one of the brain halves after sagittal sectioning or from dissected mouse brains, available after the experiments listed in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nExperiment,Mice Inoculum (brain equivalent),Survival period (d.p.i.),Median/maximal survival (days old),αSd detection by ELISA  /WB/IHC\n1,Uninoculated mice,441 ± 166,419/736,8/8\n2,Inoculated mice (0.2 mg),150 ± 52,140/241,9/9\nTable 1. List of experiments performed on M83 mice. Inoculations were performed at 6 weeks for experiment 2 in the striato-cortical area with 20 µl of a brain homogenate of a sick mouse (1% wt/vol in glucose 5%), after anesthesia of 6 weeks old homozygous M83 mice by 3% isoflurane inhalation. d.p.i.: days post inoculation.\n2. αS Extraction from Brain Halves\nSagittally cut the brain to obtain two halves. Weigh each half in a ribolysis tube containing grinding balls.\nPrepare High Salt (HS) buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 750 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails. Add High Salt buffer to the brain halves to obtain 20% (weight/volume) homogenates.\nPrepare samples from the brain halves using a mechanical homogenizer at 6.0 m/s for 23 sec twice. After the first 23 sec homogenization, place the tubes containing the homogenates on ice for 2 min before the second 23-sec cycle.",
    "Centrifuge the samples at 1,000 x g for 5 min to eliminate unground brain fragments. Recover the supernatants, divide into 200 µl aliquots and keep them at -80 °C for subsequent ELISA analysis.\n3. αS Extraction from Dissected Brain Regions\nDissect a whole brain in a 35 mm plastic Petri dish on ice with a low power magnifier (8X magnification) using two forcipes whose ends are kept together except when dissecting the hippocampus. Do not exceed 10 min to preserve brain integrity. Place the brain right side up and retrieve the following brain regions in this order:\n\t\nSeparate one of the two olfactory bulbs using forceps placed just behind the bulb. Detach it from the brain by a downwards movement. Repeat this operation for the second bulb.\nGently wedge the forceps in between the two cortexes and move it forwards to facilitate dissociation of the two cortexes. Keeping the brain in place with one forceps, use another to separate the cortex from the hippocampus.\nPosition the forceps 2 mm below the cortex. Maintain a gentle pressure on the forceps until the top of the hippocampus is visible. Peel off the first part of the cortex, and repeat with the second part. Use the forceps to separate the two cortexes starting at the hippocampus and moving towards the front of the brain.\nPosition the open forceps around one of the hippocampi. Close the forceps at the bottom of the hippocampus then gently remove it, recovering as much as possible. Repeat the procedure for the second hippocampus.\nPosition the open forceps below one of the striata and gently separate it from the brain. Use the forceps to remove any remaining cortex from the striatum. Repeat this procedure for the second striatum.",
    "Use the forceps to gently depress by 2 mm the contour of the cerebellum to facilitate separation of the cerebellum from the brain. Place the forceps just behind the cerebellum and remove it by moving the forceps forward.\nUse the wide part of the forceps to raise the mesencephalon in order to clearly see where it joins the brain stem. Make a vertical incision at the junction then remove the brain stem.\nPosition the forceps behind the mesencephalon, which is composed of four rounded structures. Incise vertically until the mesencephalon has been completely separated from the remaining brain.\nPrepare homogenates of variable % (weight/volume) in HS buffer, depending on the quantity of available tissues, i.e., 5% homogenate for a weight between 10 and 30 mg, 10% for a weight between 30 and 80 mg, and 20% for a weight above 80 mg.\n\t\nAdd an adequate volume of HS buffer to the dissected brain regions to obtain the expected % of homogenate.\nVortex and check that the tissues are fully immersed in the HS buffer.\nHomogenize samples prepared from the dissected brain regions or the cervical spinal cord with a tissue grinder composed of a borosilicate glass tube and two pestles, A and B.\nPour each brain region to be crushed directly into the tube. Insert pestle A into the tube and retract it. Repeat this movement about ten times to dissociate the tissue. Then use pestle B to continue grinding the tissue with a further 20 movements. Transfer the homogenates into a 1.5 ml tube with a 1 ml transfer pipette.\nCentrifuge the samples at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to eliminate any unground brain fragments. Retrieve the supernatants, divide them up into 200 µl aliquots and keep them at -80 °C for subsequent ELISA analysis.",
    "4. Detection of αS by ELISA\nDilute the coating antibodies to 0.01 ng/ml. Use either anti-αS rabbit polyclonal or monoclonal clone 42 antibody in 50 mM Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.6).\nCoat the 96-well microplates with 100 µl per well of this coating solution, and leave at 4 °C O/N. Use the anti-αS rabbit polyclonal antibody in the coating solution for ELISAs using detection antibodies syn514, clone 42, LB509, AS11, 4D6 or 8A5. Use the anti-αS monoclonal antibody clone 42 as a coating solution in combination with the anti-pSer129 αS detection antibody.\nNOTE: If necessary, the plates may be kept at 4 °C for one week before the ELISA is performed.\nUse a plate washer to wash the plates five times with 300 µl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) per well. From this step onward, incubation is at RT.\nAdd 200 µl of T20 PBS blocking buffer per well. Shake for 1 hr at 150 rpm. Wash the plates five times with PBST.\nDilute the brain homogenates (dilution 1:100 of the 20% homogenates, 1:50 of the 10% homogenates and 1:25 of the 5% homogenates in PBST BSA 1%), and add 100 µl to each well. Then incubate for 2 hr while shaking at 150 rpm. Wash the plates five times with PBST.\nAdd the different αS detection antibodies in PBST with BSA 1% at the dilutions mentioned in the Materials List. Incubate for 1 hr at 150 rpm. Wash the plates five times with PBST.\nAdd either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugates diluted 1:8,000 in PBST supplemented with BSA 1% for 1 hr while shaking at 150 rpm. Wash the plates five times with PBST.",
    "Add 100 µl of 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution to each well and incubate for 15 min in the dark while shaking at 150 rpm.\nStop the reaction by adding 100 µl of 1 N HCl per well then measure the absorbance at 450 nm with the microplate reader.\nFor data analysis, subtract the OD value obtained in a well with all the reagents except any mouse brain samples (blank well) from the OD values measured for each of the analyzed samples.\n5. Epitope Mapping\nPerform epitope mapping according to the method described by Osman16. Briefly, spot peptides of the human α-synuclein sequence containing 12 amino acids on nitrocellulose with 10 overlapping amino acids.\nBlock with 50 mM Tris/150 mM NaCl buffer pH 10 containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% milk powder. Incubate the antibody in blocking solution at a concentration of 2 µg antibody per ml at 2-10 °C O/N.\nWash the membrane three times using 50 mM Tris/150 mM NaCl buffer pH 10 containing 0.05% Tween 20. Incubate with the goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate. Wash the membrane another five times using the same buffer then stain using a Western blot TMB staining kit.\n6. Statistical Analysis\nUse the R software and nlme package to perform mixed-effects regressions to model OD. For each comparison, perform a mixed effect regression model. Use a fixed effect to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic groups.\nUse a random effect to reflect the variability of repetitions for a given mouse. Check homoscedasticity by examining the residuals and if needed, use the variance functions to model the variance structure of within-group errors in keeping with Pinheiro and Bates17. Set 0.05 as the significance threshold of P.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
