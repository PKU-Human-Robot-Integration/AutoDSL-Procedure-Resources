    "1. Covalent coupling of the peptide to NHS-PEG-DSPE\nDissolve the c(RGDfK) peptide with the primary ε-aminogroup of lysine unprotected and available for coupling, in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 10 mg/mL). Prepare a methanol or chloroform solution of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of poly(ethyleneglycol)-3400-distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NHS-PEG-DSPE, 200 mg/mL), and add to 1 mg of peptide in DMSO. Add 3 μL of N,N-diisopropyl ethylamine (DIPEA).\n\t\nMaintain a peptide-to-NHS-PEG-DSPE molar ratio at least 1:1.2, so that all the primary amino groups will be able to react. Maintain a DIPEA:peptide molar ratio at least 2:1 to assure basic media conditions.\n\t\tCAUTION: Chloroform, methanol and DIPEA are hazardous materials. Use proper protection, such as gloves, labcoat, goggles and fume hood.\n\t\tNOTE: Any other peptide or mimetic with a primary amino group can be used instead of c(RGDfK), with unprotected N-terminus or a lysine located outside of the binding site. For the reaction to proceed, all the components (i.e., targeting ligand and lipid) must be soluble in DMSO-chloroform mixture. Alternative solvents, such as dimethylformamide, or its mixtures, may also be tested. Reaction in aqueous media is also possible, but coupling yield will be much lower due to rapid hydrolysis of active ester.\nFollowing overnight incubation at room temperature, remove the volatile organic material by evaporation (use stream of nitrogen gas or a rotary evaporator, followed by overnight evaporation under a high vacuum pump, to remove DMSO). Redissolve the nonvolatile residue in chloroform at 1 mg/mL for controlled sampling.\nConfirm reaction completion by thin layer chromatography (develop TLC plates in chloroform:methanol solvent media, 2:1 v/v). Confirm presence or absence of the primary amino group with ninhydrin spray upon heating the plate on a 150 °C heating block.",
    "CAUTION: Ninhydrin is hazardous material. Use proper protection, as described above. Heating block treatment of TLC plates must be performed in a fume hood. The heating block is a potential fire hazard.\nPrior to the microbubble preparation, aliquot a sample of peptide-PEG-DSPE from chloroform (e.g., 1 mL of 1 mg/mL solution), evaporate chloroform to dryness in a stream of nitrogen gas, with subsequent high vacuum pump incubation, and add saline to 1 mg/mL, to achieve transparent micellar solution.\n\t\nIf further purification of the reaction mixture is desirable, redissolve in normal saline. Then subject the resulting micellar mixture to dialysis (6-8 kDa molecular weight cut-off, or similar), first against normal saline, and then against several changes of deionized water.\nConfirm completion of dialysis by a conductivity check of dialysate. Remove dialyzed material from the dialysis bag, place in a vial with known mass, and lyophilize until complete dryness.\n\t\tNOTE: An alternative covalent reaction to attach the ligand to the terminus of PEG-lipid is available (e.g., a reaction of maleimide-PEG-DSPE with thiol-ligand). The main advantage of this approach is oriented coupling, if a single thiol is available on the ligand molecule 7. The main concern is long-term stability: the resulting link between maleimide and thiol may be prone to degradation by a retro-Michael reaction, depending on storage conditions 8.",
    "NOTE: Quality of active ester reagents greatly varies between the manufacturers: it may depend on the transfer and storage conditions (if the material is not stored or transported properly, the active ester will hydrolyze and will not be able to couple with the peptide). Consequently, there is a feeling of obligation to describe a procedure (see below) for the determination of the degree of degradation of NHS-PEG-DSPE, a reagent for covalent attachment of targeting ligands to microbubbles. NHS-PEG-DSPE, supplied as dry powder under argon, is stored in deep freeze. A vial is brought to room temperature (to avoid moisture condensation), a sample weighed, using analytical balance, and dissolved in methanol or DMSO. A vial with bulk dry reagent should be closed under argon and returned to deep freeze, in a sealed container with desiccant, until further use.\nPrepare an aqueous micellar solution of peptide-PEG-DSPE (Step 1.4), as well as biotin-PEG-DSPE, by simple addition of dry reagent to aqueous saline, and incubation. Small spherical micelles are formed. To accelerate the transfer of the reagent from bulk state to the micellar form, sonication and hot water bath can be applied.\nAssess the reagent quality of NHS-PEG-DSPE active ester.\n\t\nConfirm that NHS present in the reagent is in the form of active ester, to be able to perform the coupling reaction with amide bond formation.\nPlace 0.99 mL of 0.1 M sodium tetraborate buffer, pH 9.2, in a quartz or ultraviolet-transparent plastic cuvette (not glass) in a spectrophotometer, and zero at 260 nm wavelength.\nAdd 10 μL of the freshly prepared 200 mg/mL solution of NHS-PEG-DSPE in methanol to the cuvette. At the same time, start the stopwatch. Rapidly and vigorously mix the cuvette content to achieve uniformity. Place the cuvette in the photometer, close the lid, and start the measurement.",
    "At the start of the spectrophotometer measurement, mark the time of the beginning of the recording, and continuously perform photometric absorbance measurements at 260 nm every 10 s for ~10 min, or until the stabilization of absorbance value.\nPlot the kinetic curve, check initial A260 time points, and extrapolate the curve to the reaction start time (i.e., find out A260 at the point where reagent was added to aqueous buffer and hydrolysis reaction has started). Assume that prior to the addition of NHS-PEG-DSPE to the buffer in the cuvette no hydrolysis had taken place in organic solvent due to lack of water.\nCompute the ratio between A260 at the start of the reaction and at the completion of the hydrolysis; it represents the fraction of the degraded active ester. Use this information to select the proper amount of NHS-PEG-DSPE for the complete modification of the primary amino group of the peptide.\n2. Preparation of microbubbles by amalgamation\nPreparation of biotinylated microbubbles\n\t\nCo-dissolve distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and PEG stearate in propylene glycol (PG, 10 mg/mL concentration for each in neat solvent). Use a hot water bath to solubilize the materials.\nAdd 0.1 mL of this hot PG solution to a vial containing 0.85 mL of hot normal saline, rapidly mix, and add micellar biotin-PEG-DSPE (50 μL, 1 mg/mL in saline) at a 1:20 mass ratio to DSPC.\n\t\tNOTE: Solubility of lipid components in PG is temperature-dependent, so a hot water bath is necessary. It is helpful to heat the glass vial containing saline in a hot water bath prior to lipid addition, to create a uniform medium without visible particles.",
    "Bring the vial to room temperature, place a rubber stopper on the vial, inserted halfway, and insert PTFE capillary tubing in the vial. Use the flow of decafluorobutane gas to fill the vial, and then close the stopper, while removing the capillary.\n\t\tNOTE: The temperature of the vial during amalgamation may have a significant effect on the size distribution of the resulting microbubbles 9.\nCrimp the stoppered vial, at room temperature, and place in an amalgamator apparatus. Start the amalgamator. The clinical unit used is preset to operate at 4300 rpm for 45 seconds.\nWhen amalgamation is completed, remove the vial with the resulting microbubbles from the amalgamator. Preferably, characterize the microbubble size distribution and composition and use them within several hours of preparation.\nPreparation of peptide-decorated microbubbles\n\t\nCo-dissolve DSPC and PEG stearate in neat PG (10 mg/mL concentration for each material). Use a hot water bath to solubilize. Add 0.1 mL of this hot solution in PG to a vial containing 0.85 mL of hot normal saline, rapidly mix, and add micellar peptide-PEG-DSPE (50 µL, 1 mg/mL in saline) added at a 1:20 mass ratio to DSPC.\nBring the vial to room temperature, place a rubber stopper on top of the vial, inserted halfway, and insert polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) capillary tubing in the vial. Use the flow of decafluorobutane gas to fill the vial, and then close the stopper, while removing the capillary.\nCrimp the stoppered vial and place in an amalgamator for mixing. The vial with microbubble dispersion is ready in 45 s.\nPreparation of dye lipid microbubbles for assessment of lipid transfer to microbubble shell\n\t\nCo-dissolve DSPC and PEG stearate in neat PG, as described above (use a hot water bath) (10 mg/mL concentration for each material).",
    "Add 0.1 mL of this hot PG solution to a vial with 0.89 mL of hot normal saline, rapidly mix, add 10 μL of DiI dye solution (1 mg/mL in neat PG) and mix. Bring the vial to room temperature.\nFill the vial headspace with decafluorobutane gas as above, stopper the vial, crimp and amalgamate as described above.\n3. Test DiI lipid transfer from the micellar aqueous medium to the bubble shell\nFor the microscopy confirmation that fluorescent lipid material has transferred from the aqueous medium to the microbubble shell, sample an aliquot of microbubbles from the vial through the septum with an insulin syringe.\n\t\nThen add a drop to a glass slide and cover it with a standard coverslip. First dilute it with a droplet of degassed saline.\nPerform microscopy with a video microscope, equipped with a fluorescence epi-illumination, 100x oil objective and high sensitivity video camera.\nTo determine the efficacy of transfer of lipid material from the aqueous saline/PG media to the bubble shell during amalgamation, take a sealed vial of microbubbles, invert it and place it in a conical 50 mL tube.\n\t\nPerform centrifugation in a bucket rotor (10 min, 200 x g). Remove the vial from the centrifuge and keep it inverted.\nInsert a needle of an insulin syringe into the septum of the inverted vial. Aspirate a small volume (~50 μL) of clear infranatant slowly.\n\t\tNOTE: The bevel tip of the needle for infranatant aspiration from the inverted vial after centrifugation must be located as close to the septum as possible, to minimize chances of microbubble intake.",
    "Place the samples of infranatant (2 μL), as well as the samples of the original lipid-PG-saline medium that was used to generate microbubbles (2 μL) in a 96-well plate with 0.1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS):ethanol 1:1 medium with 1% Triton X-100.\nMeasure red fluorescence of DiI dye (555 nm excitation, 620 nm emission) with a fluorescence microplate reader.\n\t\nUse black plates with non-transparent bottom for fluorescence spectroscopy due to lower background and lack of inter-well signal transfer that may become an issue for clear plates.\nEnsure that the fluorescence signal is within the linear calibration range: excessive dye concentration in the wells may lead to light attenuation and under-reported signal.\n\t\t​NOTE: It may sometimes be desirable to remove the residual shell material that remains in the aqueous medium following amalgamation. To do this, after microbubble flotation centrifugation, take all of the infranatant volume out by slow aspiration from the inverted vial, and replace it by degassed normal saline. To avoid excessive change of ambient pressure in the vial due to removal or addition of liquid, insert an additional long needle in the septum to reach the gas phase inside the vial. To maintain the gas phase inside the vial, first, connect the needle to a syringe filled with fluorocarbon gas, to prevent air contact with the microbubble preparation.\n4. Microbubble size distribution adjustment\nUse normal gravity flotation in a static inverted vial to adjust the size distribution of microbubbles, i.e., to remove largest microbubbles quickly and efficiently 5,10.\nTake a vial of microbubbles immediately following preparation as described in Section 2. Invert and place upside down on a stable non-vibrating surface for 15-20 min.",
    "Following this incubation, insert an insulin syringe needle in the septum of the vial, while it is still inverted, and gently collect 300-500 μL of microbubbles from the lower layer.\n\tNOTE: The needle of the syringe must stay close to septum inner surface to avoid collection of larger bubbles present closer to the top of the liquid in the vial.\n\t\nPull back the syringe plunger slowly, to avoid turbulence and hydrostatic expansion of the bubbles in the syringe body. When the collected sample is taken out of the syringe, avoid overpressure to prevent bubble collapse.\nTransfer microbubble dispersion from the syringe to a small volume vial. Then fill with perfluorinated gas, stopper and crimp, for short-term storage, particle counting (see below) and further use.\n\t\nIf sampling is performed directly from the syringe, hold horizontally and rotate to avoid bubble flotation and achieve sample uniformity.\n5. Microbubble size distribution assessment\nUse a particle counter (based on electrozone sensing or light obscuration principle) to assess particle size distribution and concentration. Alternatively, use a hemocytometer and a microscope.\n\t\nBriefly, add a microbubble sample aliquot into normal saline or isotone in a counter chamber (typically, 60-100 mL volume) and count. Compare the microbubble size distributions before and after flotation purification.\n\t\tNOTE: Subject the vial to gentle mixing (not vortexing) immediately prior to sampling, to achieve representative and reproducible measurements. Sample from the center of the tested volume.\nFill a 100 mL beaker with at least 60 mL of 0.9% saline solution diluent, and place it on the stage of the electrozone sending instrument. Lift the stage so that the tube, outer electrode plate, and stirrer, are all completely immersed in the diluent, and the stirrer can rotate.",
    "NOTE: Diluent volume in the beaker can be precisely determined using its mass, with a scale (saline density is close to 1). Alternatively, a metering pump can be used. The electrodes during electrozone sensing study should be fully immersed.\nRecord the diluent electrolyte volume in the unit control software. Electrozone sensing counter is equipped with 50 µm orifice, which allows measurement of particles between 1 and 30 µm in diameter. Perform a background run first; it is expected to have less than 5000 counts in 0.5 mL of diluent as blank. The best background levels can be under 100 counts.\nSet the sample volume in the unit control software, to account for the dilution factor. Add 10-20 µL of the microbubble mixture to the beaker, and perform the second run.\nUse the background size distribution data to account for by the use of the \"subtract background run\" function within the software. Obtain the concentration of the particles in the original microbubble sample as particle number/mL; it includes the dilution factor.\n\t\t\nThe outer surface of the pipet tip might be also covered with bubbles during sampling; make sure to wipe it off prior to inserting the tip into counting medium. Do not touch the pipet tip orifice with a wipe.\nAvoid insufficient dilutions of sample particles during counting, to minimize the issues with coincidence correction, where more than one particle at a time is within the sensor orifice: the system may then underestimate particle concentration.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Orifice diameter for particle counting may vary. Selection of the 50 μm orifice allows detection of microbubbles with the diameter down to 1 μm, yet it is not as prone to clogging as smaller diameter options.",
    "Calibrate the electrozone sensing counter for the same diluent test media (e.g., sterile-filtered normal saline irrigation solution) as is used in actual tests. A laser obscuration alternative to electrozone sensing has the advantage of not needing filtered saline with controlled salt concentration and electrical conductivity.\n6. Test microbubble targeting in vitro in an adhesion/retention assay\nPrepare the biomarker receptor surface for microbubble targeting to Petri dishes.\n\t\nTake polystyrene 35 mm diameter dishes to be used as the target surface. Take advantage of the nonspecific adhesion of proteins to the polystyrene dish surface from normal saline. Use a model protein, streptavidin, for testing of the targeting of biotinylated bubbles that contain biotin-PEG-DSPE as the part of the shell.\nPlace a droplet of streptavidin solution (0.2 mL, 10 μg/mL in PBS) in the center of each Petri dish and cover it with a 22 mm x 22 mm plastic coverslip to allow for even coating of the dish surface. After overnight incubation at 4 °C in an enclosed moist environment to prevent the dish from drying out, remove the coverslips.\nImmediately and exhaustively wash the plates with water, PBS, and block them by incubation with 1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for at least 4 h to minimize nonspecific adhesion of microbubbles to uncoated surface. Use the clean culture dishes blocked with 1.5% BSA as controls.\nAlternatively, use recombinant αVβ3 receptor solution (e.g., at 4 µg/mL in PBS)5 instead of streptavidin. Target microbubbles to this biomarker via cyclic RGD peptide ligand attached to the microbubble shell.\nKeep the dish with deposited target receptor wet: receptor protein may be inactivated if it dries out.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to use carrier-free receptor proteins that do not contain any carrier proteins or surfactants in the medium - their presence will inactivate adhesion.",
    "Adhesion of microbubbles in a small droplet: quickly check targeted adhesion in static conditions.\n\t\nDeposit a droplet of microbubbles (5-20 μL) from underneath onto the target (or control BSA-only) surface in a Petri dish that is inverted upside down. This will bring the bubbles to the receptor-coated surface by flotation.\nAfter 5-10 min incubation of the inverted dish in a moist environment, invert the dish back to a normal position, fill it with PBS and gently rinse to remove free microbubbles. Perform brightfield microscopy to assess targeted adhesion.\nAdhesion of microbubbles on Petri dish surface: perform targeting in a full dish1.\n\t\nTake the dish, which has receptor surface coating, and fill it completely with degassed PBS-BSA buffer (over 10 mL for the 35 mm dish), so that the meniscus of buffer extends over the top of the dish and is held by capillary force. Inject the bubbles (50 μL) into the bulk of the buffer and rapidly mix to achieve homogeneity. Avoid formation of air bubbles during mixing.\nPlace a segment of transparent packaging tape or a culture plate sealer tape, backed with a flat piece of plastic over the dish quickly. Pressure-seal the film to the dish, invert the \"assembly\" and place it upside down for 30 min to allow the microbubbles float upwards, touch the target surface and adhere.\nInvert the sealed dish \"assembly\" back to \"down-side-down\" configuration, remove the seal, and wash away the non-adherent microbubbles by rinsing with degassed buffer solution. Observe targeted microbubbles by microscopy or by ultrasound imaging.",
    "​NOTE: When the inverted sealed dish completely filled with the microbubble dispersion is incubated, it can be placed at a slight angle, so if any large bubbles are present, they will float to the edge of the dish, outside of the center region of interest. Forced rinsing with fast flow coming from a micropipette tip during microscopy can be used to assess how firmly bubbles are adherent to the target (bubbles completely detach from control surface even in slow flow) 11. Degassed buffer is preferable for bubble dilution, because excess of dissolved air will lead to uncontrolled growth of microbubbles.\n7. Test microbubble targeting in vitro: assess dynamic adhesion/retention assays in a parallel plate flow chamber\nNOTE: We test the adhesion of biotinylated bubbles to streptavidin layer with ultrasound imaging.\nUse a commercially available parallel plate flow chamber with a custom-built inverter holder to observe targeted adhesion to a 35 mm Petri dish from flowing medium. After adsorption of target protein to the dish (see 6.1.1), insert the chamber body with preinstalled gasket in the dish and seal it in the holder. Use gaskets with channel height (i.e., gasket thickness) 0.127 mm and channel width 2.5 mm.\n\tNOTE: During the assembly of parallel plate flow chamber, the amount of silicon grease used on the gasket should be minimal. Do not allow grease to get in the channel area: avoid covering the biomarker protein-coated surface with grease. To achieve a proper seal, select 35 mm dishes carefully (see Table of Materials for the chamber and dish information).\nFor the flow chamber assembly, do not screw the cap and frame that holds the dish-flow chamber combination too tightly, to avoid leakage.",
    "Connect the flow tubing to a syringe pump operated in a withdrawal mode, and on the feeder side, connect a thin polyethylene tubing (PE50) to the vial with a dilute microbubble dispersion, subjected to constant mixing with a stir bar via a magnetic stirrer12. Control the wall shear rate (WSR) parameter of the chamber by adjusting the pump volumetric flow rate based on the formula 6Q/bh2, where Q is the flow rate, 'b' is width of the channel, and 'h' is height of the channel.\n\tNOTE: Remove the air bubbles from the entire system prior to perfusion of the microbubble-containing medium or PBS, as any air bubble passing through the channel will dislodge adherent microbubbles from the target surface, and invalidate the experiment. Connection between the flow chamber tubing and the syringe must be properly sealed.\nPrepare a microbubble dispersion by adding a calculated volume of concentrated bubbles to the microbubble reservoir (a 20 mL scintillation vial) to achieve concentration of 106 microbubbles/mL, in PBS buffer with 0.1% BSA. Place the feeder reservoir on a magnetic plate stirrer. Insert a 1 cm x 2 cm magnetic stir bar and stir at ~400 RPM to maintain homogeneity during the course of the study.\nPerform ultrasound imaging of the flow chamber in a water tank13.\n\t\nSubmerge the flow chamber assembly in degassed water and hold it in place by a weight to prevent movement during experiments.\nPlace the imaging probe clamped directly above the channel, and tilt it at a 15° angle backwards, as well as a 5° angle clockwise to minimize specular reflection from the dish surface. Position the flow chamber channel within the imaging plane.",
    "Use the following imaging conditions: 15L8 transducer, contrast-specific imaging mode, dynamic range 50 dB, 7 MHz, Mechanical Index (MI) = 0.18, CPS Gain = 0. Keep the time gain compensation uniform across the entire image.\nPlace the transducer face so it is touching the water surface, not deeply immersed. Alternatively, use a rubber protective sleeve filled with ultrasound gel.\n\t\tNOTE: To warrant reproducible positioning of the flow chamber system for imaging, the markers should be placed on the water basin, or on the ultrasound system screen.\nDraw the microbubble dispersion from the reservoir through the chamber and into the pump for 2 min.\n\t\nSwitch the flow to PBS, to remove non-adherent bubbles from the channel and assess acoustic backscatter of the remaining adherent (targeted) bubbles. To obtain a background image, increase the MI to 1.9 to destroy the adherent bubbles in the ultrasound imaging field of view.\n\t\tNOTE: Microbubble dispersion should be replaced for repeated runs: at high dilution, microbubbles gradually degrade with time.\nExport individual images from the screen recording video stream: before PBS flushing, after flushing, and after destruction, to be imported into ImageJ for offline analysis. Select the region-of-interest (ROI) to exclude the inlet and outlet portions of the chamber. After subtraction of the background ROI signal, quantify the echo intensity as the mean pixel intensity within ROI.",
    "NOTE: As an alternative to ultrasound imaging, the adhesion of microbubbles to the target surface can be observed by video microscopy, when the parallel plate flow chamber assembly in the inverted holder is placed on a stage of a compound microscope, with video recording 5,11,12,14. This is especially useful for imaging targeted adhesion of microbubbles to cell surface biomarker receptors in cell culture, when receptor-expressing cells are grown on the tissue culture dish, and the number of microbubbles bound to each target cell can be counted directly."
