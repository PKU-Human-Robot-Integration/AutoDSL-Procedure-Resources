    "This study was approved by the ethical and scientific review board of our hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. All the treatment procedures were performed by personnel with 10 years of experience in musculoskeletal ultrasound intervention. The operator must have good knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy. The ultrasound machine used here is mentioned in the Table of Materials and has a high-frequency probe.\n1. Instrument setup and patient preparation\nEnter the ID number and the patient's name to save the images.\nSanitize the ultrasound probe using equipment disinfectant wipes. Perform all the procedures with the probe covered with surgical gloves.\nSet the image with the DBRN in the middle of the screen. To do this, perform cross-sectional scanning along the supinator muscle to find the DBRN. Then, rotate 90° to obtain a long-axis section. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, separate the adhesion between the surrounding tissue of the posterior spin muscles and the DBRN.\nAsk the patient to sit and place their arm in a flexed 20° position on the examination bed. Perform ultrasound to check for DBRN adhesion to the surrounding tissue (Figure 1; Video 1).\n2. Ultrasound examination and treatment\nUse complex iodine to disinfect the patient's skin three times, and then place a sterile surgical towel on the patient's arm.\nProvide local anesthesia using a 10 mL aliquot of a mixed solution (5 mL of 2% lidocaine and 5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride) layer by layer until the DBRN surface is reached (Figure 2). The four layers that are anesthetized include the skin, the subcutaneous soft tissue, the brachioradialis, and the superficial supinator muscle. Confirm the anesthetization of each layer using ultrasound guidance, and check that the tip of the needle passes through each layer.",
    "Identify the radial nerve by transversely using the probe at the level of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. The radial nerve is located between the humerus muscle and the brachioradial muscle. Then, move the probe distally to find the deep branch of the radial nerve between the deep and superficial layers of the supinator.\nUse a 5 mL syringe to separate the adhesion between the surrounding tissue of the posterior spin muscles and the DBRN under the continuous ultrasound guidance. Perform needle release from the DBRN distal area to the proximal area. Prick the adhesion tissue back and forth with the tip. Stop when there is resistance between the syringe and the tissues around the DBRN.\nEnsure that the probe and the needle are accurately controlled, keep the tip of the needle visible during the entire operation, and avoid damage to the DBRN.\nAfter the procedure, inject a mixture of 1 mL of corticosteroid (betamethasone) and 2 mL of 2% lidocaine into the superficial area of the DBRN.\nSubscription Required.
