    "All animal studies were approved by the Committee of the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Technion. For this procedure, athymic nude mice were used to avoid immunological rejection. If using another type of mouse, the mice should be shaved prior to the surgical procedure and administration of cyclosporine (or another anti-rejection substitute) is recommended.\n1. Scaffold Preparation and Cell Embedding\nPrepare scaffolds composed of 1:1 mixture of poly-L-lactic-acid (PLLA) and polylactic-co-glycolic-acid (PLGA), in the following manner:\n\t\nDissolve 500 mg of PLLA and 500 mg of PLGA in 10 ml chloroform.\nAdd 0.24 ml of polymer solution to 0.4 g of sodium chloride particles gathered in a Teflon molds. Use a salt diameter of 212-600 µm. Allow the chloroform to evaporate O/N.\nLeach the salt out using distilled water leading to interconnected porous 3D scaffolds.\nCut polymer pieces using a scissors, then soak in 70% ethanol (v/v) for 30 min and wash 3 times in PBS for 2 min before usage.\nPrepare a tri-culture of the following cells in 1:1 endothelial cell medium (EGM-2 supplemented with the components of its bullet kit and muscle cell medium (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2.5% HEPES buffer, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Pen-Strep Solution).\n\t\nUse 0.5 x 106 C2C12 myoblasts, 0.9 x 106 Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and 0.2 x 106 Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF).\nMix the cells together in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 4 min, aspirate the medium and re-suspend the pellet in a mixture of 4 µl ice cold extracellular matrix solution and 4 µl cell medium.",
    "Cut a piece of 10 mm x 7 mm x 1 mm (length x width x thickness) PLLA/PLGA scaffold and seed the cell suspension in a 6-well plate, allow the extracellular matrix solution to solidify (30 min, 37 °C, 5% CO2) before adding 4 ml cell medium.\nIncubate the scaffolds for ten days before implantation and replace the medium every other day.\n2. Before Starting the Surgical Procedure\nPrepare and sterilize (autoclave) the following surgical tools: a small, fine, straight scissors, a spring scissors, a straight, fine-tipped forceps, a serrated forceps and a needle holder.\nPrepare a mixture of ketamine:xylazine solution in an microcentrifuge tube by mixing 425 µl ketamine and 75 µl xylazine in a 1 ml syringe.\nDilute 0.3 mg/ml buprenorphine in sterile saline (1:20).\n3. Flap Construction (Graft Implantation)\nUsing an insulin syringe, anesthetize the mouse by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine:xylazine (35 µl per 20 g of body weight).\nSubcutaneously inject buprenorphine (final concentration of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg) before the opperation.\nPlace the mouse on a stage heated to 37 °C, to ensure normal body temperature, and then secure the mouse using an adhesive bandage.\nUsing cotton tips, administer lubricating eye ointment to the mouse's eyes (to avoid dehydration).\nUsing cotton tips, clean the incision site with iodine and then with 70% ethanol, to establish an aseptic working field.\nUsing small scissors and forceps, make an incision through the skin, from the level of the knee to the inguinal ligament, parallel to the femoral vessels, until the femoral artery and vein (AV) vessels are exposed.\nHold the skin down using a retractor, to gain better access to the tissue.",
    "Using spring scissors and forceps, carefully isolate the femoral artery and vein vessels from the surrounding tissue. Start from the level of the inguinal ligament to the bifurcation of the superior epigastric vessels. Leave the profunda untouched, in order to preserve blood flow to the leg and prevent subsequent ischemia.\nFold the graft (from Section 1) around the exposed femoral AV, below the profunda and above the bifurcation to the tibial and proneal AV, and join its ends using 8-0 silk sutures.\nTo ensure implant vascularization by the capillaries sprouting from the femoral AV vessels only, wrap a piece of sterilized latex around the graft, and suture with 6-0 sutures.\nClose the overlying skin using 4-0 silk sutures.\nMonitor the mouse closely until recovery from the anesthesia and every day thereafter, until the graft is transferred as a flap. Subcutaneously inject buprenorphine (final concentration of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg) twice a day for 2-3 days.\n\tNOTE: Use saline in any stage, to avoid dehydration of the exposed tissue.\n4. Flap Transfer\nAt one or two weeks postimplantation, anesthetize the mouse by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine:xylazine (35 µl/20 g), using an insulin syringe.\nSubcutaneously inject buprenorphine (final concentration of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg) before the opperation.\nPlace the mouse on a stage heated to 37 °C, to ensure normal body temperature, and then secure the mouse using an adhesive bandage.\nUsing cotton tips, apply lubricating eye ointment to the mouse's eyes (to avoid dehydration).\nUsing cotton tips, clean the incision site (from the knee area to the abdomen) with iodine and then with 70% ethanol, to establish an aseptic working field.\nUsing a scissors and forceps, carefully open the sutures in the skin and, using a scissors, make an incision through the skin parallel to the inguinal ligament, continuing through the ventral skin.",
    "Carefully remove the latex piece with forceps and expose the vascularized flap.\nUsing a scissors and forceps, dissect the tissue flap from the surrounding tissue.\nUsing a forceps and a needle holder, ligate the distal end of the femoral AV with 8-0 silk sutures to prevent bleeding from the AV. Then, cauterize the AV at the level of the knee, distally to the folded implanted tissue and the 8-0 sutures.\nGently transfer the femoral AV enveloped by the graft, towards the ventral abdominal wall, avoiding damage to the artery, to determine at which distance the full thickness defect should be made.\n\tCAUTION: Pulling the artery too far will damage the artery.\nUsing a fine scissors, make an incision in the ventral abdominal wall.\nUsing a spring scissors, make an incision in the rectus abdominus muscle. Remove an approximately 1 cm x 0.8 cm segment of the rectus abdominus muscle with the overlying skin.\nTransfer the femoral AV, enveloped by the vascularized graft, as an axial flap, to the full-thickness defect in the ventral abdominal wall.\nSuture the flap to the surrounding muscle tissue, using 8-0 silk sutures, to prevent hernia.\nTo avoid suturing the internal organs, raise the muscle with a forceps when suturing the flap to the abdominal muscle. Leave the ventral skin exposed to mimic the effect of a full abdominal wall defect.\nCover the wound in the skin with iodinated gauze and a sterile bandage to prevent contamination of the exposed area.\nSuture the skin of the leg using 4-0 silk sutures.\nMonitor the mouse closely until recovery from the anesthesia and every day thereafter, until retrieval of the flap.  Subcutaneously inject buprenorphine (final concentration of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg) twice a day for 2-3 days.\nNOTE: Use saline in any stage to avoid dehydration of the exposed tissue.",
    "5. Ultrasound Determination of Vascular Perfusion of the Graft\nNOTE: Before transfer, vascular perfusion of the graft is measured at one and two weeks after implantation, by ultrasonography.\nAnesthetize the mouse using 2% isoflurane.\nPlace the mouse on a movable stage heated to 38 °C, to ensure normal body temperature, and then secure the mouse using an adhesive bandage.\nFind the femoral artery and vein vessels with non-linear transducer set on the B-mode.\nExamine the patency of the femoral vessels of the graft using the transducer set on the color Doppler mode.\nPrepare non-targeted contrast agent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nConnect a tail vein catheter (12 cm tubing with a 27 G needle) to a 1 ml syringe filled with saline. Secure the syringe next to the mouse on the heating stage (to avoid movement of the syringe).\nConnect the catheter to the mouse tail vein and secure the needle.\nInject some of the saline to both ensure that injections are being made into the vein and to fill the tubing with saline (to avoid air bubbles).\nFill a 1 ml syringe with 70 µl of contrast agent and replace the saline syringe with the contrast agent syringe.\nSet up the ultrasound to image injection of the contrast agent. In properties of the non-linear mode set up the number of frames to 1,500 and the disruption pulse to 30% of the frames.\n\tNOTE: After the disruption pulse, the microbubbles re-fill the vessels at a rate that depends on the flow rate of the microbubbles in the capillaries and is independent of the injection rate of the microbubbles. The number of frames can be changed according to the filling time 19,20.\nSlowly inject the contrast agent into the tail vein.",
    "Capture images in the non-linear contrast mode of the high-resolution ultrasound system.\nAnalyze the results using the software, as previously described 19,20.\n\t\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) on the image obtained immediately after the disruption pulse in the contrast-mode. The ROI should outline the area filled by the contrast agent only.\nCalculate the peak enhancement (PE), which is the ratio of the mean intensity of the non-linear signal after the injection of the microbubbles versus after the disruption pulse, and is a measure of the perfusion volume.\nCalculate the flow rate, which is determined from the time (T) that elapses until the peak signal (P).\n6. Determination of the Extent of Graft Vascularization\nNOTE: The extent of tissue graft vascularization is determined one or two weeks after implantation.\nUsing an insulin syringe, anesthetize the mouse by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine:xylazine (35 µl/20 g).\nUsing 1 ml syringe, intravenously inject 200 µl of 10 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran (FITC-Dextran, MW = 500,000) into the tail vein.\nTen sec after completion of the injection, euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nOpen the leg of the mouse and expose the graft.\nWash the graft area with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and apply 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nImage the graft in the mouse leg, using a confocal microscope.\nQuantify functional vessel density (FVD).\n\t\nIsolate the green channel (excitation = 488 nm) of the confocal microscopic images.\nPass the resulting images through a high-pass filter, in order to accentuate the high-contrast structures.\nUse a despeckling filter to remove noise that might have been amplified by the high-pass filter.\nSet up the value of threshold on the resulting image; the threshold value is adjusted so that the features and structures in the original image are visible in the binary image.",
    "Apply a size-threshold so that only groups of connected pixels larger than the defined size threshold remain in the binary image.\nOutline the skeleton of the vessels in the graft using the Zhang-Suen's algorithm 21.\nCalculate the FVD by summing the lengths of the midline of each vessel and dividing the result by the area of the ROI.\n7. Immunohistological and Histological Staining of the Graft\nImmunohistological Staining\n\t\nAfter confocal imaging, retrieve the graft using a small scissors and forceps.

Slice the whole tissue perpendicularly to the AV vessels.\nDeparaffinize the paraffin-embedded sections by immersion in 100% xylene twice, for 10 min each.\nArrange the slides in a 250 ml plastic Coplin jar.\nRehydrate by serial immersions in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%, 96%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%, 30% and double distilled water (DDW)) for 3 min each.\nPrepare antigen unmasking solution by diluting 2.35 ml of antigen unmasking solution with 250 mL of DDW. Heat the antigen unmasking solution for 2 min in a microwave set to 95 °C.\nInsert the slides into the pre-heated antigen unmasking solution and heat again for 3 min in a microwave set to 95 °C. Cool the slides to 50 °C.\nHeat again for 2 min and then cool to RT.",
    "Incubate the slides in 3.3% H2O2solution in methanol for 10 min, at RT to quench the activity of endogenous peroxidase and then rinse twice in PBS.\nPrepare an incubation chamber: place wet absorbent sheets inside a histology box and dry the slides using delicate task wipers.\nCircle the slice area on the slide using a hydrophobic pen and incubate for 30 min at RT, with approximately 50 µl of goat serum blocking solution (2%, prepared in PBS) per slice.\nDilute the rabbit anti-CD31 antibody 1:50 in blocking solution, apply approximately 50 µl antibody per slice and incubate O/N, at 4 °C.

Gently rinse in water and then cover the sections with mounting medium.\nQuantify CD31-positive staining using a double-blind approach. CD31 staining appears as a brown stain. Choose 4-5 different fields in a 40X magnification viewing field under a binocular microscope. Count the number of CD31-positive lumens.\n\t\t\nCalculate the average number of CD31-positive lumens per scaffold by dividing the total number of counted lumens with the number of fields and the fieldarea (according to the binocular data).",
    "NOTE: The applied reagent volume must be sufficient to cover the entire outlined slice.\nHistological Staining\n\t\nFix grafts in 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nEmbed grafts in paraffin using standard fixation and embedding procedures.\nRemove the paraffin from the paraffin-embedded sections by immersion in 100% xylene twice for 10 min.\nFast wash twice for rehydration in 100% isopropanol.\nFast wash twice 95% Ethanol.\nWash three times in tap water.\nImmerse in Hematoxylin for 10 min.\nWash three times in tap water.\nImmere in Eosin for 2 min.\nFast wash dehydrate in 95% Ethanol twice.\nFast wash 100% isopropanol twice.\nFast wash 100% xylene twice.\nCover with DPX glue with cover glass 1.5 mm thick.\nImage using microscope in 40X magnification.\n8.
