    "Patient-derived GBM cell lines (GS122 and GS304) were provided by Professor David Nathanson (our collaborator), who developed these lines under a protocol approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board (IRB# 10-000655). Cells were provided de-identified so that the cell lines could not be linked back to the individual patients.\n1. Preparation of hydrogel solution\nPrepare HEPES-buffered solution by dissolving HEPES powder at 20 mM in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). Adjust pH to 7 following full solvation.\nIn the HEPES-buffered solution, dissolve thiolated HA (700 kDa nominal molecular weight, see Table of Materials), prepared following the previous report31, so that 6%-8% of carboxylic acid residues on each glucuronic acid are modified with a thiol, at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in buffer solution.\n\tNOTE: An amber vial is recommended to prevent thiol oxidation by ambient light.\n\t\nStir using a magnetic stir plate (<1,000 rpm) at room temperature until fully dissolved, typically around 45 min.\nWhile HA is dissolving, prepare separate solutions of (1) 100 mg/mL of 8-arm-PEG-Norbornene (20 kDa), (2) 100 mg/mL of 4-arm-PEG-Thiol (20 kDa), (3) 4 mM of cysteine or cysteine-containing peptide (e.g., GCGYGRGDSPG), and (4) 4 mg/mL of LAP in microcentrifuge tubes (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nPrepare each of these four solutions in the HEPES-buffered solution prepared in step 1.1. Vortex the solutions to ensure full dissolution of each reagent prior to performing step 4.\n\t\tNOTE: If testing multiple different peptides, each must contain a cysteine or other source of thiol moiety for this conjugation chemistry.\nPrepare solutions (4 mM available thiol) of all peptides to be tethered within a single hydrogel at this point.",
    "NOTE: Peptide sequences and ECM proteins from which they were derived and used in this study are listed in Table 1. N-acetyl cysteine (see Table of Materials), to which cells do not bind, can be substituted for a bioactive, thiol-containing peptide to titrate the concentration of an adhesive peptide or act as a negative control31.\nMix the individual solutions of HA, PEG-Norbornene, PEG-thiol, and cysteine/thiol-containing peptides (see Table of Materials) to achieve the final concentrations for the final hydrogel matrices listed in Table 2. Stir (<1,000 rpm) on a magnetic stir plate for at least 30 min to mix fully.\n\t​NOTE: HA solutions are highly viscous and best handled using a positive displacement pipette (see Table of Materials). If a positive displacement pipette is unavailable, viscous solutions can also be dispensed with a standard micropipette by slowly pipetting using wide-orifice tips.\n2. Illumination and photocrosslinking of hydrogels via an LED array\nCAUTION: Wear UV protective eyewear and cover the illumination field with UV-absorbing material.\nNOTE: The LED array described in this protocol consists of six sets of eight LEDs placed in series, as illustrated by the provided circuit diagram (Figure 1A). Each set of LEDs can be independently powered, which allows for up to six different irradiances per run. Supplementary File 1 contains screenshots corresponding to the following directions for further guidance.\nDownload the Illumination Device.zip file from the Supplementary Coding Files. This directory contains the following files: Arduino.zip (Supplementary Coding File 1), Drivers.zip (Supplementary Coding File 2), GUI.zip (Supplementary Coding File 3), and Holder.zip (Supplementary Coding File 4).\n\tNOTE: 3D Print the top and bottom portions for holding the circuit board in place (see Supplementary Coding Files for details).\nDownload and install the microcontroller software (see Table of Materials).",
    "Download and install the GUI software (see Table of Materials). Refer to Supplementary File 1 for software operating instructions.\nOpen Processing and install the controlIP5 library via clicking on Sketch > Import Library > Add Library. Then, search for controlIP5 in libraries and click on Install. Perform this for the very first time.\nPower the illumination device (see Table of Materials) using the 36 Volt power supply and connect it to a PC using a micro-USB cable.\n\tNOTE: Some devices will not install drivers automatically for various Arduino nano boards. One set of drivers is provided in the device zip file.\nOpen the Arduino.ino file, located in the Adruino.zip folder, using Arduino IDE.\nCompile the Arduino.ino file by clicking on the Checkmark button. Upload the compiled code by clicking on the Arrow button.\nOpen the GUI.pde file, located in the GUI.zip folder, using Processing.\nClick on Run in the processing program to launch the graphical user interface for controlling the illumination device.\nIn the graphical user interface window, click on Intensity for the column containing hydrogel precursor solution to be crosslinked and input the desired intensity. Click on the Time box and input desired time. For the solution provided in Table 2, this will be 15 s.\n\tNOTE: End-users need to calibrate digital intensity values to irradiance using a radiometer. Examples of typical intensities are provided in Figure 2A.\nAlign the samples with the illumination device (Figure 2B) with every other LED in a single column of the silicone molds (see Table of Materials) or 384-well plate. Click on Finish to begin illumination. Repeat this process as necessary for illumination of multiple slides or other wells of a 384-well plate.",
    "NOTE: The holder is designed such that the 384-well plate sits flush with one corner of the inner chamber during illumination.\n\t\nFollowing illumination, when placed in one corner, move the well plate to the next corner and repeat. To illuminate wells on the other half of the plate, lift the plate out of the holder and rotate 180°.\nGenerate hydrogels with varying mechanics for mechanical characterization following the steps below.\n\t\nClean the glass slides and silicone molds using tape to remove debris. Adhere the silicone molds to the glass slide, press down to ensure a good seal, and displace any air bubbles.\nPipette 80 µL of hydrogel precursor solution, as prepared in step 1.4, into each silicone mold on the glass slide.\nPlace the glass slide onto the illumination device aligned with every other LED in a single column. Expose the hydrogel precursors to UV light for 15 s, as described in step 2, to photocrosslink.\nOnce illumination has stopped, retrieve the slides, and loosen the gels from the molds by tracing the inner circumference of the mold with a fine tip (10 µL pipette tip, 30 G needle, etc.). Remove silicone molds with tweezers/forceps.\nMove crosslinked hydrogels into individual wells of a 12-well plate by wetting a spatula and gently pushing them off the glass slide. Fill each well with 2 mL of DPBS (see Table of Materials) prior to adding the hydrogel. Swell the gels in DPBS solution for at least 12 h (typically overnight) at room temperature (for the next day's mechanical characterization).\n3. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements\nTurn on the atomic force microscope (AFM) according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials). This protocol provides brief instructions for using the instrument and the related software.\nInstall the AFM probe (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: For the present study, a triangular silicon nitride cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 0.01 N/m was modified with a spherical 2.5 µm silicon dioxide particle.\nFollowing installation, align the laser to the apex of the triangular probe, and then adjust mirror and laser deflection to maximize signal sum (typically between 1.5-2.2 Volts).\nImmerse the probe in DPBS and wait for up to 15 min to obtain thermal equilibrium. Click on the Calibration button and select Contact-Dependent calibration. Click on the Collect Thermal Tuning button, and following data collection, select the peak around 3 kHz for calibration.\n\tNOTE: Slight adjustment of the mirror and laser deflectors may be necessary following immersion into a liquid due to refractive index changes.\nApproach the surface of a Petri dish (plastic) by setting the Approach Parameters to Constant Velocity, a target height of 7.5 µm, and an approach speed of 15 µm/s. Enable Baseline Measurement Per Run for Approach so that the approach runs continuously and does not stop early due to drift in the deflector.\nUpon approach, set acquisition parameters for force mapping to 4 nN turnarounds, 2 µm indentation distance, 1 µm/s velocity, and 0 s contact time. Press the Start button to begin collecting a force curve on the plastic surface (e.g., a well plate).\nReturn to the calibration window and select the portion of the force curve corresponding to contact and indentation of the plastic. Accept the calculated sensitivity and stiffness values for the probe to complete calibration.\nFollowing calibration, raise the AFM probe and place the hydrogel sample for interrogation. Approach hydrogel following the settings provided in step 5.",
    "NOTE: During the approach procedure toward the hydrogel surface, the unit may mistakenly trigger the approached state. To verify the actual approach, obtain a force curve as in step 4.6. Repeat the approach procedure if the resulting curve does not show contact and resulting indentation.\nWhen the surface approach is successful, switch to the Force Mapping mode and set acquisition parameters to a map of 8 x 8 size with 40 µm length per axis. Obtain force maps in various regions to assess the uniformity of stiffness measurements.\n\t\nInterpret force curves using the software program JPK SPM Data Processing through a Hertz/Sneddon model fit (Equations 1 and 2, see Table 3 for the definition of all the variables) with the spherical geometry selected32,33,34.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63791/63791eq01.jpg   Equation 132\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63791/63791eq02.jpg   Equation 232\n4. Setting up and drug treatment of 3D, matrix-embedded cultures\nPrepare desired cells as a single cell solution.\n\tNOTE: Different cell types may require different passaging methods. A typical protocol for passaging a suspension culture of GBM spheroids from a T-75 flask is reported in reference31.\nCollect GBM spheroids (roughly 150 µm in diameter) from a T-75 flask suspension culture into a 15 mL conical tube. Rinse the culture flask with 5 mL of DPBS to remove any residual cells and media and add this volume to the conical tube.\nCentrifuge the conical tube containing cells at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Following centrifugation, remove the supernatant with a 5 mL serological pipette, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet, and resuspend in 5 mL of DPBS.",
    "Centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature to wash cells. Aspirate the supernatant with a 5 mL serological pipette, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet, and then resuspend cells in 2 mL of cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate at room temperature for 10-15 min. Add 3 mL of complete medium (see Table of Materials) and gently pipette 3-5 times to break down the spheroids to a single cell suspension31.\nCentrifuge the single-cell suspension at 400 x g (single-cell suspensions may be spun faster for pellet formation) for 5 min to pellet cells at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant with a 5 mL serological pipette, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet. Resuspend cells in 1 mL of complete medium.\n\tNOTE: If the cells remain in clumps, rather than as single cells in suspension, following passaging, cells can be passed through a 40 µm cell strainer to achieve a single cell suspension.\nRemove a portion of the cells for counting using a hemocytometer. Dilute this portion two-fold with trypan blue, which permeates cells with compromised viability. Count only the live, colorless cells. Typically, a T-75 seeded at 800,000 cells per flask yields 2-3 million cells after a week in culture.\nDetermine the number of cells necessary for encapsulation. Transfer a volume of media containing the total number of cells needed into a sterile 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. Spin down at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: For example, a minimum of 2.5 million cells resuspended in 1 mL of gel volume is needed to encapsulate cells at 2.5 million cells/mL. A gel volume of 1 mL allows users to dispense 100 gel drops, where each gel drop is of 10 µL volume. Preparing an extra ~20% volume of cells suspended in hydrogel solution is recommended to account for loss during pipette transfer. Thus, one would prepare 3 million cells and 1.2 mL of hydrogel precursor solution in this example. A minimum density of 500 thousand cells/mL is recommended.\nAspirate the supernatant with a micropipette, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet in the hydrogel precursor solution, as prepared in step 1.4, mixing well by pipetting up and down with a 1,000 µL micropipette 4-5 times.\nLoad the cells into a repeat pipettor (see Table of Materials) set to dispense 10 µL. To avoid bubbles and uneven dispensing, prime the repeat pipettor by dispensing an additional 1-2 times into a waste container.\nIn each well of a 384-well plate, dispense 10 µL of cells suspended in hydrogel solution from the repeat pipettor. Using the LED array, illuminate each well containing cells (step 2) for 15 s with intensities (example results in Figure 2A utilized intensities of 1.14, 1.55, 2.15, 2.74 mW/cm2) to achieve the desired mechanical properties.\n\tNOTE: It is suggested to start with five replicates per experimental condition and scale up or down depending on the desired throughput and variance of the endpoint assay.\nAdd 40 µL of complete media to each well containing the cells. Add 50 µL of DPBS to non-experimental, dry wells surrounding the gels to minimize losses due to evaporation.",
    "For GBM cells, add 40 µL of the media-containing drug (e.g., TMZ, see Table of Materials) to achieve the final desired concentration (10 µM-100 µM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or vehicle (DMSO), accordingly, starting 3 days after encapsulation.\n5. CCK8 proliferation assay\nAdd 10 µL of CCK8 reagent (see Table of Materials) to each well containing the cells.\n\tNOTE: If performing this assay for the first time, include negative control wells such as media only or cell-free hydrogel in media.\nIncubate for 1-4 h according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: This time may vary as a function of cell type and density, and thus incubation times need to be tested for each application so that absorbance values fall within a linear range, a requirement for applying Beer's Law35.\nRead absorbances at 450 nm for all wells following incubation.\nCalculate the average absorbance at 450 nm obtained in step 3 for the vehicle condition for each group. Divide each drug-treated well by the average of the vehicle control per group.\nCalculate confidence intervals by generating bootstrap distributions (N = 10,000) through the percentile method36.\n\tNOTE: Generally, one may utilize 95% confidence intervals and interpret conditions whose confidence intervals do not cross over 1 to be significant and warrant further investigation. Setting confidence intervals to 95% is congruent with setting a significance cutoff of p = 0.05. For the data shown in the results, there is utility in distinguishing conditions that either promote or inhibit matrix-mediated drug resistance, requiring a two-side analysis.\nSubscription Required.
