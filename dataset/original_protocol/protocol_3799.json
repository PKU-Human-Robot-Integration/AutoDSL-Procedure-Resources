    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFly ovary dissection\nTiming: ~1–2 h\nThis major step outlines dissection of Drosophila ovaries, yielding intact ovarioles that are teased apart and ready to be fixed and fluorescently stained.\nPour 2 mL of Grace’s Insect Medium into the center of your Sylgard coated petridish (DOW chemical).\nPour a small 1 mL “trash” pool of 1× PBS off center. Be aware of the location of the trash pool and make sure the two pools don’t combine even if the dish gets bumped.\nAnesthetize the females on the fly pad using CO2.\nCritical: It is critical to finish the dissection within 30 min of anesthetizing the flies to avoid tissue damage. We recommend that beginners build up to dissection of 15–20 female flies within 30 min.\nUsing a pair of forceps, select a female fly (use your dominant hand).\nPlace the fly on the dish, outside of the Grace’s pool. Gently pin the female to the dish with forceps in your non-dominant hand and quickly and carefully detach the head from the thorax to euthanize the fly. (Place forceps in dominant hand at the “neck” and slide away from body.)\nNow move the fly to the Grace’s and submerge. Gently hold the thorax (non-dominant hand) and grasp the posterior abdomen with the forceps of the dominant hand. Pull gently until the ovaries slide or pop out, along with intestines.\nNote: In step 6, sometimes ovaries can be very plump (full of eggs) and easy to identify and dissect. Sometimes, due to genetic manipulations or nutrient restriction, ovaries can be underdeveloped and must be dissected carefully with precision.\nDiscard all parts of the fly that are not ovaries including as many large eggs as possible, in the “trash” pool. See problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].",
    "Using your forceps, remove the sheath (black hair-like fiber bundling the ovary) and gently tease apart the ovaries in a brushing manner with the forceps to release individual ovarioles. To maintain the integrity of the stem cell compartment (germarium, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), run the forceps from posterior (egg side) toward the anterior (germarium side) in between adjacent ovarioles to separate the ovarioles, also see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/719-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Fly Germarium Schematic: FSCs (red) reside in region 2A/2B and produce Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs, pink)\nGermline stem cells (GSCs) (dark blue) reside anterior, adjacent to apical cells (green) and produce 16-cell germline cysts, including the oocyte (yellow). Germ cell-follicle cell units form egg chambers.

A pair of ovaries dissected and captured using the 10× objective of a dissecting stereoscope showing one ovary (right) with intact ovarioles and mature eggs versus the second ovary (left) with ovarioles teased apart from each other\nNote: In step 8, be very gentle with the forceps. Don’t pull out the individual ovarioles. Instead, gently tease the ovaries apart such that they are still bound at the top like a bunch of grapes (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/719-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Immunofluorescence-stained ovary from a fly from the w1118 (wild-type) genotype with Fas III, Draq5 and Lysotracker (LTR)\nRepeat until you have plenty of ovarioles sitting in the Grace’s Insect Medium.",
    "Once finished, cut the end off a 200 μL tip, collect the ovarioles very carefully. To do this, fill up the cut-off tip with ~50 μL Graces before pipetting the ovarioles and pipette a small amount at a time to avoid sticking of sample to the walls of the tube and loss of material to the tip. Collect all the ovarioles in this manner into a labeled Microcentrifuge tube.\nTap the tube gently to nudge the ovarioles to settle down and let the tube rest on a rack for 2–3 min. Once the ovarioles settle to the bottom (hold the tube up to the light to see if there are any still floating in the liquid), remove as much liquid as possible.\nImmunofluorescence of fly ovarioles\nTiming: ~2 days\nThis major step immunostains ovarioles (ex vivo) with Lysotracker and antibodies of interest.\nAdd 200 μL of the Lysotracker working stock (1:100) per tube of ovarioles for 5 min and wrap the tube in foil. Wash with 1× PBS once and proceed to the next step.\nNote: Lysotracker is a cell-permeable dye (Chazotte, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), it must be added to the tissue or cells prior to the fixation step.\nFix the ovarioles by adding 200 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde. Rock for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash thrice in 400 μL of PBS + 0.3% Triton (PBST) to permeabilize the tissue and rock for 10 min in between washes at room temperature. Be sure to let the tissue settle to the bottom of the tube after each wash to give the germaria time to settle to the bottom of the tube.",
    "Make the working stock of your primary antibody of interest in PBST+0.5% BSA. For example: Fas III (at a concentration of 1:100) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Cat.#7G10), is useful for staining the follicular epithelium (Zhang and Kalderon, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20])). Let the ovaries settle, remove all the liquid and add 200–400 μL of primary antibody working stock per tube and rock overnight at 4°C.\nPause Point: Fixed ovaries can be incubated with primary antibody either overnight or up to 2 days protected from light, on the shaker at 4°C.\nNext day, wash thrice with PBST for 10 min each.\nLet the ovaries settle, remove the PBST, then add working stock of secondary antibody (diluted in PBST+0.5% BSA) and rock the samples for 2 h at room temperature. Protect your samples from light from this point onward by covering the tubes with foil.\nIncubate for 10 min in RNAse A to digest the RNA.\nNote: It is not necessary to use RNAse, but this step will greatly enhance nuclear staining by reducing the background from mRNA in the cytoplasm which also binds to Draq5.\nAdd Draq5 or DAPI (1:1000) in PBST 100 μL, incubate and rock for 10 min.\nAdd 400 μL of PBS and incubate 5 min, rock and wash twice with PBS.\nTake your samples off the rocker, let them settle, and carefully remove as much liquid as possible.\nAdd 30 μL Vectashield/sample, pipette up-down once to mix the Vectashield and gently pipette the contents of the tube on a slide and mount with 22 × 22 #1.5 coverslip.\nPlace folded Kimwipe on cover slip and put a weight on the top.",
    "Critical: It is critical in step 23 to avoid bubble formation. A gentle press can be applied to release the bubbles. In our hands, placing a Kimwipe on top of the slide, and then layering an upside-down cover slip box over the slide sets a weight-distributed platform for partially flattening the tissue. Place a half-filled 100 ml glass bottle on top of the coverslip to help spread out the individual ovarioles and improve imaging of the germaria as shown in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], with individual ovarioles stained with Fas III, Draq5 and Lysotracker (LTR). Too much pressure and weight can break the ovarioles.\nSeal the edges of the cover slip with a thin layer of clear nail polish and dry for at least 5 min. Slides can be imaged immediately or at a later time, see pause point below.\nPause Point: Slides can be stored in an airtight slide storage box at 4°C for short term and at −20°C for long term storage.\nConfocal imaging of LysoTracker-stained fly ovarioles\nTiming: ~1–2 days\nThis major step is important for quantifying Lysotracker stained FSCs and obtaining fluorescent images of the Drosophila germarium using a confocal microscope. For additional details also see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], how to setup and use the Confocal Microscope to identify and score FSCs, positively stained for lysotracker.\nSetup and turn on the lasers: for Fas III (stained with FITC secondary antibody) use 488 channel (green), and for Lysotracker dye use the 594 channel (orange).\nUsing the 20× objective and the FITC channel find germaria (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], how to setup and use the Confocal Microscope to identify and score FSCs, positively stained for lysotracker) and focus.\nSwitch to the 40× oil objective, focus and move to one end of the slide and start quantifying.",
    "To count the germaria on the slide, go across the slide before slowly moving down and then going back across. Use a sweeping motion to make sure not to miss any germaria and avoid counting a germarium twice.\nSwitch back and forth between the green channel and red channel, to correctly quantify Lysotracker within the FSCs (Region 2A/2B), Fas III staining will help in identifying this location within each germarium. Also refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] of the fly germarium and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1](how to setup and use the Confocal Microscope to identify and score FSCs, positively stained for lysotracker) which describes in detail the identification and quantification of lysotracker positive FSCs in the region 2A/2B of the germarium.\nFor every germarium counted, quantify Lysotracker staining by designating ‘0’ if no FSCs are stained with Lysotracker (negative) and ‘1’ if at least one FSC is stained with Lysotracker (positive).\nPeriodically take representative images of germaria that have positively or negatively Lysotracker stained FSCs.\nCritical: Turn on the Confocal Microscope and warm up the lasers at least 30 min prior to quantification.\nCritical: Take out your slides from 4°C (short-term storage) or −20°C (long-term storage) before you turn on the confocal microscope and bring them to room temperature.\nCritical: If not sure that a FSC is positively or negatively stained with Lysotracker, use the live camera to take an image and or a z-stack to ensure you are quantifying correctly.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. How to setup and use the Confocal Microscope to identify and score FSCs, positively stained for lysotracker, relevant to steps 25–31\nPrepping whole ovaries for western blotting\nTiming: ~1–2 days",
    "This major step prepares a protein sample from intact ovaries that can be analyzed using the Western blotting technique to observe changes in Ref (2)P associated with active autophagy. Western blotting for Ref (2)P serves as another positive measure of autophagy induction in fly ovaries (Lorincz et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Singh et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nHarvest the ovaries in Grace’s media (as described in steps 1–11). Collect a minimum of 10 fed female flies (20 ovaries) or 20 female flies for nutrient restricted conditions and detach as many mature or large eggs from the ovaries as you possibly can by gently brushing/teasing them out using the 27Gx1/2 needle for each genotype/fly sample. Place the ovaries in a microcentrifuge tube.\nLet the ovaries settle to the bottom for 5 min and remove as much liquid as possible.\nPause Point: At step 33, you can snap freeze the ovaries in liquid nitrogen or by using ethanol and dry ice. In a cryobox with dry ice, pour some ethanol over dry ice to create an ultra-cool liquid pool. Using forceps, place your tubes (with ovaries) through an open rack to ensure the tissue is immersed in the cold ethanol to freeze the ovaries. The liquid pool created by ethanol addition freezes the tubes uniformly and quickly.\nNote: Once frozen, samples can be stored at −80°C for a long term until ready to use for lysis and Western blotting. This temperature will preserve the ovary tissue for subsequent protein analysis.\nAdd 100 μL of 1× RIPA lysis buffer to each ovary sample in microcentrifuge tubes.\nUse a fresh pestle to homogenize ovaries by hand. Grind the ovaries for a minute. Keep on ice. Assemble a 27Gx1/2 needle attached to a 1 mL syringe and suck up lysate to shear the sample at least five times.",
    "Note: Avoid making bubbles and gently release the sheared ovaries into the tube.\nOnce your ovary samples are homogenized in 1× RIPA lysis Buffer, incubate samples on ice for 15 min.\nSpin down the lysate samples at 14,000 RPM (high speed) 4°C for 10 min.\nCollect and transfer the supernatant to a labeled microcentrifuge tube on ice.\nDetermine the protein concentration of your sample using the Bradford Assay (Biorad) and BSA standard curve.\nBased on your protein sample concentration, calculate the volume of protein needed to load 10 ug of protein per sample (50 ug for nutrient restricted flies) on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.\nCalculate and add the volume of 6× sample buffer needed to prep each sample. Mix, vortex and place the samples on a 95°C heat block to denature proteins for 5 min.\nPause Point: You can freeze your protein samples at −20°C for long term storage, or you can immediately load your samples into the SDS-PAGE gel (as described in the steps below).\nSetup the vertical gel caster electrophoresis apparatus and clamp the glass plates and notched alumina plates with spacer in between on the lower buffer chamber. Prepare 10% resolving gel and pour into the two stacked plates, only fill 3/4th of the plate with the resolving gel to leave room for the stacking gel. Once the gel has polymerized (45–60 min) place a comb and prepare your stacking gel.\nPour the stacking gel and let it polymerize (30–45 min).\nDilute 10× Running Buffer to 1× concentration.\nUsing 1× Running Buffer, fill the cavity in the center of the tank (in between gels).",
    "Carefully and smoothly remove the comb and use a 27Gx1/2 needle attached to a 1 mL syringe to wash out each well with the 1× running buffer without putting too much pressure or else the wells created by the comb can break.\nUse a p20 pipet to load 5 μL of the protein ladder (Precision Plus Protein Dual Color Standards) in the first well.\nOnce all the samples are loaded, place the interlocking safety lid with leads on top of the gel caster chamber, black to black and red to red. Hook up electrodes to the electrophoresis power supply unit.\nTurn on and run the gel at 120 Volts (constant milliAmps) for 1.5–2 h (the observed molecular weight of Ref(2)P is 92 kDa). This should be enough time to resolve Ref(2)P protein in your sample.\nWhile the gel is running, dilute the 10× Transfer Buffer to make fresh, 1× Transfer Buffer with Methanol (see recipe under the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nCritical: Don’t forget to add Methanol to your 1× transfer buffer, it significantly increases the absorption of proteins onto the membrane and enhances transfer efficiency.\nCritical: Methanol is a toxic, flammable liquid, wear protective PPE, avoid inhalation and direct contact with skin or eyes. Dispose of any waste methanol and 1× transfer buffer containing methanol safely according to your institution’s policies.\nWhile the gel is running, cut 4 pieces of Whatman chromatography paper and 1 piece of nitrocellulose membrane. Cut these to the gel size without any overhangs. Place your nitrocellulose membrane in a plastic dish containing 1× transfer buffer to pre-activate the membrane and soaked in methanol. Get your semi-dry transfer apparatus, forceps, flat spatula, a razor blade and pour 1× transfer buffer in plastic dishes.",
    "When dye front is about 1 mm from the bottom of the gel, stop the run and turn off the machine. Take the gel out of the caster by using a flat spatula to pry open.\nRemove the perimeter of the gel (not required part) with a razor blade. Place the gel in a plastic dish containing 1× transfer buffer to thoroughly equilibrate the gel. Wet two stacked pieces of Whatman paper in transfer buffer and let excess buffer drip out.\nMake a transfer sandwich between on the base (anode) plate of the two plate electrodes of your semi-dry transfer apparatus. To make the sandwich, sequentially place the stack of two wet (not dripping) Whatman Chromatography papers, followed by wet (pre-activated) nitrocellulose membrane, then place the gel on top followed by two wet Whatman Chromatography papers on the top, gently squeeze out bubbles using a 15 mL conical tube or wooden pencil between each layer.\nPlace and secure the cathode plate of the transfer apparatus on top of the anode plate with the sandwich in between the two plates. Perform electro-transfer using 100 mAmps, constant volts for 1.5 h.\nDuring this time, prepare your blocking buffer (5% Milk in TBST).\nAfter the transfer is finished, gently open the lid (cathode plate). Cut the membrane into two; in between the observed molecular weight of Ref (2)P, which is 92 kDa, and for ß-actin (used as a loading control) at 43 kDa. To denote the orientation of each membrane transferred, make a cut in the upper right corner for each membrane.\nGently transfer each membrane from the transfer apparatus to a tray containing 3 mL of blocking buffer using forceps. Block the membranes for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker.",
    "Note: Make sure the membranes are completely submerged in the blocking solution and are able to freely oscillate back and forth in the plastic box.\nAfter blocking, dilute your antibodies in blocking buffer. We use 1:100 concentration for Ref (2)P and 1:5000 for ß-actin primary antibodies for at least 2 h or overnight on a rocker at 4°C.\nPause Point: In step 59, you can incubate your membranes in primary antibodies overnight on a rocker at 4°C.\nNext day, wash your membranes in 1× TBST thrice for 5 min each.\nIncubate in secondary antibody, anti-Rabbit (1:3000) for Ref (2)P and b-actin for at least 1 h.\nWash your membranes in 1× TBST thrice for 5 min each.\nPrepare and mix chemiluminescence- ECL reagents A and B (1:1).\nPlace a piece of plastic wrap on the bench top and secure it with tape. Remove excess liquid from your membranes by gently dabbing the corners on a Kim wipe and place the membranes on the saran wrap.\nCover the membranes with ECL and incubate for 1 min at room temperature.\nGently dab the excess ECL liquid off your membrane on another Kim wipe and place in the X-ray film cassette.\nExpose your membrane to X-ray film for appropriate length of time starting at 30 min and gradually decrease the exposure time and develop your films."
