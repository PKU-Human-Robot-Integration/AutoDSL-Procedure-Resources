Representative picture of agarose gel electrophoresis of pX330 plasmid digested with BbsI\nThe picture shows undigested pX330 and BbsI-digested pX330 plasmid. Successful digestion yields a 8,462 bp and a 22 bp fragment; the 22 bp fragment is usually not detectable. Digested, linearized plasmid shows a different running pattern compared to undigested, circular plasmid. Ladder: GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder (Thermo ScientificTM).\nNote: Use a 1 kb DNA ladder for size comparison and run undigested pX330 plasmid as a control. You will not be able to detect the 22 bp excised fragment but undigested pX330 will serve as an indicator for linearization of the plasmid.

    "The target selector plasmid generated in this step is named pX330-Cdk4_Ct.\nTransfection of murine melanoma cell lines with CRISPitope plasmids\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThe following steps describe the transfection of the murine melanoma cell line HC.PmelKO with three CRISPitope plasmids (target selector, frame selector and universal donor) using the Promega Fugene® HD transfection reagent. During these steps, four different cell lines will be generated that differ by the integration of different universal donor plasmid DNA into the 3′-end of the coding sequence of the Cdk4 gene. The following universal donor plasmids are used during this step: pCRISPaint-mNeon-PuroR [M1G], pCRISPaint-mNeon-F-hgp100-PuroR [M1G], pCRISPaint-mScarlet-BlastR [M1G], and pCRISPaint-mScarlet-F-hgp100-BlastR [M1G].\nNote: From this point onwards, all steps should be performed in a sterile biosafety cabinet (class II).\nDay 1 in the morning\nFor each transfection, plate 50,000 HC.PmelKO melanoma cells in 100 μL cRPMI, into a flat-bottom 96-well, in the morning. Seed one additional well, which will not be transfected and serve as a negative control for antibiotic selection (see below).\nDilute plasmids as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1288_13.csv\nDay 1 in the afternoon\nSix hours after plating the melanoma cells, prepare the transfection mixture. Firstly, mix Opti-MEMTM I Reduced serum medium with the three CRISPitope plasmids. Vortex the mixture and perform a quick spin. Add the Fugene® HD transfection reagent, gently resuspend, and then perform another quick spin. Incubate the mixture for 15 min at room temperature (18°C–22°C).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1288_14.csv\nNote: Set up an individual transfection mixture for each transfection with a different universal donor plasmid.\nAdd the transfection mixture to the adherent melanoma cells and resuspend the media gently without disturbing the cells.\nIncubate cells for 48 h in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nThe newly generated cell lines are called:\nHC.PmelKO.CDK4mut-mNeon (universal donor: pCRISPaint-mNeon-PuroR [M1G])\nHC.PmelKO.CDK4mut -NFhgp100 (universal donor: pCRISPaint-mNeon-F-hgp100-PuroR [M1G])",
    "HC.PmelKO.CDK4mut -mScarlet (universal donor: pCRISPaint-mScarlet-BlastR [M1G])\nHC.PmelKO.CDK4mut -SFhgp100 (universal donor: pCRISPaint-mScarlet-F-hgp100-BlastR [M1G])\nNote: After 24–48 h you should be able to see mCherry positive cells. The frame selector encodes the mCherry fluorescent protein as an internal transfection control.\nNote: Transfection efficiency varies between cell lines. For HC.PmelKO, we have observed transfection efficiencies between 20 and 50%. In the more widely used B16 mouse melanoma cell line, we have observed transfection efficiencies between 60 and 80% whereas we have only observed a transfection efficiency between 10 and 20% for the murine ovarian cancer cell line ID8.\nNote: This experimental setup can be scaled up to bigger well sizes e.g. using 12-well plates. The surface area of a well of a 12-well plate is approximately ten times the surface as of a well of a 96-well plate. In order to scale up the experiment, plate 500,000 HC.PmelKO melanoma cells in 1 ml of cRPMI instead of 50,000 cells in 100 μL. Mix 70 μL of Opti-MEMTM I reduced serum medium, 10 μL target selector [50 ng/μL], 10 frame selector [50 ng/μL], universal donor [100 ng/μL] and 6 μL Fugene® HD transfection reagent as described above (step 7). Add the transfection mixture to the adherent cells.\nAlternatives: This experiment can be performed with any cell line (including suspension cells) that can be transfected. Examples are the more commonly used B16 murine melanoma cell line, MZ7 human melanoma cell line, ID8 ovarian cancer cell line and MC38 colon carcinoma cell line. Cell size differs significantly between cell lines. Aim for a cell density that represents 60–70% confluency upon transfection as this works best for most cell lines.",
    "Alternatives: Some cell lines require more time to adhere to the tissue culture surface than others. In this case, plate the cells in the afternoon/evening and perform transfection the following morning.\nAntibiotic selection and sorting of CRISPitope-engineered cell lines\nTiming: 2–4 weeks\nThis section outlines steps to enrich CRISPitope-engineered cells by antibiotic selection and fluorescent cell sorting.\n2 Days after transfection\nAntibiotic selection of CRISPitope-engineered cell lines\nStart the antibiotic selection, 48 h after transfection.\nRemove media from the tissue culture plate and replace with cRPMI containing either puromycin (final concentration: 2 μg/mL) or blasticidin (final concentration: 5 μg/mL). Puromycin selection usually takes 3–4 days whilst blasticidin selection typically takes 5–7 days. Replace the medium supplemented with antibiotics every 48 h.\nCritical: Add antibiotic-containing media to control cells that have not been transfected. These cells will serve as control to determine when to stop the selection.\nWhen the control cells are dead, remove the antibiotic-containing media and replace with fresh cRPMI.\nLeave the cells in cRPMI for 1–2 weeks to recover.\nWhen the wells are confluent, expand the cells to a bigger well.\nPerform flow cytometry analysis to determine the frequency of either mNeon or mScarlet positive cells. The data shown in this protocol was acquired using an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysis performed on FlowJo.\nInformation on the fluorescent proteins: mNeon (https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mneongreen/[href=https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mneongreen/]) and mScarlet (https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mscarlet/[href=https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mscarlet/]).\nNote: Efficiency is higher when the protein of interest is expressed at higher levels. If your GPOI is expressed at low levels, you can start your antibiotic selection later that 48 h after transfection.\nNote: If using a different cell line, titrate the antibiotic selection media before you start your experiment. Antibiotic working concentrations can differ significantly between cell lines.\nAfter recovery of the cells from antibiotic selection",
    "Cell sorting of antibiotic-selected CRISPitope-engineered cell lines.\nNote: After antibiotic selection, not all cells will be positive for the CRISPitope modification. Therefore, successfully transfected cells can be enriched by cell sorting for mNeon or mScarlet positive cells.\nCritical: mCherry (fluorescent protein in frame selector) and mScarlet (fluorescent protein in universal donor) have similar emission spectra. The mCherry signal will only be transiently expressed in cells (2–3 weeks) whereas the mScarlet signal will be stably expressed. Consider this before planning a cell sort.\nHarvest cells in cRPMI.\nSort either mNeon or mScarlet positive cells into cRPMI. In this protocol, cells were sorted using the FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences).\nCollect at least 20,000 mNeon or mScarlet positive cells for a polyclonal culture.\nNote: Monoclonal cultures may be obtained by sorting individual cells into each well of a 96-well plate containing 100 μL cRPMI. However, note that not all cell lines grow well as monoclonal cultures.\nWash the cells in fresh cRPMI after sorting.\nPlate the cells in an appropriately sized well.\nExpand the cells after cell sorting and make cryo stocks of your new cell line.\nFor cryo stocks, harvest cells and spin them at 400 g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in cryo media (cRPMI supplemented with 10% DMSO). Transfer cell suspension to a cryo vial and place the cryo vial in a Mr. FrostyTM freezing container or similar. Freeze at −80°C.\nAfter recovery of the cells from cell sorting\nValidation of antibiotic-selected and sorted cells.\nHarvest the antibiotic-selected and sorted cells.\nPerform flow cytometry analysis to validate that all your cells are either mNeon or mScarlet positive.",
    "Note: You can perform other assays in addition/as an alternative to flow cytometry for validation of your newly generated CRISPitope-engineered cell line. Additional assays that can be performed include PCR or Western blotting. PCR followed by Sanger sequencing for the modified 3′ end of your gene of interest can be used to detect successful introduction of the universal donor DNA at the locus of interest. For this you have to design a forward primer that binds at 3′ end of the gene of interest (in the last exon) and a reverse primer that binds in the integrated universal donor (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1288-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "For Western blotting, you will need an antibody for your protein of interest. It is most likely that only one of the alleles will be modified using the CRISPitope approach, whereas the other allele will remain unmodified. If CRISPitope-engineering was successful, you should observe two bands of your protein of interest at different molecular weights. The band with the higher molecular weight (approximately 30 kDa heavier than wildtype protein) represents the modified allele (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Preferably, a Western blot antibody specific for your endogenous GPOI is used as this allows visualization of tagged and untagged GPOIs. In case that no suitable antibody is available you either use antibodies against FLAG-tag or mNeon for the detection of the tagged GPOI. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] depicts the results from PCR and Western blot analysis. However, as these two methods are not the main focus of this STAR protocol, there is no detailed description of these methods. However, we listed the primer sequences and the Western blot antibody clones in the key resource table. Description of the methods can be found in the publication where this protocol is related to Effern et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].",
    "As almost every gene product can be targeted by this approach, there is no single universal assay to validate the functionality of the tagged gene product. In our lab, depending on the study question, we assess the functionality of the tagged gene products using different methods: immunofluorescence microscopy to ensure correct subcellular localization, Western blotting, qRT-PCR and flow cytometry for endogenous expression level and regulation. Depending on the focus of your project, several additional analyses may be needed to confirm full functionality of the tagged GPOI such as incorporation in endogenous protein complexes (e.g., by co-immunoprecipitation or mass spectrometry) or confirmation that the tagged GPOI can compensate for the wildtype GPOI in isolated single cell clones that harbor only homozygously tagged GPOI. Nevertheless, most assays to confirm functionality will largely depend on your GPOI and may differ from our general recommendations.\nT cell activation assay using TCRtg CD8+ T cells and CRISPitope-engineered melanoma cells\nTiming: 1 week\nThis section describes the preparation and plating of CRISPitope-engineered melanoma cell lines and Pmel-1 TCRtg T cells and the subsequent assessment of T cell activation.

Final peptide concentration is 1 μg mL−1.\nIncubate for 45–60 min in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nCo-culture of naïve Pmel-1 TCRtg CD8+ T cells and (IFN-γ stimulated) CRISPitope-engineered HCmel12 melanoma cells.\nAdjust cell concentration to 1.5x105 Pmel-1 TCRtg CD8+ T cells in 200 μL cRPMI supplemented with 30 U mL−1 human recombinant IL-2.\nRemove cRPMI from the melanoma cells.\nWash the melanoma cells gently with DPBS.\nAdd 200 μL Pmel-1 TCRtg CD8+ T cell suspension to the melanoma cells.\nIncubate the co-cultured cells for 16 h in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAssessment of T cell activation by flow cytometry.\nHarvest the Pmel-1 TCRtg CD8+ T cells using a multichannel pipette.\nTransfer the T cells to a round-bottom 96-well plate.\nSpin the plate at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of flow cytometry buffer to the wells that contained melanoma cells and the T cells and wash the wells with flow cytometry buffer by pipetting. This ensures that you collect all the T cells.\nConsolidate the cells from the washing step with the cells that you have already harvested.\nSpin the plate at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nWash the splenocytes with 200 μL flow cytometry buffer.",
    "Block unspecific binding of flow cytometry antibodies with purified CD16/32 antibody (FC block). Add 50 μL of flow cytometry buffer supplemented with 0.25 μg (0.5 μL) purified anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody. Incubate on ice or in the fridge for 10 min.\nStain the cells with the following antibodies in flow cytometry buffer:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1288_17.csv\nNote: You can also use different fluorophores to match the laser and filter setup of your flow cytometer. However, avoid the use of FITC or PE as these fluorophores overlap with mNeon or mScarlet, respectively.\nIncubate in the fridge for 20 min.\nAdd 200 μL flow cytometry buffer.\nSpin the cells at 400 g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL flow cytometry buffer.\nPrepare DAPI working solution. Add 1 μL DAPI stock solution (3 mM) to 500 μL flow cytometry buffer (1:500 dilution). You will need 100 μL of the diluted DAPI solution per flow cytometry sample.\nAdd 10 μL DAPI working solution for dead cell exclusion 5 min before flow cytometry analysis (final concentration of DAPI: 3 μM).\nPerform flow cytometry analysis and assess the frequency of live CD45+ CD8+ CD90.1+ TCR Vβ13+ CD69+ T cells (i.e., activated pmel-1 TCRtg T cells). The data in this protocol was acquired on an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed using FlowJo.\nNote: There are different universal donor plasmids available that encode different model CD8+ T cell epitopes. If you do not have the Pmel-1 TCRtg mouse line available, this protocol is also suitable for the OT-I TCRtg mouse line (https://www.jax.org/strain/003831[href=https://www.jax.org/strain/003831]) or gBT-I TCRtg mouse line (http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3722258[href=http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3722258])."
