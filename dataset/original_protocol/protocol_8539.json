    "NOTE: To limit RNA degradation, prepare solutions using wet-autoclaved distilled water (at 121 °C for 60 min) and also wet-autoclave materials.\n1. Preparation of RNA ISH Antisense and Sense Probes\nTarget gene amplification and purification\nFirst, produce a 387 bp double-stranded fragment of L. migratoria OR1 (LmigOR1, GenBank: JQ766965) from the plasmid containing the full-length cDNA of LmigOR1 with a Taq DNA Polymerase that adds adenines to both ends of the fragments.\n\t\t\nUse a 100 µL final reaction volume, containing 50 µL of 2x reaction mix, 4 µL each of sense and antisense primers (Table 1), 1 µL of plasmid template, and 41 µL of RNase-free H2O. Use the following PCR protocol: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min.\nRepeat these steps to produce the 1,303 bp double-stranded fragment of LmigOR2 (GenBank: JQ766966) and 1,251 bp double-stranded fragment of LmigORco (GenBank: JN989549). The primers used in these experiments are presented in Table 1.\nRun PCR products on 1.2% agarose gels in 1x Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer and visualize using ethidium bromide staining.\nExtract these PCR products using a gel extraction kit.\n\t\t\nFollowing electrophoresis, excise DNA bands from the gel and place the gel slices in a 1.5 mL tube. Then, add 100 µL of binding buffer (Buffer PN) per 0.1 g of gel slice. Vortex and incubate at 50 °C until the gel slice is completely dissolved.\nInsert a CA2 adsorption column into the collection tube and add 500 µL of balance buffer (Buffer BL). This improves the absorption capability and stability of the silica membrane. Centrifuge at 12,400 x g for 1 min.",
    "Transfer the dissolved gel mixture to the adsorption column assembly and incubate at room temperature for 2 min. Then, centrifuge tubes at 12,400 x g for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and reinsert the adsorption column into collection tube.\nAdd 600 µL of wash solution (ethanol added, Buffer PW) twice. Centrifuge at 12,400 x g for 1 min. Discard flow-through and reinsert the adsorption column into collection tube.\nEmpty the collection tube and recentrifuge the column assembly at 12,400 x g for 2 min to allow evaporation of any residual ethanol.\nCarefully transfer adsorption column to a clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Air-dry the pellet for 5-10 min and redissolve the DNA in a suitable volume (e.g., 30 µL) of nuclease-free water.\nIncubate at RT for 2 min. Centrifuge at 12,400 x g for 2 min. Discard adsorption column and store the DNA at 4 °C or -20 °C.\nConstruct the recombinant plasmids\nIndividually ligate the 387 bp fragment of LmigOR1, 1,303 bp fragment of LmigOR2 and 1,251 bp fragment of LmigORco into a T vector that contains promoters for T7 (upstream) and SP6 (downstream) RNA polymerases adjacent to the inserted DNA using T4 DNA ligase. Prepare the following 10 µL reaction: 5 µL of 2x ligation buffer, 1 µL of T vector, 3 µL (∼100 ng) of the inserted gene's DNA and 1 µL of T4 DNA ligase, and incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nAdd 5 µL of each recombinant plasmid containing the 387 bp fragment of LmigOR1, 1,303 bp fragment of LmigOR2 and 1,251 bp fragment of LmigORco separately into 50 µL of competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells in sterile 1.5 mL tubes.",
    "Mix gently and put the tubes into ice for 30 min and then incubate them for 90 s at 42 °C. Transfer them back into ice for 3 min.\nAdd 450 µL of Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid medium without ampicillin to every tube and incubate them in a shaker at 150 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C to restore the E. coli DH5α.\nTake a 100 µL aliquot of each transformant and use them to inoculate LB solid substrate plates containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin, 24 µg/mL isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and 40 µg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal).\nIncubate these plates in a constant incubator at 37 °C for 18 h. Screen the target recombinant plasmids using the blue-white screening method. Sequence the target recombinant plasmids using Sanger sequencing and identify the three OR genes' insert directions.\nSelect restriction endonucleases to linearize recombinant plasmids\nUse restriction endonucleases that not only digest in the multiple cloning site of the vector but also do not cut the insert DNA. In this experiment, all 3 genes are inserted into the T vector in the direction corresponding to that of the vector.\nUse Nco I restriction endonuclease to linearize the recombinant plasmids containing the 387 bp fragment of LmigOR1, 1,303 bp fragment of LmigOR2 and 1,251 bp fragment of LmigORco to produce the antisense probes. Use Spe I restriction endonuclease to produce the sense probes.",
    "NOTE: If the insert direction corresponds to that of the vector, then a unique restriction site from the end of T7 is selected to linearize the recombinant plasmid and SP6 RNA polymerase is used to prepare the antisense probe. A unique restriction site from the end of SP6 is selected to linearize the recombinant plasmid, and the T7 RNA polymerase is used to prepare the sense probe. Otherwise, if the insert direction does not correspond to the vector's direction, then a unique restriction site from the end of SP6 is selected to linearize the recombinant plasmid and T7 RNA polymerase is used to prepare the antisense probe. The unique restriction site from the end of T7 is selected to linearize the recombinant plasmid, and the SP6 RNA polymerase is used to prepare sense probe.\nPurifying the linearized recombinant plasmids\nDigest 20 µg each of the three recombinant plasmids containing the 387 bp fragment of LmigOR1, 1,303 bp fragment of LmigOR2 and 1,251 bp fragment of LmigORco using the Nco I restriction endonuclease in a 100 µL reaction that contains 10 µL of 10x buffer, 40 µL of 0.5 µg/µL plasmid, 3 µL of Nco I and 47 µL of RNase-free H2O, followed by a 3 h incubation at 37 °C.\nSimilarly, digest 20 µg of each of these three recombinant plasmids using the Spe I restriction endonuclease.\nPurify these digested plasmids using a gel extraction kit as described in 1.1.2. Determine the concentrations of these extracted linearized recombinant plasmids by spectrophotometry and adjust to 0.5 µg/µL.\nPrepare antisense and sense probes",
    "Use the T7/SP6 RNA transcription system to generate antisense and sense probes. SP6 RNA polymerase is used to transcribe double-stranded RNA for DIG- and biotin-labeled antisense probes for these three OR genes using linearized recombinant plasmids as templates in vitro. The T7 RNA polymerase is used to produce sense probes. Perform the reaction in a 20 µL final volume, containing 2 µL of 10x NTP mix, 2 µL of 10X transcription buffer, 1 µL of RNase inhibitor, 2 µL of T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase, 4 µL of 0.5 µg/µL linearized plasmid and 9 µL RNase-free H2O, followed by a 3 h incubation at 37 °C.\nIncubate the DIG- and biotin-labeled antisense and sense probes for 30 min with 1 µL DNase at 37 °C. Add 2.5 µL of 5 M LiCl and 75 µL of absolute ethanol, then incubate the reactions for 30 min at -70 °C.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Carefully decant the supernatant. Add 150 µL of 70% ethanol to wash the precipitant. Prepare the 70% ethanol (1 L) by adding 95% ethanol (736.8 mL) to sterile distilled water (263.2 mL).\nCentrifuge at 15,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C again and air-dry the pellet for 5-10 min at RT. Add 25 µL of RNase-free H2O to dissolve the RNA antisense and sense probes.",
    "If the length of the inserted gene is longer than 1 kb, subsequently fragment RNA antisense and sense probes to an average length of ～300 bp by incubation in a bicarbonate-carbonate buffer solutions. Perform the reaction in a 50 µL final volume, containing 25 µL of the RNA probe and 25 µL of the bicarbonate-carbonate buffer solution (80 mM NaHCO3, 120 mM Na2CO3, pH 10.2) at 60 °C. The hydrolysis time required is given by a previously published formula17.\nAdd 5 µL of 10% acetic acid to stop the reaction. In this experiment, fragment the LmigOR2 and LmigORco antisense and sense probes for 24 and 23 min, respectively.\n\t\tt = (Lo-Lf)/kXLoXLf\n\t\tLo= the initial fragment lengths in kb\n\t\tLf=the final fragment lengths in kb\n\t\tk=the rate constant for hydrolysis, approximately 0.11 kb-1min-1\n\t\tt=the hydrolysis time in min\nFinally, add 250 µL of hybridization buffer and store at -80 °C.\n2. Preparation of Cryostat Sections\nPrecool the freezing microtome to -24 °C.\nSelect new molting adult locusts that are active and have intact antennae. Cut the antennae into 2-3 mm pieces using sterile razors.\nPut O.C.T. compound on a freezing microtome holder and put one or two samples on the compound horizontally. Then, transfer the holder into the freezing microtome at -24 °C to equilibrate until the compound freezes. Take out the holder and cover the samples with a little compound. Transfer the holder into the freezing microtome at -24 °C again for at least 10 min (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Avoid getting bubbles in the compound.\nFix the holder with the samples into the freezing microtome, then section the frozen samples into 12 µm-thick slices at -24 °C.\nThaw mount the slices one by one on slides (25  x 75 mm; nuclease-free) and air dry for 10 min.\n3. Fixing Sections",
    "After preparing cryostat sections, put the slides in a plastic container (～100  x 40  x 80 mm), and fix the tissues by incubating the slides in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (PFA) for 30 min at 4 °C.\nWash the slides in 1X Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) for 1 min.\nTo eliminate the alkaline proteins, transfer the slides to 0.2 M HCl for 10 min.\nTo eliminate the surface protein of nucleic acid, transfer the slides to 1XPBS with 1% Triton X-100 for 2 min.\nWash the slides twice for 30 s in 1x PBS.\nFinally, rinse the slides in formamide solution for 10 min at 4 °C.\n4. Hybridization\nPrepare the antisense and sense probes\nUse hybridization buffer to dilute RNA antisense or sense probes in the 1.5 mL nuclease-free tubes. In this experiment, for all of the antisense and sense probes (LmigOR1, LmigOR2, and LmigOrco), add 1 µL of probe to 99 µL hybridization buffer per slide. Generally, the use of 1:100 dilutions of antisense probes produces significant positive signals and low backgrounds using this protocol.\nFor chromogenic detection, dilute DIG-labeled probes individually.\nFor TSA detection, dilute DIG-labeled LmigOR1 with biotin-labeled LmigOrco probes or DIG-labeled LmigOR2 with biotin-labeled LmigOR1 probes together in the hybridization buffer.\nHeat the dilutions for 10 min at 65 °C and put them on ice for at least 5 min.\nHybridization\nDrain the slides and add 100 µL of diluted antisense and sense probes (Step 4.1) to the tissue sections. Then, place coverslips (24 mm x 50 mm; nuclease-free) on the tissue sections.",
    "Place the covered slides horizontally into a humid box (∼300  x 180  x 50 mm3; Figure 2) and incubate at 55 °C for 22 h. Add formamide solution or 1X PBS to the bottom of the box to keep the environment moist, but do not submerge the slides in the liquid.\nWashing and blocking.\nAfter hybridization, remove the coverslips carefully. Wash the slides twice for 30 min in 0.1x Saline Sodium Citrate (SSC) at 60 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Washing means putting the slides in a slide holder that is then placed into a plastic container and gently agitated on a rocker (～50 rpm; Figure 2).\nRinse the slides in 1x Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) for 30 s.\nAdd 1 mL of 1% blocking reagent in TBS supplemented with 0.03% Triton X-100 on each slide, and incubate for 30 min. Then, discard the blocking solution.\nImmunohistochemistry.\nFor chromogenic detection, use blocking reagent in TBS to dilute 750 units (U)/mL anti-digoxigenin AP-conjugated antibody to 1.5 U/mL AP solution. Add 100 µL of AP solution per covered (24 mm x 50 mm) slide.\nFor TSA detection, use blocking reagent in TBS to dilute 750 U/mL of anti-digoxigenin AP- conjugated antibody and anti-biotin streptavidin HRP- conjugated antibody to the AP/HRP solution. Add 100 µL of AP/HRP solution per covered (24 mm x 50 mm) slide.\nIncubate the slides in a humid box (Figure 2) for 60 min at 37 °C. Use the formamide solution or 1X PBS to keep box moist but not soggy.\n5. Staining\nRemove the coverslips carefully. Wash the slides three times for 5 min in 1x TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20. Rinse the slides in DAP-buffer (chromogenic detection: pH 9.5; TSA detection: pH 8.0) for 5 min.\nStaining (chromogenic detection)",
    "Add 100 µL of NBT (375 µg/mL)/BCIP (188 µg/mL) substrate solution (diluted in DAP; pH 9.5) to every slide. Carefully place coverslips (24 x 50 mm) onto the slides.\nIncubate the slides in a humid box with substrate solution for 10 min - O/N at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Check the development by looking at the slides from time to time under the microscope.\nWhen the development is ready, stop the reaction by transferring the slides into water.\nStaining (TSA detection)\nUse a syringe to move the HNPP (100 µg/mL)/Fast Red (250 µg/mL) substrate from the syringe filter (0.22 µm; Figure 2).\nAdd 100 µL of HNPP/Fast Red substrate per slide covered with a coverslip (24 x 50 mm). Incubate the slides for 30 min with HNPP/Fast Red substrate at RT.\nRemove the coverslips carefully, and wash the slides three times for 5 min in 1X TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20.\nUse 100 µL of TSA substrate/covered (24 x 50 mm2) slide. Incubate the slides with TSA substrate for 10 min at RT.\nRemove the coverslips carefully, and wash the slides three times for 5 min in 1x TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20.\nEmbed the slides in PBS/glycerol (1:3).\n\tNOTE: After finishing these procedures, the slides should be observed as soon as possible because the fluorescent signal will quench quickly.\n6. Observation\nChromogenic detection\nObserve tissue sections using an optical microscope. Choose the 10X, 20X, and 40X objective lenses to observe the results of chromogenic detection.\nUse DP-BSW software to analyze the results and capture the images.\nTSA detection\nObserve tissue sections using a confocal microscope. DIG-labeled genes should be observed under 543 nm light, presenting a red color, and biotin-labeled genes should be observed under 488 nm light, presenting a green color. When they emerge, they present yellow color.",
