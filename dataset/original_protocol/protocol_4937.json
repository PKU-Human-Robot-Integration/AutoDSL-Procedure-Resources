    "Proteolysis of IRF3 in virus-infected cells (Figure 2B)For virus-induced IRF3 cleavage, the HT1080 (expressing endogenous IRF3) or 1080.10 (expressing higher levels of human IRF3) cells are used.Seed 500,000 cells/well (in 6-well plates) in complete DMEM for virus infection ([Sendai virus, multiplicity of infection, moi: 10] or [Adenovirus, moi: 10]) or in antibiotic-free DMEM for poly (I:C) transfection as described below. After 24 h, use these cells for induction of proteolysis of IRF3 by virus infection or poly (I:C) transfection as described below.Induction of IRF3 proteolysisVirus infection: Wash the cells in serum-free DMEM and infect with SeV (moi: 10) in 2% serum containing DMEM for 1 h, with occasional gentle shaking. At the end of infection, wash the cells with PBS and place in 10% serum containing DMEM. For Ad5 infection (moi: 10), use the above infection protocol in serum-free DMEM. Poly (I:C) transfection: Transfect with poly (I:C) (2 µg/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000 (at 1:2 ratio of poly [I:C] and Lipofectamine 2000 in opti-MEM).At the desired time post infection (0-12 h for SeV infection, 0-96 h for Ad5 infection and 8 h for poly (I:C) transfection (Sears et al., 2011), harvest the cells in cold PBS and lyse in 30 µl of lysis buffer by incubating on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min and collect the soluble cell lysates.Measure protein concentrations by adding 1 µl of the cell lysates in 1 ml of pre-diluted (1:5) Bio-Rad protein assay dye and measuring the absorbance at 595 nm after 5 min of incubation at room temperature.Analyze equal amounts (20 µg) of protein from the cell lysates by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with anti-Flag antibody to detect the full length and cleaved forms of IRF3.",
    "Involvement of caspase-8 in proteolysis of IRF3 (Figure 2C)Seed 500,000 P2.1/IRF3 cells in 6-well plate in complete DMEM and for poly (I:C) transfection, seed the cells in antibiotic-free DMEM (in 10% FBS).After 24 h, pre-treat the cells with various inhibitors of caspases (z-VAD: pan caspase inhibitor, z-WEHD: caspase-1 inhibitor and z-IETD: caspase-8 inhibitor) at 10 µM for 1 h.Induce proteolysis of IRF3 by adding poly (I:C) to the culture medium (100 µg/ml, TLR3 activation, T in Figure 2C) or transfection of poly (I:C) using Lipofectamine 2000 (2 µg/ml or poly [I:C], RLR activation, R in Figure 2C).Harvest cells at 8 h post poly (I:C) treatment in cold PBS and lyse in 30 µl of lysis buffer by incubating on ice for 30 min, with occasional vortexing. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min and collect the soluble cell lysates.Measure protein concentrations by adding 1 µl of the cell lysates in 1 ml of pre-diluted (1:5) Bio-Rad protein assay dye and measuring the absorbance at 595 nm after 5 min of incubation at room temperature.Analyze equal amounts (20 µg) of protein from cell lysates by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with anti-Flag antibody (at 1:2,500) to detect the full length and cleaved forms of IRF3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161109/20161109230417_7886.jpgFigure 2.

    "1/IRF3 cells (106 cells/plate) in complete DMEM in twenty-five 10 cm tissue culture plates. When the plates are confluent, harvest the cells in cold PBS, centrifuge at 9,000 x g to collect the cell pellet. Lyse the cells in 2 ml of lysis buffer, incubate on ice for 30 min and centrifuge at 12,000 x g to clear the lysate. Collect the supernatants as cell lysate to purify IRF3. Incubate the cell lysate with anti-Flag-agarose beads (100 µl bead volume) for 16 h at 4 °C by placing on a rotator. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min, discard the supernatant and wash the beads three times with 1 ml of cell lysis buffer.Elute the bound IRF3 from the beads using Flag peptide (at a final concentration of 25 µg/ml) by placing the washed beads in elution buffer (Flag peptide in the cell lysis buffer) on a rotator. Confirm by Western blot that the eluted proteins contain the full-length IRF3 protein by using anti-Flag and anti-IRF3 antibodies. Use the eluted IRF3 as a substrate for in vitro proteolysis.Incubate the purified Flag-IRF3 with various amounts (0.01-1 units) of recombinant active caspase-8 in the cleavage assay buffer at 37 °C for increasing lengths of time (0-3 h) in 50 µl of total reaction volume in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Terminate the reaction by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Analyze equal protein amount from the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using anti-Flag antibody. See Figure 3 for a representative result of in vitro IRF3 cleavage.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161109/20161109230719_1389.jpgFigure 3.

    "SDS-PAGE and Western blotSDS-PAGE and Western blot procedures were followed from the standard protocols described elsewhere (Towbin et al., 1979; Renart et al., 1979). Briefly, follow the steps below:Load equal amounts of protein from the cell lysates or in vitro reactions on 10% SDS gels and electrophorese at 100 V for 2 h to separate the proteins.At the end of the electrophoresis, transfer the separated proteins to the PVDF membranes using a Bio-Rad wet transfer apparatus at 300 mA for 1 h.Block the transferred proteins on the membranes in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker.Incubate the membranes with primary antibodies diluted (as described in the procedures) in the blocking buffer for 16 h at 4 °C on a rocker.Wash the membranes three times with TBS-T and incubate with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, diluted in blocking buffer, for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker.Wash the membranes with TBS-T for three times and incubate in ECL2 reagents and develop on autoradiography films using automated the film processor.Quantification of IRF3 cleavageUse the autoradiograph of the Western blots to analyze IRF3 cleavage by ImageJ computer program. Using ImageJ, measure the band intensities of the full length (higher molecular weight band, ~55 kDa) and the cleaved (lower molecular weight band, ~45 kDa) forms of IRF3. Percentage cleavage of IRF3 is calculated as:                       imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161109/20161109231000_6616.jpgPercent cleavage of IRF3 is presented as a representative of multiple independent experiments. The quantitative estimation of IRF3 cleavage has been reported previously (Sears et al., 2011)."
