  "procedures": [
    "1. Software Installation\nPurchase StreamPix 5 Multi-Camera software with SimulPix module or other imaging software capable of collecting and combining images captured by monochrome CCD cameras.\nMinimum requirements for StreamPix 5 include: A PC equipped with Core 2 Duo with 2.4 GHz or better with 2 GB RAM or higher. A supported IEEE digital or analog camera and compatible frame grabber. Windows XP/7/Vista 32 or 64 bit. A monitor supporting resolution 1,024 x 768 or higher. A graphic adapter with good 2D performance (OCU express 16x or better is recommended) and 7,200 RPM hard disk drive for recording with RAID-O configuration.\n2. Installation of Dual Camera System Capable of Two Color Simultaneous Real-time Imaging\nConnect the DC2 Photometrics emission splitter, or similar dual camera emission splitting device, to the microscope by sliding the DC2 C-mount adapter into the video port of the microscope such that the housing of the dichroic on the device is accessible.\nInsert two monochrome CCD cameras into female C-mount 1 and female C-mount 2. Identical cameras are preferable. Similar cameras may be used, but compatibility is dependent on internal hardware, most importantly the CCD image sensor.\nUse imaging software to display images from both cameras. The following steps (2.3.1 - 2.3.4) apply to StreamPix 5 with SimulPix module and must be adapted for other multi-camera imaging software.\n\t\nOpen StreamPix 5 and select \"workspace\" in the task ribbon.\nOpen \"workspace manager\" located at far right of the screen and select \"new workspace\".\nAfter naming a camera, follow software prompts to select a grabber from a pre-populated list. Select the grabber matching the camera model and repeat for the second camera workspace. For the merged workspace, repeat once more but \"all cameras are in use\" error message will appear. This message is normal.",
    "Once the merged workspace is loaded, assign cameras from workspace 1 and workspace 2 to the merged workspace in the docking panel located on the right-hand side of the viewing screen.\nAlign cameras in the dual camera emission splitting system.\n\t\nAlign cameras in bright field or phase contrast with the calibration grid provided by the manufacturer using a PlanApo 40X objective (or greater).\nSend light to the microscope eyepieces, place the metallic-coated calibration grid that was provided by the manufacturer on the microscope stage, and square the grid on the microscope stage.\nBring the grid into focus.\nDisplace, but do not remove, the dichroic housing to align camera 1 (bypass camera). Display the grid without binning and without autoscaling. Focus the image using the focus adjustment dial on C-mount port 1.\nPush the dichroic housing into the dual channel acquisition device fully, so that the image is split by the dichroic to both cameras.\nLoosen the three 5/64\" set screws and rotate the second camera on the female C-mount 2 until the orientation of the grid is identical in both images. Using the focus adjustment dial on C-mount port 2, bring the image from camera 2 into focus.\nFinalize the alignment using the combined image in the merged workspace of the imaging software. This allows one to see a real-time pseudocolor overlay of the two images of the calibration grid. Adjust the combined image positions using only the R/L knob on the right side of the DC2. Adjust this knob until right/left vertical boundary of the images is precisely aligned.\nUse the U/D knob to adjust the up/down alignment of the second image until the horizontal grid bars are properly aligned.",
    "If during the up/down alignment a slight camera rotation occurs, correct this issue by loosening the three 5/64\" inch screws for camera 2 and rotate until the displayed image is properly aligned.\n3. Preparation of Cancer Cells for Parallel Plate Flow Chamber Adhesion Assay\nCulture BT-20 breast cancer cells in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented to complete medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 as previously described 2.\nHarvest cancer cells with a dilute trypsin treatment and count cells with a hemocytometer.\nWash and suspend cells at 107 cells/ml in 0.1% albumin from bovine serum (BSA) in DPBS with calcium and magnesium (DPBS+).\nDilute primary antibodies, purified mouse anti-human CD24 and purified rat HECA-452 (anti-sialofucosylated antigens), to a predetermined optimal concentration in 0.1% BSA DPBS+. Incubate cells for 30 min 9, 10.\nCentrifuge cells at 1,200 rpm to obtain a cell pellet. Aspirate primary antibody, and wash cells twice with 0.1% BSA DBPS+.\nDilute secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor 568 (emission max, 603 nm), and goat anti-rat IgM AlexaFluor 488 (emission max, 519 nm), to a predetermined optimal concentration in 0.1% BSA DPBS+. Incubate cells for 30 min.\nWash cells twice and suspend in 0.1% BSA DPBS+ at 106 cells/ml in 0.1% BSA DPBS+.\n4. Preparation of Reactive Substrate for Parallel Plate Flow Chamber Adhesion Assay\nConnect two separate lengths of tubing to the inlet and outlet ports of the parallel plate flow chamber that fits inside a 35 mm tissue culture dish. One tube will connect to the reservoir of labeled cells suspended in 0.1% BSA DPBS+ and the other to the syringe pump, which will withdraw fluid at a specified flow rate.\nConnect a vacuum line to the flow chamber 1.",
    "Position the flow chamber over the 35 mm tissue culture dish containing a monolayer of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing E-selectin (CHO-E). CHO-E cells were grown in MEM complete medium at 37 °C and 5.0% CO2 2.\nAdjust the flow chamber and/or flow chamber gasket to ensure an adequate vacuum seal 1.\nWithdraw fluid from reservoir, monitoring the flow chamber assembly for proper seal and no visual evidence of air bubble formation 1.\nPlace flow chamber assembly on microscope (Leica DMI 6000B)1.\n5. Two-color Image Acquisition\nPower a Leica EL-6000 compact light source, or similar device, to generate high intensity light and couple it into a light guide. Use an inverted microscope to pass this light through a combination filter cube, i.e. G/R (green/red) filter cube, to excite fluorophores of a desired color/intensity.\nEnsure dichroic housing is in correct operating position (depressed) and is not in bypass mode.\nOperate microscope in fluorescence mode and select proper fluorescence filter cube (green/red).\nDetermine the exposure time and gain in camera 1 (red; 620±60 nm) and camera 2 (green; 535±40 nm).\n\t\nDepress the dichroic to obtain images in both the red and green emission channels. Use a flow chamber assay with cells labeled with the red fluorophore only, and obtain an image in the red channel by adjusting the exposure time of camera 1 in \"live settings\" of the imaging software.\nMatch the exposure time of camera 2 to the exposure time of camera 1. If an image is observed in the green channel, bleed-through artifacts are present and exposure time in both cameras needs to be reduced.",
    "Keeping the exposure time equivalent in camera 1 and camera 2, reduce the exposure time until the bleed-through artifact is no longer visible in the green channel. Adjust the gain of camera 1 to improve image visibility in the red channel if necessary.\nRepeat steps 5.4.1 - 5.4.3 with cells labeled with the green fluorophore only, but define exposure time with camera 2 to image cells in the green channel without bleed-through artifacts in the red channel collected by camera 1.\nRetitrate antibodies if bleed-through artifacts cannot be eliminated 11, or if exposure times of camera 1 and camera 2 are substantially different such that merged images may be temporally misaligned.\nUse imaging software to view images simultaneously captured from two monochrome CCD cameras in the flow chamber experiment.\nMerge images collected from both cameras using the SimulPix module of Streampix 5 or an alternative software package.\nUse digital correction adjustments in SimulPix or alternative software to spatially align the merged images, if necessary. Images can be corrected with the SimulPix module for horizontal, vertical, and rotational adjustments.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
