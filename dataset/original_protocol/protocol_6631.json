    "Male mice are housed individually in temperature (21 ± 1 °C)-and humidity (55 ± 10%) -controlled laboratory conditions maintained with food and water ad libitum. Mice are tested during the dark phase of a reverse light cycle (lights off at 8.00 a.m and on at 8.00 p.m).Self-administration sessionThe beginning of each self-administration session is signaled by turning on a house light placed on the ceiling of the chamber during the first 3 s. Daily self-administration sessions maintained by chocolate-flavored pellets last 1 h in the long food addiction protocol and 2 h in the short food addiction protocol to increase the exposure of the palatable pellets on each day to ensure the development of the addiction-like phenotype. The self-administration sessions are composed of 2 pellet periods (25 min and 55 min) separated by a pellet-free period (10 min). During the pellet periods, pellets are delivered contingently after an active response paired with a stimulus light (cue light). A time-out period of 10 s is established after each pellet delivery, where the cue light is off, and no reinforcer is provided after responding on the active lever. Responses on the active lever and all the responses performed during the time-out period are recorded. During the pellet-free period, no pellet is delivered, and this period is signaled by the illumination of the entire self-administration chamber. After each session, mice are returned to their home cages.  In the operant conditioning sessions, mice are under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement (1 lever-press results in one pellet delivery) followed by an increased F.R. to 5 (FR5) (5 lever-presses results in 1 pellet delivery) for the rest of the sessions. As previously described (Martín-García et al.",
    ", 2011), the criteria for the achievement of the operant responding are acquired when all of the following conditions are met: (1) mice maintained a stable responding with less than 20% deviation from the mean of the total number of reinforcers earned in 3 consecutive sessions (80% of stability); (2) at least 75% responding on the active lever; and (3) a minimum of 5 reinforcers per session.Measurement of the 3 food addiction-like criteriaThree behavioral tests are used to evaluate the food addiction-like criteria as described (Mancino et al., 2015; Domingo-Rodriguez et al., 2020) and adapted from cocaine addiction-like in rats (Deroche-Gamonet et al., 2004). These 3 criteria summarize the hallmarks of addiction based on DSM-IV (Piazza and Deroche-Gamonet, 2013), specified in DSM-5, and now included in the food addiction diagnosis through the YFAS 2.0 (Gearhardt et al., 2016).Persistence to response (Figure 2A): Non-reinforced active responses during the pellet free period (10 min), when the box is illuminated and signaling the unavailability of pellet delivery, are measured as persistence of food-seeking behavior. On the 3 consecutive days before the progressive ratio, mice are scored.Motivation (Figure 2B): The progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement is used to evaluate the motivation for chocolate-flavored pellets. The response required to earn one single pellet escalates according to the following series: 1, 5, 12, 21, 33, 51, 75, 90, 120, 155, 180, 225, 260, 300, 350, 410, 465, 540, 630, 730, 850, 1,000, 1,200, 1,500, 1,800, 2,100, 2,400, 2,700, 3,000, 3,400, 3,800, 4,200, 4,600, 5,000, and 5,500. The maximal number of responses that the animal performs to obtain one pellet is the last event completed, referred to as the breaking point. The maximum duration of the progressive ratio session is 5 h or until mice do not respond on any lever within 1 h.",
    "Compulsivity (Figure 2C): Total number of shocks in the session of shock test (50 min), when each pellet delivered is associated with punishment, are used to evaluate compulsivity-like behavior, previously described as resistance to punishment (Deroche-Gamonet et al., 2004; Mancino et al., 2015). Mice are placed in a self-administration chamber without the metal sheet with holes and, consequently, with the grid floor exposed (contextual cue). In this shock-session, mice are under an FR5 schedule of reinforcement during 50 min with 2 schedule changes: at the 4th active lever-response mice receive only an electric foot-shock (0.18 mA, 2 s) without pellet delivery, and at the 5th active lever-response, mice receive another electric foot-shock with a chocolate-flavored pellet paired with the cue light. The schedule is reinitiated after 10 s pellet delivery (time-out period) and after the 4th response if mice do not perform the 5th response within 1 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200920/20200920230637_0930.jpegFigure 2. The 3 addiction-like criteria. A. Persistence to response. Non-reinforced active responses during the pellet free period (10 min), when the box is illuminated and signaling the unavailability of pellet delivery, are used to evaluate the persistence of food-seeking. B. Motivation. The progressive ratio test is used to evaluate the motivation for chocolate-flavored pellets. The responses to earn a single pellet increase exponentially. The maximal number of responses that the animal performs to obtain one pellet is the last event completed, referred to as the breaking point. C. Compulsivity. The total number of shocks in the session of shock test, when each pellet delivered is associated with punishment, is used to evaluate compulsivity-like behavior.",
    "Attribution of the 3 addiction-like criteria (Figure 3): After performing the 3 behavioral tests to measure the food addiction-like behavior, mice are categorized in vulnerable or resilient animals at the early period and addicted or non-addicted animals at the late period, depending on the number of positive criteria that they have achieved at the early or late period respectively. An animal is considered positive for an addiction-like criterion when the score of the specific behavioral test is equal or above the 75th percentile of the normal distribution of the chocolate control group. Mice that achieve 2 or 3 addiction-like criteria are considered vulnerable, or addicted animals and mice that achieve 0 or 1 addiction-like criteria are considered resilient or non-addicted animals.Note: The example of graphs presented in this section are the data obtained with CBL57/6N mice. Data derived from Domingo-Rodriguez et al., 2020.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200920/20200920231020_8951.jpgFigure 3. Attribution of the 3 addiction-like criteria Mice perform 3 behavioral tests to measure the food addiction-like behavior and obtain an individual score for each criterion. The percentile 75th of the normal distribution of the chocolate control group in each criterion (dashed horizontal line) is established as a threshold to consider an animal positive for this addiction-like criterion when its individual score is equal or above the 75th percentile. Mice that achieve 2 or 3 addiction-like criteria are considered addicted animals, and mice that achieve 0 or 1 addiction-like criteria are considered non-addicted animals. Four mice (A-D) are indicated in the figure as an example. Mouse A presents the values of each criterion below the threshold achieving 0 criteria and is classified as a non-addicted animal. Mouse B displays a score in persistence to the response above the threshold and below in motivation and compulsivity, achieving 1 criterion and is classified as a non-addicted animal.",
    "Mouse C shows a score in persistence to response and compulsivity above the threshold and below in motivation achieving 2 criteria and is categorized as an addicted animal. Mouse D shows a score of each criterion above the 75th percentile achieving 3 criteria and is classified as an addicted animal. Data are expressed as individual values and median with interquartile range. White circles: mice with 0 criteria. Green circles: mice with 1 criterion. Blue circles: Mice with 2 criteria. Red circles: mice with 3 criteria. Data derived from Domingo-Rodriguez et al., 2020.Measurement of 4 phenotypic traits considered as factors of vulnerability to addiction-like behaviorImpulsivity (Figure 4A): Non-reinforced active responses during the time-out periods (10 s) after each pellet delivery are measured as impulsivity-like behavior indicating the inability to stop a response once it is initiated (Logan et al., 1997; Koob and Volkow, 2010). The 3 consecutive days before the progressive ratio test are considered for this criterion.Cognitive flexibility (Figure 4B): Measured with a reversal test that indicates the ability to change responding to stimuli that have previously predicted the availability of reward (Schoenbaum et al., 2011). The reversal test is a standard training self-administration session, but the active and the inactive levers are reversed.Appetitive associative learning (Figure 4C): Measured with the cue-induced food seeking test. The cue-induced food-seeking test lasts 90 min and is divided into two periods: 60 min + 30 min. In the first 60 min period, all lever-presses are not reinforced (active and inactive lever-presses have no scheduled consequences). In the subsequent 30 min, the white cue light previously associated with pellet delivery during a normal self-administration session is illuminated contingently for 30 min according to an FR5. To signal the change in the schedule, the cue light is presented twice non-contingently and for 4 s.",
    "Aversive associative learning (Figure 4D): Measured with the shock-induced suppression test. In the shock-induced suppression test, mice are placed in the self-administration chamber for 50 min with the same grid floor used during the shock-test. However, during this FR5 self-administration session, pressing the active lever has no consequences, no shock, no chocolate-flavored pellets, and no cue-light. Non-reinforced active responses during this shock-induced suppression test are measured for the aversive associative learning.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200921/20200921012436_6673.jpegFigure 4. The 4 phenotypic traits considered as factors of vulnerability to addiction-like behavior. A. Impulsivity measured by the non-reinforced active responses not paired with a stimulus light during the time-out periods (10 s) after each pellet delivery. B. Cognitive flexibility measured by the reversal test. The reversal test is an FR5 self-administration session, but the active and the inactive levers are reversed compared to the previous self-administration session. C. Appetitive associative learning measured by the cue-induced food-seeking test. The cue-induced food-seeking test is a self-administration session that longs 90 min and is divided into two periods: 60 min + 30 min. In the first 60 min period, all lever-presses are not reinforced (active and inactive lever-presses have no scheduled consequences). In the subsequent 30 min, the white cue light, associated with pellet delivery during a normal self-administration session, is illuminated contingently for 30 min according to an FR5. D. Aversive associative learning measured by the shock-induced suppression test.Experimental designLong protocol for food addiction in mice (Figure 5): In the long food protocol, mice are trained under FR1 schedule of reinforcement during 6 sessions, followed by 112 sessions of FR5 to self-administer chocolate-flavored pellets.",
    "During FR5 sessions, the 3 addiction-like criteria (1) persistence to response (2), motivation (3), and compulsivity and 4 phenotypic traits considered as factors of vulnerability to addiction (1) impulsivity, (2) cognitive flexibility, (3) appetitive associative learning and (4) aversive associative learning, are evaluated at 2 different time points in each mouse. The 1st time point is the early period (sessions 1-18 of FR5), and the 2nd time point is the late period (sessions 95-112 of FR5). Depending on the positive criteria that mice have achieved in the early period, animals are categorized in resilient (0-1 criteria) or vulnerable animals (2-3 criteria), and in the late period, mice are categorized in non-addicted (0-1 criteria) or addicted animals (2-3 criteria).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200921/20200921012727_5856.jpegFigure 5. Timeline of the experimental sequence of the long food addiction mouse model. Mice are trained for chocolate-flavored pellets under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement on 1 h daily sessions for 6 days, followed by 112 days on an FR5. In the FR5, 2-time points are considered, early and late period, to measure the 3 addiction-like criteria (persistence to response, motivation, and compulsivity). Depending on the positive criteria that mice have achieved in the early period, animals are categorized in resilient (0-1 criteria) or vulnerable animals (2-3 criteria), and in the late period, mice are categorized in non-addicted (0-1 criteria) or addicted animals (2-3 criteria). In both early and late periods, 4 phenotypic traits as factors of vulnerability to addiction (impulsivity, cognitive flexibility, appetitive associative learning, and aversive associative learning) are also evaluated.Experimental designShort protocol for food addiction in mice (Figure 6): In the short protocol, mice follow the same behavioral procedure described for the early period in the long food addiction protocol with some variations due to the surgical viral vector injection. The short protocol lasts 9 weeks.",
    "In the 1st week, mice are trained to acquire the operant conditioning maintained by chocolate-flavored pellets under FR1 (2 sessions) and FR5 (2 sessions) schedules of reinforcement. In the 2nd week, the viral vector of interest is injected in mice by stereotaxic surgery.Examples of viral vectors strategies:Chemogenetic approach (DREADD approach): It refers to the injection of Cre-dependent AAV carrying a DREADD in a determined brain region of genetically modified mice expressing the Cre-recombinase in a specific cell-type.Combined chemogenetic and a retrograde AAV approach (retro-DREADD approach): It refers to the combinatorial injection of Cre-dependent AAV carrying a DREADD in a determined brain region and an AAV retrograde expressing the Cre-recombinase in its projecting brain area to target a specific network in wild type mice.After bilateral intracranial injection/s of the viral vector/s, the expression of the viral vector/s is allowed during the period of 4 weeks (2nd, 3rd, 4th, and the 5th week). At the beginning of this period (3rd week), mice are under FR5 (4 sessions) to recover the basal levels of operant responding. At the end of these 4 weeks (5th week), an osmotic minipump filled with CNO or saline is subcutaneously implanted in the back of each mouse. Subsequently, during the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th weeks, when it is a chronically CNO-induced activation of the expressed DREADD receptors, mice are under FR5 scheduled sessions followed by the measurement of the 3 addiction-like criteria. Finally, depending on the positive criteria that mice have achieved, animals are categorized in non-addicted (0-1 criteria) or addicted animals (2-3 criteria).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200921/20200921014104_6765.jpegFigure 6. Timeline of the experimental sequence of the short food addiction mouse model.",
    "In the 1st week, mice are trained to acquire the operant conditioning maintained by chocolate-flavored pellets under FR1 (2 sessions) and FR5 (3 sessions) schedule of reinforcement followed by the surgery for injecting the viral vector of interest (2nd week). After surgery, the expression of the viral vector is allowed for a period of 4 weeks (2nd, 3rd, 4th, and the 5thweek). At the beginning of this period (3rd week), mice are nder FR5 (4 sessions) to recover the basal levels of operant responding, and at the end of this period (5th week), an osmotic minipump filled with CNO is implanted. During the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th weeks, when it is a chronic inhibition of the CNO-induced activation of the expressed DREADD receptors, mice are under FR5 scheduled sessions followed by the measurement of the 3 addiction-like criteria.Step by step protocolLong food addiction mouse protocolSessions 1-6 (FR1): During these sessions, operant conditioning under the FR1 schedule of reinforcement was applied.Sessions 1-112 (FR5): During these sessions, operant conditioning under the FR5 schedule of reinforcement was applied.Sessions 1-18 (FR5): These sessions of FR5 constituted the early period of the long food addiction mouse protocol.Sessions 3-5: FR5 sessions to evaluate the criterion of persistence to response and the phenotypic trait of impulsivity were applied.1)The non-reinforced active responses during the pellet free period (10 min) are used to evaluate the persistence to response criteria.2)The non-reinforced active responses during the time-out periods (10 s) after each pellet delivery are used to evaluate the impulsivity phenotypic trait.Session 6: Progressive ratio test to evaluate the motivation criteria.Session 10: Shock test to evaluate the compulsivity criteria.Session 11: Shock-induced suppression test to evaluate the aversive associative learning phenotypic trait.Session 15: Cue-induced food-seeking test to evaluate appetitive associative learning phenotypic trait.",
    "Session 18: Reversal test to evaluate cognitive flexibility phenotypic trait.Categorize mice in vulnerable and resilient animals depending on the number of positive addiction-like criteria achieved at the early period.Sessions 18-95 (FR5): FR5 sessions.Sessions 95-112 (FR5): Theses sessions constitute the late period.Sessions 97-99: Normal FR5 sessions to evaluate the criterion of persistence to response and the phenotypic trait of impulsivity.1)The non-reinforced active responses during the pellet free period (10 min) are used to evaluate the persistence to response criteria.2)The non-reinforced active responses during the time-out periods (10 s) after each pellet delivery are used to evaluate the impulsivity phenotypic trait.Session 100: Progressive ratio test to evaluate the motivation criteria.Session 104: Shock test to evaluate the compulsivity criteria.Session 105: Shock-induced suppression test to evaluate the aversive associative learning phenotypic trait.Session 109: Cue-induced food-seeking test to evaluate appetitive associative learning phenotypic trait.Session 112: Reversal test to evaluate cognitive flexibility phenotypic trait.Categorize mice in addicted and non-addicted animals depending on the number of positive addiction-like criteria achieved in the late period.

Check that the water comes out through the back of the microsyringe.Insert half of the plunger into the microsyringe.",
    "Connect one of the sides of the bilateral internal cannula (33 gauge) to the tubing. Check that the circuit is well done by pressing the microsyringe plunger and observing how the water flows out of the cannula without leakage.Repeat these steps with a second microsyringe, which must be attached to the other side of the same internal cannula as the first microsyringe.Place the microsyringes in the microinfusion pump.Aspirate 1 µl of air to form a bubble inside the tubing to monitor the microinjections.Aspirate 4 µl of the viral vector (previously defrosted with ice).Stereotaxic apparatus preparation.Place and fix the bilateral guide cannula in the metal grip of the stereotaxic holder.Insert the bilateral internal cannula attached to the tubing into the bilateral guide cannula. The bilateral guide cannula is used to keep the internal cannula straight and well fitted into the holder and to find the Bregma coordinates before the AAV is loaded. Note that only the internal cannula filled with the viral vector is the one that penetrates the brain.Mouse preparation.Anesthetize the mouse with ketamine hydrochloride and medetomidine hydrochloride mixed and dissolved in sterile 0.9% physiological saline. Administer intraperitoneally (75 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg of body weight, respectively).Shave the mouse's head.Place mouse in the stereotaxic apparatus. Check that the head is fixed using the ears bars and the nose clamp.Place a heating pad below the mouse to maintain proper body temperature during the surgery.Stereotaxic surgery.Apply iodine to the shaved head area.Apply xilin night on eyes to avoid keratitis.Note: The following steps must be done using a standing magnifier. Perform a vertical cut in the middle of the head with a scalpel. Scratch the skull carefully to visualize bregma accurately.Place the cannulas above the bregma and annotate bregma coordinates.",
    "Calculate medial-lateral, dorsal-ventral, and anteroposterior coordinates of your target area where the injection has to be performed.Move the cannulas to the specific injection point by adjusting the stereotaxic apparatus using the medial-lateral, dorsal-ventral, and anterior-posterior readings.Mark the injection point on the skull using a pencil.Following the pencil mark, perform the holes into the skull using a manual drill.Clean the injection area with physiological saline.Insert the bilateral cannula into the holes and readjust the dorsal-ventral coordinate.Place precisely the bilateral cannulas following the calculated coordinates. Mark the two sides of the air bubble on the tubing to monitor the injection.Perform the viral vector injection.1)Microinfusion pump parameters (example for prelimbic (P.L.) and nucleus accumbens core (NAc core) areas)• Target volume: PL 0.2 µl; NAc core 0.4 µl•Infusion rate: PL 0.05 µl/min; NAc core 0.1 µl/min•Infusion time: 4 min 2)Leave the cannula in place after infusion for 10 min to prevent reflux.3)Withdrawn the cannula slowly for 10 min.Clean the injection area with physiological saline.Sew the incision with suture thread.Apply blastoestimulina on the sutured incision to promote true healing. Inject subcutaneously atipamezole hydrochloride (2.5 mg/kg of body weight) dissolved in sterile 0.9% physiological saline to reverse the anesthesia.Inject intraperitoneally gentamicin (1 mg/kg of body weight) dissolved in sterile 0.9% physiological saline.Inject meloxicam subcutaneously (2 mg/kg of body weight) dissolved in sterile 0.9% physiological saline.Inject glucose serum (0.8 ml) subcutaneously.Place the animal on a heating pad until the animal is awake.During the following 3 postsurgery days, check the mouse and inject 0.8 ml of glucose serum every day.Cleaning.Clean the tubing and the cannulas with ethanol, followed by distilled water and air.Clean all the surgical material with soap and water.After the bilateral intracranial injection, 4 weeks (weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5 in this protocol) are needed for the proper expression of the viral vector.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200921/20200921183721_9661.jpegFigure 7.",
    "Stereotaxic surgery. Mice are anesthetized and placed into a stereotaxic apparatus for receiving the viral vector intracranial injections. All the injections are made through a bilateral injection cannula connected to a polyethylene. The displacement air bubble inside the length of the polyethylene tubing that connected the syringe to the injection needle is used to monitor the microinjections. The viral vector is injected at a constant rate by using a microinfusion pump. After infusion, the injection cannula is left in place for an additional period of 10 min to allow the fluid to diffuse and to prevent reflux, and then it was slowly withdrawn during 10 additional min.Note: Frequently check the correct displacement of the air bubble inside the polyethylene tube to prevent errors of injection due to obturation of the cannula or fugues in the tube.Week 3: Operant conditioning after surgery to recover the basal levels of responding.Sessions 5-9: Operant conditioning under the FR5 schedule of reinforcement.Week 4: Operant conditioning.Week 5: At the end of the week implant, an osmotic minipump filled with CNO or saline.Osmotic minipump implantation protocol (Figure 8)Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane and fix its front and hind legs with tape.Shave mouse by the lower back.Clean the shaved lower back with ethanol.Make a horizontal cut (1.5 cm), taking as a reference the beginning of the hind legs.Separate the skin from the back muscle introducing blunt-tipped scissors through the cut.Introduce the osmotic minipump (ALZET 2004) previously filled with CNO (diluted in 0.9% sterile saline: 5 mg/ml) or saline subcutaneously in the middle of the back.
