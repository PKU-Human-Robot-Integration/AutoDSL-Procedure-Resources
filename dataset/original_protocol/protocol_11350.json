  "procedures": [
    "All experimental protocols as outlined below follow ethical guidelines and were approved by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy.\nNOTE: The protocol here describes an orthotopic transplantation model of mouse lung adenocarcinoma cells into syngeneic recipients. Cells may be isolated from tumor-bearing lungs of KrasLSL-G12D:p53fl/fl (KP) mice7,18, if available in-house, and transplanted into mice of the same background and sex. If cells were provided from other research groups and the exact background remains unknown, we recommend the use of the F1 generation of a cross between C57BL/6 and 129S mice as transplant recipients to guarantee maximal tolerance.\n1. Cell Preparation\nSeed KP cells 24 h before transplantation at approximately 50% confluency in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), glutamine, and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (hereafter referred to as standard culture medium). Incubate the cell cultures at 37° C, 5% CO2, and around 95% relative humidity.\nOn the next day, harvest cells using 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA (0.05% in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) for 5 min per 10 cm plate and, subsequently, resuspend detached cells with 9 mL of standard culture medium.\nCount the cells in a hemocytometer and transfer the number of cells needed for the experiments in a 50-mL conical centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: We recommend transplanting between 2.5 x 105 and 1 x 106 KP cells per mouse, but this might be adapted based on the researcher's needs.\nSubsequently, centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 x g, aspirate the supernatant, and, using a pipette, resuspend the cells at a density of 2 x 107/mL (for the inhalation of 1 x 106 KP cells per mouse) in serum and antibiotic-free RPMI, supplemented with 0.01 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).\nKeep the cells on ice until transplantation.\n2. Orthotopic Transplantation via Intratracheal Delivery",
    "Sedate a mouse (8 - 12 weeks of age) by a subcutaneous injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight).\nWhile the anesthesia sets in, prepare the catheter for intubation. Therefore, blunt the needle of a catheter by simply cutting the end with scissors. Afterward, push the catheter completely over the end of the needle.\nConfirm the appropriate level of anesthesia by pedal reflex via firm toe pinching and apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nFix the mouse on the intubation platform (Figure 1A) by hooking its upper incisors over a suture and confirm that the chest is vertical underneath the suture.\nPlace a fiber optic cable in between the front legs to illuminate the chest (Figure 1B).\nCarefully open the mouth of the mouse and pull out the tongue using disinfected flat forceps. Look for the emission of white light to locate the larynx and visualize the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages (Figure 1C).\nOnce the opening of the trachea is clearly visible, gently slide the catheter into the trachea (Figure 1D). The length of the catheter to be inserted depends on the age and size of the animal, since it should not go below the bifurcation to guarantee an even distribution of the lung adenocarcinoma cells within the lung. Quickly remove the needle from the catheter.\nThe proper placement of the catheter in the trachea is indicated by the white light shining through the catheter (Figure 1E). In order to confirm the placement of the catheter in the trachea, attach a 1-mL syringe containing water to the catheter. The water in the syringe will rapidly move up and down in accordance with the breathing (Figure 1F).\nNOTE: This step can be omitted by experienced researchers.",
    "Warm up the cell suspension by holding the tube in hand and, subsequently, pipette 50 µL of the suspension containing 1 x 106 cells (the number of cells may be variable) into the center of the catheter hub. The suspension will be aspirated immediately. Subsequently, attach a 1 mL syringe and dispense 300 µL of air to assure a consistent distribution within the lungs.\nGently remove the catheter, remove the mouse from the intubation platform, and put it on a heat pad until it recovers from the anesthesia.\n3. Lung Preparation for Flow Cytometry\nAt the desired experimental endpoint, sedate the mouse by a subcutaneous injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight) and euthanize it by cervical dislocation.\nSoak the carcass in 70% ethanol and secure the mouse on a dissection board using tape.\nMake a ventral midline incision and gently invert the skin to expose the thoracic wall muscles and the abdominal organs. Puncture the diaphragm and cut the ribs with scissors to expose the thoracic cavity.\nPerfuse the lungs 3x with 6 - 8 mL of ice-cold PBS through the right ventricle using a 27 G needle after cutting a small opening in the left ventricle to allow blood to leave. The lungs should be cleared of blood and turn completely white.\nTake out the lungs and mince the lobes into small pieces using scissors. Transfer the lung pieces to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and incubate it in 1.5 mL of lung digestion buffer (RPMI, 5% FCS, 150 U/mL collagenase I, and 50 U/mL DNase I).\nIncubate the lung pieces 30 - 60 min at 37 °C and with constant shaking.",
    "Transfer the lung cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL tube. Clear the strainer with the back of a sterile 10-mL syringe and rinse the strainer with 15 mL of PBS with 2% FCS.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysing buffer and incubate them for 5 min at room temperature for the lysis of residual erythrocytes.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS with 2% FCS and proceed with the desired staining protocol for flow cytometry23.\nNOTE: Alternatively, the cells may be resuspended in RPMI containing 30% FCS and 10% DMSO and frozen using a freezing container for later analysis.\nSubscription Required.
