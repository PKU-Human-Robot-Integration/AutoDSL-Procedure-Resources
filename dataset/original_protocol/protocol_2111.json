The large 3 μm pore size allows extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes (100 nm), to pass through but blocks cell – cell contact that is essential for trogocytosis.\nPre-equilibrating TranswellTM -96 permeable support system.\nFill each of the 96 wells of the U-shaped bottom plate with 200 μL supplemented RPMI-1640 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1699-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Coculture with transwell insert\nHGSC target cells (100,000 cells/well) are seeded into a 96-well U-bottom plate. A transwell membrane insert, pre-equilibrated in NK cell growth media, is placed into the plate. NK effector cells (100,000 cells/well) are seeded into the upper chamber. After coculture, the transwell membrane insert is transferred into an empty 96-well plate. NK cells are released from the membrane, by gently pipetting up and down. Samples are pooled from 10 wells into a FACS tube for further processing.\nImmerse the TranswellTM -96 permeable support (upper plate) into the wells of the bottom plate.\nEquilibrate in a humidified cell culture incubator, 37°C for least 1 h before use.\nCoculturing OVCAR4 and NK-92 cells across a membrane barrier.\nAliquot 125 μL OVCAR4 (1 × 10ˆ5 cells) into wells of a U-shaped bottom plate.\nPlace equilibrated transwell membrane insert (from step 1.c.) into this plate.\nAliquot 125 μL NK-92 (1 × 10ˆ5 cells) into transwells.\nIncubate the dual chamber 96-well plate (OVCAR4, bottom chamber and NK-92 cells, upper chamber) at 37°C for 6 h (see further details below for time course).\nCollecting NK-92 cells cocultured across a membrane barrier.\nLift transwell insert and place in an empty sterile 96-well plate.",
    "Release NK-92 cells from membrane by gently pipetting up and down.\nPool cells from 10 transwells into 5 mL FACS tubes as described above (Section “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”, steps 15.b.–e., Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nSamples can be processed for CyTOF or fluorescence-based flow cytometry (Section “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], “processing samples for CyTOF and fluorescence-based flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.7],” and “titrating antibodies for CyTOF and fluorescence-based flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.8]”, steps 16–27).\nDetermining the kinetics of CD9 uptake by NK-92 cells\nTiming: 3.5–10 h\nTrogocytosis occurs within minutes of cell-cell contact and involves the transfer of plasma membrane fragments from one cell to another (Miyake and Karasuyama, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Reed et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). In a kinetic assay we detected CD9+ NK-92 cells within 15 min of starting the coculture, with a steady increase up to 360 min (Gonzalez et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCoculturing NK-92 cells and OVCAR4 cells over time.\nNK-92 and OVCAR4 cells (1:1 ratio) were cocultured for 15, 30, 60, 120 and 360 min in a humidified cell culture incubator, 37°C.\nTo measure frequencies of CD9+ NK-92 cells after coculture follow the steps described above (“before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”, steps 13 and 14).\nFor CyTOF and fluorescence-based flow cytometry follow Section “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”, “processing samples for CyTOF and fluorescence-based flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.7]”, “titrating antibodies for CyTOF and fluorescence-based flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.8]” and “Determining data quality and gating viable cell population before analysis”, steps 16–29.\nAnalyze FCS files and plot data (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nInhibiting trogocytosis\nTiming: 7–9 h",
    "Further evidence that trogocytosis is the mechanism of protein transfer from one cell to another, requires cocultures to be performed in the presence of cytoskeletal inhibitors (Aucher et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Gary et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Gonzalez et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Reed and Wetzel, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]; Vanherberghen et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]). Available inhibitors include concanamycin A, latrunculin, cytochalasin A, cytochalasin D, EDTA, LY294002 and nocodazole, each capable of altering the cytoskeleton. In our study, of those tested, cytochalasin D was the most inhibitory (range 34%–53%) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nPre-treating NK-92 cells with inhibitors of trogocytosis.\nPre-incubate NK-92 cells (1 × 10ˆ6 cells/mL) with: concanamycin A (100 nM), cytochalasin D (10 μM), EDTA (2 mM), LY294002 (10 μM) or nocodazole (100 nM), with appropriate vehicle controls, 2 h, 37°C (See “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]: Trogocytosis inhibitors”).\nDuring incubation period, prepare 500 μL of 0.5 × 10ˆ6 target cells (HGSC or non-HGSC cell lines) in FACS tubes.\nAdd 500 μL NK-92 cells pre-treated with inhibitor (a) to FACS tubes containing target cells (effector : target ratio of 1 : 1 at 0.5 × 10ˆ6 cells for each line).\nCentrifuge cocultures to maximize cell-cell contact, 200g, 2 min, 20°C–26°C.\nIncubate cocultures, 3 h, 37°C. There are no media changes, and the inhibitor added (step 5.a.) is present for duration of coculture.\nNote: Given that trogocytosis inhibitors block proteins within the cytoskeleton, we adjusted co-culture incubation times to maximize CD9 uptake while minimizing overall cellular toxicity.\nNote: Our and other studies have indicated that the block on trogocytosis may vary from inhibitor to inhibitor. It is therefore advisable to perform pilot experiments to find the most potent inhibitor for the cells being studied.",

    "Permeabilize cells by resuspending in 1 mL 100% ice-cold methanol and incubate on ice, 10 min.\nWash twice with 4 mL CSM, centrifuge 500g, 5 min, 4°C and discard supernatant.\nTo detect intracellular CD9, resuspend cells in 100 μL CSM with 0.5 μL anti-CD9-156Gd antibody and incubate 1 h, 20°C–26°C.\nWash twice with 4 mL CSM, centrifuge 500g, 5 min, 4°C and discard supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL freshly prepared DNA-iridium intercalator solution.\nIncubate for 1 h, 20°C–26°C or up to 48 h, 4°C.\nIntroduce samples into mass cytometer (Section “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”, step 23).\nAnalyze FCS files and plot data (Section “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”, step 28) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nNote: This protocol also applies to staining cells for fluorescence-based flow cytometry.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting of CD9+ and CD9- NK-92 populations after coculture\nTiming: 2 days\nRuling out that a trogocytosed protein is not endogenously produced but that it is being transferred from an interacting cell is an important mechanistic validation (Caumartin et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Gonzalez et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Nakayama et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Hasim et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). To this end we looked for the presence of CD9 transcripts using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We describe the steps for isolating CD9+ and CD9- NK-92 cells from cocultures by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). For these assays the number and ratio of cells in coculture is study dependent. The goal is to optimize the number of cells of interest that can be sorted from the starting coculture population. In our studies with an effector : target ratio 1:1 we harvested 1 × 10ˆ6 NK cells from the coculture supernatant. Of these around 80% were viable cells. For practical reasons the duration of cocultures was 24 h with no adverse effects noted for cell viability.",

In our case, we used them for quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis (next section).\nNote: The gating strategy shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8] should be performed for all experiments when fluorescence-based flow cytometry is the readout. (See also step 7.b.).\nCritical: Include monocultures of both cell lines as controls for FACS sorting: i) OVCAR4 cells and NK- 92 cells each stained with anti-human CD9-PE antibody, (ii) NK-92 cells unstained, iii) NK-92 cells stained with DAPI.\nCritical: All centrifugations must be performed at 4°C to minimize cell death.

This method is designed to address the directionality of trogocytosis with cocultures prepared where either one or both cell lines have been pre-stained with a fluorescent lipophilic membrane dye. Here, as mentioned above, we are focusing on directionality from HGSC to NK cells.
