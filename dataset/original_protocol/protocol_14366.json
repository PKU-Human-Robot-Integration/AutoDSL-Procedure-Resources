    "This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and in accordance with the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. The protocol received a license for animal experimentation complying with Directive 2010/63/EU with the authorization number A13170404 (Anexo 1). All experiments were performed in a European Union-certified laboratory following national guidelines for the ethical care of animals (RD 53/2013, EU Directive 63/2010). The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Murcia.\n1. Animal Preparation\nNote: All experiments were supported by the Animal Experimentation Section of Murcia University and the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Murcia University.\nUse 8 week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (28 female rats) weighing 200-250 g in all experiments.\n\tNote: Here, we also used 5 pregnant rats.\nTo obtain pregnant rats, cage eight-week-old female and fertile male rats and mate from 17:00 -23:00 h. Identification of a vaginal plug on the following morning was interpreted as mating success. Consider day 1 of gestation, the following day after they were mated.\nCarry out the experiments at 9, 15 and 18 days of gestation.\nHouse rats in groups of two with free access to food and water and maintain on regular 12 h light/dark cycles.\nAfter acclimating to the facility conditions for a minimum of two weeks, use daily morning vaginal cytology to assess for estrus frequency and regularity.\n\tNote: Twenty-eight rats with a regular 4 to 5 day estrus phase were selected for inclusion in the study.\n2. Preparation of Rats for Imaging\nNote: Images were obtained using high-resolution transabdominal ultrasonography. Estrous cycle phases were determined by vaginal smear cytology.",
    "Prior to the imaging study, anesthetize the dam in the induction chamber with 2-3% isoflurane gas.\nRemove the animal and immediately place the snout within a nose cone connected to the anesthesia system and maintain the animal on 1.5-2% isoflurane during the ultrasonographic examination.\nRemove the fur from the costal margin to the caudal abdomen with clippers and depilatory cream.\nPlace the anesthetized rat in a supine position on a heated table to secure the rat and ensure optimal comfort and maintenance of physiological parameters for the duration of the imaging session. All physiological parameters should be integrated with the images and data captured in real-time via the ultrasound application.\nGently insert a rectal probe (after lubricating) to monitor body temperature (37.5 °C ± 0.5 °C).\nPlace the transducer (30 Hz) in a stationary holder and move it along the vertical axis and horizontal axis (forward-to-back and side-to-side) using a manually operated joystick or by hand.\nApply petroleum-based ophthalmic balm to the eyes of the rat to avoid drying during the procedure.\n3. Examination Procedure\nNote: Anatomy of rats´ reproductive organs: The vagina lies dorsal to the urinary bladder and divides into two uterine horns that extend toward the kidneys. The ovaries are connected to the uterine horns via the oviducts (Figure 1). The uterus is located in the region posterior to the kidneys.\nIdentification of the Uterus\nBy using the bladder as a landmark to find the cervix, follow the cervix to find the branch of the left and right uterine horns.\nSwitch to two-dimensional viewing/video by selecting \"B-mode\". Measure the antero-posterior diameter of each uterine horn in the mid-isthmic region on a sagittal midline image. Detect measurements using the ultrasonographic system software.",
    "Measure the endometrial thickness from echogenic border to echogenic border across the endometrial cavity on a sagittal midline image in \"B-mode\".\nChange to color Doppler mode by selecting \"Color Doppler\". Use color Doppler to identify the blood supply of the endometrium and measure the blood flow of endometrium. Select the following parameters in color Doppler mode: high-pass filter set at 4 Hz, pulsed repetition frequency set between 4 and 48 kHz, and Pulsed Doppler gate set between 0.2 to 0.5 mm.\nIdentification of Uterine Artery Blood Flow\nObtain Doppler waveforms in the uterine artery near the lateral-inferior margin of the utero-cervical junction close to the iliac artery on each side.\nUse the following parameters in Doppler mode: high-pass filter set at 6 Hz, pulsed repetition frequency set between 4 and 48 kHz, and Pulsed Doppler gate set between 0.2 to 0.5 mm.\nTake care to align blood flow and the Doppler beam to minimize the Doppler angle. Record the angle between the Doppler beam and the vessel. Values taken beyond an angle of 60° are inaccurate and should be avoided6.\nMeasure the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) from three consecutive cycles. Then calculate the systolic to diastolic (S/D) ratio (PSV/EDV) and resistance index (RI) ([PSV-EDV]/PSV) values for each uterine horn.\nMeasure the uterine artery blood flow of 5 pregnant rats during the 9th, 15th, 18th day of gestation.\nIdentification of Ovary and Ovarian Artery Blood Flow\n\tNote: Female rat ovaries are located lateral to the kidneys on both sides of the animal and reside in fat pads found at the end of the uterine horn (Figure 1).",
    "To image the ovary, start with the probe in a transverse plane and place it on the lateral aspect of the animal slightly below the ribs. The kidney and the fat pad have a hyperechoic appearance compared to the ovary.\nMeasure the external boundary of the ovary and follicles. Numbers on the scale to each image are in millimeters, with 0.1 mm increments.\n\t\tNote: Color Doppler Mode and Power Doppler Mode imaging helps with identification of ovarian intensity and directional flow.\n4. Design of the Study\nCheck the estrus cycle by vaginal smear cytology.\nDivide all rats in two groups. For Group 1 or pre-fertile (or periovulatory), include the rats that were in the proestrus and estrus cycle phases. For Group 2 or post-fertile, include the rats that were in early diestrus and late diestrus cycle phases.\nMonitor and compare the antero-posterior diameter of each uterine horn in the mid-isthmic region in Groups 1 and 2.\nMonitor and compare the endometrial thickness and characteristics of the endometrium in Groups 1 and 2.\nMonitor and compare the size (maximum diameters) and characteristics of the ovaries, and localize any periovulatory follicles in both ovaries in Groups 1 and 2.\nMonitor and compare the uterine artery blood flow in Groups 1 and 2.\nMonitor and compare the uterine artery blood flow of pregnant rats in different stages of pregnancy (days 9, 15 and 18 of gestation).\nPerform statistical analyses using SPSS. Present data as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile ranges. Analyze the results using the Student's t-test between the different groups. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
