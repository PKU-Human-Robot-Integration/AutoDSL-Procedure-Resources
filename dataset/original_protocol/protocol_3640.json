In this assay, chemical inhibition of the Wnt pathway will lead to a decrease in GFP fluorescence, signifying a decrease in Wnt pathway signaling.\nDay 1\nPrepare 1xE3 media and tricaine solution according to the materials table.\nSet up an incross of 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP transgenic zebrafish for breeding. To do so, a 3:2 ratio of females to males should be set up in a breeding tank with shallow water.\nNote: A total of 12 embryos are used per drug treatment (1 row of a 96-well plate). For example, with vehicle control, XAV939 and BIO controls, and one drug of interest, a total of 48 GFP embryos will be required. Since not all embryos will be GFP-positive or survive, aim to have >100 embryos to collect by setting up ∼4 mating tanks of zebrafish.\nDay 2\nCollect embryos in a 10 cm2 petri dish with approximately 25 mL of 1xE3 media and place in a 28°C incubator overnight. Keep ∼30 embryos per petri dish.\nDay 3\nAt 24 hpf, screen 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP transgenic zebrafish embryos for GFP fluorescence using a fluorescence-equipped stereo microscope. Remove any embryos that are not fluorescent.\nNote: GFP fluorescence will present in a fan-like shape around the tail and bilateral sections in the head at this timepoint in development (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/565-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP Wnt inhibitor drug screen",
    "(A) 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP zebrafish at 48 hpf; GFP fluorescence is an indicator of Wnt signaling during normal development. There is extensive TCF/LEF-driven GFP expression in the head and tail regions (arrowheads). The yolk is auto-fluorescent (∗). The white box shows the tail area imaged for drug screen in (C-F).\n(B) Screening of 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP zebrafish at 24 hpf. The chorion is circled to make visualization easier. Embryos numbered 1-3 are examples of fish that have similar, bright fluorescence and would be selected for the drug screen. Embryo 4 has no GFP fluorescence, while embryo 5 has very dim fluorescence; both should be excluded from the screen.\n(C) DMSO (vehicle) control fish showing normal pattern of GFP expression in the tail.\n(D) Treatment with the Wnt pathway activator BIO leads to an increase in GFP fluorescence in the tail.\n(E) Treatment with the Wnt inhibitor XAV939 leads to a decrease or complete loss of GFP fluorescence in the tail.\n(F) Treatment with a less potent Wnt pathway inhibitor, CBA-1, leads to a decrease but not complete loss of GFP fluorescence. Images (C-F) were taken at 72 hpf. Scale bar = 500 μm\nCritical: It is important to choose embryos of similar fluorescence intensity and avoid outliers. Select larvae with equal GFP expression to use for the drug screen. Remove any larvae that are not fluorescent or have a different fluorescence intensity than the surrounding larvae (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Approximately 60% of embryos collected will meet screening criteria and can be used for drug screening.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, dechorionated screened larvae using ultra-fine point forceps to gently pull apart the chorion and release the embryos.\nNote: Dechorionation can also be performed using Pronase at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL in 1xE3 media.",
    "In a flat-bottom 96-well plate, add 1 dechorionated fish with 100 μL E3 media to each well.\nReplace 1xE3 media in the plate of embryos with fresh 1xE3 media\nCut the tip off of a 200 μL pipette tip, just large enough for a 2 dpf zebrafish larva to fit through. Using a P200 pipette, aspirate 100μL E3 media with one zebrafish larva from the plate and add to an empty well.\nAdd 100 μL of 2× concentration of the desired drug (see note below) to each well, respectively. Do the same dilution for DMSO/vehicle in E3 media as a control for normalization of fluorescent signal intensity.\nNote: For this protocol, 10 μM of the Wnt pathway inhibitor CBA-1 was used. 1 μM BIO, a GSK3 inhibitor that activates Wnt pathway signaling, was used as a positive control (Sato et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). 1 μM XAV939, a Tankyrase 1 inhibitor that inhibits Wnt pathway signaling, was used as a negative control (Huang et al, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). DMSO was used as a vehicle control at a final concentration of 0.1%.\nNote: This addition of 100 μL of 2× drug + 100 μL E3 media will bring the final drug concentration to 1×. From the 10 mM stock solutions, CBA-1 and DMSO/vehicle control were diluted 1:500 in E3 media for the 2× concentration and BIO and XAV939 were diluted 1:5,000 in E3 media.\nPlace the plate into a 28°C incubator and leave for 48 h of drug treatment.\nNote: If the drug of choice is light-sensitive, incubation can be done in the dark (either in an incubator in a dark room or by covering the plates with aluminum foil).\nDay 4",
    "Examine the larvae daily and remove any larvae that are dead or developmentally abnormal. The drug may be too toxic if there are a large number of dead or deformed larvae. Record the number of dead/deformed larvae for toxicity purposes.\nNote: If 10 μM of the drug of choice is too toxic for zebrafish larvae or no effect is seen at this dose, the maximum tolerated dose for your drug of choice should be determined and used for the drug screen (see Troubleshooting Problem 2 below).\nDay 5\nAfter 2 days of drug treatment, image 72 hpf larvae on the VAST Bioimager at 488 nm excitation/ 509 nm emission to visualize GFP (Union Biometrica; Pardo-Martin et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Chang et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Pulak, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Image only the tails of the 6xTCF/LEF-miniP:dGFP larval fish just above the anal canal and avoid imaging yolk. The autofluorescence of the yolk can interfere with downstream quantification. Using the tail only for GFP-quantification yields the most reproducible results (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C–1F).\nStart with DMSO control fish to set the exposure level before moving on to positive and negative controls and then the drug(s) of choice.\nMaintain constant exposure settings throughout all images.\nNote: The VAST bioimager automatically adds Tricaine-S solution to wells of 96-well plate to anesthetize animals for imaging. If not using VAST bioimager, fish can be anesthetized in a final concentration of 50–100 mg/L of Tricaine-S before imaging.\nPause Point: Once images have been taken, quantification can be done at any point.\nQuantify fluorescence using FIJI Image J software and macro as previously described in Haney et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nMultiply (mean fluorescence intensity) × (area of fluorescence) for each image.\nNormalize values to vehicle control (DMSO in this experiment) by dividing the above number by the average (mean × area) for all DMSO fish.",
    "Caudal fin regeneration assay in wild-type fish\nTiming: 5 days\nNote: Zebrafish caudal fins will regenerate if they are cut immediately rostral to the bifurcation of the caudal fin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). This regeneration is dependent on Wnt pathway signaling (Stoick-Cooper et al, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Chemical inhibition of Wnt signaling will lead to reduced caudal fin regeneration, signifying a decrease in Wnt pathway signaling.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/565-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Caudal fin regeneration assay\n(A) Caudal fins are amputated with a razor blade immediately rostral to the fin bifurcation. Cuts made too close to the tail musculature (arrowhead) will likely result in zebrafish mortality.\n(B) DMSO control treated zebrafish show regeneration of the caudal fin 4 days post-amputation, with the amount of growth measured (red line).\n(C) Wnt inhibitor (XAV939) treated caudal fins fail to regenerate. Scale bar = 2 mm.\nNote: For this assay you will need 6 adult wild-type zebrafish (of any sex) per drug treatment. For example, if using DMSO/vehicle control, XAV939 control, and a potential Wnt inhibitor compound, a total of 18 adult zebrafish would be required for this experiment. This number was chosen as a pilot study to not overcrowd tanks and not require too much drug. Power analysis can be done based of this study to decide how many fish are required for further studies.\nDay 1\nAnesthetize adult (3–12 months of age) wild-type fish by placing the fish in a 10 cm2 petri dish containing 25 mL of fish system water with 100 μL of 4mg/mL Tricaine-S solution for approximately 1–2 min.\nRemove the fish from the Tricaine-water and place on a clean 10 cm2 petri dish. Using a razor blade, cut off the end of the fish’s tail just rostral to the bifurcation of the caudal fin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "Critical: Do not cut the tail fin too close to the musculature in the tail (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Larger wounds have more blood loss and risk of infection, increasing the likelihood of mortality.\nImmediately place fish into a large (∼4L) tank with fish system water to recover for 20 min.\nRepeat steps 8 and 9 for enough fish for n=6/drug treatment group.\nAfter the recovery period, place amputated fish (n=6/group) in a small tank, such as a small breeding tank (18 cm × 8 cm × 7 cm), with 250 mL of fish system water (approximately 2.5 cm depth) containing 5 μM of Wnt inhibitor compound to be tested, DMSO (or the correspondent vehicle) as a negative control, or 1 μM of XAV939 as a positive control.\nNote: 5 μM drug concentration was chosen for this assay due to the larger amount of drug stock required to perform this assay on adult zebrafish.\nLeave the tank of drug-treated, amputated fish at ambient temperature (approximately 28°C). Do not feed the fish until immediately prior to water changes to keep the tank clean.\nDay 2 (1 day post-amputation)\nMove fish to a new tank with 250 mL of fresh fish system water containing the fresh drug.\nDay 3 (2 days post-amputation)\nFeed fish with dry food, wait 15 min for the fish to eat, and then move fish to a new tank with 250 mL of fresh fish system water containing the fresh drug.\nDay 4 (3 days post-amputation)\nMove fish to a new tank with 250 mL of fresh fish system water containing the fresh drug.\nDay 5 (4 days post-amputation)",
    "Image fish at 4 days post-amputation using any stereo microscope. Take images of the tail regeneration front (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and C). Fish can be anesthetized with a final concentration of 50–100 mg/L or euthanized with >400 mg/L Tricaine-S for ease of imaging.\nUsing the measurement feature in FIJI Image J software, measure the length of growth of each tail from the cut point to the farthest point of growth (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nNote: Fish may be fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C then moved to PBS and held in a 4°C refrigerator for imaging within one week.\nEye rescue in wild-type fish\nTiming: 4 days\nNote: Zebrafish eye development is dependent on a proper balance of Wnt pathway signaling. When the balance of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling is altered towards increased Wnt signaling during early development, zebrafish will develop an eyeless phenotype (van de Water et al, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). In this assay, over-stimulation of Wnt pathway signaling is achieved by treating zebrafish embryos during the first 6 h of development with the compound BIO. The resulting eyeless phenotype can then be rescued by reducing Wnt pathway signaling via treatment with a Wnt pathway inhibitor compound.\nNote: This experiment requires 30 embryos per drug treatment for a pilot study. For this experiment, with BIO and DMSO/vehicle control, XAV939 and a Wnt inhibitor, a total of 120 embryos are required. This pilot experiment can then be repeated with 3 independent replicates and the results between trials averaged to increase statistical power.\nDay 1\nSet up an incross of any pigmented wild-type zebrafish line for breeding. To do so, place a divider in a breeding tank with shallow water. A 3:2 ratio of females to males should be set up, using the divider to separate males and females.\nDay 2",
    "In the early morning, remove the divider from the breeding tank(s) to allow the zebrafish to begin breeding. Check for embryos every 15 min after removing the divider and collect any embryos that have been laid, recording the time of collection as time gates were pulled. This can be repeated, checking for new eggs laid and collecting them every 15 min until enough eggs are collected to perform the experiment.\nCollect embryos in a 10 cm2 petri dish in 1xE3 media and place in a 28°C incubator until ready to use. Embryos will be used for drug-treatment at 6 hpf.\nIn a 6-well plate, add 1 μM BIO + 10 μM CBA-1, or experimental drug of interest, in 9 mL E3 media per well.\nUse vehicle/DMSO, BIO treatment alone, and BIO plus 10 μM XAV as controls.\nAdd 6 hpf embryos into the plate with 20 fish/well using a transfer pipette with as little volume of liquid as possible.\nNote: When transferring embryos to the drug-treatment wells from the 10 cm2 petri dish they were collected into, make sure to add as little E3 media with the embryos as possible. This ensures the drug concentration remains at the desired concentration. Hold the transfer pipette vertically and allow embryos to settle to the bottom of the transfer pipette before expelling fish to avoid transferring large volumes of liquid.\nCritical: Make sure fish are set up to breed with gates in place and keep track of the time the fish lay embryos. The addition of drug at the shield stage of development (at 6 hpf) is critical for viable embryo development and the eyeless phenotype.\nPlace embryos in drug treatment in a 28°C incubator.\nDay 4",
    "Using a stereo microscope, count the number of eyes present in fish at 48 hpf (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D). Record the number of fish with no eyes, one eye, or two eyes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/565-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Eye rescue assay\n(A) Treatment with BIO leads to overactivation of Wnt signaling and a loss of eye development, as well as other developmental abnormalities.\n(B) Simultaneous addition of a Wnt inhibitor (XAV939) along with BIO treatment rescues the eyeless phenotype.\n(C and D) show the boxed head regions from A and B, respectively. Scale bar in A and B = 500 μm. Scale bar in C and D = 250 μm.\nNote: Eye development can be assessed at 24 or 48 hpf depending on toxicity of the drugs being used. The phenotype will not change after 24 hpf, however the eyes will be larger and more pigmented at 48 hpf and are easier for counting and imaging.\nNote: Treatment with BIO is toxic to zebrafish embryos during development as it interferes with normal early development pathway signaling. Phenotypes such as pericardial enlargement, pink coloration in the yolk, and tail atrophy or curvature may be seen. These phenotypes will not affect the eye rescue phenotype outcomes.\nNote: A dose response curve can be done to determine strength of Wnt pathway inhibition. This is done by treating groups of embryos with 1, 2, 5, and 10 μM of the drug of interest plus 1 μM BIO in the same manner as described above. Results should indicate an increase in the number of two-eyed embryos, a decrease to almost no one-eyed embryos, and a lack of no eyed embryos as the dose increases."
