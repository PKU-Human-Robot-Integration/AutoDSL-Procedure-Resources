    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCalibrating the Oxygen Electrodes\nTiming: 10 min\nTurn on the Mitocell respirometry system (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/117-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The Mitocell Respirometry System\nThe system comprising a 782 oxygen meter and a MT200 respirometer with a 1302 electrode.\nNote: The MT200 mitocell respirometer only needs 100 μL of sample each time, which is far less than the traditional Clark oxygen electrode meter.\nTurn on the 782 Oxygen system software and check the connection of oxygen meter.\nNote: The software cannot connect to the oxygen meter if you turn on the software before step 1.\nFill the chamber with MilliQ water using a rinse bottle, and discard the water with a vacuum pump, rinse 3 times (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/117-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The Process of Calibration\n(A) Rinse the oxygen electrode chamber.\n(B) The tip site for sucking out the solution in the oxygen electrode chamber.\n(C) Put the magnetic stirrer into the oxygen electrode chamber.\n(D) Add 3–5 mg sodium sulfite to calibrate the zero of the electrode.\nNote: The tip must be inserted against the wall of the oxygen electrode chamber, otherwise it can easily damage the membrane of the electrode.\nFill air-saturated water (MilliQ water in contact with air) into the oxygen electrode chamber.\nPut a micro-magnetic stirrer into the oxygen electrode chamber of MT200 respirometer with a plastic forceps, and start stirring (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Keep eyes on the tiny magnetic stirrer because it is easily aspirated on the tip. Prepare a big magnetic to find the lost magnetic stirrer.\nClick on “Calibration high” of calibration panel to start calibrating the high value of the electrode. Please wait until the process is completed.",
    "Add a small amount (3–5 mg) of sodium sulfite into the air-saturated water in the oxygen electrode chamber and click on “Calibration zero” to calibrate the zero value of the electrode (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nRinse the chamber 6–10 times to wash out the sodium sulfite. Now, the oxygen meter is ready for use.\nNote: Please rinse more times if the sloped basal line occurred.\nPause Point: The calibrated oxygen meter could wait for a break of 2–3 h.\nCounting Cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 10 min\nWash cardiomyocytes twice with 5 mL PBS, detach cells using 1 mL 0.05% trypsin digesting 2–3 min and pipette 5–8 times, and collected cardiomyocytes through 80 g, 2 min centrifugation, and discard the supernatant.\nNote: The ability of attachment of adult cardiomyocytes is weaker than the cell lines.\nResuspend cells in 1–2 mL mitochondrial respiration medium B (MRB).\nPipette the cells well and use one drop to count the number of cells with an automatic cell counter.\nDilute the cells to 5 × 105 cells per mL with MRB and keep on ice.\nCritical: Appropriate cell number is very important for measurement. Too many cells will cause the quick decline of the basal line without enough time to treat the cells with substrates and inhibitors. Also, few cells will lead to a weak response.\nMeasuring Mitochondrial Respiration\nTiming: 15–20 min\nAdd 100 μL cell suspension (5 × 104 cells) using a pipette to oxygen electrode chambers. Close the oxygen electrode chamber with the Transparent polycarbonate plunger, equilibrate again for 3–5 min.\nNote: keep the cardiomyocytes, mitochondrial electron transport chain substrates and inhibitors on the ice during measurement.",
    "Start recording oxygen consumption. After 2–3 min of basal line recording, add 5 μL saponin (final concentration is ∼50 μg/mL) using a 25 μL microsyringe for cell membrane permeabilization, and continue recording (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/117-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Add Saponin, Substrates or Inhibitors with a Microsyringe\nNote: Add the solution of saponin, substrates, or inhibitors slowly; otherwise, it will cause bubbles to disrupt the trace.\nCritical: 1–2 min is enough for complete cell membrane permeabilization. Excess of saponin (more than 100 μg/mL) can damage the mitochondrial membrane (Kuznetsov et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The permeabilization conditions should be strictly optimized for different cell types to preserve mitochondrial intactness. To check whether the mitochondrial outer membrane is damaged, we can assess the oxygen consumption of TMPD/Ascorbate/ADP and cytochrome c (Please refer to the section of Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\n1–2 min later, add 5 μL Glutamate/Malate solution (final concentration is ∼10 mM glutamate, ∼5 mM malate) to the chamber and record 2 min of resting complex I-supported respiration.\nNote: Make a mixed Glutamate/Malate substrate solution by mixing 400 mM Glutamate and 200 mM malate in a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, you can use 10 mM Pyruvate instead of Glutamate.\nAdd 5 μL 20 mM ADP (final concentration is ∼1 mM) to the chamber, incubate for 3–5 min and record the respiration.\nNote: If the slope of trace (state 3) only slightly increases (the ratio of respiration rate of control cells before and after the addition of ADP is less than 2), it indicates that the mitochondria may be damaged by permeabilization. Please perform the oxygen consumption of TMPD/Ascorbate/ADP and cytochrome c (Please refer to the section of Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])",
    "Add 5 μL 100 μM Oligmycin A (final concentration is ∼ 5 μM ) to the chamber, to inhibit ATP synthase and reduce oxygen consumption rate. Incubate for 2–3 min, and record the respiration.\nAdd 5 μL 20 μM FCCP (final concentration is ∼ 1 μM) to the chamber to uncouple oxygen consumption from ATP production, and trigger the maximal oxygen consumption, record the respiration until it reaches zero.\nCleaning the Oxygen Electrode Chambers\nTiming: 35 min\nRinse the chamber with MilliQ H2O for several times. Then sterilize with 70% ethanol for 30 min after each experiment."
