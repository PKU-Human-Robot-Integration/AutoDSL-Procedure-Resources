    "Spleen extractionLatex examination gloves should be used throughout the entire procedure. Mice (Note 1) are infected by the corresponding via (e.g. intraperitoneally, intravenously, subcutaneously) using the recommended bacterial dose (e.g. 102, 103, 104) depending on the assay and virulence of the bacteria employed. Intraperitoneal infection is carried out with tuberculin 1 cc syringe, 25-27 g needle and maximum volume of 20 ml/kg. http://www.procedureswithcare.org.uk/intraperitoneal-injection-in-the-mouse [href=http://www.procedureswithcare.org.uk/intraperitoneal-injection-in-the-mouse]Weight sterile plastic Whirl-Pak Bags (one per each mouse spleen) to the mg level. Spleen must be obtained immediately after sacrifice (Note 2). Following the corresponding infection period (e.g. 3-15 days), mice are killed by cervical elongation keeping the appropriate ethical protocols and regulations (e.g. cervical dislocation, CO2) (Nagy et al., 2006) (Note 3).After killing, spray the mouse exhaustively with 70% alcohol, and locate on a clean or sterile surface, within a safety vertical laminar flow hood. With small sharp scissors make a small cut into the skin below the belly bottom. Then open the entire abdominal cavity and cut the peritoneum and expose the spleen (situated in the left superior abdominal quadrant of the mouse) or the required organ, following recommended necropsy protocols (Covelli, 2013 http://eulep.pdn.cam.ac.uk/Necropsy_of_the_Mouse/printable.php[href=http://eulep.pdn.cam.ac.uk/Necropsy_of_the_Mouse/printable.php]) (Note 4) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131029/20131029084317_9808.jpgFigure 1. Spleen extraction indicating: A. position of the mouse for necropsy, B. opening of the mouse skin, C. opening of the abdominal wall and D. spleen extraction (pointed with white arrow). Photographs taken from Covelli, 2013. For details, this work may be consulted at: http://eulep.pdn.cam.ac.uk/Necropsy_of_the_Mouse/printable.php[href=http://eulep.pdn.cam.ac.uk/Necropsy_of_the_Mouse/printable.php] (date consulted: 09/30/2013).Use small forceps to hold the spleen and then cut the hilum together with the gastrosplenic ligament to remove the spleen and locate inside a pre-weighted sterile plastic Whirl-Pak Bag (Note 5) (Figure 1). Weight the spleens inside the bags using a 4 digit scale balance.",
    "To obtain the spleen weight, subtract the value of the empty preweighted plastic bag.Spleen homogenizationAdd 9 parts of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 per g of spleen (dilution 1:10), assuming that the volume of 1 g of spleen corresponds to 1 ml of PBS (e.g. 0.5 grams of spleen and 4.5 ml of PBS 0.1% Tween 20). Note: Homogenization is easier if a small volume is used at the beginning of the homogenization procedure and then, the remaining volume is completed to reach 1:10 dilution.Spleen homogenization is proficiently carried out by squeezing the organ inside bag by hand. Note: In order to release the intracellular bacteria, spleen cells are disrupted by squeezing the spleen tissue in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20.After homogenization of the samples, and depending on expected bacterial spleen colonization, decimal (or the required) dilutions are performed with 1x PBS (on 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes or 24 well plates).Note: Open the plastic bag carefully and widely (using steel wires) to avoid contamination of the pipette. For infections using 1 x 106 CFU of bacteria and ranging from 1-30 days, plate 102-105 dilutions.PlatingTwo plating methods are suggested:Method ADispense three separate 20 μl drops of each dilution on Tryptone Soya Agar (or the recommended media for growing the tested bacterium) plates using two plates per sample (Figure 2A). Then, let the drops to be absorbed in the agar surface (do not spread out the drops) prior incubation (5-10 minutes).Method BDispense one 100 μl in each agar plate and distribute the sample with a sterile Drigalski spatula until the inoculum is fully dispersed on the agar surface using two plates per sample (Figure 2B).  Notes: Method A is quicker and fewer agar plates are required since four dilutions can be positioned on each plate.",
    "In addition, up to three drops can be put for each dilution, lessening counting errors. A minimum of 500 bacteria per g of spleen can be detected if 101dilution is plated.Method B is slower and increases plate consuming but is more sensitive when low bacterial loads are expected. Colony counting is easier since an entire plate is used per dilution. A minimum of 100 bacteria per g of spleen can be detected if 101dilution is plated.Plates are incubated under the required conditions for the bacterial strain (e.g. 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere for 2-3 days) until colony forming units (CFUs) are evident.Count CFU in the various dilutions. Only use the plates (and the corresponding dilutions) in which separate colonies are obtained (10-30 CFUs in Figure 2A or 30-300 CFUs in Figure 2B).Calculate spleen bacterial loads by multiplying CFUs to the corresponding dilution and by 50 in method A or by 10 in method B, respectively.  CFUs means can be calculated either by CFUs/spleen (total CFUs recovered) or alternatively by CFUs/gram of spleen (total CFUs recovered divided by total grams of spleen). While the first method does not take into consideration spleen inflammation (size), the second method corrects for spleen swelling. In either case, it is always recommended to plot the spleen weight in a separate graph.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131029/20131029084522_2194.jpgFigure 2.
