  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All procedures were performed according to the guide-lines of the Institutional Animal Care and the National Research Council’s Guide for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (IACUC) and has undergone approval by The Ohio State University IACUC committee.\n1. Initial Setup\nSet up the EVLP circuit and have warm (37 °C) perfusate circulating through the system prior to incorporating the ex-planted lung (Figure 1).\nSet the warm water bath, used to jacket the perfusate reservoir, heat exchanger, and artificial thorax, to 37 °C and circulating (Figure 1).\nRun a de-oxygenation solution (e.g., 6% O2, 8% CO2, 84% N2) counter currently through the perfusate in the gas filter to ensure the perfusate has ~6% dissolved oxygen for the experiment.\n\tNOTE: This de-oxygenated perfusate enables the assessment of the lung function by measuring the oxygen introduced into the perfusate, post-organ.\nOpen the data acquisition program and connect the pulmonary artery pressure transducer, tracheal differential pressure transducer, respiratory flow differential pressure transducer, lung weight transducer, and pump speed transducer to the EVLP circuit and the data-acquisition / analog-to-digital converter box (Figure 2).\nSet up the operating table and operating tools at the EVLP circuit (Figure 3).\nSet up a small container of liquid nitrogen near the EVLP circuit if samples will be obtained.\n\tNOTE: The author’s system has been modified to collect pre-organ and post-organ perfusate without interrupting the pressure-flow dynamics that may potentially injure the lung.\n2. Preparation of Anesthetics and Heparin, Anesthetization of Rat\nPut on the following personal protective equipment (PPE) before handling rats and rat tissue: surgical mask, surgical gloves, and disposable gown.\nWeigh the rat and record the weight.\nPrepare 1,200 U/kg heparin.\nPrepare both 60 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg Xylazine in the same syringe, preparing the ketamine first.",
    "Intraperitoneally inject the mixture of ketamine and Xylazine into the rat and allow 5 min for the rat to become unconscious.\nConfirm proper anesthetization by checking toe pinch reflex. If the rat does not withdraw its toe, it is not feeling pain.\nMove rat to operating table, secure in supine position, and spray with alcohol for sterilization.\n3. Extraction and Initial Ventilation of the Rat Lungs\nPrepare 4-20 cm long silk sutures (3-0 or 4-0 should suffice).\nBegin recording data using the data acquisition program.\nCheck for appropriate depth of anesthesia, using surgical scissors enter peritoneal cavity by a midline laparotomy and inject heparin into the inferior Vena cava.\nCarry the incision cranially past the manubrium into the neck until the trachea is exposed. Do not rupture the thoracic cavity (Figure 4A).\nDissect posterior to the trachea in the midline and slide a silk suture posterior to the trachea (Figure 4B).\nRaise the anterior section of the trachea and make a transverse incision between the cartilaginous rings, high on the trachea. Do not cut through the posterior membranous portion of the trachea at this point (Figure 4C).\nCannulate the trachea with the trachea cannula and secure with the silk suture (Figure 4D). Ensure that the suture ligature is secured in the notching to mitigate migration of the cannula.\nConnect the trachea cannula to the ventilation circuit.\nTurn on the mechanical ventilator to start mechanically ventilating the lungs.\n\tNOTE: Initial settings were chosen to be a tidal volume of 4 ml/kg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 cmH2O. These settings are the initial settings and depending on the experimental conditions may be adjusted once the organ is in the ex-vivo perfusion system.",
    "Enter the thoracic cavity through the sternum/xyphoid and continue cranially towards the suprasternal notch. Take care to avoid touching the lungs.\n\tNOTE: As the rat lung is fragile, any inadvertent manipulation can lead to trauma and pulmonary edema (Figure 5A).\nUsing 2 retractors, retract the thoracic cavity to properly expose the anatomy (Figure 5A). Once again, take care to avoid touching the lungs.\nRemove the thymus with slight elevation and blunt dissection.\nShift the abdominal contents to a side to expose either the inferior vena cava (IVC) or the mesenteric vein (MV).\nIncise either the IVC or the MV to exsanguinate the rat, providing euthanasia.\nPlace a silk suture posterior to the pulmonary artery and aorta in preparation for securing the pulmonary artery cannula (Figure 5B).\nMake a 2-3 mm incision on the anterior surface of the right ventricular outflow tract and place the cannula in the incision and into the main pulmonary artery and secure with the silk suture (Figure 5C).\nTransect the apex of the heart to allow access to the left ventricle and flush any clots within the pulmonary vasculature by flowing ~15 ml of a low K+ electrolyte solution through the pulmonary artery and out through the apex of the heart into the chest cavity (Figure 5D).\nConnect the pulmonary artery (PA) cannula to the EVLP circuit. Ensure the inflow line coming from the circuit to the PA cannula is primed with perfusate to avoid any air entering the heart and lungs.",
    "Turn on the main peristaltic pump and set it to a low (~2 ml/min) speed to allow perfusate to run through the pulmonary artery and out the left ventricle into the chest cavity. **CRITICAL STEP** Ensure the PA pressure does not spike as this is a sign of either a blockage or poor cannulation (Figure 6).\nTurn off the peristaltic pump.\nPosition a silk suture behind the heart, around the ventricles (Figure 7).\nBegin the process of cannulating the left atrium by inserting a small pair of surgical forceps into the apex, through the mitral valve, and into the left atrium.\n\tNOTE: This will dilate the mitral valve and facilitate the cannulation. Aggressive dilation, or too deep dilation, can inadvertently lacerate the left atrium rendering the procurement ineffective.\nRemove the forceps from the heart.\nInsert the left atrium cannula into the apex through the mitral valve and into the left atrium.\nSecure the left atrium cannula with the silk suture behind the heart (Figure 8).\n\tNOTE: This suture can be “pre-tied” to facilitate cannulation.\nConnect the pulmonary artery cannula to the ex-vivo lung perfusion circuit (Figure 9A). Do not connect the left atrium cannula to the EVLP circuit until the heart-lung block has been completely removed from the body.\nClamp the esophagus with a hemostat and cut below the clamp (between the clamp and diaphragm) so that the esophagus can be used to raise the cardiopulmonary structures cephalad.\nBluntly dissect the surrounding tissue and cut the descending aorta and auxiliary vessels to free the heart-lung block as it is being raised via the esophagus (Figure 9B).\nTransect the trachea cephalad to the tracheal cannula to completely free the heart-lung block.\nRemove the heart-lung block and place in the designated location on the EVLP circuit (Figure 9C).",
    "Connect the left atrium cannula to the outflow line and start the main peristaltic pump (Figure 9D).\n4. Ex Vivo Perfusion of the Lungs\nQuickly remove the ventilation line from the top of the EVLP apparatus and attach the housing with the pressure sensors, then insert the ventilation line on top of the housing on the top of the EVLP apparatus.\n\tNOTE: This will allow the ventilation data to be recorded and pressure monitored.\nEnsure the bubble trap is filled with an adequate amount of perfusate so that no air bubbles (i.e., air emboli) are introduced to the lungs.\nSlowly change ventilation and perfusion settings to desired experimental levels during the initial 15 min. Additionally, during this initial ramp-up phase, increase the perfusion flow rate to the desired rate and/or pressure.\n\tNOTE: Programming the ventilator to produce intermittent sigh breaths, which facilitate movement of fluid out of the lung space and therefore delay the onset of edema, is recommended. These can be produced by ventilators equipped with the sigh function.\nDefine “Time 0” as the time when ventilation parameters are at a tidal volume of 4 ml/kg, PEEP at 2 cm H2O, and perfusion parameters are at their expected levels and remaining constant.\nIf necessary, take perfusate samples from the sample port, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen, and note the time of the samples.\nWhen the experiment is complete, isolate any necessary anatomical pieces for collection and either flash freeze in liquid nitrogen or place in fixing solution for further studies."
