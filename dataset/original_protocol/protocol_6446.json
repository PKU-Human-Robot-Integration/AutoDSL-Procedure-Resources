    "A general overview of the workflow is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327085138_7948.jpgFigure 1. Workflow summary of experimental steps for determination of Ca2+-binding to bGCAP1 by ITC Protein expressionNote: Protein expression and purification is not in the main focus of this report, see some steps below for a general understanding. Use E. coli cells (BL21-CodonPlus, Stratagene) containing plasmid with bovine GCAP1 (bGCAP1) sequence for overnight culture (v = 5 ml).Put 5 ml culture in 500 ml of LB medium to express protein in cells for up to 4 h after induction.Harvest the cells by centrifugation (5,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C). Resuspend cell pellet in 50 mM Tris Buffer with pH 7.5 (20 ml for pellet resulting from a bacterial culture of 500 ml).The protein was purified as described previously (Hwang and Koch, 2002; Koch and Helten, 2008) using a two-step chromatography protocol (size exclusion chromatography and anion exchange chromatography).bGCAP1 dialysisRun polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 12% polyacrylamide gel to confirm the protein purity (see image of gel below, Figure 2).Prepare (activate) the dialysis membrane with 5 mM EGTA using the following steps:Cut the membrane if necessary (10 cm should be sufficient) and put in a glass beaker filled with double-distilled water (ddH2O) and boil in microwave until water is boiling.Remove the hot water and fill with fresh water and add 5 mM EGTA and boil again.Remove the EGTA containing water and repeat the Step B2b twice.Store this activated membrane in a glass beaker with EGTA free water in a cold room at 4 °C. Storage under this condition is possible for a maximum of one month.Note: Never store the activated dialysis membrane without water. Never touch the dialysis membrane without gloves. Prepare dialyzing buffer (from now until ITC buffer, see below under “Recipes”) with pH 7.",
    "5.Take one fraction of freshly purified bGCAP1 protein after anion exchange chromatography (maximum volume 10 ml). See fraction the gel image (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327085726_1485.jpgFigure 2. SDS-PAGE analysis of bGCP1 fractions. Fractions obtained by anion exchange chromatography are analyzed, “wash” indicates the non-bound fractions, 1-5 are eluted bGCAP1 fractions. Sample #2 was of highest purity (≥ 95%) and was used in ITC experiments.Put on gloves and take the activated membrane. Put the knot at one side of the membrane (you can also use stoppers to avoid protein leakage during dialysis but doing a knot is more effective), fill the membrane with 10 ml bGCAP1 protein using a pipette. Now put another knot to the other side of the membrane and then add the stoppers to both ends (see Figure 3).Place the protein filled membrane into ITC buffer for overnight (minimum 3 L buffer for 10 ml of bGCAP1 solution).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327085755_9301.jpgFigure 3. Assembling of dialysis membrane. Positions of knots and stopper are indicated.Prepare chelex columns (anion exchange material for removing cations)Before use, the chelex material must be regenerated, regardless whether it was used before or freshly obtained from the supplier. For this purpose, a solvent filtration device is best suited. The device contains a filter holder and a chamber on top of it. The filtration device is commonly used for filtration of solutions via a pump. Further, a polypyro 0.2 µm membrane filter is needed. It is placed on a holder (part of the commercial filtration device) and keeps the chelex resin on top of it, when a vacuum pump is turned on and a washing solution is sucked through the filter. Thereby, it prevents the chelex material flowing into waste.",
    "The steps of the regeneration and washing procedure are as follows:Fill the chamber on top of the filter holder with chelex and wash with 500 ml of double-distilled water.Wash the chelex with 200 ml of 1 M HCl.Wash chelex with 500 ml of double-distilled water.Wash chelex with 200 ml of NaOH.Wash chelex with 500 ml of double-distilled water again. Suspend in double-distilled water and transfer the chelex material to a plastic bottle.Prepare a plastic bottle for chelex storage. Wash the bottle with a solution of 5 mM EGTA. Rinse with water before storing regenerated chelex.Adjust the pH of the chelex suspension, it should be neutral (around 7). Otherwise it might harm the protein function of bGCAP1. Adjusting the pH of the chelex material can be a very difficult and time consuming. See Notes for some tips.Take a used PD10 column and remove the column material (normally a gel filtration resin) and discard it. There is a small bed at the bottom of the PD10 column. Leave it inside the column. Use 6 M urea to clean the column in case the flow is slow. Fix the column to the column holder and fill it with chelex that is stored in water now (Figure 4). Let the water flows out and all chelex material stays inside the column. Your chelex bench column is ready to use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327085820_3056.jpgFigure 4. Filling chelex material into a used (“old”) PD10 column. A. The PD 10 column is fixed by a conventional column holder. Chelex can be seen as white material in the pipette tip. It is filled into the PD10 column. B. Chelex is settling by gravity flow. Water or buffer will pass the bed or small platform at the bottom, which retains the chelex material.",
    "Any kind of tube can be used for collecting the flow-through.Remove Ca2+ from bGCAP1 (decalcify)Use a pipette for removing bGCAP1 out of the dialysis membrane after overnight dialysis and transfer it to a 15 ml Falcon tube. Check protein concentration with Bradford protein quantification method (Bradford, 1976). Be aware that Coomassie dye-based protein determination methods depend on the nature of the protein used for calibration.Tip: Use a protein specific calibration curve. Create this curve by using your protein of interest as standard. Prepare standard concentrations (1-10 µg/ml) by using a second independent method of protein determination for example measuring the UV absorbance. Determine the molar extinction coefficient (Pace and Schmid, 1997) and employ it by using the Lambert-Beer law; see below Step E4. Take the chelex bench column and apply bGCAP1 (If the total column volume is 10 ml, 5 ml should be the bGCAP1 solution and 5 ml be the chelex material). Mix chelex with bGCAP1 inside column with slight hand rotations. Either leave the column in a cold room for half an hour or place it for end to end rotation in a cold room keeping bGCAP1 in direct contact with chelex.Note: It is necessary that bGCAP1 is in direct contact with the chelex material for removing Ca2+. Collect bGCAP1 from the column in Eppendorf tubes (2 ml) and label the tubes with protein concentrations after measurement.Decalcify the ITC bufferPrepare another chelex bench column with fresh chelex and fix the column in a column holder.Prepare plastic bottle (Ca2+-contamination might also originate from plastic material) to collect decalcified ITC buffer as following:Take any 100-200 ml plastic bottle and wash it with 1 M HCl.Rinse the bottle with water.Wash bottle again with 5 mM EGTA.Rinse the bottle with double-distilled water.",
    "Position the Ca2+-free plastic bottle under the column and pass 50 ml of ITC buffer (to avoid buffer mismatch prepare a larger stock of dialysis/ITC buffer).Check how much Ca2+ is left in decalcified buffer by determining free Ca2+ in the buffer using BAPTA as indicator. Install WinASPECT spectroanalytical software or use any other running software for a spectrophotometer. Open the program and initialize the program by turning on the UV-lamp. Set the lamp wavelength at 254 nm. Start absorbance measurement with reference sample that contains only buffer. Afterwards, measure absorbance of buffer mixed with BAPTA for three times (separate replicates) and calculate the average.Buffer preparation for BAPTA measurements:Take 500 µl of decalcified ITC buffer for reference measurement.Take 495 µl buffer and mix with 5 µl of BAPTA from 1 mM stock.vortex the sample.Calculate free Ca2+ in buffer with equations listed below:Total [BAPTA] = [BAPTAf] + [CaBAPTA][CaBAPTA] = [Ca2+f][BAPTAf]/KD(Ca)KD(Ca) = 107 nM; dissociation constant of Ca2+ binding to BAPTA under conditions of the ITC buffer (room temperature 22 ± 2 °C; Tsien, 1980).As a first step, determine the concentration of Ca2+-free BAPTA ([BAPTAf] by measuring the absorbance at 254 nm. According to Lambert-Beer's law A = ε × c × l, calculate c, concentration of [BAPTAf]; the other parameters are extinction coefficient ε = 1.6 × 104 M-1 × cm-1 and l = length of cuvette (e.g., 1 cm). With [BAPTAf] and the known concentration of total [BAPTA] (e.g., 20 µM) one can calculate [CaBAPTA].For example, the average value of absorbance might be 0.095.With A = ε × c × l we obtain0.095 = 1.6 × 104 M-1 × cm-1 × 1 cmand for concentration c = 5.9 µMThe concentration of Ca2+-bound to BAPTA is[CaBAPTA] = total [BAPTA] - [BAPTAf]= 10 µM - 5.9 µM= 4.1 µMleading to[Ca2+f] = 0.",
    "107 µM × 4.1 µM/5.9 µM[Ca2+f] = 0.074 µM or 74 nMA concentration of [Ca2+f] of 74 nM might be the lower limit, which can be achieved. A concentration of [Ca2+f] below 80 nM in the absence of Ca2+-chelating reagents like EGTA might be sufficient for most titrations. One can repeat the whole buffer decalcifying process to achieve this lower limit.Prepare the ITC systemWash the sample cell (the cavity for GCAP1 protein inside ITC instrument, Figure 5) with 5% Decon (system cleaning detergent). Start with 100 ml of 5% Decon followed by 400 ml of double-distilled water. Remove residual water from the sample cell by inserting the loading syringe (Figure 6) and wash the sample cell with decalcified ITC buffer. Afterwards, fill the sample cell with decalcified ITC buffer and leave it until protein sample is ready. This helps to equilibrate the sample cell and also removes free Ca2+.Wash the ITC sample syringe that is part of the ITC system (Figure 5) and automatically controlled by software. It contains the ligand or Ca2+ in our case. Attach a 5 ml small syringe piston (an Omnifix small 5 ml syringe or reciprocating pump, see materials) to the sample syringe port with small plastic tube (Figure 5A). Fill a special ITC tube that comes with the ITC instrument with 5% Decon and fix it in holder under the ITC sample syringe (during titrations the ITC tube carries water to wash the syringe). Use the syringe piston to catch the 5% Decon after passing through the sample syringe. Repeat the same process with at least 30 ml of water to remove any remaining detergent inside.Dry the ITC sample syringe. Remove the ITC tube from the syringe holder and let syringe tip stay in air.",
    "Use the small syringe piston to pull air through the sample syringe. Remove all drops of waters by repeating the process several times.Tip: Click purge and refill button from software, this process will bring all the water at syringe tip and place a kim wipe at the tip to catch all water.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327085910_6443.jpgFigure 5.

The sample tube for filling the Ca2+-solution into the sample syringe.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327085929_9737.jpgFigure 6. Image of the loading syringePrepare protein sample for sample cell, syringe and reference cellSample cell: Calculate how much bGCAP1 is required for one measurement (20 µM final concentrations; see Note #17 for calculation of optimal ratio of ligand to protein), add the rest of decalcified ITC buffer to reach final concentration. Prepare another chelex column with at least 2 ml of chelex material inside. Add the protein sample to the column and leave it on ice.Prepare the sample for filling the ITC sample syringe (Ca2+ in our case): use calcium standard solution, which is 10 g/L (WTW D-82362 Weilheim) and dilute with decalcified ITC buffer to prepare a Ca2+ solution with a final concentration of 0.5 mM.Collect the bGCAP1 sample from the chelex column in a tube (Tip: every time wash the tubes with decalcified buffer before collecting a bGACP1 sample from the column to avoid any contamination of free calcium that might come from the tube walls).",
    "Put small magnet stir bars in the tubes and degas both samples (Ca2+ and bGCAP1 solution) for at least 10 min. Set the degasser temperature at 25 °C as the experiment is also performed at 25 °C. Degasser is also part of ITC system and provided by ITC suppliers.Reference cell (second cavity inside ITC instrument to hold water or buffer as reference): Fill double-distilled water in a fresh tube and degas it for 10 min. Transfer the water to the reference cell with a loading syringe (the loading syringe is only used to load a protein solution into the sample cell and water or buffer into the reference cell). The syringe also comes with ITC instrument (be very careful to avoid adding air bubbles in cells).Load samplesFix the tube containing the Ca2+-solution under the ITC sample syringe and load sample very carefully (Figure 5B). Sometimes a few air bubbles are left inside the sample holder. To avoid trapping of air bubbles, click close port button in the software and pull the piston very carefully at the same time. (This saves sample and avoids adding air bubbles). Click purge and refill button in the software twice to release the entire sample back into the tube and let it slowly load again. This trick removes all small air bubbles.Wash the loading syringe with water and remove the entire decalcified ITC buffer from the sample cell, which was used to wash the sample cell. Remove the buffer from the loading syringe and make sure there is no buffer left in the sample cell. Do not touch the loading syringe with anything at this moment and fill it with bGCAP1 sample after degassing. Insert the loading syringe needle into sample cell and release the sample slowly.",
    "(Tip: loading sample with the loading syringe can easily create small air bubbles that can affect the measurement. To avoid loading air bubbles proceed as follows: when the sample is visible in the sample reservoir, load back a small volume and release with a short pressure pulse so that all bubbles appear on the top, then remove them). Remove all excess sample from the sample reservoir.Start the titration experimentHold the ITC sample syringe in one hand and wash its tip with decalcified ITC buffer (the syringe tip was inside the Ca2+ solution and we need to prevent any contamination of bGCAP1 sample with Ca2+ before starting the experiment). Use a minimum of 1 ml decalcified ITC buffer to wash the syringe tip. Afterwards, remove extra buffer drops around the syringe tip with kimwipes and place the syringe to the sample cell.Note: Do it very slowly and be very careful not to hit the tip with anything that can bend the tip easily. After loading to the sample cell, take a small volume (a few µl) of bGCAP1 to check the final protein concentration in case it might have been changed due to previous steps (GCAP1 sample might be diluted due to passing over the chelex column). It is important to mention the correct protein concentration to the software before starting the experiment.Set program parameters as following:Total number of injects = 50Cell temp °C = 25reference power (µcal/s) = ideal is between 3-10cell concentration (mM) = 0.02syringe concentrations (mM) = 0.5injection volume (µl) = 5Initial delay (s) = 210Injection space time (s) = 60Feedback mode/gain = HighStirring speed (rmp) = 307See the following link for more details about ITC instrument.https://ctrstbio.org.uic.edu/manuals/vpitc_manual.pdf[href=https://ctrstbio.org.uic.edu/manuals/vpitc_manual.pdf]Measurement of reference experimentsReference experiments are necessary for data analysis to correct the any heat change by dilution.",
    "These can originate from diluting the ligand into buffer or from injecting a buffer solution into the macromolecule (bGCAP1) solution, whereby dilution of the ligand into the buffer solution is more significant, because ligand concentrations are typically 20 times larger than that of macromolecules.Load Ca2+ solution in ITC sample syringe with the same concentration as above (0.5 mM) and load (fill) decalcified ITC buffer in the sample cell. Record the heat change of dilution from ligand injection into buffer.Load protein solution in sample cell with same concentration of bGCAP1 (20 µM) and load decalcified buffer to the syringe. Record the heat change of dilutions from buffer into macromolecule titration as outlined above."
