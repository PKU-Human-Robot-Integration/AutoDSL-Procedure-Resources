    "This protocol describes the extraction and postmortem perfusing fixation of the inner ear in mice. Before working with animals, appropriate ethical approvals may be required. After whole inner ears are extracted, natural openings as well as additional holes in the otic capsule allow perfusion of fixative through the fluid compartments to enable proper fixation. A subsequent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-based decalcification of the bony tissue enables proper sectioning of the samples with a cryostat. Bone removal is accelerated with a rapid microwave histoprocessor. Once the bone has been decalcified, samples are cryoembedded and cut at 5- to 10-µm thickness on a cryostat.\nThe mouse strain we selected to use in this protocol is CBA/J, which is commonly used in auditory research because of its relatively good hearing performance with age (Liu et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-bib-0008]). The inner ear extraction and postmortem fixation are critical steps for tissue preservation. Conservation of the 3D protein structure and especially the antibody epitopes in the cochlear tissue is important to obtain better results in immunostaining. We used young adult mice aged 21 days here because older mice presented lower staining intensities with these antibodies (Luque et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-bib-0009]).\nMaterials\nCBA/J strain mice, 21 days old (JAX no. 000656; Charles River)\n4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (formalin, PFA; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0005])\n0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0003])\n1 g/L Na+ azide in 0.1 M PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0004])\n20% (w/v) EDTA in 0.1 M PBS\n10% and 15% (w/v) sucrose\nTissue-Tek O.C.T.™ compound (Scigen, ThermoFisher Scientific)\n96% (v/v) ethanol\nThick (Dumont forceps no. 4) and fine forceps (Dumont forceps no. 5 and no. 55)\nScissors\nStereomicroscope (Zeiss OPMI 11)\n5-ml glass vials with plastic lids\nHorizontal shaker (Heidolph, Titramax 101)\nCircular rotator (e.g., Stuart Tube Rotator SB2)\nHistological cassettes\n250-ml graduated beaker without spout and with lid",

Cut the skull with sharp scissors in the medial plane sagittally, and carefully remove the two halves of the brain with a small spoon.\n4. Extract the right and left inner ears, located on each side of the skull.\nThe vestibule will be extracted together with the cochlea and a small part of the cerebellum during the inner ear removal. These tissues will be present on cochlear sections and may be used as positive control tissue for the immunostaining if applicable.\n5. Penetrate the round window with fine forceps and remove the stapes (oval window).\n6. Make a small hole in the apical turn with fine forceps, close to the helicotrema.\n7. Using a disposable 1-ml Pasteur pipet, gently perfuse ice-cold 4% PFA through the openings created in steps 5 and 6 to ensure that all perilymphatic compartments are flushed with fixative solution (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ebf1a211-42da-4128-8014-53f73e556429/cpz1239-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nInner ear fixation. After the inner ear is extracted from the mouse, fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) is performed for 16-18 hr at 4°C. The 4% PFA is perfused through the cochlea via three openings of the otic capsule: the round and oval windows as well as a small puncture in the apical turn close to the helicotrema that are opened without damaging the sensorineural tissue. Subsequently, the fixative is gently perfused with a small pipet through each opening.",
    "8. Transfer the specimens in 4% PFA to 5-ml glass vials with plastic lids and keep them overnight (16-18 hr) at 4°C with constant movement on a horizontal shaker set at 300 rpm.\n9. Rinse the specimens five times for 5 min each time with 0.1 M PBS while agitating them gently on a circular rotator (Stuart Tube Rotator SB2, 20 rpm).\nAgitating the samples in 0.1 M PBS accelerates removal of excess fixative. After this step, samples may be immediately embedded or stored in 1 g/L Na+ azide in 0.1 M PBS at 4°C until use.\nDecalcification and embedding\n10. Transfer specimens to standard histological cassettes (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0002]).\nAlways maintain the samples in 0.1 M PBS to prevent drying of the tissue.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5ea52f4e-3bfe-4bc6-913f-c341645b24e2/cpz1239-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nInner ear decalcification. Decalcification of the inner ear is performed in a rapid microwave histoprocessor. (A) Multicompartment histocassettes. Four pairs of inner ears may be decalcified at once in one cassette. (B) Histocassettes are placed in a holder with space for four cassettes. Sixteen pairs of inner ears may be decalcified at once in one run with this configuration. A magnetic stirrer is attached at the base of the cassette holder to keep fluids constantly moving and facilitate the decalcification. (C) The cassette holder with the specimens is placed in 200 ml of 20% EDTA inside a beaker and covered with a lid. (D) The cassette holder is placed inside the beaker in a microwave support and (E) the beaker is transferred into the microwave histoprocessor. Correct positioning is important for homogenous heat distribution. (F) The specimens are decalcified at 37°C for 220 min.\n11. Place the cassettes into the cassette holder. The cassette holder attaches to a magnetic stirrer to allow agitation of the EDTA solution added in the next step (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0002]).",
    "Using multi-compartment cassettes can increase the number of inner ears that can be decalcified in one run.\n12. Transfer the cassette holder into a beaker without a spout and fill the beaker up to 200 ml with 20% (w/v) EDTA in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.2-7.4.\n13. Cover the beaker with a lid and place it into a microwave support (Fig. 2C and D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0002]).\n14. Transfer the microwave support with the samples into the microwave (Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0002]). Irradiate the samples at 800 W microwave power with stirring for 220 min at 37°C to decalcify the inner ears (Fig. 2F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0002]).\nDecalcification can be also done with a standard incubator. In this case, samples should be incubated in 20% EDTA with stirring at 37°C for 0.5-1 days inside the incubator.\n15. Wash the samples with 0.1 M PBS five times for 5 min each with stirring at room temperature.\n16. Incubate the samples with 10% sucrose for 30 min at room temperature.\nThe sucrose solution and O.C.T.™ compound are used to preserve the structure of the tissue. The sugar will perfuse inside the ear and will later be replaced by the O.C.T.™ compound. Exposure to ascending concentrations of sucrose is necessary for proper penetration of the tissue because O.C.T.™ compound has a low viscosity. In later steps, the tissue will be frozen, which would cause water inside the tissue to freeze and expands when transformed to ice; cryopreservatives such as sucrose adhere to tissue structures to diminish local ice crystal formation and thereby improve cellular preservation. The cryoembedding protocol is adapted from previous studies (Coleman, Rickard, de Silva, & Shepherd, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-bib-0004]).\n17. Incubate the samples with 15% sucrose for 30 min at room temperature on a shaker set at 300 rpm.",
    "18. Incubate the samples with 15% sucrose overnight (20-22 hr) at 4°C on a shaker set at 300 rpm.\nIncubation with 15% sucrose at 4°C can be performed for extended periods. For longer incubations, this solution may be prepared with 1 g/L of Na+ azide in 0.1 M PBS to avoid growth of fungi. The quality of the tissue or intensity of immunostaining should not be affected by extending this incubation step up to 1-2 days.\n19. Incubate the samples with a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 15% sucrose and O.C.T.™ compound (cryoembedding medium) overnight (20-22 hr) at 4°C with constant movement on a shaker set at 300 rpm.\n20. Incubate the samples with O.C.T.™ compound overnight (20-22 hr) at 4°C with constant movement on a shaker at 300 rpm. Before introducing the samples into O.C.T.™, it is necessary to remove the air bubbles from the medium, so they do not enter inside the ear. For this purpose, a desiccator is used and vacuum is created for at least 1 hr to remove all air bubbles from the O.C.T.™ compound.\nTo manipulate the tissue and move it between containers, use a 5-ml pipet. As the bone is decalcified, the tissue will become susceptible to mechanical damage during handling. Cut off the tip of a 5-ml disposable Pasteur pipet and gently suck up the ear to transfer it between molds without touching it with any instrument.\n21. Prepare a mix of dry ice and 96% ethanol, and mix until it acquires a slurry consistency.",
    "22. Prepare one cryomold per ear (the size needed will depend on the sample; for inner ears the 15 × 15-mm conical Peel-A-Way® molds from Ted Pella, Inc. are suitable). Fill the mold halfway with O.C.T.™ compound, and place under vacuum for at least 1 hr to remove air bubbles (see step 20).\n23. Place the inner ear inside the mold. Use the stereomicroscope to orient the cochlea appropriately. The selected orientation depends on what the researcher wants to study; the two most common orientations for sectioning are parallel to the midmodiolar and horizontal plane (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0003]). In the “midmodiolar orientation,” the ear is placed with the oval window facing the base of the mold and the round window facing up (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0003] and 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0003]). For the “horizontal orientation,” the vestibule is instead positioned towards the upper part of the mold and the cochlea on the base (Fig. 3C-E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0003]).\n“Midmodiolar orientation” is useful to study the transition between peripheral and central nervous system. The three cochlear turns can be observed in only one section. “Horizontal orientations” are more useful to study and count hair cells and investigate sensory innervation.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6ccc07d8-ec73-4050-ba47-36f3e8ed87fc/cpz1239-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Inner ear embedding and orientation of the samples. After fixation, the tissue is embedded in O.C.T.™ compound. The inner ears need to be oriented differently depending on the study being perform. Midmodiolar (A and B) and horizontal (C, E, and D) orientations are preferred in hearing research. (A) The midmodiolar orientation situates the oval window facing the researcher and the skull touching the base of the cryomold. The axis of the cochlea is parallel to the ground. (B) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a midmodiolar section. With this orientation, the three turns (apex, middle, and base) are visible simultaneously in one section. (C) In horizontal orientation, the vestibular apparatus is located on the upper part of the mold, while the cochlea is touching the ground. (D and E) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of an apical (D) and basal (E) sections oriented horizontally. With this orientation, one turn will be visible in each section.\n24. Fill up the mold containing the oriented cochlea completely with O.C.T.™. Pour the medium down slowly inside the mold to avoid changing the position of the cochlea and transfer it into the slurry mix prepared in step 21. The sample will be frozen within seconds.\nCAUTION: Dry ice is toxic when inhaled, so this embedding protocol must be performed under a fume hood. The alcoholic slurry improves thermal conductivity and accelerates freezing compared to gas-phase-mediated freezing.\n25. After 1 min, the samples will be completely frozen. Place the O.C.T.™ blocks containing the ears on dry ice for 20 min to allow the adhesive alcohol to dry.",
    "When several tissue blocks are embedded at once, it is necessary to dry them (remove the remaining ethanol) for storage at −20°C or −80°C. The blocks are processed with a commercial vacuum sealer to prevent humidity loss through sublimation. Avoiding freezer burns by storing specimen blocks in evacuated and sealed plastic bags ensures good consistency for cryosectioning over longer periods.\nCryosectioning\n26. Section the samples with a cryomicrotome. For inner ear sectioning, the temperature of the chamber is set at −20°C and object temperature at −22°C.\nWhen the tissue is frozen at −80°C, leave the specimen blocks inside the cryomicrotome for at least 1 hr to temper until the temperature of the blocks is fully equalized to the chamber temperature (–20°C). When blocks are stored at −20°C, sectioning can be started directly after the microtome reaches the selected temperatures.\n27. Collect sections sequentially on Superfrost™ slides until approximately a 25-slide distance from the apex (at 10-µm section thickness). Then, start a second column in each slide with sections from the central modiolar region with good presentation of the middle turn. Collect a third column with the basal turn and a fourth and fifth column with the basal hook region of the tonotopic axis. In this case, all the slides present a section from each cochlear turn, apart from the vestibule and the cerebellum.\nSlides should be stored at −20°C in freezer slides boxes. Leave them at room temperature for 10 min before use.",
    "This protocol details double colorimetric immunostaining with 3,3′diaminobenzidine (DAB) and Fast Red salt chromophores. Many epitopes require an antigen retrieval before immunostaining is performed. This pretreatment of the sections is needed to make the epitopes accessible for the antibodies especially after aldehyde fixation. After a heat pretreatment in buffer solutions, immunostaining with colorimetric or fluorometric detection techniques are performed.\nMaterials\nSlides containing O.C.T.™-fixed mouse inner ear sections\n4% (w/v) PFA (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0005])\n0.1 M PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0003])\nVentana Discovery reagents IHC:\nDAB MAP KIT (Streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase Kit with CuSO4 DAB visualization, cat. no. 760-124, Roche Medical Systems Inc.), including reaction reagents blocker-D, inhibitor D, SA-HRP D, DAB D, DAB H2O2 D, and Copper D\nRED MAP KIT (streptavidin-biotin-phosphatase kit with Fast Red salt visualization, cat. no. 760-123, Roche Medical Systems Inc.), including reaction reagents blocker R1, SA-Alk phosphatase R, activator R, naphthol R, Fast Red R, and Fast Red R2\nHematoxylin (cat. no. 790-2208)\nBluing reagent (cat. no. 760-2037)\nVentana Discovery buffers IHC:\nDiscovery wash (cat. no. 950-100)\nLiquid coverslip (LCS, cat. no. 650-010)\nReaction buffer (cat. no. 950-300)\nCC1m-VENTANA® buffer (Tris-EDTA based buffer, pH 8, cat. no. 950-500, Roche Medical Systems Inc.)\nCC2m-VENTANA® buffer (Citrate based buffer, pH 6, cat. no. 760-107, Roche Medical Systems Inc.)\nVentana antibody diluent (cat. no.

Introduce the slides in the Ventana Discovery automated immunostainer (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0004] and 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0004]).\nThe reagents in the Ventana immunostainer used for IHC are washing solution (Disco wash) that contains a Triton-X-100-free detergent solution that also serves for tissue permeabilization; LCS, an oily solution applied over the slide to avoid drying of the tissue; a Tris·Cl washing buffer (reaction buffer), and two buffers for antigen retrieval (CC1 and CC2).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/058405f2-d3d8-4cc1-8753-c85bd7485e06/cpz1239-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
    "Ventana immunostainer. Colorimetric stainings are performed in an automated immunostainer (Ventana Discovery, Roche). (A) The reagents needed to perform the protocol are loaded into the machine directly. From left to right: discovery wash; liquid coverslip (LCS) that prevents reagent evaporation; 2× SSC buffer used for in situ hybridization; reaction buffer, a Tris-based buffer used for incubating the antibodies and hematoxylin; CC1, an EDTA-based buffer for pretreatment (pH 8-8.5); CC2, a citrate based buffer (pH 6); and option, a citrate buffer used in in situ hybridization. (B) The slides containing the sections are loaded into a carousel with space for 20 slides. Each slide may be treated differently with distinct pretreatments and antibodies. (C) Reagent carousel. Different staining kits may be loaded. (D) DAB MAP Kit is shown in detail. First, after the manual titration of the primary antibody, an inhibitor of the endogenous peroxidase (Inhibitor D) is applied. Blocker D is applied before the DAB stain, as are a high protein-salt blocking solution; DAB reaction reagents such as the streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP), DAB chromophore, and the enzyme substrate H2O2; and finally Copper D, a metal enhancer that gives the reddish-brown color to the stain. The nuclei are stained with hematoxylin II and then for 2 min with bluing reagent, which gives a bluish color. (E) The RED MAP Kit consists of a blocker (as for the DAB MAP kit in D), the streptavidin alkaline phosphatase, an activator of the enzyme, the substrate, a naphthol phosphate, and two dispensers of the chromogen (Fast Red).\n4. Place the reagents from the DAB MAP and RED MAP KITS on the reagent tray of the Ventana Discovery instrument (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0004]).",
    "5. Set the instrument to start the immunostaining. Details of the immunostaining protocol are provided on the printed label attached to the slide. If appropriate, different retrieval buffers and heat pretreatments cycles can be applied depending on the localization of the antigen and antibody (see Critical Parameters).\n6. Heat and EDTA buffer: Different heat steps are applied automatically by the immunostainer (1× room-temperature preincubation for 2 min, 1× 95°C for 8 min, 5× 100°C for 4 min, 1× room temperature for 8 min) while incubating the sections in EDTA buffer (CC1m).\nWhen the epitopes are located at the neuron membrane, a short heat pretreatment with EDTA is sufficient to unmask the antigens. See Critical Parameters for discussion of other pretreatment methods. Several preheating steps in the automated immunostainer are used because reagent incubation occurs with an overlaying oil film acting as an incubation chamber. Temperatures of 100°C also lead to rapid evaporation of the oil film, so the procedure is limited in time and requires several repetitions to reach the required duration of the heat-induced antigen retrieval. Procedures from other vendors using a solid incubation chamber (e.g., Leica® Biosystems) do not require multiple heat cycles.\n7. To reduce endogenous peroxidase activity, treat the slides with an excess of H2O2 substrate (inhibitor D from DAB MAP kit) for 4 min.\n8. Incubate the primary antibody from the first immunostaining for 1 hr. Use antibodies diluted in Ventana antibody diluent, which contains 0.3% protein in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.3) and 0.05% ProClin 300 as preservative.\nThe primary antibody used in our study was anti-rabbit HCN2 diluted to 1:3000 in antibody diluent. 100 µl of this solution is applied on each slide.",
    "As the incubation is performed in LCS, it is necessary to prepare a four times more concentrated stock dilution for the antibody (e.g., 1:750) to reach the desired final dilution on the slide.\n9. Rinse the slides twice with reaction buffer.\n10. Incubate the secondary antibody for the first immunostaining for 30 min.\nThe secondary antibody we used was a biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1:400.\n11. Perform DAB incubation. First, apply blocker D (high-protein salt blocking solution) for 2 min to reduce background staining, and then incubate with the enzyme streptavidin–horse peroxidase for 16 min. Rinse slides four times and then add diaminobenzidine (DAB) D and DAB H2O2 (substrate for the peroxidase) for 8 min. Finally, apply Copper D (CuSO4) for 4 min to intensify the staining (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0004]).\nStaining with DAB is performed first because the staining with this chromophore is highly stable in order to survive heating steps and further processing.\n12. Heat the slide to 85°C and incubate for 8 min. The primary and secondary antibody complexes will be denatured, but the DAB precipitate will survive this treatment.\n13. Rinse the slide with reaction buffer and apply the second primary antibody for the second immunostaining raised in the same species. Incubate for 1 hr.\nIn this case, we apply anti-rabbit HCN4 at a 1:3000 dilution.\n14. Incubate the sections for 30 min with the secondary antibody, biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit at a 1:400 dilution.\n15. Apply the streptavidin alkaline phosphatase and incubate 30 min. Rinse the slide with reaction buffer and incubate 4 min with Activator R and Naphthol R (substrate for alkaline phosphatase). Apply Fast R and fast R 2 (Fast Red salts) sequentially to the slide, incubating for 8 min each (Fig. 4E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0004]).\n16. Apply hematoxylin counterstain and incubate for 2 min.",
    "17. Apply bluing reagent for 2 min to turn hematoxylin staining into blue color.\n18. Rinse the slides with reaction buffer and remove them from the immunostainer.\n19. Rinse slides with distilled water and soapy water to remove the oily coating applied by the immunostainer. Rinse three more times for at least 1 min each in distilled water.\n20. Leave the slides to dry overnight at room temperature, as Fast Red salts are soluble in alcohols (or alternatively use an aqueous mounting medium).\n21. Mount slides the next day as follows. First, incubate slides in xylol for 2 min. Let the slides dry for 10 min and mount with Entellan® mounting medium. Gently apply 4-5 drops of the mounting solution and cover them with coverslips (24 × 50 mm). Let them dry.\n22. Image the slides. Sample results are shown in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0005], with SGNs in CBA/J mouse showing coexpression of HCN2 (DAB, brown) and HCN4 (Fast Red) (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0005]). After color deconvolution of the image, single channels are visualized: HCN2 (Fig. 5A1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0005], DAB) and HCN4 (Fig. 5A2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0005], Fast Red). High magnification of the SGNs shows HCN2 and HCN4 staining at the soma membrane and cytoplasm (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0005]).

After that point, the slides can be analyzed under the microscope.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bde901db-d7cc-434a-ae2b-2ce1fb575f98/cpz1239-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

Some antibodies, such as HCN antibodies, do not require antigen retrieval; Triton X-100 permeabilization on the slide is sufficient for the antibody to access its epitope.\nMaterials\nSlides containing O.C.T.™-fixed mouse inner ear sections\nDistilled water\nBlocking solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0001])\n0.1 M PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0004])\nPrimary antibody solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0006])\nAnti-HCN2 primary antibody (Alomone Labs, cat. no.

Circle the sections on the slides with a hydrophobic pen so that the different solutions used in the protocol will be retained on the slide in small volumes.\n2. Place slides in a humid chamber and introduce wet paper towels into the chamber to generate moisture (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/96214c98-2225-4b4b-ae3f-3715df243cd8/cpz1239-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nManual immunofluorescence staining.

    "3. Place the slides in distilled water inside a staining jar to rehydrate them and remove the cryoembedding medium from the sections.\n4. Carefully apply 300-400 µl of blocking solution to the areas of the slides marked by the hydrophobic pen, and incubate the slides inside the humid chamber for 1 hr.\nIn this case, the permeabilization retrieval is performed with Triton X-100, which is a component of the blocking solution. For other antibodies, a Ventana immunostainer, rice cooker, or autoclave may be used just to perform the heat antigen retrieval. After several rinses with 0.1 M PBS to remove other reagents from the slide (five rinses for 5 min each), this manual Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-prot-0003] can be started.\n5. Prepare dilutions of primary antibody in a suitable solution that also contains some protein to avoid antibody aggregation and a detergent for permeabilization (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-rec-0006] for primary antibody solution).\nUsually, the concentration used for fluorescent staining is roughly double that used for colorimetric staining. The most suitable concentration needs to be tested before for each antibody.\n6. Discard the blocking solution. Pipet 300 µl of primary antibody dilution onto the slide. Keep overnight inside the humid chamber at 4°C to allow the antibody solution to slowly penetrate the section with a low binding affinity due to the cold temperature. This reduces nonspecific binding of the primary antibody.\nAvoid allowing the sections to dry during the change of solutions. A preincubation at 4°C will increase the intensity of staining. A preincubation over a weekend is also a possible option for antibodies that present lower signals or for thicker sections.\n7. Incubate the primary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature.",
    "At room temperature the antibody will bind to the epitope with maximum affinity. For low-intensity signals or “weak” antibodies (with low affinity to epitope), the primary antibody incubation time can be increased up to several hours.\n8. Working in the dark, prepare dilutions of secondary antibody in secondary antibody solution. The fluorochromes attached to the secondary antibodies quench when exposed to light so that the staining signal decreases. Use specific microcentrifuge tubes for fluorescence that protect the antibodies against light. When this is not possible, aluminum foil can be used to wrap standard microcentrifuge tubes to prevent the antibodies from being exposed to light.\nThe primary antibody used in our study was rabbit anti-HCN2 at a 1:500 dilution.\n9. Discard primary antibody solution and rinse the slides in 0.1 M PBS three times for 5 min each.\n10. Apply secondary antibody dilution and incubate the sections for 2 hr at room temperature in the dark.\nAlexa Fluor® 488 secondary antibodies are applied during the first immunostaining as this fluorochrome is very resistant to heat and further processing. The dilution used for this anti-rabbit secondary antibody is 1:2000.\n11. Thoroughly rinse the slides five times with 0.1 M PBS for 10 min each time.\nTo decrease background fluorescence, slides may be rinsed in large staining jars with 200 ml buffer each time.\n12. Postfix the antibody-fluorochrome complex with 4% PFA for 30 min.\nThis step stabilizes the antibody-fluorochrome complex and is required because the specific antibody bonds are weak and would not be maintained through the later protocol steps.\n13. Rinse the slides twice with 0.1 M PBS for 5 min each.",
    "14. Heat the slides in a heating plate for 8 min at 81°C. To avoid allowing the sections to dry out, apply 0.1 M PBS to the slide surface after 5 min (Fig. 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0006] and 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.239#cpz1239-fig-0006]).\n15. Let the slide equilibrate to room temperature. Discard the remaining 0.1 M PBS from the slide.\n16. Perform a second immunostaining with a second primary antibody raised in the same species as the first primary antibody applied in step 6.\nThe second primary antibody used in our study was rabbit anti-HCN4 at a 1:200 dilution.\n17. Repeat steps 6-11 using the antibodies selected for the second immunostaining.\nThe second secondary antibody used in our study was an anti-rabbit DyLight® 649 at a dilution of 1:500.\n18. Rinse the slides in 0.1 M PBS five times for 10 min each.\n19. Mount the slides with an aqueous mounting medium such as Vectashield™ with DAPI. Apply two to three drops to each slide, and cover them with 24 × 50-mm coverslips.\n20. Keep the slides at 4°C for 10 min. Seal the coverslips to the slide with nail polish. Store the slides at 4°C until ready to check the slides on the microscope.\nThe nail polish selected should be transparent and without any components that may introduce autofluorescence to the slide.\n21. Check the slides under a microscope to assess the staining quality, and proceed to imaging the slides.\nSlides should be imaged at room temperature. For this purpose, leave the slides at room temperature for at least 10 min before using them.",
