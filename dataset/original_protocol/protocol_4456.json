    "Passage the mutant virus library (pool 1) in Huh-7.5.1 cells for selectionSeed Huh-7.5.1 cells in T-150 cell culture flasks at 50% confluence (approximately 4 million cells in 24 ml of complete growth medium).Aspire growth medium in the flask using a Pasteur pipette and infect the monolayer cells with mutant HCV library at M.O.I = 0.1 [the virus library should be titrated in advance as described earlier by Arumugaswami et al. (2008)].Incubate the cells at 37 °C incubator for 6 h. Aspirate old medium and put 24 ml of fresh complete growth medium (DMEM with 10% of FBS, 1x NEAA and 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin/Glutamine).Incubate the virus infected cells for 72 h at 37 °C before Huh7.5.1 cells reach 100% confluence (approximately 8 million cells).Collect the supernatant in a 50 ml Falcon tube.Wash the cells with 1x PBS once.Trypsinize the cells with 2 ml of 1x trypsin for 1 min at RT and tap flask to completely loosen cells. Stop trypsin by adding 24 ml of complete growth medium as mentioned in step A3.Distribute cells to 3 new flasks at 8 ml/flask. Distribute 8 ml of collected supernatant from step A5 into each flask from step A9, and add 8 ml of fresh complete growth medium into each flask to reach 24 ml/flask.Incubate the virus infected cells for 72 h at 37 °C before they reach 100% confluence.Collect the supernatant (144 h post infection) and store as library pool 2.Titrate the virus titer in pool 2.Repeat steps from A1 to A13 to passage the pool 2 and collect pool 3.Repeat steps from A1 to A13 to passage the pool 3 and collect pool 4.Repeat steps from A1 to A13 to passage the pool 4 and collect pool 5.",
    "Determine the frequency of each mutant virus at each passageExtract HCV genomic RNA from each pool (pool 1 through pool 5) with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit for viral RNA purification from QIAGEN. All of the reagents used in this step are all from this kit, if not otherwise stated.The supernatant of each virus pool was spun at 1,500 x g for 10 min to get rid of possible contamination from cell associated RNA.Take 1.4 ml of supernatant from each sample in a 15 ml Falcon tube.Lyse the virus with 5.6 ml of lysis buffer (AVL) containing 1 μg/ml of carrier RNA (5.6 μg of total carrier RNA per sample to avoid overload of the columns) by pulse-vortexing for 15 sec and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.Add 5.6 ml of ethanol (100%) to the sample, and mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 sec.Transfer 630 μl of the solution from step 4 to the QIAamp Mini column (in a 2 ml collection tube). Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min and discard the filtrate collected in the collection tube.Repeat step 5 until all of lysate step 4 is loaded onto the spin column.Add 500 μl of buffer AW1 onto the QIAamp Mini column, and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min.Place the QIAamp Mini column in a clean 2 ml collection tube and discard the filtrate.Add 500 μl of buffer AW2 and centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the filtrate collected in the collection tube.Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 2 min to completely dry the column.Place the QIAamp Mini column in a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and add 60 μl of buffer AVE to the filter area of the column.",
    "Close the cap and incubate at room temperature for 1 min. Spin at full speed (20,000 x g) for 1 min to elute the RNA.Reverse transcription reaction and PCR amplification of the targeted region for sequencing. We use SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase kit from Life Technologies, and all of the reagents are from the kit if not otherwise stated.Set up 20 μl reverse transcription reaction with 10 μl of RNA isolated from each pool (pool 1-5) and the input RNA library (pool 0) which was used to reconstitute the mutant virus library as mentioned by Qi et al. (2014). Add the following components to a nuclease-free Eppendorf tube:table:",

For example, We would use 28 PCR amplification cycles at this step if 30 cycles would saturate the reaction according to the Q-PCR result.Purify the PCR amplicon from each PCR reaction with PCR purification kit from Life Technologies and measure the concentration of each sample with NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.Construct sequencing samples for Illumina sequencing.Take 1 μg of each PCR amplicon product from each sample and set up the following reaction with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to add 5’-phosphate to amplicons to allow subsequent ligation.table:\n﻿0,1\nPCR amplicons,5-17 μl (1 μg total)\nT4 PNK Reaction Buffer,2 μl\nT4 PNK,1 μl\nH2O,0-12 μl\nTotal,20 μl\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1 h and purify the sample with PCR purification columns in 40 μl.dA-Tailing with Klenow Fragment (3'-->5' exo-):table:\n﻿0,1\nPCR amplicons,37 μl\nNEB buffer 2 (10x),5 μl\ndATP (1 mM),5 μl",

Each pair-end sequence read in the HiSeq data file was mapped to the reference sequence once it passes the quality control (cut off 35). Each miss match from the reference sequence will be identified as a mutation and the number of each mutation will be counted.

    "Discard any frequency that is lower than 0.0005, since the mutation frequency of HCV is about 10-5 to 10-4 nucleotide substitutions per nucleotide per round of genome replication.Calculate the relative fitness score of each mutant virus. The relative fitness score of a given variant (Wv) was determined as the antilogarithm of the slope of the regression using the following formula implemented in Python: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150519/20150519195009_7182.jpgWhere ln imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150519/20150519195230_9296.jpg is the logarithm of the relative frequency of a given variant (v) in the input RNA library, pool 0, which was used to reconstitute the mutant virus library.
