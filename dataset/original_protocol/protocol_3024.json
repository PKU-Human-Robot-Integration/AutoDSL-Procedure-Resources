Avoid moving the plate and proceed to the fixation (step 3.a.i/ii) within a minute.\nFlow cytometry.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of ice-cold extraction buffer by pipetting up and down 5–10 times.",
    "Incubate cells on ice for 5–10 min (depending on cell line, see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nAdd 1 mL of PBS-BSA 1 mg/mL to stop the extraction.\nCentrifuge 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C and carefully remove the supernatant.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2772-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative bright field (100×) images of either non pre-extracted (top) or pre-extracted (bottom) HEK293T cells in PBS 0,2% Triton-X100 for 3min on ice\nFixation of the extracted nuclei using the appropriate fixative (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nImmunofluorescence (proceed with i. or ii here below).\nFor FA fixation: gently pipet 1 mL of PBS-2% FA to the edge of wells and incubate (30 min, at 20°C–23°C).\nFor methanol fixation: gently pipet 1 mL of −20°C pre-chilled PBS 90% methanol to the edge of the wells, close the plate and incubate immediately at −20°C for 10 min. Avoid shaking the plate while moving it.\nRemove the fixation buffer and gently rinse coverslips with 1 mL of 1× Perm/Wash (P/W) buffer.\nCritical: For immunofluorescence, avoid shaking the plates before cells get fixed by FA or methanol. Determine the optimal duration of the pre-extraction step by monitoring cells under a microscope (100×) every minute. A too long incubation will result in cell dissociation from coverslips. Optimal extraction point is reached when only the nuclei remain visible under the microscope (100×). Optimal duration for HCT116 and HEK293 cells is 3–5min on ice. Representative images of unextracted vs extracted cells are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nFlow cytometry (proceed with i. or ii here below).\nFor FA fixation: gently resuspend the extracted cell pellet in 100 μL of PBS-2% FA and incubate 30 min at 20°C–23°C.",
    "For methanol fixation: add 100 μL of PBS-90% methanol (pre-chilled to −20°C) dropwise on the extracted pellet in a pre-chilled −20°C block, homogenize very gently the cell solution by pipetting up and down 3 times maximum and incubate for 10 min at −20°C.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold 1× P/W buffer, centrifuge the fixed nuclei 750× g for 3 min at 4°C. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nPause point: although a direct processing through the immunodetection should be preferred, cells can be stored for a maximum of 2 days in 1× P/W buffer at 4°C.\nNote: The pre-extraction buffer can be completed with proteases and phosphates inhibitors and replace a classical “CSK buffer” to achieve a chromatin/soluble fractionation for western blot analysis in the same conditions than IF and flow cytometry. In this case, histones (chromatin) and alpha/beta-tubulin (cytoplasm) should be used as fractionation controls. Typically, we achieved even higher purity of fractions (chromatin/soluble proteins) while using this extraction buffer rather than classical, sucrose-based “CSK buffers”.\nImmunodetection of target proteins\nTiming: 4 h–16 h\nIn this step, endogenous TLS components will be immunodetected using highly specific, validated, commercial antibodies. Although it is preferable to perform the primary antibody incubation 16 h at 4°C, it is possible to shorten this step to 1h at 20°C–23°C, therefore allowing a fast – single working day – processing of samples from cell culture to the analysis steps.\nPrimary antibodies.\nImmunofluorescence.\nBlock samples with 1 mL of 1× P/W for 1 h at 20°C–23°C.\nPut the coverslips (cells side up) onto a parafilm in a humid chamber and gently pipet a drop of 50 μL of 1× P/W buffer containing the appropriate dilution of primary antibody (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nIncubate 16 hours at 4°C or 1 h at 20°C–23°C in a humid chamber.\nFlow cytometry",
    "Block samples in 100 μL of 1× P/W at 20°C–23°C.\nAdd 1 mL of 1× P/W and centrifuge at 750 × g for 5 min at 20°C–23°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 50 μL of 1× P/W buffer containing the appropriate dilution of primary antibody (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nIncubate at 16 hours 4°C, or 1 h at 20°C–23°C on a rotating wheel.\nPause point: The incubation with primary antibodies being most efficient 16 hours at 4°C, this step represents a convenient pause point. However, it is still possible to shorten this step to 1h at 20°C–23°C to process through the whole workflow in a single working day.\nSecondary antibodies.\nImmunofluorescence.\nGently aspirate the drop of primary antibody and wash (3 × 5 min) with 100 μL of 1× P/W buffer.\nPut the coverslips (cells side up) onto a parafilm in a humid chamber and gently pipet a drop of 50 μL of 1× P/W buffer containing the appropriate dilution of Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nIncubate 1 h at 20°C–23°C in a humid chamber, protected from light.\nFlow cytometry\nAdd 1 mL of 1× P/W buffer, centrifuge at 750 × g for 5 min at 20°C–23°C and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 50 μL of 1× P/W buffer containing the appropriate dilution of Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nIncubate 1 h at 20°C–23°C on a rotating wheel, protected from light.\nDNA staining and sample preparation.\nImmunofluorescence.\nGently aspirate the drop containing the antibody and wash (3 × 5 min) with 100 μL of 1× P/W buffer.\nGently pipet 100 μL of PBS containing 2 μg/mL of DAPI onto the coverslips.\nIncubate 10 min at 20°C–23°C, protected from light.",
    "Gently aspirate the drop and rinse 3 times for 1 min with 100 μL of PBS.\nRinse the coverslips once in dH2O to remove the residual PBS salts.\nMount coverslips in 4–5 μL of Prolong Gold AntiFade mounting medium.\nLet the mounting medium solidify 16 h at 20°C–23°C. Placing the slides at 37°C for 2–3 h will speed up the reaction without a noticeable impact on the subsequent imaging.\nFlow cytometry\nAdd 1 mL of 1× P/W buffer, centrifuge at 750 × g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of analysis buffer (PBS-1 mg/mL BSA containing 1 μg/mL DAPI and 100 μg/mL RNAse A).\nIncubate 16 hours at 4°C or 30 min at 37°C before analyzing the samples.\nSample analysis\nSample analysis.\nImmunofluorescence.\nObserve with a fluorescence microscope equipped with ApoTome or an equivalent option.\nSet the exposure time by scanning through your positive control slide (i.e., UV-C-treated cells). The signal spectrum should never saturate in order to have a reliable quantification of the fluorescence intensities.\nSave images and quantify using Image J or CellProfiler 4.2.1 software using the DAPI to make a nuclear mask. Pipelines for fully-automated nuclear foci counting, as well as intensities and colocalization of 2 or 3 targets are available upon request (and see Egger et al., Cell Reports methods, in press).\nFlow cytometry.\nRun the sample through a cytometer equipped with laser lines matching your antibodies and DNA counterstaining settings. In our experience, the best cytometer in terms of resolution and coefficient of variation (CV) for this kind of experiments is the Gallios.\nPlot Forward Scatter (FSC) and Side Scatter (SSC) to gate in the cell population and gate out putative debris (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2772-Fig2.jpg",
