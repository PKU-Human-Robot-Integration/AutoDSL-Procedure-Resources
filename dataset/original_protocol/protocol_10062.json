    "1. Materials and Preparations\nNOTE: The defined medium is purchased as a powder (see Table of Materials). The composition of the defined medium in g/L is the following: Arabinogalactan (1.2), Pectin (2.0), Xylan (0.5), Glucose (0.4), Yeast extract (3.0), Special peptone (1.0), Mucin (2.0), L-cysteine-HCl (0.2).\nPrepare the defined medium\nFill a 4 L flask with 2 L of double distilled, deionized water.\nAdd 29.2 g of defined medium powder to the water and mix unit complete homogenized.\nAdd a magnetic stirrer and loosely screw on the lid.\nAutoclave at 121 °C for 30 min.\nAfter cooling, store the prepared defined medium in a refrigerator at 4 °C with constant agitation (magnetic stirrer).\nPrepare pancreatic juice\nAutoclave 2L of distilled, deionized water in a 5L vessel with a stirrer bar added, at 121 °C for 30 min.\nAfter autoclaving, allow the water to cool to room temperature.\nAdd 12.5 g NaHCO3, 6 g bile, and 0.9 g pancreatin. Place on magnetic stirrer to mix.\nNOTE: The pancreatic juice should be prepared fresh every 2-3 days and refrigerated with agitation after it made.\nPhosphate buffer\nPlace a 1 L flask containing a magnetic stirrer bar on a magnetic stirrer. Add 0.5 L of distilled, deionized water and turn on agitation.\nNext, add 6.8 g KH2PO4, 8.8 g K2HPO4, and 0.1 g sodium thioglycolate. Top off with water to a final volume of 1 L.\nAfter the components have completely dissolved, adjust the pH to 7.0 using NaOH.\nPour the buffer into a 2 L vessel with a screw cap lid and autoclave at 121 °C for 30 min. Ensure that the lid is screwed on loosely and not closed tightly.",
    "After removing from the autoclave, allow the solution to cool to the room temperature. Store the buffer at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.\nPrepare Mucin agar carriers\nAutoclave plastic mucin carriers (see Table of Materials), forceps, plastic mesh (tubular shape), and zip ties at 131 °C for 30 min.\nAutoclave 300 mL of double distilled, de-ionized water at 131 °C for 30 min. Store at room temperature until use.\nIn a biosafety cabinet with the laminar flow, fill sterile Petri dishes with the plastic mucin carriers using sterile forceps.\nNOTE: The mucin carriers are hollow plastic circles that are filled with mucin agar. Once filled, the lid can be placed on top and these can be set aside.\nTo prepare mucin agar, add 3 g of bacterial agar and 15 g of porcine mucin to the 300 mL of autoclaved water.\nIn a fume hood, boil this solution, then remove from the heat source and allow to cool for 1 min. Repeat the boiling and cooling for a total of 3 times.\nOnce the glass vessel containing the mucin agar solution is cool enough to touch, move it into the biosafety cabinet with laminar flow.\nIn the biosafety cabinet with the laminar flow, pour the liquid mucin agar over the plastic mucin carriers that were placed in the Petri dish. Ensure that all the carriers are filled completely with mucin agar.\nPlace the lid back on the Petri dish and allow it to cool under laminar flow.\nTo assemble the mucin carriers, take the autoclaved plastic netting and insert mucin carriers containing the solidified mucin agar from the Petri dish using sterile forceps.",
    "Use zip ties to close the ends of the mesh. In this way the net functions to contain the mucin carriers filled with mucin agar. Store at 4 °C until use.\n2. Set up, Inoculation, and Running of the System\nSet up of the culturing system\n\tNOTE: The Twin Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem was used for this study.\n\t\nPlace 10 bioreactors containing stirrer bars on magnetic stirrers and turn on agitation.\nNOTE: Each Unit will consist of 5 bioreactors, so 2 units will require 10 bioreactors.\nConnect 5 bioreactors to each other using silicon tubing in sequence by way of the peristaltic pump (Figure 1). Use the pumps to transverse the fluid contents from one bioreactor to the next.\nLabel the bioreactors in the following sequence: Stomach, small intestine, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon to represent the order of the gastrointestinal tract.\nNOTE: The bioreactors can all be identical, or the stomach and small intestine bioreactors can be smaller compared to the colon bioreactors since they will hold less volume. Setting up the bioreactors in this way means that the ascending colon region receives nutrients from the small intestine, the transverse colon region receives nutrients from the ascending colon region, and the descending colon region receives nutrients from the transverse region. In this way, the system is mimicking the sequential movement of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract.\nPlace the defined medium and pancreatic juice in a refrigerator at 4 °C with constant agitation using magnetic stirrers. Using silicon tubing, connect the defined medium to the stomach bioreactor via a peristaltic pump and connect the pancreatic juice to the small intestine via a peristaltic pump.",
    "Add solidifying agent to a urine drainage bag. Connect the descending colon to the urine drainage bag by way of the peristaltic pump. Dispose of the solidified as biological waste during the experiment.\nUsing silicone tubing, connect the water jacket of each vessel in order, and connect each end to the circulating water bath. Fill the circulating water bath with distilled water (this amount will vary depending on the type of circulating water bath used) and set to 37 °C.\nUsing silicon tubing, connect the acid and the base to the lid of each vessel by way of peristaltic pumps. The recommended concentrations are 0.5M HCl and 0.5M NaOH.\nInsert the pH probes to each vessel through the designated port in the lid. This port is designed to hold the pH probe and screw into the lid (Figure 1). Set the pH for each region as follows: Stomach, pH = 2; Small intestine, pH = 6.7-6.9; Ascending colon, pH = 5.6-5.9; Transverse colon, pH = 6.15-6.4; Descending colon, pH = 6.6-6.9.\nNOTE: During the initial phase, the community will differentiate based on the difference in region pH values. However, once the feeding cycles begin, the communities will further mature based on the differences in nutrient input.\nConnect a nitrogen line using silicon tubing to the lid of each vessel using the designated port. The nitrogen line should flow in the following sequence: stomach, small intestine, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon. Ensure each unit has its own flush to avoid cross contamination.\nNOTE: Nitrogen is used to removed oxygen from the system and maintains anaerobiosis during the experiment.\nInsert a metal sample tube through the lid of each bioreactor using the designated port. The metal tube extends down into the bioreactor and is used to collect fluid samples.",
    "Add a small piece of silicon tubing to the top end of the sample tube and connect a Luer Lock to allow for the use of a syringe during sampling.\nInoculation of the system\nFill the colon regions with the defined medium using the following volumes: 500 mL in the ascending colon, 800 mL in the transverse colon, and 600 mL in the descending colon.\nAdd mucin agar carriers to the colon regions, in an amount proportional to the volume of the reactor. For this experiment, 60 carriers per reactor were used.\nRemove any excess defined medium using the sample tube and a syringe since adding the carriers raises the level of fluid in the bioreactor.\nTurn on the pH probes to adjust the pH in each reactor using the computer.\nTurn on the nitrogen flush for 20 min.\nNOTE: The fecal homogenate used for inoculation is purchased as 10% feces homogenized in 10% glycerol solution (see Table of Materials).The fecal sample is randomly selected from a pool of donors with the following criteria: An American consuming a typical western diet (not vegan or vegetarian), between 21-45 years of age, antibiotic free for at least 1 year, with an average Body Mass Index (18.5-24.9). For this protocol, only a single donor is used. However, this can be altered due to experimental design.\nPrior to inoculation, thaw the fecal homogenate following the manufacturer’s guidelines.\nInoculate each colon reactor by adding the fecal homogenate in an amount equal to 5% of the reactor volume through the sample port, using a 60 mL syringe (25 mL for the ascending colon, 40 mL for the transverse colon, 30 mL for the descending colon).\nGrow the cultures in the bioreactors overnight with pH control.",
    "After the overnight growth, harvest samples of the luminal fluid from each colon region as detailed below in section 3. After sampling is completed, turn on the computer program to begin feeding.\nDaily feeding cycles\n\tNOTE: The daily feeding cycles are computer automated.\n\t\nThree times a day, pump 140 mL of the defined medium into the stomach bioreactor and allowed to incubate for 1 h.\nAfter 1 h incubation, pump the contents of the stomach into the small intestine. At the same time, pump 60 mL of pancreatic juice into the small intestine.\nIn the small intestine, turn on pH adjustment to pH 6.7-6.9, and allow mixture to incubate for 90 mins. During incubation, turn on the nitrogen flush for each system for a total of 10 min each.\nAfter the 90 min incubation, turn on the pumps from the small intestine to the ascending colon, the ascending colon to the transverse colon, the transverse colon to the descending colon, and the descending colon to the waste simultaneously.\nExperimental timeline\n\tNOTE: The in vitro system used here is operated in a continuous fashion for approximately 8 weeks in length. Below is a recommended experimental timeline, however, this can be modified depending on the requirements and objective of the experiment.\n\t\nSet up system following steps listed in step 2.1.\nHarvest samples from overnight growth following the protocol below. Begin the daily cycles, feeding three times a day following the protocol above.\nRun the experiment for a total of 2 weeks to allow the bacteria to stabilize.\nNOTE: Running the system means that the pH is maintained, the daily feeding cycles are followed three times a day, and the mucosal carriers are changed 2-3 times each week.\nAfter stabilization, run the experiment for 2 weeks as the control period.",
    "After the control period, use the system to test different components or variables, known as the treatment period.\nAfter the treatment period, stop adding the components or variables and return the conditions to normal. This is considered the wash-out period and is used to determine whether or not changes to the community are permanent.\n3. Harvesting Samples from the System\nNOTE: During the experiment, samples can be harvested from the luminal or mucosal phase of any region at any time, following the below guidelines.\nHarvesting luminal samples\nHarvest luminal fluid samples through the sample port that extends into the middle of the culture liquid. Begin by cleaning the Luer Lock on the sample port with either 70% ethanol or the small alcohol pad and allow to dry.\nEnsure that all air is removed from a 30 mL syringe and connect it to the sample port. Draw up and down 3-5 times to ensure proper mixing of the vessel components. After, draw a total of 30 mL of culture.\nAliquot the luminal samples as needed into sterile falcon tubes and store on ice. After sampling is completed transfer these to a -80 °C freezer.\nFor SCFA analysis, 15 mL of the luminal sample is spun at 4 °C, 5,000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant is syringe filtered using a PES 0.2 μM filter. Store the filtered supernatant at -80 °C.\n\t\t\nFor DNA analysis, spin 1 mL of luminal fluid at 4 °C, 5,000 x g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and store the pellet at -80 °C.\nAs a backup, store 10 mL of luminal fluid at -80 °C for most experiments.\nHarvesting mucosal samples\n\tNOTE: Change mucosal carriers every 2-3 days.\n\t\nRemove and bring out the prepared mucin carriers from the refrigerator.",
    "Turn on the nitrogen flush and open the reactor lid quickly. Remove 50% of mucin carriers and add new ones.\nSeal the lid quickly and keep the nitrogen flush on for another 20 min.\nFor DNA extraction, aliquot 0.25-0.5 g of agar into a 2 mL tube and stored at -80 °C until needed.\n4. DNA Extraction, Sequencing, and Analysis\nNOTE: DNA is extracted using the CTAB DNA extraction method with physical homogenization in a fume hood29. Following extraction, a spectrophotometer is used to quantify the amount of DNA in each sample.\nPrepare CTAB buffer\nDissolve 4.2 g K2HPO4 and 4.09 g NaCl in 200 mL of deionized, distilled water, then autoclave at 121 °C for 30 min.\nAllow the solution to cool to room temperature.\nAdd 10 g of Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and heat to 60 °C with agitation.\nAfter all the CTAB is dissolved, remove the solution from heat and cool to room temperature.\nPrepare PEG-6000 solution\nDissolve 300 g of polyethylene glycol 6,000 and 93.5 g NaCl in 1 L of deionized, distilled water.\nAfter all particles are dissolved, autoclave the solution at 121 °C for 30 min.\nAfter autoclaving, cool the solution to room temperature before use.\nPerform DNA extraction\nAdd 500 μL of CTAB buffer and 500 μL of Phenol-Chloroform-Isoamyl alcohol to the 2 mL sample tube and vortex to homogenize.\nTransfer the entire contents of the sample tube to a 0.1 mm physical homogenizing tube (see Table of Materials).\nHomogenize the tubes for 20 s at the highest setting two times, with a 20 s pause in between, using a physical homogenizer (see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge the homogenized tubes at 3,000 x g for 5 mins.",
    "Transfer 300 μL of the supernatant to a clean, 1.7 mL tube and add 500 μL of CTAB buffer to the original tube.\nHomogenize this tube again using the methods in steps 4.3.2-4.3.3 and centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, transfer another 300 μL of supernatant to the new tube which now contains 600 μL.\nAdd a total of 600 μL Chloroform-Isoamyl alcohol to the tube containing 600 μL of the supernatant.\nInvert the tubes to mix, and then centrifuge briefly. Transfer 500 μL of the upper phase to a clean 1.7 mL tube. Ensure only to take the top phase.\nNext, add 1000 μL of Peg-6000 solution, invert the tubes to mix, and then incubate at room temperature for 2 h.\nAfter incubation, centrifuge the tubes at 18,200 x g, 4 °C, for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and clean the pellet with ice cold 70% ethanol.\nCentrifuge the tubes again at 18,200 x g, 4 °C, for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and allow the pellet to dry in the biosafety cabinet under laminar flow.\nAfter the pellet is dry, add 75 μL of RNAse free, DNAse free, sterile water to each tube.\nQuantify the resuspended DNA by a spectrophotometer and then send it out for 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\n5. Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) Detection and Analysis\nThaw the frozen samples at 40°C for 30 min and extract short chain fatty acids using diethyl ether in a 2:1 (v:v) ratio.\nTransfer the organic phase to a GC/MS (see Table of Materials) equipped with a column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm, (see Table of Materials) where 10 µL is injected.",
    "Set the injection port temperature and initial column temperature to 260 °C and 125 °C respectively. Hold the initial temperature for 1 min, and then increase this to 250 °C, over 11.5 min with a column flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nNOTE: The MS temperature for the ion source is 220°C and 250°C for the interface.\nQuantify the amount of each SCFA using standard curves and 2-methylhexanoic acid as the internal standard.\nSubscription Required.
