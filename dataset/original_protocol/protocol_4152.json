    "Note: This protocol can be suitable for any kind of extract. The amount of sample for poly P quantification depends on the total amount of poly P in the sample and the right dilution should be determined experimentally. Extraction and quantificationAcid-soluble and salt-soluble poly P fractions were extracted at 4 °C with 0.5 N HClO4 and a saturated solution of NaClO4 in 1 N HClO4, respectively.The remaining biomass was treated with 0.5 N HClO4 for 30 min at 90 °C, and the level of the acid-insoluble poly P fraction was measured as the amount of released Pi (Vagabov et al., 2000). Nucleotides were removed from the acid-soluble fraction by adsorption to Norit A charcoal (Ault-Riche et al., 1998). The levels of poly P in the acid-soluble and salt-soluble poly P fractions were calculated as a difference in the P amount before and after hydrolysis of samples in the presence of 1 N HCl for 10 min at 100 °C (labile phosphorus). The DE81 filter paper treatment was used in parallel to estimate the amount of poly P (Rao et al., 1998). An aliquot of the cell lysate (20 μl) was loaded onto a DE81 disk (1.3 cm diameter) and set on a paper towel for 2 to 5 min to dry. Each disk was washed three times by shaking in 10 ml of THK buffer. Partially air-dried disks were then placed in a 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube without the cap and with a tiny hole at the bottom; the tube with disk was then placed inside a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube.",
    "Poly P was eluted with 50 μl of elution buffer by soaking the disk in the buffer for 10 min at room temperature and then centrifuging the tubes for 5 sec at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge; elution with 50 μl of buffer was repeated three times.To the combined 200 μl of eluate was added 2 μl of poly P, type P65 (20 μg), and 6 μl of a 15% Norit suspension in water. The suspension was mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge.The supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and the pellet was washed twice with 400 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The supernatants were pooled to yield a total volume of 1.0 ml, which constituted the purified poly P extract. Protein levels were determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To estimate total Poly P levels we used the method of Ault-Riché (Ault-Riche et al., 1998; Rao et al., 1998), in which the enzyme assay is performed with purified PPK from E. coli (Ec-PPK); in the presence of ADP and poly P, ATP is generated and measured using a luminescence assay as described in (Ault-Riche and Kornberg, 1999).Poly P assay0.1 ml reaction mixture 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)40 mM ammonium sulfate4 mM MgCl25 μM ADP 24,000 U of Ec-PPK (pure enzyme)Incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and then at 90 °C for 2 min. The reaction mixture was diluted 1:100 in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) - 4 mM EDTA, of which 0.1 ml was added to 0.1 ml of luciferase reaction mixture. Luminescence was measured by using a luminometer (Monolight 2010 or Topcount). A standard curve for ATP (0, 0.55, 1.1, 1.65, and 3.3 pmol) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.",
    "0) - 4 mM EDTA was used for comparison. Concentration of poly P is given in terms of Pi residues. [32P] poly P values are based on specific radioactivity and susceptibility to hydrolysis with PPX.Poly P analysis by urea-PAGEUrea-polyacrylamide gels were prepared by mixing:10.51 g of urea 3.75 ml of acrylamide solution2.5 ml of 0.9 M Tris borate (pH 8.3)27 mM EDTA, to a final volume of 25 mlAmmonium persulfate (15 μg) and TEMED (25 μl)The gel was poured (14 x 23 x 0.75 mm) and allowed to polymerize. Gels of other strengths were made with appropriate volumes of the stock acrylamide solution. The gel was pre-electrophoresed at 300 V for 1 h. Poly P was mixed with 0.25 volume of 5x sample buffer and loaded on the gel.Electrophoresis was at 300 V until the dye was 7 to 8 cm from the top of the gel. Gels were stained with:0.05% toluidine blue in 25% methanol and 5% glycerol for 20 min followed by destaining in the same solvent without toluidine blue. Gels containing radioactivity were analyzed on a Phosphorimager and autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat AR film (Kumble and Kornberg, 1995). For determination of chain lengths, marker poly P of various sizes was electrophoresed along with the samples and the markers localized by toluidine blue staining (Figure 1). Centimeters migrated  versus chain length was plotted, the mobility of the sample was measured, and its chain length was determined by extrapolating from the plot.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140426/20140426234935_8527.jpgFigure 1. Poly P products of DdPPK1. Poly P synthesis with 40 ng of DdPPK1 was carried out with [γ-32P] ATP under the optimal conditions for 30 min. Products were purified, treated with exopolyphosphatase (PPX) (as described in Materials and Reagents) and separated by 20% PAGE containing 7 M urea, and visualized by PhosphorImager.",
    "P750 is a purified product of EcPPK1, which has a chain length of ≈ 750 residues. P300, P50, and P30 indicate the position of poly P with different chain lengths. PPi, pyrophosphate.
