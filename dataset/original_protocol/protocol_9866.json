    "To ensure compliance with ethical standards, all animal procedures related to isolating cardiomyocytes from rodent hearts were first approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Additionally, all animal experiments were conducted in complete accordance with guidance from the University of Chicago IACUC.\n1. Preparation of cell-SiNWs hybrids\nIsolate primary cardiomyocytes (CMs) using a commercial kit following manufacturer’s guidelines.\nPrepare complete DMEM for primary cell isolation supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine.\nTo isolate myofibroblast (MFs) from the MFs-CMs suspension, pre-plate the isolated cells on a tissue culture dish (cells isolated from 2 hearts from step 1.1. per 100 mm dish) for 1 h. As CMs need a fibronectin or collagen treated surface to adhere, only MFs will attach to tissue culture surface.\nAspirate the enriched CMs cell suspension. These CMs can be used for hetero-cellular coupling experiments as described in section 3. Rinse the MFs with DMEM to eliminate any remaining CMs from the MFs dish.\nAdd fresh culture medium to MFs and allow them to proliferate until they are ~80% confluent (2-4 days). Change the medium every other day.\nWhen the cells are ready (80% confluent), prepare SiNWs for the hybridization step below (step 1.7).\n\tNOTE: Many types of SiNWs can be used for this. In this experiment, SiNWs that were grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with a core-shell p-i-n junction configuration were used as described previously16. During the CVD growth, the SiNWs are grown on a silicon wafer substrate, and are eventually kept as silicon chips covered with SiNWs.",
    "Cut a 3 mm x 3 mm chip from a wafer with CVD grown SiNWs using a diamond scribe. Use sharp forceps to handle the wafer and minimize the surface area that is touched with the forceps, as this may break the SiNWs.\nSterilize the chip by rinsing it with 70% ethanol and allowing the ethanol to dry for 30 min under UV light in a biosafety laminar flow hood.\nTransfer the chip into a sterile microcentrifuge tube and rinse excess ethanol using complete culture media.\nAdd 1 mL of culture media and sonicate the chip in sonication bath for 1-10 min. The media should turn cloudy as SiNWs are released into the media.\n\tNOTE: Sonication time and power should be optimized for different sonicators or different cells, as shorter durations and lower powers will yield longer SiNWs.\nAdd the SiNWs suspension into 5 mL of culture media and seed it onto the 100 mm tissue culture dish with MFs. Allow the SiNWs to internalize for 4 h and rinse the excess SiNWs off 5x with media. Allow partially internalized SiNWs to complete the internalization by allowing them to sit for another 1 h before use.\n\tNOTE: Different cell types may need different SiNWs concentration and/or internalization times.\nPrepare collagen coating solution by diluting collagen stock solution (3 mg/mL) with sterile 20 mM acetic acid at a ratio of 1:50. Add 0.5 mL coating solution to a 35 mm glass bottom dish and allow it to sit for 1 h in 37 °C. Remove the solution and rinse dish with sterile PBS.",
    "Harvest the cell-SiNWs hybrids by treating the cells with 3 mL of trypsin for 2 min at 37 °C. Add 10 mL of culture media and rinse the hybrids vigorously by pipetting. Centrifuge the cells gently at 200 x g for 5 min to avoid damaging the cells with the internalized SiNWs. Remove excess media, suspend cells with 1 mL media and seed them onto the collagen treated glass bottom dish.\n\tNOTE: The hybrids can be seeded alone, to investigate intracellular or intercellular coupling or with CMs to investigate hetero-cellular coupling in vitro.\nPerform a final verification of SiNW internalization by labeling cells’ cytosol (calcein-AM, 4 µM) and membrane (membrane marker, 2 µM) for 30 min at 37 °C, and imaging the cell using confocal microscopy. As SiNWs are highly reflective, reflected light can be used instead of fluorescence to visualize them.\n2. Preparation of cells for intra- and intercellular investigations\nPrepare collagen coating solution as in 1.12\nFor intracellular electrical stimulation, culture hybrids with low seeding densities. Use a standard hemocytometer to count cells from section 1.11. and seed 50,000 cells on a 35 mm glass bottom dish in culture media. For intercellular investigations, use higher cell densities (500,000 cells per dish). For intercellular coupling between CMs and MFs, co-culture the hybrids with freshly isolated CMs. \nAllow cells to attach overnight before performing optical stimulation experiments. For intercellular investigations, allow 48 h at 37 °C for the cells to express intercellular gap junctions before the experiment is conducted.\nPrepare calcium sensitive dye stock solution (may be kept in -20 °C) by adding 50 µL of DMSO to 50 µg Fluo-4 AM. Prepare staining solution by diluting 1 µL of dye in 1 mL of DMEM.",
    "Aspirate the culture medium from cells and add 1 mL of staining solution. Allow dye to internalize into cells for 20-30 min at 37 °C. Aspirate the dye and rinse twice with sterile PBS.\nFinally, add 1 mL of pre-warmed phenol-red free DMEM Media, and allow the intracellular Fluo-4 to undergo de-esterification for 30 min in 37 °C.\nTransfer cells to microscope for imaging and stimulation.\n3. Optical imaging and stimulation\nPre-heat a humidified microincubator to 37 °C and bubble air-CO2 mixture (95:5).\nUse a microscope with a collimated laser line coupled into the light path for calcium imaging and optical stimulation.\n\tNOTE: A scanning confocal microscope is the most straightforward option due to its point stimulation capabilities. However, this procedure can be done using any standard florescence microscope by coupling a collimated laser beam into the infinity space of the light path using a beam splitter. Any microscope objective is designed so that a collimated laser passed through it will be focused to a diffraction limited laser spot at the focal plane. The laser wavelength should be close to the excitation light, so it will be reflected by the dichroic mirror and passed by the excitation filter.\nVisualize the SiNWs and determine the stimulation site using brightfield microscopy, transmitted light, or reflective light. Then, reconfigure the light path to fluorescence mode, while maintaining the stimulation point at the predefined location of the SiNW.",
    "Validate the optimal stimulation power and pulse length for each SiNW size and cell type, to minimize photothermal damage to stimulated cells. For a typical stimulation protocol, perform a 2-10 s baseline recording of the intracellular calcium activity. Then, apply a single laser pulse of 1-10 mW power and 1-10 ms duration (corresponding to 30-300 kW/mm2) to stimulate the SiNW, and record the resulting calcium wave for another 2-10 s.\n\tNOTE: It is essential to optimize the optical power and pulse length for each SiNW size and cells. This is necessary to minimize photothermal damage to the stimulated cells.\nTransfer the recorded movies of the optical stimulation, if necessary, for further analysis.\n4. Video processing\nVisualize changes in Fluo-4 fluorescence using the “dF over F” macro17 available for ImageJ18, which calculates the change in fluorescence counts for each pixel, and normalizes by the average value of the resting baseline. Convert the output (floating point format) to 8 bits for further processing.\nProcess the dF/F movie further using the “Remove outliers” selective median filter available in ImageJ. Define parameters to remove pixels where their value is more than 10 above the median value in a 2-pixel radius and replace that pixel value with the median.\nCalculate the optical flow in each frame via the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, as implemented in the Matlab Computer Vision toolbox. The output of this function was a vector field containing the x- and y-components of the optical flow at each point in each image (code is available in Supplementary File 1).",
    "NOTE: The mean optical flow within a cell, <ν>, corresponds to the development of calcium flux within a cell. The differential of the optical flow, Δ<ν> provides the time point at which calcium signaling was activated, by identifying where the signal was maximized. Additionally, the magnitude of Δ<ν> at its maximum is correlated to the rate at which the calcium wave front progresses through the cell.\nCalculate the intercellular speed of calcium transmission according to the following equation.\nvCa2+ = rij / ( tmax,j − tmax,i ),\n\twhere tmax,j and tmax,i are the times of activation for cells j and i, respectively, and rij is the distance between the centroids of the cells.\nSubscription Required.
