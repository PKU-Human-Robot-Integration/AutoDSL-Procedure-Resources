    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of Mus musculus embryonic lung explants\nTiming: 1 h\nTo investigate 3D cellular dynamics during mouse embryonic lung development, we used mouse lung rudiments from animals homozygous for the Rosa26mTmG and heterozygous for the ShhGFP-Cre allele (ShhGFPCre/+; Rosa26mTmG). The double-fluorescent SHH-controlled Cre reporter mouse expresses membrane-targeted tandem dimer Tomato (mT) before Cre-mediated excision and membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein (mG) after excision.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] As a result, only epithelial cell membranes in embryonic lungs are labeled by GFP, while all adjacent mesenchymal tissue is labeled by tdTomato.\nEuthanize mice humanely prior to embryo collection.\nNote: Always dissect in buffer (e.g., DPBS) between 20°C and 25°C to prevent drying, preserve tissue morphology, and encourage fitness.\nNote: Freshly dissected lung rudiments should be washed clean in DPBS.\nTissue resting for live imaging applications\nTiming: 1 h\nCompletely submerge tissue and allow it to rest in culture/imaging medium in a humidified incubator set to 37°C and 5% CO2 for at least 1 h before use.\nNote: Keeping near-physiological environmental conditions for the selected explants in between experimental steps increases fitness.\nNote: It is preferable to work in small batches and rest explants as they are dissected. This should minimize temperature variations in case of delays when dissecting a large number of embryos.\nCritical: Embryonic mouse explants are highly sensitive to fluctuations in environmental conditions. Therefore, culture/imaging medium should be previously equilibrated to 37°C before use.\nTissue fixation for optical clearing applications\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Chemical fixation is not only the primary step to preserve tissue integrity throughout clearing, but it facilitates fluorescent staining and enables long-term sample storage. Fixation is a time-dependent process. Under-fixation (early withdrawal from the fixative) can lead to edge staining and poor tissue preservation, while over-fixation (late removal from the fixative) often masks epitopes, promotes signal loss, and increases nonspecific background noise (autofluorescence).\nTo fix fresh embryonic mouse explants, completely submerge fresh tissue in 4% PFA (∼ pH 7) in 1× PBS for 12–24 h at 4°C. Use shaking or agitation and use 20× the volume of the tissue in PFA if possible.\nRinse tissues with PBS 3 times for at least 15 min each at 20°C–25°C on a rocking platform shaker. Covering tightly with parafilm should reduce the risk of microbial colonization over time.\nPause point: Fixed tissues can be stored at 4°C in PBS or PBSA for several months.\nNote: While the ideal fixation time inherently depends on the sample size, any time between 12–24 h should be suitable for most experiments using embryonic tissue explants measuring up to 4 mm in thickness.\nCritical: The pH of the PFA used for fixation should be between 7.2 and 7.4 (physiological range). Due to its fast degradation, this solution should be prepared fresh each time before use.\nTissue clearing and solid agarose embedding\nPassive immersion-based optical tissue clearing\nTiming: 6–8 days depending on lung explant size",
    "This study references the Clear Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational Analysis (CUBIC) technique to optically clear murine embryonic tissues.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] This protocol employs long incubations in hydrophilic reagents to first achieve partial delipidation and depigmentation of heme-containing macromolecules before immersion into a final refractive index (RI)-matching solution that homogenizes the distribution of scattering components. Refer to this sister protocol for insights on murine pancreatic explant clearing.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nPartial delipidation and depigmentation (CUBIC-1 solution).\nCompletely immerse the tissue in 5–7 mL of ½ CUBIC-1 solution and place it on a rocking platform shaker (30–60 RPM) at a temperature around 37°C for at least 2 days, changing the solution every 12–24 h.\nNote: Delipidation and depigmentation effects should be visible.\nDiscard ½-diluted CUBIC-1 and immediately add 5–7 mL of undiluted CUBIC-1 solution. Continue gentle shaking or rotation at 37°C for a minimum of 1 day, changing the solution every 12–24 h until no longer cloudy or until desired transparency is achieved.\nOnce the tissue is unlikely to clear further (apparent transparency plateau is reached), discard CUBIC-1 and rinse with 15 mL of PBS 3 times for at least 4 h each at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Complete removal of the CUBIC-1 mix at this step is crucial to the final transparency.\nNote: Serial dilutions of CUBIC-1 should encourage the active and constant removal of lipids and pigmentation. In contrast, direct immersion in CUBIC-1 solution leads to lower clearing efficiency. Moreover, to ensure uniform clearing results, rotate explants when CUBIC-1 is refreshed, and minimize explant contact with air or vigorous movements to avoid introducing bubbles that can prevent complete immersion.\nCritical: Treated tissues will become somewhat brittle, so handle them carefully. Avoid sharp dissection instruments at this stage. Bubbles and cracks will degrade image quality.",
    "Critical: Given that whole E12.5 lung explants measure less than 2 mm in thickness, they should reliably clear within 4–5 days. On the other hand, individual tissue chunks or embryonic lung lobes may clear in as little as 2 days. The immersion period and final transparency heavily depend on the tissue composition; different explants of similar dimensions may require adjusted clearing regimens.\nOptional: At this stage, conventional immunofluorescence staining (IFS) protocols can be used. Following serial PBS washes (Step 5c), samples can be blocked with 5% BSA with shaking (30–60 RPM) at 4°C for 2–3 h. Next, samples can be incubated with primary antibodies (diluted in 5% BSA) on a rocking platform shaker (30–60 RPM) at 4°C for 24 h. Samples should then be rinsed with 15 mL of PBS 3 times for 1 h each at 20°C–25°C. Matching secondary antibodies (diluted in 5% BSA) can be applied to the sample under the same conditions as the primary IFS incubations. Lastly, treated tissues should be rinsed with 15 mL of PBS 3 times for at least 1 h each at 20°C–25°C. We note that in the case of large explants, counterstains may already be added to ½-diluted CUBIC-1 solution (Step 5a) to promote even marker distribution. A light PFA post-fixation may also be necessary to minimize the diffusion of fluorescent stains out of cells and maintain fluorescence profiles over long storage periods.\nPause point: Although it is strongly suggested to continue, tissues may be kept in PBS at 4°C for up to 3 weeks if necessary.\nHyperhydration and RI-homogenization (CUBIC-2 solution).\nCompletely immerse the tissue in 5–7 mL of ½-diluted CUBIC-2 solution and place it on a rocking platform shaker (30–60 RPM) at 20°C–25°C for at least 2 days, changing the solution every 12–24 h.",
    "Note: A high degree of tissue transparency should be noticeable at this stage.\nDiscard ½-diluted CUBIC-2 and immediately add 5–7 mL of undiluted CUBIC-2 solution. Continue gentle shaking or rotation at 20°C–25°C for a minimum of 1 day, changing the solution every 12–24 h until desired transparency is achieved.\nNote: Explants should be submerged entirely and should not float. Floating due to dissolved gasses will prevent appropriate RI homogenization throughout the tissue. To ensure uniform clearing results, rotate explants when CUBIC-2 is refreshed, minimize explant contact with air or vigorous movements, and always degas solution before use.\nCritical: Treated tissues will become somewhat soft, so handle them with care and avoid sharp dissection instruments. The immersion period and final transparency heavily depend on the tissue composition; different explants of similar dimensions may require adjusted clearing regimens.\nPause point: If necessary, tissues may be kept in CUBIC-2 solution at 20°C–25°C for up to 1 year. Cover to reduce ambient evaporation and risk of crystallization. While serial dilutions should somewhat mitigate swelling for short immersion periods, prolonged CUBIC-2 clearing will not only cause explants to appear more transparent but may also cause isotropic tissue expansion.\nSolid agarose embedding\nTiming: 1–2 h\nDue to the geometry of traditional Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) or light-sheet microscopy implementations, samples must be mounted vertically for imaging. Typically, specimens are embedded within thin columns of low-melting point (LMP) agarose (0.5%–1.0%) and attached to a mounting pin to facilitate sample immobilization and provide complete freedom of rotation during imaging. Canonical applications using solid embedding entail the observation of living intact samples that do not significantly expand within short developmental windows.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\n15 min before embedding, melt a 4 mL aliquot of 2% low-melting point agarose mix (in ddH2O) in a heating block set to 70°C.",
    "Critical: Minimize boiling time to reduce evaporation.\nKeep the aliquot in a second heating block or heated shaker between 38°C–40°C to ensure that the agarose is close to gelling before sample embedding.\nTransfer a single E12.5 lung explant into the 38°C–40°C molten agarose mix.\nNote: Ensure to carry a minimum volume of liquid along with the cleared sample.\nPause point: Agarose solution aliquots can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 months.\nCritical: As cleared explants will have some clearing solution around them, carefully swirl the sample within agarose. No surrounding film should remain, and the agarose mix should be completely homogeneous.\nSelect a glass capillary tube of 20 μL (for the accessories that come with the Zeiss Z.1, this corresponds to the size with the black mark) and a matching plunger rod (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Push the plunger through so the rod tip reaches the bottom of the capillary.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2552-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of solid agarose cylinders for light-sheet microscopy imaging of cleared mouse lung explants\n(A) Glass capillary tube of 20 μL (black mark) and matching plunger rod.\n(B) Melted agarose and a cleared sample are aspirated inside the capillary.\n(C) Perforated microcentrifuge tubes help stabilize capillaries during agarose clearing.\n(D) Round-bottom glass centrifuge tube showing exposed agarose submerged in CUBIC-2 solution.\nInsert the capillary tube into the agarose mix and slowly draw a single explant inside (seeding more is not recommended) by pulling up the plunger, creating suction. Orient the sample lengthwise as it enters the capillary.\nNote: To lower the chances of sample damage and facilitate the embedding of small and transparent cleared samples into agarose columns, a fluorescence stereomicroscope may be used.",
    "Critical: Avoid any air bubbles between the plunger tip and the sample as well as around the sample. There should be ± 3 cm of free agarose above the explant and ±1 cm below it.\nCover and horizontally rest seeded capillaries at 20°C–25°C until the agarose solidifies (approx. 15–20 min). Rotate halfway to ensure the explant is centered within the solidified agarose (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCritical: As RI variations between the sample and the objective can blur the final results, agarose cylinders containing CUBIC-cleared samples should be cleared to match the RI of the sample and immersion medium (CUBIC-2 clearing solution RI = 1.49).\nUsing tweezers, punch a hole through the closed lid and bottom of a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Wriggle the seeded capillary through the perforated microcentrifuge tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) and insert it into a round-bottom glass centrifuge tube filled halfway with undiluted CUBIC-2 clearing solution.\nNote: The edges of the microcentrifuge tube should fit tightly against the rim, keeping the capillary centered and the bottom barely submerged. If the fit is too loose, wrap parafilm tape around the microcentrifuge tube to ensure a tighter fit.\nCarefully push the plunger rod down to expose the bottom of the agarose column. The agarose-embedded sample should be hanging free and fully submerged in CUBIC-2 clearing solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPlace the centrifuge tube in a rack, cover, and allow the agarose to clear for a minimum of 1 day until the exposed agarose is no longer opaque.\nNote: Similar protocols for solid agarose mounting are available.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Notably, FEP (Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene) tube mounting is not recommended here as FEP tubing is index-matched to water and will lead to RI inhomogeneities and lower image quality in CUBIC applications.",
    "Note: To reuse glass capillaries and plunger rods, wash with ddH2O, 70% ethanol, and rinse with PBS.\nCritical: Resting freshly seeded capillaries vertically while the agarose within solidifies may cause explants to sink, disrupting the integrity of the agarose column. Ensure the capillary remains on its side and rotate at the halfway mark.\nPause point: Agarose columns may be submerged in CUBIC-2 for up to 2 weeks, after which point the column may become brittle and degrade. To store long term, retract agarose into capillary, keep covered, and submerge into CUBIC-2 solution at 20°C–25°C for up to 1 year.\nImaging using light-sheet microscopy\nTiming: 1–24 h\nHigh-resolution 3D volumetric renderings of cleared lung explants for the characterization of epithelial cellular morphology and structure were acquired using a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope. Our instrument was fitted with a long working distance detection objective (20×/1.0 NA, n = 1.45), 2 illumination objectives (10×/0.2 NA), and 2 PCO Edge sCMOS cameras. To image GFP-expressing cellular components, we used a 488 nm wavelength laser (power set to 3.0), a GFP/560/RPF mirror, and a 505–545 nm camera filter. To image RFP-expressing cellular components, we used a 561 nm wavelength laser (power set to 2.0), a GFP/560/RPF mirror, and a LP585 filter. Exposure times for both light paths were set to 150 ms, the zoom factor was set to 0.67, the z-stack step size was 1.13 μm, and the number of the frames per stack was 349.\nThese experiments also required a dedicated sample chamber (n = 1.45) to compensate for the focal shift and increase in light-sheet thickness brought about by using a high RI solution like CUBIC-2 as an immersion medium.",
    "Critical: Fill the imaging chamber slowly with CUBIC-2 clearing solution to avoid introducing bubbles, and rest undisturbed at 20°C–25°C for at least 1 h before imaging. Bubbles in the immersion medium will interfere with imaging, so avoid vigorous movements when fastening the capillary tube to the stage holder.\nLive imaging and hollow agarose embedding\nPreparation of hollow agarose cylinders\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIn this step, we extend an experimental protocol for mounting post-implantation mouse embryos14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] to accommodate the unconstrained and robust stereotypical development of embryonic mouse lung explants within a light-sheet microscope. Our protocol leverages hollow columns of low-melting point (LMP) agarose and 3D scaffold materials like Matrigel to provide structural support during imaging, minimize rotational drift, and recapitulate the in-vivo microenvironment context of epithelial ductal explants. Moreover, columns fashioned from low agarose concentrations (0.5%–1.0%) are optically transparent, gas permeable, and chemically inert. Thus, by embedding living explants in extracellular matrix (ECM) extract and mounting them within a hollow agarose cylinder, they exhibit no deformations and can develop near-physiological 3D architectures during extended time-lapse imaging experiments.\nCritical: Sterile conditions are to be used for the preparation of hollow agarose cylinders. Perform all steps under a laminar flow hood.\nPlate standard culture/imaging medium in a rectangular 4-well dish and keep in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nFabrication of hollow agarose cylinders.\nPlace a 4 mL aliquot of 2% low-melting point agarose mix (in ddH2O) in a heating block set to 70°C, minimizing boiling time to reduce evaporation. Once melted, keep in a second heating block or heated shaker between 38°C–40°C to ensure that the agarose is close to gelling.",
    "Insert a 20 μL glass capillary tube (black mark) through a P200 non-filtered pipette tip by cutting the end of the tip with a scalpel, and push the matching plunger rod through the capillary until the rod tip reaches the bottom (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2552-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of hollow agarose cylinders for light-sheet microscopy imaging of growing mouse lung explants\n(A) Glass capillary tube of 20 μL (black mark) and matching plunger rod.\n(B) FEP tube segment attached to cut end of P200 pipette tip encasing a capillary tube.\n(C) Hollow cylinders are cast by pouring molten agarose into the open tube end of the attached FEP.\n(D) Hollow agarose cylinder equilibrating in culture/imaging medium within a prepared 4-well dish.\n(E) Rested explant with Matrigel droplet in a 4-well dish.\n(F) Transfer of sample and Matrigel mixture into an equilibrated hollow agarose cylinder.\n(G) Glass vial showing a seeded hollow agarose cylinder ready to be mounted for imaging.\nNote: Keep in mind that the length of the capillary protruding from the tip determines the length of the hollow agarose cylinder. We recommend a length of ∼1 cm. Perforated pipette tips help stabilize capillaries during agarose setting.\nNote: The inner diameter of hollow cylinders is defined by the outer diameter of the glass capillary, while the outer diameter of hollow cylinders is defined by the inner diameter of the FEP (Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene) tube segment used.\nNote: Commercial FEP tubing is coiled, and segments often show a pronounced bend. Thus, straightening FEP tube segments prior to making hollow agarose cylinders is imperative.\nUncoil FEP tube segments by plunging into ddH2O and boiling in a microwave for at least 30 s.\nNote: We recommend the following protocol for FEP tube cleaning.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]",
    "Cut an FEP tube segment measuring ∼2.5 cm and attach it to the cut end of the P200 pipette tip encasing the capillary tube. The capillary tube should be centered, span no more than 60% of the total length (2–3 mm of free distance), and not touch the sides of the FEP tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nHold the FEP tube, pipette tip, and capillary tube upside-down and slowly pour ∼300 μL of molten agarose into the open tube end (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nRest horizontally at 4°C until the agarose solidifies (approx. 15–20 min).\nCritical: Special care should be paid to avoid air pockets and prevent agarose from entering the glass capillary. Moreover, unless the capillary is completely centered, an uneven agarose distribution is likely to compromise the structural integrity of the hollow agarose cylinder.\nSlowly rotate the capillary within the FEP to detach from the agarose. Carefully remove the pipette tip and set it aside.\nFlip over and gently push the capillary while holding onto the FEP tube to dislodge the agarose cylinder. Using tweezers, deliberately slide away the agarose cylinder into the culture/imaging medium within the prepared 4-well dish (Step 16) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nEquilibrate immersed hollow cylinders in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: At this point, the length of the fabricated cylinders can be adjusted by using a scalpel. We recommend keeping the final cylinder length within 2–3 cm.\nCritical: Hollow agarose is fragile, so care must be taken to avoid structural damage. Removing, pushing or pulling with the plunger rod instead of the capillary tube will tear the cylinders from within.\nPause point: Hollow agarose cylinders can be stored at 4°C in PBS for up to a week.\nSample embedding within hollow agarose cylinders\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "Fill a glass vial with culture/imaging medium halfway and keep it in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nSeeding of hollow agarose cylinders.\nPour a 100 μL droplet of undiluted Matrigel into a petri dish and transfer a rested lung explant using a glass capillary (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nNote: Ensure to carry over as little culture/imaging medium as possible.\nPour 200 μL of undiluted Matrigel into the same petri dish, carefully swirl to fully embed the sample, insert a glass capillary (20 μL volume), and slowly draw in the explant and Matrigel.\nNote: The sample should be orientated lengthwise as it enters the capillary, and care must be taken to avoid any bubbles around the sample itself.\nTransfer the sample and Matrigel mixture into an equilibrated hollow agarose cylinder (in warm culture/imaging medium) by slowly pushing down the plunger while using forceps to keep the cylinder upright (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nNote: Ensure that the sample is orientated lengthwise and has free space on all sides within the agarose cylinder.\nLay the cylinder horizontally in the plate with warm media and lightly rotate until the Matrigel polymerizes.\nNote: The explant should be surrounded by Matrigel and not contact the inner radius of the hollow agarose cylinder, or this will prevent the development of physiological 3D organ morphologies ex-vivo. The amount of necessary free space around the explant will depend on the initial size and the degree of expansion of the tissue over the imaging window.\nCritical: Hollow agarose tubes are fragile, so care must be taken to avoid structural damage due to high pressure when seeding the sample and Matrigel.\nPreparation of cylinders for imaging.",
    "Hold the seeded agarose cylinder at a 30-degree angle using forceps and gently reinsert the glass capillary, plunger rod, and pipette tip from Step 17b into the opening.\nNote: The fit should be snug, and there should be a small amount of friction, as this will provide a way to handle the cylinders safely and mount them for imaging.\nInsert the capillary holding the agarose cylinder into a glass vial with warm medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nNote: The pipette tip should sit on the lid, ensuring that the capillary does not touch the bottom of the vial and is adequately submerged in the medium within. No agarose should be exposed to air.\nTransfer the glass vial into a humidified incubator and equilibrate for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 before imaging.\nTime-lapse imaging using light-sheet microscopy\nTiming: 1–24 h\nHigh-resolution 3D volumetric renderings of growing lung murine explants were acquired using a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope. Our instrument was fitted with a water immersion objective (20×/1.0 NA, n = 1.33), 2 illumination objectives (10×/0.2 NA), and 2 PCO Edge sCMOS cameras. To image GFP-expressing cellular components, we used a 488 nm wavelength laser (power set to 3.0), a GFP/560/RPF mirror, and a 505–545 nm camera filter. To image RFP-expressing cellular components, we used a 561 nm wavelength laser (power set to 2.0), a GFP/560/RPF mirror, and a LP585 filter. Exposure times for both light paths were set to 150 ms, the zoom factor was set to 0.67, the z-stack step size was 1.13 μm, and the number of the frames per stack was 349.",
    "To diminish the risk of microbial contamination, the imaging chamber should be ultrasonicated at 80°C for at least 20 min and rinsed with 70% ethanol and sterile PBS. Having filled the chamber with culture/imaging (immersion) medium, the system should be allowed to equilibrate undisturbed at 37°C with 5% CO2 for at least 2 h before mounting a hollow agarose cylinder. In addition, as the immersion medium evaporates over long imaging periods, solutes and cellular waste will concentrate, compromising sample viability. To maintain a fresh culture media environment and promote near-physiological 3D explant development ex-vivo, two peristaltic pumps can be used to supply 0.4 mL and extract 0.2 mL of culture medium per hour.\nCritical: Bubbles in the immersion medium will cling to the dipped hollow agarose cylinder and interfere with imaging. Fill the imaging chamber slowly to avoid frothing."
