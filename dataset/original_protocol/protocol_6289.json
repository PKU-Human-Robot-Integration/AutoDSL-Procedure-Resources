    "In vitro cell culture method for biological evaluation of antileishmanial activity of total phenolic fraction (TPF) against Leishmania spp. promastigotes by using the resazurin reduction assayPrepare a known concentration of the plant extract using the appropriate solvent. TPF is dissolved in 62.5% pure ethanol, 31.25% sterile distilled water and 6.25% DMSO.Note: The recovery of TPF from extra virgin olive oil was carried out using the Centrifugal Partition Extraction (CPE) technique, which is an innovative solid support free separation technique derived from Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC). Briefly, liquid-liquid chromatography was performed using a laboratory scale centrifugal partition extractor FCPE300®, which was equipped with a rotor composed of 7 stacked partition disks engraved with a total of 231 partition cells, while the total volume of the column was 300 ml (Koutsoni et al., 2018). Cultivate L. infantum and L. major promastigotes in 25 cm2 cell culture flasks containing 10 ml of complete RPMI-1640 medium (Recipe 2) at 26 °C.Note: Long-term in vitro cultivation of Leishmania spp. leads to a progressive loss of virulence (Segovia et al., 1992). Subsequently, the maintenance of Leishmania spp. virulence is achieved by continuous passage in BALB/c mice. Tissue amastigotes are obtained after homogenization either of spleen tissue in case of L. infantum or popliteal lymph node in case of L. major. Transformation of intracellular amastigotes to infective promastigotes is achieved during culture in complete RPMI-1640 medium at 26 °C. Parasite cultures are subcultured into fresh medium (usually at day 4 depending on Leishmania strain, after every passage) until they reach the 10th subculture (Nasiri et al., 2013). The appropriate inoculum dose of Leishmania spp. promastigotes is usually 2 x 106 parasites per ml. Allow parasites to enter stationary-growth phase at 26 °C. Then promastigotes are removed by gently pipetting using a sterile disposable transfer pipette.",
    "Note: Leishmania spp. promastigotes usually enter the stationary-growth phase after 3 to 5 days, depending on the Leishmania strain. For example, L. major, a commonly used strain, approximately enters the stationary growth phase at Day 4 when it reaches the number of 3.5 x 107 parasites/ml (Nasiri et al., 2013).  Determine the number of Leishmania spp. promastigotes per ml by differential counting of dead and live parasites using the Trypan blue exclusion dye (Recipe 6) in a Malassez counting chamber under an optical microscope.Note: The final dilution of promastigotes in Trypan blue dye depends on the density of the in vitro parasite culture. Usually, a 1:20 final dilution of promastigotes is suitable at the 3rd or 4rth day of the in vitro culture. Additionally, promastigotes have to be fixed with 2% (v/v) formalin before counting.  Seed 1 x 106 L. infantum promastigotes and 7.4 x 105 L. major promastigotes per well in a final volume of 100 µl of complete RPMI-1640 medium in separate 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plate for each strain, under a sterile biosafety cabinet.Note: Different concentrations of stationary phase L. infantum and L. major promastigotes (e.g., 104, 2.5 x 104, 5 x 104, 7.5 x 104, 105, 2.5 x 105, 5 x 105, 7.5 x 105, 106 in a final volume of 200 µl/well) are usually screened before the experiment’s set-up in order to determine the optimal cell density (Corral et al., 2013). Add various increasing concentrations of TPF (5-400 µg/ml) in triplicates and fill in the wells with complete RPMI-1640 medium until the final volume of 200 µl per well.Note: Concentrations of plant extracts may vary depending on the natural product. Add one reference drug (i.e., one drug currently subscribed for the chemotherapy of leishmaniasis) in triplicate at the appropriate 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50).",
    "Hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) is used at the concentrations of 3.3 µg/ml and 6.4 µg/ml for L. infantum and L. major promastigotes respectively, as previously described (Koutsoni et al., 2018).Triplicates of different kinds of negative controls are also included. More specifically, Leishmania spp. promastigotes cultured only in the presence of complete RPMI-1640 medium and Leishmania spp. promastigotes cultured in equivalent volumes of TPF’s solvents are included in triplicates (Figure 1).Note: A quadruplicate of parasite-free complete RPMI-1640 medium is also included in order to serve as blank. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191027/20191027204811_2530.jpgFigure 1. Example test plate designed to estimate IC50 of TPF extract for Leishmania spp. promastigotesSeal the plates with parafilm and incubate them in a non-inverted position, in a 26 °C incubator for 60 h.Add resazurin solution (Recipe 5) at a final concentration of 20 µg/ml in each well and mix thoroughly by pipetting.Seal the plates with parafilm and further incubate them in a non-inverted position, in a 26 °C incubator until a fluorescent red color is observed in the negative control group (Figure 2).Note: Resazurin is a non-toxic, cell-permeable compound that converts from a non-fluorescent blue dye to the highly fluorescent red dye resorufin in response to changes of the reducing environment within the cytosol of the cell (Ahmed et al., 1994; Nociari et al., 1998). Noticeably, the incubation period depends on various parameters such as the parasite strain, varying from 3 to 72 h (Mikus and Steverding, 2000; Bilbao-Ramos et al., 2012; Corral et al., 2013; Kyriazis et al., 2013). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191027/20191027204837_3486.jpgFigure 2.

    "Note: The excitation and emission spectra of resorufin are fairly broad, excitation filters between 530 and 570 nm can be used (Czekanska, 2011).In vitro resazurin reduction assay to assess the concentration of TPF that results in 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) in cultured macrophages Prepare a known concentration of the plant extract using the appropriate solvent.

More specifically, the J774A.1 macrophage cell line is freezed in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen in appropriate cryovials. For thawing procedure, cryovials are immediately placed in a 37 °C water bath and upon thawing, are transferred into a centrifugation tube containing pre-warmed complete growth medium. Cell suspension is centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min. Gently, cells are resuspended in complete RPMI-1640 medium and transferred into 25 cm2 cell culture flasks with filter cap at 37 °C under 5% humidified air. Allow macrophages to reach a high density population of about 70% confluence.Note: J774A.1 macrophages cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2 humidified air, usually reach 70% confluence within 3 to 4 days.",

Incubate the plate in a non-inverted position, for 48 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 humidified air.Then, remove the non-internalized promastigotes by washing thrice with RPMI-1640 medium pre-warmed at 37 °C with the use of a multichannel pipette at 45° angle.Add various increasing concentrations of TPF (5-400 µg/ml) in triplicates and fill in the wells with complete RPMI-1640 medium until the final volume of 200 µl per well.Note: Concentrations of plant extracts may vary depending on the natural product.

Note: Schneider’s insect medium is preferred as it is a more enriched in amino acids medium compared to RPMI-1640 medium and it is considered as a more effective medium in primary isolation from Leishmania spp. lesions (Grekov et al., 2011).  Seal the plate with parafilm and further incubate in a non-inverted position, in a 26 °C incubator for 72 h in order to allow transformation of viable amastigotes into promastigotes and proliferation.Add resazurin solution at a final concentration of 60 µg/ml in each well and mix thoroughly by pipetting.Seal the plate with parafilm and further incubate in a non-inverted position, at 26 °C until a fluorescent red color is observed in the negative control group (approximately for 24 h).Read the plate by using an absorbance microplate reader with excitation at 570 nm and reference filter at 630 nm."
