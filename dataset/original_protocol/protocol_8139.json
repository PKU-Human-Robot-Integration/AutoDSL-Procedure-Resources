    "All methods described here have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of Saginaw Valley State University. The human tissue was obtained from an established brain bank at the Banner Sun Health Institute in Arizona15,16.\n1. Perfusion of the animals\nPrepare the fixative and perfusion buffers.\n\t\nPrepare 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer by adding 80 g of sodium chloride (NaCl), 2 g of potassium chloride (KCl), 21.7 g of disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4·7H2O), 2.59 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), and double distilled water to make a total of 1 L.\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n\t\t\nAdd 40 g of paraformaldehyde to 1 L of PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4).\nHeat the PFA solution to 60−65 °C and mix using a magnetic stirrer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The temperature should not exceed 65 °C.\nAdd few drops of NaOH (1 N) with a dropper to dissolve the PFA completely.\nFilter the PFA solution with medium to fine filter paper and store at 4 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The solution is good for a month.\nPerform animal anesthesia and perfusion.\n\tNOTE: Twelve-month-old B6SJL-Tg APP SwFlLon, PSEN1*M146L*L286V, 1136799Vas/J (5×FAD) age-matched control mice (n = 6 per group) were purchased from vendors and bred in the animal house of Saginaw Valley State University. Genotyping was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously7. Human AD brain tissue includes postmortem AD brain tissue and age-matched control tissue.\n\t\nAnesthetize the animal with an appropriate anesthetic agent, such as sodium pentobarbital (390 mg/kg body weight), or a ketamine/xylazine mixture (up to 80 mg/kg body weight ketamine and 10 mg/kg body weight xylazine) by intraperitoneal injection (27 G needle and 1 mL syringe). Check the level of anesthesia by pinching a toe. If the animal is unresponsive, then it is ready for perfusion surgery.",
    "Place anesthetized animal in the supine position on the perfusion surgery tray and using small iris scissors make an incision to the posterior end of the left ventricle.\nInsert a 22 G perfusion needle to the left ventricle and make a small incision at the right auricle to remove perfusion fluid from the body. Use a gravity-fed perfusion system to allow the ice-cold perfusion fluid (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4) to flow for 5−6 min (flow rate 20−25 ml/min).\n\t\tNOTE: A clear liver is the indicator of optimum perfusion.\nSwitch the buffer valve to an ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution for fixing and allow it to flow for 8−10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Tremor followed by hardened or stiff limbs are indicators of good fixation.\nRemove the brain from the skull using scissors. Using a spatula, collect the brain and place it in a vial of 4% PFA (at least 10x the volume of the brain volume) and store at 4 °C until further use.\n2. Tissue processing\nCut cryostat sections.\n\t\nTransfer the brain to graded sucrose solutions (10%, 20%, and 30%) and store at 4 °C for 24 h each, until use.\nUsing a cryostat at -22 °C, cut 40 µm-thick sections. Collect 10−20 sections per well in a 6 well plate filled with PBS and sodium azide (0.02%).\nParaffin embed the sections for mouse and human brain tissue.\n\t\nFor paraffin sections, dehydrate the perfused and 24 h post-fixed brain tissue with graded alcohols (50%, 70%, 90%) for 2 h each, followed by 100% alcohol 2x for 1 h each), and then with xylene 2x for 1 h each) at room temperature.\nPenetrate the tissue with xylene-paraffin (1:1) 2x for 1 h at 56 °C in a glass conical flask covered with aluminum foil.",
    "Immerse the tissue in melted paraffin (56 °C) for 4−6 h.\nCut 5 µm-thick sections using a rotary microtome at room temperature and place them in a tissue water bath at 45 °C.\nHistochemically label the Aβ plaques in the cryostat sections with Cur.\n\t\nRinse the sections from step 2.1.2 with PBS (pH 7.4) 3x for 5 min each.\nImmerse the sections in 70% ethanol for 2 min at room temperature.\nDissolve stock Cur (1 mM) in methanol and dilute with 70% ethanol to obtain a final working concentration of 10 µM.\nImmerse the sections with working Cur solution for 1−5 min at room temperature on a shaker at 150 rpm.\nDiscard Cur solution and wash with 70% ethanol 3x for 2 min each.\nPut the sections on poly-L-lysine coated glass slides and mount with a coverslip using organic mounting media, such as distyrene plasticizer xylene (DPX).\nView under a fluorescence microscope using 480/550 nm excitation/emission filters.\nHistochemically label the Aβ plaques in the paraffin-embedded mouse and human brain sections with Cur.\n\t\nDeparaffinize the tissue sections from step 2.2.4 with xylene 2x for 5 min each at room temperature.\nRehydrate with graded alcohol solutions (100%, 80%, 70%, 50% for 1 min each) and with distilled water 2x for 5 min each at room temperature.\nStain sections with Cur (10 µM) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, shaking at 150 rpm. Wash with 70%, 90%, and 100% alcohol for 2 min each.\nClear with xylene 2x for 5 min each and cover slip with DPX.\nVisualize under a fluorescence microscope as mentioned in step 2.3.7.\nColocalize Cur with the Aβ antibody in Aβ plaques and oligomers.\n\t\nWash cryostat sections from step 2.1.2 with PBS 3x in a 12 well plate.",
    "Block the sections with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) dissolved in PBS with 0.5% Triton-X-100 at room temperature for 1 h.\nDiscard the blocking solution. Incubate the sections with Aβ-specific antibodies (6E10 or A11, diluted 1:200) dissolved in fresh blocking solution containing 10% NGS and 0.5% Triton-X100 overnight at 4 °C in a shaker at 150 rpm.\nDiscard the antibody solution and wash the sections with PBS 3x for 10 min each.\nIncubate with the secondary antibody tag with red fluorophore (e.g., Alexa 594) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nWash with PBS 3x for 10 min each.\nWash with 70% alcohol 1x.\nIncubate the sections with Cur (10 µM) for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash with 70% alcohol 3x for 1 min each.\nDehydrate with 90% and 100% alcohol for 1 min each, clear with xylene 2x for 5 min each, and mount on slides using DPX.\nVisualize using a fluorescence microscope with appropriate excitation/emission filters for the red and green signals.\nFor intracellular Aβ colocalization, stain the sections using Aβ-antibody (6E10), restain with Cur at room temperature in the dark with shaking at 150 rpm, and counterstain with either Hoechst-33342 (1 mg/ml) and/or DAPI (1ug/ml) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark with shaking at 150 rpm. Wash with PBS 3x.\nTake images with the red, green, and blue filters with a 100x objective (total magnification 1,000x).\nLabel Aβ plaques with Thio-S, CR, and FJC.\n\tNOTE: Detailed protocols for Thio-S and CR labeling were previously reported7.\n\t\nFor FJC staining, wash the free-floating sections obtained from step 2.1.2 with PBS 3x for 5 min each.\nPlace the sections in a 12 well plate and stain with FJC (0.001%) for 10 min in the dark at room temperature.",
    "Discard FJC solution and wash with PBS 3x for 5 min each.\nIncubate with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 50 mM dissolved in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the NH4Cl solution and wash with PBS 3x for 5 min each.\nFollowing the steps in section 2.4, dehydrate with graded alcohol solutions, clear, mount, and view under a fluorescence microscope using 450/520 nm excitation/emission filters.\nSubscription Required.
