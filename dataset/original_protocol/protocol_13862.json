    "1. Preparation of lipid mixtures\nPrepare a lipid stock solution by dissolving 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (DOPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), L-α-phosphatidylinositol (Liver PI), cardiolipin, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (18:1 PEG2000 PE) into chloroform at the concentration of 25 mg/mL. Dissolve fluorescent dye-conjugated lipid (TexasRed DHPE and Cy5 DOPE) chloroform at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Store the lipid solution in amber vials with chloroform resistant liner, further sealed with polytetrafluoroethylene tape. The solution can be kept at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\nMake solutions A and B.\n\t\nMix lipid to prepare solution A (final concentration 1 mg/mL) that contains DOPC (52.8 mol%), POPE (20 mol%), Liver PI (7 mol%) and cardiolipin (20 mol%), and 0.2 mol% fluorophore.\nMake solution B (final concentration 1 mg/mL) containing DOPC (47.8 mol%), POPE (20 mol%), liver PI (7 mol%), cardiolipin (20 mol%) and DOPE-PEG2000 (5 mol%), and 0.2 mol% fluorophore.\nGenerate the lipid mixture by adding the calculated volume of storage solution into amber vials using a glass syringe. Match the final volume by adding extra chloroform into the vials.\n\t\tNOTE: For FCS (fluorescence correlation spectroscopy), decrease the ratio of dye conjugated lipid to 0.002 mol% and replace the rest by DOPC.\n2. Fabrication of lipid bilayers\nBake microscope cover glass slides at 520 °C for 30 min. After baking, cool down the cover slides to room temperature.\nWeigh approximately 10 g of sodium hydroxide and add to 500 mL of methanol while stirring. Stir for 2 h, continue to add sodium hydroxide in the solution until precipitates start to show. Make sure to wear appropriate PPE during the whole process.",
    "Clean the glass slides in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution; methanol saturated with sodium hydroxide; and 50 mM hydrochloric acid, sequentially (bath sonication under each condition for 30 min). Clean the glass slide in ultrapure water for 10 min between each condition.\n\tNOTE: Though highly recommended to use fresh solutions for glass slide preparation, each solution can be reused up to 5x or within 1 month, whichever comes first. Make sure to stir-mix the solution before each use.\nStore the cleaned cover glass sealed in HCl solution up to 2 weeks to ensure good bilayer quality. If stored in ultrapure water, use the slides within a week.\nClean the polytetrafluoroethylene trough of the Langmuir-Blodgett dipping system using chloroform and ultrapure water until no wetting is observed on the trough. Spray chloroform on the trough surface, wipe thoroughly with cellulose wipes 3x. Rinse with ultrapure water and remove the water via suctioning. Repeat 3x.\nCover the surface of the trough with clean ultrapure water.\nTake 2 pieces of surface-treated cover glass from cleaning solution or ultrapure water, and rinse the glass slide with ultrapure water for approximated 30 s.\nPlace the cover glass in a back-to-back manner. Use the substrate clamp to hold the glass slides. Immerse the glass slide underneath the water surface by manually clicking “dipper down” on the Langmuir control software.\nZero the film balance, carefully spreading Solution B drop by drop at the air-water interface (Figure 2A). Make sure lipids are only spreading at the air-water interface, with no chloroform and lipid droplets sinking to the bottom of the polytetrafluoroethylene surface.  Failure to ensure this will create a lipid “channel” and prevent monolayer formation.",
    "Stop adding lipids till film balance readout around ~15-20 mN/m, wait for ~10-15 min. Initiate the barrier controller to alter the surface area by clicking “start experiments,” till film balance readout to 37 mN/m. Keep the pressure for ~20-30 min (Figure 2B).\nRaise the cover glass at the speed of 22 mm/min while maintaining the surface tension at 37 mN/m. A lipid monolayer with polymer tethering will be transferred from the air-water interface to the surface of cover glass through the Blodgett dipping process (Figure 2C). This forms the bottom leaflet of the lipid bilayer.\nClean the air-water interface by suction, rinse the trough with ultrapure water.\nClean a one-welled glass slide (e.g., Shaefer slide) using chloroform, ethanol, and ultrapure water before use. Set the clean glass slide on the trough with ultrapure water underneath the water layer. Make sure the well is facing up toward the air-water interface and pour fresh ultrapure water until the glass slide is fully covered. Repeat step 2.8.\nHold the cover glass with lipid monolayer from step 2.4 using a silicon suction cup (make sure monolayer side is away from the suction cup), gently push the lipid monolayer to the air-water interface, hold the cover glass for ~2-3 s at the interface, then push the cover glass against the slide (Figure 2D). Take the slide out with a cover slide.\n\tNOTE: The lipid bilayer will be held at the surface of the cover-glass facing the sandwiched area between the two slides (Figure 2E).",
    "Take the cover glass with the bilayer to an epifluorescence microscope. Image the lipid bilayer. If a homogeneous distribution of lipid dye is observed, photobleach a small area of the bilayer for 30 s, turn off the light source for ~30 s-1 min., then image again to observe recovery. Lipid bilayer will show fluorescence recovery.\n\tNOTE: Membranes with defects or bad fluorescence recovery should not be used for further experiments.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61620/61620fig2v2.jpg\nFigure 2: Steps in making a polymer-tethered lipid bilayer.\nSteps of making lipid bilayers using Langmuir-Blodgett dipping (A-C) and Langmuir-Schaefer transfer (D) techniques.

Protein reconstitution into the polymer-tethered lipid bilayer\nPrepare a crystallization dish containing ultrapure water. Prepare a clean microscope image ring and place underneath the dish.\nImmerse the “sandwich” of the Schaefer slide and cover glass that containing lipid bilayer underneath the water, gently separate the Schaefer slide and cover glass, hold the cover glass slide from the bottom, away from the bilayer side, transfer the cover glass into the image ring, close the image ring.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the cover glass with lipid bilayer is always in water, and the ring is well sealed.\nReplace the ultrapure water in the image ring with Bis-Tris NaCl buffer, make sure the lipid bilayer is not exposed to any air bubbles. Add 1.1 x 10-9 M n-Octyl-β-D-Glucopyranoside to the lipid bilayer. Immediately add the mixture of 1.2 x 10-9 M of DDM and 1.3 x 10-12 mol purified l-Opa136 into the image ring. Incubate sample on a benchtop shaker at low speed for 2 h (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Detergents may vary depending on protein to be reconstituted.",
    "Distribute 30 mg SM-2 Resin beads into 3 mL of Bis-Tris buffer and shake before applying. Use a plastic pipette to add 5~10 µL of SM-2 Resin beads to image ring, incubate for 10 min, remove resin beads by rinsing. The final volume of the buffer in the image ring is 1.5 mL.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61620/61620fig3v2.jpg\nFigure 3: Procedure for reconstituting l-Opa1 into a polymer-tethered lipid bilayer.

Preparation of proteoliposomes\nPrepare 1 mg of lipid mixture A in chloroform solution. Evaporate chloroform under nitrogen flow for 20 min and keep under vacuum overnight and form a lipid film.\nPrepare 50 mM calcein containing buffer by dissolving 15.56 g of calcein to 50 mL of 1.5 mol NaOH solution, stir at room temperature until calcein is completely dissolved, added 12.5 mM Bis-Tris and ultrapure water to the final volume of 500 mL. Adjust the pH to 7.5.\nSuspend lipid film in calcein containing buffer, fully hydrate the lipid by heating the suspension at 65 ˚C for 20 min. 200 nm liposomes are formed through extrusion using a polycarbonate membrane.\nAdd 2 µg of l-Opa1 in 0.5 µM DDM to 0.2 mg liposome and incubate at 4 ˚C for 1.5 h. Remove the surfactant by dialysis using a 3.5 kDa dialysis cassette against 250 ml of 25 mM Bis-Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM calcein buffer at 4 ˚C overnight, changing the buffer twice.\nRemove extra calcein using a PD-10 desalting column.\n5. Imaging and data analysis",
    "Acquire TIRF images using a 100x oil-immersion objective (N.A 1.4). Use 543 nm laser and a 488 nm laser for the analysis of TexasRed-PE labeled liposomes and proteoliposomes encapsulated with calcein. Use a 633 nm laser for the analysis of Cy5-PE embedded in the planar lipid bilayer.\nAlign the TIRF angle using a lipid bilayer to obtain maximum emission. The quality of lipid bilayer after reconstitution is observed using a 100x oil objective at 25 °C. The diffusion coefficient of phospholipid and reconstituted bilayer are determined using FCS with a protocol describe elsewhere37.\nAdd 10 µL of 2 mg/mL proteoliposomes to the image ring and set for 10 mins before the image. GTP, GMPPCP, or GDP are added into the reaction ring with 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM of nucleotide.\nTo determine the influence of s-Opa1 in membrane fusion, titrate s-Opa1 into a proteoliposome/supported bilayer sample containing l-Opa1, and record fusion events.\nSimultaneous imaging of TexasRed-DHPE and calcein is achieved through a beam-splitting system. Both 488 nm and 543 nm lasers are simultaneously applied to the sample as flourescent excitation sources. The emission light is then divided using a 560 nm beam splitter. The split emission light then is filtered by a 510 nm filter with a bandwidth of 42 nm and a 609 nm filter with a bandwidth of 40 nm. The filtered beam is projected to two adjacent areas on camera chip.\nFluorescent emission is simultaneously recorded through a 609-emission filter with a bandwidth of 40 nm, and a 698-emission filter with a bandwidth of 70 nm. The microscope system is equipped with a CMOS camera maintained at -10 °C.",
