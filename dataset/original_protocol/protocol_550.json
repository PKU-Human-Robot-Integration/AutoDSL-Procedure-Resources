    "**Isolation of brain and dissection of the tissue from sub-ventricular zone \\(SVZ):**\n1. Prepare the working bench with all requirements: the sterile dissection instruments, dissection solution, petridishes, microscope etc.\n  2. Prepare 4 sets of dissection instruments: separate set for the skin, skull, for removal of the brain and to cut out the desired region of the tissue. This will reduce the chances of contamination.\n  3. The set of sterile micro dissection instruments for isolating the tissue region of interest should be dipped in sterile dissection solution to avoid ethanol contact with the tissue.\n  4. Wipe the entire dissection area with 70% ethanol to reduce contamination.\n  5. Prepare a spray bottle with 70% ethanol and a box of ear buds to wipe the head before and after decapitating.\n  6. Set the water bath to 37°C.\n  7. Lay down tissue papers on the working bench to avoid bloodstains.\n  8. Place the animal on the tissue paper and spray the head with 70% ethanol.\n  9. Now place the animal in proper position and decapitate.\n  10. To remove blood, wipe with an ear bud and later spray the head again with 70% ethanol.\n  11. Make a midline incision in the skin with a scissor over the entire length of the skull.\n  12. Reveal the surface of the skull by reflecting the skin.\n  13. Hold the skin tightly on both sides with fingers below the ears or alternatively, hold the head in position using a pointed forceps pierced under the eyes.\n  14. Cut the skull on both the sides with small scissors and if needed make a midline incision in the skull over the entire length. Take care to minimize any damage to the brain tissue during cutting.\n  15. Break off the skull with forceps.",
    "16. Scoop the brain out with the help of an iris spatula.\n  17. Transfer the brain into a 60mm petri dish with ice-cold tissue dissection solution.\n  18. Strip the meninges from the surface of the brain by looking under the dissection microscope. \\(**Note:** the meninges and associated blood vessels are sources of contaminating cell in culture)\n  19. Rinse thoroughly and place the brain into a second 60mm petridish with ice-cold tissue dissection solution.\n  20. Under the dissecting microscope, cut the brain into 3 coronal sections so as to obtain the mid brain region intact and then carefully isolate the SVZ region with the help of the microscissors. \\(**Note:** All regions of the brain can give rise to neurospheres in culture but the SVZ region yields higher number of neurospheres).\n  21. Transfer the dissected tissue into another petridish with cold tissue dissection solution.\n  22. Cut the tissue into smaller pieces using the microscissors.\n  **Pool the tissue sections from at least 3 brains to obtain enough cells to seed 5 T-75 flasks.**\n23. Transfer this petridish with the tissue pieces to the tissue culture hood.\n  24. With the help of a pipette, transfer the entire contents of the petridish into a 15ml falcon tube.\n  25. Centrifuge for 5mins at 1000rpm.\n  26. Remove the supernatant and add 1ml of enzyme mix.\n  27. Place the tube in water bath at 37°C for maximum 15minutes. As neonatal tissue dissociates quickly, the tissue should be triturated with pipette briefly after every 5 minutes to check the dissociation status.\n  28. Stop the reaction as soon as the tissue is fully digested by adding 10ml of 1x DPBS.\n  29. Centrifuge for 8 mins at 2500 rpm and remove the supernatant.",
    "30. Add 4ml of trypsin inhibitor. Prepare this solution by dissolving 4mg Trypsin inhibitor in 4ml serum free media and filter sterilize through 0.22μm filter. Always prepare this solution fresh.\n  31. Triturate adequately to break up the pellet and take care to minimize the introduction of air bubbles.\n  32. Place the tube in water bath for 10 mins.\n  33. Centrifuge for 8 mins at 2500 rpm and remove the supernatant.\n  34. Re-suspend the cells in 1ml Serum free medium containing EGF and FGF and triturate sufficiently to produce a single cell suspension.\n  35. Count the cells if needed and plate them accordingly in T-75 suspension culture flasks with 15ml serum free media containing epidermal growth factor \\(EFG) and fibroblast growth factor \\(FGF).\n  36. Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 3% O<sub>2</sub>\n  \n**Expansion of neural stem cells and neurosphere formation:**\n1. Observe the flasks after 24hrs in the incubator for any signs of contamination.\n  2. One day after, add 5ml of the serum free growth media to each flask making the final volume to 20ml in each flask.\n  3. Leave the flasks in the incubator for 2 days till small spheres start forming.\n  4. Neurosphere formation generally takes 5 to 6 days after seeding. \n  \n**Generation of OPCs from neurospheres:**\n1. Once the neurospheres are formed \\(sphere size around 100-200μm), the culture is ready for oligosphere induction.\n  2. Gradually change the EGF/FGF containing neurosphere growth medium with B104 conditioned medium containing oligosphere medium by replacing half \\(10ml) of the former medium with the latter medium every alternate day for 2 weeks.\n  3. During this phase, the cells tend to proliferate only for the first 2-4 days and later they enter a stationary phase.\n  4. After 2 weeks the cells are ready for experiments.",
    "5. The oligospheres can now be passaged using TrypLE<sup>TM</sup> as mentioned below.\n  \n**Passage of oligospheres:**\n1. Transfer the spheres in medium to a falcon tube. \\(**Note:** Do not take the spheres or cells that have attached to the surface at the time of passaging. Only the floating spheres should be taken.)\n  2. Centrifuge for 5mins at 1000rpm.\n  3. Remove the supernatant and add 2ml of TrypLE<sup>TM</sup> to the tube and pipette to resuspend the spheres.\n  4. Place the tube in water bath for 5-10mins at 37°C. \\(**Note:** The time of incubation should be adjusted depending upon the size of the spheres, as bigger spheres take more time to dissociate).\n  5. Use the pipette to dissociate remaining clumps and once the spheres are dissociated, add 25ml of 1xPBS to stop the reaction.\n  6. Centrifuge for 8mins at 2000rpm.\n  7. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1ml oligosphere media.\n  8. Culture the cell suspension in oligosphere medium at an appropriate cell density. Spheres should form again after 5-7 days.\n  9. Alternatively, the cells can also be plated to grow as adherent cells on poly-ornithine coated plates. However, culturing the cells as adherent cells for longer time induces differentiation in the cells.\n  \n**B104 NEUROBLASTOMA CELL LINE**\n**Culture method:**\n1. Grow the cells in T-75 tissue culture treated flasks for adherent cells.\n  2. Cells are cultured with 18ml growth media.\n  3. Complete media change should be done twice a week.\n  4. The cells must be passaged once in a week or depending upon the cell density.\n  \n**Passage method:**\n1. When the flask is more than 90% confluent, then the cells are ready to be passaged.\n  2. Remove all the media from the flasks and wash with 10ml PBS.",
    "3. Add 2ml of TrypLETM and shake the flask gently for 2mins till all the cells are detached from the surface.\n  4. Add 10ml PBS to stop trypsinization. \n  5. Transfer this volume to a 50ml falcon tube. \n  6. Wash the flask again with 10ml PBS and transfer this also to the 50ml falcon tube.\n  7. Centrifuge at 1100rpm for 8 mins. \n  8. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1ml medium.\n  9. Count the cells if needed.\n  10. Seed the appropriate volume of cell suspension into freshly prepared flasks with 18ml medium.\n  11. Keep in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 and atmospheric air.\n  \n**Preparation of B104 conditioned media \\(B104 CM):**\n1. Culture the B104 neuroblastoma cells in B104 growth medium \\(i.e. DMEM/F12 with 10% FCS and 4.5g/L glucose) until confluent.\n  2. Remove the culture media from the flask completely and wash with 10ml of 1X Puck’s BSS.\n  3. Now feed with 20ml N2 medium \\(for T-75 flask).\n  4. Keep in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 4 days.\n  5. After 4 days, collect the medium and add PMSF to a final conc. of 1μg/ml \\(i.e. 1μl of stock solution per 10ml media).\n  6. Mix quickly by swirling.\n  7. Centrifuge at 2000g for 30mins in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4°C.\n  8. Filter the supernatant with a 0.22μm filter and retain the filtered supernatant.\n  9. Aliquot appropriate volumes and store at -80°C. \\(It can be stored upto 6 months at -80̊°C)\n  10. To minimize variation between cultures, conditioned medium form each batch should be tested before use.\n  11. Freeze-thaw cycles should be minimized with not more than 2 freeze-thaw cycles."
