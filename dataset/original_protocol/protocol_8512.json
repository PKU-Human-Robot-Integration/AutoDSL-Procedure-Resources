    "All experimentation was performed according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2000, and was approved by the university ethical committee.\n1. Equipment Mounting and Recording Condition Control\nInvite the participant to sit on a comfortable chair in front of a computer screen.\nClean the skin on the forehead (gently moving the hair, if necessary), the ear lobes, and the fingers with a chlorhexidine antiseptic solution to disinfect the skin and to remove the most superficial lipid layer that has accumulated on the skin46.\nApply a six-electrode EEG band to the participant's forehead according to the 10-20 international system (AFz, FPz, AF5, AF6, AF7, AF8)47.\nPlace the reference and the ground electrode, one per ear lobe.\nAttach the pulse oximeter to the thumb to record the HR.\nTo collect the GSR, place two electrodes on the second and third fingers of the non-dominant hand. Place the electrodes on the palmar side of the second phalanx (following already published procedures)48.\nCheck the impedances of the EEG signal to keep them below 10 kΩ by using the appropriate impedance-measurement button on the interface in the acquisition software.\nIn the \"channels\" setup of the acquisition software, set the \"sampling rate\" for EEG signal acquisition to \"250 Hz.\"\nAcquire the EEG signal through an EEG amplifier system and a related EEG recording software for EEG data acquisition (see Table of Materials). Start the EEG signal recording by pressing the red recording button on the software interface.\nCheck that the GSR and HR signals are being correctly acquired by verifying the presence of the proper waveform on the software interface.\nIn the \"channels\" setup of the acquisition software, set the sampling rate for GSR and HR signal acquisition to \"128 Hz.\"",
    "Acquire autonomic signals (i.e., GSR and HR) through a multipurpose measuring capability system (see the Table of Materials).\nStart the GSR and HR signal recording by pressing the \"record\" button on the corresponding software interface.\nAsk the participant to look at a white \"cross\" over a black background, which is displayed on the screen for 1 min. Simultaneously acquire the resting condition activity, signaling its start and end with the relative marker buttons on the EEG acquisition software.\nInstruct the participant, equipped with the EEG, HR, and GSR recording instrument, to watch the PSA video, during which the signal recordings take place. Furthermore, ask the participant to limit any movement and to stay as relaxed as possible for the duration of the recording.\nPress the starting marker button on the EEG acquisition software interface at the beginning of the PSA video. Press the ending marker button at the end of the PSA video.\n2. Stimuli\nSelect the target stimuli, preferably on the basis of predefined key performance indicators (KPIs).\nWhen designing the experimental protocol, intersperse the six target antismoking stimuli (i.e., three spots and three images belonging to the three selected PSAs) in a video composed of two blocks.\nBuild the spots block as follows: a spot baseline (i.e., a documentary lasting 1 min), a train of 10 antismoking spots (use a maximum of 10 items to resemble a typical TV commercial break), and the spot baseline.\nBuild the images block as follows: an image baseline (i.e., 8 neutral images taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database49), a train of 10 antismoking images (for coherence with the spots block), and the image baseline.",
    "To avoid the bias of a positional effect in the participants' reactions, start by showing half of the participants the spots block and half of the participants the images block.\n\tTo avoid a positional bias at the level of specific items, display the stimuli in a randomized order within each block.\nSelect an appropriate 1-min video baseline (i.e., as emotionally neutral as possible, such as a documentary extract) and place it immediately before and immediately after the spots block in the video protocol.\nSelect a proper image baseline (i.e., as neutral as possible, such as 8 neutral images taken from the IAPS database)49 and place it immediately before and immediately after the images block in the video protocol.\nWhen designing the images block, set the display duration of each image to 9 s to ensure the detection of eventual variation in the autonomic components, which present a slower response in comparison to the EEG signal. Between every image set, the display a white cross on a black screen to re-establish the central fixation point.\n3. Signal Processing\nNOTE: The following computational steps could be performed with various publicly available signal processing computational software, such as EEGLAB50 or LEDALAB51, for the analysis of the GSR signal. While a specifically developed software was used here for some calculations, the steps described below do not depend upon the particular software used. Thus, the following steps will not precisely describe the interaction with the computational software but will rather demonstrate the logical steps needed to achieve the results.\nEEG signal processing.\nTo detect and remove components due to eye movements, blinks, and muscular artifacts, apply a notch filter (50 Hz), a band-pass filter (2-30 Hz), and the independent component analysis (ICA)52 procedure to the EEG traces.",
    "Filter the EEG signals with a notch filter (50 Hz), to reject the main electricity components, and then with a band-pass filter (2-30 Hz), to reject frequency components that are not related to the cognitive processes being investigated.\nConvert the EEG time series in the ICA52.\nFind and remove the independent components related to artifacts.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Independent components related to ocular artifacts are clearly distinguishable from cerebral components by their shape and magnitude. Once detected, remove such components related to ocular artifacts from the ICA procedure before recomposing the signal in the time domain.\nRecompose the EEG signal in the time domain using the retained independent components.\nFor each subject, estimate the individual alpha frequency (IAF) from the resting condition, to define the frequency bands of interest according to the method suggested in the scientific literature28.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is important, since each definition of the frequency band must be determined for each subject individually.\nCalculate the global field power (GFP)16 for each cortical area and for each subject.\n\t\t\nFilter the EEG signals in the frequency bands of interest, in particular theta (IAF-6:IAF-2) and alpha (IAF-2:IAF+2), according to the definition suggested in the scientific literature28.\nCalculate the GFP16 as the sum of the power of EEG signals from specific electrodes over the cortical area of interest (e.g., the left and right prefrontal cortex. Filter in a certain band and average by the number of the considered electrodes. See the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55872/55872eq1.jpg\nApproach Withdrawal Index\n\tNOTE: In several studies, the frontal cortex has been indicated as an area of interest for approach or withdrawal attitude in response to a wide range of stimuli53,54,55,56,57,58.",
    "Apply the formula defining the AW index as AW = GFPa_right - GFPa_left, where GFPa_right and GFPa_left represent the GFP calculated from the right (AF6 and AF8) and left (AF5 and AF7) electrodes in the alpha band59,60\nEstimate the waveform of the AW cerebral index for each second and then average over the duration of the stimuli.\nStandardize the AW index according to the baseline EEG activity acquired at the beginning and at the end of the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Positive AW values mean an approach motivation toward the stimulus expressed by the subject, while negative AW values indicate a withdrawal tendency.\nEffort index\n\tNOTE: Several studies demonstrate the investigation and application of cerebral effort to various tasks in humans28,33.\n\t\nFor the evaluation of the cerebral effort, use frontal electrodes in the theta band (AFz, FPz, AF5, AF6, AF7, AF8)28,11,33,45.\nEstimate the GFP16 from the frontal electrodes. Standardize the effort index data, as for the AW index, according to the baseline EEG activity acquired at the beginning and at the end of the experiment.\nFor result interpretation, remember that higher levels of effort index imply a higher level of task difficulty31.\nEmotional Index\nTo obtain the HR signal, employ the Pan-Tompkins algorithm61.\nAcquire the skin conductance using the constant voltage method (0.5 V)62.\nUse LEDAlab software67 to obtain the tonic component of the skin conductance (i.e., skin conductance level (SCL)).\n\t\t\nSelect \"Continuous Decomposition Analysis\" from the analysis menu.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to optimize the analysis by clicking the \"Optimize\" button.\nClick on \"Apply\" to accept the analysis and have the decomposition plotted.",
    "For the purpose of matching SCL and HR signals, refer to the circumplex model of affect plan63,64, where the coordinates of a point in space are defined respectively by the HR (horizontal axis) to describe the valence and by the SCL (vertical axis) to describe the arousal phenomena36.\nTo obtain a monodimensional variable, use the emotional state of a subject as described by the EI10, defined by the formula: EI= 1 - β/π'.\n\t\tNOTE: Here,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55872/55872eq2.jpg\n\t\tHR and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55872/55872eq3.jpg constitute the Ζ-score variables of HR and GSR, respectively. imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55872/55872eq5.jpg is in radians, calculated as arctang(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55872/55872eq4.jpg imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55872/55872eq3.jpg). Because the angle will vary between [−1, 1], the EI will vary between [−1, 1].\nFor result interpretation, remember that higher EI values imply more positive emotion experienced by the participant, and vice versa."
