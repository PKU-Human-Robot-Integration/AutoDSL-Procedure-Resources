    "Note: All experiments were performed with accordance to King's College London, UK and the UK Home Office animal care guidelines.\n1. Dissection of e14 Cerebellum\nIncubate brown fertilised hens' eggs at 38 °C to embryonic Day 14.\nUsing egg scissors decapitate chick embryo in ovo and remove head to a Petri dish containing ice cold PBS (Figure 1A).\nUsing standard forceps, make incisions behind each eye all the way through the tissue, removing the eyes and upper jaw. Make a second incision all the way through the pharynx removing the lower jaw (Figure 1B).\nUsing standard forceps, remove all skin from surface of skull by peeling it away (Figure 1C) and remove frontal and parietal bones, revealing brain.\nFrom a ventral aspect, remove pharyngeal cartilage and auxiliary mesenchyme.\nFrom a dorsal aspect, carefully remove mesenchyme dorsal to the hindbrain taking care not to damage pia, and separate entire brain (Figure 1D).\nMake incision all the way through the tissue between midbrain and hindbrain and separate hindbrain including cerebellum (Figure 1E).\nBy making incisions all the way through the tissue at both lateral junctions of cerebellum and alar plate of the hindbrain, remove entire cerebellum, taking care to maintain the integrity of the pia throughout dissection (Figure 1F). Remove the forming choroid plexus (Figure 1G).\nMove the dissected cerebellum into ice cold HBSS.\n2. Slice Culture of e14 Cerebellum\nTransfer the whole cerebellum to the sterile platform of a Tissue Chopper using a spatula or a 3 ml Pasteur pipette with the tip cut away to widen the aperture. Remove excess liquid using a pipette.",
    "Cut entire whole cerebellum in the required orientation at 300 µm thickness using the tissue chopper set with a cutting speed at 50% of the maximum. Tissue integrity is most easily preserved in sagittal section; however, orientation is also an important consideration for cell analysis (Purkinje cell dendrites are sagittally aligned, while granule cell axons run transversely, perpendicular to the plane of Purkinje cell dendrites).\nUsing a 3 ml Pasteur pipette, cover the sliced cerebellum in ice cold HBSS.\nTransfer the slices in HBSS to a 60 mm Petri dish containing ice cold fresh HBSS using a 3 ml Pasteur pipette with cut tip.\nUnder a dissecting microscope illuminated with a fiber optic light source, ensure separation of individual slices using watchmaker forceps. Identify slices to be electroporated, based upon their tissue integrity and medio-lateral position.\n\tNote: Each dissection from embryo through to slice incubation in culture medium takes around 10-20 min depending upon experience. Perform dissections one at a time to ensure that cerebella spend minimum amount of time between decapitation and ex vivo culture.\n3. Electroporation of Slices\nConstruct an electroporation chamber by fixing the anode of an electroporator to the base of a 60 mm Petri dish with insulation tape. Add approximately 1 ml of HBSS to cover the electrode.\nPlace a 0.4 µm culture insert on top of the electrode covered in HBSS. Allow the culture insert to rest on the electrode making sure there is always contact between the insert and the electrode.\n\tNote: In this setup, the culture insert with the slices will rest upon the surface of the solution, maintaining the circuit but allowing spatial targeting of the cathode.",
    "Transfer identified slices (up to five per culture insert) onto culture insert using 3 ml Pasteur pipette with the cut tip. Separate and allow to settle onto culture insert in a sagittal orientation.\nUsing a pipette, remove excess HBSS so that slices are no longer bathed in solution.\nUsing a P10 pipette tip, pipette DNA (at a concentration of 1 µg/µl) diluted with 20% fast green over the surface of targeted region of a slice. 20% fast green ensures viscous DNA solution and prevents prohibitively wide dispersal of DNA. Add approximately 5 µl DNA/fast green solution to each slice (Figure 2B).\nPlace the cathode over desired targeted tissue and electroporate with 3 x 10 V, 10 msec duration pulses. Avoid direct contact of the cathode with the tissue. Instead, take advantage of surface tension of the liquid to maintain conductance (place the cathode as close to the tissue as possible without actually touching the tissue).\nRepeat DNA delivery and electroporation to multiple regions of EGL on each individual cerebellar slice as desired.\nUpon completion of electroporation, transfer culture insert to 30 mm Petri dish.\nTo each culture, add 1 ml of pre-warmed culture medium (Basal Medium Eagle, 0.5% (w/v) D-(+)-glucose, 1% B27 supplement, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) underneath the culture insert such that the culture insert is in contact with medium, but slices are not bathed in it.\nIncubate cultures at 37 °C/6% CO2 for up to 3 days. Replace all of the culture medium every 24 hr with fresh pre-warmed medium.\nFollowing culture, fix slices on culture inserts for 1 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde (or O/N at 4 °C) in a fresh 30 mm dish with no culture media.\n4. Imaging of Cerebellar Slices",
    "Following fixation, wash slices 3 times for 5 min in PBS.\nUsing a razor blade, dissect each electroporated and cultured cerebellar slice from the culture insert by cutting around the slice and removing the slice and the region of insert it is adhered to. Do not attempt to remove slice from the culture insert surface.\nMount slices in approximately 1 ml of mounting medium containing DAPI (if desired) under a coverslip taking care not to introduce bubbles, and image using laser-scanning confocal microscopy.\n\tNote: Imaging parameters can be varied according to the constructs electroporated, and at the discretion of the individual user.\nSubscription Required.
