    "All animal procedures in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the West China School of Stomatology, Sichuan University (WCHSIRB-D-2021-597). Sprague-Dawley rats (male, body weight 300 g) were used for the present study.\n1. Presurgical preparation\nInstrument preparation\n\t\nRefer to Figure 1A for the surgical instruments used in this study: electric shaver, tissue scissors, ophthalmic scissors, ophthalmic forceps, disposable scalpel, periosteal separator, oral low-speed handpiece, oral probe, disposable irrigation vac, needle holder, 3.0 suture.\nPrepare an oral probe and mark the large curved end of the probe with a marker pen according to the diameter of the defect (Figure 1B). Use this to determine the size of the defect during the surgery.\nSterilize all surgical materials and instruments used to perform the procedure before use. Pack the desired materials in folded cloth or wrapping paper and seal them with autoclave tape for steam sterilization (125-135°C for 20-25 min).\nSurgical area preparation: Disinfect the operating table and the environment around the table by spraying with 75% alcohol. Create an approximately 60 cm x 90 cm sterile area with autoclaved drapes on the operating table.\nAnesthesia preparation\n\t\nAnesthetize the rats intraperitoneally with 10% ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg) and 2% xylazine (2 mg/kg). Examine the depth of anesthesia by toe pinch test. After anesthesia, apply sterile eye ointment to the eyes to prevent dry eyes and corneal injury.\n2. Surgical procedure\nPlace the rat in a lateral recumbency position on the sterile surgical table and remove the lower limb hairs with an electric shaver.\nUse 5% iodophor solution and 75% alcohol to disinfect the skin tissue in the surgical area.\nLocate the proximal and distal femur and make a 2.5 cm incision along the long axis of the femur to cut through the skin tissue of the rat.",
    "Separate the skin layer from the fascia with ophthalmic forceps and tissue scissors, and expose the lateral approach to the femur through the biceps femoris and lateral femoral muscles.\nLocate the intersection of the two muscle septa (a white tissue line) and carefully separate with a disposable surgical blade along the muscle border until the femoral surface is reached.\n\t\tNOTE: When using a disposable blade to separate the muscle, it is important to separate along the muscle septum and be careful of causing vascular injury within the soft tissue. Beginners and those unfamiliar with the anatomy must use ophthalmic forceps and periosteal separators in blunt dissection between the two muscle bulks.\nApply a periosteal separator to bluntly separate the femoral surface muscles and expose the middle of the femoral diaphysis.\nUse a sterile marker pen to mark the area of the defect site on the mid-surface of the femoral diaphysis, located at the top of the lateral 1/3 oblique crest of the femoral head.\nUse the oral low-speed handpiece with a 1.2 mm diameter slow-motion ball drill to drill a small hole perpendicular to the bone surface at the marked site, destroying the periosteum and the bone cortex with a depth deep enough to reach the bone marrow cavity. At this drilling depth level, expand the size of the hole parallel to this depth in all directions, trimming to achieve a box-cavity shape.\nUse a labeled oral probe parallel to the edge of the defect to determine the defect diameter and morphology during and after preparation.\nClose the muscle and skin layers with 3-0 silk sutures, respectively, and disinfect the surgical area with 5% iodophor from the inside out.\n3. Post-operative care",
    "After surgery, administer carprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously and put the rat on a constant temperature heating pad until recovery from anesthesia. When the rat regains consciousness, gently move it to a cage that contains dry, autoclaved bedding.\nContinue analgesia for 24 h and post-operative monitoring for 1 week after surgery.\n4. Sample collection and analysis\nHumanly euthanize the rat after surgery by injecting pentobarbital sodium 100-200 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Carefully separate the muscle and fascial tissue on the surface of the femur and remove the femur on the operated side completely. Collect specimens at 0 days (Figure 2A, B), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks postoperatively.\nFix the femoral specimens in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Analyze the structure of the femora by using micro-computed tomography. Set the scanning parameters as follows: X-ray tube potential, 70 kVp; filter, AL 0.5 mm; X-ray intensity, 0.2 mA; voxel size, 17 µm; and integration time, 1 × 300 ms. Reconstruct 3D model images using bitmap data.\nDecalcify the specimens in 10% EDTA for 8 weeks before dehydrating the femoral specimens in a graded series of ethanol dilutions. Then, embed the samples in paraffin wax15.\n\t\nCut the embedded samples into 5 µm paraffin sections from the sagittal plane.\nStain sections with both a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining kit and a Masson staining kit. Observe the healing of the defect area by histopathology.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
