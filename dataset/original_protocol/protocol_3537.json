    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissecting and sectioning mouse brain\nTiming: 15 min to 1 h\nThe mouse brain is isolated and mounted for sectioning on a vibratome. Sections are then transferred to an incubation chamber in which the slices equilibrate before experimental manipulation.\nEuthanize mice by cervical dislocation.\nAnesthetize mouse with brief inhalation exposure to isoflurane.\nRestrain the mouse on a firm, flat surface. While grasping the base of the tail with one hand, place a metal rod or the closed end of a pair of scissors against the back of the neck at the base of the skull.\nTo dislocate the spinal column from the skull or brain, quickly push the rod or scissors at the neck forward and downwards while pulling backward with the hand holding the tail.\nTo verify euthanasia, confirm both respiratory and cardiac arrest by observation and/or palpation.\nExtract the brain from the skull.\nCut the head from the rest of the body.\nCut the skin off the skull with scissors in a posterior to anterior direction.\nUsing fine scissors, cut the skull first in a posterior to anterior direction on the superior surface and then on the lateral surfaces without damaging the underlying tissue.\nUsing a scapula, extract the brain from the skull and into ice-cold S-aCSF.\nMount the brain onto the vibratome platform.\nTrim the brain using a razor blade to generate a flat surface with which to mount the brain to the vibratome specimen disc.\nFor coronal sections, cut off the cerebellum and then mount the brain from the new flat, posterior surface.\nFor sagittal sections, trim the lateral surface of one hemisphere just enough to generate a large enough flat surface to mount the brain.",
    "Mount the brain onto the vibratome platform by applying superglue directly to the flat surface of the brain.\nOptional: mount a block of supporting agar onto the vibratome specimen disc behind the brain to provide structural support while slicing.\nOnce the superglue has dried, place the specimen disk in the vibratome tissue partition.\nFill the vibratome tissue partition with ice-cold S-aCSF pre-equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The fluid level should be high enough to submerge the entire brain specimen.\nPosition the blade at a 15° to 20° angle from parallel.\nThis may be adjusted as needed to improve section quality.\nBegin sectioning the brain at 300 μm intervals.\nUsing a transfer pipette or thin paint brush, transfer each brain slice from the vibratome tissue partition to the holding chamber with ice-cold S-aCSF maintained with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\nContinue sectioning as needed or until region of interest is fully sectioned.\nRepeat steps 1–9 for each mouse as needed.\nUsing a transfer pipette or thin paint brush, transfer the brains slices from the holding chamber to the equilibration chamber for 1 h to allow the tissue to recover. The equilibration chamber should be filled with E-aCSF maintained with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Cervical dislocation is a rapid means of euthanizing mice that does not require special equipment and minimizes potential neurochemical changes that result from injectable chemical euthanasia agents such as barbiturates. However, many institutional Animal Care and Use Committees require that cervical euthanasia only be performed on mice and small rats. Cervical dislocation should also be used secondarily after appropriate anesthesia such as with isoflurane. Cervical dislocation in unanesthetized animals may be permitted if there is an approved scientific justification.",
    "Note: Mice are not typically perfused before sectioning in order to minimize the time between euthanasia and sectioning. However, perfusing the brain may be important depending on the experimental question and may outweigh the need for rapidly sectioning the brain. The effects of perfusing mice before sectioning should be evaluated empirically.\nNote: As noted in step 3 above, this protocol be used to measure region-specific redox signaling by sectioning only the region of interest. We did not specifically evaluate differences in ROS between coronal and sagittal sections.\nNote: Keep slices from the same mouse together as much as possible in order to keep track of biological replicates.\nCritical: It is important to keep the tissue cold while sectioning to minimize injury and/or degradation. Sections should ideally be cut and isolated within 5 min. Work as quickly as possible to prevent degradation. Please refer to Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for solutions to maintain cellular integrity.\nCritical: Difficulties sectioning may indicate issues with the vibratome settings. If the vibratome is alternating between skipped sections and inappropriately thick sections, the blade angle may be too low. If the tissue is tearing while sectioning, please refer to Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for potential solutions.\nEx vivo stimulation\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h\nSlices are loaded with dihydroethidium (DHE) to capture ROS, which convert DHE to 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E+) and ethidium (E+). Slices are then treated or stimulated depending on the experimental goals. Here, slices are treated with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and glycine, which together activate the ionotropic glutamatergic NMDA receptor. When activated, NMDA receptors stimulate NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide (O2⋅−) (Brennan et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Lafon-Cazal et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). O2⋅− functions as a second messenger in long-term potentiation and other redox signaling axes (Gao et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Heusler and Boehmer, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Klann, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Wang et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).",
    "Transfer slices with a pipette or brush to a chamber at 20°C–25°C with E-aCSF continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 supplemented with 25 μM dihydroethidium (DHE).\nCover chambers with foil or maintain in dim light to minimize photooxidation of DHE.\nLoad slices with DHE for 30 min.\nBriefly rinse slices by transferring to chamber at 20°C–25°C with fresh E-aCSF without DHE.\nRinse slices 1–2 more times as in step 15.\nTransfer slices into separate experimental chambers. This will be unique to your experimental conditions. Chambers are continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 20°C–25°C. Maintain chambers in dim light to minimize photooxidation of DHE.\nA chamber with E-aCSF supplemented with vehicle.\nA chamber with E-aCSF supplemented with 100 μM NMDA + 10 μM glycine.\nTreat slices for 30 min.\nOptional: As a negative control, treat slices with the NMDA receptor antagonist (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) (100 μM) along with 100 μM NMDA + 10 μM glycine. Alternatively, treat slices with the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) (100 μM) along with 100 μM NMDA + 10 μM glycine. DMPO serves as a negative control by scavenging O2⋅−, preventing it from reacting with DHE.",
    "Note: The timing of when to load DHE can vary depending on the scientific question or experimental goals. DHE loaded before the experimental condition will result in E+ or 2-OH-E+ being generated during the treatment. For example, DHE loaded before NMDA treatment will react with ROS during stimulation to form E+ or 2-OH-E+. If DHE is loaded before applying an oxidant rather than a stimulus, the levels of E+ and 2-OH-E+ are more likely to reflect the levels of the oxidant than the cellular response to it. In contrast, loading DHE after the experimental condition instead, the levels of E+ and 2-OH-E+ reflect ROS that remain after the treatment and may more accurately reflect the cellular response to the oxidant.\nAlternatives: It may be valuable to monitor whether the levels of E+ or 2-OH-E+ decrease, rather than increase, with certain stimuli or treatments. For example, antioxidants may prevent or decrease the quantities of E+ or 2-OH-E+ measured.\nCritical: Treatments must be performed under dim light to minimize photooxidation of DHE (Zielonka et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nCritical: The chamber should not be so crowded with slices such that they begin to overlap one another. Slices should remain free-floating and non-overlapping in order to allow for adequate oxygenation of each slice.\nExtracting 2-OH-E+ and E+\nTiming: 1–2 h\nDHE and its redox products 2-OH-E+, and E+ are isolated from brain slices by liquid-liquid organic-aqueous extraction.\nTransfer individual brain slices from experimental chambers into clean 1.6 mL microcentrifuge tubes with a brush or transfer pipette. Aspirate off any residual aCSF that follows the slices with a pipette. If evaluating multiple mice as biological replicates, pool slices from the same mouse to process them together.",
    "Add 100 μL of pre-chilled Lysis Buffer per pool of slices in the microcentrifuge tubes. Gently triturate the slices with a pipette in lysis buffer to facilitate lysis and extraction. Take care not to introduce bubbles or air.\nSet aside 5 μL of lysate from each sample in a clean 1.6 mL microcentrifuge tubes to quantify protein.\nMeasure protein by the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions outlined here: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225#/23225[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225#/23225].\nMix lysate with 1 volume equivalent of 1-butanol.\nGently invert the lysate/butanol mixture for 1 min to mix the solvents.\nCentrifuge lysate/butanol mixture at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nThe aqueous and organic layers will separate after centrifugation, leaving the organic layer above the aqueous. Carefully collect the organic layer with a pipette and transfer to a clean 1.6 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nConcentrate the organic fraction by evaporation under nitrogen gas in a fume hood.\nConnect a nitrogen tank to tubing with one end attached to the gas outlet and the other to a syringe.\nNitrogen will flow out of the syringe tip. Adjust the flow by testing the strength of the stream by inserting the syringe into a 1.6 mL microcentrifuge tube filled with 200 μL of water. The gas should be flowing in the headspace above the solution but not bubbling through it. An excessively strong stream will push water out of the tube, whereas an inappropriately weak stream will not perturb the water surface tension.\nAfter establishing an appropriate flow rate of nitrogen, flow nitrogen through the sample tubes. The flowing nitrogen will evaporate the excess solvent. Allow the nitrogen to flow until there is about 90% volume reduction.\nDilute the concentrated organic fraction with 10 μL 100% DMSO and then bring up to 200 μL in phosphate buffer.",
    "Critical: As with the treatments, extractions must be performed under dim light to minimize photooxidation of DHE (Zielonka et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). Do not lyse tissues with ultrasound or sonication, as both techniques induce in situ generation of O2⋅− that can react with DHE to form 2-OH-E+.\nDetecting neural ROS by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)\nTiming: 1–6+ h\nDHE reacts with O2⋅− to form the fluorescent product 2-OH-E+. As rigorously demonstrated through several independent studies, 2-OH-E+ is the only product formed from the reaction between O2⋅− and DHE. Other ROS such as H2O2, hydroxyl radical, peroxynitrite, and HClO do not oxidize DHE to 2-OH-E+ (Fink et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Zhao et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). Instead, these other oxidants react with DHE to form E+. However, both 2-OH-E+ and E+ exhibit similar fluorescence spectra and thus must be separated by HPLC in order to specifically quantify intracellular O2⋅− (Zhao et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). Here, 2-OH-E+ and E+ are resolved by HPLC. Extracted DHE, 2-OH-E+, and E+ are loaded onto analytical HPLC columns and measured by fluorescence.\nPrepare HPLC mobile phases if not already done so as outlined in Preparation of High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Mobile Phases.\nTurn on the HPLC instrumentation and detectors at least 1 h prior to injecting the first samples to allow the instrument to equilibrate.\nVerify that mobile phase supply lines are submerged in a flask containing 100% methanol.\nTurn on degasser.\nPrime the pumps according to the instrument manufacturer’s instructions.\nTo confirm that no air is retained in the instrument, monitor the fluid entering the waste container. If bubbles persist in the waste line, re-prime the pumps.\nInitiate slow flow with 100% methanol at 0.1 mL/min.\nReplace storage column with reverse phase C18 150 × 3.9 mm column.",
    "Pause flow and transfer HPLC mobile phase supply tubing into the flasks contained degassed solvents A and B.\nReinitiate flow and increase rate to 1 mL/min with 100% solvent A. Monitor for bubbles in the waste line. If bubbles return, re-prime the pumps.\nEquilibrate the column as per the method parameters outlined in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_459_7.csv\nPrepare DHE, 2-OH-E+, and E+ standards if not already done so as outlined in Preparation of High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Standards.\nTransfer the standards and dissolved sample pellets into HPLC autosampler vials.\nPlace autosampler vials in HPLC instrument.\nTo detect E+ and 2-OH-E+, set the fluorescence detector with excitation and emission at 510 and 595 nm, respectively.\nInject the standards and samples onto the column as per the method parameters outlined in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. In between each sample injection, re-equilibrate the column with the equilibration method outlined in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. It is critical to first evaluate whether the E+ and 2-OH-E+ standards are clearly resolved before injecting the samples onto the column. If the two analytes are not distinguishable from one another, please refer to Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for solutions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_459_8.csv\nAfter the runs have completed, power down the detector as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.\nPause flow and return the mobile phase lines to flasks containing 100% methanol. Manually change the run parameters to the new mobile phase at 1 mL/min for 20 min to wash the column.\nAt the end of the column wash, slow flow to 0.1 mL/min with 100% solvent A.\nReplace C18 column with storage column.\nReturn flow to 1 mL/min.\nWash storage column with 5 column volumes of 100% methanol.\nTurn off the flow and degasser.\nNote: The columns and buffers are all at 20°C–25°C while in use.",
    "Critical: Be sure to have enough of solvents A and B for all the runs needed. If the mobile phases run out, the instrument may inject air into the system, potentially damaging the column and the detector."
