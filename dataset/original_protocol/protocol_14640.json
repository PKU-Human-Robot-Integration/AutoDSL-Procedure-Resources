    "All animal procedures were performed according to local guidelines on animal care. All the details of this study were approved by the CECCAPP, a French ethics committee.\n1. Selection of a Side Population (SP) by the Hoechst Dye Efflux Assay\nStaining 50 million cells with Hoechst 33342 dye.\n\t\nPrepare two 15 ml sterile tubes with a conical bottom: one tube labeled \"Hoechst\" and one labeled \"Hoechst and Verapamil\". Prepare 10 ml of 5 mM Verapamil hydrochloride solution in sterile water. Prepare the culture medium (CM) for stem cells.\n\t\t\nTo prepare CM for CSC (CM-CSC), combine the following: Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM):F12 (1:3, v:v), 5% of fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.04 mg/L of hydrocortisone, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 0.1 g/L of streptomycin, and 20 µg/L of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGFR).\nUnder a laminar flow hood, trypsinize cells. Remove media, wash with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and add 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA (0.5 g/L) for a 75 cm² flask. Incubate 3 min at 37 °C. Stop the reaction by adding culture medium used for the parental cell line. Count the number of cells using a cell counter.\n\t\t\nTo prepare CM for parental cell line (CM-P), supplement DMEM with 10% FCS, 0.4 mg/L of hydrocortisone, 100 U/ml of penicillin and 0.1 g/L of streptomycin).\nDilute the cell suspension obtained in the step 1.1.2 to obtain 107 cells/ml in CM-P. Split the cell suspension in the 2 tubes prepared: put 100 µl (106 cells) in the tube \"Hoechst and Verapamil\" and 4 ml (4 x 107 cells) in the tube \"Hoechst\".",
    "In the sample \"Hoechst and Verapamil\", add 10 µl of 5 mM Verapamil hydrochloride solution (final concentration: 0.5 mM) and mix gently. Add 5 µl of 1 g/L Hoechst solution (final concentration: 0.1 g/L). In the sample \"Hoechst\", add 5 µl of 1 g/L Hoechst solution per 106 cells (200 µl total). Henceforth, keep samples protected from direct light exposure using aluminum foil.\nIncubate all tubes in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 hr 30 min. Mix gently every 15 min to prevent cells from settling down.\nCentrifuge tubes at 250 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove supernatant and resuspend each pellet with 2 mL of 1x PBS.\nCentrifuge tubes at 250 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove supernatant. Resuspend \"Hoechst and Verapamil\" pellet in 500 µl of 5 mg/L propidium iodide (PI) diluted in PBS buffer and \"Hoechst\" pellet in 4 ml of 5 mg/L PI diluted in PBS buffer.\nTransfer sample solutions through a 70 µm cell strainer to remove aggregates and collect single cells in tubes for sample uptake on the flow cytometer. Keep samples on ice and protect from direct light exposure using aluminum foil.\nIsolation of the Side Population Excluding Hoechst dye by Cell Sorting.\n\t\nPerform Hoechst negative cell separation on a flow cytometry sorter with the following parameters: UV laser (355 nm), 2 detectors on the UV laser path with blue Hoechst (450/50 BP) and red Hoechst (610/20 BP) filters, and 2 collectors.\n\t\t\nFirst, analyze sample \"Hoechst\" that serves as a positive control for staining and flow cytometer set-up.",
    "Using the cytometer software, on the \"Global Worksheet\" window, click on \"Dot Plot\" (fifth top right picture) and create a chart on the global worksheet. On ordinate, with a right click, select FSC-A (forward scatter) and on abscissa, SSC-A (side scatter) (Figure 1A). In the same way, create a SSC-W versus SCC-H dot plot. On this second dot plot, to create a P1 region, click \"Polygon gate\" (fourteenth top right picture) (Figure 1B)33.\n\t\t\tNote: The P1 region will encompass single cells and discriminate doublets.\nOptional: Exclude PI positive cells by creating a FSC-A versus PI gated on P1. On this dot plot, select the PI negative population (P2) to exclude PI positive dead cells.\nUsing the cytometer software, on the \"Global Worksheet\" window, click on \"Dot Plot\" and create a chart on the global worksheet. On ordinate, with a right click, select blue Hoechst-A and on abscissa, red Hoechst-A. With a right click on the population, select \"Show population\" and P1. On this dot plot, create a region (P2) to select the negative Hoechst dye side population (SP) cells that appears as a side arm on the left of the main population of cells (Figure 1C).\nAnalyze the sample \"Hoechst\" and collect 10,000 events. To ensure that the gate P2, which represents the SP population, is well positioned, analyze the sample \"Hoechst and Verapamil\" (10,000 events) to observe the disappearance of SP population (Figure 1D).\nCollect the SP Hoechst dye negative cells in a 15 ml tube containing 1 ml of CM-CSC prepared in 1.1.1.1.",
    "At the end of the cell sorting, centrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of CM-CSC. Count the number of sorted cells using a cell counter and transfer appropriate number of cells to a culture flask (see Table 1). Add CM-CSC and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nMaintain cells in culture under the same conditions for a maximum of 2 passages until there is a minimum of 5 x 107 cells (see step 3, \"Cell culture method\").\n2. Selection of the CD44high/ALDHhigh Sub-population in the Side Population Sorted\nStaining 50 million of SP Cells with the ALDH Detection Kit and CD44 Antibody.\n\t\nPrepare seven 15 ml sterile tubes labeled as follows: \"Unstained\" (Tube a), \"CD44-APC\" (Tube b), \"IgG1-APC\" (Tube c), \"ALDH\" (Tube d), \"ALDH and DEAB\" (Tube e), \"ALDH and CD44-APC\" (Tube f), \"ALDH, DEAB and CD44-APC\" (Tube g). Keep all tubes and reagents at 4 °C during the staining.\nPrepare buffer A with 4.5 ml of the buffer 1 (contained in the kit) and 45 µl of CD44-APC (Allophycocyanin) antibody (dilution 1:100). Prepare buffer B with 100 µl of buffer 1 and 1 µl of IgG1-APC antibody (dilution 1:100). Prepare buffer C with 4 ml of buffer 1 and 20 µl of the reagent of the kit.\nPrepare a cell suspension of the previously sorted cells (step 1.2.5) at 107 cells /ml. Add 100 µL (106 cells) of the cell suspension to tubes a, b and c, and 4 ml (4 x 107 cells) to tube f. For the moment do not put cells in tubes d, e and g.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes containing the cells at 250 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in tubes a, b and c in 100 µl of buffer 1. Add 5 µl of diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), an ALDH inhibitor to tubes e and g.\n\t\t\nResuspend cells in tube f with 4 ml reagent C and immediately transfer 100 µl into tubes d, e and g. Incubate all tubes in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min and protect from direct light exposure using aluminum foil. Mix the cell suspension gently by vortexing after 15 min to prevent cells from settling.\nFrom this moment, keep the tubes on ice and protected from direct light exposure using aluminum foil. Centrifuge all tubes at 250 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend tube f in 4 ml and tubes b and g with 100 µl of buffer A. Resuspend tube c with 100 µl of buffer B. To the other tubes, add 100 µl of buffer 1. Incubate 10 min at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge all tubes at 250 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Rinse once with 1 ml of buffer 1 (4 ml for tube f) and centrifuge again at 250 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant. Re-suspend tube f pellet in 4 ml and all other tubes in 1 ml of buffer 1.\nTransfer the sample solutions through 70 µm cell strainers to remove aggregates and collect single cells in appropriate tubes for sample uptake on flow cytometer.\nIsolation of the CD44high/ALDH high Cell Population by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting.",
    "Perform CD44high/ALDH high cell sorting on a flow cytometry sorter with the following parameters: Blue laser (488 nm) and red laser (633 nm), 1 detector on the blue laser path with a FITC filter (530/30), 1 detector on the red laser path with an APC filter (660/20) and 2 collectors.\nUsing the cytometer software, click on \"Dot Plot\" (the fifth top right picture) to create a FSC-A versus SSC-A dot plot as described in section 1.2.1.2, to check cell morphology and select a population composed of single cells with a SSC-W versus SSC-H dot plot.\nUsing the cytometer software, on the \"Global Worksheet\" window, click on \"Dot Plot\" and create a chart on the global worksheet. On ordinate, with a right click, select APC-A and on abscissa, FITC-A in order to select the double stained population. Create a gate using tubes d and e to select ALDHhigh cells (Figure 2A). Note: Positive cells disappear in tube e treated with DEAB (Figure 2B).\n\t\t\nOn the same chart, create a second gate using tubes b and c in order to select CD44high cells (Figure 2C and 2D). Positive cells disappear in the tube containing IgG1-APC. Analyze tubes f and g and create a third gate that includes CD44high/ALDHhigh cells (Figure 2E and 2F).\n\t\t\tNote: If positive cells are present in the tube containing IgG1-APC (Figure 2D), the interaction between cells and the APC-stained antibody is not specific.\nCollect CD44high/ALDHhigh cells into a 15 ml tube containing 1 ml of CM-CSC. Collect also CD44low/ALDHlow into a 15 ml tube containing 1 ml of CM19. Note: Prepare CM-CSC as described in step 1.1.1.1.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of CM-CSC. Count the number of sorted cells.",
    "3. Cell Culture Method\nAfter the double-sorting of the cells as described above, plate the sorted cells into an appropriate culture flask (Table 1) with CM-CSC at 37 °C with 5 % CO2. After 18-24 hr, check if the cells have adhered and change the culture medium. Change the culture medium every 3 days until the expanding colonies are greater than 50% confluent.\nUse the appropriate volume of trypsin 0.5 g/L - EDTA (Table 1) to trypsinize cells from the culture flask. Incubate cells 3 to 5 min at 37 °C. Add the appropriate volume of CM-CSC (Table 1) to stop the action of trypsin.\nCount the number of cells obtained and plate 4 x 105 cells in a 175 cm² culture flask with CM-CSC. Incubate at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. At this concentration, cells with a doubling time of 24 hr will be 70% confluent in 7 days.\nUse CSCs for in vitro or in vivo experiments before they have undergone 3 passages.\n4. Confirmation of Tumor Potential and CSC Characteristics\nTumor Sphere Formation to Confirm the tumor Potential of the CD44high/ALDHhigh Cells.\n\t\nTrypsinize cells as described in 3.2. Add 1 x 106 cells to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge at 250 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in a DMEM:F12 (3:1) medium FCS free, 20 ng/ml of rhEGF, 4 mg/L of heparin and 1x B27. Incubate cells in a 6 well low anchorage plates culture flask at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\t\tNote: Use DMEM:F12 (3:1) medium containing 5% of FCS, 20 ng/ml of rhEGF, 4 mg/L of heparin and 1x B27 if cell do not grow without FCS.\nObserve the tumor sphere formation with an optical microscope from 4 to 10 days after seeding (Figure 3A).",
    "Note: Tumor sphere diameter should be more than 35 µm. CD44high/ALDHhigh cells will show a faster and more enhanced tumor sphere formation in terms of number and size compared to CD44low/ALDHlow.\nEvaluation of In Vivo Tumorigenicity After Subcutaneous Injection of CD44high/ALDHhigh Cells in NOD-SCID Mice.\n\t\nAfter sorting, re-suspend cells in PBS at three different concentrations (104 cells/ml, 105 cells/ml, and 106 cells/ml). Inject subcutaneously 100 µl of 104 cells/ml (103 cells) in the right flank region of 6 mice. Do the same for 105 cells/ml (104 cells), and 106 cells/ml (105 cells).\n\t\tNote: Lower dilution than 103 cells can be tested.\nInject the same concentration of CD44low/ALDHlow cells in the left flank region. Monitor injected mice for up to 10 weeks to see tumor progression19.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
