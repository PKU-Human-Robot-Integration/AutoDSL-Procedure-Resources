    "The human experiment protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University. All participants gave written informed consent before the experiment began.\n1. The simulation experiment\nGenerate two time series of signals that correlate with each other, with one signal having autocorrelation at a 4 s time lag. Set the correlation coefficient of r between the two signals to 0.4.\nFurthermore, generate two time series of signals without any correlation but with autocorrelation in one signal.\nCalculate values of traditional 4 s time-lagged INS with Equation 2 based on the generated signals with or without correlation, which can be named time-lagged INSWTC with autocorrelation and time-lagged baseline INSWTC with autocorrelation.\n\tNOTE: Here, the traditional time-lagged WTC is expressed by the following equation (Equation 2)25\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62927/62927eq02.jpg\n\twhere, C denotes the continuous wavelet transform operator at different scales i and time points t. S denotes the smoothing operator. * denotes the complex conjugate operator. W and M indicate two individual time series of signals.\nRemove autocorrelation from the generated signals. Then, calculate the values of traditional 4 s time-lagged INSWTC with Equation 2 based on the generated signals with or without correlation, which can be named time-lagged INSWTC without autocorrelation and time-lagged baseline INSWTC without autocorrelation.\nCalculate the values of 4 s time-lagged pWTC with Equation 3 based on the generated signals with or without correlation, named time-lagged INSpWTC and time-lagged baseline INSpWTC.\n\tNOTE: The pWTC can be calculated based on the following equation (Equation 3)23\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62927/62927eq03.jpg\n\twhere, WTC (Wt, Mt+n) is the traditional time-lagged WTC. WTC (Mt, Mt+n) is the autocorrelated WTC of one individual. WTC (Wt, Mt) is the time-aligned WTC. * is the complex conjugate operator.\nRepeat the above procedures 1000 times.",
    "After subtracting the baseline INS, compare the results of time-lagged INSWTC with autocorrelation, time-lagged INSWTC without autocorrelation, and time-lagged INSpWTC using the analyses of variance (ANOVA) method.\n\t​NOTE: Here, it is expected that the time-lagged INSWTC with autocorrelation will be significantly higher than the time-lagged INSWTC without autocorrelation and the time-lagged INSpWTC, and no significant difference is expected between the time-lagged INSWTC without autocorrelation and the time-lagged INSpWTC.\n2. The empirical experiment\nParticipants and procedure\n\t\nRecruit appropriate participants.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, twenty-two pairs of close opposite-sex friends (mean age of women = 20.95, standard deviation (SD) = 1.86; mean age of men = 20.50, SD = 1.74) were recruited through advertising from undergraduates of universities in Beijing. All participants were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Furthermore, no participants had any language, neurological, or psychiatric disorders.\nAsk each pair of participants to sit face-to-face during the experiment. Ask them to communicate freely on a supportive topic in one session and on a conflict topic in the other session.\n\t\tNOTE: The topics were used to induce the intended positive or negative emotional valence. Each communication session lasted 10 min, and the order of topics was counterbalanced.\nAsk the participants to report about the supportive and the conflict topics as a standard set-up rule. Ask each partner to rate the positive or negative valence level that might have been induced on a definite point scale. Then, rank the reported topics according to the rating.",
    "NOTE: In this work, the topics were selected with the following three steps. First, for the supportive topics, each participant was required to report 1-3 personal issues related to what she/he wanted to improve in her/his life. Each participant was required to report 1-3 cases that had induced or would induce conflict between them or that might endanger their relationship for the conflict topics. Second, each partner was required to rate the level of positive or negative valence each topic might induce on a 7-point scale (1 = not at all, and 7 = very much). Third, the reported topics were ranked according to the rating. The first two topics in the list of supportive topics and conflict topics were selected.\nfNIRS data collection\n\t\nUse 26-channel fNIRS topography system (see Table of Materials) to collect fNIRS data.\n\t\tNOTE: Two customized optode probes set covered the bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (Figure 1B).\nPrecisely, ask each participant to wear a cap with two customized probe sets (see Table of Materials).\nAlign the nasion, inion, and ear mastoids with Fpz, Opz, T7, and T8, which are typical landmarks of 10-20 international system26.\nAlign channel (CH) 11 to T3 and CH25 to T4 following the international 10-20 system for the two probe sets27,28.\nValidate the anatomical locations of probe sets by scanning magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a typical participant with a high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (TR = 2530 ms; TE = 3.39 ms; flip angle = 7°; slice thickness = 1.3 mm; voxel size = 1.3 x 1 x 1.3 mm).",
    "Use Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) to normalize the image to standard Montreal imaging institute coordinate (MNI coordinate) space29. Then, use the NIRS_SPM toolbox (see Table of Materials) to project the MNI coordinates of the probes to the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template.\nCollect the optical density data of near-infrared light at three wavelengths (780, 805, and 830 nm) at a sampling rate of 55.6 Hz (equipment default parameters).\nTest the signal quality by using fNIRS topography system built-in equipment software (see Table of Materials).\nBegin signal recording.\n\t\tNOTE: Some published protocols have demonstrated how to collect fNIRS signals with various equipment and systems30,31,32.\nfNIRS data preprocessing\n\t\nExport the data files from the equipment.\n\t\tNOTE: In the current experiment, the built-in software automatically converted all-optical density data into oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentration changes based on the modified Beer-Lambert law.\nRemove the first and last 15 s of data for each session to avoid transient responses.\nUse the MATLAB decimate built-in function to downsample the data from 55.6 Hz to 11.1 Hz.\n\t\tNOTE: The power spectrum patterns between 55.6 Hz and 11.1 Hz are quite similar (Supplementary Figure 1).\nUse the built-in MATLAB application function (Homer3, see Table of Materials) with appropriate filtering function to apply the discrete wavelet transform filter method to correct motion artifacts.\nUse the MATLAB pca built-in function to remove global physiological noise. Remove the top 80% of the variance from the signals.\nRemove physiological noise based on the previous studies33. Precisely, remove frequency bands of each signal above 0.7 Hz to avoid aliasing of high-frequency physiological noise (e.g., cardiac activity).\nThen, remove frequency bands of each signal below 0.01 Hz to filter out very-low-frequency fluctuations.\nFinally, remove frequency bands of each signal within 0.15-0.3 Hz to exclude the potential impact of respiratory activity.\nFirst-level fNIRS Data Processing",
    "First, calculate INS using traditional WTC (INSWTC).\n\t\tNOTE: Here, a women-led time-lagged pattern of INSWTC was predicted to occur between the brain activity of women and that of men because previous studies have suggested different roles of women and men during a conversation34,35. The traditional WTC calculated this pattern of INSWTC by shifting the brain activity of men backward relative to that of women (see Equation 2).\nCalculate the women-led 2 s-lagged INSWTC value after removing the initial 2 s of data from women and the last 2 s of data from men with Equation 2. Similarly, after removing the initial 2 s of data from men and the last 2 s of data from women, calculate the men-led 2 s-lagged INSWTC value with Equation 4.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the wcoherence function, which is a built-in function of the wavelet toolbox of MATLAB, was used (see Table of Materials).\nRepeat this procedure with different time lags n, i.e., n = 2 s, 4 s, 6 s, 8 s across all potential CH pairs (e.g., CH2 in women and CH10 in men, 676 pairs in total). Additionally, calculate the strength of men-led time-lagged INSWTC the same way (Equation 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62927/62927eq04.jpg\nSecond, calculate INS using pWTC (INSpWTC).\n\t\tNOTE: pWTC was calculated based on Equation 3. The calculation of INSpWTC was repeated with different time lags n, i.e., n = 2 s, 4 s, 6 s, 8 s across all potential channel pairs (e.g., CH2 in women and CH10 in men, 676 pairs in total). Additionally, the strength of the men-led time-lagged INSpWTC was calculated the same way (Equation 5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62927/62927eq05.jpg\nGenerate time-lagged time series of fNIRS signals at different time lags.\nCalculate the values of the time-lagged WTC at different time lags.",
    "Generate autocorrelated time series of fNIRS signals at different time lags. To calculate the 2 s-autocorrelated value for men, remove the first 2 s of data from the men and the last 2 s data from the men.\nCalculate the autocorrelated WTC values at different time lags.\nGenerate time-aligned time series of fNIRS signals at different time lags. To calculate the 2 s time-aligned WTC, remove the first 2 s of data from the men and the women's first 2 s of data.\nCalculate the time-aligned WTC values.\nEnter time-aligned WTC, time-lagged WTC, and autocorrelated WTC values at different time lag into Equation 3 and Equation 5-the equation of pWTC, generating INSpWTC.\nFinally, calculate INS using the GC method (INSGC).\n\t\tNOTE: To further validate the pWTC method and evaluate its advantages and disadvantages, GC-based INS was calculated using the GC method (INSGC).\nBased on the pWTC result, bandpass filters the HbO signal of each individual at the SMC (i.e., 0.4-0.6 Hz, see Representative Results).\nConduct a GC test (Econometric toolbox, MATLAB) within each dyad in the supportive and conflict topics separately.\n\t\tNOTE: Four groups of F-values are obtained for INSGC: (1) from women to men on the supportive topic (W2M_supp); (2) from men to women on the supportive topic (M2W_supp); (3) from women to men on the conflict topic (W2M_conf); and (4) from men to women on the conflict topic (M2 W_conf). The F-values are used to index the INSGC.\nSecond-level fNIRS data processing\n\t\nTransform INS with Fisher-z transformation, and then average INS at the temporal dimension.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, Fisher-z transformation was conducted using a custom MATLAB script with Equation 636:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62927/62927eq06.jpg\n\t\twhere, r is the value of the WTC or pWTC, and z is the Fisher-z transformed value of the WTC or pWTC.",
    "For the averaged INS at each time lag, conduct a paired two-sample t-test (supportive vs. conflict) on each CH pair across the frequency range. Then, identify all significant frequency clusters (P < 0.05).\nConduct a cluster-based permutation test to establish a threshold for the results.\n\t\t\nReassign dyadic relationships by randomly assigning the participants to new two-member pairs, i.e., the participants of a dyad that had never communicated with one another. Recalculate the INS at each time lag, perform paired t-tests again in the new sample, and identify significant frequency clusters again.\nSelect the cluster with the largest summed t-value. Repeat the above procedures 1000 times to generate a null distribution of the maximum false-positive t-values.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The distribution is served as the chance level. The familywise error rate (FWER) is controlled at q = 0.05, which means that only the top 5% of the null distribution of the false-positive t-values exceeds the threshold (R*).\nCompare the summed t-value of each identified frequency cluster in the original sample with the null distribution to obtain significant statistical results.\nConduct a context (supportive, conflict) x direction (women to men, men to women) analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the difference in INS direction between different conditions (i.e., topics) (p < 0.05).\nConduct a paired two-sample two-tailed t-test between the results of WTC (Wt, Mt + n) and WTC (Mt, Mt + n) to test the potential impact of autocorrelation on INS.\n\t\tNOTE: The INS of WTC (Mt, Mt + n) reflects autocorrelation.\nSubscription Required.
