    "1. Biobrick Design and Synthesis of the Curli Operon\nDetermine the genetic organization and localize the endogenous transcriptional and translational signals of the curli genes. These informations are gathered in specialized databases such as RegulonDBa or EcoGeneb and completed by a careful reading of pertinent publications. Data management and in silico preanalysis were performed with Clone Manager softwarec.\nSelect the pertinent coding sequences. A set of five absolutely required genes for curli synthesis (csgB and csgA encoding fiber monomers) and export (csgE csgF and csgG, encoding the curlin secretion complex) were selected to construct the synthetic operon. Extract the chosen sequences from the data base in FASTA format.\n\tAs the csgGFE cluster is antisense in E. coli genome, convert this sequence into its reverse complement counterpart by using the Clone Manager tools Operations> Process molecule>Invert molecule. Paste the csgEFG sequence behind csgBA by using the function \"Ligate\" (Clone> Ligate).\nAdd the appropriate promoter. By placing the five selected curli genes under control of the promoter Prcn, curli are predicted to be over-produced in presence of cobalt and nickel. The rcn locus encodes an efflux pump responsible for Ni and Co detoxification (rcnA) and its cognate metallo-regulator (rcnR). RcnR controls the expression of rcnA and its own gene in response to Ni and Co 19. The rcn sequence comprising rcnR CDS, the whole rcn intergenic region plus the 41 first nucleotides of rcnA was placedin front of the csgBAEFG chimerical sequence (Figure 1, the sequence of the whole construct is provided as supplementary data).",
    "Optimize the transcriptional signals. A perfect ribosome binding site (or perfect RBS= AAGGAGGTATATA) was added in front of the first ATG of the csgBA DNA sequence. A second perfect RBS was added in front of the csgEFG sequence. Endogenous RBS for the csgB and csgF and csgG genes were conserved.\nTo fit iGEM standards, the device must be flanked by a standard BioBrick prefix and suffix, containing restriction sites for EcoRI, PstI (prefix) and SpeI and XbaI (suffix). Paste the corresponding sequences at each end of the deviced.\nEliminate any EcoRI, PstI, SpeI and XbaI recognition site in the device. To facilitate further assembly process, the BioBrick part itself may not contain any of these restriction sites. In silico restriction analysis of the device revealed one PstI site in the csgA sequence, one PstI site in the rcnR sequence and one EcoRI site in the csgE gene. These sites are respectively located in position 80 (Mut1), 1340 (Mut2) and 1830 (Mut3) of the device sequence (supplementary data) and were modified as follow by silent mutations.\n\tMut1 PstI site CTGCAG changed in CGTCTG\n\tMut2 PstI site CTGCAG changed in CAGCAG\n\tMut3 EcoRI site GAATTC changed in GAATT\nRun through the translation simulation using the Clone Manager software (Operation>Process molecules>Translate molecules). Use the sequence alignment program BLAST to verify the perfect homology between the wild type curli protein and the proteins encoded by the synthetic operon.\nOrder the synthetic operon. Commercial gene synthesis services are available from numerous companies worldwide, our partner was Genecust (Luxembourg). 4 μg of the artificial operon (3165 bp) were received few weeks later and inserted into pUC57 (pIG2).\n2. Visualize and Quantify Adherent Bacteria on Polystyrene",
    "Fill each well of a 24-well polystyrene plate with 2 ml of M63 minimal medium (glucose 0.2%) and inoculate each well with 106 cells of an overnight culture. Grow bacteria at 30 °C for 18 to 48 hr without shaking. Each column (4 wells) represents a modality. Add the proper amount of cobalt (25 to 100 mM) and antibiotic (ampicillin 100 μg.L-1) when needed. The 3 first rows of the 24-well plate are used to quantify the adherent bacteria by averaging the 3 repetitions, the last row left is used to visualize the biofilm.\nFor the 3 first rows of the 24-well plate: for each well, recover the supernatant containing the planktonic cells.\nCarefully rinse each well with 1 ml of M63 and pool the 1 ml wash with the initial supernatant obtained in 2.2). This pool is referred to as swimming cells (=S).\nRecover the biofilm in 1 ml of M63 by scraping and pipetting up and down (=B). Vortex 15 sec. Estimate the number of surface-attached and swimming bacteria from the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) to give the adherence percentage corresponding to each modality.\nThe percentage of adherence is calculated by using the formula: Bx100/(3xS+B).\nOnly for the last row of the 24-well plate: discard planktonic cells.\nRinse with 1 ml of M63 the biofilm which had developed on the bottom of the plate.\nDry the open plate for 1 hr at 80 °C.\nAdd 100 μl of 20% crystal violet for 2 min in each well followed by extensive washes with water to visualize the surface-attached bacteria.\n\tThree independent assays (plates) have to be performed to ensure reproducibility.\n3. Visualize Adherent Bacteria on Glass by Microscopy",
    "Get a fluorescent chassis. The E. coli SCC1e strain which constitutively expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) with no observable difference from the parent strain MG1655 20 is a suitable host for the plasmid bearing the synthetic curli operon.\nTransform SCC1 with the pIG2 plasmid (=synthetic curli operon inserted at the EcoRI/PstI site of the pUC57 plasmid) to obtain the S23 strain. Transform SCC1 with a control plasmid (pUC18) to obtain the control strain S24 21.\nGrow overnight precultures of the S23 and of the control (S24) strains at 30 °C in M63 medium supplemented with glucose (0.2 %) and ampicillin (100 μg.L-1).\nInoculate 15 ml of the same medium in Petri dishes with 100 μl of the precultures. Add the appropriate concentration of cobalt (i.e. 25 μM) and don't forget the negative control without cobalt. Introduce 3 rectangular glass coverslip in each Petri dish. Incubate overnight at 30 °C without shaking.\nRemove the coverslip from the Petri dish and carefully drain it. Carefully clean the lower face with a small cotton stuff impregnated with 70 ° ethanol by wiping off every bacterial residue. For confocal observation, clean both upper ends on a few millimeters to allow further fixation of the coverslip.\nAdherent bacteria can be visualized directly but quickly under fluorescence microscope, but carefully avoid drying of the sample.\nFor confocal observation, deposit the coverslip on a glass slide with the upper face covered by the biofilm placed face up. The biofilm is then covered with a larger coverslip, which is fixed to the glass slide with varnish. Invert the setup so that the biofilm will now be on the lower face.\nPlace the setup under the confocal laser microscope. A right Axioplan2 LSM510 (Zeiss) confocal laser microscope was used at the Platim platformf.",
    "Setting. Excite GFP at 488 nm, and collect the bacterial fluorescence in the range 500 to 600 nm. Use 40x oil immersion objective for acquiring images in laser scanning confocal mode. Scan the overall three-dimensional structures of the biofilms from the solid surface to the interface with the growth medium, using a step of 1 μm.\nPerform three-dimensional projections with IMARIS software (Bitplane, Zürich, Switzerland). Determine biofilm thickness by the analysis of the average z value along statistical longitudinal sections. Quantification of biofilm biovolumes can be extracted from confocal z-stacks as described elsewhere 22.\naRegulonDB provides mechanistic information about operon organization and their decomposition into transcription units, promoters and their sigma type, genes and their ribosome binding sites, terminators, binding sites of specific transcriptional regulators,as well as their organization into regulatory phrases. http://regulondb.cs.purdue.edu/index.jsp[href=http://regulondb.cs.purdue.edu/index.jsp]\nbThe EcoGene database contains updated information about the E. coli K-12 genome and proteome sequences, including extensive gene bibliographies.
