    "1. Optical Setup\nUse a standard  compound microscope with epifluorescence imaging capabilities. We use a Nikon  Eclipse Ti-U inverted microscope with an Intensilight HG Illuminator.\nFor best image and  signal quality use a high magnification, high numerical aperture objective. We  typically use a Nikon X60 1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective. In some cases it is  possible to use lower magnification (X40, X20) depending on expression level of  the fluorophore and signal strength.\nUse a high  sensitivity cooled CCD camera, such as an Andor Clara Camera to maximize image  sensitivity and minimize background noise.\nFor single color  fluorophores use the standard microscope fluorescence filter set designed for  the particular wavelength of the fluorophore. For GCaMP use a standard GFP  filter set optimized for excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm. No  further optical modifications are required.\nFor ratiometric  fluorophores, such as cameleon, use a dual imaging system such that identical  images can be simultaneously captured at two separate wavelengths. This is accomplished by projecting the dual  images side-by-side onto the camera. A simple setup to accomplish this, using  basic optical components on an optical grade breadboard, is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of: \n  \nA microscope filter  set with 440 ±20 nm excitation filter and 455 nm long pass dichroic mirror. \nAn image mask placed  at the initial image plane immediately outside the microscope imaging port  (where the camera CCD sensor would usually sit). This restricts the field of  view such that it will fill only half of the camera sensor. Placing this mask  at the first image plane results in sharp image borders and no overlap when the  two images are projected side-by-side.\nThe first relay lens  set one focal length away from the initial image plane such that it collimates  the light.",
    "A dichroic mirror  that splits the light into the two separate imaging wavelengths or channels  reflecting one color (>515 nm, yellow) while transmitting the other (<515  nm, cyan).\nEmission filters  (band-pass filters) further restricting the transmitted light to the specific  imaging wavelengths (cyan at 485 ± 40 nm and yellow at 535 ± 30 nm),\nThe second relay  lenses (one for each channel) placed in the beam paths such that it refocuses  the light to a second image plane at the CCD camera.\nA pair of mirrors and  a second dichroic mirror directs the beam paths such that the two images  recombined and are projected side-by-side onto the camera CCD sensor. Figure 4A shows an example of the  resulting image.",
    "Initial Optical  Alignment: Initiate setup and alignment of the optics with a high contrast  image using a low magnification lens and transmitted wide-field light  illumination (a black sharpie drawn on a microscope slide works well). Bring  the image to focus through the microscope oculars and then switched to the  microscope port to be used. With high light illumination view the image on an  index card at the initial focal plane (a few cm outside the microscope port).  Place the first relay lens (C) in the beam path such that it is one focal  distance from the initial focal plane and collimates the light while not  deflecting the beam path (i.e. is  directly centered in the beam path). Place the mask at the first focal plane,  adjusted to restrict half the field of view and produce a sharp boarder in the  image. Position the mirrors and filters (D, E, G) such that the beam path  remains parallel to the table surface and runs in two parallel paths  side-by-side, as shown in Figure 1B.  Center the second relay lenses (F) in their respective beam paths and move them  back and forth along the paths to bring the images to a focus on an index card  placed were the camera CCD sensor will be. If done correctly the two images  should be parfocal with the microscope oculars and other camera ports. Finally  place the camera in position and fine-tune the alignment.",
    "Fine Tuning Optical  Alignment: Use the dual image viewed by the CCD camera to fine tune the optical  alignment. Use a high contrast image and start with lower magnification, switching  to higher magnification for final alignment. Position the transmitted image  (cyan channel in Figure 1B) to cover  one half of the camera's field of view by moving the camera in X and Y. Position the reflected image (yellow channel  in Figure 1B) to cover the other  half of the field of view by adjusting the last two mirrors (G) in its beam  path. Optimize focus by moving the second relay lens for each channel back and  forth along the beam path. If left unaltered the optical setup should be stable  and only require rare fine tune adjustment.\n2.  Sample Preparation and Data Acquisition.\nAcquire animals  expressing a calcium sensitive fluorophore in the neuron of interest from the  Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (C.G.C.) or other sources. Alternatively transgenic  animals can be constructed using standard C.  elegans techniques. Single cell expression is not necessary (and sometimes  not desirable if multiple neurons are to be investigated, see 12) as long as images and measurements from  multiple cells can be readily separated. If the fluorophore transgene is not  integrated into the genome, significant variation in expression can occur from  animal to animal. In this case, preselecting animals with higher expression  levels using a fluorescent dissecting microscope increases the signal-to-noise  ratio and improves the measurements. Fluorophore expression levels need to be  sufficient to be readily imaged with the camera under the acquisition  parameters required by the experiment.",
    "Make the agarose pads  required for the desired immobilization technique (see 2.3 below) by pressing a  small drop of molten agarose between two glass slides spaced by two pieces of  laboratory tape. If necessary, agarose pads can be transferred to a glass cover  slip before mounting the animals. See Figure  2.\nImmobilize C. elegans for imaging using one of the  following techniques:\n  \nPharmacological  Paralyzation: Add 0.05% Levamisole to 2% agarose pads (mixing it into the molten  agarose before making the pads in 2.2). Pick 5-10 animals onto the pad and  cover with a cover slip. Apply small  amounts of hot wax mixture (50% paraffin wax and 50% petroleum jelly) to the  corners of the cover slip to hold it in position. Allow 5-10 min for the  Levamisole to take effect and the animals to become completely still.\nStiff Agarose  Immobilization: C. elegans can be  physically immobilized using stiff 10% agarose pads and 0.05 μm diameter polystyrene nanoparticles. Make 10% agarose pads (10% agarose in NGM  buffer by weight) as in 2.2. Add ~3 μl of bead solution (1:10 polystyrene  microspheres into NGM by volume) to the top of the pad. Quickly, pick 5-10 C. elegans into the pool of bead  solution on the pad and gently cover with a cover slip. Use molten wax applied  to the corners of the cover slip to hold it in position. (For additional  details on this technique see 7 as well as a previous JoVE article 8)\nGluing: C. elegans can be glued in place using  small amounts of veterinary grade adhesive applied to one side of the animal.\nMicrofluidic Devices:  Numerous microfluidic devices have been designed to physically hold C. elegans in place for imaging.",
    "Place the prepared  slide on the microscope and focus on the desired neuron. It is often easiest to  find the C. elegans using bright  field illumination and low magnification. Then switching to high magnification  and fluorescence imaging to find and focus on the specific neuron. \nStimulus: If a  neuronal response to a specific stimulus is desired (light, electric field,  gustatory and olfactory cues, temperature etc.), the stimulus apparatus must be  designed into the microscope setup, such that it may be administered to the  animals in the sample preparation while imaging. \nAcquire images using  the microscope CCD camera. Exposure  times and excitation light level will depend on the baseline signal and  expression level of the fluorophore, with weaker signals requiring longer  exposure times with concordantly less time resolution. We typically use ~300 msec exposure times.\nAcquire images either  individually or as a time-lapse movie. Because C. elegans neurons generally display slow activation dynamics (i.e. they lack sodium based action  potentials), relatively slow frame rates of ~1 sec are often  sufficient to measure neuron dynamics. Acquisition rates up to ~90 frames per second have been used although  these may be limited by the integration time necessary for weak  fluorescence. Individual movies of a  single neuron can easily extend for several minutes (~5-10 min) or longer if the immobilization  preparation is stable and the frame rate relatively slow.\n3.  Data Analysis\nThere are a number of  different fluorescent imaging software packages available with dynamic and ratiometric  analysis capabilities including ImageJ and NIS-Elements. We use a simple custom  MATLAB program that measures the average fluorescent signal over a selected  region of interest.",
    "For individual images  (or time-lapse movies that remain perfectly still) select a region of interest  (ROI) within the imaged neuron and a separate nearby region for the background  measurement. For ratiometric images select similar ROI and background regions  for each of the dual images. \nSlight movement of  the imaged neuron within a time-lapse movie requires additional analysis to  automatically select the ROI in each frame, which can be accomplished using  numerous object tracking schemes. Our program displays a compressed image of  all images in the movie from which a rough boundary (encompassing the object of  interests in all frames) is manually selected and an independent background  region selected. For the first frame, an ROI is manually selected from within  the boundary region. For each subsequent frame, the program selects the  brightest pixels from within the boundary region to generate an ROI of the  correct size (i.e. the same number of  pixels as the manual first frame ROI). For images where the object of interests  is sufficiently brighter then the surrounding background within the boundary  region this protocol selects a reasonable ROI for each frame.\nThe fluorescent  signal, F, for each frame is calculated as the average pixel intensity in the  ROI minus the average intensity in the background region. Ratiometric values  are calculated as the ratio of the two signals (YFP-YFPbackground)/(CFP-CFPbackground)-0.65.  The factor of 0.65 compensates for bleed through of the CFP channel into the  YFP channel, which will be dependant on the fluorophores as well as the particular  filter set used (this value is typically ~0.6 for cameleon  setups).",
    "The relative calcium  level for each frame is calculated as the percent change in intensity  normalized to an initial baseline value measured from the first frame (or  series of frames): ΔF/F=(F(t)-Fo)/  Fo, where F(t) is the fluorescence at time t and Fo is  the initial baseline value.\nA ROI selecting the  cell body generates the strongest most robust signals but it is also possible  to select and measure signals from a ROI along the nerve processes.\n4.  Problem Solving\nBleaching: Exposure to excitation light can cause bleaching of the fluorophore  and is marked by a steady decrease in signal that is dependent on exposure  levels. Ratiometric measurements help to compensate for this. However selective  bleaching of one wavelength can still occur (typically CFP bleaches quicker  then YFP). If bleaching occurs reduce  the light exposure level by reducing exposure times and/or excitation intensity  (with neutral density filters in the illumination pathway). If necessary, one  can compensate for bleaching by running mock trials (with the same excitation  exposure but no neuronal stimulus) and quantifying the time constant of signal  decay.\nImmobilization: For the simple image analysis described here it  is critical the animal remains relatively still throughout the recording  period. C. elegans respond to light  exposure and experimental stimuli, making them most likely to move at the time  of recording. Slight movement can introduce significant noise into the  measurement especially when measuring from axon processes. Ratiometric analysis  helps to mitigate these effects to some extent and measurements from the cell  body are more robust. Careful execution and refinement of the immobilization  procedures will result in completely still animals.",
    "Background Selection: Careful selection of a background region is  necessary for successful image analysis. Background regions should be  reasonably uniform and darker then the imaged neuron. It must be sufficiently  removed to avoid scattered light (and thus pickup a signal) from the imaged  neuron. We find a uniform region 20-50 μm from the ROI works  well in most cases.\nRatiometric Optics: Correct alignment of the imaging optics is  critical for generating a clear dual image. Commercial microscope attachments  for ratiometric imaging are available. An alternative technique is to employ  rapid sequential imaging using a fast filter wheel to rapidly switch between  emission wavelengths while recording separate images for each.\nRatiometric Analysis: The analysis described here is a relatively  simple technique that generates robust signals by virtue of averaging over a  ROI. It requires a recognizably bright object to select the ROI. More sophisticated  ratiometric analysis is possible by precisely aligning and mapping the dual  images such that the fluorescent ratio can be calculated pixel by pixel. \nSubscription Required.
