    "NOTE: Human bone marrow aspirates from the iliac crest were collected from consenting donors with the approval of the ethics committee of the canton of Lucerne. Canine bone marrow aspirates from the iliac crest were collected with dog owner’s consent.Human (approx. 20 ml) and canine (approx. 10 ml) bone marrow aspirates were anti-coagulated by addition of 15 ml of 3.8% sodium citrate immediately after withdrawal in the operation theatre. The samples were transferred to the laboratory environment for processing the same day as withdrawn.\n1. Preparation of Urokinase (Prior to 1st Use)\nReconstitute urokinase using sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) according to the manufacturer’s instructions: Add 10 ml PBS to the septum-inlet flask using a 10 ml syringe. Dissolve the dry substance by swirling to obtain 50,000 injection units (U) per ml.\nPrepare 500 µl aliquots (25,000 U each) into sterile tubes. Store aliquots -20 °C and use it when required for at least 6 months.\n2. Preparative Steps (Prior to Every Bone Marrow Treatment)\nThaw one aliquot of urokinase (25,000 U) per clotted bone marrow aspirate (aspirate volumes up to 25 ml have been successfully treated using a single aliquot of 25,000 U).\nPreheat a water bath or shaking incubator to 37 °C.\n3. Enzymatic Digest of the Clot\nPerform all work in a laminar flow biosafety cabinet to avoid microbial contamination of the bone marrow samples during processing. When working with potentially infectious human material, the use of protective gloves as well as careful handling is advised.\nPlace a 100 µm cell strainer on top of a sterile 50 ml tube. Carefully pour the bone marrow aspirate through the cell strainer, tilting the strainer or moving around the clot material. Use a sterile pipet tip for better flow through the filter mesh.",
    "NOTE: Avoid any dilution of the clot, e.g., by washing the clot with PBS. Urokinase acts indirectly and requires components of the serum (i.e., plasminogen) from the biopsy for effective digest. While continuing the procedure with the clot material, the filtrate can be kept at RT until further use in step 3.6.\nTransfer the bone marrow clot material into an empty cell culture dish using sterile forceps. Cut the debris into small pieces of approximately 2 mm3 using a sterile scalpel.\nTransfer the small pieces of the clot into a 50 ml reaction tube using the sterile forceps. Ensure that the minced clot has a wet appearance. If it appears to be dry, use some of the filtrate from step 3.1 to moisten.\nTriturate the clot by pipetting up and down for 5 times using a 5 ml microtiter pipet. Add 1 aliquot of urokinase to the sample. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C either in a water bath or in a shaking (gently) incubator.\nTriturate by pipetting up and down for 5 times using a 5 ml pipet. Perform this step in a biosafety cabinet. Incubate for another 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, triturate again 5 times using a 5 ml pipet. Pass over a fresh 100 µm cell strainer to pool with the filtrate from step 3.2.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at ambient temperature for 10 min at 500 x g. Discard the supernatant. Re-suspend the cell pellet in media as described below or according to the standard procedure of your laboratory for MSC expansion culture.\n4. Seeding for Expansion Cell Culture and CFU Plates",
    "Resuspend the cells (consisting of erythrocytes and mononuclear cells) in 50 ml of basal medium: Alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2.5 mg/ml amphotericin B. Count the cells diluted 1:10 in Trypan Blue solution using a Neubauer chamber.\nPlate the cells in cell culture flasks at the density of 5 x 107 cells/cm2 and incubate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. If available, use hypoxic (5% oxygen) conditions. For the CFU assay control, plate 109 cells in a cell culture dish of 10 cm diameter.\nAfter 3 days of culture, mesenchymal stem cells are attached to the cell culture dish while other cells remain in suspension. Change the media with basal medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). For the CFU assay control, treat the cell culture dish likewise.\nContinue cell culture for a total of 2 weeks, exchanging media three times a week. If cells exceed 80% confluency, split by trypsinization. For the CFU assay control, exchange the media likewise, but do not split the cells for the course of the two weeks.\n5. Giemsa Stain for CFU Assay\nPrepare 10 ml of Giemsa-solution per dish: dilute the stock solution (7.6 g/l Giemsa in glycerol:methanol) 1:10 in sterile water (always prepare a fresh working dilution).\nRemove the media from the cell culture dish and wash the cells with PBS. Be very precautious when applying liquid to the petri dish and avoid washing off the cells.\nFix cells in pure Methanol for 5 min at RT. Discard the Methanol. Add the Giemsa-solution and incubate for 60 min in a humidified incubator at 37 °C.",
    "Wash two times with PBS. Air dry the plate head first on a paper towel. Count the colonies manually. This is best achieved using a marker pen on the back of the plate.\n6. MSC Differentiation\nCanine MSCs differentiation\n\tNOTE: Canine MSCs were differentiated into chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic lineages by stimulation with the appropriate media for four weeks.\nFor Adipogenic differentiation, culture MSCs in monolayer at 4 x 105 cells/cm2 alternating two different culture conditions as follows;\n\t\nCulture in adipogenesis maintenance media containing DMEM + GlutaMAX, 3% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 µg/ml amphotericin B and 170 mM insulin.\nCulture in adipogenesis inducing media with maintenance medium supplemented with 3% FBS, 5% rabbit serum, 1 µM dexamethasone, 500 µM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 33 µM biotin, 5 µM rosiglitazone and 17 µM pantothenate 16.\nRevel the lipid droplets by staining with Oil Red-O. Briefly, fix cells with 10% formaldehyde, wash with PBS and stain with 0.35% Oil red O in isopropanol.\nFor Osteogenic differentiation culture MSCs in monolayer at 7 x 103 cells/cm2  and stimulate in the following:\n\t\nAdvanced DMEM (GIBCO) + GlutaMAX, 5 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 µg/ml amphotericin B, 50 µM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 10 mM ß-glycerophosphate and 100 nM dexamethasone.\nIdentify the mineralization deposits by Von Kossa stain (5 % AgNO3). Briefly, fix the cells with 10% formaldehyde, wash with PBS and stain with 5 % AgNO3in distilled water.\nChondrogenic differentiation\n\t\nCut cubes (3 mm per side) from a sponge shaped medical device, constituted from lyophilized collagen type I, and used as scaffold material to support cells 17.\nSeed MSCs on the top of the cubes at the concentration of 4 x 106 cells/ml (~70,000 cells/cube).",
    "Prior to the addition of media, allow the cells to adhere to the cubes for 30 min.\nMaintain MSC-collagen constructs in chondrogenic media consisting of DMEM/F12 + GlutaMAX, 2.5 % FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 µg/ml amphotericin B, 40 ng/ml dexamethasone, 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 50 µg/ml L-proline, 1x Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium X, and 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor-β1.\nUse alcian blue staining to visualize accumulation of proteoglycans in constructs sections. Briefly, stain the sections O/N with 0.4% alcian blue dissolved in 0.01% H2SO4 and 0.5M guanidine hydrochloride. Next, wash the sections were washed for 30 min in 40% DMSO and 0.05M MgCl2. Cells were counterstained with nuclear fast red.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
