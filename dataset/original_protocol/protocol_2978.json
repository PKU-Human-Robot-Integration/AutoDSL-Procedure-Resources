    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes the integration of the 2E2-FP expression cassette (steps 1–3), the 3HA or 6HA tagging of a POI in yeast (steps 4–6), and the fluorescent imaging of the generated yeast strains under the microscope (step 7). If a yeast strain expressing the desired 2E2-FP (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) is available, steps 1–3 can be ignored. In case a strain with 3HA or 6HA tagged POI is available, steps 4–6 can be ignored. Furthermore, steps 4–6 can precede steps 1–3.\nIntegration and expression of 2E2-FP\nTiming: 6–7 days\nSteps 1–3 include the integration of a 2E2-FP gene into the yeast genome followed by imaging of the expressed 2E2-FP protein in yeast cells.\nRestriction digestion of the desired 2E2-FP plasmid(s) (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nDigest 1–2 μg of the desired 2E2-FP plasmid with 0.5 μL of the appropriate restriction enzyme, according to manufacturer’s guidelines[href=https://international.neb.com/protocols/2012/12/07/optimizing-restriction-endonuclease-reactions].\nVerify the successful digestion of the 2E2-FP plasmid.\nLoad 100 ng of the digested plasmid and a sample of 1 kb DNA ladder onto a 1% agarose gel, stained with SYBR SAFE DNA Gel Stain, inside a gel-running device filled with TAE buffer.\nRun the gel for 30 min, 120 V and visualize under blue light or UV lamp.\nNote: A successful restriction of the pTZ1, pTZ2, and pTZ4 plasmids leads to two distinct bands: a longer band containing the 2E2-FP cassette with flanking homologous sequences to the integrative locus (4.3 kb–5.5 kb) and a shorter band containing the plasmid backbone (1.8 kb) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). In case non-integrative plasmid is selected, the 2E2-FP-selection marker cassette needs to be amplified and integrated in the desired genomic locus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2728-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Generation and validation of strains expressing 2E2-FP and HA-tagged GOI",
    "(A) Agarose gel UV photo showing the 1 kb DNA Ladder (L), and 100 ng of SrfI-restricted pTZ1A (1) or pTZ1E (2) plasmids (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). The 4.5 kb and 5.1 kb DNA bands correspond to the URA3pr-2E2-NLS-Envy-kanMX (1) or RPL15Apr-2E2-Envy-hphMX (2) cassettes respectively. The lower 1.8 kb DNA bands correspond to plasmid backbone.\n(B and C) Validation of 2E2-Envy integration in the yeast genome. (B) Top: Scheme of the 2E2-Envy-marker construct inside the yeast genome (ADE1 locus), showing the annealing regions of the Frw and Rev primers used in the validation of successful integration (See Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]). Expected PCR product sizes are 0.8 kb (KanMX Rev and Ade1Locus Frw primers) and 1 kb (HphMX Frw and Ade1Locus Rev) for pTZ1A and pTZ1E, respectively. Bottom: UV photo of agarose gel showing the validation PCR for colonies tested for the integration of the SrfI-restricted pTZ1A (7 colonies, left) or pTZ1E (7 colonies, right) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). All tested colonies were positive, as indicated by the strong PCR bands of the correct size. (C) Representative microscopy images of unlabeled yeast cells, or cells expressing 2E2-Envy constructs. Cells containing URA3pr-2E2-NLS-Envy (pTZ1A) present weak nuclear signal, while those with RPL15Apr-2E2-Envy (pTZ1E) show a non-localized stronger signal.\n(D) UV photo of agarose gel depicting the successful amplification of 3HA (1 and 3) and 6HA (2 and 4) with primers homologous to GOIs (Rfa1 and Nup159 genes for 1–2 and 3–4 respectively). See also Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.",
    "(E) As in (B), but for the validation of 3HA and 6HA integration at the C-terminus of the GOI (tagging of Rfa1 is shown as an example). Top: Scheme of the HA-tagged GOI inside the yeast genome. Expected PCR product size is 0.7 kb (Frw primer: NatMX Frw) (See Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]). Bottom: All tested colonies (Rfa1-3HA-natMX – 4 colonies, left and Rfa1-6HA-natMX – 4 colonies, right), were positive as indicated by the PCR bands of the correct size. In (B) and (E), 10 μL PCR products were loaded in the gel.\nPause point: Restriction digested plasmids can be stored at −20°C until further use.\nYeast transformation with the restriction digested 2E2-FP cassette for genome integration.\nInoculate yeast cells for transformation, from an agar plate or frozen glycerol stock, into 5 mL prewarmed YPD medium or an appropriate selective medium in a 50 mL falcon tube. Grow at 30°C in a shaker incubator.\nNote: If not stated otherwise, all incubation steps take place at 30°C in a shaker incubator.\nNext day, measure O.D.600 of the yeast culture and dilute cells to O.D.600 of 0.1 in 12 mL prewarmed YPD medium. Incubate for approximately 3 h or until O.D.600 = 0.35–0.50 is reached.\nWash step: Centrifuge yeast culture at 3000 × g for 5 min. Discard supernatant and wash twice with 10–15 mL ddH2O.\nResuspend washed cell pellet with 100 μL ddH2O.\nPrepare a transformation reaction in an Eppendorf tube, according to Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2728_7.csv\nMix by inverting, briefly vortex the transformation tube, and spin down briefly to collect any solution from the walls of the tube.\nIncubate the transformation reaction at 42°C in a shaker for 40–60 min.\nCentrifuge cells at 12000 × g for 1 min. Discard supernatant.",
    "Recovery step: Resuspend cells in 1–2 mL prewarmed YPD medium. Transfer resuspended cells to a 50 mL falcon tube and incubate for 2 h.\nCritical: Recovery step can be avoided when 2E2-HALOtag constructs (pTZ4) are integrated, as non-antibiotic selection is used in these cases.\nCentrifuge cells at 3000 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend with 100 μL of sterile ddH2O.\nTransfer the desired fraction of transformed cells on selective agar plates and spread cells using a spreader.\nNote: A few tens of positive colonies are expected to grow following transformation. However, transformation efficiency may vary depending on the target strain and DNA amount, thus, it is suggested plating multiple dilutions of the transformed cells to achieve the optimal outcome (e.g., 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20). [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3]\nIncubate the agar plates with the transformed cells at 30°C for 2–3 days.\nSelection, validation, and storage of positive colonies.\nTwo to three days following yeast transformation, colonies should be visible on the selective agar plate.\nPick 4–10 single yeast colonies and spread the cells on a selective agar plate with quadloops or pipette tips. Incubate for approximately 20 h at 30°C.\nPause point: Transformation and colony plates can be stored at 4°C, wrapped with parafilm, for 1–2 weeks, but it is recommended to continue immediately with the next steps.\nValidate successful transformants with PCR.\nNote: ALLIn™ RED Taq Mastermix or DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix, as well as other polymerases, can be used in the PCR validation of successfully transformed yeast colonies. Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] includes a list of primers which recognize unique sequences on the antibiotic cassettes or ADE1 locus which can be used for 2E2-FP integration and HA-labeling validation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2728_8.csv\nPrepare a Master Mix in an 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube according to manufacturer’s guidelines[href=https://www.highqu.com/ALLin-Red-Taq-Mastermix/PCM0205].",
    "Split into aliquots of 19.5 μL in PCR tubes according to the number of colonies tested.\nNote: Keep all PCR reagents and mixtures on ice prior to initiating the PCR reaction.\nInoculate a small amount of yeast colonies into separate Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μL NaOH 20 mM.\nVortex the tubes with yeast cells and heat at 100°C for 5 min to lyse the yeast cells.\nVortex briefly and centrifuge tubes at 20000 × g for 1 min.\nTransfer and mix 0.5 μL of each supernatant into the tubes with the PCR reaction.\nSpin down briefly, place inside a thermocycler, and initiate the PCR reaction protocol, according to manufacturer’s guidelines[href=https://www.highqu.com/ALLin-Red-Taq-Mastermix/PCM0205].\nVerify the successful amplification as described in step 1b by loading 10 μL of the PCR reactions in agarose gel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) [See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 4].\nImage positive colonies and long-term storage.\nInoculate the yeast colonies into 3 mL prewarmed SC medium in 50 mL falcon tubes. Vortex briefly and grow at 30°C in a shaker.\nNote: SC medium should always be used for microscope imaging instead of YPD, as YPD medium results in high background fluorescence.\nNext day, measure the O.D.600 of the yeast cultures and dilute cells to O.D.600 = 0.1–0.15 in 2 mL prewarmed SC medium in 50 mL falcon tubes. Grow for 2–3 h at 30°C in a shaker to O.D.600 = 0.3–0.5.\nTransfer 300–500 μL of yeast cultures into separate wells of uncoated 8-well Ibidi slides.\nImage yeast cultures with a wide-field or confocal fluorescence microscope for examining the expression level of 2E2-FP with the appropriate light source and beam splitter-filter set (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Critical: Along with the 2E2-FP yeast colonies, a WT strain, lacking any fluorescent marker, should be imaged simultaneously for comparison, especially in the case of 2E2-FP expressed from the weak URA3 promoter (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). In case a 2E2-FP version with NLS is used, only the cell nucleus should be fluorescently labeled (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nInoculate one or two colonies in 5 mL prewarmed YPD medium, supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic reagent(s). Grow yeast cultures at 30°C in a shaker.\nNext day, mix yeast cultures with 50% glycerol in 1:1 ratio in Eppendorf or Cryovial tubes.\nStore glycerol stocks at −80°C.\nPause point: Yeast strains can be stored long-term as glycerol stocks at −80°C and used for inoculation into prewarmed medium for future use.\nNote: Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] includes primers used during the validation of yeast strains expressing 2E2-FP and HA-labeled genes. The primers names specify the entity they bind. Primers numbered with “2” indicate alternative primers which can be used for the same gene/locus.\nTagging a POI with 3HA or 6HA in cells expressing 2E2-FP\nTiming: 6–7 days\nSteps 4–6 include the amplification and integration of the 3HA or 6HA cassette for tagging a POI in yeast cells expressing a 2E2-FP.\nAmplification of the HA cassette (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) with a high-fidelity polymerase.\nNote: KOD HOT Start and KAPA Hifi DNA Polymerases are two common polymerases utilized for such amplifications, but, in principle, any high-fidelity polymerase can be used. Reagent amounts and conditions suggested by the Taq polymerase manufacturer[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/IL/en/product/mm/71086?gclid=Cj0KCQjwla-hBhD7ARIsAM9tQKshpEAOoZnTlA9RnHy9WTuMo36HMRN0EVKUr_OfVurbrI3-yJF2FpMaAiK1EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds] should be applied.\nPrepare a Master Mix containing four to eight 25 μL PCR reactions in an Eppendorf tube.\nPipette 25 μL into PCR tubes or strip tubes (100–200 μL total PCR product).\nUse a 2-step PCR cycling protocol (Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2728_9.csv\nSee also Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].",
    "Note: Keep all PCR reagents and mixture on ice prior to initiating the PCR reaction.\nNote: The annealing temperature in 1st step of the PCR cycling conditions should be selected given the annealing sequence of the Frw and Rev primers to the HA cassette, as determined by the user (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nVerify the successful amplification of the HA cassette as in step 1b. The expected size should be approximately 1.7 kb and 1.9 kb for 3HA and 6HA respectively (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nOptional: To improve genomic integration of the HA cassette, extension primers can be utilized for further amplification of the PCR product leading to increased homology with the gene of interest, as described in step 3 of primer design.\nPause point: PCR products can be stored at −20°C until further use.\nTransformation of the 3HA or 6HA cassettes in yeast strains expressing 2E2-FP as described in step 2.\nNote: Use 100–200 μL of PCR product from step 4 for the yeast transformation in place of the “digested plasmid” listed (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\nSelection, validation, and storage of successfully HA-transformed yeast colonies as in step 3.\nNote: Here, the Frw and Rev primers for validation of HA cassette recognize unique sequences on the antibiotic cassette(s) or downstream of the GOI terminator, respectively (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\nPause point: Transformants and colony plates can be stored at 4°C, wrapped with parafilm, for 1–2 weeks, but it is recommended to continue immediately with the next steps. Yeast strains can be long-term stored at −80°C as glycerol stocks and inoculated into prewarmed medium for imaging.\nLive cell fluorescent imaging of HA tagged POI labeled with 2E2-FP\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis step describes the microscopic examination of HA-tagged POIs labeled by the 2E2-FP.\nFluorescent imaging of 2E2-FP labeled HA-tagged proteins in live yeast cells.",
    "Inoculate the yeast strains from an agar plate or glycerol stock into 5 mL prewarmed SC medium in a 50 mL falcon tube. Vortex briefly and grow at 30°C in a shaker.\nNext day, measure the O.D.600 of the yeast cultures. Dilute cells to O.D.600 = 0.1–0.15 in 2 mL prewarmed SC medium in 50 mL falcon tubes. Grow for 2–3 h in a shaker at 30°C to O.D.600 = 0.3–0.5.\nBriefly vortex cell cultures and transfer 300–500 μL of yeast cultures into separate wells of ConA-coated 8-well Ibidi slides for immobilization.\nIncubate at 25°C for 10–15 min according to the desired cell confluence on the slide.\nNote: If O.D.600 ≈ 0.4, then transfer 350 μL of cell cultures into wells and incubate for 10 min for a final well confluence ≈ 50%–70%.\nWashing steps: Remove the medium from the wells and gently pipette fresh 500 μL prewarmed SC medium into the wells and discard. Repeat 1–2 times.\nAdd 350 μL prewarmed SC medium into the wells.\nImage the immobilized yeast cells with a wide-field or confocal microscope inside a temperature-controlled enclosure.\nTurn on the fluorescent microscope and set temperature to 30°C to sustain normal yeast physiology at least 2–3 h prior to the microscopy experiment.\nOpen the imaging software.\nChoose the objective lens (e.g., 40×, 63×, 100× etc.) according to the magnification preference which best fits your experiment.\nFor optimal resolution use 1 × 1 binning in the camera settings, if applicable.\nUse the appropriate light source - beam splitter - filter set to excite and detect the selected fluorescent protein (Excitation with 390 nm, 488 nm, 590 nm, and 640 nm for Electra1, Envy, mKate2, and Silicon Rhodamine respectively). Use bright-field or DIC to visualize yeast cell morphology.",
    "Adjust illumination intensity and exposure time according to the fluorescent intensity of the labeled protein, so that a strong and clear signal can be obtained, for further quantification and analysis.\nTo detect fluorescent signal throughout the whole cell body, acquire multiple Z-slices (e.g., 12 Z-slices with 800 nm steps).\nIn time-lapse experiments, excite cells periodically in the preferred intervals for the desired time period.\nSave microscopy experiment output (photos or video files) and proceed with image analysis.\nNote: Fluorescent imaging protocol and conditions vary according to the user’s preferences and experiment type.\nCritical: We suggest, when imaging yeast strains expressing an HA-tagged protein with 2E2-FP for first time, to simultaneously image yeast cells expressing the POI directly fused with a FP, either at C- or N-terminal ends. Alternatively or simultaneously, readers can consult previously published results or online databases (e.g., SGD[href=https://www.yeastgenome.org/], LoQAtE[href=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/loqate/welcome-proteome-atlas-budding-yeast]10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) with information about the localization of fluorescently labeled yeast proteins. These controls and preparations can serve as bona fide comparison and validation of the 2E2-FP labeling efficiency."
