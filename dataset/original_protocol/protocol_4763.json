    "Day 0. Immunize mice with:CpG-B 1826 (30 μg/mouse)DOTAP (60 μg/mouse)Ovalbumin (100 μg/mouse)All reagents are diluted in sterile 1x DPBS (to a final total volume of 200 μl/mouse) and the final solution is inoculated by intravenous (i.v.) retro-orbital injection in the eye of each mouse. As control for immunization, some mice receive retro-orbital i.v. injections of sterile 1x DPBS: these naive/non-immunized mice are used to calculate the % of specific lysis, as compared to immunized mice.Naive non-injected mice will also be used for isolating splenocytes and pulsing them with peptides, and will also be used as control mice (see step B14).Day 7. Injection of splenocytes pulsed with the peptide and labeled with a high concentration of CFSE + splenocytes not pulsed with the peptide but labeled with a low concentration of CFSEIsolate the spleen of naive non-injected mice (1 naive non-injected mouse for every 3 OVA-immunized or DPBS-injected mice + control mouse) and place each spleen in a well (6-well plate).Mechanically disrupt the spleen to obtain single-cell suspensions in a small volume of DPBS (1-2 ml), and then wash cells with DPBS and centrifuge (652 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C).Resuspend the pellet and treat with ACK lysing buffer to lyse red blood cells: Add 2 ml of ACK per spleen and incubate for 2 min (at room temperature, RT).Wash each spleen suspension with 2-3 ml of RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin and filter them on cell strainers (40 μm). Pool the suspensions all together in one Falcon 50 tube (or more if many spleens are used for the experiments), add RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin until you reach 50 ml and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C).Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin; divide splenocytes into two halves.",
    "Add the peptide to one half (peptide SIINFEKL 10 μg/ml in the final volume of 2 ml per half spleen). For example: If 10 spleens are used for the experiment, 10 half-spleens will be pulsed with SIINFEKL (meaning 10 x 2 ml = 20 ml final volume) while the other half (equal volume as the final volume of spleen+ SIINFEKL; in our example: 20 ml) will remain without peptide.Incubate both suspensions for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Gently mix every 10 min.Wash in RT DPBS 1x and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C) twice.In the meantime, prepare two solutions of CFSE (dilutions in 1x DPBS) in the dark:CFSEhigh solution: 2.5 μM (diluted from the stock solution kept at -20 °C)CFSElow solution: 0.25 μM (dilution 1/10 from the CFSEhigh solution)Discard the supernatants and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml of DPBS and count the cells.Then, add the necessary volume of the CFSE solutions to their respective cell suspension to obtain a final concentration of 107 cells/ml as follows:CFSEhigh solution to the splenocytes pulsed with peptide (2.5 μM of CSFE)  CFSElow solution to the splenocytes without peptide (0.25 μM of CSFE) Incubate 15 min at RT in the dark.Wash each suspension with 40 ml of RPMI + 10% of FCS and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Discard the supernatant and wash again with RPMI + 10% of FCS and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 1x DPBS and count cells:Splenocytes pulsed with peptide (and CFSEhigh)Splenocytes without peptide (and CFSElow)Resuspend each suspension in DPBS to obtain a final concentration of 5 x 106/100 μl.Pool suspensions (both CFSEhigh andlow) together (ratio 1:1) and inject i.v. 200 μl of the mix to OVA-immunized and DPBS-injected mice.",
    "Do not forget to inject a naive (previously non-injected, non-immunized) mouse as control.Wait 20-24 h.Day 8Kill recipient mice, remove their spleen and put it on a cell strainer (40 μm) on a Falcon 50 tube. Mechanically disrupt the spleens (individually) to obtain single-cell suspensions, treat splenocytes with ACK buffer (2 ml/spleen) as described in steps B1-3.Wash with DPBS 1x and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, RT).Resuspend pellets in 1 ml of FACS buffer.Count cells and resuspend them to get 5 x 107 cell/ml.Filter using a 40 μm cell strainer (to avoid FACS blocking).FACS acquisition: On the Forward Scatter (FSC) vs. Side scatter (SSC) plot, gate cells on total splenocytes, then when plotting CFSE (in the FL-1, GFP or FITC channel) vs. SSC, gate on total CFSE+ cells. Within this gate, using another CFSE vs. SSC plot, distinguish between the CFSEhigh and CFSElow populations. Acquire 10,000 total CFSE+ events (i.e. of both populations: CFSEhigh and low). The number of total CFSE+ events should be the same for all the samples analyzed in order to better compare between OVA-immunized and non-immunized mice. In case 10,000 events cannot be reached, 5,000 events can be acquired, as long as the final number is the same for all samples.Data analysisFor the analysis of the FACS data after acquisition, 2 populations (the CFSEhigh and the CFSEhigh) are distinguished by using the following gating strategy: Define the splenocyte gate on FSC and SSC, then after excluding the doublets, gate on the total CFSE+ cells. Within the CFSE+ cells, gate on the CFSEhigh and the CFSElow and determine (i) the percentage of CFSEhigh within total CFSE+ cells and (ii) the percentage of CFSElow within total CFSE+ cells.",
    "To calculate the percentage of specific lysis, use the following equation for each mouse (OVA or DPBS) or sample, compared to one control “naive” un-injected mouse:% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x (% CFSEhigh immunized mouse/% CFSElow immunized mouse)/(% CFSEhigh naive mouse/% CFSElow naive mouse)."
