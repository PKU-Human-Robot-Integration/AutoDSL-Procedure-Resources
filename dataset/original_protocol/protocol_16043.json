    "This protocol outlines the steps required to prepare high-complexity samples for MS analysis by suspension trapping using an S-Trap™ column (Figs. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-fig-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-fig-0002]). This protocol is suitable for processing a wide variety of sample types, and details are provided for processing cells and tissues. By omitting the homogenization and sonication step used for cells and tissues, the workflow can be adopted for plasma, serum, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid, as described elsewhere (Ding et al., 2020; Mindikoglu et al., 2020). The protocol describes how to homogenize the sample in 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), then reduce, alkylate, immbolize, and digest the proteins on the S-Trap™ column. Peptides are then eluted from the column and can be analyzed directly by MS. Alternatively, with samples for which enhanced sequence coverage of lower-abundance peptides is required, Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0006] can be optionally used to fractionate the mixture of peptides based on their hydrophobicity (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-fig-0001]). Finally, Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0005] can be used directly after the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001] or Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0006] to assess how much of the sample should be used for MS analysis, or to normalize total peptide in the case of quantitative analyses.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bf29a84e-3092-447d-aaec-235ebd1d45b7/cpz185-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nOverview of a bottom-up proteomics preparation workflow for high to moderate-complexity samples using S-Trap™ processing, following the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001] and Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0004] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0005]. The sample is homogenized and sonicated before protein quantification. Disulfide bonds are reduced, and free thiols are alkylated. The sample is acidified, bound onto the S-trap™, and then washed free of contaminants. Digestion takes place on the spin column. Peptides are eluted, solvent is evaporated, and peptides are quantified.\nNOTE: Use only HPLC- and/or LC-MS-grade solvents throughout the protocol. All steps are performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nMaterials\nHigh-complexity sample (see protocol introduction)",

    "1a. If using tissue: Dice the flash-frozen or fresh tissue with razor in a disposable weigh dish. Tare 2-ml bead beater tube (from Precellys lysing kit) and then add ∼50-100 mg of tissue to the tube. Record weights.\nDice frozen tissue while still frozen. Keep samples on ice throughout protocol unless stated otherwise to reduce enzymatic digestion.\nProcess as follows:\n         \nAdd 9 time the tissue weight (in ml) of SDS tissue lysis buffer to the sample. For example, for 50 mg of tissue, add 450 ml SDS buffer. Cap the tube tightly.\nUsing the Precellys bead beater 24 or other homogenizer, homogenize the samples twice for 15 s each at 6500 rpm, with a 10-s pause in between. Immediately place tubes on ice.\n1b. If using cells: The amount of lysis buffer to use is based on the number of cells. Into the tube containing the pelleted cells, add the appropriate amount of SDS cell lysis buffer and Benzonase to degrade DNA, using the information below as a guide.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nNumber of cells,1-2 million,5 million,10 million,15-20 million\nLysis buffer,250 µl,300 µl,500 µl,600-800 µl\nBenzonase,0.5 µl,0.5 µl,1 µl,1.5 µl\n2. Suspend the tube adaptor from the block sonicator above an ice bucket, and place sample tube from step 1a or 1b in the tube adaptor. Make sure that both the bottom and top of the tube are embedded in ice. Run sonicator for 10 s on and then 10 s off, at 30% power, three times. Wait 1 min, and repeat the cycle two more times. Keep on ice afterwards.",
    "Sonication is necessary to shear DNA within the sample, which would otherwise clog the S-Trap™. Optimize the power levels according to your sonicator. Although a probe sonicator may be used, this increases the chance for cross-contamination, as the probe is reused and requires careful cleaning between uses. The block sonicator used here enables samples in closed tubes to be processed without cross-contamination.\n3. Clarify the sample by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g, 4°C. If there is visible particulate of insoluble material, use a P200 pipet to aspirate at least 100 µl of cell lysis off the top without disturbing particulate at the bottom of the tube, and transfer to a fresh centrifuge tube.\n4. Perform protein quantification (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0004]).\nDetermining the amount of protein in the sample will provide guidance about the amount of enzyme to use in later steps. This information can also be used to normalize among samples intended for quantitative analyses. As stated in Strategic Planning, for sample-limited cases, it is advisable to have an estimate of the total amount of protein based on a similar sample type, when possible. If, based on a representative sample, the amount of protein in the experimental sample is <10 µg, it will not be possible to perform protein quantification without using a majority of the sample for this step. However, if starting with 50-100 mg tissue or 5 million cells as stated above, there will be sufficient material to perform protein quantification.\nReduce disulfide bonds and alkylate free cysteine residues\n5. If the protein concentration exceeds 2 µg/µl, dilute samples to 2 µg/µl with lysis buffer and transfer 25 µl (i.e., 50 µg of protein) to a fresh tube.",
    "It is possible to use >25 µl, but this will require additional loading steps onto the S-trap™.\n6. Reduce disulfides by adding 2.5 µl of 100 mM TCEP (to 10 mM TCEP final). Cap and vortex to mix.\n7. Place tube(s) on an incubating mixer for 30 min at 1200 rpm, 37°C.\n8. Alkylate cysteines by adding 2.75 µl of 400 mM acrylamide (to 40 mM acrylamide final). Cap and vortex to mix.\n9. Place tube(s) on the incubating mixer for 30 min at 1200 rpm, 37°C.\nImmobilize and digest proteins\n10. Add 3 µl of 12% phosphoric acid. Cap and vortex to mix.\nThis step is essential as it brings the protein to the appropriate pH for trapping on the S-Trap™. Sample will be lost if this step is not performed. If starting with more volume than presented in these steps, add at least 10% volume of 12% phosphoric acid.\n11. Add 165 µl S-Trap™ binding/wash buffer to the 33 µl of acidified sample from step 10, giving a total volume of ∼198 µl. Cap and vortex to mix. Protein particulate may form initially, but solution should appear translucent after vortexing. Do not centrifuge.\nCentrifuging the sample at this step increases the risk of precipitating proteins and increases sample loss.\n12. Place the S-Trap™ column in a 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tube and add the acidified sample mixture to the column.\nColumn equilibration is not needed. Do not load >200 µl to the spin column. Do not allow the waste volume at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube to rise above the level of the bottom surface of the S-Trap™ column.\n13. Centrifuge the S-Trap™ column at 4000 × g for 2 min or until all of the sample has passed through the S-Trap™ column. Discard flowthrough.",
    "14. Wash the S-Trap™ column by adding 150 µl S-Trap™ binding/wash buffer to each trap. Repeat centrifugation. Discard flowthrough.\nIf using fixed angle, rotate the S-Trap™ columns a half turn between the centrifugation steps to avoid asymmetrical packing and washing. Remove wash flowthrough as necessary (i.e., after two centrifuge cycles for 2-ml waste tubes, but every cycle for smaller tubes) or transfer to additional tubes. Vacuum manifolds that apply pressure (e.g., Promega Vac-Man®) may also be used.\n15. Move the S-Trap™ column to a fresh 1.5-ml low-retention microcentrifuge tube for the digestion.\n16. Add 100 µl digestion buffer to one 20-µg vial of trypsin/LysC. Add 20 µl of the resulting dilution to the top of the S-trap™ column.\nIt is important to verify that there is no air bubble between the digestion solution and the trap bed by placing the tip of the pipet directly on the S-Trap™ sorbent bed when dispensing. The S-Trap™ will immediately begin to absorb the solution but may not flow through completely. Any air bubbles may be removed by gently tapping the side of the spin column. This protocol has been optimized for a complex sample with a total protein amount of 50 µg and uses an enzyme:protein ratio of ∼1:12.\n17. Cap the S-Trap™ column to limit evaporative loss.\n18. Proceed with trypsin/LysC digestion by incubating the sample for 2 hr at 37°C without agitation. After incubation, uncap the samples and add 40 µl S-Trap™ digestion buffer (50 mM TEAB).\n19. Centrifuge the S-Trap™ column in the sample collection tube for 2 min at 4000 × g.\nThe eluted peptides will collect in the sample tube. Do not discard this tube, as you will do three elutions and all of them will be collected in the same tube.",
    "20. Elute again into the same tube with 40 µl of 0.2% formic acid in water. Centrifuge again for 2 min at 4000 × g.\n21. Elute hydrophobic peptides into the same tube with 35 µl of 0.2% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile. Centrifuge again for 2 min at 4000 × g. Discard S-Trap™ column.\n22. Dry eluted peptides in a collection tube using a vacuum centrifuge 1-2 hr at room temperature, checking every half hour. Remove promptly when dry.\nThese peptides can now be used directly for MS analysis, by diluting to desired concentration with 0.1% FA in 2% LC-MS-grade acetonitrile (e.g., 50 μl), but we recommend performing peptide quantification (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0005]) to provide guidance on how much sample to load onto the MS. Alternatively, if additional depth of coverage is needed, peptides can be further fractionated using Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0006].\nStarting from 50 mg human heart tissue, the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001] will typically yield sufficient peptide quantity for 30-40 injections of 1 μg peptide per injection onto a nanospray LC-MS system, with >4000 unique proteins identified per injection (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/162733cd-fa4c-42ff-8bc3-189544d5fb88/cpz185-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nSample data for Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001].

    "This protocol outlines the steps required to prepare low- to moderate-complexity samples for MS analysis, and describes how to (1) solubilize proteins from RP-HPLC fractions or affinity purification fractions, (2) prepare lyophilized protein samples, and (3) prepare a protein sample from cultured and counted cells. Then, steps to reduce disulfide bonds, alkylate free cysteines, and digest the protein enzymatically are presented (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-fig-0004]). At the end of Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0002], the user should proceed to Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0003] for sample cleanup. Subsequently, Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0006] can be optionally used to fractionate peptides based on their hydrophobicity in cases where enhanced sequence coverage of lower-abundance peptides is required.

First, protein quantity is determined; then disulfide bonds are reduced and free thiols are alkylated. Proteins are digested enzymatically, contaminants are removed, and solvents are evaporated before peptide quantification.\nThis protocol is suitable for processing a wide range of sample types, including purified proteins in lyophilized form, RP-HPLC and affinity chromatography fractions containing protein(s) of interest, and whole or fractionated lysates of cells. See Strategic Planning for important notes, but in general 1-2500 μg protein is the suggested starting amount.\nNOTE: Use only HPLC- and/or LC-MS-grade solvents throughout the protocol.

    "1a. To prepare a sample from an RP-HPLC or affinity purification fraction: Dry the sample containing the proteins of interest via vacuum centrifugation. The evaporation should be performed at room temperature to avoid degradation of the sample; the amount of time required will be dependent on the volume and organic content of the sample. Resuspend dried protein in 100 µl of 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, with rigorous vortexing for 30 s. Spot an aliquot of the solution (1 µl) on narrow-range pH paper. Adjust pH to 8.0 with glacial acetic acid or 1 N sodium hydroxide as necessary.\nThe volume used for resuspension depends on the amount of protein in the original sample. Generally, a solution of 2 µg/µl works well for protein quantification and digestion. A volume of 100 µl would be appropriate for an unknown amount, but further dilution may be necessary depending on solubility (Strategic Planning).\nThe NH4HCO3 solution should be prepared fresh, as its pH will increase over time at room temperature. It is possible to store the NH4HCO3 solution for several days at 4°C, but the pH should be checked before use. The pH also makes it prone to bacterial growth, which can contaminate samples.\n1b. To prepare a lyophilized protein sample: Resuspend dried protein (50-1000 µg; see note on concentration above) in 100 µl of 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, with rigorous vortexing for 30 s. Spot a 1-µl aliquot of the solution on narrow-range pH paper. Adjust pH to 8.0 with acetic acid or 1 N sodium hydroxide as necessary.\n1c. To prepare a protein sample from cultured and counted cells:",
    "Count cells and add a minimum of 1 million cells and a maximum of 20 million cells to each 1.5-ml tube (e.g., a minimum of 1 million cells in 250 µl and a maximum of 20 million cells in 800 µl).\nCollect cells by centrifugation (5 min at 300 × g, room temperature).\nAspirate and discard supernatant.\nAdd 1 ml of 1× PBS.

Wait 1 min, and repeat the cycle two more times if ≥5 million cells are digested. Keep on ice afterwards.",
    "These parameters are suitable for the Hielscher UP200St block sonicator. Optimize the power levels according to your sonicator. Although a probe sonicator may be used, this increases the chance for cross-contamination, as the probe is reused and requires careful cleaning between uses. The block sonicator used here enables samples in a closed tube to be processed without cross-contamination.\n2. Perform protein quantification (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0004]).\nDetermining the amount of protein in the sample will inform the amount of enzyme to use in later steps. This information can also be used to normalize among samples intended for quantitative analyses. As stated in Strategic Planning, for sample-limited cases, it is advisable to at least have an estimate of the total amount of protein based on a similar sample type, when possible. If, based on a representative sample, the amount of protein in the experimental sample is <10 µg, it will not be possible to perform protein quantification without using a majority of the sample for this step. However, if sufficient protein is indeed available, protein quantification is strongly advised.\nReduce disulfide bonds and alkylate free cysteine residues\n3. Reduce disulfides by adding 100 mM TCEP to the sample from step 1 (to 5 mM TCEP final).\nAlthough reduction and alkylation (steps 3-5) are not required before enzymatic or chemical cleavage of proteins that do not contain cysteines, these steps will typically provide enhanced protein sequence coverage of most proteins as they help unfold the protein and maintain it in an open configuration, thereby facilitating cleavage.\n4. Cap tubes, and place samples in a mixing incubator at 37°C for 30 min.\nThroughout this protocol, agitation can be achieved with end-over-end rotation or vortexing.",
    "5. Alkylate cysteines by adding 400 mM acrylamide (to 40 mM final). Cap tubes, and place samples in a mixing incubator for 30 min at 37°C.\nDigest protein\n6. Add appropriate amount of trypsin/LysC or other digestion enzyme (e.g., chymotrypsin, trypsin, LysC, or AspN) or chemical (e.g., cyanogen bromide/70% formic acid) based on total amount of protein present. This will vary among enzymes. If using trypsin, add sufficient enzyme for a final trypsin:protein ratio between 1:20 and 1:100 (w/w).\nThe amount of trypsin needed will vary depending on the amount of protein in the sample. Although longer digestion times may lead to higher sequence coverage, they will also result in increased loss of some peptides, which can affect quantification. Shorter digestion times can benefit workflow speed but may result in lower sequence coverage.\nMany commercial vendors provide proteomics-grade trypsin in convenient aliquots (e.g., 1- to 25-μg vials; such as Promega cat. no. V5083), which eliminate the need to weigh out the enzyme. To minimize trypsin autolysis, which will add extra peaks to the MS spectra, use the minimum amount of trypsin. Typically, a ratio of 1:20 (w/w) is sufficient for complete digestion of 10 μg protein within 4 hr (e.g., 0.5 μg of enzyme). If protein concentration is especially high (e.g., 2500 μg) or the accessibility of trypsin to the cleavage sites is hampered (e.g., due to insolubility), it may be helpful to add another aliquot of trypsin, perform a short digestion (4 hr) with LysC before the addition of trypsin, or use combination enzymes such as the trypsin/LysC recommended here.\nThe activity of trypsin is enhanced in the presence of acetonitrile (10%-50% v/v), and thus acetonitrile may be added to aid protein solubilization during tryptic digestion (Waas et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-bib-0015]).",
    "7. Use 1 µl of the sample to test the pH using a narrow-range pH paper. As trypsin activity is greatest at pH 8.0, adjust pH to 8.0 with acetic acid or 1 N sodium hydroxide as necessary.\n8. Vortex briefly, cap tube, seal tube with Parafilm, and incubate in a mixing incubator at 37°C for 4-17 hr.\n9. Proceed to Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0005] for peptide quantification, which will be used to then inform sample cleanup (Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0003]), before MS analysis. Alternatively, if additional depth of coverage is needed, peptides can be further fractionated using Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0006].",
    "Detergents and salts are common ingredients in sample preparation buffers. Polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol, PEG) resulting from the manufacturing process of laboratory consumables (e.g., tubes, filters) can also contaminate proteomics samples. Detergents, polymers, and salts will interfere with chromatographic separation and ionization of peptides and must therefore be removed from the samples before MS analysis. Although reverse-phase methods using filter cartridges or tips are popular for peptide desalting, they are not capable of removing detergents or PEG. The recently described SP2 method uses carboxylate-modified paramagnetic particles to remove detergents, PEG, and salts from peptide samples (Waas, Pereckas, Jones Lipinski, Ashwood, & Gundry, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-bib-0016]).

    "23. Remove microcentrifuge tube from magnetic rack and add 500 µl of 100% acetonitrile to cover the particles completely.\nAt this step, particles may remain stuck on the side of the tube, so ensure the acetonitrile wash covers the surface area of the particles.\n24.

    "Protein quantification is an important step in many bottom-up proteomics workflows (including those described here), as it provides information on how much enzyme to use for optimal digestion efficiency and which size (binding capacity) of S-Trap™ column to use. Several strategies are available for the determination of protein concentration (e.g., Bradford, bicinchoninic acid assay, NanoDrop™, and Qubit™), but they vary according to interferences allowed (e.g., SDS, Tween® 20, Triton), sensitivity, and dynamic range. This protocol describes how to perform protein quantification using the Pierce™ 660 nm Protein Assay, which is suitable for a range of proteomics applications and can be used to quantify samples that contain detergents such as SDS; hence, it is compatible with workflows that require this detergent for enhancing protein solubilization (such as the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001]).\nThe assay requires standards: the Pierce Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Set, which contains standardized BSA solutions at a specific concentration, from 125 to 2000 µg/ml in 0.9% saline and 0.05% sodium azide, along with two additional standards, of 62.5 and 31.25 µg/ml, which you will need to prepare (see steps 2 and 3 below).\nMaterials\nSample from Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0002], step 2, or Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001], step 4\nPurified water (18 MΩ)\nPierce™ 660 nm Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, cat. no. 22662), containing:\n               \nPierce™ 660 nm Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, cat. no. 22660)\nPre-diluted Protein Assay Standards\nIonic Detergent Compatibility Reagent (IDCR, Pierce, cat. no. 22663; if using Pierce™ 660 nm Protein Assay kit for S-Trap™ samples, the ionic detergent compatibility reagent is necessary for consistent readings.\n1.5-ml low-retention microcentrifuge tube\n96-well clear flat-bottom plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 12-565-501)\nMultichannel pipet\n25-ml reservoir\nSpectrophotometer (e.g., Varioskan LUX Multimode Microplate Reader)\nPrepare sample",

If using peptides from Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0002] that were cleaned with Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0003], dry them in a 1.5-ml low-retention microcentrifuge tube for 1-2 hr using a vacuum centrifuge set at room temperature. Check every 30 min and remove promptly once dry. If using dried peptides from the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001], proceed to step 9.\n9. Dissolve all of the peptide sample in 300 µl of 0.1% TFA solution.\nThe maximum amount of peptide that can be loaded onto the high-pH fractionation column is 100 µg. If following Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001] and Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0002] as described above, the total amount of peptide in the resulting samples will be <100 µg; therefore, the entire sample can be loaded onto the fractionation column. If using other than the recommended starting material or amounts described for the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0001] and Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0002], perform peptide quantification after Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0005] and use a maximum of 100 µg for this step.\n10. Place the spin column into a fresh 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n11. Add the 300 µl of sample solution from step 9 into the top of the column, cap, and centrifuge 2 min at 3000 × g. Retain eluate as “flowthrough” fraction for troubleshooting only.\nAs with most loading and washing steps, it is necessary to retain flowthrough solutions in case peptides were not retained on the packing material. If there are no peptides in the samples, this solution can be tested during troubleshooting.\n12. Place the column into a fresh 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n13. Add 300 µl LC-MS-grade water into the top of the column, cap, and centrifuge 1 min at 3000 × g. Retain wash for troubleshooting only.",
    "As with most loading and washing steps, it is necessary to retain flowthrough solutions in case peptides were not retained on the packing material. If there are no peptides in the samples, this solution can be tested during troubleshooting.\n14. Place the column into a fresh 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tube labeled “Fraction 1.”\n15. Add 300 µl of the appropriate elution solution described in step 1 (e.g., 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% TEA) and centrifuge for 2 min at 3000 × g to collect the fraction. Retain eluate as “fraction #1”.\nThe first elution solution is fraction #1. A total of ten elution solutions (prepared according to the table in step 1) will be added to the same column in ten steps.\n16. Repeat steps 14 and 15 for the remaining step gradient fractions using the appropriate elution solutions and a fresh microcentrifuge tube each time (i.e., elution solutions for fractions #2-#10).\n17. Evaporate eluted peptides in a 2.0-ml low-retention microcentrifuge tube using a vacuum centrifuge set at room temperature for 1-2 hr. promptly once dry. The resulting peptide samples can then be used for MS analysis.\nStarting with 50 µg of peptides resulting from applying Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0002] to human ventricle heart tissue, the high-pH fractionation method in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-prot-0006] will typically yield sufficient peptide quantity for three injections of 1 μg peptide per injection per fraction onto a nanospray LC-MS system. In total, >7000 unique protein identifications per set of fractions can typically be made (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.85#cpz185-fig-0008]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/54baab25-f807-4398-a741-f13e0f30ea79/cpz185-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8",
