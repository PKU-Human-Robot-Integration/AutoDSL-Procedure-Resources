    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials and equipment used in this protocol.\n1. Culturing and cryopreservation of Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells\nRemove the WJ-MSCs (from ATCC) from the -80 °C freezer. Seed the cells into a flask containing DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Incubate them at 37 °C in an incubator containing 5% CO2.\nChange the culture medium every 2 days. Passage the cells when they reach 80% confluence. Wash the cells to be passaged with 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: Washing with PBS before adding trypsin ensures easy separation of cells from the flask surface.\nRemove the PBS and add 5 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution to the flask. Incubate the flask for 5 min at 37 °C in an incubator containing 5% CO2.\nCollect the supernatant into the tube and centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 5 min. After centrifugation, remove the supernatant and add 1 mL of DMEM-F12 + 10% FBS to the tube by pipetting.\nTransfer the cells to a larger flask and continue the culture by adding DMEM-F12 + 10% FBS until sufficient exosomes are obtained35.\n\tNOTE: Cultured cells are frozen at a density of 1 million/mL with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -80 °C.\n2. Production of exosomes from Wharton's Jelly mesenchymal stem cells\nNOTE: Exosomes are isolated from cultured WJ-MSCs. Exosome isolation is performed when cells cover the flask surface and reach approximately 80% density.",
    "Remove the supernatant medium containing 10% FBS from the flask and wash the cells with 5 mL of PBS. Add serum-free DMEM-F12 medium to the cells after rinsing with PBS. Incubate flasks for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following incubation, collect the serum-free medium in the tube and store at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: In step 2.1, 180 mL of serum-free medium is collected and stored at -20 °C.

Carefully withdraw the supernatant and transfer it to another tube.\nTransfer the collected supernatant to ultracentrifuge tubes and ultracentrifuge at 110,000 × g for 130 min. Slowly remove the supernatant and add 1 mL of PBS to the pellet.\nVortex the pellet and ultracentrifuge at 110,000 × g for 70 min at +4 °C36​ (Figure 1). Slowly remove the supernatant and add 1 mL of PBS to the pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: After the ultracentrifugation steps are completed, the exosomes obtained can be stored at -80 °C.

    "NOTE: Nanoparticle tracking analysis is performed to determine the size and concentration of the isolated exosomes. Tablets used for 1x PBS solution must be in the range of pH 7.3-7.5. 1x PBS Solution contains 10 mM phosphate buffer, 137 mM sodium chloride, and 2.7 mM potassium chloride.

Take the diluted suspension into a disposable syringe.\nTurn on the NTA device and connect the computer. Open the software.\nInject the sample in the syringe into the tubing in the cassette section of the device. Close the cassette cover of the device.\nIn the software that opens, click on the Start Analysis button. Save the results obtained by pressing the Record button.\nDynamic light scattering analysis\n\tNOTE: Exosomes isolated for zeta potential and size measurement are also diluted in the same manner as for NTA analysis.\n\t\nAdd 980 µL of PBS to 20 µL of the exosomes.\nOpen the zeta sizing device and the connected computer.

Dopamine loading into exosomes\nNOTE: After the characterization of WJ-MSCs exosomes is completed, dopamine-loaded exosomes were obtained as a drug delivery system. Drug loading into exosomes is performed using the incubation method.",
    "Add 3 mL of PBS to the exosome suspension from step 2.2.5. Sterilize the diluted suspension by filtration using 0.22 µm filters. Transfer 500 µL of the sterilized exosome suspension to another tube.\nPrepare dopamine solution (0.5 mg/mL) with distilled water. Add 500 µL of dopamine solution into the tubes containing the exosomes.\nAdd saponin to the suspension in step 4.2. Incubate the prepared exosome-dopamine suspension for 24 h at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Saponin concentration should not exceed 0.002% of the total solution.\nUltracentrifuge the suspension at 90,000 × g for 70 min to remove free dopamine and saponin from the medium.
