    "C57BL/6J mice were handled according to guidelines of the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Experimental procedures were designed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (CICUAL) of the Faculty of Chemical Sciences, National University of Córdoba (Res. HCD 1216/18).\n1. Preparation of buffer solutions and reagents\nPreparation of 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS): Add 8 g of sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.2 g of potassium chloride (KCl), 14.4 g of disodium-hydrogen-phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4 2H2O) and 0.24 g of potassium-dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) to 800 mL of distilled water. Stir the solution until complete dissolution of the salts. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with chloride acid (HCl) and adjust the volume to 1 L with additional distilled water. Filter the solution and store it at 4 °C.\nPreparation of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA): Add 40 g of solid PFA to 800 mL of freshly prepared PBS. Stir the solution in a heating plate at a constant temperature of 60 °C. Add 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until PFA is completely dissolved, checking that the pH is maintained at a range of 7.2-7.4. Top up the volume to 1,000 mL with PBS and mix. Turn off the heating plate and filter the solution when its temperature is under 35 °C. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to 3 days.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is harmful if swallowed or if inhaled and is probably a mutagenic compound. Use gloves and face mask during the whole process and work in a safety cabin.",
    "Preparation of 1x Tris-buffered saline (TBS): Add 6.1 g of Tris and 9 g of NaCl to 800 mL of distilled water. Stir the solution until complete dissolution of the salts. Adjust pH to 7.4 with HCl and adjust the volume to 1 L with additional distilled water. Filter the solution and store it at 4 °C.\nPreparation of TBS- 0.1% Triton X-100: Add 0.1 mL of TritonX-100 to 100 mL of TBS. Mix gently and store it at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\n\tNOTE: As Triton is a very dense detergent, slightly cut the terminal of the tip for better pipetting.\nPreparation of TBS-5%-Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) -0.1% Triton-X-100: Weigh 5 g of BSA and add TBS- 0.1% triton X-100 solution up to a final volume of 100 mL. Stir gently. Aliquot and store at -20 °C for up to 2 months.\nIsolectin GSA-IB4 Alexa fluor-488 conjugate (Isolectin GSA-IB4): Weight 36.75 mg of calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2·2H2O) and add it to 500 mL of freshly prepared PBS. Stir the solution with a stir bar. Pipette 500 µL of the solution of CaCl2/PBS and add it to the vial containing 500 µg of lyophilized Isolectin GSA-IB4 powder. Mix gently and aliquot the solution in 0.5 mL tubes. Store them at -20 °C protected from light.\nPoly(vinyl alcohol) in glycerol/Tris: Weigh 2.4 g of Poly(vinyl alcohol), add 6 g of glycerol and stir gently. Then, add 6 mL of water and continue stirring for several hours at room temperature. Add 12 mL of pre-warmed 0.2 M Tris solution (pH: 8.5) and heat at a constant temperature of 50 °C for 10 min and mix occasionally. Finally, centrifuge the solution at 5,000 x g for 15 min for clarification.",
    "​NOTE: Let the solution cool at room temperature, aliquot it and store it at -20 °C.\n2. Fluorescent lectin staining\nUpon mice sacrifice by carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation, enucleate the eyes with scissors16. Fix the enucleated eyes with freshly prepared 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature (RT).\n\tNOTE: Fixation can also be performed by incubating the eyes in 4% PFA overnight (ON) at 4 °C. Mice were sacrificed according to the guidelines of the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (CICUAL) of the Faculty of Chemical Sciences, National University of Córdoba (Res. HCD 1216/18).\nUnder the dissecting microscope, remove the corneas with scissors by cutting along the limbus and dissect the whole retinas. Discard the anterior segment of the eye, and then separate the retina from the RPE-Choroid.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to remove the remaining debris and hyaloid vessels out of the retina with forceps.\nPlace the retinas in 200 µL tubes. Then, block and permeabilize the retinas in 100 µL of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution containing 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton-X-100 during 6 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation in the shaker.\n\tNOTE: This step can be performed for 2 h at RT.\nThen, invert the tube to place the retina in the cap and remove the blocking solution with a pipette.\nAdd 100 µL of the solution containing 0.01 µg/µL of Isolectin GSA-IB4 (GSA-IB4). Wrap the tubes with aluminum foil to protect the samples from light. Incubate the retinas with the lectin solution ON at 4 °C or for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation in the shaker.",
    "Wash the retina with 100 µL of TBS containing 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 20 min with gentle agitation in the shaker. For proper washing, place the retina in the cap of the tube by inverting it. Return the tube to its standing position and remove the medium remaining in the container. Repeat this step three times.\nPlace the retina in a slide and add a drop of PBS. Under the dissecting microscope, perform four equally distant cuts from the edges of the retina toward the optic nerve.\nTo unfold the petals of the retina, use forceps or small pieces of filter paper. Ensure that the photoreceptor side is facing down.\nRemove the remaining PBS of the slide with filter paper. Then, add a mounting medium (Poly(vinyl alcohol) in glycerol/Tris) and coverslip. Let it dry for 1 h at RT.\nStore slides at 4 °C protected from light.\n\t​NOTE: Retinas can also be stored in PBS at 4 °C until confocal microscopy visualization.\n3. Confocal microscopy visualization and microphotograph acquisition\nBefore visualization, incubate the slides for 10 min at RT covered from light.\nAt the confocal microscope, place the slide in the plate face down.\nFocus the superior plexus of the retinal vasculature and select an area to start the image acquisition.\nSet general laser parameters in the software: Wavelength: 488 nm; Laser intensity; HV; Offset; Gain.\n\tNOTE: Laser intensity, PMT, Offset, and gain may vary depending on the conditions and the usage of the lamp. The optimal settings provide a clear image of the vessels avoiding the saturation in the sensitivity of the photomultiplier tube to have a linear relationship with the fluorescence signal.\nSet other acquisition parameters: Mode; Size; Objective, without zoom; No Kalman; Step Size.\n\tNOTE: Identical acquisition conditions must be used for imaging the control and experimental samples.",
    "Set the coordinates in x and y axis: Scan the retina in focus 2x. If the area shows vessels, select it by clicking twice the area in order to mark it for later image acquisition.\n\tNOTE: It is highly recommendable to select retinal area by following the superior vascular plexus as the fluorescence of bigger vessels is higher.\nMove in the grid to a neighbor square, focus the retina, and select the area if it corresponds. Repeat this step until the selected area comprises the whole retina.\nSelect one area and set the coordinates in z axis to define the thickness extent to scan. To do this, visualize the retina in focus 2x; with the micrometer, go to the top of the retina and click on Set at the Start position. Then, move to the bottom of the retina and click on Set at the End position.\nRepeat step 3.8 at every area selected in the grid.\n\tNOTE: To verify the scanned area in depth, press Go at the Start position. If vessels are still visualized, readjust the position by moving the micrometer, and then click on Set. Repeat the process at the End position.\nInitialize automated scanning.\nOnce the scanning process finishes, open the image.\nSelect the Series format to record the image as a Mosaic and save it with the preferred extension. Finally, the stitched image will be shown on the screen.\n4. Image processing\nIn the ImageJ FIJI software, go to the Menu Bar and click on File > Open. Select the image to process. In the Bio-Formats Import Options window, select the Display OME-XML metadata and click on OK.\n\tNOTE: Images with similar name should be saved in separate folders.",
    "In the OME Metadata window, search for the pixel size information, named as PhysicalSizeX, PhysicalSizeY, and PhysicalSizeZ. Copy this data.\nFor image calibration, go to the Menu Bar and select Image > Properties. Copy the information of the image in step 4.2 and click on OK. The image opens as a window with several photos, where each one represents the microphotographs acquired at a z axis.\nAssign a preferred lut to the image in order to consign a color to the fluorescent label. To do that, go to the Menu Bar and click on the LUT icon.\nTo visualize all stacks in a single image, go to the Menu Bar and select Image > Stacks > Z Project.\nIn the Z Projection window displayed, select all the stacks where vessels are visualized. In Projection Type, choose Average Intensity and click on OK.\n\tNOTE: The result of the sum of the stacks will be shown in a new image named AVG (image name).\nAdjust the brightness and contrast in the resulting image to reduce the background and highlight vessels. Go to the Menu Bar and click on Image> Adjust> Brightness/Contrast. In the B and C windows move the bars until a better intensity is observed. Click on Apply and save the changes.\nCopy the parameters selected for Brightness/Contrast; these must be identical for all images.\nPrior to image quantification, define the parameters that are going to be measured. In the Menu Bar, go to Analyze > Set Measurements. In the procedures described here, it will be necessary to obtain Area and Perimeter (this is ultimately also needed to measure distances). Click on OK.\nDownload the plugin required for vessel density quantification17 and follow the installations instructions provided by the plugin.\nContinue with the quantification of a specific vascular parameter.",
    "5. Quantification of avascular areas\nIn the Menu Bar, choose the Wand Tool. Select the retinal area that lacks vessels.\n\tNOTE: Bigger or smaller areas can be selected depending on the tolerance. To adjust the tolerance, click on the wand tool icon twice. Mode employed: Legacy.\nPress the T letter on the keyboard to record the selected area in the ROI Manager. Repeat steps 5.1 and 5.2 with all the avascular areas of the retina.\nClick on Measure in the ROI manager to obtain the avascular area information. The program will display a new window with the information required. Copy the data in another program or save the file.\n\tNOTE: In some images, one may prefer to select the avascular areas manually. In this case, choose the Polygon Selection tool, draw short distances around the avascular area, and click on the image when a new distance is about to start. Close the selected area by clicking on the first point.\nRepeat steps 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 to measure the total area of the retina.\nCalculate the avascular area of the retina as the sum of all the avascular areas measured divided by the total area of the retina.\n6. Quantification of neovascular areas\nIn the Menu Bar, choose the Wand tool.\nZoom in the image to better visualize neovessels. Select the neovessels one by one with the wand tool.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the tolerance no higher than 20 to ensure the selection of a single neovessel. This tolerance level must remain constant during all image quantifications.\nPress the T letter on the keyboard to record the selected area in the ROI Manager. Repeat steps 6.1 and 6.2 with all neovascular areas of the retina.",
    "Click on Measure in the ROI manager to obtain the area data. The program will display a new window with the information required. Copy the data in another program or save the file.\nRepeat steps 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 to quantify the total area of the retina.\nCalculate the neovascular area of the retina as the sum of all the neovessels' areas measured divided by the total area of the retina.\n7. Quantification of vessel diameter\nIn the Menu Bar, select the Straight-Line Tool.\nZoom in the image to better visualize the vessel wall. Perform three transversal lines to the main vessel before the first branch. This must be done by drawing a line from the boundary of one wall of the vessel to the opposite.\n\tNOTE: The line must be perfectly perpendicular to the wall vessel to avoid quantification errors.\nPress the T letter on the keyboard to record the selected area in the ROI Manager. Repeat steps 7.1 and 7.2 in all the vessels that need to be quantified.\nClick on Measure in the ROI manager to obtain the distance data. The program will display a new window with the information required. Copy the data in another program or save the file.\n8. Quantification of vessel tortuosity\nIn the Menu Bar, click on the Straight-Line Tool icon with the right button of the mouse and select Segmented Line or Freehand Line. Draw a line inside the vessel from the optic nerve until the first vessel ramification following the vascular shape.\n\tNOTE: The line must follow the vascular shape to avoid quantification errors.\nPress the T letter on the keyboard to record the selected area in the ROI Manager.\nIn the Menu Bar, select the Straight-Line Tool. Draw a line from the optic nerve until the first vessel ramification.",
    "Press the T letter on the keyboard to record the selected area in the ROI Manager.\nClick on Measure in the ROI Manager to obtain the distances data. The program will display a new window with the information required. Copy the data in another program or save the file.\nCalculate the tortuosity index as follows: distance obtained with Segmented line divided by the distance obtained with Straight line.\n9. Quantification of vascular branching\nWith the Oval Tool of the Menu Bar, define an area applied equally to all experimental conditions. The selected area must be a concentric circle drawn around the optic nerve.\nPress the T letter on the keyboard to record the selected area in the ROI Manager.\n\tNOTE: In this case, it is recommendable to save the ROI as the quantification is slow and the identical ROI must be used in all images. To do this, in the ROI Manager click on MORE > Save.\nManually, count the number of primary branches arising from main vessels inside the selection area.\nRepeat steps 9.2 and 9.3 in neighbor areas, maintaining the optic nerve-periphery criteria.\n10. Quantification of vascular density\nTransform the image to 8-bit mode.\nGo to Plugins in the Menu Bar, select Vessel Analysis > Vascular Density.\nDefine an area with the Square tool of the Menu Bar, where the vessel density needs to be measured. Click on OK.\nThe program will display a new window with the information required. Copy the data in another program or save the file.\nRepeat steps 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 in the neighboring areas, maintaining the ROI but placing it nine times encompassing the periphery and the center of the whole retina.\nSubscription Required.
