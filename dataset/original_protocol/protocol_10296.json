    "NOTE: The following steps for the 3D LCE foam-like preparation using the 3-arm star block copolymer are shown in Figure 1. For nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization, the spectra are recorded in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) at room temperature on a Bruker DMX 400-MHz instrument and internally referenced residual peaks at 7.26. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are recorded using a Bruker Vector 33 FT-IR spectrometer using attenuated total reflectance mode. For each step of the following protocol, it is important to wear appropriate personal protective clothing (PPE).\n1. Synthesis of α-Chloro-ε-caprolactone (Monomer) (According to the Procedure in Jérôme et al.28)\nBefore beginning the synthesis, purify 27 g of 3-chloroperbenzoic acid as follows:\n\t\nIn 800 mL of distilled water, add 1.28 g of sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and 8.24 g of sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate. Adjust the pH to 7.4 (using sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid) and reserve 30 mL of this solution; this is the buffer solution.\nUsing a separatory funnel, dissolve 3-chloroperbenzoic acid in 35 mL of diethyl ether. Wash the organic solution with 10 mL of buffer solution (prepared in step 1.1.1.). Repeat the wash three times.\nAdd 3 g of sodium sulfate directly to the organic solution; this drying agent absorbs water from the organic solution.\nFilter the solution to remove the drying agent. Concentrate the filtrate under reduced pressure by using a rotary evaporator at 850 mbar and 40 °C.\nSolubilize 18.5 g of purified 3-chloroperbenzoic acid in 150 mL of dry dichloromethane by stirring in an ultrasonic bath; this process typically takes 20 min. Place the solution inside a separatory funnel.\nInside a two-neck, round-bottom flask, dissolve 13.1 g of 2-chlorocyclohexanone in 15 mL of dry dichloromethane using a magnetic stirrer under nitrogen gas. Keep stirring.",
    "Fit the separatory funnel containing 3-chloroperbenzoic acid solution (from step 1.2) to the two-neck flask in step 1.3. Flush the system with nitrogen gas. Adjust the opening of the separatory funnel so that the chloroperbenzoic acid solution falls dropwise into the 2-chlorocyclohexanone solution (1 drop every other second) and continue stirring the mixture under nitrogen gas for 96 h.\nCool the reaction mixture to -20 °C for 1 h to precipitate the m-chlorobenzoic acid (m-CBA) byproduct.\nFilter the m-chlorobenzoic acid (m-CBA) and wash the remaining solution with saturated solutions of sodium thiosulfate, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium chloride.\nRemove the solvent under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator at 850 mbar and 40 °C. Purify the pale yellow, viscous liquid by distillation under reduced pressure at 2.3 Torr and 96 °C.\nMonitor the success of the synthesis using the following 1H NMR peaks. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ[ppm]): 4.75-4.68 (m, 1H, CHClCO), 4.37-4.26 (m, 1H, CH2O), 4.18-4.05 (m, 1H, CH2O), and 2.06-1.58 (m, 6H, −CH2−)6,27.\n2. Synthesis of α-Three-arm Star Block Copolymer (SBC-αCl) by Ring Opening Copolymerization (Sharma et al.6 and Amsden et al.29)\nBefore synthesis, silanize a 20-mL ampoule by filling it with a 2% (v/v) solution of 1H,1H, 2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane in toluene and stirring for about 24 h. Rinse with isopropyl alcohol and dry it by placing it in an oven at 140 °C for 30 min.\nAdd 3.64 g of distilled ε-caprolactone, 0.5 g of α-chloro-ε-caprolactone, and 0.25 mL of glycerol to the ampoule. Mix using a vortex for 1 min.",
    "Add 4.90 g of D,L-lactide to the ampoule and purge it with nitrogen. Place the ampoule in an oven at 120 °C to melt the D,L-lactide; this process typically takes about 2 h. Mix again using a vortex to make sure that all contents are well mixed and add 66 µL of tin(II)2-ethylhexanoate (Sn(Oct)2) to the ampoule.\n\tNOTE: D,L-lactide will cool down during this process and will need to be re-heated in the oven to melt.\nVigorously mix one last time using the vortex and flush with nitrogen.\nClose the ampoule with a rubber stopper. Place a needle connected to a vacuum tube (the house vacuum is usually enough) through the rubber stopper. Turn on the vacuum and, using a flame, melt the long neck of the glass, twisting slowly until the glass collapses on itself. Be careful to not melt the rubber stopper. Once the ampoule is flame-sealed, place it in a sand bath, an oven, or appropriate heating element at 140 °C for 48 h.\nTake out the ampoule and let it cool at room temperature.\nBreak the ampoule at the sealed mark and dissolve the highly viscous liquid by adding 10 mL of dichloromethane. Transfer the solution to a separatory funnel.\nPrepare a flask containing 100 mL of cold methanol (chilled using a dry ice/acetone bath at a temperature around -78 °C). Fix the separatory funnel (step 2.7) on top of the flask. Adjust the opening of the separatory funnel so that about two drops fall every other second (dropwise).\nCollect the white precipitate by filtration (using a paper filter) and dry it in a vacuum oven between 50 and 60 °C.",

Cool to 0 °C using an ice bath.\nIn another round-bottom flask, mix 8.28 g of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 10.3 g of cholesterol, and 0.2 g of 4-dimethylaminopyridine.\nTransfer the 5-hexynoic acid solution dropwise to the flask containing the cholesterol mixture and maintain the final mixture at 0 °C for 1 h.\nAllow the mixture to warm up to room temperature overnight.\nRemove the resulting dicyclohexylurea precipitate by filtration using a grade 415 paper filter and discard it.\nConcentrate the filtrate under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator at 850 mbar and 40 °C.
