    "1. Preparation of reagent\nPrepare the complete medium by adding 90 mL of DMEM high sugar medium, 10 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1 mL of penicillin-streptomycin solution in a 125 mL sterile culture flask. Mix the complete medium, and store at 4 °C under closed conditions.\nPrepare CoCl2 solution by adding 0.02 g of CoCl2 powder (accurately weighed) in 10 mL of DMEM sugar-free medium (dissolved completely) to obtain a 8.4 mM stock solution. Filter the solution with a 0.22 µm bacterial filter, seal it, and store it at 4 °C away from light.\n\tNOTE: CoCl2 is unstable and should be stored in an airtight container, protected from light; the validity period of the CoCl2 solution is 7 days.\nPrepare Tris-Hcl buffered salt solution (TBST).\n\t\nAccurately weigh 8 g of sodium chloride, 0.2 g of potassium chloride, and 3 g of Tris-base. Add them into a 1 L beaker, and then add 1,000 mL of RO water to dissolve the mixture.\nAdjust the pH to 7.4, add 1 mL of Tween 20, and thoroughly mix to obtain the TBST solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Tween 20 acts as a surfactant to reduce the nonspecific binding of antibodies to antigens and works best at 0.1% concentration.\nPrepare MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide salt) solution by weighing 0.1 g of MTT powder in 20 mL of PBS solution to obtain a 5 mg/mL stock solution. Filter the solution with a 0.22 µm bacterial filter, seal it, and store it at 4 °C away from light, placed on standby.\n\tNOTE: MTT powder is unstable and easily absorbs moisture, so it should be stored in a closed and dry place away from light. The MTT solution expires after 7 days. MTT has a carcinogenic effect, so avoid direct contact with the skin.",
    "Prepare the Eri capsule solution by removing the capsule shell and accurately weighing 0.18 g of the content in 10 mL of DMEM sugar-free medium to prepare a 100 µM stock solution (based on the concentration of scutellarin). Filter the solution with a 0.2 µm bacterial filter, seal it, and store it in an airtight container at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Scutellarin is the main active ingredient in Erigeron breviscapus. The concentration of scutellarin in the capsules has been determined by HPLC-UV to be 2.56 mg/g, i.e., 5.54 µmol/g8. The concentration of the preparation is calculated based on the scutellarin concentration. This is convenient for evaluating the pharmacological activity of the preparation and the component.\nPrepare the solution of the Ast injection by adding 5 mL of injection and 5 mL of sugar-free DMEM media in a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube to prepare a 60 µM stock solution (based on the concentration of astragaloside A). Filter the solution through a 0.2 µm bacterial filter, and store it in an airtight container at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The volume of injection is 10 mL each, and the concentration of astragaloside A in the injection has been determined by HPLC-ELSD to be 0.094 mg/mL (i.e., 120 µM)9. The preparation should be carried out in a biosafety cabinet and operated in a light-proof manner throughout. The volume of the injection solution and sugar-free medium should be measured accurately and mixed well.\nPrepare astragaloside A solution by accurately weighing 7.85 mg of astragaloside A standard and dissolving it completely in 2 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare a 5,000 µM stock solution. Filter it with a 0.22 µm bacterial filter and store it airtight at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Astragaloside A powder is insoluble in the sugar-free medium. When preparing the solution, dissolve it with the appropriate amount of DMSO to keep the final experimental concentration of DMSO below 0.1% to ensure no cytotoxicity.\nPrepare the scutellarin solution by weighing 11.56 mg of scutellarin standard accurately and completely dissolving it with 5 mL of sugar-free DMEM medium to prepare a 5,000 µM stock solution. Filter it with a 0.22 µm bacterial filter and store it airtight at 4 ˚C.\nPrepare the chlorogenic acid solution by weighing 8.86 mg of chlorogenic acid standard accurately and completely dissolving it with 5 mL of sugar-free DMEM medium to prepare a 5,000 µM stock solution. Filter it with a 0.22 µm bacterial filter and store it airtight at 4 ˚C.\n\t​NOTE: Chlorogenic acid powder is unstable and easily absorbs water. It should be sealed and stored at 4 °C away from light; the exposure time should be minimized during weighing.\n2. Cell viability assay\nObtain PC12 cells and culture them in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the cells are obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. PC12 cells are adherent cells that have the general characteristics of neuroendocrine cells and are widely used in neurophysiology and neuropharmacology.\nCulture the cells at 37 °C in an incubator supplemented with 5% CO2 and sub-culture them every 2-3 days. Use cells at passages 4-8 for all experiments.\nCell culture\n\t\nTreat PC12 cells in the logarithmic growth phase (70%-80% cell confluency) with 1 mL of trypsin (0.25%) and observe the cells under a microscope. When the cells become round, stop the trypsin digestion by adding 3 mL of the complete medium.",
    "Transfer the cells to a sterile 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge the cells at 840 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant, resuspend with the complete medium, and transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Then count the number of cells using a flow cytometer.\n\t\t\nStart the flow cytometry software, select the corresponding dilution multiple of the cell solution in the counting setting, and click on Density Chart after loading the cell sample from the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCircle the cell population away from the X-axis and Y-axis, right-click the data table below the figure, and select X, Y, Count, and Abs Count. The data under Abs Count in the data table gives the cell counting result.\nAdjust the cell concentration to 1 x 105 cells/mL, inoculate 100 µL/well in 96-well plates, and culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubator for 24 h.\nScreening of safe concentrations of two drugs on normal PC12 cells\n\t\nCulture the cells as described in steps 2.1-2.2. Discard the supernatant, and treat the normal cells with different final concentrations of Ast injection (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 µM) and Eri capsule (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 µM). Treat six replicate wells of each group for 24 h.",
    "NOTE: The drugs are added to the media to achieve the final concentration of the drug (mentioned in step 2.4.1), and then an equal volume of media is added to each well. When aspirating the supernatant, the pipette tip should be placed gently against the well wall to avoid contacting the cells at the bottom of the well. When adding different solutions, add them gently and quickly along the edges of the wells, and pay attention when changing the pipette gun head to avoid affecting the experimental results.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 120 µL of MTT solution (1 mg/mL) to each well, and incubate the cells for 4 h at 37 °C.\nAfter the incubation, discard the supernatant again and add 150 µL of DMSO to each well. Shake the plate for 10 min at a speed of 240 times/min (number of horizontal vibrations per minute) using a vortex oscillator.\nMeasure the absorbance of each sample at 490 nm by using a microplate reader. Calculate the cell viability (%), which is the absorbance of the treated group/absorbance of normal the group (control) x 100.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the MTT solution is within the validity period; if the color has changed (to dark green), it cannot be used. When testing the absorbance of cells, a blank well (culture medium and MTT, without cells or drugs) should be set to eliminate the interference of other reagents. A volume of 150 µL of DMSO is added to each well and shaken for 10 min to dissolve the blue-purple crystals better. The absorbance should be detected as soon as possible to ensure the accuracy of the results.\nScreening of effective concentrations of two drugs on injured PC12 cells",
    "Culture the cells for 24 h as mentioned in steps 2.1-2.2, discard the supernatant, and then treat the cells with 20 µL/well of CoCl2 (0.4 mM) combined with the sugar-free medium.\nSimultaneously treat the cells with 100 µL/well of Ast injection (final concentrations are 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12 µM) or 100 µL of Eri capsule (final concentrations are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 µM) at 37 °C for another 24 h. Add 120 µL/well of complete medium to the control group.\n\t\tNOTE: CoCl2 induces hypoxic conditions in the cells.\nMeasure the absorbance of each sample by the MTT method and calculate the cell viability as described previously in steps 2.4.2 and 2.4.3.\nScreening of the optimal combination of two drugs based on the homogeneous design method\n\tNOTE: After obtaining the effective concentration range of the Astragalus injection and breviscapus capsule, the uniform design method U7 (74) table was used to obtain six different combinations of the two drugs. Ast injection:Eri capsule: 1) 2:2.6 µM, 2) 4:5 µM, 3) 6:1.8 µM, 4) 8:4.2 µM, 5) 10:1 µM, and 6)12:3.4 µM.\n\t\nCulture the cells as described above in step 2.3.1, and treat the injured PC12 cells with six proportion concentrations of Ast injection:Eri capsule as mentioned above.\nTreat the cells for 24 h and calculate the cell viability as described previously in steps 2.4.2 and 2.4.3.\nEvaluation of the protective effect of two optimal combinations on injured PC12 cells\n\tNOTE: After obtaining the optimal preparation combination (Ast injection:Eri capsule of 6:1.8 µM) and the optimal component combination7 (10 µM astragaloside A, 40 µM scutellarin, and 75 µM chlorogenic acid), further evaluation is performed to check their protective effects on injured PC12 cells.",
    "Culture the cells as described above in step 2.3.1, and treat the injured PC12 cells with the two types of combinations of drugs as discussed in the NOTE above.\nTreat the cells for 24 h and calculate the cell viability as described previously in steps 2.4.2 and 2.4.3.\n3. Annexin V-FITC/PI assay for apoptosis rate\nSeed the PC12 cells in a 12-well plate at a concentration of 1.3 x 105 cells/well and culture them at 37 °C for 24 h.\nGroup the cells: control group, model group, and two combinations of drugs. Add 1.2 mL/well of complete medium to the control group, add 1.2 mL/well of media containing 0.4 mM CoCl2 to the model group, and add 1.2 mL/well of each of the two combinations containing 0.4 mM CoCl2. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for another 24 h.\nFollowing drug treatment, treat the cells with 250 µL/well of trypsin, transfer the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 840 xg for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of the binding buffer.\n\t\nIncubate the cells in the dark with 5 µL of Annexin V-FITC and 10 µL of propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at RT, and then check for apoptosis by flow cytometry. Set three replicate wells in each group.\n\t\tNOTE: The trypsin used in this test cannot contain EDTA because EDTA is a metal ion chelating agent that competes with annexin V to bind calcium ions and affects the affinity of annexin for PI. When apoptosis occurs, phosphoserine, originally on the inner side of the cell membrane, turns outward to the cell surface, and Annexin V-FITC selectively binds to phosphoserine outside the membrane to show green fluorescence.",
    "Click Automatic Compensation in the Start menu, select FITC, PE, PerCP, and APC in the Select channel, and select Compensation at: Height. Click OK in the Statistical Item: Median. With the same cell counting method mentioned in step 2.3.2, collect the cell samples, click the Density Map, and circle the effective cell population.\nWith FITC fluorescence as the X-axis parameter, and other fluorescence parameters as the Y-axis parameter, create a density map. Click on Compensation Matrix in the Start menu and Coefficient in the overflow matrix. The density map information is displayed for the analysis of the apoptosis rate.\n4. Immunofluorescence detection of caspase-3 generation\nSeed the PC12 cells onto coverslips at a density of 8 x 104 cells/coverslip and place them into 24-well plates at 37 °C for 24 h. Group the cells as mentioned above in step 3.2; set up three replicate coverslips for each group.\nFollowing drug treatment, rinse the coverslips twice with PBS (37 °C) for 5 min each, fix them with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilize with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT.\nRinse the cells again and block them with 10% goat serum for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate each coverslip with 200 µL of primary antibody caspase-3 (a key executive protein of apoptosis) diluted at a concentration of 1:250 in 1x TBST, overnight at 4 °C. Wash with 1x TBST (three times for 3 min each), and incubate with 200 µL of secondary antibody (1:300 dilution in 1x TBST) for 1 h at RT in the dark.\n\tNOTE: The fluorescence is easily quenched; thus, after incubation of the secondary antibody, the slides should be kept away from light. The primary and secondary antibodies should be stored at 4 °C away from light.",
    "Add 300 µL of DAPI (0.5 µg/mL) to the coverslips (to detect the nuclei) for 10 min and wash the cells three times with 1x TBST for 5 min each.\nObserve the coverslips under the fluorescence microscope and capture images10. Perform statistical analysis of the fluorescence intensity using the imaging software.\n\t​NOTE: The slides and coverslips used should be clean and sterile. When staining, pay attention to the pH, concentration, and temperature of the dyeing solution, and avoid fluorescence quenching. The fluorescent microscope should be turned on at least 15 min in advance to preheat the mercury lamp and turned off for 30 min before being turned on again. When acquiring images, the exposure parameters of the same dye in the same batch of experiments should be consistent to ensure the accuracy of the results.\n5. Immunofluorescence assay of ROS level\nCulture and treat the cells as discussed in step 4.1.\nFollowing drug treatment, wash each coverslip three times with PBS for 3 min, and incubate with 400 µL of DCFH-DA (10 µM) at 37 °C for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: DCFH-DA is a universal indicator of oxidative stress. It has cell membrane permeability and no fluorescence. Once it enters the cell, it is hydrolyzed by esterase to produce 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) and then rapidly oxidized to produce a strong fluorescent product.\nWash the cells again with serum-free DMEM (twice for 3 min each) and immediately observe the coverslip after adding the fluorescence quenching agent under the fluorescence microscope. Calculate the relative fluorescence intensity by the imaging software.\n\t​NOTE: After loading the DCFH-DA probe, be sure to clean the residual probe that does not enter the cell, otherwise the background will become high.\n6. Western blot detection of protein expression of Nrf2, p-Akt, Akt, Bcl-2, and Bax11,12",
    "Inoculate PC12 cells in 6-well plates at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/well and culture at 37 °C for 24 h. Group and treat the cells as aforementioned in step 4.1, and set three replicate wells in each group.\nAfter drug treatment for 24 h, wash the cells three times with PBS for 5 min each and incubate on ice for 30 min in prepared lysis buffer. Following lysis, centrifuge the cells for 20 min at 16,000 x g and 4 °C and collect the supernatants.\nDetect the protein concentration and adjust according to the instructions through the Bradford assay. Dilute the samples and denature at 100 °C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: The lysis buffer is composed of phosphatase inhibitor, protease inhibitor, and RIPA lysate in a volume ratio of 1:1:50. In the control group, 200 µL/well of lysis buffer is required, and 100 µL/well of lysis buffer is required in the other groups. Generally, the protein concentrations of control, model, and two types of combinations groups are 0.45 mg/mL, 0.25 mg/mL, and 0.32-0.39 mg/mL respectively; their protein concentrations after dilution with the loading buffer are 0.36, 0.2, and 0.256-0.312 mg/mL, respectively.\nTo detect proteins with different molecular weights, load 25 µg of protein in each lane, run a 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and transfer the gel to PVDF membranes.\n\tNOTE: During the preparation of SDS gel, it must be fully mixed without bubbles or insoluble particles; otherwise, uneven or irregular bands may occur. When transferring the membranes, ensure there are no bubbles between the PVDF membrane and the gel; otherwise, white spots will appear in the strip. In addition, this step must be performed at low temperatures, and the ice bag should be changed every 30 min.",
    "Block the membranes with 5% nonfat milk for 1.5 h at RT and incubate with 5 mL of the corresponding primary antibodies (Nrf2 1:1,000, Akt 1:2,000, p-Akt 1:2,000, Bcl-2 1:5,000, and Bax 1:1,000) for 24 h at 4 °C. Use β-actin (1:5,000) antibody as an internal control.\nWash the membranes with TBST (three times for 10 min each), then incubate with 5 mL of secondary HPR-conjugated antibodies (1:5,000) at RT for 2 h.\n\tNOTE: The dilution ratio of the antibodies should not be arbitrarily changed, and the membranes should be washed with TBST sufficiently in strict accordance with the requirements to avoid the background color of the band being too black.\nFinally, wash the membrane with TBST again, and treat it with chemiluminescent HRP substrate (as per the manufacturer's instructions) for protein band detection. Capture the images using the chemiluminescence imaging system and quantify the gray values of the proteins using the imaging software, with β-actin as the comparative internal control.\nSubscription Required.
