    "Planning ahead The pellets of bacterial culture expressing GST-MTV1 and GST can be prepared any time in advance, as this material can be stored at -80 °C for several weeks. The plant extract is preferentially prepared on the day of the actual pulldown experiment. To generate this plant material, calculate a total of 8-10 days (from seed sterilization to harvest). The pulldown experiment can be carried out in one day.    Protein expression in bacteria   From single bacterial colonies (or verified glycerol stocks) of GST-MTV1 (bait) and GST (negative control) expressing bacteria, grow overnight cultures in 10 ml LB with appropriate antibiotic selection (in this case, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin). Use 50 ml Falcon type tubes and grow cultures in a shaking incubator at 37 °C with agitation of at least 200 rpm. Tubes should not be fully closed to allow gas exchange.   Next day, prepare two Erlenmeyer flasks (500 ml volume) each with 150 ml LB + 100 μg/ml carbenicilin and add the MTV1-GST and GST pre-culture, respectively. Grow at 25 °C on an orbital shaker at least at 200 rpm, until OD600 reaches 0.6. Growing at 25 °C helps to produce the proteins in soluble form.   To induce the expression of GST-MTV1 and GST, add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM and continue to grow the cultures at 25 °C for another 3-4 h.   Distribute each culture into three 50 ml tubes and centrifuge them at 4 °C at 3,000 x g for 5 min.    Discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet in ice cold PBS, then centrifuge again as above.    Discard the supernatant and store the pellets at -80 °C. Pellets can be stored for several weeks. For one pulldown experiment, only one of the pellets (corresponding to 50 ml of bacterial culture) is used.",
    "Extract protein from bacteria   Take one pellet of GST-MTV1 and GST (corresponding to 50 ml bacterial culture) and resuspend each in 2.5 ml ice cold extraction buffer.   Use a sonicator to disrupt the bacterial cells until they are lysed, which is indicated by reduced opacity and increased viscosity. This has to be carried out on ice, and it is recommended to sonicate in intervals (e.g. 10 sec sonicating followed by 10 sec on ice and so on). Care has to be taken not to sonicate with too high intensity. If foaming or the formation of a white precipitate is detected, the intensity needs to be lowered.    Transfer the lysed bacteria solution to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C, 16,000 x g for 20 min.      Reconstitute glutathione beads   In the meantime, reconstitute the glutathione agarose beads. For each GST-MTV1 and GST, weigh 10 mg of the dry beads and add 2 ml washing buffer. Let the beads swell for 10 min while vortexing occasionally.    Load the slurries onto two Poly-Prep columns, place them upright in an appropriate holder and let the buffer drain through the bottom opening by gravity.  Note: Do not centrifuge or apply vacuum to increase flow rate! This applies to all subsequent washing steps.   Then wash the column with 10 ml washing buffer, again letting the column drain by gravity.      Protein binding to glutathione beads Of the centrifuged bacterial lysates, take 150 µl of the supernatant and mix with 75 µl sample loading buffer, boil for 5 min and store at -20 °C, this will serve later as a control to check protein expression and integrity after bacterial lysis, for instance by immunoblot analysis using anti-GST antibody. The rest of the supernatant is loaded onto the columns, one for GST-MTV1 and one for GST.",
    "If viscosity of the lysate seems high, 1-2 ml of extraction buffer can be added. Close column in- and outlets and place them onto a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 2 h. Let the lysate drain by gravity, then wash the columns 3 times with 10 ml washing buffer at 4 °C.    Plant extract   Blot the liquid grown Arabidopsis seedlings dry, using paper towels. Weigh 0.7 g and transfer to a mortar.    Freeze with liquid nitrogen and grind to a fine powder with a pestle.    Add 4 ml extraction buffer and let slowly thaw, grinding the sample even more.    Transfer the sample to 1.5 ml microfuge tubes and centrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C at 16,000 x g.   Pass supernatant through a 0.20 µm filter syringe and keep extract on ice. Per column, 1 ml extract will be needed.      Pulldown   Close column outlets.   Per column, mix 1 ml extract with 1 ml extraction buffer and add it onto the washed column.    Close column inlets and place them onto a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 1.5 h.    Then open the column in- and outlets and collect the flowthrough.    Mix 150 µl of the flowthrough of each column with 75 µl sample loading buffer and boil for 5 min, keep at -20 °C. These samples are the flowthrough, containing all the unbound plant proteins (and usually some bacterial proteins as well).   Wash the columns 3 times with 10 ml washing buffer at 4 °C, again letting drain by gravity.   The bead volume is now about 100 µl. Close the column outlet and re-suspend the beads in 200 µl washing buffer.    Take 150 µl of the bead slurry and add 75 µl sample loading buffer.",
    "Boil the sample for 5 min, mix vigorously and centrifuge for 5 min at 16,000 x g.    Pass the supernatant to a fresh tube and store at -20 °C. These samples are the eluates which contain the proteins that bound to GST-MTV1 or GST, respectively, plus the bait proteins themselves.   Typically, the flowthrough and the eluate samples are loaded next to each other on a immunoblot for both GST and GST-MTV1 (see Figure 1). It is often advisable to correct for different protein amounts in flowthrough and eluate, a good starting point is to load 5 µl flowthrough and 20 µl eluate, but this has to be determined empirically.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140610/20140610083427_6113.jpg Figure 1. Typical result of an immunoblot usig anti-clathrin heavy chain (CHC) antibody (approx. 190 kDA). In the flowthrough (FT) of both GST and GST-MTV1 the protein is detected, indicating that CHC was present at equal levels during the incubation. After washing, only the eluate (EL) of GST-MTV1 produces a signal, indicating that CHC bound specifically to MTV1. In this blot, 5 µl of FT sample and 20 µl of EL sample were loaded to compensate for different protein levels.    A protein which binds specifically to GST-MTV1 will be detected in both flowthrough samples, but only in the eluate sample of GST-MTV1. This is for example the case for clathrin heavy chain (CHC), which can be detected using a commercial anti-CHC antibody (see Figure 1).   A protein which is detected in both eluate samples is binding unspecifically to either the GST tag or the glutathione-agarose matrix. In this case, it can help to increase duration and number of washing steps or use a different washing buffer with higher amounts of salts or detergents from step G 6 onwards."
