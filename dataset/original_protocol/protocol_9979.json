    "1. Design\nIdentify an application for the devices and list the channel/chamber components that will be required.\n\tNOTE: All devices will require input and output channels. Devices used for microscopy will require an imaging chamber. More complex devices will require channels and chambers situated in multiple layers.\nStart by hand-drawing each layer, considering how the device’s functionality is affected by the superposition of the layers.\nDraw the final designs on a computer using any software that allows for drawing lines and shapes.\n\t\nDraw each layer separately using black, solid lines and shapes devoid of shades. Line thickness of 6 or more points are recommended. At this stage, the dimensions of channel and chamber features are less important than the overall proportions.\nUse the copy-and-paste function when creating features and superimposing layers. See Figure 1B for examples of layer drawings.\nImport each layer into the craft cutter software (Figure 1C). Do this by making a screen capture of the drawn design and using a drag and drop approach.\n\t\nCreate a new document in the craft cutter software (free download). Drop the image file on the mat displayed. The software will recognize most image files.\nEnlarge the image to facilitate processing by pulling from a corner. The design can now be recognized by the software using the trace function.\n\t\tNOTE: Users may produce de novo designs directly on this software (use drawing tools in design palette).\nTo trace the design, select the Trace icon (shape of a butterfly) on the right side of the window and completely select the imported designs.\n\t\nSelect the Trace Preview option labeled outline. Adjust (if needed) the Threshold and Scale settings to adjust the yellow trace to match the design.",
    "Select Trace from the Trace menu once the yellow trace matches the design. The channels are now shown as a red contour. If the red contour matches the design, the imported image can be selected and deleted. The design is now imported and ready for sizing.\nSize the device by selecting the traced design and by using the grid provided by the software. Pull to change the width and length of channels and chambers.\n\tNOTE: The software provides measurements, and small lines can be drawn temporarily (use design palette on the left side of the window) to measure dimensions within the device. Functional channel-width dimensions range from 100 µm to 900 µm. Dimensions may have to be adjusted after testing initial prototypes. It is important that all layers are sized proportionally, to ensure proper alignment during assembly.\n\t\nAfter the design is properly sized, select the square tool on the shape drawing menu to draw a square/rectangle around each layer of the device. This shape should be of the same size for all layers. See Figure 1C for examples.\nCreate a separate top layer containing access ports to the channels. Simple designs will consist of a main (middle) channel layer, a bottom sealing layer (often glass) and a top layer that should contain circular perforations to access the channels (inlets/outlets).\n\tNOTE: Designs containing more than three layers will require inlet/outlet perforations in multiple layers (See Figure 1C, Figure 5A). These perforations may be already included in the design, or can be added at this time.\n\t\nSelect the drawing tool on the left side of the screen. Draw circles over the inlet and outlet ports of the design.\nCopy and paste both the original design and the circles. Erase the channels from the underlying device.",
    "NOTE: This leaves the inlet/outlet ports in the right position corresponding to the original design. Shapes may also be added to the periphery of each layer to aid with aligning.\nArrange all layers to be cut on the displayed mat. The device is now ready for cutting.\n2. Cutting\nApply a single PET/EVA film (or other material) of preferred thickness (3 mil is standard) onto the adhesive cutting mat. Make sure the adhesive (matte) side faces up and the plastic (shiny) side faces down.\n\tNOTE: Use clean gloves to avoid introducing oils and microparticles to the layers.\nFlatten the film against the mat (Figure 1D), removing all air that may have been trapped. This can be done using gloved hands or a roller.\nAlign the edge of the cutting mat to the line indicated on the cutter. Load the mat by pressing Load Mat on the cutter. Keep the setting on the cutting blade between 3 and 5, depending on the film thickness.\nConnect the cutter USB cable to the computer.\n\t\nSelect the SEND tab and select a cutting setting.\n\t\tNOTE: A multitude of settings are available on the cascade menu. The -Sticker Paper, Clear- is a setting that works well with PET/EVA film that has a thickness of 3–5 mil (75–125 μm). Modify settings for different materials and save custom settings for future use.\nClick Send. Cutting will begin (Figure 1E). Make sure there is enough room in the back of the cutter for the mat to move unimpeded. When the cutter is finished, unload the mat by selecting Unload on the cutter. Do not pull the mat out before unloading.\n3. Alignment",
    "Place the cutting mat next to a clean surface. With gloved hands, use a pair of tweezers to lift each layer of the microfluidics device off the cut mat (Figure 1F). Be especially careful around turns and bends in the channel; these are especially delicate and susceptible to tearing and warping.\nPlace the layers of the microfluidics device onto a clean surface. Order them according to their top-to-bottom position in the device (Figure 1G, Figure 2A, Figure 5A and Figure 7A).\nCut small (~3 mm x 10 mm) pieces of double-sided tape that will be used to temporarily attach the layers together.\nSuperimpose the layers one by one, starting with the bottom layer. Add a small piece of double-sided tape to a corner between the layers, away from any channels or inlets/outlets (Figure 1G, arrow). The tape, although not required, immobilizes the layers and assures they will not shift during lamination. Use a wire jig to facilitate the alignment of layers in devices with more than 4 layers (Supplementary Figure 3).\nEnsure that the adhesive (matte-EVA) side of the film always faces the inside (within-layers portion) of the device.\n\tCAUTION: Exposed adhesive will melt against the internal parts of the laminator and adhere to them, resulting not only in the loss of the device but also affecting the future performance of the laminator.\nOnce all layers have been superimposed, inspect the device. There should be at least one EVA side in between all layers, and no EVA should be exposed. When introducing non-EVA coated materials (e.g., polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film, glass), a film coated with EVA on both sides might be needed, particularly in the case of more complex devices (Figure 5).\n4. Lamination",
    "Turn on and set the laminator to the desired thickness setting. Some laminators offer 3 and 5 mil settings, while some do not. For any device with 4 or more layers, use the 5-mil setting.\nOnce the laminator is ready, run the device through the laminating rollers (Figure 1H–I). Place the end to which double sided tape has been added for best results.\n\tNOTE: When fabricating devices of five or more layers, they may be run through the laminator more than once.\nRecover the laminated device.\n\tNOTE: It is advisable for devices to be large enough as to make easy their recovery from the laminator. This consideration does not affect the size of the channels or chip architecture, it simply calls for a “frame” that can easily go through the laminator without remaining inside.\n5. Inlet/outlet ports\nUse a rotary tool and a 1/32 in. drill bit to cut a small hole through the center of a furniture bumper. Alternatively, use a 1 mm biopsy punch to perforate the bumpers.\n\tNOTE: A drill press is recommended. Although sizes vary, 2 mm x 6 mm-diameter bumpers are recommended. Avoid simply “stabbing” the bumper. Unless material is removed, the bumper will seal again (Supplementary Figure 1). The perforations as indicated above are meant to interface with polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tubing, a pipette and tip, or a blunt needle (16–18 G). Larger perforations can be achieved using revolving punch pliers (Supplementary Figure 1). These are useful when the bumper is used as a “reservoir” for liquids or other biologicals.\nMake sure that the orifice is completely clear by removing any debris (caused by drilling or punching) with a pair of small tweezers.",
    "After the inlet/outlet ports are successfully cleared, carefully align the bumpers with the inlet/outlet ports on the laminated device (Figure 1J–K). This step is essential to having proper flow of liquids in and out of the device. Hold the bumper behind the device, position the adhesive face facing the open inlet/outlet on the device, then align and adhere. Device assembly is now completed.\n6. Testing\nAccess the channel/chamber architectures through the perforated bumpers (ports). There are several options regarding how to introduce fluids and biologicals into the devices.\nUse laboratory or medical/surgical tubing by attaching it to a plastic connector (e.g., Luer adaptors) or to a blunt needle. A standard pipette and tip or PEEK tubing without adaptors can also be used (Supplementary Figure 2).\nPerform infusion or drawing of fluids with syringes and tubing using syringes or peristaltic pumps.\n\tNOTE: There are many options in the market, starting at ~300 USD at the time of writing.\nSet different flow rate settings according to the device and experiment.\n\tNOTE: We routinely use flow rate settings in the range of 0.01–100 µL/min, but other rates can be used.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60307/60307fig01.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Fabrication. (A) An office laminator and a craft cutter are the only two pieces of equipment required for fabrication. Both are available online or at crafts/office supplies stores. Other required tools include scissors and tweezers. (B) Channel and chamber architectures can be composed digitally using any software program that includes drawing tools (vector graphics may be preferred by some users, but are not required). Lines and shapes are drawn in black with a white background. The file or a screen capture of the design can be imported into the craft cutter software by dragging and dropping. (C) Craft cutter software is available free to download and is required to control the cutter. The software acquires the design and allows for modifications, like sizing. It also provides drawing tools. (D) The cutting mat carries the film for cutting. It is slightly adhesive, allowing for immobilization of the materials to be cut. The figure shows four different materials ready for loading: 3 mil-thick PET/EVA film (top), 5 mil-thick PET/EVA film (middle), 6 mil-thick EVA/PET/EVA (bottom left) and PVC film (bottom right). (E) Cutter is open to display blade (in black) unit and loaded mat. (F) After cutting, individual layers are lifted using tweezers. Cut outs of channels and chambers remain attached to the mat and are later removed and discarded. (G) Individual layers are aligned and superimposed for lamination. Small pieces of double-sided tape (arrow) are often used to aid in aligning and prevent layer shifting during lamination. (H, I) The device is fed at the top of the laminator and recovered through the slot. Lamination provides a robust seal, leaving channel paths open. (J, K) In order to access the channels, it is necessary to add perforated, self-adhesive vinyl bumpers.",
