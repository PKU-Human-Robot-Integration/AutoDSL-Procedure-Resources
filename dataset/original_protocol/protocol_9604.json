    "Figure 1 summarizes the following protocol sections.\n1. Establishing the 3D stromal monoculture\nPrepare the hBM-MSC cell suspension.\n\t\nGrow hBM-MSCs to a confluence level of 70%-90% in MEMα supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 5 ng/mL FGF-2 in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The cells may be used up to passage 6.\nWash the cells with PBS, and detach them using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 3-5 min at 37 °C. Stop the detachment process by flushing with basal medium (MEMα supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin). Collect the suspended cells in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nCount the cells using a hematocytometer or an automated cell counter, and determine the total number of cells in the suspension.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 200 x g for 5 min. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in an appropriate volume of basal medium to achieve a concentration of 1 x 107 cells/mL of stock solution.\nPrepare 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes containing the required volume of basal medium supplemented with the respective growth factors (FGF-2 and BMP-2 at defined concentrations, e.g., 0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, or 200 ng/mL). Per well, 200 µL is required. If cell seeding is to be performed using an automated liquid handler, also consider the dead volume of the instrument. For manual cell seeding, a volume excess of 10% is sufficient.\nAdd the hBM-MSCs from the stock solution at a dilution of 1:66.67 to achieve a concentration of 1.5 x 105 cells/mL.\nPrepare the plate for seeding.\n\t\nRemove the polypropylene adhesive film covering the 96-well hydrogel plate.\nCarefully aspirate the storage buffer covering the hydrogels. For this task, use a microplate washer; however, manual handling is possible.",
    "When using a manual aspirator or multichannel pipette, position the tip against the wall of the well, and slowly move down toward the edge of the inner well while aspirating the buffer. This will avoid damaging the hydrogel surface.\nWhen using an automated plate washer, set the aspiration nozzles at least 3.8 mm from the plate carrier (this corresponds to 0.8 mm from the inner ring of the hydrogel plate) and toward the edge of the well. Refer to the manufacturer's manual for more detailed instructions and to obtain the plate drawings of the 96-well hydrogel plate.\nAdd 200 µL/well of the cell suspension prepared in step 1.1.7 after thoroughly mixing to ensure the cells are homogeneously distributed. During seeding, to avoid uneven sedimentation of the cells in one region of the substrate, do not tilt the plate. For manual seeding, periodically mix the cell suspension (after seeding three wells) to keep the mixture homogeneous. For automated seeding, mix with a serological pipet immediately before dispensing in order to dispense volumes containing equal numbers of cells.\nMaintain the cultures at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.\nMonitor the development of the cultures by bright-field microscopy with a 5x objective as desired. Acquire reference images approximately 30 min after seeding to evaluate the number of cells added.\n2. Establishing the 3D stromal-endothelial cell co-culture\nPrepare the GFP-HUVEC cell suspension.\n\t\nPrepare flasks for the HUVEC culture by coating with a solution consisting of 150 µg/mL rat-tail collagen I in 0.02 M acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. Rinse once with PBS before use.",
    "Grow the GFP-HUVECs to a confluence level of 80%-100% in EGM-2 supplemented with 10% FBS in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The cells may be used up to passage 7.\nWash the cells with PBS, and detach them using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 2-3 min at 37 °C. Stop the detachment process by flushing with basal medium (MEMα supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin). Collect the suspended cells in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nCount the cells using a hematocytometer or an automated cell counter, and determine the total number of cells present in the suspension.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 200 x g for 5 min. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in an appropriate volume of basal medium to achieve a concentration of 1 x 107 cells/mL of stock solution.\nPrepare 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes containing the required volume of basal medium supplemented with the respective growth factors (FGF-2 and BMP-2 at defined concentrations, e.g., 0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, or 200 ng/mL) as described for the hBM-MSCs in step 1.1.6.\nAdd the GFP-HUVECs from the stock solution at a dilution of 1:66.67 to achieve a concentration of 1.5 x 105 cells/mL, as described for the hBM-MSCs in step 1.1.7.\nAspirate the medium from the plate containing the stromal monoculture, as described for the buffer removal in step 1.2.2.\nAdd 200 µL/well of the GFP-HUVEC cell suspension prepared in step 2.1.8 as described for the hBM-MSC addition in step 1.3.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Change the medium every 3-4 days.",
    "Monitor the development of the culture by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy using a 5x objective as desired. Maintain the cultures until day 4 or day 7 of co-culture for early or intermediate characterizations, respectively, or as desired.\n3. Characterization procedure 1: Quantifying endothelial cell network formation\nAt the desired time points, acquire the GFP signal from the GFP-HUVECs with fluorescence microscopy using settings suitable for quantification (i.e., best focus, high contrast, and low magnification [e.g., 5x] for larger fields of view).\nPre-process equally all the images acquired on the same day (e.g., using Fiji32) to further enhance the contrast. Note that the GFP signal may become dimmer with culture time; therefore, images acquired on different days may need different processing.\n\t\nIf using Fiji or ImageJ, open all the GFP channel images of the same time point, and open the Brightness & Contrast menu. Select an image that represents an intermediate condition (not the dimmest and not the brightest signal), and auto-adjust the contrast by selecting Auto. Select Set, and check Propagate to all Other Open Images.\nVisually assess whether the range automatically selected fits all the images of the current time point, and manually re-adjust and re-propagate to all the images as needed.\nSave the adjusted images as TIF files, and repeat step 3.2.1 and step 3.2.2 for the other time points acquired.\nApply a median blur filter (e.g., radius 3 for 2048x2048 images) to all the images to avoid artifact recognition downstream and, thus, facilitate accurate network identification. Reduce the size by binning (2x2) and save all pre-processed images as grayscale RGB Color TIF files in a folder for quantification. These steps can be done manually or in batch mode using macros that the authors will share upon request.",
    "Analyze all the images in the folder created in steps 3.1-3.3 using the Batch Process mode in the Angiogenesis Analyzer for ImageJ33. Note that depending on the size of the images and available working memory, this may take a few minutes per image.\nValidate the quantification results by examining the overlays of the recognized structures and the original images. If the algorithm recognizes artificial structures, where only a few or no cells can be seen in the original image, adjust the pre-processing parameters, and re-analyze the original images, or exclude such problematic areas and/or replicate images from the analysis.\nNormalize the obtained values to an area of 1 mm2 by multiplying the values of each sample by the ratio of the analyzed area to 1 mm2. This step is of particular importance if images of different sizes are used.\nExtract various network parameters, such as the total network length, number of junctions, number of segments, number of isolated segments, branching interval, and mean mesh size, from the analysis, and use them to characterize the endothelial network at different time points and under different culture conditions.\n4. Characterization procedure 2: Assessing ECM deposition\nAt the desired end time points, assess ECM deposition using immunofluorescence. Add primary antibodies against various ECM molecules in 100 µL of the culture medium during the last 6 h of culture or after fixation, as described below.",
    "Wash the cultures once with 200 µL/well of PBS for 5 min at RT, and fix them with 100 µL/well of 4% paraformaldehyde under a chemical fume hood for 30 min at RT. Note that it is advised to fix all the wells of a plate at the same time, as the surrounding cultures may be damaged during this step. Wash the fixed cultures with 200 µL/well of PBS at RT three times for 5 min each time, and store at 4 °C in 200 µL/well of PBS, or proceed immediately to the next step.\nBefore incubating with primary antibodies against ECM molecules after fixation, incubate the fixed cultures with 200 µL/well of 1% BSA in PBS as a blocking solution for 30 min at RT.\n\t\t\nAspirate the blocking solution, and incubate with 100 µL/well of the primary antibody solution in 1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Wash with 200 µL/well of PBS three times for 5 min, at least 3 h, and 5 min, respectively, at RT.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The long washing step is required for the complete diffusion of the unbound antibody out of the hydrogel.\nTo facilitate the penetration of the secondary staining solution, including intracellular counterstains, permeabilize the cultures using 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in PBS for 30-90 min at RT, depending on the cellular density of the cultures.\n\t\tNOTE: For the antibody-based staining of intracellular molecules, this step should be performed before the incubation with the primary antibody described in step 4.1.2.\nPrepare secondary staining solutions containing the respective secondary antibodies and counterstains as desired (e.g., a nuclear stain such as DAPI and a cytoskeletal stain such as phalloidin-rhodamine).",
    "Prepare a staining buffer consisting of 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA in PBS, and counterstains (e.g., 1 µg/mL DAPI and 1:4,000 phalloidin-rhodamine), and add the respective secondary antibodies at the recommended dilutions.\nAdd 100 µL/well of secondary staining solution, and incubate overnight at 4 °C. Similar to the procedure after the primary antibody incubation, wash with 200 µL/well of PBS three times for 5 min, at least 3 h, and 5 min, respectively, at RT.\nFor the 3D resolving of the structures, acquire confocal stacks starting at the glass bottom with a z-step of 2.5 µm reaching a final height of 500 µm, use a 10x objective, and a 0.75x digital zoom. To generate a 3D reconstruction of the GFP and F-actin signal in Fiji, threshold each channel separately before creating a composite and generating the reconstruction using Fiji 3D Viewer.\nFor the visualization of the deposited ECM from the immunostainings, acquire confocal stacks of a height of 100 µm with a z-step of 5 µm, a 10x objective, and a 1.5x digital zoom. Generate maximum intensity projections, and adjust the brightness and contrast for each channel separately in Fiji before creating a composite.\nPerform direct color stainings of the extracellular environment.\n\t\nAdd 200 µL/well of Picrosirius Red staining solution to the paraformaldehyde-fixed wells, and incubate for 1 h at RT.\nNext, wash the stained wells five times with distilled water, followed by washing twice every day or every second day for 3-4 days while monitoring the sample color clearing. Keep the plates at 4 °C during the long washing steps (i.e., anything exceeding 6 h).",
    "Acquire images of the stained samples using a bright-field microscope equipped with a color camera, and maintain an equal white balance across the conditions. To acquire overviews of the samples, use a low magnification (e.g., 2.5x) to scan the entire well. If the microscope does not come with software supporting automated stitching, do it manually (e.g., using Pairwise Stitching in Fiji34).\n\t\tNOTE: The wells previously used for immunofluorescence can be used for this, provided that fluorescence image acquisition is completed.\nFollow the same steps described for Picrosirius Red staining in steps 4.2.1-4.2.3 to perform Alizarin Red staining, washing, and imaging.\n5. Characterization procedure 3: Assessing osteogenic differentiation by monitoring ALP activity\nAt different culture end time points (e.g., day 4 and day 7 of co-culture), quantitatively assess ALP activity by using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)/nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining.\n\t\nWash the cultures once with 200 µL/well of PBS before incubating with the BCIP/NBT substrate solution, which should be prepared following the manufacturer's instructions. Incubate at 37 °C while periodically monitoring color development. Once the color starts to develop in non-osteogenic conditions, immediately wash once with 200 µL/well of PBS before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde, as described in step 4.1.1.\nAcquire color images of the stained samples, as described in step 4.2.3 for Picrosirius Red staining.\nAt different culture end time points (e.g., day 4 and day 7 of co-culture), quantify the ALP activity in the cell lysates.\n\t\nWash the cultures three times with 200 µL/well of PBS before incubating with 200 µL/well of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C. Every 10 min, agitate the cultures by vigorously pipetting up and down to facilitate digestion, and monitor the culture morphology with a standard cell culture microscope.",
    "Once a liquid, single-cell suspension with no elongated cellular structures in the wells is obtained (typically after 20-30 min), transfer the samples to 2 mL tubes, add 200 µL of MSC basal medium to inhibit the Trypsin, and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min to pellet the retrieved cells. Decant the supernatant, and freeze the pellets at −80 °C, or proceed directly to step 5.2.3.\nThaw the cell pellets obtained in step 5.2.2, and incubate with 500 µL of lysis buffer consisting of 0.56 M 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 10, for 30 min on ice. Next, centrifuge at 16,100 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and keep the samples on ice. After the measurements described in step 5.2.7, freeze the samples at −20 °C or −80 °C, or directly continue with the DNA quantification, as described in step 5.2.8.\n\t\tNOTE: The lysis buffer can be prepared in advance, sterile-filtered, and stored at 4 °C.\nPrepare the ALP reagent consisting of 20 mM 4-Nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate and 4 mM MgCl2 in lysis buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: It is best to prepare this solution fresh on the day of quantification.\nWithout disturbing any pelleted debris, dispense 50 µL of the cell lysate supernatant prepared in step 5.2.3 into the wells of a standard, transparent, tissue-culture 96-well plate in duplicates. Add lysis buffer to two wells as blank controls.\nWith a multichannel pipette, add 50 µL/well of ALP reagent to the wells filled in step 5.2.5. Briefly shake the plate, and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min protected from light. Wells with higher ALP activity will appear yellow. Stop the reaction by adding 100 µL/well of 1 M NaOH using a multichannel pipette.",
    "Read the optical density at 410 nm using a plate reader. Average the technical duplicates, and subtract the average of the blank controls.\nPerform DNA quantification to normalize the ALP activity determined in the previous steps against the total cell number. Here, a method based on fluorescence measurements is described, but any other method for DNA quantification in cell lysates is compatible with the assay. Prepare the reagents and DNA standards required for DNA quantification using commercially available kits according to the manufacturers' instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use lysis buffer for preparing the DNA standards.\nIf the samples used for ALP quantification described in step 5.2.3 were frozen, thaw them, centrifuge at 16,100 x g for 2 min at 4 °C, and place them on ice. Without disturbing any pelletted debris, dispense 50 µL of the cell lysate supernatant into the wells of a black 96-well plate in duplicates. Freeze the samples at −20 °C or −80 °C, and repeat the ALP and DNA quantifications if necessary. Add the DNA standards in duplicates.\nWith a multichannel pipette, add 50 µL of the DNA staining agent, incubate, and read the fluorescence intensity as per manufacturer's instructions. Using the standard curve values, determine and apply the conversion of the measured intensity values to the DNA concentrations.\nNormalize the ALP values obtained in step 5.2.7 by dividing them by the respective DNA concentration of each sample.\n6. Application 1: Performing drug sensitivity assays\nWhen the endothelial networks are fully developed (typically at day 4 of the stromal-endothelial cell co-cultures), add anti-angiogenic compounds, such as bevacizumab, to the cultures in fresh culture medium, and test their activity over time and under different conditions (e.g., different concentrations of FGF-2 or BMP-2).",
    "Prepare fresh culture medium containing the same growth factors used for the respective cultures until that point.\n\t\t\nPrepare a control solution consisting of the diluent of the compound of interest (e.g., for bevacizumab: 60 mg/mL α-trehalose dihydrate, 0.4 mg/mL Tween20, 5.8 mg/mL sodium phosphate, monobasic and monohydrate, and 1.2 mg/mL sodium phosphate dibasic, anhydrous), and sterile-filter it.\nAdd the compound of interest at the desired concentration (e.g., 10 µg/mL bevacizumab) and an equal volume of the control solution to the culture medium designated for the test and control conditions, respectively.\nAspirate the medium from the culture, and add 200 µL/well of the medium freshly prepared in step 6.1.1. Incubate for a time appropriate for the compound to be tested (e.g., for bevacizumab: 2 days). Monitor the culture development, and characterize the endothelial networks as described in section 3. Assess the effectiveness of the compound in inhibiting angiogenesis or ablating the pre-formed structures using the GFP images and the quantitative network parameters extracted from the analysis described in step 3.7.\n7. Application 2: Establishing advanced co-culture systems with various cancer cell types\nAt day 4 of co-culture, when the endothelial networks are mostly established, add other cell types, such as MDA-MB-231 or U2OS cancer cells, to the cultures in fresh culture medium.\n\t\nLabel the cancer cells using a cell-compatible live dye as per the manufacturer's instructions in order to be able to distinguish them from the GFP-labeled HUVECs and non-labeled hBM-MSCs in the co-cultures.\nPrepare a suspension of cancer cells at a concentration of 1.5 x 104 cells/mL in fresh culture medium containing the same growth factors used for the respective cultures until that point.\nMonitor the culture development and cancer cell localization as desired.",
    "NOTE: Depending on cancer type, activity, and environment, it might take a few days for them to reach the vascular structures in the stromal-endothelial cell co-cultures (e.g., 2 days for MDA-BM-231 and U2OS). Therefore, the time-lapse imaging to visualize the cancer-vascular cell interactions should be timed accordingly."
