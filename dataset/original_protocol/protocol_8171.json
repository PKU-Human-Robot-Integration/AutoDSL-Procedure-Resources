  "procedures": [
    "1. Differentiation Period Prior to Replating\nDifferentiate neurons on 10 cm dishes, using a protocol of choice7,8 until neurons have formed a thick network with their processes and express not only early neuronal markers such as MAP2 or TuJ1, but also late markers such as NeuN.\nChange half the medium of choice every 4 days during the neuronal differentiation process.\n\tNOTE: More extensive or frequent medium changes dilute essential trophic factors, and could disfavor maturation.\n\t\nFor the iPSC-derived WT126 neurons, use the following post-differentiation culturing media: 5 mL 100x N2 supplement, 10 ng/mL BDNF, 10 ng/mL GDNF, 1 µg/mL laminin, 200 µM ascorbic acid, 1 µM dibutyryl-cAMP and 10 mL SM1 for 500 mL Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12). Gradually, using half-media changes, replace with neural basal medium (Table of Materials) and the same supplements.\nFor the iPSC-derived CVB WT neurons, use the following post-differentiation culturing medium: 500 mL neural basal A medium (Table of Materials) and 500 mL DMEM/F12 medium with 2 µg/mL laminin, 10 mL glutamine supplement (Table of Materials), 0.75 mg/mL sodium bicarbonate, 5 mL minimum essential medium (MEM) nonessential amino acids, 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 10 ng/mL BDNF, 20 mL 50x B27, and 10 mL 100x N2 supplement.\n2. Coating Multiwells\nThe day before replating, coat with poly-L-ornithine (PLO). Dissolve PLO in sterile water to make a stock solution (10 mg/mL). Store this stock at -20 °C. Dilute PLO 1:100 in water to yield a concentration of 50 µg/mL when coating glass and 1:1,000 ratio (10 µg/mL) when coating plastic.\nApply the coating directly to the target plates. Use the volume of coating appropriate to the plate size (i.e., for a 24-well plate apply 500 µL of PLO solution per well).\nAllow plates to sit in the dark overnight at room temperature.",
    "Retrieve coated plates on the day of replating and transfer to a sterile biosafety cabinet.\nAspirate the PLO solution and rinse twice with sterile water.\nDilute laminin (1.15 mg/mL) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 1:400 dilution.\nNOTE: Thaw laminin at 4 °C and quickly add to PBS to avoid aggregation of laminin and uneven coating.\nAspirate sterile water and apply 500 µL of laminin coating to wells previously coated with PLO.\nPlace plates in a 37 °C incubator for a minimum of 4-6 h. Use longer incubations, up to 16 h, for glass surfaces. Use consistent incubation times.\n3. Replating Differentiated Neurons\nRinse plate of differentiated neurons with PBS once gently. Disperse PBS gently down the wall of the plate, and not directly onto the cells, to avoid disrupting them.\nGently aspirate PBS, being careful to avoid touching the cells directly but to aspirate from the edge of the dish while tipping it towards the researcher.\nApply at minimum 1 mL of the proteolytic enzyme (Table of Materials) per 10 cm plate and return cells to incubator. Add slightly higher volumes if the tissue culture room exhibits a high evaporation rate due to low humidity.\nIncubate cells with proteolytic enzyme for 40-45 min in order to detach them from the plate and to detach them from other neurons within the neuronal network.",
    "NOTE: Timing at this step is critical. Quenching the protease too early can lead to increased cell death after replating. The proteolytic enzyme manufacturer recommends that temperatures much lower than 37 °C be used with longer incubation periods for passaging cell lines (e.g., overnight at 4 °C). However, handling neurons at 4 °C should be avoided, as they often show poor survival after cold exposure. The manufacturer also states that a 60 min incubation with the enzyme at 37 °C leads to its enzymatic inactivation. However, in authors' experience, a 40-45 min incubation of hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures at 37 °C is sufficient for efficient dissociation and excellent neuronal survival upon replating.\nCheck neurons on a phase-contrast microscope during the incubation time and allow protease treatment to continue until the neural network completely detaches from the plate and starts to break apart in smaller sheets upon briefly shaking the plate under the microscope.\nQuench the protease activity using 5 mL of fresh DMEM media per 1 mL of protease in the 10 cm plate to stop the digestion. Gently triturate cells against plate 5-8 times to disrupt network, using serological pipettes. Be careful not to apply too much pressure when triturating, as differentiated neurons are fragile. Do not use a P1000 tip, as the end is too sharp and narrow, and thus can sheer or damage the neurons.\nApply solution with cells through a cell strainer with 100 µm diameter mesh into a fresh 50 mL conical tube drop by drop.\nRinse strainer with an additional 5 mL of fresh DMEM media, after cells have filtered through.\nSpin cells in benchtop centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nReturn conical tube to the biosafety cabinet and aspirate most of the media, leaving around 250 µL to ensure cells retain moisture.",
    "Resuspend cells gently in 2 mL of fresh DMEM media. Do not pipette the pellet against the side of the tube. Instead, gently invert conical 2-3 times and pass cells through the end of a 5 mL serological pipet to dislodge them.\nApply 10 µL of resuspended neurons onto the edge of a hemocytometer.\nAdd 8-10 µL of trypan blue to droplet of cells to assess cell viability during this resuspension step. Apply 10 µL of this mixture to the hemocytometer or other automatic cell counters. Assess as viable those cells that are phase bright and exclude the trypan blue dye.\nDetermine amount of viable cells/mL, and prepare to dilute the contents of the conical tube according to the desired cell density.\nPlate ~10,000 cells per well for a 384-well plate; plate ~150,000-200,000 cells per well for a 24-well plate.\nAdd fresh DMEM to the conical tube of resuspended cells to achieve appropriate dilution and add additional appropriate supplements such as B27 and/or BDNF, depending on the requirements of the specific cell line.\nGently tilt conical tube to mix 2-3 times.\nAspirate laminin coating from the 24-well plate, or from the 384-well multiwell plate using a 16-channel pipet and rinse once with PBS.\nAspirate PBS using a P1000 for the 24-well plate, or the 16-channel pipette for 384-well plates.\nApply cell solution to each well in a figure eight motion to avoid clumping. Plating uniformity might also be optimized by using automated liquid handling devices.\nNOTE: The addition of laminin to the media starting 2-4 days post-replating also helps maintain a homogenous distribution of the cells.\nRepeat steps 3.19 and 3.20 for each well.\nReturn the plate to incubator set at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "After 2 days, start changing half the medium every 4 days using the post-differentiation culturing media described in section 1.2. After the desired maturation time, fix cultures using 3.7% formaldehyde at 37 °C and stain cells according to the experimental requirements.\n4. Cell Viability Assays Post-replating\nAdd the early cell death reporter (VivaFix: 0.5 µL of the 50 µL stock solution per 500 µL culture media per well) after briefly vortexing the stock solution.\nImage the live and dead cells cultured on glass-bottom multiwells, after 20 min, without any washing step, since the dye fluoresces only once inside the cells, or fix and co-stain with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and/or other antibodies before imaging using a confocal microscope.\n5. Immunostaining\nFix cultures with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS plus 120 mM sucrose for 20 min at 37 °C.\nRinse and permeabilize with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, and then block for 30 min with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA).\nAspirate the BSA without rinsing and incubate for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-MAP2 antibody 1:1,000, mouse anti-β3 tubulin (TuJ1) antibody 1:2,000, chicken anti-NeuN antibody (1:100) and rat anti-CTIP2 antibody (1:500), or with mouse anti-PSD95 (1:200), rabbit anti-synapsin 1 (1:200) and chicken anti-MAP2 antibody for synaptic staining.\nRinse with PBS, and incubate with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies plus DAPI for 45 min at 37 °C.\nFinally, wash twice with PBS before imaging.\n6. Calcium imaging\nInfect cultured cells with AAV8-syn-jGCAMP7f-WPRE (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, GT3 Core Facility) at 10 days post-replating and image to assess spontaneous calcium transients at 3-4 weeks post-replating.\n7. Image acquisition and Analysis\nNOTE: For details on the acquisition system please refer to Calabrese et al.12.",
    "Use an imaging module for manual or automated image acquisition, and an image analysis software module, such as CellProfiler13, for morphometric measurements.\nCalculate average length of TuJ1 positive neurites and MAP2 positive dendrites by measuring total length per field of view divided by the number of neurons (DAPI + MAP2 or TuJ1 positives cells) within the same field.\nSubscription Required.
