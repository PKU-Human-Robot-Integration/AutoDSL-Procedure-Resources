    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nTissue Fixation and Processing – Day 1\nTiming: ∼3.5 h\nThis section describes the fixation step to preserve tissue architecture and cellular contents including macromolecules. LCM depends on histological features for sample preparation and requires multiple steps which could degrade RNA molecules very easily. Therefore, it is important to fix sample properly and quickly to minimize morphological distortion and sample deterioration.\nHarvest radish roots from the soil, wash them with tap water, and dry them off with paper towel.\nCut root into a large piece using a kitchen knife, and trim into tissue blocks of approximately 1.2×1.2×1.2 cm3 in size using a razor blade (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/189-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Radish Root Tissue Block Preparation, Sample Fixation, Dehydration and Infiltration\n(A) A whole tap root from a 9-week old radish plant was collected and washed, and then a ~1.2 cm thick cross-section was cut out for the next steps.\n(B and C) (B) The root epidermis was peeled and tissue blocks of maximum 1.2×1.2×1.2 cm3 were excised and shown in (C). Each tissue block included cambium layer and surrounding tissues (cortex on the phloem side and parenchyma on the xylem side). Dashed rectangle denotes a tissue block. Scale bars in (B) and (C), 1 cm.\n(D) The tissue blocks were immediately transferred to chilled Farmer’s fixative solution in a 50 mL conical tube, dehydrated with ethanol, and infiltrated with Steedman’s wax. For visualization, tissue blocks infiltrated in 25% Steedman’s wax after 0 h, 1 h, and 3 h were shown. Red arrows in (D) point to tissue blocks.\nSee also Methods Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].",
    "Critical: We recommend preparing for tissue blocks longer than 7 mm and less than 1.2 cm on each side. This is because ∼2 mm of the block height should be trimmed off before collecting sections for LCM. In our hands, tissue sections exposed to the outside gave poor quality of RNA with a RIN less than 7.0. Trimming off the outer part and using the inner sections for LCM greatly enhanced RNA quality. Even though the block size can depend on the target tissue area or the radish root size used for sampling, we recommend not to make a tissue block too big (i.e., >1.2 cm each side). Making a tissue block too big results in poor RNA quality due to incomplete fixation and wax infiltration.\nNote: We suggest trimming off one side of the opposite phase of the LCM to mark a block orientation. It helps positioning a tissue block in the mold in a right orientation.\nPlace dissected root tissue blocks immediately into ice-cold Farmer’s fixative (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nIncubate samples at 4°C for 3 h. During the incubation, mix samples by inverting the tube about five times every hour.\nReplace with fresh cold Farmer’s fixative and incubate at 4°C for at least 12 h.\nNote: Make sure that the fixative is chilled completely before use. A 20-min ice incubation is usually enough for a small volume (e.g., 45 mL) of fixative, but incubation time can be extended depending on the amount of fixative prepared.\nCritical: Preparing for tissue blocks should be performed quickly to minimize RNA degradation. Transfer each trimmed tissue block into cold fixative immediately rather than waiting for others to be fixed altogether.",
    "Critical: The volume of fixative should be at least ten times the volume of the tissue prepared. For instance, for an amount of 45 mL of fixative, fill tissue blocks up to 5 mL mark of a 50 mL tube.\nDehydration and Infiltration – Day 2\nTiming: ∼7 h\nSteps 6 to 8 describe how to remove water from tissue, and fill the tissue spaces with embedding medium to provide a firm support during the process of microtome sectioning.\nDehydrating tissue blocks (∼4 h).\nReplace Farmer’s fixative with 45 mL of 75% ice-cold ethanol, mix by inverting the tube about five times, and incubate on ice for 15 min.\nRepeat step 6a additional three times.\nReplace with 45 mL of ice-cold 90% ethanol, mix well by inverting the tube about five times, and incubate at 4°C for 1 h.\nReplace with 45 mL of ice-cold absolute ethanol, mix well by inverting the tube about five times, and place the tube at 4°C for 1 h.\nReplace with 45 mL of 22°C–25°C-stored absolute ethanol, mix well by inverting the tube about five times, and place the tube at 40°C for 1 h to gradually raise the sample temperature to 40°C.\nInfiltrating Steedman’s wax (∼3 h).\nReplace absolute ethanol with 45 mL of 25% Steedman’s wax, mix well by inverting the tube about five times, incubate at 40°C for 3 h (tissue blocks should drop to the bottom) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nReplace with 45 mL of 50% Steedman’s wax, mix well by inverting the tube several times, and incubate at 40°C for at least 12 h.",
    "Note: You can continue and finish step 8 on Day 2. In that case, incubate samples in 50% Steedman’s wax in step 7b for 2 h or until the tissue blocks drop to the bottom of the tube.\nCritical: The time required for infiltration is dependent on the block size and the tissue characteristics such as density and size of constituting cells. Check the speed of the fall of tissue blocks in the embedding medium when the tube is turned upside down. Well-infiltrated samples drop immediately to the bottom of the tube when flipped (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. Tissue Blocks Infiltrated with 25% Steedman’s after 3 h Incubation (Step 7)\nInfiltration (Continued) – Day 3\nTiming: ∼4 h\nInfiltrating Steedman’s wax continued (∼4 h).\nReplace with 45 mL of 75% Steedman’s wax, mix well by inverting the tube several times, and incubate at 40°C for minimum 2 h or until the tissue blocks drop to the bottom of the tube.\nReplace with 45 mL of 100% Steedman’s wax, mix well by inverting the tube several times, and incubate at 40°C for minimum 2 h or until the tissue blocks drop to the bottom of the tube.\nReplace with 45 mL of 100% Steedman’s wax, mix well by inverting the tube several times, and incubate at 40°C for at least 12 h.\nNote: The higher concentration the Steedman’s wax is, the longer time it takes for a tissue block to be well-infiltrated.\nNote: In a high concentration of Steedman’s wax, the falling speed of a well-infiltrated tissue block is slower than that in a lower concentration. For examples, refer to Methods Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] (in Steedman’s wax 25% and 100%, respectively)\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
    "Methods Video S2. Tissue Blocks Infiltrated with 100% Steedman’s after 12 h Incubation (Steps 8-9)\nEmbedding – Day 4\nTiming: ∼6 h\nHere, we describe how to embed and solidify the infiltrated tissue blocks (obtained from step 8) using Steedman’s wax for sectioning.\nReplace with 45 mL of 100% Steedman’s wax one more time, mix well by inverting the tube several times, and incubate at 40°C for another 3 h.\nEmbed tissue blocks and solidify for sectioning (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/189-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Embedding, Sectioning and Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) of Radish Root Tissue Samples\n(A) An infiltrated tissue block in a mold filled with 100% Steedman’s wax. The sample orientation is shown in the bottom of the image. The image was taken from the side of sample which was subsequently attached to the embedding cassette. Once, the embedded tissue block was solidified and the surrounding wax was trimmed, the tissue block was placed on a rotary microtome for sectioning.\n(B) A ribbon of tissue with 20 μm thickness was sectioned and mounted on a PEN membrane slide and dried in a 50 mL conical tube.\n(C) Laser Capture Microdissection using an Arcturus Veritas system. A UV laser was used to define the tissue areas corresponding to cambium, phloem cortex, and xylem parenchyma, which were subsequently microdissected (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPlace and arrange the orientation of tissue blocks in a mold.\nFill up the mold with 100% Steedman’s wax.\nSolidify at 22°C–25°C for about 3 h.\nStore at 4°C in an air-tight container for at least 12 h.\nPause Point: The embedded tissue blocks can be stored at 4°C for up to a week.",
    "Optional: It is not comfortable to handle tissue blocks in a conical tube. Set heating plate to 50°C prior to use. Samples can be transferred to a wide-mouth container such as an aluminum foil boat, and place on the heating plate for easy access. You still need to work very quickly not to let the tissue block be solidified.\nNote: When multiple tissue blocks are placed in a single mold, arrange them parallel in the same orientation. CapSure Cap used for the LCM step has a limited space (circular, 5 mm in diameter). If the region of interest of your sample has a specific orientation, that will help to line up multiple cell files within a small capture area. It will also maximize RNA yield.\nCritical: You must work quickly, placing the samples in the mold before the wax starts to solidify.\nTissue Sectioning – Day 5\nTiming: ∼2 h\nIn this step, an embedded tissue block is cut into thin sections on a microtome and mounted on PEN membrane slides.\nEquilibrate a tissue block at 22°C–25°C for 1 h.\nSectioning the tissue block (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTrim the surrounding edges using a razor blade.\nPlace the block on the rotary microtome, set thickness setting at 20 μm, and trim the block until you reach and get a full face of the tissue.\nTrim off additional 100–150 sections.\nMake a ribbon of tissue sections with 20 μm thickness.\nCritical: Trim off 2–3 mm of the outer part of the tissue block. In our experience, RNA extracted from the outer margin of a tissue block mostly has severe degradation.",
    "Note: Sample section thickness can be adjusted differently. Thin section results in low RNA yield. On the other hand, a thick section may not be properly captured on the LCM cap. LCM is commonly performed with section thickness of 2–15 μm. 20 μm sections used for radish tap root had been successively captured using the settings on step 16. For other section thicknesses, UV cutting and IR wetting need to be optimized accordingly. Thick sections may also require multiple UV cutting with a high power setting. RNA degradation may occur with repeated exposure to UV laser in the region close to the cutting paths.\nNote: When you mount tissue sections on the PEN membrane slide, place them in the middle membrane coated part of the slide. Tissues on the edges of the slide cannot be captured. If you look at the membrane slide by slightly turning up and down, you can easily tell a rectangular area in the middle where the angle of light reflection is different from the other part of the slide.\nMounting embedded tissue on a slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace a suitable length of ribbon sections on a membrane slide.\nPlace DEPC-treated water underneath the sample ribbon to stretch and straighten the sample sections.\nWick away excess water using autoclaved filter paper or Kimwipes.\nNote: Remove excess water carefully not to disturb sample arrangement.\nOptional: You could use regular glass slides for mounting dissected tissues and perform LCM using IR laser. However, membrane slides allow dissecting and capturing large area at once using UV and IR laser, which can save tissue processing time and increase capture efficiency greatly.\nPlace the slide in an air-tight container containing silica balls and dry them for at least 12 h.",
    "Critical: Wick away excess water from the sample slide as much as you can before placing it into a container with silica balls. It is critical to completely dry the tissue samples on the membrane slide.\nCritical: Silica balls and debris should not touch the sample area. They stick to sample easily and interfere sample transfer to CapSure LCM cap. Use silica balls without dust particles or any small debris. If you use a 50 mL conical tube, fill up with silica balls carefully to a lower level than the conical part (i.e., below the 5 mL mark). Membrane glass slide fits only in the cylinder part of a 50 mL tube.\nNote: We recommend for LCM without delay. Although dried tissue sections might preserve RNAs in an air-tight container, RNAs in thin sections are more prone to degradation by RNases in the air or spontaneous oxidation than those in tissue blocks.\nLCM and RNA Extraction – Day 6\nTiming: ∼2.5 h\nThis section describes how to perform LCM to isolate a tissue region of interest, and subsequently extract RNA from the captured tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows tissue images of a radish root section, captured before and after the LCM.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/189-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bars, 200 μm.\nRemoving wax from the tissue sections (∼25 min).",
    "Critical: If necessary, turn on the LCM instrument and warm up the system to make the system ready for operation. For Arcturus Veritas LCM, turn on the instrument before starting this step.\nPut your sample slide into a 50 mL conical tube filled with 45 mL or more absolute ethanol and incubate for 10 min.\nTransfer the slide to a new 50 mL conical tube filled with fresh absolute ethanol and incubate for 10 min.\nDry out the slide by leaving it at 22°C–25°C for about 3 min.\nNote: If required, mix gently by tilting the tube 2–3 times while incubating.\nCritical: Slide should be dried completely. Wet tissue samples would not be captured on the Capsure LCM caps.\nCollecting tissue samples using LCM (∼1 h).\nLoad CapSure LCM caps and sample slides on the slide station.\nSetup parameters of the laser (see note below).\nHighlight regions of interest using drawing tools.\nFill the sampling area in the CapSure LCM cap by cutting and capturing the highlighted area (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nUnload the CapSure LCM caps after tissue capture and move on to the next step immediately.\nCritical: Finish tissue capturing within 2 h. We normally finish sampling within 1 h. A small amount of nuclease in the air would degrade RNA in your sample.",
    "Note: We used IR laser setting (power: 97 mv, pulse: 7,500 μs, No of hit: 3, intensity 200 mV) and UV laser power 87.00. The settings may need to be optimized for each sample slide. Try test firing of the IR and UV lasers to check the laser focus and wetting in a blank area. To ensure capturing large areas (e.g., larger than about 1 mm), we added more than three points of IR capture laser marks in multiple positions in addition to the points marked automatically.\nNote: CapSure Macro LCM cap provides a circular sampling space with 5 mm in diameter. If possible, dissect the areas of interests similar in shape to maximize the amount of sample collected and the yield of RNA.\nNote: Detailed instructions for the LCM and software operation are available in the instrument user guide provided by the manufacturer.\nExtracting RNA using PicoPure RNA isolation kit (∼1 h).\nInsert CapSure LCM cap on a 0.5 mL tube filled with 50 μL of Extraction Buffer and incubate the tube in inverted position at 42°C for 30 min.\nAdd 50 μL of 70% ethanol and mix well.\nPass the cell extract mixture through an activated RNA purification column from the kit.\nWash the spin column with 100 μL of Wash Buffer 1 by centrifuging at 8,000 × g for 1 min.\nAdd DNase I solution mixture directly onto the spin column membrane and incubate for 15 min.\nWash the spin column twice with Wash Buffer 2 by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 2 min.\nElute with 11 μL of Elution Buffer.\nAliquot 2 μL for bioanalyzer analysis and store the remaining RNA at −80°C until use.
