    "Prepare stock solutions and reaction mixtures (sterile conditions)Plate cells (sterile conditions) (see also representative pipetting scheme in Figure 1)Use non-treated 48-well plates for MM6 and Jurkat T cells and tc-treated plates for adherent cells such as BMDCs and primary monocytes.Plate 100,000 cells/well (inner 24 wells) in 140 µl RPMI1640/10% FCS by using a 200 µl single channel pipette.Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200902/20200902013404_4891.jpgFigure 1. Representative pipette scheme. Fill the outer wells with approximately 200 µl medium (gray-filled circles) to prevent evaporation of sample wells. Plate the cells in the 24 inner wells (open circles). Add medium or the appropriate control to the 12 wells on the left and add the appropriate ROS inhibitor to the 12 wells on the right (separated by the dotted line). Add medium or appropriate reference control (-), a positive control such as Phorbol-12-myristat-13-acetate (PMA) or depleted zymosan (DZ) (+), and the ROS-inducer of interest (X) in quadruplicates (or at least in triplicates).Add ROS-inhibitor or appropriate control to the cells (sterile conditions) (see also representative pipetting scheme in Figure 1 and detailed information of the ROS-inhibitor in Table 1)Table 1. Specifications of the used ROS-inhibitorsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200902/20200902013557_0132.jpgPrepare ROS-inhibitor dilutions in RPMI1640/10% FCSCatalase: at least 2,000 U/ml final conc.; Reference control: RPMI1640/10% FCS.Trolox: 5 mM final conc.; Reference control: equal volume of DMSO.NAC: 5 mM final conc.; Reference control: RPMI1640/10% FCS.gp91 ds-tat: at least 10 µM final conc.; Reference control: gp91 ds-tat scrambled.GSK2795039: 1-4 µM final conc.; Reference control: equal volume of DMSO.Place the plate with the seeded cells on a pre-warmed (37 °C) metal underlayment.Add 10 µl inhibitor or control solution by using a 20 µl single channel pipette.Place plate in cell culture incubator for 30 min at 37 °C.",
    "Add ROS-inducing treatment or appropriate control to the cells (sterile conditions) (see Figure 1)Prepare treatment solutions such as PMA [100 ng/ml] in RPMI/10% FCS.Place the plate with the seeded cells on a pre-warmed (37 °C) metal underlayment.Add 50 µl treatment solution by using a 200 µl single channel pipette and incubate for 0.5-3 h in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C (the optimal incubation time depends on the individual treatments and needs to be empirically determined (e.g., by a kinetic approach).For the last 30 min of incubation add H2DCFDA solution to the cells (sterile conditions)Prepare H2DCFDA solution in RPMI/10% FCS.Place the plate with the seeded cells on a pre-warmed (37 °C) metal underlayment.Add 10 µl H2DCFDA solution (5 mM final concentration) by using a 20 µl single channel pipette and incubate exactly for 30 min in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C.Finally, add Trolox or NAC solution to cells to terminate the reaction (sterile conditions)Place the plate with the seeded cells on a pre-warmed (37 °C) metal underlayment.Add 50 µl stop solution by using a 200 µl single channel pipette and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.Prepare cells for analysisPlace the plate with the seeded cells at 4 °C in the dark for 10 min to slow down cell metabolism (during this step fluorescently-labeled antibodies against specific cell surface markers may be added to discriminate subpopulations; do not use FITC- or Alexa488-labeled antibodies).Carefully resuspend the cells by using a 200 µl single channel pipette (3-4 times) and transfer cells into a 96-well plate (U-shape).Spin down the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Quickly remove supernatants.Resuspend cells in 300 µl ice-cold Trolox or NAC stop solution by using a 300 µl 8-channel pipette.",
    "Analyze cells via flow cytometry within the FITC-channel (see also Figure 2)Keep cells on ice in the dark.Gate on living cells by morphology (FITC-positive events represent living and metabolically active cells).Exclude cell doublets by using the forward scatter (FSC)-A and FSC-H.Perform the measurement as soon as possible within 1 h after adding the stop solution.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200902/20200902013704_5000.jpgFigure 2. Gating strategy and data analysis of intracellular ROS detection experiments using H2DCFDA. A. ROS production in cells leads to the conversion of H2DCFDA into a green fluorescent compound which can be detected within the FITC-channel by flow cytometry. Gate on living cells (determined by morphology and/or by gating on FITC positive events; not shown) and exclude cell doublets by using the forward scatter (FSC)-A and FSC-H. B. Representative histograms depicting the ROS-induction in Dectin-1-overexpressing MM6 cells mediated by recombinant Annexin A1 (blue) compared to untreated (grey) in non-pre-treated MM6 cells (left histogram) or catalase pre-treated MM6 cells (right histogram; Ziegler-Heitbrock et al., 1988). C. Quantification of one representative experiment measured in triplicates. The mean ± S.D. of the FITC-mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) is depicted. D. Statistical analysis of six independent experiments. The mean ± S.D. of the relative FITC-MFI increase in % of non-pre-treated MM6 cells compared to catalase pre-treated cells is depicted (MFI treated – MFI untreated)/MFI untreated * 100). This subfigure was taken from Bode et al., 2019. ***P < 0.001 (paired two-tailed t-test). E. Representative ROS-induction by 100 ng/ml Phorbol-12-myristat-13-acetate (PMA) and 40 µg/ml depleted Zymosan (DZ) in Dectin-1-overexpressing MM6 cells using the NOX-2-specific peptide inhibitor gp91 ds-tat or the control peptide (Ctrl.) quantified as in panel D. The mean ± S.E.M. of triplicates (DZ) or quadruplicates (PMA) is shown."
