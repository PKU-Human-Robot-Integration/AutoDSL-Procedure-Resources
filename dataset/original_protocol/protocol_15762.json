    "The experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations set forth by Landesamt fuer Gesundheit und Soziales (LaGeSo), Berlin, Germany (G0063/18). In this study, C57Bl/6J male (8-12 weeks old) mice with a weight of 25 ± 0.286 g (average ± s.e.m.) were used.\n1. Animal preparation\nInduce anesthesia by injecting ketamine (70 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Maintain normal body temperature, contributing to quick induction of deep anesthesia. Test for adequate sedation with a pain stimulus, such as a toe pinch, and verify the absence of a reaction.\nCarefully shave the neck hair of the mouse with a razor, clean it with 70% ethanol followed by betadine/chlorhexidine, and apply 1% lidocaine on the skin surface for local pain control.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position. Use tape to fix the limbs and tail, gently stretching the skin of the neck to the opposite side of the surgery. Simultaneously, elevate the neck slightly.\nUse ophthalmic ointment (e.g., 5% dexpanthenol) to prevent dehydration of the eyes during the operation.\n2.

    "Figure 1: Step-by-step images of surgical technique. (A) Depiction of the exposed right carotid artery anatomy: the CCA and its bifurcation into ICA and ECA are identified, as well as the small branches of the ECA (OA and STA). (B) The ECA is mobilized from the surrounding tissue and ligated with two sutures before cutting it. A third ligation needs to be placed loosely near the bifurcation without occluding it. (C) The ICA and CCA are occluded temporarily (with either ligation or clips) to prevent excessive bleeding when the ECA is carefully incised. (D) The filament is inserted into the ECA and advanced into the CCA. The prearranged ligation must be tightened carefully so that no blood effusion occurs but advancing the filament remains possible. (E) The ICA and CCA are reopened, and the ECA stump needs to be adjusted to a cranial direction. By pushing the filament ~9 mm forward into the ICA, the ACA-MCA bifurcation will be reached, and the vessel is then perforated by pushing the filament ~3mm further. (F) The filament is withdrawn after ensuring a temporal re-ligation of the CCA. The prearranged ligation of the ECA is quickly occluded, and the CCA is reopened to allow reperfusion. Abbreviations: ACA = anterior cerebral artery, CCA = common carotid artery, ECA = external carotid artery, MCA = middle cerebral artery, ICA = internal carotid artery, OA = occipital artery, PPA = pterygopalatine artery, STA = superior thyroid artery.

    "Separate the muscle group along one side [in this case, the right side] of the trachea, exposing the common carotid artery (CCA) sheath covered with nourishing blood vessels and venules. The CCA and the vagal nerve are located in close proximity to each other.\nDissociate the CCA and leave a free 8-0 silk suture around the CCA without ligating it in advance. Pay attention to the protection of the vagal nerve, as it is easily damaged (Figure 1A).\nA triple bifurcation of the CCA, the ICA, and the ECA is visible along the lower posterior third of the diastasis. Dissect the distal end of the ECA and ligate the vessel twice as far distaally as possible.\nDisconnect the ECA at the midpoint of the twice ligated segment, creating a vessel stump.\nPrearrange one ligation for the filament around the ECA stump, do not close it until successful filament insertion.\nUse a suture or micro clip to occlude the ICA and CCA temporarily (Figure 1B).\nMake a small incision (approximately half of the ECA diameter) in the ECA using microvascular scissors. Insert a 5-0 (alternatively 4-0) prolene filament into the ECA and advance it into the CCA.\nClose the ligature on the ECA slightly while loosening the micro clip on the ICA and CCA (Figure 1C).\nGently pull back on the filament and adjust the ECA stump in the cranial direction, invaginating the filament through the bifurcation into the ICA (Figure 1D).\nPoint the filament tip medially at an angle of ~30° to the tracheal midline and ~30° to the horizontal plane. Push the filament forward inside the ICA. After reaching the ACA-MCA bifurcation, resistance is encountered (~9 mm).",
    "Advance the filament 3 mm further, perforating the right ACA. Promptly withdraw the filament to the ECA stump, allowing blood flow into the subarachnoid space.\nKeep the filament in this position for about 10 s (Figure 1E). The presence of muscle tremors, ipsilateral miosis, gasping for breath, altered heart rhythm, and urinary incontinence can be supporting evidence of successful surgery.\nTemporarily close the CCA to avoid excess blood loss. Pull out the filament instantly and ligate the ECA with the prearranged suture. Reopen the CCA and allow reperfusion and further effusion of blood into the subarachnoid space (Figure 1F).\nAfter checking for bleeding leakage, disinfect the skin surrounding the wound to prevent postoperative skin infections, and suture the wound with a non-absorbable 4-0 polyester fiber suture.\nPlace the mouse in a thermal box until consciousness is regained. Wait until the animal is fully awake and ensure it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return animals to the company of other mice until fully recovered.\nAdminister 200-300 mg/kg body weight paracetamol for postoperative pain relief.\nCheck on the mice daily after surgery.\n3. MRI measurement\n24 h after surgery, perform MRI using a rodent scanner (Table of Materials) and a dedicated mouse head resonator- here, a 20 mm transmit/receive quadrature volume resonator was used.\nPlace the mouse on a heated circulating water blanket to ensure a constant body temperature of ~37 °C. Induce anesthesia with 2.5 % isoflurane in an O2/N2O mixture (30%/70%) and maintain with 1.5-2 % isoflurane via facemask under continuous ventilation monitoring.",
    "First perform a fast reference scan acquiring 3 orthogonal slice packages (Tri-Pilot-Multi, FLASH with repetition time TR/echo time TE = 200 ms/3 ms, 1 average, flip angle FA = 30°, field of view FOV = 28 mm x 28 mm, matrix MTX = 256 x 256, slice thickness 1 mm, total acquisition time TA =30 s).\nThen use a high resolution T2-weighted 2D turbo spin-echo sequence for imaging (imaging parameters TR/TE = 5505 ms/36 ms, RARE factor 8, 6 averages, 46 contiguous axial slices with a slice thickness of 0.35 mm to cover the whole brain, FOV = 25.6 mm x 25.6 mm, MTX = 256 x 256, TA = 13 min).\nIf the result is unclear, use an additional respiration triggered T2*weighted gradient echo sequence with the same isodistance as the T2w scan (2D FLASH, TR/TE = 600 ms/6.3 ms, FA = 30°, 1 average, 20 axial slices with 0.35 mm thickness, FOV and MTX identical to T2w, TA = 5-10 min depending on the respiration rate).\nTransfer the data into the DICOM image format and use ImageJ software for SAH grading and volumetry of blood clots. Details on the quantification are listed as a step-by-step guide in the supplementary material (Supplementary Figure 1).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
