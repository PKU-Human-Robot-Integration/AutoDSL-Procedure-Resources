We found that lengthening the\n      RNA stem (14 bp to 24 bp) had several technical advantages and it improved\n      our ability to image the particles due to the inherently high contrast of\n      RNA duplexes (Global resolution was improved from 3.8 Å to 3.5 Å).\n    \n        Purify the RIG-I:RNA complex by loading the 500 μL solution to Superdex\n        200 Increase 10/300 GL column with gel filtration buffer (without\n        glycerol).\n      \n        Concentrate the p3dsRNA:RIG-I, p2dsRNA:RIG-I, p1dsRNA:RIG-I,\n        OHdsRNA:RIG-I, p3SLR30:RIG-I and OHSLR30:RIG-I complexes to 0.3, 1.5,\n        0.4, 1.5, 1.5 and 1.5 mg/mL using 50 kD Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal\n        filter unit.\n      \nNote: These concentrations are used\n      because they achieve decent particle density on grid (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n    \n        In the case of p3SLR30:RIG-I complex with ATP in solution, OHSLR30:RIG-I\n        complex with ATP in solution and p3SLR30:RIG-I with AMPPNP in solution,\n        concentrate the p3SLR30:RIG-I and OHSLR30:RIG-I complexes to 3.0 and\n        2.5 mg/mL, respectively. Incubate 20 μL of 3, 20, 20 μM (0.3, 2.3,\n        2.3 mg/mL) of complex with 2.5 mM ATP/AMPPNP and 5 mM MgCl2\n        on ice for 30 min before applying samples to the grids.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2532-Fig2.jpg\n              Figure 2.

Close the valve of ethane after usage and pay",
    "attention to the ethane monitor. Dispose the used ethane in fume hood. Do\n      not work with ethane near heat and fire.\n    \nNote: As liquid ethane in cryogen cup will\n      solidify in a short time, it is recommended to fill with liquid ethane\n      right before freezing grids.\n    \n        Hold one grid with Vitrobot tweezer and mount the tweezer to Vitrobot.\n        \n            Lift the tweezer with grid, then transfer and lift the container.\n          \n            Apply 3 μL samples to the carbon side of the grid, blot samples with\n            force -4 for seconds (2, 3, 4, 5 s), followed by plunging grid to\n            liquid ethane.\n          \n            Transfer the grid to one of the four slots of the grid box.\n            Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\n          \n        Repeat step 9 with adjusted blotting time to freeze more grids.\n        Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\n      \n        Clip the frozen grids using the C-clip and the C-clip ring in the grid\n        clipping station (ThermoFisher), and store the autogrids (clipped grids)\n        in the autogrid boxes.\n      \nNote: Sometimes solid ethane covers the\n      grid surface. To prevent the solid ethane from damaging the grid during\n      grid clipping, the grids can be left in LN2 for 1–2 days to\n      remove the solid ethane.\n    \n        Transfer the autogrid boxes to the LN2 storage dewar for grid\n        screening and data collection.\n      \nPause point: The grids can be\n      stored in LN2 dewar for months before loading to electron\n      microscope for grid screening and data collection, but it is better to\n      restrict it within 2 months.\n    \nCryo-EM data acquisition\nTiming: 1–3 days\nThese steps describe the grid screening and cryo-EM data collection.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2532_10.csv\n        Mount the grids to the Glacios using the autoloader and screen the\n        grids.\n        \n            Take a full map of the grids using the software SerialEM5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\n            and check the ice thickness.\n          \n            Select grids with thin ice and pick 2–3 squares with ice of\n            different thickness.",
    "Note: The squares where most holes\n              are visible but the square edges are not sharp usually have decent\n              ice thickness for grid screening and data collection.\n            \n                Select 2–3 holes in one square, take micrographs from either\n                center or edge of the holes.\n              \n                Check particle quality, particle density, ice thickness and\n                crystalline ice contamination.\n              \n        Collect micrographs from the qualified grids (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\n        \nAlternatives: Both Glacios and\n          Krios are suitable to collect high-quality data for reconstructing\n          high-resolution cryo-EM maps.\n        \n            Set up the data collection conditions, make sure the beam is ready\n            for high-resolution data collection.\n          \n            Collect the micrographs with calibrated pixel size of around 1 Å/pix\n            and total electron exposure of 50–60 e-/Å2\n            (total electron exposure/frame, 1–1.5 e-/Å2).\n          \n            Use different defocus ranges during data acquisition (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\n            \nAlternatives: When the\n              particles are still visible by eyes under low defocus range (low,\n              -0.8∼-2.0 μm; high -1.2∼-3.0 μm), low defocus range can be applied\n              to improve the resolution.\n            \n            For each stage movement, acquire one micrograph/hole of 9 holes on\n            R1.2/1.3 grid.\n            \nAlternatives: For R2/2\n              grid, three to five micrographs/hole can be collected.\n            \n            Collect about 3000 micrographs under super-resolution mode in one\n            day.
