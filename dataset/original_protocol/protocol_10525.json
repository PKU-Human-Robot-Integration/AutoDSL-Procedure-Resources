    "1. Preparation of Hydrogel-associated Solutions and Aliquots\nPreparation of polyacrylamide gel precursor solution.\n\t\nPrepare polyacrylamide gel precursor solution by mixing acrylamide (A) (40% w/v, Mr 71.08 g/mol), the crosslinker bisacrylamide (B) (2% w/v, Mr 154.17 g/mol), and de-ionized water in the volume percentages specified in Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: These solutions can be prepared in large batches and stored at 4 °C for up to several months.\n\t\t\nCAUTION: Acrylamide is toxic upon inhalation or ingestion, particularly, when in powder form: thus, preferably use 40% w/v solution to reduce toxicity risks. Handle only while wearing protective clothing, such as gloves, goggles, and a lab coat. Store in a light-resistant, tightly closed container in the fridge (<23 °C, well-ventilated area).\nCAUTION: Bis-acrylamide is toxic upon inhalation or ingestion, particularly, when in powder form: thus, preferably use 2% w/v solution to reduce toxicity risks. Handle only while wearing protective clothing, such as gloves, goggles, and a lab coat. Store in a light-resistant, tightly closed container in the fridge (<4 °C, well-ventilated area).\nPreparation and usage of N-Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate (Sulfo-SANPAH, Mr 492.40 g/mol) aliquots. CAUTION: Sulfo-SANPAH causes serious eye irritation; handle with gloves and proper eye or face protection. Store at -20 °C upon receipt and prior to aliquoting.\n\t\nTo store sulfo-SANPAH: dissolve Sulfo-SANPAH in dimethylsulfoxane (DMSO) at 50 mg/ml. Aliquot the stock solution into 50 micro centrifuge tubes of 20 μl per tube. Flash freeze on dry ice or in liquid nitrogen (an optional but preferred step to preserve maximum crosslinker efficiency) and store at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The aliquots can be stored for several months.\nTo use sulfo-SANPAH: thaw the aliquot briefly and dilute in 480 μl of de-ionized water. Use immediately. Sulfo-SANPAH hydrolyzes quickly in water: therefore take caution to perform all of the above steps quickly.",
    "Preparation of ammonium persulfate (Mr 228.18 g/mol) aliquots.\n\tNOTE: Ammonium persulfate causes eye, skin and respiratory irritation. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment when handling. Handle ammonium persulfate powder in a chemical fume hood. Store powder in a dry, well-ventilated place. Once aliquoted, the dilute solution could be used on the work bench.\n\t\nDissolve ammonium persulfate in deionized water to achieve a final ammonium persulfate concentration of 10% w/v. Aliquot and store at -20 °C. Thaw immediately prior to use.\nPreparation of Collagen Type I solution.\n\t\nPrepare 0.2 mg/ml collagen solution by diluting the stock solution in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) of pH 7.4. Store on ice briefly or use immediately upon dilution.\n2. Hydrogel Preparation (Refer to Figure 1)\nPreparation of hydrophobic glass slides.\n\t\nPlace a few drops of a hydrophobic solution on a glass plate and use tissue paper to spread across the surface. Let air dry and wipe with a tissue paper again to even out the hydrophobic coating.\n\t\tNOTE: Store hydrophobic solution in a flammable cabinet at RT. Wear personal protective equipment when handling. Work in a well-ventilated area.\nPreparation of flexible plastic support.\n\t\nCut the flexible plastic support to match the size of the hydrophobic-coated glass plate.\nMark the hydrophobic side of the flexible plastic support by lightly scratching the surface with a sharp tool such as a scalpel.\n\t\tNOTE: Once the gel — which is fully transparent — dries, the scratch marks will help distinguish which flexible plastic support side contains the gel.\n\t\tNOTE: The flexible plastic support has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side. Once deposited, polyacrylamide permanently adheres to the hydrophilic side of the plastic support which facilitates easy subsequent hydrogel handling.\nGel Preparation (example volumes are given for 5 ml gel precursor solutions).",
    "NOTE: 5 ml would be sufficient to produce ~40 gels when the gel initial thickness is 0.5 mm. More gels can be produced if the gel thickness is reduced.\n\t\nPlace 4972.5 μl of polyacrylamide precursor solution of desired final concentration (Table 1) into a 50 ml conical tube. Place in a degassing chamber for 30 min with the cap opened.\n\t\tNOTE: Oxygen acts as a free radical trap and when present, it inhibits polymerization.\nAdd 25 µl of 10% w/v ammonium persulfate (refer to point 1.3) to achieve a final ammonium persulfate concentration of 0.05%.\nAdd 2.5 µl of N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED, Mr 116.24 g/mol) to the degassed gel solution to achieve a final TEMED concentration of 0.5%.\n\t\tNOTE: Store TEMED in a flammable cabinet at RT. Handle in a chemical fume hood when wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Keep tightly closed under inert gas, as it is highly air and moisture sensitive.\nMix the solution gently by pipetting up and down 3 – 5 times. Do not vortex to avoid oxygen diffusion into the gel precursor solution.\nPipette the gel solution onto the hydrophilic side of the flexible plastic support and sandwich with hydrophobic-coated glass slide. Separate the two slides with silicone spacers of desired thickness (e.g., 0.5 mm). Leave a small amount (~100 μl) of polymer precursor solution in the 50 ml conical tube to use as an indicator of gelation.\n\t\tNOTE: Any spacer could be used. For example, a single strip of Parafilm gives a final swollen gel thickness of 100 – 120 μm.\nPlace another glass plate atop the flexible plastic support/gel sandwich to ascertain an even hydrogel surface upon polymerization.",
    "Let the gel polymerize for 45 min, although less time can be used for gels of higher % wt if desired. To ascertain that the gel has polymerized, observe the remaining solution in the 50 ml conical tube; if the remaining solution has gelled, then it is likely that gelation on the glass plate has been initiated as well. However, note that premature opening of the mold will prevent complete polymerization.\nOnce the gel is formed, peel off the flexible plastic support with the covalently attached polyacrylamide gel on top, and set gel-side-up to air dry.\n\t\tNOTE: Convection or heat drying can also be used to accelerate this step. Once dried onto the flexible plastic support, the gel can be stored indefinitely.\n\t\t\nMark any bare spots of the flexible plastic support, where polyacrylamide gels did not form due to bubbles. Mark while the gel is still hydrated as this will blend in with the flexible plastic support once the gel is dry.\n3. Multiwell Plate Assembly, Collagen Coating, and Sterilization\nMultiwell plate assembly.\n\t\nOnce dried, cut PA gels into desired shapes.\n\t\t\nFor a 96-well plate, use a heavy-duty hole punch with a diameter of ~6 mm. Use a heavy-duty paper cutter to cut gels into square or rectangular shapes. Alternatively, use scissors.\nPrepare approximately 500 μl of PDMS per 96-well plate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To glue the gels to the bottom of a multiwell plate, place a small droplet (~5 μl) of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) at the center of the each well. Using forceps, place one polyacrylamide gel in each well, flexible plastic support side down. To allow PDMS to cure, leave the assembled plate at 37 °C for a minimum of 4 hr.\nCollagen coating of polyacrylamide gels.",
    "With a transfer pipette, place a small amount (7 – 8 μl) of sulfo-SANPAH (refer to point 1.2.2) in each well and swirl from side to side to coat the gel surface evenly. Work promptly since sulfo-SANPAH is not stable in water.\nPlace the well plate under a high intensity UV lamp (intensity = 37 mW, λ = 302 – 365 nm) for 5 min. Rinse the gels with PBS to remove excess sulfo-SANPAH.\nPipette 50 µl of 0.2 mg/ml Collagen Type I solution (refer to point 1.4) into each well. Leave the plate covered at RT for at least 2 hr or O/N at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: To speed up the process of collagen coating, a transfer pipette can be used to add the collagen solution. Typically, 1 – 2 droplets of solution should be enough to completely cover the gel surface.\nLeave the well plate at RT for at least 2 hr to allow collagen bonding.\nRinse with PBS to remove excess collagen solution and sterilize under UV (λ = 200 nm) in a tissue culture hood for 2 hr.\nSoak the gels in complete medium (refer to section 4.1 for medium composition) O/N to hydrate and equilibrate. Use for cell seeding immediately or store in the fridge for up to 2 days.\n4. Cell Seeding on PA Stiffness Assay\nNOTE: Although typical for common mammalian cell lines, the protocol outlined in this section is specifically used with the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line (see Figures 4 and 5).",
    "Collect cells from tissue culture flask by exposure to 5% trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. Use ~80 μl of trypsin/EDTA per each cm2 of culture flask area; for example, use 2 ml of trypsin/EDTA for a T25 cell culture flask. Re-suspend collected cells in complete medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at a desired final cell concentration. Taking into account cell doubling time as well as the length of time the cells will be seeded on the assay, choose an appropriate sub-confluent cell concentration. Ensure that added medium is enough to completely submerge the hydrogels.\n\tNOTE: Since the hydrogels have been pre-equilibrated in media (refer to step 3.2.6) 100 μl volume should be sufficient. Typical medium volumes used for multiwell plates should be sufficient since the gels have been pre-equilibrated in media in the previous step.\n\tNOTE: The assay would be appropriate for any attachment-dependent cell type.\n\t\nCount cell number under an inverted microscope by using a hemacytometer. Load 10 µl of cell suspension into each hemacytometer port and average the cell count from at least 8 quadrants. To get the final cell concentration, multiply the cell count by 104.\n\t\tNOTE: Best cell count results are obtained when cell number in each hemacytometer quadrant is 20 – 50.",
    "Culture the cells onto the PA stiffness assay in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change media every 2 – 3 days. Collect cells when needed by exposure to 5% trypsin/EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min. Use ~80 μl of trypsin/EDTA per cm2 of tissue culture flask. During all cell manipulation steps, take special care not to disrupt the hydrogel surface: aspirate or pipette medium by slightly tipping the multiwell plate sideways and touching the pipette tip onto the side wall of each well, as opposed to touching the hydrogel.\n\tNOTE: Except for taking special care not to damage the hydrogel surface during standard tissue culture handling, the cells seeded onto the stiffness assay can be manipulated the same way as if they were seeded onto a regular multiwell plate.\n5. Imaging of Cells Seeded onto PA Stiffness Assay\nImage cells directly on the PA stiffness assay.\n\tNOTE: Any microscope — inverted, fluorescent, or confocal, can be used for cell imaging.\n\tNOTE: The flexible plastic support used to construct the stiffness assay is fully transparent and does not autofluoresce or interfere with cell imaging. However, even though the flexible plastic support itself is transparent, imaging capabilities will be limited by the working distance of the objective. The flexible plastic support has a thickness of 0.23 mm and a typical working distance of a 10X objective is ~4 mm, sharply decreasing for higher magnifications.\n\t\nFor live cell imaging, position PA stiffness assay in microscope plate holder and image. Keep imaging sessions under 2 hr, or use a microscope equipped with an environmental chamber for longer imaging times.",
    "When live cell imaging is not the goal, fix cells in 4% formaldehyde solution supplemented with 0.1% detergent. Soak cells in fixative at RT for a minimum of 2 hr. Rinse with PBS twice. Discard fixative waste in a designated waste container.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells can be imaged immediately or stored submerged in PBS at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. CAUTION: Formaldehyde is toxic upon inhalation and contact. Handle with gloves in a chemical fume hood.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell fixation protocol has to be chosen based on the subsequent cell staining and handling protocols, because certain fixatives damage some cell proteins.\nFor fluorescent imaging, stain fixed cells with desired cell stain directly in the multiwell plate. Image immediately.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
