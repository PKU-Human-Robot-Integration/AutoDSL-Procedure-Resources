    "Find non-essential S. cerevisiae genes (after deletion or inactivation of which will not result in lethality) with one of the following databases: http://www.yeastgenome.org/ [href=http://www.yeastgenome.org/] http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/yeast/ [href=http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/yeast/] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ [href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/]    Design two 20 nucleotide (nt) spacer sequences for the CRISPR array  Design the two 20 nt spacer sequences for the CRISPR array with the online tool E-CRISP. The following factors should be considered when designing the spacer sequence:   Spacer sequence length is generally 17-20 nt. The protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is 5’-NGG-3’.   The spacer sequence may be located on the non-transcribed strand or the transcribed strand.   The selected spacer sequence should be specific to avoid off-target effects.  The tool E-CRISP helps design site-specific spacer sequences.  (http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP/[href=http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP/])       Construct the crRNA-Cas9 plasmid   The dsDNA insertion fragment for the crRNA transcript which contains two spacer sequences and two partial direct repeat sequences has to be synthesized (Figure 1).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170715/20170715034230_9981.jpg Figure 1. Schematic representation of the dsDNA used for crRNAs expression    The dsDNA insert for crRNA transcription is digested using BsaI and cloned into the BsaI-digested pCRCT plasmid (Bao et al., 2015).    DNA digestion reaction: 30 ng of pCRCT plasmid DNA (or the dsDNA) 10x buffer G:                                                                2 µl Bsal:                                                                             1 µl Add H2O to                                                                   20 µl   Incubate at 37 °C for 3 h.   Analyze the digestion reaction with 1% (or 2%) (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and recover the digested DNA using an agarose gel purification kit.    Ligate the dsDNA insert for crRNA transcription into pCRCT plasmids    The ligation reaction:  BsaI digested plasmid:                                                     2 µl (20 ng) BsaI digested dsDNA insert for crRNA transcription:       0.3 µl (20-50 ng) Ligation mixture:                                                               2.5 µl  Add H2O to                                                                       5 µl    Incubate at 16 °C overnight.    Transform E. coli DH5α competent cells with the ligation product.",
    "Add 5 μl ligation mix into ice-cold competent E. coli DH5α (100 μl).   Incubate mixture on ice for 30 min and heat-shock it at 42 °C for 90 sec.   Cool down on ice for 2 min.   Add 700 μl LB medium (without antibiotics) and incubate at 37 °C and shake at 250 rpm for 45 min.    Plate 200 μl bacteria suspension on LB plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin.

Pick positive clone(s) in 5 ml LB medium with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and incubate for 16 h, at 37 °C, 200 rpm in a shaker.     Extract plasmids from the transformed DH5α cells using the Pure Plasmid Mini Kit.   Transform crRNA-Cas9 plasmids into S. cerevisiae competent cells using LiAc/SS carrier DNA/PEG method (Gietz et al., 2007).       Verification of Cas9-crRNA mediated large fragment deletions in S. cerevisiae.   To verify Cas9-crRNA mediated large fragment deletions, a pair of gene specific primers is required to amplify the targeted region.    Pick positive clone(s) from selection plate in 5 ml SC medium without uracil and incubate at 28 °C and shake at 200 rpm for 4 d.   Extract S. cerevisiae genomic DNA from step D2 using Yeast Gen DNA Kit.   Perform PCR amplification using genomic DNAs extracted from transgenic S.",
    "cerevisiae with the following PCR procedure: Note: P1 and P2 primers (Figure 2, Table 1) are designed based on the sequence flanking the target region to amplify the junction sequence, and amplicon is possible across the ligated junction only when large deletion occurred. P3-P8 primers can confirm the result. The primers can be designed by Primer3 (length: 18-25, GC content: 40%-60%).
