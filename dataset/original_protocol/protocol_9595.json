    "1. Preparing L. reuteri DSM20016 electrocompetent cells\nNOTE: This is based on a protocol by Berthier et al.17, with centrifugation speeds informed by Rattanachaikunsopon et al.18.\nIn a 50 mL centrifuge tube, inoculate L. reuteri from glycerol stock into 6 mL of deMan Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) broth. Incubate aerobically overnight at 37 °C in a static incubator.\nThe next morning, inoculate 4 mL of the overnight culture into 200 mL of MRS broth (1:50 dilution).\nAllow to grow aerobically in a static 37 °C incubator until the 600 nm optical density value (OD600) reaches 0.5-0.85; this should take roughly 2-3 h.\nAs soon as an adequate OD600 value is reached, decant the media into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and place on ice while balancing the tubes.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 5,000 x g in a pre-chilled, 4 °C centrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend each pellet in 50 mL of pre-chilled (0 °C to 4 °C) ddH2O, and centrifuge again with the same settings as the previous step. Keep the cells on ice as much as possible.\nRepeat step 1.6.\nResuspend each pellet in 25 mL of ddH2O: 0.5 M sucrose, 10% glycerol. Centrifuge at 5,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and put the cells back on ice.\nResuspend all the pellets in the same 2 mL of ddH2O: 0.5 M sucrose, 10% glycerol.\nAliquot into 50 µL to 100 µL portions in pre-chilled microcentrifuge tubes; store at -80 °C for later use.\n2. Electroporation of L. reuteri \nNOTE: Avoid pipetting as much as possible in the following steps. Inclusion of a control electroporation, with no plasmid added, is advised to ensure the antibiotic selection is adequate.\nTake an entire electrocompetent L. reuteri aliquot and thaw it on ice.",
    "Gently mix 5 µL to 10 µL of plasmid (final plasmid concentration >6 nM) into the thawed aliquot, avoiding pipetting as much as possible.\nTransfer to an ice-chilled, 1 mm gap electroporation cuvette.\nElectroporate at 1.25 kV, 400 Ω, and 25 µF.\nAdd 1 mL of room temperature (RT) MRS broth and mix by inverting the cuvette once or twice.\nPlace the cuvettes into a static incubator at 37 °C for 2.5-3 h to allow for recovery.\nPlate the entire amount onto multiple MRS agar plates with appropriate selection.\nPlace the plates inside a completely airtight container with a small lit candle (\"tealight\") and an anaerobic atmosphere-generating sachet.\nGrow at 37 °C for 2-3 days or until visible colonies are present.\n3. Measurement of the acid-resistant fluorescent reporter protein mCherry2\nPick any colonies required for measurement and inoculate into a 96-well storage microplate with 1.5 mL of filter sterilized (non-autoclaved) MRS broth per well and an appropriate selection antibiotic.\nIncubate aerobically for 24 h overnight at 37 °C without shaking.\n\tNOTE: This storage microplate should be kept for use in section 4 (colony PCR).\nL. reuteri will precipitate out of the media when in the stationary phase; resuspend the overnight culture via pipetting.\nTransfer 200 µL into a flat, clear-bottom, 96-well plate, transfer the plate to a plate reader, and measure the OD and fluorescence of mCherry2 (excitation [Ex]: 589 nm; emission [Em]: 610 nm) or other relevant reporters.\n4. Confirmation of plasmid uptake via colony PCR\nFrom the 96-well storage microplate from section 3, transfer 5 µL to a PCR tube.\n\tNOTE: If >5 min have passed, it may be necessary to resuspend the L. reuteri a second time.",
    "In a portable benchtop microcentrifuge, spin down until the pellet can be seen (roughly 2 min at 2,000 x g), discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 20 µL of 20 mM NaOH.\nBoil at 95 °C for 5 min, vortex, and repeat the boil a second time.\nImmediately chill the samples; try to keep the samples on ice as much as possible in the following steps to lower the likelihood of template degradation and PCR inhibition.\nSpin down in a portable benchtop microcentrifuge at 2,000 x g for 2 min until the cell debris is pelleted, then take 1 µL of the supernatant and dilute into 99 µL of ice-cold DNase- and RNase-free ddH2O (100x dilution).\nUse the 100x dilution as the template DNA in a standard PCR reaction using plasmid-specific primers. Include a positive control with a plasmid derived from the E. coli mini-prep.\nReturn the samples on ice and add an appropriate loading dye at a 1x concentration.\nRun in 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (tris-acetate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]) at 110 V for 30 min. Image if necessary.\n5. Mini-prep protocol for L. reuteri , followed by PCR to confirm plasmid presence\nNOTE: Protocol intended for use with the mini-prep kit listed in the Table of Materials.\nInoculate L. reuteri into 10 mL of MRS broth containing an appropriate antibiotic and incubate overnight aerobically at 37 °C in a static incubator.\nCentrifuge at 5,000 x g for 10 min in a pre-chilled 4 °C centrifuge.\nWash the pellet in 2 mL of standard P1 buffer (included with the kit) in order to negate acidity that may interfere with later steps, centrifuge with the same setting as previously described, and discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 250 µL of modified P1 buffer containing 10 mg/mL lysozyme and 100 U/mL mutanolysin in order to lyse bacterial cells. Incubate for 1-2 h at 37 °C.\nAdd 250 µL of buffer P2, mix by inverting four to six times, and incubate at RT for no longer than 5 min.\nAdd 350 µL of buffer N3 (included with the kit) and immediately invert four to six times gently to mix.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min.\nTransfer as much supernatant as possible to a spin column and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 60 s. Discard the flow through.\nWash the spin column with 500 µL of buffer PB (included with the kit) and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 60 s. Discard the flow through.\nWash the spin column with 750 µL of buffer PE (included with the kit), and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 60 s. Discard the flow through and centrifuge for 60 s to remove any residual buffer.\nPlace the spin column in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Apply 20-30 µL of DNAse- and RNAse-free ddH2O to the filter of the spin column and leave for 1-2 min, before centrifuging at 10,000 x g for 60 s.\nPerform a standard PCR reaction using plasmid-specific primers (pTRKH3_pTUSeq_F: CACCCGTTCTCGGAGCA, pTRKH3_pTUSeq_R: CTACGAGTTGCATGATAAAGAAGACA), with eluate providing the template DNA. Include a positive control with a plasmid derived from the E. coli mini-prep.\n\tNOTE: The PCR settings used in this study are: 98 °C for 5 min, (98 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s) 30 cycles, 72 °C for 2 min, 4 °C hold. The parameters are highly dependent on the polymerase used, fragment length, and exact primers used by any person utilizing this protocol.",
