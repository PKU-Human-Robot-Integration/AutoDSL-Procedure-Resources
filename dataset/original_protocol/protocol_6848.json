    "Cell-free (in vitro) protein synthesis The cell-free reaction involves incubating the S30 lysate with the DNA construct, encoding the gene of interest under a constitutive promoter, and the necessary cofactors in a dialysis setting. For more details about the DNA construct, please see Note 3.    When testing new constructs for cell-free expression, the use of reagents can be minimized by preparing small-scale cell-free reactions in a total inner volume of 50 µl and outer volume of 500 µl in the dialysis (Figure 2). Figure 2 illustrates the setup we use in our laboratory but other dialysis set ups can be used. For most proteins, a reaction volume of 50 µl should provide enough sample for running on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel to confirm the expression of the protein of interest and its relative yield across different reaction conditions.    To produce larger quantities of proteins, the inner and outer volumes can be increased accordingly. Our large-scale production typically has an inner volume of 1 ml and an outer volume of 10 ml with each 1-ml reaction producing ~0.5-2 mg of a hydrophobin protein.    To allow easy reproduction and scaling of the cell-free reactions, prepare the necessary reagents as combinations of mixtures as per Tables 1 and 2 and store at -80°C. The following protocol shows a small-scale cell-free reaction of 50 µl inner reaction volume and 500 µl outer reaction volume as described in Table 3. The concentration ranges for components that likely require optimization depending on the proteins of interest are given in Table 4.

Preparation of a custom micro-dialysis button. A. Heat up a scalpel (e.g., using a Bunsen burner) and slice the tip of the tube and cut off the lid with scissors. B. Add inner reaction mixture to the lid, cover with a small piece of dialysis membrane. C. Seal the dialysis membrane onto the lid with the cut plastic tube, in the same orientation as per standard tube closure. Make sure the membrane is in place securely with excess dialysis membrane visible all around the lid. D. Add the outer reaction mixture to a collection tube that has a diameter slightly larger than the micro-dialysis button. Place the micro-dialysis button inside this tube.For a small-scale reaction, make a micro-dialysis button by slicing the lid of a 0.45-ml PCR tube.Place the lid upside down on a flat surface and add 50 μl of the inner reaction mixture (or any other desirable volume that fits) to the lid.Wet a small stretch of 10,000 MWCO SnakeSkin® dialysis membrane with water, dab off the excess water with a tissue paper and wedge the membrane between the lid and the cut tube.Add the outer reaction mixture to a tube and place the micro-dialysis button inside with the membrane exposed to the outer reaction mixture.Incubate the cell-free reaction for 4-20 h at 30°C and 180 rpm by taping it to a holder in a shaking incubator.",
    "Initial analysis of protein expressionOnce the reaction has been completed, remove the dialysis buttons and dab dry. Then carefully pierce the membrane with a pipette tip with pipette plunger depressed to the first stop and aspirate the inner reaction mixture for downstream analysis.Clarify the reaction mixture by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C) and separate soluble and insoluble fractions and aliquot appropriate amounts for SDS-PAGE analysis.For 20-µl SDS-PAGE gel samples, take 10 µl of the clarified soluble fraction and add 10 µl of 1× PBS, and take the insoluble fraction and dilute with 20 µl of 1 M Urea.Add 1× LDS buffer from 4× LDS stock to the gel samples and heat for 10 min at 80°C.Run SDS-PAGE analysis at 200 V for 20 min and stain according to manufacturer’s protocol.Purification of the expressed proteinThis will vary depending on the protein of interest and whether an affinity tag is present. For the hydrophobin proteins produced in our laboratory, we use Nickel-NTA Affinity Chromatography (IMAC), followed by cleavage and removal of the hexa-histidine tag when needed and then reverse-phased High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (rpHPLC). The use of isotopically labeled amino acids (e.g., with 15N) can circumvent the need for protein purification in certain applications (e.g., to check protein conformation using 1H-15N NMR spectroscopy) which can lead to a substantial time saving.Analysis of the purified proteinThe analysis of the purified protein, including measuring its yield will vary according to the specific characteristics of the protein of interest as well as the available equipment. Several techniques such as gel densitometry, Bradford assays or UV-Vis spectroscopy can be utilized to measure the yield of the purified protein. An activity assay (e.g., enzymatic activity assay) for the protein of interest should be conducted if available to assess if the produced protein is functional.",
    "With our proteins of interest, we check protein purity using SDS-PAGE, calculate the yield of the hydrophobin proteins by measuring absorbance of the purified protein solution at 280 nm using a NanoDropTM, confirm the correct folding via NMR spectroscopy, confirm the mass of the protein matches that of the calculated mass via mass spectrometry and validate its ability to assemble using Thioflavin-T assays."
