    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of PBMCs from Cynomolgus macaque whole blood\nTiming: 3 h\nThe isolation of PBMCs from Cynomolgus macaque blood is not as efficient as that of human or even Rhesus macaque. We have found that Percoll gives the best results. The Cynomolgus PBMC layer will contain many more red blood cells than human, so ACK lysis is essential for efficient cell sorting.\nDispense anti-coagulated blood into a 50 mL conical tube and spin at 650 g for 10 min at room temperature with the deceleration and acceleration on lowest speed to avoid disruption of plasma layer atop the RBC/PBMC layer.\nPipette off the clear plasma (upper layer) leaving behind RBC/PBMC enriched layer.\nDilute remaining RBC/PBMC layer with 1 volume of PBS.\nPlace 15 mL room temperature 60% Percoll solution into a 50 mL conical, making sure to avoid getting Percoll on the sides of the tube.\nSlowly, overlay up to 35 mL blood on top of the Percoll solution.\nCentrifuge blood for 30 min at 650 g with the deceleration and acceleration on lowest speed.\nPipette off the top layer until ∼2.5 cm above interphase.\nUse a pipette to collect the hazy middle layer containing PBMCs and put into a new tube.\nFill up new 50 mL conical tube with PBS.\nWash cells by spinning at 650 g for 10 min with the deceleration and acceleration returned to their highest settings.\nRemove supernatant and lyse red blood cells.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of ACK lysis buffer.\nFill up tube to 50 mL with ACK lysis buffer.\nRock tube gently for 8 min at room temperature.\nSpin cells for 10 min at 650 g.",
    "Note: Do not exceed 8 min of lysing time for optimal lymphocyte recovery. If cellular debris is visible following lysis, strain sample through a 70 μm filter into a new 50 mL conical tube before centrifugation.\nResuspend cells in 300 μL of flow cytometry buffer and move to a sterile FACS tube.\nSorting of Tregs from PBMCs\nTiming: 5 h\nTo minimize cell death, we perform a low-pressure sort using a 100 μm nozzle into 5 mL polypropylene tubes containing 1 mL of R10 medium as a cushion. Platelets will outnumber lymphocytes in the sample to be sorted. Use your flow sorter’s FSC threshold to eliminate platelets from the screen. Though many platelets will remain in the Treg population following sorting, we have not seen this impact any downstream applications. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] depicts the gating strategy we use to isolate Tregs in Cynomolgus macaque.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2122-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Hierarchical gating strategy for NHP Treg sorting\n(A) Trigger pulse width vs. FSC gates on single cells.\n(B) SSC vs. FSC gates on lymphocytes.\n(C) CD4+ CD8- gating removes both CD4- CD8+ and CD4+ CD8+ cells.\n(D) Among CD4+ CD8- cells, gate on the top 1%–2% of CD25+ CD127- cells.\n(E) finally, gate on CD45RA+ cells.\nMake antibody staining master mix containing titrated amounts of the following antibodies:\nCD4-BV421 (OKT4).\nCD8α-BV510 (RPA-T8).\nCD25-PE/Dazzle 594 (BC96).\nCD127-PE (A019D5).\nCD45RA-FITC (5H9).\nNote: The concentration of antibodies used for flow cytometry throughout this protocol will need to be titered by each individual lab to ensure optimal performance on their flow sorter. We stain up to 100 million cells in 600 μL of flow buffer.\nAdd antibody staining master mix to cells.\nVortex tubes to mix well.\nPut tubes in 4°C refrigerator for 15 min.",
    "Wash cells with 3 mL flow buffer, spin for 10 min at 650 g at room temperature.\nResuspend cells in 500 μL flow buffer.\nFilter cells through 35 μM strainer top moved from a polystyrene FACS tube onto a sterile polypropylene FACS tube.\nCount cells and adjust to 20 × 106 cells/mL with flow buffer.\nSort Tregs using the following successive gates (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3E):\nTrigger Pulse Width vs. FSC-A for single cells.\nSSC-A vs. FSC-A to gate on lymphocytes.\nCD4+ CD8-.\nCD25+ CD127- (take top 1%–2%).\nCD4+ vs. CD45RA+.\nExpansion and transduction of CAR Tregs\nTiming: 3 weeks\nThe goal of this step is to take stringently sorted Tregs and expand them into clinical sized doses of CAR Tregs. As few as 25k Tregs is sufficient to grow clinical sized doses of CAR Tregs. On each day of (re)stimulation, it is critical that aAPCs make physical contact with the T cells, so err on the side of choosing a plate or flask with a smaller surface area rather than a larger one. Since cells transduced with functional levels of CAR are exclusively re-stimulated by K562.Bw6.86 cells, absolute growth can be minimal between weeks 1–2 despite an increase in the percentage of CAR+ Tregs. This contrasts with antigen non-specific stimulation during week 1, where each cell is stimulated. Microscopy of stimulated Tregs can be seen in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] demonstrates the enrichment of CAR+ cells by antigen specific restimulation of CAR Tregs, while Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] depicts the expected growth of Tregs along with expected expression of FoxP3, CAR, CTLA-4, and Helios.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2122-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Panels B and C represent data from day 18–21 of expansion.\nSpin down sorted Tregs and count cells.\nPlate 25k–100k Tregs in 200 μL R10 medium with 100k irradiated K562.F12Q.86 cells and 300 IU/mL IL-2 in 96 well flat bottom plate.\nNote: We also expand CD4+ CD25- effector T cells (Teffs) to be used as FoxP3- flow and suppressor assay controls with this same protocol with 100 IU/mL of IL-2 instead of 300 IU/mL.\nAfter 48 h, add ½ vial of Bw6-28z virus dropwise, making sure not to disturb any clumps.\n24 h later, move cells to 48 well plate.\nDouble the volume of R10 and add IL-2 back to 300 IU/mL, assuming consumption. Place cells back in incubator.\nOn day 5, count cells and adjust to 500k cells/mL with R10.\nAdd IL-2 to cells at 300 IU/mL, assuming consumption.\nOn day 7, count cells and take 50k cells for surface staining flow cytometry to assess viral transduction percentage, staining in 100 μL of flow buffer containing titrated amounts of the following:\nFixable Viability Dye eFluor 780.\nCD4-BV421 (OKT4).\nCD8α-BV510 (RPA-T8).\nCD25-PE/Dazzle 594 (BC96).\nHLA-B7 Tetramer-PE.\nTake remaining cells and adjust to 500k cells/mL with R10 medium.\nAdd 1 irradiated K562.Bw6.86 cell per Treg and add 300 IU/mL IL-2, assuming consumption.",
    "Note: Any irradiated target antigen+ cells can be used for restimulation. In this example, Bw6+ PBMCs (30 gy. irradiated) is an alternative.\nOn day 9, double media with R10 containing 600 IU/mL IL-2 and move cells to appropriate plate or flask.\nOn day 11, count cells and adjust to 500k cells/mL with R10 medium.\nAdd IL-2 to 300 IU/mL, assuming consumption.\nOn day 14 / 16 / 18, repeat the steps from days 7/ 9 / 11, but with a 1:2 ratio of aAPCs to Tregs.\nWhen cells reach resting state, usually around 375–400 fL in volume as seen on a Coulter counter during cell counting, freeze up to 50 × 106 Tregs in 1 mL of 90% FBS + 10% DMSO solution.\nTo assess Treg product by flow cytometry, first wash 500k cells in 3 mL flow buffer and then resuspend cells in 100 μL flow buffer containing titrated amounts of the following:\nCD4-BV605 (OKT4).\nCD8α-BV510 (RPA-T8).\nCD127-PerCP/Cy5.5 (A019D5).\nCD25-BV421 (BC96).\nFixable Viability Dye eFluor 780.\nIncubate in 4°C refrigerator for 30 min.\nWash cells with 3 mL flow buffer.\nSpin down for 5 min at 485 g.\nDuring spin, add 250 μL 4× TrueNuclear Fix Concentrate to 750 μL Fix Diluent to make 1× Fix Solution.\nDecant liquid and resuspend cells in 1 mL TrueNuclear Fix Solution.\nVortex cells well and incubate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.\nDuring incubation, make 6.5 mL 1× Perm Buffer per sample by diluting 1 part 10× Perm Buffer with 9 parts Milli-Q water.\nAfter incubation, add 2 mL 1× Perm Buffer and spin down cells for 5 min at 485 g.\nDecant, and add another 2 mL 1× Perm Buffer.\nWash cells again via centrifugation.",
    "During second spin, make intracellular antibody master mix in 100 μL 1× Perm Buffer containing titrated amounts of the following antibodies:\nFoxP3-PE/Dazzle 594 (206D).\nCTLA-4-BV786 (BNI3).\nHelios-PE/Cy7 (22F6).\nHLA-B7 Tetramer-PE.\nAdd antibody master mix to cells.\nVortex cells, and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nWash cells with 2 mL 1× Perm Buffer, spin for 5 min at 485 g.\nWash cells again with 3 mL flow buffer, spin for 5 min at 485 g.\nResuspend cells in 200 μL flow buffer for analysis on flow cytometer.\nLAP assay\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following protocol allows the researcher to determine the extent of antigen specific activation of the CAR Treg product by measuring cell surface expression of the TGFβ propeptide LAP. While the assay using aAPC targets bearing the antigen of interest is described, this assay has also been successful with plate-bound antigen. Example of expected results can be found in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]. A graphical representation of the LAP assay is depicted in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2122-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

As the amount of CTV used can impact proliferation and viability of PBMCs, we have described our method below. The CTV labeled before freezing is well maintained, and doing so in larger batches increases consistency between experiments and saves time.\nObtain PBMCs from NHP blood draw as described in the method “isolation of PBMCs from Cynomolgus macaque whole blood[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]”.\nRemove 1 vial of CTV from freezer.\nAllow vial to warm to room temperature before opening.\nPulse spin tube to pool reagent at bottom of tube.\nResuspend in 20 μL anhydrous DMSO to generate 5 mM stock solution.\nWash cells once with PBS and resuspend up to 25 × 106 PBMCs in 1 mL PBS.\nDilute CTV stock 1:100 to 50 μM.",
    "Add 110 μL of 50 μM working stock for every 1 mL of cells in PBS for a final concentration of 5 μM.\nMix well and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nNote: CellTrace proliferation dyes will undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solutions to become non-cell permeable. Dilute stock with PBS just before labeling cells.\nTo remove free dye from solution, add 5 volumes of R10 and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nSpin cells down for 5 min at 485 g and freeze in aliquots of 2.5 × 106 cells/vial in 90% FBS / 10% DMSO.\nTreg suppression assay\nTiming: 4 days\nThis assay quantifies the antigen non-specific suppressive activity of CAR Tregs. We suggest dedicating a large quantity of PBMCs that have been labeled with cell proliferation dye and frozen to standardize responders across batches of CAR Tregs. We find that irradiated aAPCs are too strong of a stimulus for Treg suppression assays, so the T cell Activation/Expansion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) is used instead. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for an example of the plate setup.
