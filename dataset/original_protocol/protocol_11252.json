  "procedures": [
    "The protocol described here has been approved by the National Animal Ethics Committee of Finland (protocol number ESAVI/23659/2018).\n1. Experimental Animals, Reagents, and Equipment\nUse age and sex-matched mice. Start the study at 7–9 weeks of age, because the skin in most mice is in telogen (the resting phase) around that age2.\nObserve the behavior of the animals during the study and if they fight, which often happens with males, house them separately. Fights may cause cuts in the skin, which promote tumor formation. Female mice are preferred due to their less aggressive behavior. The typical experimental group size varies between 8–20 animals per group24,25,26,27.\nNOTE: Power calculations based on the biological variance seen in earlier studies help to choose a sufficiently large group size. The strains used as examples in this article include Balb/c and C57BL/6. However, many other mouse strains such as SENCAR and FVB have been used with the DMBA-TPA-model, as well as Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats2,28,29. A license from the national or local committee of animal work is needed before the initiation of the study. In addition to general welfare considerations, the model-specific endpoints are typically squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and an infection of the skin. Scratches in the skin due to itching after application of the tumorigenic chemicals in acetone is typical but otherwise the animals should show no signs of discomfort. Weighing regularly (e.g., 2x a month) helps evaluate the animals' welfare.\nUse the DMBA and TPA, both diluted in acetone. The working concentration of DMBA is 250 g/L. A dose for one animal is 50 µg of DMBA in 200 µL of acetone. The stock concentration of TPA is 125 g/L and the treatment concentration 25 g/L. A TPA dose for one animal is 5 µg in 200 µL of acetone.",
    "CAUTION: DMBA is harmful if swallowed and may cause cancer. Acetone evaporates rapidly and is flammable. It may cause dizziness and irritate eyes. Use a breathing mask and/or work under a vacuum flow. Change gloves after handling any of these chemicals. Individually ventilated cages prevent the spread of the chemicals during housing of the mice. After application, gather the pipette tips used for handling the DMBA and dispose as dangerous waste.\nNOTE: The DMBA must be protected from light. The diluted TPA is stored in -20 °C, preferably protected from light.\nProcure the following equipment: a scale, an ordinary shaver for the fur, pipettes and tips of an appropriate size, an ordinary ruler, a digital camera, a notepad and a pen or a computer for recording the papillomas, an inhaled anesthesia system or a mouse restrainer with an opening on the back top, and a carbon dioxide narcosis system for sacrificing mice.\n2. Skin Papilloma Induction and Promotion\nShave the back skin and weigh the animal. Later, shave the skin whenever needed but not at the time of the chemical exposure.\nNOTE: Be careful when shaving around the papillomas and avoid making any cuts on the skin. Weigh each animal every 2 weeks to notice any potential weight loss.\nApply 50 µg of DMBA in 200 µL of acetone topically on the shaved area using a pipette 48 h after shaving the fur. If needed, restrain the animal using light inhalation anesthesia or a mouse restrainer.\nAfter 7 days, give the first TPA dose. Apply 5 µg of TPA in 200 µL of acetone topically with a pipette 2x a week, preferably Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.",
    "Count, record, and photograph the papillomas every week. A palpable mass greater than 1 mm in diameter is considered a papilloma if it stays longer than 1 week. Mark each individual papilloma on a map and list its size every week. Store digital photographs.\n3. Animal Sacrifice and Sample Collection\nContinue the treatment until the tumor response reaches a plateau. Generally, the papilloma burden is expected to increase 10–20 weeks after the initiation, depending on the mouse strain used. The plateau is expected in 15–20 weeks. A small proportion of the papillomas (under 3%) can develop into SCCs within 20–50 weeks2.\nSacrifice the animals 24 h after the last TPA application. Use carbon dioxide narcosis with cervical dislocation or another suitable method.\nDepending on the research question, gather appropriate sample material from the animals30,31.\n\t\nFor example, take blood samples before sacrifice and separate the plasma.\nCut pieces of the skin for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (e.g., hematoxylin and eosin, proliferating or inflammatory cells).\nUse biopsy punches to collect skin pieces with either papilloma tissue or non-papilloma (treated) skin for gene expression (e.g., qPCR) and/or protein analyses (e.g., Western blot or ELISA).\nCollect a piece of the spleen and skin-draining lymph nodes for flow cytometry analysis if more detailed analysis of the immune cell populations is desired. You may also separate epidermal and dermal layers for further analyses.\n4. Statistics\nDraw a Kaplan-Meier survival curve of the papilloma-free time and use the Mantel-Cox log-rank test for the survival. Draw a linear curve of the number of papillomas per week. Because this is count data, use a nonlinear regression model. Consult a statistician if needed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
