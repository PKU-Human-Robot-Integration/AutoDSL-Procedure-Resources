    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLabel proteins with low-methionine and AHA-infused chow\nTiming: 11–18 days\nIn this step, animals are put on a low-methionine chow to deplete methionine prior to the AHA “pulse” labeling period. Following the labeling period, regular control chow is reintroduced to eliminate any further incorporation of AHA. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] is a visual representation of the experimental timeline.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2985-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Timeline and experimental design of the pulse-chase labeling strategy for WB-QUAD and IHC-QUAD1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nSwitch chow in cages of experimental animals to low-methionine pellets. Maintain control animals on regular chow.\nTransfer mice to a clean cage prior to beginning the low-methionine chow to control for any leftover chow that may be buried in the bedding material.\nProvide the low-methionine chow and water ad libitum for 7 days.\nNote: Approximately 3 grams of chow per mouse per day is sufficient. Use this information as a guide to avoid having to discard large quantities of partially eaten chow.\nAfter 7 days of low-methionine chow, switch chow in the cages of the experimental animals to the AHA-infused pellets for the “pulse” labeling period. Maintain control animals on regular chow.\nTransfer mice to a clean cage prior to beginning AHA chow to control for any leftover chow that may be buried in the bedding material.\nProvide the AHA-infused chow and water ad libitum for 4 days.\nAfter 4 days of AHA-infused chow, switch chow in cages to regular control pellets for the 3–7 day “chase” period.\nTransfer mice to a clean cage prior to beginning regular control chow to control for any leftover chow that may be buried in the bedding material.\nProvide the regular control chow and water ad libitum for 3–7 days.",
    "Note: The rationale for selecting the indicated pulse and chase durations can be found in the parent manuscript, Steinert et al. (2023).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nHarvesting muscles for WB-QUAD and IHC-QUAD\nTiming: 15–20 min per mouse\nMuscles that will be used for WB-QUAD and IHC-QUAD are collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or liquid nitrogen-chilled isopentane, respectively.\nPrepare the surgery area for muscle harvesting.\nLabel 1.5 mL microfuge tubes for all muscles being harvested for WB-QUAD.\nFill a small Dewar with liquid nitrogen to freeze down muscles following harvest.\nPrepare the chamber for freezing down IHC-QUAD muscles.\nPlace a small volume (50–70 mL) of isopentane in a 250–300 mL plastic beaker with a lid. A foam ice bucket can serve as an excellent chamber for this procedure.\nChill the isopentane by adding liquid nitrogen to the chamber containing the plastic beaker.\nNote: Be sure that the liquid nitrogen level is at least half of the level of the isopentane to ensure adequate cooling (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPrepare a surface to measure the length of the muscle. A paper towel wetted with deionized water works well.\nAnesthetize the mouse.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2985-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Illustration of the setup and procedure for freezing muscles for IHC-QUAD\n(A) Chamber for freezing muscles in OCT for IHC-QUAD. The plastic beaker is filled with a small volume of isopentane. Liquid nitrogen has been added to the bottom of the chamber surrounding the plastic beaker to chill the isopentane. Note the layer of frozen isopentane that is visible on the interior periphery of the beaker whereas the center contains isopentane in a liquid state.\n(B) TA muscle that has been excised at resting length.",
    "(C) TA muscle in 20°C–22°C OCT immediately before the embedding mold is placed in the chilled isopentane. Note that the TA is fully submerged in the OCT and it is oriented such that the long axis of the muscle is parallel to the side walls of the embedding mold.\n(D) Block of frozen OCT containing the TA muscle that has been removed from the embedding mold, and placed on aluminum foil prior to storage at −80°C.\nPrime the induction chamber using an isoflurane anesthesia apparatus; vapor setting 2.5–4% and oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min.\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber and wait until the mouse is fully anesthetized and unresponsive to a pedal pinch.\nPrepare the animal for the surgical procedure.\nTransfer the mouse from the induction chamber to the nose cone to maintain anesthesia.\nShave the fur from the lower leg.\nHarvest the TA muscle for WB-QUAD.\nOpen the skin on the anterior aspect of the lower limb and expose the TA muscle.\nCarefully excise the TA muscle from the mouse.\nOptional: Weigh the muscle and record the mass\nQuickly transfer the TA muscle to the labeled 1.5 mL microfuge tube and drop the closed microfuge tube into the Dewar of liquid nitrogen to flash freeze the sample.\nUpon completion of the muscle harvest, transfer the samples to a storage vessel in a freezer set at −80°C.\nNote: Exercise caution during the excision of the TA muscle so that unnecessarily large amounts of force are not placed on the tissue.\nHarvest the contralateral TA muscle for IHC-QUAD.\nBefore excising the TA muscle, check the isopentane for the presence of a layer of frozen isopentane with a pool of liquid isopentane in the center of the plastic beaker.",
    "If the isopentane has frozen completely, remove the beaker from the liquid nitrogen and allow some of the frozen isopentane to return to its liquid state.\nNote: There must be enough liquid isopentane in the beaker to fully submerge the embedding mold (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nOpen the skin on the anterior aspect of the lower limb and expose the TA muscle.\nCarefully excise the TA muscle from the mouse.\nPlace the muscle on a moist paper towel, very slightly stretch the muscle out and then allow it to rebound to its resting length. Measure and record the length of the muscle (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPlace a 5–6 mm deep layer of OCT in the embedding mold and drag the muscle through the OCT to fully submerge it.\nMaintain the muscle parallel to the sidewalls of the embedding mold.\nNote: Dragging the muscle through the OCT will help to keep it on a straight axis and at/near its measured resting length (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nUse long forceps to place the embedding mold into the liquid nitrogen-chilled isopentane to freeze the muscle.\nKeep the embedding mold submerged in the isopentane for at least 30 s to ensure that the muscle is fully frozen, thereby avoiding freeze damage.\nRemove the frozen block of OCT from the embedding mold, package it in labeled aluminum foil, and transfer it to a storage vessel in a freezer set at −80°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPause point: Muscles can be stored at −80°C for at least 6 months.\nHomogenize muscles for WB-QUAD\nTiming: 30–45 min\nWhole muscle homogenates are used to determine the rate of protein degradation with western blotting.\nPrepare materials for the homogenization process. It is important to work quickly once homogenization has started, thus preparing all necessary materials in advance will aid in a smooth process.",
    "Label one 14 mL snap cap Falcon round bottom test tube for each sample that will be homogenized.\nFill an insulated container with ice to hold the labeled Falcon tubes.\nAliquot the amount of Urea/Tris lysis buffer necessary for the volume of Urea/Tris lysis buffer + inhibitors that will be used to homogenize all of the samples and chill on ice.\nNote: Do not chill the buffer for too long or the urea will come out of solution. If you notice that the urea has come out of solution warm the solution slightly and it will go back into solution.\nFill a small Dewar with liquid nitrogen.\nRemove frozen muscle samples from the −80°C freezer and transfer them to the Dewar filled with liquid nitrogen.\nMake Urea/Tris lysis buffer + inhibitors, and immediately following the addition of PMSF add 0.75 mL of the buffer to each of the labeled Falcon tubes.\nCritical: The Urea/Tris lysis buffer + inhibitors should be used within 15 min of adding the PMSF to the solution.\nNote: The volume of buffer needed to homogenize the samples will depend on the size and subsequent protein concentration of the muscle. For example, our lab typically uses 0.75 mL for the TA muscle which will produce a protein concentration of ⁓11 μg/μL.\nHomogenize samples.\nRemove one 1.5 mL microfuge tube containing a single sample from the liquid nitrogen with long forceps and then quickly place the sample in the corresponding Falcon tube that already contains cold Urea/Tris lysis buffer + inhibitors.\nUsing a Polytron homogenizer at full speed, homogenize the sample taking care to move the tube both vertically and horizontally to break up the whole sample leaving behind no large chunks.\nNote: This step should take no longer than 15–20 s.",
    "Replace the cap and return the Falcon tube to the ice.\nRepeat steps 10. a - 10. c with the remaining samples until all samples have been homogenized.\nNote: The probe of the polytron should be washed thoroughly with deionized water between samples. Flush the inside of the probe and visually inspect for any unhomogenized sample. Make sure the probe is dry before homogenizing the next sample.\nNote: Samples should be homogenized in batches with approximately 6 samples per batch. Fresh Urea/Tris lysis buffer + inhibitors should be made for each batch to restart the 15-min interval during which the PMSF is viable. Samples from all experimental groups should be present in each batch to ensure that any potential batch variance is distributed across all of the groups.\nCentrifuge the homogenized samples at 6000 × g for 2 min at 20°C–22°C. This will result in a layer of dense foam on the top of the supernatant.\nCheck for any remaining chunks in the pellet.\nIf there are unhomogenized pieces of muscle remaining, repeat step 10. b.\nVortex the homogenized samples to break up the layer of foam.\nCentrifuge at 6000 × g again for 2 min.\nRepeat steps 10. f and 10.g until the foam layer is gone and has become incorporated into the homogenate. This may take as many as 6 repetitions.\nMeasure and standardize the sample protein concentrations\nTiming: 30–45 min\nWhen preparing samples for the ‘click’ reaction it is important to standardize the protein concentration for all of the samples so that each ‘click’ reaction for each sample contains the same amount of Urea/Tris lysis buffer + inhibitors.\nUse 1.5 μL of the homogenate to measure the protein concentration of each sample using the BioRad DC protein assay with BSA standards.",
    "Add 1.5 μL Urea/Tris stock solution to each of the BSA standards and also use this solution as the blank on the plate.\nWhile the protein assay is incubating, label two additional microfuge tubes for each sample.\nNote: The accuracy of the protein concentration measurements is critical when calculating the total amount of AHA-labeled proteins per sample. Thus, to minimize variance, all samples should be measured in triplicate and, whenever possible, all samples for a given experiment should be measured within a single assay.\nOnce the protein concentrations have been determined for each sample, transfer 100 μL of each sample to one of the newly labeled microfuge tubes.\nDilute each sample to a final concentration of 8 μg/μL using the leftover Urea/Tris lysis buffer + inhibitors.\nIn the other labeled tube, take 80 μL of the 8 μg/μL stock prepared in step 14 and dilute it to a final concentration of 1.15 μg/μL by adding 476.5 μL of DPBS.\nPerform the ‘click’ reaction on the sample homogenates\nTiming: 75–90 min\nThe ‘click’ reaction will covalently bind a biotin tag to the AHA on the AHA-labeled proteins as explained in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2985-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Visualization of AHA incorporation using a ‘click’ reaction",
    "AHA is a methionine analog that possesses a reactive azide group. During translation, AHA can be incorporated into newly synthesized proteins. The newly synthesized proteins can contain multiple AHAs and each AHA can be covalently bound to an alkyne-bearing probe via a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (i.e., ‘click’ reaction). In WB-QUAD, an alkyne-bearing probe that is conjugated to biotin is used to tag the AHA, and then streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase along with enhanced chemiluminescence is used to visualize and quantify the amount of AHA-labeled proteins in tissue lysates. Similarly, with IHC-QUAD, an alkyne-bearing probe that is conjugated to a fluorophore (e.g., AZDye 594) is used to tag the AHA-labeled proteins and then a fluorescence microscope is used to visualize and quantify the amount of AHA-labeled proteins in histological sections.\nPerform the ‘click’ reaction.\nLabel a new microfuge tube for each sample that will be subjected to the WB-QUAD ‘click’ reaction.\nMake fresh WB-QUAD ‘click’ reaction master mix in a volume suitable for the number of samples being used.\nFor each sample, combine 27 μL of the WB-QUAD ‘click’ reaction master mix with 173 μL of the diluted (1.15 μg/μL) sample.\nVortex each sample thoroughly.\nNote: The final concentration for the components of the WB-QUAD ‘click’ reaction when added to the sample (total volume = 200 μL) are as follows: TBTA (127.5 μM), Copper Sulfate (1 mM), Biotin PEG4-alkyne (40 μM), and TCEP (1 mM).\nNote: The ‘click’ reactions should be processed in batches with approximately 6 samples per batch. Samples from all experimental groups should be present in each batch to ensure that any potential batch variance is distributed across all of the groups.\nIncubate samples for 1 h on a 25 RPM nutating rotator at 20°C–22°C protected from light.",
    "Pause point: At the end of the incubation period the samples can be flash frozen, returned to the freezer at −80°C, and stored for a short time (⁓1 week).\nResolve the AHA-labeled proteins with western blotting\nTiming: 2 days\nThe Western blot protocol allows for quantification of the amount of total protein and the amount of AHA-labeled proteins in each lane. With these values, the AHA-labeled protein to total protein ratio can be calculated for each sample. With samples that were collected immediately after the AHA “pulse” period (i.e., Day 0), as well as samples that were collected at 3 and 7 days into the chase period, one can calculate the time-dependent loss of AHA-labeled proteins (i.e., the rate of protein degradation).\nMake or purchase 10% polyacrylamide gels.\nPause point: A separating gel can be prepared and stored at 4°C the day before the western blot is run. Be sure to bring the gel to 20°C–22°C before adding the stacking gel.\nPrepare the samples.\nCombine 26.25 μL of a thawed ‘click’ reaction aliquot with 8.75 μL of 4x Laemmli buffer that contains the freshly added DTT.\nHeat samples in boiling water for 5 min.\nSeparate proteins using SDS-PAGE.\nLoad 30 μL of each of the prepared samples to designated wells on the gel.\nPlace the loaded gel into the electrophoresis apparatus and fill it with Tris-Glycine running buffer as instructed by the manufacturer.\nSeparate samples by running at 100 V for 1.5 h or until the dye front has reached the bottom of the gel.\nTransfer proteins to a PVDF membrane.\nWet the PVDF membrane in a chamber containing methanol for 5 min with continuous agitation on an orbital shaker at 60 RPM.\nNote: All washes and blocking should be performed at 20°C–22°C.",
    "After 5 min, replace the methanol in the chamber with transfer buffer and then return the chamber to the orbital shaker at 60 RPM.\nWet the transfer filter paper and the sponges with transfer buffer.\nGently remove the gel from the running apparatus and build the sandwich of materials for transfer as follows: sponge, filter paper, gel, PVDF membrane, filter paper, sponge.\nPlace the transfer sandwich into the transfer apparatus with the gel oriented closest to the cathode and the membrane oriented closest to the anode.\nPerform a wet transfer at 300 milliamps for 1 h and 45 min in transfer buffer.\nOnce the transfer is complete, wash the PVDF membrane for 3 × 5 min in diH2O at 200 RPM on an orbital shaker.\nVisualize the total protein content in each lane using the “no-stain” labeling protocol.\nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions to complete the “no stain” labeling procedure.\nImage the labeled membrane with an appropriate imaging system.\nNote: The “no-stain” fluorescent signal has an emission maximum at   ∼   590 nm. The fluorophore can be excited using a UV light transilluminator or a blue or green light source.\nCapture the fluorescent signal with an appropriate emission filter while ensuring that the captured image(s) are not overexposed.\nContinue running the western blot to visualize the AHA-labeled proteins.\nWash the membrane for 3 × 5 min in diH2O at 200 RPM on an orbital shaker.\nBlock the membrane with 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at 60 RPM on an orbital shaker.\nWash the membrane 3 × 10 min with TBST at 200 RPM on an orbital shaker.\nIncubate the membrane with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin diluted at 1:100000 in 1% a BSA-TBST for 12–16 h on a 25 RPM nutating rotator at 4°C.",
    "Wash the membrane for 2 × 5 min then 2 × 10 min in TBST at 200 RPM on an orbital shaker.\nUse enhanced chemiluminescence along with an appropriate imaging system to capture image(s) of the membrane and ensure that the captured image(s) are not overexposed.\nIHC-QUAD\nTiming: 6–8 h\nUsing IHC analysis will allow for the quantification of AHA at the whole muscle section and myofiber-specific levels. By having samples collected immediately after the AHA “pulse” period, as well as samples that were collected at 3 and 7 days into the chase period, one can calculate the time-dependent loss of AHA-labeled proteins (i.e., the rate of protein degradation). The samples should be processed in batches with approximately 6 samples per batch. Samples from all experimental groups should be present in each batch to ensure that any potential batch variance is distributed across all of the groups.\nPrepare the slides.\nUsing a cryostat set to −20°C, cut 10 μm thick sections from the mid-belly (determined using the recorded muscle length) of the muscles that were frozen in OCT.\nMount the sections on microscope slides with one section per slide.\nComplete the immunohistochemical staining procedure.\nFix sections in acetone for 10 min.\nPrior to fixing the sections, chill the acetone to −20°C in a Coplin staining jar.\nWhen acetone is chilled, add the slides to the vessel and fix for 10 min.\nAfter fixation, allow the sections to dry and warm to 20°C–22°C for 5 min.\nUse a PAP pen to draw a hydrophobic circle around the sample.\nAlternatives: Paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation can also be used and is compatible with the ‘click’ reactions outlined in these methods.\nWash the sections for 3 × 5 min with DPBS at 20°C–22°C on an orbital shaker at 50 RPM.",
    "Note: All subsequent washes and incubations should be performed at 20°C–22°C on an orbital shaker at 50 RPM.\nIncubate the sections with Buffer A for 30 min\nWash the sections 3× 10 min with DPBS. Prepare the IHC-QUAD ‘click’ reaction master mix during the last wash.\nNote: When preparing the IHC-QUAD ‘click’ reaction master mix, vortex the solution after the addition of each component (i.e., add TBTA then vortex, add copper then vortex, etc…).\nImmediately after the final vortexing, add 50 μL of the IHC-QUAD ‘click’ reaction master mix to each sample and incubate for 1 h protected from light.\nNote: At this point, look at the sample(s) with a light microscope. Fine precipitates should be visible.\nWash the sections for 6 × 5 min alternating between DPBS (3x) and Buffer A (3x).\nWash the sections for 1 × 5 min then 1 × 20 min with Buffer A containing 10% DMSO and 5 mM EDTA pH 8.8.\nWash the sections for 3 × 5 min with DPBS.\nNote: At this point, look at the sample(s) with a light microscope. The precipitates that were previously visible should be gone.\nIncubate the sections with 50 μL of rabbit anti-laminin primary antibody diluted at 1:500 in Buffer A for 1 h.\nWash the sections for 3 × 5 min with Buffer A.\nIncubate the sections with 50 μL of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody diluted at 1:5000 in Buffer A for 1 h.\nWash the sections for 3 × 5 min with Buffer A.\nCapture images of the signals for the Alexa Fluor 488 and AZDye 594 on an epifluorescence microscope and ensure that the captured images are not overexposed.",
    "Critical: Images for all of the samples from all of the batches should be captured with identical settings on the microscope (e.g., magnification, exposure time, excitation light intensity, etc…)."
