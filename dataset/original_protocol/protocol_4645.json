    "Day 1In a sterile laminar flow hood, add 40 µl/well fibronectin (10 µg/ml in PBS) to a 96-well µClear plate. Transfer the plate to a cell culture incubator and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.Aspirate fibronectin without scratching the surface, and wash twice with PBS (preferentially using plate washer). Add 100 µl PBS per well and proceed to the next step.Swirl the stock flask of CML latex beads and aliquot 250 µl beads (approximately 3.25 x 1011 particles) per plate and spin down at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Discard supernatant and resuspend bead pellet in 1 ml PBS. Vortex for 1 min and spin down at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend bead pellet in 1 ml PBS. Transfer resuspended beads to 15 or 50 ml tube and add PBS to a final beads suspension volume of 7 ml per plate.Remove PBS from fibronectin-coated plate without scratching the surface and add 70 µl beads per well. Visually check the plate and make sure the surface of the well is completely covered with beads and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.Use plate-washer and gently wash 7 times with PBS (200 µl per well). If no plate-washer is available, carefully wash the plate manually using a multichannel and ensure the bead-coated surface is not scratched. After washing, add 100 µl PBS per well.Wrap the plate in parafilm and store plate at 4 °C for next day use.We would advise to prepare fresh beads for each experiment (as explained above) and avoid storage for long period.Day 2Carefully aspirate PBS from bead-coated plate and replace with 100 µl complete medium.Prepare cells (e.g., from culture flask, or after siRNA transfection) and resuspend into single cell suspension.",
    "Seed 50-200 cells in a 50 µl single cell suspension (depending on cell size & migration capacity) and return plate to cell culture incubator. The final volume is 150 μl (100 µl complete medium + 50 µl single cell suspension) in which 50-200 cells will be allowed to form single-cell migration tracks.We recommend that cells are allowed to attach for 1 h before adding chemical compounds or inhibitors.Depending on migration capacity, fixate cells after 7-12 h of cell migration by removing 140 µl medium from the plate and adding 70 µl 4% formaldehyde (final formaldehyde concentration is 3.5%). Fixate for 10 min at RT.Wash plate twice with PBS (200 µl per well) without scratching the bead-coated surface.Wrap the plate in parafilm and store at 4 °C until imaging.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160103/20160103233636_5998.jpgFigure 1. Microscopy set up of PhagoKinetic track assay. A. Non-homogenous illumination in the original brightfield image is minimized by adding a light diffuser (tip box lid), providing a clear image with equal intensities. B. A seamless montage of the largest square without cell borders (red box) allows the user to record a maximal number of complete cell tracks.Imaging and analysisUse a brightfield microscope with 10x objective to visualize bead-free migratory tracks. Whole-well montages were obtained as followed: The transmitted light source is above the 96-plate. For equal illumination, place a tipbox lid on top of the plate to diffuse the light (see Figure 1a).Use laser autofocus in each well to focus before acquisition.Use montage-settings to acquire the largest montage of the well without imaging well-borders (example in Figure 1b).Use Montage2MRC to convert all montages of one plate into a single r6d-file, following the software instructions.Run PhagoTracker software and analyse images according to the software guidelines (Figure 2a-b).",
    "The PhagoTracker user guide is very detailed and contains a myriad of information to optimize your image analysis. Briefly, the following settings were used:In pre-processing, set Correct Illumination to ‘Non’.Use a High Pass & Low Pass filter, and set the Adjust Contrast to ‘Whole Well’.For Track Detection, we use the recommended threshold settings. Depending on gray values, overall intensity, cell size and track size, you might need to find optimal settings.Use Track Filtering to reject tracks without cells and to reject tracks with more than 1 cell. Briefly, the software detects bright objects (migratory paths) and dark objects (cells). It subsequently determines whether each migratory path is accepted (1 path with 1 cell) or rejected (1 path with 0 cells, or 1 path with >1 cells). Tracks can also be manually accepted or rejected after analysis. This is not necessary if the image analysis parameters are set correctly.PhagoTracker calculates multiple morphometric features for each migratory track, including Total Area, Net Area, Minor Axis, Major Axis, Axial Ratio and Perimeter as measurements of track size and shape. Furthermore, the Solidity and Roughness of each track are calculated, which represent membrane activity and ruffling during migration (Figure 2c-d). The software generates 2 files with quantitative output: one file contains data of all accepted individual tracks, the other contains average values and standard deviations of accepted, rejected and all tracks per well. Quantitative output can be further analysed using PhagoTracker (see user guide), or processed using preferred programs, like Excel, Graphpad, R or KNIME. To automate your analysis, KNIME is recommended. This open-source software contains a plethora of ready-to-use analysis nodes, including a plate lay out joiner, different normalization methods (Z-score, B-score, NPI, POC, etc.) and plotting tools (2D/3D scatter plot, etc.), to build an analysis pipeline.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160103/20160103233657_8471.jpgFigure 2.",
    "PhagoTracker software and image analysis procedure. A. The PhagoTracker software interface. B. PhagoTracker software performs image analysis in several steps. Images are pre-processed to enhance contrast and correct illumination. Multi-Scale segmentation finds candidate cell and path segments (shown in orange and blue, respectively) which are subsequently combined into track segments. The candidate tracks are filtered based on the selection criteria and are marked as confirmed (in red) or rejected (in blue). C. Representative images of Hs578T breast cancer cells. Control cells show large elongated tracks with a rough border. Cells with siRNA knockdown (KD) do not migrate and form round tracks. D. Quantification of individual tracks shown in C. Solidity is calculated as (track area/ area of the convex hull) and roughness as (perimeter2) / (4π*Total Area)."
