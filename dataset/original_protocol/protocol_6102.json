    "Preparation of IR-labeled probeDissolve azide-containing DNA oligonucleotide with double distilled H2O (ddH2O). Final DNA concentration is 100 µM.Combine 2.5 nmole oligos with 50 nmole IRDye 680RD or 800CW DBCO in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in total volume of 50 µl.Note: From this point on, the probe should be kept away from light. Incubate reaction at room temperature for 6 h.Note: Incubation was performed without agitation/shaking. We have also incubated overnight with no loss of yield. However, we have not determined the minimal incubation time for sufficient labeling. Add 2 volumes of AMPure XP beads and 5.4 volumes of isopropanol; mix well by pipetting up and down 10 times.Incubate at room temperature for 7½ min. Remix, incubate for another 7½ min.Place beads on magnet stand. After beads settle, remove the supernatant. Wash twice with freshly prepared 85% ethanol.Elute in 100 µl of ddH2O; move the eluate to a new tube.Use NanoDrop to measure 1 µl and determine DNA concentration. Typical recovery efficiency is 70-90%.Alternative probe preparation I–prepare DNA probe using terminal transferasePrepare 30 µl terminal transferase (TdT) reaction in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube with 1x Terminal Transferase Reaction Buffer, 0.25 mM CoCl2, 100 pmoles of DNA oligo (no internal azide), 300 pmoles of 5-Azidomethyl-dUTP, 20 U of TdT, and ddH2O.Note: Reaction can be scaled up for preparing a large batch of probes. However, we recommend small scale TdT reaction with different probe:5-Azidomethyl-dUTP ratios to estimate labeling efficiency first. Incubate reaction at 37 °C for 1 h in ThermoMixer C.Note: Incubation was performed without agitation/shaking. Follow Steps A4-A7 to purify the DNA using AMPure XP beads.Elute in 20 µl of ddH2O; move the eluate to a new tube.Measure DNA concentration by loading 1 µl on a NanoDrop.",
    "Label 19 µl of probe with 10 nmole IRDyes 680RD or 800CW DBCO in 1x PBS diluted in ddH2O.Note: Make sure the molar ratio between IR dye and probe is greater than 10:1. Incubate at room temperature for 6 h.Follow Steps A4-A7 to purify the probe using AMPure XP beads.Elute in 15 µl of ddH2O. Run entire IR-labeled oligo eluate on an 8 M urea 15% polyacrylamide gel and run 10 pmoles of unlabeled oligo.Note: It is important to run unlabeled probe to estimate how many nucleotides have been added by TdT reaction. Detect IR signal on Li-Cor Odyssey CLX Scanner (Figure 1A).Stain the gel with 1x SYBR Green I and visualize the signal in ImageQuant 300 Imager (Figure 1A).Match IR image and SYBR Green I staining image to determine the most prominently-labeled probes. Excise the gel slice containing the most prominently-labeled probes.Place gel pieces in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and elute overnight at room temperature in 600 µl 1:1 RNA Elution Buffer:Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl Alcohol with gentle rotation on a rotating mixer.Transfer the liquid to a new 1.5 ml tube.Vortex for 30 s and spin at 21,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Transfer the aqueous phase to a new 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.Add 300 µl of chloroform, vortex for 30 s, and spin at 21,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Transfer the aqueous phase to a new 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.Note: We recommend adding 15 µg of glycogen to co-precipitate with the DNA and help visualize the pellet. Add 1 ml cold 100% ethanol and incubate at -80 °C for 15 min.Spin at 21,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Remove all the solution and air-dry the pellet for ~3 min or until dry.Resuspend RNA in 22 µl of ddH2O.",
    "Quantify 1 µl of RNA using NanoDrop.Alternative Probe Preparation II–generate RNA probes using T7 run-off TranscriptionDesign and prepare PCR templates containing a T7 promoter to be used in a T7 run-off transcription reaction.Incubate overnight at 37 °C a 10 µl reaction containing 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 mM NaCl, 2 mM Spermidine (HCl)3, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM total UTP (3:1 ratio of UTP:5-azido-C3-UTP), 1 mM GTP, 1 mM CTP, 20 U Murine RNase Inhibitor, 10 mM DTT, and 4 U T7 RNA polymerase.Note: Reaction can be scaled up for preparing a large batch of probes. However, we recommend several small scale T7 in vitro transcriptions with different UTP:5-azido-C3-UTP ratios to estimate transcription and subsequent IR dye labeling efficiency first. Separate the in vitro transcribed RNAs using an 8 M urea 6% polyacrylamide gel and detect the RNA by UV shadowing, followed by excision of the gel slice containing the RNA.Place the gel slice in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and elute overnight at room temperature in 600 µl 1:1 RNA Elution Buffer:Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl Alcohol with gentle rotation on a rotating mixer.Follow Steps B15-B24 to extract and ethanol precipitate the RNA.Label RNA probe with IRDye 680RD or 800CW DBCO as described in Steps B6-B7.Purify by AMPure XP beads as described in Steps A4-A7.Elute in 15 µl of ddH2O. Run entire IR-labeled RNA eluate on an 8 M urea 6% polyacrylamide gel.Detect IR signal on Li-Cor Odyssey CLX Scanner (Figure 1B).Stain the gel with 1x SYBR Green I and visualize the signal with ImageQuant 300 Imager (Figure 1B).Excise the labeled probes.Place gel pieces in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and elute overnight at room temperature in 600 µl 1:1 RNA Elution Buffer:Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl Alcohol with gentle rotation on rotating mixer.",
    "Follow Steps B15-B24 to extract and ethanol precipitate the RNA probe.TRIzol extraction of RNACulture HCT116 and HCT116 Drosha knockout cells in a 6-well plate in McCoy’s 5A Media with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin.When confluent, remove media and rinse cells with 1x PBS. Collect cells in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and pellet at 1,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.Remove bulk of the supernatant, briefly resuspend cells in the residual (~20-30 µl) 1x PBS.Note: If TRIzol is added to a dry cell pellet, the cells will not lyse completely. Add 1 ml of TRIzol to each cell pellet collected from one well and vortex for 30 s.Add 200 µl of chloroform, vortex for 30 s and spin at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the aqueous phase (about 550 µl) to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Precipitate the RNA by adding equal volume (550 µl) of isopropanol and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.Spin at 21,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, a white pellet should form at the bottom of the tube.Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 1 ml of cold 75% ethanol.Spin at 21,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant, air-dry pellet for ~3 min, and resuspend RNA in 20 µl of ddH2O.Mix 1 µl of RQ1 DNase with 5 µl 10x DNase RQ1 buffer and 24 µl ddH2O and add mix to RNA.Incubate reaction at 37 °C for 30 min.Bring volume to 300 µl with ddH2O and add 300 µl of Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl Alcohol.Follow Steps B16-B24 to extract and ethanol precipitate the total RNA. Glycogen could be omitted.",
    "Urea-PAGE, transfer, and Northern blotMix 15-20 µg of total RNA sample with equal volume of 2x Formamide Loading Dye, heat samples at 95 °C for 3 min, immediately place on ice, and separate RNA on an 8 M urea 15% polyacrylamide gel.Transfer the gel at 300 mAmps for 1 h to Hybond N+ membrane using Owl HEP Series semidry electroblotting system.Note: Alternatively, RNAs separated by Urea-PAGE could be transferred using wet-transfer system (RNA: a laboratory manual, Chapter 3, Protocol 11). If RNAs were separated on an agarose gel, traditional capillary transfer method should be used (RNA: a laboratory manual, Chapter 3, Protocol 9). Briefly dry membrane on a paper towel and crosslink membrane twice using 254 nm UV crosslinker at 120 mJ/cm2.In the hybridization oven, pre-hybridize the membrane in a hybridization tube with 10 ml ExpressHyb hybridization solution for 30 min at 30 °C.Remove the pre-hybridization solution and hybridize overnight at 30 °C with 10 pmoles IR probe diluted in 10 ml ExpressHyb hybridization solution.Notes: If different probes have been labeled with different IRDyes, they can be combined together to detect different RNAs simultaneously. Hybridization temperature should be adjusted for different probes, ~20 °C below calculated Tm. We recommend a hybridization temperature of 30 °C for miRNAs. When using RNA probes, we typically perform hybridization at 65 °C overnight, with no loss of signal due to temperature. Collect diluted probe in a 15 ml centrifuge tube and store at -20 °C.Note: Probes can be reused several times without significant loss of signal. Place membrane in a clean glass tray and add 2x SSC (Saline-sodium citrate)-0.1% SDS Wash Buffer to wash the membrane.Note: Submerge the membrane under ~1 cm solution. Shake at 110 rpm for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Note: Washing temperature can be adjusted for different probes, depending on the Tm between the probe and the target. Perform second wash with 1x SSC-0.1% SDS Wash Buffer for 10 min at room temperature with shaking at 110 rpm.Note: If higher washing stringency is desired, continue with washing buffer containing lower SSC concentration and higher SDS concentration. Briefly tap dry the membrane with paper towels.Image on Li-Cor Odyssey CLX Scanner to detect emission at 700 nm and/or 800 nm (Figure 1C).To strip the probes off the membrane; place membrane in a glass tray, pour microwave boiled 0.1x SSC-1% SDS-40 nM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, shake at 110 rpm for 10 min at room temperature.Repeat strip procedure (Step E12), dry membrane with paper towels, and store in sheet protector.Note: Membrane can be stored for years and re-probed later."
