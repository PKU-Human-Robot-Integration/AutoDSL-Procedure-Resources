    "This protocol outlines a plaque assay method that can be used for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 plaque-forming units (PFUs) in virus specimens, including viral stocks prepared from infected cell culture supernatants, and with further optimization, bodily fluids from animals infected with SARS-CoV-2. In brief, 10-fold serial dilutions of specimens containing an unknown amount of SARS-CoV-2 are adsorbed onto a monolayer of susceptible cells. After adsorption, a solid overlay medium (S-OM) is applied to the cell monolayer to restrict virus growth to the originally infected foci of cells. These foci develop into plaques, which are visualized after the addition of a secondary S-OM containing neutral red, which is incorporated and bound by lysosomes in viable cells (Repetto, del Peso, & Zurita, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-bib-0013]). As a result, clear plaques can be distinguished from the brownish-red uninfected monolayer. Plaques are enumerated and used for the calculation of virus titers in PFU/ml.\nMaterials\nVero E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™)\nCell maintenance medium (see recipe)\nGibco™ Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%), with phenol red (ThermoFisher Scientific #25200072)\nInfection medium (see recipe)\nSpecimens to be assayed for virus\nGibco™ DPBS, no calcium, no magnesium (ThermoFisher Scientific #14190144)\nOverlay diluent (see recipe)\n2% Noble agar (NA; solid matrix, see recipe)\n0.33% neutral red (NR; see recipe)\nMicro-Chem Plus Disinfectant Detergent (National Chemical Laboratories #C849T34)\nClass II biological safety cabinet\n150-cm2 (T-150) culture flasks (Corning™ #430825 or equivalent)\nCO2 incubator (Heracell™ 150i CO2 incubator with stainless-steel chamber, or equivalent)\nLight microscope\nFalcon 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes (Corning™ #C352098 or equivalent)\nCountess II automated cell counter (or equivalent)\nCostar® 6-well plates (Corning™ #3506 or equivalent)\n2-ml microcentrifuge tubes (ThermoFisher Scientific #50809242PK or equivalent)\nVacuum source\nSerological pipettes, sterile:\n               \n5-ml (Corning™ #C4487 or equivalent)\n10-ml (Corning™ #C4488 or equivalent)\n25-ml (Corning™ #C4489 or equivalent)\n50-ml (Corning™ #C4490 or equivalent)\nPipet-Aid (or equivalent)",

Cell maintenance: Maintain Vero E6 cells in T-150 flasks containing cell maintenance medium in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. See Current Protocols article Phelan and May (2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-bib-0011]) for basic cell culture techniques.\nVero CCL-81 cells are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Harcourt et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-bib-0009]). However, it may be necessary to optimize conditions of the protocol, such as infection medium, overlay diluent, and the number of days post-infection to enumerate plaques.\n2. Seed plates: Trypsinize (see Current Protocols article: Phelan & May, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-bib-0011]) a confluent T-150 flask of Vero E6 cells and bring volume to 20 ml with cell maintenance medium. Use an automated cell counter to count cells and prepare a suspension at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in cell maintenance medium. For each specimen to be titrated, seed four 6-well plates with 6 × 105 cells per well by adding 2 ml of the suspension to each well. Incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator overnight to achieve 100% confluence the following day.\nVisualize cells the following day using a light microscope. Proceed with infection if cells have reached 95% to 100% confluence.\nSpecimen dilution, infection of cells, and primary overlay (Day 1, 0 days post-infection, dpi)",
    "3. Specimen dilution: For each specimen to be titrated, label 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes as follows: Neg, 10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5, and 10−6. Add 900 μl of infection medium to each tube. Serially dilute specimens 10-fold by transferring 100 μl of each specimen to the appropriate tube labeled 10−2, vortexing, and transferring 100 µl to the subsequent tube, down to 10−6.\nWorking with SARS-CoV-2 requires Biosafety Level (BSL) 3−compliant facilities. Work with your institution and safety officers to determine relevant personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety measures for working with infectious virus stocks. See Critical Parameters and also see Current Protocols article Burnett, Lunn, & Coico (2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-bib-0003]) for more information.\nFor high-titer specimens, it may be necessary to conduct further serial dilutions.\n4. Infection and adsorption: Label 6-well plates containing cells (see step 2) according to Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-fig-0002]. Aspirate medium from cell monolayers under vacuum, leaving ∼100 µl of medium to prevent monolayer from drying. Using a Pipet-Aid and a serological pipette, wash cells with 1 ml of DPBS. Leave ∼100 µl DPBS to prevent monolayer from drying out. Dispense 100 µl of the infection medium from the microcentrifuge tube labeled “N” into designated wells, as depicted in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-fig-0001]. Dispense 100 µl of diluted specimens (10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5, and 10−6) into designated wells, changing pipette tips every time (Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-fig-0002]). Incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 hr, rocking every 15 min.\nDo not swirl the inoculum. Use a front-to-back and side-to-side movement to evenly distribute the inoculum across the monolayer.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a0864fce-2f20-431a-902e-4a90d142d77d/cpmc105-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Plate layout for plaque assays conducted in 6-well plates. Vero E6 cells grown in 6-well plates are inoculated with 100 μl of 10-fold serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 specimen from 10−2 to 10−6, as well as infection medium as a negative control. Four replicates are prepared for each titrated specimen.\n5. Preparation of primary S-OM: Incubate overlay diluent at 44°C in a water bath. Microwave to dissolve 2% NA (solid matrix) and incubate at 44°C in a water bath. After rocking plates for the last time (∼10 min before incubation is over), prepare primary S-OM by combining equal amounts (1:1) of overlay diluent and 2% NA (solid matrix). Use Formula 1 to calculate the total volume of S-OM needed, followed by Formula 2 to calculate the overlay diluent and 2% NA (solid matrix) needed to prepare the primary S-OM.\nFormula 1: Total volume of primary S-OM needed (in ml) = Number of specimens × 4 plates per specimen × 6 wells per plate × 3 ml primary S-OM per well × 1.2 (to account for pipetting error)\nFormula 2: Volume of overlay diluent or 2% NA (solid matrix) needed for primary S-OM (in ml) = total volume of primary S-OM needed ÷ 2\nThe bottle of prepared primary S-OM can be placed on top of a Styrofoam mat to prevent it from cooling in the biological safety cabinet (BSC).\n6. Primary solid overlay: Add 3 ml of primary S-OM to each well of the titration plates (step 4). Allow primary S-OM to solidify and incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2 days.\nSecondary overlay and staining (Day 3, 2 dpi)",
    "7. Preparation: Incubate overlay diluent at 44°C in a water bath. Microwave to dissolve 2% NA (solid matrix) and incubate at 44°C in a water bath. Prepare secondary S-OM (composition: 1:1 overlay diluent:2% NA with 0.01% neutral red) by using Formula 3 to calculate the total volume of secondary S-OM needed. Use Formula 4 to calculate the volume of 0.33% NR needed, Formula 5 to calculate the volume of overlay diluent needed, and Formula 6 to calculate the volume of 2% NA (solid matrix) needed to prepare the secondary S-OM.\nFormula 3: Total volume of secondary S-OM needed (in ml) = Number of specimens × 4 plates per specimen × 6 wells per plate × 2 ml secondary S-OM per well × 1.2 (to account for pipetting error)\nFormula 4: Volume of 0.33% NR needed for secondary S-OM (in ml) = total volume of secondary S-OM needed × 0.03\nFormula 5: Volume of overlay diluent needed for secondary S-OM (in ml) = (total volume of secondary solid overlay medium needed ÷ 2) − volume of 0.33% NR needed for secondary S-OM\nFormula 6: Volume of 2% NA (solid matrix) needed for secondary S-OM = total volume of secondary S-OM needed ÷ 2\nThe bottle of prepared secondary S-OM can be placed on top of a Styrofoam mat to minimize cooling in the BSC.\n8. Secondary solid overlay: Add 2 ml of secondary S-OM to each well of the titration plates. Allow secondary S-OM to solidify and incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator overnight.\nEnumeration of plaques and titer calculation (Day 4, 3 dpi)",
    "9. Enumerate plaques: Use a white-light transilluminator (light box) to aid in visualizing the plaques, which will appear as peach-colored circles on a brownish-red monolayer of cells (Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-fig-0003]). The negative control should have a uniform monolayer, which can be used as a reference. Record the number of plaques observed per well at each virus dilution.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/caad56df-f488-4432-a5ef-a05c616d61bd/cpmc105-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\n(A) Representative plaque assay plate processed by the Basic Protocol, which uses a solid double overlay method. (B) Schematic example of a 6-well SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay plate processed by the Basic Protocol after 3 dpi. The negative control shows an intact monolayer stained brownish red. The 10−6 dilution appears similar to the negative control, indicating the absence of SARS-CoV-2 plaque-forming units. The 10−5 and 10−3 dilutions show 2 and >100 peach-colored plaques, but since these values are less than 5 and greater than 100, they will not be used in the calculation of the virus titer. The 10−4 dilution shows 21 plaques, and thus these values will be used in the calculation of the virus titer. The titer from this plate is 2.1 × 105 PFU/ml.\n10. Titer calculation: Identify the virus dilution factor that yields 5-100 plaques per well (Baer & Kehn-Hall, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-bib-0001]). Use Formula 7 to calculate the average number of plaques at this dilution. Use Formula 8 to calculate the titer of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen using the identified dilution factor and the inoculum volume of 0.1 ml. Refer to Figure 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-fig-0003] for an example plaque assay plate and interpretation.\nFormula 7: Average number of plaques given by the identified virus dilution = Sum of plaques from 4 replicate wells ÷ 4\nFormula 8: Titer of SARS-CoV-2 (in PFU/ml) = Average number of plaques given by the identified virus dilution ÷ (dilution factor × 0.1 ml)",
    "11. Waste disposal: Storage of plates prior to enumeration is not recommended because the borders of the plaques become less distinct over time. Wells of each plate can be topped up with an appropriate disinfectant (such as a 5% Micro-Chem Plus solution) and incubated at room temperature overnight prior to disposal in biohazardous waste. All biohazardous waste should be autoclaved at 121°C for 1 hr.",
    "This protocol can be used as an alternative to the Basic Protocol for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 by plaque assay. The first steps in the protocol are identical to the Basic Protocol. However, after adsorption, a liquid overlay medium (L-OM) is applied to the cell monolayer to restrict virus growth to the originally infected foci of cells. In addition, instead of incorporating a vital stain into the secondary overlay (S-OM), the L-OM is removed from the monolayer, fixed, and stained with crystal violet, which binds to proteins and DNA within cells (Feoktistova, Geserick, & Leverkus, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-bib-0008]). As a result, clear plaques can be distinguished from the purple monolayer. Plaques are enumerated and used for the calculation of virus titers in PFU/ml.

After rocking plates for the last time (approximately 10 min before incubation is over), prepare L-OM by adding equal amounts (1:1) of overlay diluent and 3% CMC (liquid matrix). Use Formula 1 to calculate the total volume of L-OM needed, followed by Formula 2 to calculate the overlay diluent and 3% CMC (liquid matrix) needed to prepare the L-OM.",
    "Formula 1: Total volume of L-OM needed (in ml) = Number of specimens × 4 plates per specimen × 6 wells per plate × 3 ml L-OM per well × 1.2 (to account for pipetting error)\nFormula 2: Volume of overlay diluent or 3% CMC (liquid matrix) needed for L-OM (in ml) = total volume of L-OM needed ÷ 2\n4. Liquid overlay: Add 3 ml of L-OM to each well of the titration plates (see Basic Protocol, step 4). Incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 3 days.\nDuring this incubation, avoid movement of the plates, which can disrupt the liquid overlay and cause plaques to smear.\nFixation, staining, enumeration of plaques, and titer calculation (Day 4, 3 dpi)\n5. Fixation: Carefully aspirate L-OM from each well and discard in a waste bottle containing an appropriate disinfectant (such as a 5% Micro-Chem Plus solution). Gently wash cells with DPBS and fill wells with 10% buffered formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hr.\n6. Staining: Aspirate fixative from wells and discard into a waste bottle containing the appropriate amount of Formalex. Add 200 μl of 0.5% CV to each well and incubate at room temperature for 5-15 minutes.\nOne volume of Formalex is used to inactivate 4 volumes of formaldehyde waste.\n7. Wash: Wash cells 2-4 times with distilled water. Blot dry.\nAt this point, plates can be surface-decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant and stored at 4°C for up to 1 month.\n8. Enumerate plaques: Plaques will appear as clear circles on a purple monolayer of cells (Figure 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.105#cpmc105-fig-0004]).
