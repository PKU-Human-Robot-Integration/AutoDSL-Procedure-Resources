  "procedures": [
    "All methods described here were approved in accordance with GPS guidelines and national legislation by the Ethical Committee for the use of animals in experiments at the University of Veterinary Medicine of Vienna (Ref: 09/10/97/2012 and 10/10/97/2012).\n1. Participant recruitment\nRecruit 220 owners (here, 187 females, 33 males; mean age ± SD = 38.64 ± 13.57 years, range 13-72 years) of pet Border Collies and invite them to take part in a behavioral study with their dogs (here, 125 females (45 neutered) and 95 males (32 neutered); mean age ± SD = 48.07 ± 42.43 months).\n2. Behavioral testing procedure\nPre-test\nWelcome the owner and the dog to the lab and invite them to familiarize with the experimental room (6 m X 5 m, see Figure 1).\nExplain to the owner the overall procedure for 5 min while the dog is free to explore the room.\nVideotape the tests using four digital video cameras placed at the four corners of the room (black dots named \"Camera\" in Figure 1) connected to a video-recording station outside the test room.\nFood Choice Test\nHave the owner sit on a chair on one side of the room (orange square; \"Chair (Food choice)\" in Figure 1).\nProvide the owner with a questionnaire to record demographic information of both dog and owner (i.e. owner age, owner gender, dog age, dog sex, dog neuter status) so that the owner does not influence the dog during the set-up and choice.\nPut the dog on a leash and tie it to the wall directly opposite to the owner (orange curved line; \"Leash (Food choice + Teaching)\" in Figure 1).\nTake two plates (one with a piece of sausage and one empty) from a table positioned beside the owner (orange square; \"Table\" in Figure 1).",
    "Walk towards the dog and place the two plates on the floor in front of the dog, 1 m from each other and 1.5 m from the dog (orange squares; \"Plate 1 (Food choice)\" and \"Plate 2 (Food choice)\" in Figure 1).\nWalk behind the dog. Stand behind the dog looking at the floor.\nHave the owner stand up, walk to the empty plate and crouch next to it.\nHave the owner pick the plate up and show to the dog that this plate is interesting and delicious.\n\t\tNOTE: Instruct the owner to show preference for the empty plate for ~ 5 s, but otherwise let the owner behave as desired.\nHave the owner go back to the chair and continue filling in the questionnaire.\nOnce the owner sits back on the chair, release the dog from the leash and allow it to approach one plate.\nOnce the dog is within 15 cm from one plate, walk to pick up the other plate.\nHold the leash and bring the dog back to the starting position (orange curved line in Figure 1). Collect the other plate from the floor and bring both plates back to the table.\nRepeat the procedure (steps 2.2.2 - 2.2.12) six times.\nDNA sample collection\nHave the owner hold the dog by the collar/harness in the \"DNA sample area\" (Figure 1). Explain that DNA samples will be collected from the inner side of the dog's mouth. Instruct that the owner can talk to and pet the dog during this test. Allow the owner to behave as desired.\nTake the samples by crouching close to the dog and gently rotating a cotton swab in the inner side of the mouth. Repeat with a second swab.\nRepeat the procedure twice, one for each side of the dog's mouth.",
    "Reunion after separation\nHave the owner leave the experimental room by \"Door 1\" (Figure 1) for 3 min, while the dog stays inside the room unleashed and free to move.\nHave the owner go back inside the room by \"Door 1\" and pause next to the door (blue square; \"Owner position 2 (Reunion + Commands)) for 5 s without interacting with the dog. Have the owner greet the dog for 30 s. Instruct the owner to greet the dog as done at home.\nTug-of-war play\nHave the owner use a rope toy to play tug-of-war with the dog for 30 s. Instruct the owner to play with the dog as they normally would in everyday play situations.\nT-shirt\nHave the owner put a T-shirt on the dog by placing it over the head, putting each front paw into the sleeves one after the other, and tying a knot at the bottom of the T-shirt on the dogs' back.\nHave the owner walk around the room ignoring the dog. After 30 s, have the owner remove the T-shirt off the dog. Instruct the owner not to talk during the procedure, but behave as desired.\nBasic commands\nHave the experimenter crouch on one side of the room (grey square; \"Experimenter position (Commands)\" in Figure 1) behind a box full of crumpled newspapers.\nHave the owner stand on the opposite side (grey square; \"Owner position 1 (Commands) + Owner position (Ball play)\" in Figure 1).\nHave the owner call the dog so that both the owner and the dog are in the grey square (\"Owner position 1 (Commands) + Owner position (Ball play)\"), the dog facing the doors, the owner facing the dog.\nSearch for something in a box full of crumpled newspaper to distract the dog from the owner's commands.",
    "Have the owner issue three simple commands to the dog.\n\t\t\nFirst, have the owner command the dog to sit. Once the dog sits, have the owner command the dog to lay down. Once the dog lays down, have the owner command the dog to stay.\nAfter the stay command, have the owner walk towards the experimenter and wait for 15 s besides the experimenter, 5 m from the dog (blue square; \"Owner position 2 (Reunion + Commands)\" in Figure 1), facing the dog. Have the owner call the dog. The owner can praise and talk to the dog during the task.\nTeaching\nHave the owner tie the dog on a 1 m leash to the wall (curved line; \"Leash (Food choice+ Teaching)\" in Figure 1) and walk 2 m away from the dog (red dotted area; \"Teaching area\" in Figure 1).\nHave the owner show the dog how to remove the lid from a bin containing a piece of sausage following this sequence:\n\t\t\nHold a piece of sausage in one hand while removing the lid of the bin with the other hand. Put the food in the bin and cover it back. Remove the lid of the bin and show the food inside the bin.\nHave the owner repeat the procedure four times.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The owner can talk and look at the dog during the whole procedure.\nBall play\nHave the owner stand in a specific location of the room (grey square; Ball play; Figure 1) and throw a tennis ball towards the opposite side of the room. Have the owner to ask the dog to retrieve the ball.\nHave the owner repeat the procedure three times.\n\t\tNOTE: Instruct the owner to play with the dog as they normally would in everyday play situations.\n3. Behavioral coding",
    "Analyze the videos taken during testing and record the following behaviors on a spreadsheet:\n\t\nScore the behavioral variables; communication style, active social support, warmth and play style on a 4-point scale, and score the enthusiasm and authoritarian behaviors on a 3-points scale. See Table 1 for definitions of each value.\nCount the number of commands, praises, petting and attention sounds in the situations indicated in Table 1.\nProvide a second coder the list and definitions of the coded variables. Have the second coder code 20% of the videos to calculate inter-rater reliability.\n4. Data processing\nTransform all count variables in 2- or 4-point scales as described in Table 2.\nRun an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with Oblimin rotation on all behavioral variables. Define the number of factors to be extracted based on the Scree plot. Extract the factors using a regression method and excluding missing values list wise.\nCalculate the internal consistency of the extracted factors using Cronbach´s alpha. Compare the data provided by the main coder and a second coder using Cohen´s kappa to have a measure of the inter-rater reliability."
