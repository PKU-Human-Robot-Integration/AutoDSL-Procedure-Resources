    "The preparation of growth medium is a critical step to any experiment aiming to culture and model complex microbial communities. The medium formulation used in this protocol has evolved through successive iterations and originates from the formulation first described by Macfarlane et al. (1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0007]) and modified by McDonald et al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0011]). There are, however, no standard media to grow microbial communities from human stool. It is important then, to consider the goals of an experiment before designing a medium type to use. (Supplemental Table S1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#support-information-section] provides a comparison of medium components used in similar in vitro model systems from the published literature to help guide the reader in this aspect of experimental design.) Once a formulation is established, it is also important to remain consistent with its use throughout a given experiment, to avoid introducing confounders that would make experimental run comparisons challenging. As such, we recommend calculating the amounts of medium components required for an experimental series, and sourcing enough prior to starting work, to minimize any lot-to-lot variation from component manufacturers. Here we provide details of a complex medium that is designed to generally replicate nutrient conditions found in the adult human colon. The protocol is presented for the production of a 2-L volume, but depending on the experimental protocol planned, multiple bottles may be required. In this case, medium production can be scaled up to produce several 2-L bottles at a time, and prepared medium can be stored for ∼2 weeks at 4ºC.",
    "This protocol describes creating culture medium with the intention of adding it steadily with a flow rate set to allow for a 24-hr retention in the bioreactor vessel. It is also possible to set the pumps to pulse medium into the system at set intervals, though these procedures will not be covered in depth here. Researchers are recommended to consult the user manual for the bioreactor system they intend to use.\nThis protocol uses reagents that are either soluble or, if insoluble, have particle sizes small enough to pass through Infors Multifors pump hoses with an interior diameter of 1 mm. Depending on the application, it may be important to include reagents with larger particle sizes that may not be suitable for the tubing sizes described here. In this situation, it is possible to use external pump systems to the built-in pump mechanisms on the Infors Multifors 2 system with larger tubing and pump hose sizes to overcome this limitation or to add such components as supplements pulsed into the system via an extraneous addition port that is not otherwise used by the system, as described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-prot-0004].\nMaterials\nOxoid peptone water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "1. Prepare tubing by cutting two 10-cm, one 27-cm, one 50-cm, and one 120-cm pieces of silicone tubing. Tie a knot 1 cm from one end of one of the 10-cm pieces. Cut one 10-cm × 10-cm and two 25-cm × 15-cm pieces of aluminum foil.\n2. Wrap one end of the 50-cm long tubing with the 10- × 10-cm piece of aluminum foil. Place one of the 25- × 15-cm pieces of aluminum foil on a flat surface and place flat onto the middle of the foil a coiled piece of the 50-cm tubing with foil covering one end, leaving the other end outside of the foil (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0003]). Fold the sides and bottom of the foil as shown by the dashed black lines in Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0003] and 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0003]. Fold the last corner of the foil towards the center as shown in Figure 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0003]. The final prepared tubing (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0003]) is referred to as the short tubing.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c8974905-708d-4abd-a1d3-302f72117a99/cpz1737-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nPreparing tubing with one covered end for autoclaving.

    "3. Place the other 25- × 15-cm piece of aluminum foil on a flat surface. Make a flat coil with the 120-cm length of tubing such that the ends of the tubing are not on the aluminum foil as shown in Figure 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0004].

    "Preparation of tubing connected to bottle cap. (A) Prepared tubing lengths wrapped in aluminum foil are joined by the pump tubing forming the pump tube assembly. (B) The pump tube assembly is attached to the addition port on the cap of the bottle. A length of tubing is connected to the side of the addition port opposite the pump tubing assembly and pointing into the bottle. A piece of knotted tubing is added along with a 0.2-µm filter connected to a piece of tubing. (C) Bulldog clips are shown pinching the pump tubing assembly coming out of the bottle, the tubing connected to the filter, and holding the end of the pump assembly line to knotted tube.\n5. Connect the other end of the prepared long tubing to one of the ports of a three-port bottle cap (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0005]). To this same metal port but on the opposite side (pointing into the bottle when attached) connect the 27-cm tubing (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0005]).\n6. Attach the knotted and unknotted 10-cm tubing lengths to the other two remaining ports on the bottle top so that they extend outside the bottle when the lid is on (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0005]). Attach a 25-mm 0.22-µm filter to the end of the unknotted 10-cm tubing piece. Wrap filter and tubing with the prepared 10- × 10-cm piece of foil. Set all prepared tubing, filter, and bottle lid to one side as shown in the schematic diagram (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0005]).\n7. To a clean 2-L bottle, add 4 g peptone water, 4 g yeast extract, 4 g NaHCO3, 4 g pectin, 4 g xylo-oligosaccharide, 4 g arabinogalactan, 10 g starch, 6 g casein, 2 g inulin, 0.2 g NaCl, and 8 g porcine mucin powders. Weigh each medium component separately, using an analytical balance.",
    "The medium components (with the exception of porcine gastric mucin) can be weighed and stored in a container at ambient temperature prior to use. A funnel is recommended to aid in the complete transfer of these materials from weighing boat to bottle.\n8. Add 1,800 ml deionized water to the medium bottle using a graduated cylinder.\n200 ml of space is left to accommodate the additions added to the medium after autoclaving.\n9. Add the 76-mm stir bar into the bottle, place on a stir plate, and mix medium until a uniform suspension is obtained (∼30 min). During mixing, screw the prepared bottle cap with connected tubing onto the bottle, leaving it loose by one turn (to allow steam to escape during autoclaving).\nThe medium should be prepared in this way no more than 1 hr prior to autoclaving.\n10. Using three metal bulldog clips, fold over and clamp the tubing connected to the filter; the prepared long tubing; and the prepared short tubing (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0005]).\n11. Autoclave the prepared bottle at 121°C for 60 min (hereafter referred to as ‘liquid 60’; or as appropriate for the autoclave instrument used) to sterilize the medium.\n12. Remove from the autoclave and allow sterilized medium to cool by placing at room temperature. Once cool, tighten the lid on the bottle.\nAt this point the medium bottle can be left to cool at room temperature overnight and then stored at 4°C until ready to make medium additions, for up to 4 weeks.\n13. Using the analytical balance, weigh 1 g bile salts into a 500-ml beaker (Beaker 1) and add 50 ml deionized water. Add a 38-mm magnetic stir bar to the beaker and mix on magnetic stir plate until fully dissolved.",
    "Bile salts may cause irritation if inhaled and it is suggested that this reagent is weighed using an analytical balance located in a fume hood.\n14. Using the analytical balance, measure 1 g L-cysteine HCl, 0.08 g K2HPO4, 0.08 g KH2PO4, 0.02 g MgSO4, and 0.02 g CaCl2. Add these components to a second 500-ml beaker (Beaker 2).\n15. Add 2 ml hemin solution and 2 ml menadione solution to Beaker 2.\n16. Add 146 ml deionized water to Beaker 2. Add a 38-mm magnetic stir bar and stir on a stir plate until components are fully mixed.\nThese additions will give the prepared solution a dark brown color.\n17. Slowly add the bile salts solution from Beaker 1 into Beaker 2 while stirring.\nDuring the addition of the bile salts, a precipitate will form, changing the solution to a light brown-colored, opaque suspension.\n18. Using a Pasteur pipet, add 2 M NaOH solution dropwise to the suspension until the precipitate is dissolved and a solution results.\n19. Spray surfaces of a wrapped, sterile 50-ml glass pipet, a bottle top filter, a pipet filler or motorized pipet controller, and a sterilized 1-L bottle with 70% ethanol and place into a class II laminar flow cabinet. Irradiate under UV light for 15 min. Filter-sterilize the prepared medium addition solution from Beaker 2 into a sterilized 1-L bottle using the bottle-top filter.\n20. Spray surface of the autoclaved and cooled 2-L medium bottle (from step 12) with 70% ethanol and bring into the class II laminar flow hood.\n21. Unwrap serological pipet and aseptically transfer all 200 ml of the filter-sterilized solution to the 2-L bottle. Recap 2-L bottle and use prepared medium immediately or store at 4 ºC for up to 2 weeks.",
    "It is critical that steps 19-21 are done under aseptic conditions, and in our hands, we find conducting these steps inside a laminar flow hood is essential.",
    "This protocol describes the process for creating and adding medium supplements to the bioreactor for components that are either volatile at room temperature for extended periods of time, are insoluble and have particulates too large to pass through pump fittings, or if there is an experimental interest in pulsing a reagent into the bioreactor system at specific time points. This method makes supplements in advance of a bioreactor experiment by storing in ready-to-use syringes, making use of the extra addition port on the vessel lid (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0006]) to pulse in supplements, followed by a water rinse to clear the port.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b40c1727-8ade-4ed7-bcc6-8f42786485eb/cpz1737-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nTop-down view of vessel lid with suggested port layout.

    "1. Prepare tubing by cutting two 10-cm pieces of tubing for each supplement being created to account for the supplementation syringe and the water rinse syringe. Knot one end of the tubing and sterilize in a dry 20 autoclave (or appropriate cycle for the autoclave instrument).\nKnotted tubing can be autoclaved in empty pipet rack boxes for ease of transport and maintaining sterility.\n2. Prepare two GL45 bottle lids by cutting four 12-cm pieces of tubing and enough 10-cm pieces of tubing to account for excess ports on the lid. Knot the 10-cm pieces to block the extra ports. Place a 12-cm length of tubing on each side of one port. Place foil on the end of the 12-cm length of tubing on the top of the bottle lid to keep it sterile, clipping it 3 cm from the prong.\nIf a larger bottle is required for the volume of supplements being created, cut a longer piece of tubing to attach to the bottom of the bottle lid so that the tubing barely skims the bottom of the bottle to facilitate the transfer of the supplement mixture to the syringes.\n3. Prepare the medium component that is to be supplemented into the system and place in a 250-ml bottle (or appropriate size to accommodate dry weight and water volume). Weigh enough of the component to match how many supplement additions you will be making to the bioreactor system.\nNote that some starches may clump when autoclaved with water, so prepare by autoclaving the dry reagent in a dry 20 autoclave cycle (or appropriate cycle for the autoclave instrument used) and prepare sterile water separately. Other methods of sterilization such as irradiation can be considered if autoclaving is impractical for a given substrate.",
    "4. Add deionized water to a volume to match the desired concentration for each supplement addition you will be making.\nFor instance, if making daily 5-ml supplementations of a given substrate at a 20% (w/v) concentration for a 21-day bioreactor experiment, prepare 21 g of substrate and 84 ml of water.\nOptimization of the concentration of a given reagent in water is required to control the total volume of the supplement; try to use the smallest volume possible where the supplement mixture can still be pushed through a Luer-Lok syringe and piece of tubing. Do not exceed 10% (v/v) of the vessel's working volume.\n5. Add a small magnetic stir bar to the bottle, screw on the prepared bottle lid from step 2 (leaving loose to a turn for steam to escape), and autoclave at 121°C for 30 min (hereafter referred to as ‘liquid 30’; or appropriate cycle for the autoclave instrument and volume) to sterilize.\n6. Prepare a second bottle of sterile water with 3 ml water per supplement. Attach the second screw on the prepared bottle lid from step 2 (leaving loose to a turn for steam to escape) and sterilize by autoclaving in a liquid 30 cycle (or appropriate cycle for the autoclave instrument and volume) to sterilize.\n7. Once cooled, spray the surfaces of the bottles containing the supplement mixture and sterilized water, the container with the sterilized knotted tubing, wrapped 5-ml Luer-Lok syringes, and a magnetic stir plate with 70% ethanol and move into a laminar flow hood. Expose to UV light for 15 min.\n8. Place supplement mixture on the stir plate until a homogenous mixture is obtained.",
    "9. Carefully remove foil and clip from the tubing on the lid of the bottle with the supplement mixture while it is still on the stir plate. Aliquot supplement mixture aseptically into the Luer-Lok syringes by unwrapping a sterile syringe and attaching it to the exposed end of tubing on the supplement bottle. Fill syringe to the desired volume, and while the syringe is still attached to the bottle tubing, invert it and push excess air out. Detach syringe from the bottle tubing and replace it with a sterile piece of knotted tubing as prepared in step 1. Supplement syringes should be stored in a clean container for no longer than 1 month to prevent chances of contamination.\nIf the supplement contains volatile reagents, store in an appropriate manner (e.g., at 4˚C, away from light).\nTo prepare the water syringes, follow the instructions from step 9. It can be useful to leave a small air pocket in the syringe prior to adding the knotted tubing on the water syringes to help rinse out the port when the supplement is being added to the bioreactor system.\nIt is critical that steps 7-9 are done under aseptic conditions, and in our hands, conducting these steps inside a laminar flow hood is essential.\n10. To add the prepared supplement to the bioreactor systems, lay the supplement and water syringe horizontally on a clean piece of paper towel and spray it thoroughly with 70% ethanol to disinfect the surface.\nRecommended: Mix the supplement syringe prior to preparing it for addition to the bioreactor system by gently flicking it to bring any settled substrates back into a homogenous mixture. This will lessen the likelihood of the tubing becoming clogged if the supplement reagent is prone to clumping.",
    "11. Spray the remaining addition port (with the remaining piece of knotted tubing) and a pair of scissors with 70% ethanol. Remove clamp from the condenser so pressure can escape while adding the supplement to the bioreactor system.\n12. Carefully cut the knotted tubing close to the knot that is on the addition port. Quickly remove the knotted tubing from the tip of the supplement syringe and affix it to the tubing left on the addition port. Slowly push syringe contents into the vessel.\nIf the supplement is clumping at the addition port, do not use excessive force to push it through. Carefully pull up and down on the plunger to break the clog or attempt to massage the tubing to break it up.\n13. To swap the supplement syringe for the water syringe, invert the supplement syringe that is still connected to the addition port and remove it. Quickly take the knotted tubing off the water syringe, placing the tubing back on the paper towel from step 10, and affix the syringe to the tubing on the addition port. Slowly push a small amount of water through the port (the entire 3 ml is not often required) to clear it of any remaining debris from the supplement and pull up on the plunger to fill it with gas.\n14. Spray tubing that is still attached to the water syringe and addition port, and a razor blade with 70% ethanol.\n15. Carefully cut tubing from the addition port with the razor blade to remove it. Quickly replace with the knotted tubing from the water syringe (set aside in step 13) to the addition port. Re-clamp the condenser.",
    "This protocol describes the steps taken to build the bioreactor vessel. It is specific to the Infors Multifors 2 bioreactor system but can easily be adapted to similar systems with modifications.

The sparger ring should fit above the centering bearing and the magnetic coupling (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0007]). Adjust the position of the gas sparger by loosening the screw in the clamping adapter to allow the sparger to spin and move up and down. Once placed, tighten the screw to hold in place.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5dcfa036-2d8a-47fa-a6a2-880788691738/cpz1737-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nSide view of an assembled bioreactor vessel seated in a stand and filled with water ready for autoclaving.\n3. Adjust the two impellers on the stirrer shaft to the desired positions by loosening the screw located on each and tightening once in position (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0007]).\nThe impellers should be below the level of the working volume (e.g., 200 ml).\n4. Place the lid on the glass vessel and close the quick-release clamp fastener.\nLocking the lid at this step prevents the lid from moving while working with the bioreactor vessel.",
    "5. Cut four 10-cm pieces of silicone tubing and tie a knot 3 cm from one end of each.\n6. Place the untied ends of the tubing onto each of the four addition ports labeled in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0006]; these will later be used for acid, base, medium, and as a spare.\n7. Cut two 10-cm, one 20-cm, and one 25-cm pieces of silicone tubing.\n8. Using scissors, cut aluminum foil into six 3-cm × 5-cm, one 25-cm × 15-cm, and one 10-cm × 10-cm strips.\n9. Tie a knot 3 cm from one end of one of the 10-cm tubing pieces. Place the open end of this knotted tubing over the metal effluent pipe on the top surface of the lid (see diagram in Fig. 8A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0008]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/72559980-79a2-4811-8498-7908c7be33f7/cpz1737-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nBioreactor vessel prepared with tubing and bulldog clips before autoclaving.

Dashed red boxes represent areas that are covered with foil. (B) Side view of vessel with connected tubing. Bulldog clip is labeled between the 50-mm filter and the sparger on the vessel.\n10. Lower the metal effluent tube by loosening the screw in the clamping adapter and position the bottom of the effluent pipe to the bottom of the vessel (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0008]). Tighten the screw once the waste pipe is in position.\nLowering the effluent pipe at this point helps maintain sterility later when the water used for autoclaving is exchanged for growth medium.\n11. Place one end of the other 10-cm tubing around the opening of the condenser vent. For autoclaving, wrap the end of the condenser tubing with a piece of the 3- × 5-cm aluminum foil.",
    "The condenser unit can be replaced with a length of tubing with an in-line filter attached to the extra addition port. This will allow the vessel to aseptically vent steam during autoclaving and gas build up during the experiment. A pair of pliers can be used to pull the end of the tubing snugly around the metal gas effluent tube. Leave the tubing connected to the top of the condenser open as this will act as the vent for steam during autoclaving. This is an essential step to ensure that pressure does not build up within the vessel during autoclaving. Failure to properly vent the vessel may lead to damage of the glass vessel.\n12. Remove sampling port extension and blanking plug from the lid of the vessel and place a self-sealing septum inside a septum collar to seal the hole. Replace sampling port extension and tighten until just hand tight. Loosely screw the blanking plug closed.\nIt is important that this port is not overtightened as doing so may damage the septum. Overtightening the blanking plug in the sampling port may result in loosening the entire sampling apparatus when attempting to remove just the blanking plug, thus only tighten the blanking plug until minimal resistance is felt.\n13. To prepare the gas line, insert sparger tubing connector to one end of the 20-cm length of tubing (Fig. 9A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0009]) and the 50-mm 0.22-µm filter to the other end (Fig. 9B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0009]). Attach one end of the 25-cm length of tubing to the other side of the large filter (Fig. 9B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0009]) and the other end to the gas sparger (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a1db1fbc-a02a-45c6-b800-5621e56b30f5/cpz1737-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9",

Wrap gas line 50-mm 0.22-µm filter with the 25- × 15-cm rectangle of aluminum foil to prevent moisture leaching into the filter during autoclaving (Fig. 9C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0009]).\n16.

To calibrate the pH probe, add 100 ml of pH 4 buffer solution to one 150-ml beaker and 100 ml of pH 10 buffer solution to another 150-ml beaker. Calibrate pH probes according to manufacturer's directions. Brief directions for the use of indicated probes with the Infors Multifors 2 system are provided below.\n         \nFor analogue Hamilton branded probes, navigate to the Batch menu. Make sure the previous run is ended under Bioreactor Operation and then select calibrate pH.\nAttach pH probe to the pH probe sensor leads and rinse the storage buffer from the probe with deionized water.\nFirst place pH probe in the pH 4 solution beaker and allow pH reading to equilibrate such that the mV reading does not change more than 0.1 over a 30-s period (this will take ∼5-10 min depending on the sensor quality).\nOnce the pH 4 calibration has been accepted, rinse probe with deionized water, and place into the pH 10 solution, repeating step 17c.",
    "Once calibration is complete, be sure to save the calibrated values on the CPU. The pH probe can now be detached from the Infors system CPU leads and the probe cap can be replaced for autoclaving.\nScrew calibrated pH probe into the pH probe port on the bioreactor vessel lid.\n18. Fill bioreactor vessel with 200 ml deionized water to submerge the pH probe septum.\nThe pH probe septum looks like a small white dot on the side of the probe. Ensuring this is submerged keeps the delicate membrane from drying out and damaging the probe.\nIf the vessel is being prepared in advance and water will not be exchanged for medium on the same day, it is recommended that instead, the vessel is filled with 4 M KCl so that the electrode is not damaged by being submerged in water for excess time.\n19. Wrap a 25-mm filter with the 10- × 10-cm aluminum foil sheet.\nPrior to autoclaving, check that the stir shaft can rotate smoothly by carefully holding the assembled vessel above the center of a magnetic stir plate and switch the plate on at a low rpm value. If there are any issues with stir shaft rotation during this test, ensure that the stir rod is correctly seated in the centering bearing, and that the impellers and magnetic coupling are not impeded by the pH probe or gas sparger.\n20. Place vessels with tubing and foil-wrapped filter in an autoclavable tray and run on a liquid 30 cycle (or as appropriate for autoclave used).\n21. Remove sterilized vessels and foil-wrapped filter from the autoclave and place immediately into a class II laminar flow cabinet.\nAllow the vessel to cool before continuing, to reduce the risk of burns from escaping steam.",
    "22. Unwrap autoclaved filter from the aluminum foil and remove foil from the end of the tubing connected to the top of the condenser. Aseptically attach filter to the end of this tubing.\n23. Remove vessel from the laminar flow cabinet and transfer to the Multifors 2 instrument base.\n24. Attach sparger tubing connector to the unit, insert temperature probe into the probe port (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0006]), and connect pH probe to the lead on the control unit.\n25. From the Batch menu on the Infors system, start the run underneath the Bioreactor Operation section and select turn on stirring in the vessels to 50 rpm. Other controllers can be accessed via the Controller menu. Monitor the temperature reading from the Main or Controller menus and allow vessel contents to cool below 40°C before progressing.\nStirring ensures that the vessels are cooling evenly.\n26. Turn on the gas flow into the vessel and unclamp bulldog clips on the gas sparger tubing before and after the 50-mm 0.22-µm filter. Adjust gas flow so the float in the variable area flowmeter attached to the Multifors 2 is raised ∼1 mm. A stream of bubbles should be visible in the vessel.\nThe gas used here is nitrogen gas, however other gas mixes can be used to suit the needs of the experiment. The filter at the top of the condenser will allow for gas to escape to prevent pressure buildup in the vessel. Turning on the gas now is critical to maintain positive pressure in the vessel to limit the possibility of contamination when attaching the other vessel components.\n27. Unwrap the long effluent tubing connected to the effluent bottle (prepared in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-prot-0005]; Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0002]), while ensuring the end of the tubing remains wrapped to maintain sterility.",

Repeat this step for the bottle intended for containing base and attach it to another addition port.\nBecause the acid and base lines will remain untouched for the duration of the experiment, it is recommended that the addition ports that are the most difficult to reach are selected. Leave the most accessible addition port for the medium feed line to simplify medium bottle exchanges throughout the experiment.\n35.

Prime medium, acid, and base feed lines by setting the pump speeds to 100% until liquid reaches within 1 cm of the addition ports.\nPriming the medium line is particularly important to ensure there are no issues with medium clumping and blocking the pump hose. Priming the line before exchanging water for medium ensures that any problems can be identified quickly.\n41. Turn off the pumps for the medium, acid, and base feeds, and clip the acid and base lines with 32-mm metal bulldog clips 10 cm from the addition ports to prevent back-flow.\n42. Once the water has drained from the vessel, raise the effluent pipe to the appropriate height according to the desired volume for the vessel (e.g., 200 ml for the 0.4-L vessel). Ensure that this volume of liquid in the vessel covers the pH probe above the probe septum (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0007]).",

Cut a length of silicone tubing that can comfortably reach from the vessel's effluent output pipe to the desired position of the effluent bottle, with ∼20-30 cm of slack.\nEach lab setup is different and space limitations may require particular placement of the effluent collection bottles in relation to the bioreactor system. It is best to first determine vessel and effluent bottle positioning before determining the length of tubing required. In general, a length of 120 cm of tubing between the vessel and effluent bottle is sufficient (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0001]).",
    "2. Wrap the end of the tubing with a 3- × 5-cm strip of aluminum foil. Make a flat coil with the rest of the tubing around the wrapped end and wrap the coil in a 15- × 25-cm strip of aluminum foil, leaving the other end of the tubing exposed.\n3. Screw a three-port lid onto a 5-L glass bottle, leaving it loose by one turn.\n4. Attach the prepared, coiled tubing to one of the ports.\n5. Cut two 10-cm pieces of silicone tubing and knot one end of each piece ∼1 cm from one of the ends. Affix unknotted ends to the two remaining ports on the bottle lid.\n6. Screw a four-port lid onto a 2-L bottle, leaving it loose by one turn.\nThis bottle will act as the air trap.\n7. Cut a length of silicone tubing that can reach from the effluent bottle to the trap bottle with ∼10-20 cm of slack. In general, a length of 40 cm is sufficient (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0001]).\n8. Wrap one end of this tubing length, make a flat coil as in step 2 of this protocol, and wrap in a 15- × 25-cm strip of aluminum foil leaving the unwrapped end exposed.\n9. Attach exposed end of this tubing to one of the ports on the 2-L bottle lid.\n10. Cut another length of silicone tubing to act as the gas vent tube.\nGas exiting the vessels can contain metabolites that have an unpleasant odor and may also contain flammable gases such as hydrogen and methane. Ideally vent into a fume hood. Thus, the length of this gas vent tubing will be determined by the distance of the effluent collection bottles to the nearest fume hood.",
    "11. Cut two 10-cm pieces of silicone tubing and knot one end of each piece ∼1 cm from one of the ends. Affix unknotted ends to the two remaining ports on the bottle lid.\nIf multiple bioreactor vessels are being set up at once, multiple effluent bottles can be connected to the same air trap bottle in lieu of the knotted tubing pieces.\n12.

    "The method of preparation of the inoculum for a given bioreactor vessel should be considered carefully to ensure that the microbes are given the best chance of survival. Stool samples can be maintained for long periods (several months) by freezing them at −80ºC without any need for added cryoprotectant, however, repetitive freeze and thaw cycles will dramatically reduce microbial viability. To prevent this problem, care should be taken to divide a fresh stool sample into smaller aliquots, or not to completely thaw the whole sample each time a portion of it is needed. A better approach is to prepare a large portion of a fresh stool sample for inoculation by homogenizing it in prepared medium at a ratio of 1:10 stool/medium, and aliquoting this material into tubes before freezing at −80ºC. This approach will improve vessel-to-vessel reproducibility across experimental series. However, it is also important to remember that most of the microbial species that reside in human stool are sensitive anaerobes and microaerophiles, and thus measures should be taken to prevent oxygen exposure when thawing and/or preparing stool samples for inoculation; carrying out stool inoculum preparation steps inside an anaerobic chamber with an atmosphere of 10% hydrogen, 10% carbon dioxide, and 80% nitrogen is ideal.\nA starting inoculum volume of 0.5% to 1% of the total vessel running volume has, in our hands, proven sufficient for reproducible and representative bioreactor runs (McDonald et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0011], 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0010]; Yen et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0021]), and here we describe a protocol for preparation and inoculation of bioreactor vessels with at least 0.5% (w/v) starting stool material.\nMaterials\nStool sample\n10 ml bioreactor culture medium (as prepared in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-prot-0001]), pre-reduced by placing into an anaerobic chamber in a container with a loosened lid for at least 6 hr",

These microbes must multiply in the vessel before flow conditions are established to ensure that they are not washed out by the flow. To do this, the vessel is usually left under batch (no flow) conditions for 24 hr.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b809bab4-81f5-4603-9739-a8990191fd46/cpz1737-fig-0012-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 12\nVisual representation of turbidity changes under 24-hr batch (no medium flow) conditions.

    "Not all provided stool samples may be of appreciable volume, for example, some studies may have collected only milligram weights of stool samples. In our hands, it has been possible to work with even 100 mg samples of stool to create inocula and to effectively create complex communities from such samples (Ganobis, 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0027]).

    "This protocol details the steps required to create aliquots of a synthetic community. These aliquots can be used to create replicate Roboguts within an experimental group or condition. A synthetic community (also known as a defined community) refers to any collection of cultured microbial isolates, where each isolate exists as a pure, monoclonal stock. To create a synthetic community, microbial strains must be isolated from a sample of interest and stored as individual stocks. These strains can be revived and pooled together to create a complex microbial consortium, where each constituent member is known and defined. A synthetic community thus sacrifices some degree of community diversity for a high degree of experimental control. In contrast, a fecal community may contain several hundred strains, but only a subset of those strains can be feasibly identified. Methods for culturing microbes from feces and creating a synthetic community have been reviewed elsewhere (Bayer et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0002]; Renwick et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0015]); this protocol will focus on how to pool microbial isolates to create experimentally equivalent aliquots.\nMaterials\nLibrary of synthetic community microbial isolates (see introduction, Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-prot-0010]; solid agar medium is preferred for each synthetic community isolate)\nSupplemented Tryptic Soy Broth (sTSB), 5 ml and 1 ml (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-rec-0004]), pre-reduced by placing into an anaerobic chamber in a container with a loosened lid for at least 6 hr\nFreezing medium, pre-reduced, 95 ml (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-rec-0001])\n10% (v/v) bleach\n10-µl sterile inoculation loops (Globe Scientific, cat. no. 2815F)\n5-ml Luer-Lok syringe (BD, cat. no. 309646)\nBD 18-gauge PrecisionGlide Luer-Lok needle (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 14-826-5D)\n2-ml cryogenic storage vials (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 02-912-728)\nPipet filler\n25-ml serological pipet (GeneBio Systems, cat. no.

For each isolate, pick an isolated colony and streak out an area large enough to yield ∼10 mg of biomass; incubate overnight or the required time for good growth yields.\nPoorly growing strains may require more than a single agar plate to capture enough biomass to proceed.

Use a sterile loop to gently blend the broth mixture until all lumps of microbial biomass have dispersed. Several sterile loops can be bunched together to agitate microbial biomass more efficiently; gentle vortexing and pipetting may also be used.

Sterilize in a dry 20 autoclave cycle (or as appropriate for autoclave instrument used).\n3. If the tissue sample is frozen, thaw slowly to room temperature.",
    "If available, perform steps 4-9 in an anerobic chamber.\n4. Transfer tissue to the dissection tray. With the sterile blade affixed onto the scalpel holder, begin making cuts to break up the tissue. Two pairs of forceps may be used to tweeze apart particularly fibrous tissue. Once the sample is cut into smaller pieces for the appropriately sized tissue grinder or mortar and pestle being used, transfer to the mortar.\nThis protocol assumes only a small amount of tissue is being handled (biopsies 1-2 mm in length or tissue sections 5 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm). Consider sub-sectioning a piece of tissue if larger samples are available.\n5. Add 1 ml sTSB to the mortar and begin grinding the sample until a slurry that could be passed through a pipet tip is achieved.\nIf a piece of tissue cannot easily be ground up using the mortar and pestle, transfer it back to the dissection tray to further break apart with the scalpel and forceps.\n6. Transfer slurry to a sterile 15-ml conical tube. Rinse mortar and pestle with 1-2 ml sTSB and transfer it to the 15-ml conical tube as well. Top up the volume of the slurry to 10 ml with sTSB.\n7. With a wide-bore filter tip, pipet up and down to mix and further break apart the tissue in the broth.\n8. Once the tissue slurry is homogenized, gather it using a 20-ml disposable syringe. Use of a needle is optional for this step.\nAlternatively, the supernatant can be transferred to the Luer-Lok syringe via a 10-cm piece of sterile (autoclaved) ID 3.18-mm tubing.\n9. Remove needle from the syringe (if using) and dispose appropriately, then attach the pre-sterilized piece of knotted tubing from step 1 to the syringe.",
    "10. Transport inoculum to the prepared bioreactor vessel. Ensure that the vessel content (prepared medium) is at 37ºC, at the desired pH (usually neutral for mimicking the distal colon), and has been sparged (bubbled through the medium) for at least 1 hr with nitrogen gas to displace excess oxygen.\n11. Remove bulldog clip on the condenser vent tubing to allow gas flow directly from the vessel headspace. Use the same clip to clamp the effluent tubing closed ∼15 cm from the effluent pipe.\n12. Disinfect blades of a pair of scissors and a region ∼10 cm (from the effluent pipe) of the outside surface of the effluent tubing with 70% ethanol.\n13. Cut effluent tube ∼5 cm from the end of the pipe with scissors. Quickly remove the knotted tubing from the end of the inoculating syringe and attach the Luer-Lok to the cut end of the effluent tubing connected to the effluent pipe of the vessel. Inject sample into the vessel with the syringe plunger.\n14. Disinfect razor blade and effluent pipe with 70% ethanol. Use razor blade to make a small slit in the tubing connected to the waste pipe to facilitate its removal. Dispose of the syringe and tubing remnant appropriately.\n15. Reattach effluent tubing still connected to the waste bottle to the vessel at the freshly cut end. Unclamp effluent tubing and return clip to the condenser vent.\n16. Allow the microbial community to grow for at least 48 hr in batch culture.",
    "Batch time may vary, especially with small amounts of tissue-based inoculum. Look for indications of fermentation such as change in color or turbidity in the vessel, and base demand in the system. Batch conditions should only be used for a maximum of 72 hr to limit loss of nutrient support for the microbial ecosystem.\n17. Turn on the medium flow and clamp the condenser vent tube.",
    "This protocol details the sampling of the vessels throughout the experiment. It is important to determine before starting the types of downstream experiments that will be performed and the frequency of sampling. For example, ecosystem bacterial composition may be assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequence profiling, and metabolic output may be assessed using metabolomic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; Current Protocols article: Ganobis et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0005]). Regular (e.g., daily) sampling coupled with techniques such as moving window analysis allow assessment of equilibrium in the ecosystem, allowing the user to ascertain when the microbial community has reached a level of stability where experimental perturbation can be performed with minimal confounding effects (steady-state; Oliphant et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-bib-0014]). Consideration should also be given to the volume of sample to be taken from a given vessel; this sample removal should not in itself disturb ecosystem equilibrium. In our hands, removal of no more than 10% of the total volume of a bioreactor supporting a human adult-derived gut microbial ecosystem at steady-state does not appreciably alter the equilibrium, though for other types of ecosystems the maximum sampling volume should be determined empirically before experimentation. A major benefit of the in vitro model system is the ability to rapidly retrieve and either preserve or directly analyze samples, a feature that lends itself well to the study of labile molecules such as RNA. Withdrawn samples can be directly frozen at −80ºC in the described bioreactor growth medium (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-prot-0001]), which maintains viable cells and NMR-detectable intact metabolites for at least 1 year.\nMaterials\n70% ethanol solution\nFreshly prepared 10% (v/v) bleach solution in water\nSterilized deionized water\n250-ml polypropylene graduated cylinder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 03-007-42)\n2-ml sterile screw cap tubes with O-ring seals (Axygen, cat. no.

Place the sampling port cap onto the Kimwipe.\n4. Use a sterile cotton swab dipped in 10% bleach solution to liberally wipe the septum. Wait 2 min. Use another sterile cotton swab to blot the septum dry.\n5. Attach a 5-ml syringe to the end of a sampling needle, being careful to use aseptic technique. Firmly pierce septum with the needle tip and push carefully into the liquid.\nMake sure the needle stays straight and does not touch the impeller at the base of the vessel.\n6. Slowly draw up liquid into the syringe to the amount desired. This should be a volume of no more than 10% of the vessel content in any 24-hr period. Pull needle above the liquid surface in the vessel and withdraw remaining liquid in the needle into the syringe by gently pulling on the plunger until bubbles form in the syringe.\n7. Carefully remove syringe with the needle from the vessel. Place needle, sharp end down, into a 250-ml graduated cylinder to protect it and to prevent accidental needlesticks.\nNeedles may be cleaned and reused (see Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-prot-0006]).",
    "8. Carefully detach syringe from the needle and use the syringe to fill the sample tubes with up to 2 ml liquid. Dispose of syringe appropriately after use.\nTo withdraw a larger volume, use larger syringes and multiple sample tubes or conical tubes as desired.\n9. If not used immediately, transfer sample tubes to a −80°C freezer.\n10. Disinfect septum by wetting a cotton swab with 10% bleach solution and liberally wiping it on the septum. Wait 2 min and then use another cotton swab to dry the septum.\n11. Clean any residual bleach from the port by dipping a sterilized cotton swab into sterile water and carefully cleaning any areas touched with bleach. Dry with a further sterile cotton swab.\nThorough removal of bleach solution helps to protect the bioreactor lid components from corrosion.\n12. Replace the blanking port in the septum collar.",

Cut four 10-cm lengths of silicone tubing and tie a knot in each, ∼1 cm from one end. Affix the open end of each tube onto each of the four connector ports on the bottle cap. Loosen cap by one turn and autoclave to sterilize.\nRecommended: Place conical tubes with loosened lids into an anaerobic chamber the night before the vessels are to be harvested.\n2. Complete any desired small volume daily sampling of the vessel following Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-prot-0012].\n3. Standing within reach of the bioreactor, spray a razor blade and the top of the 250-ml bottle with 70% ethanol. Use the razor blade to make a small slit in the side of one of the knotted tubes to facilitate its removal.",
    "4. Remove the knotted tube from the bottle cap. Quickly uncouple effluent tubing from the effluent bottle (tubing A in Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.737#cpz1737-fig-0010]) and position it on the now empty port on the collection bottle cap. Allow to stand 2 min to permit gas to displace any oxygen in the bottle. Meanwhile, spray effluent port on the vessel with 70% ethanol and leave for 2 min.\n5. Turn off the vessel pumps controlling pH and medium addition, and the impeller.\n6. Slowly lower effluent pipe to the bottom of the vessel.\nThe pressure from the nitrogen gas input of the vessel will slowly push the liquid out of the effluent pipe and into the 250-ml bottle.\n7. Once all vessel contents have been transferred, unclamp the bulldog clip on the tubing connected to the condenser.\nThis will release any pressure in the vessel.\n8. Switch off the bioreactor unit and close the nitrogen gas valve. Use bulldog clips to clamp the effluent tubing ∼5 cm from the vessel and again 5 cm from the collection bottle. Use scissors to cut the tubing ∼5 cm beyond the clamp at the collection vessel end.\nIf the viability of the vessel contents is to be preserved, it is recommended that the collection bottle be placed into an anaerobic chamber as soon as possible.\n9. Cut effluent tubing ∼5 cm beyond the bulldog clip at the effluent collection bottle. Tie a knot in the end of this tubing and remove bulldog clip.\nSealing the effluent collection bottle in this way will reduce the escape of any odorous vapors.\n10. Remove pH probe from the vessel lid and use the pH porthole to fill the vessel with 200 ml deionized water. Replace probe.

    "The pH probe should not be allowed to dry out.\n11. Use a 50-ml serological pipet to transfer material from the 250-ml bottle to conical tubes or other storage containers, label, and preserve at −80ºC or as desired.\nIf the viability of the vessel contents is to be conserved, carry out this step in an anaerobic chamber. Placing plastic storage containers such as conical tubes into the anaerobic chamber overnight before use helps to remove absorbed oxygen and can be helpful if samples are expected to be particularly sensitive to oxygen.

Switch off stir plates and wipe down their surfaces with mild detergent diluted in warm water. Wipe dry with paper towel.\n3. Unplug the leads connecting the pH and temperature sensor probes to base unit CPU from the vessel. Recap pH probe.\nIf the temperature sensor is resisting removal from the port, add warm water to loosen any built-up debris. Do not remove the temperature probe by force as this risks damaging the cable.\n4. Using bulldog clips, clamp the ends of the medium feed, and acid and base tubing, ∼10 cm from the respective ports on the bioreactor lid. Cut each of these tubing lengths ∼6 cm from the vessel lid and tie a knot on the remnant tubing connected to the vessel.\n5. Use bulldog clips to clamp the gas addition tubing both before and after the 50-mm filter, ∼6 cm from each end.",
    "Clamping the tubing in this way prevents liquid from traveling up the tube and damaging the large gas filter. These filters can be autoclaved and reused for a total of four times.\n6. Cut a 25- × 15-cm piece of aluminum foil. Wrap the large filter with this foil along with the sparger tubing connector.\n7. Cut a 10- × 10-cm strip of aluminum foil.

During the autoclave run, clean the base unit by wiping down all surfaces with soapy water, rinsing with deionized water, and wiping with paper towel to thoroughly dry. Carefully remove each pump head from its support pins and clean behind each before replacing them.\nAny inadvertent spills from the vessel during a run can pool on the base unit, dry and corrode the surfaces, and so it is important to wash down the base unit after every run.\n11. Remove vessel from the autoclave and cool for at least 1 hr, or until the glass vessels can be handled comfortably.",
    "Placing the autoclaved vessel into a fume hood while cooling helps to contain offensive odors.\n12.
