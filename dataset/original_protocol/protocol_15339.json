    "1. Preparation of Medium, Compounds, and Reagents\nPrepare B16F10 growth complete medium. Supplement Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PEST).\n\t\nTo make 500 mL of complete medium, mix 445 mL of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 50 mL of FBS and 5 mL of PEST in a 1 L sterilized glass bottle. After mixing gently, filter the medium through a 0.2-µm bottle-top filter to a new sterilized glass bottle and then store at 4 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: All cell culture techniques should be undertaken in microbiological safety cabinet using aseptic technique to ensure sterility.\nPrepare lysis buffer: 20 mM Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) buffer at pH 7.5 (pH adjusted with HCl). This buffer can be used for 3 months when stored at room temperature (RT). Add protease inhibitors to the lysis buffer right before use.\nPrepare tyrosinase inhibitor assay buffer. Prepare 1 M NaH2PO4 (monobasic) and 1 M Na2HPO4 (dibasic) stock solutions. Mix 46.3 mL of Na2HPO4 and 53.7 mL of NaH2PO4 to prepare a final volume of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8).\n\t\nDilute the resulting mixture to 1 L (final volume) with H2O. Adjust the pH of the final solution to 6.8. This buffer can be used for 1 month when stored at 4 °C.\nPrepare tyrosinase substrate solution: 0.1% 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA, w/v) dissolved in tyrosinase inhibitor assay buffer (refer to Step 1.3).\n\tCAUTION: Keep on ice while in use.\nOptionally, prepare 100 U/mL mushroom tyrosinase. Dissolve the lyophilized mushroom tyrosinase in tyrosinase inhibitor assay buffer. This solution can be used for 2 months when stored at –20 °C. The mushroom tyrosinase activity as well as cellular tyrosinase activity are calculated in the presence of cell materials.",
    "CAUTION: The solution is aliquoted before freezing thus repeated freezing-and-thawing can be avoided. Keep the solution on ice while in use.\nPrepare 1 N NaOH solution. Weigh 4 g of NaOH in a volumetric flask and dissolve it in distilled water to make 100 mL.\nPrepare fixation solution (10% formalin). Dilute 27 mL of 37% formaldehyde with 73 mL of distilled water. Prepare fresh daily.\nPrepare ammoniacal silver stock solution. Prepare 5 mL of 10% silver nitrate solution in a volumetric flask. Add ammonium hydroxide solution dropwise, until the precipitate is completely dissolved. Add 200 μL of silver nitrate solution (10%). The solution will become slightly cloudy.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid contact and inhalation. Use a fume hood.\nPrepare ammoniacal silver working solution. Dilute 2.5 mL of ammoniacal silver stock solution with 7.5 mL of distilled water. Use once and then discard.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid contact and inhalation. Use a fume hood.\nPrepare 0.1% gold chloride. Prepare 1 mL of 10% gold chloride and add 99 mL of distilled water in a volumetric flask. Prepare fresh daily.\nPrepare phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Add 8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44 g of Na2HPO4 and 0.24 g of KH2PO4 in 800 mL of distilled water. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl. Dilute the resulting mixture to 1 L (final volume) with distilled water.\nPrepare 5% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate solution dissolved in distilled water.\n2. Cell Culture and Treatment\nUse commercially available B16F10 cells. Maintain the B16F10 cells in complete medium. Keep the cell culture flask in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator at 37 °C.\nPrepare test compounds, inhibitor positive control, and negative control samples.\n\t\nDissolve the test compounds in the appropriate solvents. Dissolve water soluble compounds in double-distilled water. Dissolve water insoluble compounds in appropriate organic solvent, e.g., DMSO.",
    "Here, use arbutin dissolved in double-distilled water (125 μg/mL) as a positive control to assess the hypopigmentation activity compared with test compounds or a negative control. As a negative control (vehicle-treated control), use the solutions or buffers used in the test sample, e.g., double-distilled water, DMSO, ethanol.\nCell seeding and treatment\n\t\nSeed B16F10 cells at 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well culture plates using complete medium and incubate in a CO2 incubator for 24 h. After incubation, aspirate the complete medium.\nIncubate cells with DMEM medium (without FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) containing either test compounds, an inhibitor control, or a negative control in a CO2 incubator for 72 h. Check cells every 24 h under the microscope. After this step, go to Steps 3-5 for further experiments.\n\t\tCAUTION: The mixture of the test substance and DMEM medium should be filtered through a 0.2 μm filter.\n3. Measuring Cellular Tyrosinase Activity\nUsing the method described in Step 2, remove media and rinse cells twice with 300 μL of cold PBS.\nPlace the cell culture plate on ice. Add 300 μL of lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min. Then collect the cell lysate using a cell scraper and transfer the cell lysate to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nHomogenize the cell lysate with a cell homogenizer at 14,500 rpm for 2 s, 3 times on ice to obtain intracellular tyrosinase. Use the optimum condition specific for the homogenizer.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C and transfer the cell supernatant to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube. Keep on ice while in use.\nTransfer 70 μL of the supernatant to a 96-well clear polystyrene microplate.",
