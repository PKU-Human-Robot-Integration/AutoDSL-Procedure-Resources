    "1. Work-up and clinical counseling\nNOTE: In case of patients requiring fertility preservation for oncologic reasons, ensure that there is no waiting list for scheduling consultation, and the appointment is provided as soon as possible.\nExamine the medical history and previous documentation, and assess the patient's general health status.\nRecord all information (including the oncologist's approval to undergo ovarian stimulation in case of cancer patients) in a relational database.\nProvide the patient with specific counseling about the feasibility of the procedure. Explain the steps of the procedure (ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, oocyte vitrification), and inform her about the realistic chances of success (mainly dependent on maternal age and expected number of MII oocytes at the time of oocyte retrieval), as well as the cost and limitations of the procedure.\nPerform transvaginal ultrasound to obtain information on the ovarian reserve (i.e., AFC) and to assess the accessibility of the ovaries for egg collection.\nRequest blood tests to assess blood group and Rhesus factor, coagulation screening (blood count, prothrombin, thromboplastin, fibrinogen, Protein C, Protein S, anti-thrombin III, homocysteine), and infectious diseases (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory/Treponema pallidum Hemagglutination Assay).\n\tNOTE: In case of patients accessing a fertility preservation program for non-urgent medical reasons, a more comprehensive assessment may include basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, AMH, breast examination, Papanicolaou test, genetic screening of coagulation (factor V of Leiden and prothrombin), and TORCH screening (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus).\nRequest a cardiological evaluation (electrocardiogram).\nRecommend psychological counseling.\n2. Controlled ovarian stimulation protocols for fertility preservation",
    "NOTE: When the time available before starting the cancer treatment is limited, the random-start protocol (i.e., starting ovarian stimulation at any time during the menstrual cycle) is recommended for the ovarian stimulation in oncologic patients who are candidates for fertility preservation. In a fertility preservation program for non-urgent medical reasons or social reasons, conventional stimulation starting in the early follicular phase is preferable, and ovarian stimulation is started based on the menstrual cycle. Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) approaches should be performed according to the recent European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) guidelines24.\nTailor COS according to the patient's characteristics and ovarian reserve markers, mainly maternal age, FSH, AMH, and AFC.\nStart COS on day 5 of the menstrual cycle using recombinant or urinary FSH with a fixed dose of 150-300 IU/day (antagonist protocol).\n\tNOTE: In a specific patient population with LH deficiency or poor-suboptimal response, additional LH 75/150 IU/day may be administered according to the ovarian response, LH levels, and the gynecologist's judgement.\nIn patients with estrogen-sensitive diseases, include gonadotropins associated with aromatase inhibitors (letrozole) from day 1 of stimulation until day 7 after oocyte retrieval.\nAdminister a fixed dose of gonadotropins for 4 days.\nMonitor follicular growth on day 5 and then every 2-3 days; eventually, adjust the gonadotropin dosage.\nOnce at least 3 follicles reach 17-18 mm in diameter, administer the trigger for final oocyte maturation with a single subcutaneous bolus of GnRH agonist at the dose of 0.5 mL.\n3. Oocyte retrieval\nPreparing for oocyte retrieval",
    "For materials required, refer to the Table of Materials, and keep ready laboratory footwear and outfit, surgical facemask, hair cover, surgical gloves, a permanent non-toxic marker, tweezers, sterile small gauzes, disposable or reusable speculum, vaginal surgery equipment and surface disinfectant. Ensure the availability of resuscitation equipment, anesthetic drugs for reversal, a kit prepared for the treatment of anaphylactic shock, and oxygen in the operating room.\nPerform the oocyte retrieval procedure according to the recommendations of the ESHRE Working Group on Ultrasound in assisted reproduction technologies (ART)25.\n\t\t\nAdminister sedation or general anesthesia, and antibiotics for prophylaxis.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: In this protocol, deep sedation was achieved by administrating propofol (whose dosage is adjusted according to the patient's weight) and 50-100 µg of fentanyl, 1000 mg of paracetamol, and assisted mask ventilation with oxygen.\nPerform oocyte retrieval using an aspiration unit composed of a vacuum pump, a collection tube connected to a 17 G single-lumen needle, and an oocyte-collecting tube. During the collection, do not exceed a pressure of ~120 mmHg to avoid the risk of damage to the oocytes such as stripping off the cumulus cells or fracturing the zona pellucida.\nCalibrate working surface temperature to ensure 37 °C in the culture media. During the whole procedure, minimize oocyte exposure to even transient temperature that may affect their developmental competence.\nAt the end of oocyte retrieval, observe the patient for 3-4 h before discharge.\nOperation theater\n\t\nBefore entering the operating room, identify the patient and confirm the time of ovulation trigger.\nHave the patient lie down on the operating table in a gynecological position.\nCleanse the vagina/cervix prior to oocyte retrieval to minimize bacterial contamination.\nPerform a preliminary transvaginal ultrasound to assess the position of the ovaries and the anatomical relationships with the various organs and blood vessels.",
    "Under ultrasound guidance, insert a single-lumen needle through the vaginal wall and into an ovarian follicle, taking care not to injure the organs or blood vessels located between the vaginal wall and the ovary.\nStart aspiration from the closest follicle and moving on to the most distal ones.\nPuncture all follicles of a diameter larger than 11-12 mm, performing \"twisting movements\" of the needle to aspirate the whole follicular fluid, which is then released into a sterile tube (round bottom 14 mL) preheated in the block heater of the operating room.\nImmediately after retrieval, seal and label the tube with details of the patient's identity.\nEnsure that the nurse brings the tube to the laboratory, where it is immediately screened for the presence of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).\nInstruct the embryologists to inform the clinician of the total number of COCs retrieved.\nOnce the procedure is complete for the first ovary, flush the needle with clean medium, and proceed with the second ovary using the same procedure.\nAfter oocyte retrieval, evaluate any bleeding from the ovaries or blood vessels of the parametrium and free fluid in the pouch of Douglas.\n\t\t​NOTE: To automate and improve the effectiveness of gamete and embryo traceability at the clinical level, an electronic witnessing system (EWS) was implemented in the center26. Nevertheless, this protocol does not mention the EWS, to ensure reproducibility of the protocol in any IVF laboratory. Still, consider that all steps of the procedure require a second operator (i.e. a witness) to ensure gamete and embryo traceability.\n4. IVF laboratory\nThe day before the oocyte retrieval procedure\n\t\nPrepare oocyte collecting tubes (refer to the Table of Materials).",
    "Dispense 1 mL of IVF medium (refer to the Table of Materials) in each oocyte collection tube (round bottom, 5 mL), and cover with 0.2 mL of mineral oil (refer to the Table of Materials) for embryo culture.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: The number of tubes will be defined according to the number of follicles expected to be retrieved. Each tube might contain up to 4 COCs.\nSeal the tubes with the cap (first snap). Label the tubes with details of the type of medium and date of preparation. Incubate the tubes overnight at 37 °C in a controlled atmosphere (6% CO2, 5% 02).\nOn the day of the oocyte retrieval\n\t\nPrewarm the plastic supplies at 37 °C (sterile culture dishes and Pasteur pipettes).\nAsk the patients to confirm their identity (full name and date of birth) and the time of ovulation trigger. Annotate on the laboratory sheet that the identification (ID) procedure has been accomplished, and that the time of ovulation trigger has been confirmed.\nTake the oocyte collection tubes off the incubator (right before the procedure begins), and push down the cap to ensure tight closure. Label the oocyte collection tubes with the patient's information. Place the oocyte collection tubes in the block heater at 37 °C.\nExamine the follicular fluid in the prewarmed sterile culture dishes, and identify COCs. Once one or more COCs are identified, rinse them twice in two drops of medium to remove the follicular fluid and blood contamination.\nTransfer the COCs to the oocyte collection tubes and annotate the number of COCs on the tube. Loosen the caps of the medium tubes, and promptly incubate them at 37 °C in an a atmosphere of 6% CO2, 5% O2.\nRepeat steps 7 to 9 according to the number of oocytes retrieved. Update the laboratory sheet.",
    "​NOTE: Ensure that a witness checks that all the tube-warming blocks (including the ones in the operating theater) are empty and signs the closing of the procedure on the laboratory sheet.\nWipe down the working stage after completion of the procedure.\n5. Oocyte denudation\nPrewarm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered medium and hyaluronidase (refer to the Table of Materials) at 37 °C at least 1 h before starting.\nPrepare a 4-well IVF plate (refer to the Table of Materials) with 0.6 mL/well of prewarmed HEPES-buffered medium (supplemented with 5% human serum albumin [HSA]) covered with 0.3 mL of mineral oil for embryo culture, and warm at 37 °C for at least 30 min.\nLabel the oocyte denudation plate with details of the patient's identity.\nImmediately before starting the procedure, add hyaluronidase to the first well to obtain a final concentration of about 20 IU/mL.\nPlace a limited number of COCs (up to 6) in the first well containing the enzyme to disperse the cumulus cells.\nTo enhance enzymatic removal of the cumulus and corona cells, perform the stripping of cumulus cells by pipetting the oocytes repeatedly through a Pasteur pipette with an inner diameter of approximately 250 μm for up to 30 s. After initial cell dissociation is observed, transfer the oocytes to the second well containing only HEPES-buffered medium, taking care to carry over a minimum amount of the enzyme.\nPerform further denudation to remove the corona cells by using denuding pipettes with decreasing inner diameters (170-145 µm). Use lower diameters (135µm) only if strictly necessary.\nCarefully wash the denuded oocytes to wash out the enzyme.\nAfter denudation, examine the oocytes under an inverted microscope to assess their integrity and stage of maturation. Separate MII oocytes from the immature ones (germinal vesicle and metaphase-I).",
    "Move the MII oocytes to the vitrification area to immediately perform cryopreservation. Update the laboratory sheet.\n6. Oocyte vitrification\nNOTE: Perform oocyte vitrification preferably within 38 h of oocyte retrieval and immediately after denudation. The vitrification procedure described here has to be accomplished at room temperature (RT) and by using a stripper pipette with an inner diameter of 170 µm so as not to damage oocytes during manipulation.\nApproximately 30 min before the procedure, bring the equilibration solution (ES) and vitrification solution (VS) to RT (25-27 °C).\nProperly label the cryodevices with the patient's name and ID, treatment ID, date of freezing, number of oocytes, and cryobarcode.\nFill a disposable cooling rack up to the top with fresh liquid nitrogen, and start the sterilization process.\nLabel the vitrification plate (refer to the Table of Materials) with the patient's name and ID. Ask a witness to check the correct ID of the cryodevices.\nCarefully invert each vial twice to mix its contents before use, and prepare the lid of a 6 mm Petri dish with one drop of 30 µL of HEPES-buffered medium (with 5% HSA) and one adjacent drop of 30 µL of ES.\n\tNOTE: Place drops just before use to limit medium evaporation.\nUsing a 170 µm diameter stripper pipette, place the oocytes (up to 9) in the first drop with the smallest possible volume of medium. Using the stripper pipette, create a bridge of medium between the drop n.1 and n.2 to obtain a gradual increase in concentration of the CPAs (Figure 1A).",
    "Incubate the oocytes in the first drop for 3 minutes. Add a third drop of 30 µL of ES (n.3). After 3 min, transfer the oocytes into the second drop of ES, and create a medium bridge between drops n.3 and n.2 (Figure 1B). Incubate the oocytes in drop n.3 for 3 min.\nDuring the incubation, add one 30 µL drop of ES for each cryodevice that will be used (if 9 oocytes are to be cryopreserved, place 3 drops of ES with 3 oocytes in each drop of ES). Move the oocytes into pure ES solution, and leave them for 6-9 min (until they recover their initial size after shrinkage) (Figure 1C).\nPrepare a central well dish (60 x 15 mm) with 1 mL of VS. At the end of the first 6 min, transfer the oocytes to be cryopreserved into the VS solution, releasing as little medium as possible. Leave the oocytes in VS for 1 min, and wash them carefully by moving them from the bottom to the top of the dish to remove the excess of ES.\nApproximately 10 s before the end of the minute of incubation, place the cryodevice under the microscope, and adjust the focus on the black mark (i.e., the tip of the cryodevice). Place the oocytes on the cryodevice beside the black mark with the minimum amount of VS (Figure 2A).\nMove the stripper pipette away from the oocytes, and remove the excess of VS medium (Figure 2B) so that the oocytes remain covered by a thin layer of medium (Figure 2C).",
    "Quickly plunge the cryodevice in liquid nitrogen, rapidly shaking it to remove air bubbles from its surface. Hold the protective cap of the cryodevice with tweezers, and fill it with liquid nitrogen; then insert the cryodevice into it while keeping the propylene strips in liquid nitrogen.\nStore the cryodevice in a visiotube previously labeled with the patient's information. Update the laboratory sheet.\n7. Oocyte warming\nApproximately 30 min before the procedure, warm the thawing solution (TS), dilution solution (DS), and washing solution (WS) to RT (25-27 °C). Carefully invert each vial twice to mix its contents. Place 1 mL of TS in a central well Petri dish, and warm it at 37 °C for at least 1 h before starting the procedure.\nLabel all plastic supplies with the patient's name and ID and the type of solution. Ask a witness to confirm the patient's information on the cryodevice.\nFor each cryodevice to be warmed, prepare a 6-well plate with 200 µL of DS in the first well and an equal amount of WS in the second and third ones (named WS1 and WS2, respectively). Add phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or sterile water in the area outside the wells to prevent evaporation.\nTake the TS dish out from the incubator, and place it under the microscope. Adjust the focus of the microscope to the center of the Petri dish.\nCarefully twist and remove the protective cap of the cryodevice, while keeping the propylene strips in liquid nitrogen. Transfer the cryodevice from liquid nitrogen into the TS as quickly as possible to avoid the risk of devitrification and initiate the countdown (1 min).\nLocalize the oocytes by focusing on the tip of the cryodevice (i.e., the black mark). Using a stripper pipette, release the oocytes from the cryodevice.",
    "NOTE: Try not to aspirate the oocytes from the cryodevice; gently release some media on them until they move into the TS.\nUsing a 170 µm diameter stripper pipette, transfer the oocytes to DS with a little amount of TS (to create a gradient), and leave them in the DS for 3 min. Move the oocytes to WS1 likewise, and leave them for 5 min. Finally, transfer the oocytes to WS2 for 1 min.\nTransfer the oocytes into an appropriate preequilibrated IVF culture medium, and incubate them for 1 h before proceeding with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Update the laboratory sheet.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
