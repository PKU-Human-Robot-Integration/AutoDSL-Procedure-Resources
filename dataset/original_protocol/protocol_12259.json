    "NOTE: All procedures for animal breeding and cares were conducted according to the IACUC regulations of Sahmyook University, Seoul, S. Korea.\n1. Superovulation, Breeding and Oviduct Isolation\nMaintain inbred C57BL/6 mice under the following conditions: 22 ± 3 °C, ~60% humidity, 12 hr light/dark cycle, and water and food ad libitum.\nInduce superovulation of 3-5 week-old female mice by an intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) at 0.1 ml/head followed 48 hr later by an intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at 0.1 ml/head.\nImmediately following hCG injection, mate superovulation-induced females with sexually mature males of the same strain by keeping them in the same cage overnight.\nNext morning, confirm successful mating by the presence of a mating plug or vaginal plug on the female genital tract.\nSacrifice pregnant female mice by CO2 intoxication followed by cervical dislocation 18-20 hr after hCG injection.\nOpen the abdominal cavity by cutting the skin and then the peritoneal layer with fine scissors.\nPick up the uterine horns with fine forceps and pull away the uterus, oviduct, ovary, and fat pad gently from the body cavity.\nCut the area between the oviduct and the ovary with fine scissors. Reposition the forceps and cut the uterus near the oviduct, leaving at least 1 cm of the upper part of the uterus attached.\nTransfer the oviductal ampulla to a 35 mm Petri dish containing M16 medium at room temperature. Pool the oviducts from several mice in the same dish.\nPlace the dishes under a stereomicroscope for retrieval of embryos.\n2. Retrieval and Culture of 2-Pronuclear (2-PN) Embryos\nCut the end of a 30 or 32 G hypodermic needle, grind it into a blunt tip, and use it as a flushing needle.",
    "Use fine forceps to slide the end of the oviduct onto the flushing needle. Gently press the tip of the flushing needle against the bottom of the dish to hold it in place. Flush the oviduct with ~0.1 ml of M16 medium to release the 2-PN embryos into a Petri dish.\nRecover the 2-PN embryos along with surrounding cumulus masses from the flushed M16 medium under the stereomicroscope using a sterile glass pipette and transfer them into a new Petri dish.\nDissociate cumulus cells from the 2-PN embryos by enzymatic digestion with 1.0 ml of 0.1-0.5% hyaluronidase in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) at 37 °C for 5-10 min.\nDenude embryos by gently pipetting with a glass pipette and physical removal of cumulus cells.\nWash denuded embryos three times with 30-50 ml of fresh phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) per embryo.\nIncubate embryos in a 35 mm plastic Petri dish in M16 media supplemented with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA, Fraction V) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator until the microinjection is made, which is usually less than 4 hr later.\n3. Embryo Reverse Transcription (RT) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\nCollect at least 10 embryos from each stage up to the blastocyst stage and pool them in 4.0 μl of 5x reverse transcriptase pre-mixture solution containing reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitor, oligo dT primer, random 6mers, dNTP mixture, and the reaction buffer in a PCR tube.\nAdd RNase-free distilled H2O to a total volume of 20 μl and sonicate the pooled embryos for 30 sec at 200 W. Initiate the RT reaction immediately at 42 °C for 1 hr followed by 5 min incubation at 95 °C.",
    "For each 5.0 μl of cDNA solution generated, conduct normal PCR amplification with primers for neogenin, Cdx2, Sox2, Tead4, Nanog, Oct3/4, or β-actin (primer sequences given in Table 1. PCR consists of 40 cycles of 15 sec incubation at 95 °C, 30 sec at annealing temperature (shown in Table 1), and 30 sec at 72 °C.\nSeparate PCR products by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and visualize the gel under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide.\nNormalize target gene expression against β-actin levels.\n4. Immunocytochemistry of Embryos\nFix embryos from each stage with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature followed by a brief washing 3 times with PBS containing 0.01% BSA.\nPermeabilize Cell membranes by incubating 10 embryos in 1.0 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% TritonX-100 at room temperature for 10 min.\nTo block nonspecific binding incubate the permeabilized embryos in 1.0 ml of PBS supplemented with 10% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubate the blocked embryos with rabbit anti-neogenin antibodies at 1:100 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% BSA overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter three washes for 30 sec each in drops of PBS, incubate embryos with either Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:500 dilution in PBS/BSA solution overnight at 4 °C.\nTo visualize actin filaments, incubate embryos in 1 µg/ml phalloidin in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature.\nStain the nuclei by adding 5 ml PBS containing 1 µg/ml DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride) for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash embryos three times briefly with PBS.\nTransfer embryos to a glass slide and cover them with a drop of mineral oil.\nTake images at 1,000X magnification with a confocal microscope with an excitation of the appropriate wave length.",
    "5. Preparation of Neogenin-RFP and Neogenin-siRNA GFP Plasmids\nSubclone cDNA encoding mouse neogenin into a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP)-containing vector, resulting in neogenin-flag-RFP.\nSubclone small hairpin RNA targeting neogenin into an Emerald Green Fluorescent Protein (EmGFP)-containing vector, resulting in pcDNA-EmGFP-miR-neogenin (shown in Figure 1).\nAmplify both neogenin-flag-RFP and pcDNA-EmGFP-miR-neogenin plasmids and purify them with conventional methods.\nAdjust the final concentrations of plasmids to ~1.0 µg/ml in sterile Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer.\n6. Microinjection of Plasmids into 2-PN Embryos\nWash the denuded 2-PN embryos once, briefly, with fresh M16 media.\nCentrifuge the 2-PN embryos for 10 min at 1,000 x g in a table-top centrifuge to allow for observation of the pronuclei.\nIncubate the embryos in a micro drop of 20-30 µl of M16 media per embryo under mineral oil at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for an additional 1-2 hr.\nManufacture injection pipettes and holding pipettes by pulling borosilicate-glass capillary tubing (O.D = 1.2 mm; I.D = 0.94 mm) with a mechanical puller.\nFabricate injection pipettes to have blunt tips and polished openings of <500 µm tip length and 1-2 µm tip inner diameter using a microgrinder and a microforger.\nFabricate holding pipettes such that they have blunt tips and polished openings with an inner diameter of 20 µm and an outer diameter of 100 µm.\nLoad injection pipettes with a sufficient amount (>200 nl) of plasmid solution at 1.0 µg/µl.\nMicroinject  ~10 pl of plasmid solution for each 2-PN embryo into one of the pronuclei using a microinjector attached to a motorized micromanipulator; during this process, keep embryos in position by applying negative pressure with a holding pipette.\nAfter microinjection, wash the 2-PN embryos 3 times with fresh M16 media for less than 1 min each time.",
    "Culture the 2-PN embryos in a drop of fresh M16 media on a plastic culture dish covered by a mineral oil drop to prevent media evaporation.\nObserve the embryos at 24 hr intervals under a differential interference contrast (DIC) inverted microscope at 200X magnification.\nSubscription Required.
