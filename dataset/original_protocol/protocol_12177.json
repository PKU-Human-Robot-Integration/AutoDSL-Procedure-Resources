    "All the animal procedures are in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and are approved by the local Animal Care Committee (Canton of Fribourg, Switzerland).\n1. Animal Preparation\nExperimental animals\n\t\nPerform experiments on adult male wild type and transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background) of 3-5 months of age. The three groups of mice correspond to wild type littermate controls (group A, Jagged1 flox/flox19) and two conditional KO mouse lines (group B, Jagged1ncKO and C, Jagged1gcKO).\nHouse mice under standard laboratory conditions in a ventilated room, with a 12 hr controlled dark/light cycle and provide food and water ad libitum.\n2. Experimental Setup\nExperimental arena\n\t\nFor the experimental arena, use a clean sterilized mouse cage (36 cm length x 20.5 cm width x 13.5 cm height) (Figure 1A).\nAssign each mouse to a numbered cage with fresh bedding, 3 cm high. If cages are reused, as in the odor sensitivity test, take the following measures to avoid cross-contamination between odors and mice.\n\t\t\nMark the water side.\nClean the narrower walls of the cages with two tissue papers sprayed with 70% ethanol, one for each side.\nPile up cages according to the genotype of the mice and store temporarily under a laminar hood.\nCamera\n\t\nMount a camera on a customized tripod with the objective at 58 cm from the bottom of the cage (Figure 1A). Fix the position of the Tripod and the cage and delimit with marks to allow for the camera to be centered on the top of the cage.\nRecord videos at 320 pixels x 240 pixels, 15.08 frames per second as MOV files.\nOdors\n\t\nResuspend the scents, when indicated, in the solvent in which they are soluble.",
    "For the preference test use peanut butter. Resuspend the peanut butter in peanut oil (10% w/v).\nFor the avoidance test use pure 2-Methylbutyric (2-MB) acid (98%).\nFor the sensitivity test, use female urine from the same mouse colony and background (C57BL/6).\n\t\t\nFor convenience collect the urine 1-2 days prior to the olfactory test. Restrain and hold the mouse under the hood with its belly above the cage grid. Under the cage grid place a plastic petri dish to collect the drops of urine.\nCollect the urine from each female in a 1.5 ml tube and mix all the urine samples to normalize for variability between animals. Store at -20 °C until use.\nOn the day of the experiment, thaw the urine and perform 4 dilutions in double distilled water at a dilution factor of 10 (1:10, 1:100; 1:1,000; 1:10,000).\n3. Olfactory Testing\nNote: In this protocol odors have been deliberately chosen which are perceived as strong attractants (peanut butter and female urine) or strong repellent (2-MB acid)15. It is important to carry out the preference and sensitivity tests to pleasant odors prior to the avoidance test to eliminate the possibility of any interference with the olfactory behavior. Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity, in this paper, preference and avoidance test will be both described under the perception test. Each behavioral session starts with a habituation phase.\nHabituation Phase\n\t\nPlace the animal in the clean assigned cage and let it explore for 5 min (Figure 1B). Since the environment of the experimental cage is familiar to the home cage, this short time is enough to allow for habituation.",
    "If the sensitivity test is completed in one day, perform habituation only once before the application of the highest diluted odor. If the sensitivity test is carried out on different days, on each day a habituation phase on a new clean cage is needed.\nPerception Test\n\t\nAfter habituation, activate the camera and immediately pipette 60 μl of the pleasant scent (peanut butter) and 60 μl of the neutral scent (tap water) onto the opposite walls of the cage at about 10 cm from the bottom (Figure 1C).\nLet the mouse explore the odors for 2 min (Figure 1D). Thereafter, switch off the camera.\nAt this point, proceed with the next mouse starting from the habituation phase. Perform the avoidance test exactly in the same way by applying 60 μl of the repellent odor (2-MB acid) and 60 μl of water.\nSensitivity test\n\t\nEvaluate the attraction threshold of male mice to increasing concentrations of female urine in the following order: 1:10,000; 1:1,000; 1:100; 1:10 and pure urine.\nAfter habituation, expose each mouse to the highest dilution pipetted by the experimenter as previously described in 3.2.1.\nRecord the exploratory behavior of urine versus water, within a 2 min time frame on a video camera. After all mice cohorts are tested for the highest dilution (1:10,000), expose to a higher concentration of urine, as indicated above.\n4. Post-hoc Data Analysis\nNote: All behavioral tests described are processed post hoc following the data analysis instructions.\nOpen MOV Files in ImageJ for Windows systems\n\t\nInstall Quick Time for Java using the customized settings from http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download .\nInstall the Quick Time plugin from the ImageJ website (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/qt-capture.html).\nImport the QTJava.zip (C:\\Program Files\\QuickTime\\QTSystem) into the library extension of ImageJ (.ImageJ\\jre\\lib\\ext).\nCopy also the QTJava.zip in the plugins folder and rename it as QTJava.jar.",
    "Install the six scripts attached in the Macros folder (ImageJ\\plugins\\Macros).\nOpen ImageJ and compile and run the Quick Time plugin, thereafter close ImageJ.\nReopen ImageJ and open the MOV file using File> import> using Quick Time.\nVideo Adjustment\n\t\nOnce the video file is opened in ImageJ, cut the video in order to obtain a constant 2 min exploration from the time the experimenter has pipetted the odorants into the cage (T0). Identify the frame corresponding to the T0 and remove the previous frames using increments of 1 (ImageJ\\Image\\Stacks\\ToolsSlice remover). Use the same command to delete all the frames exceeding the 2 min exploration.\nMake sure that the cage is centered and if necessary use the Image>Transform>Rotate command to align it.\nVideo Processing\n\tNote: Video processing is fully computer-assisted and uses macros commands accompanying this paper.\n\t\nIn order to restrict the area onto the cage of a 127 pixels x 218 pixels size run the Step 1 macro from the Plugin>Macros>Run command. Move the fixed rectangle over the cage (Figure 2, Step 1).\nCrop the area of the cage on the region of interest (ROI) using the Step 2 macro (Figure 2, Step 2).\nUse the Step 3 macro to extract the mouse image from the background by assigning a threshold signal, despeckling and filtering the signal variance. The output values in the Z axis plot indicate the mean grey values, corresponding to the intensity of the mouse shadow moving within the ROI of the “water chamber” during the 2 min exploration. Copy the results into a worksheet named according to the ROI in a spreadsheet file (Figure 2, Step 3).",
    "Use the Step 4 macro to extract the mean grey values of the mouse in the ROI “odor chamber”. Copy the results into a worksheet named according to the ROI in the same spreadsheet file as in 4.3.3 (Figure 2, Step 4).\nIn order to further restrict the analysis of the mouse movement in the ROI “water perimeter” use the Step 5 macro. Copy the result onto the worksheet named according to the ROI in the same spreadsheet file as in 4.3.3 (Figure 2, Step 5).\nTo restrict the analysis of the mouse movement in the ROI “odor perimeter” use the Step 6 macro. Copy the result onto the worksheet named according to the ROI spreadsheet file as in 4.3.3 (Figure 2, Step 6).\nProcess all videos and check for consistency in the number of frames per animals. Here, record all animals for 1,810 frames corresponding to a 2 min exploration session.\nFor each animal and for each ROI sort frames with mean grey values larger than 0. Divide the number of frames by the values corresponding to 1 second and obtain the seconds spent in each ROI.\n5. Statistical Analysis\nFor each test verify homogeneity of variance within groups/ genotypes by Bartlett’s test using the formula available on http://www.real-statistics.com/one-way-analysis-of-variance-anova/homogeneity-variances/ .\nIn the attraction and avoidance test, carry out comparisons between the times spent with water versus odor within one group using a non-directional Student’s t-test assuming equal or unequal variances depending on the results of the Bartlett’s test. Compare the times spent with the odors subtracted by the time spent with water between the genotypes by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test.",
    "In the sensitivity test analyze the comparisons of the time spent with the odor subtracted from the time spent with water among groups at a specific dilutions of urine by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. Compare the sensitivity among groups to growing odor concentrations by 2-Way ANOVA with repetitions with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test.\nInteraction between genotypes and treatments in the attraction and avoidance test are investigated by 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test.\nSubscription Required.
