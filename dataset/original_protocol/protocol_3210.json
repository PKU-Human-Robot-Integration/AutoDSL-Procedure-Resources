    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nLentivirus Production\nTiming: 8 days\nFour days prior to target transfection date, thaw cryopreserved HEK293T Lenti-X cells in a 37°C water bath.\nPlate cells on 2 10 cm dishes at 1.5–2 million cells per plate in 10 mL of HEK media (DMEM, high glucose with pyruvate, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% non-essential amino acids).\nThree days after plating HEK293T Lenti-X cells (24 h prior to transfection), harvest cells from 10 cm plates using 1.5 mL warm TrypLE digest (leave in incubator for 5 min). Wash plate with PBS to collect any remaining cells.\nNote: If cells remain adherent to plate, add an additional 1 mL of TrypLE and incubate for additional 3–5 min, then collect cells.\nSpin HEK293T Lenti-X cells down at 300 × g and resuspend them in 1 mL of PBS. Mix 10 μL of cells with 10 μL of Trypan Blue, take 10 μL of mixture and count by Cell Countess.\nNote: Cells should ideally have a viability of 90%–95%.\nSpin down remaining cells and resuspend in 1 mL of HEK media. Take required volume to plate cells at 11 million cells per T75 flask, and top up to 15 mL with HEK media, then add to T75 flask. One flask for the control virus and one flask for the anti-TAA lentivirus is sufficient, this can easily be scaled up to create more virus.\nNote: Be sure to coat plates evenly with HEK293T Lenti-X cells.\nIncubate overnight (12–18 h) at 37°C. Ensure cells are 95% confluent prior to transfection.\nNote: Gently handle cells to ensure cells remain adhered to the plate.\nFor transfection of HEK293T cells, prepare two series of 15 mL tubes for each flask as outlined in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/298-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Workflow and Preparation of Reagents for Transfection of Plasmids into HEK293T Cells\nReagents should first be prepared in two separate 15 mL screw cap tubes and mixed gently prior to combining the two solutions and incubating at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 20 min. Optimization of volumes and masses may be required depending on the plasmid being used.\nOnce Lipofectamine 3000 and DNA have been added to the cells, gently swirl flasks to ensure even distribution of reagents and place into incubator at 37°C.\nSix hours post transfection, remove media in flasks and replace with 15 mL of warm Lentiviral Packaging Media (LVPM) per flask.\nBy following the above-mentioned steps, HEK293T cells will be prepared and transfected, resulting in the production of lentiviral particles containing the desired CAR construct.\nLentiviral Harvest and Resuspension\nTiming: 2–3 days\nNote: You are working with viral particles from this stage. Ensure that all the disposable plastic ware used such as flasks, pipettes etc., are disposed into 20% bleach solution and kept in bleach for at least 30 min before proper disposal.\n24 h post transfection, collect viral supernatant in individual 50 mL falcon tubes and wrap the cap with paraffin film. Store at 4°C. Replace media in flasks with 15 mL of warm LVPM per flask, and place back in the incubator for 24–48 h.\nPre-cool ultracentrifuge buckets and rotor at 4°C.\n24–48 h post media change, harvest viral supernatant from flasks in individual 50 mL falcon tubes.\nCentrifuge 50 mL falcon tubes containing viral supernatant at 300 × g for 5 min to sediment out any collected cells.\nAdd 30 mL of harvested media containing lentivirus to 38.5 mL ultracentrifuge tubes.\nCritical: This volume is required to prevent tube collapse during centrifugation.",
    "Centrifuge samples at 42,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C with minimal deceleration.\nOnce centrifuged, remove supernatant from tubes and dispense into 20% bleach, being careful to preserve the viral pellet.\nResuspend lentivirus in 200 μL DMEM, being sure to wash down the walls of the tube. Homogenize the viral pellet and resuspend at a final concentration of 200 μL/flask, avoiding bubbles.\nTransfer virus to 1.5 mL viral cryovial aliquots and place in a −80°C freezer.\nDisinfect ultracentrifuge buckets and anything else that has come into contact with virus-containing tubes using 70% ethanol.\nBy performing this step of the protocol lentivirus particles containing the CAR construct will be collected and ready for immediate or future transduction.\nPreparation of Activated T Cells from Frozen Human PBMCs\nTiming: 2 h\nPre-warm supplemented XSFM media in a 37°C water bath and aliquot 7 mL of media into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nThaw PBMCs and add them dropwise to the media. Spin down at 450 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate off media without disturbing the pellet and gently resuspend it in 1 mL of supplemented XSFM. Mix 10 μL of cells and 10 μL of Trypan blue, count cells, and record viability.\nTake the required number of cells, dilute to 1 × 105 cells/100 μL with cytokine supplemented XSFM media.\nActivate T cells with Gibco Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 beads that are in a concentration of 4 × 104 beads/μL.\nResuspend beads by vortexing.\nTransfer beads to a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of PBS with 0.1% BSA, 2 mM EDTA (2 μL of beads for each 100,000 cells and scale up accordingly). Mix gently.",
    "Place beads on DynaMag magnet for 1 min and aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the beads. Remove tube from magnet and resuspend beads in 100 μL per 2 μL of beads of supplemented media.\nAliquot 100 μL of T cells per well into a 96-well round-bottom plate and add 100 μL of Dynabead suspension into each well. Incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nThis section of the protocol results in isolation and activation of T cells from human PBMCs.\nLentiviral Transduction of T Cells\nTiming: 1.5 days\nAfter 18–24 h (day 1), carefully remove 110 μL of media from the wells of the 96-well plate containing the PBMCs and the Dynabeads so as not to disturb the pellet of cells.\nAdd 10 μL viral suspension to transduce at a MOI of 1.\nIncubate overnight (12–18 h) at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nThis step results in human PBMC-derived T cells transduction with the desired CAR construct.\nCAR T Cell Expansion\nTiming: 5+ days (depending on required number of CAR T cells)\nCheck cells daily and assess growth (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] which shows day 3 of T cell expansion).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/298-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Activated Human PBMCs in Culture on Day 3 Post Thaw\nOn day 2, top up 100 μL CAR T cells with XSFM media + hIL2 in each well.\nOn day 4, gently replace 100 μL of spent media with fresh XSFM media + hIL2. Be careful to remove the XSFM only from the top portion of each well without disturbing the cells.",
    "On day 5, the CAR T cells should be ready to move to a larger plate (24-wells). However, the users’ discretion should be used here to determine whether there are a sufficient number of cells for transfer. Move T cells from the 96-well plate to a single well in a 24-well plate containing 900 μL of supplemented XSFM+hIL2 media. Two wells from the 96-well plate should be combined in a single well in the 24-well plate.\nOnce ~95% of the 24-well is covered, transfer cells to a 6-well plate for continued expansion. Cells in a 6-well plate should be kept in a volume of 4–5 mL of XSFM media. Add fresh cytokine supplemented media on alternate days.\nNote: It should be noted that T cells grow best when in close proximity to one another. This should be taken into account before transferring to a larger plate.\nNote: Cells are best kept at a density of 100,000 cells/cm2.\nFollowing the above-mentioned steps in this part of the protocol leads to expansion of large number of CAR T cells, depending on length of expansion.\nCharacterization of CAR T Cells\nTiming: 1–2 h\nRemove CAR T cells transduced with both the control CAR construct and the anti-TAA CAR construct from wells and gently move them to individual 15 mL screw cap tubes. Spin down at 450 × g for 3 min.\nGently resuspend CAR T cells in 1 mL of PBS and mix 10 μL of cells with 10 μL of Trypan Blue. Count with Cell Countess.\nAliquot approximately 1 × 105 CAR T cells from both the control and the anti-TAA tubes, into round-bottom flow cytometry tubes.\nSpin down tubes and aspirate off the supernatant, then resuspend cells in 100 mL PBS.",
    "With the cells on ice, stain cells anti-TAA CAR Ts with anti-NGFR antibody for 15 min, add 2 mL of PBS, spin down, and aspirate off supernatant.\nThen, stain both the control and anti-TAA CAR Ts with anti-c-Myc for 15 min. Add 2 mL of PBS, spin cells down, and add 7-AAD to all tubes. The manufacturer’s recommended antibody dilution for flow cytometry should be used.\nAnalyze by flow cytometry (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/298-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Sample Flow Cytometric Analysis of Control CAR T and Anti-TAA CAR T Tagged with NGFR and NGFR/c-Myc, Respectively\nThis step allows for confirmation of successfully produced CAR T cells, as well as insights into transduction efficiency.\nIntracranial Injections of Patient-Derived Brain Tumor-Initiating Stem Cells (BTICs) into NSG Mice\nTiming: 1 day for injections; engraftment of tumor depends on the cell line used in the experiment\nIn order to preclinically test the anti-tumor effect of generated CAR T cells in GBM model, an in vivo patient-derived xenograft model of treatment-refractory GBM needs to be generated.\nGeneration of patient-derived xenograft model of treatment-refractory GBM:\nInject the patient-derived GBM BTICs into the right frontal lobe of mouse brain (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) (Chokshi et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/298-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The Efficacy of TAA CAR T Treatment on an In Vivo Patient-Derived Xenograft Model\nThe tumor size is significantly reduced in the TAA CAR T treatment cohort compared with the control CAR T treated group.\nConfirm the tumor formation using imaging depending on the engrafted tumor cells (ie., MRI if GBM cells are not labeled and IVIS imaging if GBM cells express luciferase).",
    "Upon confirmation of tumor engraftment, mice will be treated with generated tumor-associated antigen (TAA) specific CAR T cells. The treatment with CAR T cells will start halfway to pre-stablished endpoint.\nTreatment of Patient-Derived Xenograft Mouse Model with Enriched TAA Specific CAR T Cells\nPreparation of enriched CAR T cells for intracranial injections.\nCollect the CAR T cells in a 50 mL falcon tube and spin them down at 450 × g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL PBS and transfer them to an Eppendorf tube.\nPlace the Eppendorf tube in MagnaRack (magnetic separation rack) to remove the Dynabeads.\nCount the CAR T cells and resuspend 1 × 106 in 10 μL PBS for treating each mouse.\nNote: Keep the CAR T cells on ice throughout the injection.\nIntracranial Injection of TAA specific CAR T cells.\nWipe down all equipment and hood with Clidox prior to start.\nBring the mice which were engrafted with GBM tumor into the surgical room.\nPut each animal into anesthetic chamber (2.5% isoflurane + 1 L/min O2).\nTransfer each animal from the anesthetic chamber to the surgical stage.\nPut eye gel on each mouse eyes to protect them from drying.\nRemove the hair from the incision site and wipe the area with two different percentages of iodine (90% and 50%) and 70% ethanol using cotton swaps.\nMake a small incision on the skin and find the injection site.\nDrill a burr hole right on the site of tumor engraftment in the frontal lobe (4–5 mm anterior to the coronal suture, 3 mm lateral to the midline).\nCritical: Creating the burr hole can cause excessive bleeding and post-operative complications if not performed carefully. Make sure the drill is not hitting the blood vessels.",
    "Place the Hamilton syringe on the syringe holder and Rinse it with 70% ethanol and then PBS (3 times each).\nLoad the Hamilton Syringe with 10 μL suspension of CAR T cells (1 × 106 CAR T cells in 10 μL of PBS).\nInject the cells into the drilled burr hole over 1 min (4–5 mm anterior to the coronal suture, 3 mm lateral to the midline, 5 mm deep as depicted in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCritical: Take extra care to slowly push the plunger on the Hamilton syringe down\nat very small intervals to give cells enough time to sit in the brain.\nCritical: After the injection is done, wait for 30 s. This step is necessary to prevent cell flushing out after the injection.\nPull out the needle slowly.\nClose the incision using Maxon stitches and put a droplet of skin glue on it.\nRecord animals’ weight and give them 1 mL saline and 0.5 mL Buprenorphine subcutaneously.\nPut the animals into the cage and place them on a heating pad until they are fully recovered.\nPerfusion and fixation of brain tumor samples (1 week post last CAR T cell treatment).\nAnesthetize mice by injecting 1 mL Avertin i.p. and then cull the mice by cervical dislocation.\nCut the abdomen and the rib cage and then inject 10 mL saline by inserting the needle into the Apex of heart to wash out the blood. Repeat the same step but this time by injecting 10 mL formalin (10%) through the same route to fix the organs.\nCut the skull and remove it slowly without touching the brain tissue.
