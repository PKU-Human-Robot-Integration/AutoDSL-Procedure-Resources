    "All procedures involving animals outlined herein have been approved by the University of Pennsylvania's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Overview of the Testing Apparatus\nThe testing apparatus consists of 24 clear acrylic cylindrical chambers 10 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter (total volume of 200 ml). This size is appropriate for a typical 25 g adult mouse. Chambers have ports at each end for gas inlet and outlet. The outlet end is removable so that animals may be easily loaded into the chamber. Gas port openings are carefully sealed with Teflon tape, while rubber o-ring gaskets are used to seal the removable end of the cylindrical chambers.\nEach chamber is mounted on a rack that sits inside a water bath. The rack is fitted so that only the lower portion of the chambers (below the gas inlets) is submerged. For stability, the back end of the chamber rests on a support so that the entire chamber sits horizontally. This ensures even contact of the entire chamber with the bath.\nPolyethylene tubing connects an oxygen tank to an anesthetic vaporizer, and then passes through a 10 L/min flow meter. The tubing splits into 25 small-diameter resistors of equal length to ensure equal flow is delivered to each of the 24 chambers and to an agent analyzer.\nVacuum lines exit each chamber at the opposite end of the gas inlet. This promotes unidirectional flow that eliminates rebreathing of exhaled carbon dioxide. The vacuum lines combine at a manifold to connect to an in-house suction line. A pop-off valve along the main vacuum line ensures atmospheric pressure conditions within each chamber.",
    "The bath is filled with enough water to fully contact the bottom of each chamber. The water is circulated through the bath and maintained at a constant 37 oC by a pump.\n2. Check the System Prior to Exposure\nCheck that the temperature of the water bath is 37 oC throughout the bath.\nFlow oxygen at a rate of 5 L/min (200 ml/min per chamber + agent analyzer). Submerge each chamber under water and look for bubbles or entry of water into the chamber, both of which are indicative of leaks. Seal any leaks before beginning the experiment.\nFor each chamber, connect a 500 ml/min flow meter in line after the chamber to make sure that flows are balanced across each of the 25 gas lines. This ensures that the input 5 L/min flows will be distributed evenly so that each chamber receives 200 ml/min flow. Any chamber not receiving the expected flow should have its inflow and outflow tubing checked for obstructions.\nCalibrate the agent analyzer to ensure a reading of 0.00% isoflurane when 100% oxygen is flowing.\n3. Implant Temperature Transponder\nOne week prior to habituation, anesthetize each mouse with 2% isoflurane.\nSterilize the dorsal neck area with betadine.\nInject a temperature transponder subcutaneously between the shoulder blades using the sterile, prepackaged injector needle.\nMonitor the injection site daily for infection and migration of the transponder.\n4. Habituate Animals to Testing Chambers\nFour days before the first assessment, place all mice into individual chambers for 2 hr with 100% oxygen flowing.\nRepeat step 4.1 daily for the four days prior to assessment to avoid the confounding effects of stress due to a new environment.\n5. Perform the Pharmacological Intervention that You Wish to Test for Effects on Anesthetic Sensitivity",
    "This intervention may be a stereotaxic injection into a specific part of the brain24, an intravenous or intraperitoneal injection25, or delivery of a drug to a specific brain area via cannula26.\nBecause these procedures themselves may change anesthetic sensitivity compared to a naïve animal, a proper control group should undergo the same procedure with vehicle injections.\nEnsure that the pharmacological intervention has an appropriately long duration of action if you are planning to do a stepwise increasing and/or decreasing determination of anesthetic sensitivity as shown in step 6 below; otherwise, skip to step 7.\n6. Assess Anesthetic Sensitivity using the Stepwise EC50 Determination for Induction and Emergence\nPlace each animal into individual chambers with 100% oxygen flowing.\nSet the isoflurane concentration to 0.4%* for 15 min. During the last 2 min of this period, assess each animal's righting reflex by gently rolling the chamber until the mouse is placed on its back. The righting reflex is considered to be intact if and only if the mouse is able to restore all of its paws to the floor of the chamber within 2 min.\n\t\n*Note that 0.4% isoflurane is a subhypnotic dose in C57BL/6J mice. If any mice lose their righting reflex at the first step, the initial dose was too large and should be reduced on subsequent days.\nRecord the state of righting reflex for each mouse and scan each mouse for temperature data. A template record is shown in Table 1.\nIncrease the isoflurane concentration by ~0.05% for 15 min and repeat step 7.2. Continue to do this until all animals have lost their righting reflex.\nOptional: repeat the same procedure for decreasing step-wise isoflurane doses until all animals have regained their righting reflex (see step 6.3).",
    "To end the experiment, turn off the isoflurane and flush the entire system with 100% oxygen for 15 min. This will help to prevent hypoxia as the mice recover before being returned to their home cages and will protect the experimenter from any anesthetic exposure.\nOptional: if the number of animals or the number of anesthetic concentrations are limited due to resource or time constraints, the curve-fit parameter estimates-particularly the Hill slope-may have underappreciated, falsely low error estimate. In such cases, it may be necessary to repeat the anesthetic sensitivity measurement described in steps 6.1-6.6 on up to two additional experimental days to fully obtain the true Hill slope's parameter and its corresponding error estimation.\n7. Assess Short-term Changes in Anesthetic Sensitivity with Time to Emergence\nPlace each animal into individual chambers with 100% oxygen flowing.\nSet the isoflurane concentration to 1.2%, which corresponds to the induction ED99 for wild-type C57BL/6J mice20. Maintain for 30-60 min depending upon the expected duration of action of the acute intervention.\nConfirm LORR in all animals by gently rolling each chamber until mice are placed on their backs.\nTurn off isoflurane and flow 100% oxygen. Measure the time until each animal regains its righting reflex. This is defined by placement of all four paws on the floor of the chamber and confirmed by the presence of three consecutive tests with an intact righting reflex.\nSubscription Required.
