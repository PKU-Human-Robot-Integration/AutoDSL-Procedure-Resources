    "NOTE: This protocol describes the preparation (Sections 1 - 3), execution (Section 4), and analysis (Section 4) of 2-D satiety assays. Then, using dopaminergic stimulation as an example, Section 5 shows how to combine thermogenetic stimulation with 2-D satiety assays to induce hypersexuality. Section 6 describes 3 ways to verify the results of 2-D satiety assays. Finally, Section 7 shows how to measure the recovery of mating drive in male flies.\n1. Fabricating 8- and 32-chamber Behavioral Arenas\nNOTE: Each behavioral arena consists of several layers of laser-cut plastic sheets held together by hex screws and thumb nuts at each of the four corners (Figure 1A).\nFabricate the layers of the arena. Fabricate each layer using a laser cutter to cut sheets of acrylic plastic to the appropriate shape (see Figure 1B, 1C for products).\n\tNOTE: Many research institutions have laser cutters in their machine shops or maker spaces. If the institution has access to a laser cutter, continue with the following steps. If not, then follow the instructions in Step 1.2 instead.\n\t\nFor each layer, open the design pattern in the laser cutter's software.\n\t\tNOTE: The designs can be found in appropriately named PDF files (e.g., 8-Chamber Arena - Layer 2 - Doors.pdf) in Supplemental Material 1. This file also contains annotations for the type of plastic to be used (e.g., 1/8 inch (i.e. 3.175 mm) clear acrylic). The exact thickness of each layer is not critical. The main requirement is to allow 0.12 inches (3 mm) or more of free vertical space in the chambers.\nAdjust the laser settings (power, focus, etc.) for the type and thickness of plastic to be used. Place plastic in the laser cutter bed and run the laser cutter.",
    "NOTE: These settings will vary widely based on the laser cutter model and the strength of its laser. Find appropriate settings based on past experience or by making test cuts on scrap plastic. The deep hexagonal engravings are included in the design to recess the hex screw heads. This feature allows for one-handed tightening of the thumb nuts and allows the arenas to rest flat on the bench (without protruding screw heads). Nevertheless, making deep engravings is often hard to achieve, and time-consuming, using a laser cutter. This step is optional and can be skipped without affecting the behavioral results.\nWhen cutting the door frame (Layer 2, Figure 1A), also use appropriate laser settings for engraving the chamber numbers included in the design (as in Figure 1B, 1C).\nPlace an order with an online laser cutting fabricator. Upload all the PDF design files for the 8- and/or 32-chamber arena and specify the material type (e.g., 1/8 inch (i.e. 3.175 mm) clear acrylic) based on the annotations in the files. The results will appear as in Figures 1B (8-chamber arena) and 1C (32-chamber arena).\nAssemble arenas using four hex screws and four thumb nuts to align and hold together the plastic layers (Figure 1A). The arenas will appear as in Figure 1D, 1E (8-chamber) and Figure 1F, 1G (32-chamber).\n\tNOTE: The food wall (Layer 4 in Figure 1A) is used for 2-D satiety assays only and is omitted in 32-chamber arenas, which are used in courtship assays.\n2. Food Preparation for 2-D Satiety Assay\nNOTE: Because a 2-D satiety assay spans 4.5 h, fly food is used in the arena to provide nutrition and water. This protocol uses, but is not restricted to, the conventional cornmeal-agar fly food.",
    "Partially assemble the 2-D satiety arena (8-chamber) with Layers 3 - 6 (see Figure 1A for layer assignments) and tighten it with thumb nuts and hex screws.\nPlace fresh fly food into a clean, microwave-safe bottle. Add just enough water to cover the bottom surface of the bottle (Figure 2A).\nMicrowave food on high for 30 - 45 s. Check progress and stir every 15 s until melted (Figure 2B). CAUTION! Fly food easily boils over.\nUse a blunted 1,000-µL pipette tip (Figure 2C) to slowly transfer ~1 mL melted food into each chamber (Figure 2D).\nAllow food to resolidify at 4 °C for ~10 min (Figure 2E) before completely assembling the arena (Figure 2F).\nUse the completed arena for experiments (see Section 4) or store at 4 °C.\nStore the leftover food at 4 °C and reuse.\n3. Preparing Virgin Females for Behavioral Assays\nNOTE: 2-D satiety assays use large numbers of virgin female flies (~120 - 160 for a full behavioral arena) that are difficult to collect using standard methods. This section describes an alternative approach using the hs-hid transgene on the Y chromosome28, which has been used successfully in courtship assays25,29. The stock used to generate white-eyed virgin females has the genotype w1118(X)/hs-hid(Y);+/+;+/+ (Bloomington stock number 24638).\nFlip flies into a new bottle once 20 - 50% of the pupae have eclosed (see Figure 3A for example) and there are enough males (5 - 10) to propagate the stock.\nHeat shock the original bottle in a 37 °C hot water bath for 1 h to sufficiently activate hs-hid to kill males (Figure 3B). After the heat shock, only females will eclose from these bottles and so will remain virgin until the assays.",
    "NOTE: Make sure all sides of the bottle are evenly heated (see Figure 3A for water line). Extend this time for up to 2 h if 1 h is not sufficient to euthanize all males.\nIsolate collected females for at least 3 d before experiments to ensure that they are old enough to be sexually receptive25,29.\n\tNOTE: Y-chromosome-less males occasionally arise from this stock. These males have white eyes and are unaffected by the heat shock because they do not contain the hs-hid transgene. They cannot produce sperm and therefore cannot decrease receptivity in females30,31.\n4. Performing and Scoring 2-D Satiety Assays\nNOTE: It is important to control the age of the male flies as mating drive changes with age. This protocol uses males that are 3 - 4 d old25.\nSet the incubator to the desired temperature (e.g., 23 °C for standard, RT experiments) and humidity (>30%). For incubators without humidity control, leaving a cup of water in the incubator is sufficient.\nPlace a 2-D satiety assay arena in the incubator for ~30 min to equilibrate the temperature and to prevent condensation in the chambers during the course of the experiment. The rotating doors should be in the open position.\nUse a fly aspirator32 to aspirate 15 - 20 virgin females into each chamber of the arena (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: It is important that the females and males are not anesthetized on the same day as the assay. In our experience, doing so may impact female receptivity and male mating behavior.\nAspirate 1 male into each chamber.\nPlace the loaded arena in the incubator under a standard consumer camcorder (Figure 5) and film for 4.5 h.",
    "Score videos by noting when each male fly starts and ends each mating (i.e. copulation). This step may be time-consuming at first. With practice, one can score the videos at 5x speed or higher.\n\tNOTE: Since flies mate for ~20 min at ~23 °C (shorter duration at higher temperatures)29, one can skim through the first 15 min of each mating.\nAfter logging all mating times, sum the number of matings for each fly (see representative Results).\nUse the provided code to generate an ethogram. See Supplemental Material 2 for the code, instructions, and example data.\nUse CO2 or cold temperature to anesthetize the flies before removing them.\n5. Using Thermogenetic Manipulation to Reverse Satiety in 2-D Satiety Assays\nNOTE: This protocol tests whether thermogenetic stimulation of a defined neuronal population can overcome satiety. The experimental flies express the heat-sensitive cation channel TrpA1 in defined populations of neurons (UAS-TrpA1). The steps below apply to the stimulation of dopaminergic neurons (TH-Gal4), which have been shown to promote mating drive25. These steps can be used in conjunction with other neuronal drivers to discover other populations that promote mating drive.\nTo thermogenetically induce mating behaviors in satiated flies, increase the temperature in the incubator (e.g., from 23 °C to 28.5 °C) after completing a full 4.5 h 2-D satiety experiment.\nAfter the incubator reaches the desired temperature, continue heat stimulation and score the matings (i.e. copulations) of the males for 1 h (see Representative Results).\n\tNOTE: The temperature and length of stimulation may vary depending on the genotype so it is necessary to troubleshoot the optimal conditions that prevent overstimulation of neurons while still producing a robust phenotype.\n6. Using Courtship and Locomotion to Verify Satiety",
    "NOTE: This section describes 3 optional methods that can be used to verify the results of 2-D satiety assays. They are not required for every assay.\nUse courtship assays to verify satiety.\n\t\nAspirate one male and one virgin female into each of the 32 chambers in a courtship arena.\nFilm the flies for ~20 min using a standard consumer camcorder.\nScore the courtship index (CI) to quantify courtship25; this is the fraction of time spent performing courtship behavior (singing, following, etc.) and mating (i.e. copulation) over a 5 min window. This window starts from the first instance of courtship behavior. If a male fly does not start courtship in the first 15 min, its CI is 0. Naïve WT flies should show a CI greater than 0.9, whereas a fully satiated fly should have a CI below 0.2. Other courtship measures may also be considered23,33.\nScoring courtship in 2-D satiety assays\n\t\nScore the amount of time that a male fly spends courting, over a time period of a 2-D satiety assay (e.g., the first h). Courtship is defined as the male performing any step of the ritual (singing, following, etc.). Unlike in Section 6.1.3, this step does not include time the male spends mating.\nDivide the courtship time above by the total time the male was not mating (i.e. not copulating) in the same time period. For example, if a male fly courts for 15 min and mates for 20 min over the first h, the ratio is 15 min / (60 min - 20 min) = 0.375. The ratio is shown as \"Fraction of nonmating time in courtship\" in Representative Results.\nUsing locomotion assay to evaluate exhaustion\n\t\nPartially assemble the 32-chamber arena with all parts but the contrast sheet.",
    "Aspirate one male fly (no female flies) into each of the 32 chambers in a courtship arena.\nFilm the flies for ~10 min using a standard consumer camcorder.\nTrack the flies with the MTrack2 plugin in ImageJ (http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~nstuurman/ijplugins/MTrack2.html).\n7. Recovering Mating Drive after 2-D Satiety Assay\nPerform a 2-D satiety assay as described in Section 4, but aspirate the male flies out at the end of the assay.\nIsolate the male flies at 23 °C for the desired number of days.\nPerform a 2-D satiety assay with the recovered males and score their matings (i.e. copulations) for just 1 h(see Representative Results).\nSubscription Required.
