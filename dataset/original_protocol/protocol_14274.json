    "All methods described here have been approved by ethics committee of Beijing Hospital. Indications for surgery are according to the European Association of Urology guidelines for nonneurogenic male LUTS. Contraindications include suspected prostate cancer or detrusor dysfunction.\n1. Instruments for Operation\nEnsure the availability of a LBO crystal laser with a maximum power of 160 W.\nEmploy an endfiring laser fiber and saline solution for intraoperative bladder irrigating.\nUse a 26F laser resectoscope to acquire good vision and to enhance the resection efficiency.\n2. Preparation for Operation\nProvide an intravenous antibiotic preoperatively (intravenous administration of cefuroxime sodium 1.5 g with 100 mL 0.9%sodium chloride solution 30 min before the operation) to all the patients.\nBefore the anesthesia, make the patient lay down on the operation table.\nNote: General anesthesia is effective and appropriate for this operation, Anesthetist will finally determine the mode of anesthesia depending on patient's general condition.\nDrape the patients in a sterile fashion in the dorsa lithotomy position.Do not perform any skin preparation.\n3. Procedure Steps\nVaporesection of the Median Lobe\nExamine the whole bladder cavity and prostatic urethra carefully through the resectoscope after the bladder is distended.\nNote: This step helps urologist to locate some key anatomic sings including bilateral ureteral orifice and verumontanum.\nMark two lines initially. Ensure that these lines originate at 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock at the bladder neck and continue along the boundaries between the median and lateral lobes, finally terminating at the proximal margin of the verumontanum.\nSet laser power at 80 W. Vaporize the prostate tissue via a fiber by the laser vaporization along these lines until the white cyclic fibers are seen.\nNote: This is the sign of prostatic capsule. The two lines are merged into single line adjacent to the verumontanum.",
    "Set laser power at 80 to 100 W. Mark several lines on surface of the middle lobe via laser fiber. Then divide the wedgeshaped middle lobe into several chunks according to these lines through vaporization technique. Then split each chunk from the middle lobe. Finally, remove the whole middle lobe.\nVaporesection of the Lateral Lobes\nVaporize the tissue at 12 o'clock from the apex of the prostate to the bladder neck by rotating the cystoscope 180Â°. Do not let the laser fiber go too close to the apex at 12 o'clock which can cause postoperative urine incontinence.\nNote: This technique enhances the resection rate of the tissue around the prostate roof.\nIdentify the lower margin of both the lateral lobes clearly once vaporesection is complete.\nBefore removing the lateral lobes, set another 2 similar grooves that originate from the bladder neck at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock to the proximal end of the verumontanum.\nRemove the tissue of the lateral gland. Set the laser power at 80 to 100 W and mark several lines on the surface of the left lobe via laser fiber that divides the left lobe into several chunks according to these lines through vaporization technique. Then split each chunk from the lobe and finally remove the whole left lobe. Repeat this procedure to remove right lobe.\nRemove the remnant gland tissue along the existing boundary of the capsule.\nChannel Trimming\nRemember to trim some protruding tissues around the apex of the gland, to enhance the integrity of the cavity.\nTo avoid intraoperative complications (i.e., capsule perforation or sphincter injury), use vaporization technique rather than resection to trim the tissue near the external urethral sphincter and lower the power to less than 80 Watt.\nHemostasis and Catheterization",
    "Employ a glass syringe that matches the interface of the resectoscope to remove tissue chunk by water flow. Make sure there is no evidence of the residual tissue in the bladder and prostatic fossa through resectoscope, and identify the intact of the ureteral orifices.\nEmploy a lower laser power (30 to 50 W) to stop bleeding around the surgical site. Keep an appropriate distance usually 3 to 5 mm between fiber and vessels to acquire a satisfying hemostasis effect.\nRemove the resectoscope from the urethra. Place a 22 French Foley catheter from urethral orifice to bladder cavity gently with 30 mL water in the balloon after sufficiently lubricating urethra by lidocaine gel.\nPostoperative Care\nLet the patient lay down on the bed for around 3 h postoperatively in the care unit until they completely wake up from anesthesia. Meanwhile, make sure patient monitors and medical oxygen are available during this time.\nUpon completely waking up, return the patient to the ward. Let the patient begin to drink some water and take some food. Record the urine output and pay attention to the color of the urine.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
