    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEmbryo collection and mounting\nTiming: Embryo collection, ∼90 min; mounting, ∼10 min\nThis section describes how embryos are collected and mounted for live-cell microscopy.\nOn the morning of the experiment, change the fly cage plate to a fresh apple juice agar plate containing yeast paste and wait 1 h, to give the flies time to lay retained embryos. After 1 h change the plate again. If the gene of interest is expressed during nuclear cycle (nc) 14, collect embryos for 90 mins (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 2).\nEmbryos are washed off the plate with NaCl (0.7%)/TritonX-100 (0.05%; Sigma, Cat# X100) wash solution and dechorionated by adding freshly prepared 50% bleach (Banner, Cat# 1190012) to the plate for 2 min. Next, decant embryos into a sieve and wash them with water until they are free of bleach (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 3). Dry the sieve with paper towels and remove as much water as possible from the embryos.\nUse a blade or tweezers to cut a square from a fresh apple juice plate, turn the plate over, and place the square on top of the plate so it is elevated. Move the plate under a dissection microscope. Transfer embryos onto the agar square using a brush (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 4).\nLine up the embryos and orient them so that the area in which the gene of interest will be expressed is facing upwards (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: Position the embryos in one or two lines to make navigation under the microscope easier.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Mounting Drosophila embryos for live imaging experiments, related to step 4\nMounting approximately 20 embryos will ensure that multiple embryos are at the correct developmental stage for imaging.",
    "Note: Try to exclude embryos that have already entered late nuclear cycles or are gastrulating. These embryos appear to have a transparent periphery and a more dense and structured center (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNext, prepare a cover slip/halocarbon oil bridge on a Lumox imaging dish (Sarstedt AG & Co, Cat# 94.6077.305) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 4).\nUse a cut pipette tip to add 70 μL of halocarbon oil (7:1, halocarbon oil 700:halocarbon oil 27; Sigma Cat# H8898 and Cat# H8773) onto the middle of the imaging dish.\nOn each side of the drop of oil place a coverslip (no. 0, 18 × 18 mm; Scientific Laboratory Supplies, Cat# MIC3100) and create a bridge (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 4). The two coverslips should be approximately 0.6 cm apart.\nNo. 0 cover slips used in this setup have a thickness of approximately 100 μm (Scientific Laboratory Supplies), whereas a Drosophila embryo has an approximate height of 180 μm (Markow et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]). Therefore, the embryo becomes flattened against the coverslip.\nNote: Prepare one Lumox imaging dish per experiment. The dishes have a gas-permeable membrane and can be reused a few times before the membrane becomes too flexible (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nFix embryos in place with a heptane glue coated coverslip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 4).\nCarefully pick up the heptane glue coated coverslip and gently drop it onto the embryos with the heptane glue side facing down toward the embryos.\nUse tweezers to (very carefully) press the coverslip onto the embryos. You will notice that the embryos flatten slightly and press against the coverslip.",
    "Pick up the coverslip with the embryos attached to it and place it onto the coverslip-bridge, sandwiching the embryos between the dish membrane and the coverslip in the drop of oil. Secure the top coverslip in place with a dot of nail polish.\nCritical: If the embryos are not attached properly to the heptane glue coated coverslip, they might start sliding during the live imaging time lapse. If embryos are flattened too much by the heptane glue coated coverslip, they may arrest during a mitotic cleavage cycle or display mitotic defects (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nLive-cell microscopy of nascent transcription\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section, the microscopy setup and settings are outlined to visualize nascent transcription. The prepared sample can be imaged on an upright or inverted microscope setup. Here, embryos were imaged on an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 5).\nFor imaging experiments, we use a Leica TCS SP8 AOBS inverted confocal microscope with a resonant scan head and a 40×/ 1.3 HC PL apochromatic oil objective with the pinhole set to 1.3 airy units.\nThe microscope settings used to image the sample dataset were as follows:\nThe scanning frequency of the resonance head was 8,000 Hz (with a minimum zoom of 1.25).\nScanning was set to bidirectional.\nImages were acquired at 8 bit and with 1,024 pixels per line and 700 lines. These settings result in a pixel size of 378.79 nm × 378.79 nm, an image size of 387.5 μm × 264.77 μm and a pixel dwell time of 1.04 μs. This setup allows us to capture most of the Drosophila embryo.\nImages were collected using hybrid detectors and fluorophores were excited with a white laser. The example dataset was acquired using the following settings:",
    "White laser set to 70% with 488 nm (8%), 561 nm (2%) and 8× line averaging. These settings result in the following background corrected laser powers: 6.34 μW (488 nm) and 2.88 μW (561 nm). Ensure minimal photobleaching (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]) and that the signal is not saturated.\nZ-stacks were acquired continuously with 1 μm steps. A depth of 55 μm per z-stack can be achieved with a final temporal resolution of 20 s per time frame.\nIf the gene of interest is not highly expressed, the z-step size can be reduced to ensure that the transcription site is imaged in multiple z slices.\nFind embryos on the imaging dish using brightfield illumination and rotate to align the embryos horizontally with their AP axis.\nCheck the age of embryos by looking at the nuclei using fluorescence illumination in the 561 nm excitation line. Pick an embryo where the nuclei have migrated to the surface and are currently undergoing nc13 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 5).\nSet up a time lapse and include the full depth of nuclei in the z-direction. A maximum projected movie of the example time-lapse experiment can be found in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] (previously described in Hoppe et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nIt is advisable to set up the z-stack to include a number of slices below the nuclear volume at the start of imaging. This extra depth ensures that the nascent transcription sites are fully included within the imaging volume while nuclei elongate during nc14 (see example datasets).\nOptional: Deconvolve the time-lapse data using the inbuilt Leica lightning deconvolution software. As an alternative, the Huygens Professional Deconvolution software can be used to deconvolve images but struggles with large file sizes.",
    "Critical: When imaging make sure that the full fluorescence of the transcription sites is included in the z-stack (not cut off on the top or bottom). If the expression domain of the gene of interest is very wide, imaging is potentially complicated by the degree of embryo flattening. In our experience, an active transcription site is visible in approximately 6–8 z slices at its maximum transcriptional activity.\nNote: Depending on the expression level, the fluorescence might be very weak and the imaging/genomic setup will need to be optimized (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: If a different microscope is used the most important setting to consider is the imaging speed. As transcription is a very dynamic progress, care should be taken to accommodate a high frame rate. The time resolution of 20 s, as described in this protocol, can be improved further by imaging a smaller region of the embryo or smaller z-stacks. Achieving a high time resolution is often associated with a tradeoff in the image quality. Low raw image quality can complicate image analysis and potentially mask real signal under the background haze. Therefore, we recommend to use a microscope with a resonant scanner, a Piezo stage fixture, a Piezo objective collar, or alternative options to ensure high speed imaging.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Maximum intensity projection of time-lapse experiment showing transcription of the endogenous ush gene using the MS2/MCP system, related to step 10\nTime-lapse video was taken on an inverted SP8 confocal microscope (40× objective, depth of 55 μm and a final temporal resolution of 20 s per time frame).\nTracking of nuclei and identification of transcription sites\nTiming: ∼ 4.5 h/time-lapse dataset",
    "This next section describes the initial semi-automated data analysis pipeline to extract the fluorescent signal from each nucleus and track the signal over time (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], step 6). This pipeline combines data analysis performed using Imaris software 9.2 (Bitplane, Oxford Instruments, Concord MA, RRID:SCR_007370) with open-access, custom python scripts. A sample time-lapse dataset (Embryo1_full_analysis.ims) with full nuclear traces and the corresponding analysis files is provided with this protocol. Additionally, a beginners dataset containing a small number of nuclei, time points and the corresponding analysis files is provided.\nFiles are deposited at Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/jv9fjpn9cg.1\nNote: This analysis pipeline was conceptualized to be easily applicable to time-lapse datasets acquired using different microscopes, magnifications and of different embryo regions. In addition, this pipeline does not require coding knowledge or familiarity with MATLAB/python or other programming languages. A similar Imaris based pipeline has been developed independently by Yamada et al (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib40].\nCritical: The time it takes to analyze an embryo dataset varies significantly with the quality of raw data, the size of the field of view and the number of time frames. The example dataset includes a cropped field of view containing approximately. 116 nuclei. The beginners dataset provides approximately 20 nuclei for quicker analysis using this pipeline.\nAlternatives: Other custom software is available to track nuclei and quantitate nascent transcription. Custom MATLAB scripts have been generated by Garcia et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] and further optimized by Lammers et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]. MitoTrack is an open-access software that can track nuclei and extract MCP fluorescence from maximum projected images, while keeping a lineage tree history through cell divisions (Trullo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]).\nNote: We outline the rationale of each analysis step to enable users of other analysis platforms to incorporate some aspects of this pipeline.",
    "Load time-lapse microscopy data into Imaris 9.2 to render images in 3D (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], steps 1–3).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/518-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Semi-automated analysis pipeline\nThe developing Drosophila embryo is imaged over time using z-slices to cover the full depth of the nucleus and capture the full fluorescence (1). Images can be analyzed in the Imaris software (2), which allows the images to be rendered in 3D (3). The time-lapse dataset is cropped to a region of interest for further analysis. Nuclei are segmented using the “surfaces” module, the His-RFP channel and either “absolute intensity” or “background subtraction” thresholding (4), before they are tracked through time using an autoregressive motion algorithm (5). Transcription sites are segmented using the “spots” function and the MCP-GFP channel (6).\nNote: Imaris supports all common microscopy file formats.\nNuclear segmentation: As a first step, nuclei are segmented by creating a surface over objects detected in the His-RFP channel. In order to ease segmentation, the detectable objects are smoothed using a Gaussian filter (“smooth surface detail” setting).\nIdentify and segment nuclei based on the His-RFP fluorescence channel and using the inbuilt Imaris “surfaces” function. Follow the algorithm steps as they are displayed in the software.\nSelect “track surfaces over time” in algorithm settings and either analyze the entire image or select a region of interest.\nIn the next step, select the His-RFP channel as the source channel and set “smooth surface detail” to 1 μm.\nDifferent thresholding options can work well to segment nuclei.\nAbsolute intensity thresholding option: When choosing “absolute intensity” select “split touching objects” to prevent the fusion of multiple nuclei. Defining the seed point diameter as 3 μm is a good starting point (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 4).",
    "Background subtraction thresholding option: When choosing the “background subtraction” thresholding method, choose 1.3 μm as a start value for “diameter of largest sphere which fits into object.” In the next step, move the slider until nuclei are sufficiently identified and shaded (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 4). In our experience, it is easiest to make sure that the shaded spheres do not touch each other, instead of using the seed point option, to prevent any fusion to form one nucleus in subsequent steps.\nNote: Nuclei in the example dataset were segmented using the “background subtraction” thresholding. Examples of both thresholding methods for one time point are included in the example dataset and were used to generate the images in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 4.\nIn the next window, choose classifiers to separate nuclei by selecting as many filters as needed to obtain the best segmentation result. Filters can help to remove false-positive results from the segmentation. We find the following filters especially helpful: Number of voxels, Position Z, Distance to image border XY, Quality and Area.\nCritical: Achieving a good segmentation result is important to prevent false-positive/-negative results during later analysis steps.\nNuclear tracking: Imaris offers a number of different tracking algorithms that predict the surface (nuclear) object positions in the next frame. Based on the predicted positions the best matches are selected using a linear assignment algorithm to form track connections. The autoregressive motion tracking option considers the previous time point and predicts the same amount of object movement in the next time frame. The user can determine the distance an object is allowed to deviate from the predicted path (“maximum travel distance” input). More detailed information can be found in the Imaris handbook.",
    "Nuclei are tracked through time in 3D using the inbuilt autoregressive motion algorithm. The maximum frame gap size is set to 5 and the maximum travel distance is set to 5 μm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 5).\nAfter tracking is complete, tracks and nuclei can be corrected manually in the “edit” and “edit tracks” tabs.\nAlternatives: Segmentation accuracy may vary based on raw data quality. Sometimes it can be difficult to find segmentation settings that will work on the whole time-lapse dataset. This is especially apparent if nuclei change shape or photobleaching has occurred. In this case, it can be easier to disable “track surfaces over time” in the surface wizard and segment nuclei in smaller time frame groups. Segment 10–50 time frames at a time by selecting them in the “region of interest” window. Follow the segmentation wizard to the end. Then, merge nuclei groups by selecting “merge” in the surfaces editing tab. After merging all nuclei, select “tracking” in the “rebuild” tab to track nuclei through time. Using this approach, nuclei segmentation can be manually adjusted and corrected before tracking. Nuclei in the example dataset were segmented in sets of 40 time frames, then merged and tracked.\nTranscription site identification: To determine the transcription activity, we quantify the full (sum) fluorescence of nascent transcription sites in 3D. This is achieved by placing spheres around the transcription sites that encapsulate the full fluorescence, which can then be measured.\nActive transcription sites are identified in the MCP-GFP channel, using the inbuilt Imaris \"spots\" function. Follow the steps of the creation wizard.\nAnalyze the full image or choose a region of interest. Select the MCP-GFP channel as “source channel” to identify nascent transcription foci.\nIn the next window, specify the spot/sphere size.",
    "Transcription foci can be estimated to be 1.8 μm in XY diameter.\nThe “model PSF-elongation along z-axis” will differ based on the microscope that was used and needs to be determined based on the dataset to be analyzed.\nIn the next step, three-dimensional spheres, of identical size, are placed around the transcription signal by the software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 6). It is important that the full fluorescence is contained within the sphere.\nWhen analyzing a new genotype, check that the full fluorescence is contained within the sphere at time points where the fluorescent signal is brightest.\nIf this is not the case, return to the previous step in the creation wizard and adjust the sphere size.\nNext, filters are used to classify spots. Select as many filters as needed to remove false-positive spots and identify as many “real” fluorescence spots as possible. We find the following filters especially helpful: Quality, Sum Intensity of MCP-GFP channel, Position Z, and Distance to image border XY.\nFalse-positive spots are most often detected outside the z-plane of transcription sites with a lower sum fluorescence than the average transcription site.\nBefore continuing, check the spots that were created by the software by navigating through the time frames. When the fluorescent signal is very dim, transcription sites are sometimes not detected (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]) or false-positive spots are added (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).",
    "Note: To change the size of all spot objects at the same time, a python based Imaris X-Tension “XTSpotResizer” is available. This X-Tension, written by Egor Zindy, can be downloaded at https://github.com/zindy/Imaris[href=https://github.com/zindy/Imaris] and integrated into Imaris under Edit -> Preferences -> Custom Tools. Locate the folder containing the downloaded “SpotResizeDialog.py,” “XTSpotReziser.py,” “TkDialog.py,” and “BridgeLib.py” in the X-Tension folder field and add it to the custom tools. The X-tension will appear in the Image Processing menu.\nNote: In the example dataset, transcription sites were excluded from nuclei sitting on the edge of the field of view as the onset of transcription could have been missed or the nascent transcription sites are not fully present in the field of view.\nBackground correction: The inherent background fluorescence, originating from unbound MCP-GFP, is removed using the sass.py script. A linear regression line is fitted based on background fluorescence values determined in this step. The line equation will then be used to determine the average background fluorescence present at each time point and subtracted from the transcription site fluorescence measurements.\nManually add a second set of spots, of the same size as spots used to identify transcription foci, to generate background readings.\nIdentify the first time frame that contains an MS2 signal. Add “new spots” using the Imaris wizard. On the first wizard tab, select “skip automatic creation, edit manually.” Manually add 4 spots (pointer in the “select” mode, press shift and left click) in the nuclear layer but outside of the expression domain or away from nuclei with active transcription. Make sure the background spots have the same size as spots used to identify transcription foci.",
    "Add 4 background spots in every third-fifth time frame until the end of the time-lapse movie. We find these time intervals to be sufficient to create an accurate linear regression line.\nExport data files:\nUnder File -> Preferences -> Statistics -> Surfaces make sure that at a minimum “Position X/Y/Z,” “Ellipsoid Axis CX/CY/CZ” and “Ellipsoid Axis length C” are selected.\nThe “Position” output file will record all nuclear centroid X/Y/Z positions, nuclear ID and TrackID for every time frame. The Ellipsoid Axis C X/Y/Z positions and length determines the orientation of the ellipsoid nuclear axis in the C direction (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/518-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Spot assignment and mitotic wave correction\n(A) Each nascent transcription site is assigned to the closest nucleus in three dimensions using the proximity to the nuclear ellipsoid axis C (blue). Use of the ellipsoid axis C instead of a perpendicular axis (white line) results in a more accurate spot assignment in curved regions of the embryo.\n(B) Time differences arising from the mitotic wave are corrected during the analysis. The expression domain is separated into mitotic zones that contain nuclei that undergo telophase in the same frame. The x-axis positions of the zone borders are recorded together with the number of time frames that need to be adjusted in order to reset t = 0.\nUnder File -> Preferences -> Statistics -> Spots make sure that at least “Intensity Sum” and “Position X/Y/Z” are selected. Add other desired fluorescent measurements.\nSelect the surface icon that contains the tracked nuclei. Select the “statistics” tab and “detailed.” Export “all statistics to file.” Make sure the filename contains the word “cells” (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 1). This generates a folder containing an excel sheet for each statistic.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/518-Fig6.jpg",
    "Figure 6. Combining the Imaris output files of nuclei and spots using a custom python script\nThe statistic files of spots and surfaces are exported from the Imaris software (1) and saved in a subfolder. Using the custom python script “sass,” each detected transcription site is assigned to the closest nucleus (2). “Sass” outputs multiple images to investigate the analysis accuracy including plots of the expression domain (3) and the percent of nuclei that were wrongly assigned 2 or 3 spots (4). All the data are outputted in a large data file (5).\nSelect the spots icon that contains the identified transcription sites. Select the “statistics” tab and select “detailed.” Export “all statistics to file.” Make sure the filename contains the word “spots.”\nSelect the spots icon that contains generated background spots. In the “statistics” tab select “detailed.” Export “all statistics to file.” Make sure the filename contains the word “background.”\nCritical: A specific folder structure is needed to run the custom python script: parent folder -> subfolder containing Imaris statistics. The example dataset contains the following structure: Analysis -> Embryo 1 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 2).",
    "Optional: Drosophila embryos undergo rapid mitotic divisions during early development. After nuclei have migrated to the embryo periphery, mitotic divisions occur in a wave (Foe, 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Foe and Alberts, 1983[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). The time differences in transcriptional onset that result from the mitotic wave can be corrected using the following pipeline. The temporal profile of cells is synchronized using the file “key_time.txt” contained within the sample analysis file. In this file, manually note the x-axis positions (Imaris slice view, increasing numbers from left to right) of boundaries that contain a group of similarly timed nuclei (columns 1 and 2) and in column 3 note down the time frame in which nuclei undergo telophase. During subsequent data analysis, time frames are adjusted by the calculated time correction using the telophase frame number within mitotic zones (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nAssigning transcription sites to nuclei\nTiming: ∼10 min/time-lapse dataset\nAssign transcription sites to nuclei: The custom python script uses the Ellipsoid axis to assign spots to nuclei instead of the centroid position. This helps to assign each transcription site to the correct nucleus while accounting for the embryo curvature (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A for illustration).\nDownload the custom python package “sass” (Simple Assignment of Spots to Surfaces), which links the identified transcription foci to their respective nuclei. The package containing all scripts can be downloaded here: https://github.com/TMinchington/sass[href=https://github.com/TMinchington/sass]\nMake sure that python 3 (or Anaconda3) is installed on the computer.\nUsing the Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the folder that contains the sass.py file (alternatively, drag and drop the sass.py file into the command prompt).\nType: python sass.py [drag and drop the parent folder containing the subfolder with the exported Imaris statistics] and run the analysis (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 2).",
    "If the optional step of mitosis correction was skipped, sass.py will show this message before finishing “No key time file detected. Would you like to stop and create this file now? (y/n).” Answer with “n” in the command line.\nThe output folder is generated in the subfolder containing the Imaris statistics. The folder “time data” contains the finished analysis files.\nThe image mid_line_expression.png shows a summary image of nuclei with active transcription (green), nuclei without transcription (blue) and the midline of the expression domain (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 3).\nNote: Nuclei in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 3 are identified as inactive (blue) because either no transcription sites were identified in step 13 or because the nucleus was excluded as it is not present in the field of view during the full transcription period (see the Note below).\nThe image assignments.png file shows the percentage of nuclei that were assigned 1 spot (blue line), 2 spots (orange line) or 3 spots (green line) for each time frame (X-axis) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 4). This graph can be used as a visual aid to assess the segmentation success. Optimally, nuclei should only have been assigned 1 spot (see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nThe file “mid_line.txt” contains the coordinates for the expression domain midline.",
    "The file “backed_down-hc.txt” contains the tracked nuclei and transcription spots (identify by nuclear ID in the column “nuc” and spot ID in the column “spot”) and their 3D positions (columns “nucx/y/z” and “spotsx/y/z”). The nuclear X/Y/Z positions can be used to determine the nuclear position along the embryo’s AP and DV axis. The fluorescence value, background corrected value and the fluorescence intensity can be found in the columns “value,” “corrected_val” and “variable” respectively. Make sure to filter for the MCP-GFP channel in the column “channel” for further analysis. The distance to the midline can be found in the column “dis_mid” and is computed in μm. Imaging time can be found in the column “time” and is calculated in min (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 5). If the optional step of mitosis adjustment was included, the adjusted time can be found in column “time_shift” (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 5).\nUsing the nuclear ID, full traces of transcriptional activity can be plotted or used for further analysis. If multiple spots are assigned to a single nucleus see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nNote: The default microscopy time interval setting is 20 s in the python package. This can be overwritten by running the scripts with the following modification: python sass.py --i [time interval in sec] [folder path to analyse]. A time interval of 60 s will result in full integers, as the time interval is displayed in min. For example: python sass.py --i 60 “D:\\Carol\\Methods paper\\Analysis.”\nNote: For downstream analysis, we recommend using “Intensity Sum” fluorescence values as these contain the full fluorescence detected in 3D.",
    "Note: The file “backed_down-hc.txt” only contains a subset of nuclei. Contained in this list are nuclei that were present in the first and last time frame during gene transcription. Nuclei that entered or exited the field of view are excluded. Full data can be found in the “backed_down.txt” file.\nCritical: The quality of the analyzed data should be inspected before continuing with downstream analysis. The assignments.png file in the analysis folder can be used as an indicator for successful nuclear tracking and spot identification (less than 5% of nuclear traces have more than 1 spot assigned). If this value is found to be above 5% this could be due to false-positive spots or gaps in nuclear tracks (see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]). We also recommend plotting the mean fluorescence intensity and transcription onset time of all analyzed nuclei as well as a few individual nuclear traces to visualize obvious problems with the dataset (in comparison with other biological replicates) before progressing with downstream analysis."
