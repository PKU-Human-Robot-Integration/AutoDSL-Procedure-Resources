We use the pTAHR TH-p2a-TD:Tomato targeting vector in which the stop codon is removed to fuse the Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) gene to an in-frame P2A-TdTomato sequence (Ahfeldt et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We generated CRISPR/Cas9 constructs by cloning CRISPR guide sequences into the previously published PX330 Cas9 plasmid (Ahfeldt et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Cong et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). For removal of the selection cassette, we use the pCAG-Cre:GFP plasmid (Matsuda and Cepko, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and flow sort GFP+ cells via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to grow colonies. The TH-TdTomato reporter allows for monitoring and FACS of midbrain DNs throughout the differentiation and can be used for downstream applications such as plating the neurons on astrocytes or omics studies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/610-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Generation and confirmation of TH-TdTomato knock-in hPSC lines (optional step)\n(A) Schematic overview of the CRISPR-mediated gene targeting approach.\n(B) Bright-field image of a WA01 colony after targeting. Scale bar: 500 μm.\n(C) 5′, 3′, and 5′3′ PCRs confirming TH-TdTomato vector integration into selected WA01 and BJ-SiPS hPSC clones.\n(D) Sequencing results validating correct vector integration for two clones using the “TH-TdTomato Forward” primer for the 5′ PCR product.\nNote: The TH-TdTomato hPSCs have weak TdTomato fluorescence only for a few days after targeting, but in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A we show these cells in red throughout the timeline to represent the cells containing the knock-in vector.\nCoat the desired number of 10-cm dishes with 8 mL Geltrex solution and store in a CO2 incubator at 37°C for at least 1 h (see Geltrex solution[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.1]).",
    "Coat one additional dish for nucleofection control to ensure that the nucleofection reaction has worked properly on the following day.\nAspirate StemFlex medium from 70%–80% confluent hPSCs in a 10-cm dish and wash with 8 mL PBS to remove debris.\nAspirate PBS and incubate cells with 3 mL fresh Accutase at 20°C–25°C for 5 min with occasional manual shaking. Incubation time may vary slightly between different cell lines.\nNote: Accutase is a gentle cell detachment solution and therefore does not need to be neutralized during passaging. However, we reduce its activity during the centrifugation step by diluting it in at least twice the volume of wash buffer.\nIn the meantime, prepare 10 mL wash buffer in a 15-mL conical tube (see hPSC wash buffer[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.2]).\nGently pipet the cells on the dish 3–5 times using a 5-mL pipet and add to the 15-mL tube.\nMix the cells 3–5 times in the 15-mL tube and take a small amount for cell count.\nNote: During regular TC procedures such as hPSC passaging, we dissociate the cells in small clumps since hPSCs have reduced viability when suspended as single cells. However, for nucleofection we further dissociate hPSCs into single cells to ensure that we derive clonal cell populations during cell targeting. The use of Thiazovivin enhances cell survival after nucleofection.\nCount cells using Trypan Blue solution, Chamber Slides, and a Cell Counter before centrifugation and distribute appropriate volume of the mixture containing 2 million cells to a new 15-mL tube.\nCollect an additional tube with 2 million cells for nucleofection control.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 × g for 3 min.\nIn the meantime, combine the following in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube: 5 μg TH-TdTomato vector + 1 μg CRISPR 1 + 1 μg CRISPR 2 + 100 μl nucleofection mix (see nucleofection mix[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.3]).",
    "For the nucleofection control, combine: 5 μg pmaxGFP Vector (provided by the nucleofection kit) + 100 μl nucleofection mix.\nAspirate the supernatant from the 15-mL tube and gently resuspend the pellet in nucleofection mix + DNA using a 200-μl pipet tip.\nPipet the cells once gently and transfer to a cuvette provided by the nucleofection kit.\nPlace cuvettes on ice.\nNucleofect using Program Ca137 on a 4D-Nucleofector Core Unit.\nPlace cuvettes back on ice.\nRemove Geltrex solution from 10-cm dishes and replace with 8 mL/dish StemFlex medium + 2 μM Thiazovivin (pre-warmed to 37°C). No wash step is required after Geltrex removal.\nGently remove the cells from the cuvette using a pipet provided by the nucleofection kit and transfer to the prepared dishes from step 13.\nStore the plates in the incubator.\nOn day 1 post-nucleofection observe all plates under a TC microscope to ensure that the cells look healthy and that the nucleofection control group is expressing GFP.\nDo not change media on this day.\nNote: The peak of GFP expression occurs at around 16 h post-nucleofection.\nOn day 2 post-nucleofection begin selection with 1 μg/mL puromycin for 48 h to select for transgene integration. Supplement StemFlex medium with puromycin and change media daily. Thiazovivin is not added at this point.\nNote: It is recommended to perform a puromycin kill curve test before this step when working with new hPSC lines to determine the best working concentration (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nOn day 4 post-nucleofection replace media with fresh StemFlex medium without puromycin.\nChange media every other day until hPSC colonies are clearly visible by eye (5–7 days).",
    "Expected outcome: 10–50 puromycin-resistant colonies per 10-cm dish 5–7 days post-selection depending on the cell line used. The hPSC colonies derived during targeting generally arise from single cells post-selection and therefore have a circular morphology. The colonies are visible by eye when they reach ~1–2 mm in diameter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPassage the cells as described in steps 1–15. Pool all colonies together using Accutase by additional trituration with a 1-mL pipet tip to break down chunks of cells. A longer Accutase incubation time may be required for this step.\nUse half of the cell suspension for Cre-GFP targeting. Freeze the other half into 2 or more cryovials (depending on the pellet size) as backup before Cre-GFP nucleofection.\nPause Point: Alternatively, all cells can be frozen at this stage as pre-Cre targeted hPSCs. While it is recommended to avoid freeze-thaw cycles during the entire cell line derivation process, backup freezes are encouraged whenever possible.\nNote: If the number of cells is insufficient, the pre-Cre hPSCs can be passaged regularly once to expand before Cre-GFP targeting.\nRepeat the nucleofection process using 5 μg Cre-GFP vector to remove the puromycin selection cassette.\nInclude a non-nucleofected negative control as well as a GFP nucleofection control for fluorescence gating during FACS.\nNote: The nucleofection conditions described here have been optimized for the WA01 and BJ-SiPS hPSC lines used in this study. Further optimization may be required when using new lines, such as adjusting the amount of DNA added to the cells.\nAlternatively, lipofection can be used for targeting.\nOptional: We have successfully used Lipofectamine Stem Transfection Reagent as an alternative to nucleofection for generation of knock-in hPSC lines using the following conditions. Similar to the nucleofection protocol, optimization may be required when using new hPSC lines.",
    "Passage hPSCs to a 6-well plate at 70%–80% confluency in StemFlex medium + 2 μM Thiazovivin 1 h prior to transfection.\nPrepare the following mixes in separate tubes (amount per well):\n1 mL Opti-MEM + 4 μl Lipofectamine\n1 mL Opti-MEM + 4 μg Targeting vector + 1 μg CRISPR 1 + 1 μg CRISPR 2\nCombine the contents of the two tubes and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nReplace StemFlex medium with the transfection mix and place in the incubator for 2 h.\nChange media to fresh StemFlex medium.\nFor Cre-GFP transfection, use 5 μg plasmid per reaction and proceed to perform FACS on the following day.\nOn day 1 post-nucleofection, prepare cells for FACS.\nNote: The peak of Cre-GFP expression occurs at around 16 h post-nucleofection. The cells can be sorted up to 48 h post-nucleofection, although we usually sort on the following day.\nPerform FACS and plate 5,000 – 10,000 GFP+ cells per 10-cm Geltrex-coated dish containing 8 mL StemFlex stock pre-warmed to 37°C (see hPSC StemFlex stock[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.4]).\nOn day 3 post-nucleofection, replace media with fresh StemFlex medium without Thiazovivin and Pen/Strep.\nChange media every other day until hPSC colonies are clearly visible by eye (7–10 days).\nExpected outcome: 10–50 post-Cre colonies per 10-cm dish 7–10 days post-nucleofection depending on the cell line used (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Colonies can be picked more easily when they reach a diameter of at least 1–2 mm. We generally pick 24–48 colonies per line.\nOn the day of colony picking, remove any debris by changing media to StemFlex stock.\nPrepare desired number of uncoated 12-well plates with 0.5 mL/well StemFlex stock.\nCoat the same number of 12-well plates with Geltrex solution. Remove Geltrex solution right before plating the colonies.",
    "Pick colonies under sterile TC conditions, triturate well, and plate one colony per well of a Geltrex-coated 12-well plate in StemFlex stock.\nFor colony picking, a sterile microscope set up in a TC hood is required. If not available, a microscope can be cleaned thoroughly with 70% ethanol and then placed inside a TC hood. Pick colonies one at a time under the microscope by scraping and collecting with a 200-μl pipet tip set to 200 μl volume and transfer to the uncoated 12-well plate. Once a plate is full, triturate each colony further with a separate 1-mL pipet tip and transfer to the Geltrex-coated plate one at a time. Store the plates in the incubator.\nUsing the same pipet tip, collect cells from each colony in PCR strips for gDNA extraction (cell suspension volume of 100–200 μl). Centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 3 min and resuspend the pellets in lysis buffer. Combine 1 mL DirectPCR Lysis Reagent + 25 μl Proteinase K, resuspend cell pellets in 40–60 μl of the mix depending on the pellet size, and follow the manufacturer’s guidelines.\nAnalyze transgene integration in collected gDNA samples using touchdown PCR. We use three reactions (5′, 3′, and 5′3′) to genotype and confirm the knock-in clones (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_610_2.csv\nNote: No large band should be observed in the 5′3′ PCR as the program does not amplify long sequences. The expected 1044 bp band size is from the untargeted or wild-type (WT) allele in heterozygous clones. No bands are observed in the 5′3′ PCR for homozygous clones.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_610_3.csv",
    "Validate positive colonies that were identified by PCR using Sanger sequencing. As an example, we have shown the sequencing results for two clones, WA01 TH #2 and BJ-SiPS TH #3, using the “TH-TdTomato Forward” primer for the 5′ PCR (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). The results show alignment of the 5′ PCR products to the TH gene sequence post homologous recombination (HR) and post Cre excision.\nExpand the selected colonies, prepare several frozen stocks, and further validate the knock-in hPSC lines by karyotyping.\nNote: Make sure to use a different pipet tip to aspirate the medium from each well during media change to avoid cross-contamination between colonies.\nPause Point: All cells can be frozen at this stage as post-Cre targeted hPSCs. It is recommended to freeze a few vials as backup at the beginning of the expansion phase, followed by a large stock once the hPSC lines of interest have been verified.\nCritical: It is crucial to sequence the 5′3′ PCR product of the untargeted allele as CRISPR-mediated changes (indels) are common.\nSeeding and maintenance of hPSC lines in spinner flasks\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThese steps describe the process of hPSC harvesting from monolayer cultures and seeding into spinner flasks to generate 3D spheres, as well as maintenance of the pluripotent spheres until the onset of neuronal differentiation.\nPassage hPSC lines to four 10-cm dishes for seeding into spinner flasks.\nFollow the passaging guidelines in steps 1–15.\nSeed ~40 × 106 cells per flask from four 10-cm dishes at near confluency.\nNote: For all steps of hPSC culture except for nucleofection we use small clumps of cells for passaging to enhance cell survival. Therefore, less trituration is required after incubation with Accutase.\nDay -5: Prepare 120 mL/flask StemFlex stock (see seeding StemFlex stock[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.5]).",
    "Prepare spinner flasks by carefully adding 115 mL StemFlex stock from one of the side arms and placing it on the nine-position stir plate set to 65 rpm in the incubator.\nMake sure that the top screw is tightly closed, while the two side screws are loosened to allow for air exchange.\nOptional: One vial of DNase can be added per flask to reduce potential clump formation.\nEnsure that hPSCs show healthy stem cell morphology and are at 70%–80% confluency on day of seeding with merged colonies and a few remaining individual colonies (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). Unlike the hPSC colonies derived during targeting, those in regular culture have a less circular morphology as they arise from clumps of cells rather than single cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/610-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Filter cells through a 35 μm cell strainer.\nAdd the cells to the flask from one of the side arms and place back in the incubator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nDay -4: Monitor spheres daily from here on. Small spheres visible by eye are formed 24 h after seeding (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nDay -3: Allow the pluripotent spheres to settle by gravity, then aspirate half the media (60 mL) from one of the side arms and replace with fresh StemFlex medium + 10 μM Y-27632.\nIf large clumps are observed, remove them by filtering spheres through a 500 μm strainer into a 50-mL tube, then gently return the spheres to the flask.\nDay -1: Allow the pluripotent spheres to settle by gravity, then replace half the media with fresh StemFlex medium without Y-27632.\nBegin differentiation on D0 after filtering through a 300 μm strainer.\nNote: Depending on the hPSC line used a shorter or longer time may be required to reach D0.\nDifferentiation of pluripotent spheres into midbrain progenitor organoids\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis section describes the patterning of pluripotent spheres into organoids containing midbrain neural progenitor cells (mNPCs), as well as QC methods to ensure that the patterning worked properly.\nDay 0: Allow the pluripotent spheres to settle by gravity, then filter through a 300 μm strainer into a 50-mL tube.\nBegin differentiation by complete media change (120 mL) to D0-1 patterning medium (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, see preparation of media[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/610-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bar: 250 μm.\nDay 1: Change half the media with D0-1 patterning medium.\nDay 2: Change half the media with D2-3 patterning medium.\nDay 3: Change half the media with D2-3 patterning medium.\nDay 4: Change half the media with D4-7 patterning medium.\nNote: CHIR99021 promotes mNPC proliferation. The organoids will begin to grow at a faster rate from here on and the media may turn more yellow orange (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C, troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). If too much media is being used up by the cells, excess organoids must be removed. Alternatively, the organoids can be divided into two or more flasks or transferred into larger (500-mL) flasks.\nDay 5: Change half the media with D4-7 patterning medium.\nBy this timepoint the organoids appear smooth on the surface and have a brighter periphery, indicating the emergence of neuroectoderm upon neural induction. This change in appearance has been previously reported in other brain organoid cultures (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nDay 6: Change half the media with D4-7 patterning medium.\nDay 7: Change half the media with D4-7 patterning medium.",
    "Day 8: Change most of the media (80 mL) with D8-11 patterning medium.\nNote: A larger volume is changed on this day to reduce the concentrations of Purmorphamine and SAG in the flasks.\nDay 9: Change half the media with D8-11 patterning medium.\nDay 10: Change half the media with D8-11 patterning medium.\nDay 11: Change half the media with D8-11 patterning medium.\nDay 12: Change most of the media (80 mL) with D12-21 terminal medium.\nContinue to change media daily until D22.\nNote: A larger volume is changed on this day to reduce the concentration of CHIR99021 in the flasks.\nOptional: At this point the midbrain progenitor organoids can be transferred to low-attachment 6-well plates on a shaker if several conditions or treatments are required, for example for genetic or chemical perturbation studies.\nDay 15+: Perform QC experiments on the organoids for midbrain progenitor and DN markers such as FOXA2, LMX1A, EN1, OTX2, CORIN, and TH using Western blot (WB), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, or qRT-PCR to confirm midbrain identity (Kirkeby et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). As an example, we have shown WB results for FOXA2 and TH, as well as qRT-PCR results for FOXA2 and LMX1A in D15 organoids (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E, see antibody dilutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.9]). The qRT-PCR primers used in this study are listed in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nIn addition, the midbrain organoids can be dissociated using papain solution and plated as 2D monolayer cultures for live imaging or fixation for IF staining (see reagents and tools for dissociation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.8]). We recommend using 96-well μCLEAR plates coated with PLO and laminin and plating 40,000 cells per well, although this number may have to be optimized in independent hPSC lines (see PLO/Laminin-coated plates[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.7]). The μCLEAR plates are thin on the bottom and work well for imaging.",
    "Optional: The following dissociation protocol can be used for sample preparation for both FACS and plating (see reagents and tools for dissociation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.8]).\nWash ~20 large organoids (~1 mm in diameter) in 5 mL PBS in a well of a 6-well plate. More organoids can be used per well if they are smaller.\nIncubate in 5 mL/well papain solution on a shaker placed in the incubator for 20–30 min.\nGently triturate the organoids with fire-polished Pasteur pipets of decreasing tip sizes attached to dropper bulbs.\nFilter the mixture through a 70 μm mesh into a 50-mL tube containing 10 mL incubation medium.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet in desired amount of FACS buffer or differentiation medium and proceed to FACS or plating.\nOptional: If using a TH-TdTomato line, expression of the TH reporter starting on D15 can serve as an additional QC step (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F). In addition, organoids can be plated on PLO/laminin-coated plates starting on D15 to allow for axonal outgrowths upon organoid attachment to the well surface (see PLO/Laminin-coated plates[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.7]). This approach, referred to as “organoid splatting,” is a form of 2.5D culture that allows for general observation of axonal morphology as well as TH expression in 2D DN axons in TH-TdTomato reporter lines, while preserving the 3D structure of the organoid (see step 67).\nMaturation of midbrain progenitor organoids into DNs\nTiming: 3+ weeks\nThese steps describe the maintenance and maturation of midbrain progenitor organoids into DNs, as well as QC methods for the maturing midbrain organoids.",
    "Note: The onset of TH expression may vary slightly in different hPSC lines. However, in our experience, a few cells begin showing TH around D15 followed by a spike in its expression within a few days. By D20 there should be a robust reporter expression in the organoids and TH-TdTomato+ neurons are clearly visible under the microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nDay 20+: From this early timepoint, the expression of TH, as well as neuronal markers such as TUBB3, can be monitored by IF staining in fixed organoid cryosections (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4C) or dissociated neurons (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4D, see antibody dilutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.9]). TH+ cells in a monolayer culture of dissociated neurons were quantified using the Fiji and CellProfiler software for neurons stained with antibodies against TH and RFP (for the TH-TdTomato reporter). TH+ cells comprise approximately 10% of the total population and 16% of the TUBB3+ neuronal population on D21 (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4F). These values may be variable between cell lines, but TH expression is expected to continue to increase until DN maturation around D36. For a kinetic analysis of TH expression using our reporter system please refer to Ahfeldt et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/610-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(F) Quantification of D21 TH+ cells (as denoted by RFP staining for the TH-TdTomato reporter) as a percentage of TUBB3+ cells in D and similar images (n=35 per replicate). Error bars represent SEM.\nAll scale bars: 100 μm.\nDay 22: Switch to D22-36 terminal medium (see preparation of media[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]).\nFrom here on the media can be changed every other day if the rate of nutrient uptake is slowing down. However, daily media changes must be maintained if the color is still turning yellow orange.\nIt is recommended to plate D22+ dissociated neurons on human astrocytes to enhance survival. If using the TH-TdTomato reporter line, DNs can be sorted and plated in mixed cultures or used for other downstream applications. The scalability of our protocol allows for a large number of DNs to be sorted at a time, although this step is easier and faster at later timepoints when TH expression has increased.\nNote: The concentrations of BDNF and GDNF are reduced at this point as these reagents have been shown to mask DN-specific phenotypes in vitro (Stahl et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nDay 36: Switch to D36+ terminal medium.\nThe organoids are ~1 mm in diameter by this timepoint (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nFor long-term culture, media can be changed once every 3–4 days if the color is not turning yellow orange and if the organoids are not too crowded.\nPerform QC experiments on the organoids for mature DN markers such as NURR1 (NR4A2), GIRK2 (KCNJ6), PITX3, DAT1 (SCL6A3), VMAT2 (SLC18A2), DDC, and TH to confirm their identity (Hartfield et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). As an example, we have shown qRT-PCR results for NURR1 and GIRK2 in D30 organoids (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/610-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Arrows point to examples of regions in which melanin is localized to DNs. The nuclei are counterstained with hematoxylin (light blue). Scale bar: 100 μm.\nNote: DAPT is removed at this point since it has been shown to inhibit astrocyte proliferation and may influence phenotypes associated with mature DNs (Roberts et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]; Zhang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). Therefore, switching to D36+ terminal medium may cause further growth in organoid size over time. Similarly, dcAMP is removed in D36+ medium as it has a neuroprotective effect on midbrain DNs (Momčilović et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) and may therefore have an impact on in vitro DN-related phenotypes.",
    "Optional: If using a TH-TdTomato line, the increase in TH expression over time can be observed in mature DNs. The midbrain organoids can also be dissociated and analyzed by flow cytometry or sorted for downstream applications such as plating on astrocytes or bulk transcriptomics and other omics studies. Flow cytometry analysis of dissociated WA01 TH organoids shows a 30% TH-TdTomato+ cell population on D30 of differentiation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]). An advantage of this approach over fluorescent imaging is that the cells that express lower levels of TH can be detected more easily as the entire TH-TdTomato+ population can be visualized. Another use of our DN reporter is to splat organoids to observe axonal outgrowth in mature DNs (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C), as mentioned in step 64.\nLong-term culture: The midbrain organoids can be cultured in flasks or on low-attachment plates on a shaker for a long period of time.\nPrevious studies have shown the emergence of astrocytes in midbrain organoids around D60 of differentiation (Monzel et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of D80 midbrain organoid sections shows expression of the astrocyte marker, GFAP, suggesting that long-term culture using our protocol results in astrocyte development (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D, see antibody dilutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3.9]).\nNeuromelanin expression is a key feature of the subpopulation of DNs located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (Zecca et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). Fontana-Masson staining of D200 midbrain organoids shows melanin expression in DNs, as indicated by TH staining, as well as in other cell types (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E), suggesting that the cultures become more mature over time and obtain characteristics of the midbrain in vivo, including the appearance of neuromelanin."
