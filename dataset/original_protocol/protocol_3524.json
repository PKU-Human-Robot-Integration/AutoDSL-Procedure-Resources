    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAcute brain slice preparation\nTiming: 2.5–3 h\nPreparing tissue for calcium imaging follows the exact same protocol as for electrophysiological recordings with the exception of the addition of 12 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to the NMDG and HEPES holding solutions. This has the benefit of preserving glutathione production and improves calcium imaging in acute brain slices (Ting et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nFinal preparation of slicing solutions. (∼ 25 min)\nMeasure 180 mL of NMDG stock solution and 90 mL of HEPES holding solution.\nMix in 392 and 196 mg of NAC to NMDG and HEPES solutions respectively.\nBubble solutions with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for 10 min.\npH the NMDG using HCl and/or KOH to 7.24\npH the HEPES solution using HCl and/or NaOH to 7.24.\nAdjust osmolarity to 300 mOsm.\nMeasure the slightly overconcentrated solutions with an osmometer\nReduce osmolarity by adding volumes of ddH2O. For NMDG; volume needed (mL) ∼= (Osm × 180/300 – 180 ) × 0.9 For HEPES; volume needed (mL) ∼= (Osm × 90/300 – 90) × 0.9\nTypically this will bring the final volume to ∼ 200 mL of NMDG, and 100 mL of HEPES.\nDissection and Sectioning. (∼ 45 min)\nSetup dissection tools and vibratome and water bath.\nBring water bath to 35°C.\nAssemble useful tools: including, large scissors (for removing head), small scissors (for cutting skin and skull), blunt forceps, spatula, single edge razor blade; tray and Styrofoam lid for pinning and dissection; syringe for cardiac perfusion.\nPack vibratome outer-chamber with ice. Fill inner-chamber with 100 mL of the ice-cold NMDG solution. Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\nPlace remaining 100 mL of ice-cold NMDG in slice-holding chamber, and keep on ice. Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Reserve a small amount for cardiac perfusion.",
    "Anesthetize the research animal according to institutional requirements. Vaporized isoflurane will anesthetize the mice and slow the breathing rate. Animals should be alive, but non-responsive to serious toe pinch. An inverted 15 mL centrifuge tube containing a tissue moistened with additional isoflurane placed over the animal’s snout will ensure a continued anesthetized state during cardiac perfusion procedure.\nPin animal, expose heart, puncture right atrium and perfuse ∼10 mL of ice-cold NMDG solution into left ventricle.\nQuickly remove head, open skull, and remove brain directly into the ice-cold NMDG. Let sit for 1 min.\nRemove to a towel and bisect hemispheres. Block brain for semi-transverse sections (about 22.5 degrees from coronal, and angled slightly off vertical, inward/downward) with single edge razor blade.\nDab on towel, and glue the cut cerebellar side to the vibratome plate. Insert plate into vibratome.\nSlice at 280 μm thickness, using speed ∼ 0.16–0.20 mm/s and amplitude of 1.6 mm. Slow sectioning while cutting through the hippocampus will preserve integrity of the hippocampal layers.\nGently collect sections containing hippocampus into a slice holder containing ice-cold NMDG using inverted/cut transfer pipette, or gentle paintbrush.\nWarming. (∼ 10 min)\nTransfer the NMDG containing slice holder with sections from the ice, into the 35°C water bath.\nContinue bubbling in the water bath for 8–10 min. Do not over-warm. It is recommended to shield from light to preserve fluorescence.\nRecovery. (∼ 1.5 h)\nRemove holder from water bath.\nCarefully discard the NMDG solution, and replace with 20°C–24°C, bubbled HEPES holding solution. Ensure that sections are submerged and loosely separated. Continue bubbling at 20°C–24°C for 1–1.5 h. Take care that bubbling is not so vigorous as to cause turbulence/tumbling of the sections. Continue shielding from light with sheets of aluminum foil.",
    "Critical: All materials and equipment involved in the preparation of acute brain slices must not have come in contact with fixative (paraformaldehyde or equivalent). Reserve glassware, dissection tools, and vibratome for “live tissue only.” Do not share equipment with lab personnel that use fixative or other harsh chemicals, as it will seriously compromise your tissue. It is recommended not to use detergents or use department dishwashers. Thorough rinsing in water and scrubbing with reserved glassware brush will suffice. Application of 70% ethanol may be used to keep bacteria from growing on tools or slice chambers.\nCritical: GCaMP indicators are light sensitive and will bleach if exposed to intense light. Slice in low light conditions if possible, and ensure that sectioned tissue is shielded from room illumination by covering water-baths and slice-storage chambers with aluminum foil during recovery. Brain slices from juvenile animals are typically healthier and offer good expression of GCaMP indicator. Tissue from aged animals may be less healthy, but this is not limiting. See Ting et al. (2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) for additional tips on preparing slices from aging animals.\nCalcium imaging\nTiming: 4–7 h\nThe techniques to keep brain slices alive and heathy for calcium imaging are identical to those used for electrophysiological recordings. Illumination of tissue with a blue LED and collecting green fluorescence is done using a standard GFP filter-set.\nThe sCMOS camera used here is controlled via Micromanager software, which can also interface with the SliceScope microscope stage (Scientifica). Many popular microscope cameras, such as Hamamatsu or Photometrics cameras, use CCD or sCMOS sensors that offer high sensitivity and speed, and are excellent for detecting fluorescent calcium signals. Most devices are already compatible with the Micromanager software (https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Device_Support[href=https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Device_Support]).",
    "Prepare the 1× ACSF recording solution. Calcium events are very numerous in astrocytes, while very sparse in granule cells. It is often beneficial to adjust the levels of Ca2+ and Mg2+ depending on which cells you will observe to slightly increase or decrease network excitability.\nCombine in ddH2O\nFor Astrocytes:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_446_5.csv\nFor granule cells and mossy cells:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_446_6.csv\nFor CCK Cells:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_446_7.csv\nBubble for at least 10 min at 20°C–24°C with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\npH to 7.24.\nAdjust osmolarity to ∼ 305 mOsm.\nBegin perfusion of ACSF on the microscope, continuing to bubble, and use an IV dripper and flow regulator to control the perfusion rate to about 1–2 mL/min.\nIdentify regions to image.\nPlace a single slice in upright microscope recording chamber. Secure with a slice anchor.\nLocate the dentate gyrus with a 10× air objective.\nSwitch to a long-working distance water-dipping objective with 40× magnification. Confirm the presence of mCherry+ virally targeted CCK neurons containing DREADD construct, and green GCaMP expression in neurons or astrocytes. GCaMP has a low baseline fluorescence, which can be observed as a diffuse green signal. Typically, spread of injected AAV2/5-GCaMP is not spatially restricted as tightly as AAV2-hM3Dq virus, and expression can be found in cells beyond the hilar region, presumably due to differences in capsid or infectability of different cell types. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for typical live-fluorescence appearance of hM3Dq-mCherry and GCaMP expression in astrocytes or neurons in the dentate gyrus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/446-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Typical fluorescence appearance in live tissue of hM3Dq-mCherry targeted CCK interneurons along with GCaMP constructs targeted to astrocytes, mossy cells/granule cells, or CCK interneurons from CCK-Cre animals",

(Middle) CaMKII-GCaMP6 targets glutamatergic cells of the DG including mossy cells and granule cells. (Bottom) CCK neurons expressing both hM3Dq and GCaMP7, with partial colocalization. GCL, granule cell layer; scale bar, 50 μm. See Asrican et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] for additional examples and resolutions.\nSet up an imaging session that acquires data at two different XY stage positions and extends for several different depths into the slice. Adjust the number of cycles to last approximately 10 min.\nNote: Calcium events in acute slice preparation can last several seconds at 20°C–24°C, depending on the specific GCaMP variant that is utilized (fast or slow) and the cell type. Since the frame-rates of most cameras greatly exceed the duration of these calcium events, some time resolution can be sacrificed in order to gain additional image planes. Adjustment of specific imaging parameters may be required for your application.\nThe main limitation on time resolution of image acquisition is the refocusing and movement of the XY translational stage. The following parameters worked well for a Scientifica microscope and Micromanager software and gave an effective time resolution of 2.85 s. While some fast events may be missed, this is acceptable for detecting the majority of slow buffered calcium events.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_446_8.csv\nPower the camera and stage and then start the Micromanager software. If not already done, setup and save a configuration file that can interact with:\nThe CCD camera.\nThe XY stage position.\nThe Z focus position.\nSet camera parameters for 100 ms exposure with no binning.\nOpen the Multi-Dimensional Acquisition Panel in MicroManager.\nEnable “Time Points,” and set the image count to 210 images, 1 ms interval.",
    "Enable “Z-Stacks (Slices)” and Select “Relative Z” mode. Adjust settings to use 5 imaging planes by entering the following parameters:\nEnter 0 for “Start Z.”\nEnter -60 for “End Z.”\nEnter 15 for “Step size.”\nDisable “Channels” checkbox.\nEnable “Multiple Positions (XY)”, and open the “Stage Position List.”\nStart “Live View” and turn on the blue LED.\nMove the XY Stage to the surface of the slice in a field of view of interest. Push “Mark” to store it as Position0.\nMove the XY Stage to a second, non-overlapping region of the tissue. Mark it as Position1.\nStop Live View and turn off the LED.\nMinimize room lights or cover the microscope cage with black-cloth. Allow the slice to equilibrate for 5–10 min to reduce mechanical drift. Recheck positioning to ensure stability of the slice.\nAcquire calcium data.\nOnce baseline drugs are added for 5–10 min (for example, 1 μM TTX) and slice is confirmed to be mechanically stable, turn on the blue LED at the lowest setting that provides reasonable signal. As the fluorescent signal does indeed bleach over time, and cellular activities may be susceptible to phototoxicity, it is critically important not to over-illuminate the tissue.\nPush “Acquire!” to start collecting Data_1.\nWhen complete, turn off the LED and briefly review the dataset. Save the data to disk with an appropriate filename.\nAdd CNO to the ACSF reservoir to begin circuit stimulation of CCK cells. Wait 10 min to allow drugs to reach the slice and begin to activate DREADD receptors.\nWhen time has nearly expired, recheck the stage position and focus, and readjust the stored positions to match the beginning of Data_1 as needed.\nPush “Acquire!” to start collecting Data_2, and save as above.\nWash out drugs and change the slice to continue with additional samples.",
    "Optional: Include various pharmacological agents such as glutamate receptor antagonists in the bath starting at baseline to help determine mechanisms of action. For examples, see Asrican et al., (2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nOptional: Some researchers may wish to acquire calcium data during the 10 min delay in step 8d, or perhaps an additional 10 min period of washout. In this case there will be a total of 3–4 datasets from each slice.\nNote: A highly sensitive CCD camera is useful when imaging calcium, so that the intensity of the illumination light can be minimized. An Optimos sCMOS camera from Q-Imaging is used in this example. While not used here, TTL control of the LED, or addition of a mechanical shutter in the light path can prevent excitation of the sample during non-imaging episodes of the acquisition, such as during focusing or stage-translation.\nNote: Halogen lamps as illumination sources have some intrinsic fluctuations in intensity and result in signal disturbances when sensitive cameras are used. LEDs are typically much more reliable in terms of constant output and have the advantage of also permitting control via TTL signals."
