  "procedures": [
    "1. Rear western corn rootworm for flight tests\nNOTE: If the adult’s age must be controlled or known, adults must first be collected in the field followed by rearing their offspring to adulthood for testing. If the age of the beetle or a standardized rearing environment is not of concern, then directly testing field-collected adults may be possible, and the protocol can begin with step 2.\nCollect at least 500 western corn rootworm adults from a cornfield of interest to ensure enough eggs are obtained for rearing adequate numbers of adults. Use a manual aspirator to collect adults from the field.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to collect adults during peak abundance, around late July in the U.S. Corn Belt, to ensure the collection of both sexes. Most adults will be males if collected earlier, whereas most will be females if collected later.\nPlace the collected male and female adults into a mesh cage containing chopped corn ear, corn leaf tissue, 1.5% agar solid, and an oviposition substrate. An 18 x 18 x 18-cm cage (mesh size 44 x 32, 650 µm aperture) can hold up to 500 adults at one time.\n\t\nUse the corn grown in the field as a source of corn ear, which will be picked at the R3, or milk stage of kernel development19. The R3 kernel is yellow outside, while the inner fluid is milky white due to accumulating starch. Corn ears can be frozen and stored for up to a year until they are needed. To feed the rootworm, remove the husk and chop the corn into horizontal cross-sections about 3 cm thick. Chopped corn is the primary diet for the adults and should be changed out twice a week.",
    "Obtain leaves from greenhouse-grown corn plants of any age. Amount of leaf tissue will vary with the number of adults in the cage. Avoid using field plants, as they may introduce disease.\nTo make the solid agar, mix 15 g of agar powder with 1 L of DI water. Heat the mixture until boiling. Pour the liquid into Petri dishes (100 mm x 15 mm) while it is hot. Place a lid on the Petri dish once cool and place them into cold storage (6° C). Agar provides adults with a source of moisture and should be changed out twice a week.\nTo prepare an oviposition substrate, place 40 g of sieved field soil (<180 µm) into a Petri dish. Moisten the soil with deionized water. Ensure that the soil at the bottom of the Petri dish appears wet. Score the top of the moistened soil with a needle tool. Remove the oviposition substrate weekly and place in an incubator at 25° C and 60% RH for at least one month.\nAfter incubating eggs for one month, wash the contents of the oviposition substrate through a 250-µm sieve until all soil has been removed. Quantify the eggs by placing washed eggs in a 10-mL graduated cylinder. There are approximately 10,000 eggs per 1 mL.\nPlace the quantified eggs into a 44-mL container and cover with sieved field soil (<180 µm). Western corn rootworm eggs undergo obligate diapause through the winter20. To break diapause, place eggs into cold storage (6° C) for at least 6 months.\n\t​NOTE: Eggs may be kept in cold storage for longer than 5 months, but egg viability decreases with time. After 12 months, there may be little to no hatch.",
    "After a minimum of 5 months, remove eggs from the cold storage and place in an incubator at 25° C and 60% RH. Neonates hatch as early as 16 days after removal from cold storage.\nOnce the eggs hatch, place three germinated kernels at the bottom of a 44-mL plastic container with roots exposed (i.e., not covered with soil). Use a soft bristle brush to transfer 12 neonates to the surface of the roots.\nAdd 4.5 mL of DI water to 40 mL of sieved soil (<600 µm). Place the moistened soil over the germinated kernels that have been infested with neonates and cover the container with mesh fabric to prevent larvae from escaping.\nOn the same day that the 44-mL plastic container is set up with neonates, prepare a 473-mL container with corn kernels that have not germinated. The rootworm larvae will be transferred to this larger container later. The number of kernels determines the desired larval density per plant. Add 120 g of soil mixture consisting of 50% sieved field soil (<600 µm) and 50% potting soil moistened with 20 ml of deionized water.\nAfter 7 days, transfer all contents of the 44-mL container to the 473-mL container. The larvae will be second instars at the time of transfer.\n\tNOTE: This transfer to a larger container is necessary to supply larvae with enough root mass for feeding through pupation.\nObserve the emergence of adults typically around 26 days after egg hatch. Adults are active fliers upon emergence and may escape the 473-mL container when attempting to collect them by hand. Instead, use a vacuum with an aspirator to collect adults.",
    "Segregate adults by sex and/or date if needed for comparative testing. Sex of western corn rootworm can be determined by observing the morphology of the prothoracic basitarsi21. Males have broad, square-shaped prothoracic basitarsi, whereas those of females are narrow and conical-shaped.\n\t\nPlace beetle into a 45-mL clear polystyrene plastic vial and cover with a lid with 6 small (~1 mm diameter) holes.\nAnesthetize the beetle. Place the end of a tube attached to a CO2 tank regulator over the holes in the lid and allow a gentle flow of CO2 to enter the tube for approximately 10 to 15 s until the adult loses its grip on the wall of the vial.\n\t\tNOTE: The anesthetized insect will remain immobilized for about 1 min.\nPlace the anesthetized beetle, ventral side up, on an inverted plastic petri dish bottom. Carefully place the non-inverted lid of the petri dish over the beetle. Ensure that the tarsi of the beetle press against the lid, allowing easy observation of the prothoracic basitarsi under a dissecting microscope.\nIf the experiment requires that beetles be mated prior to flight, then use males at least 5 days old to mate with the newly emerged females.\n\tNOTE: Use of older males ensures that they are sexually mature upon their introduction to virgin females. Females are sexually mature upon adult emergence, whereas males require 5 to 7 days of post-emergence development to reach sexual maturity22,23.\n2. Start the flight mill software program prior to flight testing",
    "NOTE: The flight mill program files (.vi file extensions which run in a commercial software platform, see Table of Materials) and details for their use are provided for download via links (\"data analysis routine\" and \"Circular Flight Mill Instructions\", respectively) in the \"Flight mill wiring and software\" section on the Jones et al.18 website. If the programs no longer function in newer or future versions of the software platform, or if the user wants to add new capabilities, the routines provided by Jones et al. 18 can be modified by the user as needed.\nOpen the flight mill software program (Figure 3).\nEnter the information under the Initialization tab.\n\t\nSet the Start Time and End Time for the desired duration of the flight test.\n\t\tNOTE: All adults should be tethered and mounted on flight mills by 30 min prior to the Start Time. It may take an experienced person 30 min to 45 min to tether and prepare 16 beetles for flight testing (see Section 3).\nSet the Min Threshold (min) to 0. This ensures that any detection of the flight arm passing will be recorded, and is the default recommended by Jones et al. 18.\nSet the Max Threshold (min) to 1. Here, 1 min was used. This value means that 1 min must elapse between sensor detection of the flight arm to \"call\" the end of a flight.\nEnter a name for the file.\nSet Raw Data Log Interval (min) to 1. This value controls the interval over which the raw data will be compiled for output reporting. Here, it is set to 1 min. Thus, the output of revolutions, for example, will be logged per minute.",
    "NOTE: The actual time interval between electronic scanning of sensor activity is very short, but a 1-min interval allows logging at a fine enough scale for most research purposes, while restricting the number of lines in the spreadsheet output to a reasonable number for examining by eye.\nUnder the Subject Information tab, fill in the columns labeled ID, diet, sex, species, and comments as desired.\nClick on the START button located on the left side of the screen display. The program will begin collecting raw data once the Current Time matches the Start Time.\n3. Tether western corn rootworm to flight mill\nBend a 40-mm length 28-gauge steel wire 90° at the center.\n\tNOTE: The wire may also be of another metal such as copper or brass.\nTake a small amount of dental wax, slightly larger than a pinhead, and roll it between the fingertips until a ball is formed. Ensure that fingers are clean to prevent debris, dirt, and oil from incorporating into the wax, because it may prevent the wax from adhering to the insect.\nPush one end of the 40 mm the bent wire into the center of the ball of wax.\nAnesthetize the test adult with CO2 as described above (see 1.11.1 and 1.11.2).\nPlace the anesthetized adult on a flat surface and position its dorsal side up. If the beetle does not lie completely flat on the surface, reposition the legs so that it does. It is important that the beetle lie as flat as possible on the surface to ensure the correct positioning of the wire.",
    "Briefly (< 1 s) heat the dental wax on the wire with a butane lighter. If the wax is heated for too long, the melted wax will drop off of the wire. Do not reuse the wax if it has fallen off from the wire, as it will not effectively adhere to the insect cuticle.\nCarefully place the end of the steel wire with the melted dental wax on the dorsal surface of the pronotum, while pointing the other end of the wire, (i.e., the end without dental wax), along the midline of the abdomen. Alternatively, point the end of the wire without the dental wax toward the head if desired. In that case, a flying beetle will push the flight arm instead of pulling it. Be sure that the melted wax does not get on the elytra or its sutures, as it may prevent or hinder flight.\nPlace the free end of the wire into the opening of the hollow metal tube of the flight mill arm. Ensure that the wire fits tight enough to hold in place by friction. The tethered beetle may be positioned to fly either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\nImmediately after mounting a beetle, tear a small piece (~1-cm dia) of tissue paper from a larger tissue. Offer the tissue piece to the tethered beetle hanging from the flight mill for tarsal contact; most beetles will grasp the tissue and hold it against gravity until they release it at the beginning of their first flight activity. This will greatly reduce initial escape or landing flight behavior.",
    "NOTE: Human presence in the flight-testing room should be limited to attaching and removing adults from the flight mills. The test period usually does not begin until at least 30 min have elapsed since attachment (see Note under 2.2.1), and humans should not be present in the flight room during this time or during the test period itself.\nRemove all flight-tested adults after completion of a flight mill test. Remove the wax bead connecting the tether to the pronotum by gently peeling the wire away from the pronotum. The wax will separate easily without damaging the cuticle, making the insect available for further experimentation if desired.\n4. Save the data collected from the flight mill program.\nThe program may be set to either MANUAL or AUTO. If the program is set to manual, then the user must end the program by clicking the STOP button. If the program is set to AUTO, then the program will stop collecting raw data once the Current Time matches the End Time.\nClick EXIT after the flight-testing period has ended.\nEnsure that a TDMS file is saved under the file name entered during program initialization (step 2.2).\nClick on the TDMS file and save the document as a spreadsheet (.xlsx).\n5. Retrieve flight parameters from the saved spreadsheet (.xlsx)\nNOTE: A spreadsheet can be custom designed to manipulate the raw data output from the flight mill software. Here, the software program was the same as described by Jones et al. 18, but an additional routine was added to recognize and summarize the longest uninterrupted flight by an individual insect during the test period.\nFor each individual that engaged in flight activity, the spreadsheet will include the following information: flight number, total revolutions, start time, end time, and flight duration in minutes.",
    "To calculate the total distance flown during the test period, sum the column labeled ‘Total Revs’ and multiply it by the distance flown per revolution. Distance per revolution depends on the length of the flight arm from the central pivot to the attached insect. For example, if this distance is 15.9 cm, each revolution is equivalent to one meter flown. The total number of revolutions may also be found in the ‘Test Stats’ tab.\nTo calculate the total duration flown during the test period, sum the column labeled ‘Flight Duration (min)’.\nTo determine the distance and duration of the longest uninterrupted flight, go to the ‘Test Stats’ tab and look under the column labeled ‘Longest Flight #’.\nFlight speed can be calculated by dividing distance flown by flight duration. For insects, speed is commonly expressed in m/s or km/h.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
