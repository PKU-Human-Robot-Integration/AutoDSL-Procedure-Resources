  "procedures": [
    "This protocol adheres to the Jinan University research guidelines. As only the medical school of the university has an IRB board, no other discipline is required to have IRB approvals. However, the researchers confirm that all ethical rules and regulations were followed. The project did not pose any physical or psychological harm to participants.\n1. Participant screening for the experiment\nRecruit native Chinese speakers from a southern Chinese university with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no hearing impairments nor psychiatric history.\nMeasure loneliness using the third edition of the UCLA scale60,61. Categorize those who score 44 or above in the scale as the lonely group and place the rest in the normal group. In terms of gender and age distribution, the group corresponds to the demographic characteristics of barrage viewers47.\n2. Stimuli construction\nUse rational appeal ads and emotional appeal ads as video stimuli. Positive emotional ads provide emotional support for lonely audiences, where rational ads do not.\n\t\nChoose ads that are standalone video pieces that do not require contextual information to comprehend. The typical ad length is also ideal for quick variations, experimental manipulations, and for eye-tracking data collection62. The length of each video is about one minute.\nTo ensure that emotional and rational appeals are manipulated successfully, have people watch and rate a pool of preselected ads based on these appeals. Here, thirteen coders majoring in advertising were used.\n\t\nTo maximize manipulation, choose videos with the highest scores in either categories to be the experimental stimuli. The final selected ads represented eight kinds of products. The same product has an emotional ad and a rational ad.\nMake the barrage video. There are two ways to make a barrage video for research.",
    "Upload the video to a barrage website, such as the B station at Bilibili (https://www.bilibili.com/). Have participants log into their accounts to watch, and comment. The uploader controls the position of the barrage, usually at the upper third of the screen.\nAlternatively, use video editing software to convert barrage into subtitles, so comments can be manually added to the video barrage area. The ready-made video can then be called in the data-collection process. This experiment used the second method.\nProduce four presentation orders for the experiment to randomize presentational effects. In this design, each participant only saw one version of a particular video, either emotional or rational appeal of an ad, and each saw eight ads altogether.\n3. Eye tracking protocol\nEye tracking procedure\n\t\nUse a commercial eye tracker in the study. Set the default setting for the tracker gaze sample rate at 60 Hz per second.\nPlace a 24-inch computer screen 50 cm from the participant’s chair. Attach the eye tracker to the computer.\nInvite the participant in the lab. Ask the participant to read and sign an informed consent form. Ask the participant to sit comfortably in front of the test computer.\nHave the experimenter check, and adjust the chair height if necessary, to make sure that the TV screen is at the participant’s eye level.\nAsk participants to sit still to complete a calibration task to ensure that data collected during the experiment are accurate. Inform participant that a 5-point calibration is necessary to achieve the highest accuracy in data collection, and to track participants’ gaze within 2° of accuracy.\nAsk participant to follow a moving red dot on the computer screen with both eyes and to fixate on it when it stopped. If a participant looks away during calibration, then repeat the process.",
    "Check the tracker software to see if a participant misses a calibration point. If so, repeat the calibration.\nAsk the participant to click the left mouse button to start an exercise test to familiarize them with the experimental procedure.\nStart the main experiment and tell the participant that he/she will see a red \"+\" sign in the middle of the screen, which lasts 500 ms, alerting to the start of the experiment.\nAsk participant to watch the first video while eye tracking is on.\nAfter the first video, ask participant to complete a questionnaire page, which automatically pops up. Have participants complete a battery of evaluative measures on satisfaction with the viewing by clicking the left mouse button and choosing ratings.\nAsk participant to take a break if desired or continue to another video (see Figure 3, credited to computers in Human Behaviors (CHB) for a flowchart of the experiment).\nRepeat the procedure seven more times for each participant to complete the entire protocol and the eight ads for each.\nThank, debrief, and pay participant CN¥10.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61089/61089fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Experimental flowchart Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61089/61089fig03large.jpg]\nEye-tracking data and self-reported data analysis",
    "NOTE: The eye tracker recorded the whole length of the experiment, including the segments of ad watching and questionnaire responding. In this recording, eye movement data were superimposed over video. Two measures were used in this study, including fixations and durations. A fixation is where the eyes were relatively still, with the central foveal vision being held in place so the human visual system could process the information in that point. A fixation in an eye-tracker was typically defined as a succession of raw gaze points where the velocity was below a pre-defined threshold in the tracker’s gaze filter. More than 60 ms of gaze would be considered as a fixation. Duration, on the other hand, was the length of time between the onset of first gaze point and the last gaze point that make up a fixation.\n\t\nSlice the entire recording into eight segments corresponding to each ad watching segment. Each clip still contains the original ad and eye movement data.\nOn the sliced video, use the tracker software to draw an area of interest (AOI) to distinguish between eye movement data in the barrage area and non-barrage area. The top third was the AOI for barrage, and the lower two-thirds were the AOI for non-barrage.\nFirst count the number of fixations for each video segment, and separate them into fixations on the barrage AOI and non-barrage AOI.\nCalculate durations.\nCompare duration and the number of fixations at the barrage AOI relative to the whole scene. These two measures allow researchers to infer where participants are focusing and what elements they are paying attention to while watching the videos.\nAnalyze self-reported data to examine participants' satisfaction towards video\nSubscription Required.
