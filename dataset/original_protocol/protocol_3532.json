    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMicroscope preparation\nTiming: 10 min\nHere, directions are provided to setup a Nikon Ti-E Eclipse inverted microscope system for live-cell imaging experiments. These steps are similar for other microscopes and acquisition software such as Metamorph, AxioVision, and Olympus Zen. Please refer to the manufacturer's instructions how to send a TTL signal to the Master-8.\nLive imaging experiments are performed on a Nikon Ti-E Eclipse inverted microscope system fitted with a Confocal A1R (LU4A Laser) unit and an EMCCD (Andor DU-897), a 40× oil objective (NA 1.3) and appropriate filter sets. NIS Elements software (version 4.30) controls the microscope and image acquisition. Electrical field stimulation is applied via two parallel platinum electrodes controlled by a Master-8 (AMPI) connected to a stimulus isolator (A-395, World Precision Instruments). Superfusion of NH4Cl containing Tyrode’s through a glass capillary placed just above the neuron is controlled with a pinch valve (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nIn the image acquisition software NIS Elements open ND Acquisition and select time. Set the interval as time between frames to 0.5 s for 2 Hz image acquisition, and the duration of the image acquisition.\nSet TTL out to trigger the Master-8 at the start of the image acquisition.\nSet up a Master-8 paradigm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/454-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Master 8 setup",
    "Graphical representation of the Master 8 interface and stimulation paradigm used in this protocol. Channel 1 is connected to the computer (PC), channel 3 is connected to the stimulus isolator, and channel 4 is connected to the pinch valve system for Tyrode’s NH4Cl application. Channels 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 are not connected to an external device. Channel 1 receives the TTL signal from the PC at the start of the time-lapse recording. After a 30 s (L) delay, channel 1 delivers a 1 ms (D) trigger to channel 2 and channel 4. Channel 2 responds with 16 (M) 1 ms (D) pulses every 1.5 s (I) that triggers channel 3 with 50 (M) 1 ms (D) pulses every 20 ms (I). Thus, the communication between channel 2 and 3 generates the 16 trains of 50 action potentials at 50 Hz. Channel 4 responds 50 s (L) after input from channel 1 by delivering a 5 s (D) trigger to the pinch valve to start Tyrode's NH4Cl perfusion.\nStart with a delay of 30 s to record baseline fluorescence.\nSend 50, 1 ms pulses at 50 Hz to the stimulus isolator for 16 times with 0.5 s between bursts.\nAdd a delay of 26 s to record post-stimulus fusion events.\nSend a 10 s pulse to the pinch valve controller to start superfusion of NH4Cl containing Tyrode’s 26 s after stimulation.\nFill Tyrode’s and Tyrode’s NH4Cl syringes for gravity flow delivery via software controlled pinch valves (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nLive-cell imaging, Ca2+ imaging\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h\nThis step visualizes intracellular Ca2+ elevations upon stimulation and subsequent buffering from the cytosol. It provides a read out of the culture’s physiological state and is typically performed at the start of each DCV fusion imaging session.",
    "Incubate one coverslip containing uninfected DIV14 neurons with Fluo5-AM (2 μΜ final concentration) for 10 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nPlace the coverslip into an imaging chamber and add 500 μL of Tyrode’s solution.\nPrepare neurons for live-cell imaging at the microscope setup (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nPlace the imaging chamber in the stage holder and bring the neurons in focus using a 40× oil objective in DIC or fluorescence mode (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nEstablish Tyrode's perfusion of 0.5 mL/min by placing one perfusion needle at one end and a suction needle at the opposite end of the imaging chamber.\nPlace two platinum electrodes connected to the stimulus isolator at opposite sides of an astrocyte microdot containing a single neuron.\nCritical: Make sure that the distance between the electrodes spans one astrocyte microdot (± 0.5mm) and are placed in such a way that the center of your field of view lies between the electrodes. Lower the electrodes as far as possible, just above the glass coverslip but do not touch the coverslip.\nAdjust the 488nm laser power and camera exposure time for optimal dynamic range.\nCritical: Make sure that the camera pixels are far from saturation since stimulation will typically induce a 100-fold increase in fluorescence.\nStart time-lapse recording (image acquisition at 2Hz, or higher) and trigger the Master-8 via TTL pulse.\nRepeat steps 7c–8 for a maximum of 5 times, or for no longer than 1 h.\nCritical: Make sure to leave at least one astrocyte microdot between a previously stimulated neuron and the next to guarantee that each neuron is naive at the start of each recording.\nAssess Ca2+ influx and efflux of each neuron by plotting intensity over time of multiple regions of interests (ROIs) drawn on the neurites (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/454-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bar, 20 μm in all.\n(B) Top, typical neuron with NPY-pHluorin fusion events, calculated using the Standard Deviation Z-projection option in Fiji, with a zoom of a neurite before field stimulation (B), during stimulation (S), after stimulation (R), and during Tyrode’s NH4Cl superfusion (N). Bottom, five example intensity traces showing typical NPY-pHluorin fusion events (start indicated with green arrow head). The intensity was calculated in 3 × 3 pixel ROIs. Scale bar, 20 μm in all.\nOptional: If you also use synapsin-mCherry you can draw ROIs on synapsin-mCherry positive puncta to image Ca2+ signals in synapses specifically.\nLive-cell imaging, DCV fusion\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step visualizes single fusion events of pHluorin-labeled DCVs upon stimulation.\nPlace one coverslip containing DIV14 neurons infected with NPY-pHluorin (or BDNF-pHluorin) into an imaging chamber and add 500 μL Tyrode's solution.\nSimilar to step 7, establish perfusion, position the platinum electrodes and the glass capillary for Tyrode’s NH4Cl superfusion close to the neuron in focus.\nStart a time-lapse recording with Tyrode’s NH4Cl superfusion at the end of the acquisition to dequench NPY-pHluorin in all DCVs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDCV fusion events detection\nTiming: 30 min/cell",
    "This step provides information on semi-automatic analysis of DCV fusion events in time-lapse recordings. DCV fusion events are detected based on the standard deviation of the signal intensity throughout the stimulation period. After the automatic detection, it is possible to manually inspect the ROIs for false positives, or to manually add new ROIs.\nInstall the DCV_pHluorin toolset by extracting the DCVpHluorin.zip file from Github in the Fiji.app/macros/toolsets folder. Start Fiji and run the toolset via selecting DCV_pHluorin in the toolset dropdown menu (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/454-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. DCV_pHluorin installation and workflow\n(A) Fiji main interface, locate the DCV_pHluorin toolset on the toolset dropdown menu, “≫”.\n(B) Fiji main interface after loading the DCV_pHluorin toolset.\n(C) Visualization of the DCV_pHluorin toolset submenu.\n(D) DCV_pHluorin main workflow. Trapezoid blocks represent steps where the user is required to perform an action.\nAfter the first installation, the toolset needs to be initialized by opening the “Option menu” (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nAs a final step, install the “Check ROIs” plugin via Plugin > Install Plugin… in Fiji interface. Locate the “DCVpHluorin_CheckROIs.groovy” in the Fiji.app/macros/toolsets/DCVpHluorin folder.\nOpen a time-lapse file in Fiji and manually inspect it for focus drift, bleaching, and stage movements. Open the ROI Manager and start the analysis of DCV fusion events via selecting “Fusion detection” under the “Start Analysis Menu,” and adjust the parameters as follows (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D):\nMovie normalization method. “B&W Opening” is set as default, use “Baseline subtraction” for noisy images.\nSet the “Baseline frames” and “Start of NH4 (frame)” according to your time-lapse acquisition settings. In this case 30 and 160, respectively.",
    "Select the “Number of stimulations” and the “Stimulation time (in frames)” accordingly. For more accurate measurements, it is recommended to round the duration of the stimulation period to the closest multiple of 10. For example, the 16 times 50 APs at 50 Hz last for 24 s (48 frames), so the “Stimulation time (frame)” is set to 50 frames. The program will then ask to insert the “Start of the stimulation (frame)” at a later stage.\nNote: in this case, the 16 times 50 APs at 50 Hz is considered as 1 stimulation. However, it is possible to split one stimulation in multiple blocks. Dividing the stimulation in sub-stimulations improves the detection but is more computationally intensive, thus slower and prone to memory errors.\nAdjust the “Smoothing radius” to improve the signal difference between background and foreground, and to reduce scatter noise.\nEnter the value for the “SNR” (signal to noise evaluation) as a number between 0 and 255, indicating the difference in signal between foreground and background.\nNote: it is possible to manually determine the value of the SNR by selecting “Evaluate SNR.” This will prompt the image used to detect the potential location of the DCV fusion events. Run the Fiji “Find Maxima” function with “Preview point selection” and adjust the value of the “prominence” until the majority of puncta are selected without selecting background noise. Close the “Find Maxima” and report the number on the “Evaluate SNR” dialog. The program will then restart.\nIf the “Baseline subtraction” method was selected, insert a desired “Detection threshold” as number of standard deviations above the mean intensity signal. Only pixels with higher intensity values will be considered for ROI placement.",
    "Enter a desired “Cleaning threshold” as number of standard deviations above the mean intensity signal. This threshold is calculated as a rolling standard deviation with the value of “Baseline frames” as window size.\nAdjust the “ROI size” to match the observed size of the DCV fusion events.\nTo avoid multiple detection of the same fusion event, set the “Maximum pxs overlap between ROIs” to be at most 1/3 of the total pixel area.\nEvaluate the outcome of the detection by playing the time-lapse video. To visualize all detected regions, make sure that the “Show All” option in the ROI Manager is selected.\nAdd any missing regions with the “Place ROIs tool;”\nNote: After the initial fusion detection, the program will name the ROI in the format of ROIID-EventStart, where ROIID is a 4 digits identifier which starts at “0000,” and the EventStart is the frame number where the signal rose above the detection threshold. For manually placed events the number corresponds to the frame selected by the user. EventStart can be repeated multiple times.\nRegions can be deleted at this step with “Alt + click” inside a ROI.\nOptional: The user can evaluate each ROI intensity and detection via the “Check ROIs” in the “ROIs Interaction Menu” (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). The program will report the Intensity over Time (in frames), with the start of the DCV fusion event indicated with a red circle. Here the user can adjust the detected frame, remove, or add DCV fusion events.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/454-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. DCV_pHluorin example and result tables",
    "(A) Example Fiji interface after running the detection of DCV fusion events. In red, Fiji main interface. In yellow, the time-lapse window, the arrowhead indicates the currently selected ROI. In light-green the ROI Manager, each ROI is saved as a four digits identifier, an “-” and the fusion start frame number. In dark-green the dialog to modify the current event, from the ROIs Interaction menu > Check ROIs. In light blue the intensity over time plot of the selected ROI, the red circle indicates the start of the fusion event.\n(B) Explanation of the “Vesicle Parameters” result table.\n(C) Explanation of the “Pool Values” result table.\nSave the ROI Manager file via the “Save ROIs” in the “ROIs Interaction Menu.” Alternatively, the intensity of the individual ROIs can be calculated via the “Measure ROIs” function, which will report a comma separated file with the different ROIs as columns and the time-lapse frames as rows. This file can be stored for further use.\nOnce the DCV fusion events are detected and the ROI Manager file is saved, calculate the total number of pHluorin-labeled DCVs by doing the following:\nMake sure that the ROI Manager is open and empty, without any selections on the image;\nOn the “Start Analysis Menu” select “Get NH4 pool.” An option dialog will appear with the same options as in step 15.\nThe important parameters are the “Start of NH4 (frame)” and “SNR.” If the value of the SNR is set to 0, the program will calculate the SNR value based on the intensity during NH4Cl superfusion. Alternatively, it is possible to manually determine the SNR value selecting “Evaluate SNR” as in step 15e.",
    "Evaluate the outcome of the detection by observing both the pHluorin response in the time-lapse, as well as on the “MAX” figure, which is the normalized maximum intensity projection used to detect the pHluorin positive DCVs. The program will automatically save the ROI Manager file and the list of ROI intensities in the same folder as the image file.\nIf synapsin-mCherry was used to identify synapses it is possible to create a synapse mask with the following steps:\nDuplicate the image and invert the gray values, in order to have a black object on white background;\nPerform a morphological opening by applying a minimum filter, a maximum filter, and a Gaussian blur filter of the same radius, preferably of roughly the same size as the synapses in pixels;\nSubtract the morphological opened image from the original and threshold the result using the “Triangle” method from Fiji “Auto threshold;”\nManually inspect the synapse mask and delete any extra objects.\nOnce the detection for all recordings is completed, collect all the data via the “ROIs Frame readers Menu” and select “From Folder.” A dialog will appear asking the “baseline frames” used to calculate the baseline intensity level to estimate the DCV fusion duration, the start of the NH4Cl superfusion, and whether to calculate the “Synaptic location” of the fusion events, and the estimation of the total amount of pHluorin-labeled DCVs (“Pool Estimation”). This will result in a table with one entry per single DCV fusion event, and one table with three estimations of the total DCV pool (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).",
    "Note: During data collection the program will look for the ROI Manager files of the DCV fusion events, then it will automatically calculate the DCV fusion duration and the DCV fusion intensity. If “Synaptic location” was selected, the program will open the synapse mask associated to the time-lapse and calculate the distance between the center of the DCV fusion event to the closest synaptic area. For better performance it is convenient to organize the data so that all time-lapse files and their ROI Manager files are in one single folder. Another folder will contain the NH4Cl response csv files and the associated ROI Manager files, and a third folder with the images of the synapse mask."
