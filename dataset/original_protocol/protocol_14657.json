    "The appropriate institutional animal ethics committee should approve all of the behavioral procedures prior to starting experimentation. All animal work described here was approved by Western University Animal Use Subcommittee and follows the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. These animal experiments were performed during the light phase.\n1. Cylinder Task for Gross Forelimb Motor Assessment\nEquipment Setup\n\t\nAcquire a Plexiglas cylinder with a perforated lid that will accommodate the size of the rat used for the experiment. The size of the cylinder should not allow the rat to reach the top when rearing and it should allow for 2 cm between the wall and the rat's nose and the base of the rat's tail. The standard size of a cylinder is 23 cm in diameter and 40 cm in height for a 6-month-old (400-600 g) rat.\nPlace a mirror at a 45° angle below the cylinder apparatus with the cylinder sitting on a Plexiglas stand or some other form of support approximately 30 cm above table top.\nSet up a video camera on a tripod at an appropriate distance to visualize the entire diameter of the cylinder in the mirror on the video camera.\nTurn lighting to a dimmer setting and play white noise in the room (i.e. low volume, subtle music) to reduce the effect of sudden loud noises. This should help encourage movement and prevent freezing due to loud noises.\nExperimental Procedure\n\t\nMove the rats into the experimental room 30 min before the start of first trial to acclimatize rats to the room with music playing and dimmer lighting.\nWrite the corresponding animal and trial information (i.e. animal number, day in timeline and trial number) on a small white board. Place this board in front of the mirror.",
    "Press record on the video camera with the white board in front of the mirror, pick up the rat near the base of the tail, place the rat in the cylinder and secure the lid. Stand off to the side of the cylinder to avoid interfering with video recording.\nRemove the white board from in front of the mirror and let the video camera record the rat in the cylinder for 5 minutes (use a timer to record 5 min from when the white board is removed). This is one trial.\nClean the cylinder with paper towel and water after a trial.\nRepeat steps 1.2.2-1.2.5 two more times to achieve a total of three trials. There should be a 20-30 min inter-trial time to decrease the chance of habituation to the cylinder. During this time, run cylinder trials for the other rats.\nVideo Analysis\n\t\nImport video camera files into video editing program (i.e. iMovie)\nCompile the videos into clips for each trial. Mute the volume of the video and decrease the speed of the video to 25% of the original.\nCount the number of forelimb contacts with the wall of the cylinder for the left and right forelimb. For simultaneous left and right contacts, count these forelimb contacts as \"both\". Keep in mind that the video is recorded through a mirror, what appears to be the left forelimb in the video corresponds to the animal's right forelimb in reality.\nCalculate the percent use of the affected forelimb (contralateral to the stroke) using the following equation: [{(affected contacts + ½ bilateral contacts)/total number contacts} x 100]. The performance of both wild type groups and the transgenic group without stroke are considered comparison groups to evaluate presentation of disease-induced problems.\n2. Beam-walk Task for Gross Motor Assessment\nEquipment Setup",
    "Acquire a smooth sealed wooden beam that is 2 cm wide and approximately 120 cm long (optimal width for a 200-600 g rat).\nPlace two tables or shelving units 100 cm apart. The surfaces of each unit should be approximately 40 cm above the ground.\nSecure both ends of the beam to the table or shelving surface using tape. Approximately 1 m of unsupported beam length should now be elevated 40 cm above the ground.\nSet up a video camera on a stand, capturing the entire length of the beam. To enhance contrast in the video, consider introducing a black background behind the beam when using white rats.\nExperimental Procedure\n\t\nMove the rats into the experimental room 30 min before the start of first trial to acclimatize rats to the room with music playing and dimmer lighting.\nPlace the rat's home cage or environmental enrichment tubes at one end of the beam and place the rat at the other end of the beam.\nConduct a few non-recorded runs two days prior to experimental trials. Let the rat explore the area and guide the rat toward the beam by holding the base of the rat's tail.\nOnce the rat has crossed the beam, move the cage or tube to the other end of the beam and repeat. When the rat crosses the beam freely in either direction, the training session is over. Keep the number of training runs consistent among all animals.\nWrite the corresponding animal and trial information (i.e. animal number, day in timeline and trial number) on a small white board. Tape this white board to the wall behind the beam.\nPlace the rat's home cage or environment enrichment tubing at one end of the beam.",
    "Press record on the video camera and pick the rat up by the base of the tail and place at the end of the beam opposite to the home cage or tubing.\nRecord the entirety of the trial, which ends when the rat has successfully completed traversing the full length of the elevated beam. If the rat pauses midway across the beam, gently scruff the rat by the base of the tail or touch the rat's tail gently to promote movement across the beam. Do not push the rat forward in any manner.\nRe-do trials where the rat turns sideways while on the beam, repeatedly stops walking or walks inconsistently. If a rat falls and continues to hang on to the beam, gently scoop up the rat and place it back on the beam at the position of the fall and continue the trial.\nMove the home cage or tubing to the other end of the beam, change the trial # on the white board and record the subsequent trial.\nRepeat this procedure until a total of 6 trials have been completed, with 3 trials being recorded for each direction. All 6 trials for a rat can be recorded before starting the trials for the next rat.\nVideo Analysis\n\t\nImport video camera files into video editing program (i.e. iMovie).\nCompile the videos into clips for each trial and mute the volume of the video. Analyze each video clip frame by frame.",
    "Count the number of total steps the rat takes to walk the full length of the beam and the total number of left and right hindlimb and forelimb slips and total number of falls. The performance of both wild type groups and the transgenic group without stroke are considered in comparison to the co-morbid group to evaluate emergence of deficits unique to the co-morbid condition.\n3. Morris Water Maze for Hippocampal-dependent Spatial Learning and Reference Memory\nEquipment Setup\n\t\nSecure a video camera positioned above the center of a circular pool (148 cm diameter and 58 cm depth). Align the four designated quadrants properly with the outline of the pool in the tracking software program.\nFill the circular pool with water approximately 36 cm deep. The water should be warmed to room temperature by filling the pool a few days prior to beginning the experimental protocol.\nAdd black non-toxic acrylic paint until the water is opaque when using white rats. Use a light color, such as white, for darker colored rats.\nSurround the pool with blank wall surfaces, including room dividers if needed. When in the pool, the rat should not be able to see the experimenters.\nCut 4 large different shaped spatial cues from different colors of poster board and attach one shape on the wall per designated north, east, southeast and southwest pool locations. These cues should be slightly higher than the edge of the pool.\nTurn on a radio at low volume in the northwest quadrant to prevent the rat from being distracted by unexpected loud noises during testing.\nPlace a circular platform (11.5 cm diameter, surface 2-3 cm below water level) in the center of the target quadrant.",
    "Turn off main room lights and turn on a floor standing lamp on the opposite side of the room divider to the pool to illuminate the area.\nComputer Configuration\n\t\nUse a tracking program that is designed for Morris water maze behavior tasks and set up protocol prior to starting experiments. An example of a possible program is provided in Figure 4.\nSet 4 consecutive days with 4 trials of 90 sec each for the spatial learning experiment.\nSet 2 separate probe experiments of 30 sec each at 24 hr after the last spatial learning trial and 1 week after the first probe experiment.\nSet cued learning trials at 4 trials per day for 2 consecutive days starting 24 hr after the second probe experiment. Each trial should be 60 sec total.\nFor each stage, set the testing order so that there is a 20 min inter-trial interval between each trial for any given animal. Other animals can be run during this inter-trial interval, as long as every animal maintains a 20 min inter-trial interval.\nEnsure that the platform position is to be defined by the experimenter and that all other zones are defined by the designated platform position.\nSet the program to manually start and end each trial.\nSpatial Learning Experiment\n\t\nPlace the circular platform in the southwest quadrant. It should be aligned with the circular designated \"platform\" area in the quadrant on the computer program.\nStart positions around the pool should be randomized for each rat. Represent all start positions in each treatment group. No rat starts from the northeast position for any spatial learning trials in the paradigm presented  to allow for a novel start position during probe testing.",
    "Hold the rat at the base of its tail and gently place it in the water along the wall of the pool at the designated start position and quickly move out of the rat's sight.\nHave the other experimenter start the tracking software as soon as the rat is in the water. A timer should start counting up from 0 on the tracking program.\nIf the rat locates the platform, have the other experimenter stop the trial on the computer and leave the rat on the platform for at least 30 sec before retrieving it. If the rat jumps off the platform before the trial is stopped on the computer, the trial continues.\nIf the rat does not find the platform in the allotted trial time, guide the rat to the platform using your hand (either making the rat follow your hand or guide the rat by the base of its tail). Hold the rat on the platform for 30 sec.\nRemove the rat from the pool by the base of its tail onto the experimenter's arm that is covered with a towel or let the rat climb onto a portable surface.\nRepeat steps 3.3.3-3.3.7 for a total of 4 trials per rat. There should be an inter-trial interval of 20 min for each rat.\nReturn the rats to their home cage under a heat lamp for at least 10 min following the rat’s final spatial learning trial.\nContinue the exact same spatial learning protocol for day 2 through day 4 of spatial learning.\nOn day 2-4, do not hold the rat on the platform any longer. Allow the rat to sit on the platform without assistance for 30 sec with the experimenters out of sight. This can be done during later trials on day 1 on occasion.\nProbe Experiment",
    "Remove the platform from the pool. Ensure the previous platform position remains defined on the computer (circle in the southwest quadrant).\nPlace the rat in the water along the wall of the pool at the northeast position and quickly move out of the rat's sight. Use of the novel northeast start position ensures that the rat recalls the platform position independent from previously trained start positions.\nHave the other experimenter start the tracking software as soon as the rat is in the water. A timer should start counting up from 0 on the tracking software.\nRetrieve the rat from the southwest quadrant of the pool by the base of its tail and hold on a towel-covered arm or let the rat climb onto a portable surface.\nReturn the rats to their home cage under a heat lamp for at least 10 min following each rat’s probe trial.\nRepeat this experiment (steps 3.4.1-3.4.5) 1 week later.\nCued Learning Experiment\n\t\nUse tape to secure a 4 cm diameter white spherical cue on a stand that is 8.5 cm tall on the platform (total height of cue is 12.5 cm). The top of the spherical cue will be at least 8.5 cm above water level.\nRemove the spatial cues from walls surrounding the pool.\nRandomize platform positions and start positions for each rat in each group. All platform and start positions should be represented for each treatment group.\nPlace platform in the designated platform area and define in the tracking software.\nPlace the rat in the water along the wall of the pool at the designated start position and quickly move out of the rat's sight.",
    "Have the other experimenter start the tracking software as soon as the rat is in the water. A timer should start counting up from 0 on the tracking software.\nOnce the rat reaches the platform, have the other experimenter stop the trial on the computer. If the rat jumps off the platform, the trial continues. Before retrieving the rat, allow the rat to sit on the platform for 15 sec.\nRetrieve the rat from the pool by the base of its tail and hold on a towel-covered arm or let the rat climb onto a portable surface.\nCheck the platform position for the next rat and move the platform into the corresponding area defined in the tracking software.\nRepeat steps 3.5.4-3.5.9 for the following 3 trials. There should be an inter-trial interval of 15 min.\nReturn the rats to their home cage under a heat lamp for at least 10 min following each rat’s final cued learning trial.\nContinue the same protocol for day 2 of cued learning.\nData Analysis\n\tNote: Time spent in zones, distance traveled in zones, average speed, number of entries into zones and the time to first entry into zones are often used.\n\t\nAnalyze the time and distance to reach the platform zone and the average speed per day of spatial and cued learning separately. For probe experiments, analyze the latency to first entry into the target zone as a raw time or a percent change from probe 1 to probe 2.\nSubscription Required.
