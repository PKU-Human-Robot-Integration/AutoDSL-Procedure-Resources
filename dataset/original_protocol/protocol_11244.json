    "The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all participants signed an informed consent form. Briefly, twelve healthy, normotensive, nonsmoking subjects (five men, seven women) aged between 31 and 65 years (mean age = 44 ± 12 years) volunteered to participate in this study. Brown and Gerbarg3 studied meditation and similar breathing techniques in individuals across a broad age range (14 - 85 years of age) for the management of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and overall wellness and lifestyle management.\n1. Participant Selection\nPerform the following for all participants: a telephone screening, a baseline visit (home), a 4-week intervention period, and an endpoint visit (same or similar setting as the baseline visit).\n\t\nArrange telephone screenings with interested volunteers. During the call, determine eligibility by asking questions about medical history and medications.\nSchedule a baseline visit for eligible and interested volunteers (home or similar setting). Deliver consent forms for review before the visit.\n\t\tNOTE: It is well described in the literature that a human undergoing study in a laboratory can be associated with environmental and cognitive stress due to their awareness of being observed (e.g., the Hawthorne effect). One of the primary advantages of the home-based protocol is the ability to minimize the potential impact of foreign environments, such as a clinical or laboratory setting, on the physiological measures. Additionally, investigators may be able to extend research protocols to community-based interventions without having to request participants come to a laboratory.\nArrive at the home or pre-intervention setting and explain the purpose, procedures, risks and discomforts, benefits, confidentiality, and liability of the study both in writing and verbally before participants sign the consent form.\nConfirm inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nHave participant complete the subjective questionnaire on mindfulness10. Equip participant with physiological devices.",
    "Record baseline measurements for 10 min in a comfortable seated posture, for 10 min after the initial intervention, a 10 min baseline after the 4-week intervention, and a 10 min period after the individual completes the breathing and meditation protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: The data collection setting was the same pre- and post-intervention within a given individual. The 10 min data recording periods were stored for further analysis and reported as a 10 min average.\nImmediately after completing the consenting procedures, teach three breathing techniques immediately followed by listening to pre-recorded audio of the 20 min guided relaxation3,11,12. Repeat four times to establish a baseline.\nReport only the final breathing and meditation protocol data as the initial intervention time point. Give all participants a compact disc (CD) with the breathing technique instructions and 20 min guided relaxation audio.\nProvide each person with detailed instructions for the four weeks of self-guided daily breathing techniques and instruct him or her to complete the breathing exercises, along with the 20 min of guided relaxation, each morning for four weeks.\nHave a member of the study team follow up with each person to ensure that the protocol was being followed and to assist with any instructional issues.\nAfter the 4-week intervention period, return to the participant's home to complete the endpoint visit, proceeding in the same manner as the baseline visit. Also, have participants complete the 39-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire.",
    "NOTE: The purpose of this paper was to describe the methodology of the breathing protocol and the use of physiological monitoring in a non-laboratory setting. Investigators utilizing the breath-based meditation stress management protocol and physiological monitoring devices described in this paper may need to employ a control group for internal validity. Previous studies examining the benefit of meditation and controlled breathing have utilized a variety of control groups such as a time-matched aerobic exercise, other meditation practices, biofeedback techniques, serious gaming along with guided meditation yoga routines, and a time control without intervention.\n2. Setup for Research Grade Wireless Electroencephalography (EEG) System\nTo export, evaluate, and analyze the data, provide/equip a personal laptop with a serial port to participants.\n\t\nSet up an EEG Control Panel that allows the user to monitor the status and features of the headset EEG, including facial expressions and emotions13. Data collection will take place in real time, while the subject wears the EEG headset.\nBefore starting the recording of EEG data, switch on the EEG headset and ensure that the battery is fully charged. The device can now be set up for the user.\nBefore recording an EEG session, perform the following steps.\n\t\nHydrate the twelve sensors. Assemble the headset. Thoroughly saturate the felt pads using 0.5% saline solution. When the headset is placed on the scalp, the pads should feel wet.\nPut on the headset. Place the headset on the user's head and make sure that the EEG electrodes make good contact (defined as below five kΩ) on the scalp of the operator. Adjust the headset until each sensor impedance is below five kΩ.",
    "Position the reference sensors to touch the skin behind the ear. It is critical that the reference sensors make contact with the skin behind the ear with a sensor impedance of below five kΩ.\nPlug the dongle into the device's USB port. When a headset is paired, the indicator light should flicker rapidly. If this is not the situation, reinsert the dongle and try again.\nLaunch the software on the laptop.\nTurn on the headset. The power switch is at the rear of the headset. A light indicates when the headset is on.\nVerify signal quality by examining the engine status on the control panel.\n\tNOTE: Because EEG data is being recorded, it is possible to utilize a software platform for additional research quality analysis on emotional states and facial expression13,14,15.\n3. Setup of the Bluetooth-Enabled Pulse Oximeter\nCapture and record the pulse oximetry using a pulse oximeter, attached to a right or left ring finger, which is activated when connected.\n\t\nEnsure that the volunteer is in the upright position with both feet on the floor. Place the hand with the pulse oximeter comfortably on the thigh.\nExpose the interior of pulse oximeter sensor and insert a non-dominant finger. Position the finger so that the fingertip approaches the sensor's end. Close the device gently so that the finger contacts with the sensor pad.\n\tNOTE: Once the portable pulse oximeter is closed on the finger, the device should show heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), perfusion index (PI), and the Pleth variability index (PVI)16,17. HR, RR, PI, and PVI are displayed on the pulse oximeter device and can be displayed via Bluetooth on a smart tablet or computer.\n4. Overview Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire",
    "Note: This questionnaire is available in both paper and electronic format for administration10. The paper form is provided in Appendix A. Each of the five facets are based on a scale of mindfulness from 1 to 5. There is no cutoff score for being mindful or not mindful; rather it is a continuum from low to high. Each of the subscales related to the five facets of mindfulness is below.\nObserve the ability to stay and be present and not be preoccupied with body sensations, feelings, and thoughts on a scale from 1 to 5, with five being the easiest to accomplish this task and one being the most difficult to accomplish this task.\nAssess the ability to define emotions and expectations, past or present on a scale from 1 to 5, with five being the easiest to accomplish this task and one being the most difficult to accomplish this task.\nAssess the ability to stay present with whatever is going on physically or mentally without disturbance, on a scale from 1 to 5, with five being the easiest to accomplish this task and one being the most difficult to accomplish this task.\nAssess the ability to remain nonjudgmental of any past experiences or attempt to cognitively criticize the present experience, on a scale from 1 to 5, with five being the easiest to accomplish this task and one being the most difficult to accomplish this task.\nAssess the ability to recognize the presence of emotions and thoughts without responding to them physically or mentally, on a scale from 1 to 5, with five being the easiest to accomplish this task and one being the most difficult to accomplish this task.\n5. Alternate Nostril Breath Protocol (5 min)",
    "Sit comfortably with the spine erect, the left hand on the left knee and the eyes closed.\nBring the right hand to the face. Place the index and middle fingers between the eyebrows. Place the ring and little fingers gently on the left nostril, and place the thumb on the right nostril.\nTake a deep breath in.\nPress the thumb down on the right nostril to close it off and exhale through the left. Inhale through the left side of the nose.\nAfter that, by pressing the nostril with the ring finger, close that side of the nose. Release the thumb and breathe out through the right side. Then, inhale using the right nostril.\nRepeat 5.4 - 5.5, continually alternating inhalations and exhalations, for 5 min.\nRecognize the presence of emotions and thoughts without responding to them in a physical or mental manner and continue to bring your attention to the air entering and exiting the nose.\n6. Victorious Breath Protocol (5 min)\nSit comfortably with the spine erect.\nTake a long, deep breath in slowly.\nWith the mouth closed, breathe out through the nose, constricting the back of the throat. This mild constriction of the throat creates resistance to the passage of air.\nBreathe in gently, pushing the breath in against the resistance produced by constricting the back of the throat.\nGently inhaling and exhaling slowly and deeply against this constriction at the back of the throat creates a soothing sound like ocean waves rising and falling.\nContinue this breathing cycle for 5 min while in a seated posture.\nRecognize the presence of emotions and thoughts without responding to them physically or mentally and continue to bring your attention to the air entering and exiting the nose.\n7. Bellows Breath Protocol (5 min)\nSit up tall with relaxed shoulders.",
    "Breathe in slowly and deeply through the nose.\nBreath in and out from the nose with the eyes closed.\nFlex the arms to bring elbows close to the rib cage and loose fists close to the shoulders.\nWith active inhalation, raise the arms up above the head while opening the fists.\nWith vigorous exhalation, bring the arms down to bring the elbows close to the rib cage and the fists by the shoulders.\nRepeat steps 7.1 to 7.3 consecutively 15 to 20 times, making one set.\nDo 3 sets with a pause of 10 to 15 s between each set.\n8. Guided Relaxation Body Scan (8 - 10 min)\nNOTE: Read these instructions to the participants: \"The purpose of this guided relaxation is to bring the attention to different areas of the body and may assist with better awareness of physical sensations in various areas of the body. Drawing attention to various regions of the body trains the mind to be more attentive to these feelings.\"\nHave a seat in a comfortable chair or the floor and after 15 seconds close the eyes. Be sure that the environment is safe, quiet, and free of distractions.\nObserve how the mind and body are feeling right now. Observe any sensations in the body or any thoughts in mind. Continue to notice how the body is feeling and observe any thoughts on the mind.\nStart to scan the body: With the eyes closed, mentally scan the body. Remember to take a deep breath in and let it go periodically. Recognize the presence of emotions and thoughts without responding to them physically or mentally and continue to bring your attention to the air entering and exiting the nose.",
    "Start scanning with the right foot; move to the right leg and right hip. Repeat scanning with the left foot, leg, and hip. Move slowly through each part of the body. Repeat this again starting with the right side and moving to the left side.\nContinue scanning the body by moving slowly to the stomach, the left aspect of the body, the right aspect of the body, the upper to the lower back and finally to the chest, starting at the neck and moving down to the stomach.\nContinue to mentally scan the left hand, left arm and left shoulder; continue by examining the right hand, right arm, and right shoulder.\nSlowly scan the head, starting with the face and moving to the neck, back of the head, and top of the head.\nObserve any tension in the body and bring the mental attention to that region and rescan it.\nFinally, before opening the eyes, take a moment to observe thoughts, feelings, and sensations. What are the thoughts right now about the body scan? Try not to judge the scan; just observe the breath and body.\nTake one final deep breath in, hold it for 4 seconds and let it go. Now slowly open the eyes.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
