    "1. Cell Maintenance\nMany bone metastatic subclones of MDA-MB-231 exist that have variable propensity for bone colonization and growth. For our experiments we use a clone derived from the GFP-tagged MDA-MB-231 developed at UTHSCA 2. This particular sub-clone will form visible osteolytic bone lesions at approximately 3 weeks post inoculation, with sacrifice at 4 weeks.\nMaintain cells in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.1 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5-8% CO27.\nPassage cells at 80-90% confluence and re-plate at a 1:10 dilution (this varies depending on cell type and the size plate. For MDA-MB-231 cells in a T-75 this is approximately 6x105), which is approximately every 72 hr.\nMDA-MB-231 cells maintain a generally fibroblastic appearance with numerous pseudopodia. Any rounding is indicative of overcrowding or other undesirable stress, and should be avoided since this may affect metastatic potential in vivo.\nIdeally, cells should be maintained in culture only briefly before inoculation (we recommend less than 1 wk or until you have enough cells for the experiment), and a new vial should be thawed if rounding or changes in cell growth rate occur.\n2. Cell Preparation\nTrypsinize cells at 80-90% confluence with 0.15% Trypsin/EDTA (dilute 0.5% Gibco Trypsin EDTA 1:2 in PBS). This concentration allows for fast detachment (<2 min) and reduces clumping of the cells.\nImmediately remove cells from plate with 10 ml ice-cold DMEM containing 10% FBS, pipette into 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend pellet in a 50 ml conical tube in 25 ml ice-cold PBS (without Ca and Mg) and count.",
    "Centrifuge to re-pellet, and resuspend at 106 cells per ml (intracardiac) or at 250,000 cells/10 μl (intratibial) in ice-cold PBS. The temperature of PBS is important to prevent clumping of cells and subsequent embolism after injection. The cell suspension should remain on ice while performing injections and will be viable and remain un-clumped for 30 min. While the exact number of plates required will vary from investigator to investigator, we generally use 1 T-75 for between 8-10 mice.\n3. Intracardiac Inoculation\n4-6 week old female (Foxn nu-/-: Harlan) mice are used for these experiments, though other immune-compromised mice (RAG1-/-, RAG2-/-, SCID, XID, and etc.) can also be used with human cancer cell experiments.\nThe nude mice should be fed Teklad 2920x diet 5-10 days before injection to decrease mortality from the injection procedure, and reduce background fluorescence in imaging procedures (since the food is alfalfa free).\nIf using mice other than nu/nu, remove hair by shaving or using Nair (in our experience Nair works better) on ventral abdominal area before beginning procedure.\nAnesthetize mouse in an isolation chamber using an isoflurane vaporizer (2.5% Iso: 2-3 L/min O2) or other preferred anesthesia (in our experience isoflurane is the best tolerated for intracardiac inoculations).\nMove one mouse at a time to the nose cone of the anesthesia machine inside a stainless steel ventilated hood.\nPosition each mouse on its back with chest facing up.\nWash the chest with a 10% povidone/iodine swab/solution followed by 70% ethanol, repeating 2 times.",
    "Mark mouse's chest for injection (using a sterile marker or marking slightly to the side to keep the injection site sterile). We use a mark location midway between the sternal notch and top of xyphoid process, and slightly left (anatomical) of the sternum. Draw a small bubble of air into syringe to create space between the plunger and meniscus (important for seeing cardiac pulse) of a 300 μl 28 g ½ insulin syringe, and draw up 100 μl of cells.\nKeep needle upright. While holding skin of mouse taut with other hand, insert needle.\nSuccessful insertion into left cardiac ventricle should result in a distinct bright red pulse of blood in the syringe. At this depth, carefully depress plunger of syringe (100 μl volume), without significant movement of the needle to avoid puncturing the heart or spilling cells into the chest cavity.\nAfter cells are injected, pull up slightly on plunger to create a small amount of negative pressure to reduce dripping of cells into the chest cavity.\nPull needle directly out of chest while being sure to avoid tilting the needle during removal, which can tear the lining of the heart and cause bleeding.\nApply gentle pressure to the chest over the injection site to reduce bleeding.\nRemove mouse from the nose cone and continue to apply light pressure for about 1 min.\nMove mouse to heating pad until fully conscious.",
    "If mouse begins to spin or twitch after recovery, the likely cause is an embolism. Inject mouse intraperitonally with 80-120 mg/kg of ketamine to increase blood flow and cardiac output while decreasing vascular resistance. This should help the mouse pass the clot. After this occurs, it is best to change cell preparations, as it indicates that the cells are clumping. We change cell preparations after approximately 8 mice, or 30 min.\n4. Intratibial\nInject mouse with Buprenex (0.1 mg/kg) or similar approved analgesic immediately before procedure.\nAnesthetize mouse using isoflurane, then move to nose cone and maintain anesthesia.\nClean both legs with 10% povidone/iodine swab/solution, followed by ethanol, repeating 2 times. Depilate legs (with Nair or similar product) prior to cleaning if fur present.\nGently grasp lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, and lower half of tibia with forefinger and thumb, then bend leg (combination of flexion and lateral rotation, such that the knee is visible and accessible.\nWet the skin with 70% EtOH to increase visibility of underlying patellar ligament, which should be visible as a distinct, thick, white line. While firmly grasping ankle/leg of mouse insert 28g ½ needle under patella, through the middle of patellar ligament, and into the anterior intercondylar area in top of tibia.\nWhen inserting needle into tibia, guide carefully through growth plate using steady, firm pressure with slight drilling action.\nUpon penetration of tibial growth plate, the needle will encounter markedly less resistance.\nUse a gentle, lateral movement of needle to ensure needle is in tibia and through the growth plate. Movement will be limited if needle is in proper place within tibia.\nSlowly depress plunger to inject 10 μl of cell solution. Little to no resistance should be felt at this point.\nSlowly extract needle.",
    "Following the same procedure, proceed to next leg to inject 10 μl of PBS.\nRemove mouse from anesthesia and keep on heating pad until recovered.\nMonitor the mice over the next 24 hr and inject with additional Buprenex every 12 hr if animals continue to show signs of distress.\n5. Imaging Time Course\nLuciferase Imaging: Where applicable, luciferase imaging should be utilized beginning at 7 days post-tumor cell inoculation (though in most bone metastasis models, detectable closer to day 14). Mouse is injected intraperitoneally with 150 mg/kg luciferin, anesthetized, and imaged 8 min after injection using IVIS equipment 8.\nGFP imaging: Typically GFP-expressing tumors begin to be detectable around day 10-14 for intratibial injections and 16-21 for intracardiac experiments using Maestro imaging equipment (CRi) 9. Briefly, mice are anesthetized with isoflurane (3%) and maintained under anesthesia through a nose cone in the Maestro imaging chamber. For our eGFP-expressing cells we use the blue filter set (498 excitation/515 emission for eGFP) at 500 ms exposure in 10 nm steps.\nFaxitron (X-ray): X-rays are taken weekly starting between day 7 to 14. Lesions will be visible in the intracardiac model at day 21 and a week earlier in the intratibial injections3. Our radiographic data for ex vivo and in vivo was acquired using a Faxitron LX-60 at 35 kV for 8 seconds of exposure.\nOther Imaging: Imaging modalities will be entirely based upon the specific research. In addition to the above methods, live animal imaging based on 3D micro-computed tomography (μCT), micro-positron emission tomography (μPET), and other modalities 10,11 can provide valuable information.\n6. Mouse Sacrifice\nEach model has a slightly different time course. With MDA-MB-231 cells mice usually become cachectic or paraplegic between 21 and 35 days and usually around day 28 (IT injected mice between 21-28 days).",
    "Once several mice develop lesions that begin to break through the cortical bone, become paraplegic, or lose between 10-20% of body weight, sacrifice all mice in study using ketamine/xylazine overdose with cervical dislocation (or other IACUC approved method).\nRemove bones needed for further study and store in buffered 4% formalin.\nMice with chest tumors are a sign of a missed injection and should be excluded from the study.\n7. Ex Vivo Analysis\nμCT: scanning in 70% EtOH allows for structural and histological parameters to be measured on the same bone specimen.\nContour and analyze according to individual experimental design and available equipment10. Our data was obtained with a Scanco μCT 40 using 12 μM resolution.\nHistomorphometry: Process specimens using preferred histological methods and stain with Hematoxylin/Eosin7\n8. Representative Results",
    "Following intracardiac or intratibial inoculation of tumor cells (Figure 1) mice are monitored weekly by radiography and fluorescence (or luminescence). Lesions normally become apparent by x-ray between week 2 and 3, while they may be visible by fluorescence and luminescence as early as week 2, depending on the model (Figure 2). Lesions are visible as dark holes in the bone, and become more pronounced with time (Figure 3). Lesions were quantified using Metamorph analysis of radiographs and fluorescence was quantified using Maestro (CRi) imaging acquisition and analysis software. As lesions begin to grow, mice frequently become cachectic. Sacrifice is required when mice have lost between 10-20% of their initial body weight. The condition of the mice can change rapidly and must be monitored multiple times during the day. Between 3-4 weeks mice began to drag one or both hind limbs and the entire study was sacrificed. Images were taken prior to sacrifice. After anesthesia overdose, blood was collected to measure markers of bone turnover or other factors. After cervical dislocation, the skin was stripped from the mouse and bones excised and cleaned for ex vivo imaging (Figure 3) which will allow visualization of tumor foci at least 7 days earlier than in vivo imaging techniques. Once imaging was completed bones were placed in labeled cassettes and stored in formalin for fixation and further histological processing or μCT analysis. Histomorphometry was performed on the samples to indicate the tumor burden and BV/TV after μCT was performed on a tibia to quantify the amount of bone destruction (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4260/4260fig1.jpg",
