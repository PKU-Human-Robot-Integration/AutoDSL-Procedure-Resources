    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nClinical sample collection\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes the procedure of collecting clinical samples for single-cell sequencing.\nInstitutional approval and informed consent need to be in place before the usage of any clinical samples. In this protocol, the collected specimen can be obtained by surgical resection or core needle biopsy of the neurofibroma.\nBiospecimen collection from patient neurofibroma.\nResected tumor may be obtained from a debulking surgery.\nThe surgically removed tumor comes from the operation room in a sterile container.\nOpen the sterile container a laminar flow hood within the procurement suite.\nApply pathology ink to the biospecimen to better visualize tumor margins.\nMeasure the three-dimensional size of the inked specimen with a ruler and record the measurements.\nCut open the biospecimen lengthwise in the middle.\nRemove one 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm3 cube of tissue from one side and immediately place in DMEM in a 15 mL conical tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2683-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of tissue processing to achieve single-cell suspension from fresh nerve sheath tumor\n(A) Example NF1-associated nerve sheath tumor obtained from the operation room.\n(B) Picture of an inked and transected tumor with a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm3 cube of tissue acquired from the tumor.\n(C) Picture of minced tumor with the presence of Tissue Dissociation Media in a petri dish.\n(D) Picture of a c-tube that can be used on a gentleMACSTM dissociator. This tube can be directly placed in the incubator for shaking and enzymatic dissociation.\nIf the specimen is a core needle biopsy obtained for diagnostic purposes.\nObtain the ultrasound-guided biopsy from the area-of-interest by proceduralists in the Intervention Radiology department.\nOnce a core needle biopsy is obtained, immediately place the biospecimen in DMEM in a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Optional: Multi-regional sampling may be necessary if there is grossly visible heterogeneity (regional coloring or texture of the resected tumor) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that significant heterogeneity exists within the same tumor. Process the samples from different regions of the same tumor separately in the following steps.\nCritical: It is important to keep appropriate labeling and annotation for each specimen throughout the procedure. Pictures and annotations should be properly documented.\nGenerating single-cell suspensions of nerve sheath tumor\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes how to use enzymatic dissociation to generate a single-cell suspension of nerve sheath tumors.\nDissection of the biospecimen and curation of resected tumor\nSpray the outside of the conical tube with 70% ethanol and open it under a laminar flow hood. The tissue will be processed in the hood.\nTransfer the biospecimen to a 60 mm cell culture plate. Using sterile surgical scalpel and tweezers, dissect the tumor into pieces of 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2683-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of the workflow of NF1-associated nerve sheath tumor processing from the surgical suite to the laboratory\nFix one piece of the biospecimen in 10% buffered formalin solution at 25°C for a maximum of 24 h before transferring to 80% alcohol.\nNote: Process this piece for the paraffin embedded tissue block. This piece can be used for downstream validation experiments.\nPlace two to three pieces individually in Eppendorf tubes and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nNote: Store these pieces at −80°C. They may be used for bulk sequencing or other experiments.\nMince the remaining tumor into 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm3 pieces in the cell culture plate.\nCritical: When processing a core needle biopsy, no dissection or curation is needed. Directly transfer the biopsy biospecimen into a c-tube for enzymatic dissociation.",
    "Enzymatic dissociation\nFor each sample to be dissociated, prepare 10 mL of complete Tumor Dissociation Media.\nUse a 10 mL serological pipette to add the Tumor Dissociation Media to the minced tumor and transfer them to a c-tube (Miltenyi).\nPlace the c-tube on the gentleMACS™ dissociator and run “hTumor_2.1” twice.\nShake the c-tube at 37°C for up to 40 min at 200 rpm.\nCritical: To process a core need biopsy sample, reduce the incubation time for enzymatic dissociation in step 4d to 20 min.\nPlace the c-tube on the gentleMACS™ dissocator and run “hTumor_3.1” twice.\nPlace a 40 μm cell strainer on a 50 mL conical tube under the laminar flow hood.\nUse a 10 mL serological pipette to agitate the dissociated sample in the tube under the hood to agitate the tumor into single-cell suspension.\nTransfer the suspension in the c-tube (dissociated sample may contain small pieces of tumor chunk) onto the cell strainer.\nUse the plunger from a 10 mL syringe to push the tumor chunks on the cell strainer.\nRinse the cell strainer with 10 mL DMEM twice. The filter-through will contain ∼ 30 mL of dissociated tumor cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2683-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Illustration of using cell strainer to ensure the generation of single-cell suspension\n(A) Picture of the setup of a 40 μm cell strainer on an opened 50 mL conical tube.\n(B) After using a syringe plunger to mechanically force the remaining tissue chunks through the cell strainer, there should be minimal residual of tissue on the cell strainer.\nAdd 60 μL of sterile 0.5 M EDTA solution into the filter-through single-cell suspension and mix by inverting the tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 g for 5 min to collect the cell pellet.",
    "Critical: Always add EDTA to the single-cell suspension to a final concentration of 1 mM before spinning the cells to prevent aggregation.\nUsing a 10 mL serological pipette, carefully remove all but 0.5 mL of the media. Resuspend the cell pellet.\nCount the cells using Acridine Orange/Propidium Iodide (AO/PI) fluorescent dye by mixing 20 μL cell suspension with 20 μL dye (Nexcelom) and loading 20 μL of the mixture to the disposable slide (Nexcelom).\nInsert the slide into the chamber of a fluorescent cell counter.\nNote: Cellometer Auto 2000 was used in this study but other automatic cell counter or manual counting using a hemocytometer can also be used.\nNote: Live cells fluoresce green fluorescent and dead cells fluoresce orange fluorescent.\nNote: The automatic cell counter counts the number of green fluorescent cells as live cells and the number of orange fluorescent cells as dead cells.\nCalculate the cell concentration in the single-cell suspension using a dilution factor of 2.\nWash the cells with 20 mL of DMEM and repeat steps l-p.\nDetermine the cell concentration and viability again using AO/PI dye and a fluorescent cell counter (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2683-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example of cell count and viability determined by AO/PI staining on a fluorescent cell counter\n(A) Bright field image. Note that the “string”-shaped cells are neoplastic Schwann cells isolated from a NF1-associated nerve sheath tumor.\n(B) Fluorescent image showing live nucleated cells stained by Acridine Orange (green) and dead nucleated cells stained with Propidium Iodide (orange). Scale bar = 200 μm.\nAdjust the cell concentration to be in the range of 700–1200 live cells per microliter in DMEM before proceeding to the single-cell sequencing.\nProcess the cells immediately for single-cell capture.",
    "Critical: The success of the downstream single-cell RNA sequencing depends on good preparation of single-cell suspension with the viability above 70% and devoid of cell debris and dead cells.\nOptional: If a gentleMACS™ dissociator is not available in the lab, use a 10 mL serological pipette to mix and agitate the minced tumor in Tumor Dissociation Media.\nOptional: If significant amount of red blood cells exists in the sample, which will appear pink in the cell pellet, add 10 mL ACK lysing buffer to the resuspended cells after step 4m and incubate the sample at room temperature for 5 minutes, followed by PBS wash twice.\nOptional: If the cell viability is less than 60%, an optional dead cell removal step maybe added after step 4p. Commercially available dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec) has been used and proved to be successful in enrichment of live cells. Be cautious that up to 50% of total cell loss should be expected using the dead cell removal kit.\nOptional: It is possible to increase the content of Schwann cells in the dissociated single-cell suspension without affecting the downstream single-cell sequencing. We have previously identified that CD56 (encoded by NCAM1) is a unique cell surface marker expressed by mouse14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] and human1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Schwann cells. Using a CD56 antibody-based selection kit (STEMCELL), it is possible to enrich for Schwann cells isolated from the tumor for downstream single-cell sequencing.\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing using the 10x platform\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis step describes the procedure for 3′ gene expression profiling of single cells including single-cell capture using 10x chromium platform, library preparation and sequencing. The recommended user guide “CG000315_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3-_GeneExpression_v3.1_DualIndex__RevE.pdf” is followed.\nSingle-cell capture.",
    "Count the cells again using fluorescent automated cell counter to determine viability and concentration before loading the cells on to a NextGEM chip for single-cell capture.\nIf necessary, adjust the cell concentration to be in the range of 700–1200 live cells/μL by diluting or concentrating the cells from previous step.\nCount the cells one more time to check the cell concentration and viability just before loading.\nLoad the cells with the target recovery of 6000 cells per capture lane.\nNote: For most tumors processed in this project, two capture lanes per tumor sample are used, targeting 12,000 cells per tumor sample.\nCritical: Make sure not to introduce air bubbles while loading the cell suspension and other reagents into the wells.\nCritical: Before loading the cells for capture, make sure to check the viability and concentration of the samples one more time.\nLibrary preparation.\nAfter the GEM generation, check the consistency and volume of the GEMs.\nNote: If the quality of the GEMs is not as expected, for example (1) low volume of GEMs is observed, (2) GEMs appear less cloudy, or (3) transparent liquid is observed instead of the cloudy GEMs, it indicates either a wetting failure or partial emulsification has occurred.\nCritical: It is necessary to repeat the capture if the quality of the GEMs is not as expected. Before loading the cells for recapture, make sure to completely resuspend and count the cells again.\nCritical: After GEM formation, pay close attention to the volume, opacity, and consistency of the GEM for a clog or possible wetting failures.\nProceed to GEM-RT incubations immediately after GEM generation.\nSafe pause point: store the tubes at 4°C for up to 72 h or at −20°C for up to a week.",
    "Process the GEMs through GEM recovery, cleanup with Dynabeads, and prepare the cDNA.\nSafe pause point: store the cDNA at 4°C for up to 72 h or at −20°C for up to 4 weeks.\nCheck the quality and concentration of cDNA using one of the following quantification methods: Bioanalyzer, TapeStation, or Labchip.\nNote: The quality and concentration of the cDNA provide some insights about the progress of the assay and helps for troubleshooting later if needed.\nContinue with final library preparation from cDNA that includes fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing, adaptor ligation, size selection using SPRIselect beads and sample index PCR.\nSafe pause point: store the final library at 4°C for up to 72 h.\nAfter the completion of sample index PCR, perform one additional round of size selection using SPRIselect beads.\nSafe pause point: store the tubes at 4°C for up to 72 h or at −20°C for long-term storage.\nCheck the quality and concentration of the final library with a Bioanalyzer, TapeStation, or Labchip.\nCritical: Pay close attention to the size distribution and concentration of the final library and the size of the adaptor dimer peak.\nSequencing.\nThe Final 3′ gene expression dual indexed libraries are standard Illumina paired end constructs.\nNote: Read 1 is 28 base pare (bp) long which encodes 16 bp 10x cell barcode and 12 bp unique molecule index (UMI). Read 2 is 90 bp long which contains the cDNA fragment that is later aligned to the reference genome to indicate the expressed RNA. The sample index sequences, i5 and i7, are 10 bp long each. They allow the pooling of several 10x cDNA libraries for sequencing.\nCalculate the molarity of the libraries using the concentration and the size of the final library.",
    "Prepare 2 nM library for each cDNA library, pool the 2 nM libraries from multiple 10x cDNA libraries and re-check the molarity.\nDilute the pooled libraries to 1 nM as the final loading concentration.\nNote: The final loading concentration is dependent on the type of Illumina sequencer used, and it needs to be optimized for each sequencer.\nSequence the pooled libraries using an Illumina sequencer.\nWhen sequencing multiplexed 10x libraries, perform an initial shallow sequencing run to normalize the libraries so that each library will be sequenced at a similar molarity.\nCritical: The flow cell to use for running the libraries depend on the number of multiplexed libraries and the number of cells targeted. For example, for five multiplexed libraries and each with a target of approximately 6000 cells, the sequencing depth will be: 50,000 reads × 6000 cells × 5 libraries = 1.5 billion reads. NovaSeq S2 flow cell will yield approximately 1.3–1.6 billion single-end reads.\nPause point: According to the manufacturer’s protocol, safe pause points are available after the fresh single-cell suspension has been captured at steps 6b, 6c, 6e, and 6f.\nCritical: The time to complete this step varies based on the number of samples. The more samples captured and to be sequenced, the longer it will take to complete this step. One to two weeks are sufficient to process a typical 2 lanes of single-cell capture from one tumor sample.\nIntegrative data analysis, marker genes identification, and cell type annotation\nTiming: 24 h\nThis step describes how to perform basic integrative analysis, marker gene identification and cell type annotations of single-cell RNAseq data generated from NF1 nerve sheath tumors.\nUse the standard 10x Genomics cellranger (version 6.0.0) pipeline to extract fastq files and to perform data processing.",
    "Demultiplex the raw base call files (BCL) generated by the Illumina sequencer into fastq files using cellranger mkfastq.\nRun cellranger count pipeline for alignment to the reference genome (refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A), filtering, barcode and UMI counting.\nApply SoupX7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] to the count matrix of each capture lane to correct the ambient RNA contamination in the data.\nLoad the count matrix generated from cellranger.\nManually specify the contamination fraction to 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%.\nGenerate corrected count matrix to be used in downstream analysis.\nVisually examine the expression of known markers of each cell type generated from using each contamination fraction. For example, B cell marker CD79B should be expressed in B cells but not the other cell types.\nOnce a desired contamination fraction is determined, use this contamination fraction to generate the corrected count matrix to be used in the next step.\nApply Scrublet8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] to the SoupX-corrected read count matrix for the prediction of doublets in the data.\nBased on the number of cells captured per capture lane, a predicted doublet rate is calculated as the following:\nP\nr\ne\nd\ni\nc\nt\ne\nd\nd\no\nu\nb\nl\ne\nt\nr\na\nt\ne\n(\n%\n)\n=\nn\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\no\nf\nc\ne\nl\nl\ns\nc\na\np\nt\nu\nr\ne\nd\n10000\n×\n0.8\nUse the calculated predicted doublet rate on a per capture lane basis in function scr.Scrublet in Scrublet. This step will define the expected_doublet_rate.\nRemove marked doublets before advancing to the next step in this data analysis pipeline.\nUse Seurat15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] for the integrative analysis of data from multiple captures to correct for potential batch effect.\nRemove cells with low quality (nFeature_RNA < 500, nFeature_RNA > 6000, or percent of mitochondrial gene fraction > 20%).",
    "Normalize corrected gene counts using the “LogNormalize” method with the scale.factor set to 10000.\nCalculate the top 3000 most variable genes using the method “vst”.\nAssign the cell cycle identity of each cell using the function CellCycleScoring.\nIdentify anchors using the FindIntegrationAnchors function with the setting “dims = 1:40”.\nApply anchor-based reciprocal principal component analysis (rPCA)16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] to integrate data from different capture lanes.\nScale the data with the unwanted source of variations regressed out (\"percent.mt\", \"nCount_RNA\", \"nFeature_RNA\", \"S.Score\", \"G2M.Score\").\nUtilize the standard dimensional reduction for the clustering analysis using the RunPCA (npcs = 40), RunUMAP (reduction = “pca”, dims = 1:40), FindNeighbors (reduction = “pca”, dims = 1:40), and FindClusters (resolution = 0.8) functions in Seurat.\nIdentify cluster biomarkers by finding the differentially expressed genes in each cluster with comparison to all other clusters, using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat with the setting “only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25” to derive the most highly expressed marker genes of each cluster.\nManually annotated cell types based on the identified marker genes in each cluster.\nOptional: Several other R-based or Python-based tools are available for integrative analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Users may choose any suitable bioinformatic tools for these steps.\nOptional: Instead of manually specifying a contamination fraction, the function autoEstCont can be used in SoupX to automatically identify a desired contamination fraction (rho).\nBuilding a normal Schwann cell developmental trajectory\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis step describes how to build a normal Schwann cell developmental transcriptional trajectory using publicly available single-cell RNAseq data. All source code used in this step can be found on: https://github.com/vishakagopalan/nf_hackathon[href=https://github.com/vishakagopalan/nf_hackathon].\nData download and processing.\nIdentify publicly available single-cell RNAseq data obtained from mouse normal developing Schwann cells. Download the read count matrices of the following data from GEO database.",
    "Obtain data of neural crest stem cells at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) from GSE129114.\nObtain data of Schwann cell precursors at E12.5 and E13.5 from GSE150150.\nObtain data of mature myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells from adult mice from GSE142541.\nOptional: Emerging single-cell RNAseq datasets of neural crest stem cells, Schwann cell precursors, as well as other developing and differentiated Schwann cell subtypes are available to be integrated. These datasets can also be used to build the normal Schwann cell developmental trajectory.\nUse published cell-type annotations for GSE129114 (Table S9 in source publication) and GSE142451.\nFor GSE150150, perform batch correction and clustering using the default parameters in Seurat, and identify annotated cell types based on marker genes employed in the source publication.\nMerge all datasets together in Seurat.\nUse the library size (sequencing depth in each cell), cell cycle status, and batch as co-variates to estimate the p-value of differential expression for each gene.\nTrajectory analysis in Monocle3.\nDown-sampling of reads from datasets that contain a much larger library sizes is required.\nNote: Among the three datasets that we use in this study, GSE129114 and GSE150150 are downsampled to match the library size distribution of cells in GSE142541.\nUse Monocle3 to construct a trajectory from the merged data.\nMerge the three datasets after the down-sampling.\nPerform batch correction using the internal function of Monocle3.\nUse E9.5 neural tube cells as the root state of the trajectory (these cells will be assigned a pseudotime value of 0) to compute pseudotime values of the remaining cells.\nRegulon analysis in SCENIC.\nRegulons are defined as a target gene set for each transcription factor, active in each developing cell type, based on the presence of binding sites within 10 kilobases of the transcription starting site of expressed genes.",
    "Retain transcription factors whose mean regulon activity is higher than 0.03 in at least one of the cell types for future analysis.\nDetermine markers of developing Schwann cells using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat.\nCompute cell cycle status (G2M, S, or G1 phase scores) using AddModuleScore.\nNote: The cell cycle status of each cell is considered as co-variates for determining the p-values of the log-fold changes of each differentially expressed gene.\nComparative analysis between neoplastic Schwann cell and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell\nTiming: 6 h\nThis step describes how to transcriptionally project the neoplastic Schwann cells onto the normal Schwann cell developmental trajectory. All source code used in this step can be found on: https://github.com/vishakagopalan/nf_hackathon[href=https://github.com/vishakagopalan/nf_hackathon].\nCompute at most 300 signature genes of each cell type.\nNote: Signature genes of the developing Schwann cells are markers of each cell type from step 16 that have an adjusted p-value of less than 0.1.\nComparison between Schwann cells and MPNST malignant cells.\nDerive marker genes of neoplastic Schwann cells and MPNST malignant cells from the integrative analysis of patient nerve sheath tumors in step 12. Specifically, using the function FindMarkers with the setting (only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25), derive the most highly expressed marker genes in both malignant and Schwann cells.\nAs part of the function of SCENIC package, score the activity of each of the signature gene sets (signature genes derived from step 15) in each cell using the AUCell function.\nCompare the AUCell activities of each developmental Schwann cell types between malignant MPNST cells and Schwann cells from the patient MPNST single-cell dataset using two-sided Wilcoxon test."
