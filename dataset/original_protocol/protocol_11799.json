    "The following training paradigm employs the analysis of phase adjustments of the average adult Sprague-Dawley rat. Please ensure that the protocol described herein is in accordance with your institutional animal care guidelines. All procedures in this study were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and Office for Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) at West Virginia University School of Medicine and abides by the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals.\n1. Equipment Setup\nConstruct the asymmetric walkway as an open-top plastic box braced with aluminum supports at each corner measuring 155 cm x 104 cm (Figure 1). Brace the top edges of the box with aluminum bars grooved on both sides to allow for alternate peg placement, along the perimeter of the box, so that each consecutive peg on the same side defines the stride length.\nPlace a 20 cm x 20 cm platform on each corner (four total) separating the conditions represented on each side. This distance should be sufficient for the inclusion of the distance traversed by a single rat step cycle.\n\t\nUse pegs made of aluminum with dimensions of 20 cm x 1 cm x 0.5 cm. Bend the top of each peg 2.5 cm from the tip to produce a foot placement platform.\nSecure the pegs to the grooved bars using sliding inside brackets through machined holes at the same distance to ensure level horizontal placement. Adjust positions using a screwdriver and a ruler. Use a 1 cm peg width that corresponds approximately to the average rat paw size; thinner or wider pegs are either uncomfortable or increase the foot placement variability.\nManipulate the peg placement on each side to produce one of three precise stepping challenge conditions.",
    "Produce a symmetric locomotor task with a 15 cm stride length (SL15) by setting the left inter-stride length (lISL) and right inter-stride length (rISL) to the half of stride length (7.5 cm).\nImpose an additional symmetric condition (SL12) by changing lISL and rISL lengths to 6.0 cm.\nProduce the asymmetric tasks by changing the distance between pegs on the left and right sides, termed the inter-stride length. To challenge the motor system asymmetrically, change the lISL and rISL by 20% to impose short inter-stride lengths either on the left (L6R9 condition) or on the right (L9R6) side. The 1.5 cm perturbations impose an lISL of 6 cm and rISL of 9 cm for the L6R9 condition, or an lISL of 9 cm and a rISL of 6 cm for the L9R6 condition\nFor rats, keep the stride length for all conditions except for SL12 at a preferred 15 cm.\nFor convenience, assign each long side of the walkway an asymmetric condition favoring either the left or the right side of the subject, while reserving the two short sides for the symmetric control condition.\nSetup a high definition camera with a sampling rate of at least 60 Hz so that the placement of limbs on pegs is unobstructed with camera pointing perpendicularly to the walkway with the field of view covering about 7 steps. The first and last steps in proximity to platforms are ignored.\n2. Training on Apparatus\nPlease use standard training resources, e.g., NIH Training in Basic Biomethodology for Laboratory Rats, to familiarize with general behavioral training of rodents.",
    "In the beginning of training, acclimate subjects by placing and rewarding them on the 20 x 20 cm platform for at least 5 min. Then, guide the animals across a peg arrangement with a 1 cm inter-stride length to the next platform by the presentation of a food reward. Reward animals verbally and with petting for reaching the platform.\nAfter 5 training runs, space the pegs an extra 1 - 2 cm apart and perform the next 5 training runs. The number of repetitions listed herein is sufficient to produce statistically appropriate sample size (20 - 35 steps).\n\t\nIf the animal acquires the task more slowly as judged by consistency of stepping (no stopping) and posture (arched back), then focus training on the strengthening of these skills at the short stride lengths (S12) before resuming training on the long strides (S15) eventually approaching the desired stride length.\nIf the new spacing induces anxiety or discomfort with the task, readjust the pegs to the previous setting and repeat the training paradigm.\nProceed with this training until the appropriate inter-stride lengths are achieved for the four conditions and locomotor standards are met. In our experience, the rats respond well to vocal encouragement as cues for initiating a trial. The testing can be done on the same day as training provided the subjects are motivated to perform the task.\n\t\tNote: The locomotor standards are as follows: walking is consistent and does not involve stops or missteps; head-bobbing is minimal; the back is arched and the tail is raised during locomotion; each limb is clearly visible from an orthogonal view of the walkway at the onset and offset of the stance phase. This selection process is essential as the present study focuses only on walking rather than other gaiting behavior.",
    "3. Testing and Data Analysis\nTest animals on S12, S15, L9R6, and L6R9 tasks (described in section 1.3) using randomized session design. Use breaks to avoid adaptation within a task.\nRecord sessions with high definition camera with a sampling rate of at least 60 Hz. Import video recordings without re-sampling into video editing software and select only the walking bouts for further analysis.\nMark onsets and offsets of kinematic phases in video recordings from each subject.\nHere, use the custom software called videoa written in Matlab to manually identify the time of stance onset and offset for each limb on a frame-by-frame basis, where stance onset is indicated by the loss of motion blur associated with the limb placement on a peg, and stance offset, occurring at the onset of limb lift-off, is indicated by the first evidence of motion blur.\nCalculate the duration of swing phase as the time remaining between two consecutive kinematic stance onsets. Exclude any behavior not consistent with overground quadrupedal walking, e.g., when gait contains a double swing phase (both forelimbs or hindlimbs off the ground), from proceeding analyses.\nPlot the duration of each phase as a function of the corresponding step cycle duration. Capture the relationship with the linear regression model (Tphase = B1+B2*Tc) obtained for each limb, where Tc is cycle duration, Tphase is either Te extensor-related stance or Tf, which is the flexor-related swing, and B1 and B2 are empirical constants (offset and slope) of the regression model.\n\tNote: The slope (B2) represents the amount of change in phase duration with the change in speed of locomotion.\nUse Equations 1 and 2 (Figure 2C) for each limb to calculate asymmetry index (AI). Both equations have the same form of a simple ratio that normalizes the difference of two values to their sum.",
    "Using Equation 1, calculate the horizontal difference (AIh) that uses the difference between slopes of stance modulation left (l) and right (r) limbs. Similarly, calculate the vertical asymmetry (AIv) using the slopes from front/anterior (a) and back / posterior (p) limbs. The result of applying these two equations is the dataset of 4 x-y points corresponding to 1) forelimb asymmetry, aAIh ; 2) hindlimb asymmetry, pAIh ; 3) left forelimb-hindlimb asymmetry, lAIv ; 4) right forelimb-hindlimb asymmetry, rAIv .\nPlot these values as a patch (Figure 2B) for the visual representation of asymmetry across all limbs.\nCalculate diagonality indices (DI) to assess diagonal coupling between parameters of a forelimb and its contralateral hindlimb (Equation 3, Figure 2C).\nTest the DI, as well as the difference of four AIs between conditions of opposing asymmetry (Î”AI = |AIL9R6 - AIL6R9| ) for statistical significance using a one-way ANOVA with the post-hoc comparison of means analysis19\nSubscription Required.
