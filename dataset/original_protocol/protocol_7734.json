    "Record the OD600 of the samples to be assayed. It is recommended that the OD600 of the samples to be analysed are in the 0.1-1 OD600 range. Dilute the samples in growth media to give an OD600 in the 0.1-1 range. Depending on the range of gene expression levels observed, the dilution factor may need to be optimised by analysing multiple dilutions.Collect 100 μl of the diluted samples (0.1-1 OD600 range) to be assayed and freeze at -70 °C in a 96-well microplate (the \"master plate\"). Once all samples are collected, return plate to the -70 °C and leave to freeze overnight.For example: For a time-course experiment in E. coli, 100 μl samples could be collected every hour for 12 h in a single microplate, returning the microplate to the -70 °C after collecting each sample. This microplate now acts as the \"master plate\", from which replicate assays can be carried out at a later date if desired. Negative media-only controls can also be added to the master plate in free wells.After all samples are collected (make sure all samples have been fully frozen at -70 °C), defrost the master plate in the 37 °C incubator with the lid off (to avoid cross-contamination via condensation). When the master plate has fully defrosted, aliquot 10 μl from each well into a new microplate (the \"assay plate\") using a multichannel pipette and place the assay plate in the -70 °C for at least 15 min.Pre-warm the microplate reader to 37 °C prior to carrying out the assay and initialise the microplate reader software so it is ready to go (see Notes about microplate reader settings for example settings).Prepare the final working reagent. Note: Prepare immediately prior to use and avoid prolonged exposure to light (i.e. Use the same day).",
    "Make enough for 100 μl per reaction. Defrost the assay plate in the 37 °C incubator with the lid off (to avoid cross-contamination via condensation) for at least 10 min and/or until any visible ice crystals have dissolved in all wells.Place yourself within close distance of the microplate reader. Dispense 100 μl of working reagent into each well of the 96-well microplate (or just wells containing samples) using a multichannel pipette. Try to minimize the time between dispensing reagent to each well. Immediately place the microplate in the plate reader with the lid off and start the program. Samples containing large amounts of β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase can saturate the assay within the first 10 min, therefore it is important to capture reads quickly after the addition of substrate. Note: For highly expressing samples that saturate the detector early, data is still recoverable. However as there are likely to be fewer timepoints with a linear increase in fluorescence the rate estimation may be less accurate. Sample dilution will improve accurate measurement of these samples.Extract the rate of increase in fluorescence from the reads using the microplate software or export to excel (see Figure 1):Plot the relative fluorescence intensity (the machine carries out internal fluorescence normalisation, hence it is \"relative\" fluorescence intensity) over time (per second is usually convenient). Choose a linear portion of the graph with the steepest slope (Vmax) from which to extrapolate the rate (in excel, the equation = SLOPE() can be used). This will provide relative fluorescence units per second (RFU/sec). Some platereader software will calculate Vmax automatically and in real time during the assay. If the graph is curved or very noisy, you may have problems with cell permeabilization or the fluorescence detector gain settings, respectively (see Troubleshooting below).",
    "Optional: Subtract the average RFU/sec of negative control wells (media-only with final working reagent) from all samples (in practice this value is usually zero or very small and so this step is usually not necessary).Normalise to optical cell density (OD600) recorded in step 1. This will give you units of RFU/sec/OD600.Values can be normalized to account for sample volume used (i.e. Divided by 0.01 ml to give values as RFU/sec/ml/OD600), however this normalization is somewhat arbitrary if the same volumes (10 μl) are always used. Alternatively, standard curves with known concentrations of purified β-galactosidase or β-glucuronidase can be used to estimate actual units of enzyme concentration.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130713/20130713061945_4176.pngFigure 1. Plot of raw relative fluorescence units over time. Biological triplicate samples were analysed by the β-galactosidase assay over a 30-min period, as described above. Mean slope and standard deviation for the three replicates are indicated next to each group. The highly-expressed samples saturate the detector after 600 sec. Statistically significant low-level expression is also detected from the lowly-expressed sample compared to the negative media-only (with final reagent mix) control. Final values for publication/presentation are normalised to OD600."
