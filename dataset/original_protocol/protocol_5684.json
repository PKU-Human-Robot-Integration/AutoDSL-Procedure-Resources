    "Promoter selection criteriaOur lab has previously developed CRISPR-Cas9 systems for the yeasts Y. lipolytica and Kluyveromyces marxianus (Schwartz et al., 2016; Lobs et al., 2017a). In these works, we compared CRISPR-Cas9 activity with sgRNA expression from native Pol III promoters, tRNAs, and hybrid Pol III promoters combining native Pol III promoters with a tRNA. In both organisms, hybrid Pol III promoters outperformed native Pol III promoters and tRNAs; however, the native Pol III promoter used in the best hybrid promoter was different in each organism. To date, only class II RNA Pol III promoters (those that are tRNA-like) have been demonstrated in hybrid promoters as described in this protocol. The class II promoters which can be tried include SNR52, SNR6, RPR1, and SCR1 (Marck et al., 2006). These can be identified in annotated genomes of an organism, or found via BLAST search using a closely related organism as input. In plant and mammalian systems, the Pol III U3 and U6 promoters have been extensively used for sgRNA expression, and so may be adaptable to a hybrid promoter approach (Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013; Shan et al., 2013).Hybrid promoter constructionThe hybrid promoter system combines the selected Pol III promoter and a tRNA sequence as shown in Figure 1. Sequences of tRNA from an organism can be identified via computational methods (Marck and Grosjean, 2002) or from a public database (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/[href=http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/]). Most often, such databases provide the mature tRNA sequence, which can be used to identify the full-length sequence in the genome via a BLAST search or a similar local alignment tool. In cases where the mature sequence is predicted or not know, experimental validation may be required. The addition of a tRNA allows the sgRNA to mature and be excised from the primary transcript.",
    "In addition, tRNAs are self-contained RNA Pol III promoters, which may result in improved sgRNA expression. The hybrid promoter consisting of the chosen RNA Pol III promoter and tRNA is placed upstream of the sgRNA encoding sequence with a polyT sequence for termination. This forms the complete hybrid promoter construct.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180315/20180315180434_2177.jpgFigure 1. Synthetic hybrid promoter construction. A. Schematic of the assembly of Pol III promoter, tRNA, and AvrII-containing sgRNA via Gibson assembly. Similar colored boxes denote overlap sequences and the AvrII site. B. Schematic of cloning specific 20 bp sgRNA target sequence into digested AvrII site.The desired Pol III promoter is amplified from genomic DNA in a PCR reaction with Q5 DNA polymerase. Genomic DNA can be extracted using an organism specific kit (for Y. lipolytica and K. marxianus we have used the YeaStarTM kit). Primers should be designed to bind ~200-300 bp upstream the ‘A-box’ and approximately 25 bp downstream from the ‘B-box’ of the Pol III promoter. The ‘B-box’ can be identified both by its putative consensus sequence (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ‘GWTCRAnnC’ and by its position downstream of an ‘A-box’ (consensus sequence ‘TRGYnnAnnnG’) (Marck et al., 2006). An example of a Pol III promoter amplified from genomic DNA is shown in Figure 2A. The primers used in the PCR reactions contain ~20-30 bp overlap sequences to join the truncated Pol III to the Cas9 plasmid backbone and the tRNA sequence via Gibson Assembly. The backbone homology sequence should contain a selected restriction site overhang. Example primers are shown below. The underlined sequences correspond to the promoter sequence of interest while the non-underlined sequences are the backbone and tRNA overlaps.Forward primer:CACATTTCCCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTGACGTCCCCAGTTGCAAAAGTTGACACReverse primer:AAACCATCGGCGCATTAGAGGTATTTTTCAAAGTAGCCCAGTGCAGAGTCCimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180315/20180315180627_2263.jpgFigure 2.

    "The italicized dimensions are recommendations but will differ between organisms and between promoters. B. Schematic of a tRNA sequence amplified from genomic DNA. Similar to A, the italicized dimensions will differ between different tRNAs. The sequences that flank upstream the A-box and downstream the B-box are essential for Rnase P and Rnase Z binding and excision of the tRNA. The tRNA sequence is similarly amplified from genomic DNA with Q5 DNA polymerase. Primers are designed ~20-30 bp upstream the A-box and ~20 bp downstream the B-box to allow for RNase P and RNase Z binding, respectively. Conserving these flanking sequences ensures excision of the matured tRNA. An example is seen in Figure 2B. The forward primer contains overlaps with the truncated promoter sequence. The reverse primer contains an overhang with an AvrII restriction site followed by an overlap of the sgRNA sequence. The AvrII restriction digestion site allows for easy addition of an N20 sgRNA targeting sequence. An example set of primers are shown below. The underlined sequence contains the tRNA sequence and the non-underlined sequences on the forward and reverse primer correspond to the truncated promoter and the AvrII (lower-cased)-sgRNA overlaps, respectively.Forward primer:CGAGTTCTGGACTCTGCACTGGGCTACTTTGAAAAATACCTCTAATGCGCCGReverse primer:AACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAAcctaggTCAACCTGCGCCGACCCThe final fragment containing the sgRNA sequence is amplified from plasmid pCRISPRyl (Addgene #70007) using primers containing AvrII- tRNA and Cas9 backbone overlaps.

This method can be used to simultaneously screen dozens of colonies.Isolate genomic DNA from random colonies after transformation using the YeaStar Genomic DNA Kit.Design primers that are 200 base pairs upstream and downstream of the sgRNA target sequence that will be used for amplification.Amplify the region flanking target site via PCR with Taq polymerase and purify.Sanger sequence the purified fragment and align with corresponding wild-type sequence to identify any indel or frameshift mutations.Alternatively, quantification of gene disruption can be done with an easily selectable growth-associated phenotype. Here we use Y. lipolytica as an example. In Y. lipolytica, disruption of the gene PEX10 prevents peroxisome biogenesis and results in an inability to use long-chain fatty acids as an energy source (Blazeck et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2017a). This means that colonies with this phenotype are unable to grow on minimal media with oleic acid as the sole carbon source. Therefore, a CRISPR plasmid containing a sgRNA target sequence that targets PEX10 can be used to screen for genetic disruption, allowing simultaneous screening of hundreds of colonies.The wild-type strain of Y. lipolytica, PO1f, is transformed with the designed CRISPR plasmid at stationary phase (Schwartz et al., 2016). Successful transformants are selected for via outgrowth in either liquid SD-leu media or on SD-leu agar plates. Selection in SD-leu media ensures that all tested colonies contain the CRISPR plasmid. Outgrowth allows for expression of the CRISPR system and gene disruption before screening.",
    "Transformed colonies are randomly selected and streaked on both YPD and SD oleic acid agar plates and incubated at 30 °C. Colonies that grow on YPD media but not SD oleic acid plates demonstrate genetic disruption of PEX10 as seen in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180315/20180315182606_3364.jpgFigure 3.
