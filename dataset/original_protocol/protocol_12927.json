    "Ethics Statement: All testing of human samples was performed after obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.\n1. DNA Extraction from FFPE Tissue, Peripheral Blood, and Bone Marrow Aspirate\nFor bone marrow FFPE tissue with DNA FFPE extraction kit\n\t\nBegin with FFPE tissue from unstained slides (5 - 10 sections at 5 - 10 µm thickness).\n\t\tNOTE: If beginning with tissue shavings, use 3 - 6 sections at 5 - 10 µm thickness and skip to step 1.1.6.\nPlace slides in a slide basket and prepare four wash reservoirs (two for Xylene and two for 100% Alcohol). Add a minimum volume of 600 mL of solution to each basket.\nDeparaffinize the slides by doing a 5 min xylene wash in the first tray. Transfer the slides to the second xylene wash reservoir for an additional 5 min.\nAfter deparaffinization, wash the slides with 100% alcohol for 5 min. Transfer the slides to the second alcohol wash reservoir for an additional 5 min.\nAllow the slides to dry completely under a hood before scraping them with a razor blade into a microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: If an H&E slide with tumor region indicated is available, align the slides and scrape only the tumor region.\nProceed with instructions from manufacturer handout included in kit.\nFor BM aspirate and Peripheral Blood\n\t\nExtract according to the manufacturer's instructions handout with these specifications.\n\t\tNOTE: There are numerous commercially available kits and methods for DNA extraction from FFPE tissues and cells. Practically, all can be used. Use a method that is established in the laboratory.\n\t\t\nUse 200 µL peripheral blood (PB) or 100 µL BM + 100 µL PBS.\nUse 4 µL RNase A stock solution.\nElute with 100 µL elution buffer.\nDNA Quantification",
    "Measure DNA concentrations using a spectrophotometer ensuring a 260 nm/280 nm ratio of approximately 1.8 (for pure DNA). If the ratio is appreciably lower, it may indicate the presence of protein, phenol, or other contaminants that may interfere with downstream applications.\nAdjust DNA concentrations to approximately 50 - 100 ng/µL with appropriate elution buffer.\n2. Wild-Type Blocking PCR\nPrimer Design\n\t\nDesign and obtain primers for genes of interest according to previously described general guidelines of PCR primer design13. Include M13-forward and reverse universal sequencing primers in PCR primers.\n\t\tNOTE: The MYD88 assay was developed to amplify exon 5 of MYD88 (G259 - N291) and 110 nucleotides located in the 5' intronic region to cover the splice site and part of intron 4. The forward and reverse primers were designed with a 5'-M13 sequence (M13-forward: tgt aaa acg acg gcc agt; M13-reverse: cag gaa aca gct atg acc) to allow for annealing of complementary sequencing primers (see Materials Table).\nLocked Nucleic Acid Oligonucleotide Design\n\t\nDesign the blocking oligonucleotide to be approximately 10 - 15 bases in length and complementary to the WT template where mutant enrichment is desired.\n\t\tNOTE: A shorter oligo will improve mismatch discrimination. To achieve high target specificity, it is important not to use too much blocking nucleotides since this can result in a very \"sticky\" oligonucleotide. The content and the length and blocking nucleotide should to be optimize according to the specific nucleotide that need to be blocked. It is important to achieve high binding specificity without compromising secondary structure and risking self-complementarity.",
    "Design the blocking oligo to have a Tm 10 - 15 °C above the extension temperature during thermocycling. Adjust the Tm by adding or removing blocking bases or by substituting blocking bases for DNA while avoiding long stretches (3 - 4 bases) of blocking G or C bases.\n\t\t\nNavigate to the oligo tools website (see Table of Materials) and select the \"blocking Oligo Tm Prediction\" tool.\nPaste the sequence of the WT template that is desired to be blocked into the \"Oligo Sequence\" box. Add \"+\" in front of bases to indicate blocker bases.\nSelect the \"Calculate\" button to determine the approximate Tm of the DNA-Blocker hybrid.\nDesign the blocking oligo to avoid secondary structure formation or self-dimers.\n\t\t\nNavigate to the oligo tools website (see Table of Materials) and select the \"blocking Oligo Optimizer\" tool.\nPaste the sequence of the WT template that is desired to be blocked into the box. Add \"+\" in front of bases to indicate blocking bases.\nSelect the two boxes for \"Secondary Structure\" and \"Self Only\". Press the Analyze button to review the oligo for potentially troublesome secondary structures or self-dimers.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The scores represent very rough estimates of the Tm's of the secondary structures and self-dimers. Lower scores are therefore optimal and can be achieved by limiting blocker-blocker pairing. The blocking oligonucleotide for MYD88 [MYD88blocker (TCAGA+AG+C+G+A+C+T+G+A+T+CC/invdT/)] was designed to cover amino acids Q262-I266 and features a 3'-inverted dT to inhibit both extension by DNA polymerase and degradation by 3'-exonuclease. This specific blocking oligo is a 17mer with 10 blocking bases which are denoted as \"+N\". The remaining 7 bases are ordinary DNA nucleotides.\nWTB-PCR Setup and Thermocycling",
    "Prepare a WTB-PCR master mix (MMX) using 2.5 µL PCR reaction buffer 10x w/ 20 mM MgCl2, 250 µM dNTPs, 0.2 µM forward and reverse primer, 1.2 µM MYD88blocker, and DNAse, RNAse-free, ultra-pure H2O to create a final solution volume of 21.75 µL per reaction.\n\t\tNOTE: Working concentrations are for the final reaction volume of 25 µL (after addition of DNA template and polymerase). Conventional PCR MMX is prepared by simply omitting the addition of blocker. All protocol steps remain identical for both WTB and conventional PCR. This can be used in validation and determining enrichment achieved by addition of blocker.\n\t\t\nWhen calculating the amount of MMX to prepare make sure to account for 3 additional reactions (positive and negative controls and a non-template control to check for contamination) and at least 1 additional reaction for pipetting error.\nVortex MMX thoroughly. The MMX can be stored at -80 °C for up to a year.\nAdd 0.25 µL Taq DNA polymerase per reaction to the MMX and invert to mix. Once the polymerase has been added to the MMX, keep it on ice.\nPut a new 96 well PCR plate on a cold plate and pipette 22 µL of MMX with polymerase to each reaction well.\nAdd 3 µL genomic DNA (50 - 100 ng/µL to each of the wells containing the MMX with polymerase.\nSeal the plate and centrifuge briefly to ensure the solution reaches the bottom of each well.\nLoad the PCR plate on a thermocycler.",
    "Set the thermocycling conditions for the WTB-PCR reaction as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 6 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 20 s; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Best practice involves completing the remainder of the protocol in a physically separate area to avoid amplicon contamination in future setups.\nPerform gel electrophoresis according to previously described protocols14 in order to determine if WTB-PCR was successful and to confirm a lack of amplification in the non-template control.\nPurification of PCR Product by magnetic beads\n\t\nRemove magnetic beads from 4 °C and bring to room temperature.\nTransfer 10 µL PCR product to a new PCR plate.\nVortex the magnetic beads vigorously to fully resuspend the magnetic particles.\nAdd 18 µL magnetic beads to each well on the new plate. Pipette mix 10 times.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nPlace the PCR plate onto the side-skirted magnet plate for 2 min to separate beads from solution.\nAspirate the supernatant with a multichannel pipette, avoiding the bead pellet.\nDispense 150 µL 70% ethanol into each well and incubate at room temperature for at least 30 s. Aspirate the ethanol with a multichannel pipette and discard tips. Repeat this wash procedure once more.\nUsing a 20 µL multichannel pipette aspirate the remaining ethanol from each well and discard tips.\nOnce wells are dry (~ 10 min), remove from magnet plate and add 40 µL nuclease free water to each well and pipette mix 15 times or vortex gently.\nIncubate at room temperature for 2 min.\nPlace the PCR plate onto magnet plate for 1 min to separate beads from solution.",
    "Transfer 35 µL of purified product to a new PCR plate. This is purified PCR product is now ready to proceed with bi-directional sequencing or can be stored at -20 °C until needed.\n\t\tNOTE: When developing a new assay, quantification of purified PCR product may be required. 1 - 3 ng/µL amplicon DNA is optimal for bi-directional sequencing. If concentration is consistently low, increase PCR product and magnetic beads proportionally (1:1.8). If concentration is consistently high, elute with a greater volume of water.\n3. Sequencing of WTB-PCR Product\nBi-Directional Sequencing\n\tNOTE: The following protocol is a modified form of the manufacturer's instructions that has been optimized to use fewer reagents.\n\t\nPrepare forward and reverse sequencing reaction mixes with 0.25 µL Ready Reaction mix, 1.88 µL Sequencing Buffer, 1.78 µM M13-F or M13-R sequencing primers and add and DNAse, RNAse-free, ultra-pure H2O to create a final solution volume of 9 µL per reaction. This sequencing reaction mix can be stored at -20 °C for up to a year.\nPipette 9 µL of the forward sequencing reaction mix into each well of a new 96 well PCR plate for the forward sequencing reaction. Repeat on a separate plate for the reverse sequencing reaction.\nAdd 1 µL of the purified WTB-PCR product to each well on both the forward and reverse plates.\nSeal the plate and centrifuge briefly to ensure the solution reaches the bottom of each well.\nLoad the PCR plate on a thermocycler.\n\t\t\nSet the thermocycling conditions for the sequencing reaction as follows: 96 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 96 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 4 min; hold at 4 °C until ready for purification.\nPurify Sequencing Products",
    "Prepare a fresh 1:25 solution of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 100% ethanol.\nPrepare a fresh 70% ethanol solution.\nAdd 30 µL of sodium acetate/100% ethanol solution to each well of both the forward and reverse sequencing plates and pipette mix 5 times.\nReseal the plate and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the plate at 2,250 x g for 15 min.\nRemove the plate sealer and invert over a waste container.\n\t\tNOTE: Invert only once or the pellet may loosen from the well bottoms.\nPlace the inverted plate on a clean paper towel and centrifuge at 150 x g for 1 min.\nAdd 150 µL 70% ethanol to each well.\nReseal the plate and spin at 2,250 x g for 5 min.\nRepeat steps 3.2.6 and 3.2.7.\nIf the wells are not completely dry, allow them to air dry at room temperature. Make sure the samples are protected from light while drying.\nAdd 10 µL Formamide to each well and pipette mix 10 times. Reseal the plate.\nDenature on thermocycler at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 4 °C for 5 min.\nAfter denaturing, replace the plate sealer with a septa and sequence on sequencing platform according to manufacturer's instructions15.\n4. Analysis of Sequencing Results\nVisualize sequencing traces using a sequencing data analysis software according to manufacturer's instructions16 and align to the respective reference sequences.
