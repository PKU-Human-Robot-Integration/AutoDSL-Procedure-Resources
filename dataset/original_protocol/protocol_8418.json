    "The experimental protocol was conducted in compliance with the European Communities Council Directives for Animal Experiment (2010/63/EU, 86/609/EEC and 87-848/EEC) and was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of University of Namur (ethic project n°17-284). Figure 1 depicts the two respective approaches: transdiaphragmatic or transthoracic injections. Use male C57bl/6J mice (n=18), aged from 3 to 4 months in the study.\n1. Preparation of CTB Solution\nFor transdiaphragmatic injections:\n\t\nDissolve the CTB power in sterile water to the concentration of 0.2% (w/v).\nLoad 7.5 µL of CTB solution (0.2% w/v) in a sterile 10-µL-microsyringe with an attached 33-gauge needle (blunt or short bevel) for each mouse.\nFor transthoracic injection:\n\t\nDissolve the CTB power in sterile water to the concentration of 0.1% (w/v).\nLoad 20 µL of CTB solution (0.1% w/v) in a sterile 500-µl-insulin syringe with a beveled 27-gauge needle for each mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure to use distilled and sterile water and properly dissolve the CTB powder. The solution can be kept at 4 °C for a month (do not freeze). A precipitate might form after few days. Bring the solution to room temperature and mix well using a pipette before use.\n2. Preparation Prior to Intrapleural Injections\nSterilize surgical tools prior to surgery, using autoclave or glass-bead sterilizer.Prepare a clean bench coat to do surgery and to dispose the surgical tools.\n\tNOTE: Any material used during the surgical procedure should be sterile. Instruments that cannot be sterilized such as the microsyringe should be wiped down with a disinfectant (chlorhexidine) or should be single-use only. The surgeon should wash her/his hands with a disinfectant (chlorhexidine scrub) before the beginning of the surgery. The surgeon should wear sterile gloves, a facemask, and a clean gown.",
    "Weigh animal, and administer an appropriate dose of anesthesia: intraperitoneal injection of anesthetic cocktail (e.g. ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 5 mg/kg).\nPinch toe and/or check for the loss of palpebral reflex to determine if the mouse is properly anesthetized. Apply a vet ointment to protect the cornea.\nShave carefully the ventral skin (for transdiaphragmatic procedure) or the right-sided thoracic skin (for transthoracic procedure), using electric hair clippers. Shave well and broad enough to prevent hair getting into the surgery field.\nEnsure aseptic conditions by topical application of 10% iodine solution on the shaved area. Scrub the surgical site with the iodine solution, being careful to scrub from the center of the site toward the periphery.\nUse a homeothermic pad throughout the surgery to maintain the animal's body temperature.\n3. Intrapleural Injections using Transdiaphragmatic Approach\nLay down the anesthetized mouse in supine position on a heating pad. Place a rolled gauze pad under the neck of the animal. For an adult mouse, use a rolled gauze pad of 0.5 inch in thickness. Tape this pad to the surgery board to avoid movement if any.\nUsing a scalpel blade, incise the ventral skin along the midline: make an incision from the xiphoid process to the umbilical region while stretching the skin laterally with the other hand to make the skin taut. Do not apply too much pressure on the blade to avoid damaging underlying organs.\nUsing small scissors, carefully detach the skin from the abdominal muscles around the incision. This procedure will help at stitching the muscles and the skin apart at the end of the surgery.",
    "Perform laparotomy using small scissors. Open the abdominal cavity by performing a buttonhole incision at the level of the umbilicus. Incise the abdominal muscles along the white line (\"linea alba\") up to the xiphoid process.\nIn order to visualize the abdominal surface of the diaphragm, retract abdominal muscles using commercial or homemade retractors.\n\tNOTE: These retractors can be made from midi-size paper clips shaped into L-hook19.\nStretch out both sides of the laparotomy, and tape down the retractors to the bench coat. Optimize the illumination of the field of view so that the abdominal surface of the diaphragm is no more in the penumbra. The most powerful lighting device for this purpose is a LED lamp with an orientable light beam.\nUsing soft tweezers in one hand, lift up the xyphoid appendix and pull down the lateral lobes of the liver (Figure 2A). Using small scissors in the other hand, carefully cut off the suspensory ligament, without damaging the gallbladder or the diaphragm (Figure 2B).\nUsing soft tweezers in one hand, lift up the xyphoid appendix. Grasp the Hamilton syringe in the other hand. Target three sites of injection in the right hemidiaphragm to respectively cover the sternal, the medial and the crural regions (Figure 3A, inset in Figure 3B).\nAs the diaphragm thickness is around 0.37 mm in mice7, insert the needle no more than 1 or 2 mm beyond the diaphragm sheet to prevent lung damages during breathing. Deliver 2.5 µL of CTB solution (0.2% w/v) through the right diaphragm at each site (Figure 4B). Stabilization of the diaphragm is not required.\nRepeat this procedure for the three ipsilateral sites of injection (Figure 1A), and contralaterally for a bilateral labeling of the PhMN pool.",
    "To close the laparotomy site, suture abdominal muscles with resorbable 4-0 suture. Use interrupted stitches spaced by 3 mm. Staple skin closed with 9.0 mm wound clips. Tighten staples to prevent animal from pulling off staples. Space staples approximately 5 mm apart. Do not over-tighten the wound clips, as this can lead to impaired healing.\nClean micro syringe with distilled water to prevent clogging. Slowly draw up and expel 2-3 times. Do not draw air into syringe.\n4. Intrapleural Injection using Transthoracic Approach\nNOTE: This method is inspired from the procedure described in rats4 and was adapted to mouse.\nLay down the anesthetized mouse in left lateral decubitus position, on a heating pad (Figure 4A).\nIdentify the sixth and seventh ribs under the elbow region by manual palpation (Figure 4B).\nWhile an assistant extends right fore- and hind- limbs (Figure 5A), insert the syringe cranially oriented and tangentially under the sixth or the seventh rib, 3 mm deep from the skin, with the bevel down (Figure 1B and Figure 5B).\nElevate the needle gently to confirm, by lifting the ribs up, that it is well positioned into the thoracic cavity (Figure 5C, insets in Figure 1B).\nStabilize breathing movements of the chest by applying slight pressure with two fingers on the chest wall.\nWhile holding the syringe in the other hand, deliver 20 µL of CTB solution (0.1% w/v) in a single injection.\n5. Post-operative Care\nImmediately after the procedure, lay the mouse in right lateral decubitus position on a homeothermic pad for recovery. This ensures the tracer to spread on the right side of the pleural cavity and allows for monitoring animal's breathing.\nAdminister 1 mL of sterile saline solution i.p. subcutaneously. Provide follow-up injections if the animal appears dehydrated and/or listless.",
    "Administer subcutaneously 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine, twice a day during the first two days post-surgery, to minimize any potential pain.\n\tNOTE: Many institutions would recommend multimodal analgesia for invasive procedures, such as the laparotomy depicted here. This could include the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication and/or a local anesthetic agent at the incision site. These medications are typically delivered prior to the first incision to minimize wind-up pain.\nMonitor animals daily up to euthanasia.\nSubscription Required.
