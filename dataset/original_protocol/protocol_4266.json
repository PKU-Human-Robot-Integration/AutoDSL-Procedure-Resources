    "Probe protein purificationConstruct a V5-His6-protein fusion construct (i.e. pYES-DEST52, Life Technologies, Invitrogen™) of the yeast protein you wish to profile by using the methods outlined by Fasolo and Snyder (2009).Yeast (Y258 strain optimized for protein purification (Zhu et al., 2001)) that have been transformed with a pYES-DEST52 fusion construct under control of the GAL1 inducible promoter are grown in Sc-Ura/Dex overnight in 5 ml starter cultures.The next day OD600 are determined for the starter cultures and used to inoculate a 400 ml. Sc-Ura/Raffinose culture to an OD600 = 0.1. The culture is grown at 30 °C shaking to an OD600 = 0.55-0.6 and induced with 200 ml 3XYEP-GAL for 6 h at 30 °C shaking.Cell pellet is harvested by centrifugation using a JA-10 (or comparable) rotor by spinning 400 ml volumes of cell suspension at 4,000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min.Wash cell pellet in ice cold PBS buffer by transferring the cell pellet to 50 ml conical tube and centrifuging in a tabletop centrifuge at 3,000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min.Re-suspend cell pellet in ice cold PBS once more and aliquot evenly into 4 screw cap 2.0 ml. FASTPREP compatible tubes (pellet weight is ~0.5 g/tube).Spin cell suspension at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1 min in a tabletop microfuge and aspirate supernatant. Snap freeze cell pellet immediately in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C or lyse immediately (you can stop here and proceed on the following day if not prepared for following steps).Add 0.5 mm zirconia beads, and lysis buffer at a 1:1:1 ratio to cell pellet and store on ice.Place tubes on FastPrep machine for 6 cycles of lysis at maximum setting for 1 min each, with 1 min on ice in between each interval.",
    "Spin suspension down in tabletop microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min, 10 min and collect supernatant.Repeat steps 9 and 10 then discard extracted pellet.Combine supernatant from both extractions into a single tube and incubate with Ni2+, or Co2+ affinity resin for 3 h/4 °C/rotating on a wheel.Centrifuge resin and save small aliquot of cleared supernatant for quality control.Wash resin 2x 10 min in wash buffer 1 /4 °C/rotating on a wheel.Wash resin 2x 10 min in wash buffer 2 /4 °C/rotating on a wheel.Wash resin 1x 10 min in wash buffer 3 /4 °C/rotating on a wheel.Collect washed resin in G25 or comparable column and elute with elution buffer and store at -80 °C until ready to use in probing assay (stop here is not ready to proceed).Protein microarray probingDilute the purified protein probe over a concentration range of 5-500 μg/ml in the probe buffer (concentration of probe is empirically determined for each protein-protein interaction assay).Block the arrays in blocking buffer for 1 h by shaking at 50 rpm on a stage at 4 °C.After blocking, transfer the arrays to a humidified chamber, and add 90 μl of diluted probe directly to the array surface. Overlay the arrays with a raised lifter slip and incubate static (no shaking) in the humidor for 1.5 h.Wash the arrays 3 times for 1 min each in probe buffer in three 50-ml conical tubes.To detect interactions, dilute the V5-AlexaFluor 647 antibody to 260 ng/ml in probe buffer and mix thoroughly by shaking on a wheel for 30 min at 4 °C.After washing the arrays several times as indicated, add antibody solution directly to array and overlay with a raised lifter slip as before. Incubate the arrays for 30 min/static/4 °C.",
    "Finally, wash the arrays for 1 min (3x) in probe buffer, and spin in a 50-ml conical tube at 800 x g in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 min at RT. Air-dry the arrays in a slide holder in the dark for 30 min prior to scanning the array at 647 nm on an Axon 4200 AL microarray reader (or comparable)."
