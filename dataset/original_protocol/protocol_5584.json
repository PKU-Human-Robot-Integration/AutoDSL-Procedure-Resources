    "Bacterial strains culture   Single colonies of bacterial strains used in this protocol, including V. alginolyticus 178, V. anguillarum, V. splendidus, V. vulnificus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp. 176 and B. subtilis, were selected from their pure culture plates.   V. alginolyticus 178, V. anguillarum, V. splendidus, V. vulnificus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri and Bacillus sp. 176 were cultured in 5 ml saline Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (see Recipes) in tubes at 28 °C overnight with shaking at 170 rpm.   Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis were cultured in 5 ml LB broth in tubes at 37 °C overnight with shaking at 170 rpm.      Aggregation assay of V. alginolyticus 178 in culture tubes   After overnight culture, dilute the cell suspension of V. alginolyticus 178 at 1:100 with saline LB broth.   Prepare six sterilized 15 ml culture tubes.   Add 3 ml bacterial suspension into each tube.   Treat the cells with 90 μl (10 mg/ml) CLPs with a final concentration of 300 μg/ml or same volume DMSO, respectively, and incubate statically at 28 °C for 24 h after homogenization (Figure 1A).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101234643_5863.jpg Figure 1. Experimental design of V. alginolyticus 178 aggregation in culture tubes and 96-well plates. A. Aggregation of V. alginolyticus 178 was observed in culture tubes after CLPs treatment. B. Schematic representation of the steps in aggregation assay using 96-well plates (No. 1 well contains untreated V. alginolyticus 178; No. 2 well contains CLPs treated V. alginolyticus 178).      Aggregation assay of V. alginolyticus 178 in 96-well microtiter plate   Add 200 μl diluted bacterial suspension into each well of the flat bottom 96-well microtiter plate.   In experiment group, add 6 μl CLPs (10 mg/ml) with a final concentration of 300 μg/ml in each well, and homogenize with bacterial suspension.   Wells containing V.",
    "alginolyticus 178 cell suspension without treatment, or with DMSO treatment, are employed as controls.    Five replicate wells for each treatment, and incubate the plate at 28 °C for 24 h.    After incubation, discard the planktonic cells carefully with a pipettor and wash the aggregated cells in each well three times with sterile saline.    Fix aggregated cells with 200 μl of methanol (99% purity) per well statically for 15 min, and empty the plates using a pipettor and leave to dry.    Then stain the contents of the wells with 200 μl of a 1% (w/v) crystal violet (see Recipes) solution for 10 min at room temperature.    Rinse out crystal violet with a pipettor; air-dry the plates after wash with sterile deionized water, and resolubilize the dye bound to the aggregated cells in 200 μl of 30% (v/v) acetic acid (see Recipes) solution.   Measure the absorbance of each well in a SYNERGY-H1 microplate reader (BioTek, USA) at 595 nm using 30% acetic acid as the blank (Figure 1B).      Quantitative assay of CLPs’ activity   Add 200 μl diluted bacterial suspension into each well of the flat bottom 96-well microtiter plate.   Add 6 μl CLPs at different concentration (25, 50, 100, 200, 300 μg/ml) into different wells, respectively.    Wells containing V. alginolyticus 178 cell suspension without treatment, or with DMSO treatment, are employed as controls.   Operate the other procedures as described above in Steps C4-C9 (Figure 2).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101234909_3699.jpg Figure 2. Quantitative cell aggregation assay at different concentrations of CLPs      Scanning electron microscope observation   Dilute overnight cultured cell of V. alginolyticus 178 at 1:100 into 5 ml fresh modified 2216E medium (see Recipes) and culture for another 3 h to OD600 0.2-0.3 with shaking at 170 rpm.   Add the cell suspension with 50 μl 50 or 100 μg/ml CLPs or DMSO for additional 3 h.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 1,400 x g for 4 min at room temperature, and resuspend the cells with a sterilized saline solution.   Drop the resuspended bacterial cells on sterilized coverslips (enveloped by 1% gelation solution, see Recipes), respectively.   Dry coverslips at room temperature.   Fix samples with a 5% glutaraldehyde solution (see Recipes) for 1 h.   Wash with sterile saline solution (see Recipes).    Dehydrate samples in a successively graded ethanol series (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100% ethanol). Incubate the samples for 10 min in each grade ethanol solution. After the final incubation in 100% ethanol, the samples are ready for observation under scanning electron microscope. Note: You can stop when the samples are placed in 80% ethanol.   Observe the samples under a scanning electron microscope (Figure 3).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101235041_6374.jpg Figure 3.

Transmission electron microscope observation   Perform the procedures as described above in Steps E1-E3.   Fix samples with a 5% glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h.   Drop samples on copper grids, and dried at room temperature.   Observe the samples under a transmission electron microscope (Figure 4).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180101/20180101235200_5633.jpg Figure 4.

The spectrum of action of the CLPs   After overnight culture, dilute the cell suspension of V. anguillarum, V. splendidus, V. vulnificus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp. 176 and B. subtilis at 1:100 with saline LB broth or LB broth, respectively.",
