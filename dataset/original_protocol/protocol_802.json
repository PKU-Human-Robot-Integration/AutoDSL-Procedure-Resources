    "Procedure\n• **Superovulation and harvesting of zygotes**\no _Day 1 \\(between 12:00-1:00 PM)_\n Inject 5 IU PMSG I.P. into 6-week-old female mice of a strain from which you wish to generate an ESC line.\no _Day 3 \\(between 12:00-1:00 PM)_\n Inject 5 IU HCG I.P. into female mice and immediately set up with males that have previously generated offspring. Setting up each superovulated female with a single male will increase the likelihood of fertilization.\no _Day 4 \\(morning)_\n Prepare microdrops with 50 uL M2 and 50 uL M2+0.3 mg/mL hyaluronidase in a 60 mm suspension culture dish and cover the dish with oil. Also prepare microdrop culture dishes of 50 uL KSOM media covered with oil. Keep microdrop plates at 37ºC until needed. \n Sacrifice plugged female mice, isolate each oviduct using spring scissors, collect the oviducts in a 60 mm suspension culture dish containing PBS, and place the oviducts into the M2+hyralonidase drop.\n With fine tweezers, rip the oviduct to release the zygotes and surrounding cumulus cells into the media.\n Using a mouth pipette, locate and transfer zygotes from the M2+hyralonidase to M2 media. Wash the zygotes 3 times in M2 media and then 3 times in KSOM media. Collect all zygotes in a clean drop of KSOM and place in a 37ºC 5%CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Do not disturb the embryos after they are placed in KSOM.\n• _Perform this step as quickly as possible. The quicker the zygotes are placed in KSOM at 37ºC 5%CO<sub>2</sub>, the more likely they will develop into blastocysts._",
    "o → **NOTE:** the number of zygotes obtained, thus the amount of potential ESC lines that can be generated, will vary from strain to strain. Some strains will yield high numbers of zygotes, whereas others will yield few to zero. The age of the females also inversely correlates with the number of oocytes that are superovulated. Using young females and optimizing the dosage of PMSG and/or HCG can increase the number of zygotes obtained. Scale the number of female mice superovulated in order to obtain the number of lines needed.\no → **NOTE:** The following protocol was performed essentially as described in Nagy et. al, Manipulating the mouse Embryo<sup>14</sup>. For greater detail, please refer to this manual.\n• **Preparation of MEF feeder layer for deriving ESC lines**\nStep 1 - Cover the bottom of each well \\(4 well plates for initial embryo attachment, or 24 or 6 well plates for expansion) with gelatin solution. Incubate for ≥5 minutes at RT.\n \nStep 2 - Remove gelatin and plate an appropriate number of MEFs using MEF media according to the surface area of the well being used.\nStep 3 - Allow the MEFs to attach for a minimum of 6 hours, but preferably O/N before using them to derive/expand ESCs. The irradiated MEFs should be used within 3 days after thawing/plating.\n• **Derivation and propagation of ESCs**\nStep 1 - Two days after zygote isolation, determine the number of morulas present by examining them under the dissection microscope. Prepare an appropriate number of 4 well plates with a MEF feeder layer \\(1 well for each developing embryo).\n→ **NOTE:** Work quickly with embryos when they are outside of the incubator. Early embryos are very sensitive to temperature fluctuations.",
    "Step 2 - When embryos have formed a blastocoel \\(usually 3 days after zygote isolation), transfer a blastocyst using a mouth pipette into 1 well of a 4 well tissue culture plate. Before transferring the embryos, replace the MEF media used to plate the MEF feeder layer with 500 uL of 2i/L media. Place each plate into a 37ºC 5%CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and **DO NOT DISTURB** for 4 days.\nStep 3 - After 4 days of culture, determine whether the embryos have attached to the feeder layer. In the wells with attached embryos, **gently** remove the media and **slowly** add 500 uL of fresh 2i/L medium. If the embryo has not yet attached, add 500 ul of fresh 2i/L medium to the existing media. Place the embryos and resulting outgrowths back into a 37ºC 5%CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for an additional 3 days. Do not disturb the embryos and outgrowths during this time.\nStep 4 - Plate irradiated feeders on a 24 well tissue culture plate and place in a 37ºC 5%CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. You will need 1 well for every outgrowth obtained.\nStep 5 - After the embryos are allowed to attach and form outgrowths for 7 days in 2i/L media, pick each outgrowth using a 20 uL micropipette into a single well of a V-shaped bottom 96-well plate containing 30 uL of PBS.\n→ **NOTE:** Minimize the volume of the medium containing the outgrowth to less than 10 uL. \nStep 6 - After all the outgrowths have been picked into 30uL of PBS, add 60 uL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 5 min at 37°C.",
    "Step 7 - Add 100 uL of S/L media to the dissociated outgrowths and transfer the dissociated cells into a single well of the 24 well plate made on Step 4. Cells can be transitioned to 100% S/L media at this time. Change media every other day and after 3-4 days, you should see the emergence of colonies. When the well becomes ~70% confluent, either passage the line or freeze it down. We refer to this ES line as passage 1. Check for Mycoplasma at this time.\n→ **NOTE:** Depending on the size of the outgrowth, the time spent on trypsin varies. While dissociating the cells, it may help to mechanically dissociate the outgrowth using a micropipette until you no longer see the large clump of cells. The presence of several smaller clumps is acceptable. Make sure the outgrowths do not spend too much time on trypsin as this will negatively impact their ability to expand.  \n• **Passaging**\nStep 8 - If ESCs are to be split onto MEFs, plate irradiated MEFs onto either a 6 well plate or T25 flask the day before you are going to split the ESC line. If you are not using a MEF feeder layer to passage your ESCs, just coat the plate with gelatin, as described.\nStep 9 - Once ESCs are ready to be passaged, remove the supernatant, wash the cells with PBS, and add just enough trypsin-EDTA to cover the cells. Incubate the ESCs for 5 minutes at 37ºC.\nStep 10 - Add S/L media totaling 5X the amount of trypsin used to dissociate the ESCs \\(e.g. if you used 1 mL of trypsin, add 5 mL of S/L media). Dissociate the ESCs into single cells by repeatedly pipetting the cells up and down.",
    "Step 11 - Transfer the cells into a conical tube and spin the cells for 5 minutes at 1,000 RPMs, 4ºC. Remove the media and resuspend the ESCs in 1mL of the media being used to culture them.\n→ **NOTE:** We typically split our ESCs 1:10 or 1:20 every 4 days depending on their growth rate.\n**Cryopreservation of ESC cultures**\nStep 1 - Harvest ESCs by repeating Steps 9-11. However, instead of resuspending the ESC pellet in media, resuspend in 4 mLs of the appropriate freezing media.\nStep 2 - Aliquot the ESCs dissociated in the requisite freezing medium into 4 cryovials. \n→ **NOTE:** a 1:4 split into freezing medium is recommended to reestablish the culture in the same flask/well used to culture the ESCs.\nStep 3 - Transfer the tubes to a -80°C freezer overnight and them move them to liquid nitrogen for long term storage."
