After this step, a functional FUS transducer will be built.\nPrepare lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic piezo material (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2497-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Two magnets are installed in the adapter.\n(E) Fabricated transducers with different frequencies.\n(F) 3D-printed adapter with two magnets.\n(G) Adapter to connect the FUS transducer to the shaft of the stereotactic frame.\n(H) Overview of the setup of the miniature FUS device for mice.\nNote: This can be purchased from the manufacturers (e.g., Del Piezo Specialties LLC.) at ∼$80 per element. The PZT used in our study has a diameter of 13 mm and a radius of curvature of 10 mm.\nSplit a 50-ohm impedance coaxial cable into positive and negative ports.\nConnect the positive and negative ports to the positive and negative electrodes of the PZT by soldering (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCritical: After the cable wires are soldered to the electrodes, verify that the wires are connected to the electrodes in a closed circuit using a multimeter.\nCover the connection points of the soldered electrodes with epoxy.\nNote: This procedure creates a waterproof covering and strengthens the attachment of the wires to the PZT element.\nFabricate the housing for the PZT using a commercial 3D printer (e.g., Ultimaker, Formlab, etc.) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: The 3D printing files of the housing design are available at https://github.com/ChenUltrasoundLabWUSTL/stereotactic-system.git[href=https://github.com/ChenUltrasoundLabWUSTL/stereotactic-system.git]. The 3D-printing material used in this study is polylactic acid (PLA).",
    "Encase the PZT in the 3D-printed housing unit and use epoxy to seal the housing, and the FUS transducer will be ready (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: No electrical impedance matching is needed because the real part of the transducer impedance at the resonance frequency is in the range of 31–59 ohms, which is close to the 50 ohms needed for a perfect impedance match.\nCritical: Use a multimeter to verify that the wires are connected to the electrodes using a multimeter during the assembly process until the PZT is completely secured to the housing.\nFill the transducer housing with degassed ultrasound gel in the coupling cone for acoustic coupling each time the device is used to generate ultrasound for FUS-BBBO.\nNote: Ultrasound gel can be degassed using a centrifuge.\nCritical: Slowly inject degassed ultrasound gel into the coupling cone with a syringe to avoid gas trapped in the cone. Attention needs to be paid during this process to avoid trapping any bubbles.\nDegas water by filling a side-arm flask with deionized and distilled water and connecting the side arm to the vacuum.\nNote: The degassing process can be accelerated by placing the flask on a magnetic stirrer with a magnetic stirring bar set inside the flask.\nCalibrate the pressure field generated by the FUS transducer using a needle hydrophone as a receiver in a degassed water tank.\nNote: The transmitter system composes the FUS transducer, function generator, and power amplifier.\nUse the function generator to generate an electric waveform that is amplified by the power amplifier and input into the transducer.",
    "Note: During calibration, the transmitter system should be the same as the one used for the FUS-BBBO experiment. The pressures reported in our previous study were the peak negative pressures measured with three mouse skulls. Three FUS transducers with frequencies of 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 MHz are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E. The FUS transmission coefficients were 81.0% ± 4.2% at 1.5 MHz, 65.2% ± 2.1% at 3.0 MHz, and 38.6% ± 2.2% at 6.0 MHz based on the experimental calibration results. As the FUS frequency increased from 1.5 MHz to 3.0 MHz and 6.0 MHz, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the focal region decreased from 1.8 ± 0.1 mm to 1.0 ± 0.1 mm and 0.5 ± 0.0 mm, respectively. Correspondingly, the full length at half maximum (FLHM) decreased from 5.9 ± 0.1 mm to 3.6 ± 0.2 mm and 3.0 ± 0.1 mm. Users can select the frequency of the FUS transducer based on their specific applications.\nCritical: The waveform is recommended to have short pulses (approximately 10 cycles) to avoid reflection interference and potential cavitation damage on the hydrophone surface.\nAttaching the FUS transducer to a stereotactic frame\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThe purpose of this step is to attach the FUS transducer to the stereotactic frame. If this step is performed, the integrated device can precisely target a desired brain location for FUS treatment.\nFabricate the adapter for the FUS transducer using a 3D printer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: The design of the adaptor is available for download at https://github.com/ChenUltrasoundLabWUSTL/stereotactic-system.git[href=https://github.com/ChenUltrasoundLabWUSTL/stereotactic-system.git].\nInsert magnets in both the transducer housing and adapter to enable simple magnetic attachment and detachment of the transducer to the adapter.\nFix the adapter to the stereotactic frame via the shaft (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).",
    "Note: The transducer can then be easily attached to the adapter by the magnets. The FUS transducer can be moved to target a desired brain location in reference to the mouse brain atlas, as described in the next stop. The stereotactic frame has a 10-micron movement resolution for all axes and an easy-to-read compact digital display console (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nPerforming the FUS-BBBO procedure\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe purpose of this step is to perform the FUS-BBBO experiment for drug delivery to the brain. Here, Evans blue is used as a model drug.\nPrepare the microbubbles.\nTake the DEFINITY microbubbles out from the 4°C refrigerator.\nActivate the microbubbles via mechanical agitation using a VialMix shaker for a preset time of 45 s.\nSlowly withdraw the activated microbubbles from the vial using an 18 G needle attached to a 1 mL syringe following the manufacturer’s instruction[href=https://www.definityimaging.com/using-definity].\nCritical: As microbubbles can easily rupture, effort should be made to handle microbubbles carefully following manufacturer's instruction[href=https://www.definityimaging.com/using-definity].\nAnesthetize the mouse using isoflurane.\nPlace the mouse in an anesthetic induction chamber. The chamber is connected to 1.5%–2% isoflurane with oxygen as the carrier gas.\nMove the mouse to the stereotaxic apparatus; the apparatus should have two ear bars and one biting bar.\nHold the mouse’s head flat and steady using the biting bar and ear bars.\nConnect the nose cone to the mouse’s nose to deliver isoflurane (1%–2%) to maintain anesthetization.\nApply ophthalmic ointment in each eye to protect the cornea from desiccation or other injuries.\nPlace the animal on a heating pad to maintain body temperature at ∼37°C.\nCritical: Throughout this process, carefully monitor the mouse's breathing by observing the movement of the chest wall and adjusting the anesthesia level accordingly.\nRemove the fur on the mouse head (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2497-Fig2.jpg",

Application of the miniature FUS device\n(A) Place the mouse on the stereotactic frame.\n(B) Draw a dot on the lambda in the mouse skull.\n(C) Picture of the 3D printed pointer.\n(D) Align the 3D-printed pointer with lambda.\n(E) Fill the coupling cone of the FUS transducer with degassed ultrasound gel.\n(F) Place ultrasound gel on the mouse head.\n(G) Replace the pointer with the FUS transducer.\n(H) Navigate the transducer to the targeted brain location using the stereotactic frame according to the coordinates of the target relative to lambda. The coordinates are determined using the mouse brain atlas.\n(I) Correlations between drug (here, Evans blue was used as a model drug) delivery volume and intensity with the cavitation index (CI).\n(J) Fluorescence images for visualizing the Evans blue delivery outcome.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nTrim the mouse fur from head to neck using a hair clipper.\nApply hair removal cream to the mouse head and allow the cream to stay on for 2–4 min.\nClean the area with gauze and alcohol pads.\nNote: Ensure that no fur remains on the head and that the scalp is intact. Residual fur will block ultrasound propagation and attenuate the acoustic pressure in the target region.\nCritical: Be cautious when applying hair removal cream, as leaving hair removal cream for too long can burn the scalp.\nPlace a tail vein catheter for microbubble and drug injections.\nWarm the tail with a hand warmer if necessary; then, wipe the tail with an alcohol wipe and insert a 27 G × ½\" butterfly needle into the tail vein, with the other end of the needle connected to a polyethylene tubing.\nConnect the tubing to a 1 mL plastic syringe filled with saline.",
    "Note: Approximately 10 μL saline can be injected into the mouse tail vein to ensure that tail vein catheterization is successful. If the injection is successful, secure the catheter using surgical tape.\nAlign the miniature transducer with the lambda on the mouse skull.\nDraw a dot using a marker pen on the mouse’s scalp to indicate the location of the lambda on the mouse’s skull (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Lambda is selected as a landmark because it is a point on the mouse skull that is visible through the scalp.\n3D print a pointer that can fit into the transducer adapter. The tip of the pointer represents the geometric focus of the transduce (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace the pointer in the holder and adjust its position using the stereotactic frame to align the pointer with the dot (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nFill the entire cavity of the coupling cone of the transducer housing with degassed ultrasound gel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nApply ultrasound gel to the exposed skin above the skull (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nCritical: Ensure that there are no air bubbles in the ultrasound gel by visual inspection when filling the cavity of the coupling cone of the transducer housing or placing the gel on the mouse head. The presence of air bubbles will interfere with the acoustic wave propagation through the gel.\nSwitch the pointer to the FUS transducer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nMove the FUS transducer from the lambda to the target brain location using the coordinates of the target relative to the lambda (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).",
    "Note: The coordinates can be determined using the mouse brain atlas.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] For example, if the desired brain target is in the left thalamus, according to the mouse brain atlas, its coordinates relative to lambda are: +2.26 mm in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction, -1.50 mm in the medial-lateral (ML) direction, and -3.30 mm in the dorsal-ventral (DV) direction.\nConnect the ultrasound system according to the following sequence: Function generator → power amplifier → FUS transducer.\nSet the ultrasound parameters as follows: 10 ms in pulse length, 1 Hz in pulse repetition frequency, and 120 s in total duration.\nNote: The frequency is determined by the center frequency of the FUS transducer (e.g., 1.5 MHz, 3.0 MHz, and 6.0 MHz), and the amplitude of the signal is set according to the hydrophone calibration result.\nInject the microbubbles.\nUse a Hamilton syringe to withdraw the microbubble solution. The dose of the DEFINITY microbubbles used in our study was 10 × the clinical dose, which was 100 μL/kg.\nNote: Lower doses of microbubbles can be used, but the acoustic pressure will need to be increased to achieve a similar outcome.\nReplace the 1 mL plastic syringe that is connected to the tail vein tubing with the Hamilton syringe.\nInject the microbubbles slowly into the tail vein.\nChange back to the plastic syringe.\nInject saline (∼10 μL) to flush the tail vein tubing.\nCritical: During the process of changing syringes, caution needs to be taken to avoid introducing any air bubbles into the catheter.\nPerform FUS sonication.\nBefore turning on the FUS, check the parameter settings are correct and the cable connection is correct (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nTurn on FUS immediately following the microbubble injection.",
    "Note: The applied FUS pressure and frequency depend on the user's application and desired delivery outcome. Based on our previous study, the FUS-BBBO outcome (volume and intensity) can be tuned according to the cavitation index (CI), which is defined by the ratio between the acoustic pressure (P) and frequency (f), (  C I = P / f  ).\nDeliver Evans blue (other agents also work).\nNote: Administer Evans blue (60 μL of 2% Evans Blue) immediately after FUS sonication.\nFill the Hamilton syringe with 60 μL of Evans blue.\nPlace the Hamilton syringe into the tail vein tubing and slowly inject the Evans blue.\nInject saline (10 μL) to flush Evans blue.\nRecovery.\nGently remove the tail vein catheter and apply pressure with gauze until the blood stops flowing from the puncture site.\nFor acute studies, the animal is sacrificed by transcranial perfusion.\nFor survival studies, place the mouse on a heating pad for recovery. Return the mouse to its home cage after the mouse wakes up.\nClean the transducer.\nRemove the ultrasound gel inside the coupling cone of the FUS transducer, flush the transducer with alcohol, and wipe and dry the FUS transducer.\nEvaluating FUS-BBBO outcome\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nThe purpose of this step is to evaluate the FUS-BBBO outcome. If the FUS-BBBO procedure is successful, the delivered Evans blue can be clearly observed on the brain slices by visual observation.\nTo evaluate the FUS-BBBD outcome, mice are transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nHarvest the brain and fix it in the 4% PFA solution.\nAfter fixation, cut the brains into 1-mm thick coronal sections using a mouse brain matrix.\nAcquire fluorescence images of brain sections using the LI-COR imaging system to visualize the Evans blue delivery outcome (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).",
    "Quantify the delivery using the Image Studio by comparing the FUS-treated and nontreated sides of the brain on each fluorescence image.\nNote: As an example, we choose the left and right sides of the mouse brain as the treated and nontreated sides, respectively.\nDraw a circle to cover the nontreated right side of the brain on each brain section.\nNote: Three times the standard deviation above the mean pixel intensity within the nontreated region is calculated to represent the background signal intensity.\nDraw a circle to cover the FUS-treated left side of the brain.\nIdentify the pixels with intensities greater than the background signal intensity.\nCalculate the number of pixels with enhanced fluorescence signals in all brain sections to determine the Evans blue delivery volume.\nCalculate the mean fluorescence intensity of pixels with enhanced fluorescence signals in all brain sections to determine the signal intensity of the delivered Evans blue.\nPerform histologic examination using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for FUS-BBBO safety analysis.\nCryoprotect the brain slices with the highest Evans blue fluorescence signals using sucrose solution and embed the slices at −20°C.\nSection the mouse brain tissue into 10 μm coronal sections.\nDip the sections to water for 1 min.\nRehydrate the sections by dipping them into 100%, 90%, and 70% ethanol, respectively, for 1 min each. Dip the sections in water for 1 min.\nConduct hematoxylin staining for 2 min. Flush the section with water for 3 min. Dip the sections in 70% ethanol for 1 min.\nConduct eosin staining for 10 s. Wash with 70% ethanol for 1 min.\nDehydrate the sections by dipping them into 70%, 90%, and 100%, respectively, for 1 min each. Dip the sections in Xylene for 2 min.",
    "Place the stained sections on glass slides. Add a drop of seal solution to each section and apply a cover slide on the section.\nObtain bright-field images of the stained sections using a fluorescence microscope with 2× and 20× objectives.\nPerform statistical analyses to check safety.\nImport the bright-field images into MATLAB.\nQuantify the red blood cell extravasation using MATLAB by comparing the FUS-treated and nontreated sides of the brain on each bright-field image.\nEvaluate the statistical significance via the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test using GraphPad Prism."
