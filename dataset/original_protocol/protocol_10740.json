    "1. System Configuration\nPAOM Subsystem\nIllumination source: a Nd:YAG laser (SPOT-10-100, Elforlight Ltd, UK: 20 μJ/pulse; 2 nsec pulse duration; 30 kHz maximum pulse repetition rate).\nThe output laser at 1064 nm is frequency-doubled to 532 nm by a beta-barium-borate (BBO) crystal (CasTech, San Jose, CA). After further split by a laser line mirror, 532 nm light is delivered through a single-mode optical fiber (P1-460A-FC-5, Thorlabs), and 1064 nm laser is recorded by a photodiode (DET10A, Thorlabs), which triggers PA signal acquisition.\nThe laser light coming out of the single-mode optical fiber is delivered onto the retina by a galvanometer (GM, QS-7, Nutfield Technology) and a telescope configuration (f1=75 mm and f2=14 mm, Edmund Optics)6.\nAn unfocused needle transducer (40-MHz central frequency, 16-MHz bandwidth, 0.4×0.4 mm2 active element size, NIH Resource Center for Ultrasonic Transducer Technologies, The University of Southern California) is placed in contact with the eyelid to detect the PA signals generated from the retina. Ultrasonic gel (Sonotech) is applied between the transducer tip and animal eyelid for good acoustic coupling.\nThe PA signal is amplified by two amplifiers (ZFL-500LN+, Mini-circuits, and 5073PR, Olympus), and is digitized by a data acquisition board (CS14200, Gage Applied).\nSD-OCT Subsystem\nLow coherence light source: a broadband super-luminescent diode (IPSDD0804, InPhenix; center wavelength: 840 nm; 6-dB bandwidth: 50 nm), which determines the axial resolution of 6 μm.\nThe near infrared light is split to reference arm and sample arm by a 50×50 customized single-mode fiber coupler (OZ Optics).\nAfter combining with PAOM illuminating light by a hot mirror (FM02, Thorlabs), OCT sample arm shares the same scanning and delivery optics with PAOM6.",
    "A home-built spectrometer is used to record the SD-OCT interference signals, where a line scan CCD camera (Aviiva SM2, e2v) allows an A-line rate of 24 kHz. Design of typical spectrometers can be found from several previously published literatures11and fiber-coupled SD-OCT spectrometers are now commercially available. The SD-OCT sensitivity is measured to be better than 90 dB.\nScanning Scheme\nFast 2-D raster scanning of the galvanometer is controlled by an analogue output board (PCI-6731, National Instruments), which also triggers both the PAOM laser firing and the signal acquisition of OCT spectrometer. As a result, the data acquisitions in PAOM and OCT subsystems are synchronized.\nThe PAOM data acquisition is triggered by a photodiode recording PAOM laser sequence (see 1.1.2).\n3-D volumetric images or 2-D fundus images are constructed from 256 B-scan images (256 A-lines per B-scan image).\n2. System Alignment\nMaximize the frequency-doubling efficiency of the BBO crystal and the coupling efficiency of the single-mode optical fiber. Wear LG3 goggles (Thorlabs) for personnel eye protection when optimizing the PAOM illuminating light.\nCollimate the fiber output laser of PAOM to 2.0 mm in diameter.\nAlign the combined illumination lights of PAOM and SD-OCT to be coaxial.\nSet the PAOM excitation light at ~40 nJ/pulse and SD-OCT probing light at ~0.8 mW, both of which are reported to be eye safe 6,12.\n3. In vivo Multimodal Retinal Imaging\nTransfer the rat to a transparent polypropylene box, and anesthetize the animal by a mixture of isoflurane (Phoenix pharmaceutical, Inc.) and normal air at a concentration of 1.5% and a flow rate of 2.0 liter/min for 10 min.",
    "Restrain the anesthetized rat in a homemade holder with five-axis adjustable freedom (Figure 1), and keep its body temperature at ~37 °C by a heating pad (Repti therm, Zoomed laboratories, Inc.). Maintain the anesthesia by inhalation gas of mixed isoflurane and normal air with 1.0% concentration and 1.5 liter/min flow rate throughout the experiment.\nCut the eyelash using a surgical scissors, dilate the pupils with 1% Tropicamide ophthalmic solution, and paralyze the iris sphincter muscle using 0.5% Tetracaine Hydrochloride ophthalmic solution. Apply artificial tear drops (Systane, Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) to the rat eye every other minute to prevent cornea dehydration and cataract formation. Monitor the animal heart rate, respiration, and blood oxygenation by a pulse oximeter (8,600 V, Nonin Medical, MN) during imaging.\nTurn on SD-OCT illuminating light and check the probing light to be ~0.8 mW.\nActivate the galvanometer scanning. Align the SD-OCT irradiation light delivery onto the rat retina and identify the retinal region of interest (ROI) by adjusting the five-axis animal holder. Here, the optic disc is intentionally placed in the center of the field of view, while the ROI should be selected based on different research requirements.\nFurther adjust the animal holder to optimize the SD-OCT imaging qualities of retinal cross section in both scanning directions (by switching the raster scanning direction) until the best optical focus is reached.\nPrepare the needle transducer on a five-axis adjustable platform, apply a drop of ultrasonic gel to the transducer tip, and gently contact the transducer tip to the animal eyelid.",
    "Set PAOM laser to the external-trigger mode, start the galvanometer scanning, and activate real-time display of PAOM cross-sectional image of the animal retina. Carefully adjust the transducer orientation until the PAOM image has the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and, in the meantime, shows an evenly distributed PA amplitude patterns in both scanning directions.\nSet the scanning parameters, and conduct the simultaneous retinal imaging of SD-OCT and PAOM. Reconstruct the three-dimensional images of SD-OCT and PAOM off-line. Our reconstruction codes were written in Matlab and three-dimensional visualization was achieved uing a freeware (Volview, Kitware). The algorithm for SD-OCT reconstruction can be found in Ref. 11 and the algorithm for PAOM reconstruction can be found in Ref. 6 and Ref.13. If needed, repeat procedures of 3.7)-3.9).\nAfter experiment, turn off the SD-OCT probing light, remove the animal from holder immediately, and keep it warm until it wakes up naturally. Keep the animal in a dark environment for an extra hour for eyes to recover. The whole experimental duration, including the animal anesthesia and imaging acquisition, is less than 30 min for an experienced operator.\nSubscription Required.
