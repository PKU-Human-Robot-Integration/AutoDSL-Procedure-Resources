    "1. Tissue Preparation and Storage\nFix mouse brain through standard transcardial perfusion13 with 20 ml 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, followed by 100 ml of paraformaldehyde 4% in 0.01 M PBS. Carefully adjust the pH of both solutions to 7.6: slightly lower values of the pH may quench the fluorescence of EGFP.\nPost-fix the excised brains overnight in paraformaldehyde 4% at 4 °C.\nRinse two times (30 min each) in 0.01 M PBS and store in 0.01 M PBS at 4 °C.\n2. Dehydration and Clearing\nNote: the protocol for dehydration and clearing closely follows the one described by Becker et al.10\nTo remove peroxides from the dehydration solvent (tetrahydrofuran, THF), which strongly quench XFP fluorescence, filter THF with basic activated aluminum oxide (activity grade Brockman I, about 250 g/L of THF) using a chromatography column. Avoid cracking of the column, which would reduce peroxide removal.\nAdd stabilizer (butylated hydroxytoluene, 250 mg/L) to the final solution, even if the THF was already stabilized before filtration. Stabilizer is in fact retained by aluminum oxide: THF without stabilizer may develop large amounts of peroxides and can be explosive and dangerous.\nDehydrate the whole mouse brain in a graded series of THF in pure water: 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 96%, 100%, 1 hr each, then 100% overnight. Place the vial with the sample on a rotating wheel. To avoid light exposure, wrap the vials with an aluminum foil.\nFilter the clearing solvent (dibenzyl ether, DBE) with aluminum oxide (activated basic, activity grade Brockman I, about 250 g/L of DBE) using a filtering funnel.\nClear the sample in 100% DBE. Change the solution after 3 and 6 hr.\n3. Specimen Mounting",
    "When the brain looks transparent by eye (typically 1 hr after the second DBE change), mount it on the tipped imaging plate by one of the following methods:\nDirect mounting - Gently plunge the sample on one of the tips (Figure 3a).\nAgarose disc - Plunge a disc made of 6% agarose gel on the tips. Gently fix the sample on the agarose disc with acrylic glue (Figure 3b). Wait about 1 min for curing.\nAgarose beaker - Plunge a beaker made of 3% agarose gel on the tips. Gently place the sample on the bottom of the beaker (Figure 3c).\nNote 1: Mounting in agarose beaker should be preferred when it is important imaging the sample in its entirety; however, the agarose gel surrounding the specimen gives rise to additional light scattering which could be detrimental to image quality. If a small part of the sample could be excluded from imaging, it is better to mount the specimen on agarose disk or directly on the tip. The former method is best suited to keep the brain horizontal (excluding from imaging a ventral or dorsal portion of the brain), the latter to keep the brain vertical (excluding from imaging a part of olfactory bulbs or of spinal cord).\nNote 2: the agarose gel should be prepared in water, then dehydrated with THF (50% and 100% 4 hr each) and cleared in DBE 100% for 4 hr or until it looks clearly transparent.\nAfter mounting the specimen following one of the previous methods, position the imaging plate inside the specimen chamber using tweezers. Fill the chamber with clearing solution.\n4. Tomography Preparation\nRemove the slit to collect as much fluorescence as possible.\nIlluminate the sample with low laser power to prevent photobleaching.",
    "Move the sample in the three directions using the software-driven micropositioning system. Identify for each direction the minimum and maximum coordinates for which the sample is illuminated and is within the field of view of the camera (Figure 4a).\nInsert the above coordinates as parameters for the 'Pre-tomography' subroutine. Specify also the distance between adjacent stacks to be used in the tomography, and the pre-tomography sampling step in z direction.\nStart the pre-tomography, which collects the images in every stack with the z sampling specified at (4.4).\nNote: The collected images are used by a software to prepare a rough map of specimen shape and position (Figure 4b), which allows restricting tomography acquisition only to the volume actually occupied by the sample, reducing imaging time and thus photobleaching.\n5. Tomography Acquisition\nMove the sample outside of the light sheet using the micropositioning system.\nIncrease laser power and stop the motion of all the scanning systems, in order to illuminate only a fixed line at the center of the field of view.\nMount the slit and align it using autofluorescence signal from the clearing solution. You should clearly see the slit line at the center of the field of view.\nRe-activate the scanning system, reduce laser power and move the sample inside the light sheet using the micropositioning system. Note that the laser power used with the slit will be higher than that used without it, since the spatial filter blocks a non-negligible fraction of light.\nAdjust the amplitude and offset of the scanning and de-scanning systems with the control software, until the images look clear and bright.",
    "Run the tomography acquisition software, after setting the appropriate z step for the experiment. The volume will be imaged in many parallel, partially overlapping stacks (Figure 5a), and the images will be saved in a hierarchical folder structure.\n6. Stitching and Visualization\nComplete the acquired volume with synthetic black images (i.e. images of the same type and dimensions of the collected ones-, but with zero intensity) using an automated software (Figure 4c). This step is mandatory in order for the stitching software to deal with a complete cubic volume.\nLaunch Vaa3D software (freely downloadable from http://www.vaa3d.org/[href=http://www.vaa3d.org/]) with the plugins TeraStitcher and TeraManager installed.\nLoad the TeraStitcher plugin. Select the directory containing the imaged volume, indicate the relative orientations of the axes (with respect to a reference right-handed coordinate system) and the voxel size.\nLaunch the first part of the stitching. The software will calculate the relative displacement between couples of stacks, and find an overall optimal placement for all the stacks together (Figure 5b).\nSelect to save the stitched volume in single-resolution or in multi-resolution format. The latter enables for multi-resolution visualization with the TeraManager plugin. In both cases, if the higher resolution image is larger than a few gigabytes, also select the multi-stack save modality and specify the size of individual substacks. This will enable efficient access to the stored data.\nLaunch the second part of the stitching. The software will merge the aligned stacks, and save them in either single- or multi-stack mode (Figures 5c and 5d). At the end close the TeraStitcher plugin.\nLoad the TeraManager plugin. Select the folder with the multi-stacked multi-resolution volume, and indicate voxel size and axes orientations. The volume will be loaded at the minimum resolution.",
    "To zoom to a higher resolution, select a landmark using the right-click modality of Vaa3D, then zoom in using mouse scroll. Alternatively you can directly select the ROI to zoom in with a right-click, or specify the coordinates of the volume of interest.\nTo zoom back to lower resolution, simply use the mouse scroll."
