    "1. DNA-protein Cross-linking\nFix in 15 ml tubes harvested-ES cells (2 x 106 cells for regular ChIP, 2 x 105 cells for microChIP), embryoid bodies (EBs) generated from ES cells and embryonic heart tissues dissected from E9.5 mouse embryos (atrioventricular canal, outflow tract and ventricle) using 1% formaldehyde in PBS for cells or in permeabilization PB2 buffer for embryonic tissues. Place the tubes on orbital shaker at a speed of 60 rpm at room temperature for exactly 10 min.\nStop the cross-linking reaction by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM and incubate for 5 min at room temperature on the orbital shaker at a speed of 60 rpm.\n2. Cell Lysis and Chromatin Fragmentation\nWash twice cross-linked cells resuspended in 10 ml PBS 1x or embryonic tissues resuspended in 1 ml PB2. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatants.\nAdd protease inhibitors to buffer PB1 or PB2 (2 µg/ml Leupeptin, 1 µg/ml Aprotinin, and 0.1 mM PMSF) (Table 1). Resuspend the cell pellet or embryonic tissue from step 2.1 in 1 ml of Buffer PB1 or PB2 respectively. Pipet up and down and resuspend the cells or tissues. Use a 1 ml syringe with a 21 gauge needle to homogenize cells or tissue. Incubate at 4 °C (on a wheel) for 10 min.\nSpin down at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 300 µl of respective SB buffers (Table 1) supplemented with protease inhibitors in a clean tube (certified RNase-, DNase-, and pyrogen-free) to prevent any DNA degradation. Incubate for 15 to 30 min on ice.",
    "Sonicate the samples at 4 °C to shear the chromatin using a sonicator according to programs listed in Table 2 for each material. Adjust sonication duration depending upon the next application (i.e., PCR or sequencing). Sheared DNA size should be around 500 bp for PCR and 300 bp for sequencing.\nCentrifuge sonicated cell lysate for 10 min at 6,000 x g at 4 °C, transfer the supernatant (chromatin) in a clean 1.5 ml tube and discard the pellet.\nDilute the chromatin in solution (supernatant buffer B) for 10 times with water and assess the optical density using 1.5 µl in a nano-spectrophotometer. Obtain the concentration of proteins in µg/µl using the following formula: 1.55 x OD 280 - 0.76 x OD260.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6\nBuffer,Utilization,Composition,Composition,Composition,Composition,Materials\nA,Permeabilization,PB1 : 5 mM PIPES pH 8; 85 mM KCl; 0.5 % NP40,PB1 : 5 mM PIPES pH 8; 85 mM KCl; 0.5 % NP40,PB1 : 5 mM PIPES pH 8; 85 mM KCl; 0.5 % NP40,PB1 : 5 mM PIPES pH 8; 85 mM KCl; 0.5 % NP40,All\nA,Permeabilization,\"PB2 : 15 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2 60 mM KCl, 0.5% TRITON X-100\",\"PB2 : 15 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2 60 mM KCl, 0.5% TRITON X-100\",\"PB2 : 15 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2 60 mM KCl, 0.5% TRITON X-100\",\"PB2 : 15 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2 60 mM KCl, 0.5% TRITON X-100\",Embryonic tissue\nB,Lysis /Sonication,SB1: 1 % SDS; 10 mM EDTA; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,SB1: 1 % SDS; 10 mM EDTA; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,SB1: 1 % SDS; 10 mM EDTA; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,SB1: 1 % SDS; 10 mM EDTA; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,ESC",

Recover the supernatant containing unbound antibody chromatin.\n\tNOTE: Samples can be quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen at that step and stored at -80 °C. Chromatin can be used in other immunoprecipitation assays with other antibody. Wash each sample 3 times with 1 ml of buffer C (manipulation described before).\nElute the antibody-bound protein by adding 150 µl of buffer D1 or D2 if sequential ChIP has to be done (Table 1) to washed ChIP materials and incubate the samples for 20 min at 50 °C in a heating block.",

Add 5M NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mM. Incubate samples overnight at 65 °C.\nNext day, remove samples from the heating block, add 250 mM EDTA to obtain a final concentration of 12.5 mM and proteinase K to obtain a final concentration of 250 µg/ml in the ChIP material and digest at 55 °C for 2 hr in the heating block.\n5. DNA Isolation Using DNA-binding Beads\nPreparation of beads\n\t\nStart to bring the beads at room temperature for at least 30 min, vortex the beads very thoroughly. Beads settle down, so work fast when pipetting. Transfer 1 ml of beads in clean 1.5 ml tube (certified RNase-, DNase-, and pyrogen-free).\nSet on magnet, wait for 2 - 3 min for the solution to clarify, discard supernatant. Remove from magnet, add 1 ml of 0.5 M EDTA and mix by brief vortexing.\nRepeat step 5.1.2 twice, and discard supernatant at the end.",
    "Remove from magnet, add 1 ml of buffer E and slowly resuspend the beads. Transfer the whole mix (beads in buffer E) into 50 ml of buffer E. Place on a shaker and let it mix slowly at room temperature for 1 hr.\nTest DNA-binding beads following the purification protocol described below using 3 experimental conditions: 50 µl of beads/ 50 µl of DNA (1 volume/1 volume), 100 µl of beads/50 µl of DNA (2 volumes/1 volume) and 125 µl of beads/ 50 µl of DNA (2.5 volumes/1 volume). Let migrate purified DNA on a 1.5% agarose gel to check the size of the fragments (Figure 1A).\nDNA Purification\n\t\nAdd 425 µl (2.5 volumes) of DNA binding magnetic beads to each DNA sample (about 170 µl). Resuspend slowly by pipetting up and down (about 10 times) and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nPlace on magnet for 5 min, then aspirate supernatant and discard (on magnet).\nAdd 600 µl of freshly made 80% ethanol to the tube on magnet, wait for 1 min, aspirate supernatant and discard and then repeat the previous step once more.\nGive a quick spin, for 5 sec (microfuge), place the tube on magnet and remove the last drops of ethanol. Let dry for 1 min at RT\nElute the DNA by adding 20 µl of DNase RNase free water. Remove from magnet and vortex the sample.\nIncubate for 3 min at room temperature and then place samples on magnet. Aspirate eluted DNA into a new tube (certified RNase-, DNase-, and pyrogen-free).\nRun the DNA from the input fraction on a 1.5% agarose gel to check the size of DNA fragments (Figure 1B).\n6. DNA Quantification Using a Fluorescence Detection Instrument",
    "Serially dilute in water 1 μg DNA (1 kb ladder) to give a total of 7 dilutions plus a no-DNA point (dilutions gathered in Table 3).\nPrepare a solution of PCR Green I dye, sufficient for all samples (purified DNA and standard dilutions A-H): dilute 10,000x the Green dye in 1x TE buffer.\nAdd 1 µl of each DNA samples (purified DNA and standard dilutions A-H) to 10 µl 1x green dye mix in capillaries cuvettes to be read in a fluorimeter at 488 nm wavelength. For the no-DNA assay, use 1 µl of the 1x TE buffer.\nBuild a calibration curve using a graphic software and determine the relative concentrations to the range of DNA samples in ng/µl. The DNA is then ready for PCR or to make sequencing libraries.\n7. PCR\nSelection of primers\n\t\nDesign primers of interest to interrogate the genomic regions of interest. Design primers to amplify enhancer regions of genes using the UCSC genome browser. Enhancers are further predicted using H3K4me1 or p300 ChIP-seq9 data available in GEO data set.\nPCR\n\t\nRun PCR reactions for 45 cycles (8 sec 95 °C, 8 sec 60 °C, 8 sec 72 °C) using a real-time PCR thermocycler in 25 μl green dye mix, 2 ng DNA, and 0.5 μl primer mix (20 μM stock solution)10.\nAnalysis of enrichment\n\t\nCalculate Absolute enrichment assuming that at most 1% of nucleosome were immunoprecipitated11.\nConsider the genomic as enriched if 10 ng IP samples show a greater enrichment when compared to 0.1 ng of input DNA.\nExpress results as the fold increase in enrichment over a non-enriched region after normalization to the input and adjustment with a non-specific control sample.\nConsider the input DNA to be diluted by 100 (dilution factor or DF).",
    "Normalize the input using the following equation 2-ΔCt x 100%, where -ΔCt = Ct[IP] - Ct[Input x DF].\nAdjust control using the following equation (ΔCt[IP]-ΔCt[NS]) where NS is the non-specific sample (no antibody IP, or IgG IP).\nCalculate the fold enrichment of the sample as 2-ΔΔCt. A file including all steps of calculations with formulas in which only each PCR sample can be entered will facilitate the analysis of results.\nSubscription Required.
