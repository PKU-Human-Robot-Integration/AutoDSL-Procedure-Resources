    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPurification of CD4+ T cells\nTiming: 2 h\nCD4+ T cells are purified from the spleens of aged mice with a magnetic cell separation system.\nSacrifice two mice by CO2 asphyxiation and spray them entirely with alcohol disinfectant.\nNote: If three biological replicates (n = 3) have been prepared, use a total of six mice; two mice for each pooled sample. Of course, the number of mice per pool should be changed according to the number of CD153+ SA-T cells needed. See also Expected Outcomes.\nCollect the spleens.\nIn a sterile hood, collect the spleens in a 70 μm cell strainer on a 6 cm petri dish filled with 5 mL FACS buffer.\nMash the spleens with the plunger end of a sterile 1 mL syringe. Grasp the cell strainer using a tweezer and wash the suspension in the strainer with an additional 5 mL FACS buffer.\nTransfer the total 10 mL of suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nCritical: All steps from tissue collection to cell culture must be performed under sterile conditions.\nLyse the red blood cells.\nBriefly dissociate the cell pellet by tapping the tube and suspend the cells thoroughly in 2 mL ACK lysis buffer.\nIncubate for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 10 mL FACS buffer, mix by inversion and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nBlock the Fc receptors.\nSuspend the cells in 5 mL anti-CD16/32 Ab (diluted 2.4G2 hybridoma culture supernatant).\nIncubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Optional: Count the cells using a hemocytometer. For reference, 0.5–1 × 108 cells are typically obtained from an adult mouse.\nAlternatives: Although we have prepared 2.4G2 in-house, Abs blocking Fc receptors are commercially available.\nLabel CD4+ T cells with anti-CD4 magnetic beads.\nDilute 200 μL CD4 MicroBeads with MACS buffer to a final volume of 2 mL.\nSuspend the cells with the diluted beads and incubate for 30 min at 4°C.\nAdd 10 mL MACS buffer, mix by inversion and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and suspend the cells in 1 mL MACS buffer.\nAlternatives: Instead of CD4 MicroBeads, a purification kit for unlabeled CD4+ T cells is also useful (e.g., mouse CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit; Miltenyi #130-104-454).\nPurify CD4+ T cells by magnetic cell separation.\nAccording to the manufacturer’s instruction[href=https://static.miltenyibiotec.com/asset/150655405641/document_5be6o7abnt1kd79gscorsrvd2t?content-disposition=inline], place an LS column (Miltenyi) in the magnetic field of the MACS separator and rinse the column with 3 mL MACS buffer.\nTransfer the cell suspension to the column.\nWash the column twice with 3 mL MACS buffer.\nRemove the column from the magnet and place on a 15 mL conical tube. Flush out the labeled CD4+ cells with 5 mL MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate the supernatant.\nOptional: After flushing, count the cells using a hemocytometer. A rough estimation is that the total cell number will be 1.5–3 × 107 cells per two spleens.",
    "Note: The frequency of CD4+ T cells in splenic white blood cells decreases with age. We found that the mean frequency ± standard error of the mean (SEM) was 16.74% ± 0.52% in mice at 43–50 weeks of age (n = 8 mice) in contrast to 23.78% ± 0.89% at 9 weeks of age (n = 5 mice).\nNote: This purification step of CD4+ T cells allows the isolation of CD153+ SA-T cells in a shorter time during a cell sorting step. CD4 MicroBeads do not interfere with anti-CD4 Ab (clone GK1.5) in the staining panels (Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) and thus are compatible.\nIsolation and stimulation of CD153+ SA-T cells\nTiming: 5–6 h\nCD153+ SA-T cells are isolated using a flow cytometer and stimulated in vitro.\nStain the cells with Abs.\nSuspend the cells in 300 μL of either staining panel A or B containing all required Abs (1:200 dilution with FACS buffer; Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nIncubate for 20 min in the dark at 4°C.\nAdd 10 mL FACS buffer, mix by inversion and centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and suspend the cells in 1–2 mL FACS buffer.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 35 μm strainer cap into a 5 mL polystyrene tube and keep on ice.\nNote: Although a relatively large number of cells are stained with only 300 μL Abs (approximately 0.5–1 × 108 cells/mL) to avoid rapid consumption of the staining Abs, these cells are stained adequately without any problems for this purpose.\nNote: Anti-B220 and CD11b Abs are added to remove possible contaminants of B cells, myeloid cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells.",
    "Set up a flow cytometer according to the instructions of the manufacturer (e.g., AriaIII[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/content/dam/bdb/marketing-documents/BD_FACSAria_III_User_Guide.pdf]) and institution. Check the cytometer performance with CS&T beads (BD). Determine the drop delay using Accudrop beads (BD). Use a 70 or 85 mm nozzle for sorting.\nNote: We have used flow cytometers with 488/561/633/405 (AriaIII), 488/640/405/355 (AriaII) or 488/561/640/405/355 lasers (Fusion). See also Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] legend.\nPrepare 10 mL culture medium into 15 mL conical tubes for collection. Coat the whole surface inside the tube with the medium to minimize the attachment of sorted cells on to the surface.\nPlace the 15 mL conical tubes on the two-way 15 mL collection device.\nImmediately before loading, add a 1/200 volume of 100 μg/mL PI to the sample tube and vortex it to stain the dead cells.\nIsolate CD153+ SA-T cells using strategy a or b.\nStraight gating strategy.\nMake the plots and gates as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nLoad the sample tube containing the cells stained with panel A.\nSort CD153+ SA-T cells (CD153+ PD-1+ CD44hi CD4+ B220– CD11b–) into a collection tube. Simultaneously, sort PD-1– CD44hi cells (CD153– PD-1– CD44hi CD4+ B220– CD11b–) into another collection tube.\nEnrichment gating strategy.\nMake the plots and gates as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nLoad the sample tube containing the cells stained with panel B.\nSort the enriched CD153+ SA-T cells (Lag3+ CD121b– CD25– PD-1+ CD44hi CD4+ B220– CD11b–) into a collection tube. Simultaneously, sort PD-1– CD44hi (Lag3– CD121b– CD25–) cells (PD-1– CD44hi Lag3– CD121b– CD25– CD4+ B220– CD11b–) into another collection tube.\nNote: Set the sample temperature control at 4°C. A high temperature may cause the downregulation of Ab-labeled surface antigens.\nNote: Sort a sufficient number of the cells (if possible, at least 1.5 times more cells than the actual number you need).",
    "During or at the end of sorting, confirm the successful sorting.\nUnload the sample tube.\nMix the collecting medium well with a sterile 1000 μL tip and add a small aliquot (e.g., 200 μL) to a 5 mL polystyrene tube.\nReload the aliquot and confirm that almost all of the cells are plotted within or close to the target gate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nTake a note of the “total sort count” displayed on the Sort Layout Window.\nBring the Ab-coated culture plate at 4°C to room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nCentrifuge the sorted cells.\nCentrifuge the sorted cells at 350 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nRepeat a for 5 min and b to further remove the supernatant.\nSuspend the cells in culture medium to an estimated concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL based on the “total sort count” (e.g., use 300 μL medium for 6 × 105 counts).\nNote: After the first centrifuge and aspiration step (16a, b), a small but non-negligible volume of the supernatant will still remain on the surface of the tube. The second step (16c) allows almost complete removal of the supernatant and then makes the adjustment of the cell concentration accurate at step 18.\nCount the actual cell number.\nTake 10 μL of cell suspension and mix it with 10 μL Trypan Blue Stain (0.4%) by pipetting. Inject 10 μL of the mixed cell suspension into a hemocytometer.\nAccording to the manual, count the unstained alive cells on a microscope and calculate the actual concentration of the cells.",
    "Note: Almost all of the cells should be alive at this point. The actual concentration is usually somehow lower than the estimation due to a possible loss (e.g., attachment of the cells to the collection tube). See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for more detail.\nAdjust the concentration to 1 × 106 cells/mL by adding culture medium.\nInitiate the stimulation with Abs.\nDilute anti-CD28 Ab 1:250 in culture medium to make a 2× (4 μg/mL) anti-CD28 Ab solution.\nUsing a 10 μL tip, aspirate the coating solution and PBS from the Ab-coated plate.\nAdd 50 μL of 2× anti-CD28 Ab solution and culture medium to the corresponding wells (the former to the wells in blue and magenta colors and the latter to the wells in yellow color in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nAdd 50 μL of the cell suspension to the corresponding wells; now each well contains 100 μL.\nNote: Aspiration should be performed from the edge of the well. There is no need to mix by pipetting after adding the cell suspension.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: As necessary, use the remaining cells for other assays such as cytokine FACS, in vitro survival assays, and RNA extraction.\nHarvesting of the cells and supernatants and assessment of proliferation capacity\nTiming: 3 days for incubation and 4 h for assessment\nThe proliferation capacity is assessed by FACS.\nAfter a 72-h incubation, harvest the cells and supernatant.\nSuspend the cultured cells by gentle pipetting using a multichannel pipette and transfer them to a 96-well round bottom plate (the lid of the culture plate is reused in following steps).\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 × g for 5 min.",
    "Collect 70–80 μL/well of the supernatant and store it in aliquots at −80°C (go to step 35).\nBriefly vortex the remaining cells on the bottom of the plate to dissociate the pellets.\nAdd 100 μL FACS buffer to the wells.\nNote: It is highly recommended to observe the cells under a microscope before harvesting. T cell activation is manifested by enlargement in cell size and apparent cell growth.\nNote: The supernatant should be stored in aliquots to avoid freeze-thaw cycles. Vortexing the plate should be performed carefully to prevent the cells from scattering away from the wells.\nAlternatives: Although the proliferation capacity is assessed by the expression of Ki67, a marker of cell cycle progression, it is also useful to evaluate cell growth with a commercially available kit using an aliquot of the sample.\nWash the cells with FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 × g for 2 min and discard the supernatant by quickly inverting the plate.\nBriefly vortex the plate.\nAdd 100 μL FACS buffer.\nRepeat the steps a and b.\nStain the dead cells.\nAdd 50 μL FVD780 (1:1,000 dilution with FACS buffer).\nIncubate the plate for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nNote: Fluorescence of FVD780 can be read through a filter for Allophycocyanin-Cyanine7 (APC-Cy7) on flow cytometry. Although panel B includes APC-Cy7-labeled anti-CD4 Ab, the fluorescence from the remaining anti-CD4 Ab is far weaker than that from FVD780-stained dead cells at this point and thus cause no problem in excluding dead cells in this flow cytometry assay.\nWash the cells with FACS buffer as in step 22.\nFix and permeabilize the cells.\nAdd 50 μL Fixation/Permeabilization buffer to the wells and gently vortex for 10 s.\nIncubate the plate for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.",
    "Note: Prior to use, the Fixation/Permeabilization buffer is prepared by mixing 1 volume of Concentrate with 3 volumes of Diluent (included in Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set).\nWash the cells with 1× Permeabilization buffer (1:10 dilution with distilled water) (included in the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set).\nCentrifuge the plate at 400 × g for 2 min and discard the supernatant.\nBriefly vortex the plate.\nAdd 100 μL of 1× Permeabilization buffer.\nRepeat steps a and b.\nStain intracellular Ki67.\nAdd 50 μL APC-labeled anti-Ki67 Ab (1:200 dilution with 1× Permeabilization buffer).\nIncubate the plate for 30 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nAlternatives: PE-labeled anti-Ki67 Ab (BioLegend #652403) is also useful to stain the enriched CD153+ SA-T cells (panel B-stained), showing clear separation of Ki67+ cells from Ki67- cells.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nWash the cells with 1× Permeabilization buffer as in step 26.\nWash the cells with FACS buffer as in step 22.\nSuspend the cells in 150 μL FACS buffer and filter them through a 37 μm nylon mesh into a 5 mL polystyrene tube.\nLoad the samples on the CantoII flow cytometer and assess the frequency of Ki67+ cells (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). See also problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2881-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. FACS analysis of Ki67 expression\n(A) Gating for excluding doublet and dead cells. Debris are excluded from the FSC-A/SSC-A plot. Single cells are briefly separated from doublets in plots of FSC-H/FSC-W. FVD780 is used to discriminate dead cells.\n(B) Ki67 expression and cell size. Flow cytometry histograms depicting the frequency of Ki67+ cells and FSC-A/SSC-A plots indicating the frequency of enlarged cells in the FVD780– cell gate are shown. Stimulatory Abs and cell populations (left, cells sorted by the straight gating strategy; right, those by the enrichment gating strategy) are indicated.",
    "Note: Unlike FACS analysis of the cell surface antigens on viable cells, do not add PI.\nAssessment of OPN production\nTiming: 1 day (∼24 h)\nOPN production is assessed by ELISA using a commercially available kit (R&D).\nPause point: The supernatant can be stored at −80°C for at least 2 weeks and thus the experiment can be paused at this point.\nCoat a 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plate with an anti-OPN capture Ab (included in the kit).\nAdd 50 μL/well of a working dilution of the capture Ab to the plate.\nSeal the plate with a plate seal and incubate it for 16–20 h at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Prepare the wells for samples and recombinant mouse (rm) OPN standards (included in the kit) in duplicate.\nNote: Please see the manufacturer’s instruction[href=https://resources.rndsystems.com/pdfs/datasheets/dy441.pdf?v=20230622&_ga=2.141567409.2006994044.1687448462-1869962458.1686922603] for details. Of course, you can assess the production of the other cytokines and chemokines using the other kits.\nWash the plate with 400 μL/well of ELISA washing buffer three times and then remove the remaining buffer by blotting the inverted plate against paper towels.\nNote: We used Wellwash Microplate Washer. It is recommended that a multichannel pipette be used for the following steps to accomplish them quickly.\nBlock the plate.\nAdd 300 μL/well of 1% BSA-PBS.\nIncubating for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nDuring blocking, prepare the samples and standards.\nAfter dissolving, dilute supernatant samples with 1% BSA-PBS; prepare 110 μL or more for each.\nMake 2-fold serial dilutions of rmOPN with 1% BSA-PBS according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: Dilution at 1:100–1:400 is usually appropriate for the supernatant of the cells stimulated by anti-CD3ε/CD28 or anti-CD3ε/CD28/CD153 Abs. Less dilution (e.g., 1:5) is more appropriate for that of non-stimulated cells.\nWash the plate as in step 33.",
    "Add 50 μL/well of the samples and standards and cover the plate with a plate seal. Incubate for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the plate as in step 33.\nAdd 50 μL/well of a working dilution of the biotinylated detection Ab (included in the kit) and cover the plate with a plate seal. Incubate it for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the plate four times as in step 33.\nAdd 50 μL/well of a working dilution of horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (included in the kit) and cover the plate with a plate seal. Incubate it for 20 min in the dark at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the plate five times as in step 33.\nAdd 50 μL/well of TMB solution and cover the plate with a plate seal. Incubate it for 20 min or less in the dark at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Prior to use, bring the TMB solution to room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 50 μL/well of 1 M H2SO4 and mix it with a gentle tapping to stop the reaction.\nCritical: Wear protective groves and carefully use H2SO4 as it is caustic.\nMeasure the optical density at 450 nm using a microplate reader such as the Sunrise Microplate Reader. For correction, subtract the readings at 620 nm from those at 450 nm. Average the duplicate readings for each sample and standard. Make a standard curve and calculate the concentration of OPN in the samples.
