    "1. Glia Cell Culture\nGlial cells can be cultured from different regions of central nervous system. The whole process is shown in process figure.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2111/2111process.jpg\nDay 1 Coating culture plate and coverslips\nDry sterilized glass microscope round coverslips in an autoclave.\nPlate the sterilized coverslips into sterilized 24-well culture plate.\nCoat the coverslips with poly-lysine and incubate for 2 hours under root temperature.\nCoat 6-well culture plates in the same way as step 3.\nWash the coverslips and 6-well culture plate twice with distilled water and air dry in culture hood.\nAdd 200 μL DMEM medium(with 10% FBS) in each well in 24-well plate and 2 mL in each well in 6-well plate and put them into incubator under 37 degree with 5% CO2\nDay 2 Isolating cortex and glial cell culture\nSterilize the positive flow dissection hood.\nTurn on UV light for 20 min.\nSpray all surfaces with 70% ethanol and wait 15 min before use.\nchange tense: Anesthetize rat pups (P2-P6) by hypothermia, and decapitate at the base of the framen magnum using operating scissors.\nOpen the cranium along the sagittal suture using an iris scissor and peel off the skull.\nRemove the forebrain and put them into chilled L15 medium, under stereomicroscope, carefully clean the dura and pia membrane with blood vessels, isolate the cortex and wash several times with L15 medium.\nCut the cortex into small pieces with microsurgery scissor.\nAdd 0.125% trypsin-EDTA prepared with L15 medium into cortex pieces and incubate in 37 degree for 15 min.\nTransfer tissue blocks into 20mL DMEM medium with 20% FBS in 50mL tube, add DNase stock solution to final concentration 10ug/mL, aspirate the tissue solution up and down for 20 times with fire polished glass Pasteure pipette, collect the single cells suspension.",
    "Wash the cell suspension one time with DMEM medium, re-suspend cells in DMEM with 10% FBS, count cells under microscope with a hemocytometer, seed cells at 5000-10000/cm2.  Maintain cells in a 37 degree 5% incubator, change half of the medium 2 times per week.\n2. Dorsal Root Ganglia Neurons Isolation, Culture and Purification\nDay 1 Prepare Culture Material\nCoat the sterilized coverslips with poly-lysine, wash coverslips twice with distill water and air dry, put them into 24-well plates.\nAdd 100μL Neurobasal medium with 2% B27 and 2.5S NGF (50 ng/mL), put plate into 37 degree 5% CO2.\nDay 2 Isolate DRGs from embryos\nSterilized the flow hood in the same way as glial cell culture.\nEuthanize a pregnant rat (E15) by overdose with CO2, sterilized abdomen by 70% ethanol, embryos were isolated from uterus and put into chilled L15 medium.\nIsolate Spinal cords with connected dorsal root ganglia under stereomicroscope and transfer to 35mm dishes with chilled L15 medium. \nCollect single cell suspension and wash once with NBF medium (Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 and 2.5S NGF (50 ng/mL)).\nDay 3 Purify DRG Neurons\n18h-24h after neuron seeding, add a 1 mM concentrated FUDR stock solution to the neuron culture to a final concentration of 20 μM and a final volume of 200 μL.\n72h later, replace half the medium with Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 and 2.5S NGF (50ng/mL) without FUDR. After that, change the medium every other day.\n3. Coculture DRG neurons with glial cells\nWhen glial cell culture reached confluence (around 20 days after seeding), they were ready for coculture with neurons.\n24 hours before adding the purified neurons, glial cells medium were changed to Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 and 2.5S NGF(50 ng/mL).",
    "Purified neurons were collected from culture wells, single cells suspension were obtained by mechanical passing through fire polished Pasteure pipette.\nAfter counting the number, neurons were seeded at 500/cm2 on confluent glial cells in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 and 2.5S NGF (50ng/mL).\nNeurons adhesion and neurite growth on glial cells could be recorded and analyzed at different time points by image analysis software and immunocytochemistry using cell type specific antibodies.\n4. Representative Results\nGlial cell culture: After seeding, glial cells will become confluent around 20 days. Under phase contrast microscope, it was easily identified that different morphological glial cell subpopulations formed different growth pattern substructures and the GFAP positive astrocytes accounted for more than 90% as shown by immuocytochemisty technique (Figure 1, Figure 2).\nDRG neurons culture: In our method, after 72 hours FUDR treatment, the purity of DRG neurons will reach as high as 99% within 6 days, DRG neurons showed their unique morphologies and with high density neurite growth(Figure 3, Figure 4).\nGlial cell and neurons coculture: DRG neurons adhesion and neurite outgrowth occurred readily on glial cells within 4 hours after seeding, careful observations showed that neuron adhesion and neurite growth were influenced by glial cell subpopulations which formed  special growth pattern substructures, this could be easily identified under phase contrast microscope and by immunocytochemistry(Figure 5, Figure 6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2111/2111fig1.jpgFigure 1. Morphology of confluent glial cells. Cortical glial cells were plated on polylysine coated coverslip and cultured for 20 days, note the different growth pattern of glial cells, cells on the left side arranged in a radiated way.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2111/2111fig2.jpgFigure 2.
