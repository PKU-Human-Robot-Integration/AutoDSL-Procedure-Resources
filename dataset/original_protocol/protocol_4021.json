See reference (Longtine et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) for details.\nConfirm proper expression and localization of the construct in positive clones by western-blot using antibodies specific against the tag and fluorescence / immunofluorescence microscopy.\nConfirmation of the functionality of the N-terminal tagged protein by standard yeast genetic methods is advisable.\nHarvesting cells and making noodles\nTiming: [2 days]\nPrepare Resuspension Buffer:\n1.2% w/v PVP-40 (Polyvinylpyrrolidone, ave mol. Wt. ∼40,000 Da), 20 mM HEPES / KOH pH 7.4 (keep at 4°C for months)\nNote: Before using the Resuspension Buffer, add the following solutions to the volume of buffer you intend to use.\n1:100 PIC (protease inhibitors cocktail).",
    "1:100 Solution P (Dissolve 90 mg 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and 2 mg pepstatin A in 5 mL dry absolute ethanol).\n1:1000 of 1 M DTT (dithiothreitol) in water.\nThis protocol is designed to harvest a yeast cell culture and prepare it for milling.\nPrepare synthetic defined medium lacking Histidine (SD-His) from SC-His (synthetic complete lacking Histidine) amino acid mixture following manufacturer's instructions (Sunrize Sciences).\nGrow cell culture in SC-His to at least 3.0×107 cell/mL total. Growth is in an orbital shaker / incubator at 200 RPM, 30°C.\nSpin cultures down at 4000×g, for 10 min, 4°C.\nWash the cell pellet, by resuspending the pellet with 50 mL of ice-cold water. Put the resuspended solution into a 50 mL Falcon tube(s) and spin down at 2600×g, for 5 min, at 4°C. Repeat this step once.\nResuspend pellet, with a volume of Resuspension Buffer at 4°C equal to the volume of the pellet (estimated by eye). Spin down at 2600×g, for 15 min, 4°C. Aspirate all liquid from the pellet.\nSpin down again (just the pellet), at 2600×g for 15 min to ensure all of the buffer is removed.\nCritical: use an aspirator to remove as much liquid as possible from the pellet as excessive liquid interferes with successful cryomilling (next step).\nThe pellets should be free of excess liquid and resemble a thick paste.\nPlace liquid nitrogen in a styrofoam container, cover with double ply aluminum foil and place a 50 mL Falcon tube through a hole in the foil ensuring that the bottom of the tube is submerged in the liquid nitrogen. Allow the tube to cool.\nCaution: exercise care when handling liquid nitrogen, always wear cryo gloves and perform the procedure in a well-ventilated area or a chemical fume hood.",
    "Fill the cooled 50 mL Falcon tube, to the very top, with liquid nitrogen.\nWith a spatula, scoop out the cell paste from step 6 and place into a 10 mL or 20 mL syringe. Squirt the cell paste into the liquid nitrogen in the Falcon tube; this will form “noodles” of frozen cell paste.\nWhen all cell paste is frozen as noodles, decant liquid nitrogen from the tube (try not to lose any noodles; can pour off liquid nitrogen by poking holes into the cap of the Falcon tube, screw on the cap and then turn the tube upside down to pour out the liquid nitrogen).\nDo not tighten the tube cap completely, in order to allow liquid nitrogen to evaporate. Store tubes at - 80°C. Close the cap after 24 h.\nCryogenic disruption of yeast cells\nTiming: [1 day]\nWe use a Retsch PM100 Planetary Ball Mill, with either the 50 mL or 125 mL stainless steel jars. Alternatively, other models such as the Retsch Cryomill or Retsch MM 400 can also be used. For visualization of a very similar protocol, see reference (LaCava et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nFill a rectangular ice bucket about 1⁄4 full with liquid nitrogen.\nDetermine the required volume of the milling jar and number of 20 mm steel grinding beads based on the noodle volume:\nFor 20 mL–50 mL of noodles, use a 125 mL jar, for less than 20 mL of noodles, use a 50 mL jar.\nFor 50 mL noodles use 7–9 balls, 20–50 mL - 9–11 balls, 15–20 mL - 2–3 balls\nPre-chill everything in the liquid nitrogen: immerse the stainless steel milling jars, the stainless steel lid, the milling balls and the storage tube, with the frozen yeast noodles, in the liquid nitrogen.",
    "Pre-cooling is finished when the nitrogen bath is no longer bubbling vigorously.\nOnce everything is chilled, tip the appropriate amount of packed noodles into the milling jar. Place the required number of balls inside the jar.\nWeigh the milling jar (with noodles and beads) and adjust the counterbalance weight.\nBe sure no liquid nitrogen is in the milling jar prior to milling to avoid a buildup of pressure in the jars during milling.\nMilling is completed in 8 cycles:\nwhen using the 125 mL jar each cycle is set to 400 RPM, 3 min plus 1 min reverse rotation with no breaks between rotations.\nwhen using the 50 mL jar the milling settings are: 500 RPM, 3 min plus 1 min reverse rotation with no breaks between rotations.\nNote: You must hear the balls rattling around in the jar. If there is no rattling then add/remove balls to the jar until you hear it rattle.\nCritical: A rattle should be audible throughout the grinding cycle, otherwize the beads and powder are stuck and the powder is not being milled.\nBetween each cycle the jars are removed and re-cooled in liquid nitrogen.\nDo not remove the lid (removal of lid may result in cell material loss).\nTo ensure the lid is chilled use an empty Falcon tube to pour liquid nitrogen over the top of the milling jar while the bowl of the milling jar cools in the liquid nitrogen bath.\nCritical: Do not submerge the jar completely as this will allow liquid nitrogen into the milling bowl and may also result in cell loss.",
    "When 8 cycles are complete check inside the jar – if there is powder stuck to the side of the jar repeat 1 milling cycle at 350 RPM, 2 min plus 1 min reverse rotation no breaks between rotations.\nUse a pre-chilled metallic spatula to move the milled powder to falcon tubes pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen. Store at −80°C until use.\nPause point: the frozen powder can be stored at −80°C for up to a year.\nAntibody conjugation of magnetic beads\nTiming: [3 days]\nNote: antibody-conjugated magnetic beads can be stored at −20°C for months.\nPrepare:\nDynabeads (M270 Epoxy).

For all subsequent magnetic bead recovery steps, use a manufacturer’s recommended magnet to pellet the beads.\nRepeat the sodium phosphate buffer washing step, rock until ready to add antibody solution.",
    "In a round bottom 5 mL falcon tube combine 1× PBS with 1 mg of purified antibody specific for the tag up to 1 mL (in our case, we used either rabbit or llama anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies).\nAdd 1 mL of 3 M ammonium sulfate in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, drop wise while gently shaking the tube. Filter the resulting antibody solution through a 0.22 micron filter.\nCombine the antibody solution with beads in a 15 mL round bottom f tube, seal the cap with parafilm and incubate in a slowly rotating wheel (or equivalent) at 30°C for 2 days.\nAfter the incubation, transfer to a 15 mL falcon tube, and perform the following washes using the magnet from step 32:\nCritical: glycine, tris and triethylamine washes should be performed quickly (no incubation) to avoid excessive denaturation of the conjugated antibodies.\n4 mL 100 mM Glycine pH 2.5.\n4 mL 10 mM Tris, pH 8.8.\n4 mL fresh 100 mM Triethylamine.\n4 mL 1× PBS and place the tube on a rocker for 5 min, next pellet the beads on the magnet and remove the supernatant\nRepeat the wash in 37 d 3 more times.\nFinally, incubate the beads with 4 mL 1× PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min on a rocker.\nRemove the final wash and resuspend the beads in 670 uL 50 % glycerol, 1× PBS and store at −20°C. The conjugated beads are stable up to a year\nAffinity capture optimization\nTiming: [1–5 days]",
    "Note: this analysis assumes the composition of the protein complex is known, e.g. the number of subunits and stoichiometry. The goal of optimizing the extraction condition is to purify the majority of the complex, observed as sharp, roughly stoichiometric bands on a Coomassie-stained protein gel. Please see (Hakhverdyan et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) for optimal purification profiles.\nCritical: avoid primary amines in the extraction buffers, as this will interfere with the crosslinking step (crosslinking is applied to labeled samples only, see below).\nCritical: do not proceed with the protocol unless an optimal extraction buffer is selected.\nPrepare a 50 × protease inhibitor cocktail solution by dissolving a complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL of milliQ filtered water. The solution is stable at −20°C for months. Thaw out the stock immediately prior to use. Note, protease inhibitors are only added to the extraction buffer prior to cell powder resuspension and should be omitted for other steps. Additionally, the extraction buffer added to the frozen cell material should be at 20°C–24°C to prevent the buffer from freezing and aid in the rapid resuspension of cell material.\nPrepare extraction buffers to test. Once prepared the buffers are stable at 20°C–24°C for several months (without protease inhibitors). Some exemplar extraction buffers are listed as follows, but the exact composition to maximally preserve any given macromolecular assembly must be empirically determined. A full description of empirical parameterization of optimal buffer conditions can be found in (Hakhverdyan et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]):\n20 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.15–1 M sodium chloride, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20.\nBetween 0.25 M to 1.5 M ammonium acetate (pH close to 7.0) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100.\n250 mM sodium phosphate (try between pH 7 to pH 8) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100.",

Briefly vortex (30 s) to completely resuspend the cell powder. Once the cell material is resuspended the subsequent steps should be performed at 4 ̊C.\nClarify the crude extracts by spinning in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 23,000 g for 7 min at 4 ̊C.\nWhile the cell extracts are in the centrifuge, aliquot the antibody-conjugated magnetic affinity medium into microcentrifuge tubes (5 uL bead slurry per 100 mg of powder).\nPre-equilibrate the beads by washing them three times with 0.5 mL of extraction buffer:\nAdd 500 uL extraction buffer to microcentrifuge tubes, add 5 uL of bead slurry per tube\nUse a vortex mixer to completely resuspend the beads\nPlace on the magnet and wait for the beads to pellet\nUse an aspirator to remove the supernatant\nRepeat the wash 2 more times, but leave the supernatant for the final wash\nRemove the final wash only when ready to proceed (to avoid drying the beads)",
    "Transfer the clarified extracts to the tubes containing the washed magnetic beads (after removing the final wash). Incubate the mixture on a rotating wheel (∼20 RPM) mixer for 30 min at 4 ̊C.\nAfter the batch binding is complete, place the tubes on a magnet to collect the beads and remove the supernatant. Wash the beads three times with 500 uL of extraction buffer as in step 44. During the second wash, transfer the beads to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and then perform the final wash.\nNote: the transfer to a fresh tube reduces the contaminants in the final elution.\nRemove as much liquid as possible from the beads and elute the protein complexes by incubating the beads with 20 uL of 1× LDS sample buffer (without a reducing agent to prevent IgG leakage) at 70°C. After magnetic removal of the beads, add 50 mM of DTT and incubate the sample at 70°C for 10 more minutes. .\nPerform standard SDS-PAGE to evaluate the affinity capture results (Hakhverdyan et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nExchange and turnover measurement time course\nTiming: [2 days]\nNote: all yeast growth is at 200 RPM, 30°C in an orbital shaker / incubator.\nPrepare stock solutions and growth media:\n50 mg/mL 13C6 L-lysine (K6, 1000×).

For slower/faster cells, the growth interval between harvests needs to be adjusted.\nFor each sample perform the (modified) harvesting procedure:\nNote: the protocol essentially follows steps 9–18, except it is streamlined and adapted for less cell material.\nThe cell material must be kept cold immediately after it is taken out of the incubator. Harvest the cells at 4000× g for 5 min in a 4°C pre-chilled centrifuge.\nNo washing steps are necessary.

    "Solvent A: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water.\nNote: the solutions are stable at 20°C–24°C for months.\nNote: the MS run parameters below have been optimized for Q Exactive Plus and Orbitrap Fusion and would need to be adjusted for a different system.\nResuspend peptides in 5% (v/v) methanol, 0.2% (v/v) formic acid.\nLoad onto an EASY-Spray column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ES800, 15 cm × 75 mm ID, PepMap C18, 3 μm) via an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nSet the column temperature to 35°C.\nSet the flow rate to 300 nl/min.\nElute the peptides with a gradient of 4%–30% solvent B in 35 min, followed by 30%–80% B in 5 min.\nApply a voltage of 1.7–2.5 kV to obtain stable spray of the peptide solution.\nUse either a Q Exactive Plus or Orbitrap Fusion (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) or equivalent to perform online mass spectrometric analyses.\nFor analyses performed on the Q Exactive Plus:\nFragment the top 10 most intense ions in each full scan by higher-energy collisional dissociation.\nDetailed parameters of the method are as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_982_2.csv\nFor analyses performed on the Orbitrap Fusion:\nPerform full scans every 5 s.\nAs time between full scans allows, fragment ions by collision-induced dissociation in descending intensity order.\nPrecursors are detected in the Orbitrap and fragments are detected in the ion trap.\nDetailed parameters of the method are as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_982_3.csv\nUse of MaxQuant for relative heavy-light evaluation\nSearch raw data against forward and reversed yeast (or organism of choice) translated ORF sequences, as well as common contaminants.\nUse the following parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_982_4.csv\nAdditionally, make sure that the time point samples for one experiment are sequentially (alphanumerically) labeled, e.g., a1, a2, a3, ....\nCurve fitting, parameter extraction",
    "Note: the following procedure is intended as a foundation for the mass spec analysis. Depending on the project needs and the particular protein complex of interest, further regrouping/analysis of data might be necessary. The following analysis is provided as a python script here:\nhttps://github.com/zhakhverdyan/protein-dynamics-pipeline[href=https://github.com/zhakhverdyan/protein-dynamics-pipeline]\nPlease follow the instructions in the README.md file for running the script. The final analysis is written in the data_out/Assigned/evidence_poi_grouped.txt file. Following is the description of data cleaning and analysis steps performed by the script:\nFilter out contaminants, decoys, and peptides with no lysine.\nCompute the heavy labeled fraction (HLF) for all remaining peptides using the MaxQuant h/l column:\n  H L F =   h  h + l   =   h l    h + l  l   =   h l    h l  + 1    \nAverage the HLF of the peptides for the same protein.\nLog-transform the HLF and fit a linear regression model with time as independent variable and HLF for time points as dependent variable. Some parameters and statistics extracted from fitting are:\nk (slope) - hourly rate of heavy labeled fraction reduction or the “old” protein reduction, which is taken as the apparent rate of protein turnover or exchange depending on the experiment\nr - correlation coefficient\np value - for the null hypothesis that the slope is 0\nThe final analysis file is split the data into two groups: “proteins of interest” and “other”. This is accomplished by searching Saccharomyces Genome Database gene annotations for keywords provided as an argument by the user; all matching proteins are put into “proteins of interest” group, and non-matching proteins into the “other” group.",
    "Note: the “other” category usually corresponds to abundant cytosolic proteins that commonly co-isolate as contaminants in affinity capture experiments (Mellacheruvu et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). This data is useful as an empirical null distribution. For example, one can use the average and standard deviation of exchange parameters estimated for “other” proteins to conduct a 1-tailed Z-test for the proteins in the “proteins of interest” category, where z score >2 is significantly slower exchange rate than expected by chance.\nParameter interpretation\nFor ease of interpretation, convert the slopes (hourly rate of reduction) of fitted curves into half-lives (the time it takes for half the heavy labeled fraction to disappear):\nThalf = −ln(2)/k [h], where k[h−1] is the slope from linear fits in k4.\nThere are 2 regimes for turnover:\nFast turnover: Thalf < cell doubling time - regulatory proteins, e.g., cyclines.\nSlow turnover: Thalf ≅ cell doubling time - the majority of yeast proteome.\nWe observe 3 regimes for exchange:\nFast exchangers: Thalf <= 2.5 h (or ∼ the cell division time), examples are proteins involved in dynamic processes, such as nuclear transport.\nIntermediate exchangers: residence time 2.5–7 h, examples are flexible connectors in the nuclear pore complex.\nSlow exchangers: residence time > 7 h, structural proteins, e.g., proteins comprising nuclear pore complex scaffold."
