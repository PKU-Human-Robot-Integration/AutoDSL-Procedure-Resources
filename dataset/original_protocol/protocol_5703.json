    "Preparation of the injector glass capillaryThe desired thin top of the glass capillary is formed with the Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller. The program parameters are chosen as follows: Pressure Setting (P) = 500, Heat = 558, Pull = 100, Velocity (VEL) = 120 and Time = 100 msec (agrees with 200 units).The exact position of the Nanoliter Injector can be adjusted with the micromanipulator. At the front of the Nanoliter Injector are a screw clip and a stamp, the position of the latter is controlled by the control computer (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180330/20180330012527_8480.jpgFigure 1. Assembly of the microinjection equipment. A. Magnified view of the control computer; B. Binocular microscope and microinjection equipment; C. Magnified view of the top of the Nanoliter Injector.To avoid air pockets between the stamp and the injection solution, the sharpened glass capillary is filled up with mineral oil using a single-use syringe. Afterwards, the filled glass capillary is clamped over the stamp into the screw clip of the Nanoliter Injector. Exiting mineral oil is wiped away with a tissue. For the opening of the clamped glass capillary, Parafilm is stretched over the back of a Petri dish (size 60 x 15 mm). A small mark is pressed into the Parafilm at the margin of the Petri dish. The glass capillary is slowly moved towards the mark on the Petri dish with the micromanipulator under observation through the binocular microscope. When the glass capillary starts touching the Parafilm, it is put down horizontally on the Parafilm by simultaneously lowering the capillary with the micromanipulator and moving the Petri dish away from the latter. The laid down, forward piece of the glass capillary (around 2.5 mm) is cut carefully with a razor blade.",
    "Subsequently, the mineral oil is pressed out of the opened glass capillary up to around 2 cm with the stamp of the Nanoliter Injector. This run-off can take up to 15 min. The top of the prepared glass capillary is dipped into a drop of the sample solution (2-4 µl depending on the number of Xenopus laevis oocytes to be microinjected). The sample solution is soaked up into the capillary by using the Nanoliter Injector (see Figure 2 for prepared injector glass capillary). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180330/20180330012606_3676.jpgFigure 2.

Prepared injector glass capillary clamped in the Nanoliter Injector with the self-made polytetrafluoroethylene holder.Microinjection of the Xenopus laevis oocytesThe Xenopus laevis oocytes at stage V/VI in MBS buffer can be ordered from Ecocyte Bioscience and arrive cooled the next day. They are kept in MBS buffer at 18 °C (room temperature is set to 18 °C) and used for the sample preparation not later than the day of delivery. For the microinjection, 6-7 Xenopus laevis oocytes are prepared with a Pasteur capillary pipette on a self-made polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) holder (produced by PTFE milling, size 35 x 10 mm, with 1 mm wide and 2 mm high grooves at a distance of 4 mm) in MBS buffer, in which they are shipped, and visually inspected for their state with the binocular microscope (see Figure 2). Xenopus laevis oocytes with initial signs of apoptosis, such as flabby membrane or light discolorations in the dark animal hemisphere of the Xenopus laevis oocyte, are rejected (for comparison of healthy and damaged Xenopus laevis oocytes see Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180330/20180330012736_2674.jpgFigure 3.

    "and C. Light discolorations in the dark animal hemisphere of the Xenopus laevis oocytes as an initial sign of apoptosis are tagged by orange circles. C. Progressed apoptosis in the form of flabby membrane and cell deformation is tagged by a red ellipse. Scale bar = 1 mm.The membrane of the Xenopus laevis oocytes is punctured carefully in the dark animal hemisphere, near the parting line, which separates the animal hemisphere from the light vegetal hemisphere of the Xenopus laevis oocyte. The penetrating glass capillary is moved in the direction of the parting line so that the glass capillary points at the parting line from diagonally above. The injection of the sample solution (typically 50 nl) is carried out in this position by the Nanoliter Injector so that the nucleus in the animal hemisphere will not be injected (see Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180330/20180330012833_4622.jpgFigure 4. Process flow of the microinjection. A. Diagram of a Xenopus laevis oocyte; B. For the microinjection, the glass capillary penetrates the Xenopus laevis oocyte in the animal hemisphere, very close to the vegetal hemisphere, at an approximately 10° angle, tagged by a red arrow. C. Position of the glass capillary (shown in dark blue) during the injection. The glass capillary is removed by carefully pulling it off. Injured Xenopus laevis oocytes are thrown away, while successfully injected Xenopus laevis oocytes are washed carefully with MBS buffer. Collecting in an EPR sample tubeUpon microinjection, three (for pulsed Q-band EPR measurements at ~34 GHz) or five (for X-band continuous wave [cw] EPR measurements at ~9.5 GHz) Xenopus laevis oocytes are carefully transferred into a Q-band EPR sample tube. For this, a slight negative pressure is built up with a pipette controller on one end of the sample tube, which is moistened with MBS buffer.",
    "Initially a small volume of MBS buffer is collected, followed by the Xenopus laevis oocytes and again a small volume of MBS buffer. Care should be taken to ensure that there is no space between the Xenopus laevis oocytes within the sample tube. Furthermore, it must be ensured by visual inspection using the binocular microscope that the cell membrane of the Xenopus laevis oocytes is not damaged through the collection and that no air pockets are in the sample tube. Otherwise, the sample is unusable. This visual inspection must be performed again after the desired incubation time of the Xenopus laevis oocytes at 18 °C.The incubation time has to be selected in accordance with the morphological stability of the Xenopus laevis oocytes upon microinjection and the stability of the paramagnetic spin label in the reducing environment of the Xenopus laevis oocyte. Both are determined prior to the final in-cell EPR experiment (see Data analysis). After the incubation time at 18 °C, the supernatant MBS buffer in the sample tube is removed using a Hamilton syringe in such a way that the MBS buffer just covers the edge of the outer Xenopus laevis oocytes, maximum 1-2 mm distance from the edge of the Xenopus laevis oocytes (finished prepared sample tube see Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180330/20180330015750_3990.jpgFigure 5. Prepared Q-band sample tube with three Xenopus laevis oocytes in MBS buffer immediately before shock-freezing for pulsed Q-band EPR measurementsFor pulsed Q-band EPR measurements (~34 GHz) the sample is subsequently shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in the freezer at -80 °C until measuring without thawing. In contrast, for X-band cw-EPR measurements (~9.5 GHz) at 20 °C the sample tube is sealed with the capillary tube sealing compound at the top to guarantee a fixed sample position within the tube.",
    "Furthermore, X-band cw-EPR measurements must be performed immediately after sample preparation because the stability of the paramagnetic spin label inside the cell and the morphological stability of the microinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes might be time-limited at 20 °C (see Data analysis)."
