    "The protocol presented here follows the ethics guidelines of the Institut Curie. All human samples were obtained from patients enrolled, after informed consent, in studies approved by the Institutional Review Board at Institut Curie.\n1. Blood Collection, Plasma Storage and Cell-free DNA Extraction\nNOTE: DNA extracted from any type of “tissue” can be used (e.g., fresh or formaldehyde-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, cells in culture or blood samples). Here, we provide detailed instructions for blood collection, plasma isolation and storage, and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extraction.\nBlood collection and plasma storage (Figure 2B) \nCollect blood samples in 7 mL EDTA tubes. Two tubes are recommended to collect around 4 mL of plasma.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 10 min at 820 x g within 3 h of the blood draw to separate red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and plasma. The time between the sampling and the centrifugation is critical to obtain high quality cfDNA (i.e., cfDNA not contaminated with DNA released from WBC).\nCarefully pipet the supernatant (plasma) using a 1 mL pipet without touching the WBC layer; around 2 mL of plasma are usually recovered per EDTA tube.\nTransfer the plasma to 2 mL tubes and centrifuge the aliquots at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 15 °C to remove cell debris.\nCarefully pipet the supernatant (plasma) without disturbing the pellet. Distribute the plasma in 2 mL cryogenic tubes and store at -80 °C until needed.\ncfDNA Extraction (Figure 2B)\n\tNOTE: Here, we present the procedure using manual extraction kit. An automated version following the manufacturer's instructions can also be performed for cfDNA isolation.",
    "Put 400 µL of Proteinase K into a 50 mL tube. Add 4 mL of plasma (volume routinely used) and 3.2 mL of lysis buffer ACL (containing 1.0 µg carrier RNA) from the kit. Close the tube and mix by vortexing for 30 s to obtain a homogeneous solution. Incubate at 60 °C for 30 min.\nAdd 7.2 mL of buffer ACB (from the kit) to the lysate to optimize the binding of the circulating nucleic acids to the silica membrane and mix by vortexing for 15–30 s. Incubate the tube for 5 min on ice.\nPlace the column and the 20 mL extender into the vacuum pump. Close the unused positions to allow vacuum aspiration.\nCarefully apply the lysate-buffer ACB mixture into the tube extender (briefly centrifuge the tube to collect the maximum of lysate-buffer ACB mixture), switch on the vacuum pump and allow the lysate to be drawn through the columns completely. Remove and discard the tube extender.\nApply 600 µL of buffer ACW1 to the column. When buffer ACW1 has drawn through the column, add 750 µL Buffer ACW2 and finally add 750 µL of ethanol (96–100%). Then, place the column in a clean 2 mL collection tube and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min to eliminate ethanol.\nPlace the column into a new 2 mL collection tube. Open the lid and incubate at 56 °C for 10 min to dry the membrane completely.\nPlace the column into a clean 1.5 mL DNA low binding tube. Carefully apply 36 µL of RNase-free water with 0.04% Sodium azide (buffer AVE). Close the lid and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 1 min to elute the nucleic acids and store at -20 °C until needed.",
    "cfDNA quantification \n\tNOTE: cfDNA quantification is performed with a fluorometer using the manufacturer’s protocol immediately after extraction or thawing the samples at room temperature (RT), before use. Avoid multiple freeze/thaw cycles.\n\t\nUse the high-sensitivity assay according to the expected cfDNA quantity, which is usually less than 100 ng/mL plasma. cfDNA concentrations range from 2–10 ng/mL for healthy donors but can be as high as 100 ng/mL in patients with metastatic disease.\nEnsure all reagents are at RT and mix 199 µL of fluorometer dilution buffer with 1 µL of dye (200x) per reaction (N number of samples + 2 standards to calibrate the fluorometer) to obtain a working solution.\nVortex the cfDNA solution thoroughly to ensure homogeneity and briefly centrifuge to collect contents at the bottom of the tube.\nMix 5 µL of each cfDNA sample with 195 µL of the working solution.\nMix 10 µL of each standard with 190 µL of the working solution.\nVortex thoroughly all tubes for 2–3 s to ensure homogeneity and briefly centrifuge to collect contents at the bottom of the tubes.\nIncubate at RT for 2 min in the dark.\nRead the tubes in the fluorometer, using the ‘ng/µL’ output mode\nCalculate the final concentration in ng/mL of plasma as follows: ng/µL x 36 (volume of cfDNA eluate) / 4 (volume of plasma extracted).\n2. ddPCR Probe and Primer Design (Figure 2A)\nNOTE: The amplification of the targeted molecules in the drop-off ddPCR assay follows similar principles of qPCR. Each primer and probe is designed with the conventional dedicated software Primer37 (http://primer3.ut.ee/).\nPrimer design\nIn the general settings window, change 'concentration of divalent cations' to 3.8, 'concentration of dNTPs' to 0.8, and 'mispriming/repeat Library' to the correct organism.",
    "In the advance settings window, change both the 'Table of thermodynamic parameters' and 'salt concentration formula' to Santa Lucia 1998.\nChoose a Tm between 55 and 70 °C (with 50 mM for salt concentration and 300 nM for oligonucleotide concentration).\nCheck the specificity of primers using tools such as PrimerBlast.\nAvoid regions that have secondary structures.\nChoose a sequence that has a GC content of 50–60%.\nAvoid repeats of Gs and Cs longer than 3 bases.\nChoose primers with Gs and Cs at their 3’ end when possible.\nEnsure that 3’ ends of paired primers do not have significant complementarity to avoid primer-dimers. Amplicons should be smaller than 150 bp to efficiently amplify cfDNA (mean size is 170 bp8) and DNA extracted from FFPE, which is often fragmented.\nProbe design\n\tNOTE: Hydrolysis probes are labeled with a fluorescent reporter at the 5’ end and a quencher at the 3’ end. They provide high specificity, high signal-to-noise ratio and allow multiplexing if needed. Two-channel droplet readers are compatible with FAM and HEX or VIC dyes as well as analysis of FAM/HEX or FAM/VIC coupled probes.\n\t\nDesign hydrolysis probes complementary to the WT sequence of the target region and the adjacent non-variable region.\nChoose probes both located within the amplicon defined by the primer pair previously designed. Primer sequences cannot overlap with the probe sequences, although they may sit next to one another.\nChoose the strand that has more Cs than Gs. Probes must have a GC content of 30-80%.\nSelect probes that are between 13 and 30 nucleotides in length. Longer probes tend to display higher background fluorescence because the distance between the fluorophore and the quencher affects quenching of the fluorophore reporter.",
    "Select Tm of the probes to be 3 to 10 °C higher than the Tm of the primers to ensure probe hydrolysis during primer annealing and extension. Tm enhancers are recommended to reach the required Tm while keeping the probe short, as shorter probes discriminate single nucleotide variants more efficiently. Probes should not have a G at the 5’ end because this quenches the fluorescence signal even after hydrolysis.\nDesign drop-off probes as follows: 5’-(VIC)-complementary WT sequence of the mutated region-(MGB NFQ)-3’ and reference probe as: 5’-(6-FAM)-complementary sequence of a non-variable region-(MGB NFQ)-3’. Other combinations of reporter/quencher are also possible.\n3. Optimization of the ddPCR Reaction (Figure 2A)\nNOTE: Wild-type and mutant DNA controls used in this step can be obtained from cell lines, tumor samples or commercially available DNA reference standards, for example.\nPerform a conventional PCR on a thermal cycler using the thermal gradient feature to validate the specificity of the PCR product amplified by the primers designed.\nPrepare a unique PCR reaction mix as described below in step 4.1 (without probes) on a wild-type DNA control template for a minimum of 8 reactions to have at least one reaction per temperature.\nRun the amplification using the program described at step 4.3.2 and a range of annealing temperatures around the theoretical annealing temperature of the primers.\nLoad PCR products on a 3% agarose gel to select for annealing temperatures providing specific products.\nPerform a series of drop-off ddPCRs using the parameters described above but this time including both probes.\nUse 100% WT DNA, 100% MUT DNA and a mixture of WT and MUT DNA (e.g., 50% MUT/50% WT) to determine the best conditions for clear separation of WT and MUT droplet clouds.\nChoose a range of annealing temperatures above the temperature chosen in step 4.1.",
    "Select the annealing temperature which allows for specific detection of WT or MUT signals when using 100% WT DNA or 100% MUT DNA and best separation of WT and MUT droplet clouds.\nAnnealing time and primer/probe concentrations can also be adjusted to improve separation of clouds and to decrease the number of droplets with intermediate fluorescence (rain effect).\nEvaluate the background or limit of blank (LOB) of the assay.\nPerform a minimum of 48 individual drop-off ddPCR reactions with a WT control DNA using the annealing parameters and primers/probes concentrations chosen in 3.2.\nFor each reaction, calculate the mutant allele frequency (MAF) as follows: (number of mutant droplets/number of filled droplets) x 100.\n\t\tNOTE: The LOB is defined as the false-positive MAF mean and associated SD from which the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) is calculated. LOB = (mean of false-positive MAF) + 95% CI.\nEvaluate the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay.\nPerform drop-off ddPCR reactions using serial dilutions of MUT DNA in WT DNA, with MAFs ranging from 5% to 0.01% (≥ 8 replicates per condition). Use annealing parameters and primers/probes concentrations chosen in 3.2.\n\t\tNOTE: The LOD is defined as the smallest MAF values for which replicates present average values and SD above the LOB (see Decraene et al.6 for more details).\n4. ddPCR Protocol (Figure 2B)\nNOTE: Similar to conventional ddPCR, the drop-off ddPCR protocol consists of 4 steps: (i) PCR mix preparation, (ii) droplet generation, (iii) PCR amplification and (iv) data acquisition.\nPCR mix preparation\nFollow standard precautions, such as wearing gloves, using a clean PCR hood, clean pipettes, and RNase, DNase-free distilled water to avoid contamination.\nThaw and equilibrate the reaction components at RT.\nPrepare 20x primers/probes mix in distilled water, with primers at 18 µM each and probes at 5 µM each.",
    "For all individual PCR reactions, prepare a sample mix by combining 2x ddPCR supermix (10 μL), 1 µL of 20x primers/probes mix and up to 10 ng DNA sample qsp 20 µL of distilled water.\nVortex the reaction mix thoroughly to ensure homogeneity and briefly centrifuge to collect contents at the bottom of the tube before dispensing. Do not hesitate to repeat this step for each reaction mix before use.\nDroplet generation\nInsert the ddPCR cartridge into the holder and load 20 μL of reaction mix containing samples into the middle wells of the cartridge for droplet generation (green positions in Figure 2B) using an 8-channel pipette.\nAdd 70 μL of droplet generator oil into the bottom wells (yellow positions).\nInsert the cartridge, with a gasket, in the droplet generator; droplets will be produced in the top wells of the cartridge (blue positions).\nAspirate and dispense slowly and gently (to avoid shearing) 40 μL of the droplets from the cartridges into a 96-well PCR plate. Use a multi-channel pipette to optimize the transfer of the droplets.\nPCR amplification\nSeal the final PCR plate with an aluminum foil using a plate sealer immediately after transferring droplets to avoid evaporation. Briefly centrifuge the plate to collect contents at the bottom of the wells.\nRun a conventional PCR amplification on a thermal cycler using the following program: 95 °C 10 min, 40 cycles of [94 °C 30 s, validated annealing T° for 60 s], 98 °C 10 min (ramp 2.5°C/s). Include controls with no input DNA and wild type DNA (≥3 replicates) in each run.\nWhen the run is completed, briefly centrifuge the plate to collect contents at the bottom of the wells.\nData acquisition\nAfter PCR amplification, use the droplet reader to count PCR-positive and PCR-negative droplets, following the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "NOTE: The droplet reader usually offers a two-color optical detection system compatible with FAM, VIC or HEX fluorophores.\n5. Data analysis (Figure 2C and Figure 3)\nNOTE: PCR-positive and PCR-negative droplets are counted to provide an absolute quantification of the MUT and the WT alleles at the targeted region. The assigned droplets are used to compute the MAF in each well. Droplet quantification and analysis of drop-off assays can be performed using the ddPCR R package (https://github.com/daattali/ddpcr) developed by Attali and colleagues9,10. This R package automatically classifies droplets as empty, part of the “rain” (due to inefficient amplification), or as filled with a real positive signal (Figure 3). The following section presenting the different steps of the analysis is a brief version of the descriptive vignette of the algorithm written by its authors (see https://github.com/daattali/ddpcr/blob/master/vignettes/ algorithm.Rmd for more details). Data are exported to comma-separated values files (FileName_Amplitude.csv) and uploaded in the ddPCR package to be analyzed directly in R or through the dedicated web interface.\nParameter adjustments\n\tNOTE: Each drop-off assay design results in specific final droplet distributions and variations in the cloud form, separations or positions is to be expected. To ensure efficient automated analysis, a set of parameters needs to be adjusted. If a well has an unexpected profile, it might cause the analysis of the whole plate to fail, resulting in an error message. The problematic well will have to be identified and removed from the automated analysis.\n\t\nIdentify failed wells using (REMOVE_FAILURES). Use TOTAL_DROPS_T (default value is 5,000) to adjust the minimal number of droplets in each well. Use EMPTY_LAMBDA_LOW_T (default value is 0.3) and EMPTY_LAMBDA_HIGH_T (default value is 0.99) to adjust the metrics that evaluate the expected droplet clouds (empty, MUT, WT) and their quality.",
    "Note: Having too many empty droplets is a sign that there was not enough amplifiable template in the reaction.\nIdentify outlier droplets using (REMOVE_OUTLIERS). Use TOP_PERCENT (default is p = 1%) to adjust the top p percent of droplets having the highest signal value in each signal dimension (FAM, VIC/HEX) out of droplets in the entire plate. Use CUTOFF_IQR (default is 5) to adjust the outlier threshold of the top p percent of highest signal.\nIdentify empty droplets using (REMOVE_EMPTY). Use CUTOFF_SD (default is 7) to adjust the standard deviation of the lower (empty droplets) Gaussian distribution of the Probe 1 values.\nGate droplets using (CLASSIFY). Use CLUSTERS_BORDERS_NUM_SD (default is 3) to adjust the standard deviation of the higher (filled droplets) Gaussian distribution of the Probe 1 values. Use ADJUST_BW_MIN (default is 4) and ADJUST_BW_MAX (default is 20) to adjust the k_min and k_max parameters to estimate the kernel density of the Probe 2 values and discriminate the MUT and the WT cloud of droplets.\n\t\t\nUse SIGNIFICANT_NEGATIVE_FREQ (default is p=1%) and SIGNIFICANT_P_VALUE (default is significance level s=0.01%) to classify wells as either mutant or wildtype.\n\t\t\tNote: In this algorithm, a mutant well is defined as having a MAF that is statistically significantly higher than p%.\nAutomated analysis \n\tNOTE: For each parameter presented in this section, the authors of the ddPCR R package have proposed default values based on their expertise and their data. However, all parameters can be modified to increase the quality of the analysis (Figure 3).\n\t\nIdentify failed wells.",
    "Use four quality control metrics (settings: REMOVE_FAILURES) to identify failed wells; the first one is the minimum number of droplets that a well should contain. The other three focus on identifying valid candidate populations for empty, possibly FAM+ and HEX+/VIC+ droplets. Remove wells that fail to meet these criteria from downstream analysis.\nIdentify the outlier droplets.\n\t\t\nIn order to avoid skewing droplet gating, remove outliers (i.e., droplets with an abnormally high HEX/VIC or FAM value) from further analysis by setting an upper boundary threshold (settings: REMOVE_OUTLIERS).\nIdentify empty droplets.\n\t\t\nIdentify empty droplets to reduce the dimension of the data (in a typical well, they will account for most of the droplets) and eliminate statistical bias due to the presence of a large portion of useless information as only template-containing droplets remain (settings: REMOVE_EMPTY).\nPerform droplet gating.\n\t\t\nClassify the remaining droplets as either mutant, wildtype or rain (settings: CLASSIFY).\nIdentify rain droplets.\n\t\t\nAs rain droplets result from inefficient amplification, exclude from FAM+ or HEX+/VIC+ clouds. Determine the borders of their clusters using their Probe 1 values (setting: CLUSTERS_BORDERS_NUM_SD).\nIdentify mutant versus wild-type droplets.\n\t\t\nAs the highlight of the analysis is discrimination between mutant and wildtype templates, identify all remaining droplets at this stage as either one or the other. Since they should have similar Probe 1 values, use Probe 2 values to best predict their respective nature (settings: ADJUST_BW_MIN and ADJUST_BW_MAX).\nClassify wells as mutant versus wild-type.\n\t\t\nAfter determining which droplets are MUT and WT, calculate the MAF. Using the mutant frequency and associated p-value of each well, it is possible to classify them (settings: SIGNIFICANT_NEGATIVE_FREQ, SIGNIFICANT_P_VALUE) as WT (containing mostly WT droplets) or MUT wells (containing a statistically significant number of MUT droplets).\nExplore and export the data",
    "Explore and export the data as number of droplets, outliers, empty droplets, concentrations or graphs that can be further customized for optimal representation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
