    "The procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.Note: Stock solutions for dissection and isolation of the SAN can be prepared the day before isolation (Recipes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7) as it can take ~1 h to make them. Solutions should be kept in the fridge (~4-8 °C) and can be used for isolation for up to a week. For working solutions, such as the enzyme solution it is advisable to make on the day. All working solutions need to be pre-warmed (in a water bath) at 37 °C before use (~15-20 min). It is critical that CaCl2 (10 µl of 100 mM stock to 2.5 ml-final concentration 400 µM) is added to the enzyme solution, otherwise tissue digestion will be compromised.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191225/20191225230410_2466.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of the protocol for the isolation of SAN cells from a mouse heart PreparationBefore dissection of the SAN, prepare the following Pyrex glass tubes:2 x 2.5 ml of low Ca2+/Mg2+ solution (Recipe 2);1 x 2.5 ml of enzyme solution (Recipe 3 and Note above);4 x 2.5 ml of KB solution (Recipe 4).Beaker with pre-warmed Tyrode solution (Recipe 1).2 dissection dishes with pre-warmed Tyrode solution.Heparin/Xylazine/Ketamine injection (Recipe 8).Assemble tools required for dissection (dissecting scissors, fine forceps, Vannas scissors).Prepare a 12-well plate with laminin-coated coverslips. Coat coverslips with 1 µl of Laminin per coverslip and spread using a P200 tip and allow to dry in the culture hood with the lid off.Heart removal from chest cavityAnesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal injection of Xylazine/Ketamine/Heparin mix (adhere to Institute guidelines).Lay the mouse in the supine position (Figure 2) and spray the chest area with 70% ethanol.",
    "Open the chest cavity by cutting through the rib cage using dissecting scissors and remove the intact heart by holding it at the aortic arch with forceps and cutting just above the forceps using the student Vannas spring scissors. Do not worry about taking extra-cardiac tissue as this can be cleaned later. Rinse the heart in a beaker filled with Tyrode solution. Be careful not to cut/damage atrial appendage regions of the heart.Place the heart, pinned at the apex with an insect pin on a dissection dish submerged with Tyrode solution. The heart should be placed as it would be in the mouse chest cavity (see Figure 2). Remove non-cardiac tissue such as lungs, thymus, connective tissue and fat under a microscope. Make a small incision in the ventricles using Vannas scissors and flush the heart of blood using a Pasteur pipette filled with Tyrode solution. Make sure to avoid air bubbles.Note: The mouse can be euthanized by cervical dislocation without anesthesia if one is careful not to crush the heart tissue. Heparin will prevent blood clots and make dissection/cleaning of the node easier. Tyrode solution used to rinse the heart can be at RT or pre-warmed–we found no difference in the quality of tissue isolated between the two conditions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191225/20191225230438_9176.jpgFigure 2. Dissection of the mouse heart and isolation of the SAN. A. The anesthetized mouse is placed in the supine position and incisions made where indicated (dotted lines) to access the cardiac cavity. B. Removal of the rib cage shows the position of the heart. The heart is dissected by cutting at the aortic arch. The lungs can be removed before or after excision. C. Excised heart showing the right and left atrial appendage (RA and LA), right and left ventricles (RV and LV) and the aorta (Ao). D.",
    "The heart is pinned to the dissection dish- the dotted line shows where to cut to separate the atrial/nodal tissue from the ventricles without damaging the SAN. E. Intact SAN, RA and LA after separation from the ventricles. The incision seen on the left ventricle was used to flush out the blood from the heart before separation of the upper chambers from the ventricles. F and G. The SAN (within dotted area) and surrounding tissue after the fat and connective tissue have been removed. CT, cristae terminalis. IAS, intra-atrial septum.SAN dissectionUnder the microscope, carefully make a horizontal incision using students Vannas scissors at the junction between the ventricles and atria (see Figure 2). The ventricles should stop beating and can be discarded. The upper chambers with the atrial appendages and conduction tissue should continue to beat.Flip the atrial/conduction tissue so that the aorta is facing you with the right atria on your left side.Using insect pins carefully pin the atrial/conduction tissue in a clean Sylgard dissection dish (Recipe 9) containing Tyrode solution (see Figure 2). Place pins strategically on the left and right atria, on the edges of the aorta (see Figure 2) or superior vena cava and inferior vena cava (if present). Do not over-stretch the tissue. Carefully remove the remaining ventricular tissue, if necessary, using fine Vannas scissors.Once the tissue is free of ventricular muscle, cut open the right atrial appendage pocket and re-pin to reveal the Cristae terminalis (CT). The SAN (transparent) will be clearly visible between the inter-atrial septum and the cristae terminalis (see Figure 2).Carefully remove any fat/connective tissue from beneath the SAN.Finally, carefully cut the SAN with fine Vannas scissors and, transfer to a Pyrex tube containing pre-warmed low Ca2+/Mg2+ solution with fine forceps.",
    "Note: The superior and inferior vena cava are not always seen in every preparation, however the aorta should be visible and is ideal to pin at the top. The bottom end can be easily pinned using connective tissue or part of the right and left atrial appendages. When cleaning the tissue use sharp forceps (with no hooks) and curved Vannas scissors, these allow you to cut away from the tissue and prevent damage to the node. It is especially important to be careful when cleaning the underside of the nodal tissue. To do this as thoroughly as possible it may be necessary to unpin the bottom end (or top end) and flip to allow easier access. The node will generally continue to beat for a prolonged period of time (~10-20 min)–this can be important when dissecting for the first few attempts because it allows visualization of the area of interest. If the node stops beating, it can be restarted by gently pipetting fresh Tyrode solution on to it.Enzyme digestion of SAN tissue (see the schematic Figure 1)All solutions should be pre-warmed at 37 °C in a water bath.Place the SAN tissue into a pre-prepared Pyrex tube containing low Ca2+/Mg2+ solution. Incubate for 2 min at 37 °C (in the water bath). Using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette carefully transfer the tissue in to the second low Ca2+/Mg2+ tube for a further 4 min.Transfer the SAN tissue in to the enzyme solution for 10-15 min at 37 °C. Agitate manually every 2-3 min with a fire polished Pasteur pipette. The tissue should start to look less structurally rigid.Wash the tissue 4 times in the KB solution. The first 3 washes should be for 2 min followed by a fourth and final wash for 4 min.",
    "Transfer the tissue and KB solution from the final wash to a 5 or 10 ml glass vial. Gently triturate (pipette up and down) the tissue with an appropriately sized (see Notes) fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette for ~30-60 s, avoiding air bubbles. Allow the cell suspension to rest at room temperature for 5 min.Re-adaptation of SAN cellsTransfer the triturated cell suspension to a 15 ml Falcon tube.Cumulatively add the following volumes of the NaCl/CaCl2 solution (Recipe 5) to the Falcon tube containing the cell suspension and place on the rocking platform.25 µl for 4 min50 µl for 4 min70 µl for 4 min90 µl for 4 minAdd 360 µl of Tyrode-BSA (Recipe 6) to the cell suspension and place on the rocker for 4 min.Centrifuge the cell suspension at ~60-70 x g for 7 min. There should be a small pellet of cells.Carefully remove 2-2.2 ml of the supernatant using a 1 ml Gilson Pipetman (~0.8-1 ml supernatant should remain).Gently re-suspend the pellet of cells in the remaining supernatant using 1 ml Gilson Pipetman and place roughly an equal amount (~60-80 µl) on the pre-prepared laminin coated coverslip (within a 12-well culture plate). Incubate the plate at 37 °C (95% O2/5% CO2) cell culture incubator for ~30-45 min to allow cells to adhere to the coverslips.Check cells under the microscope (using the 20x objective) to see if cells are viable–cells should. Add 1 ml/well of pre-warmed storage solution (Recipe 7) or Tyrode-BSA. Cells are now ready to use.Morphologically SAN cells consist of 3 types: Spindle-shaped, spider-like and elongated (see Figure 3).Note: We found that placing the cells in Tyrode-BSA was just as effective as placing them in storage solution.",
    "The number of total cells can be very variable depending on the success of the preparation, however on average we expect to see ~100-120 (5-10 per coverslip) viable cells per preparation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200101/20200101181236_5651.jpgFigure 3. Morphologies of the three types of acutely isolated single SAN cells from mouse heart. A. Spindle-shaped. B. Spider-like. These cells have 1 or more processes. C. Elongated spindle-shaped. Healthy cells beat spontaneously. Scale bar: 20 µm."
