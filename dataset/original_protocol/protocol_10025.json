    "All animal work was conducted in accordance with protocols reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine.\n1. Fabrication of the mesofluidic device\nDesign the mask of the mold for PDMS device using a 3D CAD software.\nPrint the mold using stereolithography equipment with a thermal resistant resin.\n\tNOTE: The procedures described here were carried out by a commercial 3D printing service.\nMix thoroughly a PDMS monomer solution with the curing agent in a 10:1 ratio. 3 mL of PDMS mixture was required for fabrication of the device. The total volume depends on the number of the molds to be fabricated.\nDegas the mixture by applying a vacuum with the use of an in-house laboratory vacuum or vacuum pump in a vacuum desiccator for 1 hour.\nDab the surface of the mold with an adhesive tape to remove dust, and then pour the PDMS mixture to the mold. If bubbles are introduced in the process, repeat degassing in the vacuum desiccator. Bubbles trapped between pillars of the mold can be removed by poking them with a sharp needle.\n\tNOTE: The degassing process at room temperature should be done within 1 hour or less.\nCure the PDMS by heating at 80 °C for 2 hours. Allow the mold to cool down at room temperature.\nCut the boundary between the mold and PDMS with a blade and then peel off PDMS from the mold carefully.\nTrim the PDMS part to fit the 22 mm x 22 mm coverslip and punch a hole at the inlet.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.",
    "Clean the PDMS part and 22 mm x 22 mm coverslip by wiping the surfaces with low-lint tissues and 70% ethanol. Then remove large dust particles by dabbing with an adhesive tape.\nSterilize the PDMS part and coverslip by either autoclaving (121 °C for 8 minutes wet, 15 minutes dry) or exposure to UV light for 1 hour.\nTreat the bottom surface of the PDMS part and cover slip with corona discharge gun for 5 min in the tissue culture hood and then bond them together.\n\tCAUTION: Lay any non-conducting material such as polystyrene foam on the bottom and remove all conducting materials during this process. Inject collagen into the device immediately, within 5 minutes, after the treatment to increase the bonding between collagen gel and glass coverslip.\n2. Cell preparation: primary mammary organoid isolation\nNOTE: The details of mammary organoid isolation can be found in a previous work11. Any kind of single cell or organoid can be prepared according to their own isolation/detachment protocols.\nMince the mammary gland tissue of the mice with a scalpel until the tissue relaxes and shake it for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mL of collagenase/trypsin solution (10 mL per mouse) in DEME/F12 supplemented with 0.1 g of trypsin, 0.1 g of collagenase, 5 mL of FBS, 250 μL of 1 μg/mL insulin, and 50 μL of 50 μg/mL gentamicin.\nCentrifuge the collagenase/trypsin solution at 1,250 x g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant by aspiration. Disperse cells in 10 mL of DMEM/F12, and centrifuge at 1,250 x g for 10 min. After removing DMEM/F12 by aspiration, re-suspend cells in 4 mL of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 40 μL of DNase (2 units/μL).\nShake the DNase solution by hand for 2-5 min and then centrifuge at 1,250 x g for 10 min.",
    "Separate organoids from single cells through four differential centrifugations (pulse to 1,250 x g and stop the centrifuge 3-4 s after it reaches the intended speed). Between each pulse, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of DMEM/F12.\nRe-suspend the final pellet in the desired amount of growth medium of DMEM/F12 with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% insulin- transferrin-selenium-X for collagen preparation.\n3. Collagen preparation and injection\nNOTE: Other types of ECM gels can be prepared according to their own gelation protocols.\nPrepare collagen type I solution (3.78 mg/mL), 10x DMEM, 1 N NaOH solution, normal growth medium on ice.\n\tNOTE: Keep on ice until the procedure is completed.\nAdd 6 μL of 1 N NaOH solution, 200 μL of growth medium and 50 μL of 10x DMEM into a pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube and mix the solution thoroughly.\nAdd 425 μL of collagen into the pre-mixed solution and mix thoroughly by pipetting.\nCentrifuge the collagen mixture briefly (less than 5 seconds) to separate and remove bubbles from the mixture.\nKeep the neutralized collagen solution on ice for 1 hour to induce fiber formation.\nAdd 50 μL of cell suspension into the collagen mixture and mix thoroughly.\n\tNOTE: The final collagen concentration is 2 mg/mL.\nInject the solution using 200 μL pipet through the inlet of the PDMS device until the whole chamber is filled in. If the collagen mixture overflows through the gaps of pillars, cut out the excess collagen gel with sharp surgical blade after gelation.\nKeep the device in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 hour to induce gelation.\nFill the reservoirs on both sides with growth medium and keep the device in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until confocal imaging is performed.\n4. 3D imaging and quantification",
    "Install a live-cell imaging culture chamber to a confocal microscope and pre-set the temperature and CO2 to 37 °C and 5%, respectively. To get humidity up, add water in the reservoir of the chamber and place wet wipes in the chamber if necessary.\nPlace the PDMS device in the chamber and add EGF to one of the reservoir as a ‘source’ of the EGF in the gradient formation. The other reservoir will serve a ‘sink’ needed for development of the spatially graded EGF distribution. 2.5 nM of EGF was added in the sink for making the gradient of 0.5 nM/mm in this study.\nSet the range of Z-stack covering the volume of organoids of interest and start the imaging.\n\tCAUTION: To avoid phototoxicity, try a lower laser intensity in confocal imaging or use multi-photon imaging techniques.\nReconstruct a 3D image from 2D image stacks using either commercial software or a custom-made program. Measure the length and angle of branches extending from the organoids or migration of individual cells. Here, perform quantification by drawing a freehand outline around the organoid body using ImageJ.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
