    "Culture conditions\nCells used: HEK-293 cells\n1. One day before the transfection experiment, adjust the cell concentration, and plate the cells so that cells are approximately confluent at the time of transfection.  For example, plating 2-5×106 cells in a 60-mm culture dish in 3 ml of medium overnight will achieve the desired density of 60-80% confluency.\n  \nPlasmids used:\n1.: pUBC-RedFLuc-t2A-tdtomato -A plasmid expressing a red-emitting firefly luciferase \\(emission max 617 nm) under control of the Ubiquitin promoter and co-expressing  a red fluorescent protein \\(tdtomato) using a T2A element \n2.  pCMV-GLuc:  A plasmid expressing Gaussia luciferase \\(a secreted luciferase) under control of the CMV promoter\n  \n3.  pCMV-VLuc: A plasmid expressing Cypridina luciferase, a secreted luciferase under control fo the CMV promoter\n  \nTransfection of experimental cells\n1. The following protocol is for 60 cm dish \\(culture medium: 5 ml). If you use 6-well or 12-well plates, total volume of the medium should be 2 ml and 1 ml, respectively, and decrease the amount of each reagent accordingly.\n  \n2. Plate cells the night before to give 60-80% confluence at the day of transfection. The efficiency will decrease if reached 100% confluence. Less than 50% confluence may be OK but the amount of protein expressed will be low because of the small numbers of cells.\n  \n3. Prior to the transfection, change to medium. Volume should be 4 ml per dish.\n  \nFormation of transfection complexes:\n4. To a  small sterile tube and pipet 0.6 ml of serum-free high glucose DMEM  and add  1 ug each of pUBC-RedFluc, pCMV-GrRenLuc and pCMV-GLuc , Mix well by flicking the tube 12 times to create a vortexing action\n  \n5. Add 6 µl of the transfection reagent \\(Targefect F-2 from Targeting Systems),  Mix well again by flicking the tube 122 times to create a vortexing action.",
    "6. Incubate the transfection reagent:DNA complex for 25 min at 37 o C \n  \nAddition of transfection complex to cells\n7. Add this 0.6 ml of transfection complex directly to the cells drop wise through the medium. Make sure you evenly sprinkle the droplet over the entire area. There is no need to remove and replace with fresh medium.\n  \n8. Incubate for 36-48 h. Harvest cells, \n  \nTLAR-1 Protocol: FORMAT-1\nAssay of Cypridina luciferase, Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase in the same sample of cell lysate\nKit Contents:\n•FLAR-1 reagent \\(Firefly luciferase assay reagent)  50 ml\n•Renilla luciferase assay reagent:  Renilla assay dilution buffer 60ml, 100 X RLAR substrate \\(coelenterazine) 600 ul\n•Cypridina luciferase assay reagent :  VLAR-1 assay dilution buffer 40ml, Cypridina substrate dilution buffer 20 ml, 100 X Cypridina luciferin\nStop and glow format\n1. Try to keep sample size at 20 ul or less.  Aspirate supernatant from transfected cells, wash once and lyse cells with 1X CLR \\(Cell lysis buffer) from Targeting Systems.  Add 100 ul of cell lysis buffer per well of a 48-well dish. Shake at 400 rpm for 15-20 mins to lyse cells .  Lysis is passive and no scraping is necessary. Pipette out 20 ul of cell lysate into 96-well dishes for assay\n  2. Assay cell lysates for Cypridina Luciferase as per the VLAR-1 protocol. \n  Add 40 ul VLAR buffer followed 20 ul Vargulin substrate prepared by diluting 100X Vargulin with the Cypridina substrate dilution buffer).  \\(Alternately you can premix 40 ul of the VLAR-1 buffer with 20 ul of the diluted Cypridina luciferin and add 60 ul of the mixture to each sample \\(In the latter case the reagent has to be used within 20 minutes of mixing the two solutions)\n3. Wait for 20-25 minutes.",
    "4. Assay for Firefly Luciferase by adding 50 ul of the FLAR reagent.  The firefly luciferase assay reagent \\(FLAR-1) is supplied as a ready to use reagent which simply needs to be thawed and used\n  \n5. Assay for Renilla Luciferase by adding 60 ul of the Renilla luciferase assay reagent prepared by diluting 100 ul of the 100X substrate with 10 mL of the RLAR plus Stop buffer.  The Renilla reagent stops the firefly reaction and measures Renilla luciferase.\n  \nTLAR-1 ASSAY:  FORMAT-2\nKit Contents for Format 2:\nTLAR Buffer\n\\(contains everything except coelenterazine and Vargulin \\(Cypridina luciferin) which have to be added to the required amount of reagent just before the assay.\n100x Cypridina luciferin Substrate\nCypridina Substrate Dilution Buffer\n100X Coelenterazine Substrate\nLyse cells as outlined in protocol for Format-1 above.  \nPipette 10 ul fo cell lysate into wells of a 96-well plate \\(or in luminometer tubes)\nPrepare woring TLAR reagent by Mixing 5 ml of TLAR-1 single buffer with 50 ul of 100X coelenterazien and 20 ul of 100 X Cypridina Luciferin \\(Vargulin).  \nAdd 50 ul of the working TLAR-1, format-2 reagent to each well.  Mix well adn read immediately to measure luciferase acitivity.  Cypridina luciferase activity must eb measure first, followed by Renilla and then firefly.  The recommended filters are as follows:\nSuggested Filters for spectrally resolving luciferase activities:\nRed Luciola luciferase - 617 nm long pass filter\nGreen Renilla luciferase - 540 nm narrow band with filter\nCypridina luciferase - 450 nm short pass filter"
