    "1. Preparation of Dig-TMP\nMix 50 mg (0.18 mmoles) of 4'-chloromethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen and 590 mg (2.7 mmoles) of 4,7,10-trioxa-1,13-tridecanedi-amine in a dry 25 mL round-bottom flask under nitrogen. Add 10 mL toluene and reflux for 12 h. Remove solvent in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure.\nPurify the residue by flash column chromatography over silica gel. Elute the column with chloroform, methanol, and 28% ammonia solution (9:1:0.5). Evaporate the solvent in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure, and recover the pure 4'-[N-(13-amino-4,7,10-trioxatrideca)]aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen as a pale yellow viscous liquid.\nMix 5.5 mg (0.012 mmoles) of 4'-[N-(13-amino-4,7,10-trioxatrideca)]aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen with 5 mg (0.008 mmoles) of digoxigenin NHS ester in a dry round-bottom flask under nitrogen. Add 0.5 mL anhydrous dimethyl formamide (DMF) and 3.4 µL of trimethylamine and stir at 50 °C for 18 h.\nRemove solvent in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure.\nDissolve the residue in minimum amount of dichloromethane. Apply the solution in 2 µL spots horizontally across the bottom of a preparative thin layer plate with silica gel as a stationary phase. Run the preparative TLC in chloroform: methanol: 28% ammonium hydroxide (8:1:0.1).\nMask the plate except for the vertical edges and identify the band of product with short wavelength UV 254 nm lamp. Scrape the product from the plate with a spatula and isolate the pure product using chloroform: methanol: 28% ammonium hydroxide (8:1:0.1) mixture.\nRemove solvents in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. Dissolve the residual pellets in 1 mL of 50% EtOH:H2O, dispense into 50 µL aliquots in 1.5 mL tubes (~20 aliquots) and dry in a centrifugal evaporator until all solvent is evaporated (~3 h).",
    "Redissolve each aliquot in 200 µL of 50% EtOH:H2O and dry again in a centrifugal evaporator. Dissolve each aliquot again in 200 µL of 50% EtOH:H2O, dry in a centrifugal evaporator and store pellets at -20 °C for long term storage.\nFor use, dissolve the pellet in 50 µL of 50% EtOH:H2O. Prepare a 1:100 dilution of the dissolved Dig-TMP in H2O and measure OD at 250 nm. The extinction coefficient of Dig-TMP is 25,000. The solution is stable for about a month if stored at -20 °C. Verify the concentration by measuring OD at 250 nm before each use.\nCalculate stock concentration: Abs x 100 x106/25,000 = Concentration (in µM). Typically the stock solution is about 3 mM. It is important to be in this range in order to minimize the volume of EtOH added to the medium.\n2. Laser Localized Dig-TMP ICLs\nPerform laser localization with a confocal microscope with a SRS nitrogen laser (337 nm) pumped through a dye cell emitting a line of 365 nm and firing 3 ns pulses at 10 Hz, with a power of 0.7 nW.\nMake a vertical mark on the side of a 35 mm glass bottomed cell culture dish with a marking pen. Scratch a cross in the center of the glass on the culture surface with a diamond pen such that the black stripe on the side of the dish is at the top of one arm of the cross. The cross is marked on the growth surface of the glass so that it and the cells will be in the same focal plane.\nSterilize the plate after marking with a rinse of 70% EtOH. Dry before plating cells.",
    "Plate cells (standard laboratory strains such as HeLa or U2OS) in the cross marked culture dishes one or two days before. Cell should be actively dividing and 50-70% confluent on the day of the experiment. Incubate 24 h with 1 µM 5-chloro-2-deoxyuridine (CldU) to uniformly label DNA.\nAdd Dig-TMP in 50% EtOH: H2O to cell culture medium to a final concentration of 20 µM. Bring the medium to 37 °C. Change the medium over the cells and place in incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 30 min to allow the Dig-TMP to equilibrate.\nWhile the cells are incubating, establish the x/y coordinates of the field of view in which the laser is active. Follow the manufacturer's calibration procedure in which the laser is directed by the software to etch a mirrored glass slide along a horizontal and diagonal line. The two lines define the boundaries of the field in which the laser can strike a target.\nPlace the plate in the environmental chamber, at 37 °C with controlled CO2 and humidity, on the microscope stage and focus with the 60X oil objective on the intersection of the cross.\nDirect the 365 nm laser beam to an ROI, established by the investigator with the shape tool in the software, to form a stripe of 3 µm x 0.6 µm. The outline of the ROI is placed by the cursor in nuclei of cells located in the immediate vicinity of the intersection of the cross. Adjust the z focal plane to target the laser midway through the nucleus. Use a laser in the range of 350-370 nm. 405 nm lasers cannot induce crosslinks 19.\n\tNOTE: We locate the ROI in nucleoplasmic areas outside the nucleoli, which can be distinguished from nucleoplasm in differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging.",
    "Verify the focus and activity of the laser by increasing the power setting to a level sufficient to obliterate a cell (the cell will darken and then disappear). This is an important diagnostic for an unimpeded light path for the laser through the microscope and then through the coverslip and into the cells.\nLower the power setting to just enough to activate the psoralen and the ICL induced DDR (this must be determined empirically for each laser/microscope combination). Use a laser intensity setting (1.7% here) that does not activate the DDR in the absence of psoralen (monitored by the formation of γ-H2AX).\n\t\tNOTE: This is an important determination and the settings may require adjustment if the laser source or a component in the light path is changed. Follow the accumulation of GFP tagged repair proteins such as XPC or FAN1, both of which are rapidly recruited (in seconds) to the laser psoralen stripes, but not to ROI exposed to the laser alone. Some proteins of the DDR appear within seconds, while several minutes may be required for others. It is necessary to perform time course determinations for each protein of interest. We also note that in cells that were not exposed to the laser there are no stripes of responding proteins.\nAfter all cells in a field have been targeted move the plate to a new field, staying close to the intersection of the cross.\nIn experiments designed to determine the distribution of inter lesion distances expose cells to the laser in 20-25 fields (4-5 cells/field) around the intersection. In order to analyze replication patterns in the vicinity of the localized ICLs incubate cells with 10 µM 5-Iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IdU) after laser firing.",
    "NOTE: The time of incubation with IdU is somewhat arbitrary. We have used as short as 20 min and as long as 60 min (see below). Longer pulses (a few hours) often result in multiple replication tracts coalescing, thus losing the opportunity to image the progress of single forks. In some experiments ces are labeled with CldU for 24 h to uniformly label DNA prior to exposure to Dig-TMP followed by pulse labeling of replication tracts.\n3. Harvest of Cells and Stretching of DNA Fibers\nRemove the plate from the stage, remove the medium, and wash with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Remove the PBS solution. Place a 10 µL drop of a commercial trypsin/EDTA solution on the intersection of the cross in the middle of the glass surface.\nIncubate for 3-4 min at room temperature (RT) and then draw the trypsin solution with the detached cells into the pipet tip. There is no need to neutralize the trypsin.\nPlace the drop of trypsin/EDTA with the cells at one end of a silanized glass microscope slide. Lyse the cells and release the DNA by addition of 10 µL of 0.5% SDS solution and incubate for 3-4 min at RT mixing gently with the pipet tip, allowing the periphery of the pool to dry.\nTilt the slide 20º and allow the liquid to run down to the end. The DNA fibers are extended/stretched by the hydrodynamic forces of the flowing liquid. Let the slides air dry (~10 min) and fix in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid for 10 min. Remove the slides from the fix solution and air dry again. At this point they can be stored indefinitely in 70% EtOH at -20 °C. On removal from the 70 % EtOH allow to air dry before the next step.",
    "Wash slides in PBS, and then denature in 2.5 M HCl for 1 h at RT. This treatment depurinates DNA making the incorporated halogenated nucleobases accessible to antibodies.\nNeutralize slides in 0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Wash twice in PBS/0.5% Tween-20 (PBST) for 5 min each.\nBlock slides with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% goat serum in PBS. Cover the slides gently with a parafilm to spread the blocking solution evenly over the slide and incubate for 1 h at RT.\nPipet 100 µL of 1:200 dilution in blocking solution of rat anti-bromodeoxyuridine (specifically detects CldU) primary antibody to each slide. Cover the slides gently with a parafilm to spread the dilution evenly over the slide and incubate in a humidified chamber for 1 h at RT. Remove the parafilm and wash the slides three times in PBST for 5 min each.\nPipet 100 µL of diluted (1:100) goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 647 in blocking solution to each slide. Cover the slides gently with a parafilm and incubate for 45 min at RT. Wash the slides three times in PBST for 5 min each.\nPipet 100 µL of diluted (1:40) mouse anti-bromodeoxyuridine (detects ldU and CldU. This dual specificity necessitates the blocking of CldU by the rat anti BrdU in the prior incubation) primary antibody and rabbit anti-DIG antibody (1:200) in blocking solution to each slide. Cover the slides gently with a parafilm and incubate in a humidified chamber for 1 h at RT. Wash the slides three times in PBST for 5 min each.",
    "Pipet 100 µL of diluted (1:100) goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 andc(1:5,000) goat anti-rabbit probe (e.g., Qdot 655) in blocking solution to each slide. Cover the slides gently with parafilm and incubate for 45 min at RT. Wash the slides three times in PBST for 5 min each.\nDrain excess PBST onto a paper towel. Add 50 µL of antifade mounting medium onto each slide and cover with a coverslip. Image or store for no more than 48 h at -20 °C.\n4. Fiber Imaging by Fluorescence Microscopy\nPerform image acquisition through a 63X objective on an inverted microscope with an attached fully motorized filter wheel with FITC, Cy5 and Q Dot 655 detection. The excitation filter is 425 nm, and the emission filter is 655 nm with 20 nm centered at the emission peak 20.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
