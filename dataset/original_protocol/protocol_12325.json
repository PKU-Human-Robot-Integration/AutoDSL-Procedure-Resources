    "Information on all material used is given in Table 1. All animal experiments were performed under the authority of a U.K. Home Office project license.\n1. CatnB Deletion using the Ah-cre and vil-Cre-ERT2 Systems\nCross the mice strains to generate 10 - 14 week old cohorts of Ah-cre+CatnB+/+, Ah-cre+CatnBflox/flox, vil-Cre-ERT2CatnB+/+ and vil-Cre-ERT2CatnBflox/flox.  For visual analysis of recombination, via a β-gal­ stain, cohorts should contain the Rosa26R-lacZ  reporter17.  Cohorts should control for the presence of modified genes and use of induction agents, the size of cohorts required should be estimated using a power analysis.\nTo induce the Ah-cre transgene prepare β-Naphthoflavone (BNF), or for the vil-Cre-ERT2 transgene tamoxifen (TAM) in corn oil to give a working solution of 10 mg/ml. NOTE: The agents should be weighed out in a fume hood using appropriate personal protection.\nHeat solutions in an amber bottle (BNF is light sensitive) to either 99.9 °C for BNF or 80 °C for TAM in a water bath.\nTransfer to a heated stirrer set at 100 °C for BNF, or 80 °C for TAM, and stir for 10 min.\nFor BNF repeat 1.3-1.4 until dissolved (can take >1 hr).\nAliquot into small amber bottles (~5 ml) and then freeze at -20 °C.  Bottles should be discarded after 3 freeze/thaw cycles.  Prior to use thaw agents and reheat to appropriate temperature if they have fallen out of solution.  Allow to cool to <37 °C prior to injection.\nInject the mice intraperitoneally (I.P.) with a dose of 80 mg/kg, for example a 25 g mouse receives 0.2 ml of the appropriate induction agent. For Ah-cre deliver three injections in 24 hr period, for vil-Cre-ERT2 give one injection per day for 4 days.\n2. Dissection of Intestine for Reporter Visualization and Immunohistochemistry (IHC)",
    "Euthanize the mouse using cervical dislocation without prior anesthesia in accordance with ethical approval. Place mouse in a supine position and wet the fur using 70% EtOH, open the intra-peritoneal cavity longitudinally along the midline using a scissors.\nSecure the stomach with a forceps and sever the connection to the esophagus. Remove the small intestine up to the appendix by gently pulling on the stomach. Remove the large intestine up to the anus by gently pulling on the appendix.\nOnce the intestines have been isolated remove the stomach and appendix. Flush intestines with 1x PBS using a syringe with a blunt ended pipette tip.  NOTE: Each intestine should be immediately processed for one of the downstream applications described below.\n3. Formalin Fixation of Intestine\nCut the flushed intestine into 3 equal sized sections and label proximal, middle and distal. Cut each section into 1 cm pieces. Take a small strip of surgical tape 2 cm x 2 cm. Place three to five 1 cm pieces on to the middle of the surgical tape in a pyramid formation.\nClose and seal the tape around the pieces longitudinally, to give a “log pile” effect. Place tissue in a flat bottomed container containing a large excess of neutral buffered formalin fixative, at least 10x the volume of fixative to the volume of tissue.  NOTE: Avoid placing excess amounts of tissue within a tube for fixation, divide it into multiple containers.\nPlace samples at 4 °C for at least 18 - 24 hr prior to embedding and sectioning.  To prevent loss of nuclear β-catenin, do not fix beyond 24 hr. After fixation transfer tissue to a flat bottomed container containing a large excess of 70% EtOH, at least 10x the volume of tissue.\n4. Methacarn Fixation of Intestine",
    "Prior to dissection prepare methacarn fixative by combining 300 ml MeOH, 150 ml chloroform and 75 ml glacial acetic acid (4:2:1). Cut the flushed intestine into 3 equal sized sections proximal, middle and distal.\nPlace each piece of intestine side by side on a piece of filter paper (15 cm x15 cm) and using a springbow scissors open it up ‘en face’. Place the intestine and filter paper into a glass dish containing methacarn for 3 - 24 hr at RT. After fixation pick up the end of an intestine section using a forceps.\nWind the intestine around the forceps to form a “swiss roll” and secure the roll by slightly opening the forceps and putting a 25 G needle through it.   Place tissue in a flat bottomed container containing a large excess of neutral buffered formalin fixative, at least 10x the volume of fixative to the volume of tissue and store for at least 1 hr before proceeding to processing.\n5. Whole Mount LacZ Visualization (Modified from El Marjou et al.18)\nPrepare wax plates by combining molten ralwax with mineral oil at 10:1. Pour into 15 cm petri dishes and leave to cool. Prepare X-gal fixative as per Table 1 and store on ice.\nRemove whole intestine and flush through with ice-cold 1x PBS, as per section 2. Fix intestine by flushing with 25 ml ice-cold X-gal fixative.\nUsing a scissor cut the intestine into 3 - 5 equal sections (maximum 5 per plate).  Place each section onto wax plate and pin down each end so the section is slightly stretched with the mesenteric line uppermost; trim any excess mesentery. Using a springbow scissors cut the gut longitudinally and pin out along the way.",
    "Flood the plate with X-gal fixative to cover the sections and leave for at least 1 hr at 4 °C. Remove X-gal fixative using a 25 ml pipette and wash once with 30 ml of 1x PBS. Cover sections with 30 ml of DTT demucifying solution for 30 - 60 min at RT, ideally on a rocking platform.\nRemove demucifiying solution using a 25 ml pipette and flood the plate with 30 ml of 1x PBS.  Using a pasteur pipette wash the intestine sections with the 1x PBS in the plate to remove mucus.\nRemove 1x PBS with a 25 ml pipette and flood with 30 ml of X-gal stain. Incubate overnight at RT in the dark with gentle agitation on a rocking platform.\nFollowing the overnight incubation check that the sections have developed a blue/green stain, if the background color is still white, fresh staining solution can be added and monitored till staining develops. NOTE: Once sections have stained then no further staining can be attempted.\nRemove the X-gal stain using a 25 ml pipette and flood plate with 30 ml of 1x PBS and leave for 3 min with gentle agitation.  Remove pins and pick up, with forceps, the end of an intestine section. Wind the intestine around the forceps to form a “Swiss roll”, secure the roll by slightly opening the forceps and putting a 25 G needle through it.\nPlace tissue in a wide mouthed flat bottomed container containing a large excess of neutral buffered formalin fixative, at least 10x the volume of fixative to the volume of tissue.   Place samples at 4 °C for at least 24 hr prior to embedding and sectioning. \n6. Extraction of Crypts from Intestine",
    "Isolate the first 20 cm of the small intestine, as per section 2. Place the intestine on a clean dissecting surface and using a forceps and scissors remove any attached fat/mesentery. Using a springbow scissors open the gut longitudinally.\nUsing a microscope cover slide, firmly scrape the gut lumen to remove villi and mucus. Using a scissors cut the intestine into ~5 mm pieces and transfer into a 50 ml tube with 25 ml 1x HBSS supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 U/ml). \nIncubate for 10 min at RT. Remove the antibiotic containing media by passing the samples through a 70 µm cell strainer.\nPlace intestinal sections into a fresh 50 ml tube containing 10 ml 1x HBSS and replace the cap.\nGently invert twice and remove the 1x HBSS by passing through a 70 µm cell strainer. Further wash the intestinal pieces by repeating 6.4 & 6.5  three times and ensure that the final fraction is relatively clear.\nTransfer tissue to a fresh 50 ml tube containing 10 ml of EDTA (8 mM)/1x HBSS and leave at RT for 5 min. Shake vigorously (20 - 30x) or vortex, pass through a 70 µm cell strainer and transfer tissue pieces to a fresh 50 ml tube containing EDTA (8 mM)/1x HBSS.  NOTE: The flow through can either be discarded or retained if analysis of villi epithelia is required.\n Incubate the tissue pieces on ice for 30 min, shake the sample vigorously (20 - 30x) or vortex. Pass the samples through a 70µm cell strainer and retain the flow through as this contains the crypts.",
    "Transfer the tissue pieces to a fresh 50 ml tube containing 10 ml of 1x HBSS.  Shake vigorously (20 - 30x) or vortex, pass through a 70 µm cell strainer and retain the flow through. Repeat one more time to ensure maximum recovery of crypts from intestinal pieces. Combine the flow through fractions and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Pour off the supernatant and retain the crypt pellet.  NOTE: The pellets can be used immediately for culturing (if applicable) or stored at -80 °C prior to standard DNA/ RNA/protein extraction procedures.\n7. Standard Immunohistochemical Visualization\nCut 5 µm sections of paraffin embedded tissue onto poly-L-lysine (PLL) slides. Note: A standard protocol for staining with a B-catenin antibody is given below, parameters for other antibodies are given in Table 2.\nDe-wax with 2x 3 min washes in slide baths containing fresh xylene. Rehydrate by passing slides for 3 min through slide baths containing fresh: 100% EtOH (2x), 95% EtOH and 70% EtOH and finally into 1x PBS.\nPlace slides into a slide bath containing citrate buffer (pH 6) and heat 99.9°C for 20 min to retrieve antigens. Allow slides to cool and then wash 3x 5 min in a slide bath containing 1xTBS/T for 5 min. Remove slides from last wash, immediately draw around tissue with a PAP pen, and cover section with a commercial peroxidase block or 1.5% H2O2 (in distilled H2O).\nIncubate for 20 min at room temperature (RT) then wash 3x in slide baths containing fresh 1x TBS/T for 5 min. After washing cover sections, using a pipette, in 5% Normal Rabbit Serum (NRS)/1xTBS/T for 30 min at RT to block non-specific hydrophobic binding of your primary antibody.",
    "Remove NRS block with a Pasteur pipette and cover section in B-catenin primary antibody diluted 1:200 with 5% NRS. Wash slides for 3x 5 min in slide baths containing fresh 1xTBS/T. Note - other antibodies will require optimization for dilution and specificity.  To ensure specificity of an antibody, appropriate no antibody and isotype control stains should be performed.  An isotype control is matched to the host species and isotype of your primary antibody.\nVisualize with either a commercial HRP detection kit or with an appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary antibody (Table 2).  NOTE: Length of development differs for each antibody, for β-catenin 10 - 15 sec is usually sufficient.  To optimize development for an antibody first establish the length of time required to visualize positive cells using a positive control slide and then apply this to all subsequent slides.\nWash slides for 3x 5 min in slide baths containing fresh TBS/T. Counterstain slides by immersing in a slide bath containing haematoxylin for ~45 sec (not required if using fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies).  Put slides into a clean slide bath and rinse with running tap water for ~1 min, ensuring the haematoxylin is not completely washed out.\nDehydrate slides by passing through slide baths containing increasing concentrations of alcohols; 1x 30 sec  in 70% EtOh, 1x 30 sec in 95% EtOH, 2x 30 sec washes in 100% EtOH, 2x 2 min in xylene.\nMount slides under a coverslip using a commercial mounting media.
