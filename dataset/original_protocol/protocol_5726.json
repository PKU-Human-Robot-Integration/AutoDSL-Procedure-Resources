    "Transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strainsStreak the yeast strain from a glycerol stock on a yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) agar plate. Grow cells at 30 °C for 1-2 days. Inoculate 10 ml YPD solution with a single colony with a loop. Grow culture overnight at 30 °C at 250 rpm (OD around 2).Dilute overnight culture to OD 0.2-0.3 in 50 ml YPD medium.Note: Use a 500 ml flask.Grow cells for 3-4 h at 30 °C at 250 rpm.Centrifuge cells at 3,590 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Use 50 ml disposable centrifuge tubes.Discard supernatant and add 1 ml of sterile dH2O, vortex gently, then fill up tube with sterile dH2O.Centrifuge cells at 3,590 x g for 5 min. Use 50 ml disposable centrifuge tubes.Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 ml of 100 mM lithium acetate.Transfer cells into an Eppendorf tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 3,590 x g. Discard supernatant and dissolve the cell pellet in 0.4 ml of 100 mM lithium acetate. Incubate at room temperature for 10-15 min.Note: Use a sterile transfer pipette.Add 1-5 μl plasmid DNA (5-10 μg) to each fresh Eppendorf tube.Make up the master mix for transformation (see Recipes).Add 0.4 ml transformation mix to each Eppendorf tube containing the plasmids. Vortex gently for 2 sec to mix components. Note: Make sure that yeast cells are well resuspended.Incubate cells at 30 °C (no shaking) for 30 min.Incubate cells at 42 °C (no shaking) for 40 min.Centrifuge cells at 570 x g for 2 min. Discard supernatant and add 100 μl sterile dH2O. Disperse pellet by gently pipetting up and down, and dispense cells on agar plates with the appropriate selection medium. Incubate plates at 30 °C for 2-3 days.Note: Try to spread cells with few strokes.",
    "Cell culturePre-grow yeast in 2 ml of yeast extract peptone galactose (YPG) and incubate overnight at 30 °C and 250 rpm.Culture 50 ml of yeast cells in an Erlenmeyer for 24 h in YPG at 23 °C and 250 rpm.Note: These conditions are necessary to induce and maintain viral replication.Measure and control optical density at 600 nm (OD600) and when OD600 is around 2 harvest cells by centrifuging for 5 min, 4,000 x g, room temperature, and carefully remove supernatant. Resuspend cells at 5 to 10 OD600 units/ml in Tris-sulfate with dithiothreitol (DTT) (TSD) reduction buffer and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Notes: DTT facilitates cell wall digestion by breaking disulfide bonds and making β-glucan linkages more accessible to the β-glucanase activity present in the zymolyase. The results of the experiment will change if cells are processed at different OD.Incubate yeast cells with 0.1 mg/ml zymolyase 20T for 10 min at 30 °C to obtain spheroplastsNotes: The optimal zymolyase concentration and digestion time depend on yeast strains and growth conditions. Setting zymolyase treatment is critical for an adequate preservation of cell ultrastructure.Before zymolyase treatment, it is important to sonicate cells for 5 sec in an Ultrasonic cleaner to avoid yeast aggregation. Centrifuge spheroplasts at 280 x g for 5 min and remove supernatant.Wash 3 times with ice-cold spheroplast medium A.Gold treatment and fixationIncubate live spheroplasts with 2 mM HAuCl4 in spheroplast medium A for 75 min at room temperature in the dark.Notes: To prepare the HAuCl4 solution, dissolve in distilled and sterile water protected from light.MT binds gold atoms and builds a nanocluster visible by TEM.It is important to adjust the gold treatment conditions due to the potential toxicity of gold salts in eukaryotic cells.Wash cells with spheroplast medium A.Fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.",
    "2% glutaraldehyde in PHEM solution for 1 h at room temperature. After fixation wash spheroplasts 3 times with PHEM.EmbeddingDehydrate cells in 10 min steps, with increasing concentrations of 1 ml ethanol (30, 50, 70, 90% and twice in 100%) at 4 °C. Centrifugation between steps is not necessary.Incubate cells in mixtures of ethanol–LR-White resin (2:1, 1:1, 1:2) on a rocking shaker for 1 h each at room temperature and protected from light.Note: Do not expose LR-White resin to light and manipulate inside a well ventilated hood.Remove cells from the ethanol-resin mix and place them in 100% resin for 24 h. Polymerize samples in gelatin capsules for 48 h at 60 °C.UltramicrotomyRemove gelatin capsules and trim samples with a razor blade to make a trapeze.Collect 50-60 nm ultrathin sections on 300-mesh Quantifoil holey carbon grids. Observe sections under a transmission electron microscope at 30,000-50,000x nominal magnifications. Note: Sections are observed by TEM without staining to avoid masking the small MT-gold nanoclusters. Electron tomography and image processingObtain semi-thick sections (~300 nm) and collect them on Quantifoil grids. Acquire tilt series automatically at 1.5° increments over an angular range of -60° to +60° on FEI Tecnai G2 F20 and Tecnai Spirit Twin microscopes with an accelerating voltage of 200 and 120 kV, respectively.Use IMOD software to align tilt series and for tomographic reconstruction. For tomogram segmentation and 3D reconstruction, Amira software is used.Note: Noise reduction and automated segmentation software helps to highlight membrane visualization."
