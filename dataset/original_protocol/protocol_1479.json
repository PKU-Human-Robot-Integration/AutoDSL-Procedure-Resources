    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConstruction of monovalent FSTL3-Fc\nTiming: 2 weeks\nTo construct mono-FSTL3-Fc, the coding region of the human FSTL3 gene (GenBank accession NM_005860.3) and the Fc constant region (Asp 6-Lys 232) of human IgG1 (GenBank: AEV43323.1) are used. The signal peptide of FSTL3 is used in the Fc construct. For introducing the knobs-into-holes mutation T366W or T366S/L368A/Y407V (Atwell et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Ridgway et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), site-directed mutagenesis is performed using PCR with specific primers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Complete amino acid sequences of the mono-FSTL3-Fc heterodimer are available in Ozawa et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1022-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic presentation of monovalent FSTL3-Fc protein\nThe mono-FSTL3-Fc heterodimer is generated through co-expression of FSTL3-Fc(T366W, knob) and Fc(T366S/L368A/Y407V, hole) constructs which harbor the knobs-into-holes mutations.\nGeneration of cells stably expressing mono-FSTL3-Fc with lentivirus\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nAlthough its biological significance is not well characterized, FSTL3 was reported to be N-glycosylated (Saito et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Therefore, mammalian cells should be used for protein expression, since glycosylation of mono-FSTL3-Fc may affect its function or pharmacokinetics profile. Here, we describe the protocol for establishing a stably expressing HEK293T cells, as these cells have high protein expression capacity. Adherent HEK293T cells can be grown in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium without serum, enabling large-scale culture suitable for protein purification. Other cell types can also be used but will require additional optimization. HEK293T cells and Lenti-X 293T cells are grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nNote: We used the CSII-CAG-MCS-IRES-Puro and CSII-CAG-MCS-IRES-Hyg lentiviral vectors (Harada et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) derived from the CSII-EF-RfA lentiviral vector to generate stably expressing cells. Any other methods to establish stably expressing cells or cell lines can be used for this step.\nProduction and concentration of lentivirus (reverse transfection)",
    "For one transfection, seed 6 × 106 cells in a collagen I-coated T-75 flask. We normally use Lenti-X 293T cells, as this cell line is optimized for lentivirus production. In order to generate FSTL3-Fc(T366W) and Fc(T366S/L368A/Y407V) lentivirus separately, 2 flasks are required.\nPrepare the transient transfection mixture. solution A: Transfer plasmid (CSII-CAG-FSTL3-Fc(T366W)-IRES-Puro, or CSII-CAG-Fc(T366S/L368A/Y407V)-IRES-Hyg), and envelope/packaging vectors, and solution B: Lipofectamine 2000. Incubate for 5 min at 25°C–28°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1022_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1022_2.csv\nNote: The original protocol from Dr. Miyoshi/RIKEN recommends a 17:10:10 ratio of transfer plasmid:pCMV-VSVG-RSV-Rev:pCAG-HIVgp.\nMix solution A and solution B, and incubate for 15 min at 25°C–28°C.\nDetach and resuspend the cells in total 10 mL Opti-MEM I supplemented with 10% FBS without antibiotics, and plate the cells in the collagen I-coated T-75 flask.\nAdd the DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex to the cells.\nReplace the culture medium with 9 mL of DMEM (10% FBS, P/S) on day 2 (after 12–16 h of transfection, or overnight).\nHarvest the supernatant with the lentivirus on day 4.\nPass the supernatant through a 0.22 μm filter.\nTransfer the filtered supernatant to a 50-mL tube and add 3 mL of cold Lenti-X Concentrator.\nIncubate the supernatant with Lenti-X mixture for 1 h at 4°C.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 1500 × g for 45 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the lentiviral particles appear as a white pellet.\nAspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the lentiviral pellet with 1 mL of DMEM (10% FBS, P/S).\nAliquot 200 μL from the viral solution into a 2-mL cryotube.\nPause point: The viral solution can be aliquoted, snap frozen, and stored at –80°C as soon as possible to avoid loss of titer.\nAlternatives: HEK293T cells are highly susceptible to lentiviral gene delivery. The filtered supernatant without concentration can be used, although the efficiency might be low.\nLentivirus infection in HEK293T cells",
    "For one infection, seed 2 × 105 cells in a 100-mm dish.\nAdd the virus stock (200 μL) onto the cells. To generate mono-FSTL3-Fc expressing cells, infect FSTL3-Fc(T366W) and Fc(T366S/L368A/Y407V) lentiviruses together.\nReplace the culture medium with 10 mL of DMEM (10% FBS, P/S) on day 2 (after 12–16 h of infection, or overnight).\nRefresh the culture medium and supplement with a selection antibiotic (1 μg/mL puromycin and/or 100 μg/mL hygromycin B) after day 4.\nAllow the resistant cells to grow as polyclonal populations (∼1 week).\nOnce the polyclonal populations are growing well and have been sufficiently expanded, prepare cell stocks and/or harvest to test for protein expression by SDS-PAGE.\nThe polyclonal populations of resistant cells can be used in the next step, which are referred to as HEK293T-mono-FSTL3-Fc cells.\nThe cells are maintained in DMEM (10% FBS, P/S) and passaged every 2–3 days.\nNote: In general, lentivirally infected cells are safe after one or two passages after infection. However, the experiments should be conducted following national and/or institutional lentivirus safety guidelines.\nOptional: Monoclonal cell lines can be obtained by limiting dilution, and a high-expressing clone will be used in the next step.\nPreparation of the mono-FSTL3-Fc–expressing HEK293T cell supernatant\nTiming: 2 weeks\nSplit HEK293T-mono-FSTL3-Fc cells at ∼80% confluence in one 150-mm dish into 10–11 new 150-mm dishes with 25 mL of DMEM (10% FBS, P/S).\nOn day 2–3 (80% confluent after passage), change the medium, wash the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and replace with 25 mL of FreeStyle293 without antibiotics.\nThree days after the medium change, collect the supernatant of the culture medium.\nNote: If the culture medium contains few floating cells, centrifugation is not needed.\nFilter the collected supernatant using a 0.22 μm filter system.\nStore the filtered supernatant in a –20°C freezer before affinity purification.",
    "Pause point: The filtered supernatant can be stored for several months at −20°C.\nAffinity purification of mono-FSTL3-Fc from the supernatant\nTiming: 1 week\nNote: From this step forward, all work must be performed at 4°C in the cold room. However, the purification can be carried out on ice at 25°C–28°C, since recombinant mono-FSTL3-Fc protein is relatively stable.\nEquilibrate a 1-mL HiTrap column with 10 column volumes (CV) of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8).\nCombine all supernatants from step 11 that contain mono-FSTL3-Fc.\nLoad the sample into the pre-equilibrated HiTrap Protein A HP column at 1 mL/min using a peristaltic pump.\nWash with over 20 CV of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8).\nElute the mono-FSTL3-Fc protein using 5 CV of 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 3.5) and neutralize it with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) to adjust the pH to 7.0–7.4 immediately after the elution. Using 5 mL of 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 3.5), the protein is manually eluted with a syringe into a new tube containing 100–200 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) for neutralization. It is possible to collect the elute as 1mL fraction and evaluate protein existence in each fraction using the absorbance at 280 nm.\nConcentrate the pooled fractions from the elution until the volume of the solution is reduced to about 1 mL using ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-15 Ultracel-50 kDa).\nReplace the solvent with sterile PBS using ultrafiltration as follows. Dilute the recombinant protein solution (about 1 mL) to 15 mL with sterile cold PBS, and centrifuge at 5,000 rpm (4,032 × g) at 4°C for about 20 min until the volume of the solution is reduced to ∼1 mL. Repeat the process at least three times. The final concentration will be about 1–5 mg/mL.",
    "Critical: Do not over concentrate the mono-FSTL3-Fc as it will aggregate at concentration above 5 mg/mL.\nAliquot, snap freeze and store the purified recombinant mono-FSTL3-Fc protein in PBS in a –80°C freezer.\nPause point: The purified recombinant mono-FSTL3-Fc protein in PBS can be stored for several months at −80°C.\nAssess the quality of the purified proteins by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1022-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. SDS-PAGE of purified recombinant mono-FSTL3-Fc\n(A) Schematic presentation of mono-FSTL3-Fc in either non-reduced or reduced conditions. The predicted protein molecular weight (MW) was calculated by the sum of the MW of all amino acids.\n(B) Results of Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining and immunoblot analysis for human IgG Fc. It is of note that FSTL3 is a target of post-translational modification including glycosylation, which may affect the molecular weights.\nDetermine the concentration of the proteins by anti-human IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nNote: Although the expected molecular weight of the purified mono-FSTL3-Fc is ∼76 kDa, post-translational modification including glycosylation seems to affect the molecular weights (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAlternatives: Amount of the mono-FSTL3-Fc protein can be roughly estimated using SDS-PAGE or BCA assays.\nOptional: Ligand-neutralizing activities of mono-FSTL3-Fc can be assessed by reporter cell-based ligand-neutralizing assays as described elsewhere (Ozawa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nIntraperitoneal administration of mono-FSTL3-Fc\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "We here describe the protocol used in our recent study to evaluate the effects of mono-FSTL3-FC following intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg, twice weekly for 2 weeks) in mice (Ozawa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The administration regimen/dosage was based on previous reports of anti-GDF8/myostatin therapeutic agents using Fc-fused protein, including ActRIIB-Fc (Cadena et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Pistilli et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). In several 4-week protocols for mouse systemic administration, the increase of muscle mass was observed as early as 2 weeks after the initial injection, which was reproduced in our study (Ozawa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). To reduce the suffering of animals, we decided to inject the mice twice weekly for 2 weeks rather than for 4 weeks.\nWeigh the animal and calculate the volume to be administered.\nIntraperitoneally inject the mono-FSTL3-Fc protein diluted with sterile PBS (10 mg/kg, 0.1–0.5 mL).\nRepeat the process twice weekly for 2 weeks (total 4 injections).\nNote: Young male mice of C57BL/6 and CD2F1 (CDF1) strains are preferentially used for the analysis of muscle mass with anti-GDF8/myostatin therapy. One possible reason is to avoid differences in skeletal muscle physiology between the sexes. In addition, male mdx mice, a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), are preferentially analyzed as a disease model. DMD is an X-linked recessive disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene and affects mainly boys.\nAssessment of mouse muscles following treatment with mono-FSTL3-Fc\nTiming: 1 day (depending on the number of mice)\nPrepare an isopentane and acetone mixture (1:2) cooled to −100°C with a cooling apparatus, such as UT2000F.\nNote: It is preferable to use a cooling apparatus such as UT2000F, rather than liquid nitrogen or dry ice.\nMeasure mouse body weight.\nEuthanize the mouse in accordance with institutional guidelines.",
    "Spray the mouse with 70% ethanol to reduce the risk of the fur sticking to the muscles.\nMake a small incision in the lower abdomen and pull back the skin.\nCarefully separate the gastrocnemius (GC), tibialis anterior (TA), hamstrings (Ham), and quadriceps femoris (QF) muscles, starting from the tendon.\nHandle the muscle by the tendon and excise it (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1022-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Once the specimen is frozen, keep it on dry ice at all times until transferring to a −80°C freezer.\nPause point: Frozen specimen can be stored for several months at −80°C.\nCritical: When the freezing process is too slow, crystal formation within the myofibers can occur.\nMuscle sectioning and quantification of the muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA)\nTiming: 1 day\nCut sections 5 μm thick in a cryostat at −20°C.\nTransfer the tissue section to a microscope slide by touching the slide to the section at 25°C–28°C.\nAir dry the sections using a hair dryer with cool air for 5 min so that the tissue sections tightly adhere to the slides.\nPause point: Frozen tissue samples and unfixed slides can be stored for several months at −80°C.\nFix the sections in 4% PFA/PBS.\nStain the sections with anti-laminin (1:500 dilution) antibody.\nObtain images of the section using a fluorescence microscope, such as BZ-X700 microscope (Keyence).\nQuantify the muscle fiber CSA with image analysis using Hybrid Cell Count software (Keyence) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1022-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
