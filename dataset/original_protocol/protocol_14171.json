    "The LAS experimental protocol has been approved by the Jikei University School of Medicine Animal Care Committee and the University Research and Ethics Committee (protocol #2015-118).\n1. Pre-operative Preparation\nAfter arriving at the animal facility, provide 5-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats between 150 to 200 g with 1 week to acclimate to their new home prior to the operation.\nPrepare the following equipment before the surgery by autoclaving: 1) a small animal respirator, 2) an anesthetic machine, 3) an intubation kit (composed of a pair of hemostat forceps, a tongue depressor, and an 18 G angiocatheter), 4) surgical instruments (which include a pair of curved forceps, a pair of straight forceps, a needle driver, a chest retractor, a pair of scissors, a 5-0 monofilament suture, a clip applicator, medium-large clips, and a 23 G chest tube).\nHave sterile Q-tips and gauze ready to deal with bleeding.\nUse a heating pad to maintain the animal body temperature around 37 °C during the surgery.\n2. Anesthesia and Endotracheal Intubation\nAnesthetize the rat in an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane mixed with 2 L/min room air.\nPrior to intubation, shave the rat's chest hair with a hair shaver and apply hair removal cream to remove fine hair.\nCheck the pedal reflex to confirm successful anesthesia prior to intubation.\nHook the front teeth with a string and secure the string with two pins.\nOpen the rat's mouth with the hemostat forceps and insert the tongue depressor into the mouth.\nLift the tongue depressor to visualize the vocal cord.\n\tNOTE: It is helpful to shine a strong light over the head region of the rat to help visualize the vocal cord.\nInsert the 18 G angiocatheter as an endotracheal tube into the trachea, and then, quickly, connect the catheter to the respirator.",
    "Set the tidal volume to 10 µL per gram with a respiratory rate of 100 breaths/minute.\nMaintain anesthesia with 2% isoflurane mixed with 2 L/min room air.\n3. Preparation of the Surgical Site\nPrepare the surgical site with alternating scrubs of chlorhexidine and alcohol x3.\nGive buprenorphine 0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously.\nCover the rat with a sterile drape.\nCheck the pedal reflex to confirm a successful intubation and maintenance of anesthesia.\n4. Left Atrial Stenosis Surgery\nMark the incision site 2 cm below the rat's left armpit with a rule.\nMake a 2 cm left lateral chest wall incision with a pair of scissors.\nSeparate the intercostal muscles between the fourth and the fifth rib, using the straight and the curved forceps, until entering the chest cavity.\nInsert the chest retractor into the chest cavity. Continue to use the straight and curved forceps to separate the intercostal muscle to obtain a direct visualization of the thymus and the heart.\nLift the thymus with a pair of straight forceps. Remove the thymus covering the heart with a pair of scissors. Avoid cutting or poking into any major blood vessels.\nCarefully pass a 5-0 monofilament suture through the surface of the left ventricle, right below the left atrial appendage. Avoid passing the needle through the major coronary arteries.\nAfter the suture is in place and there is no significant bleeding, tie a loose knot.\nPull the suture thread up and forward to lift the heart out of the chest.\nOnce the heart is lifted out of the chest, quickly apply a medium-large clip to the left atrium, just above the mitral valve.\n\tNOTE: The clip is half-way closed, with the tip of the clip pinching the left atrium, causing left atrial stenosis.",
    "Quickly put the heart back into the chest. Ensure the heart is not outside of the chest for longer than 30 s.\nRemove the stay suture used to lift the heart.\nClose the chest with a 5-0 monofilament suture, using a simple interrupted pattern.\nInsert a 23 G chest tube attached to a 10 mL syringe into the chest, and then, proceed with closing the chest wall muscle and skin with simple interrupted sutures.\nDraw out any air, blood, and pleural effusion via the inserted chest tube, using the attached 10 cc syringe, and then, pull the tube.\nClose the skin layer with a 5-0 monofilament suture, using a simple interrupted pattern.\nGive buprenorphine 0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously.\nTurn off the isoflurane.\nDisconnect the respirator after spontaneous respiration is observed.\nKeep the rat intubated and allow it to recover on the heating pad until it wakes up.\nSafely extubate the rat after one or more of the following signs is/are observed: the rat starts moving its four limbs, it regains its righting reflex, it regains its gag reflex, or it displays spontaneous voiding.\n5. Post-operative Care\nEvery 8 - 12 h, give buprenorphine 0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously. Carprofen 5 mg/kg is given subcutaneously on a daily basis for 2 days and, then, as needed, if the rat is not moving around well and looks like it is in pain.\nGive 5 mL of normal saline subcutaneously right after the surgery, as the rat may have difficulty drinking from the water spigot, immediately postoperative.\n6. Confirmation of the Success of the Left Atrial Stenosis with Echocardiography\nPerform a transthoracic echocardiography 2 weeks after the surgery to determine the LV inflow velocity.\nAnesthetize the rat following the steps outlined in section 1.",
    "After the induction of anesthesia, maintain anesthesia using a nose cone with 2% isoflurane mixed with 2 L/min room air.\nShave the rat's chest wall with a hair shaver and use hair removal cream to remove any remaining hair.\nPlace the ultrasound probe at the apex of the heart, which is around the fifth intercostal space on the left side of the chest. Move the probe around in this region until a good four-chamber view is obtained.\nMeasure the LV inflow velocity using the pulsed-wave Doppler mode just above the mitral valve annulus.\nAn LV inflow velocity greater than 2.0 m/s is required for the development of moderate pulmonary hypertension at 8 - 10 weeks post-LAS surgery.\n7. Sham Operation\nExcept for applying the clip (step 4.9), perform all the steps above to create age-matched, sham-operated control (SOC) rats.\nSubscription Required.
