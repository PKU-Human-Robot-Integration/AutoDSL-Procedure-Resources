    "1. Isolation of Native Protein Complexes by FLAG Affinity Purification\nPreparations\n\t\nSet up a 37 °C water bath for thawing the cell pellet.\nCool down a microcentrifuge to 4 °C.\nPlace several microcentrifuge tubes of different sizes (1.5 mL, 15 mL) and a homogenizer in ice.\nPrepare 10 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA) and keep in ice. Just prior to using the buffer, add 10 μL of 1 M DTT and a crushed tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors.\nPreparation of antibody-linked beads\n\tNOTE: The antibody-coated beads can be prepared up to a week in advance and kept in the refrigerator until needed. Protein G has higher affinity than protein A for most species immunoglobulin subtypes, except for rabbit IgG, for which protein A has higher affinity.\n\t\nWash 50 μL of Protein G-coated magnetic beads: Transfer 50 μL of bead slurry to a microcentrifuge tube, place the tube in the magnet to collect the beads on the side of the tube and remove the liquid. Resuspend the beads in 0.5 mL of PBS-0.01% Tween-20.\nPlace the tube in the magnet to collect the beads on the side of the tube and remove the liquid. Resuspend the beads in 40 μL of PBS-0.01% Tween-20. Add 10 μg (10 μL of 1 mg/mL stock solution) of M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Incubate with rotation for 20 min at room temperature.\nPlace the tube in the magnet to collect the beads on the side of the tube and remove the liquid. Wash the beads with 0.5 mL of PBS-0.01% Tween-20.",
    "For cross-linking the antibody to the beads, wash the beads twice with 1 mL of 0.2 M triethanolamine pH 8.2. Then, resuspend the beads in 1 mL of 20 mM DMP (dimethyl pimelimidate) in 0.2 M triethanolamine pH 8.2 (DMP solution should be prepared fresh immediately before use). Incubate with rotation at room temperature for 30 min.\nPlace the tube in the magnet. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 0.5 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Incubate with rotation at room temperature for 15 min.\nWash the beads 3 times with 0.5 mL of PBS-0.1% Tween-20. Leave beads in the last wash until needed.\nFLAG-based affinity purification\n\tNOTE: Take care in not leaving the beads without buffer for a long period of time. All buffers and tubes should be kept in ice at all times. The following protocol is optimized for the purification of protein complexes from 2-5 x 108 cells (10-20 mg protein lysate) expressing endogenous levels of a FLAG-tagged protein 20.\n\t\nThaw the cell pellet in a water bath at 37 °C until it starts to melt. Take the tube out of the bath, swirl it gently until the pellet is completely thawed, and immediately place the tube containing the cell suspension on ice.\nAdd 5 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer (containing DTT and protease inhibitors) to the cell suspension and swirl to mix. Incubate in ice for 10 min.\nTransfer the lysate to a cold Dounce homogenizer. Lyse with 20-30 strokes using the tight pestle (until there is no noticeable viscosity). Transfer the homogenate to cold microcentrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge at 18,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.",
    "Transfer the cleared lysate to a clean cold tube. Leave 50 μL of lysate behind. Take a 35 μL aliquot of lysate to measure protein concentration and monitor the purification.\nRemove the PBS-0.1% Tween-20 from the beads. Resuspend the beads with 1 mL of the lysate and mix with the rest of the lysate. Incubate the mixture in a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 1-2 h.\nCollect the beads on the side of the tube with the magnet. Collect a 30 μL aliquot of supernatant and discard the rest of the supernatant. Resuspend the beads in 0.5 mL of IPP150 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40) by pipetting 4-6 times. Transfer to a 1.5 mL cold tube.\nRepeat the washes with 0.5 mL of IPP150 buffer two more times.\nWash beads three times with 0.5 mL of FLAG native elution buffer (20 mM Bis-Tris pH 7, 20 mM NaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM ε-aminocaproic acid). With the last wash, transfer the beads to a new cold tube. Remove buffer thoroughly.\nResuspend the beads in 100 μL of 200 μg/mL 3x FLAG peptide in native elution buffer. Incubate at 4 °C for 10 min with gentle rotation.\nCollect the beads with the magnet and transfer the supernatant to a cold new tube.\nRepeat steps 1.3.10-1.3.11 twice. Pool all the eluates.\nConcentrate the eluate down to 25 μL in a centrifugal filter unit (10 kDa nominal molecular weight limit cut-off, PES) by centrifugation at 10,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the concentrated eluate to a new cold tube and add 50% glycerol for a final concentration of 5%. The concentrated eluate can be kept at 4 °C overnight if required.\n2. Blue Native PAGE\nPreparations",
    "Prepare 1 L of 1x native PAGE Anode Buffer, 1x native PAGE Dark Blue Cathode Buffer and 1x native PAGE Light Blue Cathode Buffer.\nRemove the comb of a precast 3-12% native PAGE gel and wash the wells twice with 1x native PAGE Dark Blue Cathode Buffer. Fill the wells with 1x native PAGE Dark Blue Cathode Buffer. Set up the gel in the running tank but do not add Dark Blue Cathode Buffer to the cathode (inside) chamber.\nElectrophoretic run\n\t\nPrepare the sample: To the 25 μL concentrated eluate add appropriate volume of 4x native sample loading buffer and of 0.5% G-250 sample additive for final concentrations of 1x and 0.005% respectively.\nLoad the sample and native molecular weight markers leaving an empty well between them. Load 10-20 μL of 1x native sample loading buffer in all the empty wells.\nFill the cathode (inside) chamber with 200 mL of 1x native PAGE Dark Blue Cathode Buffer carefully so as not to disturb the samples. Fill the anode (outside) chamber with 550 mL of 1x native PAGE Anode Buffer.\nRun the gel at 150 V for 30 min. Stop the run, remove the Dark Blue Cathode Buffer with a serological pipette and replace with 1x Light Blue Cathode Buffer. Continue the run for 60 min. The gel can be run at room temperature or at 4 °C; the temperature might have an effect on protein complex structure.\nGel staining\n\t\nOpen the gel cassette and discard one of the cassette plates. The gel remains attached to the other cassette plate. Transfer the gel into a tray or receptacle containing enough fixative solution (40% methanol, 2% acetic acid) to cover the gel and incubate for 30 min with gentle shaking.",
    "Remove the fixative solution and add enough water to cover the gel. The gel can be scanned for future reference.\n3. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\nNote: All subsequent steps should be performed in a laminar flow hood if possible to ensure cleanliness of the samples. All solutions should be prepared with HPLC-grade water. Discuss this protocol with the Mass Spectrometry laboratory that will carry out the analysis.\nPreparations\n\t\nPlace a conical bottom 96-well plate on top of another 96-well plate to collect the waste. Pierce the bottom of the wells of the conical bottom 96-well plate with a 21 G needle.\nWash the wells of the pierced 96-well plate.\n\t\t\nAdd 200 μL of 50% acetonitrile-0.25% formic acid to the wells of the pierced plate. Incubate the plate stack in a shaker for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 500 x g for 1 min so that the liquid flows through the holes into the waste collection plate. Discard the waste liquid.\nRepeat steps 3.1.2.1-3.1.2.2 two more times.\nFill the wells of the pierced 96-well plate with 150 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (freshly made).\nWash the wells of a centrifugal filtration 96-well plate.\n\t\t\nPlace a normal 96-well plate under the centrifugal filtration plate to collect the waste. Add 200 μL of 50% acetonitrile-0.25% formic acid to each well of the centrifugal filtration plate.\nCentrifuge the plate stack at 200 x g for 1 min. Discard the waste.\nRepeat steps 3.1.3.1-3.1.3.2 two more times.\nGel excision and in-gel digestion\n\tNOTE: Whilst excising the gel, identify and make a note of the gel slice aligned to each of the protein standards. The protein standards can be used to estimate approximate molecular weights for all gel slices.",
    "Place the gel with the glass plate on a clean surface. Slice the lane containing the sample into 48 identical slices (1.5 mm x 5 mm). Cut each slice into 2-3 smaller pieces (except the last five slices at the top of the gel) and place each slice sequentially in one well of the pierced and washed 96-well plate.\nAdd 50 μL of acetonitrile to each well. Incubate the plate with shaking for 30-60 min. Remove the liquid by centrifugation as in step 3.1.2.2.\nAdd 200 μL of 2 mM TCEP in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to each well. Incubate the plate with shaking for 30 min at room temperature. Remove the liquid by centrifugation as in step 3.1.2.2.\nAdd 200 μL of 4 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to each well. Incubate the plate with shaking for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Remove the liquid by centrifugation as in step 3.1.2.2.\nAdd 150 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate plus 50 μL of acetonitrile and incubate the plate with shaking for 30 min at room temperature. Repeat this washing step as many times as required until all the blue color is removed from the gel pieces.\nDehydrate the gel pieces by adding 200 μL of pure acetonitrile and incubate with shaking at room temperature for 20 min until the gel pieces are white and opaque. Remove acetonitrile.",
    "Add 150 μL of 0.001 mg/mL of trypsin (sequencing grade) in cold 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to each well. Incubate the plate with shaking at 37 °C for 2 h. After 1 h, check that the gel pieces are covered with liquid; if this is not the case, add another 50-100 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After 2 h at 37 °C, continue the digestion at 25 °C overnight.\nPlace a clean conical bottom plate under the gel-containing plate, ensuring correct orientation of the plates. Collect the liquid containing the peptides by centrifugation at 200 x g for 1 min.\nPlace the peptides-containing plate in a centrifugal evaporator and evaporate the liquid whilst performing the next step.\nAdd 150 μL of 50% acetonitrile-0.25% formic acid to the gel pieces. Incubate with shaking at 37 °C for 30 min.\nCollect the liquid into the partially dried plate from step 3.2.9 by centrifugation at 200 x g for 1 min. Continue evaporating the peptides-containing plate whilst performing the next step.\nRepeat steps 3.2.10-3.2.11.\nAdd 200 μL of pure acetonitrile to each well of the plate containing the gel pieces. Incubate with shaking at room temperature for 15 min.\nCollect the liquid in the peptides-containing plate by centrifugation at 200 x g for 1 min.\nMake sure the final concentration of acetonitrile in all wells is above 55%. If required, add extra pure acetonitrile.\nTransfer the peptide solutions to the washed centrifugal filtration plate. Place a clean conical bottom plate underneath it to collect the peptides. Centrifuge the plate stack at 200 x g for 1 min.\nEvaporate the liquid in the conical bottom plate until wells are completely dry. The plate can be covered with a silicone lid and stored at -20 °C at this stage.",
    "Re-dissolve peptides in 32 μL of 0.5% formic acid with vigorous shaking for 15 min. Add 8 μL of 400 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubate with vigorous shaking for 15 min. Centrifuge the plate at 200 x g for 1 min. Cover with a silicone lid and store the plate at -20 °C until mass spectrometry analysis.\nMass spectrometry\n\tNOTE: Analyze peptides on a high resolution mass spectrometer using methods compatible with shotgun proteomics. Data dependent acquisition is the most commonly used LC-tandem MS set-up for this type of analysis and should be optimized for efficient peptide identification, minimizing redundant sequencing and candidate selection over background noise. Mass spectra in the first stage mass analysis scan (MS1) should be recorded in profile mode. It is recommended to preferentially select doubly and triply charged ions for second stage mass analysis (MS2). A mass range of m/z 400-1,600 is suitable to identify most peptides between 8-30 amino acids range. Here, a protocol for analysis using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer is provided.\n\t\nInject 20 μL of sample per analysis using the auto-sampler of a nanoLC-MS/MS system. Desalt and concentrate peptides on a reverse phase C18 column (100 μm id, 2 cm).\nSeparate peptides on an analytical C18 column (75 μm id, 15 cm) using a 30 min linear gradient of 4-28% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at 300 nL/min.\nAnalyze peptides in a mass spectrometer with a top 10 data dependent acquisition method with the following parameters: m/z range 380-1,600, resolution 30,000 at m/z 400, isolation width of 2 Th, dynamic exclusion at ± 10 ppm for 45 s, automatic gain control target at 1 x 106 for MS and 5,000 for MS/MS, maximum injection time 150 ms for MS and 100 ms for MS/MS.\n4. Data Analysis\nProtein identification and quantification using MaxQuant",
    "Use the freely available MaxQuant software to identify and quantify proteins in each gel fraction from the mass spectrometry raw data.\n\t\tNOTE: MaxQuant works on data generated by data-dependent acquisition shotgun proteomics approaches. The MS data from the blue native gel fractions should be analyzed in batch as separate experiments and not as fractions of an experiment combining all gel slices. Check the iBAQ value box to perform stoichiometry calculations. Detailed protocols for database search and protein quantification using MaxQuant are described in 21,22.\nProtein profile analysis using Perseus\n\t\nUse the freely available software Perseus to display the migration profiles of the identified proteins and compare them using statistical analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: General documentation on how to use Perseus is available at http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:user:tutorials. A sample dataset is available as supplemental data.\nUpload the proteingroups.txt file returned by the MaxQuant analysis containing the protein identifications and quantitation values for all gel fractions. Populate the Intensity values into the Main box (Figure 1). A matrix will appear containing all protein identifications in rows, with the gel fractions as columns.\nRemove entries corresponding to reverse hits, proteins only identified by site and potential contaminants by selecting Filter rows based on categorical column in the Filter rows dropdown menu (Figure 2).\nNormalize the fraction intensities of each protein across the profile against the total protein intensity by selecting Divide in the Normalize dropdown menu, then Sum (Figure 3). A new matrix appears.\nDisplay the migration profile plots of all proteins by selecting Profile Plot in the Visualization dropdown menu (Figure 4).\nSelect Filter rows based on valid values in the Filter rows dropdown menu. Enter 1 in the number of valid values required.",
    "Perform hierarchical clustering of identified proteins across all blue native gel fractions by selecting Hierarchical clustering in the Clustering/PCA dropdown menu. Uncheck the Columns tree box (Figure 5). The clusters are visualized in a heat-map in the Clustering tab next to the matrix (Figure 6).\nLocate the cluster containing the bait protein in the dendrogram. Other components of the cluster represent proteins co-migrating with the bait and are therefore potential interacting proteins/subunits of the same complex.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55498/55498fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
