Each 35 mm glass-bottom dish requires 300–500 uL of agarose.\nWeigh out the appropriate amount of agarose (0.05 g agarose/5 mL E3 with 0.0168% tricaine).\nAdd agarose to E3 with 0.0168% tricaine and stir to form a homogenous suspension.\nMicrowave suspension until completely dissolved, around 10 s at high power.\nPlace dissolved agarose solution in a pre-equilibrated water bath at 42°C to cool for about 30 min.\nNote: Perform the following steps in a dark room using >500 nm wavelength light, outside of the PA-Rac1 activation spectrum (400–500 nm) to reduce baseline PA-Rac1 activity (Wu et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nEnsure zebrafish are the appropriate age for stimulation experiments. For CaP spinal motor neurons, we aim for 23–25 h post fertilization (hpf). The heart starts beating at 24hpf and is a useful developmental milestone for staging embyros.\nDissect the chorion away from the zebrafish embryos with fine forceps.\nPinch the chorion with a set of fine forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Zebrafish mounting in agarose for imaging\n(A) Embryos are dissected using fine forceps by first pinching the chorion with forceps.\n(B) A second pair of forceps is then used to peel away the chorion.\n(C) Embryos are then anesthetized in 0.0168% tricaine in E3 and oriented with a gel-loading pipette tip in 1% agarose.\n(D) Multiple embryos can be mounted in a glass bottom dish. Orienting the fish in a column allows them to be easily located on the confocal microscope. Scale bar 1cm.\nWith a second pair of fine forceps, pinch the chorion next to the first pair of forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Separate the forceps, peeling the chorion apart, and allowing the embryo to gently fall out onto the dish.\nTransfer embryos to tricaine anesthetic solution for 5 min in a petri dish. Ensure adequate anesthesia by lightly brushing the tail with a gel loading pipette tip. Embryos should be unresponsive to light touch.\nCritical: Appropriate anesthetic titration is essential since spontaneous movement from embryos will impair the ability to correctly position embryos in agarose.\nTransfer 3-6 zebrafish embryos to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and remove anesthetic solution, taking care not to damage or remove the embryos.\nAdd agarose mounting solution pre-cooled to 42°C\nCritical: There is a short time window of ∼3 minutes in which to position the embryos correctly before agarose hardens. Work quickly, but gently while mounting.\nTransfer zebrafish to glass bottom dishes.\nNote: Add the minimum volume of agarose necessary to cover the surface of the glass. Ensure the embryo is positioned near the bottom of the dish so that it is within the working distance of the microscope objective. Avoid introducing air bubbles to the agarose, which will cause optical distortions. If bubbles occur, pop them with a pipette tip.\nUsing a gel loading pipette tip, position embryos on their side, such that the longitudinal axis is parallel to the bottom of the dish with an eye facing up. The eyes should be aligned such that the top eye is directly above the bottom eye. Monitor the embryo position continuously as the agarose solidifies, adjusting as needed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: When mounting multiple embryos, we arrange fish in a single column to make them easier to locate under the microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "After the agarose completely solidifies for 15 min, slowly add 1 mL of E3 solution with tricaine anesthetic to the glass bottom dish to keep the agarose hydrated.\nWrap the glass bottom dish with mounted zebrafish in tinfoil to avoid ambient light exposure.\nNote: Repeat steps 3-10 as needed to mount additional zebrafish. Mounting additional zebrafish is recommended, since zebrafish may be injured or misaligned in the mounting process.\nPause point: Embryos can be mounted up to 1 hour before photostimulation experiments.\nConfocal live imaging setup\nTiming: 15 min\nOptogenetic axon guidance requires focal illumination over extended periods of live imaging, which imposes several constraints on microscope selection. The microscope must be sufficiently sensitive to detect fluorophores in growing axons with low levels of laser stimulation to minimize photobleaching of the fluorophore and phototoxicity to the organism during extended imaging sessions. Additionally, microscope software must allow focal stimulation within a region of interest. Finally, laser scanning speeds must be sufficiently fast to allow alternating periods of imaging and photostimulation in accordance with the parameters described below. We use the Zeiss LSM 880 Microscope with an optional gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) or Airyscan high-sensitivity detector.\nCritical: Ambient light must be reduced as much as possible to prevent baseline activation of PA-Rac1. Turn off microscope room lights, cover the microscope with a blackout curtain, and turn computer screens away from the microscope. Microscope indicator lights beneath the blackout curtain can be covered with tape. Background illumination should be measured and minimized, as described in Step 34.\nPower on the laser, microscope, and computer. Launch the microscope control software (Zen Black). If equipped with an incubation chamber and stage incubator, preheat to 28.5°C.",
    "Move a tinfoil-wrapped glass-bottom dish under the blackout curtain. Working under the curtain with a >500nm wavelength light source, unwrap the tinfoil and position the dish on the microscope stage.\nSet up the imaging laser, light path, filters, and standard detector with Smart Setup.\nClick “Smart Setup” in the top left panel.\nSelect mCherry from the dropdown menu under “Dye” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). False color the greyscale image by selecting a color under the “Color” dropdown menu.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Smart setup of mCherry fluorescent imaging in Zeiss Zen Black software\n(A) Select mCherry as the “Dye” from a library of fluorophores.\n(B) The “Fastest” imaging strategy is chosen.\nSeveral different imaging strategies are available (“Fastest”, “Best Signal”, “Smartest”). Choose “Fastest” and click “Apply” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Doing this enables the appropriate excitation laser and emission filters to allow for optimal visualization of this fluorophore.\nClick the checkbox under “T-PMT” in the “Imaging Setup” panel to enable a brightfield channel that is obtained from the transmitted fluorescent light (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Ensure that the line with the standard “Ch1” detector is checked, the dye is “mCherry”, and the range (emission spectrum) is 578–697nm. The emission spectrum is illustrated with a histogram and the excitation wavelength (561nm) is illustrated with a vertical line.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Enable the appropriate detectors and DIC optics\n(A) Enable the T-PMT and optionally the GaAsP2 detector and ensure the appropriate filters are in place.\n(B) The Zeiss microscope control touch screen “Home” panel provides information on the appropriate DIC condenser for the current objective.\n(C) Input the parameters from B into the DIC optics under the “Locate” tab in the Zen software.\nNote: The T-PMT brightfield channel is useful for locating zebrafish and assessing gross morphology.",
    "Optional: Enable any high-sensitivity detectors such as a GaAsP or Airyscan detector for higher quality imaging. The GaAsP detector may be used for time-lapse imaging during optogenetic stimulation or high-quality Z-stacks. The Airyscan detector is too slow for time-lapse imaging during optogenetic stimulation, but provides excellent quality Z-stack images.\nIf using a GaAsP detector, click the checkbox next to “GaAsP2” in the “Imaging Setup” panel to enable. Ensure this detector is behind an appropriate bandpass filter for the mCherry emission spectrum (575–610nm) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nIf using an Airyscan detector:\nIn the “Imaging Setup” panel, click the checkbox next to the “ChA” detector. This will disable the standard “Ch1” detector.\nEnsure the appropriate filter set is upstream of the “ChA” detector. This filter must allow light from the mCherry emission spectrum (575–610nm) to pass through.\nIn the “Channels” panel, select “SR” (super resolution) as the Airyscan Mode.\nEnsure the Airyscan detector is properly aligned. Click ”Continuous” to generate a live image. Focus on a small fluorescent feature in the mCherry channel. Go to the “Maintain tab” and open the “Airyscan” panel. Adjust the X and Y positions until the central hexagons are brightest in the Airyscan window and the “Quality and Status” indicator reads “Good (Waiting)”. Click “Store Current Pos” to save this position.\nSet up differential interference contrast (DIC) optics if available. Determine the DIC condenser and numerical aperture (NA) of the objective that will be used for imaging (DICII condenser and 0.45 NA for a Plan-Apochromat 20x). This information can be found under the “Home” tab of the microscope control touchscreen (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Under the “Locate” tab in the Zen software, input these parameters such that they match those of the objective (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: Always keep laser power as low as possible (<2%) to prevent photobleaching and toxicity.",
    "Locate mounted zebrafish embryos using a low magnification objective (Plan-Apochromat 10x M27- Air). Adjust the focus, laser power, and master gain until the zebrafish and the fluorescent target neurons appear clearly. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for recommended starting parameters.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1174_7.csv\nNote: Within each somite of the embryonic zebrafish, there are three bilaterally symmetric pairs of primary spinal motor neurons that innervate the musculature. For optogenetic guidance, we target the caudal primary (CaP) spinal motor neurons, since they are easily visualized and have highly stereotyped morphology within each somite (Beattie, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). These features allow the effects of optogenetic axon guidance to be easily assessed (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nScreen mounted zebrafish for appropriately positioned healthy fish at the correct developmental timepoint (23-25hpf) with robust mCherry-PA-Rac1 expression in the CaP spinal motor neurons.\nNote: Adjusting the digital zoom can help to quickly locate and screen zebrafish.\nOnce a zebrafish is identified as an appropriate candidate for optogenetic stimulation, select a CaP spinal motor neuron to target for optogenetic axon guidance (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). We typically aim for central CaP axons above the end of the yolk sac extension (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Anatomy of zebrafish embryonic primary motor neurons\n(A) The caudal primary (CaP) spinal motor neurons extend their sole axon into the ventral myotome at this point in development.\n(B) Individual CaP neurons are targeted for optogenetic stimulation with their neighbors serving as internal controls. Somitic boundaries are shown by dashed white chevrons (scale bar, 20 μm). R, rostral; C, caudal; D, dorsal; V, ventral; DM, dorsal myotome; SC, spinal cord; VM, ventral myotome; HMS, horizontal myoseptum; VMS, vertical myoseptum; CaP, MiP, and RoP, caudal, middle, and rostral primary spinal motor neurons, respectively.\nReproduced from Harris et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nHigh-quality Z-stack image acquisition\nTiming: ∼10 min per sample",
    "During cycles of optogenetic stimulation, the time available to capture images is short, which restricts image quality and limits acquisition to a single Z-plane. Thus, it can be helpful to acquire a high-quality 3D image of the target neuron prior to initiating optogenetic axon guidance to capture its initial morphology.\nSwitch to a higher-power objective (Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27) and bring the target neuron into focus.\nClick the “Snap” button to generate a single image using the current settings.\nAdjust the frame size, scan speed, pixel averaging, digital zoom, laser power (keep <2%), and master gain of the detector until snapshots of the target neurons are of sufficient quality. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for suggested initial parameter settings and advice for adjusting each parameter. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nCritical: The laser power should be set at the lowest level possible (<2%) that still produces a clear image to prevent photobleaching. The “Range Indicator” located in the “Dimensions” panel can be helpful to optimize laser power and gain to maximize information collected without saturation.\nOptional: A high-sensitivity detector such as a GaAsP or Airyscan detector is recommended to improve the quality of Z-stack images and better capture the axonal morphology.\nNote: We typically image a (200–300 μm)2 region allowing us to capture both the target axon and CaP neurons in neighboring somites in the field of view. The neighbors function as internal controls for assessing the effects of the optogenetic stimulation on the growth trajectory of the target axon.\nNote: To enhance visualization following image capture, adjust the settings in the “Display” panel. Min and max thresholds can be adjusted to discard pixels values with no information and the gamma level can be adjusted to further separate the range of intensity values for each channel.",
    "Once the parameters for individual frames are optimized, enable Z-stack imaging by clicking the “Z-Stack” checkbox (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Microscope settings for Z-stack acquisition\nEnsure the Z-stack function is enabled and set the first and last image planes by focusing the microscope at the top and bottom of the desired Z-stack and clicking the corresponding button. Use the “Optimal” button to set the number of slices and distance between slices.\nSet the total thickness of the Z-stack by adjusting the focus to the top and bottom most Z-planes that encompass the target neuron and click the “Set First” and “Set Last” buttons at these positions respectively.\nPress the \"Optimal\" button to automatically calculate the appropriate slice number and thickness based on the current parameters.\nClick “Start Experiment” to acquire high-quality Z-stack images.\nIf using the Airyscan detector, perform post-imaging deconvolution. Go to the “Processing” tab and click “Airyscan Processing.” Select the appropriate image, ensure the 3D deconvolution is selected, and click “Apply.” The strength of the Wiener filter can be adjusted to optimize the deconvolution.\nSave the current imaging settings to a profile. These settings can be easily loaded for subsequent high-quality Z-stack imaging during or after optogenetic stimulation or for future experiments. Alternatively, a previously acquired image can be opened and the imaging settings restored by clicking the “Reuse” button in the “Dimensions” panel.\nOptogenetic stimulation and time lapse imaging\nTiming: 1–6 h",
    "Optogenetic axon guidance requires delivery of appropriate light stimulation and time-lapse imaging to monitor the growth of the target axon. A brief (roughly 2 millisecond) light stimulus is given in a focal region at the tip of the growth cone every 1–3 s (1-1/3 Hz), although we have had success up to every 7 s (1/7 Hz). In the period between optogenetic stimulations, an image is acquired to assess the growth of the axon. Image acquisition and optogenetic stimulation are alternated without any pause or delay. This stimulation-imaging cycle is repeated until the axon has grown far enough to require an update to the region of light stimulation (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Time lapse imaging and optogenetic stimulation paradigm\nTo establish the initial and final axonal morphologies, high-quality 3D Z-stack images (stacked yellow rectangles) are acquired in the mCherry channel before and after the optogenetic stimulation experiment. During the axon guidance experiment, a 2D single plane image in the mCherry channel is acquired (yellow rectangles) over a period of 1–7 s using the 561nm laser. Immediately following image acquisition, PA-Rac1 is photoactivated (blue rectangle) for a period of 2ms using the 458nm laser within a region of interest 3–30 μm. This imaging-stimulation cycle is repeated to induce axonal outgrowth into the region of interest. For both 2D imaging and optogenetic stimulation, each pixel is illuminated for 0.28μs.\nFocus on the leading edge of the growth cone of the neuron targeted for optogenetic axon guidance. Continue using a higher-power objective (Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 NA M27).\nNote: To improve image quality during time-lapse imaging, high sensitivity GaAsP detectors are recommended. Airyscan detectors, while very sensitive, are too slow for imaging during optogenetic stimulation. We have had equal success with optogenetic axon guidance using standard detectors, though time-lapse imaging quality is lower.",
    "Input the image capture parameters (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). These parameters control how each frame of the time-series is collected. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for suggested initial settings and notes for optimization.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Image capture settings for optogenetic axon guidance\nThese parameters allow axonal growth to be monitored without phototoxicity or photobleaching over extended imaging periods.\nCritical: We have found that imaging periods (during which an mCherry image of the axonal morphology is acquired using the 561nm laser between optogenetic stimulations) of 1–3 seconds result in reproducible axon guidance, though we have had success with periods of up to 7 seconds. Additionally, low imaging laser powers (<2%) are critical for preventing photobleaching and phototoxicity. Imaging scan speed, averaging, frame size, and zoom affect the duration of image capture.\nNote: Both 10x and 20x objectives have been used to optogenetically guide axons.\nAcquire a test image by clicking the “Snap” button. Adjust the parameters above until satisfactory images are acquired, ensuring that the image duration (“Scan time”) is <3 s and the laser power is <2%. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nNext, enable time-lapse imaging by checking the “Time Series” box and unchecking the “Z-Stack” box. Enter the maximal number of cycles (100,000) with an interval of 0 msec between imaging cycles (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9], Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). These settings allow stimulation and imaging to run continuously with no delays. When the axon has grown sufficiently to require an update to the region of illumination, the time series acquisition is manually stopped, and the region of illumination is redrawn.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Parameters for time-lapse imaging\nImaging is alternated with stimulation without any delay and stopped manually to update the region of stimulation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1174_8.csv",
    "Enable focal optogenetic stimulation by checking “Bleaching” and “Regions”. This allows illumination with laser light of a specific wavelength (458 nm) and power (5%) in a user-drawn region of interest (ROI) (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10], Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). These parameters can be saved to a profile for future experiments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1174-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Bleaching settings for focal illumination\n458nm light is delivered in a circular region of interest targeted at the leading edge of the growth cone to induce outgrowth via PA-Rac1 activation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1174_9.csv\nCritical: For zebrafish CaP motor neurons, a stimulation period of ∼2 milliseconds (0.28 μs per pixel) with 5% (350–600nW) 458nm laser power results in reproducible optogenetic axon guidance.\nAcquire an image by clicking the “Snap” button. On this acquired image, draw a 3-30 μm diameter circular ROI using the circle icon at the leading edge of the growth cone facing the desired direction of growth. We aim for half of the ROI to contain the growth cone and the other half to cover the space immediately adjacent to the leading edge, into which the growth cone should expand during optogenetic stimulation.\nUse an optical power meter (ThorLabs PM100D) to measure the amount of light delivered during the optogenetic stimulation.\nRemove the sample dish with the mounted zebrafish embryo from the stage. Take a baseline optical power reading while the microscope is turned on, but not active to measure background illumination.\nMinimize background illumination by turning off or blocking lights with tape or blackout curtains.\nOnce background light is minimized, increase the iterations of bleaching to the maximum value.\nClick “Start Experiment” to initiate the imaging experiment.\nMeasure the laser power during the stimulation period. Adjust laser power such that the power meter reads between 300–650 nW total power in a 3–10 um diameter circular region of interest (21–32 mW/mm2).",
    "Replace the sample dish and refocus on the growth cone of the target axon. Repeat Step 33 to ensure the ROI is drawn appropriately on the growth cone. Reduce the bleaching iterations to the specified value.\nStart time-lapse imaging and optogenetic axon guidance by clicking the “Start Experiment” button.\nNote: We typically see unambiguous axonal outgrowth into the ROI 20 minutes after initiation of optogenetic stimulation. If there is no growth in the direction of illumination, further parameter optimization may be required. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]. Movement (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]), injury troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7], or photobleaching (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]) of the zebrafish may impair the ability to optogenetically guide axons.\nMonitor axonal growth, adjusting the focus as needed, until the growth cone fully occupies the ROI. At this point, the imaging experiment must be manually terminated so the ROI can be redrawn to reflect the growth.\nTo stop the imaging experiment, click “Finish current step”.\nRefocus on the growth cone as necessary.\nDelete the previous ROI and draw an updated ROI as in Step 33.\nResume time lapse imaging and optogenetic stimulation with the new ROI by pressing the “Start Experiment” button.\nRepeat step 36 until axon grows to the desired location.\nNote: The rate of axonal growth is dependent on the surrounding environment and strength of competing axonal guidance signaling. For example, when growing CaP axons across vertical myosepta, a repulsive developmental barrier, we noticed that the rate of directed axonal guidance would often slow. In these cases, we continue using the same light stimulation and imaging settings. After roughly 40 minutes, the axon typically crossed the barrier and quickly returned to its previous growth rate.",
    "After optogenetic axon guidance is complete, acquire a high-quality Z-stack by repeating Steps 21-26 to capture detailed axonal morphology after axonal guidance. Previously saved settings can be loaded to expedite the imaging setup.\nFollowing optogenetic axon guidance, living zebrafish can be recovered from the agarose and allowed to develop further or analyzed with other methods. To remove the zebrafish from agarose, use a small scalpel to carefully dissect the embedding media away from the fish and transfer to 28.5°C E3 culture media without Tricaine anesthetic.\nImmunohistochemistry of newly formed synapses\nTiming: 3 days\nAfter stimulation, immunohistochemistry can be performed to investigate the effects of optogenetic stimulation. Here we outline a procedure to visualize pre- and postsynaptic proteins to provide evidence of novel synapse formation between the guided axon and its target.\nNote: This whole mount immunohistochemistry protocol was adapted from previous methods (Panzer et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nTo allow time for synapse formation, grow zebrafish for 1.5 h following optogenetic axon guidance in E3 culture media without tricaine anesthetic at 28.5°C.\nNote: Solutions must be changed slowly to avoid damaging fragile zebrafish tissue.\nFix embryos in fixing solution overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.\nWash embryos three times for five minutes in washing solution (PBT).\nTo increase antibody penetration, use a miniature scalpel to separate the zebrafish head from the tail.\nIncubate tails for 45 min in 1 mg/mL collagenase in PBS.\nWash three times in washing solution for five minutes, and incubate in blocking solution for several hours.\nIncubate with mouse anti-synaptic vesicle 2 (1:100) and rabbit anti-RFP (1:500) primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight (12–16hr) at 4°C.\nWash embryo tails 5X with PBT and incubate overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C with AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:750) and AlexaFluor 546 conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:750) secondary antibodies in blocking solution.",
    "In the last 45 min of secondary antibody incubation, add AlexFluor 647-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (1:500).\nWash embryo tails three times in washing solution for five minutes each.\nMount in 1% low melting point agarose in PBS for confocal imaging following as above in “Zebrafish Agarose Mounting for Imaging”.\nImage samples. We use a similar procedure for imaging processed samples as described above in “High-Quality Z-Stack Acquisition” with adjustments to account for the different fluorophores used in the immunohistochemistry."
