  "procedures": [
    "1. Suspend a fully-loaded inoculating loop of bacterial biomass in a 2.0 ml tube with 800 µl of EDTA-Saline; vortex at maximum speed to mix thoroughly.\n  2. Add 10 µl of lysozyme.\n  3. If Gram-positive bacteria, add 10 µl of mutanolysin.\n  4. Mix by vortexing for a few seconds to suspend the biomass.\n  5. Add 7 µl of RNase A.\n  6. Incubate at 37°C for at least 15 – 45 min; vortex every 15 min.\n  7. Add 80 µl of SDS.\n  8. Vortex at maximum speed for a few seconds; the viscosity is increased.\n  9. Incubate at 65°C for 10 min; vortex once during this time.\n  10. Spin down briefly and add 250 µl of sodium chloride 5 M.\n  11. Vortex at maximum speed for a few seconds and spin down briefly.\n  12. Add 400 µl of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol.\n  13. Vortex at maximum speed for a few seconds; shake for 15 min at 1,400 rpm on an orbital shaker.\n  14. Centrifuge at > 13,000 x g for 15 min.\n  15. Transfer the top-layer to a new tube \\(2 ml); avoid the protein layer.\n  16. Add 400 µl of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol again; shake vigorously by hand and centrifuge again. \n  17. Repeat step 16 until there is no protein layer.\n  18. To 1 ml of solution, add 90 µl of sodium acetate 3 M.\n  19. To 1 ml of solution, add 600 µl of cold isopropanol \\(4°C).\n  20. Precipitate the DNA by inverting the tube several times by hand, when threads of DNA are seen, shake the tube harder to clump the DNA threads.\n  21. Spool the DNA using a glass rod and leave it to dry completely, for at least 5 min at room temperature.",
    "22. Alternatively, for steps 20 – 21, if there is no formation of threads, spin down at > 13,000 x g for 10 min, carefully discard the supernatant and let the DNA pellet dry completely at room temperature.\n  23. Suspend the spooled or pelleted DNA in 100 µl of ‘low’-TE. \n  24. Incubate the resuspended DNA over-night at 4ºC for complete resuspension."
