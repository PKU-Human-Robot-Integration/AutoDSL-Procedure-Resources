    "Note: This protocol should be performed according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations, and is subject to institutional approval. Day before experimentPlace mice in a light-proof dark room and allow them to dark-adapt overnight.Check with your institution on regulations regarding overnight housing of animals.A lux meter can be used to assess if the room is light-proof.Warm the non-electric heat pad in a 37 °C bath or incubator overnight.Prepping for the experimentSet up the dark roomExisting light sources can be used if covered with red filter to make them procedure-safe.Cover the computer monitor and any miscellaneous lights with red filter or black electrical tape.Cover the 37 °C heat pad with an absorbent pad. Position the elevated platform with heat pad on top so that the mouse can be easily prepared and moved into the dome.Note: The heat pad may need to be reheated to 37 °C if multiple animals are tested.Move mice to experimental dark room if different from overnight adaption room. This can be done using either a blackout cloth or light-proof box. Mice that are not being tested should be kept in a dark environment.Set stimulus settings as described below.Preparing the miceNote: From this point on, only red-filtered light sources should be used in order to keep mice dark-adapted.Anesthetize the mouse by injection of ketamine hydrochloride/xylazine hydrochloride (80 mg/kg/13 mg/kg), and allow mice to become fully sedated (2-5 min). Check for a toe-pinch response to ensure the animal is adequately anesthetized. Treat both eyes with 1% atropine sulfate, 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride, and 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride, allowing drops to sit on the eyes for ~2 min before wicking with a cotton swab and applying the next drop.",
    "After this point the eyes should be kept hydrated with a hydrating eye ointment until the contact lens electrodes are applied (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328183640_9241.jpgFigure 1. Anesthetized mouse with atropine sulfate, phenylephrine hydrochloride, proparacaine hydrochloride, and hydrating eye dropsPosition the mouse on the heated platform. Place the ground needle electrode in the base of the tail, and reference needle electrode subdermally between the eyes (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328183722_1223.jpgFigure 2. Electrode placement on the mouseWick any excess moisture from the eyes, and add a small drop of 2.5% hypromellose to each eye.Use fingers or forceps to position the contact lens electrodes onto the corneas. The hypromellose should keep the lenses in place. It may be helpful to tape down the electrode wires to the pad using surgical tape so they do not shift during the experiment (Figure 3, Video 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328183816_7827.jpgFigure 3.

Mouse with eyes inside of the Ganzfeld ColorDomeBefore beginning and throughout the scotopic and photopic assays, periodically check that impedance levels are acceptably low (within the green range). A low impedance level indicates that the electrodes have been properly installed. Note: The impedance may be high if any of the electrodes have shifted and the circuit has been broken. The Espion visual electrophysiology system displays impedance using green, yellow and red bars to signify the level of resistance in the circuit.

Running the photopic (light-adapted) ERGLight adapt the mouse for at least 10 min at a light intensity of 20 cd sec/m2. Light adaptation saturates the rod response so that the cones, which account for only 3% of the photoreceptor population in the mouse eye, can be stimulated and recorded without rod interference (Fu, 2010). Note: It may be necessary to give the mouse a second, reduced dose of ketamine/xylazine if the animal begins to wake up.Settings to record photopic ERGstable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6\nStep,1.0,2,3.0,4,5,6\nPulse Intensity (cd sec/m2),0.78,1,2.25,5,10,20\nStart with the following settings:25 trials/stepPulse frequency: 1.0 HzSample frequency: 1,000 HzTrial pre-trigger time: 20 msecTrial post-trigger time: 250 msecRun through each step of light intensity using the Espion E2 system.Post-experimentRemove electrodes from the mouse and gently clean contact electrodes with a cotton swab and water.
