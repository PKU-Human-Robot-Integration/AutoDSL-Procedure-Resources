    "Micronucleus assayCell preparationCulture the cells according to their requirement (e.g., MRC-5, HCEC, HaCaT cell lines, etc.).Remove medium, and then twice rinse cells with 10 ml PBS, removing the PBS after each washing. The PBS should be autoclaved before use.Add 1 ml 0.25% trypsin to the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 1-5 min until the cells appear round.Add 10 ml culture medium with 10% FBS, and detach the cells by pipetting.Count the cells using a hemocytometer.Note: A relatively accurate number of cells each time is crucial. Prepare desired seeding concentration, and then seed cell into dishes or 6-well plates.Growing cells on cover glassesHarvest cells and plate an appropriate number of cells per dish or per well in a 6-well plate, at least in duplicate in a final volume of culture medium 1 ml. The number of cells for seeding should be determined by the aggressiveness of the treatment. For example, MRC-5 cells are seeded at a density of 2 x 104 cells/well and HCEC cells seeded at a density of 15 x 104 cells/well; Incubate cells for 24 h in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and allow them to attach to the plate/dish.Before the plating, place the sterile cover glasses slip flat into each well of a 6-well plate.Notes:We usually put one coverglass in one well of the 24-well plate; or no more than 2 coverglasses in one well of the 6-well plate, or no more than 5 cover glasses in a 60 mm dish.  Pipette up and down or shake the dish to make sure cells are not concentrating in the center of the dish well. Make sure there are no air bubbles between the coverglasses and the tissue culture dish.Treat the cells as necessary with the metallodrugs (at their IC50 values, against immortalized non-cancer cells).",
    "Incubate the cells in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 48 h.Fixation and stainingNote: The solutions in washing fixation or staining steps are gently handled.Remove the culture medium after 48 h, and then rinse the cells three times each with 3 ml PBS. Remove PBS and add 2-3 ml of a hypotonic solution (75 mM KCl) solution and leave the dishes/plates at room temperature (RT) for 10 min.Remove the KCl, the cells will be fixed by at least three changes of 1/3 acetic acid/methanol with fast rinse procedure. Repeat the procedure three times. Remove the solution of acetic acid/methanol and the cover slips will be also washed with cold methanol containing 1% acetic acid. Add 3 ml of acridine orange solution (5 μg ml-1) and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Remove the acridine orange, and the cover slips will be rinsed three times each with 3 ml PBS to remove any excess acridine orange stain. Get the cover slip from the well and put it face down on the drop of PBS, push it tightly and attach to the glass slide. The slide now is ready to observe under a fluorescence microscope.Allium cepa assay (Figure 1)Purchase fresh onion bulbs (Allium cepa, ~1.0-1.5 cm in diameter) from a local grocery store.Remove and discard the outermost dry, brown layers without destroying the root primordia.Place the bulbs of Allium cepa on test tubes (10 ml) containing double distilled water.Place the test tubes in an incubator at 25 °C, 50-60% humidity and 12 h day lighting/ 12 h dark for 24 h.Add aliquots from metallodrugs from stock solutions (0.01 M) in the test tubes in order to incubate the bulbs with the metallodrugs, at 3 concentrations, with a range of for example 0.05, 0.5 and 5 μΜ.",
    "The IC50 value of the metallodrugs towards the cancerous cell lines should be in this range of concentrations.Incubate the Allium cepa bulbs (two per dose) with the metallodrugs for 48 h.After 48 h, transfer the roots in tubes and add 5-10 ml 1:3 acetic acid–methanol solution, incubate for 24 h at 4 °C. If the roots are not observed, they can be stored for a few days in 70% ethanol.Transfer the roots into Eppendorf tubes with 1.0-1.5 ml 6 N HCl at 37 °C for 10 min.Remove HCl and wash the roots for 1 min in distilled water.Transfer the root tips into Eppendorf tubes and add 1.0-1.5 ml Schiff's reagent.Incubate the root tips for 40 min at 37 °C.Wash the root tips for 1 min in 45% acetic acid.Remove the root caps from the well stained root tips with a razor blade. The length of roots treated should be about 0.5-2.0 cm.Immerse 1 mm of the meristematic in a drop of 45% acetic acid on a clean microscope slide. Put a coverslip onto mounting solution with one edge contacting the solution first; allow mounting solution to cover the entire surface of the coverglass, avoiding air bubbles. Squash into single cells using the eraser end of a pencil to apply pressure.Seal the edges of the covering slip with nail polish.The slide now is ready to observe under a fluorescence microscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190714/20190714064642_1482.jpgFigure 1.
