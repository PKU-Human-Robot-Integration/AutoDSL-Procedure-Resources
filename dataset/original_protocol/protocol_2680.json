    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMacrophage infection and stimulation\nTiming: 4–24 h\nStimulation or infection of mouse macrophages is done to induce super-enhancer (SE)- mediated miRNA transcription\nPassage ∼2–3 × 106 differentiated macrophages on 6-well culture dish (30 mm diameter) in M-CSF free 2 mL DMEM per well, after 6 days of stimulation with M-CSF.\nStimulation-24 h after plating, maintain macrophages either as untreated group (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) or treat with stimulants, either 100 ng/mL LPS as positive control or 500 nM (final concentration) BET protein inhibitor JQ1 as negative control.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2334-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Differentiation and stimulation of BMDMs for X-ChIP\n(A) Mouse bone marrow derived cells BMDMs, completely differentiated on Day 6 of mM-CSF stimulation.\n(B and C) Images of BMDMs after stimulation with LPS and JQ1 for 24 h.\nIn case of positive control set, incubate macrophages in the presence of LPS containing media for 24 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nIn case of negative control set, first incubate the macrophages in serum free media for 24 h.\nTreat the macrophages with JQ1 for 2 h.\nRemove the JQ1 containing media by washing with PBS once.\nIncubate the cells for further 24 h in presence of serum supplemented DMEM (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCritical: It is critical to check that the stimulants are mixed well with media, as they are dissolved in DMSO.\nInfection- Infect the macrophages with metacyclic stage of L. donovani promastigotes (Day 7 culture) for at least 4 h, followed by washing off of the extracellular promastigotes with sterile PBS for three times. 24 h post-infection, proceed with the infected cells for cross-linking step.\nCritical: Removal of extracellular parasites should be done thoroughly as non-phagocytosed parasites can affect the total cell and chromatin content of the sample.\nCross-linking, quenching and lysis\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Cross-linking of cell chromatin is done to stabilize the miRNA SE complex followed by lysis of macrophages\nCross-linking- After completion of stimulation or infection, proceed to cross-linking of cell chromatin with sterile and freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution.\nAdd 4% paraformaldehyde slowly and drop-wise in the media in order to reach the final concentration of paraformaldehyde to 0.75% in the media and incubate for 10 min at 37°C (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nWhile cross-linking always keep the 6-well plates under mild rotating condition (1,000–1,500 × g) for ensuring proper mixing of cross-linker with media.\nCritical: It is critical to gradually add the cross-linker, as sudden introduction of cross-linker may induce local and inadequate cross-linking which can affect the outcome/result of ChIP.\nQuench the formaldehyde by adding glycine solution (final concentration of 125 mM in media) drop-wise under rotating condition and incubate the cells for 5 min at 37°C (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nAs macrophages are adherent cells, remove the solution containing media directly from plate by pipetting and wash the cells twice with chilled PBS to remove any residual formaldehyde-glycine solution. Washing should be done by keeping the plate on rocking shaker with speed of 1,000–1,500 × g.\nDuring second washing step, scrape the macrophages in presence of 1 mL 1× sterile PBS and pull together from three wells (2–3 × 106/well) in 15 mL falcon tube. Centrifuge the cells at 5,000 × g for 3 min at 4°C under fixed angle rotor.\nAfter removal of spent PBS, add around 750 μL of FA lysis buffer to ∼10 × 106 macrophages per sample and incubate for 10 min on ice, followed by sonication.",
    "Note: We have preferably used ready-made DMEM high glucose media with phenol red to track proper cross-linking. Presence of phenol-red helps in tracking cross-linking step by paraformaldehyde when it induces pH-dependent color change of media (from red to yellow). This color change takes place immediately after addition of paraformaldehyde. However, the protocol has been successfully tested upon cells cultured in the phenol red negative DMEM as well as RPMI media.\nWe have standardized and achieved controlled chromatin cross-linking for long SE element by modification of a previously published cross-linking kinetics (CLK) methodology to extract chromatin binding kinetics of protein in a time dependent manner.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] They reported that for 1% formaldehyde quenching 250 mM glycine was optimum.\nInstead of time-kinetics, we performed paraformaldehyde-glycine concentration dependent kinetics. Here we used 0.5,0.75,1,1.5% of paraformaldehyde subsequently to cross-link the cell chromatin for 10 min at RT. Then quenched them with 125 mM glycine. It was found that at 1.5% paraformaldehyde concentration, macrophages got completely damaged and no pellet was rescued after PBS washing. Therefore, we used concentration below 1%, that is 0.75% paraformaldehyde-125 mM glycine for controlled cross-linking.\nSonication and protein estimation\nTiming: 20–45 min\nSonication and protein estimation of lysate isolated from cross-linked macrophages\n∗Sonication.\nSonicate the cell lysates using 10 cycles of 50% amplitude 350 Hz) pulse for 15 s and 45 s intervals in ultrasound sonication instrument (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nDuring sonication keep the samples constantly on ice (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nBesides samples, sonicate around 1,500 μg/μL Salmon Sperm DNA (stock-10 mg/mL) in presence of 200 μL RIPA buffer which will be further used for coating beads. Sonicated salmon sperm DNA can be stored at −20°C for 2–4 months.",
    "After sonication, centrifuge the lysate at 8,000 × g for 30 s at 4°C fixed angle rotor to remove residual cell debris. Transfer the clear supernatant in fresh sterile eppendorfs.\n∼100 μL input solution was kept separated as INPUT for DNA purification using Qiagen PCR purification kit. DNA purification should be carried out following the standard manufacturer’s protocol provided along with the kit.\nElute the purified DNA using 40 μL of nuclease free water. The isolated DNA can be kept at −20°C for nearly 2–4 weeks.\nMix 5 μL purified sample with1 μL of 6× DNA gel loading dye and resolve in 1% agarose gel using electrophoresis. Run the agarose gel 60–70 V speed in 1× TAE buffer. Subsequently stain the gel in Ethidium bromide and visualize using UV-transillumination of GelDoc-XR ® system (Biorad).\nRun 1 kb DNA ladder alongside the samples in the same gel to understand the size of the fragmented chromatin DNA.\nNote: The carcinogenic effect of Ethidium bromide can be avoided by alternative DNA staining chemicals such as SYBR™ Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen) or Gel Red™ solution (Biotium).\nDue to large length of the SE elements compared to normal enhancers, standardization of the ultrasonic sound-based sonication step on cool platform is done as follows in order to achieve sheering of the chromatin into 500–1,000 kb size (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2334-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Standardization of sonication cycle and cross-linker percentage for X-ChIP\n(A) PCR purified DNA resolved in 1% agarose and visualized using EtBr staining.\n(B) Cycles of ON/OFF pulses applied to standardize the optimum sheering of genomic DNA for X-ChIP.\nAfter sheering the chromatin, isolate the DNA from supernatant by PCR purification kit as mentioned above and resolve 5 μL sample in 1% agarose gel for sizing of the DNA fragments (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "As per sonication results, 15 s ON/ 45 s OFF pulse with 50% amplitude produced best result with clear 500–1,000 bp DNA fragmentation and therefore we recommend using this optimized sonication cycle for SE element X-ChIP assay (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nBead preparation and antibody-chromatin incubation\nTiming: 45 min–24 h\nPreparation of beads for affinity purification is done followed by generation of antibody-chromatin complex\nMeasure protein content of the samples by Bradford Assay reagent.\nDuring Bradford assay, dilute the 5× Bradford reagent in sterile water to obtain 1× solution and incubate 98 μL reagent with 2 μL of blank (Water) or standards (BSA solutions 0.00, 0.25,0.5 and 1 mg/mL) or samples (untreated, LPS treated, JQ treated and infected). Record the colorimetric reading at 595 nm using the Multiskan-Ex reader. Therefore, prepare a standard curve in order to obtain the final concentration of all the samples (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2334-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. BSA standard curve obtained by Bradford assay\n(A) Optical Density values for BSA solutions (mentioned concentrations in mg/ml) obtained at 595 nm(OD595) were plotted as standard curve.\n(B) OD595 of Table represnting the concnetrations of all the samples that were calculated from the BSA standard curve.\nAfter separating INPUT, dilute the sample (from step 22) 100 times with around 500 μL RIPA buffer in order to obtain around 25 μg total protein before incubating with pre-coated beads and antibodies.\nDilute each sample to obtain 25 μg total protein for incubating with pre-coated beads and antibodies.\nBead pre-coating.\nFor each sample, take at least 20 μL Protein A agarose bead and wash three times with RIPA buffer by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C temperature (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nAfter removal of supernatant, resuspend the beads in 330 μL of RIPA.",
    "Mix ∼75 ng/μL bead volume of sonicated salmon sperm DNA with 20 μL of beads along with 0.1 μg/mL BSA (prepared in PBS). So, from 1,500 μg/μL sonicated salmon sperm DNA stock (from step 15c), add 20 μL bead along with 660 μL RIPA buffer (3× of total volume) and incubate for 30 min in orbital rotor (100–150 × g speed) at 4°C.\nAfter coating, remove the supernatant by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min followed by two times washing with 500 μL RIPA buffer at 4°C.\nKeep the ratio of bead: antibody: protein (lysate) as 20:10:25 i.e., with 20 μL pre-coated beads, mix 10 μg of antibody solution (1 mg/mL stock) and 25 μg protein lysate. Incubate the suspension for 24 h in orbital rotor (250–300 × g speed) at 4°C (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]).\nNote: Protein concentrations obtained are provided in the expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section. Estimation of protein concentration is crucial as lower amount of protein can give negative result and over concentrated antigen in the binding reaction might end up giving false positive outcome of ChIP.\nBead coating can be performed 1–2 days prior starting ChIP and kept at 4°C in RIPA buffer.\nStandardization of antigen-antibody interaction\nWe have standardized the antibody: antigen ratio in order to obtain the optimized condition to pull down the specific SE element (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). The effect of different antigen and antibody ratio upon the quality of the X-ChIP can be found in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2334_11.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2334-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analysis of BRD4 accumulation in SE element of miRNA encoding gene\n(A and B) The alteration of BRD4 accumulation according to the different antibody and antigen ratio and (B) different stimulation conditions- US-unstimulated, INF- infected, LPS- Lipopolysaccharide and JQ1 treated macrophages.",
    "(C) Semi-quantitative PCR of BRD4-pulled miR146a-5p SE DNA. Percent accumulation of BRD4 protein upon miR146a-5p SE elements on- US-unstimulated, INF- infected, LPS- Lipopolysaccharide and JQ1 treated macrophages. Each experiment has been performed in triplicates. Statistical significance (∗∗P<0.01, ∗∗∗P<0.001) was calculated using one-way ANOVA and data are represented as mean± SD (Graph pad prism 5.0).\nWashing and elution\nTiming: 1–2 h\nWashing of bead-antibody-chromatin complex and elution of bound SE DNA from complex\nNext day, centrifuge the bead and antigen-antibody containing suspensions at 2,000 g speed for 1 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads three times with wash buffer 1.\nThen wash the beads with wash buffer 2 once before proceeding to the elution step.\nFor each wash, keep the suspension on shaker for 3 min at 4°C and centrifuge at 4,000 × g speed for 1 min to remove the wash solution.\nNote: Wash by gentle vortex (for around 5–10 s). Strictly do avoid pipetting to prevent rupture and damage of the agarose beads.\nElute the DNA from the bound/pulled down chromatin from beads by adding 120 μL of elution buffer to the protein A beads and rotate the mixture for 15 min at 37°C.\nThen centrifuge the solution at 2,000 g speed for 1 min and collect the supernatant in fresh tube for DNA purification.\nNote: DNA is purified from both INPUT (mentioned in step-20) and pulled down solutions. Before DNA purification, 0.5 mg/mL RNase A is added in each suspension.\nUsing Qiagen PCR purification kit, purify DNA from each set and measure the concentration of DNA by Nanodrop (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2334_12.csv\nPCR\nTiming: 3 h\nPolymerase chain reaction-based amplification of miR146a-5p SE region\nPerform semi-quantitative PCR and quantitative RT-PCR using ∼10 ng INPUT DNA as well as pulled down DNA as templates.",

Document the gels using UV-transilluminator system of GelDoc-XR.\nCalculate the accumulation kinetics of target protein (in our model, BRD4) upon SE element from the Ct values obtained from RT-PCR and represent it as percent accumulation.
