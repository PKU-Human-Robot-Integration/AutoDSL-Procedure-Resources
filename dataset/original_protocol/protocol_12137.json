    "1. Preparation of 5 L Fly Cages (to Fit 15 cm Plates)\nObtain the materials needed: 5-quart (4.7-L) container with lid (Figure 1A), nylon mesh, and a razor blade.\nMark a 12 cm diameter circle and cut a hole in the bottom of the container using the razor blade (Figure 1B). Cut a 15 cm diameter hole in the lid (Figure 1C).\nCut nylon mesh into 25 x 25 cm squares.\nPlace the mesh over the top rim of the container and press down with the lid (Figure 1C). Make sure the mesh is tight and the lid is not tilted. The cage is ready to be populated with flies (see step 5.3).\n2. Preparation of 1 L Fly Cages (to Fit 10 cm Plates)\nObtain the materials needed: an electric drill, a 3 inch (76 mm) cutting tool (Figure 1E and Figure 1F), a straight-sided 1 L plastic jar with lid, nylon mesh, a razor blade, sandpaper, goggles, and work gloves.\nCut 3 inch (76 mm) holes in the bottom and the lid of the plastic jar (Figure 1G), with the lid tightly screwed onto the container while drilling. Position the cutting tool in the center of the circle when starting to make a hole.\n\tCaution: Wear eye protection and work gloves during this step.\nSmoothen the edges of the holes with a razor blade and sandpaper.\nCut nylon mesh into 18 x 18 cm squares.\nPlace the mesh over the top rim of the jar and tighten by screwing the lid on (Figure 1G). Make sure the mesh is tight and the lid is not tilted. The cage is ready to be populated with flies (see step 5.3).\n3. Preparation of Apple Juice (AJ) Plates",
    "Add 19 g agar and 1 L of 18.2 MΩ·cm water into a 2 L flask. Add a stir bar, and mix briefly.\nAutoclave for 30 min. Meanwhile, thaw 100% apple juice concentrate from frozen stock, and prepare 10 mL of 10% (weight/volume) methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate solution in ethanol.\nAfter autoclaving, start mixing the agar on a stir plate, and add 80 mL of 100% apple juice concentrate and 10 mL of 10% (weight/volume) methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate solution to the flask. Let cool at room temperature with constant mixing.\nPour 15 cm Petri dishes (for 5 L cages) or 10 cm Petri dishes (for 1 L cages) so that the level of agar in each dish is approximately 5 mm thick. Allow to solidify at room temperature, and wrap in plastic bags. AJ plates can be stored at 4 °C for two weeks.\n\tNote: Petri dishes can be washed and reused.\nPrepare wet yeast paste: pour some active dry yeast into a 100 mL container with a lid that would allow easy mixing, and add water in small amounts while stirring, to obtain a thick but thoroughly mixed paste. Store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\n4. Preparation of Lysis Reagents\nPrepare 5x lysis buffer: 250 mM Tris pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 1% octylphenoxy poly(ethyleneoxy)ethanol (IGEPAL CA-630), 7.5 mM MgCl2, 625 mM NaCl, 125 mM NaF, 5 mM Na3VO4.\nTo make 200 mL: completely dissolve 1 g NaF powder and 184 mg Na3VO4 powder in 71 mL water with constant stirring. Add 50 mL 1 M Tris pH 7.5, 2 mL 100% IGEPAL, 1.5 mL 1 M MgCl2, and 25 mL 5 M NaCl. Then add 50 mL glycerol (add last) and continue stirring for 1 h.",
    "Filter-sterilize using 250-mL filter units. This step can be slow, but filtering the solution is important to remove insoluble particulates. Aliquot by 10 mL in 50 mL tubes and store at -80 °C.\nPrepare 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) solution in water. Store at -20 °C in 1 mL aliquots.\nObtain protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Store at 4 °C.\nObtain 10 mL syringes and syringe filters: 26 mm diameter, surfactant-free cellulose acetate (SFCA) membrane, 0.45 µm pore size.\n5. Collection of Fly Embryos\nAmplify the transgenic fly lines carrying the tagged protein of interest in bottles (approximately 100 flies per bottle), and transfer the bottles every 2 days until 25-30 bottles are accumulated for each fly line. Amplify the control stock (e.g. the y w line) in a similar way.\nWarm AJ plates to room temperature (about 1-2 h, can be done overnight). Using a gloved finger, spread some wet yeast paste in the center of AJ plates, to make an approx. 6-cm circle for a 15 cm plate and a 4 cm circle for a 10 cm plate.\nAnesthetize the flies with a flow of carbon dioxide using a standard Drosophila stage setup, and transfer into the cages (approx. 15 well-grown bottles of flies per 5 L cage, 5 bottles per 1 L cage).\nCover the cage bottom with prepared AJ plates from step 5.2, and tape the AJ plate to the cage using two strips of tape (Figures 1D and 1H). It is useful to fold over the tips of the tape that go over the plate for easy peeling when changing plates.\nAfter the flies recover from anesthesia, keep the cages with the plates at the bottom and mesh on top.",
    "Note: It is important to wait until the flies fully recover, as they will otherwise stick to the AJ plate and yeast paste.\nAt the end of the experiment, to prepare the cage for cleaning, place the cage in the freezer for several hours. Soaking the mesh in water for a few hours will facilitate cleaning.\nIncubate the cages with flies at room temperature for 2-3 days and change AJ plates twice a day. To change the plates, turn the cage upside down, peel the tape from the plate but hold the plate to the cage, tap the whole cage gently on the bench, and quickly swap the old plate for a new one, trying not to allow flies to escape.\n\tNote: Flies need to adjust to the cage and will lay best starting on day 3. They will continue laying at peak level for about 4-5 days. Two 5 L cages at top laying capacity can produce up to 1 g of embryos in an overnight collection. Use 1 L cages for smaller-scale experiments.\nAllow flies to lay embryos on fresh AJ plates overnight (approx. 16 h), or for any other desired length of time.\nThe next morning, mark and weigh mesh containers for embryo collection, one per each fly line used.\nPrepare 1x lysis buffer, using reagents from section 4 (Note: ready-to-use 1x lysis buffer has to be prepared right before extraction): add 40 mL water to 10 mL of 5x concentrated lysis buffer (stored at -80 °C) in a 50 mL tube.",
    "Add 50 µL of 1 M DTT to a final concentration of 1 mM, mix well and separate into two 50 mL tubes, 25 mL in each. To one of the tubes, add one protease inhibitor tablet and rotate at 4 °C for 30 min. While the tablet is dissolving, collect and dechorionate embryos (steps 5.8 to 6.6). Check to make sure the tablet has fully dissolved, and keep the buffer on ice.\n\t\tNote: The second tube of 1x buffer with DTT can be stored at -80 °C and will only require addition of the tablet before the next experiment. 25 mL of lysis buffer is sufficient for up to 2 samples, taking into account subsequent washes during protein purification steps.\nMark the AJ plates on the cages with the genotypes of the fly lines used, and swap the plates for fresh ones.\n\tNote: Excess yeast paste can be scraped off the plate at this step. Embryos can be aged on the plates at 25 °C or room temperature to obtain the desired window of developmental time.\nAdd enough water to cover each AJ plate. Gently dislodge the embryos from the plate with a soft paint brush (flat head approx. 10 mm wide works well for large plates). Pour the embryos into the previously weighed and marked mesh container, and drain excess water.\nIf needed, perform a second rinsing and brushing of the plate to remove all the embryos. Combine the embryos from additional plate(s) for the same fly line into the same mesh container.\nBriefly blot the mesh on paper towels to remove excess water.\n6. Embryo Dechorionation\nHalf-fill a 6 cm Petri dish with 50% bleach (vol/vol solution in water).\n\tNote: See important comment about bleach brand in the Table of Materials and Reagents.",
    "Caution: Wear gloves and avoid getting bleach on clothes.\nPrepare 2 larger Petri dishes with water.\nImmerse the mesh container with embryos in 50% bleach for 90 s. Tap the mesh gently during incubation a couple of times to suspend the embryos in the bleach solution.\nAt the end of the 90 s incubation, wash the mesh container in each of the 2 dishes with water for about 10 s.\nRinse the mesh container thoroughly with 18.2 MΩ·cm water using the squirt bottle. Also, wash the sides and the outside of the mesh container.\n\tNote: No bleach smell should be detected after a thorough wash.\nBlot the mesh container on paper towels. Weigh the mesh container with the embryos and subtract the weight of the empty container obtained in step 5.6. Record the resulting weight of the embryos. A good amount of embryos to aim for is 0.5 - 1 g.\n7. Preparation of Embryo Extract\nAdd 1 mL of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (from step 5.7) to a dounce glass homogenizer and keep it on ice. Transfer the embryos from the mesh container into the homogenizer.\n\tNote: Embryos can be picked up with a flat end of a metal spatula or a brush and transferred directly into the buffer. Perform all steps in this section on ice.\nWash off the remaining embryos on the mesh with an additional 1 mL lysis buffer and add to the material in the homogenizer. Let the embryos settle down to the bottom of the homogenizer, and carefully aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (from step 5.7) to the homogenizer, aiming for 5-6 mL of lysis buffer per gram of embryos.\nHomogenize the embryos by 4-6 strokes with a loose fitting pestle.",
    "Note: During the first strokes, there will be more resistance. Try to move the pestle in a continuous motion to avoid splashing the solution.\nHomogenize the embryos by 8-10 strokes with a tight fitting pestle.\nIncubate the homogenate on ice for 20 min.\nTransfer the homogenate into microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min at top speed (approx. 13,000 x g).\nAvoiding the pellets and the very top lipid layer, transfer the supernatants into fresh microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min at top speed (approx. 13,000 x g).\nCarefully aspirate supernatants with 1 mL tip and load into chilled 10 mL syringes with 0.45 µm filters attached (combine aliquots of the same sample into one syringe). Push all of the solution into a labeled 15 mL tube on ice. The extract can be immediately used for subsequent protein purification experiments or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 °C for future use.\n\tNote: It is better to freeze the extracts rather than the embryos, because during subsequent thawing of embryos proteases may become activated and lead to protein degradation.\nSubscription Required.
