    "All procedures performed with mice were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Tokyo Women's Medical University.\n1.Tail Vein Injection of Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) Cells\nMaintain LLC cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells should contain a fluorescent protein expression system (e.g., GFP).\nRemove cells from culture dish by using a non-enzymatic cell dissociation reagent. Follow manufacturer's protocol.\nCollect cells in a 15 mL tube, and centrifuge at 400 x g for 3 min. Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of PBS by pipetting, and centrifuge the tube (400 x g, 3 min). Then, remove the supernatant.\n\t\nRepeat this washing step one more time.\nAfter the second wash, pass the cells through a cell strainer (40 µm pore size), and resuspend in PBS to give a final cell density of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nInject 0.1 mL of cell suspension (1 x 105 cells, 29G needle) into each C57BL/6 mouse (8 - 10 week old males) via the tail vein.\n2. Isolation of the Lungs and Counting the Cells Under a Fluorescence Stereomicroscope\nEuthanize the mice by CO2 inhalation.\nRemove the skin on the ventral surface of the chest with scissors. Then, cut the ribs and the diaphragm to expose the thoracic cavity. Flush PBS (100 cmH2O, total 15 mL) through the right ventricle with a winged infusion 25G needle and tubing.\nCut out the heart and the thymus. Grip the trachea with forceps, and pull up, dissecting the connective tissues around trachea with scissors. Dissect out the lungs and wash them in PBS.\nDetach each lobe and observe it under a fluorescence stereomicroscope.\n3. Lung Digestion",
    "Dissolve 10 mg of collagenase, 10 mg of dispase, and 10 µg of DNase in 10 mL of serum-free DMEM. Filter through a 0.22 µm syringe filter to prepare the enzymatic digestion solution.\nDice the isolated caudal lobe with scissors. Place the lung pieces in a 10 mL syringe, followed by the plunger.\nAspirate the digestion solution (5 mL) into the syringe by pulling back on the plunger. Operate the plunger up and down until the lung sinks into the solution. Then, place the lung and digestion buffer in a 50 mL tube.\nShake the tube for 15 min at 37 °C on a reciprocal shaker (150 rpm). Lungs may become tattered during this incubation.\nPipette up and down until lung cells are completely dispersed. Shake the tube for additional 30 min at 37 °C on a reciprocal shaker (150 rpm).\nPass the lung cells through a 40 µm cell strainer. Spin down the cells at 400 x g for 3 min.\n4. Flow Cytometry of Lung Cells\nDissolve 100 mg of BSA in 10 mL of PBS and filter through a 0.22 µm syringe filter to prepare PBS-1% BSA.\nRemove supernatant of the sample obtained at step 3.6 using a pipette and add 2 mL of red blood cell lysis solution. Then, spin down the cells at 400 x g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 5 mL of PBS-1% BSA by pipetting, and centrifuge the tube (400 x g, 3 min). Discard the supernatant.\n\t\nRepeat this washing step one more time.\nSuspend cells in 1 mL of PBS-1% BSA and pass through a new 40 µm cell strainer.\nAnalyze the cells with a flow cytometer to count tumor cells (using filter setup FL1 for GFP-LLC).\nSubscription Required.
