    "The following procedures were carried out under the oversight of The University of Texas at San Antonio’s Institutional Review Board.\nNOTE: The verbal behavior SCoRE procedure is appropriate for early childhood learners with language deficits who emit topography-based or selection-based verbal behavior. Individuals beyond the early childhood age range, as well as young speakers who emit non-communicative vocalizations are excluded from this analysis.\n1. Conduct a verbal operant analysis.\nArrange tact, mand, echoic, and sequelic conditions to establish functional relations between specific environmental variables and the behavior of the speaker.\nThe tact relation\nTo assess the tact relation, conduct a free-operant preference assessment in the natural environment29. Allow participants to engage with preferred items of his or her choosing. These items may be any manipulative toys that are common among young children (e.g., trains, dinosaurs, bubbles, etc.). At 30 s intervals, point to the item with which the child is currently engaged, and ask them to name the object. Tally the total number of items labeled by the participant and reinforce with generalized reinforcement.\nRemove access to that particular item and encourage the participant to engage with another stimulus. Repeat the procedures a total of 10 times to evoke up to 10 different labels from the participant.\nThe mand relation\nTo assess the mand relation, conduct a paired stimulus preference assessment in a controlled setting30. Select any two of the 10 target items identified in the tact condition and offer them to the participant, asking them to, “Pick one”. Allow the participant to play with the selected item for 30 s, then remove the item by placing it out of sight and prompt for a mand. Score whether or not the participant says the name of the stimulus and reinforce with access to the preferred item.",
    "Select two more remaining target items and ask the participant to, “Pick one”. Repeat the procedures a total of 10 times to evoke up to 10 different requests from the participant.\nThe echoic relation\nTo assess the echoic relation, engage the participant in a task unrelated to the any of the target items. At 30 s intervals, provide an echoic stimulus for one of the response targets identified in the above conditions. The echoic stimulus may be either the common name of the item, or the label provided by the child during the tact condition. Score whether or not the participant echoes the target response and reinforce with generalized reinforcement.\nRepeat the procedures a total of 10 times to evoke up to 10 different imitations from the participant.\nThe sequelic relation\nTo assess the sequelic relation, engage the participant in a task unrelated to the any of the target items. At 30 s intervals, provide a fill-in-the-blank stimulus for one of the response targets identified in the above conditions. The fill-in-the-blank frame is specific to how the child played with the item during the tact condition (e.g., You roll the …). Score whether or not the participant fills in the blank with the target response and reinforce with generalized reinforcement.\nRepeat the procedures a total of 10 times to evoke up to 10 different replies from the participant.\nRepeat all four conditions (sections 1.2−1.5) twice more, each time arranging for 10 new response targets to assess a total of 30 novel responses within each of the four conditions at the end of the verbal operant analysis (VOA). This response population provides sufficient power for further statistical analysis.",
    "NOTE: Verbal operant analyses have been shown to have moderate construct validity (r2 = 0.75), strong test-retest reliability (rs = 0.97), and high inter-rater reliability (98%)31.\n2. Calculate the verbal behavior stimulus control ratio equation (SCoRE).\nSum the frequencies obtained for each verbal operant class across all three repetitions of the VOA (Table 1).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nTrials,Tact,Mand,Echoic,Sequelic\n1 - 10,6,2,6,2\n11 - 20,4,2,10,0\n21 - 30,4,4,6,2\nTotals,14,8,22,4\nTable 1: The sum of responses across all three rounds of the assessment provide a sufficient response population for conducting further statistical analyses. Analyzing the variance across operants leads to an individualized prompt hierarchy for errorless language learning.\nDivide the total frequency for each operant by the total frequency for all operants (Table 2).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nOperation,Tact,Mand,Echoic,Sequelic\nSum,14,8,22,4\nDivide,48,48,48,48\nEquals,0.29,0.17,0.46,0.08\nTable 2: The mathematical operations used to determine the relative strength of each of the four verbal operants. The number of responses for each operant is divided by the sum of responses across all operants to yield a relative value for each operant.\nMultiply the relative strength obtained in step 2.2 by 100 to convert each decimal to a percentage (Figure 1), the sum of which constitutes the complete verbal repertoire (i.e., 100%).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58793/58793fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: A model of an autistic verbal repertoire demonstrating disproportionate levels of strength across tacts (29.2%), mands (16.7%), echoics (45.8%), and sequelics (8.3%).

Abstract stimulus control.\nCalculate the strength for all bivergent (mand + tact, mand + echoic, mand + sequelic, tact + echoic, tact + sequelic, echoic + sequelic) and trivergent (mand + tact + echoic, mand + tact + sequelic, mand + echoic + sequelic, tact + echoic + sequelic) sources of multiple control by summing the percentages for each individual operant.\nStarting with the sum of all four verbal operants, rank order the level of stimulus control from greatest to least (Table 3).\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nEnvironmental Variable(s),Environmental Control (%)\nMETS,100\nMET,91.67\nETS,83.33\nET,75\nMES,70.83\nME,62.5\nMTS,54.17\nES,54.17\nMT,45.83\nE,45.83\nTS,37.5\nT,29.17\nMS,25\nM,16.67\nS,8.33",

By converging various operants we can control a greater amount of the speaker’s environment. M = mand, E = echoic, T = tact, S = sequelic.\nOnce the operant strength has been rank ordered across singular and multiple sources of control, extract the fading steps (Table 4) that pertain to each verbal operant while preserving the response strength hierarchy.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nTact,Mand,Echoic,Sequelic\nMETS (100%),METS (100%),METS (100%),METS (100%)\nMET (91.67%),MET (91.67%),MET (91.67%),ETS (83.33%)\nETS (83.33%),MES (70.83%),ETS (83.33%),MES (70.83%)\nET (75.00%),ME (62.50%),ET (75.00%),MTS (54.17%)\nMTS (54.17%),MTS (54.17%),MES (70.83%),ES (54.17%)\nMT (45.83%),MT (45.83%),ME (62.50%),TS (37.50%)\nTS (37.50%),MS (25.00%),ES (54.17%),MS (25.00%)\nT (29.17%),M (16.67%),E (45.83%),S (8.33%)\nTable 4: To condition each individual operant, mands, echoics, tacts, and sequelics are systematically converged and diverged with one another to provide a framework for most-to-least prompting. Relational flexibility is established by varying the irrelevant variables that help support each of the individual operants. M = mand, E = echoic, T = tact, S = sequelic.\nCondition relational flexibility with referent-based instruction34, carefully ensuring not to omit any steps of prompt fading.\n\t\nConverge mand, tact, echoic, and sequelic relata (100%). For example, while engaged with a ball, restrict access to the reinforcer while showing it to the participant. Provide target response followed by intraverbal frame: “You roll the ball. You roll the ____.” Reinforce correct responding with access to the ball and verbal praise.",
