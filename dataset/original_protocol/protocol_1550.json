    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProcessing of tissue\nTiming: [<30 min]\nPrepare tissue for digestion protocol or storage.\nReceive intestinal tissue in 10 mL of transport medium on ice and proceed quickly with all dissection steps.\nNote: Transport of samples should be performed as quickly as possible but good results in viability are still seen up to 3 h after extraction of intestine from primary sample if kept on ice for the entirety of this process. Timing of dissection should aim to be completed in less than 30 min from starting to freezing or downstream processing, with all reagents pre-cooled on ice.\nPlace tissue on cutting board and examine fetal intestinal tissue under operating microscope. Identify anatomical landmarks for orientation (stomach, appendix, Meckel’s diverticulum) to inform selection of tissue for further processing.\nIsolate and separate 2 cm regions of tissue from the anatomical compartments of interest (e.g., from terminal ileum, proximal colon and distal colon), or 1 cm in low gestation tissue (e.g., <12 post conceptual weeks [pcw]).\nWash lumen with cold PBS to remove meconium. This can be achieved by flushing PBS into the lumen with the help of a blunt needle and syringe or with a pipette tip in larger samples. Wash with 500μL–1000μL depending on size of tissue for at least 3 washes. Late samples (e.g., after 15pcw) may require more to remove visible meconium. Early samples (e.g., <12pcw) may not be large enough to permit a syringe or pipette tip, in which case proceed and the lumen can be cleaned by opening of shaking of the small fragments generated in latter steps.\nDissect each sample further by opening the lumen and cutting it into small (e.g., 0.2 cm2) tissue fragments.",
    "Note: A similar process can be performed with adult endoscopic biopsies or in adult surgical tissue, with the muscularis mucosae being removed and tissue being dissected into small fragments. In both instances the small fragments will then proceed in a similar manner to that outlined below.\nMove all tissue fragments to tubes, washing each of them with 10 mL of cold transport media. Shake the tube and centrifuge.\n[Optional] Tissue can be cryopreserved. For this, fully aspirate all transport media and resuspend the tissue fragments in 500 μL of Cryostor CS10. Place the tubes in a freezing container (e.g., CoolCell® or MrFrosty®) and move it to a −80°C freezer. This will benefit batch processing and multiplexed approaches, and it has shown good recovery of epithelial and non-epithelial fractions even after 6 months.\nCritical: All dissection steps should be carried on ice using reagents pre-cooled on ice.\nIsolation of epithelial crypts\nTiming: [1 h]\nObtain supernatant enriched for epithelial crypts through EDTA chelation.\nPrepare tissue for chelation (This step is dependent on the processing method):\nIf processing fresh tissue:\nCentrifuge the tubes containing tissue fragments in transport media.\nFully aspirate transport media and add 3 mL of ACK lysing buffer. Shake the tube and incubate it at room temperature (18°C–22°C) for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL of wash media and centrifuge.\nFully aspirate wash media.\nRepeat step iii then proceed to Step 9.\nIf processing frozen tissue:\nPer sample, prepare a 50 mL tube containing 25 mL of thaw media using a serological pipette.\nObtain samples from −80°C freezer and transport them on ice to the water bath.\nThaw samples in the water bath until only small ice crystal remains (est. 2 min)",
    "Immediately add thaw media to fill cryovial, mix x3, then transfer contents to the tube containing 25 mL of thaw media.\nAgitate the tubes and centrifuge.\nAspirate thaw media and wash tissue with 10 mL of wash medium. Proceed to step 9.\nAspirate final wash media and replace with 10 mL of pre-warmed chelation media.\nShake then incubate tubes in a water bath for 15 min. There will be a total of three chelation steps of 15 min each during the epithelial isolation.\nVortex or shake tube every 5 min for 5–10 s.\nAfter the last vortex, allow tissue to settle. Remove supernatant with FBS-coated pipette and transfer it to a new 15mL tube - crypt fraction 1. Place this tube on ice.\nNote: A small amount of chelation media (est. 500 μL can be left in the two initial chelation stages, to preserve tissue remaining for subsequent repetition of chelation steps.\nAdd 5 mL of fresh chelation media to the tissue containing tube, and repeat steps 10–12. In the meantime, centrifuge the tube containing the crypt fraction 1. Resuspend small pellet in 2 mL cold transport medium in a 15 mL tube and place it on ice.\nOnce the second 15 min incubation is complete, repeat steps 12 and 13 to get crypt fraction 2. Pool with crypt fraction 1 and place the tube (now with 4mL transport media) on ice.\nRepeat the chelation step for a final time by adding 5mL chelation medium and repeating steps 10–12 for crypt fraction 3.\nIn the meantime, during breaks between the EDTA chelation steps, make up stromal digestion enzymes (see below).",
    "Repeat steps 12 and 13 (without re-adding chelation medium to the tissue) once again to obtain the third and last crypt fraction. Pool all 3 fractions (6 mL) in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge it.\nFully aspirate the all chelation media from the remaining tissue, and then transfer remaining tissue directly to stromal digestion in the incubator.\nResuspend all crypt fractions in 3 mL of warm TrypLE Express with 50 μg/mL DNAse, and move the tube into the incubator. Same volume of TrypLE is used for early and late gestation samples.\nIncubate at 37°C for 35 min using continual agitation or rotation (e.g., MACSmix(Milteyni)).\nCritical: Time crypt fraction incubation with stromal digestion: move remainder of crypt depleted tissue straight into the stromal digestion cocktail with blow out pipette (Step 18, prepared during chelation steps as detailed below).\nDigestion of crypt-depleted fraction and obtaining single epithelial cells\nDuring steps 14–17 of crypt isolate, prepare enzyme solution in the previously pre-warmed 24-well plate containing 700 μL of buffer L replacement.\nAdd the enzymes as follows: 100 μL of Enzyme D, 62.4 μL of Enzyme P, 6 μL of Enzyme B and 12 μL of Enzyme A. Small samples (e.g., <14pcw, or endoscopic biopsies) may need only half volume of each enzyme in cocktail, subjected to optimization.\nNote: Enzyme concentrations and timings in this step can be optimized to volume of tissue processed or to time with the epithelial single cell isolation step by altering enzyme of buffer volumes.\nPlace the plate, with crypt depleted fraction added, in the incubator for 45 min, bringing it out every 15 min for mechanical dissociation using a blunt needle and a 2.5 mL syringe.",
    "With the needle and syringe, pull up and flush down the sample repeatedly, washing the needle in the 2 mL buffer L replacement well in between uses. Samples may not pass through blunt needle initially.\nAfter 45 min – to time with epithelial isolation - look at the sample under a microscope and check for tissue disruption and single cell suspension (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1119-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of timing of non-epithelial fraction digestion\nDigestion of the crypt depleted fraction as seen by microscopy at 5 (left) and 40 min (right) in 24 well plate over 40 min. Right image demonstrated good dissociation of single cells at which stage digestion should be stopped (scale bar with respective measurement shown).\nCollect all stromal and epithelial suspensions. Wash each tube with thaw media and centrifuge. In the meantime, place 70 μm cell strainers on top of 50 mL Falcons – 1 per condition - and pre-wet the filter membrane using FBS.\nVigorously resuspend each pellet in 1 mL of thaw media and flush it through the filter. Add thaw media up to 10 mL and centrifuge. Repeat the washing step.\nResuspend pellet in 1 mL of thaw media and flush it through a 30 μm strainer pre-wetted with FBS. Wash through with 3 mL of thaw media if using sample for downstream culturing/FACS, or with PBS+ 0.04% BSA for scRNA-seq. Centrifuge.\nResuspend cell pellet in 250 μL media or PBS+0.04% BSA depending on downstream application and transfer exactly 250 μL to a new Eppendorf.\nTake sample for cell counting (e.g., 10 μL). Mix it with 10 μL of 0.1% Trypan Blue and add it to an Invitrogen Countess slide or view under hemocytometer for manual counting of cells and viability.",
    "Single cell suspension can then proceed to further downstream use; loading for scRNA-seq on 10× Chromium platform, antibody staining for flow cytometry or scRNA-seq multiplexing or other desired experiments.\nCritical: Step 28 is optional and can be omitted depending on downstream use of the cells (e.g., in culture or for flow cytometry) but is essential for scRNA-seq."
