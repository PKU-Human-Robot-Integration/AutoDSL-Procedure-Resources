In our hands, all crosses between wild-type moving males and Unc hermaphrodites are best performed on 60×15 mm NGM plates seeded with a large lawn of OP50 (∼3–4 drops from a 25 mL serological pipette in the center of the plate without touching the plate edges and allowed to fully dry). For additional security, the hermaphrodites may be placed equidistant around the edge of the OP50.\nFour days after setting up the cross between Strain #1 and Strain #2, pick wild-type moving (non-Unc) coelomocyte GFP positive L4 male F1 progeny from the crosses set up in step 1 to L4 hermaphrodites from Strain #3.\nSet up a total of 10–15 cross plates each with 2 males to 7–10 hermaphrodites.\nMaintain these new cross plates at 20°C and discard the cross plates from step 1.",
    "Four days after setting up the cross between F1 progeny from cross 1 and hermaphrodites from Strain #3, isolate L4 coelomocyte GFP+ Unc hermaphrodite progeny from the cross plates set up in step 2 by picking them onto NGM plates seeded with OP50. These progeny carry the correct genotype for the ICR assay (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). We recommend that 30–40 parent hermaphrodites be used in each replicate of the assay.\nPlace the ICR assay hermaphrodites at 15°C until the time of heat shock (Step 4) and discard the mating plates set up in step 2.\nCritical: The ICR assay L4 hermaphrodites in step 3 should only be picked within a two-hour window 16–18 hours before the desired heat shock time. Maintenance of the hermaphrodites to be used in the ICR assay at 15°C ensures that the hermaphrodites will just have entered reproductive adulthood at the time of heat shock. If a mutant is being used which alters the timeline of developmental progression, then adjust the window in which hermaphrodites are being picked before heat shock to stage them similarly.\nPerform the intersister/intrachromatid repair assay\nTiming: 6 days\nNote: A graphical outline of the ICR assay is depicted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/984-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Graphical timeline of the ICR assay",
    "Presented is a timeline for a hypothetical ICR assay wherein hermaphrodites are being transferred at 8am and 8pm. All times should be adjusted accordingly if a different transfer time is desired. A detailed delination of specific steps is described in ‘perform the intrachromatid/intersister repair assay’ section (steps #4–16) of this document. Horizontal colored rows indicate incubators of the designated temperature at which worms should be incubated for a given step. Vertical solid lines designate the transition between days, while vertical dashed lines indicate 6 h periods. Horizontal arrows indicate that a plate should be transferred from one temperature to another, or maintained at a specific temperature.\n16–18 h after isolating ICR assay parent hermaphrodites of the correct genotype (see step 3), place them in a pre-calibrated 34°C incubator for 1 h.\nFollowing heat shock, place the hermaphrodites in a 20°C incubator.\n10 h after heat shock was initiated, separate heat shocked parent hermaphrodites onto individual NGM plates seeded with OP50 (use the prepared 35 × 10 mm plates seeded with a single drop of OP50 from a P1000 pipette for this and all following timepoints) and maintain them in a 20°C incubator. Mark plates to indicate the timepoint post heat shock (10–22 h) and a unique ID for each parent hermaphrodite.\n22 h after heat shock was initiated, transfer parent hermaphrodites from 10–22 h plates to new NGM plates seeded with OP50 (22–34 h plates). Maintain parent hermaphrodites (22–34 h plates) at 20°C and place progeny (10–22 h plates) at 15°C.\n34 h after heat shock was initiated, transfer parent hermaphrodites from 22–34 h plates to new NGM plates seeded with OP50 (34–46 h plates). Maintain parent hermaphrodites (34–46 h plates) at 20°C and place progeny (22–34 h plates) at 15°C.",
    "46 h after heat shock was initiated, transfer parent hermaphrodites from 34–46 h plates to new NGM plates seeded with OP50 (46–58 h plates). Maintain parent hermaphrodites (46–58 h plates) at 20°C and place progeny (34–46 h plates) at 15°C.\n50–54 h after heat shock was initiated, place 10–22 h plates at 25°C.\n58 h after heat shock was initiated, remove parent hermaphrodites from 46–58 h plates and discard them. Place progeny (46–58 h plates) at 15°C.\n3 days (∼72 h) after heat shock was initiated, score 10–22 h plates for recombinant progeny (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/984-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. ICR assay germline and somatic recombinant phenotypes\nMeiotic and somatic recombinants arising from the ICR assay. All worms depicted are in late L4 or early adult stages of development. GFP fluorescence images of recombinant progeny derived from the ICR assay. Scale bars represent 200 μm. White asterisks mark the pharyngeal tip of each nematode and the shape of each worm is delineated by dashed lines. Small blue arrowheads indicate fluorescent coelomocytes, marking that the worm is carrying the Mos1 transposase transgene, and therefore do not indicate a recombinant tissue. Partial GFP fluorescence arising from somatic recombination is marked with large blue arrowheads.\nNoncrossover meiotic repair events are indicated by the presence of pharynx GFP expression that may or may not be accompanied by body wall GFP expression (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCrossover meiotic repair products are indicated by body wall GFP expression only (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nRecord the number of nonrecombinant progeny, noncrossover recombinant progeny (pharynx GFP), crossover recombinant progeny (body wall GFP only), unhatched eggs, and unfertilized oocytes laid by each parent hermaphrodite.\nIf recombinants are identified, then place them onto individual plates for future DNA extraction and sequencing of the recombination event.",
    "Note: Somatic Mos1 transposon excision and subsequent repair in the developing embryo may produce weak GFP expression in portions of the body wall or pharynx tissue (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). If a putative recombinant is ambiguous as to whether its phenotype is derived from a meiotic or somatic DSB repair event, then place that progeny individually onto an NGM plate seeded with OP50 and allow it to lay progeny. If it is a somatic recombinant, then the GFP phenotype of the parent will not be heritable.\nAfter completing scoring of the progeny laid 10–22 h after heat shock, place progeny laid 22–34 and 34–46 h after heat shock at 25°C overnight (∼14–18 h).\n4 days (∼96 h) after heat shock was initiated, score 22–34 h and 34–46 h plates for recombinant progeny, as described in step 12.\nAfter completing scoring of the progeny laid 22–34 and 34–46 h after heat shock, place progeny laid 46–58 h after heat shock at 25°C overnight (∼14–18 h).\n5 days (∼120 h) after heat shock was initiated, score 46–58 h plates for recombinant progeny, as described in step 12.\nCritical: At the time of scoring, no progeny should be reproductively mature, as it is possible that that progeny’s offspring may be included in the progeny counts. Thus, if a plate has one or more progeny older than L4 stage and there are worms on the plate that are also L1/L2 stage, then the plate should not be included in the dataset.\nAmplify and sequence ICR assay conversion tracts\nTiming: 3–5 days\nLyse individual crossover and noncrossover progeny to obtain genomic DNA. (note: the protocol below indicates the one used in Toraason et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] but this step could be achieved by other C. elegans lysis methods)\nPlace individual progeny in 10 μL of Worm Lysis Buffer.",
    "Freeze thaw 3 times by iteratively placing samples in a dry ice bath with 95% EtOH and a 65°C water bath until the samples are completely frozen or thawed, respectively (∼5–10 s).\nIncubate at 60°C for one hour and then at 95°C for 15 min.\nPause point: Samples may be held at this step at 4°C before proceeding.\nDilute each sample by adding 10 μL of deionized H2O and store at −20°C.\nCritical: Direct contact with solid CO2 can cause injury. Use caution when handling the dry ice bath.\nPCR amplify noncrossover recombinants using the primers DLO822 and DLO823 (Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, Primer set A) and crossover recombinants using primers DLO824 and DLO546 (Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, Primer set B). In our hands, 200 μL of PCR reaction using OneTaq 2xMaster Mix (NEB) and 2% DMSO generated sufficient specific product for sequencing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/984-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. PCR amplification of ICR assay recombinant loci\n(A) PCR primer design schematic for amplification specifically of ICR assay crossover and noncrossover recombinant loci. Primer set ‘a’ is composed of forward primer DLO822 and reverse primer DLO823, while Primer set ‘b’ is composed of forward primer DLO824 and reverse primer DLO546.\n(B) PCR amplification of crossover and noncrossover products produces expected products from individual ICR assay recombinants. The dark band below 250 bp in all lanes indicates primer dimers. Gel image and graphic images from this figure are repurposed from (Toraason et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: All PCR cycle conditions described in this protocol were optimized for these conditions and should be adapted if alternative polymerases are to be used.\nOptional: Due to the repetitive structure of the ICR assay locus, inclusion of DMSO in the PCR reaction may improve reaction specificity.\nPause point: PCR reactions may be stored at −20°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_984_2.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_984_3.csv",
    "Run 10 μL of the total PCR reaction volume for each lysate sample on an agarose gel using a DNA stain to determine reaction specificity. Both noncrossover and crossover reactions should yield a product of ∼950 bp (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: If significant off target bands are seen, then the PCR reaction should be further optimized. If small off target bands are observed but robust amplification of the desired target is seen, then run the remaining PCR reaction volume of that sample on a gel and excise the desired band. Purify the DNA amplicon by gel extraction and elute in 10–15 μL of ddH2O.\nNote: If no off-target products are observed in the PCR reaction, then concentrate the amplicon from the remaining reaction volume by PCR purification and elute in 10–15 μL of ddH2O.\nDetermine the sequence of the purified amplicon by Sanger sequencing. For high confidence coverage of the amplicon, we recommend using both DLO822 and DLO823 to sequence amplicons from noncrossover events and DLO824 and DLO546 to sequence amplicons from crossover events.\nCompare sequenced amplicons to the reference sequence (provided upon request by the lead contact or accessed on the our lab website: www.libudalab.org[href=http://www.libudalab.org]) and annotate converted polymorphisms. Benchling alignment software was utilized for sequence comparisons in Toraason et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6], but any sequencing alignment software will be sufficient for this purpose."
