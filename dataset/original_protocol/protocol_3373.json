    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPilot Experiment of Transposon Insertion Library: Days 1–3\nTiming: 1 h (day 1)\nInoculate a single colony of Escherichia coli EE14 into 5 mL of LB broth containing Cm and DAP and a single colony of V. cholerae EEV29 into 5 mL of LB broth containing Gm. Incubate at 37°C with shaking (180 rpm) for 16 h to make overnight culture.\nNote: It is important to start cultures from a single colony (rather than directly from a cryostock) and the colony should not be too old. We recommend isolating colonies in a plate 1 or 2 days before performing the conjugations. Furthermore, it is recommended to keep incubation time (i.e., 16 h) consistent among experiments.\nNote: For a standard protocol, cultures are grown at 37°C for 16 h, but depending on the recipient (e.g., thermosensitive mutants), growth conditions can be modified.\nAlternatives: Here we use E. coli strain β2163 as the host of SC2 reporter delivery plasmid. Any other E. coli strain that is pir+ and able to mobilize mobRP4 plasmids (e.g., SM10 λ pir) can be used. However, if E. coli is your recipient, it is essential to use MFDpir (Ferrières et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) for the donor. The use of a Mu+ donor results in disastrously biased insertion of transposon (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), which makes the Hi-SC2 analysis in vain (Problem 1).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/314-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Distribution of Transposon Insertion in E. coli\nTop: biased distribution of Mariner transposon at oriC region in E. coli using β2163 as a donor. Bottom: random distribution of Mariner transposon in E. coli using MFDpir as a donor. Chromosomal domains and genomic positions are represented below. Red and blue peaks correspond to direction of SC2 reporter insertions.\nTiming: days 2 and 3\nCarry out conjugations.",
    "Prepare 4 microcentrifuge tubes (1.5-mL), labeled A-D.\nIn the two tubes (A and B), mix 250 μL of donor and 250 μL of recipient cultures, add LB up to a final volume of 1 mL.\nIn the other two tubes (C and D), mix 500 μL of donor and 500 μL of recipient.\nCentrifuge at 6,000 × g at 21°C for 3 min then discard the supernatant with a pipette (be careful not to discard part of the pellet).\nTo wash the cells, add 1 mL of LB broth to the tube and resuspend the pellet by pipetting. Centrifuge at 6,000 × g at 21°C for 3 min.\nCarefully discard the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the pellet in the residual medium.\nFor each of 4 LB agar plate supplemented with DAP, place one filter membrane at the middle. Carefully put the whole amount of donor-recipient cell suspension (step 2d) at the middle of the membrane. Be careful not moving the plate to avoid cells dripping out the membrane. Once the drops got dry (∼10 min with lid closed), incubate conjugations at 37°C for 2 h (for A and C) and 4 h (for B and D).\nAfter incubation, by using sterile forceps, take a filter membrane and put into a tube (e.g., 14-mL round-bottom test tube, 15-mL centrifuge tube, or 50-mL centrifuge tube). Add 1 mL of LB broth and mix well by vortex to resuspend the cells.\nPrepare serial dilutions (10, 100, 1000 times) in LB and spread 100 μL of the dilutions into LB agar plates supplemented with Km. Incubate the plates for 16 h at 37°C.\nDetermine the conjugation condition and number of conjugations to carry out for the following Hi-SC2 insertion library construction.",
    "Patch 200 Km-R colonies from corresponding condition to LB plate supplemented with Cm to check Cm-sensitivity.\nNote: During the resuspension of donor-recipient mixture after washing (step 2d), it is possible to add a small amount of LB broth, but it should not exceed 50 μL.\nNote: The insertion mutants should be Km-resistant (Km-R) and Cm-sensitive (Cm-S). However, Cm-R Km-R colonies can be obtained by adverse events such as plasmid integration to the recipient genome (by homologous recombination). A good library should contain less than 1% of plasmid insertions. However, the presence of 2%–3% of Cm-R colonies can be tolerated for further application.\nNote: In case of using an alternative donor host that is dap+ (e.g., SM10 λpir), an appropriate selection pressure for the recipient strain is required in addition to Km.\nCritical: It is especially important to obtain a very good coverage of SC2 reporter insertions in the genome. In this protocol, we exploit Mariner transposon, which targets 5′-TA-3′ dinucleotides, of which ∼200,000 sites exist in the V. cholerae genome (∼4.1 Mb size in total). The aim of the pilot experiment is to determined conditions that will permit to obtain a number of clones twice the number of possible integration sites.",
    "Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] shows an example of the results from a pilot experiment. Among four different conjugation conditions, longer incubation time (B and D) would give more transposon insertions than shorter incubation. However, since cells can grow and divide during the incubation, it does not necessarily come with a higher complexity. Furthermore, doubling the volume of reaction would not result in doubling the number of colonies obtained (compare A and C for example). Therefore, it is better to choose shorter incubation time as long as it is feasible, and carry out multiple conjugation reactions (up to 30 conjugations are very much practical) instead of increasing the reaction volume. In this example, we will use condition C, which require 14 conjugation reactions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_314_7.csv\nNote: The efficiency of the SC2 reporter insertion changes not only in different species but also with different genetic background. The pilot experiment is strikingly important and must be carried out for each mutant. In some cases for certain species and/or mutants, it might be considered to expand the conjugation parameters such as the volume of donor and recipient mixture, the donor and recipient ratio, as well as the incubation time, for the best possible results (Problem 2).\nSC2 Reporter Insertion Library: Days 4–6\nTiming: 1 h (day 4)\nInoculate a single colony of E. coli EE14 donor into 5 mL of LB broth containing Cm and DAP and a V. cholerae EEV29 into 5 mL of LB broth containing Gm. Incubate at 37°C with shaking (180 rpm) for 16 h to make overnight culture.\nNote: Depending on the conjugation conditions defined by the pilot experiment, prepare multiple number of tubes for the donor and/or recipient (for this example, we prepare two tubes each).\nTiming: 6 h (day 5)\nCarry out conjugations",
    "Prepare 14 microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL). In each tube, mix 500 μL of donor and 500 μL of recipient.\nCentrifuge at 6,000 × g at 21°C for 3 min and discard the supernatant with a pipette (be careful not to discard part of the pellet).\nTo wash the cells, add 1 mL of LB broth and resuspend the pellet by pipetting. Centrifuge at 6,000 × g at 21°C for 3 min.\nCarefully discard the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the pellet in the residual medium.\nPlace filter membrane(s) to LB agar plate supplemented with DAP, and carefully put the whole amount of donor-recipient cell suspension (step 8d) on the membrane. Up to five filter membranes can be placed on one LB agar plate, and each membrane can hold maximum three conjugations (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Once drops get dry (∼10 min with lid closed), incubate the plate at 37°C for 2 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/314-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. SC2 Reporter Library Preparation\n(A) Fourteen drops of independent conjugation reactions were placed on five membrane filters without touching each other.\n(B) Example plate of almost confluent SC2 insertion library. Right: zoom of a section of the plates showing isolated colonies.\nAfter incubation, collect all the conjugation reactions into one tube.\nUsing sterile forceps, introduce two filters per tube (e.g., 14-mL round-bottom test tube, 15-mL centrifuge tube, or 50-mL centrifuge tube) and add 1 mL of LB broth. Vortex to resuspend the cells.\nMix all the conjugations in a new tube and add LB broth up to a final volume of 6 mL.\nSpread conjugation mix to LB plates supplemented with Km.\nSpread 1:1,000 of the volume (6 μL) on a Ø 85 mm plate to estimate the size of library.",
    "Spread 1.5 mL per a large plate. Let all the liquid completely absorbed (∼10 min). Repeat with each one of the four large plates.\nIncubate plates for 16 h at 30°C.\nCritical: During the preparation of the SC2 reporter insertion library, all media should be supplemented with 0.1 mM IPTG to avoid any leaky expression of the recombinase from arabinose promoter (Problem 3).\nNote: Cell pellet can be very loose after centrifugation. It is suggested to arrange the number of tubes centrifuged together so that the supernatant can be discarded immediately and without losing cells, no more than six tubes should be centrifuged at the same time.\nNote: In case the volume of conjugation mix (step 9b) exceeds 6 mL, or if using Ø 85 mm plates instead of large plates, adjust the number of plates and/or volume to spread on each plate in order to obtain isolated colonies.\nNote: We suggest to incubate at 30°C for 16 h to avoid colony-crowding in the morning of the next day (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). If the colonies are too small, plates can be incubated for a few hours at 37°C before starting the next step.\nTiming: 2 h (day 6)\nEstimate the size of SC2 reporter insertion library\nCount the number of Km-R colonies formed on the Ø 85 mm plate\nMultiply the number by 1,000, to calculate approximate number of Km-R colonies obtained in total.\nRecovery of the SC2 reporter insertion library",
    "Add 5 mL of LB broth to a large plate and scrape cells over the large plate using a cell spreader. Gather cell suspensions with the cell spreader and by tilting the plate and recover them into a 50-mL centrifuge tube by pipetting. Add another 5 mL of LB broth and repeat the procedure to collect remaining of cells. Recovered cell suspensions into the same centrifuge tube.\nRepeat the same procedure for the rest of the large plates. Recover all cells into the same 50 mL tube. Vortex very well to mix and disaggregate the colonies.\nCentrifuge at 3,200 × g at 21°C for 20 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of media.\nAdd 3.3 mL of sterile 80% glycerol (v/v, final concentration at 20%). Mix thoroughly and make aliquots of 200 μL (10–20 tubes). Store at −80°C.\nNote: If the number of colonies on the Ø 85 mm plate (11) is somewhat low, even after a few hours of incubation at 37°C, calculate the coverage of library. If it is less than one time the number of possible insertion sites, do not proceed further steps and repeat from step 7 (or step 1).\nNote: In case the SC2 reporter library was prepared in Ø 85 mm plates instead of large plates, scrape the cells twice using 1 mL of LB each time (steps 12a and 12b).\nPause Point: SC2 reporter insertion libraries can be stored for a long term at −80°C. However, freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided.\nSite-Specific Recombination of SC2 Reporters: Days 7 and 8\nTiming: 6 h (day 7)\nPrepare the cells for the recombination assay\nTake one tube of SC2 reporter insertion library from −80°C stock and completely thaw it on ice.",
    "Mix 10 μL of cells and 990 μL of minimal media (1:100 dilution). Measure the OD600 nm.\nPrepare 100 mL of minimal media supplemented with IPTG in 500-mL flask. Add cells to make a final OD600 nm of 0.05 (∼108 cells).\nIncubate the cells at 30°C with shaking (180 rpm) until they reach early exponential phase (in the case of V. cholerae, 3.5 h to OD600 nm 0.1).\nPrepare two 50-mL centrifuge tubes and pour 20-mL of cultures each. Sediment cells at 3,200 × g for 10 min at 21°C and carefully discard the supernatant. Dilute the pellets into 10 mL of minimal medium without IPTG in a 125-mL flask. (Record the OD600 nm).\nCell sampling\nRestart growing cell at 30°C with shaking (180 rpm).\nAfter 30 min (t = 0), add 10 μL of 20% L-arabinose (final 0.02% w/v) to one sample to induce expression of the recombinase. Keep the flask shaken at 30°C. For the other flask, measure the OD600 nm and transfer the culture into 15-mL centrifuge tube. Sediment the cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 3,200 × g at RT, followed by discarding the supernatant. Snap freeze the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen and keep it at −80°C until next step.\nFor the induced sample, measure OD600 nm after 90 min of induction (t = 90) and transfer the culture into 15-mL centrifuge tube. Prepare the snap-frozen cells as written above.\nNote: Using the OD600 nm you can estimate the number of generations passed during the incubation/induction. It is also possible to calculate it by determining the number of CFU at each step.\nNote: We grow cells in a minimal medium at 30°C. Other growth conditions can be applied, which can result in different overall Hi-SC2 profiles (Espinosa et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).",
    "Note: As shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], the excision frequency increases as a function of the duration of recombinase induction. Growth conditions for the recombination assay should therefore be adjusted depending on the experiment to avoid saturation in certain locus. It is suggested to carry out time course experiment for the first assay (e.g., 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 min of induction).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/314-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

A minimum of 20 ng/μL is suggested\nDigest the gDNA with MmeI.\nPrepare reaction as following.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_314_10.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 4 h.",
    "Inactivate MmeI enzyme by incubating at 65°C for 20 min.\nNote: It is important to calculate the MmeI units required for the reaction. We use 6 Units of MmeI as V. cholerae genome contains 2,983 sites. The number of units needed should be adjusted according to the number of MmeI restriction sites in the genome. To calculate the number of units needed we calculated the number of MmeI sites present in 1 μg of ɸX174 which corresponds to the number of sites digested by 1 unit of enzyme. We then calculated the number of MmeI sites in 2 μg of gDNA of V. cholerae to estimate the number of MmeI units needed for restriction digestion.\nNote: SAM (S-adenosyl methionine) is thermosensitive. It is recommended to store 1× SAM in aliquots to avoid thawing and freezing several times. 1:10 dilution has to be prepared on ice just before each experiment.\nOptional: After step 20c, run 2 μL of purified gDNA and 5 μL of MmeI-digested DNA in 0.8% agarose gel to check the digestion. MmeI digestion should give smear (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/314-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Recover the samples (∼40 μL) into 1.5 mL LoBind tubes.\nQuantify the DNA concentration using Nanodrop. A minimum of 17 ng/μL is suggested.\nLigate the double-stranded adapters to the MmeI-digested sample.\nPrepare the following reaction\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_314_11.csv\nIncubate at 16°C for 16 h.\nNote: From now on, it is recommended to use low DNA-binding microcentrifuge tubes (e.g., LoBind) when manipulating the DNA for the sequencing library.\nCritical: To increase sequence diversity and avoid low-quality data, we designed eight different couples of adapters which harbor different spacer sequence (see Before you Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], P5 NGS oligonucleotides in Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). It is essential to use different adapters for different samples. In case of a limited number of sample (e.g., 2–3), try adapters with different spacer size. On the other hand, if more than eight samples are performed at the same time (and planned to be sequenced together), the same adapter couple can be used for more than one sample, take into account that each sample will contain a different index which will Illumina will use to differentiate between them (see P7 NGS oligonucleotides from Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/314-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Fragments below 100 bp correspond to P5 and P7 primers.\nMix the three replicates of the PCR reaction and purify using MinElute PURIFICATION KIT. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions, except performing two times for the elution step with 16 μL of Buffer EB (total elution volume ∼30 μL).\nSize-select the PCR products using Pippin Prep.\nSet a 2% agarose-Dye free cassette in Pippin Prep and load the samples accordingly to the manufacturer’s instructions. Program a protocol with “Range” collection mode from (start) 160 to (end) 400 bp.\nRecover the samples (∼40 μL) into 1.5 mL LoBind tubes.\nCheck the quality of size-selected DNA by running 5 μL in a 2% Agarose gel (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nCritical: the P5 primer must correspond to the adaptor used (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). The P7 primer must have an “index” hexamer distinct to any other samples sequenced in the same Illumina run (see Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and Before you Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]).",
    "Note: It is recommended to perform a pilot PCR amplification with only one tube (instead of three). A good sample should have a single band of 207 bp for uninduced control and 153 and 207 bp amplified bands for induced samples (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). In case of a low amount of amplification, see Problem 4. In Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], we show the products obtained after 30 cycles of PCR, which permits to detect the recombined products on an agarose gel even if there are in low quantity. In Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], we show the products obtained after 17 cycles of PCR. In that case, recombined products are fainter and more difficult to distinguish in an agarose gel.\nAlternatives: A quality check of the library DNA (step 29) can be done with a BioAnalyzer (Aligent Technologies). The quality check can be performed by the next generation sequencing facility.\nIllumina Sequencing\nWe outsource Illumina sequencing to next generation sequencing facility. Typically, we use a Nextseq platform with 2 × 75 bp read length, which allows a total of 300–400 M reads per a flow cell. We aim to get ∼20 M reads for each sample. To do so, quantification of the library DNA should be done with Qubit (Thermo Scientific).\nNote: The number of reads required for the analysis varies depending on the genome size.\nCritical: Read length of Illumina sequencing must be paired-end 75 nucleotides (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and below analysis).\nCritical: In case of an Illumina sequencing flow cell is occupied only by Hi-SC2 samples, spike-in of PHiX control library (15%) is essential.\nHi-SC2 Analysis: Days 12 and 13\nThis section shows how to analyze Illumina sequencing results.",
    "Note: As all paired-end Illumina sequencing, two sequence files in .fastq format will be obtained. The file labeled with “R1” corresponds reporter position while the other file with “R2” contains the reporter status (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Since the two files are coupled, they must be treated together.\nNote: Here results files are indicated as samplename_R1.fastq and samplename_R2.fastq. In our case P5 and P7 sequences are already removed by the next generation sequencing facility.

The default is 30.\n“Drugs” refers to the additions of antibiotics or any other chemical compound supplemented during the experiment. The default is no drugs.\n“Timepoint” refers to the period of time the recombinase was induced. The default is 0.\n“Inducer” refers to concentration of L-ara used for the induction. The default is ara0.02.\nCreate a workspace “strainname.mat,” which contains the genome information as well as Hi-SC2 data mapped to the reference genome.\nCreate a GenBank file of each chromosome. Save as “strainname_chr1_cds.txt.”\nCreate a nucleotide sequencing file of each chromosome. You can use .fasta file but the header line (with “>”) must be removed. Save as “strainname_chrX_seq.txt.”\nRepeat steps a and b with all the chromosomes. No matter the replicon is chromosome or plasmid, use chr and numerical order (e.g., chr1, chr2, chr3…)\nIn the Command Window, type:\nCreateGenomeFile\nA table will appear in the Command Window. You register as follows:\n“Genome file name” corresponds to the name of strain.\n“Features” include Hi-SC2 data (shown as SC2 because MATLAB does not allow to use hyphen), CDS information and any other features/genomic region of interest (see Note). Entries should be separated by comma (,).\nSelect the file(s) “strainname_chrX_seq.txt.” Select all applicable files at the same time.\nSelect the file(s) “strainname_chrX_cds.txt.” Select all applicable files at the same time.\nSelect the combined Hi-SC2 file created above at step 34.",
    "Note: Hi-SC2 plotting function (see below) also allows highlighting certain genomic regions in the figure to facilitate your analysis and/or presentation. To do so, such region(s) of interest must be registered before the step 35d. In the CreateGenomeFile.m, there is a section called “%%Get Feature Data” (line 82–98). You can follow the instructions written in the code.\nNote: CreateGenomeFile script also allows to add new Hi-SC2 data in a genome file already generated. To do so, use “strainname.mat” instead of “strainname” at the step 35e i. and only type “SC2” in the Features box at the step 35e ii.\nAnalyze and plot Hi-SC2 data.\nIn the Command Window, type:\nPlot_HiSC2\nA box will appear in the Command Window.\n“Resolution SC2” defines the size of sliding window for the plotting. The number corresponds to the size of window (bp) from the middle point. For example, the default number 5,000 corresponds to a sliding window of 10 kb.\n“Data” refers to the Hi-SC2 result(s) to plot. Enter “strainname” followed by “samplename” separated by a comma. To plot multiple Hi-SC2 results at the same time, enter “strainname, samplename” pairs separated by a semicolon.\nA box called “Other features to display and figure properties” will appear in the Command Window. In case of adding features in X-axis, each feature must be registered in a fashion with [Feature name, marker style, marker size]. Different features must be separated by semicolon.\nTwo different figures will appear:\n“Recombination frequency” Figure shows Hi-SC2 results along the genome.\n“Comparative Tn hits” Figure shows insertion profile of Hi-SC2 reporter.\nNote: To plot several Hi-SC2 results together, all the samples must be aligned with the same reference genome."
