    "1. Experimental Setup and Sample Preparation\nFabricate microtoroids using the lithography, etching, and melting procedure as described previously6. Fabricate microtoroids on top of a silicon wafer (chip) that typically have a major diameter of 80-100 µm, and a minor diameter of 2 µm.\nUnwind roughly a meter of single-mode optical fiber (125 µm cladding, 4.3 µm mode field diameter) from its fiber spool.\nIn the middle of the unwound portion of the optical fiber, strip a small segment (2.5 cm) of the polymer coating around the optical fiber using wire strippers. Note: This is the portion of the optical fiber that will be used to evanescently couple light into the microtoroid.\nClean the stripped fiber with isopropanol alcohol and a lint free wipe.\nHold this portion of the fiber in place using a fiber holder made of magnetic clamps.\nThin the stripped fiber to ~500 nm by melting and pulling using a hydrogen torch and two stepper motors moving in opposite directions at 60 µm/min. Position the optical fiber inside the top portion of the flame, which should be ~10 mm tall. Stop pulling the fiber when the transmission through the fiber stops fluctuating, which can be monitored either visually (by watching the light that is scattered laterally from the fiber blink on and off) or by connecting the fiber to a photodiode which is attached to an oscilloscope.\nCleave one end of the optical fiber and insert it into a bare fiber adaptor. Place this end of the fiber into the input of the photoreceiver.\nFiber couple the other end of the fiber spool to the laser by using a fiber optic coupler.",
    "Place the microtoroid chip on top of a sample holder (stainless steel, 37.8 mm x 6.4 mm x 3.2 mm) using either epoxy or double sided tape.\nMount the sample holder on top of a positioning stage that comprises of a 3-axis nano-positioning (nanocube) stage (see equipment list) on top of a 3-axis micrometer. Perform all experiments on a pneumatically isolated optical table to minimize vibrations.\nCoarse position the sample chip using the 3-axis micrometer.\nAlign the microtoroid-containing chip parallel to the optical fiber using the nano-positioner. Note: Align the microtoroid within a distance of one wavelength of the input light (~633 nm). For visualization of this process use two imaging columns (tube with objective lens and camera, see equipment list) positioned on the top and on the side of the chip.\nOptimize the polarization of the laser light directed through the optical fiber using an in-line polarization controller (see equipment list) with a knob to adjust the polarization. Note: Optimum polarization is achieved when the measured dip in the transmission of the optical fiber appears the narrowest. Observe this dip on an oscilloscope (see step 2.2 for more details).\nConstruct a sample chamber by epoxying a glass coverslip over the sample stage using a glass microscope slide as a spacer. Note: A Plexiglas enclosure covering the entire setup may be useful for minimizing air currents. A small opening should be left to allow for the solution to be pumped in using tubing.\nThermally equilibrate particle suspensions or single-molecule aqueous solutions for ≥ 1 hr in a RT water bath (~500 ml). Note: Samples are diluted to the desired concentration in microcentrifuge tubes using the associated buffers specified from the manufacturer, e.g., PBS or HEPES. If no binding events are detected, increase the salt concentration of the buffer.",
    "Vortex particle containing solutions (1 ml) briefly for ~2 sec.\nInject particle containing solutions into the sample chamber at 1 ml/min using a 1 ml syringe pump.\nAfter the sample chamber has filled, turn off the syringe pump.\nWait 30 sec before recording data to minimize the effects of mechanical vibrations resulting from fluid flow that can affect the measurement.\n2. Frequency Locking\nRe-couple the toroid to the optical fiber by moving the sample holder with the nanopositioner, because the coupling will be disturbed due to the injection of fluid.\nLocate the resonance wavelength of the microtoroid by scanning the computer-controlled input laser through a variety of wavelengths. Perform this step by sending a triangular waveform voltage signal to a piezoelectric element within the laser controller that regulates the wavelength of the laser. Perform experiments using visible light (635 nm ± 2.5 nm) as there is low absorption of light in water at this wavelength.\nMeasure the light transmission through the optical fiber by plugging the output of the optical fiber into an auto-balanced photoreceiver. Plug the output of the photoreceiver into an oscilloscope using a BNC cable. Observe on the oscilloscope that at the resonance wavelength of the microtoroid, transmission through the optical fiber drops.\nAttach the output of the photoreceiver to the main input of the frequency locking feedback controller (see equipment list) via a cable.\nRun the frequency locking feedback controller in autolock mode using top-of-peak locking with a dither frequency of 2 kHz and an amplitude of wavelength oscillation of 19 fm. Empirically set the proportional-integral-derivative settings in the software window using Ziegler-Nichols tuning rules14. Note: These values need only be set once at the beginning of all experiments.",
    "Auto-lock the wavelength of the laser to the resonance wavelength of the microtoroid. Perform this step after filling the sample chamber. Note: If the wavelength shift is too large, then the feedback controller will lose lock and automatically switch to scanning mode in order to locate the resonance wavelength location. This occurs for wavelength shifts larger than approximately one linewidth (at least 600 fm for all systems investigated here).\nRecord the output of the feedback controller at 20 kHz using a 24-bit data acquisition card. Export the data as a text file via data acquisition software.\n3. Data Processing & Analysis\nFourier transform the data in MATLAB.\nLow pass the data using a \"brick-wall\" filter with a cutoff at 1 kHz to remove the imposed dither frequency of 2 kHz (see Supplemental Code File Screenshot 1).\nComputationally notch filter the data using a window size of 16 Hz. Note: This is done to remove known sources of noise, in this case, 60 Hz electronic line noise and its harmonics, as well 100 Hz (coming from the laser driver) and its harmonics (see Supplemental Code File Screenshot 1).\nInverse Fourier transform the data back into the time domain.\nMedian filter the data using a window size of 1,001 samples (see Supplemental Code File Screenshot 2).\nLocate step changes in the resonance wavelength using the step-finding algorithm of Kerssemakers et al.15.\nGenerate histograms of the amplitude of each binding step.\nCalculate particle size using Eq. (1) (see Discussion).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
