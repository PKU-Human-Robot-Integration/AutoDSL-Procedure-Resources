    "All animal studies are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the authors' institution. Standard animal care facilities including housing chambers, sterile hoods, anesthetization, and ethical endpoint euthanization are required to properly carry out these experiments. All experiments are conducted in compliance with institutional and national guidelines and supervised by the veterinarian staff at the institution. Female BALB/c mice, used for the experiments, are obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials) and ranged in age from 6 to 8 weeks at the start of the study. Sequences for custom-synthesized DNA, crRNA, FRET-based peptide substrate probes, and sensor peptides are provided in Supplementary Table 1.\n1. Protease-activated peptide substrate selection\nCollect and prepare tissue samples from healthy lung or lung tissue with tumor nodules following a previously published report13.\n\t\nHomogenize tissues in pre-chilled phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) (200 mg tissue/mL PBS) with tissue dissociation tubes for the automated dissociation of tissues into single-cell suspensions.\nCentrifuge tissue homogenates at 6,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Retain the supernatant in a new tube.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 14,000 x g for 25 min at 4 °C.\nMeasure the protein concentration using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (see Table of Materials).\nAdd PBS to the sample to prepare a 0.33 mg/mL solution.\nAssess the proteolytic activity following the steps below.\n\t\nIn a 384-well plate, add 5 µL, 6 µM FRET-based peptide substrate probes to each well. For each probe, perform the reaction in triplicate.",
    "NOTE: FRET-based peptide substrate probe contains a short peptide sequence (6-8 amino acids, designed to be specific to a target protease or group of proteases) terminated with a fluorophore and quencher pair. Two FRET probes are described in Supplementary Table 1 as an example. The full library of probes can be found in Hao et al.13.\nCentrifuge the well plate for 10 s at room temperature at 180 x g to ensure the probes are at the bottom of the plate.\nAdd 25 µL 0.33 mg/mL tissue sample or 40 µM recombinant protease13 to each well.\n\t\tNOTE: The final concentration of the tissue sample or recombinant protease may need to be optimized according to their intrinsic proteolytic activity. For instance, highly proteolytic tissues such as intestines may require higher dilution factors to allow for the monitoring of initial enzymatic cleavage.\nCentrifuge the well plate briefly at 180 x g (at room temperature) to mix the probes and tissue lysates.\nImmediately begin detecting probe cleavage by measuring fluorescence with the plate reader at 37 °C every 2 min for 1 h (λex: 485 nm; λem: 535 nm) to monitor the cleavage.\n\t\tNOTE: Use the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths for specific fluorophore and quencher pairs. In the case of this study, parameters (λex: 485 nm and λem: 535 nm) are set for the FAM fluorophore.\nTo analyze the fluorescent measurement data, utilize the Python (see Table of Materials) package for enzyme kinetics analysis available at https://github.com/nharzallah/NNanotech-Kinetic. This script calculates the initial reaction velocity (V0) using the slope of the linear fit of the first 8-10 initial time points.\n2. Sensor formulation and characterization\nSynthesize the conjugate of DNA and protease-activated peptide (PAP).",
    "Incubate 20-mer phosphorothioated DNA reporters with 3'-DBCO group (1.1 eq., see Table of Materials) with azide-terminated PAPs with C-terminus cysteine end in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at room temperature for >4 h. If leaving overnight, incubate at 4 °C.\nPurify the product on a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a column ideal for biomolecules (see Table of Materials). Set the HPLC gradient to start from 5% A buffer (0.05% TFA in H2O), keep isocratic for 20 min, and reach 80% B buffer (0.05% TFA, 99.95% acetonitrile) at 65 min with a flow rate of 0.3 mL min-1, and collect the conjugate product with retention time at ~31 min.\nValidate the purified conjugates by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix14(see Table of Materials).\nSynthesize the DNA-encoded activity-based nanosensors.\n\t\nDissolve 2 mg of multivalent PEG (40 kDa, 8-arm, see Table of Materials) with maleimide-reactive group in 1 mL of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and filter (cutoff: 0.2 µm).\nAdd the cysteine-terminated DNA-peptide conjugates (2 eq., see Table of Materials) to the PEG and react at room temperature for >4 h. If leaving overnight, incubate at 4 °C.\nRemove the unconjugated materials using size exclusion chromatography with a commercially available dextran-agarose composite matrix column on a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) (see Table of Materials). Run samples in PBS and monitor absorbance at 260 nm for DNA and 280 nm for peptide.\nConcentrate the synthesized nanosensors with centrifugal filter tubes (MWCO = 10 kDa) according to the manufacturer's recommended speed (see Table of Materials).\nQuantify the concentration of DNA using ssDNA assay kit (see Table of Materials) and a plate reader at λex: 485 nm and λem: 535 nm. Store the nanosensors at 4 °C.\nCharacterize the DNA-encoded activity-based nanosensors.",
    "Measure the hydrodynamic particle size of DNA-encoded nanosensors by dynamic light scattering (DLS).\n\t\tNOTE: The expected size range of nanosensors is 15-50 nm, with an average size of 20-30 nm. If a limited size range is desired, FPLC (in step 2.3) can be used to isolate narrower fractions with different molecular weights.\nConcentrate the nanosensors to 0.5 mg/mL (by DNA concentration) with centrifugal filter tubes (MWCO = 10 kDa) and load the samples onto a carbon film-coated copper grid mounted on a cryoholder. Observe the morphology using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (200 kV, magnification of 10,000-60,000)14.\n3. Sensor injection and urine collection\nCollect urine for baseline measurement.\n\t\nPlace the mouse into a custom housing chamber (see Supplementary Figure 1) with a 96-well plate as the base.\nRestrain the mouse and apply gentle pressure on the bladder to void any remaining urine onto the plate.\nPipette the collected urine (~100-200 µL) from the 96-well plate into a 1.5 mL tube after replacing the mouse to the normal housing.\nEstablish preclinical murine tumor model.\n\t\nInoculate 6 to 8-week-old BALB/c female mice by intravenous injection with luciferase-expressing MC26-Fluc cell line (100k cells/mouse) (see Table of Materials). Monitor tumor progression weekly using an in vivo fluorescence imaging system.\n\t\tNOTE: Visible tumor burden indicated by luminescent signal occurs approximately in week 2 of injection of this particular cell line. Carefully check on tumor-bearing animals during the tumor progression on a regular basis.\nInject nanosensors at different time points after tumor implantation.\n\t\nPrepare an injection solution (200 µL maximum volume) containing nanosensors at a concentration of 1 nmol by DNA barcode in sterile PBS.\nInject 200 µL sensor solution in PBS into each experimental mouse intravenously.\nCollect urine samples from healthy control and tumor-bearing mice at 1 h after sensor injection as described in steps 1.1-1.3.",
    "​NOTE: Fresh urine samples can be processed to DNA barcode analysis directly or frozen immediately on ice.\n4. CRISPR detection of DNA barcodes: fluorescence-based\nUse fresh urine samples or defrost frozen samples on ice. Centrifuge urine samples at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nCombine the reagents in Supplementary Table 2, add the Cas12a enzyme (see Table of Materials) last and gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down.
