    "The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Instituto de Neurobiología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Mexico and Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia (2018-1-163). The reproduction, care and humane endpoints of the animals were established following the Official Mexican Standard (NOM-062-Z00-1999) based on the “Ley General de Salud en Materia de Investigación para la Salud” (General Health Law for Health Research) of the Mexican Secretaria of Health.\n1. Solutions and stocks preparation\nPrepare an N2 culture medium with 485 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium-F12 (DMEM-F12), 5 mL of N2 supplement (100x), 5 mL of glutamine supplement (100x) and 5 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic (100x).\nPrepare a B27 culture medium with 480 mL of Neurobasal medium, 10 mL of B27 supplement (50x), 5 mL of glutamine supplement, and 5 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic (100x).\nReconstitute collagenase powder in 1x PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline) to obtain aliquots with an activity of 100 units/µL (1000x) and store at -20 °C. Notice, collagenase activity depends on the lot number of the companies.\nPrepare dispase stock aliquots by dissolving 5 mg of dispase powder in 1x PBS (50 mg/mL). Store at -20 °C.\nPrepare an enzymatic solution with 100 mL of DMEM-F12 medium, 50 µL of stock collagenase (100 units/µL) to have a final concentration of 50 U/mL and 333 µL of stock dispase (50 mg/mL) to have a final concentration of 0.33 mg/mL.\nTo prepare a washing solution, to 1,000 mL of 1x PBS, add 0.4766 g of HEPES (final concentration 2 mM), 3.6 g of D-glucose (final concentration 20 mM) and 2.1 g of NaHCO3 (final concentration 25 mM).\nPrepare poly-L-ornithine stock aliquots (1 mg/mL) using sterile water and store at -20 °C.",
    "Prepare a working solution of poly-L-ornithine. Dilute a stock aliquot (1mg/mL) in 49 mL of sterile water for a final concentration of 20 µg/mL.\nPrepare a working solution of laminin. Dilute 25 µL of laminin (1 mg/mL original stock) in 5 mL of sterile water for a final concentration of 5 µg/mL.\n\tNOTE: After preparation, filter the culture media, working and stock solutions to avoid contamination. Use a syringe or bottle-top vacuum filters (polyethersulfone membrane with a 0.2 µm pore size). The culture media and work solutions can be stored for up to 30 days at 4 °C, while the stocks can be stored for up to four months at -20 °C.\n2. Preparation before starting the microdissection\nSterilize surgical instruments by autoclaving or with a hot glass bead dry sterilizer.\nClean the microdissection surface area under strict aseptic and antiseptic conditions (e.g., with ozonized water).\n\tNOTE: The timing of microdissection of both neurogenic niches from each vole brain is approximately 30 min. Working with 1-4 animals for the entire procedure is recommended.\n3. Extraction of the whole brain\nAnesthetize the adult vole (12-16 weeks) with an overdose of pentobarbital (6.3 mg/animal) through intraperitoneal injection. Verify the depth of anesthesia by the absence of pedal reflex in response to a firm toe pinch.\nOnce the vole is entirely anesthetized, induce euthanasia by decapitation and recover the head.\nDissect the skin from the skull with scissors, making a caudal-rostral incision (15 mm long) to expose the skull.\nCut the occipital and interparietal bones and trace an incision into the skull along the sagittal and parietal sutures.\nMake a hole in the skull at the junction of frontal and parietal bones using scissors, being very careful not to damage the brain tissue.",
    "To expose the brain, remove the remaining cranium fragments that cover both brain hemispheres with sharp-pointed tweezers.\nUse a stainless-steel spatula to lift the entire brain from the cranial base.\nCollect the brain into a centrifuge tube (50 mL) with 20 mL of cold wash solution.\nWash the brain twice with the cold wash solution.\n4. Microdissection of the neural tissue\nPlace a Petri dish on a surface surrounded by ice.\nDeposit the brain on the dish and add 20 mL of cold wash solution.\nWith a scalpel, in the coronal plane, divide the brain into two blocks of tissue (rostral and caudal). As a neuroanatomical reference, perform the coronal cut at Bregma level in the anterior-posterior axis11 (Figure 1A, solid line).\nFrom the rostral block, extract the VZ tissue (Figure 1B), while from the caudal block remove the DG (Figure 1C).\nDissect the VZ under a stereo microscope.\n\t\nWith a Dumont forceps, hold one of the hemispheres; then, insert, at the height of the ventricle, the fine tips of a second Dumont forceps under the tissue that lines the caudate-putamen (Figure 2A).\nOpen the forceps along the dorsoventral axis to separate the tissue.\nCollect the VZ tissue per individual in a centrifuge tube with 2 mL of cold wash solution. Do not pool the tissue of more than two animals.\nRepeat the microdissection in the other hemisphere.\nStore the tube containing the bilateral VZ tissue on ice and continue dissecting the DG.\nDissect the DG from the caudal block under a stereo microscope.",
    "With a scalpel, make a coronal cut into the block to obtain two slices, in which the hippocampal formation is observed. As a landmark, the cut is made at -2 mm Bregma coordinates in the anterior-posterior axis according to the mouse brain atlas11 (Figure 1A, dotted line and Figure 1C).\nWith a Dumont forceps, hold one of the slices, and with fine-point Dumont forceps make a horizontal cut between DG and CA1 and then perform a vertical incision between the DG and CA3 to separate the DG (Figure 2B).\nRepeat the dissection in the first slice of the other hemisphere.\nRepeat the dissection in both hemispheres in the second slice.\nCollect the four DG pieces of each vole in a centrifuge tube. Do not pool the DG tissue of more than two animals.\n\t\tNOTE: If dissection of more than one animal is required, store the centrifuge tubes with the VZ or DG tissue on ice while continuing to dissect the rest of the brains. Remove all blood vessels that cover the brain tissue while dissecting. If the vessels are not discarded, the culture could be mixed with an excess of erythrocytes and disturb neurosphere formation.\n5. Isolation of neural cells\nPlace the centrifuge tubes inside the biosafety cabinet and wait about 10 min for the tissue fragments to precipitate by gravity.\nRemove the wash solution and add 1 mL of the warm enzymatic solution to each tube.\nIncubate the tubes at 37 °C for 10 min.\nDisintegrate the tissue fragments; pipette up and down with a 1 mL tip. Do not pipette more than 30x.\nCarry out a second incubation of 10 min at 37 °C.\nAt the end of the second incubation, pipette to break up the tissues. Do not pipette more than 30x.",
    "NOTE: After pipetting, the tissue fragments should be completely disintegrated; if they are not disintegrated, incubate for another 10 min at 37 °C and re-pipette. The digestion period should not exceed 30 min.\nAdd 9 mL of N2 medium per tube to dilute the enzymatic treatment.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash with 10 mL of N2 medium.\nCentrifuge under the same conditions as step 5.8.\nRemove the supernatant from each tube and resuspend the cell pellets of the VZ and DG in 2 mL and 1 mL of the B27 medium, respectively.\nTo remove any non-disintegrated tissue, filter each cellular suspension using a cell strainer (size 40 µm).\n6. Neurospheres formation\nCulture the cells passed through the strainer into an ultra-low attachment, 24-well plate. Use two wells for the VZ and one well for the DG (1 mL of B27 medium/well).\nAdd 20 ng/mL of FGF2 and 20 ng/mL of EGF to each well (final concentration 1x).\nIncubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and high humidity (90-95%). Do not disturb for 48 h (day 1 and day 2 of culture, D1-D2).\nOn the third day (D3), remove half of the culture medium and replace it with fresh B27 medium (500 µL per well) supplemented with double concentration (2x) of growth factors.\nRepeat every third day, change the culture medium (half of it) and replace it with a fresh B27 medium supplemented with double concentration (2x) of growth factors.\nOn days when it is not necessary to change the culture medium, add growth factors to a final concentration of 1x.\nEnsure that the neurospheres are formed around D8-D10.\nAt the D10, change the complete culture medium to remove all debris.",
    "Collect the medium and neurospheres individually of each well in centrifuge tubes.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature. This procedure allows neurospheres precipitation by gravity.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of fresh B27 medium supplemented with growth factors.\nPlace the neurospheres back into the same ultra-low attachment plate and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nFrom D10 to D15, continue changing half of the medium and adding growth factors.\n7. Passage of the neurospheres\nAt D15 of the primary culture, collect the neurospheres into centrifuge tubes using 1 mL pipette. Cut the pipette tip to increase the size of the opening to avoid damage to the neurospheres.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature. Neurospheres precipitate by gravity.\nRemove the medium and add 1 mL of the cell detachment medium per tube.\nIncubate the tubes for 7 min at 37 °C.\nPipette up and down with a 1 mL tip to dismantle the neurospheres.\nDilute the cell detachment medium with 3 mL of B27 medium per tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 200 x g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet with a fresh B27 medium supplemented with growth factors.\n\t\nResuspend the VZ-derived cells in 4 mL of medium and the DG-derived cells in 2 mL of medium.\nCulture the cells (passage 1) in a new ultra-low attachment plate by doubling the number of wells that were used in the primary culture (4 and 2 wells for VZ and DG, respectively).\nChange half of the medium every third day and add growth factors daily.\nAfter 10 days (D10) in passage 1, change to adherent conditions in the next passage.\n8. The passage in adherent conditions\nBefore carrying out the passage 2, prepare coated plates with poly-L-ornithine and laminin.",
    "In 24-well plates, add 500 µL of 1x poly-L-ornithine (20 µg/mL) per well. Incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nRemove the poly-L-ornithine and wash 4x with 1x PBS (500 µL/well).\nAdd 200 µL (minimum volume to cover the surface of a single well) of 1x laminin (5 µg/mL) per well and incubate for 2-3 h at 37 °C before cultivating the cells.\nCollect the neurospheres with 1 mL pipette with cut tips into a centrifuge tube.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature to precipitate the neurospheres by gravity.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the neurospheres in fresh B27 medium without growth factors.\nAspirate the laminin from the coated plate and deposit the neurospheres into the wells using 1 mL pipettes with cut tips.\n\tNOTE: Prevent coated wells from drying out between laminin removal and plating neurospheres.\nDivide the culture into two conditions:\n\t\nMaintain differentiated neurospheres for 6 days (D6). Change the medium every third day and add growth factors daily.\nObserve differentiation of the neurosphere-derived cells by 12 days (D12). Change the medium every third day without growth factors.\n\t\tNOTE: At the end of D6 for undifferentiated or D12 for differentiation conditions, the cells can be used for conventional immunohistochemistry, cell sorting analysis, 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, RNA extraction, among others.\nSubscription Required.
