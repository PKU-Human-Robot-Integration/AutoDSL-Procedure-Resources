If necessary, dilute MDA-LDL with PBS 1× by adding first the MDA-LDL and next, the PBS 1×.\nNote: Mix the MDA-LDL CFA mixture in the injection syringe with a 23 G needle by pulling the plunger up and down until a whitish homogeneous mixture is observed.\nHigh fat diet (HFD)\nStart feeding the mice with HFD 1% cholesterol at 8 weeks after the first immunization until week 10.",
    "Feed the mice with HFD 1.25% cholesterol at 10 weeks until week 23.\nNote: The specific HFD used in this protocol was chosen based on the protocol of atherosclerosis induction described by Freigang et al., 1998.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] For different experiments, optimize your HFD protocol.\nAtherosclerosis burden analysis\nTiming: 2 weeks\nIn these steps we describe the quantification of atherosclerosis burden in the aortic root of the immunized BMT chimeras.\nExtract mouse hearts.\nEuthanize immunized BMT chimeras by placing them into a CO2 cage (>70% CO2) until no breath movements are observed.\nBefore proceeding, confirm the mouse is dead by pressing the footpad and detecting no movement.\nExpose the chest cavity.\nCut the femoral artery and perfuse the mouse with 10 mL of PBS 1× through the left ventricle using a 10 mL syringe and a 25 G needle.\nRemove the esophagus, the trachea and the lungs in order to expose the heart and the aorta.\nClean carefully the aorta using tweezers and separate the heart.\nOptional: Save the aortas to analyze atherosclerotic burden in the aortic arch and the thoracic aorta.\nProcess the hearts for histology analysis.\nFix the heart in formaldehyde 4% for 2 h at RT (20°C–25°C) in a 15 mL tube.\nRemove formaldehyde and incubate the hearts in sucrose 30% at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nNote: Properly included organ precipitates to the bottom of the 15 mL tube.

    "Include the heart in a central orientation where you see the ascending aorta in the center of the cryomold.\nOnce the heart is placed properly, start to freeze the OCT block by placing it on dry ice pellets.\nWait until the OCT block is totally frozen, store it at −80°C.\nNote: Prepare the 33% OCT by adding the PBS 1× and, subsequently, the OCT. Mix well and centrifuge at RT 10 min at 450 g to remove the bubbles.\nCritical: OCT blocks must be stored at −80°C.They will be stable for several years at this temperature.\nCritical: formaldehyde is a harmful for humans.

The wounds produced by this type of blades could be especially harmful.\nNote: OCT sections can be stored for several years at −80°C.\nNote: Using Superfrost slides facilitates the attachment of the aortic root sections to the slide.\nStain aortic root sections with Oil-red-O.",
