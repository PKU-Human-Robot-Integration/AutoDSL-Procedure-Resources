    "All animal procedures represented in this work were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kansas.\n1. Antigen array synthesis (4–6 days)\nFunctionalize unmodified antigen with an alkyne handle (1 h). Add 1 equivalent insulin (100 mg, 17.4 μmol) to a 20 mL glass vial with a stir bar and dissolve in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (2 mL) with gentle heating to 40–50 °C using a heat-gun or water bath.\n\t\nAdd 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (40.2 mg, 348.8 μmol) and 1.35 equivalents freshly prepared 78.5 mM propargyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-ester) stock solution in anhydrous DMSO (0.3 mL, 5.3 mg, 23.6 μmol).\nStir for 30 min at room temperature then quench the reaction with 0.05% HCl (12 mL).\nPurify the singly modified insulin-alkyne by reverse-phase liquid chromatography (4 h). Use a preparative C18 column (19 mm x 250 mm, 300 A pore size, 5 μm particle size) with a 10 min 30–40% B gradient (A, water with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); B, acetonitrile with 0.05% TFA) and a flow rate of 14 mL/min. The desired product elutes immediately after unmodified insulin.\n\t\nEvaporate acetonitrile and TFA by nitrogen gas stream or rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (650 Pascals) and rotating at 150 rpm. Freeze the aqueous solution and lyophilize to dryness. Store functionalized insulin at -20 °C under a dry atmosphere.\n\t\tNOTE: The functionalized insulin is stable for up to a year under these storage conditions.\nSynthesize the antigen array by copper-catalyzed, azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) (2.5 h)22. Add 6 equivalents insulin-alkyne (38 mg, 6.3 μmol) to a 10 mL glass vial with a stir bar and dissolve in DMSO (1.2 mL) with gentle heating.",
    "Add 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (1.8 mL) pH 7.4, 1 equivalent 20 kDa 4-arm PEG azide (21 mg, 1.05 μmol), copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (3.15 mg, 12.6 μmol), Tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine (27.37 mg, 63 μmol), and sodium ascorbate (50.34 mg, 254 μmol).\nStir for 2 h at room temperature then add DMSO (3 mL) to solubilize any precipitates and acidify the solution with 0.05% HCl (4 mL).\nPurify the antigen array by reverse-phase liquid chromatography (3 h). Use a preparative C18 column (19 mm x 250 mm, 300 A pore size, 5 µm particle size) with a 10 min 20–60% B gradient (A, water with 0.05% TFA; B, acetonitrile with 0.05% TFA) and a flow rate of 14 ml/min. The desired product elutes immediately after insulin-alkyne.\n\t\nEvaporate acetonitrile by nitrogen gas stream or rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. Freeze the aqueous solution and lyophilize to dryness. Store at -20 °C under a dry atmosphere.\n\t\tNOTE: The insulin antigen array is highly hygroscopic. The lyophilized fibers may coalesce into a dense pellet after repeated exposure to the atmosphere. FAA properties may differ depending on the application-specific antigen used. The insulin antigen array is stable for several months under these storage conditions.\n2. Fluorophore conjugation (1–2 days)\nConjugate the fluorophore to the antigen array (2.5 h). Add 1 equivalent tetravalent insulin (21.7 mg, 0.5 μmol) to a 20 mL glass vial with stir bar and dissolve in DMSO (1.75 mL) with gentle heating. Add freshly prepared 100 mM carbonate buffer (8 mL) pH 9.0 and 5 equivalents of fluorescein isothiocyanate in a freshly prepared 10 mM stock solution in DMSO (0.25 ml, 0.97 mg, 2.5 μmol). Stir for 2 h in the dark at room temperature.",
    "Purify the product by dialysis (24 h). Use 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff dialysis tubing in a stirred 5 L bucket with distilled water in the dark at room temperature. Dialyze for 24 h and change the dialysis solution every 6–12 h.\nFreeze the dialyzed solution and lyophilize to dryness to yield the FAA. Store in the dark under a dry atmosphere at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: The FAA is stable for several months under these storage conditions.\n3. FAA characterization (2–4 h)\nAnalyze the products of steps 1 and 2 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli25 (2 h). Prepare samples containing 5 μg of purified monovalent antigen, 20 kDa 4-arm PEG azide, antigen array, and FAA.\n\t\nVisualize fluorophore labeling in the FAA samples by fluorescence imaging in a gel-imager.\nPerform Coomassie blue staining26 to visualize the antigen.\nPerform iodine staining27 to visualize the PEG backbone. Rinse the gel in distilled water (3 x 2 min), incubate in 5% barium chloride solution (20 mL) for 10 min, rinse in distilled water (3 x 2 min), incubate in 0.1 N iodine solution (20 mL) for 1 min, then rinse in distilled water (3 x 2 min) to remove background staining before visualization.\n\t\tNOTE: To make 0.1 N iodine solution, add potassium iodide (2.0 g, 12 mmol) and iodine (1.27 g, 5 mmol) to 100 mL distilled water.\nCalculate the degree of dye-labeling by UV-Vis spectroscopy (1 h). Dissolve a small amount of FAA at 0.1 mg/mL and record the absorbance at 280 nm and the peak absorption wavelength for the dye. Obtain the molar extinction coefficients for the antigen and the dye.",
    "NOTE: Some dyes are pH sensitive. Make sure to use an appropriately buffered solution like100 mM carbonate buffer with pH 8.3 when measuring the FAA absorbance to ensure the reported dye extinction coefficient is accurate.\n\t\nPerform the following calculation28 where ADye, maxλ is the FAA absorbance at the peak absorption wavelength for the dye, EDye, maxλ is the molar extinction coefficient at the peak absorption wavelength for the dye, and Eantigen, 280 nm is the molar extinction coefficient for monovalent antigen at 280 nm.:\n\t\tCorrection Factor (CF) = ADye, 280 nm / ADye, maxλ 0.25 * (ADye, maxλ / EDye, maxλ) * (Eantigen, 280 nm / (A280 nm – (ADye, maxλ * CF))) = dye/FAA\nAnalyze the FAA for free dye or potential degradation products by RP-HPLC (1 h).\n\t\nDissolve a small amount of FAA at 1.0 mg/mL and analyze with an analytical C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 300 A pore size, 2.5 μm particle size) using a 10 min 5–95% B gradient (A, water with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid: B, acetonitrile with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Set the UV-Vis detector to monitor the peak absorbance wavelength of the dye (437 nm for FITC).\n\t\tNOTE: For pH sensitive dyes, HPLC analysis in acidified solvents may require shifting the monitored wavelength from the dye’s peak absorption wavelength in neutral, aqueous conditions. In 0.05% TFA, the pH is approximately 3 and the max absorption for FITC has shifted.\n4. Assay development by FAA titration (3–5 h)",
    "NOTE: FAA use for flow cytometry is presented, but the same steps can be modified for use in other formats such as immunohistochemistry or fluorescent microscopy. When applying FAAs for a new format, a new optimization assay must be completed. Mixed or isolated cell populations may be obtained through blood or lymphoid organ processing methods23,29. Harvest through enzymatic digestion of tissue is not recommended, as cells surface markers may be shed.\nSuspend FAA stock to 1 mg/mL in FACS buffer (1x PBS + 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% sodium azide). Up to 10% DMSO can be incorporated to accelerate dissolution.\nObtain cells positive for antigen-specific B cells of interest and dispense into microcentrifuge tubes. Approximately 1 x 107 total cells will be required.\n\tNOTE: Splenocytes were harvested from VH125 and EAE mice according to IACUC-approved protocols at the University of Kansas for the present demonstration. Researchers may employ the methods described herein for cell samples specific to their own application and FAA preparation.\n\t\nDispense 5 x 105 cells for titration labeling replicates (at least 3 replicates per titration).\nDispense 1 x 105 cells for single-stain controls as well as an unstained control.\n\t\tNOTE: Antibody isotypes and fluorescence minus one control may also be used to fully validate the assay.\nWash cells by adding 1 mL of FACS buffer to each tube. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets in 50 µL of FACS buffer.\nAdd CD3 and CD19 fluorescent antibodies to each sample at manufacturer recommended concentrations, as well as titrated FAA doses.",
    "NOTE: Fluorescent antibody working concentrations may be titrated independently to confirm the lot integrity. Appropriate FAA dose ranges will vary by application, but a good starting point is 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 μg per sample. 1 µL of stock FAA solution equals 1 µg of dose.\nMix each sample well and incubate covered from light, on ice for 30 min.\nAfter the incubation, wash cells by adding 1 mL of FACS buffer to each tube. Centrifuge the samples at 200 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and repeat the wash by adding 1 mL of FACS buffer to each tube. Centrifuge the samples at 200 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the samples in 200 µL of fresh FACS buffer. Place the samples on ice and head to the cytometer.\nRun the samples on the cytometer and collect at least 50,000 events.\n5. FAA titration analysis and labeling dose optimization (1–2 h)\nUsing flow cytometry analysis software, gate for single cells.\nOn single cells, place gates for CD19+ (B cells) and CD3+ (T cells).\nWithin CD19+ and CD3+ parent populations, gate for FAA+ events in the relevant fluorochrome channel.\nRecord the percentage of FAA+ events within the CD19+ and CD3+ parent populations.\nCalculate a specificity ratio by dividing the proportion of FAA+ events in the CD19+ population (specific) by the proportion of FAA+ events in the CD3+ population (nonspecific). Specificity ratio should be maximized for successful FAA use.\nEmploy the labeling dose corresponding to the highest specificity ratio for future experiments.\nSubscription Required.
