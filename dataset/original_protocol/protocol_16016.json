    "The SIMBA system involves the utilization of three key components: dCas9-sgRNA complex carrying multiple (24×, 8×, 4×, 2×, 1×) SunTag, rapamycin-inducible dimerization system–based scFv-FKBP, and FRB-mCherry-HP1α as the reporter unit. The cloning procedures can be summarized as follows: (1) generation of the dCas9-SunTag/scFv-FKBP/FRB-mCherry fragments, (2) integration of components by ligating coding fragments and inserting them into linearized vector by Gibson Assembly or Golden Gate Assembly, and (3) validation of the construct by restriction enzyme digestion and/or Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/76f425a0-6664-41e9-9d00-0b87ee05065e/cpz1947-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nIllustration of the essential protocols for implementing the SIMBA (Simultaneous Imaging and Manipulation of Genomic Loci by Biomolecular Assemblies) system, enabling the real-time visualization and manipulation of genomic loci in living cells. Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0001] involves the design and construction of genetic constructs. The process begins with gene subcloning into a vector, followed by vector linearization. Recombination techniques are then applied to create the desired genetic construct, which undergoes a further verification. In Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0002], plasmids containing genetic constructs are transfected into target mammalian cells. This allows for live-cell imaging, enabling real-time visualization of the system's components, including dCas9-SunTag and FRB-mCherry-HP1α. Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0003] involves the production of lentiviral vectors carrying SIMBA system components. These lentiviruses are used to infect target cells, and positively expressing cells are subsequently sorted and isolated, establishing a stable cell population with consistent SIMBA component expression. In Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0004], either transiently transfected cells or stable cell lines expressing the SIMBA system components can result in the formation of biomolecular assemblies (BAs) at specific genomic loci upon rapamycin induction. This assembly undertakes simultaneous gene labeling and manipulation. Imaging or RNA-seq analysis may be performed to investigate chromatin dynamics and gene expression changes.\nMaterials\nAddgene plasmids (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-tbl-0001])\n1× ampicillin LB agar plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-rec-0001])\nStbl3 competent cells (Invitrogen, C737303)",

Prepare the basic Addgene plasmids (see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-tbl-0001]) containing the components for SIMBA and the related systems. Order any necessary constructs with building cassettes from Addgene (https://www.addgene.org[href=https://www.addgene.org]) and check if any plasmid or bacterial stock already exists in the lab.\nA sufficient amount of plasmid and good quality are critical for successful cloning. Both the quantity and the quality of the plasmid could be evaluated using a spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop equipment).\n2. Amplify the plasmid components to obtain a sufficient number of copies. For those in bacterial glycerol stock, streak on 1× ampicillin LB agar plates with screening antibiotic using bacteria-spreading glass beads to obtain single colonies. For simple plasmid amplification, transform Stbl3 competent cells in S.O.C. medium with 42°C heat shock in a water bath following the manufacturer's protocol. Then, streak transformed bacteria on LB agar plates to obtain single colonies. Incubate at 37°C overnight (16 to 18 hr) in a bacterial incubator.\n3. Pick a single colony on the LB agar plate for each plasmid and inoculate into 5 ml of 1× ampicillin LB culture medium with selective antibiotics in a disposable 14-ml incubation tube. Incubate at 37°C and 250 rpm overnight (16 to 18 hr) in an incubator shaker with sufficient aeration.",
    "4. Take a small aliquot (100 to 200 μl bacterial culture) and mix with 1 volume of 50% (v/v) glycerol in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube or cryovial to prepare glycerol stock. Store stock at −80°C for long-term storage. Spin down the remaining culture for 5 min at 5000 × g. Extract plasmid DNA using GenElute HP Plasmid DNA Miniprep Kit following the manufacturer's protocol.\n5. Elute plasmid DNA with 30 to 60 μl molecular biology–grade water. Measure the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.\n6. Verify the amplified plasmid by Sanger sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion.\nPreparation of basic coding cassettes and vector backbone for recombination\n7. Design and obtain the appropriate primers for cassette cloning (containing 20- to 25-bp annealing region) with a homologous arm region (16 to 25 bp with Tm ≥ 48°C) for Gibson Assembly.\nSee Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-tbl-0002].\n8. For plasmid construct for the expression of basic components of SIMBA system, first acquire the following coding sequences by PCR using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase following the manufacturer's protocol: dCas9-24×SunTag from pHRdSV40-NLS-dCas9-24xGCN4_v4-NLS-P2A-BFP-dWPRE (Addgene, #60910), scFv from pHR-scFv-GCN4-sfGFP-GB1-NLS-dWPRE (Addgene, #60906), FKBP, FRB, mCherry (from template pHR-FUSN-mCh-Cry2WT, Addgene, #101223), and HP1α from human cDNA (sequences are provided in Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#support-information-section]).\n9. Prepare the pHR vector backbone from pHR_PGK_antiCD19_synNotch_Gal4VP64 by double digestion with EcoRI and NotI using the following digestion reaction: 400 ng plasmid, 2 μl of 10× rCutSmart Buffer, 0.5 μl EcoRI, 0.5 μl NotI, and molecular biology–grade water to 20 μl.\n10. Recover the linearized vector fragment by agarose gel electrophoresis and gel recovery using the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit.",
    "11. Build expression vector for each of the components by Gibson Assembly, including dCas9-24×SunTag, scFv-FKBP, and FRB-mCherry-HP1α, preparing the reaction mix using Gibson Assembly Master Mix following the manufacturer's protocol. Mix by pipetting, perform a quick spin, and then incubate at 50°C for 15 min in a thermocycler.\nFor example, pHR-FRB-mCherry-HP1α was constructed by assembling linearized pHR-mCherry-HP1α vector and fragment FRB with overlapping regions at both ends. The reaction included a molar ratio of vector to fragment (size < 200 bp) of 1:10, 100 ng linearized pHR-mCherry-HP1α vector, 30 ng FRB fragment, 5 µl 2× Gibson Assembly mix, and molecular biology–grade water to 10 µl.\n12. Amplify and screen for successful clones by transformation of reaction product into Stbl3 competent cells and streak on an ampicillin-selective LB plate.\n13. Verify the construct by Sanger sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion.\nBy this point, the expression vectors for dCas9-24×SunTag, scFv-FKBP, and FRB-mCherry-HP1α have been acquired.\nsgRNA expression vector subcloning\n14. Design the 20-nt targeting sequence sgRNA sequence for specific labeling loci or look up from previous publications.\nThe sgRNA expression vector for dCas9 complex targeting and labeling is another important component. We list some useful sgRNA targeting sequences used in the SIMBA system in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-tbl-0002].\n15. Synthesize sgRNA oligos carrying specific targeting sequences with 5′-annealing sequence as indicated below:\n         \nForward: 5′-ACCG-(+) targeting sequence-3′\nReverse: 5′-AAAC-(-) targeting sequence-3′\nFor examples of targeting sequences, please refer to Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-tbl-0003] (list of sgRNAs in SIMBA system).\n16. Anneal the sgRNA oligo pair in the following reaction system in a 0.2-ml PCR tube: 40 μl annealing buffer (100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA), 5 μl of 100 μM Forward oligo, 5 μl of 100 μM Reverse oligo (total volume: 50 μl).",
    "17. Incubate the PCR tube containing reaction system in a thermocycler at 95°C for 3 min and then slowly cool to 25°C with a ramp rate of 0.5°C/s. Then, dilute 5 μl annealed oligos with 245 μl water to a final concentration of 200 nM, which is ∼3 ng/μl and ready for use.\n18. Subclone the annealed sgRNA to the pLH vector by Golden Gate Assembly with the following reaction mix: 100 ng pLH-sgRNA1-MS2-PP7, 0.3 μl T7 DNA ligase, 1 μl of 10× rCutSmart Buffer, 0.5 μl BbsI, 1 μl of 10 mM ATP, 1 μl of 200 nM annealed oligos, and water to 10 μl.\n19. Incubate the reaction at 37°C for 15 min in a thermocycler or incubator and then transform 2 μl reaction mix into 25 μl Stbl3 competent cells for further amplification to obtain single clones.\n20. Examine the single clones by Sanger sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion.\nHere, sgRNA with MS2-PP7 backbone–expressing vector has been acquired.\nSIMBA constructs\n21. For SIMBA imaging and further lentivirus packaging, subclone the sgRNA to the pHR vector by Gibson Assembly following the manufacturer's protocol.\n22. For orthogonal fluorescent labeling of dCas9-sgRNA complex using BiFC, visualize the transcribed sgRNA-MS2-PP7 by the complementary Venus fluorescent protein. To this end, perform PCR on the N- and C-split Venus components from pBiFC-bJunVN155(I152L) and pBiFC-bFosVC155, respectively. Then, insert N-Venus into pHAGE-EFS-MCP-3×BFP-NLS and C-Venus into pHAGE-EFS-PCP-3×GFP-NLS in between the BamHI and XhoI sites, to replace 3×BFP or 3×GFP, by Gibson Assembly or ligation, respectively.\nCRISPR dCas9-sgRNA complex, which functions as a targeting unit to specific gene loci, could be substituted by other genomic DNA-binding units. Here, we demonstrate this with NFAT1, a transcription factor. The NFAT1 and 8×SunTag fragments were respectively PCR-amplified and then recombined into the pHR vector by Gibson Assembly.",
    "For BA formation, other IDR sequence–containing components besides HP1α could also be used as the reporter unit in the SIMBA system. Here, we demonstrate this by using the N-terminal region of the human FUS (fused in sarcoma) protein (FUSN) to replace HP1α in the construct FRB-mCherry-HP1α (i.e., FRB-mCherry-FUSN).\n23. Amplify the corresponding plasmids for either experimental usage or storage.\nTo better coordinate the delivery of SIMBA components, all-in-one constructs of NFAT1-8×SunTag-P2A-scFv-FKBP-T2A-FRB-mCherry-HP1α and dCas9-8×SunTag-P2A-scFv-FKBP-T2A-FRB-mCherry-HP1α can be generated from previous constructs and subcloned into the PiggyBac vector PB-iMYOD1-P2A-GFP-Puro.",
    "Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0001] yields the essential constructs needed for delivery and expression in mammalian cells. To assess the functionality of the SIMBA system, transient transfection is performed in HEK 293T cells (ATCC®, CRL-3216). Upon successful transfection, rapamycin treatment is administered to the transfected cells, initiating the dimerization of FKBP-FRB. Subsequently, images of BAs in the transfected cells are captured following rapamycin treatment, facilitating the visualization of genomic loci (refer to Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-fig-0002]). Specific SIMBA-labeled puncta undergo analysis based on SNR, employing established methods for SNR assessment as detailed in prior studies (Mao et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-bib-0026]). This experimental trajectory serves to validate the potential of the SIMBA system at the live-cell level.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9f94e69c-c8d5-448e-ac3a-a391a755dff8/cpz1947-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSIMBA puncta induction and imaging.

    "NOTE: All solutions and equipment coming into contact with cells must be sterile, and proper sterile technique should be used accordingly.\nNOTE: All culture incubations are performed in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\n1. Prepare the plasmids of SIMBA imaging components for gene locus visualization for transfection (see Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-tbl-0004]): dCas9-24×SunTag, sgRNA-encoding plasmid targeting the locus of interest, the binding unit scFv-FKBP, and the reporter unit FRB-mCherry-HP1α.\nA sufficient amount and concentration of plasmids are vital for a successful transfection. Usually, an expanded volume and/or duration of bacterial culture containing the clone of interest could result in more copies of plasmid in an extraction.\n2. One day before transfection, seed 0.2 × 106 HEK 293T cells per well onto 12-well plates to obtain 70% to 90% confluency by the time of transfection (no longer than 24 hr after cell seeding). Culture cells in complete DMEM in a humidified incubator at 37°C supplemented with 5% CO2.\nEnsure that the cells have good viability and are without contamination before use.\n3. Incubate overnight to reach 70% to 90% confluency for optimal transfection performance. Exchange medium with fresh medium before transfection.\n4. Transfect the corresponding plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. For transfection of one well of cells, prepare two 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes separately: (a) 50 μl Opti-MEM medium with 1.5 μl Lipofectamine 3000 reagent and (b) 50 μl Opti-MEM with plasmid to transfect and P3000 reagent at a ratio of 1:2 (w/v), i.e., 2 μl P3000 reagent per 1 µg plasmid. Mix contents of tube (a) with contents of tube (b) and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Then, add the mixture to the culture well.",
    "Use the following amounts of plasmids for transfection of SIMBA components (for one well of 12-well plate): 60 ng dCas9-24×SunTag, 60 ng scFv-FKBP, 60 ng FRB-mCherry-HP1α, and 300 ng sgRNA.\nFor orthogonal imaging with SIMBA and BiFC, using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent, transfect HEK 293T cells with the following plasmids: 60 ng dCas9-24×SunTag-P2A-BFP, 300 ng sgRNA-MS2-PP7, 60 ng scFv-FKBP, 60 ng FRB-mCherry-HP1α, 8 ng MCP-N-Venus, and 8 ng PCP-C-Venus.\nNote that the sgRNA sequence varies when targeting different intended gene loci for imaging. Representative sgRNA sequences with their target genes are shown in Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-tbl-0003].\n5. Seed the transfected cells onto glass-bottom dishes (one well per dish in complete DMEM) coated with fibronectin at 24 hr after transfection.\n6. Add 100 μM rapamycin stock to medium to a final concentration of 100 nM at 2 hr before imaging. Add the same amount of DMSO to the cells of control group. At 36 to 48 hr after transfection, switch medium to live-cell imaging solution without phenol red for best imaging quality and image the cells using a confocal microscope.\n7. Use MetaFluor software and/or ImageJ for imaging data analysis. Spot SIMBA puncta manually to determine their average intensity. Quantify background signals from regions within the nucleus outside of the puncta area and the nucleolus, allowing measurement of the average background intensity and standard deviation.\n8. Determine the SNRs by dividing the corrected SIMBA puncta signal (average SIMBA puncta intensity subtracted mean background intensity) by the standard deviation of the background signal.

    "Generating a stable cell line expressing the desired components can provide stable expression and induction levels for further imaging and analysis.

Day 1: Ensure that cells cultured overnight have reached ∼80% confluency for optimal transfection performance. Exchange medium with fresh culture medium at 3 hr before transfection. Then, transfect the cells with the following plasmids: 5 μg pCMV-VSV-G, 5 μg pCMV ΔR8.2, and 10 μg of the SIMBA lentiviral plasmids (dCas9-8×SunTag-P2A-EGFP, scFv-FKBP-T2A-FRB-mCherry-HP1α, sgRNA). Perform transfection using ProFection® Mammalian Transfection System following the manufacturer's protocol.",
    "A sufficient amount of plasmids is vital for successful lentivirus production. Expand plasmid copies according to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0001] and perform maxi prep using a HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, 12662) following the manufacturer's protocol.

Exchange medium with fresh medium before virus infection.\nThe U2OS cell line is used for lentivirus infection, generating a stable cell line for further imaging and manipulation.\n5. For lentivirus infection, pre-mix virus with 4 µg/ml polybrene (from 10 mg/ml stock). Then, dilute 10 μl SIMBA virus from step 3 10-fold in complete DMEM and add to cells. Infect the cells for 24 hr.\n6. Sort the SIMBA-transduced cells (mCherry-positive) using a FACS sorter 3 days post-infection. Passage the stable cell lines at least six times after sorting before rapamycin induction for experiments (see step 7).",
    "To passage the cells, aspirate the culture medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) completely. Wash once with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove any residual medium and aspirate completely. Then, add one volume of 0.25% trypsin solution to cover the cells and digest at room temperature or 37°C till most of the cells detach from the culture plate surface. Add more than 2 volumes of complete cell culture medium to terminate digestion. Gently pipet the cells off the plate and collect the cells for 5 min at 500 × g. Discard the supernatant with trypsin and resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml complete culture medium. Seed ∼200 μl cells for sub-culture.\nImaging using SIMBA stable cell lines\n7. Seed the stable cell line in 1 ml medium in a glass-bottom dish coated with fibronectin and prepare for imaging with 100 nM rapamycin induction 6 hr in advance. Add the same amount of DMSO to the cells of control group.\nThe U2OS cell line expressing SIMBA system works well as a tool for long-term and stable imaging at specific genomic loci.\n8. Image cells using a confocal microscope and analyze as in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0002], steps 7 and 8.",
    "The SIMBA system allows genomic loci labeling and manipulation via the BAs. At its core, the system comprises two fundamental units: the dCas9-sgRNA complex as the targeting unit and HP1α as the functional unit. By custom-designing for specific genomic loci, the system allows for straightforward substitution of sgRNA, thereby achieving precise labeling for different gene loci. Further characterization of target gene transcription, often carried out through quantitative PCR (qPCR), unveils the transcriptional status of the labeled gene within its genomic context.\nFor the simultaneous labeling of multiple genomic loci, the SIMBA system offers strategies such as parallel labeling at multiple sites by mixing sgRNA that targets different loci. Moreover, the system is useful to directly manipulate transcription at specific sites, leveraging downstream genes affected by transcription factors, which facilitates comprehensive analysis of transcription factor impact on gene regulation across the entire genome, offering profound insights into the intricacies of gene regulatory networks.\nAnother key feature of the system is the capability to replace HP1α with other IDR sequences, thereby achieving phase separation effects without necessitating chromatin condensation. This could enhance our understanding of gene distribution and interactions within three-dimensional chromatin space. Therefore, the SIMBA system stands as a versatile tool empowering researchers in gene tracing and manipulation studies.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-prot-0002])\nPlasmids:\n               \nAll-in-one construct of dCas9-8×SunTag-P2A-scFv-FRB-T2A-FKBP-mCherry-HP1α\nTarget sgRNA expressing vector\nNFAT1-8×SunTag-P2A-scFv-FRB-T2A-FKBP-mCherry-HP1α\nRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74104)\nSuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, 18090050)\nSYBR Green Mix (Bio-Rad, 1725125)\n24-well plates\nAdditional reagents and equipment for qPCR and RNA-seq\nPart 1: Gene manipulation at specific loci on chromosome",
    "1. Seed HEK 293T cells with good viability in 12-well plates at 0.2 × 106 cells in 1 ml medium per well. Incubate until about 70% to 80% confluent and then exchange medium with fresh medium for transfection preparation.\nFor chromatin manipulation at specific gene loci, appropriate targeting sgRNA–expressing vector must be prepared along with essential elements for SIMBA system.\n2. Transfect cells with 100 ng dCas9-8×SunTag-P2A-scFv-FKBP-T2A-FRB-mCherry-HP1α and 250 ng corresponding sgRNAs with Lipofectamine 3000 reagent following the manufacturer's protocol.\nA group transfected with the same dCas9 construct without HP1α can serve as the negative control.\n3. Incubate the cells in humidified cell culture incubator at 37°C supplemented with 5% CO2 for 36 to 48 hr.\n4. Collect the cell sample, sort out mCherry-positive cells by FACS, and re-seed them in 500 μl culture medium in 24-well plates.\n5. Incubate the mCherry-positive cells to optical confluence and then treat with 100 nM rapamycin to induce BA formation.\n6. Six hours after rapamycin induction, extract total RNA from cell sample using RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer's protocol.\n7. Once fresh total RNA sample is acquired, perform reverse transcription PCR using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase following the manufacturer's protocol.\n8. Design and obtain qPCR primers for the gene targets based on previous publications or database. Perform qPCR on cDNA samples using SYBR Green Mix. Use beta-actin (ACTB) as an internal control for qPCR analysis.",
    "Tips for qPCR primer design: (a) Length: The length of primers is generally between 18 and 30 nt, and the length of amplification products is controlled between 100 and 300 bp. (b) Cross-intron design: Design to avoid unspecific amplification of genomic DNA. (c) GC content and Tm value: The GC content of primers is better between 40% and 60%, and primers’ GC content should be close to obtain similar Tm values and annealing temperatures. The Tm value should be generally ∼60°C for both primers.\nSample preparation is critical for a successful qPCR reaction. Preparation of a master mix is recommended, followed by splitting into at least three parallel samples for a single reaction, which is good for statistical correction.\n9. Analyze qPCR results and evaluate the manipulation efficiency of SIMBA system.\nThe 2–∆∆Ct method is recommended for qPCR analysis. Correct the Ct value of the target gene of each group to that of a housekeeper gene (ACTB, for example). Then, correct the values of the experimental groups to those of controls and calculate the fold change in target gene expression. A biological repeat of at least three is required.\nPart 2: Gene manipulation by using NFAT1 transcription factor as targeting unit for puncta formation\n10. Transfect cells with 100 ng all-in-one construct of NFAT1-8×SunTag-P2A-scFv-FKBP-T2A-FRB-mCherry-HP1α or NFAT1-8×SunTag-P2A-scFv-FKBP-T2A-FRB-mCherry with Lipofectamine 3000 reagent following the manufacturer's protocol.\n11. Incubate the cells in humidified culture incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 36 to 48 hr.\n12. Collect the cell sample and sort out mCherry-positive cells with FACS sorter.\n13. Re-seed the sorted cells into a 24-well plate with 500 μl growth medium.\n14. Incubate the mCherry-positive cells to optimal confluency and treat cells with 100 nM (final concentration) rapamycin to induce BA formation.",
    "To prepare the rapamycin medium for induction, dilute the rapamycin stock in complete medium to the final concentration of 100 nM.\n15. Harvest the cells at 6 hr after rapamycin induction. Extract total RNA from cell sample using RNeasy Mini Kit by following the manufacturer's protocol.\n16. Send collected RNA samples for RNA-seq (including library preparation and next-generation sequencing).\n17. Analyze RNA-seq data for gene expression level change resulting from SIMBA puncta formation (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.947#cpz1947-fig-0003]).\nBriefly, sequencing adapters and low-quality cycles are removed from raw data by Ktrim software. PCR duplicates are then removed, and the remaining reads are aligned to the human genome by STAR software. FeatureCounts software can be used for expression quantification against ENSEMBL gene annotation v101. DESeq2 software used to be used for differential expression analysis. Volcano plot and GO analyses are performed with differentially expressed genes.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e1142fcc-e549-4d68-b5a3-057d3cd4f448/cpz1947-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nFlowchart of the design and timeline for the NFAT1-associated transcriptomic RNA-seq experiment. NFAT1 could be recruited to corresponding binding sites on genomic DNA after ATP induction. Further rapamycin treatment initiates the dimerization of FKBP-FRB, which leads to BA assembly for fluorescent granule formation and HP1α-induced chromatin remodeling. That specific manipulation at NFAT1-regulated downstream genes could be examined by the RNA-seq method."
