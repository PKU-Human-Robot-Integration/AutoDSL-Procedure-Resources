    "1. Switching on the laser system\nSwitch on the interlock system and select arm laser before starting the system.\nTurn on the PC with the software to control the dual-output femtosecond laser.\nLoad the software for the dual-output femtosecond laser; this software enables the laser to be powered on and off and directly controls the wavelength of the pump beam.\nSwitch on the laser emission by holding down on the Power icon for a count of 3.\nWait until the laser has warmed up and the laser-ready light is lit green in the software.\nThe wavelength of the pump beam is directly controlled through the software; this can range from 680-1,300 nm. For cellular imaging in the C-H Raman vibrational region, select 802 nm.\nOpen the shutters of the tunable pump beam and 1,045 nm Stokes beam by holding down on the aperture images for 3 s.\n\tCAUTION: Laser safety guidance the dual-output femtosecond laser is a class IV infra-red pulsed laser and can cause permanent damage to eyesight. Therefore, all laser safety local rules must be followed while carrying out this procedure: (i) Only authorized users who have received laser safety training can carry out the procedure. (ii) Entry to the lab is via swipe card access with an interlock on the room door. (iii) For most of the operation, the laser beams are fully enclosed. (iv) When the laser beam is exposed, laser safety goggles must be worn (use the LG9 laser safety goggles, which give OD 7+ blocking of both the pump and Stokes beams).\n2. Switching on the Spectral Focusing Timing and Recombination Unit (SF-TRU)\nLoad the ATM software on the same PC with the laser software, which controls the delay stages and laser attenuators in the SF-TRU unit.",
    "NOTE: This unit is responsible for making sure the pump and Stokes beams are spatially overlapped, controlling the dispersion in the pump and Stokes beams, and controlling the time delay between the pump and Stokes beams.The polarization of both pump and Stokes beams is vertical. Note that each beam is equipped with a half-wave plate to independently control polarizations before exiting the SF-TRU.\nEnsure that both the pump and Stokes lasers are attenuated to <10% (pump) and <15% (Stokes beams). If beams are not attenuated, the laser power can cause damage to the system and will burn biological samples.\nFor cellular imaging, set the optimal laser settings to 6% (pump) and 10% (Stokes), corresponding to 12 mW and 30 mW at the sample.\nThe SF-TRU has two settings: femtosecond (fs) mode and picosecond (ps) mode.\nFor fs mode, push in the knobs on either side of the box (this removes the dispersion gratings from the beam path).\nFor ps mode, pull out the knobs on either side of the box (this places the dispersion gratings in the beam path).\nFor hyperspectral imaging, select the ps mode.\nEnsure that the delay stage is in the correct position for the pump and Stokes beams to be temporally overlapped for C-H imaging on this system.\nEnsure that the dispersion settings of the pump and Stokes beam are correct; for an 802 nm pump, this is 5 mm for the pump beam and 30 mm for the Stokes beam.\n3. Modulating the Stokes beam for SRS imaging\nFor SRS detection, modulate the intensity of the Stokes beam.\nSwitch on the signal generator for the beam modulation.\nRecall previous settings, which are as follows:\n\tOUTPUT 1: Square wave: Frequency = 19.5 MHz, Amplitude = 1.4 V.",
    "OUTPUT 2: Square wave: Frequency = 19.5 MHz, Amplitude = 300 mV.\nSwitch on Outputs 1 and 2.\nConnect Output 1 to an amplifier for the EOM in the SF-TRU box via a BNC cable.\nConnect Output 2 to the lock-in amplifier used for SRS detection via a BNC cable.\nSwitch on the power supply to the amplifier on the gantry.\n4. Switching on the lock-in amplifier\nFor SRS imaging, use the SRS detection module that comprises a large area photodiode and a purpose-built lock-in amplifier.\nSwitch on the power supply to the lock-in amplifier on the gantry.\nLoad the software for the lock-in amplifier “SRS detection Module” on the PC.\nIn the software, chose the following settings: Phase = 0°, Offset = -80 mW, Gain = 58 dB.\nSelect the lock-in amplifier integration time constant in the software: for cell imaging the time constant of 2 µs gives good quality images.\n5. Operating on the laser scanning microscope\nSwitch on plugs of all the equipment except the remote-control box. Wait until standby is lit on the control box located on the top of the gantry.\nSwitch on the remote-control box on the gantry and switch on the back of the box. Wait until the remote light goes blue (on the control box), and press Start Operation.\nTurn on the PC of the laser scanning microscope.\nRun the confocal microscope software.\nCheck the light path of the microscope via the computer software.",
    "NOTE: Some modifications have been made to the microscope to make it suitable for SRS imaging: (i) In the beam path, a 775 nm short pass has been added to the filter wheel where the laser beams enter the scan unit, this can be selected in the Lightpath tab in the computer software. (ii) Instead of using the confocal microscope’s inbuilt PMTs for detection, a bespoke detector has been added to the transmitted light path, which allows both SRS and CARS detection. (iii) The outputs from these detectors are connected to the Analog box on the gantry. CARS signal from the PMT is connected via a BNC cable to CD1 and SRS signal from the lock-in amplifier is connected via a BNC cable to CD2.\nControl the focus through the touch screen or the remote-control knobs or the computer software.\nSelect the desired image settings in the software; this includes zoom, the image size in pixels and pixel dwell time.\nEnsure that the imaging speed (pixel dwell time) is greater than the integration time set in the lock-in amplifier software.\n\tNOTE: A NA 1.2 water immersion objective was used for imaging.\n6. Mounting a sample in the microscope stage\nPrepare the cell samples for imaging as follows.\n\t\nCulture 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Change the medium every 2 days and passage the cells at 70%–80% confluence.\n\t\tNOTE: Passages 8–10 were used throughout the course of the experiments described here.\nFor imaging experiments, incubate 1 x 105 cells on square coverslips for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Then, wash the cells with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubate with gold nanoparticles (1:100 dilution in cell culture medium, stock concentration: 2.3 x 1010 particles/mL, diameter: 60 nm) for 4 h.",
    "Prior to imaging, wash the cells with ice-cold PBS and fix them with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Wash the cells with PBS 3x, and then mount between two coverslips for imaging.\nPlace a droplet of distilled water on top of the water immersion objective that focuses the laser beams into to the sample between the objective and the sample. Then, place the sample on the microscope stage.\nA condenser with NA 1.4 collects the forward propagated light. Apply a droplet of water between the condenser and the sample for imaging. Adjust the height of the condenser to approximately 1 mm above the sample to collect the maximum amount of light.\nThe SRS detector is on a moveable mount, which allows it to be slide in and out from the collection optical pathway. In order to focus on the sample using white light, move the SRS detector out of the beam path.\nPlace the detector back in the beam path, ready for SRS imaging.\n7. Changing the Raman shift and collecting a hyperspectral data stack\nNOTE: The Raman shift at which the imaging takes place is dependent on the delay stage position in the SF-TRU box and the wavelength of the pump beam from the laser system.\nFor large changes in the Raman shift, change the laser wavelength. For example, for imaging CH vibrations between 2,800–3,100 cm-1, select 802 nm, whereas, for imaging around 1,600 cm-1 for the amide I peak, select the pump beam at 898 nm. Adjust this via the software.\nTo achieve small adjustments in the Raman shift, scan the delay stage in the SF-TRU unit.",
    "The SF-TRU gives delay stage positions in millimeters (mm). To convert the delay stage position from mm to cm-1, perform the calibration hyperspectral scan using a sample of polystyrene beads and compare the peak positions found in the calibration scan with those taken on a spontaneous Raman setup. This will provide a linear equation, which converts the delay stage position in mm to Raman shift in cm-1.\nTo generate a hyperspectral scan, take a time series of images at different delay stage positions.\nTo synchronize Image acquisition and movement of the delay stage, use the analog unit to send and receive TTL signals to and from the SF-TRU system.\n\tNOTE: To do this, the analog box has the following connections: (i) TRIG OUT VD1—this is connected to the SF-TRU via a BNC and sends a TTL signal to tell the delay stage to move +1 increment. (ii) TRIG In 1—here, a signal is received via BNC when the delay stage has finished its movement, and this is used to trigger the next image in the time series.\nFor the hyperspectral data set, select the following settings in the confocal microscope software:\n\t\nIn the Trigger tab, select Start by TTL trigger (ON) and Trigger (every frame).\nIn the Series tab, set the time series ON and the z series OFF.\nSet the number of frames in the time series to match the number of steps in the ATM software (101 steps is used here).\nIn the ATM software, go to the Run tab.\n\t\nSet the delay stage positions in millimeters for the start and stop of the hyperspectral scan. For CH high wavenumber region, use the start position = 90.25 mm and the stop position = 92.25 mm.",
    "Ensure that the number of steps matches the number of frames in the confocal microscope software.\nAfter checking the correct settings, start the hyperspectral stack in the confocal microscope software first. Go to Acquire and click on Start Scan. Then, in the ATM software, click on Start. This initiates the collection of a series of images, with incremental increases in the delay stage position between the selected start and stop positions\nExport the hyperspectral image series as a multi-frame .tif file and use a suitable software package to carry out the calibration.\nOnce the calibration is completed, use the linear calibration equation to convert the delay stage position to the Raman shifts.\nFor switching between imaging in the CH vibrational region (2,800–3,100 cm-1) to the amide I vibrational region 1,500–1,700 cm-1), do the following.\n\t\nChange the pump wavelength in the laser software from 802 nm to 898 nm.\nChange the Stokes dispersion setting in the ATM software from 30 mm to 5 mm.\nMake a small adjustment to the mirror in the pump beam dispersion pathway inside the SF-TRU box. This is done by adjusting the lower knob on the mirror mount, which changes the mirror angle by an incremental amount.\nWhen performing a hyperspectral scan over the amide I region, set the start and stop positions in the ATM software to 89 and 91mm, respectively\n\t\tCAUTION: Laser safety goggles must be worn for this step as the laser beam will be exposed.\nSubscription Required.
