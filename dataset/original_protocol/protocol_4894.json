    "HPLC-UV after thiolysisSample and standard preparationDissolve the dried plant extracts (5 mg) in methanol (5 ml) and sonicate (35 kHz, 250W) at room temperature for 30 min.Transfer with an Eppendorf pipette 200 μl of the solubilized extracts in an Eppendorf tube (2 ml) and mix it with 200 μl of thiolysis media.Put the Eppendorf tube in the water bath set at 65 °C for 1 h to carry on the thiolysis. No shaking of the sample is needed. During the thiolysis the flavan-3-ol monomeric units of the condensed tannins are released in their native state (terminal units) as well as their respective thioethers (extension units), as schematically depicted in Figure 2.Note: The thiolysis is effective only if condensed tannins are made of catechin and/or gallocatechin units. If tannins are made of fisetinidol, robinetinidol or monomeric units different than flavan-3-ols, the interflavonyl bond will not be cleaved.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012025244_5706.jpgFigure 2.  Scheme of the condensed tannin thiolysis with cysteamine hydrochloride. R1, R2 = H or OH.The thiolysis is quenched with 1 ml of water and the solution is purified through a PTFE 0.45 μm HPLC filter.Non-thiolyzed reference samples are prepared by dissolving 200 μl of the solubilized extracts in sequence with 200 μl of methanol and 1.0 ml of water, followed by the same thermal treatment as used during the thiolysis (1 h at 65 °C) and purified through a PTFE 0.45 µm HPLC filter.Prepare calibration stock solutions of the flavan-3-ols (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50 g/L in methanol). The calibration standards solutions for HPLC are then prepared by diluting 200 μl of the calibration stock solutions in sequence with 200 μl of methanol and 1.0 ml of water. The calibration standard solutions are then thermally treated (1 h at 65 °C in a water bath) and purified (PTFE 0.",
    "45 µm HPLC-filter) in the same way as the samples.All samples and calibration standards are sealed in an HPLC vial and stored in a refrigerator between 3 and 8 °C until analysis. The samples remain stable for about 1 week under these conditions.MeasurementCondition the reversed-phase HPLC-UV system equipped with the Cosmosil column using solution A (see Recipes) at 30 °C.Inject 25 μl of the sample (e.g., thiolyzed extract, non-thiolyzed extract, calibration standard) in the HPLC column. Before injection the samples should be conditioned at room temperature for at least 1 h. However, it is recommended to limit the exposition of the sample at room temperature to less than 24 h before the HPLC measurement.The mobile phase gradient described in Table 1 was applied at a flow equal to 1 ml/min. Compositions of solution A and solution B are described in the section Recipes. The temperature of the column is kept at 30 °C all over the measurement.Table 1. Mobile phase gradient applied during HPLC measurementsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012032307_6834.jpgNotes: The quasi-isocratic conditions between 5 and 20 min are needed to achieve a sufficient resolution (separation) of the peaks corresponding to epigallocatechin, catechin and their thioethers.The HPLC measurements should be repeated at least twice on replicated samples, therefore taking into account independent sample preparation, thiolysis, and analysis.Detect the absorbance at 280 nm. An example of the HPLC chromatograms at 280 nm of bark extracts before and after thiolysis is reported in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012025715_5430.jpgFigure 3. HPLC-UV chromatograms between 10 and 35 min of Silver fir (Abies alba [Mill.]) bark extracts before and after thiolysis. Absorption peaks are associated to various flavanol and flavanol thioethers as follows: 1 = gallocatechin; 2 = gallocatechin thioether; 3 = epigallocatechin; 4 = catechin; 5 = catechin thioether; 6 = epigallocatechin thioether; 7 = epicatechin; 8 = epicatechin thioether.",
    "Integrate the area under the absorption peak(s) that corresponds to the flavan-3-ols and their thioethers.Notes:While analytical standards of native flavan-3-ols are commercially available from chemical substance distributors (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich), no standards are available for flavan-3-ol thioethers. The preparation of flavan-3-ol thioethers standards could be performed only starting from oligomers of known composition (also not easily available) and requires lengthy purification steps (Torres and Bobet, 2001). In the present study the retention times of the flavan-3-ol thioethers were identified by extemporary HPLC-MS measurements performed in an external laboratory using the same column and method and Agilent 1290 Infinity HPLC system equipped with a mass detector (Agilent 6130 quadrupole MS).Quantify the concentration of the flavan-3-ols in the thiolyzed and non-thiolyzed samples by comparison with the calibration curves developed for each single flavan-3-ol measuring the corresponding calibration standards. As already mentioned, no calibration standard are commercially available for the flavan-3-ol thioethers. Extemporary measurements performed on epicatechin dimers (proanthocyanidin B2) showed that, after complete thiolysis (complete disappearing of the peak corresponding to the epicatechin dimer) the peaks corresponding to epicatechin and epicatechin-thioether had almost an equal absorption area. The concentration of all flavan-3-ol thioethers was then calculated using for the flavanol thioethers the same UV molar absorption (MABS) of the corresponding native flavan-3-ols (e.g., MABS of epicatechin thioether was considered equal to MABS of epicatechin). In Table 2 the MABS for the measured flavan-3-ols are reported. Table 2. Molar absorption factor (MABS) of flavan-3-ols and flavan-3-ol thioethersimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161012/20161012032431_6895.jpgMALDI-TOF mass spectrometrySample preparationDissolve the dried plant extracts (2.5 mg) in 1 ml of aqueous acetone (50%) and sonicate (35 kHz, 250 W) at room temperature for 30 min.Prepare a matrix solution by dissolving 10 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1 ml of pure acetone.",
    "In Eppendorf tube (1 ml) mix 10 µl of the extract solution with 10 µl of matrix solution and spike it with 1 µl of KCl (10 g/L in water) to enhance the formation of potassiated ions and suppress the formation of sodiated and/or other types of ions.Note: Plant tissues might contain different kinds of salts, which may consequently contribute to the ion formation during the MALDI ionization process. For correct spectra interpretation it is therefore essentially important to ensure the formation of only one type of ions (e.g., either sodiated or potassiated, or others). Of particular concern are already mentioned sodium and potassium ions, because these two salts are common constituents in plant tissues. The mass difference between Na+ and K+ is 16 amu, which is also a mass difference between the building units of the condensed tannins (Table 4). Thus, unintended formation of Na+ and K+ ions at the same time may result in errors in spectra interpretation.Deposit 5 µl of the mixture on the MALDI-TOF stainless steel plate and allow it to dry at room temperature for about 1 h.The samples should be stored at room temperature and measured at the same day of the preparation.MeasurementSet the MALDI TOF mass spectrometer in positive linear mode with a monitoring range between 700 and 4,500 m/z.Calibrate the MALDI TOF mass spectrometer with the calibration standard (e.g., Peptide calibration standard II, Bruker Daltonics, Germany)Perform the measurement on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer collecting about 700 laser shots for each sample."
