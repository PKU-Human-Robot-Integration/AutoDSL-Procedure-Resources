    "1. Preparation of reagents and cells for buffer exchange\nPrepare buffers (see Table of Materials) in a class 2 laminar flow hood. Using a syringe and needle assembly, remove 50 mL of saline solution from a 500 mL saline bag. Replace this with 50 mL of 20% human serum albumin (HSA) to make 2% HSA in saline, which will serve as the wash buffer.\nRemove the cells from the culture vessels and perform a cell count to determine the starting cell quantity and viability by trypan blue exclusion. Load the cells into a transfer bag.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI and MSCs were cultured in DMEM:F12. Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For MSCs or adherent cells, add a digestion enzyme (e.g., trypsin) into the culture vessels in order to detach the cells, and quench with culture media once the cells are detached. A transfer bag was used in this protocol because the cells were expanded in culture vessels. However, if the cells are cultured in a cell culture bag, it can be directly connected to the single-use kit via sterile tube welding. In this protocol, either 3 x 107 Jurkat cells or 1 x 107 MSCs were used for each run, where cells were suspended in 40 mL of culture media.\n\t\nLoad cells into a transfer bag (see Table of Materials) using a syringe and needle assembly if a sterile tube welder is available to connect the transfer bag to the single use processing kit.",
    "Alternatively, use a pair of autoclaved scissors to cut the connecting tube with around 10 cm remainining attached to the transfer bag and add a female Luer connector to the end of the tubing. Use a syringe to aspirate cells and media, then connect the syringe to the Luer connector and load cells to the transfer bag.\nConnect the bag containing the cells, wash buffer bag containing 500 mL of wash buffer prepared in step 1.1, waste bag, and collecting syringe to the single-use kit (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: The connecting position of each bag depends on the settings in the program. In this protocol, we connected the waste bag at position A, wash buffer at position B, cell bag at positions D and F, and collection syringe at position H (Figure 1C).\n2. Program for automated buffer exchange protocol\nOpen the Graphic User Interface (GUI) of the device and press the \"START\" button on a laptop PC or tablet. Then \"Open\" an existing protocol or press \"New\" to create a new one.\nUse the \"Forward\" and \"Backward\" button to navigate through each step, select the valves to be opened/closed, centrifugal speed, pump speed, pump direction, and action triggers. The settings for each step are summarized in Table 1. Then save the protocol.\n3. Setting up the machine\nPlace the single-use processing kit on the machine and hang the connected bags accordingly. Press the red \"Stop/Reset\" button to reset all valves into the default closed position.\n\tNOTE: The machine will perform a test when the door is closed to ensure the kit has been placed correctly and that all the valves are functioning appropriately.",
    "Connect the GUI to the processing device and press the \"Connect\" button. Then download the saved program. When the green \"Play\" button lights up, it indicates that the protocol is ready to start.\nOpen the manual clamps for the transfer bag tubing.\n\tNOTE: If the operator forgets to open the clamps, the device will stop and the pressure sensor warning will appear. Press the \"Stop\" button to reset the device and open the clamps to start again.\n4. Automated buffer exchange\nPress \"Start\" to initiate the buffer exchange program.\n\tNOTE: To manually alter the automated process, press the \"Next\" button to move to the next step before reaching the \"Trigger\" or press \"Pause\" to put the process on hold. This will recirculate the cells through the kit while keeping only valves J and K open (Figure 1C).\nAt the end of automation step 6 (Table 1), the process will pause when air in the now emptied bag triggers the bubble sensor. Press \"Next\" to move the process to the next step if the bag is indeed empty, or press \"Pause\" to resume the processing if the sensor was triggered by a bubble in the line.\n5. Collecting and sampling the cells\nWhen the automated process is finished, close all tubing clamps. Open the door and take the single-use kit out of the device. Disconnect the syringe to collect the cells for subsequent processes. Take a sample of the collected cells for a cell count and viability check (see step 6.2).\n6. Process validation\nPerform control experiments using a manual buffer exchange protocol.",
    "Centrifuge cell suspension at 200 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 30 mL of cell wash buffer. Centrifuge the cell suspension again at 200 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 10 mL of cell wash buffer.\nPerform cell counting via the trypan blue exclusion assay to assess cell viability using an automated cell counter.\nPerform an MTS assay to quantify cell proliferation at 2, 24, and 48 h.\n\tNOTE: The MTS assay was performed on a 96 well tissue culture plate according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 100 µL aliquot of cell culture media (containing 10,000 Jurkat cells or 1,500) per well were plated after the buffer exchange process. At each time point, 20 µL of MTS reagents were added into each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was assessed at 490 nm using a plate reader.\nPerform functional assays to compare the impact of the automated process versus the manual process on the Jurkat cells and MSC function.\n\t\nCulture Jurkat cells in a 96-well plate at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL stimulated with 50 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1 µg/mL ionomycin (cell stimulation cocktail) in DMEM:F12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 h. Incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nMeasure interleukin-2 production from culture supernatant using bead-based ELISA assay (see Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCulture MSCs in a 12 well plate at the density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in 1 mL of DMEM:F12 media containing 10% FBS supplemented with interferon-γ 50 units/mL for 48 h. Collect supernatant for the kynurenine concentration assay to measure indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme activity of MSCs as previously described21.",
