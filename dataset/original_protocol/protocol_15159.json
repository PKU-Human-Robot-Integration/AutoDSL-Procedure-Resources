    "All procedures described in this article were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, Germany.\nPre-surgical procedures\n1.\tPreparation of Monofilaments \nFor preparation of intraluminal filaments, 8-0 nylon monofilament sutures were used and were cut to a length of 13 mm each.\n  \nFor coating of the monofilaments, Xantopren M mucosa, (Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany) was used activated by adding a drop of activator solution (Activator, Universal plus, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany). \nThe monofilament was slowly pulled through the silicone until it was completely covered with it. By doing so, the monofilament would be evenly covered with silicone. Avoid waiting too long because the activated coating material will become firm and dry quickly. \nBefore the silicone starts to solidify, it is recommended to strip off excessive silicone from the filament by pulling it over a sheet of paper. By doing so, the silicone layer can be thinned out to an approximate thickness of 200 μm.\n  \nThe base of the silicone-covered monofilament was stuck into modeling clay in order to let it dry overnight.  \nComment: Ideally, only sterilized or at least disinfected monofilaments should be used to ensure sterility at the surgical site. In practice, sterilization or disinfection of the hand-made monofilaments is very difficult because the quality of the monofilaments may worsen 9. Therefore, it might be preferable to use commercially available sterile monofilaments instead. \n2.\tPreparation of Surgical Instruments and of the Animals\nAll surgical instruments were kept in 70% ethyl alcohol. Additionally, prior to each new surgical procedure, all surgical instruments were carefully cleaned and disinfected using 70% ethyl alcohol.",
    "The surgical area was thoroughly disinfected using 70% ethyl alcohol in all animals before transection. The disinfected sites were allowed to completely dry before performing the incisions. Additional clipping of the fur was not performed as this may cause microabrasions and subsequent skin inflammation 9. \nSurgical procedures\n3.\tPositioning of the LDF Probe and LDF Monitoring\nFor induction of anesthesia, mice were exposed to a gaseous mixture consisting of 30% oxygen, 70% N2O and 2.5% isoflurane using a vaporizer. For maintenance of anesthesia, isoflurane concentration was reduced to 1.5%. Mice were breathing spontaneously via breathing mask throughout the surgical procedure.    \nA rectal temperature probe was inserted and mice were fixed to the stereotactic frame exposing the parietal head. During surgery, mice were resting on a thermostat-controlled heating pad, ensuring a constant core temperature of 37.0 ± 0.5 °C.  A sagittal midline incision (~1 cm length) was performed to expose the parietal skull.   \nThe left side of the skull was carefully dissected and a fiberoptic probe was fixed directly to the skull 2 mm caudal and 5 mm lateral from bregma using instant glue. Afterwards, wound edges were carefully adapted to avoid brain hypothermia as well as infections.  \nThe mouse was turned around to expose the ventral side of the neck. The fiberoptic probe was connected to the LDF device (PeriFLUX System 5000, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) via connecting probe adaptor (Master Probe 418-1, Perimed; Järfälla, Sweden).  \n Comment: While turning the mouse around, the fiberoptic probe should be bent with care in order to avoid that it breaks off from the skull.\nThe LDF device was connected to a laptop computer. Continuous recording of LDF values was initiated using PeriSoft for Windows (Version 2.50, Järfälla, Sweden). Figure 1 demonstrates the mean CBF course obtained from ten LDF recordings during BCCAO and reperfusion.",
    "4.\tBilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion\nAnesthesia was maintained as described in 3.1. Mouse was placed on its back. The animal's tail and paws were fixed to the heating pad using adhesive tape. A sagittal ventral midline incision (~ 1cm length) was performed.  \nBoth salivatory glands were carefully separated and mobilized to visualize the underlying CCA's.\nBoth CCA's were carefully separated from the respective vagal nerves and accompanying veins without harming these structures. Manipulations of the vagal nerves might lead to transient or permanent dysfunction of the parasympathetic nerve system, which has the potential for the occurrence of significant cardiac arrhythmia or even irreversible cardiac arrest. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid any manipulations of the vagal nerves. A loose 5-0 silk suture loop was made around each CCA. \n  \nA small silicon tubing (diameter 2 mm) was inserted in between the CCA and the silk sutures on each side. This tubing was used as a splinting of the CCA's in order to avoid damaging of the arterial walls when the sutures were tightened (Figure 4). \n  \nBoth CCA's were occluded for one minute by tightening the silk sutures. Only mice, in which the LDF signal was reduced to <10% of the baseline signal were included in the study. After reopening of both CCA's, a five minutes reperfusion period was initiated. By LDF a complete reperfusion was ensured. Animals with incomplete reperfusion (i.e. <90 % recovery of CBF compared to baseline CBF) were excluded. The sequence of one minute of BCCAO and five minutes of reperfusion was repeated twice for a total BCCAO duration of 3 min. Figure 1 shows the mean CBF course obtained from ten LDF recordings during BCCAO and reperfusion. During the procedure, it is recommended to keep the neck wound wet using normal saline.",
    "After the last reperfusion, all tubing and sutures as well as the fiberoptic probe attached to the skull were removed, the wounds were sutured and lidocaine ointment (Xylocain 2%; AstraZeneca GmbH, Wedel, Germany) was repeatedly applied to the wounds as needed for analgetic management.\n  \nMice were transferred to a pre-heated (30 °C) recovery box (MediHEAT. PecoServives Ltd. Brough, Cumbria, UK) until they had regained complete consciousness. Thereafter, mice were returned to their animal cages. \n5.\tMiddle Cerebral Artery Occlusion \nMice were re-anesthetized, a rectal temperature probe was inserted and mice were positioned on a heating pad to expose the ventral side of the neck. Afterwards, they were fixed as described in the BCCAO section.    \nA permanent ligature using a long 7-0 silk suture was made around the left proximal CCA and the thread was gently pulled caudally using a mosquito clamp (Figure 4).    \nAnother permanent ligature was made around the left external carotid artery (ECA) and the thread was pulled towards the right side of the animal (Figure 4).    \nConnective tissue surrounding the left ICA was carefully mobilized and the hypoglossal nerve was gently lifted to get a good overview of the distal course of ICA. The left ICA bends to the left while the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) follows the course of the proximal ICA to the right (Figure 4). \nComment: There is another artery to be identified which turns to the right in caudal direction. This is the occipital artery, which variably originates either from the CCA bifurcation or from the proximal part of the ECA (Figure 4).   \nA loose suture loop was made around the proximal ICA using a 5-0 silk thread. \nUsing a small microvascular clamp, the ICA was temporarily occluded distally to the 5-0 loose suture loop (Figure 4).",
    "A small incision was made in the distal part of CCA just before the CCA bifurcation using microvascular scissors (Figure 4).    \nA preselected silicone-covered monofilament was introduced into the CCA via the small incision and pushed into the ICA until it stopped at the microvascular clamp (Figure 4).    \nThe microclamp was carefully removed from the ICA, while the monofilament was advanced deeper into the ICA until it stopped (Figure 4).\n    Comment: At this point, flip the forceps in the left hand so that you do not hold it like a pen. This helps to grab the filament with the forceps more easily. The vascular clamp-applicator should be held in the right hand. It might be necessary to nearly tighten the loose 5-0 suture around the ICA in order to prevent bleeding from the incision side.\nThe exact location of the monofilament tip was identified to check if it was advanced into the ICA and not into the PPA. If the monofilament tip was introduced into the proximal PPA, the filament was gently pulled back just before the ICA/PPA bifurcation. It was attempted to advance the monofilament into the ICA again, while gently pulling the proximal ICA a bit to the right side. By doing so, the natural course of the distal ICA was simulated making it easier to access the ICA. \nAfter the monofilament was advanced into the ICA almost completely, the loose 5-0 suture loop around the proximal ICA was tightened in order to hold the filament in place. Afterwards, all silk threads were shortened and the skin wound was sutured. \nThe fluid loss during surgery was replenished by injecting 1.0 ml of normal saline solution i.p. Afterwards, the mouse was transferred to the pre-heated recovery box until it regained complete consciousness.",
    "For reperfusion, mice were re-anaesthetized and the monofilament was removed after carefully loosening the 5-0 silk suture around the proximal ICA. Afterwards, the 5-0 suture was tightened again carefully in order to prevent bleeding. \nAfter confirmation of complete hemostasis, the neck wound was sutured. \nLidocaine ointment was repeatedly applied locally to the skin as needed for pain relief and the mouse was transferred to the pre-heated (30 °C) recovery box until it regained complete consciousness.  \nAs a first hint for a successful MCAO procedure, a clockwise circling of the animal was observed. The severity of the functional deficit was quantified using the Bederson score modified for mice 10. According to this modified Bederson score, neurological scores were graded as follows: 0 (normal motor function), 1 (flexion of torso and contralateral forelimb when mouse was lifted by the tail), 2 (circling to the contralateral side when mouse was held by the tail on a flat surface, but normal posture at rest), 3 (leaning to the contralateral side at rest), and 4 (no spontaneous motor activity or dead). \n6.\tBCCAO Sham Surgery",
    "For BCCAO sham procedures, mice were anaesthetized for the duration of a real BCCAO PC procedure, the salivation glands were mobilized and the CCA's were exposed. It is crucial that direct manipulations to the carotid arteries or vagal nerves are avoided during sham procedure. Manipulations of the CCA can damage its endothelial layer, which can result in a release of vasoactive compounds from endothelium or induce local thrombosis within the arterial lumen. As a consequence, thromboembolic events might occur after sham surgery. This would be a major confounder of the procedure. On the other hand, manipulations of the vagal nerves might lead to transient or permanent dysfunction of the parasympathetic nerve system, which has the potential for the occurrence of significant cardiac arrhythmia or even irreversible cardiac arrest. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid any manipulations of the vagal nerves during BCCAO.\nPost-surgical procedures\n7.\tInfarct Volume Measurements \nFor assessment of infarct sizes, mice survived for 72 hr after MCAO. Afterwards animals were deeply anesthetized, brains were removed, snap-frozen in methylbutan, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin (using Papanicolau's protocol) for infarct volume measurements. Brain sections were collected at 600 μm-intervals and infarct volumes were determined using an image analyzer (MCID core 7.0 Rev.2.0, GE Healthcare Niagara Inc) and corrected for edema according to the method of Lin et al. 7,11.\n8.\tInclusion Criteria",
    "We included only animals which had a LDF-measured CBF reduction by more than 90% during each of the three BCCAO episodes. Ideally, LDF monitoring should be performed in both cerebral hemispheres during BCCAO. For practicability, we performed LDF monitoring only in the left hemispheres, which will be subjected to MCAO later on. This approach has been described before 6,12. Reperfusion after each BCCAO episode was required to be complete (i.e. return to baseline values). For reasons of reducing  time duration mice were kept under anesthesia, we did not monitor CBF during MCAO surgery. In a pilot study with a separate group of animals however, we monitored CBF by LDF during MCAO surgery. In this group of mice, we consistently measured a reduction in CBF by 90% compared to baseline before CCA occlusion. Additionally, after removal of monofilaments CBF recovered to >90% of the respective baseline values after CCA occlusion. These LDF criteria are established in the literature and result in consistent infarct volumes 7. We only included animals which had a Bederson score of at least of 1 after recovery from anesthesia after MCAO. Furthermore, only animals which survived for 72 hr after MCAO and which showed no signs of intracranial hemorrhage were included in the study.Subscription Required.
