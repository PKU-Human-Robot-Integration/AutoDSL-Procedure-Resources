    "mRNA productionProduce mRNAs using T7 RNA polymerase on a linearized plasmid encoding eGFP.Transcribe mRNAs to contain 101 nucleotide-long poly(A) tails. Use one-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ)-5’-triphosphate instead of UTP to generate modified nucleoside-containing mRNA.Cap RNAs using the m7G capping kit with 2’-O-methyltransferase to obtain cap1.Purify mRNA by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC).Analyze all mRNAs by agarose gel electrophoresis and store frozen at -20°C.Note: All nucleoside-modified mRNAs are available from the company RNAx created by Dr. Katalin Kariko and Dr. Drew Weissman. The sequence of nucleoside-modified mRNA is listed in Materials and Reagents. LNP encapsulation of the mRNAEncapsulate FPLC-purified m1Ψ-containing mRNAs in LNP using a self-assembly process in which an aqueous solution of mRNA at pH = 4.0 is rapidly mixed with a solution of lipids dissolved in ethanol.Note: LNPs used in this study contain an ionizable cationic lipid (pKa in the range of 6.0-6.5, proprietary to Acuitas Therapeutics)/phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/PEG-lipid. The proprietary lipid and LNP composition are described in US patent US10,221,127 entitled “Lipids and lipid nanoparticle formulations for delivery of nucleic acids” (https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/183-348-727-217-109[href=https://www.lens.org/lens/patent/183-348-727-217-109]). They had a diameter of ~80 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK) instrument. Acuitas is willing to work with academic investigators who would like to test the LNP used in this work. In vivo administration of mRNA-LNPThaw mRNA-LNP on ice immediately before use.Dilute mRNA-LNP fresh on ice in sterile Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) prior to each experiment.Note: Dilute mRNA-LNP to a working concentration so that no more than 50 μl will be injected into each mouse. Make extra to account for the volume lost in the syringe tip. We used 5-10 μg of mRNA-LNP in each ~20 g body weight mouse. Anesthetize mice using an isoflurane chamber (Figure 1).",
    "Remove mice from the anesthesia chamber and quickly inject mRNA-LNP into the retro-orbital sinus using 1/2cc insulin syringes.Note: Tail vein injection is also an efficient method of intravenous delivery for this application. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4184/bioprotoc-11-19-4184-g001.jpgFigure 1. Isoflurane setup used to anesthetize mice Tissue fixation, cryopreservation, sectioning, and immunofluorescence on sections (Data in Figure 3A)Collect intact liver and other organs including spleen, intestine, and lung directly in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in 1× PBS.Note: Expression of protein from mRNA-LNP can be seen between 5 h and 7 days after mRNA-LNP injection. Tissue can therefore be collected at any point in that time frame depending on the stability of the protein produced and the time of the readout desired. mRNA-LNPs are equally well-expressed in male and female liver cells. Fix for at least 2 h at room temperature.Note: Overnight at 4°C preferred. For cryopreservation, wash tissues three times with 1× PBS and dip in 15% sucrose solution for 15 min.Transfer tissues to 30% sucrose solution and keep until they sink to the bottom.Note: If tissues are very fatty, they may not sink; waiting overnight is sufficient in these cases. Embed the tissues in O.C.T. compound. The blocks can be stored at -80°C until further required.Cut 5 μm liver sections with cryostat and store the slides at -20°C until required for immunostaining.Defrost the frozen slides at room temperature for 30 min and dry.Dip the slides in 1× PBS for 10 min.Permeabilize the tissues using 0.3% Triton-X in 1× PBS for 10 min.Rinse the slides three times in 1× PBS, 10 min each.Block the tissue with 3% normal donkey serum diluted in 1× PBS for 30 min.Incubate the sections overnight at 4°C with chicken anti-mouse GFP antibody diluted in 1× PBS at 1:300 concentration as indicated in Table 1.",
    "Other markers can be used to identify specific cell types transfected, such as those outlined in Figure 3A.Wash the slides three times with 1× PBS, 10 min each.Incubate with fluorescently labeled anti-chicken secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature protected from light at a concentration of 1:500 diluted in 1× PBS.Wash the slides three times with 1× PBS for 10 min each.Incubate with DAPI (1:3,000 in 1× PBS) for 3-5 min protected from light.Rinse the slides two times with 1× PBS for 5 min each.Mount using FluorSave reagent.Image the slides using a fluorescent microscope.Liver perfusionWarm all solutions to 40°C in water bath.Note: Solutions 1 and 2 are kept at 4°C. Solution 3 is thawed fresh prior to use. To make sure the whole surgery is at 37°C, set the water bath to 40°C. Maintain the temperature of the solutions while the perfusion is being done. Sterilize pump tubing with 70% ethanol, then wash with Solution 1.Attach I.V. administration set to catheter at one end and to pump tubing at the other end and fill with Solution 1.Note: Fill with solution once the animal is prepared to be dissected to avoid a temperature drop in solution. Anesthetize the mouse using Ketamine/Xylazine Anesthetic Solution at 100 μl/20 g body weight of mice, and place mice on heating pads to maintain their body temperature.Note: The anesthetic solution is made with a concentration of ketamine:concentration of xylazine ratio; see recipe below. Check the responsiveness of the mouse by pinching its foot. Immobilize all four limbs of the mouse with tape once under deep anesthesia on a moisture-absorbing surface. Open the abdomen and the chest area and push intestines to the side with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator, thereby exposing the vessels.",
    "Locate the inferior vena cava (IVC) in the chest area and portal vein under the liver (Figure 2).Note: The IVC is a large blood vessel carrying blood from the lower extremities to the right atrium of the heart and is easily distinguished in the chest cavity extending between the diaphragm and heart. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4184/bioprotoc-11-19-4184-g002.jpgFigure 2. Identification (A) and cannulation (B) of IVC and cutting of portal vein (C) As shown in Figure 2, carefully cannulate the IVC using the catheter and start the flow of the pump at 4 ml/min (pump setting 6.5-6.8). The liver will fill up with the solution turning brown within a few seconds. Quickly locate and cut the portal vein. Tape down the catheter and tubing securely.After about 30 ml of Solution 1, run approximately 10 ml of Solution 2, and finally run Solution 3 for 10-15 min.Note: To gauge the progress of liver digestion, poke the liver with a cotton-tipped applicator after 10 min of perfusion with Solution 3. Under-digested liver will remain elastic, whereas a completely digested liver will retain an indentation. When the liver is digested, remove the catheter, excise the gallbladder, and then carefully remove the liver without disrupting the liver capsule if possible.Transfer the liver to a 60 mm Petri dish containing 10 ml of Solution 3. Disrupt the liver capsule with forceps and wash out the hepatocytes by swirling the dish. Collect hepatocytes and filter through a 100 µm filter unit into a sterile 50 ml conical tube that contains 10 ml of cold Wash Medium (see Recipes below).For studies of non-parenchymal cells (NPC), collect the tissue retained on the filter and digested further as directed in Step E12.Pellet hepatocytes by centrifuging at 50 × g for 2 min at 4°C.",
    "Collect the supernatant and centrifuge it at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspend in cold Wash Medium. This is NPC Fraction 1. Resuspend the hepatocyte pellet in 50 ml cold Wash Medium.Transfer tissue fragments collected in Step E10 to a 60 mm Petri dish. Add 5 ml of NPC Digest Solution (see Recipes below). Add a magnetic stirring bar and stir at 37°C for 10 min. After 10 min, pipette the solution up and down to assist the breakup of remaining tissue fragments.Note: Use a 1 ml pipette and cut the end of the 1 ml pipette tip a little to assist in picking up tissue fragments. Pipette up and down a couple of times to dissociate the tissue and release NPCs into the solution. Collect dissociated cells by passage through a 40 µm strainer. Spin at 300 × g and resuspend the pellet in cold Wash Medium. This is NPC Fraction 2.Transfer remaining tissue from Step E13 to a new dish with 5 ml of 0.05% trypsin, and incubate at 37°C with stirring for 10-15 min. After stirring, pipette the solution up and down to assist the breakup of remaining tissue fragments.Collect newly dissociated cells by passage through a 40 µm strainer. Spin at 300 × g and resuspend in cold Wash Medium. This is NPC Fraction 3.Pool all NPC Fractions collected in Steps E11, E13, and E15, pellet the cells by centrifugation, and resuspend in 5 ml cold Wash Medium. This gives the total NPC fraction.Flow Cytometry (Data in Figure 3B)Centrifuge hepatocytes at 50 × g and NPCs at 300 × g and resuspend in 1-2 ml RBC lysis buffer.Keep in the lysis buffer for 2 min at room temperature, then add 10 ml to 20 ml Wash Medium.",
    "Wash cells by centrifuging hepatocytes at 50 × g and NPCs at 300 × g. Resuspend hepatocytes and NPCs in 1-2 ml PBS depending upon the number of wells/samples required for analysis.Incubate fractions in Zombie NIR dye for 30 min at room temperature. Wash with Wash Media, centrifuge appropriately, then resuspend in FACS Buffer (see Recipes below).Dispense 100 μl cell suspension in each well of a 96 well plate, as necessary.Add 2 μl Fc block to each well and wait for 10 min.Add respective flow cytometry antibodies and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Figure 3B outlines markers for endothelial cells, leukocytes, and pan-immune cells, for example.Centrifuge plate at 700 × g for 4 min.Remove supernatant, and add 100 μl FACS Buffer to each well.Centrifuge plate at 700 × g for 4 min.Remove supernatant, and add 100 μl FACS Buffer to each well.Resuspend thoroughly, then transfer cells into the filter top of FACS tubes prepared with 300 μl FACS buffer.Run cells on a flow cytometer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4184/bioprotoc-11-19-4184-g003.jpgFigure 3. Identification of transfected liver cell types 5 h after IV eGFP mRNA-LNP injection. A. Co-immunostaining for eGFP (green) and liver cell type-specific markers (red, HNF4a for hepatocytes, CK19 for cholangiocytes, CD31 for endothelial cells, and F4-80 for KC); 200× magnification pictures and close-ups are shown. White arrowheads indicate co-stained cells. B. Representative flow cytometry analyses showing percent of eGFP+ cells in CD11b+ (most likely identifying KCs/macrophages as inflammation is minimal, therefore the presence of CD11b+ neutrophils and CD11b+ NK cells unlikely), CD45+ (for blood cells), and CD31+ (for endothelial cells) NPC fractions from mice injected with Poly(C) RNA-LNP or eGFP mRNA-LNP. All NPC fractions were gated for live cells present in Zombie NIR-negative populations. Data are presented as mean values ± SEM for n = 3 mice per group.",
