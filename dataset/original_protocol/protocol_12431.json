    "NOTE: The study protocol was approved by the local Human Subjects Review Board at RWTH Aachen University and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Task Design\nChoose an appropriate task to investigate the cognitive/psychological construct of interest. Use the visual oddball task (Figure 1) to measure target detection responses and the effects of attention on target detection. This allows investigation of the influence of task manipulations on fMRI data.\nUse three versions of the oddball task.\n\t\nPassive version: Ask the subject to observe visual stimuli. Do not detect any response.\nSilent count version: Ask the subject to count the target stimuli. This task requires directing attention towards these stimuli and a discriminating process.\nRespond version: Ask the subject to push a response button upon seeing a target stimulus. This task requires attention, discrimination processes, and selection/production of a response to target stimuli.\nConsider the appropriate number of trials required for a robust response. The signal to noise ratio in fMRI measurements is relatively low and requires a number of responses to be averaged in order to investigate the effects of interest9. This depends on the task and stimulus modality used. 200 trials are used in this task, 40 of which are target trials sufficient to elicit a robust response.\nDetermine the timings for the sequence of stimuli. The timing of stimuli is crucial in an fMRI study for consideration of presentation rate10. Consider the hemodynamic response-delay between stimulus onset and the measured brain response (Figure 2).",
    "Maintain a balance between delivering sufficient stimuli in a reasonable amount of time and allow sufficient sampling of the hemodynamic response to each stimulus, including the return to baseline. Download, install and run optseq software. Run optseq to optimally distributing the trials across the experiment based on number of trials, stimulus duration and scanning parameters (repetition time and number of volumes).\nImplement the order of stimuli (previously determined) in a suitable program for presenting the paradigm to the subject.\n\t\nSpecify all information relevant to the paradigm in terms of type of stimuli, timing and responses.\n\t\tNOTE: Programming details are not presented here because each paradigm will have different requirements as will different software packages.\nSet up the program that will deliver the experimental paradigm so that it will start with a trigger from the scanner. This allows synchronization of the acquired data and the sequence of stimuli presented.\n2. Setup Experimental Environment\nPrepare the scanner room. Connect the bottom part of correct head coil to the scanner bed. Place clean protective covers on the scanner bed and cushions.\nUse a display device to present the experimental paradigm to the subject and record the responses using a hand held device. Switch the display device and a hand held device “on”.\nStart the software that will deliver the experimental paradigm and provide a name for the logfile. The logfile contains information about the timing of the stimuli and of the responses made by the subject. Use this information for analyzing the data.\nRegister the subject in the MR scanner database. Record data using a unique identification number. Do not store subject’s name with the data to guarantee privacy.",
    "Make sure that the MR sequences to be run are set up and ready. Use the following sequences: a localizer scan to obtain the subjects’ head position inside the coil, an EPI sequence for the functional imaging and MPRAGE for a high resolution structural scan.\n3. Subject Arrival and Entrance to Scanner\nScreen the subject for contraindications with MRI prior to the experiment (e.g., during the recruitment procedure).\n\t\nProvide MR safety instructions before scanning. Perform screening of subjects (by trained personnel). Ensure subjects’ safety. Make sure they have no metal in their body, do not have devices such as pacemakers and do not meet any other exclusion criteria.\nUpon subjects’ arrival check the screening questionnaire and confirm their compatibility before proceeding.\nExplain the experimental procedure to the subject and offer the opportunity to ask questions. Ask the subject to sign the consent and data protection forms.\nIf the experiment involves complex tasks requiring training it is recommended that the subject performs a practice run prior to going in the scanner.\nEnsure that the subject is metal free, without any coins, belt, watch and jewelry. Once confirmed, let the subject in the scanner room.\nAsk the subject to sit on the scanner bed wearing earplugs. The earplugs used here provide protection against the noise from the scanner during scanning and also allow the investigator to communicate directly with the subject from the control room. In some facilities headphones are used for communication with the subject.",
    "Ask the subject to lie down on the scanner bed. Offer the subject a cushion to go under the knees to reduce back pain. The comfort of the subject is important for their well-being and data quality. Movement resulting from discomfort will have a negative impact on the imaging data and distraction caused by discomfort will influence the performance of the task.\nPlace the top part of the head coil over the subject’s head and plug in the connectors. Position the subject’s head appropriately in the head coil. Align the small marker on the head coil along the subjects’ eyebrows. Ensure the subject is lying straight and comfortable. The coil surface should not touch the face (e.g., pressing on the nose).\nSecure the subject’s head with small cushions to minimize head movements during scanning. Head movements have negative impact on the quality of the data.\nPlace a mirror on top of the head coil for the subject to see the experimental paradigm displayed on the screen behind. Ensure the subject can see the whole screen. Move the mounted mirror according to the subject’s position. Subjects with glasses must wear MR compatible eyewear. Most MRI research facilities have compatible lenses or goggles. In this case, mount MR compatible lenses on the frame that holds the mirror. Determine the appropriate lens strength before the subject enters the scanner room.\nHand the subject an emergency call button to stop the scan if required. Make sure the subject knows where the button is and that they can easily reach it.\nMove the subject to the entrance of the bore of the scanner. Ask the subject to close their eyes during this procedure. Align the light with the small marks on the head coil to establish the correct position.",
    "Move the subject into the bore of the scanner until the display reads ‘0 mm’. This means that the head of the subject is at the isocenter of the scanner.\nHand the subject the response device.\n4. Experimental Procedure\nCheck if the subject can hear the experimenter via the intercom and that the subject is comfortable and ready to start.\nPerform a localizer scan to obtain the position of the subject’s head in the scanner. Use this to position the field of view of all of the remaining measurements to determine the parts of the brain to be measured.\nFirst perform a high resolution structural scan. Open the MPRAGE sequence/program and position the field of view. Ensure the entire subject’s head is within the field of view. MP-RAGE parameters: TR/TE = 2,250 / 3.03 msec, flip angle = 9°, 176 sagittal slices, FOV 256 x 256 mm, 64 x 64 matrix, voxel size 1 x 1 x 1 mm).\nLet the subject know that the scan will start and then begin the measurement.\nPerform functional MRI scan.\n\t\nOpen the EPI sequence on the scanner computer and align the field of view to cover the entire brain. EPI parameters: 33 slices, slice thickness 3 mm, FOV 200 x 200 mm, 64 x 64 matrix, repetition time 2,000 msec, echo time 30 msec, flip angle 79°.\nRun a single volume test measurement. Make sure that the whole (or as much as possible) of the subject’s brain is contained within the field of view.\n\t\tNOTE: Subjects have different shapes and sizes of heads (and brains). Hence, optimally position the field of view for each subject.",
    "Copy the fMRI sequence so that the positioned field of view remains the same for the next measurement. Enter the number of volumes required for the measurement, 304 in this case.\nMake sure the software presenting the paradigm is waiting for a trigger from the scanner. The paradigm will not start without a trigger from the scanner so it can be loaded and set to wait.\nInform the subject that the experiment is about to start. Start the measurement.\nCheck that the software presenting the paradigm starts at the appropriate time (i.e. that it is triggered by the scanner).\nPerform three versions of the oddball task. Passive, Count, and Respond.\nSpeak to the subject in between runs to provide reassurance. Ensure their comfort. Ask if the subject permits to continue with the study. Instruct the subject of the upcoming task.\nFirst run the passive condition to ensure true passive viewing without knowledge that the target stimuli are indeed target stimuli. Counterbalance the order of the count and respond conditions across subjects to prevent order effects.\n5. End of Experiment\nInform the subject that the experiment is finished enter the scanner room.\nSlide the subject out of scanner.\nRemove head coil and cushions.\nAsk the subject to sit up slowly. Once they are comfortable, the subject can stand up and leave the scanner room.\nAdminister any questionnaires/paperwork that needs to be completed after the experiment\nDebrief the subject: provide the subject with an explanation about the aims and purpose of the study if this was not fully possible prior to the experiment and offer the opportunity to ask questions\n6. Data Analysis\nUse a software package that is suitable for analyzing fMRI data. Perform first level data analysis for each subject and each condition separately.",
    "NOTE: Use the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) for fMRI data analysis.\nApply standard preprocessing steps to prepare the data for further analysis.\n\tNOTE: Apply the following steps: motion correction, slice timing correction, coregistration of structural and function data, spatial smoothing, highpass temporal filtering, normalization of individual into standard (e.g., MNI) space. Find a summary of these steps in fMRI textbooks Huettel et al, (2008)9 and Jezzard et al, (2001)11. Specific information on how to perform preprocessing steps is available on the website and in the supporting documentation for each individual software package.\nFor the statistical analysis specify the onset times and durations of all events. These are termed explanatory variables (EVs), or regressors.\nSet up contrasts to determine which EVs are compared. To identify the BOLD activation specific to detection of target stimuli set up the following contrast: target > non-target stimuli.\n\tNOTE: Optionally use other contrasts: target stimuli against baseline; non-target stimuli against baseline; target stimuli > non-target stimuli; non-target stimuli > target stimuli\nPerform the first level statistical analysis for each subject and each condition separately. The output of the analysis shows the active brain regions for each of the respective contrast.\nCompare the three conditions using a second level, or group level, analyses. Use the output of the first level analysis as the input for the group level analysis.\n\tNOTE: In the original paper7 the differences between conditions on the target > frequent contrast using a Tripled Two-Group Difference design involving the following contrasts: respond > passive, count > passive, respond > count. These contrasts reveal brain activity associated with the variation in cognitive processes across the three response modalities.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
