    "Notes:  The first two steps of this protocol (sperm recovery and motility analysis) are performed under time and temperature constraints. Sperm motility is a physiological phenomenon that evolves over time and is impacted by the temperature of the environment. To obtain reproducible motility data, the time between sperm extraction and motility measurement has to be the same for all individuals in the study (optimal time would be between 15 and 20 min), and a temperature of 37 °C has to be maintained throughout. As concentration and morphology measurements are not impacted by these factors, they can then be carried out comfortably afterwards, without restrictions. When handling sperm, always use a cut or wide-opening pipette tip (see Figure 1). The use of normal tips induces deleterious effects on the motility and morphology of spermatozoa. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221016/20221016190013_5128.jpg Figure 1. Use wide-opening pipette tips Before beginning the procedurePrepare Petri dishes (two per individual, one per epididymis) with 1 mL of M2 medium and one tube with 5 mL of M2 medium. Heat them to 37 °C for at least 2 h before starting the experiment.Prepare the dissection field.Preheat the heating block to 37 °C and place 2 mL microtubes in it (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221016/20221016190024_3662.jpg Figure 2. Suggested organization of the heating block Connect the heated blade holder of the CASA.Turn on the computer, start the CASA software (Figure 3), and enter the sample numbers if appropriate. Note: The sperm analysis software must have the animal analysis module and be configured according to its user manual. We provide the parameters to be used for mice sperm analysis in Table 1, but we will not go over all the basic configuration elements. For this, please refer to the CEROS II manual.  Table 1.

Screenshot of the software window Sperm recoverySacrifice the animal according to the procedures established in your country and validated by your local ethics committees.Note: To obtain reproducible and exploitable data, all animals in the same study should be sacrificed at the same age (we recommend between 10 and 12 weeks for an evaluation of the reproductive function in the mature male). Immediately put the animal on its back on a sterile surgical field and disinfect the abdominal and genital area with ethanol.Note: Simply spray or apply ethanol with a sterile compress. Use surgical scissors to make a horizontal skin incision from one lumbar region to the other (Figure 4A), and a large vertical incision through the hypogastric region to the pelvis region (Figure 4B).Expose the organs by incising vertically through the abdominal muscle wall (Figure 4C).Note: A quick check will allow you to spot unexpected flagrant anomalies such as a situs invertus. Locate (Figure 4D) and pull upward with surgical clamps the fat deposits located on each side of the pelvic fossae to elevate and expose the testicles (Figure 4E).Note: Be careful not to puncture the bladder. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221016/20221016190311_2753.jpg Figure 4. Sequence of surgical procedures for exposure of reproductive organs Locate the different structures of the reproductive tract from the testis (Figure 5A). Start with the head of the epididymis visible on the testicle and then proceed to the body, tail, and then the efferent canal.Isolate the tail of the epididymis by incising at one millimeter past the tail-canal junction distally (Figure 5B) and at the body-tail junction proximally (Figure 5C), and place it immediately in the pre-warmed M2 medium in Petri dish.Note: Optimal time for steps 1–7 is less than 10 min. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221016/20221016190358_1803.jpg Figure 5.",
    "Sequence of surgical procedures for epididymal tail isolation with indication of testis (asterisk), epididymal head (cross), and tail (arrow) Dissect the epididymis with two needles under a binocular loupe with a preheated plate at 37 °C (Figure 6).Note: It is important to completely drain the tail of the epididymis to obtain the correct concentration of spermatozoa. The dissection must be done very quickly, which can be challenging for a beginner. In this case, always take the same amount of time to dilate the epididymes of the different individuals of the same study. Optimal time for step 8 is less than 10 min (for both epididymis). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221016/20221016190449_7361.jpg Figure 6. Place the tail of the epididymis so that the incisions are clearly visible. (A) Apply pressure to the tail of the epididymis with a needle to remove the sperm through the vas deferens. (B) The spermatozoa will come out as a jelly that will disintegrate in the medium. (C) Empty the epididymis completely by applying repeated pressure. (D) It may be necessary to pierce the organ in several places to empty it completely.Place the Petri dishes in an incubator at 37 °C for 10 min to allow the sperm to gain motility.Note: These ten minutes can be used to adjust the CASA settings and fill in the sample identification in the software, if not already done beforehand. Sperm motility assessmentTransfer the sperm in M2 medium from the Petri dish to the 2 mL microtube preheated in a 37 °C heating block.Note: You can pool the two epididymides of the same individual or treat them separately according to your needs. Take 20 µL of suspended semen, place it in a second Eppendorf, then dilute it with preheated M2 medium.Note: The dilution performed depends on the mice strain used.",
    "Perform an experiment beforehand on a control individual to identify the dilution to be used for the rest of the study. For example, we use a standard 1:50 dilution for our Black 6 mice but a 1:100 dilution for our OF1 mice. Homogenize and then transfer the sample to a Leja slide. Put the slide in the heated blade holder under the microscope.Note: Wait a few moments for the flow to stabilize in the chamber to prevent the sperm trajectories from being affected by any residual Brownian motion. Confirm that the sperm density is in the acceptable range of the software and check that the sample identification is correct.Note: The software acceptability cut-off is relatively high. We advise to use a concentration that does not lead to a systematic crossing of the trajectories to allow an easier analysis afterwards. Acquire with the software as much field as you may need.Note: For a statistically robust analysis, we recommend acquiring a minimum of 200 motile spermatozoa. Use a “forward walk” reading during the acquisition to avoid taking the same field several times (Figure 7). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221016/20221016190514_0427.jpg Figure 7. “Forward walk” reading path on a Leja slide Process all samples successively in the same way.Note: The purpose here is to acquire the data (the videos) to being able to interpret them later. Do not waste time interpreting now and focus on acquiring all the samples sequentially. Sperm concentration assessmentNote: We describe here the method used for a Thoma chamber; however, you can use any other type of counting chamber (e.g., Mallassez or Makler) as long as you follow the associated instructions.Take 10 µL of suspended semen, place it in a third Eppendorf, and add 90 µL of sterile H2O to immobilize the spermatozoa.",
    "Note: You can use another dilution, but you will have to take it into account when calculating the final concentration. Homogenize and transfer 10 µL to the Thoma counting chamber.Count the number of sperm present on two lines to obtain the sperm concentration expressed in millions per milliliter (Figure 8).Note: Count the sperm heads; single flagella are not counted or counted separately. This is also an opportunity to calculate the concentration of any round cells in the ejaculate (germline or immune cells). If you have pooled epididymides, do not forget to multiply by two. You can count more lines and average the results for more accuracy. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221016/20221016190604_8030.jpg Figure 8. Count two full lines of a 1:10 diluted sample to obtain the cell concentration in millions per milliliter Sperm morphology assessmentTransfer the remaining samples to 15 mL tubes. Add 3 mL of 1× PBS. Homogenize by gentle pipetting.Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.Add another 3 mL of 1× PBS to the pellet.Homogenize by gentle pipetting.Centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.Add another 200 µL of 1× PBS to the pellet.Homogenize by gentle pipetting.Put 10 µL (this volume can be adjusted according to the desired concentration of cells on the slide) at the base of a clean slide and make a smear with a second slide.Note: The drop must be \"pulled\" and not \"pushed\" by the second blade, which would break the sperm flagella (see Figure 9). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20221016/20221016190714_9666.jpg Figure 9. The smearing blade should be placed in front of the drop and pull it forward. It must not push or cut through the drop.Let dry at room temperature.Immerse in a 75% ethanol bath for at least 1 h.Let dry at room temperature.",
    "Perform a Harris-Schorr staining by carrying out the following sequence of baths (one immersion corresponds to a duration of approximately 1 s):Tap water—15 immersionsHematoxylin—2 minTap water—15 immersionsEthanol ammoniacal—10 immersionsTap water—15 immersionsEthanol 50%—5 minShorr—5 minEthanol 50%—5 minEthanol 75%—5 minEthanol 95%—5 minAllow the stained slides to dry completely.Note: Any alcohol residue will interfere with the interpretation. Mount the slides with Eukitt and a 24 mm × 60 mm cover slide.Note: Avoid trapping air bubbles and remove them by applying gentle pressure to the cover slide if necessary. Let the mounted smear dry horizontally on absorbent paper for 24 h before interpretation."
