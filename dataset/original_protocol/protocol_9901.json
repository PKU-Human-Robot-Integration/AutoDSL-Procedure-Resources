    "All steps in this protocol are approved by and follow the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Virginia.\nNOTE: There are some important controls to consider for later analysis steps, which are summarized in Table 1 and should be considered prior to liposome administration.\n1. Preparation of fluorescently labelled liposomes, loaded with calcium acetate and tesaglitazar\nCombine DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), cholesterol, PEG-2000-DSPE, and DiD. For this, combime the DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG-2000 DSPE at a mass ratio of 2:1:1. Add DiD lipid dye at a concentration of 1 mg of DiD per 1 mL of liposomes (molar ratio of 46:1 of DSPC:DiD).\n\tNOTE: DiD is an accepted abbreviation for 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'tetramethylindocarbocyanine dye. As it has two octadecyl \"fatty tails\" of equal length to the DSPC utilized in this formulation, it should mostly incorporate into the lipid membrane. Lipid dyes like DiO, DiD and DiI are routinely used for liposome research8 and they are considered non-exchangeable18.\nUse a 20 mL scintillation vial for the inverted phase emulsion and liposome preparation. In this vial, mix a 2:1 ether-chloroform solution of lipids with aqueous calcium acetate (Ca-acetate, 1 M, pH 7.4). The ratio between organic and aqueous phase should be 4:1, e.g., 4 mL of organic phase and 1 mL of aqueous phase.\nEmulsify the ether-chloroform solution of lipids by sonication for 30 s at room temperature. Operate the sonicator at 20 KHz and 50% power and use a ½ in. probe.",
    "NOTE: Keep the tip of the sonicator probe closer to the bottom of the vial to avoid foaming. Do not touch the glass with the probe tip during sonication, it may break. Additionally, chloroform needs to be added to the ether as a co-solvent: in the presence of cholesterol, an ether-only emulsion separates rapidly, making this step of the procedure impossible.\nImmediately place the vial with homogenized water-in-oil emulsion on a rotary evaporator with a special adapter, manometer gauge, and a pressure regulator valve. The evaporator should be connected to a vacuum line to remove the organic solvents. Set the rotation rate at 100 rpm and the vacuum at 0.5 atm, and release if emulsion foaming looks excessive. After a gel forms and disappears, increase the vacuum to 0.9 atm.\n\tNOTE: During volatile organic phase removal, the vacuum level should be adjusted gradually, to avoid rapid foaming, as it may lead to content loss from the vial into the body of the rotary evaporator. Eventually, when the ether and chloroform partially evaporate and the volume ratio between aqueous and organic solvent phase is close to 1:1, a gel will form. Evaporation should continue until the gel disappears and remaining aqueous media is completely liquid again. Additional mixing may help accelerate organic solvent removal. This can be achieved by placing a polytetrafluoroethylene stir bar into the evaporation flask, to enhance convection of the viscous gel during rotary evaporation.\nFilter the resultant liposomes using track-etched polycarbonate membranes to achieve homogeneous size distribution.\n\t\nPerform filtration by passing the liposome aqueous dispersion back-and-forth multiple times through a 200 nm-pore polycarbonate filter in a liposome extruder equipped with two gas-tight syringes.",
    "NOTE: Smaller syringes are preferred (e.g., 0.5 mL) as they assure generation of sufficient pressure for filtration. With a high cholesterol content in the liposome membrane, a high temperature is not necessary, and the procedure can be performed at room temperature. An odd number of filtrations (e.g., 21) is performed, so that the resulting material ends up on the opposite side of the filter from the start and if pre-sterilized, the sterile sample of filtered size adjusted-liposomes can be collected. The size of the resulting liposomes is typically close to the selected filter pore size. Two filters can be stacked (instead of one) to perform fine adjustment to lower particle size.\nVerify size distribution using dynamic laser light scattering (DLS)3,4.\n\t\t\nAdd 1 to 3 mL of saline to a 1 cm cuvette with four transparent sides. To that, add 10‒20 µL of liposomes and mix carefully. Place the sample into the apparatus and select the following parameters to measure: solvent viscosity, refractive index, refractive index of lipids. Click the Start button. The measurements will last several minutes and consist of 100 or more runs.\nRemove external Ca-acetate using a desalting spin-column. To half of the batch, add aqueous tesaglitazar in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and incubate with mixing at 37 °C for 1 h. Use the second half of the batch as a drug-free control liposome formulation.\n\tNOTE: Pre-equilibrate the 2-mL desalting spin-column with 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, prior to use. To do this, place 1 mL of HEPES buffer into the column and spin in a centrifuge at 1000 x g for 2 min. Remove the pass-through buffer and repeat this four times.\nRemove unentrapped tesaglitazar from liposomes using a 2 mL spin-column, and determine the concentration of entrapped drug spectrophotometrically.",
    "Add no more than 0.5 mL of liposome sample to the dry column gel bed and wait until all the sample enters the gel. Centrifuge at exactly the same conditions as earlier (1000 x g, 2 min) and collect the liposome sample in the pass-through purified from small molecular mass compounds.\nQuantify final particle features: particle size and concentration using DLS and zeta potential with a combined DLS-electrophorectic light scattering (ELS) system3,4 in 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4 and at 25 °C.\n\t\nSimilar to step 1.5.2, dilute liposome dispersion in the measurement buffer (e.g., 10 µL liposomes per 1 mL of buffer solution) into a U-shaped cuvette using a disposable Luer syringe, or a pipette with a cut tip. Make sure there are no bubbles in the “U” so that there is uninterrupted solution for electrical current flow.\nPlace the cuvette into the unit (please pay attention to the front and back of the cuvette, so that electrodes are properly connected to the unit). Close the instrument door; after this, the measurement takes place (with multiple repeats), under control of the guidance software.\n2. Prepare liposomes for in vivo administration\nIn a biosafety cabinet, dilute liposomes in sterile saline to the appropriate concentration in a final volume of 50 µL for in vivo administration.",
    "NOTE: In previous studies, our liposome preparation contained 2 mg/mL of tesaglitazar, which equals about 4.89 µmol of tesaglitazar/mL, and we administered liposomes at a dose of 1 µmol drug/kg. For a 40 g mouse, we would bring 8.2 µL of liposomes up to a final volume of 50 µL in saline. Using DLS/ELS, the number of liposomes per unit volume should also be quantified for preparations of drug- and vehicle-loaded liposomes to ensure that an equal number of vehicle liposomes are administered per gram of mouse weight compared to the drug-loaded liposomes.\nLoad the liposome solution into a 27 G needle in the biosafety cabinet. Keep this at room temperature to avoid injecting cold solution into the mouse.\n3. Administer liposomes via retro-orbital intravenous injection\nNOTE: It is also appropriate to conduct the intravenous injection by other methods, such as tail vein injections if it is preferred. While not covered in this protocol published protocols explaining this method19 are available.\nSet up the workspace for delivering liposomes.\n\t\nClean the workbench with 70% ethanol. Make sure to select a space that permits the use of an isoflurane anesthesia system.\nTurn on a warming pad and place a clean pad or towel over it to keep the mouse on a clean surface. Allow enough time for the pad to warm up before beginning work with mice.\nSet up the anesthesia system so that the chamber is nearby and the nose cone is on the warming pad.\n\t\t\nMake sure all other aspects of the system are ready (for example, isoflurane level is high enough in the vaporizer, the charcoal filter has been weighed, tubing is connected correctly).\nGather the other materials needed for this section of the protocol: ophthalmic lubricant gel, a local anesthetic for post-administration treatment, sterile gauze pads.",
    "Sedate the mouse using isoflurane in the induction chamber. Once it is unresponsive to a gentle foot tap, quickly transfer the mouse to the workspace while maintaining sedation through a nose cone.\n\tNOTE: The animal should be maintained at 1.5% to 2.5% isoflurane and assessed for an appropriate depth of anesthesia (via a lack of response to toe pinch) prior to proceeding with the procedure.\nShift the mouse to one side for liposome administration. Because the mouse will not blink while anesthetized, apply a small amount of ophthalmic lubricant to both eyes to keep them moisturized during the remainder of the procedure.\nGently press down on the skin above and below the exposed eye. The eye should lift above the plane of the face.\nCarefully insert the tip of the needle at the medial canthus, making sure the needle is below the eye and not touching it. Once the needle is inserted below the eye, slowly inject the liposomes into the retro-orbital space. Upon withdrawing the needle, it may be necessary to close the eyelids for a few seconds to achieve hemostasis.\n\t\nIf the needle is not inserted far enough in, the solution may emerge up around the eye. Stop injecting immediately if this is seen and re-position the needle.\nApply a local anesthetic, such as proparacaine, to the eye to prevent post-procedure pain and discomfort.\nKeep the mouse on a warming pad and monitor until it awakens to ensure it is well and maintains proper body temperature.\nReturn the mouse to its cage and its normal housing environment until the time point of interest arrives.\n\tNOTE: This should be done in line with local IACUC guidelines.\n4. Prepare materials for the tissue harvest, tissue processing, and flow cytometry staining",
    "Prepare solutions for the harvest, processing, and staining (sections 5‒7): phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-Heparin, HEPES Buffer, 2 mg/mL Collagenase type I, AKC lysis buffer, FACS buffer, PBS, Fixation buffer (Table 2). Keep all solutions except the fixation buffer at 4 °C or on ice during the procedure.\nPrepare tubes with buffers and other materials for harvesting and processing tissues.\n\t\nFor blood from each mouse, add 10 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to a 1.5 or 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube for collecting the blood. The EDTA will prevent the blood from clotting. A 1 mL syringe with a 25 G needle and a 15 mL conical tube are also needed.\nFor the spleen, gather one 1.5 or 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube with 1 mL of HEPES buffer, a 1 mL syringe, two 50 mL conical tubes, and two 70 µm filters per spleen.\nFor each adipose tissue depot, gather a 20 mL polyethylene vial with 1.5 mL of HEPES buffer for mincing the tissue, a 50 mL conical tube, and a 70 µm filter per adipose tissue type per mouse.\nPrepare the workspace for the harvest.\n\t\nClean off the bench space with 70% ethanol. Prepare a rubber tray for pinning the mouse during harvest by cleaning it off with 70% ethanol and covering it with an absorbent pad or paper towels. Make sure at least 5 pins are available to work with.\nFill a 10 mL syringe with PBS-heparin and fasten on a 25 G needle for perfusion.\nGather tools and materials to use during the harvest. Forceps (two pairs), scissors, paper towels, lint-free wipes, the microcentrifuge tube(s) with EDTA, the microcentrifuge tube(s) with HEPES buffer, and the polyethylene vial(s) with HEPES buffer are needed.\n5. Harvest the tissues",
    "Euthanize the mouse by CO2 asphyxiation. Do not conduct a cervical dislocation as this may prevent effective blood collection and tissue perfusion at later steps.\nAt a cleaned bench area with enough working space and lighting to see the mouse well, set up a rubber dissection tray, a bucket of ice for storing samples, and a spray bottle with 70% ethanol. Spray down the mouse with 70% ethanol to reduce contamination and control hair spread. Place the mouse on its back on the rubber tray and pin down its paws spread out away from its body.\nTo prepare for collecting blood, carefully make an incision in the skin at the edge of caudal end of the mouse’s ribcage. Cut a small, straight line up towards the mouse’s head (about 1 cm) until the pectoralis muscles are exposed.\n\t\nAt the initial incision site, make two small cuts perpendicular to the line towards the head. Then, carefully cut away the pectoralis muscle on one side of the rib cage in the exposed area. This allows better access and visualization for where the needle should be inserted.\nTo collect blood, insert the needle between the third and fourth ribs on the side where the muscle was removed. Since the mouse’s heart is found at the center of the chest cavity, keep the needle as close to the center line of the rib cage as possible. Once inserted, gently pull up on the syringe to begin collecting blood.\nOnce collected, transfer the blood to the prepared microcentrifuge tube with EDTA and store on ice.",
    "NOTE: If about 100 µL of volume is pulled up and no blood enters the syringe, try rotating the syringe to the right or left in case the needle opening is pressed up against the wall of the heart. If this does not help, slowly move the needle further into the chest cavity or begin removing. If blood begins to collect in the syringe at this point, continue to pull back on the syringe slowly. Consider rotating the syringe and needle for successful extraction. Finally, if no blood is collected, remove the needle as it may have missed the heart. Try reinserting the needle and repeating the aforementioned process again.\nNext, to perfuse the mouse, open up the chest cavity to access the heart.\n\t\nTo do this, cut the skin along the end of the rib cage down to the mouse’s side on each side. Then, use the forceps to hold up the sternum away from the working surface. Make a small, shallow incision just below the end of the sternum to cut through the peritoneal cavity. Cut along the peritoneal membrane along the end of the rib cage on each of the mouse’s sides. This should expose the liver and gallbladder. Be careful not to cut into either of these tissues.\nNext, make a small, shallow cut into the diaphragm, cranial to the liver. Then, cut the diaphragm along the edge of the rib cage to open up the chest cavity. Be sure to avoid cutting any of the organs within the chest cavity.\nMake two cuts along the rib cage towards the head about 2-3 mm from the center line of the mouse and about 0.75 cm long.",
    "NOTE: If cut up too high, the arteries residing at the top of the rib cage will be cut. This will interfere with efficacy of perfusion.\nLift back the center piece of the rib cage to expose the chest cavity. Move any fat or tissue away to access the heart.\nMake a small cut into the right atrium of the mouse’s heart to create an opening through which to push out the blood.\nUsing a 10 mL syringe of PBS-heparin, insert the needle into the left ventricle of the mouse’s heart.\nGently begin pushing PBS into the heart as slowly as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: Blood should be observed emerging from the right atria and filling the chest cavity. Be sure to keep the heart in its physiological location to avoid inhibiting the flow of PBS-heparin from the heart through the aorta.\nOnce all the 10 mL of PBS-heparin have been perfused through the mouse, discard the syringe and needle and remove excess blood and PBS-Heparin from the chest cavity using paper towels or lint-free wipes.\nNext, to begin extracting tissues, cut down the skin and peritoneal membrane towards the mouse’s tail to open up the peritoneal cavity.\nFirst, extract the inguinal adipose tissue pad from each side of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: Read this process carefully: be sure to extract the inguinal lymph node from each depot to avoid skewing the adipose tissue cellular make-up in the results.",
    "Using a second set of forceps, hold the peritoneal membrane with one set of forceps and the edge of the skin overlaid above the membrane on that side with the other forceps. Gently pull the skin away from the peritoneal membrane to separate these layers from one another. Look for the the inguinal adipose tissue depot along the skin. Pin down the outer edge of the skin to better access the adipose depot.\nPrior to extraction, locate the inguinal lymph node in the center of the adipose depot and remove it using forceps and scissors as needed.\n\t\tNOTE: If possible, locate the three larger arteries that run from the outer edges of the depot towards the center. The lymph node is located around where these arteries meet.\nAfter the lymph node is removed, carefully hold the end of the adipose depot nearest to the pinned point with the forceps and begin making small cuts at the connective membrane between the adipose tissue and the skin. Lift the adipose tissue away from the skin while making cuts to make better access the membrane and ensure the entire depot is extracted.\nPlace the adipose depot in a prepared polyethylene vial with HEPES buffer on ice to keep the tissue viable during the remainder of the harvest.\nRepeat this process on the other side of the mouse to extract both depots. Depots can either be digested and processed together or separately. If each depot is to be processed separately, more tubes must be prepared.\nNext, extract the epididymal adipose depots from the caudal end of the peritoneal cavity. Using forceps, gently pull the first epididymal adipose depot way from the dorsal end of the mouse and locate the epididymis and vas deferens attached to this depot.",
    "NOTE: There are two epididymal adipose depots: one attached to each epididymis and vas deferens.\n\t\nCarefully cut between the adipose depot and the epididymis and vas deferens to separate the adipose from these other tissues. Place the adipose depot in a polyethylene vial with HEPES buffer on ice to keep the tissue viable during the remainder of the harvest.\nFinally, extract the spleen, which is found to the left of the stomach near the diaphragm. Using forceps, gently pull the stomach towards the center of the peritoneal cavity to expose the spleen.\n\t\nGently hold one end of the spleen and pull it slightly away from the stomach. Cut the membrane between the spleen and its adjacent tissue until the organ is detached. Place the spleen in the prepared microcentrifuge tube with HEPES buffer and store on ice.\nPrior to processing tissues or harvesting tissues from the next mouse, discard the carcass and any soiled paper towels or pads. Wipe off tools as well.\n\tNOTE: If there are multiple mice, repeat these harvest steps for each mouse prior to moving on to the next processing step. If a control mouse/mice is included, consider harvesting these prior to liposome-treated mice to avoid any contamination.\n6. Process tissues\nNOTE: Since the adipose tissue has a long digestion incubation, it is recommended to start with that process first and work on processing the blood and spleen during the digestion period.\nFirst, mince and digest the adipose tissues. Using one or two pairs of scissors, mince the adipose tissue in each polyethylene vial until the tissue is in small pieces of less than 0.5 mm in size. This allows for more efficient digestion.",
    "Once tissues in all vials are minced, add 1.5 mL of 2 mg/mL Collagenase buffer to each vial. Place the vials in a shaking incubator set to 37 °C and 150 rpm. Incubate for 30 to 45 min.\n\t\tNOTE: If the adipose tissues are particularly large, consider adding another 0.5 mL to 1.5 mL of HEPES buffer and an equal volume of Collagenase buffer to the vial(s) to ensure tissues are fully submerged and enough enzyme is present. The final concentration of Collagenase Type I at digestion should be 1 mg/mL regardless of the final solution volume. Furthermore, if a shaking incubator is not available, samples can be placed in a water bath heated to 37 °C. Gently shake the samples every 5 min to mix and resuspend the digestion.\nCheck the samples at 30 min. Use a 1 mL pipet to pipet the sample up and down. If the tissue pieces are still too large for easy pipetting, return the samples to the incubator for an additional 15 min.\nOnce the samples are fully digested, continue to pipet the sample up and down another 10 times to ensure a single-cell suspension has been created.\n\t\tNOTE: (Optional) Check the samples at 30 min. Use a 1 mL pipette to pipet the sample up and down. If the tissue pieces are still too large for easy pipetting, return the samples to the incubator for an additional 15 min.\nPipet the cell suspension through a 70 µm filter into a 50 mL conical tube. Add 5 mL of FACS buffer to the empty digestion vial to wash the vial out. Transfer this wash buffer through the filter to add to the cell suspension.",
    "Store samples on ice while others are being processed. Once all samples are filtered, spin them down at 400 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the adipocyte supernatant by aspiration and then carefully remove the infranatant between the adipocyte supernatant and pellet by aspiration to leave the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) pellet.\nResuspend this pellet in 1 mL of FACS buffer and transfer to a clean 1.5 or 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. Aliquot cells now if desired or needed. Keep on ice until all samples are ready for flow cytometry staining.\n\t\tNOTE: If the adipose depots digested were large, consider only using 50% or 25% of the sample for flow cytometric staining and analysis. Additionally, if any fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls or additional controls for flow cytometry analysis (Table 1) are needed, be sure to aliquot extra sample into a separate tube for processing. FMOs are used to distinguish between negative and positive signal for an individual fluorophore-conjugated antibody within the otherwise-complete panel utilized in the experiment.\nSecond, process the blood.\n\t\nTransfer 50 µL of blood to a 15-mL conical tube.\nAdd 1 mL of AKC lysis buffer to each tube and pipet up and down to reach a single-cell suspension. Add an additional 4 mL of AKC lysis buffer to each tube and incubate for 5‒10 min. If a shaker or rotator is available, seal the tube caps tightly and place the tubes on one of these to enhance mixing.",
    "Add 5 mL of FACS buffer to quench the lysis process and spin the samples at 400 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and check the pellet. If it is still quite red, repeat the lysis process. Otherwise, resuspend the pellets in 1 mL of FACS buffer and transfer to a clean 1.5 or 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. Keep on ice until all samples are ready for flow cytometry staining.\nFinally, process the spleen. Transfer the spleen onto a 70 µm filter over a 50 mL conical tube. Wash the tissue with 1 mL of FACS buffer and then mash the spleen through the filter using the plunger end of a 1 mL syringe. Throughout the mashing process, wash the cells into the 50 mL conical tube using more FACS buffer. The final volume in the conical tube should be 10 mL.\n\t\nSpin the cells at 300 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of AKC lysis buffer. Add an additional 4 mL of AKC lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min. Add 5 mL of FACS buffer to quench the lysis process and spin the samples at 300 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of FACS buffer. Transfer the suspension through a second, clean 70 µm filter into a 50 mL conical tube. Add 4 mL of FACS buffer to wash out the original tube and transfer the buffer through the filter for a final volume of 5 mL.",
    "Transfer 50 µL of the cell suspension to a clean 1.5 or 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice until all samples are ready for flow cytometry staining. Additional aliquots can be transferred to tubes if more are desired or required.\n\t\tNOTE: Splenocytes are excellent cells to use for a Live/Dead single stain. Consider transferring an additional aliquot for this control.\n7. Stain cells from tissues for flow cytometry\nSpin down aliquoted samples at 400 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend samples in 50 µL of Fc Block (diluted) (Table 2). Incubate on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 50 µL of 2x antibody mix (Table 3) to each sample. Incubate on ice in the dark for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Any single stains should NOT be stained with this antibody mix. Additionally, if FMOs are to be used, FMO antibody mixes must be prepared separately.\nWash samples with 1 mL of PBS and spin at 400 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend samples in 200 µL of viability stain (Table 3). Incubate on ice in the dark for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Do not forget to stain cells that were set aside for a Live/Dead single stain during this step.\nWash samples with 1 mL of FACS buffer and spin at 400 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend samples (except Live/Dead single stain) in 50 µL of fixation medium (Reagent A) to fix samples. Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 15 min.\n\t\nResuspend the Live/Dead single stain in 100 µL of 2% PFA. Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 5 min.",
    "Wash sample with 1 mL of FACS buffer and spin at 800 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend samples in 250 to 500 µL of FACS buffer. Store at 4 °C until samples can be run on the flow cytometer.\nWash samples with 1 mL of FACS buffer and spin at 800 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend samples in 50 µL of permeabilization medium (Reagent B) plus antibody/ies to intracellular proteins. Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 20 min.\nWash the samples with 1 mL of FACS buffer and spin at 800 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the samples in 100 µL of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Incubate at room temperature in the dark for 5 min.\nWash samples with 1 mL of FACS buffer and spin at 800 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend samples in 250 to 500 µL of FACS buffer. Store at 4 °C until samples can be run on the flow cytometer."
