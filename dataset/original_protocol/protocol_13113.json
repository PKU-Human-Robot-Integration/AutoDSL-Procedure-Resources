    "All procedures in the current study were performed using Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocols for animal handling at Central Michigan University, MI.\n1. Bioluminescence activation of photosensory proteins in vitro\nConstructs\n\t\nSelect a luciferase sequence or luciferase-fluorescent protein fusion sequence that will result in the expression of a light emitter producing light of a wavelength matching the photoreceptor to be activated.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, blue light-emitting luciferases, such as Gaussia luciferase variants or NanoLuc, can be paired with blue light-sensing photoreceptors such as CRY/Ca2+- and integrin-binding protein (CIB), LOV, or Vivid (VVD).\nIf not already available from other investigators or plasmid deposits, use standard molecular biology techniques to clone the DNA into a mammalian expression plasmid.\n\t\tNOTE: The choice of promoters is dictated by the need to provide strong and constitutive expression of the light-emitting module, such as that provided by the CAG and CMV promoters.\nFor initial studies, use separate plasmids for co-transfection of the light emitter and the light sensor. Generate fusion proteins of the two moieties as needed and for subsequent studies.\nObtain high-quality plasmid DNAs using mini-, midi-, or maxiprep kits according to manufacturer's protocols.\nCell culture and transfection\n\tNOTE: HeLa cells and HEK293 cells are used as examples in this protocol.\n\t\nPlate cells in formats and numbers according to the desired end use.\n\t\tNOTE: Specific examples are given in Table 2. Cell density at the time of plating will determine how soon cells can be transfected.\n\t\t\nFor assessing bioluminescence-activated transcription by fluorescence microscopy, plate HEK293 cells on poly-D-lysine (PDL)-coated 12 mm coverslips placed in 24-well dishes.\nFor assessing bioluminescence-activated transcription by measuring light emission from an orthogonal reporter luciferase in a luminometer, plate HeLa cells initially in 6- or 12-well dishes for transfection but re-plate them after transfection (see step 4).",
    "If repeated bioluminescence stimulation will be carried out in live-cell imaging chambers, select coverslips of the appropriate size and place them into multi-well plates of the appropriate size (24-well plates for 12 mm coverslips; 12-well plates for 15 mm and 18 mm coverslips). Seed the cells on top of the coverslips using the cell numbers specified in Table 2. If the cell type selected does not adhere well to the culture surface, plate the cells on PDL-coated dishes.\nPerform transfection by lipofection according to the manufacturer's recommendation or use any transfection method appropriate for the cell type selected.\n\t\tNOTE: Table 3 details transfection experiments for two different photoreceptors, EL222 and CRY2/CIB, and their respective reporter plasmids, in addition to different light-emitting proteins. The ratios of the various plasmids work well for the selected examples but will have to be optimized for each light emitter/light sensor pair.\nAfter transfection, place the cells in an incubator that is completely light-sealed (Figure 1).\nDepending on the desired end use, use the cells for bioluminescence stimulation the next day in their original wells/dishes, or re-plate them 3-4 h after lipofection. For reading transcription of a firefly luciferase reporter gene in a luminometer, re-plate the cells in white 96-well plates.\n\t\tNOTE: Carry out all manipulations in a light-tight room in a laminar flow hood illuminated by red light (Figure 2).\n\t\t\nWash the transfected cells once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd the minimum volume of a trypsinizing reagent to the wells (24-well: 100 µL; 12-well: 150 µL; 6-well: 300 µL) and incubate the cells for 3 min at 37 °C.",
    "Add culture medium to achieve a cell concentration that will yield the appropriate cell density for the next plating step (for example, resuspend cells in a 24-well in a final volume of 1.2 mL for plating in 10 wells of a 96-well plate; resuspend cells in a 12-well in a final volume of 2.4 mL for plating in 20 wells of a 96-well plate). Pool the transfected cells from several wells depending on the number of wells needed in the end.\nPlate the transfected cells in their final format and return the plates to the light-protected incubator.\nBioluminescence activation in vitro\nPrepare the luciferase substrate (luciferin).\n\t\t\nPrepare 50 mM stocks by dissolving 5 mg of lyophilized coelenterazine (CTZ) in 250 µL of its specific solvent. Ensure that all the CTZ along the walls of the vial is dissolved by pipetting or vortexing. Protect the vial from direct light.\nPrepare 50 µL aliquots in 0.5 mL black microcentrifuge tubes and store at -80 °C for future use.\n\t\t\tNOTE: CTZ dissolved in solvent does not freeze at -80 °C. Aliquots can be removed from and returned to the freezer several times for making working solutions as long as exposure to light and room temperature is kept to a minimum.\nSingle bioluminescence light stimulation\n\t\tNOTE: All manipulations are carried out in a light-tight room in a laminar flow hood illuminated by red light (Figure 2).\n\t\t\nPrepare a working solution of luciferin in cell culture medium (DMEM or NeuroBasal). Adjust the concentration of the luciferin such that the final concentration is 100 µM. Prepare all dilutions of CTZ in medium shortly before adding to the cells, as CTZ oxidizes over time.",
    "NOTE: If the entire volume of medium will be replaced, the working solution will be 100 µM. If luciferin-containing medium is added to the cells, the concentration will be higher by the dilution factor (for example, adding 50 µL of medium containing 300 µM luciferin to 100 µL of medium in the well will result in a 1:3 dilution and thus in a 100 µM final concentration of luciferin).\nAdd luciferin-containing medium to the cells and incubate for the desired duration of light stimulation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This can be as short as 1 min or as long as 15 min and might be even shorter or longer. The length of time for leaving the luciferin-containing medium on the cells depends on the half-life and kinetics of the selected luciferase-luciferin combination.\nMonitor light emission at 100 µM final luciferin concentration by eye after turning off the red light; wait for a few seconds until eyes have adjusted to complete darkness. Document the light emission by taking a photograph (even with a cell phone).\nTerminate the light stimulation by removing the luciferin-containing medium and replacing it with culture medium. Depending on the sensitivity of the experiments, wash the cells with culture medium once or twice after removing the luciferin-containing medium to eliminate all luciferin. If the cells do not adhere well to the culture surface, plate them on PDL-coated dishes to avoid losing the cells during washes.\nReturn the cells to the light-protected incubator for 16-24 h.\nRepeated bioluminescence light stimulation\n\t\tNOTE: All manipulations are carried out in a room that can be made light-tight and be illuminated by red light.",
    "Set up the live-cell imaging chamber. Create a light-tight compartment around the live-cell imaging microscope using a box and black plastic sheets or black drapes (Figure 3). Cover all the light sources present inside the light-tight compartment and the room (e.g., LED indicators on the microscope or instruments).\nSet up the perfusion system with the desired solution for intake and the chamber outport leading to a waste container.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For example, the imaging solution can be Tyrode's Solution (sodium chloride (124 mM), potassium chloride (3 mM), HEPES (10 mM), calcium chloride dihydrate (2 mM), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (1 mM), D-glucose (20 mM)).\nPrepare a working solution of luciferin in the imaging solution. Aliquot into as many microcentrifuge tubes as the number of repeat stimulations. Adjust the concentration of the luciferin such that the final concentration in the imaging chamber is 100 µM.\nPlace a coverslip with transfected cells in the chamber.\nWhile keeping the pump running, remove the inlet tube of the pump from the intake beaker and quickly immerse it in the luciferin solution, keeping the transition time as short as possible to avoid any air void in the tubing.\nAs soon as the luciferin solution has been taken up, place the inlet tube back into the intake beaker. Repeat this process as many times as needed and at intervals of several minutes to hours, depending on the physiological pattern to which the cells are supposed to be exposed.\nReturn the cells to the light-protected incubator for 16-24 h for transcription, or for the length of time the effect of light stimulation is to be assessed.\n2. Bioluminescence activation of photosensory proteins in vivo\nConstructs",
    "Select a luciferase sequence or luciferase-fluorescent protein fusion sequence that will result in the expression of a light emitter producing light of a wavelength matching the photoreceptor to be activated.\nUse standard molecular biology techniques to clone the DNA into a pAAV plasmid, if not already available from other investigators or plasmid deposits.\nChoose strong promoters for the expression of the light-emitting modules, such as CAG or CMV.\nUse standard approaches for preparing high-titer viral stocks6 or have viral vectors commercially prepared.\nFor initial studies, use separate viral vectors for co-transduction of the light emitter and the light sensor to allow for adjustment of the ratios of the different components if needed.\nAAV transduction\n\t\nInject the target organ of the experimental animal with viral vectors of the light emitter, light sensor, and reporter analogous to the concentration ratios used for the in vitro transfections (Table 3).\nReturn the animals to their home cages for at least 2 weeks to allow maximal expression of all the components.\n\t\tNOTE: If the target organ is inside the body and protected from ambient light, the animals can be housed under normal light conditions.\nBioluminescence activation in vivo\nPrepare the luciferase substrate (luciferin).\n\t\t\nTake out a vial of water-soluble CTZ from the -80 °C freezer and let it warm to room temperature. Keep it protected from light.\nPer 500 µg vial, add 250 µL of sterile water, using either a syringe or by opening the vial and adding water with a pipette, then putting the rubber stopper back on the glass vial.\nIncubate the reconstituted glass vial in a 55 °C water bath for a few minutes to completely dissolve the powder.\nTransfer the solution into a black microcentrifuge tube. Rinse the walls of the glass vial to retrieve all CTZ.",
    "Remove the amount of solution needed for the day. Store the remaining solution at 4 °C for use the next day. Do not freeze!\nCarry out the same steps (2.3.1.1.-2.3.1.5) for a vial of vehicle.\nBioluminescence light stimulation\n\t\t\nRemove the volume of luciferin/vehicle needed for the size of the animal and application route chosen (Table 4).\nInject the animals with luciferin or vehicle. Repeat the bioluminescence light stimulation as per the experimental design. For example, if activation of a recombinase is desired during a specific behavioral paradigm, inject the animals just before the behavioral testing. If phasic transcription of a molecule is the goal, inject the animals repeatedly over days.\nCollect data from the bioluminescence-stimulated animals as designed."
