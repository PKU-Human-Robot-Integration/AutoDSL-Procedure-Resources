    "The institutional review boards of both Thomas Jefferson University and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania approved this protocol. The protocol is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Investigational New Drug approval (IND # 124,465 to F. Forsberg) for this protocol. GE Healthcare (Oslo, Norway) provided the UCA used in this research (Sonazoid; Table 1). Sonazoid is not approved by the FDA for any clinical applications in the United Sates, which is why an IND was necessary. Other UCAs with FDA approval1 can be used off-label at the discretion of the treating physician if deemed potentially clinically useful.\nNOTE: The full protocol and statistical analysis plan are available at https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02489045. Trial registration number: NCT # 02489045.\n1. Subject preparation\nReview the subject’s known drug allergies or intolerances in particular any known allergy to the UCA being used.\nExclude subjects with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions or who are generally medically unstable.\nPut the subject on a stretcher in the supine position.\nPlace an 18 - 22 gauge cannula in a vein in the subject’s right or left arm for the UCA infusion.\nMake sure emergency services (e.g., a crash cart) will be available within the hospital in case of any acute adverse reactions.\n\tNOTE: UCAs are very safe with serious anaphylactoid-type reactions reported at a rate of less than 0.01%.20\n2. UCA preparation (Specific to Sonazoid)\nPrepare three (3) vials with 48 µL of microbubbles (6 mL) for each subject by resuspending according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The UCA is supplied as a dry powder within 10 mL sealed vials. The headspace of the vials contains perfluorobutane.\n\t\nPerforate the stopper of the UCA vial with a chemospike.",
    "Remove the protective cap from the syringe port of the chemospike and add 2 mL of sterile water.\nWith the syringe remaining attached to the chemospike, immediately shake the product for 1 minute to ensure a homogeneous product.\nWithdraw the product into the syringe and re-inject the product back into the vial again. This is to avoid dilution of the product due to the dead-space volume in the chemospike.\nRemove the syringe from the syringe port and reattach the protective cap. The concentration of the reconstituted UCA is 8 µL microbubbles/mL.\nRepeat the reconstitution procedure for the other 2 vials.\nUse saline (0.9% NaCl solution) to fill up the connecting tubes before being connected to a 3-way stopcock. The stopcock will then be connected to the extension tubing leading to the cannula.\nDraw all three (3) vials of suspended UCA into a 10 mL syringe, and place it in a syringe pump at the same level or below the patient, and connect directly to the stopcock.\nAfter the initial ultrasound imaging and after the stopcock has been opened, infuse the NaCl solution at a rate of 120 mL/hour, and co-infuse Sonazoid at a rate of 0.024 µL per kg body weight per minute (suspension infusion rate of 0.18 mL/kg/hour).\n\tNOTE: This infusion rate was selected based on our group’s previous experiences with Sonazoid infusion in portal hypertension subjects undergoing SHAPE13,14,21. The exact resuspension procedure and infusion method will vary depending on the UCA used.\n3. Initial ultrasound imaging\nPower up an ultrasound scanner (e.g., Logiq E10, version R2) and select the C1-6-D curvilinear probe.",
    "Select an abdominal preset on the ultrasound scanner and use a curvi-linear array (typically with a 1-6 or 2-8 MHz bandwidth) to acquire grayscale images of both the portal and a hepatic vein in the same imaging plane and at similar depths (Figure 1). This is generally best achieved via a subcostal approach.\nOptimize the images based on Good Clinical Practice and take care to select the hepatic vein region away from the inferior vena cava to avoid the influence of retrograde flow.\n4. SHI and SHAPE imaging\nActivate the SHI contrast imaging mode in dual display mode (i.e., running real-time B-mode and SHI simultaneously) using the Subharmonic Contrast touch panel button and activate Contrast mode. Then select SUBH-AM on the rotary control.\n\t\nPerform SHI at a transmit frequency of 2.5 MHz and obtain the received signals at 1.25 MHz.\nUse pulse-shaping to maximize the generation of subharmonic microbubble signals, such as a Gaussian windowed binomial filtered square wave with Sonazoid,21 but this is scanner and UCA dependent.17\n\t\tNOTE: The choice of imaging frequency and pulse shape may not be available to end-users.\nConfirm the patency of the portal and the hepatic vein as well as the presence of microbubbles, which can take up to 1-2 minutes from the start of the infusion.\nActivate the SHAPE automated optimization code to optimize SHAPE by compensating for varying depth and attenuation.22,23 Select TIC Analysis on the touch panel followed by F6 and then the k button.\nThe SHAPE optimization algorithm will acquire subharmonic data for every acoustic output level. Once data acquisition is complete, position an ROI on the portal vein in the contrast sample window (top left on the TIC Analysis screen).",
    "Plot the average subharmonic data within the ROI as a function of acoustic output and fit a logistic curve to the data. Select the inflection point of this curve (or rather the peak in the derivative curve shown underneath) as the optimized power, as this has been shown to be the point of greatest SHAPE sensitivity.22,23 One such set of curves is shown in Figure 2.\nAdjust the acoustic output power to the value identified in step 4.4.1, which will ensure the maximum change in subharmonic amplitudes a function of ambient pressure (i.e., maximizing the sensitivity of SHAPE).\nAcquire subharmonic data from the microbubbles (i.e., SHAPE) in 5-15 s segments during the infusion of the UCA suspension (Figure 3).\n5. SHAPE data processing\nOnce the optimized SHI cine-loop has been acquired (step 5.6) select “TIC Analysis” on the touch panel.\n\t\nMake sure “Motion Tracking” is activated on the touch panel, which adjusts the ROI position for each frame to compensate for any breathing or other motion.\nMake sure dB is selected as the unit for the Y-axis on the traces in the analysis window.\nIn the contrast sample window (top left on the screen) select identical ROIs (elliptical regions are default) within the hepatic and portal veins. In the analysis window (to the right) the subharmonic signal (in dB) within each vessel is averaged over all the frames in a 0.5 MHz bandwidth around 1.25 MHz.",
    "Calculate the final SHAPE gradient (in dB) as the difference in the mean subharmonic signal between the hepatic and the portal vein ROIs. Based on current studies, the optimal operating point for identifying CSPH is -0.11 dB and the linear regression equation is HVPG = 0.81 x SHAPE + 9.43.14 It is important to note that this cutoff and equation are both scanner and UCA dependent.\nSubscription Required.
