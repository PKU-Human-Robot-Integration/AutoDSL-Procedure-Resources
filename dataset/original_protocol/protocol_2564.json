    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSection 1 - Extra tissue fixation\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThe following steps are needed to stabilize and prevent detachment of tissue from the slide during pre-treatments (i.e., during hydrogen peroxide). This step is particularly required for tissue that is ‘weak’ as a result of prolonged post-mortem storage, or tissue from aged donors with extensive cell loss derived from an advanced neurodegenerative state.\nNote: tissue fixation could be performed a few days in advance, although it is highly recommended to perform it on the same day of the experiment.\nCritical: all steps and washes in section 1 are performed with the glass slides laying on a horizontal surface. Submerging the tissue section and using coplin jars or other vertical containers in these early steps may increase tissue detachment.\nPlace the slides horizontally on a flat surface and let them thaw for 1–2 min on the bench until most of the moisture has evaporated from the tissue.\nCritical: It is essential to not let the tissue over-dry, as this may cause artifacts. The precise timing for the moisture to evaporate will vary depending on the size of the section. Gently tilting the glass slide to visually inspect the tissue from an angle may help to determine the amount of water/ice still present on the tissue surface.\nAdd a thin layer of 10% NBF directly on the tissue and incubate for 60 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Use sufficient NBF to cover the entire section, approximately 300 μL per 2 × 2 cm sections.",
    "Remove NBF by gently tilting each slide on a paper tissue, then wash by gently adding a generous amount of PBS directly to the glass with a pipette, while still placed on a flat surface. Remove PBS by gently tilting each slide on a paper tissue and repeat washes every 2 min for three times.\nNote: Dispose of the paper tissue containing NBF safely as it contains formaldehyde (toxic).\nCritical: Do not let the sections dry during washes.\nDehydrate in freshly prepared 70% ethanol for 3 min before moving into 100% ethanol for 3 min.\nPause point 1 (optional): Store the slides in 100% ethanol at −20°C for up to 1 week. Prolonged storage may degrade the RNA.\nBake at 60°C for 30 min.\nPause point 2 (optional): After baking, leave slides at 20°C–25°C for 18–24 h, protected from dust.\nNote: If continuing the protocol on the same day, leave the oven switched on at 60°C after baking.\nSection 2 - Tissue pre-treatment and probe incubation\nTiming: 3.5 h\nTissue pre-treatment is a variation of the original supplier protocol. Different tissue quality/fixation may require further optimization (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nBefore starting section 2:\n  Switch on dry oven to 60°C.\n  Turn on the HybEz oven at 40°C. Place humidifying paper in the tray and wet with distilled water. Warm the tray for at least 20 min before use.\n  Equilibrate protease and BaseScope probes at 20°C–25°C for at least 30 min before use.\n  Place two heat-resistant coplin jars in the steamer: one containing 100 mL distilled water and one containing 100 mL of 1× target retrieval reagent. Switch on and pre-heat to 90°C–99°C.",
    "Note: Since the protocol is very time sensitive, use jars with a separate removable slide rack, so that all sections are placed in/removed from the liquid at the same time. We suggest the EasyDip™ Slide Staining System (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nCritical: Steamer will be needed during steps 8 and 9. Make sure temperature reaches at least 90°C before submerging the slides. It is very important that the steamer does not boil dry, but it is also recommended to avoid opening the lid of the steamer or adding cold water during the process, as the antigen retrieval reagent is very sensitive to temperature changes. We suggest testing in advance the duration of the water contained in the tank and the temperature of the steamer for the length of the procedure.\nArrange the slides horizontally in the plastic rack provided with the HybEz oven. Add the appropriate number of drops of Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) directly on the dry tissue and incubate for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nSuggestion: H2O2 (step 6) and proteases (step 14) do not easily spread and show very high surface tension. To facilitate the distribution of the liquid on the tissue, gently use the side of the tip to spread the drop.\nCritical: do not touch the tissue with the tip.\nAlternatives: It is also possible to place a small square of parafilm on the drop to facilitate spreading. However, we noticed a reduction in the final signal from the probe when using parafilm to spread the pre-treatment reagents, suggesting a reduction in the efficacy of the reagents.\nPlace the rack in distilled water and move it gently 3–5 times. Repeat once, replacing with fresh water.\nCritical: Do not let the slides dry during washes.",
    "Move all the slides into a vertical rack, then place it quickly in the coplin jar with distilled water at 90°C (inside the steamer) for 10 s to acclimatize.\nQuickly move slides into the coplin jar with 1× target retrieval reagent at 90°C and keep covered for 15 min.\nCritical: Move slides in the steamer quickly and keep the steamer’s lid open as little as possible, to prevent drastic changes in temperature.\nRemove slides from the steamer and transfer to a container with distilled water at 20°C–25°C for 10 s to acclimatize.\nWash slides in fresh 100% ethanol for 3 min, then repeat once.\nDry slides in the dry oven at 60°C for 20 min.\nPause point 3 (optional alternative): Dry for 18–24 h at 20°C–25°C, protected from dust.\nUsing a hydrophobic barrier pen, draw a barrier 2–4 times around each section and allow it to dry completely at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Do not write on the tissue, as the wax will prevent any stain to develop in the marked area.\nCritical: Make sure the tissue is completely dry before proceeding to step 14.\nPlace slides in the plastic rack, then insert the rack into the aluminium tray (rack and tray are supplied with the HybEz oven). Apply the correct number of drops of protease IV directly on the dry tissue and incubate in the HybEz oven at 40°C for 30 min.\nAfter the incubation, remove the plastic rack with the slides from the oven tray, and quickly put the empty tray back into the oven to prevent cooling.\nWash the slides in distilled water for 2 min and remove excess liquid by gently shaking the tray/slides. Repeat once.\nCritical: Do not let the slides dry during washes.",
    "Place the rack back in the warm oven tray. Add the correct number of drops of the appropriate BaseScope probe. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 2 h at 40°C.\nWash once with 1× wash buffer for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and gently shake to remove the excess liquid.\nPause point 4 (optional, recommended): Prepare 100 mL 5× SSC buffer by pipetting 25 mL of the 20× solution in 75 mL distilled water. Place the slides in 5× SSC at 20°C–25°C for 18–24 h.\nSection 3 - Amplification and detection\nTiming: 5.5–6 h\nAmplification and detection are the core part of the protocol and have not been modified to ensure reproducibility and high quality.\nCritical: The timing of the steps in this section must be carefully monitored. A small variation may greatly affect the reproducibility of the protocol.\nNote: please refer to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for comparison of the following steps with the older version of the BaseScope™ Assay.\nBefore starting section 3:\n  Place the 8 bottles of the amplification reagents (AMP 1–8) at 20°C–25°C 30 min before use.\n  Turn on the HybEz oven at 40°C. Place humidifying paper in the tray and wet with distilled water. Warm the tray for at least 20 min before use.\n  Switch on dry oven to 60°C.\nWash with 1× wash buffer for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and gently shake to remove the excess liquid. All washes from now on will be performed in 1× wash buffer until otherwise stated.\nNote: If slides were kept in SSC buffer, repeat the wash twice.\nCritical: Do not let the slides dry during washes.\nPlace the rack back in the warm oven tray. Add the correct number of drops of the AMP1 solution. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 30 min at 40°C.",
    "Put the empty tray back into the oven. Wash twice for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and remove excess liquid.\nPlace the rack back in the warm oven tray. Add the correct number of drops of the AMP2 solution. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 30 min at 40°C.\nPut the empty tray back into the oven. Wash twice for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and remove excess liquid.\nPlace the rack back in the warm oven tray. Add the correct number of drops of the AMP3 solution. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 15 min at 40°C.\nPut the empty tray back into the oven. Wash twice for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and remove excess liquid.\nPlace the rack back in the warm oven tray. Add the correct number of drops of the AMP4 solution. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 30 min at 40°C.\nPut the empty tray back into the oven. Wash twice for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and remove excess liquid.\nPlace the rack back in the warm oven tray. Add the correct number of drops of the AMP5 solution. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 30 min at 40°C.\nPut the empty tray back into the oven. Wash twice for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and remove excess liquid.\nPlace the rack back in the warm oven tray. Add the correct number of drops of the AMP6 solution. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 15 min at 40°C.\nNote: Do not insert the empty tray back in the oven for the rest of the procedure.\nWash twice for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and remove excess liquid.\nAdd the correct number of drops of the AMP7 solution. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Note: Stain intensity can be improved by increasing AMP7 incubation for up to 45 min.\nWash twice for 2 min at 20°C–25°C and remove excess liquid.\nAdd the correct number of drops of the AMP8 solution. Incubate in the HybEz oven for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDuring washes, spin down the Fast RED-B tube, then dilute 1:60 to Fast RED-A. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for reference; prepare slightly in excess to account for pipetting errors. Mix well and shield from light.\nCritical: Use Fast RED-A-B mix within 5 min of its preparation.\nShake the rack to remove excess liquid and place it back inside the tray. Pipette the correspondent volume of the Fast RED mixture, close the lid of the oven tray (supplied) and incubate for 10 min at 20°C–25°C, shielded from light.\nCritical: It is very important that the incubation with Fast RED incubation time is precisely 10 min. Variations in the timing will impact the reproducibility of the experiment.\nNote: During optimization, it is possible to check the intensity of the stain using the microscope while it is developing.\nCritical: From this point forward, any contact with alcoholic solutions will completely erase the Fast RED stain.\nQuickly place sections in a glass jar with tap water. Rinse again with fresh tap water.\nAlternatives: Since the Fast RED dye is also fluorescent with red wavelength (555), after this step, the protocol can be multiplexed with immunofluorescence and kept in the dark, as long as the additional protocol does not require ethanol or other alcohol-based solutions (refer to supplier’s protocol for more information). In our hands, multiplexing BaseScope with green fluorophore-conjugated antibodies worked on fixed cell monolayers (cell culture), but we did not test this on tissue sections. For information about performing BaseScope in cell cultures, refer to supplier’s protocol.",
    "Place the slides on a thick paper tissue and use a Pasteur pipette to add some drops of 50% Haematoxylin. Incubate at 20°C–25°C for 1–2 min, until sections turn purple.\nNote: Timing may vary according to the thickness/quality of the tissue. It is recommended to test it in advance. Do not overstain.\nRemove haematoxylin by gently tilting each slide on the paper tissue before submerging the slides in tap water for 2 min. Repeat washes 2–3 times, until the water is clear.\nDry slides completely in a 60°C dry oven for 45 min.\nPause point 5 (optional alternative): Leave slides to dry for 18–24 h at 20°C–25°C, protected from dust.\nWhen the slides have dried, place them horizontally on a flat surface. Add 1–2 drop of VectaMount directly onto the tissue and place a coverslip. Avoid trapping bubbles and allow to air dry.\nNote: Gently drop the mounting media directly onto the tissue from a close distance to prevent tissue damage. If air bubbles form, gently aspirate them using a 10 μL pipette. Perform this step carefully and avoid touching the tissue.\nCritical: To seal the coverslip onto the glass and prevent mounting media leakage, place a few drops of clear nail polish at the edge of each coverslip.\nNote: Better quality images are obtained if imaging is performed when mounting media has dried. We recommend imaging the slides the next day for highest quality.\nNote: The chromogenic stain from the BaseScope assay is highly stable and can be imaged several months after the end of the procedure. However, if multiplexed with immunofluorescence the signal is less stable; please refer to supplier’s protocol for more information.\nSection 4 - Image acquisition\nTiming: variable\nThe stained tissues can be imaged using any brightfield microscope with scanning function.",
    "Suggestion: In our experiments we used the Axio Scan Z1 (Zeiss) system with a Plan-Apochromat 40×/0.95 KorrM27 objective. The system uses a Hitachi HV-F202SCL camera that acquires 10,000–100,000 different tiles (pictures) and automatically merges them in a single file (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A), using an 85% JpgXr compression (24bit depth).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2198-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Expected outcomes\n(A–C) A scanned hippocampal tissue section in its entirety (A) (approximately 1.7cm × 1.5cm) stained with haematoxylin and PPIB (not visible at this magnification). The image is comprised of “tiles” that have been separately acquired then merged together - giving the tissue a “scattering”-looking border. Each image was acquired at 400× magnification and merged so that it can be magnified on the software without losing resolution. The wrinkles on the tissue are present in all the sections we analysed for this study and are likely caused by prolonged tissue storage at −80°C. When zooming in on unfolded tissue, the tissue appears densely stained with the positive housekeeper PPIB (B), with most of the stain localised in the perinuclear area (black arrowheads), while only sparce signal is visible in the white matter (red arrowheads). Lastly, blood vessels and capillaries (C, brown arrowheads) appear as oval-like shaped holes surrounded by aggregates of nuclei."
