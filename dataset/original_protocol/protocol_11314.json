    "All the procedures involving blood samples from patients were performed upon signed informed consent of the participants. Procedures were run according to protocols EKNZ BASEC 2016-00067 and EK 321/10, approved by the ethical and institutional review board (Ethics Committee northwest/central Switzerland [EKNZ]), and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nAll the procedures concerning animals were performed in compliance with institutional and cantonal guidelines (approved mouse protocol #2781, Cantonal Veterinary Office of Basel-City).\n1. Patient sample preparation\nBefore starting, ensure to work with aseptic solutions and materials to maintain sterility during the entire procedure.\nWithdraw 7.5 mL of peripheral blood from a breast cancer patient into a 10 mL EDTA blood collection tube.\nIncubate the blood-containing tubes for a short time period (up to 1 h) at room temperature (RT) on a rocking shaker at 40 oscillation per minute (osc/min).\nEnrich for single CTCs and CTC clusters using a CTC isolation method of choice21,22,23,25. Release CTCs in a 1x DPBS solution.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the chosen CTC-enrichment technology, remaining white blood cells and red blood cells might be present. Adjust the releasing pressure in order to preserve the CTC cluster structures.\nProceed immediately to the next step in section 3.\n2. Mouse sample preparation\nBefore starting, prepare a 1 mL insulin syringe with a 25G needle, 5 mM EDTA filtered solution, and 2 mL EDTA blood collection tubes.\nEnsure to work with aseptic solutions and materials to maintain sterility during the entire procedure.\nPre-wash the syringe with 5 mM EDTA solution.\nLoad the syringe with 100 μL of 5 mM EDTA and remove bubbles.\nEuthanize the mouse using 80% CO2 / 20% O2 gas inhalation and proceed immediately to the next step.",
    "NOTE: An alternative to CO2 inhalation method is the isoflurane anesthesia (3 vol% isoflurane and oxygen (carrier gas) at the flow rate of 600 mL/min) followed by cervical dislocation, or overdosing injection of ketamine/xylazine solution. Specific euthanasia method may vary depending on approved mouse protocol.\nConfirm the animal's death by the absence of breathing activity, missing corneal reflex, and urination without external stimuli.\nPerform a cardiac puncture by carefully introducing the needle of the EDTA pre-loaded syringe with a 30° angle into the thorax from the sternum towards the heart.\n\tNOTE: For inexperienced experimenters, it is recommended to open the chest cavity first, before performing the cardiac puncture, to better visualize the heart.\nRetrieve up to 1 mL of blood. Without releasing the plunger, pull out the syringe from the animal chest, safely remove the needle, open the lid of the 2 mL EDTA blood collection tube and dispense the blood directly inside. Close the lid and invert the tube 10x.\nIncubate the blood-containing tubes for a short time period (up to 1 h) at RT on a rocking shaker at 40 osc/min.\n\tCAUTION: The needle must be disposed of in sharp-safe biological hazard disposal.\n\tNOTE: Multiple punctures are possible to increase the total blood volume. Use separate syringes pre-loaded with EDTA for different withdraws to avoid aspirating clotted blood present in the previous needle.\nEnrich for single CTCs and CTC clusters using CTCs isolation method of choice21,22,23,25. Release CTCs in a 1x DPBS solution.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the chosen CTC-enrichment technology, remaining white blood cells and red blood cells, might be present. Adjust the releasing pressure in order to preserve the CTC cluster structures.\nProceed immediately to the next step in section 3.\n\tNOTE: For all the following procedures, ensure that unfixed and freshly isolated blood is used.",
    "3. CTCs live immunostaining\nCentrifuge CTC-enriched cell suspension at 72 x g for 4 min.\n\tNOTE: 72 x g corresponds to 800 rpm if the rotor has a diameter of 100 mm. Convert the g-force number according to the rotor.\nGently resuspend the pellet in 1% BSA solution in 1x DPBS and add 2 μg/mL of anti-human EpCAM-AF488 antibody and 1 μg/mL of anti-human CD45-BV605 antibody or 2 μg/mL anti-mouse CD45-BV605 antibody in a total volume of 500 μL.\n\tNOTE: For breast cancer patient-derived CTCs, anti-human EGFR-FITC, and anti-human HER2-AF488 can be added additionally to anti-EpCAM and anti-CD45. This allows to better identify the CTCs that are expressing lower EpCAM levels.\nIncubate for 30 min at RT and protect from light.\nWash CTCs suspension using 1 mL of 1% BSA in 1x DPBS solution and centrifugation at 72 x g for 4 min. Repeat this wash twice.\nResuspend stained cells in 2 mL of 1% BSA in 1x DPBS solution and transfer the total volume in 1 well of a 6-wells ultra-low attachment plate.\nIncubate the plate for 10-15 min at 4 °C protected from light to allow sedimentation of CTCs and residual blood cells.\n4. Micromanipulation of CTCs and single-cell picking\nNOTE: Before starting, be aware that the micromanipulator requires up to 45 min for complete set up. Once set up, the procedure for CTC identification and micromanipulation requires up to 2 minutes per cell (or cluster).\nMake sure to terminate the CTC picking procedure within 2 h from the end of the staining.\nStart up the micromanipulator software and switch on the micromanipulator. Connect the micromanipulator to the computer and initialize the robotic arm as well as the microscope stage by pressing the Connect button followed by Int device.",
    "Close the protecting cabinet after every manipulation of the machine to be able to maneuver it through the computer.\nClean the surfaces from dust and spills by spraying ethanol and wiping the internal surfaces of the cabinet. A clean environment will ensure the sterility of the process.\nInstall a new glass capillary on the robotic arm. For the single-cell picking, use 20-30 μm capillary while 30-50 μm is preferable for CTC cluster picking.\nRemove all bubbles present in the tubing by dispensing or aspirating the system oil.\n\tCAUTION: Glass capillary is sharp and fragile. Handle with caution.\nFill the sterilization tank 1 with 70% ethanol, the sterilization tank 2 with sterile nuclease-free H2O and the buffer tank with sterile 1x DPBS.\n\tCAUTION: Do not close the lids of the tanks, since during the next steps the capillary will need to freely access the tanks.\nSterilize the capillary twice with 70% ethanol.\nReplace the sterilization tank 1 with tank 2 and wash capillary in H2O at least three times using the sterilization function.\nUsing the micromanipulator software, start a new experiment and choose the type of picking experiment between the automatic and the manual selection modes.\n\tNOTE: Choose the type of experiment based on the end point of the manipulation. Manual mode enables maneuvering of a robotic arm after the capillary enters the cell suspension. This step is necessary for dissociation of CTC clusters into individual cells. It is possible to change the type of picking during the experiment.\nConfigure the deck tray specifying the position of the sterilization tank (liquid 1), buffer tank (liquid 2) and depositing tray (target 1 or 2). Target 1 allows to deposit into plates, target 2 allows to deposit into PCR tubes or PCR plates.",
    "Set the temperature of the liquid tanks and depositing tray chosen to 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The picking process can be time consuming. Cooling of the liquid tanks and depositing tray is therefore advised\nPosition the ultra-low attachment plate containing the released CTCs solution under the microscope inside the micromanipulator cabinet. Remove the lid from the plate and close the cabinet. Keep the plate at RT for the rest of the set up and during the picking procedure.\nManually select the microscope objective for picking (10-20x) and the exposure time of all the necessary channels (Brightfield, FITC, and TRITC channels).\nSelect show well navigator from the toolbar to visualize and select the type of pickup plate (6-well plate).\n\tNOTE: Any plate or well format can be installed by the manufacturer only.\nCalibrate pickup position in the middle of the well containing the CTCs solution, but with no cells in the center of the field of view. Calibration performed at the edges of the wells can result in faulty calibration due to uneven well surface.\nUse the sensor to gently touch the bottom of the plate with the capillary (speed 0.01 mm/step and 1% speed).\nSet the pickup position 0.05 mm above the bottom of the plate.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to open and remove lids of plates and tanks before proceeding. The capillary may break on a closed or unremoved lid.\n\tCAUTION: If the capillary breaks upon contact with lids, broken glass may be found in the surroundings or in the solutions.\nSelect cell type and picking parameters. Picking parameter can be set-up and loaded at each startup. For single-cell picking, select the manual mode.\nWithin the Picking preparation settings:\n\t\nSet the airgap volume between the system oil and the sample to 1 μL",
    "Set the buffer liquid volume to take up before each picking to 0.5 μL.\n\t\tNOTE: Buffer liquid volume is adjusted to the total maximum pickup volume. Small volumes do not affect the picking or depositing efficiency.\nSet the speed of aspiration of the buffer liquid between 1-6%.\nSet the waiting time after aspiration of the buffer to 1 s.\n\t\tNOTE: The option of taking up the buffer from target well instead of buffer liquid tank can be used if necessary\nSet to reuse glass capillaries and no sterilization between picks.\n\t\tNOTE: Sterilization between picks can be performed manually if required. Perform multiple washes in H2O between picks or two sterilization in ethanol followed by multiple washes in H2O.\nWithin the Picking settings:\n\t\nChange the camera settings while picking and exposure time under the microscope to 7,500 μs.\nSelect fixed picking height.\n\t\tNOTE: Tool sensor or autofocus could be chosen instead. However, small imperfections of the plate can disturb the sensitivity of the sensor or the autofocus which may cause an impact of the capillary into the plate.\nSet aspiration speed of the capillary entering the source plate to 7-15%.\nEnable the interactive picking.\nSet the aspiration volume in μL to 0-0.05.\nSet the speed of aspiration to 5%.\nSet the waiting time after aspiration in s to 0-1.\nSet the number of picked particles per capillary to 1.\nSet no multiple picking at the same position and no scraping functions. Aspiration properties must be set according to the type of experiment (e.g., automatic picking mode may require bigger aspiration volumes).\nWithin the Deposit settings:\n\tNOTE: Depositing settings strictly depend on the depositing plate/tube.\n\t\nFor single-cell picking, define the speed of capillary entering the target plate to 25%.\nSet the speed of dispensing to 6%.",
    "Set the waiting time after dispensing in s to 0.\nSet the amount of airgap dispensed in the target well to 100%.\nSet no rinse after depositing.\n\t\tNOTE: Sterilization can be performed after depositing to clean the capillary.\nSet maximum amount of particles deposit per well and the number of targets to distribute particles to 1.\nCalibrate deposit height on position A1 of target 1 for plates or on position A1 of target 2 for tubes. Place an open tube or plate without lid for the calibration and use the sensor to gently touch the depositing well (speed 0.01 mm/step and 1% speed). Set the depositing height 1 mm above the bottom of the plate.\nWithin the Settings:\n\t\nSet the stage speed during picking to 5-10%.\n\t\tNOTE: Fast movements of the plate may result in movement of cells in suspension and difficulties in multiple cell picking due to mispositioning.\nSet sterilization properties using rinsing volume to 1 μL, 3 rinsing loops and 2 s of waiting time per sterilization round.\nApply the changes before closing.\nNavigate the glass capillary using the joystick in the well and place it on top of the single cell of interest. Choose picking up positions at a safe distance from the well border (1 mm) as the capillary may break on the edge of the well.\nManually add particles using the button of the joystick or manually selecting from the menu.\nSelect pick activated particles to start the picking.",
    "The capillary will stop 0.05 mm above the bottom of the plate and on top of the selected pickup position because of the interactive picking (manual mode). Gently turn the knob of the joystick clockwise to manually aspirate the particle and the surrounding DPBS solution. The maximum volume is not fixed when the manual mode is on. However, the maximum volume allowed in the syringe will be 25 μL.\nDispense the excess DPBS solution or unwanted particles by gently turning the knob of the joystick counterclockwise. Too much dispensing will release the airgap of the syringe forming bubbles in your solution and compromising visibility.\nPress next to proceed with the deposit.\nObserve the capillary entering the depositing PCR tube or PCR plate, releasing the volume and going back to starting position with an empty capillary.\n\tNOTE: If there is volume left in the capillary, proceed with sterilization. Then, re-check the settings, oil level, and oil height before performing a new picking.\nProceed from point 26 of section 4 to start a new single-cell picking. During picking it might be necessary to replace the capillary. After the installation, a new calibration of the pickup position must be performed. At the end of the calibration, select the function Apply calibrated changes in Z-height to deposit height in order to correct the deposit height to the new capillary calibration and to skip the deposit height calibration (section 4.16).\n\tNOTE: The steps described in section 1-4 apply to most of the CTCs enrichment and isolation methods. Here we report optional steps for specific CTCs analysis.\n5. Single-cell picking and seeding for survival and proliferation analysis\nEnsure to work with aseptic solutions and materials to maintain sterility during the entire procedure.",
    "Prepare a 384 well plate to contain the picked single CTCs for culturing with 20 μL CTC culturing media31. Ensure that CTCs are seeded in small volumes of the medium after manipulation (e.g., 10-20 μL for a 384 well plate).\nSpin down the solution to the bottom of the plate. Place 384 well plate into the target 1 and keep at 4 °C.\nPerform all the steps with the micromanipulator described in the section 4 to set up the micromanipulator and start a new picking.\n\tNOTE: Multiple selections of the single cells will cause the formation of a picking list. The particles will be picked and deposited one by one in consecutive wells (see section 4.22.6). However, the interactive mode (manual mode) will stop the capillary right before the aspiration, therefore allowing the experimenter to control this critical step and to ensure successful picking. Fast movements of the plate may result in the movement of the cells in suspension and difficulties in multiple cell picking.\nAfter depositing, repeat step 4 to start a new picking.\nAt the end of the picking, centrifuge the plate at 72 x g for 4 min to ensure that the picked cells are placed at the bottom of the well.\n6.CTC cluster breaking and single-cell picking for sequencing\nEnsure to work with aseptic solutions and materials to maintain the sterility during the whole procedure.\nPrepare single PCR tubes or a PCR plate that will contain the single cells of the broken cluster with the total 2.5 μL cell lysing solution comprising 1 U/μL of RNA inhibitor.\nQuickly spin down the solution to the bottom of the tube. Place the depositing containers into the target 2 and keep at 4 °C.",
    "Perform all the steps described in section 4 with the micromanipulator to set up the micromanipulator.\nStart a new picking. The capillary will stop 0.05 mm above the bottom of the plate and on top of the selected CTC cluster because of the interactive picking (manual mode).\nGently turn the knob of the joystick clockwise to manually aspirate the cluster and the surrounding DPBS solution. Dispense the aspirated volume including CTC cluster by gently turning the knob of the joystick counterclockwise.\nRepeat the aspiration/disposal of the CTC cluster described in step 6 until the single cells forming the cluster will break apart.\n\tNOTE: Too much dispensing will release the airgap of the syringe forming bubbles in your solution and compromising visibility.\nFollow by eye the position of the single cells. Manually add the particles using the button of the joystick or manually selecting from the menu.\n\tNOTE: Multiple selections of the single cells will cause the formation of a picking list. The particles will be picked and deposited one by one in consecutive PCR tubes/wells (see section 4.22.6). However, the interactive mode (manual mode) will stop the capillary right before the aspiration, therefore, allowing the experimenter to control this critical step and to ensure successful picking.\nSelect pick activated particles to start the picking.\n\tNOTE: The amount of cell lysing solution will allow a single cell to completely lyse. However, long exposure of the lysed content to the lysing agent may degrade DNA or mRNA. Therefore, proceed immediately to the next step.\nImmediately close the tube containing the picked single cell and transfer on dry ice for snap freezing.\nQuickly spin the tube and check for the absence of drops on the sides of the tube to ensure a proper lyse of the deposited cell.",
    "Repeat from step 5 to start a new picking.\n\tNOTE: Microscope stage will move from one added particle to another at the speed described in section 4.23.1. CTCs suspension in the ultra-low attachment plate may move, causing faulty picking due to mispositioning.\n7. CTCs isolation for mouse injection\nEnsure to work with aseptic solutions and materials to maintain sterility during the entire procedure.\nPrepare a PCR tube with 5 μL of sterile 1x DPBS.\nQuickly spin down the solution to the bottom of the tube. Place the depositing containers into the target 2 and keep at 4 °C.\nWithin the deposit settings apply a change at the step 4.22.6: Set the maximum amount of particles deposit per well to 1,000 and the number of targets to distribute particles to 1. This step ensures that the picked cells will be deposited in the same tube for 1,000 times.\nUse only the interactive mode (manual mode) to precisely control the picking step and keep the picked solution free from contaminant cells.\n\tNOTE: If more than 1,000 cells are needed, increase the number of targets to distribute particles to avoid loss of sample after 1,000 cells.\nContinue the steps of section 4.26 to start a new picking. Repeat step 6 to perform multiple pickings. Annotate the number of cells collected at each picking in order to keep track of the number of cells available for the mouse injection.\nAt the end of the picking, centrifuge the tube at 72 x g for 4 min (see section 3.1.) and aspirate supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the collected CTCs into the buffer of choice, suitable for mouse injection. For mammary fat pad injection, resuspend the collected CTCs in a 1 to 1 ratio of 1x DPBS and reconstituted basement membrane extracted, and keep at 4 °C until the injection. For intravenous injection, resuspend the collected CTCs in DPBS only.\n\tNOTE: Volume of the solution strictly depends on the number of CTCs that will be injected. It is advised to inject in the mammary fat pad or intravenously a maximum of 100 μL per mouse. When calculating the volume, always consider the dead volume for the manipulation and syringe loading.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
