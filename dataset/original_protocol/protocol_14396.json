    "Placentae were collected from the Labor and Delivery Unit at University Hospital under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon, with informed consent from the patients.\n1. Collection of Placental Tissue\nPreparation\n\tNOTE: All equipment that encounters tissue must be sterile.\n\t\nSterilize the dissecting equipment by autoclaving for 60 min at 121 °C.\nUse personal protective equipment (PPE): lab coats/gowns/scrubs, gloves, and mask with a face shield or goggles.\nTurn on water bath and set to 37 °C.\nWarm two 50 mL conical tubes, each containing 25 mL of complete media (Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, Table 3) in a 37 °C water bath.\nWith informed patient consent, obtain a placenta immediately following delivery by cesarean section.\nBecome familiar with the placenta. The umbilical cord is inserted on the fetal side (chorionic plate) and blood vessels can be seen radiating out from the umbilical cord insertion site. The opposite side is the maternal side, or basal plate. It includes the decidua and structures that contain vessel trees, called cotyledons.\nSampling of Villous Tissue\n\tNOTE: Villous tissue should be sampled from the placenta as soon as possible following delivery, preferably in 30 min or less.\n\t\nWith the chorionic plate facing upwards, excise 2-3 full-thickness sections (approximately 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm in size) 2-3 cm in from the periphery of the placenta at random, using forceps and scissors (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid parts of the placenta that appear abnormal (i.e. white calcifications).\nTrim away the chorionic and basal plates and any large blood vessels.\nPlace the resulting villous tissue (Figure 1B, approximately 80 - 120 g total) in warm complete media and begin trophoblast isolation within 30 min of sampling.",
    "NOTE: Some downstream assays and applications are affected by the length of latency period between delivery, sampling, and trophoblast isolation. It is best to keep these periods as short as possible and consistent between isolations.\nUsing the techniques described in steps 1.2.1 - 1.2.2, sample 5 random 1 cm x 1 cm sections of villous tissue from across the placenta (including the center).\nCut each 1 cm x 1 cm villous tissue sample into 4-5 smaller pieces (approximately 30 mg each), place in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes, and flash freeze in liquid N2. Store at -80 °C for use in later analyses.\n2. Isolation of Trophoblasts from Villous Tissue\nPreparation\n\tNOTE: Use sterile equipment and perform procedures involving cells in a laminar flow hood.\n\t\nThaw four frozen density gradients (Table 1, see table of the essential supplies, reagents, and equipment, supplementary material) at 4 °C the night before the placenta arrives.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, density gradients can be made on the day of the isolation.\nTurn on centrifuge and set to 20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: All centrifugation steps are at maximum acceleration and deceleration unless specified otherwise.\nPrepare 1x HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with Ca+2 and Mg+2 (Table 3).\nWarm trypsin to 37 °C.\nDilute DNase to approximately 2720 kilounits/mL in sterile supplemented HBSS.\nWarm 50 mL of Newborn Calf Serum (NCS) to 37 °C.\nWarm complete media to 37 °C.\nWarm freezing media (90% FBS, 10% DMSO, Table 3) to 37 °C.\nCAUTION: DMSO is toxic and must be handled with gloves.\nPrepare digestion buffer (Table 2 and 3) by mixing 308 mL of supplemented HBSS, 50 mL of Trypsin (3751.7 BAEE units/mL), and 0.5 mL of DNase (379.4 kilounits/mL) in a sterile bottle.\n\t\tNOTE: The approximate time required to isolate cells from villous tissue is 7 h.",
    "Processing the Villous Tissue\nRinse each piece of villous tissue in a 50 mL conical tube filled with room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Repeat and replace the PBS as necessary until the excess blood is removed (PBS rinse will be light red or pink when the tissue is thoroughly rinsed).\nPlace the villous tissue in a sterile Petri dish and remove as many blood vessels as possible by gently scraping off the soft villous tissue from the vessels using a microscope slide.\nFinely mince the resulting villous tissue using scissors.\nVillous Tissue Digestion and Crude Isolation of Trophoblasts\nTransfer the minced villous tissue to a sterile bottle with digestion solution according to the calculated volumes based on the specific activity of trypsin and DNase (165 mL, Table 2).\nAfter 35 min of incubation in a 37 °C water bath with shaking at 70 revolutions per minute (rpm), tilt the digestion bottle on its side and allow the undigested pieces of tissue to settle at the bottom of the bottle. Carefully draw up the supernatant with a serological pipette, avoiding the settled tissue.\nDispense the supernatant through a 100 µm cell strainer equally between 50 mL conical tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: To save time, it is advisable to begin the second digestion by adding digestion solution (110 mL, Table 2) to the remaining settled tissue and resuming incubation as described in step 2.3.2.\nGently layer 3 - 5 mL of NCS underneath the strained supernatant by slowly dispensing from a serological pipette at the bottom of the tube. A meniscus between the strained supernatant (containing trophoblasts) and NCS should be visible (Figure 2A).",
    "Centrifuge the supernatants over NCS at 1,250 x g for 15 min at 20 °C. The resulting pellet will include red blood cells in the lower-most layer followed by a white layer containing the trophoblast cells (Figure 2B).\nRepeat steps 2.3.2 - 2.3.5 for each of the second and third digestions (adding 110 mL and 83.5 m, respectively, of digestion solution to the bottle of tissue, Table 2).\nOnce all supernatants have been centrifuged, resuspend each pellet in 5 mL of warm complete media, and then pool the suspensions together.\nSplit the cell suspension equally between two 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuge at 1,250 x g for 15 min at 20 °C.\nGently remove the supernatant and resuspend each of the cell pellets in 6 mL of warm complete media.\nDensity Centrifugation\nDivide the cell suspension equally between four density gradients (3 mL each) by slowly and carefully layering the cell suspension on the top of the density gradients with a transfer pipet.\nCentrifuge the density gradients at 1,250 x g for 20 min at 20 °C with minimum acceleration and deceleration. This should produce distinguishable bands of sedimented cells (Table 4).\nSlowly and carefully remove the top layers of density gradient media (DGM) until the opaque band(s) containing trophoblast cells (between 35 - 50% DGM) is reached (Table 4).\nTransfer the trophoblast bands into two 50 mL conical tubes and fill with warm complete media.\nGently invert the tubes 3 - 6 times to mix and centrifuge at 1,250 x g for 15 min at 20 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 5 mL of warm complete media. Combine the cell suspensions and count viable cells using a hemocytometer and Trypan blue (or preferred cell counting method).\nCounting Cells with a Hemocytometer",
    "Mix the cell suspension by pipetting up and down with a serological pipet or by gently inverting the tube several times.\nCombine equal parts of cell suspension and Trypan blue (i.e. 20 µL each) in a separate tube and mix gently.\nIncubate for 1 - 2 min at room temperature.\nGently dispense 15 - 20 µL of the cell-Trypan blue mixture in between the coverslip and the hemocytometer and allow the cells to diffuse across the grid by capillary action.\nCount viable cells (dead cells will be stained deep blue) in each of the four 4 x 4 quadrants with a tally counter. Employ a system of counting to ensure cells are not counted more than once (i.e. do not count cells that touch the bottom or left boundaries).\n\t\tNOTE: Each 4 x 4 quadrant should contain between 50 - 150 cells. Too few or too many cells can lead to an over or underestimation of cell number.\nAverage the total cell counts from each of the 4 x 4 quadrants, multiply by 104, and then multiply by the dilution factor (cell suspension to Trypan blue) to calculate number of cells per mL.\nMultiply the number of cells per mL by the total volume of cell suspension to calculate the total cell yield.\n\t\tNOTE: Approximately 100 million cells are expected from isolations starting with 80-120 g of villous tissue.\nPlating Cells\nPlate 3 million cells/well (3.3 x 105 cells per cm2) in a 6-well plate (2 mL of suspension per well) and gently rock back and forth and side to side to evenly distribute the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Trophoblasts require tissue culture treated plates to adhere properly. A monolayer of cells is required to promote syncytialization.",
    "Leave the plated cells in the laminar flow hood for approximately 30 min to allow cells to evenly distribute, settle, and begin to adhere to the bottom of the wells before placing in the incubator.\nCulture cells for up to 72 h (with daily media changes) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\n\t\tNOTE: Examine the trophoblasts under a microscope at 10 - 20x every 24 h of culture. Trophoblasts do not proliferate and cannot be passaged. Over the course of 72 h of culture, the round individual trophoblasts fuse to form a syncytium (Figure 3A and B).\nFreezing Cells\nPellet unused cells by centrifugation at 1,250 x g for 10 min at 20 °C.\nAspirate as much media as possible from the pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in freezing media (Table 3).\nFreeze the aliquots at -80 °C in a freezing container filled with 100% isopropanol. Transfer the frozen aliquots to liquid N2 the following day for long term storage.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells can be cultured after freezing.\nThawing Cells\nRemove an aliquot of frozen cells and thaw in a 37 °C water bath while swirling. Remove the aliquot from the water bath just before it has fully thawed to a liquid.\nImmediately transfer the thawed cells to a 15-ml conical tube. Beginning slowing at first, add 10 mL of complete media with intermittent mixing.\nInvert tube several times to mix.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 10 min at 20 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 - 5 mL of warm complete media.\nCount the cells and plate as previously described.\n3. Treatment of Primary Trophoblasts with TNFα, Collection of Cell Lysates, and Western Blotting\nPreparation\nWarm complete media to 37 °C.",
    "Make a 10 µg/mL stock of TNFα in complete media and store at -20 °C until ready for use.\nMake a 1 µg/mL working stock of TNFα in complete media when ready to treat the cells. Serial dilute the TNFα working stock to 104 pg/mL, 103 pg/mL, 500 pg/mL, 250 pg/mL, and 125 pg/mL in complete media.\n\t\tNOTE: The TNFα concentration of 104pg/mL is moderately cytotoxic. Adjustment of the TNFα concentrations tested will depend on the specifics of the desired downstream applications.\nTreating Cells with TNFα\nAfter 24 h of culture, aspirate the culture media from the cells and replace with 2 mL of TNFα supplemented medias per well on 6-well plates (at least two wells per treatment and vehicle control).\nAfter 24 h of TNFα-exposure (48 h of culture), replace the TNFα supplemented medias with complete media.\nHarvesting Cells and Total Protein\nAfter 72 h of culture (24 h past removal of TNFα), aspirate media, gently rinse cells with room temperature PBS, and add 80 µL of ice cold Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay Buffer (RIPA) containing freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Table 3) directly to each well.\nRemove the cells from the plate with a cell scraper. Transfer the cells to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, pooling wells within treatment groups.\nLyse the cells by vortexing the tubes on high for at least three intervals of 15 s.\nIncubate the cells at 4 °C with rocking for 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, after step 3.3.3., the cells can be incubated on ice for 15 min with intermittent agitation by flicking the tube, vortexing, or pipetting up and down.\nRepeat step 3.3.3.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 10,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet cellular debris.",
    "Transfer the supernatant (containing cellular protein) to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and store at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be stopped here and resumed at a later time. It is advisable to make several aliquots of cellular protein samples to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nDetermine total protein concentration by a preferred method, such as a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, see table of the essential supplies, reagents, and equipment, supplementary material).\nSDS-PAGE and Western Blotting for Rubicon or Protein of Interest\n\tNOTE: Follow Western blotting protocols according to manufacturer's instructions using a preferred laboratory system.\n\t\nLoad between 20-40 µg of total protein in sample buffer (Table 3) per well on a 12% acrylamide gel. Separate proteins by SDS-PAGE in running buffer (Table 3).\nWet-transfer the proteins from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane according to manufacturer's instructions in transfer buffer (Table 3).\nIncubate the membrane in 5% milk powder in Tris-Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST, Table 3) for at least 1 h at room temperature with rocking.\nIncubate the membrane in a Rubicon primary antibody (see table of the essential supplies, reagents, and equipment, supplementary material) at 1:500 in 1% milk powder in TBST overnight at 4 °C with rocking.\nGently wash the membrane 3 x 5 min in TBST and 1 x 5 min in TBS at room temperature with rocking.\nIncubate the membrane in 1:2000 - 1:5000 secondary antibody (HRP-linked or preferred visible conjugate, see table of the essential supplies, reagents, and equipment, supplementary material) in 5% milk powder in TBST for at least 1 h at room temperature with rocking.\nRepeat the washing procedure outlined in step 3.4.5 and visualize the blot with an appropriate visualization (i.e. chemiluminescent) substrate on an imaging system.",
    "Repeat the washing procedure outlined in step 3.4.5 and probe the membrane for β-actin or a preferred loading control according to manufacturer's instructions.\nOn preferred image analysis software, analyze the expression of Rubicon by manual quantification of absorbance (band intensities), subtraction of background absorbance, and normalization to the corresponding loading control band intensities. Perform statistical analyses as appropriate to test for statistically significant changes in protein levels.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
