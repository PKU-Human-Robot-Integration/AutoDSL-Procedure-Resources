    "1. Packing the Long-length Anion-exchange (LAX) Capillary Column\n(Note: Although the LAX column can be in-home packed as we describe in this protocol, LAX columns are also commercially available, see Table of Materials and Reagents for further details).\nSuspend 50 mg of weak anion exchange packing material in 3.5 mL of packing buffer (Table 1) to prepare the slurry.\nAssemble the end of the capillary column (50 cm length - 200 µm internal diameter (ID) tubing) using a female-to-female fitting, a ferule and a female nut. Place a screen 1/16\" OD of 1 micron pore size inside the female-to-female fitting. (Note: The screen used here must have smaller pore size than the particle size of the packing material to prevent leakage of the material from the column).\nPack the capillary with the slurry using a pressure pump operated at 4,500 psi. (Note: Pack the column until the packing material is visible at the entry of the column).\nAssemble the other end of the capillary column as described in point 1.2.\n2. Sample Preparation\nThis protocol outlines the application of LERLIC-MS/MS to analyze human brain tissues as model proteome. (Note: In case to use other tissues or proteomic samples, the sample preparation procedures should be adapted.)\nTissue homogenization:\n\ta. Wash brain tissues (50 to 100 mg) with 1x phosphate buffer solution for five minutes thrice.\n\tb. Homogenize the tissue at 1:1:2.5 tissue/metallic beads/SDC homogenization buffer (Table 2) ratio (w/w/v) for 5 min at 4 °C in safe-lock tubes at maximum intensity using a tissue homogenizer. (Note: SDC homogenization buffer may include protease inhibitors as previously indicated in3)\n\tc. Centrifuge the tissue homogenate, obtained from the previous step, at 10,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min and collect the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube.",
    "d. Repeat steps b-c for the remaining pellets and combine the supernatants as many times as necessary until no pellet is observed. (Note: If you have to repeat the steps b-c more than two times, move the sample and the beads to a new safe-lock tube to prevent the loss of sample during the centrifugation step).\n\te. Quantify the protein concentration of the obtained homogenates by Bicinchoninic Acid assay (BCA)12.\nSodium deoxycholate (SDC)-assisted in-solution tryptic digestion13 of brain homogenates.\n\ta. Add a final concentration of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (using the stock solution indicated in Solution 5 of Table 3) to the obtained homogenate to initiate the reduction of protein disulfide bonds.\n\tb. Incubate the homogenate during 30 min in a bath pre-set at 60 °C.\n\tc. Add to the homogenate a final concentration of 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) using the stock solution indicated in Solution 7 of Table 4.\n\td. Incubate the homogenate containing IAA at room temperature in the dark during 45 min.\n\te. Dilute the brain homogenate two-folds using dilution buffer (Solution 6 of Table 3).\n\tf. Incubate the sample for a second reduction step during 30 min at 37 °C.\n\tg. Add sequencing-grade-modified trypsin dissolved in Solution 2 of Table 2 at protein-to-enzyme ratio 1:50 (w/w).\n\th. Digest the homogenate with trypsin by overnight incubation at 30 °C.\n\ti. Quench the enzymatic digestion on the next day by adding 0.5% final concentration of formic acid (FA). (Note: Addition of FA will cause precipitation of the SDC salts under acidic conditions.)\n\tj. Gently vortex the samples containing SDC precipitates.\n\tk. Pellet down the SDC salts by centrifuging the samples at 12,000 × g, 4 °C during 10 min.",
    "l. Collect the supernatant and transfer the liquid to a clean new tube. (Note: Take care during the pipetting of this step to do not re-suspend and/or collect salts from the SDC pellet.)\n\tm. Re-dissolve the SDC pellet in SDC re-dissolving buffer (Table 5) under vigorous vortexing for 1 min.\n\tn. Repeat steps j-l twice to recover precipitated peptides and combine the supernatants. (Note: See Serra et al. 201613 for further details on the SDC-assisted in-solution tryptic digestion protocol adapted here.)\nDesalting of tryptic digested samples.\n\ta. Perform desalting of digested samples using a 1g C-18 cartridge. (Note: The use of a big volume cartridge (5 mL) independently of the amount of protein obtained guarantees proper cleaning of remaining SDC salts in the samples prior to LC-MS/MS injection.)\n\tb. Perform conditioning of the 1g C-18 cartridge with 5 mL of acetonitrile (ACN).\n\tc. Pass 5 mL of clean-up buffer (Table 6) by the conditioned 1g C-18 cartridge to remove any remaining organic solvent.\n\td. Load the sample to the 1g C-18 cartridge.\n\te. Perform 3 - 5 clean-up steps to the sample in the 1g C-18 column using 5 mL of clean-up buffer each step.\n\tf. Elute the desalted peptides from the 1g C-18 cartridge using 5 mL of elution buffer (Table 7).\n\tg. Dry the eluted peptides in a vacuum concentrator.\n\tc. Reconstitute the dried sample in a final volume of 200 µL of elution buffer. (Note: Use vigorous and long (> 10 min) vortexing followed by subsequent sonication in a sonication bath during 30 min to completely re-suspend the dried peptides in injection buffer.)\n\td. Adjust the injection volume of the sample for LERLIC-MS/MS to analyze between 1 to 3 µg of protein.\n3. One-dimension LERLIC-MS/MS Separation\nLiquid chromatography conditions:\n\tMobile phases:",
    "A: 0.1% FA in water (Table 8).\n\tB: 0.1% FA in ACN (Table 9)\n\tFlow rate: 0.4 µL/min\n\tColumn: LAX capillary column (50 cm length - 200 µm ID)\n\ta. Use the following 1200 min-gradient: 95% B for 40 min, 95 − 85% B for 434 min, 85 − 70% B for 522 min, 70 − 35% B for 124 min, 35 − 3% B for 45 min, isocratic at 3% B for 5 min, 3 – 95% B over 7 min and kept isocratic at 95% B for 23 min.\n\tb. Perform separation of peptides using the LAX capillary as indicated in Serra & Gallart-Palau et al.3 using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography.\nMass spectrometer configuration:\n\ta. Configure the scan event details to perform data acquisition alternating between full Fourier transform-mass spectrometry (FT-MS) and Fourier transform-tandem mass spectrometry (FT-MS/MS) with the following parameters:\n\ta.1. Data acquisition mode: positive\n\ta.2 FT-MS parameters:\n\tMass range: 350 − 2,000 m/z\n\tResolution: 60,000\n\tMicroscans: 1 per spectrum\n\tAutomatic gain control: 1 × 106\n\ta.3 FT-MS/MS parameters:\n\tFragmentation mode: High-energy collisional dissociation (HCD)\n\ta.4 Mass range: 150 − 2,000 m/z\n\ta.5 Resolution: 30,000\n\ta.6 Top N ions: 10\n\tMicroscans: 1 per spectrum\n\tCharge state: > 2+\n\tIsolation width: 2 Da\n\ta.7 Automatic gain control: 1 × 106\n\tb. Perform mass spectrometry detection of peptides as indicated in3 using an orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source working at 1.5 kV.\n4. Data Analysis\nPerform protein database search to the LERLIC-MS/MS obtained data using the following parameters using a specific proteomic software: (Note: See3 for further details.)\n\ta. Ion tolerance: 10 ppm\n\tb. Fragment ion tolerance: 0.05 Da\n\tc. False Discovery Rate (FDR): 1%\n\td. Database: UniProt Human database\n\te. Fixed modifications: Carbamydomethylation at Cys",
    "f. Variable modifications (if required by the software): Oxidation (Met), Deamidation (Asn and Gln).\nConfident characterization and quantification of isomeric deamidated products in LERLIC-MS/MS data:\n\ta. Export database search results from LERLIC-MS/MS to an spreedsheet software for analysis.\n\tb. Find and extract the whole list of deamidated peptides and their non-deamidated counterparts.\n\tc. Using the list of the obtained peptides as reference, extract the ion chromatograms (XICs) of these peptides using an appropiate software at 5 ppm of mass tolerance. (Note: See3 for further details on the software used for the extraction of XICs.)\n\td. Visually inspect the obtained XICs to identify the separated double-peak elution of the isomeric products as indicated3. (Note: Isomeric products of those peptides identified at MS/MS level can be easily found guided by the presence of two different retention times in the database search result.)\n\te. Relative quantification of the isomeric products from each deamidated site/peptide has to be performed based on the peak area of each identified isomer in the obtained XICs.\nSubscription Required.
