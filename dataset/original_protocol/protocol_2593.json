    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBlocking ChIP Next Gen Seq Sepharose\nTiming: Day 0, 0.5–1 h\nPrepare BSA: reconstitute 250 mg pure BSA powder with 12.5 mL of cold molecular biology grade water (DNase-, RNase-, Protease- free) water, mix by vortexing and inverting to make a 20 mg/mL solution. Make 10 μL aliquots and freeze at −20°C.\nAdd 200 μL molecular biology grade water and 10 μL of 20 mg/mL BSA to each vial of Staph-seq. Incubate on rotating platform at 4°C for 16 h and store at 4°C until step 19.\nNote: For best results, we recommend preparing the Staph-seq on Day 0, the evening before you start the ChIP. If time constrained, the incubation may be shorted to 3 h at 4°C or 2 h at 23°C. The blocked Staph-seq can be used up to 2 weeks.\nHarvesting and cross-linking cells\nTiming: day 1, 3 h\nMouse embryonic stem cells are harvested in single cell suspension and cross-linked.\nHarvesting cultured ESCs.\nV6.5 mouse ESCs are plated without feeder in serum-free N2B27 complete media. For serum-free 2i culture, ESCs were cultured without feeders or serum in N2B27 medium (1 × neurobasal medium, 1 × DMEM/F12, 0.5 × N2, 0.5 × B27,1 × β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 μM non-essential amino acid, 0.033% BSA, 3 μM CHIRON99021, 1 μM PD03).\nUse ∼1–2 × 107 ESCs for every Staph-seq immunoprecipitation.\nAdd 5 mL Accutase per 15-cm plate of ESCs and incubate at 37°C for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL 1 × PBS to dilute and stop Accutase activity, followed by counting cell number.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 23°C and resuspend in 1 × PBS volume of PBS to a concentration of 1 × 106 ESCs/mL.\nCross-linking ESCs.\nDilute fresh 37% formaldehyde to 2%.",
    "Add equal volume of freshly prepared 2% formaldehyde to the cell suspension in a 50 mL conical tube. Swirl briefly.\nIncubate by gentle mixing on a nutator for 10 min at 23°C.\nQuench formaldehyde with 1/20 volume of 2.5 M glycine for 5 min at 23°C by gentle mixing on a nutator.\nCentrifuge at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nWash cells by resuspending the pellet with glycine in PBS twice (50 mL 1 × PBS with 1 mL 2.5 M glycine). At the second wash, keep cells in glycine for 1 min.\nCentrifuge at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C. Discard the formaldehyde and glycine mix following the hazardous chemical waste disposal guideline.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 20 mL 1 × PBS (Cells may stick to the tube or pipette at this stage).\nAdd 20 mL 1 × PBS to wash off any carry over cells stuck to the side of tube or pipette.\nCentrifuge at 700 g for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat h-j once more, total of two times.\nPause point: Cells can be used immediately or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. However, freezing cells at this stage inevitably results in rupture of some nuclei and partial loss of chromatin.\nCritical: Efficient cross-linking is achieved by mixing 2% formaldehyde with single-cell ESC suspension to get a 1% final concentration of formaldehyde. Make sure ESCs colonies are separated into single-cell suspension by pipetting gently for at least 10 times with minimal bubbles while pipetting.\nChromatin solubilization and shearing\nTiming: day 1, 3 h",
    "Cells are lysed by sonication to obtain sheared chromatin. The efficiency of sonication varies with cell type, quantity, volume of sonication and specifics of the sonicator used. We suggest optimizing sonication conditions for each experimental situation before processing large quantities of cells.\nAdd protease inhibitor to ChIP lysis buffer before use.\nResuspend each cell pellet of ∼1–2 × 107 cells in 300 μL cold ChIP lysis buffer. Incubate on platform rocker at 4°C for 10 min.\nOptional: Save a 50 μL aliquot as a pre-sonication control.\nTransfer lysates to Bioruptor Pico microtubes and sonicate with Bioruptor with the setting of 30 s on, 30 s off for 16 cycles. The lysate should become as clear as water with no visible debris after sonication. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCritical: When loading samples into the tube holder of Bioruptor, make sure all slots are filled with microtubes containing equal volume of samples or water for balance.\nTransfer sonicated lysates to Eppendorf 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes and centrifuge at 20,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nNote: The Bioruptor Pico microtubes may crack at maximum speed of centrifuging.\nCarefully transfer supernatant (sonicated chromatin) to a new tube and store at 4°C. Save the cell debris pellet in case of under sonication to recombine with the supernatant and repeat sonication until desired results are achieved.\nCritical: From here on, keep lysates on ice.",
    "Note: Wear hearing protection while working with sonicator. For larger quantity of cells with sample volume between 0.5 mL and 2 mL, we prefer to use Misonix sonicator with 15 mL tubes. Use a clamp to secure the tube with sonicator probe centered and 0.5–1 cm above the bottom of the tube. The sonicator probe should never be in contact with the sides of the tube. Immerse tube in the ice-water bath during sonication. Avoid foaming, which indicates poor fragmentation of DNA. If large amount of foam is observed during sonication, stop, and readjust the sonicator probe. Foam can be removed by centrifuging at 20,000 g followed by resuspension of samples.\nDetermining the degree of sonication\nThis step quickly estimates the chromatin size to determine if further sonication is needed.\nTake chromatin equivalent of approximately 1 × 106 cells (15 μL out of the 300 μL sonicated lysate).\nAdd ChIP elution buffer up to 100 μL and add 12 μL 5 M NaCl.\nBoil samples at 95°C for 15 min to reverse crosslink.\nAfter samples are cooled down, add 1 μL RNase A and incubate at 37°C for 20 min to remove RNA.\nPurify DNA using a PCR purification kit and elute in 25 μL water.\nAdd 10 × orange G loading dye to 5–10 μL of purified DNA and run on a 2% agarose gel. The desired rage of DNA size is 200–600 bp (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2252-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gel image of sonicated DNA\nElectropherogram of a 2% agarose gel showing sonication of genomic DNA from mouse ESCs. The sheared chromatin shows desired distribution ranged between 200 and 600 bp.\nIf the majority of sheared chromatin is over 600 bp, recombine the cell debris pellet with the sonicated chromatin to continue sonication to achieve the desired size fragments.",
    "Pause point: Sonicated chromatin can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for use the next day.\nChromatin immunoprecipitation\nTiming: day 1 or 2 (15 min and 16 h incubation)\nThis step captures and pulls down the antibody/chromatin complex.\nSave 50 μL sonicated chromatin in −20°C as input DNA.\nAdd antibody specific to the protein of interest to capture the protein/chromatin complex. Use ∼5–10 μg antibody for each immunoprecipitation. Incubate on platform rocker at 4°C for 16 h.\nThe next day, add 5 μL prepared Staph-seq per 1 μg of primary antibody used to each chromatin-antibody sample.\nIncubate on the rotating platform for 15 min at 23°C.\nCentrifuge at 17,000 g for 5 min at 23°C, remove supernatant.\nCritical: The incubation time in step 20 should not exceed 15 min at 23°C.\nWash, elution, and crosslink reversal\nTiming: day 2 or 3 (8 h or up to 16 h)\nWash the Staph-seq pellet with 800 μL ChIP wash buffer for 30 s.\nCentrifuge at 17,000 g at 4°C for 5 min, discard supernatant.\nRepeat step 22 and 23.\nWash once using 1 mL 1 × TE with 50 mM NaCl.\nTransfer to a new tube, centrifuge at 17,000 g at 4°C for 5 min, discard supernatant.\nNote: During washes, a lot of DNA may stick to the walls of the tube. This step will help remove the carryover of the DNA into the elution process and reduce noise in result.\nCritical: Return to 23°C. From this point on, barrier filter tips are used to avoid DNA contamination from pipettes.\nThaw the input samples from the previous day and bring to 150 μL with ChIP elution buffer.\nAdd 150 μL 1× TE to the input sample.",
    "Add 150 μL elution buffer and 150 μL 1× TE to Staph-seq pellet.\nAdd 4 μL of 10 mg/mL RNase (final concentration 0.2 μg/μL) to every sample. Incubate at 37°C on a thermomixer at 950 rpm for 2 h.\nAdd 2 μL 20 mg/mL Protease K to each sample.\nIncubate for 2 h at 55°C for protease-K digestion.\nIncubate at 65°C for at least 6 h to reverse crosslinking.\nNote: Step 33 can be done in the PCR machine (6 h at 65°C and then a 4°C hold).\nPause point: The material can be frozen at −20°C and stored for up to 16 h. Alternatively, the crosslink reversal can be extended for up to 16 h. A crosslink reversal longer than 16 h may result in increased noise.\nCritical: Use Eppendorf Safe-Lock tubes to avoid drying out samples.\nAdd 300 μL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to each sample, and vortex or shake by hand thoroughly for approximately 20 s.\nCentrifuge at 23°C for 5 min at 16,000 g.\nWhile centrifuging, prepare new microfuge tube containing 12 μL 5 M NaCl and 2 μL 20 mg/mL glycogen.\nCarefully remove the upper aqueous phase containing DNA and transfer the layer to the tubes prepared in step 36. Make sure not to carry over any phenol during pipetting.\nPrecipitate DNA by adding 750 μL cold 100% Ethanol.\nPause point: Samples can be frozen at −20°C at this point.\nMix well and incubate at −80°C for 30 min to 1 h.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nCritical: The precipitated DNA appears as a white flake loosely attached to the bottom of tubes. Avoid decanting or using vacuum to aspirate the supernatant. Instead, use pipette to carefully remove the supernatant.",
    "Centrifuge at 20,000 g for another 5 min at 4°C and remove supernatant.\nAdd 800 μL 70% ethanol. Vortex to mix and centrifuge at 20,000 g for 5 min at 23°C.\nRemove supernatant. Spin briefly at 23°C and remove remaining liquid with a pipette.\nPosition tubes upside down to air dry at 23°C until the pellets are dry but still have moist appearance.\nCritical: Avoid over drying samples by incubating at 37°C which may lead to difficulty in dissolving them in water.\nAdd 55 μL molecular grade water to each sample, mix well and allow DNA to dissolve for at least 10 min at 23°C.\nPause point: Material can be frozen at −80°C and stored indefinitely.\nQuantification of ChIP results with qPCR\nTiming: day 3 (2–4 h)\nAssess ChIP results by qPCR before proceeding to Library preparation and Sequencing. Use at least 2 positive and 1 negative target sites to verify enrichment at positive sites compared to negative sites. For example, two E2F6 target genes, Zcwpw1 and Rab8a were used as the positive controls and at least one “gene desert” loci from an intronic locus is used as the negative control (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). ChIP signals obtained from the positive gene loci are compared with the negative gene loci, and further normalized by ChIP signals from input samples because background signal levels vary among primer sets.\nDilute ChIP DNA by adding 17 μL Nuclease-free (NF) water to 5 μL ChIP DNA.\nSet up PCR reaction master mix as table below for each reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2252_5.csv\nAliquot the samples with qPCR master mix reaction in a qPCR plate, make sure not to create and bubbles. Seal with clear qPCR thermal seal and spin briefly to remove the bubbles if any.\nSet up the qPCR and run the below PCR cycling conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2252_6.csv",
    "Pre-library preparation size selection\nTiming: day 4 (2 h) (for step 50)\nThis section describes how to prepare the Staph-Seq ChIP DNA for library preparation. The ChIP DNA is first quantified then a pre-amplification size selection step is added to eliminate potential Staph A DNA contamination using the Pippin Prep instrument.\nQuantify the precipitated Staph-Seq ChIP DNA with Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit for DNA using their standard protocol.\nNote: Add 1 μL of ChIP DNA into prepared sample tubes containing 199 μL Qubit master mix according to the user guide.\nUse results from sample quantification to determine how much of the ChIP DNA material to use for size selection. The Pippin Prep size selection cassette has an input range from low nanograms to 5 μg of DNA for a selection range of 100–600 bp. For best results, we recommend using at least 100 ng DNA. In this protocol, we used 300 ng to 1,000 ng for the ChIP DNA samples.\nSize select the quantified Staph-Seq ChIP DNA using internal standards.\nBring loading/marker mix (Marker L) to room temperature.\nBring the DNA samples up to 30 μL in 1× TE buffer.\nCombine each DNA sample with 10 μL of loading/marker mix (Marker L) to make a total sample volume of 40 μL.\nSetup size selection parameters on the Pippin Prep for a selection range of 150–350 bp before loading.\nLoad samples according to manufacturer’s instructions and press start.\nRetrieve samples from the elution wells after 70 min.\nNote: The Sample starting masses for pre-library preparation size selection may need optimization on a case-by-case basis. We use Sage Science Pippin Prep instrument for DNA size selection using their standard protocol (Pippin Prep 2% Agarose Gel Cassette (CDF-2010, 2% DF Marker L) quick guide for more information: https://sagescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Quick-Guide-CDF2010-marker-L-460058-RevA-9_7_21.pdf[href=https://sagescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Quick-Guide-CDF2010-marker-L-460058-RevA-9_7_21.pdf]).",
    "Pause point: Material can be frozen at −20°C and stored indefinitely, no additional purification is required for future use.\nLibrary preparation & sequencing\nTiming: day 4 (6–8 h)\nThis section describes how to prepare a Staph-Seq library using KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit (Roche) and Bioo Scientific NEXTflex DNA Barcodes (Perkin Elmer). The Staph-Seq ChIP DNA was size selection prior to library construction in the previous steps. The size selected ChIP DNA is then prepared into libraries as noted below and size-selected again.\nThis section describes how to prepare a Staph-Seq library using KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit (Roche) and BiooScientific NEXTflex DNA Barcodes (Perkin Elmer). The Staph-Seq ChIP DNA was size selection prior to library construction in the previous step. The size selected ChIP DNA is then prepared into libraries as noted below.\nLibrary preparation.\nPrepare libraries from size selected ChIP DNA according to manufacturer’s instructions for most steps.\nModifications to these instructions are as follows:\nBring size selected ChIP DNA to 50 μL in nuclease free water, up from 40 μL eluted from the Pippin Prep.\nBegin protocol at end repair, followed by remaining steps; a-tailing, adapter ligation and PCR.\nUse Agencourt Ampure XP beads for all bead purification steps.\nAt adapter ligation, use 5 μL of diluted 1:125 NEXTflex DNA barcodes.\nPerform the standard two post-ligation cleanups without size selection.\nPerform library amplification for 15 cycles with standard thermocycling parameters as noted.\nProceed with standard library bead purification and elution.\nPause point: Material can be frozen at −20°C and stored indefinitely.",
    "Note: We use KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit for the library preparation using the manufacturer’s standard protocol in combination with the Scicline G3 liquid handling workstation (Perkin Elmer) Alternative kits and processing methods could be utilized at user’s discretion (see https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/prd_htplibraryprepkapabiosystems.pdf[href=https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/prd_htplibraryprepkapabiosystems.pdf], https://rochesequencingstore.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KAPA-HTP-Library-Preparation-Kit-Technical-Data-Sheet.pdf[href=https://rochesequencingstore.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KAPA-HTP-Library-Preparation-Kit-Technical-Data-Sheet.pdf] and https://www.mediray.co.nz/media/18825/514104-nextflex-dna-barcodes-48.pdf[href=https://www.mediray.co.nz/media/18825/514104-nextflex-dna-barcodes-48.pdf] for more information).\nQuantify post-amplification libraries.\nQuantify stock post PCR libraries using the HS dsDNA Qubit assay as before.\nDilute stock libraries to 10 nM and assay libraries on the Agilent Bioanalyzer HS DNA assay to determine sizing information and determine if adapter dimer contamination is present.\nQuantify diluted 10 nM libraries using the HS Qubit assay to determine concentrations of diluted libraries.\nNormalize and pool libraries for sequencing using 10 nM dilutions and sizing information from the Bioanalyzer.\nUsing the Pippin Prep cassette for an additional round of size selection following instructions from step 52.\nCritical: The second round of size selection does not promote the alignment percentage to the target genome (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), but helps improve the signal-to-noise ratio (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: We recommend size selecting at least 100 ng of stock post PCR library material with a selection range of 200–600 bp using the same Pippin Prep cassette (CDF-2010, Marker L) and the loading instructions from before. Re-quantify post amplification size selected libraries again using the HS dsDNA Qubit assay and the Agilent Bioanalyzer HS DNA assay.\nPool and sequence libraries.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2252-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
