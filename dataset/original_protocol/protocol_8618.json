    "1. Preparation of Larvae\nOne week before recording behavior, set up a cross (minimum of 25 virgins and 5 males). Maintain all crosses and progeny at 25 °C.\n\tNOTE: The temperature of culture conditions can be altered, but the time line described below would need to be adjusted to account for changes in developmental speed.\n5 days before recording, first thing in the morning, place the cross into a collection cage with an agar/juice cap and a dab (0.5-1 ml) of yeast paste in the center of the agar/juice cap.\n\t\nTo make a collection cage, poke holes into a 6 oz. square polyethylene Drosophila bottle.\nTo make agar/juice caps, mix 18 g of agar with 600 ml water in a conical flask. In a separate flask mix 20 g sucrose with 200 ml apple juice. Microwave until solids are dissolved. Combine and stir, allowing mixture to cool to 60 °C. Add 20 ml 10% methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate in 95% ethanol, and stir. Add ~7 ml to the bottom half of a 35 x 10 mm round petri dish. Allow agar/juice to solidify for 1 hr at RT. Store at 4 °C.\nTo make yeast paste, add equal parts by volume dry yeast and water. Store at 4 °C.\nCheck the health of larval collections.\nIn the morning, 4 and 3 days before recording, remove the cap and place a fresh cap on the cage. Change the caps at the same time each day to get a 24 hr collection of eggs and newly hatched larva.\nAfter each cap is removed, examine it to see how many eggs the cross is laying. Expect between 500-2,000 eggs. Adjust the number of adults, if needed.",
    "NOTE: A few eggs should have hatched into larvae, and the newly-hatched larvae will be found away from the yeast paste.\nAge each cap for 24 hr. Re-examine the cap to determine whether larvae are healthy.\n\t\tNOTE: Most eggs should have hatched into larvae, and the larvae should have crawled into the yeast paste. Signs of poor health include a large number of unhatched eggs, dead larval bodies away from the yeast paste, and larvae with significant dark patches in the abdomen, indicating an immune reaction. If larvae are unhealthy, change the cage, make fresh caps/yeast paste, and check the genotype.\nDiscard the old caps.\nCollect larvae for behavioral recordings.\nAt both 2 and 1 day before recording, remove the cap and replace with a fresh cap.\nLabel each removed cap and keep at 25 °C. This will produce a staged series of larvae for behavioral recordings. Larvae from newly-hatched (0-4 hr posthatch) through second instar (24-48 hr posthatch) can be used in the channels. Save caps for recordings on consecutive days.\nDiscard all caps after 48 hr.\nIf needed, repeat steps 1.4.1-1.4.3 for up to 5 additional d. After that fewer fertilized eggs are produced.\n2. Preparation of Channels\nPrepare the linear channel PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane, a silicone elastomer) casting mold (Figure 1A). PDMS casting molds are available from the Heckscher lab upon request.\n\t\nClean the casting mold with isopropyl alcohol. Air dry, dab dry with laboratory wipes, or use canned air.\nPlace the casting mold into a 10 cm Petri dish lid or other container.\nPrepare and pour agarose solution.\nMake a 3% agarose solution in water (3 g in 100 ml) by microwaving until fully dissolved.\nCool to 55 °C, allowing bubbles to rise to surface.",
    "Pour the agarose mixture into the petri dish containing the casting mold so that the mold is just covered. Let agarose set until solidified.\nRemove the agarose channels from the casting mold. Trim the edges of the agarose disc with a razor blade.\n\t\nPut the channels in a 10 cm Petri dish immersed in water. They can be kept at 4 °C for 7 days.\n3. Loading a Larva into a Channel to Record Behavior\nNOTE: If storing channels at 4 °C, allow channels to come to RT before using for behavioral recording.\nUse a clean razor blade to cut a single channel from those prepared in Step 2 (Figure 2A).\nUse a pair of forceps to place the channel grooved-side-up on a glass coverslip (Figure 2B). The size and thickness of the coverslip depends on the specific scope used for imaging.\nUse fine forceps to select a larva from the agar/juice cap prepared in Step 1 and place into the cut channel (Figure 2C).\n\t\nDo not squeeze the larva. Pick it up gently with the tip of the forceps tine. It is also possible to manipulate larva with a paintbrush with a fine point.\n\t\tNOTE: This is important as larvae are very sensitive to touch. If they are not handled with care, nociceptive responses might dominate their behavior during the first few seconds of the experiment.\nWash the larvae by briefly submerging them in water.\nAfter placing the larva onto the cut channel, use the tip of the forceps tine to gently tease the larva into the channel grove.",
    "NOTE: For most applications the width of the larva and the width of the channel should match. The average width of larvae at different stages of development follows: 0 hr posthatch - 140 µm, 24 hr posthatch - 180 µm, 48 hr posthatch - 320 µm, 72 hr posthatch - 500 µm, 96 hr posthatch - 750 µm8. Channels come in the following widths: 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 µm, and all channels are 150 µm deep.\nUse the tip of a forceps tine or paintbrush to adjust the position of the larva within the channel. It can be oriented in any direction: ventral up, ventral down, ventral to one side, depending on what structure is to be imaged.\nUsing forceps, gently flip the channel over such that the larva is now on the cover glass. Place one or two drops of water at the ends of the channel so that it fills with water (Figure 2D).\n\t\nGently lift the sides of the channel to remove any air bubbles.\nAdjust the orientation of the larva. To do so, gently nudge the channel but not the cover glass to roll the larva. If this does not change the orientation, remove the cover glass and adjust larval position. The larva is ready to be imaged.\nImage the channel/coverslip on an inverted microscope. If imaging on an upright microscope, simply invert the channel/coverslip.\n4. Measure Feature of Interest in Behavioral Recording\nFor a structure of interest (e.g., tail, CNS), measure a feature of interest (e.g., fluorescence intensity, location) over time.",
    "NOTE: Structures such as the head and tail can be manually annotated. For example, the head can be identified as containing dark H-shaped mouth hooks, and the tail can be identified as containing posterior tracheal spiricles. This paper focuses on the nerve cord. Use the neuronal GAL4 line elav-GAL4 to drive a UAS-myr-GFP transgene (elav>GFP)9,10 to fluorescently label the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS contains two anterior brain lobes attached to the nerve cord, which extends to the posterior (Figure 3).\nMeasure the pixel intensity of the nerve cord (f(NC)) at each time point (t). Below describes a manual annotation approach, but this step could be automated.\n\t\nIn Fiji (or similar software) in the 'Analyze' menu use the \"Set Measurements ...\" dialogue box to report the mean gray value and slice position.\nManually draw a box in the center of the nerve cord in the first frame of the movie (Figure 3). This step could also be automated with image segmentation and registration algorithms.\nUse the \"Measure\" command in the 'Analyze' menu to report the average pixel intensity in the boxed region of interest. This generates a \"Results\" window.\nIn the next frame, manually reposition the box without resizing by using the arrow keys. Use the \"Measure\" command again. The updated results will be shown in the \"Results\" window. Repeat this step for each frame of interest.\nSave the \"Results\" using the 'Save As...' command from the File menu. The results will be exported as an .xls file.\n5. Analyze the Measurements\nNormalize each f(NC) value to a value between 0 and 1 (z(t)).\nIn spreadsheet (or other program), open the Results.xls file. This file will have two columns representing frame number and average fluorescence intensity.",
    "Make a new column and use the formula z(t) = f(NC[t])-min(f[NC])/max(f[NC])-min(f[NC]) to generate a normalized fluorescence value corresponding to each time point.\nDetermine the stride period for each stride in the recording.\n\tNOTE: A stride cycle is the unit of repetitive whole body motion for forward (and reverse) crawling. By convention a forward stride starts (and ends) with the forward movement of the tail, head, and other internal organs such as the gut or CNS1.\n\t\nManually inspect the behavioral recording and record the initiation times (i) of each stride (i(Stride Cycle[n])).\n\t\tNOTE: In the example below, forward movement of the CNS as the initiation of a stride cycle was used (Figure 3).\nFor each stride calculate the period: Δt(Stride cycle) = i(Stride Cycle [n+1])-i(Stride Cycle [n]).\nCalculate percentage of stride cycle elapsed for each time point of the recording.\nMake an additional column in the spreadsheet file representing time elapsed since the start of a stride cycle (c). Set time since stride initiation to zero at the initiation of each stride (c(Stride Cycle[n]) = 0). Adjust times after initiation accordingly.\nMake an additional column in the spreadsheet file representing percent stride cycle elapsed (% stride cycle). Divide adjusted times by stride period and multiply by 100 to convert to percentage of stride cycle elapsed: % stride cycle = (c(Stride Cycle[n]))/ (Δt(Stride cycle)*100).\n6. Generate Polar Coordinate Plots to Represent Dynamics of Structures of Interest over the Crawl Cycle\nIn MATLAB, use the 'Import Data' dialogue in the Home tab to import the updated Results.xls.\nMake a new array \"Theta\" containing percent stride cycle values (% stride cycle). (\"Theta = Var1\" where Var1 represents % stride cycle).\nMake a new array \"Rho\" contain normalized fluorescence values (z(t)). (\"Rho = Var2\" where Var2 represents z(t)).",
    "Use the 'polarplot' command to make polar coordinate plots with the percent stride cycle as the angle, and the fluorescence as the radius (\"polarplot(Theta, Rho)\").\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
