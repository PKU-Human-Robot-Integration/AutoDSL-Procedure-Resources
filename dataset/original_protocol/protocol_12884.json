    "1. Primer Design\nPrepare primers for 2-step fusion PCR and verification of gene disruption.\n\tNOTE: Table 1 shows the primer sequences used in this protocol. Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of the 2-step fusion PCR method used to generate S. mutans ΔgtfC.\n\t\nDesign primers for the replacement of the target region in the genome with the spectinomycin-resistance gene (spcr)7. This protocol replaces the entire coding region of the gtfC gene with spcr.\nInclude 15 bases complementary to the upper and lower ends of spcr at the 5' regions of up-reverse and down-forward primers, respectively. Similarly, include 15 bases complementary to the lower end of the upstream flanking regions of gtfC and the upper end of the downstream flanking regions of gtfC at the 5' regions of spcr-forward and spcr-reverse primers, respectively (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Sequences of up-reverse, down-forward, spcr-forward, and spcr-reverse primers are automatically determined depending on the site of incorporation of the disruption construct.\nDesign the up-forward and down-reverse primers to comprise >1-kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the gtfC gene, respectively. Set the melting temperature (Tm) of up-forward and down-reverse primers in accordance with the melting temperature of up-reverse and down-forward primers, respectively (Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the following formula to determine Tm: Tm (°C) = 2(*NA + *NT) + 4(*NC + *NG) - 5, where *N represents the number of primer nucleotides with the specified identity (A, T, C, or G).\nDesign nested primers (N_up-forward and N_up-reverse) for the 2nd PCR (Figure 1B).\n\t\tNOTE: Although the outermost primer pair (up-forward and down-reverse) may be used as primers for the 2nd PCR, nested primers (N_up-forward and N_up-reverse) were designed in this protocol. Nested primers are frequently required for the 2nd PCR, as detailed in the Representative Results.",
    "Design primers specific for spcr. The primers are used for colony PCR to screen for gtfC disruption.\nDesign primers for the verification of gtfC disruption.\n\t\tNOTE: The PCR products amplified using these primers straddle the border between gtfC or spcr and upstream or downstream flanking regions of gtfC. The primer sets 'gtfC up-forward and gtfC up-reverse' and 'gtfC down-forward and gtfC down-reverse' are specific for gtfC, and 'gtfC up-forward and spcr2-reverse' and 'spcr2-forward and gtfC down-reverse' are specific for spcr.\n2.

    "Add 1,200 µL of DNA binding buffer (included in the kit) to the filtrate. Transfer 800 µL of the mixture to the spin column (included in the kit) to a 2.0-mL collection tube and centrifuge for 1 min at 10,000 ×g.\nDiscard the flow-through, add 200 µL of pre-wash buffer (included in the kit) to the spin column to wash the column matrix, and centrifuge for 1 min at 10,000 × g. Discard the flow-through, add 500 µL of wash buffer (included in the kit) to the spin column to wash the column matrix, and centrifuge for 1 min at 10,000 × g.\nPlace the spin column into a new 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube and add 100 µL of elution buffer (included in the kit) to the column matrix.\nCentrifuge for 30 s at 10,000 × g to elute the genomic DNA. Estimate the DNA concentration and purity by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nmusing a spectrophotometer and confirm that the A260/A280 ratio is greater than 1.8.\n3. PCR Amplification\nPerform the 1st PCR using the S. mutans WT genome and the synthetic spcr gene as PCR templates (see Table 1). Amplify the upstream flanking region of the gtfC gene, the downstream flanking region of the gtfC gene, and the spcr gene using the three sets of primers described above (Figure 1A), as per Table 2 and Table 3.\n\tNOTE: PCR primers, reagents, and amplification cycles are summarized in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, respectively.\nFractionate each PCR product on a 1% agarose gel and excise the corresponding bands using a gel band cutter.\nPurify each amplified DNA product from the gels using a spin column- and silica membrane-based gel extraction kit.",
    "Transfer the gel slices to a clean microcentrifuge tube and mix with 500 µL of binding buffer (included in the kit). Incubate the mixture at 55 °C for 15 min until the gel slices are completely dissolved.\nPlace the spin column (included in the kit) into a collection tube (included in the kit), load the sample onto the spin column, and centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 × g. Discard the flow-through, add the 600 µL of Wash Buffer (included in the kit) to the Spin Column to wash the silica membrane, and centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 × g.\nDiscard the flow-through and centrifuge for 2 min at 11,000 × g to dry the silica membrane.\nPlace the spin column into a new 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, add 50 µL Elution Buffer (included in the kit), and incubate at room temperature for 2 min.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 11,000 × g to elute the amplified DNA. Estimate the DNA concentration and purity by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nmusing a spectrophotometer and confirm that the A260/A280 ratio is greater than 1.8.\nPerform the 2nd PCR of 2-step fusion PCR using the three approximately equimolar fragments as PCR templates, as per Table 2 and Table 3.\n\tNOTE: These fragments were amplified and spliced using the nested primers 'N_up-forward and N_down-reverse' or the outermost primers 'up-forward and down-reverse' (Figure 1B). PCR primers, reagents, and amplification cycles are summarized in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, respectively.\nLoad one-tenth of the PCR reaction mixture (5 µL) on a 0.8% agarose gel and compare the amplified band size with the expected band size to confirm the generation of the appropriate amplicon (Figure 1C).\nConcentrate the remaining final PCR product by ethanol precipitation without purification.",
    "Add 55 µL of ultra-pure water to the remaining PCR mixture to adjust the total volume to 100 µL.Add a one-tenth volume of 3 M sodium acetate (10 µL), pH 5.2, followed by 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol (250 µL). Mix and freeze for 30 min at -80 °C.\nCentrifuge for 20 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, check for the pellet on the bottom of tube, and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70% ethanol, centrifuge for 5 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and discard the supernatant. Air-dry the pellet for approximately 30 min and dissolve with 10 µL of ultra-pure water.\n4. Competent Cell Preparation and Cell Transformation\nStreak stock S. mutans UA159 onto a BHI agar plate. Incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions.\nPick up a single colony using a sterilized toothpick and inoculate it into 5 mL of BHI broth.

Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of fresh 10% glycerol, dispense 50 µL of the suspension into each 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, and store at -80 °C until just before use.",
    "Mix the 50 µL aliquot of ice-cold competent cells with 5 µL of the disruption construct described above in section 3. Add the mixture to electroporation cuvettes (with a 0.2 cm distance between electrodes). Employ the Staphylococcus aureus mode (1.8 kV, 600 Ω, 10 µF, 1 pulse) of the electroporation apparatus to electroporate.\nSuspend the cells in 500 µL of BHI broth immediately after electroporation and add 50 µL of the suspension to spectinomycin-containing BHI-agar plates.\n\tNOTE: Extra incubation time after electroporation is not required. However, incubation for 1-2 h after electroporation may improve transformation efficiency.\nIncubate the plate for 2-6 days at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions.\n\tNOTE: S. mutans ΔgtfB is constructed as described above. The entire coding region of the gtfB gene is replaced with the erythromycin resistance gene8 in S. mutans ΔgtfB. Each S. mutans strain is cultured in BHI broth at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions.\n5.
