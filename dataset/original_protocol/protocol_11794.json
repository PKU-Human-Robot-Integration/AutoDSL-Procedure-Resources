    "Ovaries were collected from 4 to 8 years old  Holstein dairy cows recovered at the local abattoir (INALCA S.p.A., Ospedaletto Lodigiano, LO, IT 2270M CE, Italy).\n1. Media preparation\nNOTE: All media must be prepared at least four hours before use. Sodium bicarbonate buffered media are incubated at 38.5 °C and 5% CO2 in air, maximum humidity. HEPES-buffered media are maintained at 38.5 °C in thermostatic oven.\n Long in vitro culture of oocytes (L-IVCO) medium\n\t\nPrepare 15 mL of the basic culture medium (M199-B): Supplement M199 with 2 mM glutamine, 0.4% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM cysteamine, 21.3 µg/mL of phenol red, 75 μg/mL of kanamycin and 4% Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; 360 k molecular weight).\nPrepare 3 mL of the holding medium (M199-H): To M199-B add 5 µM cilostamide and pour it in a 35 mm Petri dish.\nPrepare the L-IVCO medium (M199-L): Supplement M199-B with 0.15 μg/mL Zn sulphate, 10-4 IU/mL FSH, 10 ng/mL estradiol, 50 ng/mL testosterone, 50 ng/mL progesterone and 5 µM Cilostamide.\nPlace 200 µL of M199-L medium in each well of the 96 well coated plate. Fill the wells in the four edges of the plate with sterile culture water to compensate for evaporation and to maintain appropriate humidity during culture.\nIncubate the 96 well plate and the M199-H medium in the incubator at 38.5 °C and 5% CO2 in air, maximum humidity.\nDissection medium\n\t\nPrepare the dissection medium (M199-D): Supplement M199 with 0.4% BSA fraction V, 0.164 mM penicillin, 0.048 mM streptomycin, 1790 units/L heparin. M199-D can be prepared in bulk, dispensed in 20 mL aliquots and stored at 4 °C for 6 months. When needed, warm and supplement 1 aliquot.\nPrepare 20 mL of M199-D supplemented with 5 µM cilostamide (M199-D cilostamide).",
    "2. Ovary collection and processing\nNOTE: All procedures are conducted at room temperature (26 °C) unless otherwise indicated.\nRecover the ovaries at the abattoir from cows.\nPlace the ovaries in sterile saline (NaCl, 9 g/L) at 26 – 28 °C added with penicillin 100 U/mL and streptomycin 0.1 mg/mL.\nTransport the organs to the laboratory in warm sterile saline within 4 h.\nWash the ovaries 4x in sterile saline maintained at 26 °C.\nRemove all mid-to-large antral follicles by aspirating all follicles more than 2 mm in diameter using a 18 G needle connected to an aspiration pump with vacuum pressure set at -28 mmHg and place the aspirated ovaries in a beaker with sterile saline at 26 °C.\n\tNOTE: Removal of the content of follicles > 2 mm is a critical step to remove as much as possible the source of fully-grown oocytes that would ‘contaminate’ the experiment.\nUnder a horizontal laminar flow hood, place one ovary at the time on a sterile polytetrafluoroethylene cutting board. Using a surgical blade No. 22 mounted on a scalpel handle, cut slices of ovarian cortex (the outer portion of the ovary, which contains the follicles), 1.5 – 2 mm thick and parallel to the major axis of the organ.\nPlace the slices of ovarian cortex in a sterile glass Petri dish covered with dissecting medium on a warm plate at 38.5 °C.\n\tNOTE: From now on all the procedures are performed at 38.5 °C using a warm plate.\n3. Selection and isolation of the follicles and retrieval of the COCs\nPlace one ovarian cortex slice in a 60 mm glass Petri dish with 2-3 mL of M199-D.\nUsing a dissection microscope, select the follicles between 0.5 – 2 mm using a micrometer-equipped eyepiece.",
    "Identify the healthy, non-atretic follicles under the stereomicroscope. Assess follicle atresia by observing morphological parameters, such as very clear translucent appearance, with a dark COC inside. Discard the atretic follicles and process all the others.\nUsing a surgical blade  No. 22 mounted on a scalpel handle remove the ovarian tissue surrounding the follicle on one side until the follicle is exposed on one edge.\nUsing a 26G needle mounted on a syringe, carefully make a slit in the exposed follicle wall. This action will release the follicular content, comprising the COC, follicular fluid and clumps of cells.\nIdentify the COC under the microscope and examine for cumulus integrity, zona pellucida integrity and homogeneity of the cytoplasm. If these criteria are fulfilled, aspirate the COC using a P20 pipette.\nPlace the isolated COC in M199-D cilostamide.\nContinue the isolation procedure for 30 min.\n4. Selection of COCs to be subjected to in vitro culture\nUnder the dissection microscope, select healthy COCs based on the criteria in step 3.6.\nIn a 60 mm Petri dish, prepare 16 drops of 20 µL of M199-D cilostamide and place one healthy COC per drop (Figure 1A).\nUsing an inverted microscope attached to a camera measure the oocyte diameter, excluding the zona pellucida, using the software provided with the camera.\nWith a clear visualization of the oocyte, make two perpendicular measurements excluding the zona pellucida (Figure 1B).\nAssure whether the mean of the two oocyte’s measurement, excluding the zona pellucida, is within a range of 100 – 110 µm. Discard COCs with not-rounded shaped oocyte or with oocytes that are not measurable.\nTransfer the selected COCs in a 35 mm dish containing M199-H medium and keep them in the incubator at 38.5 °C and 5% CO2 in air, maximum humidity until step 5.1.",
    "Repeat steps 3 and 4 up to 4x. The overall working time must not exceed 2 h.\n5. Long in vitro culture of the oocytes (L-IVCO)\nTransfer one COC per well in the center of a well of the 96 well plate to be prepared in step 1.1.5.\nIncubate the plate for 5 days at 38.5 °C and 5% CO2 in air, maximum humidity.\nEvery other day (day 2 and day 4) prepare fresh M199-L as described in step 1.\nRenew half of the medium by removing 100 µL of medium and replacing with 100 µL of freshly prepared M199-L. Perform the medium renewal under the stereomicroscope and avoid moving the COCs into the well.\n6. COC classification after the culture\nAt the end of the L-IVCO, analyze the COCs’ morphology under the dissection microscope.\nClassify as depicted in Figure 2.\n\t\nClassify as Class 1 if COCs show a compact cumulus cell investment with no sign of cumulus expansion and cell degeneration.\nClassify as Class 2 if COCs show a compact cumulus cell investment with no sign of cumulus expansion and cell degeneration and with antrum-like formation in the cumulus mass.\nClassify as Class 3 if COCs show several layers of cumulus cell with no sign of cumulus expansion and some disaggregated cells in the outer layer of cumulus cells and no antrum-like formation.\nClassify as Class 4 if COCs shows abundant loss of cumulus cells extending for more than 50% of the oocyte surface, and signs of cell degeneration and cell debris.\n7. Evaluation of meiotic progression after culture\nOocyte denudation\n\t\nPlace each COC in a single well of a four-well plate containing 400 µL of 199D per well. \nUnder a dissection microscope gently remove the cumulus cells mechanically by repeated pipetting using a pipette set at 130-140 µL.",
    "Once the oocytes are free of the cumulus investment, transfer them to another well containing 199D.\nRepeat the process until all the oocytes are completely denuded.\nOocyte nuclear staining\n\tNOTE: From now on all the procedures are performed at room temperature. Reagents are at room temperature.\n\t\nFix the oocytes in paraformaldehyde 4% in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 1 h.\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear personal protective equipment when handling paraformaldehyde and dispose of contaminated materials in accordance with hazardous waste disposal guidelines.\nWash the oocytes 3x for 5 min each in PBS containing 1% polyvinylalcohol (PVA).\n\t\tNOTE: The samples can be processed right away or stored at 4 °C for maximum one week.\nPlace the oocytes in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X for 10 min.\nWash the oocytes 3x for 5 min each in PBS containing 1% PVA.\nPlace the oocytes singularly in drops of 5 µL of antifade medium supplemented with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dilactate (1 µg/mL) over a slide.\nPlace two strips of double-sided tape along the long sides of the slide, to avoid excessive flattening of the oocytes when putting the cover slip on top.\nPlace the cover slip on top, make it adhere to the tape and keep in the dark while processing all the samples.\nAnalyze the oocytes using a conventional epifluorescence microscope equipped with DAPI filters (Excitation/Emission: 358⁄461) to assess the meiotic progression of the oocytes.\nClassify the oocytes according to their meiotic progression: GV - oocytes with different degrees of chromatin condensation within the GV; MI – oocytes from GV breaking down to metaphase I; and degenerate – oocytes that could be not identified as being at any of the previous stages.\nSubscription Required.
