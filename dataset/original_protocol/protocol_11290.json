    "This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics committee of Helsinki University Hospital. Signed informed consent was obtained from the subject for the blood sample used to demonstrate this protocol.\n1. Designing inverse primers and selecting restriction enzymes (bioinformatics)\nDetermining a LINE-1 associated unique tag\n\t\nDownload the TTC28-LINE-1 sequence in FASTA format from a LINE-1 database such as L1Base17. The L1base ID for TTC28-LINE-1 is 135.\nInclude 5 kb sequence flanking both 5´ and 3´ ends of the LINE-1 sequence and annotate it in a word processor.\n\t\tNOTE: Here the LINE-1 flanking sequence is annotated in brown font, and LINE-1 sequence is in grey font (Supplemental File).\nEnter 1 kb sequence downstream of selected LINE-1's cognate PAS into a PAS prediction tool such as polyadq18 or Dragon PolyA spotter19 and annotate all the polyadenylation signal in this 1 kb window.\n\t\tNOTE: If there is no PAS in the 1 kb window, search for PAS in next 1 kb window downstream. TTC28-LINE-1's own weak PAS is highlighted in pink and all the other PAS in 1 kb window downstream is highlighted in red (Supplemental File).\nAnnotate the sequence between the end of LINE-1's cognate PAS and the strongest PAS downstream as \"unique tag\".\n\t\tNOTE: The \"unique tag\" of TTC28-LINE-1 is highlighted in yellow (Supplemental File).\nDesigning inverse primers\n\t\nDesign inverse PCR primers by entering the \"unique tag\" sequence into a web-based primer-designing tool like Primer 3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/) or NCBI’s primer-BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). Since primer pairs designed by these tools face each other facilitating conventional PCR, use the reverse-complement function for the primer pair to perform inverse PCR.",
    "NOTE: As LINE-1 transductions are heavily truncated at their 5´ end and the size of the transduced region is highly variable, aim to keep the distance between the two inverse primers minimal, by setting the \"PCR product length\" parameter in NCBI primer-BLAST to the minimum. In the case of multiple PAS within the unique tag, design several primer pairs that correspond to different PASs. Design primers close to the PAS, as LINE-1 insertions initiate from the 3´end of the RNA intermediate and the 5´ end is variably truncated. Here three primer pairs were designed, highlighted in teal and green, corresponding to three strong polyadenylation signals in the unique tag of TTC28 LINE-1 (Supplemental File).\nSelecting restriction enzymes\n\t\nDigest the LINE-1 sequence along with its 5 kb upstream and downstream flanks in silico using web-based tool such as RestrictionMapper. This will give a comprehensive list of restriction enzymes that digests this region, generating different restriction fragments.\nSelect restriction enzymes that cut the native locus of LINE-1 as follows: at the 5´ end, either upstream of the LINE-1´s 5´end or far 5´end of the LINE-1 itself, and at the 3´ end, downstream of the LINE-1's unique tag.\n\t\tNOTE: The selected restriction enzyme should be insensitive to DNA methylation, should be heat-inactivatable, and should generate staggered \"sticky\" ends that are complementary to each other. In order to demonstrate LDI-PCR, SacI restriction enzyme that cuts DNA at GAGCTC sites, highlighted here in light green, is used (Supplemental File).\nTake note of the restriction fragment size made by selected restriction enzymes. This should not be longer than 12 kb as it might not be efficiently amplified by PCR.\n2. Making circular DNA templates for long-distance inverse PCR\nDNA extraction and quality assessment",
    "Extract genomic DNA from samples (tumor or blood) using commercially available DNA extraction kits that can extract good quality, high molecular weight DNA necessary for LDI-PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, high molecular weight DNA can also be extracted by phenol:chloroform20.\nMeasure the DNA concentration using a fluorometer according to the manufacturer's instructions, and run 100 ng of DNA on 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/mL) in 1x Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer at 4.5 V/cm21 alongside λ-HindIII DNA molecular weight markers to check DNA quality and quantity.\nDigesting genomic DNA\n\t\nMake a digestion reaction mix (final volume of 50 µL) by adding 20 units SacI restriction enzyme, 5 µL of 10x reaction buffer (Table of Materials), 100 ng of DNA (up to 44 µL) in a 0.2 mL PCR tube on ice (1 µL of restriction enzyme from most manufacturers is sufficient to completely digest 100 ng of genomic DNA). Mix the solution by flicking the tube, and centrifuge briefly.\nUse a thermal cycler to incubate the reaction mix at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 5 min.\nSelf-ligating the digested genomic DNA\n\t\nTo the 50 µL digestion mix (after step 2.2.2), add 8 µL of 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer, 1 µL (5 units) of T4 DNA ligase and 21 µL of ultrapure water to make a final reaction volume of 80 µL. Mix the solution by flicking the tubes, and centrifuge briefly.\nIncubate in a thermal cycler at 22 °C for 10 min, terminating with a heat inactivation step at 65 °C for 10 min.\n3. Long-distance inverse PCR\nDetermining primer annealing temperature by gradient PCR",
    "Set an annealing temperature gradient of (A-4) °C, (A-2)°C, A, (A+2)°C, (A+4) °C where A is the theoretical annealing temperature of the primer pair calculated using the commercial vendor's web-based tool.\n\t\tNOTE: Thermal cyclers from some manufacturers may not allow setting the temperature gradient manually. In that case, the automatic gradient setting can be used with a temperature range of (A-4) °C to (A+4) °C.\nPrepare a master mix for the PCR by combining and mixing the following components in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube: 4 µL of 5x reaction buffer, 0.4 µL of 10 mM dNTP, 5 µL of 2 µM PCR primer (forward and reverse, designed in step 1.3.1), 0.2 µL (0.1 U) of DNA polymerase per reaction. Set up one reaction for each annealing temperature in the gradient.\nFor each reaction, aliquot 19 µL of the master mix into 0.2 mL PCR tubes and add 1 µL (1.25 ng) of circular DNA template made in section 2.\n\t\tNOTE: Use circular self-ligated DNA generated from normal blood DNA as template so as to avoid consuming potentially precious tumor DNA for this optimization step.\nRun gradient PCR program on a thermal cycler as described below: (i) one cycle of 3 min at 98 °C (denaturation); (ii) 35 cycles of (10 s at 98 °C [denaturation], 20 s at the temperature gradient of [A-4] to [A+4] °C [Annealing] and 1−6 min [30 s per kilobase of expected PCR product] at 72 °C [extension]); (iii) one cycle of 10 min at 72 °C (final extension).\nRun 6 µL of the PCR product in 1% agarose gel21 prepared in 1x TAE buffer at 4.5 V/cm and analyze the PCR products yielded at different annealing temperatures.\nSelect the annealing temperature that yields a PCR product that corresponds to the expected size.",
    "Detecting de novo LINE-1 retrotransposition activity in the tumor genome\n\t\nPerform LDI-PCR using the inverse PCR primer pair on circular DNA templates generated from tumor samples (section 2). Follow same instructions as for gradient PCR (section 3.1), but this time replacing the temperature gradient with the optimal annealing temperature.\nAnalyze the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis as done in step 3.1.5. PCR product of known size or the \"native\" PCR product corresponding to the LINE-1 at its native locus should be visible for each reaction. De novo LINE-1 3´ transduction in the tumor sample assayed is detectable as PCR products of different sizes, along with the native PCR product in the agarose gel.\n4. Sequencing LDI-PCR products to reveal the identity of target sites for LINE-1 3´ transduction\nPerform single-molecule long read sequencing of all the PCR amplicons generated in each LDI-PCR reaction to identify the target integration sites of these LINE-1 3´ transduction events.\n\tNOTE: Cloning and Sanger sequencing of the LDI-PCR products is also a possible, albeit cumbersome, approach.\nAlign the reads produced by single-molecule long read sequencing platforms to the reference genome using standard sequence alignment pipelines. Analyze the aligned reads using LDI-PCR software14 to identify de novo LINE-1 insertions and its target sites."
