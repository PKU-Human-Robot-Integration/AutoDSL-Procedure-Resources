    "All animal procedures performed in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jefferson University.\n1. Primary culture of neurons from embryonic rat cortex\nNOTE: Primary cortical neurons are isolated from E17.5 rat embryos as previously described57,58. No strain bias appears to exist with the success of this culturing protocol. This method is described briefly below. The previous articles indicated should be referenced for complete details.\nEuthanize pregnant female rats by CO2 inhalation followed by secondary confirmation by cervical dislocation.\nHarvest embryos and isolate brains in ice-cold 20 mM HEPES-buffered Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). From the outer cortex shell, separate and then discard striatum and hippocampi. Collect cortices.\nUse fine forceps to remove meninges from cortices. To do this, hold the cortex in place with one pair of closed forceps using gentle pressure.\n\tNOTE: With the second pair of forceps in the second hand, pinch meninges. Peel away meninges using rolling motion with pinched pair. Reposition with the closed forceps and repeat as necessary until meninges is entirely removed.\nIncubate cortices with 10 µg/mL of papain in HBSS for 4 min at 37 °C.\nWash three times in HBSS, and then triturate gently 5-10 times with a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette to obtain a homogenous cell suspension.\n\t​NOTE: Avoid bubbles; maintain the pipette within the cell suspension.\nPlate neurons on 100 µg/mL poly-D-lysine coated 35 mm glass-bottom dishes at a density of 75,000 cells/dish in neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (2%), and penicillin-streptomycin.\n2. Primary culture of motor neurons from embryonic rat spinal cord",
    "NOTE: Primary motor neurons are prepared from E13.5 rat embryos as previously described, with few modifications59,60. No strain bias appears to exist with the success of this culturing protocol. This method is described briefly below. The preceding articles indicated should be referenced for complete details.\nEuthanize pregnant female rats as in step 1.1.\nDissect 10-20 spinal cords from embryos and break into small fragments mechanically using two pairs of forceps to pinch and pull, respectively.\nIncubate in 0.025% trypsin for 8 min, followed by addition of DNase at 1 mg/mL.\nCentrifuge through a 4% w/v BSA cushion at 470 x g for 5 min at 4 °C with no break.\nCentrifuge pelleted cells for 55 min at 830 x g at 4 °C without brake through a 10.4% (v/v) density gradient medium (see Table of Materials) cushion. Carry forward the motor neuron band at the visual interface.\n\tNOTE: To ensure capture of all cells, use phenol-free media for the density gradient step and phenol-containing media for all the other steps. The interface of the density gradient and dissociation media is easily identifiable based on the color difference.\nSpin collected bands through another 4% w/v BSA cushion at 470 x g for 5 min at 4 °C with no break.\nResuspend purified motor neurons in complete neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (2%), glutamine (0.25%), 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1%), horse serum (2%), and penicillin-streptomycin.\nPlate neurons on 100 µg/mL of poly-lysine and 3 µg/mL of laminin-coated coverslips at a density of 50,000 cells/35 mm glass-bottom dish.\n3. Neuronal transfections",
    "NOTE: This step is carried out for neurons that will undergo GCaMP calcium imaging and/or neurons in which an exogenous DNA plasmid or RNA of interest is introduced in advance of synaptic evaluation. In contrast, styryl dye is loaded just before the imaging session and is addressed in section 6. The summary below is the transfection protocol used for primary rodent neurons in the presented examples, but it can easily be adapted and optimized to the user's needs.\nTransfections for cultured primary cortical neurons occur at day 12 in vitro (DIV 12), whereas motor neurons are transfected at day 7 in vitro (DIV 7).\n\tNOTE: All the following steps occur within an aseptic biosafety cabinet.\nTransfect 500 ng of GCaMP6m using transfection reagent at a ratio of 1:2 by volume. For co-transfections, add a total of 1.25 µg of total DNA/dish, maintaining this DNA to reagent ratio.\n\tNOTE: In the experimental examples shown, 750 ng of ALS/FTD-related plasmid of interest has been transfected to express C9orf72-ALS linked dipeptides, mutant FUS protein, etc. Ensure that the fluorescent tag of the co-transfected plasmid will not conflict with the FITC channel of GCaMP imaging. Likewise, if doing styryl dye imaging, ensure that the co-transfected plasmid will not conflict with the TRITC channel of imaging. Usage of synaptophysin-GCaMP3 is equally effective in this protocol. Therefore, transfect the same amount of this plasmid and follow all the steps as usual in section 7.\nIncubate the DNA-transfection reagent complex at room temperature for 10 min.\nGently add the incubated complex to neurons dropwise with swirling. Return the dish to CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 45-60 min.",
    "Remove the entire culture media containing the DNA-transfection reagent complex and replace it with a 50-50 by volume preparation of pre-conditioned and fresh neuronal media. Then, put cells back into the CO2 incubator for 48 h until imaging.\n4. Preparation of buffer solutions and styryl dye stock solution\nMake low and high aCSF solutions fresh before imaging using the ingredients listed in Table 1. Filter both the buffer solutions before use.\n\tNOTE: CaCl2 dihydrate can form Ca(OH)2 upon storage. For maximum efficacy, always use a recently opened container. If this is not possible, to remove Ca(OH)2 from the external surface and ensure maximum solubility, solutions may be carbonated with gaseous CO2 for 5 min before CaCl2 addition. If this step is taken, adjust the pH of the resulting solution to maintain a pH value of 7.4, as excessive carbonation will result in Ca(HCO3)2 formation.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nLow KCL aCSF buffer (pH 7.40 to 7.45),\nReagent,Concentration\nHEPES,10 mM\nNaCl,140 mM\nKCl,5 mM\nGlucose,10 mM\nCaCl2 2H2O,2 mM\nMgCl2 4H2O,1 mM\nHigh KCL aCSF buffer (pH 7.40 to 7.45),\nReagent,Concentration\nHEPES,10 mM\nNaCl,95 mM\nKCl,50 mM\nGlucose,10 mM\nCaCl2 2H2O,2 mM\nMgCl2 4H2O,1 mM\nTable 1: Composition of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) buffers. This table includes the ingredients for preparing low and high KCl artificial cerebrospinal fluid buffers used while imaging and stimulating neurons. See section 4 for preparation instructions.\nPrepare styryl dye stock solution by taking a 100 µg vial of dye and reconstituting it to a stock concentration of 10 mM with distilled water or neurobasal medium.\n5. Microscope and perfusion system setup",
    "NOTE: For imaging glass-bottom Petri dishes, an inverted confocal fluorescence microscope is preferred due to the flexibility of perfusion and for the use of a high numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Refer to the Table of Materials for the confocal microscope, camera, and objectives used for imaging of examples detailed in the Representative Results section.\nPerform all the experiments at 37 °C with constant 5% CO2 levels using an incubator system-coupled stage mount.\nControl image acquisition using confocal software. Optimize acquisition settings at the start of the imaging session to choose excitation power and gain to ensure optimal visualization of signals without photobleaching.\n\t\nKeep excitation power, exposure time, detector gain and frame rate constant across all samples. Carry out time-lapse imaging using an aspect ratio of 512 x 512 and frame rate of 2 images/s to minimize dye bleaching.\n\t\tNOTE: While puncta should be clearly visible, laser intensity should be set to the minimum possible to avoid bleaching and phototoxicity. Set the confocal aperture to the narrowest setting to achieve optimal resolution of fluorescent puncta within neurites. Exposure time is set to 200 ms or less, consistent across samples. The maximum imaging speed of the camera used was 2 images/s. If using a faster camera, more images/s can be taken. Temporal imaging settings should be chosen if possible.\nSelect the following fluorescence excitation/dichroic/emission filter combinations for imaging using confocal software: Gcamp6m/Gcamp3 with FITC and styryl dye with TRITC, respectively.\nUse the perfect focus feature of the confocal imaging acquisition software during time-lapse imaging to avoid z-drift.\n\tNOTE: Due to the rapid speed of imaging, a single plane is imaged. Ensuring the lack of z-drift during the experiment is very important.\nSelect the Time tab in the image acquisition panel to set the recording periods and intervals.",
    "Set Phase #1 to Interval 500 ms, Duration 3 - 5 min.\nSet Phase #2 to Interval 500 ms, Duration 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Phase #1 corresponds to baseline recording, Phase #2 to the stimulation period, respectively.\nAssemble gravity perfusion apparatus for aCSF using a valve control system and a channel manifold.\n\t\nLoad high KCl (see Table 1) into a 50 mL syringe at the top of the apparatus, with tubing running through the system. Set the flow rate to 1 mL/min.\nLoad a 35 mm glass dish containing neurons onto the confocal imaging stage, with the end of the perfusion tubing placed at the dish edge. Choose the field for imaging.\n6. Styryl dye imaging of synaptic vesicle release\nIncubate cells in low KCl aCSF (see Table 1) for 10 min at 37 °C, 48 h post-transfection.\nLoad primary cortical or motor neurons on glass-bottom Petri dishes with styryl dye.\n\t\nRemove low KCl aCSF by aspiration.\nUse a pipette to load neurons in the dark with 10 µM of styryl dye in aCSF containing 50 mM KCl for 5 min.\nRemove the loading solution and bath neurons in low KCl aCSF for 10 min to eliminate non-specific dye loading.\nPlace the 35 mm glass-bottom dish onto the imaging stage, and then observe either under a 20x air objective or 40x oil immersion objective of an inverted confocal microscope.\n\tNOTE: Use GFP fluorescence to locate transfected cells in case of cells co-transfected with a GFP-tagged plasmid.\nExcite styryl dye using a 546 nm laser, collect emission using a 630-730 nm (TRITC) bandpass filter.\nSelect the imaging field and engage perfect focus. Next, take a single still image with brightfield, TRITC, and fluorescence marker channels to mark neuronal boundaries.",
    "Initiate Run Now in the acquisition software. Carry out the basal recording for 3-5 min to exclude variations in dye intensity, if any (Phase #1).\n\tNOTE: It is essential to ensure that any decrease in dye intensity is due to synaptic vesicle release and not passive dye diffusion or photobleaching. This 3-5 min pre-stimulation period should result in a steady and maintained dye intensity level. The final 30 s of this recording will be used to determine a mean baseline fluorescence value for each ROI. Before evaluating experimental conditions, an additional non-stimulation condition of approximately 10 min of continuous recording using the intended acquisition settings can also be performed to ensure steady fluorescence values using the laser settings for an extended period.\nAt the switch to Phase #2, trigger On the button for the perfusion system. Then, constantly perfuse 50 mM KCl to neurons to facilitate dye unloading (Phase #2).\n\t\nCarry out recordings for 300 s after KCl addition. After this, acquisition stops; trigger the Off switch for the perfusion system.\nSave the experiment and analyze data using confocal software as described in section 8 below.\n\t​NOTE: The experiment may be stopped at this point, and analysis can be performed later. In the case where cells do not require transfection for the expression of proteins of interest, this protocol may be performed at any timepoint in vitro when seeking to examine the functionality of synaptic unloading. Following a test of control cells to ensure proper synaptic unloading, the experimenter should be blinded to the genetic or pharmacologic conditions of each dish tested to minimize bias.\n7. Fluorescence imaging of Gcamp6m calcium transients\nTransfect primary rodent cortical neurons cultured on 35 mm glass-bottom dishes with 500 ng of Gcamp6m as indicated in section 3.",
    "NOTE: If desired, co-transfect neurons with a plasmid of interest containing a fluorescent tag in the red or far-red range.\nIncubate neurons with low KCl aCSF for 15 min 48 h post-transfection and then mount the dish on the imaging platform.\nVisualize GCaMP6m fluorescence using a FITC filter (488 nm) and a 20x or 40x objective.\nSelect the imaging field and engage perfect focus. Next, take a single still image with brightfield, FITC, and fluorescence marker channels to mark neuronal boundaries.\nInitiate Run Now in the acquisition software. Carry out the baseline recording for 5 min, and then perfuse with aCSF containing 50 mM KCL in the same manner as described in section 6 for styryl dye experiments.\n\tNOTE: The goal of this imaging is to measure evoked calcium transients. Should a neuron have basal firing activity and calcium fluxes during the pre-stimulation period, it is not used in data analysis. Instead, only cells with stable background fluorescence are used. Post-stimulation periods can also be extended to 60 min for calcium transients, with or without additional continuous high KCl perfusion.\nSave the experiment and analyze data using confocal software as described in section 8 below. The experiment may be stopped at this point, and the analysis can be performed later.\n\t​NOTE: If the cells do not require transfection for expression of proteins of interest, this protocol may be performed at any timepoint in vitro when seeking to examine calcium transients. Following a test of control cells to ensure measurement of calcium transients, the experimenter should be blinded to the genetic or pharmacologic conditions of each dish tested to minimize bias.\n8. Image analysis\nOpen time-lapse images with confocal software.",
    "Align images in time-lapse series by the command series : Image | Processing | Align Current Document. Select Align to the First Frame.\nSelect regions of interest (ROIs) along neurites using the ROI selection tool, a bean-shaped icon on the right of the image frame (Figure 3B). Also, mark an ROI representing background fluorescence intensity.\n\tNOTE: ROIs are selected by choosing areas of distinctly separated puncta along neuronal tracks indicated by the brightfield still image. At least five ROIs per neuron are chosen for analysis. The background ROI is chosen in a region of the field of view that does not contain neurites.\nMeasure raw fluorescence over time for selected ROIs using the following command series: Measure | Time Measurement.\n\t\nInitiate the Measure function at the upper portion of the Time Measurement panel. A graphical representation of raw fluorescence over time (Figure 3C) and quantitative data are both generated.\n\t\tNOTE: Each data point represents the raw fluorescence for that ROI for the frame associated with that specific measured time point.\nExport raw fluorescence intensities to the spreadsheet software.\nAnalyze each ROI independently. First, normalize data by subtracting the background ROI intensity from the ROI of interest intensity at each time point.\n\t\nTake the raw fluorescence value from the background ROI at each specific time point and subtract this from the ROI of interest raw intensity value at that time point.\n\t\tNOTE: This is done for the entire recording period, both basal and stimulation phases.\nDetermine the average ROI of interest intensity for the last 30 s of baseline.\n\t\nAverage the normalized raw basal values generated in step 8.6 from the final 30 s of the 3-5 min basal recording period.",
    "NOTE: The entire period of basal recording could be used to generate this value. However, as this value stabilizes and is maintained, the 60-time points of the final 30 s are of sufficient sampling size to represent the whole.\nCompare this baseline value to the normalized intensity value at each time point, generating a change in fluorescence (ΔF) value.\n\t\nTake the value from step 8.7 and subtract the average baseline fluorescent value. Do this and subsequent steps for the entire recording period, both basal and stimulation phases.\nCalculate this change concerning the baseline fluorescence value, generating a change in fluorescence/baseline fluorescence (ΔF/F). To do this, take the value from step 8.8 and divide it by the average baseline fluorescent value.\nFinally, set the starting point value to 1 so that increases or decreases can be easily visualized graphically over time.\n\t\nTake the value generated in step 8.9 and add 1.\n\t\t​NOTE: When this is done correctly, the 30 s of baseline period values should hover near the value of 1. In cells effectively releasing synaptic content, this value should trend from 1 to 0 following the start of stimulation. An example of steps 6-9 is presented in Figure 3E.\n9. Data analysis\nNOTE: The experimenter can be unblinded to experimental conditions to pool data for analysis appropriately. Use a sample size of at least 10 neurons per condition from each of three independent experiments. Only consider neurons for inclusion if at least five ROI regions can be designated. This level of experimental replication was sufficient in published studies to demonstrate a profound loss of synaptic unloading in ALS-related poly-GA-containing cells versus GFP controls (see Representative Results). However, if a more subtle phenotype is observed, the number of biological and/or technical replicates may require optimization by the user.",
    "Using all calculated ΔF/F values over time from ROIs of a given experimental condition, determine a mean ΔF/F value for each time point along with an SEM.\nPlot data using a graphing and statistics software program in xy-format, where x is the time elapsed, and y is the ΔF/F value calculated in step 9.1. Present all the values as mean ± SEM.\nTo determine statistical significance, use the Student's t-test for comparing two groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's posthoc analysis for comparing three or more groups.\nSubscription Required.
