  "procedures": [
    "All surgical and animal handling procedures were performed as approved under the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council) and the Guidelines of the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Surgical Preparation\nSterilize all surgical tools including the spine stabilizer. Clean the surgical table and all the surrounding area with 70% ethanol. For preparation of the non-survival surgical procedure, place a clean surgical pad on the top of a 37 °C heating pad.\nUse six week old Sprague Dawley (SD) rat for this study. Weigh and anesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (87.7 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.3 mg/kg) mixture. Confirm proper stage of anesthesia when the animal ceases to respond to a toe pinch stimulus. Subcutaneously inject 0.01-0.05 mg/kg Buprenorphine and 5mg/kg Carprofen prior to surgery.\nShave the rat in 2 areas: the cervical spine region on the back and the neck region on the breast side. Swab the skin areas with betadine surgical scrub and 70% alcohol wipes. Apply eye ointment to prevent dry eye during surgery. Place the animal in a supine position on the clean surgical pad. \n2. External Jugular Vein Catheterization\nLocate the external jugular vein by finding the pulse point near the collarbone, and cut with a pair of small spring scissors to make a vertical incision on the spot,which is the cross-point of 3 anatomical points: caudal ramus of right mandible, greater tubercle of humerus and manubrium (Figure 1A). Isolate the vessel using spring scissors and fine forceps. Tie the distal end with 1 sterile surgical suture line(Figure 1C)20.",
    "Prepare one 1-mL syringe filled with saline and connected with a specialized catheter made from a 21-gauge needle (Figure 1B). Make a small incision using a pair of micro scissors on the vessel and slide the catheter into the vessel.\n\t\nSecure the needle by tying both the proximal and distal end (Figure 1C). The specialized catheter is made from a 21-gauge needle. Grind the tip flat and weld with a 2-mm piece of tip cut off from another 21-gauge needle. This can prevent the catheter from slipping outside.\nNote: A small amount of blood flowing into the needle indicates that the needle has entered a blood vessel successfully.\n3. Spine Stabilization and C5-C7 Laminectomy\nPlace the animal in a prone position. Cut the skin along the midline with a No. 15 scalpel blade at the desired spinal levels. Dissect the muscle layers from the 5th to 7th cervical vertebrae (C5-C7) bilaterally to expose the lateral facets (Figure 2A)21.\nNote: Locate the second thoracic vertebra (T2) by finding the spike between the scapulae. Count upward from the T2 vertebra to find the C7 vertebra21,22,23,24.\nStabilize the spine of the rat using a modified stabilizing apparatus. Make a slit on both sides of the lateral vertebral bone. Slide the stainless-steel arms underneath the exposed transverse process facets and tighten the screws to secure stability (Figure 2B).\nCarefully remove the C5-C7 laminae (laminectomy, Figure 2C).\nPlace a small piece of saline-soaked gelfoam on top of the exposed dura mater to keep it moisturized (Figure 2D).\n4. Installation of Two-photon (2P) Imaging Window",
    "Stuff small pieces of gelfoam into the gap between muscles and vertebral bones, also stuff a thin line of gelfoam between spinal cord and vertebral bones, then use tissue adhesive glue to seal the surrounding muscle-bone area. Wait 5 min for complete dryness (Figure 2E).\nNote: This step effectively prevents future bleeding into the window and leakiness of immersion solutions.\nPrepare 4% agar with ddH2O in a microwave. After the agar is completely dissolved, wait until it returns to a touchable temperature. Fill a 1-mL sterile syringe with agar solution and pipe it onto the edge of the window to build a wall (Figure 2E). The solution solidifies quickly and remains flexible to allow the lens or objective to move freely.\nWhen ready for imaging, remove the gelfoam and place immersion fluid inside the window for 2P imaging (Figure 2F). Transfer the stabilized animal inside the 2-photon microscope dark chamber and place the 2P imaging window directly under the lens. Lower the lens carefully into the imaging window.\n5. Injection of First Fluorescent Dye and Baseline Imaging\nPrepare 0.5 mL of Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran (4 mg/mL average molecular weight ~70kDa) in saline. Fill a 1-mL sterile syringe with the solution and connect the syringe to the previously installed catheter.\nNote: Preparing the fluorescent dye solution before use is recommended.\nInject the first dye by depressing the syringe very slowly (Figure 3B). First, use the eyepiece to identify the area of interest. Use a charge coupled device (CCD) camera to acquire a bright-field image of the surface blood vessel patterns at lower magnification as a landmark image. Switch to laser scanning mode and then open the 2P imaging software for collecting both images and line-scan data.",
    "Select the proper 2P laser excitation wavelength, power, and fluorescent channel (red channel for first dye) to match with the fluorophores used in the imaged tissue, and then perform in vivo imaging (Figure 3E). Keep the animal on a heating pad during the whole process.\n6. C7 Contusive Injury using LISA device\nPerform a C7 midline contusion injury using a Louisville Injury System Apparatus (LISA) device according to a previously established protocol25,26.\n\t\nIn brief, place the animal on the LISA stage following calibration. After selecting a zero-point setting and adjusting tissue displacement (0.800 mm in this case), click the \"Run Experiment\" button of the software to trigger the impactor release and create the injury.\nAfter the injury, place another small piece of saline-soaked gelfoam on top of the exposed dura mater to keep it moisturized.\nRepeat step 4.3 and re-perform in vivo imaging on the same area visible with the previously injected red dye (Figure 3C &F).\nTransfer the animal back to the surgical table and keep the animal sedated with appropriate anesthesia following the IACUC-IUSM protocol.\n7. Injection of Second Fluorescent Dye and Post-injury Imaging\nPrepare 0.5 mL of Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (4 mg/mL, average molecular weight ~70 kDa) in saline same as in 5.1. Fill the solution in a 1-mL sterile syringe and connect with the previously installed catheter.\nTransfer the stabilized animal back inside the 2P microscope dark chamber and re-image the same area with the red channel for the first dye and the green channel for the second dye (Figures 3D & G).\nAt the end of imaging, release the rat from the spinal stabilization device and clean the agar wall.\n8. Animal Sacrifice\nAfter imaging, sacrifice the rat following the transcardial perfusion protocol27. Collect the spinal cord samples and fix them in 4% PFA.",
    "9. Offline Data Analysis: Quantification of Vessel Diameters\nTransfer the image files to a workstation for off-line analysis.\nOpen ImageJ and select \"file\" and then choose previously saved raw data and open the associated single image file (Figure 4B).\nCalibrate the image by selecting \"Analyze\" followed by \"Set Scale\" (Figure 4C). The value placed in \"Distance in pixels\" is calculated using the equation displayed in Figure 4A. The calibration of 2-photon optical lens determines the default value in the equation. The value of \"opticalZoom\" is found in Excel Extensible Markup Languagefile (XML file) associated with the single image file (Figure 4B).\nDraw a line perpendicular to the long axis of the vessel (Figure 4D1 & E1) and select \"Analyze\" followed by \"Measure\". The measurement of vessel diameter is displayed in the result window (Figure 4D2 & E2). Repeat 3 times across the vessel to acquire the average value.\n10. Offline Data Analysis: Quantification of red blood cell (RBC) Velocity\nTransfer the line-scan files to the workstation for analysis.\nStart the ImageJ software and select \"file\" and then choose previously saved raw data and open all associated line-scan files with the extension name \".ome\".\nOpen \"Image\" and select \"Stacks\" followed by \"images to stack\". Convert all OME files into a single image stack TIFF file.\nStart Matlab software and click \"Open\", select \"LSPIV_parallel.m\" code file. Note: Matlab code for LS-PIV can be downloaded at https://sourceforge.net/projects/lspivsupplement/files/18\nSelect the following orders: \"Run\">\"Change Folder\">\"artery\". Choose the image stack TIFF file generated in 10.3.\nType \"Y\" and press Enter.\nPlace a cursor on the left and right side of the image respectively, and the program starts to process the data.",
    "At the end of the program, enter 2 values to calculate the final read: \"pixel_meter conversion value\", and \"scan-time conversion value\". Both can be found in the XML file associated with line-scan data. The final value is expressed as the mean and standard deviation of velocity in the units of millimeter per second (mm/s)."
