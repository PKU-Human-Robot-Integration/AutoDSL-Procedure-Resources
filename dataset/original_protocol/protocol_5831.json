    "Preparing fliesTraineeCulture flies at 25 ± 1 °C and 50 ± 10% relative humidity in a 12-h light/dark cycle.Collect virgin females and virgin males within 8 h after eclosion under ice anesthesia.Clip the male wings with forceps (Figure 4). Keep the female wings intact.Subject these flies immediately to the training session after recovering from the anesthesia.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180715/20180715234109_8184.jpgFigure 4. Operation for clipping fly wings. Flies are anesthetized on an ice-cold aluminum plate. Wings of male flies are clipped at their bases (dotted line).Partner maleUse wild-type male flies for the female copulation assay as partner males. Clip the wings of these males right after eclosion.Keep them singly in a plastic vial with fly food at 25 °C in a 12-h light/dark cycle until experiments. Transfer each fly to a new plastic vial with fly food every 2 to 3 days, but not on the day of experiment. Use 7-day old males for the female copulation assay. Training sessionKeep the room temperature at 25 ± 1 °C and relative humidity 50 ± 10%.Introduce each fly gently to a training capsule on the day of eclosion.Set training capsules in the sound nest.Place the sound nest in front of a loudspeaker ( FF225WK  ). One of the mesh-ends of each training capsule faces the loudspeaker, so that sound is delivered to each chamber with minimal disturbance. The distance between the loudspeaker and the near end of the training capsules is 24 mm.Start an artificial pulse song (conspecific song or heterospecific song) playback for experienced flies. For Naïve flies, no sound is played. The mean baseline-to-peak amplitude of sound particle velocity is 8.6 mm/sec when measured at the near end of the training capsules, and 6.6 mm/sec at the far end of the training capsule. The sound particle velocity is identical for all training sounds.",
    "The artificial pulse song, 3-min long, is stored in a WAV format audio file (monaural, 44,100 Hz, 32-bit float). Play the audio file repeatedly with Windows media player for 6 days. Renew food in each training capsule every 36 h.After the 6-day training, collect male flies into a vial containing fly food in a group of seven without anesthesia until male-male chaining assay. Keep the female flies in the training capsules singly without sound playback until the female copulation assay. Test sessionNotes: Keep the room temperature at 25 ± 1°C and relative humidity 50 ± 10%.Perform behavioral tests within 4 h after light onset on the 7th day. In female copulation assay, the intactness of female wings is critical for copulation success. Ruffled or crippled wings will lower the copulation success rate. Load flies (one pair into each chamber) rapidly. To avoid early copulation and to give all the fly pairs a universal start in interaction, shake the chamber after each action of puffing. Female copulation assay (Figure 5)Use trained females and partner males in this assay.Transfer a pair of female and male flies gently with an aspirator through the loading hole into one of the eight chambers in the copulation plate rapidly without anesthesia. For each recording, load up to 8 pairs of flies (Figure 5A).Immediately after the transfer of the flies, insert the apparatus to a rubber support and place it over a loudspeaker (Daito Voice AR-10N). The loudspeaker is placed 39 mm under the chambers. Two small LED light arrays are placed at both sides of the loudspeaker to illuminate the female copulation chambers (Figure 5B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180715/20180715235446_4491.jpgFigure 5. Female copulation assay. A. Loading flies into a chamber. A fly pair is loaded into one of eight copulation chambers by using an aspirator.",
    "Each chamber has a test female and a partner male. The copulation plate is inserted into a hole of the rubber support. B. Assay setup. Rubber support holding the copulation plate is placed over a loudspeaker with appropriate distance. C. Example graph of song response of female flies. Cumulative copulation rate in the heterospecific song test after training is plotted. Naïve group (no sound during training) and experienced groups (trained with conspecific song or heterospecific song) are shown. N, Naïve; E, experienced. N.S., not significant, P > 0.05; ***P < 0.001; Kruskal–Wallis test versus Naïve group.Start the sound playback and video recording simultaneously. The particle velocity received at the apparatus is adjusted as 9.2 mm/sec.Record the behaviors of flies for 30 min with a web camera (Logitech, Logicool®) with a video capture software (Logitech Webcam Software) (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
