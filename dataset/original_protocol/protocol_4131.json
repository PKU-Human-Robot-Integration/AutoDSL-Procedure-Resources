    "Maintain the cells under standard tissue culture conditions at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Keep cell density below 1 x 106/ml and analyse at subconfluent stages.  Caution: Prior to analysis cell should be kept for several hours (min 12 h) in fresh medium to avoid potential activation of autophagy due to nutrients exhaustion. Generally culture medium contains autophagy affecting substances: amino acids, glucose, growth factors, hormones etc. Take care when comparing autophagic flux under different conditions to normalize for all the necessary factors. Normalize also for the solvent used when analysing the effect of different substances on autophagy – for example DMSO, ethanol etc. might affect autopagic flux.    Incubate the cells for the desired time and under the conditions of interest. Caution: When analysing prolonged periods of time under conditions potentially affecting cell numbers or viability, differences in nutrient consumption and therefore abundance might occur and influence your results as autophagic activity is highly related to the nutritional status.   Positive controls [rapamycin (1-5 µmol/L), PP242 (1-5 µmol/L), Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution containing 6 mmol/L glucose (starvation medium)] and negative controls [3-methyladenine (3-MA) (3–10 mmol/L), wortmannin (30–100 nmol/L), LY294002 (7–20 µmol/L), nocodazole (12–50 µmol/L), vinblastine (12–50 µmol/L), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) (10–20 mmol/L), hydrohychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) (5–10 µmol/L)] may be also included. Positive controls activate autophagy and should result in a decreased total cellular LC3-GFP signal. Negative controls inhibit different stages of autophagic process and generally should lead to an increase in total cellular LC3-GFP signal. We also recommend analysing the effect of a new substance not only on basic, but also on rapamycin, PP242 or starvation activated autophagic flux.",
    "At the end of incubation period transfer the cells to FACS tubes, put them on ice and analyse by flow cytometry plotting the data of cell counts as GFP/FITC fluorescence intensity measured on FL1 channel. For adherent cells, wash once with DPBS, trypsinize, wash again with DPBS, resuspend in DPBS (2% FBS), put on ice and analyse. Caution: Generally pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy lack specificity and therefore some cell type specific effects might occur.  Table 1 may be used to facilitate the interpretation of the results.  Table 1. Analysis of unknown substance X table:",

(Activator): autophagy induction [rapamycin (1-5 µmol/L), PP242 (1-5 µmol/L) or starvation medium]. Suggested incubation time 4 to 6 h.   Analysis of unknown substance X should include co incubation with one or more activators. Table 1 illustrates three possible scenarios. a) Scenario (I) the unknown substance X does not impact cellular autophagic activity; b) Scenario (II) X is an activator; c) Scenario (III) X is an inhibitor of autophagy.   Caution: Although considered the most accurate sensitive and reliable method for analysis of autophygic flux, flow cytometry determination of LC3-GFP turnover should be combined with alternative methods with non overlapping limitations such as electron microscopy (EM) fluorescence microscopy (FM), western blotting (WB) etc.    Example data:   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140328/20140328221106_2768.jpg Figure 1.
