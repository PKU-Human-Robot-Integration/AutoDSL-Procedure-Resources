    "All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nantong University (No. S20191210-402).\n1. Collection of zebrafish embryos\nSet up a pair of zebrafish in breeding tanks the night before the eggs are to be collected, one a transgenic zebrafish and the other an AB wild-type zebrafish (Tg (foxP2:egfp-caax) X AB wild-type or Tg (hb9:egfp) X AB wild-type) (see the Table of Materials). Use a diagonal plastic divider to separate the male and female to preclude physical access. The following day, fit the upper part of the breeding tank into a clean lower part filled with fresh water, and remove the divider of the breeding tank. Allow the fish mate for 10-20 min, and collect the eggs after they have sunk to the bottom of the breeding tank.\nCulture the embryos in E3 embryo medium (see the Table of Materials) containing methylene blue (1 mL of 0.05% methylene blue in 1 L of E3 embryo medium) at 28.5 °C.\nTreat the embryos at 24 h post fertilization (hpf) with phenylthiourea (PTU, see the Table of Materials) to prevent pigment formation.\n\t​NOTE: Animals of either sex are used in experiments.\n2.  In situ hybridization\nNOTE: The water used for steps 2.1-2.11 is diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water (see the Table of Materials).\nFix ~10 embryos with 0.5-1 mL of fresh 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, see the Table of Materials) in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube at 4 °C overnight for 12-14 h.\n\tNOTE: The protocol for in situ hybridization is modified slightly from previously published literature12. PFA must be freshly prepared and stored at 4 °C within one week of use or for one month at -20 °C. All the following steps in in situ hybridization were performed using 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.",
    "Use tweezers to remove the skin of only embryos older than 48 hpf.\n\tNOTE: The skin is removed to facilitate the penetration of RNA probes into the trunk region of embryos older than 48 hpf. \nGradually dehydrate the embryos by washing with 25%, 50%, and 75% methanol in 1x phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 successively (PBST, see the Table of Materials) for 5 min each at room temperature. Then, wash the embryos for 5 min in 100% methanol at room temperature. Incubate the embryos in 100% methanol at -20 °C for at least overnight for 12-14 h.\n\tNOTE: Dehydrated embryos can be stored in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 6 months.\nGradually rehydrate the embryos by washing with 75%, 50%, and 25% methanol in PBST successively for 5 min each at room temperature. Wash the embryo three times with PBST for 5 min each at room temperature.\nDigest the embryos with 10 µg/mL proteinase K (see the Table of Materials) in PBST at room temperature (see Table 1).\nWash the embryos with PBST for 5 min. Perform this washing step three times.\nRefix the washed embryos in 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: This step stops the digestion because PFA inactivates proteinase K. Ensure that the sample is mixed gently to expose all the embryos to PFA; the tubes can be placed on their sides to evenly distribute the embryos in the solution. This PFA does not have to be fresh (it can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks).\nWash the embryo three times with PBST, incubating for 5 min during each wash.",
    "Perform prehybridization of the embryos by incubating with prehybridization solution (preHYB, see the Table of Materials) at 65 °C for 5 min. Replace preHYB with hybridization solution (HYB, see the Table of Materials) and prehybridize for at least 4 h in HYB.\n\tNOTE: Before proceeding with prehybridization, preheat the solutions to 65 °C. Formamide (see the Table of Materials) is used to maintain the shape and structure of the tissue. Formamide also prevents the binding of nonhomologous fragments at low temperatures.\nHeat the probe (Insm1a or 5-HT2C) in HYB for 5 min at 95 °C before adding to the embryos. Use the probe at 1 µg/mL HYB. Remove as much preHYB as possible without letting the embryos come into contact with the air, and add preheated probe in HYB to the tube containing the embryos.\n\tNOTE: A labeled RNA probe can be used to hybridize with a target mRNA sequence in the embryos. Therefore, the probe can be used to detect the expression of a gene of interest and the location of mRNA.\nAllow the probe to hybridize overnight (12-14 h) at 50-70 °C.\n\tNOTE: The hybridization temperature differs for different probes.\nThe next day, aspirate the probe solution with a pipette and store it in a tube at -20 °C so that it can be reused many times.\nWash the embryos as follows:\n\t\nWash the embryos for 15 min with 100% HYB at 65 °C.\nWash the embryos sequentially with 75%, 50%, and 25% HYB in 2x standard saline citrate containing 0.1% Tween-20 (SSCT, see the Table of Materials) for 15 min each at 65 °C.\nWash the embryos for 15 min in 2x SSCT at 65 °C.\nWash the embryos for 15 min in 0.2x SSCT at 65 °C.",
    "Wash the embryos two times for 10 min in maleic acid buffer containing 0.02% Tween-20 (MABT, see the Table of Materials) at room temperature.\nBlock the hybridized and washed embryos for at least 2 h at room temperature with 2% blocking solution-1 (see the Table of Materials).\nReplace the blocking solution-1 with antidigoxigenin AP (1:4,000 dilution, see the Table of Materials) in a fresh 2% blocking solution-1 and shake overnight for 12-14 h at 4 °C.\nWash the embryos four times for 30 min in MABT at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Remove the BM purple (see the Table of Materials) from the refrigerator during the third wash and shake it occasionally during the subsequent washes.\nWash the embryos two times for 10 min in NTMT (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1% Tween-20, see the Table of Materials).\nUse a pipette to remove as much NTMT as possible from the embryos. Replace with BM purple AP substrate and stain the embryos at room temperature in the dark. Monitor the color changes every 30 min to control the degree of dyeing.\n\tNOTE: The specific dyeing time is different and needs to be adjusted according to each probe. Incubating the embryos at 37 °C can accelerate the reaction. Incubating the embryos at 4 °C can increase the reaction time and can be done overnight.\nOnce it is developed to the desired extent, stop the reaction by briefly rinsing with NTMT two times. After in situ hybridization, rinse the embryos with PBST thrice for 20 min.\n3. Embedding\nImmerse the embryos in 5% sucrose in 1x PBS (see the Table of Materials) overnight for 12-14 h at 4 °C.\nChange the solution covering the embryos to 15% sucrose in 1x PBS and incubate overnight for 12-16 h at 4 °C.",
    "Change the solution covering the embryos to 30% sucrose in 1x PBS and incubate for 1-2 days at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Incubate in this solution until the embryos sink to the bottom of the tube.\nFill a cryomold with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (see the Table of Materials). Transfer the embryos in 30% sucrose to the cryomold with OCT medium. Stir them to remove the sucrose from the embryos.\nTransfer the embryos to a new cryomold for tissue and gently fill it with OCT medium, avoiding the formation of bubbles.\nSubmerge each embryo, pushing it to the bottom of the cryomold, and place each embryo in the desired orientation (either dorsal-ventral or lateral). Keep the embryos in a straight line.\n\tNOTE: It is strongly recommended to place only one embryo in each cryomold (see the Table of Materials).\nPlace the embedded embryos in cryomolds in a dry ice ethanol bath.\nStore at -80 °C at least overnight for 12-14 h.\n\t​NOTE: The cryomolds can be kept at -80 °C for at least one month.\n4. Cryosectioning\nSet the cryosections using a cryostat to -20 °C.\nRemove the specimen block from the cryomold and place it in the cryostat. Place OCT medium on the base of the chilled chuck and place the block on top.\nEnsure that the specimen block is parallel to the razor blade. Carefully trim off excess OCT medium around the specimen.\nCut into 12-20 µm thick sections using a cryostat. Quickly transfer the sections to glass slides so that each slide has 3-4 sections. Allow the samples to reach room temperature, and store the sections in a sealed slide box at -80 °C for later use.\n5. Immunostaining\nNOTE: GFP staining is performed on the sections.",
    "Wash the slides containing the sections with PBS for 5 min.\nHeat citrate buffer to boiling in a microwave.\nPlace the slides in the buffer and continue to heat to keep the solution near boiling for approximately 20 min.\n\tNOTE: This step helps in antigen retrieval. The tissue remains intact even at high temperatures, which improves staining quality by preventing folding, damage, or detachment of the tissues.\nLet the samples cool slowly to room temperature prior to the next step. Drain the excess solution, carefully dry the area around each section with a piece of tissue, and draw a circle around the section with a water-repellant pen (see the Table of Materials) to form a hydrophobic barrier. Be careful not to dry the tissue sections.\nWash the slides two times with PBS, incubating for 10 min during each wash.\nBlock for 2 h in blocking solution-2 (see the Table of Materials) at room temperature.\nPipette primary antibody solution (mouse monoclonal α-GFP, 1:250, see the Table of Materials) per slide and incubate the slides in an immunohistochemical wet box at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the slides three times with PBS, incubating for 10 min during each wash.\nDrain excess PBS. Incubate the slides with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:400, see the Table of Materials) for 1 h at room temperature in PBS.\nWash the slides three times with PBS, incubating for 10 min during each wash.\nDrain the excess PBS, pipette the mounting medium onto the slide, and mount with a slide coverslip.\nSubscription Required.
