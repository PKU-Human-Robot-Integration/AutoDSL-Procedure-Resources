    "1. Total RNA extraction and purification\nNOTE: Always work under the fume hood as this method involves the use of harmful volatile organic solvents. Pre-warm a microfuge tube of nuclease-free water in 50 °C heat block before commencing the experiment. This nuclease-free water will be used to elute the total RNA from spin column in Step 1.8.\nSeparately ground the samples, each with at least three biological replicates, into a fine powder using a sterilized mortar and pestle that are pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen.\n\t\nScoop the powdered samples using a small metal spatula dipped in liquid nitrogen and place the powdered samples in 2.0 mL nuclease-free microfuge tubes, also pre-dipped in liquid nitrogen. Immediately store the samples in ultralow temperature freezer (-80 °C) until the day allocated for batch RNA extraction (STOP POINT).\n\t\tNOTE: Seed samples can be ground into fine powder with or without dehusking. For rice, we routinely grind the samples without dehusking because the husk contains silica that can aid during the grinding process.\n\t\tCAUTION: This step must be done fast and under strictly cryogenic conditions. One option for automation is to grind the samples using a cryogenic ball mill to minimize RNA degradation and quality deterioration.\nObtain a crude RNA extract using approximately 200 mg of the original powdered sample. Individually add each sample to a nuclease-free microfuge tube containing 750 µL of RNA Extraction Buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM LiCl, 50 mM EDTA, 1.5% SDS, 1.5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and 500 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl (25:24:1).\n\t\nMix all samples at the same time for 5 min at room temperature using a multi-tube vortex mixer set at high speed. Immediately keep all tubes on ice for two min.",
    "CAUTION: Always work inside the fume hood, especially for all steps involving phenol, chloroform and other organic solvents. Ideally, use a wide fume hood that can accommodate one benchtop centrifuge, vortex mixer, multi-tube vortex mixer, and multi-tube rotary mixer.\nSeparate the crude RNA extract from the debris by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 10 min. Do all centrifugation steps in the same settings for this section.\n\t\nTransfer approximately 800 µL of supernatant to a new 2.0 mL microfuge tube containing 400 µL of 1.2 M NaCl and 700 µL of isopropanol. Mix the solution gently by inversion 5x.\nPrecipitate the RNA by incubating in a regular (-20 °C) or ultralow temperature freezer (-80 °C), for at least 1 h (or overnight).\n\t\tSTOP or PAUSE point: just keep the samples in regular -20 °C freezer to pause for a few hours. For overnight or a longer stop point, store the samples in ultralow temperature freezer (-80 °C).\nObtain a crude RNA pellet by centrifugation at 18,800 x g for 15 min. After discarding the supernatant, purify the crude RNA pellet by column purification using a Mini Kit (Table of Materials).\n\t\nDissolve the pellet in freshly prepared 450 µL of RLT Buffer (prior to use, add 100 µL of β-mercaptoethanol per 100 mL of RLT buffer, prepared fresh daily). Enhance the dissolution of all pellets by mixing all tubes at room temperature in a multi-tube vortex mixer for at least 5 min.\nPurify the dissolved RNA pellet by passing through the purple mini spin column with a 2 mL collection tube. Centrifuge at room temperature for 1 min at 9,000 x g and discard the purple mini spin column.",
    "Add 0.5 volume of absolute ethanol (~225 µL) to the cleared lysate in the 2 mL collection tube. Mix the solution using the same plastic tip by pipetting up and down a few times.\nCollect the purified RNA by immediately transferring the solution to a pink mini spin column with a 2 mL collection tube. Centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 15 s to collect the RNA onto the silica membrane of the pink min spin column. Discard flow through and wash the RNA with 350 µL of Buffer RW1 by centrifugation at 9,000 x g for 15 s.\nRemove contaminating genomic DNA by adding 80 µL of diluted DNase 1 (50 µL of frozen DNase stock + 350 µL of RDD using the DNase set) directly onto the membrane and digest by incubating at room temperature for at least 15 min (PAUSE POINT).\n\t\nWash off the DNase 1 by adding 350 µL of RW1 and spinning down at 9,000 x g for 15 s. Repeat twice, but this time wash with 500 µL of Buffer RPE. Transfer to a new 2 mL collection tube and spin at 9,000 x g for 2 min to dry.\nTransfer the dried spin column to a new 1.5 mL nuclease-free collection tube. Begin the elution process for the purified RNA extract by adding 50 µL of nuclease-free water (prewarmed at 50 °C) and incubating for 3 min at 50 °C heat block.\n\t\nAfter incubation, elute the total RNA extract by centrifuging at 9,000 x g for 1 min. Immediately place all samples on ice.",
    "Determine the quantity and quality of the total RNA extract by running appropriate dilutions (usually 1:10) in Nanodrop and BioAnalyzer using their respective manufacturer protocols. RNA extracts should at least have a RIN value of 8.0 and a concentration of 50 ng/µL. Figure 1 shows a typical result for RNA extracts obtained from barley leaf and seeds.\n\tSTOP POINT: Store the samples in -80 °C until use.\n2. cDNA synthesis followed by cRNA transcription and labelling\nNOTE: This step is suitable for processing 24 samples simultaneously. It is suggested that the entire step is conducted continuously in one day, but optional stop and pause points are identified. Be sure to pre-warm three microfuge tube heat blocks at 80 °C, 65 °C, and 37 °C before commencing the steps below. These temperature settings will be changed as noted in the steps below. For instance, the 37 °C heat block will be set to 40 °C after the Spike Mix is prepared (or if it has already been previously prepared). Prepare one-color Spike Mix, T7 Promoter Mix and cDNA master mix using the Low Input Quick Amp Gene Expression Labeling Kit (see Table of Materials) based on the manufacturer's instructions. This preparation is dependent on the amount of starting RNA extracts, which usually range from 10 to 200 ng for total RNA or 5 ng for PolyA RNA. We routinely use 50 ng total RNA as starting material for microarray hybridization2 and for the method that will be described below. In preparing a master mix for 24 samples, add 2 extra reactions to account for pipetting variations. Always use nuclease-free microfuge tubes and nuclease-free water in this step.",
    "Due to high yield, typically dilute the RNA extract 100-fold to fit within the 50-100 ng range. Based on the RNA quantification results in Step 1.9, make a 1:100 dilution by adding 1 µL of purified RNA extract to 99 µL of nuclease-free water in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube. Determine the actual concentration of this dilution using a Nanodrop.\n\t\nMake a second dilution of each total RNA sample in 1.5 mL microfuge tube to make 50 ng of total RNA in a final volume of 1.5 µL. Keep all samples on ice.\nPrepare the Spike Mix from based on manufacturer's instructions. This step is also summarized in Püffeld et al. 20192. Use a 37 °C heat block for this. Store the first and second dilution of the one-color spike mix positive controls in an ultralow temperature freezer (-80 °C) and only go through eight repeated freeze/thaw cycles.\n\t\nPrepare the third and fourth dilution fresh daily. Thaw and store the third and fourth dilution of spike mix on ice before use.\n\t\tNOTE: Convert the temperature of the 37 °C heat block to 40 °C when the Spike Mix had been prepared (or if it was previously prepared).\nPrepare the T7 Promoter Mix and store on ice prior to use. The following is sufficient for 24 samples:\n\t20.8 µL of T7 promoter primer\n\t+ 26.0 µL of nuclease-free water\n\t= 46.8 µL of total volume T7 Promoter Mix\nAdd 1.8 µL of T7 Promoter Primer Mix (Step 2.3) into each microfuge tube containing 1.5 µL of 50 ng RNA sample from Step 2.1. Mix the components properly by pipetting several times. Denature the RNA template-primer mix by incubating in 65 °C heat block for 10 min. Immediately place the microfuge tubes on ice in preparation for the next step.",
    "While denaturing the template-primer mix (Step 2.4), pre-warm the 5x First Strand Buffer at 80 °C for at least 4 min. Quickly prepare the cDNA synthesis Master Mix from the Low Input Quick Amp Labelling Kit (see Table of Materials) based on manufacturer's instructions. The following is sufficient for 24 reactions:\n\t52.0 µL of Pre-warmed 5x First Strand Buffer (Step 2.5)\n\t+ 26.0 µL of 0.1M DTT\n\t+ 13.0 µL of 10 mM dNTP mix\n\t+ 31.2 µL of RNase Block Mix\n\t= 122.2 µL of total volume cDNA synthesis Master Mix\n\t\nThaw each component on ice. Mix each component by gentle pipetting. Keep the Master Mix at room temperature prior to use.\n\t\tCAUTION: The RNase Block Mix should be immediately placed back in the -20 °C freezer after use.\nRemove the RNA template-primer mix on ice (Step 2.4) and centrifuge briefly at room temperature to spin down all the contents to the bottom of the microfuge tube. Dispense 4.7 µL of the cDNA Master Mix (Step 2.5) to each tube, mixing carefully by pipetting up and down. The total volume when all components are added should be 8.0 µL.\n\t\nSynthesize the cDNA for 2 h in 40 °C heat block. During the 2 h incubation, shift the temperature of the 65 °C heat block to 70 °C in preparation for heat inactivation (Step 2.7).\n\t\tOPTIONAL PAUSE POINT: Store the samples at -80 °C overnight. The experiment can be continued the next day after heat inactivation (Step 2.7).\nIncubate each tube in 70 °C heat block for 15 min to heat-inactivate the RNase Block Mix. Transfer the tubes on ice immediately and incubate for at least 5 min.",
    "While the samples are on ice for 5 min (Step 2.7), quickly prepare the Transcription Master Mix. All components can be combined at room temperature but thaw components on ice. The following is sufficient for 24 samples:\n\t19.5 µL of nuclease-free water\n\t+ 83.2 µL of 5x Transcription Buffer\n\t+ 15.6 µL of 0.1M DTT\n\t+ 26.0 µL of NTP mix\n\t+ 5.5 µL of T7 RNA Polymerase Blend\n\t+ 6.2 µL of Cyanine 3-CTP (Cy3)\n\t= 156.0 µL of total volume Transcription Master Mix\n\tCAUTION: The T7 RNA Polymerase Blend should be kept in the -20 °C freezer and placed back immediately after use. Moreover, Cy3 is light sensitive. Hence, mixing (Step 2.9) and dispensing (Step 2.10) should be done in low light conditions. For this, we usually turn off any light directly above the lab bench.\nAs the tubes were subjected to abrupt heating and cooling (Step 2.7), briefly spin down the contents of each sample using a microcentrifuge to collect all the liquid at the bottom of each microfuge tube. Add 6 µL of Transcription Master Mix (Step 2.8) by gently pipetting up and down. The total volume of this reaction should be 16 µL at this stage. Incubate the tubes at 40 °C for 2 h to generate the Cy3-labeled cRNA.\n\tOPTIONAL STOP POINT: The tubes can be stored at -80 °C after transcription.\nWhile generating the cRNA (Step 2.9), set the temperature of the heat block to 55 °C. Add at least one microfuge tube of nuclease-free water in the heat block. This nuclease-free water will be used for the elution of purified cRNA.\nAfter cRNA transcription and labeling, purify the labelled cRNA using a RNeasy Mini Kit as detailed in Step 3.\n3. cRNA Purification",
    "Purify the labelled cRNA using a RNeasy Mini Kit (see Table of Materials). Prepare the buffers based on manufacturer's instructions. For instance, Buffer RPE is supplied in the kit in concentrated form. Prior to use, add 4 volumes of molecular biology grade absolute ethanol (96-100%).\nAdd 84 µL of nuclease-free water to each sample to adjust the total volume to 100 µL. Then add 350 µL of Buffer RLT and 250 µL of absolute ethanol to each tube. Mix thoroughly by pipetting.\nTransfer 700 µL of each mixture onto an the mini spin column with a 2 mL collection tube. Collect the labelled cRNA onto the membrane by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 s at 7,534 x g. Discard the flow-through liquid.\nWash each sample in 500 µL of Buffer RPE. Centrifuge and discard flow-through as in the previous step. Repeat this step once, then move to the next step.\nTransfer the mini spin column into a new collection tube. Dry the samples by centrifugation as in Step 3.3.\nTransfer the mini spin column into a nuclease-free 1.5 mL microfuge tube that is supplied with the kit. Elute each labelled cRNA sample by adding 30 µL of nuclease-free water (pre-warmed at 55 °C) directly into the membrane filter. Enhance elution by incubating in 55 °C heat block for 60 s.\nCollect the labelled cRNA by centrifugation at room temperature for 30 s at 7,535 x g. Discard the spin column and close each microfuge tube. Immediately place each tube on ice.\n\tOPTIONAL STOP POINT: The samples can be stored at -80 °C after elution.",
    "Quantify the cRNA with Nanodrop using the microarray feature. Set the sample to RNA-40. Obtain the following values and record in a spreadsheet: cyanine 3 dye concentration (pmol/µL), RNA absorbance ratio (260 nm/280 nm), and cRNA concentration (ng/µL).\n\tSTOP POINT: Immediately store the cRNA samples at -80 °C after reading.\nCompute the cRNA yield and the specific activity as detailed in Püffeld et al. 20192.\n4. Microarray hybridization and scanning\nNOTE: This step only takes 3-4 h and hence hybridization of 24 samples can be started after lunch. One operator can comfortably run up to 4 slides (32 samples). The morning of the following day is allocated for washing and scanning of microarray slides. Additional runs can then be performed in the afternoon of the second day. This step is repeated until all samples are hybridized and scanned. It is highly recommended to use color-free, powder-free latex gloves for handling and processing the slides to ensure that the samples are not contaminated with colored pigments that can interfere with the microarray analyses. Aside from commercially available microarrays, the following custom arrays are designed by our group and available for order from Agilent: Order Code 028827 for Barley (Hordeumvulgare), 054269 for Rice (Oryzasativa subs. Japonica), 054270 for Rice (Oryzasativa subs. Indica) and 048923 for Wheat (Triticumaestivum).\nPerform microarray hybridization using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (see Table of Materials). Prepare 10x Blocking Agent according to manufacturer's specification2. Aliquot the 10x Blocking Agent into 200 µL portions and store at -20 °C until use. Each aliquot is enough for up to 40 hybridizations and is stable up to 2 months.",
    "On the day allocated for microarray hybridization, thaw one 200 µL aliquot of 10x Blocking Agent on ice. In addition, pre-warm the hybridization oven to 65 °C and pre-warm a heat block to 60 °C for use during cRNA fragmentation.\nPrepare the Fragmentation Mix for each sample as described by the manufacturer2. In our lab, we routinely use 600 ng of linearly amplified Cy3-labeled cRNA for hybridization in an 8-pack microarray. In this case, the list below summarizes the components of the Fragmentation Mix per sample:\n\t600 ng of linearly amplified cRNA, cyanine 3-labeled\n\t+ 5 µL of 10x Blocking Agent\n\tAdjust volume to 24 µL with nuclease-free water\n\t+ 1 µL of 25x Fragmentation Buffer\n\t= 25 µL of total volume Fragmentation Mix\n\t\nMix samples gently using a vortex mixer. Spin all samples briefly using a microcentrifuge.\nIncubate all the samples in the 60 °C heat block for exactly 30 min. Immediately cool each tube on ice for one min then quickly proceed to the next step.\nTo fully stop the fragmentation reaction, add 2x GEx Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM to each tube. Mix gently by pipetting up and down, taking great care not to introduce any bubbles during mixing. We routinely use 25 µL of Hybridization Buffer to stop the fragmentation reaction for the 8-pack microarray format.\nCentrifuge all tubes for 1 min at 15,750 x g in ambient room temperature. Quickly place all tubes on ice and load each sample as fast as possible.\nBefore leaving the lab for the 17 h overnight incubation, prepare the hybridization assembly2 as detailed in the video.",
    "CRITICAL STEP: Transfer each hybridization mix and dispense slowly in the center of each gasket well, observing great care not to introduce any bubbles during dispensing. We routinely use 44 µL of hybridization mix for the 8-pack microarray format. Also place 44 µL of 1x Hybridization Buffer in any unused wells.\nImmediately put the microarray slide with correct orientation on top of the gasket slide. This needs to be done very carefully in order not to spill any liquid. Close the hybridization assembly tightly and rotate it to check if no permanent air bubbles have been introduced. All bubbles should be moving within the gasket slide.\nPut the hybridization chamber assembly in the hybridization oven rotator. If using the 2x GEx Hybridization Buffer, set the rotation speed to 10 rpm and hybridize at 65 °C for exactly 17 h.\nWash hybridized microarrays using the Gene Expression Wash Buffer Kit (see Table of Materials). Prepare the Gene Expression Wash Buffers 1 and 2 based on manufacturer's instructions2. Add 2 mL of 10% Triton X-102 to both buffers (purely optional but highly recommended to reduce the incidence of microarray wash artifacts)2.\nPrepare three wash chamber assemblies as detailed in the previous publication2. Details of each wash chamber is tabulated below (Table 1).\nAliquot 500 mL of Wash Buffer 1 in a 1 L reagent bottle and leave at ambient room temperature. Prepare an extra 1 L reagent bottle and label with \"Wash Buffer 1 Reuse\" to save the wash buffer from the first chamber. Additionally, aliquot 500 mL of Wash Buffer 2 in a reagent bottle and incubate in a 37 °C water bath overnight.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave the lab without preparing Steps 4.9 to 4.11. They are necessary for the washing steps the next day.",
    "The next day, prepare the wash buffers as detailed in Table 2. Fill each dish to three fourths of their corresponding buffer. Each wash buffer is good for up to 4-5 slides.\nAfter exactly 17 h of hybridization, get one hybridization chamber and disassemble on the lab bench lined with lint-free paper as detailed in the previous publication2.\n\t\nCRITICAL STEP: Transfer the microarray sandwich to Dish 1. Ensure that the microarray barcode is facing up in a slanted position, and avoid submerging the entire slide in the buffer. Handle each microarray slide from their ends and avoid touching the active side of the slide.\nSeparate the two glass slides using a forceps2. Let the gasket slide drop gently into the bottom of Dish 1, while at the same time ensuring that the microarray slide is held firmly for the next step.\nCRITICAL STEP: Slowly lift the microarray slides sideways and immediately transfer into the microarray rack in Dish 2 as detailed in the previous publication2. It is critical that the microarray slides are minimally exposed to air.\n\t\nRepeat Steps 4.13 and 4.14 until the eight slides are in the rack. Distribute the microarray slides evenly along the rack. This step can be done by one operator unassisted for up to 4 slides. Attach the rack holder and transfer the entire Dish 2 setup to the first magnetic stirrer. Stir gently for exactly 1 min.\nWhile stirring for 1 min (Step 4.14), transfer Dish 3 from the mini 37 °C incubator and place on top of the second magnetic stirrer. Gently place Wash Buffer 2 (from the 37 °C water bath) on Dish 3. Avoid bubble formation while pouring.",
    "After 1 min stirring is done (Step 4.14), gently and slowly lift the slide rack from Dish 2 and transfer to Dish 3. Remove the rack holder and stir for exactly 1 min.\nSlowly and gently lift the slide rack from Dish 3. Be sure to avoid the formation of buffer droplets2. Dry the sides of each slide by gently touching on lint-free paper. Place each blot-dried slide in a slide box and repeat step 4.16 until all microarray slides are in the slide box. Dry for approximately 15 min.\n\tOPTIONAL STOP POINT\nPlace each microarray slide in a slide holder, ensuring that the barcode is facing up.\n\tNOTE: The ozone levels inside the microarray room should be 50 ppb (100 µg/m3) or less. This is purely optional but is highly recommended: use an Ozone Barrier Slide Cover to avoid ozone-induced degradation of cyanine dyes.\nPlace the assembled slide holders into the scanning carousel. Load the samples in sequence, based on barcode number. Scan the slides immediately using a microarray scanner (see Table of Materials), as detailed in the previous publication2.\nAfter the run, subject the data to feature extraction and QC validation, as detailed in the previous publication2."
