    "1. SDS-PAGE and transfer to a PVDF membrane\nPerform SDS-PAGE to separate proteins based on relative size.\n\tNOTE: Any commercial or home-made gel system is fine. Please follow the manufacturer’s protocol.\nTransfer separated proteins from a gel onto a PVDF membrane.\n\tNOTE: Common transfer methods (semi-dry or wet transfer) are suitable. Please follow the manufacturer’s protocol.\n2. Blocking of PVDF membranes\nIncubate the membranes in appropriate blocking buffers for 1 h with agitation at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the primary antibody and detection system, an appropriate blocking buffer should be selected. For example, the most typical blockers are BSA, nonfat dry milk, casein, and commercial synthetic polymers. PBS and/or TBS with 0.1% Tween20 are the most commonly used buffers. This blocking step may be done overnight at 4 ˚C.\n3. Incubation with primary antibody\nPrepare 10% immunoreaction enhancing agent-1 solution (IRE-1) with distilled water. Vortex well.\nPrepare the diluted primary antibody with 10% IRE-1. Mix it gently and thoroughly.\nIf using a larger membrane (4 cm x 8 cm – 8 cm x 8 cm), add 8 mL of the antibody solution into 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes. If using a smaller membrane (2 cm x 8 cm – 4 cm x 8 cm), add 3 mL of the antibody solution into 14 mL round-bottom polypropylene tube (Table of Materials).\nPick up the PVDF membrane with tweezers and drain the blocking solution briefly. Insert the PVDF membrane into this tube with gloved fingers and ensure that the entire membrane adheres to the wall of the tube. When the PVDF membrane is inserted into a tube, face the “protein side” of the membrane that was originally in contact with the gel inward. Close the cap tightly.\nInsert the 50 mL tube into a glass bottle for the hybridization oven.",
    "NOTE: When 14 mL tubes are used for this incubation, insert a 14 mL tube into the 50 mL tube, using a pair of plastic ring holders to keep the inner tube in the center of the 50 mL tube.\nTurn on the hybridization oven.\nIncubate the membrane with 6 rpm rotation for at least 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the membrane adheres to the wall at all times and that the (inner) tube is horizontal to cover the membrane with the antibody solution evenly. Calibrate the dilution of the antibody and incubation time prior to the actual experiment.\n4. Membrane wash\nStop the rotation.\nCarefully remove the PVDF membrane from the tube with tweezers, and place the membrane into a container with 50 mL of PBS-T.\nRinse the membrane briefly with PBS-T.\nRinse the membrane in the container with distilled water until no bubbles appear. This is to remove the majority of the antibody.\nTransfer the PVDF membrane from the container to the salad spinner that contains 250 mL of PBS-T.\nPlace the strainer basket in the spinner. Ensure that the lid has been put on securely.\nActivate the spinner and run it for about 20-30 s.\nDiscard the solution and briefly rinse the inside of the spinner with distilled water.\nAdd 250 mL of PBS-T into the spinner again.\nRepeat steps 4.6 and 4.7.\n5. Incubation with the secondary antibody\nPrepare 10% immunoreaction enhancing agent-2 solution (IRE-2) with distilled water. Vortex well.\nPrepare the diluted secondary antibody with 10% IRE-2. Mix it gently and thoroughly.\nSelect the volume of the antibody solution and tube as stated in step 3.3.\nPick up the PVDF membrane with tweezers and drain the solution briefly. Insert the PVDF membrane into the tube as stated in step 3.4.",
    "Insert the 50 mL tube into a glass bottle for the hybridization oven.\nTurn on the hybridization oven.\nIncubate the membrane with 6 rpm rotation for at least 5 min. Make sure that the membrane adheres to the wall at all times and that the (inner) tube is horizontal to evenly cover the membrane with the antibody solution.\n\tNOTE: Calibrate the incubation time prior to the actual experiment. When the secondary antibody is fluorescently conjugated, perform the incubation in the dark.\n6. Membrane wash\nFollow steps 4.1 to 4.10.\n7. Image acquisition\nChemiluminescent detection\n\t\nPlace a piece of semi-transplant flexible film (10 cm x 15 cm) on a flat surface.\nMix 2 components of the chemiluminescent substrate in a 5 mL tube.\nImmediately transfer 1.5 mL of the mixed substrate to the semi-transplant flexible film and place the PVDF membrane upon it. Then, transfer the rest of the substrate solution onto the membrane.\nIncubate the PVDF membrane with the mixed substrate on a semi-transparent flexible film for 1 min.\nPick up the PVDF membrane with tweezers and drain the substrate solution briefly.\nSandwich the membrane between a pair of transparency films.\nAcquire the image under chemiluminescent mode.\nFluorescent detection\n\t\nPick up the PVDF membrane with tweezers and drain the solution briefly.\nSandwich the membrane between a pair of transparency films.\nAcquire the image under fluorescent mode.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 7.1 and 7.2 should be performed in close proximity to the imaging machine to ensure maximum sensitivity.\nWhen the background signal is high, perform a washing step in a container with 80-100 mL of PBS-T: 10 min rinse 3 times for the primary antibody and 5 min rinse 6 times for the secondary antibody.",
    "NOTE: Both primary and secondary antibodies diluted with 10% IRE solutions can be used up to 8-10 times without loss of sensitivity6. The solution should be kept at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
