    "Production of SARS-CoV-2 PV via plasmid co-transfection of 293T cells (4-5 days)Note: All steps should be carried out in a class II biosafety cabinet to avoid contamination. Day 1: 293T/17 cells should be sub-cultured into 6-well plates at a ratio that will deliver 70-90% confluence at the time of transfection (Day 2). Typically seeding 4 × 105 cells per well will achieve this level of confluency. An example of what the cells should look like is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4236/bioprotoc-11-21-4236-g002.jpgFigure 2. Example of the confluency expected prior to transfection of HEK293T/17 cells with plasmids Day 2: DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S and Opti-MEM® should be pre-warmed to 37°C using a water bath or an incubator.Prepare two labeled sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (tube 1 and tube 2) for each well of a 6-well plate which will be used for transfections.Add the following plasmid constructs (in a total volume of 15 µl) for transfection to tube 1:pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2 or pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) spike: 450 ng.p8.91-lentiviral vector: 500 ng.pCSFLW: 750 ng.Note: Volume of each individual plasmid determined by its concentration. Add 100 µl Opti-MEM® to the plasmid DNA mix (tube 1).Add 100 µl Opti-MEM® and FuGENEHD to tube 2.Incubation step: Mix both tubes by gently flicking and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT).After incubation, pipette the Opti-MEM®/FuGeneHD solution from tube 2 into the Opti-MEM®/DNA solution in tube 1.Incubation step: Incubate the tube at RT for 20 min whilst gently flicking the tube to mix every 3-4 min.Whilst the transfection mix is incubating, the culture media on the 293T/17 cells should be removed and 2 ml of fresh prewarmed DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S added per well. It is imperative at this point to add culture media slowly to one side of the well to avoid detaching the adherent cell monolayer.",
    "After 20 min incubation, pipette the DNA/Opti-MEM®/FuGeneHD solution onto the 293T/17 cells (in one well of a 6-well plate) by adding dropwise throughout the total surface area of the well. Swirl the 6-well plate (s) gently to ensure an even dispersal of reagent mix.Incubation step: Incubate the plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 44-52 h. In our hands, incubation times in this range result in equivalent final PV production relative luminescence unit (RLU) titres.After overnight incubation (on Day 3), the culture media on the cells should be carefully removed and 2 ml fresh DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S added. Again, add media slowly to one side of the well to avoid cell detachment.Day 4: Supernatant containing the viral pseudotype particles are harvested using a 3 ml sterile syringe and subsequently filtered into microcentrifuge or Falcon tubes via a syringe driven 0.45 µm filter.Store all filtered supernatants at -80°C until downstream use. It is recommended that supernatant is stored as aliquots to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles that may impact viral RLU titres.Optional step (Day 4): 2 ml fresh culture media may be added to cells to allow a second harvest 18-24 h later (Day 5) by adding further DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S. In this case, extreme care must be taken in initial PV collection (step 14 above) to avoid damage to the cell monolayer by aspirating with a sterile syringe to one side of the well. We have observed that cells in poor health after the first harvest result in significantly lower PV production RLU titres upon the second harvest.Note: A control pseudotype virus can be created by following the steps outlined above but omitting the pCAGGS-SARS-CoV spike construct. This produces particles that do not express a viral surface glycoprotein (Delta S PV control).",
    "Preparation of target cells for titration and neutralisation assays (1 day)Note: SARS-CoV-2 virus host cell entry depends on receptor ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming (Hoffmann et al., 2020). HEK293T/17 are transfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 plasmids to be used as optimal target cells for SARS-CoV-2 PV entry. It is therefore essential to pre-transfect the cells whether a PV titration or neutralisation assay is planned. HEK 293T/17 cells should be seeded into a 10 cm cell culture dish at a ratio that will deliver 70-90% confluence at the time of transfection. Typically seeding 2 × 106 cells/plate and incubated overnight at 37°C will achieve this level of confluency.DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S and Opti-MEM® should be pre-warmed to 37°C using a water bath or an incubator.Prepare one sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for each cell culture dish which will be used for transfections.Add the following plasmid constructs (in a total volume of 15 µl in molecular biology grade water) for transfection (DNA mix):pCDNA3.1+-ACE2 cell entry receptor: 2 µgpCAGGS-TMPRSS2 serine protease: 150 ngNote: Plasmid amounts required are determined by prior optimization. Add 100 µl Opti-MEM® to the plasmid DNA mix.Incubation step: Mix tube by gently flicking and incubate for 5 min at RT.After incubation, add 9 µl FuGENE® HD directly into the Opti-MEM®/DNA solution tube just below the surface.Mix by gently flicking the tube.Incubation step: Incubate the tube at RT for 20 min whilst gently flicking the tube to mix every 3-4 min.Whilst the transfection mix is incubating, the culture media on the 293T/17 cells should be removed and 10 ml of fresh DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S added per dish. It is imperative at this point to add culture media slowly to one side of the well to avoid detaching the adherent cell monolayer.",
    "After 20 min incubation, pipette the DNA/Opti-MEM®/ FuGENE® HD solution onto the 293T/17 cells by adding dropwise throughout the total surface area of the dish. Swirl the 10 cm cell culture dish(es) gently to ensure an even dispersal of reagent mix.Incubation step: Incubate the plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 overnight (16-24 h). In our hands, this incubation time results in sufficient overexpression of cell entry receptors (ACE2/TMPRSS2) for SARS-CoV-2 PV entry.SARS-CoV-2 PV Titration for the calculation of relative light units (RLU)/mlNotes:  Titration consists of transduction of reporter (in this case firefly luciferase, but GFP may be used) into target cells mediated by the viral glycoprotein expressed on the viral pseudotype (SARS-CoV-2 spike). Target cells are transfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 24 h prior to the titration. Efficiency of the transfection of ACE2/TMPRSS2 was consistently reproducible between several operators and different laboratories; in the rare occasion of a suboptimal transfection, the PV titers dropped dramatically, making results unusable. Controls for titration are provided via the inclusion of ‘cell only’ and ‘Delta S’ (no Spike plasmid) columns. Positive control for transduction can be provided via a PV bearing the Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), which utilises a ubiquitous receptor that results in high RLU titres in all cell lines tested. In a 96-well white plate, add 50 µl of DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S to the entire columns of ‘cell only’ controls (see Figure 3, columns 9-11).Add 50 µl of DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S from rows B to H that are to contain PV or Delta S control virus.Add 100 µl of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus supernatant to each well of row A (excluding cell only control columns) and add 100 µl of Delta S to column 12 (see Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4236/bioprotoc-11-21-4236-g003.jpgFigure 3. 96-well plate set-up for pseudotype titration.",
    "Serial dilution step showing addition of 100 µl of pseudotype virus supernatant to each well of row A and dilution of 50 µl taken from this well to row B. This process is continued to end of plate (row H), at which point the final 50 µl is discarded. Delta S control is indicated in red (column 12), and cell only controls are indicated in blue (columns 9-11). One set of pipette tips can be used per dilution series (plate).With the aid of a 12-channel pipette, remove 50 µl from row A virus-containing wells and perform two-fold serial dilutions down all the wells beneath it.With each dilution step, mix at least five times by pipetting up and down and taking care not to produce air bubbles.After completing serial dilution, the final 50 µl from the final well of each column should be discarded.Note: At this point, each well should contain 50 µl of PV supernatant only (row A) or mixed and diluted with DMEM (rows B to H). Prepare a plate of susceptible target cells (HEK 293T/17 expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 PV):Remove culture media from plate.Wash the plate twice with 2 ml of PBS to one side of the dish to avoid cell detachment and discard.Add 2 ml of trypsin to the plate and put the plate into the incubator until the cells are detached (about 5 min).After cells have detached, add 6 ml of DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S to the plate to quench trypsin activity and resuspend cells gently.Count cells using TC20TM Automated Cell Counter or counting-chamber slide and add 1 × 104 cells in a total volume of 50 µl to each well.Centrifuge plate for 1 min at 500 rpm if there are visible droplets on the sides of the wells.",
    "Incubate the plate for 48 h at 37°C 5% CO2.Read plate using Bright GloTM luciferase assay system on a GloMax® Navigator Microplate Luminometer (or equivalent) by removing the medium from all wells and adding 25 µl of a 1:1 mix of PBS:Bright GloTM luciferase assay reagent.Data analysisRLU readings from the luminometer are multiplied to get RLU/ml by the dilution factor of each well (20×, 40×, 80×, 160×, 320×, 640×, 1,280×, 2,560×). The mean of all 8 RLU/ml values is used as the final value reported for that column in the titration step. A linear relationship should be observed between RLU values and PV dilution, with values decreasing by 50% after each 1:2 dilution. Care should be taken to check this linear relationship before multiplication, as this inherently can lead to false production titres being calculated (Table 1).Table 1. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 PV titration data and calculation of RLU/ml. RLU values (Top panel) are multiplied to give an RLU/ml value for each of the dilution points (Bottom panel). The mean/average is then calculated from all eight dilution points (expressed as RLU/ml). Care must be taken to observe a linear relationship between dilution factor (X factor) and RLU, or multiplication can lead to inflated RLU/ml values. Analysis is performed on Microsoft Excel (Microsoft®). For SARS-CoV-2 PV optimal production titre in this experiment (3.1 × 108 RLU/ml) is achieved when both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are present in the target cells (column 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211102/20211102210104_2155.png Results (Figure 4)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4236/bioprotoc-11-21-4236-g004.jpgFigure 4.

    "Alternatively, MERS-CoV-2 PV may be titrated on 293T cells that have been pre-transfected with a DPP4 plasmid.Pseudotype based neutralisation assay (pMN)Note: pMN is the Inhibition of PV mediated transduction via an antibody (or inhibitor) directed against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. In a 96-well white plate with the aid of a multichannel pipette, add 50 µl of DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S to rows B to H, columns 1-12.Add known amount of antibody (for example, 5 µl convalescent sera or mAb at 10 µg/ml) into wells of row A, columns 2-10 in a total volume of 100 µl DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S. Add known amount (e.g., 5 µl) of positive and negative antisera into wells A11 and A12 as controls.Remove 50 µl from row A wells and perform two-fold serial dilutions down all the wells beneath it.With each dilution step, use a multichannel pipette to mix 5-10 times by pipetting up and down and taking care not to produce air bubbles.After completing serial dilution, the final 50 µl from the final well of each column should be discarded.Note: At this point, each well should contain 50 µl of mixed DMEM and serial dilutions of antibody/inhibitor. Centrifuge plate for 1 min at 500 rpm to ensure no inhibitor or liquid is located on the walls of the well.Using data obtained from the titration (Table 1), calculate the amount of DMEM required to dilute your SARS-CoV-2 PV to obtain 1 × 106 RLU in 50 µl, with a total volume of 5 ml. For example, with an RLU/ml of 1 × 108, 1 ml of PV should be mixed with 4 ml of DMEM.Mix this diluted PV solution in a pipette basin using the multichannel pipette, and aliquot 50 µl into each well on the plate, with the exception of wells A6-A12 (cell only control).",
    "A1-A6 will serve as PV only control.Centrifuge plate for 1 min at 500 rpm to ensure no virus is left on the walls of the well. This is critical to avoid virus spikes in the downstream data.Incubate the plates for 1 h at 37°C 5% CO2, allowing time for the antibody/inhibitor to bind the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein.Prepare a plate of susceptible target cells (HEK 293T/17 for SARS-CoV-2 PV), preferentially transfected 24 h before with ACE2 and TMPRSS2:Remove culture media from plate.Wash the plate twice with 2 ml of PBS to one side of the dish to avoid cell detachment and discard.Add 2 ml of trypsin to the plate and put the plate into the incubator until the cells are detached.After cells have detached add 6 ml of DMEM/10% FBS/1% P/S to the plate to quench trypsin activity and resuspend cells gently.Count cells using TC20TM Automated Cell Counter or counting-chamber slide and add 1 × 104 cells in a total volume of 50 µl to each well.Incubate the plate for 48-72 h at 37°C 5% CO2.Read plate using Bright GloTM luciferase assay system on a GloMax® Navigator Microplate Luminometer (or equivalent) by removing the medium from all wells and adding 25 µl of a 1:1 mix of PBS:Bright GloTM luciferase assay reagent.From the raw data provided by the luminometer, calculate the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) neutralising antibody titres using the previously optimised protocol from our group, which is currently being used by the NIBSC and other stakeholders (Ferrara and Temperton, 2018).Results are shown in Figure 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4236/bioprotoc-11-21-4236-g005.jpgFigure 5.

UK to UK shipment will routinely be <24 h, UK to EU shipment will be <72 h. For international destination shipments that may be >72 h, dry ice shipment or lyophilisation is recommended.Place eight aliquots of 100 µl of SARS-CoV-2 PV (prepared above) at different storage temperature for 24 h or 72 h prior to titration (two aliquots each were kept at RT, +4°C, -20°C or -80°C) (see Figure 6 for results).After 24 h, add four aliquots (one aliquot for each different storage temperature) to row A wells of a 96-well white plate to perform a titration. See Procedure C on how to perform a titration.After 72 h, add the remaining four aliquots at different temperatures to row A wells of a 96-well white plate to perform a titration.

Production titres obtained are equivalent to those obtained for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).Efficient knock-down (neutralisation) of SARS-CoV-2 PV entry into target cells using human convalescent plasma and mAbs demonstrates potential utility for vaccine immunogenicity and mAb/antiviral screening. The use of readily available reagents should facilitate increased reproducibility, both intra- and inter-laboratory, as demonstrated in Figure 6. These pseudotypes can be stored at a range of laboratory temperatures (Figure 6) and may be lyophilised for long term storage and easy global distribution (Figure 7). The plug and play nature of the pseudotype system makes it straightforward to swap out the Spike cassette for a new variant Spike of SARS-CoV-2 or indeed for another coronavirus. It is hoped that this suite of protocols will facilitate the wide-scale adoption of pseudotype technologies for vaccine and therapeutic R&D on emerging coronaviruses of human and animal concern."
