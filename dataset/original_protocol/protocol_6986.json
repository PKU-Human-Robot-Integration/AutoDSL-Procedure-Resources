    "Isolation of mouse snoutsMice used: ChAT(BAC)-eGFP (B6.Cg-Tg(RP23- 268L19-EGFP)2Mik/J), 3-6 months of age of both sexes. All animal care and procedures are approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Brigham and Women’s Hospital.Euthanize the mouse. Spray the fur over the abdomen with 70% EtOH (see Recipe 1). Make a midline abdominal incision with straight scissors to open the abdominal cavity and bleed the mice through puncture of the abdominal aorta. Allow the mouse to bleed for 1-2 min, for blood outflow from the head and avoidance/minimization of further necessity to lyse red blood cells.Decapitate the mouse by cutting off the mandible and separating the head from the rest of the body.Using straight scissors, cut off the tip of the nose and the front incisor teeth. Remove the skin of the head and release the skull from the surrounding muscle and brain tissues.Cut off the zygomatic arches (Figure 1A). Remove the parietal bone. Make longitudinal incisions along the frontal bone, exposing the nasal cavity from the top (Figures 1A-1C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4163/bioprotoc-11-18-4163-g001.jpgFigure 1. Representative images of nasal snout preparation for first digestion with dispase solution. A. The mouse head, released from the surrounding tissues and brain. The bilateral zygomatic arches need to be removed (black lines). The red dotted lines represent the longitudinal lines for further incision along the frontal bone. B. Longitudinal incision along the frontal bone. C. The frontal and nasal bones lifted, and the top of the nasal cavity exposed. D. The snout placed in 2 ml tube with pre-warmed dispase solution.Nasal epithelial cell dissociationPre-warm 750 µl of dispase solution (see Recipe 2) in 2 ml tube at 37°C water bath for 5-10 min. Place the isolated snout into the solution (Figure 1D) and incubate on a shaker at 100 rpm for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Keep the tubes protected from light with foil covers.Reduce the digestion by adding 750 µl of cold DMEM-based stopping solution (see Recipe 3). Place the tubes on ice for 2-5 min.Remove the digested snout out of the tube and place on Petri dish under a dissecting microscope with the palate facing down.Remove the nasal bone comprising the superior wall of the nasal cavity. Now you can visualize the nasal cavity with the overlying mucosa (Figure 2A). Split the nasal cavity into left and right halves through a longitudinal incision along the palate (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4163/bioprotoc-11-18-4163-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative images of single cell preparations from isolated nasal mucosa of the snout. A. A scheme of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, with red color indicating the nasal mucosa coverage. B. The nasal cavity split into right and left halves on a Petri dish. The mucosa was scraped off with scalpel under a dissecting microscope. The red outlines represent the area of the nasal mucosa to be isolated. C. Transfer of the scraped mucosa to a 2 ml tube. D. Flushing of the Petri dish with 750 µl of Tyrode buffer based digesting solution with papain. E. After stopping the digestion and vortexing the sample, trituration of the suspension with 18-gauge needle 8-10 times, followed by trituration with 21-gauge needles for 15-20 times. F. The cell suspension strained through 100 µm filter into a 50 ml conical tube.Scrape the nasal mucosa with a scalpel until no tissue can be visualized under the dissecting microscope except for the bone. Transfer the separated mucosa with the small underlying bones and cartilages to a 2 ml tube (Figure 2C).",
    "Flush the Petri dish with 750 µl of Tyrode buffer based digesting solution with papain (see Recipe 4) and transfer the flushed fluid into the tube containing the nasal mucosa (Figure 2D).Incubate the isolated nasal mucosa in Tyrode based digestion buffer for 40 min at 37°C, shaking at 210 rpm.Vortex the digested tissue at 300 rpm for 10 s. Terminate the digestion by adding cold Tyrode buffer-based stopping solution (see Recipe 5) and placing the sample on ice.Vortex the tissue at 1,000 rpm for 20 s. Triturate the solution with a syringe attached to an 18-gauge needle 8-10 times. Remove the remaining bones and cartilages to avoid clogging the syringe. Switch the needle on the syringe to 21-gauge needle and triturate 15-20 more times (Figure 2E).Pass the suspension through a 100 µm filter into a 50 ml conical tube (Figure 2F). Add 20-25 ml of cold FACS buffer (see Recipe 6).Spin the tube at 350 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Check the tube for the visible pellet. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of FACS buffer and transfer to a 5 ml polystyrene tube. Fill the polystyrene tube with 4 ml of FACS buffer.Spin the tube at 350 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100 µl of FACS buffer.To block Fc receptors, pre-incubate the cell suspension with TruStain FcXTM (anti-mouse CD16/32) antibody; use 1.0 µg of antibody per 106 cells in 100 µl volume for 5-10 min on ice. Washing after this step is not necessary.Incubate the cells with antibodies for 45 min on ice, protected from light. The panel of antibodies used for brush cell identification includes pacific blue anti-mouse CD45 monoclonal antibody at 0.",
    "25 µg per 106 cells in 100 µl volume and allophycocyanin (APC) anti-mouse EpCAM monoclonal antibody at 0.5 µg per 106 cells in 100 µl volume.Wash the cells by resuspending them with 1 ml of FACS buffer and add an additional amount of 3.8-4 ml of cold FACS buffer. Spin at 350 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 300 µl of cold FACS buffer.Perform manual cell counts if not planning on running the whole sample on FACS machine. If the whole sample is collected on the machine, the counting step can be omitted.Add propidium iodide (PI) 5 µg/ml for viability for 2-3 min before FACS."
