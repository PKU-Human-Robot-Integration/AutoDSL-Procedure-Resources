    "The study was approved by the local research ethics committee (number: 1009/2014) and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent to participate in this study.\n1. Patient Education\nDespite any given previous information to the patient, use the first post-surgical consultation/therapy session to thoroughly explain the type of injury, as well as the performed surgery in detail.\nVisualize the nerve transfers, that were performed, on a scheme or print-out from an anatomy figure.\nExplain how the altered neural pathway initially requires thinking of a nerve’s original movement pattern.\nGive the patient a rough rehabilitation plan and an idea of what outcomes might be realistic at what point in time.\nIf the patient suffers from the negative consequences of the injury on a psychological level16,17 or needs support in coping with stress or pain, contact a psychologist.\nAsk the patient to explain the impact of the nerve transfers in their own words to find out how they understood the concept.\nIf necessary, repeat certain explanations and answer open questions.\nIf the rehabilitation institution has a leaflet with the most important facts, hand this over to the patient (see Supplementary File for an example).\nDiscuss a home program with the patient.\nExplain that a high frequency of training is important for good outcomes, and thus home exercises are an integral part of rehabilitation.\nDiscuss with the patient how he/she thinks this can be best approached. Thus, empower the patient to assume responsibility for his/her own rehabilitation.\nHand out the discussed home exercise program in a written form. Make sure it only contains exercises that were previously performed within a therapy session.",
    "In order to preserve adherence over time, regularly ask the patient how he/she feels about the home program and discuss how it should be altered to be feasible and meaningful to the patient.\n2. Enhancing Cortical Re-presentation of the Denervated Body Part\nNOTE: The following rehabilitation techniques promote activation of the denervated motor and sensory cortical areas to regain cortical representation of the paralyzed body part. During this phase no active muscle contraction is possible.\nFollow an approach for lateralization training (left/right discrimination) as described by Mosely et al.18.\nPrepare cards showing left and right extremities in a random order (upper extremity, if the upper extremity is affected and lower extremity for lower extremity nerve injuries). Show them to the patient in a random order.\nAsk the patient if a left or a right extremity is shown. While speed of approximately 2 s/card is normal18, give the patient at least 15 s to answer, if needed.\nGive the patient feedback, and if necessary, time to understand why the answer was wrong.\nDo this for 5 to 10 min to avoid fatigue. Ask the patient to do this at home as well, twice a day for 5-10 min.\nInstruct the patient to imagine movements of the paralyzed body part, although no motor output is expected.\nMake sure that the patient is in a calm environment without any distraction.\nAsk the patient which movements of the paralyzed extremity are easy to imagine.\nInstruct the patient to imagine these movements for about 5 min with the exact timing depending on the patient’s ability to fully concentrate on these imagined movements.\nWithin the treatment process, instruct the patient to imagine more complex motions as well.\nAs a home exercise, ask the patient to imagine these movements 5 to 10 min, twice a day.",
    "Use the mirror therapy to create the illusion of active movement of the paralyzed part19,20.\nPlace a standing mirror or a mirror box in front of the therapist and the patient. Place it on a desk for the upper extremity or on the floor for the lower extremity.\nExplain that mirror therapy works by making use of the reflection of the sound side to create the image of the simultaneous movement of the sound side and denervated extremity19,21. Shortly demonstrate this with the therapist’s own upper or lower extremity.\nPlace the mirror medially in front of the patient in a way that he/she sees the reflection of the sound side exactly where the injured extremity is expected. Make sure that the whole injured extremity is covered by the mirror (box), i.e., it cannot be seen by the patient.\nAsk him/her which movements he/she can easily imagine. Instruct the patient to perform these movements with the sound side while looking at the mirror. Start with slow movements.\nInstruct the patient to move both sides for 5 to 10 min. Explain, that the injured side will not move, but that it is still important to generate the illusion of simultaneous movement of both sides.\nWithin the treatment process, encourage the patient to also perform movements that he/she cannot imagine easily to gradually increase the difficulty.\nAs a home exercise, ask the patient to perform/imagine these movements 5 to 10 min, twice a day.\nNOTE: Together with the other exercises to enhance cortical reorganization, this accounts for about 20 min of the home program, twice a day. Ask the patient if this is feasible. Otherwise, choose one or two of these interventions based on the patient’s preferences and reduce the training time to a manageable amount.",
    "As there is no active motion expected within the first months after surgery, make sure that the range of motion (ROM) is preserved in all joints.\nLet the patient actively move all joints.\nInstruct the patient to perform this every day by him/herself.\nAdditionally, in paralyzed hands or ankles use splints or orthoses to stabilize the joints in a position that avoids contractures of joints, ligaments, and tendons (as the intrinsic plus position for the hand22). If necessary, fabricate a hand splint or make sure that the patients get a well-fitted device. In patients with an unstable shoulder and/or no elbow flexion use a sling15.\nDepending on the patient’s needs, include exercises for body symmetry, trunk stability, and posture. Especially, if hand function is severely impaired, include training of one-handed activities and provide the patient with assistive devices.\n3. Motor Activation Using a Donor Side Approach\nStart this part of the rehabilitation as soon as the first volitional contraction of the re-innervated muscle can be detected, which can usually be expected within 3-5 months after surgery (see Table 2).\nSet up a system for surface EMG biofeedback by unpacking it on a table, plugging in all cables and pressing the power button. This can be a stand-alone device, or one connected to a computer. If a computer is used, connect the device with the computer and start the appropriate software.\nPrepare the patient’s skin to reduce impedance23. Do so by carefully shaving the respective body part and/or by gently removing dead skin cells with a peeling gel and/or a wet paper towel. Shortly explain the functionality of the system to the patient.",
    "Ask the patient to think of movements that the donor nerves were originally responsible for (e.g., hand closing if the ulnar nerve was used) and palpate the recipient muscle.\nPlace a surface EMG electrode on the exact position, where muscle contraction can be palpated. While surface EMG may be detected with wet and dry electrodes, in this experiment dry electrodes are preferred for testing as these can be easily moved on the skin to alter electrode position. Even if no movement can be palpated, check for the EMG activity regularly within the first 3-6 months after surgery.\nNOTE: The re-innervation can be confirmed, if the signal amplitude during activation is repeatedly 2-3 times higher than background noise during relaxation8.\nIf this cannot be confirmed, slightly change the position of the electrode and try other motor commands related to the donor nerve (e.g., ulnar abduction or flexion of the wrist, if the ulnar nerve was used as a donor). Otherwise, continue with the interventions for cortical activation and test again after a few weeks.\nTrain the activation of the newly re-innervated muscles with sEMG biofeedback.\nAs the first step of muscle activation training, educate the patient on the function of sEMG biofeedback and explain the principles of the donor activation approach.\nSwitch on the biofeedback system and place the surface EMG electrode on the patient’s skin above the muscle to display the patient’s muscle activation.",
    "Make sure that the patient is comfortably seated and instruct the patient to think of movement patterns related to the donor nerve while picking up sEMG signals from the recipient muscle. If a system with the possibility to adjust signal gains is used, set it up in a way that the signal amplitude is high enough to be easily observed. In the beginning, this usually requires a high amplification.\nAs soon as the patient can repeatably activate the muscle, ask him/her to fully relax after muscle activation, which corresponds to EMG amplitudes close to zero. Full relaxation is often hard to achieve for the patient and can take some time. Ask the patient to repeatedly activate the muscle and fully relax it.\nTry different movement cues and electrode positions in order to find the highest amplitude. After finding a good combination, maintain it the rest of the session.\nProvide the patient with a structured home exercise program including the amount of training per week (10-20 min of concentrated training per day is recommended) and exact instructions of what to train. If it is possible for the patient to use a device for sEMG biofeedback at home, encourage this8. Update the home exercise program regularly.\nAs soon as the patient feels confident with the sEMG setup, introduce motor commands including both the activation of the donor nerve and the actual function of the recipient muscle. For a patient with an Oberlin’s ulnar nerve transfer to the biceps muscle, this means thinking of hand closing and elbow flexion at the same time.\nCAUTION: In patients where a nerve branch from an antagonistic muscle was transferred, do only focus on the donor nerve function and omit this step.",
    "Train muscle activation with and without sEMG biofeedback until muscle strength is sufficient to overcome gravity or resistance of antagonistic muscles. Additionally, repeat the interventions for activation of the motor cortex.\n4. Re-learning the Original Movement Pattern\nAs soon as the muscle is strong enough to overcome gravity or the resistance of antagonistic muscles and joint stiffness, focus therapy on re-learning the original movement pattern of the recipient nerve. This means that a patient after an Oberlin’s ulnar nerve transfer finally needs to learn how to flex the elbow without any movement of the hand and conversely, move the hand without flexion of the elbow.\nEncourage the patient to slightly activate the recipient muscle without the movement in the muscles originally innervated by the donor nerve.\nSupport this by using sEMG biofeedback with two channels. Place one bipolar electrode on the skin above the re-innervated muscle and put the other one on the skin above the original donor nerve muscle. This allows the patient to simultaneously see the activation of both muscles. Encourage the patient to activate the recipient muscle and ensure that the donor muscle is relaxed with a low EMG signal amplitude.\nLet the patient know that signal separation is usually easier with slight muscle activation and that unwanted co-contraction of both muscles is common at the beginning of training.\nUsing the same sEMG setup, ask the patient to activate the donor muscle without the activation of the re-innervated muscle and monitor for desirable/undesirable strategies resulting in better/worse separation of signals. Encourage strategies that support signal separation.\nIf both signals can be separated with slight muscle contractions, ask the patient to perform stronger contractions.",
    "As soon as good signal separation while using sEMG biofeedback can be observed, ask the patient to perform separated “donor” and “recipient” movements without feedback.\nAs this phase is cognitively demanding and repetition is of great importance for motor re-learning, make sure that the patient has a suitable home exercise program. Again, encourage the use of sEMG biofeedback devices at home, if possible.\nWith increased motor function, encourage the patient to do more complex tasks including increased muscle force or improved precision. Also start “classic” strengthening exercises, if necessary.\nFinally, focus on activities of daily living and those needed in the patient’s home, work environment and when performing sports.\nIn lower limb nerve transfers, start gait training with the focus on avoiding undesired compensatory movements.\nAsk the patient to walk along a corridor and analyze the gait based on the principles of observational gait analysis24,25.\nDefine deviations from the physiological gait pattern and analyze them with respect to the origin (e.g., which muscle might be weak) and the connection between each other (e.g., how hip kinematics affects knee kinematics and vice versa). If necessary, for clarification, conduct additional tests (e.g., for muscle strength or joint mobility).\nDevelop a treatment plan based on your findings24,25.\nEvaluate the interventions while the patient is doing them, as well as the therapy progress over time. If necessary, conduct another gait analysis and/or change interventions.\nSee the patient three, six and twelve months after discharge from rehabilitation to find out about the long-term therapy success and patient satisfaction. If necessary and requested by the patient provide further training sessions.\nEvaluate, if the functional goal, that was discussed with the patient before surgery/at the beginning of rehabilitation could be reached.",
    "NOTE: For some patients, this might be fully functional recovery, while for others the return of minimal function might be sufficient.\n\t\nAsk the patient, if he/she is satisfied with the rehabilitation outcome and make clear that this is very subjective and is not necessarily reflected by any scores in outcome assessment instruments.\nIf the patient is unsatisfied with the outcome, inform the patient about further (surgical) strategies to enhance function, as well as the possibility of using functional orthoses to compensate limited muscle strength."
