    "The following protocol has been approved by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and complies with all institutional ethical guidelines regarding the use of research animals. Additionally, all experiments were performed in accordance with institutional, state and federal regulations regarding experimental animal research.\nNOTE: For this protocol, we used female and male congenic in-bred C57BL6/J mice at 12 to 72 weeks of age. All mice used for this procedure were kept at our non-barrier facility for at least one week prior to the operation to adapt to the local biome. Animals were allowed to feed up to time of operation and we used neither oral mechanical bowel preparation nor rectal flushing prior to procedure.\n1) Creation of Anastomoses\nAutoclave the surgical instruments, warm the saline irrigation solution and thoroughly clean all operative surfaces with 70% ethanol.\nTo induce anesthesia, place the mouse in an induction box that is connected to a vaporizer. Deliver 2-3% isoflurane at 1-2 L/min until mice are sedated.\nPlace the animal on a warming device, such as a heating pad, to prevent hypothermia.\nSubcutaneously inject a one time dose of 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine (3 µg for a 30 g mouse) for postoperative analgesia and a one time dose of 10 mg/kg of enrofloxacin for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.\n\tNOTE: Though pre- and postoperative antibiotics are not required for this operation, institutional guidelines and the animal care and use committee at our institution recommended their use at our facility.\nPlace the anesthetic nose cone around the mouse's snout. Throughout the operation, carefully monitor the respiratory rate of the animal and adjust the anesthetic flow rate as needed. Maintain a respiratory rate at 30-40 breaths per minute.",
    "Use a hair clipper followed by a depilatory agent to remove the hair from the entire skin surface of the abdomen. Thoroughly remove the depilatory agent with gauze wetted with water or 70% ethanol. Thoroughly dry the animal.\nPrior to prepping the abdomen, tape the mouse's limbs to the heating pad or operative surface at the end of each leg to prevent the mouse from shifting during surgery. Disinfect the abdomen with chlorhexidine. Include the entire shaved area as well as the hair on the edges of the shaved area. Place a sterile drape over the mouse (Figure 1A).\n\t\nPrior to draping, cut a small ovoid or rectangular window into the drape to expose the prepped abdomen.\n\t\tNOTE: The window should expose the entire abdomen of the mouse but cover the limbs, tail, head and thorax. We cut a 4 x 3 cm2 window for our operations (Figure 1B).\nMake a small slit along the drape midline, from the bottom edge towards the ovoid or rectangular window, to allow access to the rectum during the procedure (Figure 1C).\nMake a skin incision. Start along the midline of the lower abdomen and incise skin with scissors vertically to the xiphoid. Incise only the skin and avoid cutting the abdominal wall musculature (Figure 2A).\nGrasp the midline of the abdominal wall with forceps and lift away from the abdominal contents. Taking care not to injure intraabdominal structures, incise the length of the midline abdominal fascia vertically with sharp scissors. Extend the length of the skin incision (Figure 2B).",
    "When the intestines are exposed, locate the cecum and small bowel, and rotate the left-sided viscera medially to expose the descending and sigmoid colon. Coat the blunt probe tip with lubricating jelly and carefully advance the probe into the rectum to aid in the identification of the descending/sigmoid colon (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Unlike humans, the mouse cecum is generally found in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Take care not to perforate the bowel wall with the probe in this step. If bowel wall is perforated, terminate the procedure and euthanize the mouse.\n\t\nAvoid grasping the cecum with toothed or sharp forceps. Instead use atraumatic forceps, cotton tipped applicator, or gentle finger manipulation to rotate viscera.\nUse warmed sterile saline to ensure the exposed bowel is kept moist throughout the procedure.\nThe colon will be on the left of midline and attached to the retroperitoneum via the mesentery. After identification, withdraw the blunt probe partially to facilitate colotomy.\nPerform transverse colotomy of the sigmoid colon.\n\t\nGently grasp the sigmoid colon superior to the pelvic inlet with atraumatic forceps (Figure 4A).\nUsing sharp micro-scissors, make a cut across the sigmoid colon perpendicular to the direction of the colon and extending across 80-90% the width of the colon. This will help prevent retraction of one end of the colon out of the surgical field, and facilitate repair (Figure 4B).\nIf a mesenteric blood vessel is injured during the course of the visceral rotation or colotomy, gently hold pressure for up to 2 min with gauze or a cotton-tipped applicator. If bleeding persists after this time, place a figure-of-eight 8-0 monofilament suture around the point of bleeding.",
    "NOTE: If the bowel shows signs of necrosis or injury after this, terminate the procedure and euthanize the mouse using a humane method approved by your institutional animal use committee.\nRepair the sigmoid colotomy.\n\t\nUsing a Castroviejo needle driver, place 5-6 simple interrupted 8-0 nonabsorbable polypropylene stitches to repair the colostomy. Place sutures 1 mm apart from each other with 0.5 mm bites.\n\t\t\nTake care to avoid rolling the edges of bowel into the repair by taking slightly more serosa than mucosa with each stitch. Leave the tails 5 mm long. Take care not to accidentally catch surrounding bowel into the suture (Figure 4C).\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is helpful to begin suturing at the near the mesenteric border of the colotomy, saving the anti-mesenteric-most portion of the colotomy for last.\nAs the repair progresses, advance the trans-anal blunt-tipped dissection probe to span the repair before the final sutures are placed. This will help prevent too narrow a repair and decrease rates of anastomotic stricture.\nUsing a 10 mL syringe filled with warmed saline, irrigate the abdomen several times. If the surface underneath the mouse becomes soaked, dry the mouse or move the mouse to a dry surface in order to avoid hypothermia.\n\t\nUse a sterile gauze placed over the incision to soak up excess irrigation.\nAt the final irrigation, fill the abdomen with sterile saline. Carefully advance a lubricated 18 G angiocatheter into the rectum and inflate with 0.5-1 cm3 of air. This will demonstrate any leaks in the anastomosis than can be repaired with another interrupted polypropylene suture using the sterile probe to span the anastomosis.\nDeflate the colon using the angiocatheter before removal.",
    "Make sure that there is no active bleeding. If there is, apply gentle pressure directly onto the point of bleeding for 1-2 min. Place hemostatic suture as described above if bleeding continues.\nGently return the medialized viscera to its normal anatomic position (Figure 5A).\nClose the abdominal incision (Figure 5B).\n\t\nUsing 4-0 absorbable braided sutures, place a running suture along the muscular layer of the abdominal wall starting at the top of the incision and finishing at the inferior aspect of the incision. Install a tie and cut the suture leaving 5 mm tails.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not accidentally incorporate intestine in the abdominal wall closure.\nRepeat with 4-0 monofilament suture to close the skin (Figure 5C).\nEnsure that the entire animal is warm and dry, to prevent postoperative hypothermia.\nCarefully monitor the animal as it recovers from anesthesia. Administer 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine every 72 h for 2-3 days after the procedure for pain control.  During the recovery period, mice should be carefully examined daily for signs of abscess or peritoneal sepsis.  Post-operative observation for pain and distress should include: restriction of movement including hunching type of posture, lack of eating or drinking, not proper grooming, excessive inflammation around wound, lack of normal healing at the site of incision, or not normal nesting.  Any animal demonstrating any of these behaviors should be immediately euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation for a minimum of 10 min followed by bilateral thoracotomy.\nMix 0.1 mg/mL of enrofloxacin with the mouse's drinking water for 7 days following surgery to prevent intra-abdominal infection or sepsis due to fecal contamination associated with the operation.\n2) Harvesting Anastomotic Tissue\nJust before excising anastomotic tissue, euthanize the mouse using a humane method approved by the institutional animal use committee.",
    "NOTE: Based on institutional policy, we euthanize our animals by placing them in a carbon dioxide chamber with 100% carbon dioxide gas infusion at 2 L/min for 5 min before performing bilateral thoracotomy.\nSterilize the abdomen with chlorhexidine followed by 70% ethanol.\nRe-incise the original midline incision with sharp scissors. Start at the lower pole of the previous incision and extend this cut superiorly to the xiphoid (Figure 6A).\nUsing scissors, cut into the muscular layer, and after entering the peritoneal space, extend the cut to the top and bottom of the incision. Take care to avoid injuring the bowel when entering the abdomen or disrupting the anastomosis, as there may be bowel adhered to the incision or anastomotic site.\nCarefully perform a left medial visceral rotation exposing the repaired sigmoid colon (Figure 6B). There will likely be bowel to bowel adhesions surrounding the repair. Gently and bluntly dissect these adhesions away from the site of repair. Take great care not to disrupt the anastomosis.\n\t\nIdentify the repair site by locating the tails of the polypropylene suture used for the repair. Using scissors and starting 1 cm proximal to the repair, transversely transect through the descending colon. Repeat this step 1 cm distal to site of anastomosis.\nRemove the sigmoidal segment by sharply dissecting the colon from the attached mesentery along the posterior border of the colon with fine scissors (Figure 7).\nIdentify the mesenteric border of the colon specimen and use fine scissors to cut along the length of the mesenteric border in a longitudinal fashion. This will create a square or rectangular section of colon from the cylindrical specimen previously removed (Figure 8).",
    "Use a marking pen to demarcate the anti-mesenteric border of the colon prior to removal of the colon segment. After removal, make a longitudinal cut along the length of the colon opposite the marking. Fix, embed and cut sample tissue as needed for histology and/or immunostaining.\nSubscription Required.
