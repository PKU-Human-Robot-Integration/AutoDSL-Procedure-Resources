    "1. Starvation\nPrepare fly starvation vials by saturating a cotton ball with 18.2 MΩ water at the bottom of a standard fly vial. Alternatively, similarly saturate a small strip of filter paper with 18.2 MΩ water and place at an angle within the vial.\nCollect flies into sets of ~100 animals on a CO2 pad and then add the flies to a prepared vial.\n\tNote: Best results are obtained with animals that are less than 5 days old. However, the exact age of the animals can be controlled as an experimental variable to determine changes in taste preference over time.\nUse a cotton ball or foam stopper to secure the vials closed. Place vials on their side in an environmentally controlled incubator. Maintain the temperature at 25 °C, and the humidity above 70%. Leave vials untouched for 24 hr.\n2. Taste Preference Assay\nPrepare all tastants for the assay on the same day as testing.\n\tNote: The exact tastants to be used will vary depending on experimental question being asked. The following are example tastants used in this protocol. See section 4 for optimizations.\n\t\nPrepare control tastant (1 mM sucrose) by combining 10 µl of 100 mM sucrose solution, 13 µl of red food coloring, and 977 µl of 18.2 MΩ water.\nPrepare experimental tastant (5 mM sucrose) by combining 50 µl of 100 mM sucrose solution, 10 µl of blue food coloring, and 940 µl of 18.2 MΩ water.\nMake assay chambers using a standard 100 mm x 15 mm plastic petri dish prepared in the following manner:\n\t\nPlace three 10 µl drops of control tastant nearest the edge of the plate at 12 o'clock and another 3 drops at 6 o'clock. Ensure that the spacing between drops is similar.",
    "Place three 10 µl drops of experimental tastant nearest the edge of the plate at 3 o'clock and another 3 drops at 9 o'clock. Ensure that the spacing between drops is similar.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 for as many replicates as desired.\nEmpty 1 vial of ~100 starved flies onto a CO2 pad just long enough to anesthetize all animals (approximately 10 sec). Brush the animals into the middle of a prepared assay chamber and cover with the dish lid.\n\tNote: Longer periods of CO2 exposure should be avoided to improve recovery time and limit interference with the feeding behavior. Exposure to ice (~5 min) may be used for anesthetizing to avoid CO2 behavioral effects that may arise from even limited exposure.\nPlace the assay chamber in an opaque cardboard box. Be sure to label the outside of the box with the condition and genotype being tested.\nPlace the entire setup (assay chamber contained within cardboard box from step 2.4) into a 25 °C incubator with at least 70% humidity for 2 hr.\nRepeat steps 2.3 through 2.5 for all replicates.\nAfter 2 hours, place the assay chambers, still contained within cardboard boxes, directly into a -20 °C freezer until ready for quantitation.\n3. Taste Preference Assay Quantification\nAllow a single assay chamber to warm up to room temperature (approximately 5 min).\nUnder a dissection microscope, using a brush or pair of forceps, group animals based on the color of their abdomen: red, blue, purple or clear (Figure 1).\nRecord the number of animals in each grouping. Consider clear animals to have not participated in the assay and therefore do not include them in any calculations.\nCalculate the preference index according to one of the following equations:",
    "If the experimental tastant of interest is added to the red dye, then use (Nred +0.5Npurple)/(Nred +Nblue + Npurple).\nIf the experimental tastant is added to the blue dye, then adjust the equation to (Nblue +0.5Npurple)/(Nblue +Nred + Npurple).\nRepeat the calculations for all experimental conditions and replicates.\n4. Optimization of Taste Preference Assay\nEmpirically determine the concentration of food coloring indicators to be used so food coloring does not affect the outcome of the taste assay, as follows:\n\t\nPrepare 4 tastants using the same base compound (e.g. 5 mM sucrose) as indicated in step 2.1, but omit the food coloring.\nAdd 1.3% red food coloring to one of the tastants. Make the remaining 3 tastants with blue food coloring of varying concentrations in each tube (e.g. 0.6%, 1%, and 1.3%).\nComplete protocol steps 2.2 through 3.4 for each tastant pair: 1.3% red vs. 0.6% blue; 1.3% red vs. 1% blue and 1.3% red vs. 1.3% blue.\nRepeat step 4.1.1-4.1.3 with different percentages of blue food coloring until the preference index averages a value of 0 (Figure 2).\n\t\tNote: As a starting point, 1.3% red food coloring coupled with 1% blue food coloring typically yields good results. If no satisfactory concentration of blue food coloring can be matched to 1.3% dye, then step 4.1.1 through 4.1.3 can be repeated with varying concentrations of red coloring and a constant concentration of blue food coloring.\nAnalyze all conditions to be tested with the same optimized food coloring concentrations.\nSubscription Required.
