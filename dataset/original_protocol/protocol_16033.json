    "Here we describe insertion of the Type I carrier vector carrying the first DNA segment of interest (Type I DNA1) into the integration platform cassette of the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC, propagated in hamster CHO cells (Figs. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005] and 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]). At the starting point, the cells should express eGFP, and be resistant to hygromycin B and sensitive to ganciclovir. A PCR against the HAC carrying the “empty” integration platform cassette with the diagnostic primers B072/B074 should yield a fragment of 559 bp (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dfb570be-ade0-4510-9a24-b48a4931d997/cpz1316-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",
    "Cell culture steps in the basic protocols. Each round of integration requires similar cell culture procedures. Herein, the steps of the protocols are presented side by side to highlight the key differences between them. The first round starts with hamster CHO cells carrying the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC. Afterwards, any subsequent round starts with the cells obtained during the preceding round. (A and B) The first procedure in each round is co-transfection of a specific carrier vector carrying a genomic DNA fragment, i.e., Type I DNA1, Type II DNA2, and Type I DNA3, along with either (A) A139 or (B) A135-JH vector. (C and D) Cells in which correct integration has occurred exhibit a change in the expression of marker genes (eGFP to mCherry or mCherry to eGFP) and can form colonies under selection with either (C) puromycin and blasticidin S or (D) hygromycin B and blasticidin S. (E and F) Individual colonies with proper fluorescence are transferred into a 96-well plate. Additional counterselection agents, i.e, (E) ganciclovir or (F) 5-fluorocytosine, are supplemented to remove cells with incorrect integration. (G and H) The colonies are transferred to a 24-well plate and grown under selection. (I and J) Genomic DNA is purified from individual colonies and PCR-analyzed to confirm proper integration. (K and L) Colonies with PCR-confirmed integration of the DNA fragment are transferred to 10-cm dishes for FISH analysis and for preparation of frozen stocks.",
    "To perform Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0001], the user will co-transfect CHO cells carrying the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC with the Type I carrier vector A167 carrying DNA1 and the A139 vector. Vector A139 expresses ΦC31 integrase and Cre recombinase. Then the user will culture the cells in puromycin/blasticidin S medium. After ∼10 days of selection, the user will pick up the colonies exhibiting red fluorescence (mCherry is expressed) and culture them in puromycin/ganciclovir/blasticidin S medium.\nTo verify recombination at the loxP site, the user will carry out a PCR reaction with the primer pairs B072/B071 and B074/B072 (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]). B071 primer corresponds to the PCF marker. B072 corresponds to the SFM promoter sequence. B074 primer corresponds to the GHT marker. After the first and every next odd-numbered round of integration, a PCR reaction with B072/B071 primers should give a 447-bp product, while PCR with B074/B072 primers should be negative. Thus the user will confirm the insertion of the PCF marker and elimination of the GHT marker.\nTo verify recombination between attBФC31 and attPФC31 sites and integration of DNA1 into the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC, the user should choose a forward primer complementary to a 3′-end region of DNA1 (FDNA1; Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]). B678 primer corresponding to the HAC backbone sequence can be used as a reverse primer (e.g., R3/B678 primers for VHL gene insertion; see Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0007] and 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0007]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ebf9df2a-5287-4798-b331-036d8ea8f219/cpz1316-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",
    "Schematic of VHL gene reconstitution by serial integration into the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC. The VHL gene is located on chromosome 3 (positions 10137959-10154492; GHCH38/hg38). The gene contains three exons. Mutations in the gene are associated with the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, a dominantly inherited hereditary cancer syndrome predisposing individuals to a variety of malignant and benign tumors of the eye, brain, spinal cord, kidney, pancreas, and adrenal glands. (A) Construction of Type I vectors carrying genomic fragments DNA1 and DNA3, encompassing exon 3 and exon 1, respectively, and Type II vector carrying a genomic DNA2 fragment encompassing exon 2 of the VHL gene. DNA1 (exon 3) and DNA3 (exon 1) were inserted into the AscI/NotI sites of the Type I carrier vector A167. DNA2 (exon 2) was inserted into the AscI/NotI sites of the Type II carrier vector A169. (B) Three rounds of insertion of the VHL fragments into the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC carrying the integration platform cassette are shown. Round 1: A diagnostic PCR for DNA1 insertion was performed with primers R3/B678. Round 2: A diagnostic PCR for DNA2 insertion was performed with primers F23/R23. Round 3: A diagnostic PCR for DNA3 insertion was performed with diagnostic primers F12/R12. The position of the primer pairs is shown. (C) Representative images of how cell fluorescence changes after each round of DNA insertion are shown.\nTo verify the integrity of the newly inserted attBФBT1 site, the user will need to select a reverse primer complementary to a 5′-end region of DNA1 (RDNA1; Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]).

    "6. Mix the ViaFect transfection reagent gently before use, then add 10 μl directly to the mix from step 5.\n7. Mix gently and incubate 5 min at room temperature.\n8. After incubation, add the mixture from the previous step directly to the well with the cells from step 4.\nDo not mix by pipetting, just add drop by drop into the well.\nChanging the medium before transfection is not necessary.\n9. Shake plate vigorously backward-forward, left-right before placing back into the incubator.\n10. Incubate cells overnight (typically 16-18 hr) at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere (Fig. 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]).\n11. The next day, wash cells with 1 ml PBS once, add 300 μl 0.25% trypsin, and incubate 5 min at 37°C.\n12. Add 4 ml F12 round I selection medium, resuspend cells by pipetting up and down five to seven times, and transfer suspension onto a 10-cm culture dish containing 6 ml F12 round I selection medium.\n13. Let cells grow until individual colonies become visible by the naked eye when you remove the medium from the dish. This usually takes 10-14 days.

It is advisable that at least ten colonies be picked up for further analysis. Scale up steps 4-15 if you do not have enough colonies.",
    "16. Pick up several individual colonies. To do this, wash cells once with 5 ml PBS, apply a cloning cylinder around a colony, and add 30 μl 0.25% trypsin into the cylinder's well. Incubate cells 5 min at 37°C. Add 150 μl F12 round I selection medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml of ganciclovir into the cylinder. Resuspend cells well by pipetting up and down five to seven times and transfer suspension into one well of a 96-well plate. Incubate plate at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n17. Continue to grow cells for an additional 3-7 days, until the cultures reach 90%-100% confluency, changing the F12 round I selection medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml ganciclovir every 3 days. Once confluent, wash wells once with 100 μl PBS and add 50 μl 0.25% trypsin. Incubate cells 5 min. Transfer cell suspension from each well of a 96-well plate to a separate well of a 24-well plate. Add 0.5 ml F12 round I selection medium with 5 μg/ml ganciclovir to each well of the 24-well plate with cells. Grow cells until 90%-100% confluency, changing the medium every 2-3 days (Fig. 6G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]).\nAddition of ganciclovir allows selection against the cells with an incorrect insertion (Fig. 8B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0008]). Approximately half of the initially picked colonies can be selected at this step.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7921a42a-33ad-441c-9ac3-746c986c4fd8/cpz1316-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8",
    "Error-catching mechanism within the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC system. Recombination reactions mediated by Cre, ΦC31, and ΦBT1 do not always go to completion. Because maintenance, storage, and screening of vertebrate cell colonies are very labor-intensive compared to that for bacteria or yeast colonies, an error-catching system was designed into the IIS to lighten the workload. (A and B) Products of incomplete recombination reactions involving the Type I carrier vector A167 retain an actively expressed GHT marker. (C and D) Products of incomplete recombination reactions between the Type II carrier vector A169 retain an expressed PCF marker. The selection agents to remove each misassembled product are listed. This figure was adapted from Lee et al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-bib-0033]).\n18. Wash cells once with 200 μl PBS, add 100 μl 0.25% trypsin, and incubate 5 min at 37°C. Resuspend cells by pipetting up and down five to seven times and transfer 80 μl of the suspension into new separate 1.7-ml tubes. Add 0.5 ml F12 round I selection medium to each well to regrow the cells. Continue culturing cells in the plate at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nIt is important not to cross contaminate the culture. Use separate pipet tips for each individual colony.\n19. While the cells are growing, check whether the fragment DNA1 from Type I carrier vector was inserted into the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC. Spin down cells in the 1.7-ml tubes (from step 18) at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature and isolate genomic DNA using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, per the manufacturer's instructions. Elute genomic DNA in 50 μl water.\n20. Use each genomic DNA sample to run four PCR reactions:\n         \nWith diagnostic primer pairs B071/B072;\nWith B074/B072 to confirm loxP recombination;\nWith FDNA1 and B678 to confirm attPФC31/attBФC31 recombination;",
    "With forward B485 and RDNA1 to confirm integrity of attBФBT1 site.\nSet up PCR reactions with TaKaRa Ex Taq DNA Polymerase, per the manufacturer's instructions, using 1 μl of the genomic DNA solution (from step 19) as a template. Set up 25-μl total reactions and use the following PCR conditions after initial denaturation: 94°C 20 s, 60°C 30 s; 72°C 30 s; for 30 cycles (Fig. 6I[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]).\n21. Run samples in a 1.5% agarose gel.\nPCR with B071/B072 should give a 447-bp product, while PCR with B074/B072 primers should be negative. PCRs with FDNA1/B678 and with B485/RDNA1 should give products based on the user's design. It is advisable to sequence PCR products to ensure PCR accuracy.\n22. Expand each colony with the PCR-confirmed DNA1 fragment insertion (left growing in step 18) on a 10-cm culture dish until cells reach ∼70%-80% confluency (Fig. 6K[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]). Wash cells once with 2 ml PBS, add 1.5 ml 0.25% trypsin, and incubate 5 min at 37°C. Resuspend cells by pipetting up and down five to seven times. Count cells with a hemocytometer. Use 1 × 106 cells to start FISH (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0004]).\nFISH analysis on a metaphase spread is needed to confirm that the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC carrying a DNA1 fragment from the A167 vector remains autonomous and has not integrated into the chromosomes.\n23. Use 2 × 106 cells to prepare frozen stocks. Spin cells down at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature. Discard supernatant. Resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml F12 growth medium and add 1 ml CFM (2×). Mix well and add 0.5 ml of the mixture to four cryovials. Place cryovials into the freezing box and place it at -80°C. For long-term storage (up to several years), place cells in the liquid nitrogen tank the next day.",
    "After the first round of insertion, the recombination reaction removes the GHT marker from its promoter and replaces it with the PCF marker, loxP and attBΦBT1 sites, and a DNA fragment from the Type I carrier vector A167 (DNA1), while deleting all other vector components. The promoter within the platform cassette now drives the PCF marker. The cells that successfully completed recombination reactions lose green fluorescence (eGFP), resistance to hygromycin (hph), and sensitivity to ganciclovir (TK), and gain red fluorescence (mCherry), resistance to puromycin (Puro), and sensitivity to 5-fluorocytosine (FcyFur; Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]).\nColonies that have passed PCR and FISH verification are suitable for the second round of DNA insertion (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0002]).",
    "Here we describe insertion of the Type II carrier vector A169 carrying a second DNA segment of interest (DNA2) into the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC, after the first round of DNA insertion (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0001]; Figs. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005] and 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]).

To perform Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0002], the user will co-transfect the Type II carrier vector carrying DNA2 and the A135-JH vector. The A135-JH vector expresses ΦBT1 integrase and Cre recombinase. The user will culture the cells in hygromycin B/blasticidin S medium. After 10 days of selection, the user will pick up the colonies expressing green fluorescence (i.e., eGFP is expressed) and then expand them in medium containing hygromycin B/5-fluorocytosine/blasticidin S.\nAfter the second round of DNA insertion and every subsequent even-numbered round of integration, a PCR reaction with B072/B074 primers should give a 559-bp product, while PCR with B071/B072 primers should be negative (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]). Thus, the user will confirm the insertion of the GHT marker and elimination of the PCF marker.\nTo verify recombination between attBΦBT1 and attPΦBT1 sites and integration of DNA2, the user should choose primers from the sequence around a newly formed junction. A forward primer should correspond to a 3′-end region of DNA2 (FDNA2). A reverse primer (RDNA1) should anneal to a 5′-end region of the DNA fragment inserted in the first round (DNA1; e.g., F23/R23 primers after the second round of VHL gene integration; see Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0007]).\nTo verify the integrity of the newly inserted attBФC31 site, the user should choose a reverse primer complementary to a 5′-end region of DNA2 (RDNA2; Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]).

Incubate plate at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight so that the cells are ∼70%-80% confluent at the time of transfection (i.e., the next day).\n5. The next day, mix 1 μg Type II DNA2, 0.1 μg A135-JH, and 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium without serum in a sterile 1.7-ml tube. Mix gently by tapping.\n6. Repeat steps 6-11 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0001].\n7. Add 4 ml F12 round II selection medium, resuspend cells by pipetting up and down five to seven times, and transfer suspension onto a 10-cm culture dish containing 6 ml F12 round II selection medium (Fig. 6D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]).",
    "8. Let cells grow until individual colonies become visible by the naked eye when you remove medium from the dish. This usually takes 10-14 days. Change F12 round II selection medium every 2-3 days.\n9. With a permanent marker, make circles on the bottom of the culture dish around colonies that are well isolated from other colonies.\n10. Check the fluorescence of the cells in the circled colonies under the microscope. Mark those colonies with the cells exhibiting green but not red fluorescence (Fig. 6F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]).\nThe number of colonies formed on the dish may vary from one to one hundred depending on recombination efficacy. It is advisable to pick up at least ten colonies for further analysis. Scale up steps 4-10 if you do not have enough colonies.\n11. Pick up several individual colonies. To do this, wash cells once with 5 ml PBS, apply a cloning cylinder around a colony, and add 30 μl 0.25% trypsin into the cylinder's well. Incubate cells 5 min. Add 150 μl F12 round II selection medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml of 5-fluorocytosine into the cylinder. Resuspend cells by pipetting up and down five to seven times and transfer suspension into one well of a 96-well plate. Incubate plate at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.",
    "12. Continue to grow the cells for an additional 3-7 days until the culture reaches 90%-100% confluency, changing the F12 round II selection medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml 5-fluorocytosine every 3 days. After cells reach confluency, wash wells once with 100 μl PBS and add 50 μl 0.25% trypsin. Incubate cells 5 min. Transfer the cell suspension from each well of the 96-well plate to a separate well of a 24-well plate. Add 0.5 ml F12 round II selection medium with 100 μg/ml 5-fluorocytosine to each well of the 24-well plate with the cells. Grow cells until 90%-100% confluency, changing the medium every 2-3 days (Fig. 6H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]).\nAddition of 5-fluorocytosine allows selection against the cells with an incorrect insertion (Fig. 8D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0008]). Approximately half of the initially picked colonies can be selected against at this step.\n13. Wash cells once with 200 μl PBS, add 100 μl 0.25% trypsin, and incubate 5 min at 37°C. Resuspend cells by pipetting up and down five to seven times and transfer 80 μl of each suspension into separate 1.7-ml tubes. Add 0.5 ml F12 round II selection medium to each well to regrow the cells. Continue culturing cells in the plate at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n14. While the cells are growing, check whether the DNA2 fragment from the Type II carrier vector has been inserted into the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC. Spin down cells in the 1.7-ml tubes (from step 13) at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature and isolate genomic DNA using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, per the manufacturer's instructions.

    "With forward B075 and RDNA2 to confirm integrity of attBФC31 site.\nSet up PCR reactions with TaKaRa Ex Taq DNA Polymerase, per the manufacturer's instructions, using 1 μl of the genomic DNA solution (from step 14) as a template. Total volume of the reaction is 25 μl. Use the following PCR conditions after initial denaturation: 94°C 20 s, 60°C 30 s, 72°C 30 s; 30 cycles.\n16. Run samples in a 1.5% agarose gel.\nPCR with B074/B072 primers should give a 559-bp product, while PCR with B071/B072 primers should be negative. PCRs with FDNA2/RDNA1 and with B075/RDNA2 should give products based on the user's design. It is advisable to sequence PCR products to ensure PCR accuracy.\n17. Expand each colony with the PCR-confirmed DNA2 fragment insertion (on the plate, from step 13) on a 10-cm culture dish, until the cells reach ∼70%-80% confluency (Fig. 6L[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]). Wash cells once with 2 ml PBS, add 1.5 ml 0.25% trypsin, and incubate 5 min at 37°C. Resuspend cells by pipetting up and down five to seven times. Count cells with a hemocytometer. Use 1 × 106 cells to start FISH (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0004]).\nFISH analysis on a metaphase spread is needed to confirm that the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC carrying DNA1 and DNA2 fragments remains autonomous and has not integrated into the chromosomes.\n18. Prepare frozen stocks as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0001], step 23.\nAfter the second round of integration, the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC will carry the DNA fragments from the first set of Type I and Type II carrier vectors (DNA1 and DNA2). The GHT marker will be expressed. Therefore, the cells will once again express eGFP, and will be hygromycin resistant (hph) and ganciclovir sensitive (TK; Fig 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]).\nClones that have passed PCR and FISH verification are suitable for a third round of insertion.",
    "Here we describe insertion of the Type I carrier vector A167 carrying a third DNA segment of interest (DNA3) into the IIS-alphoidtetO-HAC after two previous rounds of DNA insertion (Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0002]; Figs. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005] and 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]). The HAC is propagated in hamster donor CHO cells. After Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0002], if users want to add an additional DNA segment, they will essentially repeat Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0001] with some modifications (see below). Such cycles (Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0001] to 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0003]) can then be repeated for any number of segments. To perform Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0003], the user will co-transfect and select the cells as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-prot-0001]. As such, after the procedure, the cells will exhibit red fluorescence (mCherry is expressed).\nAfter the third round of DNA insertion and every subsequent odd-numbered round of integration, a PCR reaction with B071/B072 primers should give a 447-bp product, while PCR with B072/B074 primers should be negative (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]). Thus, the user will confirm the insertion of the GHT marker and elimination of the PCF marker.\nTo verify recombination between attBФC31 and attPФC31 sites and integration of DNA3, the user should choose primers from the sequence around a newly formed junction. A forward primer should correspond to a 3′-end region of DNA3 (FDNA3). A reverse primer should anneal to a 5′-end region of DNA2 (RDNA2; Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]; e.g., F12/R12 primers for VHL gene insertion; see Fig. 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0006]).\nTo verify the integrity of the newly inserted attBФBT1 site, the user should choose a reverse primer complementary to a 5′-end region of DNA3 (RDNA3). B485, corresponding to the PCF sequence, can be used as a forward primer (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0005]).",

    "1. Incubate 1 × 106 HAC-containing CHO cells at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in 10 ml F12 growth medium in a 10-cm culture dish for 18-24 hr.\n2. Remove old medium from the culture dish and add 10 ml F12 growth medium supplemented with 100 μl KaryoMAX™ colcemid. Incubate cells at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 hr.\n3. Collect medium from the culture dish into a 15-ml centrifuge tube.\n4. Add 2 ml PBS to the dish, swirl, and collect PBS into the same 15-ml centrifuge tube.\n5. Add 1.5 ml 0.25% trypsin to the cells and incubate 5 min at 37°C. Collect cell suspension into the same 15-ml centrifuge tube.\n6. Spin down cells in the 15-ml centrifuge tube at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature.\n7. Discard supernatant. Resuspend cells in 10 ml PBS. Spin down at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature.\n8. Discard supernatant. Gently resuspend cells in 10 ml KaryoMAX™ potassium chloride solution, pre-warmed to 37°C.\n9. Incubate cells at 37°C for 20 min.\n10. Prepare the desired amount of fresh fixative solution by mixing three volumes of methanol with one volume of acetic acid. Put on ice.\nYou will need 5 ml per sample.\n11. Transfer tube with the cell suspension into ice. Add 50 μl fixative solution. Mix by inverting the tube.\n12. Centrifuge at 480 × g for 5 min in a pre-cooled (4°C) centrifuge.\nIt is important to use centrifugation without brake to avoid cell attrition, preventing loss of material.\n13. Carefully pipet out as much supernatant as possible, taking care not to touch the cell pellet. Slowly add 1 ml fixative solution to the tube. Do not mix. Incubate cells on ice for 30 min.",
    "14. Gently re-suspend pellet by finger tapping and centrifuge suspension at 480 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\n15. Carefully pipet out as much supernatant as possible, taking care not to touch the cell pellet. Gently re-suspend pellet in 1 ml fresh fixative solution. Centrifuge suspension at 480 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\n16. Repeat step 15 two more times.\n17. Finally, re-suspend cells in 1 ml fixative solution; cells can be stored at -20°C in tightly closed tubes for up to 1 year.\nThis is a safe stopping point.\n18. Treat slides with 50 ml 40% methanol in Coplin jar for 1 hr.\nSlides can be stored in 40% (v/v) methanol in Coplin jar sealed with Parafilm at 4°C up to several years.\n19. Replace methanol with 50 ml 100% ethanol and incubate 1 hr. Put slides in a slide holder and let them air dry at room temperature.\n20. Drop 20 μl of the fixed cells suspension from step 17 onto microscope slides from an ∼10 cm height using a Gilson Pipetman. Place slides on a slide warmer (55°C) where they can be left for 1 hr or longer.\n21. Examine slides under a phase contrast microscope to determine if the spreads are suitable for staining and counting.\nMetaphase chromosome spreads should be easy to find and well separated from each other.\nThe slides can be stored at -20°C in a slide box for up to 1 month.\n22. Put slides into a Coplin jar with 50 ml PBS for 15 min to rehydrate.\n23. Replace PBS with 50 ml formaldehyde fixation solution for 2 min.\n24. Wash slides in a Coplin jar with 50 ml PBS three times for 2 min.",
    "25. Soak slides in a Coplin jar with 50 ml 70% (v/v) ethanol for 2 min.\n26. Soak slides in a Coplin jar with 50 ml 85% (v/v) ethanol for 2 min.\n27. Soak slides in a Coplin jar with 50 ml 100% ethanol for 2 min.\n28. Put slides in a slide holder and let them air dry at room temperature.\n29. Pre-heat slide warmer to 85°C.\n30. For each slide, mix 0.2 μl PNA probe in 20 μl hybridization buffer to a final concentration of 500 nM.\n31. Pre-warm slides on a slide warmer for 5 min.\n32. Heat hybridization buffer containing the PNA probe at 85°C for 5 min.\n33. Add 20 μl hybridization buffer containing the PNA probe onto each slide. Cover with a coverslip.\n34. Heat slides in a slide warmer at 85°C for 10 min.\n35. Place slides in a box onto wet paper towels. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 2 hr.\n36. Immerse slides in wash solution to remove coverslip.\n37. Wash slides in 50 ml wash solution in a Coplin jar twice at 60°C for 10 min.\n38. Wash slides with wash solution at room temperature for 10 min.\n39. Wash with 50 ml PBS in a Coplin jar three times for 5 min.\n40. Soak in a Coplin jar with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min.\n41. Soak in a Coplin jar with 85% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min.\n42. Soak in a Coplin jar with 100% ethanol for 5 min.\n43. Dry slides at room temperature.\n44. Add 25 μl VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI to the slides. Cover with a coverslip. Place slides in the dark at room temperature overnight to let the mounting medium solidify.",
    "Mounted slides can be stored in the dark at -20°C for up to a month.\n45. Observe slides under the fluorescence microscope with filters for DAPI and Alexa Fluor 488.\nThe intact HAC should be visible as a single separate dot in both channels and should be separated from the host chromosomes (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.316#cpz1316-fig-0001], white arrow)."
