    "1. Prepare Samples\nCulture 2 x 106 amyloid producing HT-29 colon cancer cells in a 10-cm tissue culture dish in 10 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Culture cells overnight in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\n\t\nAfter the cells grow to 80% confluency, wash the cells with 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Add 3 mL of Trypsin solution and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min.\nAfter the cells are totally dissociated from the dish, add 10 mL of culture medium and transfer the cells with a 10-mL pipette to a 15-mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature. Aspirate the medium, resuspend the cells in 5 mL of culture medium, and count the cells using a cell counter. Plate 2 x 106 cells in each of two 10-cm dishes.\nAllow the cells to adhere and recover overnight in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Apply treatment to one dish to induce the formation of amyloids with 20 ng/mL Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α), 100 nM Smac-mimetic, and 20 µM pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK11. The combination is abbreviated as TSZ. Treat the other dish with vehicle as a control.\nAfter the appropriate length of time, usually 6 h, harvest the cell lysate.\n\t\nScrape the cells off the plate with a plastic scraper and use a 10-mL pipette to transfer into a 15-mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nWash the cells 2 times by resuspending in 10 mL of ice cold PBS and centrifuging at 1,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the PBS solution.",
    "Note: The process can be paused here by freezing the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen and storing at ˗80 °C for up to 1 month.\nTransfer the cell pellet to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube and incubate in 0.3 mL of lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is the whole cell lysate.\n\t\tNote: The process can be paused here by storing the sample at -20 °C for up to several months.\nMeasure the protein concentration by a Bradford assay according to manufacturer's protocol. Add 4x SDD-AGE loading buffer to prepare 20 µL of 3 µg/µL sample and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\n2. Prepare and Run Gels\nAdd 2 g of agarose to 200 mL of 1x Tris-acetate buffer (TAE) in a glass beaker and heat in a microwave to melt the agarose. Add 1 mL of 20% SDS for a final concentration of 0.1% SDS. Carefully swirl to mix. Take care not to generate bubbles after the SDS addition.\nPour the agarose solution into a 15 cm x 14 cm gel slab. Use a 1-mL pipette to eliminate any bubbles. Place one 20-well comb at the top.\nFirst dimension: Pipette 60 µg of whole cell lysate in the far-right lane. Run the gel at 60 V for about 4 h (until the dye front is about ¾ through the gel) using the TAE containing 0.1% SDS as the running buffer.\nSecond dimension: Carefully rotate the gel 90° counter-clockwise (Figure 2A). Run the gel at 60 V for about 4 h.\n\tNote: The general running condition is 4 V/cm gel length. It is important that the running conditions are exactly the same for the first and second dimensions.\n3. Transfer",
    "Use the capillary transfer method to transfer the proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Figure 2B).\n\t\nAdd 500 mL of transfer buffer to an approximately 20 cm x 20 cm container. Make a 5-cm high stack of paper towels next to the container. The surface area of the top of the stack must be greater than the gel dimensions.\nSoak a 14 cm x 15 cm filter paper in transfer buffer and place on top of the paper towel stack. Take care to place on the paper with no wrinkles or bubbles. Repeat with another piece of filter paper.\nActivate a 14 cm x 15 cm PVDF membrane in methanol for 30 s then layer it on the filter paper taking care to use a roller to remove all bubbles. Rinse the gel off with transfer buffer and layer it on top of the membrane, again rolling out any bubbles.\nCover the edge of the paper towels closest to the container of transfer buffer with plastic wrap. It is important that the paper bridge constructed in the next step does not come into direct contact with the paper towel stack.\nSoak a piece of 15 cm x 35 cm filter paper in transfer buffer and place it so one end covers the top of the gel and the other end is in the container of transfer buffer. Repeat with another bridge.\nCover the container with plastic wrap and leave overnight at room temperature.\n4. Western Blotting Detection\nRinse the membrane with 50 mL of PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) in a 20 cm × 20 cm container. Add 20 mL of 5% milk in PBST. Rock at room temperature for 30 min to block.",
    "Pipette 10 µL of rabbit anti-MLKL antibody into 20 mL of 5% milk in PBST and add to the container. Incubate on rocker overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the membrane in 20 mL of PBST for 5 min. Repeat 5 times.\nPipette 4 µL of anti-rabbit-HRP to 20 mL of 5% milk in PBST and add to the container. Incubate on rocker at room temperature for 2 h.\nWash the membrane in 20 mL of PBST for 5 min. Repeat 5 times.\nAdd enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (ECL) and expose to X-ray films according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
