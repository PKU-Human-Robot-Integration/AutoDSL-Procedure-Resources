This part of the protocol describes quick method for generation of site-specific DNA nicks in λ DNA by Cas9 D10A nickase. These nicked substrates are subsequently melted to yield corresponding gapped substrates. Position of the nick is determined by the choice of the guide RNA sequence. Guide RNA consists of universal tracr-RNA scaffold and customizable crRNA component. We utilized previously characterized crRNAs termed crRNA λ2, crRNA λ4 and crRNA λ5 to generate dsDNA constructs containing nicks with 5 kilonucleotides (knt) and 18 knt distance. The distance between the two nicks is dictated by the combination of the guides. These are further referred in the text as λ4/5 (for 5 knt distance) or λ2/5 (for 18 knt distance) gDNA precursors – according to the combination of guide RNAs used to generate them. Further to our previous work, we provide three additional crRNAs (crRNA λ4.02, crRNA λ4.1, crRNA λ4.2) to generate λ gDNA precursors with 0.2 (λ4/4.02 gDNA precursor), 1 (λ4/4.1 gDNA precursor) and 2 (λ4/4.2 gDNA precursor) knt distance between the nicks.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/717-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "To terminate the reaction, add 500 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 10 mM. Avoid pipetting up-and-down. Store the reaction at 4°C.\nCritical: Care should be taken to avoid mechanically shear or nicking of DNA at any of these steps. We recommend cutting the ends of pipette tips. We strongly advise against repeatedly pipetting up and down. Finally, to avoid any additional unwanted DNA nicking, we do not purify nicked constructs at the final stage as it is normally done for λ dsDNA and λ ssDNA precursor. If purification is absolutely required, this step can be performed, but it will reduce the efficiency of λ gDNA generation in subsequent steps.\nCritical: Avoid freezing λ gDNA precursors as freeze-thaw cycles generates DNA nicks which would lead to reduced efficiency of λ gDNA generation in subsequent steps. λ gDNA precursors can be stored at 4°C for 3–4 weeks.\nNote: In λ DNA, GC content is distributed asymmetrically, with one half of λ DNA sequence being more GC-rich than the other. Given ssDNA gaps are generated in the next step by force-induced DNA melting, it should be taken into account that DNA in GC-rich regions of λ DNA, will be more difficult to melt. Although this should not be an issue for short (up to 5 knt) gaps, generation of larger gaps can be significantly more difficult. We suggest choosing position of the gap carefully when designing RNA guides for nicking. If there are no specific underlying sequence requirements, we suggest designing gaps in the GC-poor half of λ DNA first.

Find appropriate z position for the trapping laser in the middle of the microfluidics channel. Add oil on top of microfluidics chip. Lower the condenser to close position, where reflection image is fully visible on the camera. Inspect the reflection image (‘the moon’) to ensure absence of bubbles in immersion oil and proper condenser position. Lower laser power of the trapping laser to reach 0.14 pN/nm trap stiffness.",
    "Add 4.5-μm SPHERO Streptavidin Coated polystyrene particles in filtered sterile PBS at 0.005% w/v to channel 1, 0.2% (v/v) λ gDNA precursor constructs prepared in Step 4 of the protocol in filtered sterile PBS to channel 2, filtered sterile PBS to channel 3, 5 nM RPA-eGFP in buffer 0.5×NTM (1×NTM buffer consists of 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 0.2 mg/mL BSA and the oxygen scavenger system with 5 mM protocatechuic acid (PCA), 100 nM protocatechuic dioxygenase (PCD) to channel 4 and 50 nM SYTOX Orange in filtered sterile PBS to channel 5. Flow enough liquid through the system to observe beads in channel 1 in brightfield.\nCapture a pair of beads in channel 1 and move to channel 2. Perform force calibration according to manufacturer instruction at 0.14 pN/nm trap stiffness.\nMove beads apart to sufficient distance (we suggest 25 μm between the bead edges). Adjust z position in Trap XY settings to get both beads into the focus. Turn on single-photon counter module. Turn on blue laser to 5% laser power. Turn on green laser to 10 % laser power. Set pixel size to 100 nm. Perform a single 2D scan and adjust scanning area to include both beads. Make sure that reflection in the middle of the beads in blue channel is sharp and bright.

    "Move traps to channel 2, set “ping-pong” option that automatically moves the traps between 5 (‘close’) and 17 μm (‘extended’) distance marks at 6.0 μm/s speed with 1–2 s dwell time at 5 μm position. Set force to zero at 5 μm `close’ distance between the bead edges. Keep pressure of 0.12–0.18 bar to maintain buffer flow. “Ping-pong” regime allows to determine whether dsDNA has been tethered between the beads as evident by the sudden increase of force when the beads are moving apart.\nMonitor force-extension curve. Use built-in worm-like chain models to set an example curve for single λ dsDNA molecule. Small deviations from the model may occur, if the flow is present, but your experimentally obtained force data should roughly follow this model. Once a single molecule of λ gDNA precursor is captured – as judged by force-extension plot, turn off the buffer flow, close all the channels and move the traps to channel 3. It is possible to capture multiple DNA molecules at once. If this occurs, repeat the process by picking up new beads from channel 1 or extend the bead distance beyond 23 μm to break one or more extra molecules captured between the beads.\nIn channel 3, move the beads to 'close’ distance, set force to zero and slowly extend the DNA molecule either to 23–25 μm distance between the bead edges (or 65 pN force and above) to generate short gaps as in the case of λ4/5 gDNA and smaller precursors, or 27–29 μm distance (or 100 pN force and above) to generate longer gaps as in the case of λ2/5 gDNA precursor. After 30 – 60 s of holding λ gDNA precursor at high force move the beads to 5 to 10 μm distance.",
    "Wait for 1 min at low force and then slowly re-extend captured construct to 15 pN force. Monitor force-extension curve (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).

The magnitude of which depends on the following: a) duration of over-stretching: the longer the DNA construct is held at 80 pN, the more hysteresis is observable. Above 65 pN dsDNA gradually melts. The more melted/frayed ssDNA, the longer it takes to re-anneal it to dsDNA upon relaxing the force. b) similarly, the higher the force at which we hold the over-stretched tether, the more hysteresis is observed. c) the speed at which the trap is moved (pulling/relaxation rate). d) the gap size: the longer the size of the gap, the less stable are the corresponding dsDNA segments and the longer the re-annealing might take.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/717-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Arrows indicate the direction of the pulling.",
    "Optional: Force-induced DNA melting can be performed in the presence of RPA-eGFP (channel 4) or even in channel 2 containing λ gDNA precursor. In case of DNA melting in the presence of RPA, DNA can be melted faster, but upon returning to the low-force position, longer waiting time is required to fully anneal frayed ssDNA ends on the side of the gap. In case where DNA is melted in the same channel as where λ gDNA precursor is being captured, caution should be taken not to move beads too close (7 μm distance or less) after DNA melting to avoid capturing second DNA molecule. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]\nUsing gDNA substrates to monitor molecular dynamics at a single-molecule level\nTiming: 6–8 h per day, 2–5 days of data collection\nHere we describe an example of λ gDNA construct usage to determine growth polarity of RAD-51 filaments. RAD-51 is a metazoan recombinase that forms helical nucleoprotein filaments on resected RPA-coated ssDNA ends to facilitate DNA double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. Its bacterial homolog, RecA, has been shown to grow on ssDNA bidirectionally with 2-fold kinetic preference in a 5’ to 3’ direction along the ssDNA backbone (Bell et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). To determine the growth polarity of nematode RAD-51 filaments (Belan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), λ2/5 gDNA substrate will be used as described later. It should be noted, however, that gDNA substrates described in this protocol have a wide variety of usage for different enzymatic reactions including helicase unwinding, 3’ end extension by polymerases, nucleolytic processing, etc.",
    "The flow cell is washed and the microscope aligned as described in the previous section. However, different buffers are added to individual channels: add 4.5-μm SPHERO Streptavidin coated polystyrene particles in filtered sterile PBS at 0.005% w/v to channel 1, 0.2% (v/v) λ2/5 gDNA precursor construct prepared previously in filtered sterile PBS to channel 2, 5 nM RPA-eGFP in buffer 0.5×NTM (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 0.2 mg/mL BSA and the oxygen scavenger system with 5 mM PCA, 100 nM PCD to channel 3 and 500 nM RAD-51 in buffer 1×NTM (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 0.2 mg/mL BSA, 1 mM ATP, ATP regeneration system (20 mM creatine phosphate and 20 μg/mL creatine kinase) and the oxygen scavenger system with 5 mM PCA, 100 nM PCD to channel 4.\nPerform force calibration, set up confocal imaging, capture beads and tether a single piece of λ gDNA precursor as described previously.\nMove the traps to channel 3, move the beads to ‘close’ distance, set force to zero and slowly extend the DNA molecule to 27–29 μm distance (or 100 pN force and above) to generate longer gaps as in the case of λ2/5 gDNA precursor. After 30 – 60 s of holding λ gDNA precursor at high force move the beads to 5 to 10 μm distance. Wait for 1–5 min for DNA strands to re-anneal as RPA-eGFP slows it down.",

    "Continue building kymograph of RPA-eGFP displacement. Force can be monitored at the same time as fluorescence. RAD-51 displacement should be evident as the loss of blue fluorescence signal. In the absence of RAD-51, minimal loss of RPA-eGFP signal should be present for at least 20 min (Belan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) as RPA binds very tightly to ssDNA (Ma et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). If rapid fluorescence loss is observed, this is likely due to extensive photobleaching - fresh batch of PCA/PCD should be prepared. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7]\nCritical: Due to variation in RAD-51 and RPA-eGFP preparations, we suggest finding an optimal concentration of RAD-51 where fast-enough assembly can be observed. This is done by adding increasing concentrations of RAD-51 to channel 4 (e.g., from 200 to 2000 nM protein) and performing a few assembly experiments for each concentration. The optimal concentration of RAD-51 (and optionally also free RPA-eGFP) should yield frequent nucleation events, but sparse enough to grow most filaments to at least 0.5-1.0 μm in length.\nCritical: To maintain consistent rate of RAD-51 filament growth, good passivation of the channel 4 is needed. If inefficient filament assembly is observed on the first DNA molecules captured, we suggest passivating the channel with 1 mL of 0.5 % BSA in PBS, then repeating the assembly experiments. Slightly slower assembly rates can be observed in a few of the initial kymographs, but rates should become consistent as more RAD-51 is flowed through the channel throughout the course of the experimental data collection.",
    "Optional: To better resolve individual growing RAD-51 filaments, 10 nM free RPA-eGFP can be included with RAD-51 in channel 4. This will supress RAD-51 nucleation on ssDNA, resulting in sparser filaments that are better resolved. However, fewer filaments per single kymograph will be collected. This will prolong the time needed for sample collection.\nImage and force data analysis\nTiming: 1–2 days depending on the experiment\nThis section briefly mentions a few options for imaging and force data analysis. Generally, raw kymographs are accessed through Pylake package and then multiple parameters can be exported and further processed in different software. Although the specific data analysis method heavily depends on the nature of the experiment, we provide several analysis pipelines for common readouts.\nThe .h5 files containing kymographs, force data or 2D scans are accessed through Lumicks Pylake package. Imaging data are exported as TIFFs.\nThe exported kymographs can be analyzed using Fiji by plotting integrated fluorescence intensity in individual channels. This can be done for specific genomic positions of DNA along x axis of the kymograph to provide time-resolved information.\nThe force data can be exported through Lumicks Pylake package. If longer observation windows are employed (more than 5 min), we suggest to significantly down-sample the force data. For example, to 3 Hz.\nTo analyze genomic positions of DNA-bound fluorescent molecules, previously described approaches can be used (Newton et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Similar previously-described approaches can be used to track moving particles and analyze diffusion rates along gapped DNA molecules (Graneli et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nTo determine the number of fluorophores within a single cluster of fluorescent particles bound to gDNA, a single-step photobleaching analysis can be employed as described previously (Autour et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Belan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). To find individual steps, a step-finding algorithm in Matlab is employed."
