    "Yeast transformationWe transformed the yeast strain W303-1B/Gal4-∆Pep4 (leu2-3, his3-11,15, trp1-1::TRP1-GAL10-GAL4, ura3-1, ade2-1, canr, cir+, ∆Pep4 MATα) with the pYeDP60 vector containing hATP13A2 WT or the catalytically dead E343A mutant according to the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method with minor modifications (Gietz and Woods, 2002).Plate the yeast from the glycerol stock on a YPD-agar plate and incubate for 48 h at 30 °C.Inoculate 20 ml YPD medium from the fresh plate and incubate overnight at 30 °C, 230 rpm in a shaking incubator.Measure the OD of the overnight culture at 600 nm (OD600).Note: 1 OD600 equals approximately 107 cells/ml. Dilute the culture to 0.1 OD600 in 10 ml YPD and incubate for 4-6 h at 30 °C, 230 rpm in a shaking incubator until the OD600 of the culture lies between 0.4 and 0.8.Spin down the cell amount equivalent to 2 OD600 (= ± 2 x 107 cells) in swinging buckets (700 x g; 5 min).Wash the pellet in 1 ml sterile MQ and resuspend with a pipet tip. Transfer to an Eppendorf tube.Spin down the cells (2,500 x g; 2 min) using a microcentrifuge.Resuspend pellet in 1 ml 1x TE/LiAc.Spin down the cells (2,500 x g; 2 min) using a microcentrifuge.Resuspend pellet in 100 µl 1x TE/LiAc.Add 10 µl of single-stranded herring sperm DNA.Add 1 to 5 µg of plasmid DNA.Vortex.Add 600 µl of PEG solution.Vortex.Incubate for 45 min at 30 °C (volume = approximately 730 µl).Add DMSO to a final concentration of 10% (approximately 73 µl).Heat shock at 42 °C for 15 min.Cool on ice for 1-2 min.Spin down the cells (2,500 x g; 2 min) using a microcentrifuge.Resuspend pellet in 200 µl of YPD and incubate for 2 h at 30 °C.Spin down the cells (2,500 x g; 2 min) using a microcentrifuge.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in sterile MQ and plate onto an SD-uracil agar plate.Incubate the plate for 48 h at 30 °C to recover transformants.Yeast cultureHere, we followed a similar strategy as described before (Jidenko et al., 2006; Azouaoui et al., 2014) with minor modifications.Inoculate 20 ml of SD-uracil medium from the fresh plate (Step A24) to further select for yeast cells that carry the plasmid with URA3 selection marker and incubate for 24 h at 28 °C and 200 rpm in a shaking incubator.Measure the OD600 of the culture.Inoculate 100 ml of SD-uracil medium to a final OD600 of 0.2 and incubate for 12 h at 28 °C and 200 rpm in a shaking incubator.Measure the OD600 of the culture.Inoculate 3.6 L of YPGE2X medium to a final OD600 of 0.05 and incubate for 36 h at 28 °C and 175 rpm in a shaking incubator.Note: Nine 1,000 ml culture flasks containing 400 ml of yeast culture. Induce ATP13A2-BAD expression with 2% galactose (50 ml of 20% galactose solution per 500 ml culture) and incubate for 12 h at 18 °C and 175 rpm in a shaking incubator.Note: The temperature downshift from 28 °C to 18 °C will reduce the rate of protein synthesis and therefore, facilitate proper protein folding, increasing the yield of properly folded and functional overexpressed protein. In addition, the lower temperature will decrease protein degradation. Repeat galactose induction to ensure high overexpression levels of ATP13A2-BAD and incubate for another 12 h at 18 °C and 175 rpm in a shaking incubator.Spin down the yeast cells (1,000 x g; 10 min; 4 °C).Weigh the pellet.Note: The yield is typically 20-30 g/L yeast culture. The cell pellet can be processed directly or stored at -20 °C for a maximum of 2 weeks.",
    "Yeast membrane preparationIn case yeast cell pellet was frozen, thaw on ice.Resuspend cell pellet in TEKS buffer (volume (ml) = approximately 2 x the weight of the cell pellet (g) as determined in step B9) and incubate for 15 min at 4 °C while mixing with a magnetic stirrer.Spin down the cells (1,000 x g; 10 min; 4 °C).Resuspend the pellet in TESin buffer (volume (ml) = approximately 1 x the weight of the cell pellet (g) as determined in Step B9).Break the yeast cells using a BeadBeater.Fill the chamber with 200 ml yeast suspension (add TES in buffer if not enough) and add 200 ml cold glass beads. Chamber should be as full as possible.Fill ice water jacket with crushed ice and water.Bead-beat in cold room for 5 min. Pause for 3 min after every min to reduce heating of the sample and BeadBeater.Recover crude extract using Büchner funnel and vacuum pump.Test the pH of the lysate by using pH paper and, if necessary, adjust the pH of the crude extract to pH 7.5 with saturated NaOH solution.Centrifuge the crude extract at 2,000 x g for 20 min (4 °C).Centrifuge the resulting supernatant at 20,000 x g for 20 min using ultracentrifuge rotor  Type 45 Ti  (4 °C).Centrifuge the resulting supernatant at 200,000 x g for 1 h using ultracentrifuge rotor  Type 45 Ti  (4 °C).Resuspend the resulting pellet (that is, the light membrane fraction, P3) in HS buffer.Note: The volume for resuspension should be determined by eye and be the minimal amount required to homogeneously dissolve the pellet. Determine the protein concentration of the P3 fraction using a classical Bradford assay (with known BSA concentrations as a protein standard).Note: The measured protein concentration typically ranges between 35-50 mg/ml.",
    "For downstream reconstitution purposes, a minimum yield of 70 mg total protein is required per experiment. Aliquot the P3 membranes per 2 ml and freeze in liquid N2.Store at -80 °C.Note: The membranes can be stored at -80 °C for a maximum of 6 months. Reconstitution of yeast membranesTo reconstitute yeast membranes, we followed a similar strategy as described before (Papadopulos et al., 2007) with some modifications.Dilute 2 ml of the P3 membranes (thawed on ice) to 10 µg/µl in buffer T/DDM.Note: The amount of total protein should be at least 70 mg. Incubate for 45 min at 4 °C in a head-over-head rotator.Centrifuge for 30 min at 200,000 x g to pellet the insoluble fraction using ultracentrifuge rotor  Type 90 Ti  (4 °C).Supplement 2 ml of the supernatant, i.e., detergent extract, with an equal volume of buffer T/lipid mix and for the “ATP inside” condition, also an equal volume of ATP-regenerating system (Table 1):Table 1.Sample preparation for reconstitutionimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210117/20210117185929_1066.jpg Incubate the samples with 100 mg/ml Bio-Beads for 3 h at room temperature in a head-over-head rotator to remove the DDM and reconstitute proteoliposomes.Add 200 mg/ml Bio-Beads and incubate overnight at 4 °C in a head-over-head rotator.Centrifuge for 1 h at 200,000 x g using ultracentrifuge rotor  Type 90 Ti  (4 °C).Recover vesicles by resuspending the pellet in 2 ml of buffer T.Note: The measured protein concentration typically ranges between 1-5 mg/ml. Determine the protein concentration using a classical Bradford assay.Check reconstituted protein levels via Western blot (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3888/bioprotoc-11-02-3888-g003.jpgFigure 3. Immunoblot of yeast membranes and reconstituted vesicles. P3 membranes containing ATP13A2-BAD are solubilized by the detergent DDM. The detergent extract is supplemented with the lipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid, and then treated with Bio-Beads to remove the DDM and reconstitute proteoliposomes (‘no ATP’).",
    "To generate proteoliposomes that contained intraluminal ATP (‘ATP inside’), we added ATP and an ATP-regenerating system before incubation with the Bio-Beads. Reconstituted ATP13A2-BAD protein levels are checked via Western blot analysis using primary anti-ATP13A2 antibody (1/1,000) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/2,000). 12 µl of sample was loaded per lane.Polyamine transport assayNote:  The polyamine transport assay should be performed in a designated radioactive area by authorized personnel and radioactive material handling precautions have to be undertaken. Gloves, lab goggles, lab coats and a dosimeter to monitor personal exposure should be worn at all times. The work should be performed behind Plexiglass screens and only pipette tips with filters should be used. The regulations of the institution should be followed for the storage of radioactive material, and disposal of solid and liquid radioactive waste. Measure [3H]-SPM uptake into freshly prepared vesicles within 60 min. Dilute the freshly prepared vesicles (“no ATP” or “ATP inside”) to 1 µg/µl in buffer T.Note: We typically use 1 ml of vesicles. At least 300 µg (“ATP inside” vesicles) – 600 µg (“no ATP” vesicles) is required to proceed to the next steps. Place four 0.45 µm Millipore filters on filtration manifold (Figure 4).Note: Filters are pre-wet in MQ. Use tweezers to hold them. Wash each filter with 4 ml 1x reaction buffer.Pipet the following into the reaction tubes for the different conditions (in duplo) (Table 2):Table 2. Sample preparation for transport assay imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210117/20210117185942_6535.jpg Slightly vortex to thoroughly mix (avoid air bubble formation).Place the reaction tube in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min.Start the reaction by adding 100 µl [3H]-SPM/unlabeled SPM mix (final total SPM concentration: 1 mM).",
    "Take out 300 μl (45 µg vesicles) at chosen time points (0 min, 10 min) and pipet each aliquot on a different filter allowing to remove the liquid phase.Wash each filter with 4 ml 1x reaction buffer.Place the filters in the scintillation vials containing 7 ml scintillation liquid.Repeat steps for the remaining reaction tubes.Measure samples with a liquid scintillation counter.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3888/bioprotoc-11-02-3888-g004.jpgFigure 4.
