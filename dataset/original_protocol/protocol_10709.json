    "1. Systemic Delivery In vivo\nMix enough HerDox with sterile saline to equate 0.2 ml of a 0.004 mg/kg dose of HerDox per injection for a 6-8 week old NU/NU mouse bearing subcutaneous bilateral flank xenograft tumors.\nGently draw the HerDox mixture into a 3/10 cc insulin syringe fitted with a 29G needle, avoiding bubbles.\nAnesthesia is induced by brief isoflurane exposure in an induction chamber equipped with a gas scavenging system (Oxygen flow rates: 0.5-1 L/min, isoflurane concentration: 3-4% (or lower).\nInject the entire mixture into the tail vein of an anesthetized mouse (0.2 ml per injection). IV injection can also be performed in a restrained, unanesthetized mouse.\nRepeat injections on the same mouse for six more sequential days, once per day.\n2. Fluorescence Imaging In vivo\nThe accumulation of HerDox fluorescence in tumors can be detectable by the last day of injection (Day 7) using a multimode imager. The procedures below entail the use of a customized macro-illumination and detection system (Figure 1) 8.\nTurn on the Multimode In vivo Optical Imager.\nSelect an emission bandpass filter (590 nm ± 30 nm) suited for doxorubicin fluorescence detection.\nTurn on Argon-Krypton laser and place an excitation bandpass filter (488 nm ± 10 nm) at the laser optical path.\nTurn on the anesthesia system and then place a mouse into the anesthetizing chamber (Oxygen flow rates: 0.5-1 L/min, isoflurane concentration: 3-4% (or lower)equipped with a gas scavenging system.\nTransfer the mouse from the anesthetizing chamber to the imaging chamber of the Multimode In vivo Optical Imager when the mouse is anesthetized.\nPlace a nosecone over the nose of the mouse and open the flow to administer continuous anesthesia during image acquisition (Oxygen flow rates: 0.5-1 L/min, isoflurane concentration: 2-3% (or lower).",
    "Acquire fluorescence images using an exposure time of 5-15 sec.\nPerform image analysis and processing including background correction or contrast adjustment.\n3. Fluorescence Imaging Ex vivo\nHerDox fluorescence can be imaged in tumors and specific organs (including the liver, kidney, spleen, heart, and skeletal muscle) harvested from euthanized mice at 24 hr after the final (Day 7) injection of HerDox.\nTurn on the Multimode In vivo Optical Imager.\nSelect an emission bandpass filter (580 nm ± 20 nm) for Doxorubicin fluorescence detection.\nTurn on Argon-Krypton laser and place an excitation bandpass filter (488 nm ±10 nm) at the laser optical path.\nPlace tumors and specific organs arranged on a Petri-dish into the imaging chamber of the Multimode In vivo Optical Imager.\nAcquire fluorescence images of tissues using an exposure time of 5-15 sec. An example of initial fluorescence image acquisition is shown in Figure 2a. Repeat the same using an empty Petri-dish, which will serve as the Background (Figure 2b).\nPerform image analysis and processing including background correction or contrast adjustment. An example of a corrected image is shown in Figure 2c, resulting from subtraction of Figure 2b from Figure 2a.\n4. In situ Confocal Imaging of Tumors\nIn situ confocal imaging allows detection and analysis of HerDox tumor accumulation at the cellular level.\nTurn on a Leica SPE confocal microscope.\nSelect 488 nm laser light for excitation of doxorubicin and emission wavelengths (560-620 nm) for doxorubicin fluorescence detection.\nSelect a 40X or 63X objective and drop immersion oil on the objective lens.\nExtract fresh tumors from euthanized mice that previously received HerDox and mock treatments as described in procedure 2.\nPlace tumors on a Petri-dish on ice to avoid tissue degradation, and then transfer the tumors to a Delta T chamber for confocal imaging.",
    "Acquire confocal images of the tumors at sequential focal depths (step size: 1 μm, thickness: 20 μm). An example of sequentially-acquired images along the z-axis is shown in Figure 3, left panel.\nPerform maximum intensity z-projection of the images. A maximum intensity projection of z-stacked images is shown in Figure 3, right panel.\nCalculate mean fluorescence intensities of the maximum intensity Z-projection images. Mean fluorescence intensities of the images over the overall field of view were calculated using ImageJ.\n5. Ratiometric Spectral Imaging and Analysis\nRatiometric spectral imaging and analysis allows discrimination between Dox fluorescence and autofluorescence.\nPower on a laser scanning fluorescence confocal microscope.\nAcquire 15 images of the HerDox-treated and untreated tumors at a specified depth within the spectral range of 510-650 nm, with a step size of 10 nm, and excitation at 488 nm light using a Leica SPE confocal microscope.\nPrepare a 100 μM solution of doxorubicin.\nPerform spectral imaging of the 100 μM doxorubicin solution to obtain the pure spectral signature of Dox fluorescence (spectral range: 510-650 nm, a step size: 10 nm). Typical results of image acquisition from spectral imaging and resulting fluorescence spectrum plotted as a graph are shown in Figure 4.\nAcquire the autofluorescence spectral signature from an image cube (spectral range: 510-650 nm, a step size: 10 nm) obtained by spectral imaging of untreated tumors. Typical results of image acquisition from spectral imaging and resulting fluorescence spectrum plotted as a graph are shown in Figure 5.\nGenerate four reference spectral signatures (pure autofluorescence, 0.1.doxorubin+0.9.autofluorescence, 0.2. doxorubicin+0.8.autofluorescence, 0.3.doxorubin+0.7.autofluorescence) using the program we developed 9. A typical curve showing four reference spectral signatures is shown in Figure 6.\nPerform spectral classification of the images as defined by the reference spectral signatures through Euclidean distance measure using the program we previously developed 9.",
    "Perform linear spectral unmixing of those images by using a spectral unmixing program (plug-in in ImageJ) we developed 7, 10, for comparison to the ratiometric spectral imaging and analysis. An example of separating HerDox fluorescence from autofluorescence by linear spectral unmixing is shown in Figure 7.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
