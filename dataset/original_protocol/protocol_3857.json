Dendritic cells in vivo expansion, ex vivo separation, and homogenization (steps 1 and 2)\nHomogenization of dendritic cells and late endosomal preparation\nTiming: 2 h\nIn vivo Flt3L-induced splenic murine DC (1–3 × 108), (Clement et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) are washed three times in 20 mL PBS and pelleted for 10 min at 500 × g.\nThe cellular pellet is resuspended in 1 mL PBS containing 0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (containing 1 mM EDTA).\nCells are homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer twice, each time for 10 min, on ice. The homogenate is spin at 150 × g for 10 min, at 4°C in a desktop microcentrifuge after each homogenization step.\nThe pellet contains cellular debris and nuclei: the homogenate is examined under a microscope to ensure complete cellular lysis.\nThe combined supernatants from two rounds of homogenization steps (2 mL) are loaded above 9 mL of 27% Percoll, which is laid over 1 mL of 2.5M sucrose in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) cushion and centrifuged for 1 h at 34,000 × g, in open-top ultracentrifuge polycarbonate tubes at 4°C in a SW Ti41 rotor using a Beckman Optima XPN 100K Ultracentrifuge.",
    "The band above the sucrose cushion corresponds to the total lysosomal fraction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/771-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sequential scheme of late endosomes purification by sucrose gradient (steps 3–8)\n(Castellino and Germain, 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])\nThe band at the interface, enriched in late and early endosomes, is removed with a P1000 pipette\nThe collected interface is further separated on a gradient made of 9 mL 10% Percoll laid on top of 1 mL of 2.5 m sucrose in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) cushion and centrifuged for 1 h at 34,000 × g, at 4°C in a SW Ti41 rotor using a Beckman Optima XPN 100k Ultracentrifuge.\nThe late endosomal fraction is collected at the interface between the Percoll and the sucrose layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nThe late endosomal fraction is washed three times with 30 mL of PBS containing 0.25 M sucrose and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) for 10 min each time at 3000 × g and 4°C.\nA small aliquot from the late endosomal fraction is used to determine the total protein concentration using the BCA assay.\nThe endosomal preparation was originally published by Castellino and Germain (Castellino and Germain, 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nIn vitro processing of HEL and OVA proteins using purified late endosomes\nTiming: 7–13 h\nNative OVA and HEL (3–5 μg from a 2 mg/mL stock solution) are incubated with late endosomes purified from control C57BL/6J or Ob/Ob mice (0.5–1 μg of total endosomal protein) in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.5 (with 2.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT) for 6 and 12 h at 37°C. The total assay volume is 200 μL.\nThe proteolysis reaction is quenched with 0.5% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid.",
    "Processed peptides are extracted through a 10 kDa MWCO (molecular weight cut-off), using 10 kDa centrifugal filter units, by centrifugation in a desktop microcentrifuge at 8000 g for 10 min.\nPeptides are purified using C18 zip tips and lyophilized using a Speed-Vac microcentrifuge (Clement et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Clement et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])\nPeptide extracts are reconstituted in 25 μL 5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and separated on a nano-ACQUITY (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) UPLC with technical triplicate injections.\nA 3.0 μL injection is loaded in 5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at 4.0 μL/min for 4.0 min onto a 100 μm I.D. fused-silica precolumn packed with 2 cm of 5 μm (200 Å) Magic C18AQ (Bruker-Michrom, Auburn, CA).\nThe used solvents are A) water (0.1% formic acid); and B) acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid). A linear gradient is developed from 5% solvent A to 35% solvent B in 90 min.\nIons are introduced by positive electrospray ionization via liquid junction into a Q Exactive hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo12 Fisher Scientific).\nMass spectra are acquired over m/z 300–1750 at 70,000 resolution (m/z-200), and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) selected the top 10 most abundant precursor ions in each scan for tandem mass spectrometry by HCD fragmentation using an isolation width of 1.6 Da, collision energy of 27, and a resolution of 17,500.\nDDA raw files are filtered, de novo sequenced and assigned with protein ID using Peaks 8.5/X/X+ software (Bioinformatics Solutions, Waterloo, Canada), by searching against the Swiss-Prot FASTA database (https://www.uniprot.org[href=https://www.uniprot.org]), using selected species corresponding to the processed antigens.",
    "The following settings are applied for peptide search: “no enzyme”, parent mass tolerance of 15 ppm or lower (10–12 ppm) using monoisotopic mass, and fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.05–0.1 Da(depending on the mass spectrometer used to collect the raw files). Methionine, lysine, proline, arginine, cysteine and asparagine oxidations (+15.99 on CKMNPR), deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (NQ-0.98) and pyro-Glu from glutamine (Q-18.01 N-term) are set as variable modifications at the first round of search.\nThe estimation of false discovery rate (FDR) using decoy-fusion algorithm is enabled during the PEAKS DB search in PEAKS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/771-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Analysis of OVA processed peptides\n(A) LC-MS heat map view, extracted in PEAKS, of OVA-digested endosomal peptides. Identified OVA-derived peptide epitopes are highlighted in red and the pool of endosomal endogenous peptides are in blue. The total number of identified features (m/z, RT) is shown in open squared purple.\n(B) Ion extracted chromatogram (XIC) shows the MS1 envelope profiles corresponding to the parent ions for a pair of representative sample set together with the computed areas. Representative MS/MS fragmentation profile (y and b ions) of an OVA peptide epitope. Assignment was done using PEAKS software and an FDR<1%.\nData are validated using the false discovery rate (FDR) method built in PEAKS 8.5/X/X+ and protein identifications are further accepted if they can be identified with a confidence score (−10lgP)>20 for peptides and (−10lgP)>20 for proteins (corresponding to p<0.01); a minimum of 1 peptide per protein after data are filtered for less than 1.0% FDR for peptides and less than 1.5 % FDR for proteins identifications.\nIn addition, selected peptides epitopes with 15< (−10lgP) <20 are included in the data set after manual inspection of their tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra.",
    "An independent validation of the MS/MS-based peptides identifications is performed with Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.6.2 and higher, Proteome Software Inc., USA) using the compatible “.mzid” files of all samples exported from PEAKS.\nPeptide identifications are accepted if they can be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction. Protein identifications can be accepted if they can be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least 1 identified peptide (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/771-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Chromatogram of the endosomal processed peptidomes and related OVA sequence coverage\nBase peak intensities and extracted chromatograms for OVA, as processed by B6 (upper panel) and Ob/Ob (lower panel) endosomes. MS/MS derived OVA peptide-sequence coverage is highlighted in yellow and amino acids with identified post-translational modifications are shown in green.\nOnce the peptide epitopes derived from each antigen processing are identified and validated using the described FDR and statistics tests implemented in PEAKS and/or Scaffold, the built-in label-free quantitation (LFQ) PEAKS Q module is further employed to compare the sequence space and the quantity for the peptidomes derived from different late endosomal processing conditions.\nA heat map generated in PEAKS’ label-free method is used to contrast the hot spots for antigen processing. The LFQ heat map is based on the relative abundance of all peptide features detected in multiple samples (including the m/z, RT (retention time) and peptide precursor’s MS1 area) (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/771-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
