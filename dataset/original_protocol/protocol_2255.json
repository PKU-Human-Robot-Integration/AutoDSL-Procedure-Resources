    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGenerating human GeCKO v2 lentiviral library\nTiming: 6 days\nBelow we provided a detailed step-by-step protocol for generating the human GeCKO v2 lentiviral library from the purchased human GeCKO v2 plasmid library.\nHuman GeCKO v2 Pooled library contains over 100,000 unique gRNAs targeting 19,052 human genes (Sanjana et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The lentiviral plasmid library is originally purchased from Addgene and then amplified strictly following the manufacturer’s protocol (https://media.addgene.org/cms/filer_public/b5/fd/b5fde702-d02c-4873-806f-24ac28b2a15a/GeCKO v20_library_amplification_protocol_1.pdf).\nNote: GeCKO v2 library is delivered and amplified as two half-libraries (A and B). Combine the two plasmid half-libraries with a 1:1 ratio before making the lentiviral library.\nSeed 293T cells into two 150 mm dishes at a seeding density of 5 × 106 cells/plate with the antibiotic-free DMEM complete (no Penicillin/Streptomycin).\nGrow the cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 and allow the cells to achieve 80% confluency.\nTransfection of HEK293T cells using PolyJet transfection reagent is performed following the manufacturer’s protocol (https://signagen.com/DataSheet/SL100688.pdf[href=https://signagen.com/DataSheet/SL100688.pdf]) with some modifications.\nFor each 150 mm plate, replace the medium with 20 mL of fresh antibiotic-free DMEM complete 30 min before transfection.\nFor each 150 mm plate, prepare two clean 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes. Add 0.5 mL of DMEM (serum-free), 10 μg of psPAX2, 1 μg of pMD2.G, and 10 μg of GeCKO v2 plasmid library into one tube. Add 0.5 mL of DMEM (serum-free) and 48 μL of PolyJet into the other tube. Mix well by gentle pipetting respectively.\nAdd the diluted PolyJet immediately into the diluted plasmids, pipette up and down 3–4 times, or vortex briefly to mix.\nIncubate the mix at 25°C for 10–15 min.\nCarefully transfer the mixture to the HEK293T cell culture dropwise and rock the dish to spread the mixture evenly. Put the cells back in the incubator.\nHarvest GeCKO v2 lentiviral library.",
    "At 18 h post-transfection, replace the medium with 20 mL of fresh DMEM complete in each plate. Grow the cells for additional 30 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nNote: At this step, all operations should be as gentle as possible, as 293T cells may easily be detached from the plate.\nAt 48 h post-transfection, collect the culture medium containing the lentiviral library to a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube (low retention).\nOptional: To completely remove the detached cells and cell debris, centrifuge the tube at 500 g for 5 min. Then filter the supernatant through a 0.45 μm syringe filter to a new 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nSplit the lentiviral solution into 1 mL aliquots in the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Store the lentivirus in the −80°C freezer.\nLentiviral titer estimation\nTiming: 5 days\nBelow we provided a detailed step-by-step protocol for estimating the titer of the lentiviral library. A lentiviral library with high titer would be beneficial to generate a high-quality pooled cell library.\nSeed HeLa-Cas9 cells into the 6-well plate with a seeding density of 0.3 × 106 cells/plate and incubate the cells at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 h, the cells should be ∼80% confluent. Thaw the GeCKO v2 lentiviral library on ice.\nPrepare six 15 mL tubes and dilute the lentiviral library in DMEM complete with a 3-fold serial dilution (dilution factors of 3, 9, 27, 81, and 243, respectively). Leave one well without lentiviral infection as a control.\nRemove the medium in the 6-well plate and transfer the diluted lentiviral library solution to each well.\nAfter 12 h, replace the medium with fresh DMEM complete.\nAt 24 h post-transfection, change the medium with DMEM complete containing 2.5 μg/mL puromycin.",
    "Incubate the cells with DMEM complete containing 2.5 μg/mL puromycin for 48 h. Trypsin digest and count live cell numbers with trypan blue staining.\nPlot infected cell ratio (estimated by colony-forming method) versus dilution rate into a chart (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The multiplicity of infection (MOI) is approximately equal to the infected cell ratio at low numbers (<20%).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1862-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Estimation of MOI\nA representative plot of the percentage of infected cells versus dilution rate.\nEstimate the lentivirus volume that can achieve an MOI of 0.3 for the next step (Shalem et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nPooled cell library preparation\nTiming: 8 days\nBelow we provided a detailed step-by-step protocol for the preparation of the pooled CRISPR cell library. We recommend checking the gRNA coverage of the starting cell library sample before starting the toxin screen, though it can also be performed by the end of the whole screen process.\nSeed HeLa-Cas9 cells into four 15 cm dishes at a seeding density of 8 × 106 cells/plate and incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 h of incubation, the cells would reach 80% confluent.\nThaw the GeCKO v2 lentiviral library on ice. Transfect the HeLa-Cas9 cells at an MOI of 0.3 and put the cells back in the incubator.\nNote: Add the lentiviruses dropwise into the cell culture, and rock gently three to four times to ensure the even separation of the viruses.\nAt 12 h post-infection, replace the medium with 20 mL of fresh DMEM complete.\nAt 24 h post-infection, replace the medium with 20 mL of DMEM complete containing 2.5 μg/mL puromycin to start the puromycin selection.\nKeep the cells under 2.5 μg/mL puromycin for 48 h. Change the medium every 24 h.",
    "Replace the medium with 20 mL of DMEM complete containing 1.25 μg/mL puromycin and incubate for additional 48 h. Change the medium every 24 h.\nNote: Passage cells into a new plate if the confluency is too high.\nTrypsin-digest all cells and combined all cells. Freeze half of the cells at −80°C as a backup stock. For the rest of the cells, seed into three 15 cm dishes and allow to grow to 70% confluent.\nNote: The backup cell stock can be resuscitated as starting cell library.\nHarvest one plate of cell libraries and save it as the starting library sample (R0). Proceed to the toxin screen with the other two plates.\nTcdB4 screen on HeLa-Cas9 cell library\nTiming: 5–6 weeks\nIn this part, we selected the genome-wide CRISPR cell library with TcdB4 for three rounds. Each round takes about 2–3 weeks. A timeline of the screening procedure is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1862-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Timeline of the TcdB4 screening procedure\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nThaw TcdB4 stock on ice. Dilute TcdB4 in 40 mL of DMEM complete to a final concentration of 0.045 pM.\nReplace the culture medium of the HeLa-Cas9 cell library with DMEM complete containing 0.045 pM TcdB4.\nAfter 14 h, remove the supernatant and gently wash the cells 6 times with PBS to remove loosely attached round-shaped cells.\nTrypsin-digest the rest cells and seed all cells back to the original plate. Add 20 mL of fresh DMEM complete to each dish and place the plates back in the incubator.\nNote: There’s no need to transfer the cells to a new dish.\nAfter 6 h, wash the plate again with PBS to remove the unattached cells, Add 20 mL of fresh DMEM complete to each plate.",
    "Use microscopy to check the condition of the cells until large cell colonies form (∼300 cells/colony). Change the medium with fresh DMEM complete if the spent turns yellow.\nNote: This step takes 2–3 weeks for the first round of screen and 1–2 weeks for the second/third round of screen.\nTrypsin digest and combine all cells. Seed the cells into three new 10-cm dishes and allow them to grow to 70% confluent.\nHarvest one plate of cell libraries and save it as the cell library sample for the first round of screen (R1). Proceed to the next round of screens with the other two plates.\nRepeat steps 15–20 with 0.15 and 0.45 pM TcdB4 for the second and third rounds of the TcdB4 screen (R2 and R3). Collect the cell library samples with clear labels after each round of screen.\nPCR amplification of DNA sequences encoding small guide RNA (gRNA)\nTiming: 3 days\nBelow we provided a detailed step-by-step protocol for obtaining the pooled gDNA fragments from the collected cell library samples.\nExtract the genomic DNA from the cell libraries R0, R1, R2, and R3 using QIAGEN Blood & Cell Culture DNA Kit following the manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/blood-and-cell-culture-dna-kits[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/blood-and-cell-culture-dna-kits]).\nA HeLa cell contains about 6 pg of genomic DNA. Each HeLa cell in the cell library is expected to harbor only one gRNA encoding gene. To ensure 20-fold coverage of the gRNA library (GeCKO v2 library contains over 100,000 gRNAs), 12 μg of genomic DNA is needed for the PCR amplification (6 pg of genomic DNA per cell X 100,000 gRNAs X 20-fold coverage).\nNote: R1, R2, and R3 are expected to contain much fewer numbers of gRNAs, a lower amount of genomic DNA may be used as the template for PCR recovering gRNAs encoding sequences from these samples.",
    "For PCR amplification of DNA sequences encoding gRNAs, set up PCR reactions like the following:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1862_1.csv\nRun PCR reaction using the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1862_2.csv\nAgarose gel electrophoresis. Prepare a 2% agarose gel. Load 200 μL of PCR product for gRNA and run the gel.\nAgarose gel extraction. Visualize the gel under Transilluminator (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Cut the ∼200 bp band and purify DNA using an agarose gel extraction kit.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1862-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. PCR amplicons of the pooled gDNA\nThe PCR amplicons of the pooled gDNA are separated on a 2% agarose gel.\nQuantify DNA and send for next-generation sequencing. 100 μg DNA yield is sufficient to perform the next-generation sequencing (NGS).\nNGS and data processing\nTiming: 1 week\nIn this step, we perform NGS on Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform, align raw data to human GeCKO v2 library reference, use Cutadapt (Martin, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) to trim down raw sequencing reads and get the count number of each gRNA.\nLibrary construction: 1 μg DNA per sample was used as input material for the preparation of libraries for NGS on the Illumina platform. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEB Next® UltraTM DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations (https://international.neb.com/protocols/2014/05/22/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-ultra-dna-library-prep-kit-for-illumina-e7370[href=https://international.neb.com/protocols/2014/05/22/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-ultra-dna-library-prep-kit-for-illumina-e7370]). At this step, index codes were added to attribute sequences.\nSequencing: NGS is performed using an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform at Novogene Bioinformatics Technology (China, https://en.novogene.com/[href=https://en.novogene.com/]). Sequencing cycles for read1/i7 index/i5 index/read2 are 150/8/8/150 respectively. 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Around 2,000,000 reads for each sample (∼0.5 GB NGS data) were collected.\nNGS data processing.\nGo to https://github.com/liuqinghe-007/Sequencing_results_analysis_of_CRISPR-cas9_screen.git[href=https://github.com/liuqinghe-007/Sequencing_results_analysis_of_CRISPR-cas9_screen.git].\nTo align and count gRNAs in raw sequencing files, two perl scripts total_numbers_from_fq_file.pl and combine_a_b.pl, were written. Reference sequence files for human GeCKO v2 library (human_GeCKO v2_library_a.csv and human_GeCKO v2_library_b.csv) were downloaded from Addgene (https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/zhang-human-gecko-v2[href=https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/zhang-human-gecko-v2]).",
    "Forward sequencing primer: 5′-AATGGACTATCATATGCTTACCGTAACTTGAAAGTATTTCGATTTCTTGGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCG-3′. Reverse sequencing primer: 5′- GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGCTAGTCCGTTATCAACTTGAAAAAGTGGCACCGAGTCGGTGCTTTTTTA-3′\nRaw sequencing reads are trimmed down to the 20-nucleotide gRNA sequence by Cutadapt version 4.0 (https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt.git[href=https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt.git]) and two files containing trimmed sequences are generated as trimmed_raw_reads.fq.gz.\nTo obtain the count number for each gRNA, the script total_numbers_from_fq_file.pl is used to align trimmed sequences in trimmed_raw_reads.fq.gz to reference sequences in human_GeCKO v2_library_a.csv and human_GeCKO v2_library_b.csv files. This will produce two files including a_library_count.txt and b_library_count.txt. To launch the script, use the following bash command on the terminal:\n>perl total_numbers_from_fq_file.pl trimmed_raw_reads1.fq.gz trimmed_raw_reads2.fq.gz STEP1_OUTPUTDIR\nUse the script combine_a_b.pl to combine counts from A- and B- half-libraries via typing the command:\n>perl combine_a_b.pl -i1 STEP1_OUTPUTDIR -o1 STEP2_OUTPUTDIR\nThe number of unique gRNAs and NGS reads for each gene are plotted in a chart.\nNote: Quality control of the initial CRISPR knockout cell library (R0) is very important. In a high-quality cell library, the gRNA/gene coverage should be as high as possible, while the number of NGS reads per gRNA need to be even. An example of gRNA/gene coverage in R0 is shown here (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1862-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Quality control of the initial CRISPR knockout cell library\n(A) The number of unique gRNAs and the number of NGS reads for each gene in R0 are plotted in a chart.\n(B) The number of gRNAs/genes in R0 versus the number of total gRNAs/genes, as shown by breakdowns.\n(C) The number of identified genes in R0 versus the number of total targeted genes in the GeCKO v2 library."
