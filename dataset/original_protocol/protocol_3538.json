    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of A. fumigatus conidia and macrophage cell line (RAW264.7)\nFor the isolation of phagolysosomes from macrophages seeding of a defined amount of macrophages in well plates and cultivation of A. fumigatus conidia until sporulation is necessary and described below.\nTiming: 10 min\nRevival of A. fumigatus conidia from cryopreservation\nUse an inoculation loop to spread conidia on a petri dish with Aspergillus Minimal Medium agar (Pontecorvo et al., 1953[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])\nIncubate conidia-plated agar plate for 5 days at 37°C\nTiming: 30 min plus 3 days\nSeed macrophage cell line\nPreheat cell culture medium (see “Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”), which should be stored at 4°C, to 37°C in a water bath\nPrepare 2 × 25 cm2 cell culture flasks with 3 × 105 macrophages (revived from cryopreserved cell line) and 7 mL culture medium each\nIncubate flasks for 3 days at 37°C and 5% (v/v) CO2\nTiming: 1 h plus 1 day\nHarvest conidia 5 days after mycelial growth and sporulation on agar plates\nSlowly add 10 mL 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 solution to the petri dish\nUse a T-formed spatula to scrap the conidia\nMeasure concentration of conidia by using a 1:100 dilution and counting with a Thoma chamber or another counting method\nHarvest adherent macrophages with a confluency of 80%–90%\nPre-warm culture medium to 37°C in water bath\nRemove the old medium from macrophages’ culture flask by aspiration\nAdd 3 mL of fresh pre-warmed medium\nUse a cell scraper to scrape the macrophages from the base of the culture flask\nCollect cell suspension in a 15 mL Falcon tube\nMeasure cell concentration by Thoma chamber or another counting system\nSeed cells for infection with A. fumigatus conidia",
    "Add 5 mL medium + 4 × 106 macrophages to each well of a 4-well plate (21,8 cm2/well)\nIncubate cells 24 h at 37°C and 5% (v/v) CO2\nInfection of macrophages with A. fumigatus conidia\nMacrophages are incubated with a defined amount of conidia to allow phagocytosis and formation of a conidia-containing phagolysosome. The implementation of infection is explained in the following.\nTiming: 3 h\nReplace culture medium of the 4-well plate containing macrophages\nRemove the old medium\nAdd 3 mL pre-warmed fresh medium to the cells\nPhagocytosis of A. fumigatus conidia by macrophages\nInfect macrophages using an MOI of 5; incubate for 30 min at 4°C to synchronize phagocytosis\nAllow phagocytosis for 2 h at 37°C and 5% (v/v) CO2\nIsolation of conidia-containing phagolysosomes\nFormed phagolysosomes are isolated by the described cell lysis and Biocoll-separating process.\nTiming: 3 h\nIsolation of infected cells from plate\nPre-cool a tabletop centrifuge to 4°C\nRemove old medium of the 4 wells of the infected macrophages by aspiration\nWash cells by adding 3 mL PBS per well and remove PBS\nHarvest cells with cell scraper in 1.5 mL PBS per well\nFrom each well, transfer cell suspension to a separate 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nHomogenization of cells\nDiscard supernatant\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors\nLyse cells on ice by passing the cell suspensions 20 times per pellet through a 26G needle on a 1 mL syringe\nCritical: Slowly pass the cell suspension through a needle to avoid air bubbles in the tube. Passing times should not fall below 20 times to improve cell lysis.\nCheck cell breakage\nAdd 5 μL trypan blue to 5 μL cell suspension",
    "Microscopic observation shows blue staining, which indicates disrupted cell membranes\nRelease of actin/myosin interaction\nIncubate each cell homogenate with 300 μL of 10 mM ATP for 15 min with rotation at 4°C\nSeparation of phagolysosomes from cell debris\nSplit the 1 mL homogenate into portions of 500 μL; carefully overlay each 500 μL on top of 500 μL Biocoll (1.077 g/mL) in a reaction tube by using a 200 μL tip\nCritical: A small pipette tip avoids too fast layering of the homogenate onto Biocoll and improves separating process.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 20 min at 4°C\nDiscard supernatant\nWash pelleted conidia-containing phagolysosomes twice with ice-cold 500 μL PBS with centrifugation in-between for 5 min, 600 × g, at 4°C\nResuspend pellet in 150 μL ice-cold PBS and collect all samples in one tube\nSeed 20 μL suspension + 1 mL PBS or count phagolysosomes and place a certain amount on a coverslip in a 24-well plate and store at 4°C (possible for max. 1 day) to allow the phagolysosomes to attach onto the coverslip. Alternatively, isolated phagolysosomes can be lysed for Western Blot analysis.\nImmunofluorescence staining of conidia-containing phagolysosomes\nTiming: 6 h\nMembrane-associated targets of isolated phagolysosomes can be stained with specific antibodies using immunofluorescence technology as described below.\nFixation of phagolysosomes\nSlowly remove PBS from each well\nAdd 350 μL methanol/acetone (80%/20% (v/v)) or 3.5% (v/v) formaldehyde/PBS or 4% PFA for 15 min RT (depending on the target)\nWash three times with 350 μL PBS\nBlocking and staining\nRemove PBS\nAdd 350 μL 2% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 1 h\nRemove blocking solution\nAdd 300 μL primary antibody diluted in blocking solutions as recommended for 1.5 h\nWash three times with PBS for 30 s\nRemove PBS",
    "Add 300 μL secondary antibody diluted in blocking solutions as recommended for 1 h\nWash three times with PBS for 30 s\nMount coverslips on a glass slide with mounting medium"
