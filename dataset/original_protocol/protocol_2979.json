    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGeneral guidelines for preparing target RNA\nTiming: 2−36 h\nThe procedure below describes preparation of 5′-end labeled target RNA in two steps: (1) dephosphorylation of 5′ phosphorylated synthetic RNA oligonucleotides followed by (2) 5′-end labeling with radioactive ATP ([γ-32P]ATP) using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2729-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Step-by-step procedure to visualize and excise in-gel radiolabeled target by phosphorimaging\nNote: To achieve high sensitivity, we radioactively 5′-end label the target RNA. A typical double filter-binding assay or RBNS experiment requires ∼30 fmol and ∼20 pmol of target RNA, respectively. To ensure a high concentration of target RNA, we radioactively label a small amount (e.g., 100 pmol) of target RNA and mix it with cold target RNA to reach the amount required in an assay. If the experimentalist purchases target RNA both with 5′ phosphate and without, proceed directly with 5′-end labeling (step 2). For best results, do not use a radioactive batch of [γ-32P]ATP that is more than 3 weeks old.\nCritical: DEPC-treated water should not be used, because it can be acidic and may cause depurination. Unreacted DEPC or by-products from autoclaving can also inhibit enzymes.\nDephosphorylate 5′ phosphorylated synthetic RNA oligonucleotides.\nSet up the reaction by mixing:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2729_14.csv\nNote: The table shows the volumes to dephosphorylate 100 pmol RNA. Linearly scale-up accordingly to amount needed.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nInactivate the Antarctic Phosphatase by adding 50 mM EDTA (f.c.) and heating at 80°C for 2 min. Cool at room temperature (20°C−25°C) for 1 min.\nAdd RNase-free water to adjust sample volume to 300 μL.\nPrecipitate the RNA by adding 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and three volumes of ethanol.\nIncubate the solution 2 h at −80°C or overnight (12–18 h) at −20°C.",
    "Spin at the maximum speed (typically 21,000 × g) for 30 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge.\nCarefully remove nearly all supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold 75% ethanol to RNA. Mix well by vigorous vortexing.\nSpin at the maximum speed for 15 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge.\nCarefully remove nearly all supernatant.\nRepeat steps 1i–k.\nSpin at the maximum speed for 15 s at 4°C in a microcentrifuge to collect the residual ethanol on the wall of the tube and discard the liquid using an extended pipette tip.\nAir-dry the pellet for 5−20 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 μL nuclease-free water.\nSet up a 5′-end labeling reaction.\nTo dephosphorylated RNA oligonucleotide (from step 1o), add:\n20 μL nuclease-free water,\n4 μL 10× PNK Reaction Buffer,\n2 μL 10 U·μL−1 T4 PNK,\n4 μL [γ-32P]ATP (25 pmol·μL−1).\nCritical: The protocol involves the use of radiolabeled nucleotides; follow institutional guidelines for working with radionuclides.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nNote: To ensure that all target RNA molecules are 5′-phosphorylated, follow the radiolabeling with a second phosphorylation reaction containing 2 mM non-radioactive ATP. To the radiolabeling reaction, add:\n7 μL nuclease-free water,\n1 μL 10× PNK Reaction Buffer,\n1 μL 100 mM ATP,\n1 μL 10 U·μL−1 T4 PNK.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nRemove unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP with a Sephadex G-25 spin column according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://d3.cytivalifesciences.com/prod/IFU/27532501AD.pdf]. Save the empty tube of labeling reaction for preparation of radioactive markers (optional step below).\nOptional: we highly recommend gel purifying target RNAs to remove traces of unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP and degraded RNA.\nResolve 28-nt target RNA and RNA for RBNS on 10% and 8% polyacrylamide urea gels, respectively. For more details on how to prepare, load, and run polyacrylamide gels for RNA analysis, we refer the experimentalist to existing protocols.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]",
    "Visualize the radiolabeled target by phosphorimaging:\nRemove one glass plate and cover the gel with plastic wrap.\nPrepare radioactive markers: cut three small triangular shapes out of filter paper (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPlace radioactive markers on top of the gel.\nAdd ∼300 μL of Loading Buffer to the empty tube of labeling reaction saved in step 3.\nAdd this radioactive solution dropwise to the triangular shapes; it should be evenly distributed on the triangular pieces of the filter paper.\nCover the gel and the radioactive markers with plastic wrap.\nExpose the gel to a storage phosphor imaging screen for ∼15−30 s and print an image at actual size.\nIdentify the location of the radiolabeled RNA on the gel, using the radioactive markers on the gel to line up the gel with the marks on the printed image.\nExcise the pieces of the gel containing the RNA with a clean razor blade.\nRecover RNA from the gel by the Crush and Soak method.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] We typically elute RNA in 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.2) and 1% (w/v) SDS.\nPurify RNA by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation.\nIf the optional step above has been performed, pass eluate through a small 0.45-μm filter into a new tube. Alternatively, load the eluate on a Spin-X filter, centrifuge at 700 × g for 10 min at room temperature (20°C−25°C); collect the flow-through.\nAdd an equal volume of phenol:chloroform 5:1 (pH 4.5) to aqueous RNA solution.\nCritical: Phenol and chloroform are toxic upon inhalation. Always handle in a chemical fume hood. Avoid contact with eyes and skin. Strictly follow institutional guidelines for waste disposal.\nMix well by vigorous vortexing, and spin at the maximum speed for 15 min at room temperature (20°C−25°C) in a microcentrifuge.",
    "Transfer the aqueous (top) phase to a new 2-mL tube.\nNote: Avoid transferring any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette when removing the aqueous phase. Angle the tube at 45°C to facilitate the process.\nAdd an equal volume of chloroform and mix well by vigorous vortexing.\nSpin at the maximum speed for 15 min at room temperature (20°C−25°C) in a microcentrifuge.\nTransfer the aqueous (top) phase to a new 2-mL tube.\nFollow instructions from steps 1d−n to recover RNA by ethanol precipitation.\nNote: If RNA was gel-purified and eluted in in 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.2) and 1% (w/v) SDS in step 3e, there is no need to add 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (step 1e).\nResuspend the RNA pellet in 40 μL of nuclease-free water.\nMeasure absorbance at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer.\nDetermine RNA concentration of RNA using the Beer-Lambert law:\nA\n=\nε\n×\nl\n×\nc\nwhere   A   is absorbance at 260 nm,   l   is the optical path length in cm,   ε   is the molar extinction coefficient of RNA oligonucleotide in L·mol−1·cm−1, and   c   is RNA concentration in M.\nCritical: For accurate quantification, absorbance values must be between 0.1 and 0.8. Solutions of higher and lower concentrations have higher relative error in the measurement. If absorbance is < 0.1, add cold RNA to obtain an absorbance measurement comprised between 0.1 and 0.8. If too much cold RNA has been added and measured absorbance is > 0.8, take an aliquot of RNA solution and measure absorbance of a diluted sample.\nAliquot target RNA and store at −20°C up to 6 months (or until the specific radioactivity becomes low) by strictly following institutional guidelines for storage of radioactive material.\nGeneral guidelines for handling Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus\nTiming: 2−22.5 h",
    "Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus is simple to operate and enables rapid separation of protein-bound RNA from unbound RNA. We describe below the handling of Bio-Dot apparatus that we use in double filter-binding assays and RBNS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2729-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental setup for double filter-binding assays using the Bio-Dot Microfiltration apparatus\nNote: Additional information about the apparatus can be found in the manufacturer’s manual[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/sites/default/files/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/M1706545.pdf].\nCleaning.\nSoak the sample template of Bio-Dot apparatus in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide overnight (12–18 h) at room temperature (20°C−25°C) or for 1 h at 65°C to eliminate RNA and protein molecules remaining from previous assays.\nWash thoroughly with RNase-free water.\nWash the apparatus with a surfactant; we typically soak the apparatus in 7X-O-Matic Cleaning Solution for 15 min.\nWash thoroughly with water and rinse with nuclease-free water.\nAir-dry the apparatus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2729-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Step-by-step procedure to assemble the Bio-Dot Microfiltration apparatus for double filter-binding assays\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2729-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Separating protein-bound from unbound RNA\n(A) Illustration of fully assembled Bio-Dot Microfiltration apparatus used to apply samples followed by a rapid wash.\n(B) Settings for the 3-way flow valve for assembling the Bio-Dot Microfiltration apparatus, loading the samples, and washing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2729-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Step-by-step procedure to disassemble the Bio-Dot Microfiltration apparatus\nAssembly.\nCut each of the required membranes to fit the Bio-Dot apparatus.\nCritical: Both nylon and nitrocellulose membranes should be the same size and should not extend beyond the edge of the gasket. Membranes of a larger size may obstruct vacuum formation after the Bio-Dot apparatus has been assembled. Trim the membranes if needed.",
    "Note: To reduce retention of free single-stranded RNA, pre-condition nitrocellulose membranes prior to use by soaking in 0.4 M potassium hydroxide for 10 min and washing thoroughly with nuclease-free water.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] Pre-condition nylon membranes by incubating in 0.1 M EDTA (pH 8.2) for 10 min, washing three times in 1 M sodium chloride for 10 min, rapidly rinsing (∼15 s) in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide, and washing thoroughly with nuclease-free water.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] We highly recommend pre-conditioning both nitrocellulose and nylon membranes in RBNS assays.\nEquilibrate the nitrocellulose and nylon membranes by soaking them in Wash Buffer for at least 1 h. Always wear gloves and use forceps when handing membranes.\nNote: We assess binding of mammalian RISC by performing binding reactions at 37°C. To ensure constant temperature throughout the procedure, all incubations, assembly of Bio-Dot apparatus and filtering steps are performed in a 37°C constant-temperature room, using supplies that had been pre-equilibrated to 37°C.\nDeposit the gasket support plate into the vacuum manifold (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nPull down the sealing gasket on top of the vacuum manifold.\nAlign the 96 holes in the gasket over the 96 holes in the support plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRemove the nylon membrane from the Wash Buffer and shake it out gently for a few seconds to remove the excess of liquid.\nCritical: dehydrated membranes may cause protein denaturation upon binding and may restrain proper drainage of solutions upon filtering. Therefore, remove the membrane from the wetting solution right before (≤ 5 min) filtering.\nLay the nylon membrane on top of the sealing gasket (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRemove the nitrocellulose membrane from the Wash Buffer and shake it out gently for a few seconds to remove the excess of liquid.\nLay the nitrocellulose membrane on top of the nylon membrane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Note: In RBNS experiments, the nitrocellulose membrane is cut into pieces to enable extracting protein-bound RNA from each binding reaction independently. Use a pencil to draw markers around wells where samples will be applied (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Do not accidentally drill the membrane: small holes in the membrane may impair proper vacuum formation in downstream steps.\nCarefully roll out any air bubbles confined between the membranes and the gasket with forceps.\nPlace the sample template on top of the membrane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nFinger-tighten the four screws. Use a diagonal crossing pattern to apply uniform pressure on the membrane surface.\nCritical: if some wells are not used, they must be closed off to ensure proper vacuum to the wells in use. We cover the unused portion of the apparatus with clear packing tape to prevent air from moving through those wells (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nSwitch the vacuum source on and adjust air aspiration to gentle flow.\nNote: We are using an in-house vacuum line; alternatively, an electronic laboratory vacuum pump can be used.\nAdjust the flow valve so that the manifold is exposed to air only (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B; the flow valve in position 2).\nConnect the apparatus to the vacuum source.\nPlace a multi-channel pipet (10−100 μL) and ice-cold Wash Buffer near the Bio-Dot apparatus (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nWhen ready for sample application, remove the excess of liquid from membranes by applying gentle vacuum to the manifold (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B; the flow valve in position 3).\nNote: Loose tightening of the apparatus results in leaking between wells and cross contamination with samples. If needed, adjust screw tightening using the diagonal crossing pattern while gentle vacuum is on.",
    "Critical: perform the above step rapidly so that not to dehydrate the membranes. Watch the sample wells. If membranes have dried, rehydrate the wells with some Wash Buffer (∼100 μL) and remove the excess of liquid by applying gentle vacuum to the manifold (the flow valve in position 3).\nWatch the sample wells. As soon as the buffer solution drains from all the wells, set up the flow valve so that the manifold is exposed to air (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B; the flow valve in position 2). Imminently proceed to the next step.\nLoading samples.\nRapidly load the samples into the wells with a multi-channel pipet.\nNote: If binding reactions are performed in a small volume < 50 μL, apply the sample in the center of the well (and not on the well walls). Ensure that there are no air bubbles in the wells, as they will prevent the sample from binding to the membrane. Air bubbles may be removed by pipetting the liquid in the well up and down.\nCritical: RBNS is a highly sensitive assay; therefore, skip a well between samples to prevent cross-contamination.\nSet up the flow valve so that the manifold is exposed to the vacuum (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B; the flow valve in position 1).\nWatch the sample wells. After the samples drain from all the wells, leave the flow valve in position 1 and rapidly add 10−100 μL of ice-cold Wash Buffer into the wells.\nWatch the sample wells. When the Wash Buffer drains from all the wells and the membranes are dehydrated, the manifold is ready for disassembly.\nDisassembly.\nPlace a sheet of filter paper near the Bio-Dot apparatus.\nWhile the manifold is exposed to the vacuum (the flow valve in position 1), finger-loosen the four screws using a diagonal crossing pattern.",
    "Lift the sample template and turn the vacuum off by setting up the flow valve to position 2.\nGrip both nitrocellulose and nylon membranes together by a corner with forceps and pull them horizontally towards to the filter paper (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). The RNA side should face up.\nCarefully separate the membranes by lifting the nitrocellulose membrane and placing it RNA face up on the filter paper (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nNote: The filter paper drains excess of Wash Buffer from the membranes.\nCarefully transfer the membranes to a new piece of filter paper (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nCritical: Air-dry the membranes (∼30 min). If wet membranes are used in the next step, the sample dots may expand by diffusion yielding halos around the samples and an eventual cross-contamination.\nPlace a plastic wrap over the membranes.\nExpose the membranes to a storage phosphor imaging screen for 10 s to 15 min and for 2−16 h in RBNS and double filter-binding assays, respectively.\nNote: The signals must be distinguishable over the background, but not saturated.\nMeasuring the fraction of active RISC by titration\nTiming: 5−6 days\nWe describe below a titration experiment to quantify the concentration of binding-competent protein, which is a key step for determining the protein concentrations to use in double filter-binding and RBNS reactions.",
    "Note: The amount of bound ligand in double filter-binding assays and RBNS experiments is determined not by the total protein concentration but by the concentration of total active protein. Different protein preparations can have different percent activities for the same amount of protein due to misfolding, aggregation, degradation, and potentially inactivation upon purification. We estimate total RISC concentration by northern blot and measure the equilibrium binding of active RISC with a high-affinity RNA target. Concentration of RNA target is chosen to be much greater than its known KD, and RISC concentration is varied by an order of magnitude above and below the target concentration. Fitting the titration data to a quadratic equation enables measuring the amount of active RISC.\nDesign a target RNA with a sequence complementary to a high-affinity binding site; we use a target RNA with an 8mer binding site (a target RNA with Watson-Crick pairing to miRNA nucleotides at positions 2−8 and an adenosine opposite miRNA nucleotide at position 1).\nAdd flanking regions (≥ 3-nt in length) to each end of the RNA target.\nUse RNAfold[href=http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi]15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] to ensure that addition of flanking regions does not cause formation of stable secondary structures.\nNote: RNA targets with AU-rich flanking regions are typically less structured than RNA targets with GC-rich flanking regions. E.g., a 28-nt target RNA with a miR-449a 8mer binding site, a 3-nt 5′ flanking region, and a 17-nt 3′ flanking region: 5′-AUG AAA UCG AUA UCU AUC ACU GCC AAC U (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nPurchase the RNA with normal desalting.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2729-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Overview of RISC binding and RBNS\n(A) Canonical 8mer site: contiguous pairing to the miRNA nucleotides 2–8, and an A opposite miRNA nucleotide 1.",
    "(B) RBNS consists in incubating RISC with a large pool of distinct RNA molecules. After reaching binding equilibrium, the reaction is applied to nitrocellulose and nylon membranes to separate RISC-bound RNA molecules from unbound RNA. Molecules retained on the nitrocellulose filter are used for Illumina library preparation and are sequenced. Analysis of sequencing reads identifies binding motifs and estimates KD values.\nRadiolabel the RNA target (steps 1−4).\nDilute the target RNA in Dilution Buffer to 2.5 nM.\nDilute RISC in Storage Buffer to 0.015, 0.03, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 nM.\nSet up 5-μL binding reactions by mixing 4 μL diluted RISC and 1 μL of 2.5 nM target RNA. Include a no-RISC binding reaction (4 μL Storage Buffer mixed with 1 μL of 2.5 nM target RNA).\nNote: Final concentration of target RNA in the binding reactions is 1 μL × 2.5 nM / 5 μL = 0.5 nM. Final concentrations of RISC are 4 μL / 5 μL ×(0.015, 0.03, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4) nM.\nIncubate the binding reactions at 37°C for 1 h.\nSeparate RISC-bound RNA from unbound RNA by using Bio-Dot apparatus (steps 6−8). Upon binding (step 7a), apply 4.5 μL of each reaction to the membranes. Wash with 10 μL ice-cold Wash Buffer (step 7c).\nExpose the membranes to a storage phosphor imaging screen for 2−16 h (step 8h).\nMeasure the fraction of active RISC (Quantification and statistical analysis: step 1).\nMeasuring binding affinity by double filter-binding assays\nTiming: 5−6 days\nWe describe below the specific steps for performing double-filter binding assays to measure the binding affinity of a target RNA of interest.",
    "Note: To measure KD, we vary protein concentration, while keeping the concentration of target RNA constant. Importantly, the “titration” regime—in which the concentration of a binding site is much greater than KD—must be avoided (reviewed in ref.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). KD can be determined under experimental conditions, in which the concentration of target RNA should be well below or of the same order of magnitude as its KD. The latter regime requires fitting the binding data to an appropriate binding equation that explicitly accounts for bound protein and does not rely on the common assumption that [Protein]free ∼ [Protein]total.\nDesign a target RNA with a sequence complementary to the binding site of interest.\nNote: Mammalian AGO2 cleaves extensively complementary RNA targets at the phosphodiester bond opposite guide positions 10 and 11. To block cleavage, target RNAs extensively complementary to miRNA guides are designed with a phosphorothioate linkage flanked by 2′-O-methyl ribose at positions opposite to miRNA nucleotides 10 and 11 (ref.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nAdd flanking regions (≥ 3-nt in length) to each end of the RNA target.\nUse RNAfold[href=http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi]15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] to make sure that addition of flanking regions does not cause formation of stable secondary structures.\nPurchase the RNA with normal desalting.\nRadiolabel the RNA target (steps 1−4).\nSet up the binding reactions in 5 μL as described in steps 14−16.\nCritical: Include a no-RISC binding reaction.\nNote: To measure KD of medium or low affinity binding sites, we use 100 pM (f.c.) radiolabeled target RNA and vary RISC concentration between 1 pM and 400 pM (f.c.).\nIncubate the binding reactions at 37°C for 1 h.\nCritical: Be sure to provide sufficient time for equilibration.\nNote: For the binding equilibrium where RISC interacts with an RNA sitei, the equilibration rate constant is described by\nk\ne\nq\n=\nk\no\nn\n×\n[\nR\nI\nS",
    "C\n]\n×\n[\ns\ni\nt\ne\ni\n]\n+\nk\no\nf\nf\n.\nEstimate the equilibration rate constant for the protein and the target RNA of interest. E.g., for the let-7a 6mer-A1 binding site (a target RNA with Watson-Crick pairing to miRNA nucleotides at positions 2−6 and an adenosine opposite miRNA nucleotide at position 1),    k  o n     = 2.0 ± 0.1 × 108 M−1·s−1 and    k  o f f     = 0.24 ± 0.001 s−1 (ref.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). For the let-7a non-canonical 11mer-m11.21 site (a target RNA with Watson-Crick pairing to miRNA nucleotides at positions 11−21),    k  o n     = 3.6 ± 0.1 × 107 M−1·s−1 and    k  o f f     = 0.79 ± 0.08 s−1 (ref.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). At target RNA concentration of 100 pM, the binding reaction with the lowest RISC concentration (1 pM) should reach equilibrium in 4 ± 1 s and 1.2 ± 0.2 s for 6mer-A1 and 11mer-m11.21, respectively.\nSeparate RISC-bound RNA from unbound RNA by using Bio-Dot apparatus (steps 6−8). Upon binding (step 7a), apply 4.5 μL of each reaction to the membranes. Wash with 10 μL ice-cold Wash Buffer (step 7c).\nExpose the membranes to a storage phosphor imaging screen for 2−16 h (step 8h).\nMeasure the binding affinity (Quantification and statistical analysis: step 2).\nMeasuring binding affinity by RNA bind-n-Seq (RBNS)\nTiming: 17−21 days\nWe describe below the specific steps for performing double-filter binding assays to measure the binding affinities of many binding sites simultaneously using the high-throughput sequencing method RBNS.",
    "Note: As in double filter-binding assays, the RNA pool concentration is the same for all binding reactions, while the protein concentration varies. As discussed in ref.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] protein and RNA pool concentrations should be carefully chosen to avoid the “titration” regime. In a typical RBNS experiment, the random sequence RNA region is flanked by constant primer-binding regions used for sequencing. This design simplifies library preparation, avoids biases that can result from RNA ligation, and ensures that any RNA carried over from protein purification will not contaminate the sequenced library. The length of the random sequence region of RNA ligands is an important aspect of RBNS design and has been discussed previously.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] We randomized 20 nucleotides, obtaining an RNA pool of 420 = 1.1 × 1012 distinct RNA sequences. Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B illustrates the method. In addition to simultaneously determining absolute KD values of various binding sites, our computational procedure estimates the concentration of active RISC1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; therefore, measuring the fraction of active RISC by titration is not strictly required.\nPurchase RNA targets (100 nmol) for RBNS as a pool of RNA oligonucleotides, 5′-phosphorylated GAG UUC UAC AGU CCG ACG AUC NNN NNN NNN NNN NNN NNN NNU GGA AUU CUC GGG UGC CAA, synthesized with equal ratio of bases (25:25:25:25) selecting the hand-mixed option for randomizing bases and PAGE purification.\nNote: Alternatively, RNA oligonucleotides can be purchased with normal desalting and purified on 8% polyacrylamide urea gels.",
    "Note: Constant primer-binding sequences may bias the RBNS assay if they contain a motif for protein binding.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Constant regions cannot be readily modified to avoid biases, as they must remain compatible with Illumina sequencing. Inspired by,21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] we use cDNA oligonucleotides to block the common sequences present in each RNA molecule, leaving only the randomized sequence and four 5′ and 3′ flanking nucleotides accessible for RISC binding. Moreover, making these regions double-stranded disfavors intramolecular secondary structures.\nPurchase cDNA oligonucleotides (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) with normal desalting: 5′-end and 3′-end blocking cDNA oligonucleotides, reverse transcription (RT) primer, PCR Forward primer, and Multiplexing PCR Reverse primer.\nRadiolabel RNA input pool (steps 1−4).\nAnneal cDNA blocking oligonucleotides to RNA input pool.\nMix the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2729_15.csv\nNote: The table shows the volumes to perform ten binding reactions. Linearly scale-up accordingly to the number of samples.\nIncubate the reaction mix 1 min at 95°C, 10 min at 65°C and 10 min at room temperature (20°C−25°C).\nSet up binding reactions.\nNote: Each experiment typically includes five binding reactions. The highest concentration of RISC used corresponds to 40% (v/v) of the stock solution and equals 0.8–5 nM (f.c.) active protein. For additional reactions, we dilute the stock serially 3.2-fold in Storage Buffer. Each experiment also includes a no-RISC control containing protein Storage Buffer only.\nPrepare the reaction mix by adding to the RNA input pool from the previous step:\n2.1 μL 0.2 M magnesium acetate,\n1 μL 2 mg·mL−1 tRNA,\n5 μL 40 U·μL−1 RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor,\n1.2 μL 1% (w/v) CHAPS,\n1 μL 10 μg·μL−1 ultrapure BSA.\nNote: This amount of reaction mix is sufficient to perform 10 binding reactions. Linearly scale-up accordingly to the number of samples.",
    "Critical: Even small amounts of RNA non-specifically retained on the nitrocellulose filter may dilute protein-bound RNA and reduce the sensitivity of RBNS. Therefore, tRNA and BSA are included to minimize non-specific binding. Although they do not interact with RISC or target RNA, BSA does interact with the nitrocellulose filter and can reduce its binding capacity.\nPipet reaction mix into six 200-μL sterile PCR tubes on ice, 12 μL per tube.\nDilute RISC in ice-cold Storage Buffer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2729_16.csv\nAdd 8 μL diluted RISC to PCR tubes containing 12 μL reaction mix to generate a 20-μL reaction. For the no-RISC control reaction, add 8 μL Storage Buffer to 12 μL reaction mix.\nNote: The final concentration of the RNA input pool is 100 nM; the concentrations of individual binding sites in the pool should be measured by high-throughput sequencing.\nIncubate reactions for 2 h at 37°C.\nSeparate RISC-bound RNA from unbound RNA by using Bio-Dot apparatus (steps 6−8). Upon binding (step 7a), apply 19.5 μL of each reaction to the membranes. Wash with 100 μL ice-cold Wash Buffer (step 7c).\nExpose the membranes to a storage phosphor imaging screen for 10 s to 15 min (step 8h).\nMeasure the fraction bound (Quantification and statistical analysis: steps 1a–b).\nNote: Imaging both nitrocellulose and nylon membranes at this step enables estimating the fraction of RNA input pool bound by RISC. Fraction bound is not used in downstream computational analyses of RBNS data. Nevertheless, we highly recommend performing this step as it helps in troubleshooting potential technical issues before proceeding with the time-consuming steps of RNA extraction, library preparation and high-throughput sequencing. Unbound RNA is not sequenced; therefore, the nylon membrane can be discarded once imaged.\nExtract RISC-bound RNA from nitrocellulose membrane.",
    "Excise sample spots from the nitrocellulose membrane with a clean razor blade by following pencil mark drawn in step 6i.\nFold each piece of membrane using forceps and put it in a new 1.7-mL tube. Do not touch the sample spots with the forceps.\nPrepare a proteinase K master mix by mixing the following components:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2729_17.csv\nNote: The table shows the volumes to perform ten reactions. Linearly scale-up accordingly to the number of samples. Because the expected amount of RNA is low, we add 1 μL 20 μg·μL−1 glycogen to each sample to maximize RNA recovery during the ethanol precipitation in step 39i.\nTo each tube, add 400 μL the proteinase K master mix.\nImmerse pieces of nitrocellulose membrane into the solution by gently pushing with a sterile pipette tip.\nTo 2 pmol of 5′-phosphorylated, radioactively labeled RNA input pool (i.e., the substrate in the binding reactions), add 400 μL of the proteinase K master mix.\nNote: RNA input pool is sequenced along with protein-bound RNA samples and is used in the downstream computation analyses to account for any sequence biases present in the random region of the substrate RNA. The RNA input pool needs to be sequenced only once; it is not necessary to perform this step for every experiment. However, the sequence composition may differ between independently synthesized pools, so each new RNA input pool must be sequenced.\nIncubate for 1 h at 45°C shaking at 300 rpm.\nPurify RNA by phenol/chloroform extraction as in steps 4b−g.\nNote: The chloroform step (steps 4e–g) is optional.\nPrecipitate the RNA by adding three volumes of ethanol.\nNote: The RNA solution contains 150 mM NaCl from the Proteinase K Buffer, so there is no need to add 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate.",

Primer sequences are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. The number of amplification cycles required to amplify the libraries should be minimized to avoid overamplification, which increases PCR artifacts. To determine the appropriate number of PCR cycles to use, the experimentalist may perform a test PCR amplification as described.22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] We generally perform 16 PCR cycles.\nSetup PCR reactions in a final volume of 25 μL by combining:\n10 μL water,\n2.5 μL 10× AccuPrime Pfx Reaction mix,\n1 μL 10 μM PCR Forward primer,\n1 μL 10 μM Multiplexing PCR Reverse Primer PCRIdx (x stands for the barcode number),\n0.5 μL 2.5 U·μL−1 AccuPrime Pfx DNA Polymerase,\n10 μL cDNA (from step 41n).\nPlace the PCR tubes in a thermocycler with the heated lid set to 105°C and perform PCR amplification using the following cycling parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2729_18.csv\nGel-purify PCR products.",

This system uses two-channel sequencing chemistry. To correctly identify DNA clusters and perform accurate base calling, all four DNA bases must be represented in every cycle. RBNS libraries show low diversity: RNA oligonucleotides of the input pool used in RBNS reactions are the same length (60 nt) and contain the same 20 nt 5′ sequence, among which five last nucleotides are sequenced. To provide the required cycle-to-cycle diversity, we add to the library pool 2−3 libraries (∼160−180 bp) originating from a different application (e.g., mouse small RNA-Seq). Ideally, these libraries should represent 10−20% of the total number of sequencing reads.",
