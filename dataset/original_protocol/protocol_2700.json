    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes the necessary steps to generate target HIV-1-infected CD4+ T-cells and effector HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells derived from PBMCs of individuals infected with HIV-1 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of the viral competition assay protocol\nPBMCs from HIV-1-infected individuals are necessary since memory HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells are required to expand enough HIV-1-specific effector CD8+ T-cells.\nTarget CD4+ T-cell generation\nTiming: 10 days\nThis step involves the activation, selection, and expansion of target PBMCs-derived CD4+ T cells. These target cells should be prepared concurrently with the section effector HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell generation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3].\nDay -1: Thaw PBMCs from HIV1-infected donors.\nNote: PBMCs from HIV-1-infected donors are necessary since the protocol requires the expansion of enough HIV-1-specific memory CD8+ T-cells enable to recognize and eliminate HIV-1-infected cells in vitro. Although a few naïve CD8+ T-cells from uninfected donors might potentially recognize some HIV-1-derived antigens, the number of cells would be too low and not enough to perform the viral competition assay.\nNote: Usually, 1 × 107 cells are cryopreserved per vial. Although cell recovery can be variable between donors, only 1 × 106 is required for the generation of target CD4+ T cells. All the remaining cells will be used for effector HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell generation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] section. The number of cells obtained from one cryovial containing 1 × 107 cells is usually enough to perform the viral competition assay, however please see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] if cell recovery is too low.\nWarm a vial containing cryopreserved PBMCs in a 37°C water-bath.\nAs soon as there is only a small piece of ice remaining, transfer 1 mL of thawed PBMCs into a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 9 mL of fresh prewarmed RF10.",
    "Note: Cryopreserved cells are usually preserved in freezing medium containing 10% DMSO to prevent the formation of ice crystals during the freezing process. However, DMSO has low toxicity to cells, therefore cells need to be washed as soon as possible after thawing. If a volume higher than 1 mL is thawed, scale up the necessary volume of RF10 to maintain a 1:10 dilution of the defrosted cells.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of fresh RF10.\nTransfer the cells into a 25 mm culture flask and incubate them 12–18 h at 37°C.\nDay 1: CD4+ T-cell activation, selection, and expansion.\nPerform cell counting and take 1 × 106 of PBMCs.\nCulture the cells in RF10 at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL in a 24 well plate.\nAdd the CD3/8 bispecific antibody to the cultured cells at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL.\nSupplement the culture with 100 IU/mL IL-2.\nAlternatives: The CD3/8 bispecific antibody can be added simultaneously with the IL-2 if they are previously premixed.\nDay 3–10: Replace the media every 48–72 h with fresh RF10 supplemented with 100 IU/mL IL-2.\nNote: After 48–72 h of cell culture, cells should have settled on the bottom of the well. Therefore, media can be replaced as follows:\nWithout disturbing cells from the bottom of the well, remove approximately 900 μL of the cell culture medium.\nAdd 900 μL of fresh, IL-2-suppplemented, RF10. Take care not to disturb the cells from the bottom of the well.\nNote: Addition of the CD3/8 bispecific antibody is not necessary when replacing the media.",
    "Note: Whether the media need to be replaced or not may be judged based on the media color. Please see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for more details.\nNote: CD3/8 bispecific antibody induces fast cell proliferation. Cells should be split into multiple wells if necessary. As shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], stimulated cells form cell clusters and may cover the bottom of the well. Please see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for more details regarding when cells should be split.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Replacement of cell culture media\n(A–C) Picture illustrating color of fresh medium after replacement (A), culture medium after 2 days of cell culture (B) and culture medium from an overgrown cell culture (C). If the color of the cell medium is similar to (C), the medium must be immediately replaced.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Split cells when convenient to avoid cell density as shown in (B).\nScale bars represent 100 μm.\nNote: PBMC treatment with CD3/8 bispecific antibody results in the elimination of CD8+ T-cells and enrichment of activated CD4+ T-cells.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nCritical: This protocol involves the manipulation of HIV-1 stocks and samples from individuals infected with HIV-1, therefore all the lab work must be undertaken in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories.\nHIV-1 infection of target CD4+ T-cells\nTiming: 3 days\nIn this step, the expanded CD4+ T-cells will be isolated and infected with HIVWT or HIVΔNef to be cocultured with effector HIV-1 specific CD8+ T-cells in viral competition assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] section. Cells will also be stained with the fluorescent dye CellTrace™ Far Red (CTFR) to identify each target population by flow cytometry.",
    "Note: Although CD3/8 bispecific antibody treatment results in CD4+ T-cell enrichment (approximately 70% CD4+ T-cells), isolation of CD4+ T-cells by magnetic bead selection is necessary to achieve >90% purity.\nDay 10: CD4+ T-cell isolation.\nAt day 10 of cell culture, pool cells from every well and count total cell number.\nNote: Cell number can be variable between donors. However, approximately 4 × 106 cells can be expected after the treatment with CD3/8 bispecific antibody. Determining the number of cells is necessary to calculate the volume of reagents to be used in the CD4+ T-cell isolation step (below).\nSpin cells down at 300 × g for 5 min.\nPerform CD4+ T-cell purification by using a CD4+ T-cell isolation kit (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) as follows:\nResuspend cell pellet in 40 μL of MACS wash buffer per 1 × 10⁷ total cells.\nNote: When working with fewer cells, use the same volumes as indicated. When working with higher cell numbers, scale up all reagent volumes and total volumes accordingly.\nAdd 10 μL of CD4+ T Cell Biotin-Antibody Cocktail (from the CD4+ T-cell isolation kit) per 1 × 10⁷ total cells.\nMix well and incubate for 5 min in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C).\nAdd 30 μL of MACS wash buffer per 1 × 10⁷ total cells.\nAdd 20 μL of CD4+ T Cell MicroBead Cocktail (from the CD4+ T-cell isolation kit) per 1 × 10⁷ total cells.\nMix well and incubate for 10 min in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C).\nA minimum of 500 μL of cell suspension is required for magnetic separation. If necessary, add MACS buffer to the cell suspension.\nSet the miniMACS separator column on the miniMACS separator (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Isolation kit set\nPhoto showing different components of the T-cell Isolation kit.",
    "Note: Always wait until the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\nPrepare column by rinsing with 500 μL of MACS wash buffer.\nApply cell suspension onto the column. Collect flow-through containing unlabeled cells in a sterile FACS tube, representing the enriched CD4+ T-cells.\nWash column with 500 μL of MACS wash buffer twice. Collect unlabeled cells that pass through, representing the enriched CD4+ T-cells, and combine with the effluent from step 4.c.x.\nPlate isolated CD4+ T-cells in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells /100 μL RF10 (supplemented with 100 IU/mL IL-2) per well.\nNote: Pure CD4+ T-cell yield is typically around 50%–90% of the number of cells counted in step 4.a.\nIncubate the cells 12–18 h at 37°C.\nDay 11: HIV-1 infection of target CD4+ T-cells.\nNote: In this step, isolated CD4+ T-cells are infected with the corresponding viral stock previously made (see preparation of viral stocks[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]). Since the viral titer of each stock and the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection between donors varies, we recommend performing a titration of each viral stock as indicated below (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). This should be performed in every experiment using cells from different donors.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Viral stock titration\n(A) Schematic of recommended plating strategy.\n(B) Representative cytometry showing gating strategy to select lymphocyte, single and viable cells.\n(C) Representative cytometry showing the proportion of Gag-p24 positive cells and selection of cells infected at similar level.\nThe titration performed in this step is also necessary to select cells infected with both viruses at a similar level. This will be important when conducting the viral competition assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4].",
    "Note: Infection of primary CD4+ T-cells with HIV-1 can be challenging. To overcome this challenge, we recommend using polybrene. Polybrene is frequently used to increase viral infection or lentiviral transduction.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nThaw the viral stocks by incubating one aliquot of each stock at 37°C in a water bath.\nNote: Defrosting the viral stocks at 37°C prevents ice crystal formation.\nAdd to the corresponding wells 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μL of each viral stock in duplicate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nOne or two wells with cells should remain uninfected as mock control (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). This control will be necessary for the cytometry analysis (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C).\nPerform viral infection by spinoculation:\nAdd 0.8 μg of polybrene (final concentration: 8 μg/mL) to each well.\nNote: Polybrene stock concentration is 8 mg/mL, therefore a dilution using RF10 can be performed prior its addition to the cell culture.\nCentrifugate the plate at 800 × g for 90 min at approximately 25°C.\nReplace the media with fresh 100 μL of RF10 supplemented with 100 IU/mL IL-2.\nIncubate cells 12–18 h at 37°C.\nNote: Since Nef (and most of the HIV-1 accessory proteins) contributes to viral replication,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] it is necessary to avoid viral spread to ensure only one round of infection occurs by adding antiretrovirals to prevent viral spread. This is important to obtain similar levels of infection between cells infected with both viruses.\nAdd antiretrovirals (ARVs) to the culture media with infected cells. Final concentration: 100 nM Efavirenz, 1 μM Enfuvirtide and 300 nM Raltegravir.\nNote: We recommend preparing a 10× cocktail with ARVs. Then add 10 μL of the ARV cocktail to each well containing HIV-1-infected cells.\nDay 13: Quantification of infection level by HIV-1 Gag-p24 intracellular staining.\nPool duplicate wells and transfer the cells to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.",
    "Take 50 μL of cells from each tube and incubate remaining cells at 37°C.\nDetermine the level of infection by staining of the HIV-1 protein Gag-p24 as follows:\nNote: Also include uninfected CD4+ T-cells to set up the flow cytometry gating strategy as shown in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C.\nNote: Every cell wash implies removing the supernatant after centrifuging each tube at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspending the cells in the designated buffer.\nWash cells with 100 μL D-PBS once and stain with 100 μL of 1:1000 Live Dead Near Infra-Red (LDNIR).\nIncubate the cells for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.\nWash cells with 100 μL D-PBS once.\nFix cells with Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (from Fixation/Permeabilization kit, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) for 15 min 4°C in the dark.\nIn the meantime, dilute the anti-Gag-p24 antibody (anti-HIV-1 core, clone KC57, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) 250 times: e.g., 3 μL antibody in 750 μL 1× Perm/Wash buffer (from Fixation/Permeabilization kit, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nWash cells with 100 μL of 1× Perm/Wash buffer.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min) and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of diluted anti-Gag-p24 to each tube.\nIncubate cells for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nWash cells once with 100 μL of 1× Perm/Wash buffer.\nWash cells once with 100 μL of D-PBS.\nResuspend the cells in 200 μL D-PBS and run the samples on a flow cytometer.\nNote: Acquisition of 15–25,000 events is enough to quantify the proportion of HIV-1-infected cells by flow cytometry.",
    "Note: Compensation controls can be prepared by using anti-Mouse Ig compensation beads (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) for antibody staining, and ArC amine reactive beads (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) for Live Dead staining, following manufacturers’ instructions (anti-Mouse Ig compensation beads instructions[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/content/bdb/paths/generate-tds-document.us.552843.pdf]; ArC amine reactive beads instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Farc_amine_reactive_comp_bead_kit_man.pdf]). Same procedure can be applied for every cytometry indicated in the following sections.\nNote: Fluorophores with low spill over between them have been chosen in order to set a correct fluorescence compensation. In addition, when the corresponding antibodies were titrated, the voltage values for each photomultiplier tube (PMT) were optimized to maintain an adequate visual separation between the positive and negative population.\nNote: If low or undetectable level of Gag-p24 is observed, please see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOnce Gag-p24 has been quantified, select wells (duplicates in the plate) with similar level of infection (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) to be stained with CellTrace Far Red (CTFR).\nDay 13: CTFR staining of HIV-1 infected CD4+ T-cells.\nNote: This step is performed to distinguish cells infected with either HIVWT or HIVΔNef in a co-culture system. Both populations of infected cells are stained with CTFR, but the concentration of the dye used to stain each group of infected cells is based on their viral infection (HIVWT or HIVΔNef). Both populations can be easily visualized by flow cytometry (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. CTFR staining of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T-cells\nSchematic of CD4+ T-cells infected with either HIVWT or HIVΔNef and stained with 1 μM or 0.1 μM CTFR, respectively. Representative cytometry of cells stained with CTFR is shown (right).\nNote: Every cell wash implies removing the supernatant after centrifuging each tube at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspending the cells in the designated buffer.",
    "Based on the Gag-p24 quantification obtained in the previous step, select the wells containing cells with similar levels of infection for both viruses (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nNote: If after quantifying the proportion of Gag-p24 positive cells, similar level of infection between HIVWT and HIVΔNef-infected cells is not observed, please see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nTransfer the selected cells into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and perform CTFR staining:\nWash cells once with 200 μL D-PBS.\nDilute the CTFR stock in D-PBS. Prepare one tube with 1 μM CTFR and another tube with 0.1 μM CTFR.\nStain cells with 200 μL of 1 μM (cells infected with HIVWT) or 200 μL of 0.1 μM CTFR (cells infected with HIVΔNef).\nIncubate cells for 15 min at 37°C in the dark.\nAdd 400 μL RF10 to each tube and spin cells down for 5 min at 300 × g.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 150 μL of fresh RF10.\nEffector HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell generation\nTiming: 12 days\nThis section describes the necessary steps to generate effector HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells by using peptides derived from the HIV-1 proteins Gag and Pol.\nNote: This step is performed concurrently with the target CD4+ T-cell generation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] step.\nNote: 80%–90% of the PBMCs thawed in the target CD4+ T-cell generation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section can be used in this step.\nDay 1: Peptide stimulation.\nTake the remaining PBMCs from the target CD4+ T-cell generation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section, step-2a and incubate the cells at a concentration of 2–4 × 106 cells/100 μL in AIM-V media in a sterile FACS tube.\nNote: FBS is thought to interfere with peptide binding. We therefore recommend using AIM-V serum-free media to pulse PBMCs with the HIV-1 peptides.",
    "Note: Every cell wash implies removing the supernatant after centrifuging each tube at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspending the cells in the designated buffer or cell culture medium.\nPulse PBMCs with 4 μg/mL Gag and Pol peptide pool 2 h at 37°C.\nPerform one wash with RF10.\nResuspend the cells in RF10 containing 1 μg/mL of anti-CD28 antibody (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nNote: Cell concentration should be 4 × 106 cells/mL.\nCulture the cells for 12–18 h at 37°C in a 24 well plate.\nNote: Up to 1 mL of the cell suspension can be plated per well in a 24 well plate.\nNote: Cell density is very important in the first few days of CD8+ T cell expansion. If the number of cells is less than 4 × 106, cells can be plated in a 48 well plate. Of note, cells should cover the bottom of the well without large gaps between group of cells. Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] illustrates cell cultures at low (less than 4 × 106 cells/mL) and adequate density (4 × 106 cells/mL).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Density of PBMC culture\nRepresentative microscopy images showing cell density after plating PMBCs post peptide stimulation.\n(A) Cells cultured at a low concentration (1 × 1010 cells/mL).\n(B) Cells cultured at the proper concentration (4 × 1010 cells/mL). Scale bars represent 100 μm.\nDay 2: Supplement the cell culture with IL-2 (100 IU/mL), IL-7 (200 IU/mL) and IL-15 (200 IU/mL).\nReplace the media every 48–72 h with fresh media supplemented with IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15.\nNote: Always supplement RF10 media with IL-2 (100 IU/mL), IL-7 (200 IU/mL) and IL-15 (200 IU/mL) when the addition of these 3 cytokines is indicated.",
    "Note: After one week of culture, the rate of cell proliferation increases. If necessary, cells can be split into multiple wells. As shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8], stimulated cells form cell clusters and may cover the bottom of the well. Avoid overcrowded cultures as illustrated in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Cell culture density\nMicroscopy images depicting culture of PBMCs after stimulation with HIV-1 PTE peptide pool.\n(A) Cells culture showing good cell density.\n(B) Cells from an overcrowded culture. Split cells when convenient to avoid cell density as shown in (B). Scale bars represent 100 μm.\nNote: Whether the media need to be replaced may be judged based on the media color. Please see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for more details.\nNote: After 48–72 h of cell culture, cells should have settled on the bottom of the well. Therefore, media can be replaced by aspirating approximately 900 μL of the old medium, and adding 900 μL of fresh, IL-2-, IL-7-, IL-15-suppplemented RF10. Take care not to disturb the cells from the bottom of the well.\nDay 11: Quantification of HIV-1 specific CD8+ T-cells (optional).\nNote: This step is to verify and quantify the presence of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells after the expansion by quantifying the expression of the degranulation markers CD107a/b upon peptide re-stimulation.\nTake 6 × 105 PBMCs and split them into 3 FACS tubes.\nNote: Extra cells can be taken for Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) control. During the data analysis, FMO controls are recommended to set the gate and cutoff for CD107a/b positive cells, since unstimulated cells may express low levels of CD107a/b.\nNote: Due to the small number of conditions and low number of cells, the stimulation and flow staining can be alternatively performed in a V-bottom 96 well plate.",
    "Note: Every cell wash implies removing the supernatant after centrifuging each tube or plate at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspending the cells in the designated buffer.\nWash cells with RF10 once and resuspend them in 200 μL of RF10 media.\nMake a master mix containing: 17.6 μL RF10, 1.6 μL of anti-CD28, 0.8 μL of anti-CD49d, 20 μL anti-CD107a FITC, and 20 μL anti-CD107b FITC antibodies.\nNote: Addition of CD107a/b antibodies during the stimulation is necessary since the extracellular expression of CD107a/b is transient due to the recycling of the CD107a/b (+) granules.\nAdd 15 μL of master mix to each FACS tube or well if a plate is used.\nNext, stimulate cells as follows:\nTube 1: 4 μg/mL of Gag/Pol peptide pool.\nTube 2: 50 ng/mL PMA + 1 μM Ionomycin (positive control).\nTube 3: no stimulation (negative control).\nAdd the protein transport inhibitor GolgiStop (Monensin) at a final dilution of 1:1000 to each tube. Monensin treatment improves CD107a/b staining.\nIncubate the cells for 5 h at 37°C.\nCell surface staining:\nSpin down cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nWash the cells with 200 μL D-PBS once.\nRemove the supernatant and stain cells with Live Dead NIFR for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.\nSpin down cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nWash the cells with 200 μL D-PBS once.\nMake a master mix containing 300 μL D-PBS/2% FBS, and 3 μL of anti-human CD3, CD4 and CD8 antibodies (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nAdd 100 μL of the master mix to each tube and incubate cells for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nSpin down cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nWash the cells with 200 μL D-PBS/2% FBS once.",
    "Resuspend cells in 200 μL D-PBS/2% FBS and run the tubes on a Flow Cytometer.\nAlternatives: Cells can be fixed with 4% PFA if samples will not be run on the Flow Cytometer immediately.\nCell fixation:\nSpin down cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nWash the cells with 100 μL D-PBS once.\nRemove the supernatant and fix cells with 100 μL 4% PFA for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.\nSpin down cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nWash the cells with 100 μL D-PBS once.\nResuspend cells in 200 μL D-PBS.\nNote: Controls for fluorescent compensation need to be included.\nNote: Fluorophores with low spill over between them have been chosen in order to set a correct fluorescence compensation. In addition, when the corresponding antibodies were titrated, the voltage values for each photomultiplier tube (PMT) were optimized to maintain an adequate visual separation between the positive and negative population.\nNote: Usually the proportion of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells is relatively low and donor dependent. We usually observed values of cells responding to peptide-restimulation between 1%–4%, however this is enough to perform the viral competition assay (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2355-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

An increase in the expression of the degranulation marker CD107a/b upon the restimulation with Gag/Pol peptides indicates expansion of HIV-1-specific cells.\nDay 12: CD8+ T-cell isolation.\nAt day 12 of cell culture, pool cells from every well and count cell number.\nNote: Cell number can be variable between donors, however, approximately 1 × 107 cells is expected. Determining the number of cells is necessary to calculate the volume of reagents needed for the CD8+ T-cell isolation step (below).",

    "Note: CD8+ T-cell recovery after isolation can be variable between donors (35%–70% of the expanded PBMCs). See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] if cell recovery is too low.\nViral competition assay\nTiming: 2 days\nThis protocol evidences the contribution of the viral protein Nef in protecting HIV-1-infected cells from CD8+ T-cell-mediated clearance. In this section cells generated from previous steps are combined.\nDay 13: Prepare target CD4+ T-cells.\nCount the cell number of HIVWT- and HIVΔNef-infected/CTFR-stained CD4+ T-cells from the HIV-1 infection of Target CD4+ T-cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] section- step 6b.\nCombine 1 × 105 cells of both HIVWT- and HIVΔNef-infected CD4+ T-cells in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nSpin cells down by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 200 μL RF10.\nSplit 100 μL of mixed cells into 2 wells in a 96 U-bottom well plate. Effector CD8+ T-cells will be added to one of these wells.\nDay 13: Prepare effector CD8+ T-cells and co-culture.\nCount cell number of isolated CD8+ T-cells from the effector HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell generation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] section step-11d.\nSpin cells down by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in RF10. Final concentration should be 3 × 105 cells/100 μL RF10.\nAdd 100 μL of effector CD8+ T-cells to the corresponding well containing target CD4+ T-cells. This well will correspond to the CD4 (target):CD8 (effector) co-culture condition.\nSupplement the culture media with 20 IU/mL IL-2. At this stage proliferation of either CD8+ or CD4+ T-cells is no longer required. This concentration of IL-2 is enough to promote survival of activated T-cells without promoting excessive cell proliferation.\nThe cell cultures should be also supplemented with ARVs as described in HIV-1 infection of Target CD4+ T-cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], step 5f.\nIncubate cells 12–18 h at 37°C.",
    "Note: All the recommended volumes and number of cells can be scaled up, as long as the concentration of cells and the effector:target (3:1) ratio remain constant.\nDay 14: Quantification of CD8+ T-cell-mediated clearance of HIV-1 infected-cell.\nNote: Every cell wash implies removing the supernatant after centrifuging each tube at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspending the cells in the designated buffer.\nTransfer cells into FACS tubes.\nPerform cell surface and intracellular Gag-p24 staining:\nWash cells with 200 μL D-PBS once and stain with 100 μL 1:1000 Live Dead Aqua for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.\nWash cells with 200 μL D-PBS once.\nMake a master mix containing 300 μL D-PBS/2% FBS and 3 μL of anti-human CD8 antibody (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nAdd 100 μL of the master mix to each tube and incubate cells for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nSpin cells down by centrifugation at 300 × g 5 min.\nWash the cells with 200 μL D-PBS/2% FBS once.\nFix cells with 200 μL Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (from Fixation/Permeabilization kit, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.\nIn the meantime, dilute the anti-Gag-p24 antibody 250 times: e.g., 3 μL antibody in 750 μL 1× Perm/Wash buffer (from Fixation/Permeabilization kit, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nWash cells with 200 μL 1× Perm/Wash buffer.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 100 μL of diluted anti-Gag-p24 to each tube.\nIncubate cells for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nWash cells once with 200 μL 1× Perm/Wash buffer.\nWash cells once with 200 μL D-PBS.\nResuspend the cells in 200 μL D-PBS and run the samples through a flow cytometer.",
    "Note: Approximately 50–70,000 events can be recorded from the tube containing CD4+ T-cells only, and 100–150,000 events can be recorded from the tube containing co-cultured CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells.\nNote: Controls for fluorescent compensation need to be added.\nNote: Fluorophores with low spill over between them have been chosen in order to set a correct fluorescence compensation. In addition, when the corresponding antibodies were titrated, the voltage values for each photomultiplier tube (PMT) were optimized to maintain an adequate visual separation between the positive and negative population.\nAlternatives: Flow staining can alternatively be performed in V-bottom 96 well plates.\nAlternatives: Different time points can be added to this protocol. For instance, intracellular Gag-p24 values can also be assessed after 6 h of co-culture. This would allow for the assessment of the kinetics of the differential killing of cells infected with the different viruses.\nOptional: In our study we used some of the co-cultured cells to perform full-length proviral sequencing and characterize the HIV-1-infected cells which survived to the CD8+ T-cell-mediated clearance.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Details and extra steps needed to perform this sequencing are detailed in Duette et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]"
