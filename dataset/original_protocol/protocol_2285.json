    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare autoclaved sediment and seawater in a laboratory\nTiming: 1 day\nThe following procedure describes the steps required to prepare autoclaved sediment from aliquots of the sediment previously harvested.\nAs was done for incubations, sieve the stored sediment through a 0.5 mm mesh screen to remove large fauna, rocks, and debris.\nHomogenize the sieved sediment by physical mixing. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Oxygen exposure can be reduced during the homogenization process by introducing a tube that flows nitrogen gas into the sediment.\nFill 100 mL autoclave-safe glass bottles with homogenized sediment to about ¾ of the volume.\nFill 1000 mL autoclave-safe bottles with seawater to about ¾ of the volume.\nNote: Sterilized artificial seawater can be used as well.\nAutoclave the glass bottles at 120°C for 1–2 h.\nAllow the autoclaved sediment and seawater to cool down to about 25°C before use.\nNote: Autoclaved sediment can also be stored and sealed at about 25°C until inoculation. The containers remain sealed and are stored in a cool place, for up to two weeks in this study.\nCritical: The homogenization of sulfidic sediment and mishandling of iron sulfide may release hydrogen sulfide, a highly toxic chemical in its gaseous form. We again recommend the use of personal protective equipment such as a sulfide-specific face respirator when in enclosed spaces, and the homogenization process should be conducted under a ventilation hood or in an open well-ventilated space. The autoclaved sediment and seawater should be prepared at least one day to two weeks ahead of the following steps.\nAlternatives: Nitrogen gas can be replaced by other inert gases such as helium and argon.\nExtract cable bacteria filaments from the cultured natural sediment\nTiming: 2 h",
    "The following procedure describes the steps required to isolate CB filaments from the cultured natural sediment matrix.\nTake sub-cores (sediment plugs approximately 0.5 cm in diameter and 1 cm long) from the cultured sediment by using cut-off 1 mL syringes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1891-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Graphical demonstration of the preparation of a cut-off syringe\nLeft: cutting the tip of the 1cc syringe to allow the proper intake of a sediment plug (the red line indicates where to make the cut); right: the finished look of the cut-off syringe.\nReduce the sediment volume around the sampled mass of CB filaments by gentle washing Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlace the extracted plugs of sediment in a glass Petri dish.\nAdd seawater or artificial seawater to the Petri dish.\nGently shake the Petri dish to allow the sediment particles to separate from the CB filaments.\nRemove sediment-laden water from the Petri dish.\nRepeat b–d until the filamentous structure of CB can be observed, and the amount of adhering sediment grains can no longer be reduced (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nNote: Deionized water can be used in this step as well.\nUse the fabricated glass hook to pick CB filaments from the remainder of the washed sediment plug(s). Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPush the hook gently into a suboxic zone of the remaining washed sample, which can be identified by its grayish color.\nSwirl the hook gently several times (3–7).\nSlowly pull the hook away from the sample and look for filamentous structures of CB connecting (extending between) the hook and the remainder of the sediment.\nCollect the filaments by pulling the hook apart from the sediment (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1891-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The stratified zonation of topmost sediment inhabited by cable bacteria",
    "Note: After being pulled out from the sediment, a mass of CB will shrink onto the hook and appear like a “glob”.\nCritical: Samples should be taken from cultured sediments which have developed a pronounced suboxic zone evident by color changes from black to gray and the presence of a band of iron precipitation at the subsurface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Extracting cable bacteria filaments from the natural sediments\nWash and transfer the isolated filaments into the autoclaved sediment\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following procedure describes the steps followed to further wash the isolated CB filaments and transfer the filaments into the autoclaved sediment.\nTransfer the isolated CB filaments to a droplet of the washing solution placed on a microscopic slide (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nUse a clean glass needle to scrape the biomass off the glass hook.\nResuspend the biomass in the droplet of the washing solution.\nNote: Washing solution can be autoclaved seawater, artificial seawater, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, or DI water.\nIf necessary, repeat step 10 until the biomass appears free of sediment particles.\nUse another clean glass needle to pick up the washed biomass and transfer the biomass into the surface layer of the autoclaved sediment (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nIncrease the probability of transferred CB survival by performing multiple transfers into the surface layer of the autoclaved sediment.\nOptional: A sterilized inoculation needle can be used to transfer the CB biomass.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Washing and transferring cable bacteria filaments to autoclaved sediment\nCulture inoculated sediment and evaluate the growth of cable bacteria\nTiming: 3 weeks or longer\nThe following procedure describes the steps required to culture inoculated sediment and to evaluate the growth of cable bacteria.",
    "Slowly submerge the inoculated sediment into an aerated aquarium filled with an autoclaved medium.\nCulture the inoculated sediment. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nEvaluate the growth and presence of CB by measuring the vertical chemical profiles of oxygen, sulfide, and pH.\nNote: The vertical chemical profiles of oxygen, sulfide, and pH that are characteristic of CB can be measured by the microelectrodes. More details about performing microelectrode profiling in a lab can be found in Malkin et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] and Li et al. (2020a, 2020b)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; .\nAlternatives: Artificial seawater can also be used as the culture media in commercially available aquarium tanks. The presence of CB can also be verified by using microscopic techniques (e.g., scanning electronic microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) to identify their unique morphological features namely the longitudinal ridges and cartwheel cell-cell junctions (Li et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Pfeffer et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]), molecular techniques (e.g., fluorescent in situ hybridization) (Li et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Malkin et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), and sequencing techniques (e.g., maker gene analysis and metagenomics) (Geelhoed et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Kjeldsen et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Li et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Trojan et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). The growth and density of CB can be evaluated using counts of stained filaments and quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods (Aller et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Geelhoed et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])."
