    "All animal procedures were performed in compliance with the experimental guidelines approved by the regional authorities and accepted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Southern California (USC), and conformed to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the European directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.\nNOTE: The rats used in this study are pigmented retinal degenerate Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats and Long Evans (LE) rats. Figure 3 shows a schematic illustration showing different stages of OKN testing and analysis.\n1. Procedures\nPreparation of the setup\nKeep the rat in the cage and for 30 min inside the testing room with the room lights turned off.\n\t\tNOTE: This helps to minimize the stress that occurs during transportation and provides a uniform lighting condition for all experiments.\nSet the position of the tablet screens facing each other at 155° to display the OKN Stripes Visualization Web Application.\nPlace the rat holder in the middle of two tablet screens at 4.5 inches from the center.\n\t\tNOTE: At this position, the rat's head will be about 3.5 inches away from the display screen.\nClick on OKN Stripes Visualization Web Application from the desktop of the tablet to display visual stimuli (black and white stripes) starting with the lowest spatial frequency.\n\t\tNOTE: Spatial frequencies 0.08, 0.15, 0.2, 0.24, 0.28, 0.33, 0.38 cycles per degrees (c/d) are used, starting at the lowest spatial frequency (0.08c/d) and changing to higher spatial frequencies (up to 0.38 c/d). At each spatial frequency, rats are tested for both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions in rotation of stripes (1 min each).\nOKN testing procedure\nSelect a rat holder of a suitable size.",
    "Bring the rat toward the opening of the rat holder and carefully guide the rat to the inside.\nAllow the rat to settle inside the holder (1-2 min) prior to testing.\n\t\tNOTE: By proper handling, it is possible to maintain the rat inside the holder in most of the cases; when necessary, the rat holder is held high (up to 2 feet above the table) for a few seconds until the rat settles. The fear of the height is found to reduce the tendency for the rat to climb down from the rat holder. Additional time (1-2 min) is given for the rat to settle, if needed.\nInsert the pedestal of the rat holder into the metal stand for its stable placement.\n\t\tNOTE: This setup allows changing the rat's viewing distance from the tablet screen.\nTurn on the camera to start video recording.\nClick on OKN Stripes Visualization Web Application from the desktop of the tablet screen and start running the program.\nRun the OKN stimuli in the left to right or right to left direction.\n\t\tNOTE: Rotation of the stripes in the clockwise direction activates the left eye, whereas rotation in the counter-clockwise direction activates the right eye. The initial direction of rotation was chosen randomly to avoid potential habituation.\nObserve the rat's head-tracking behavior.\nStart testing using the lowest spatial frequency (0.08 c/d), and then increase the spatial frequency in a step-wise (in the ascending) order.\nNotice the presence or absence of OKN responses.\nContinue testing, no resting period is given between different spatial frequencies.\nStop video recording after completing all the spatial frequencies, and save the data using the rat identification number.\nTake the rat out of the holder and place it in the cage for approximately 30 min resting period between consecutive tests.",
    "Repeat the tests three times per rat.\n2. Data analysis\nReview the recorded video and determine each rat's visual acuity by finding the spatial frequencies at which the rat responded.\nRecord all responses (presence or absence of a clear head-tracking) in a spreadsheet.\nFind the highest spatial frequency to which a rat responded from the three tests. This is considered the final visual acuity.\n\tNOTE: Since visual acuity measurement is subjective, data will be evaluated by two independent study personnel to confirm the visual acuity score for each rat12. The results are cross-checked until the final score is agreed on. A positive OKN response is defined as the presence of a clear and sustained head-tracking activity. Random head-tracking (unrelated to the OKN visual stimuli) or the absence of any head movement is considered a negative OKN response.\nConduct statistical analysis to compare groups or between the two eyes (left eye vs right eye).\n\tNOTE: Review the video recordings to clarify that positive or negative responses is conducted as needed.\nSubscription Required.
