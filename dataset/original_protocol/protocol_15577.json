  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described in this work are conducted in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the care and use of animals in research, and the protocol was approved by the Duke Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Young (8-10 weeks old) and aged (22 months old) male C57Bl/6 mice were used for the present study. An overview of this protocol is illustrated in Figure 1.\n1. Surgical preparation\nExamine the mouse for gross abnormalities and behavioral deficits.\n\tNOTE: Before surgery, it's important for surgeons to wear appropriate PPE (protective personal equipment), including surgical mask, cap, gloves, and gown.\nWeigh the mouse; program the ventilator (see Table of Materials) based on the body weight.\nPlace the mouse in a 4 in x 4 in x 7 in anesthesia induction box. Turn on the oxygen flow meter (see Table of Materials), set at 30, and the nitrous oxide flow meter, set at 70. Turn on the vaporizer with 5% isoflurane.\nInsert the guide wire into the 20 G intravenous (IV) catheter.\nTake the mouse out of the induction box when its respiratory rate is reduced to 30-40 breaths per minute.\nLay the mouse on the surgical bench in a supine position. Pull the mouse's tongue out and hold it with the fingers of the left hand. Insert a laryngoscope (see Table of Materials) into the animal's mouth to visualize the vocal cord.\nStabilize the mouse chin on the laryngoscope using the right middle finger. Free the left hand to hold the 20 G IV catheter.\nInsert the guide wire slightly into the vocal cord, and then slowly push the 20 G IV catheter into the trachea until the wing part of the catheter becomes even with the nose tip.",
    "NOTE: If the mouse is moving, do not insert the wire. This may cause trauma to the trachea and bleeding.\nTurn on the ventilator (see Table of Materials), and connect it with the 20 G IV catheter intubated in the mouse. Reduce the isoflurane to 1.5%, and ensure that both lungs are mechanically ventilated.\n\t​NOTE: Do not forget to reduce the isoflurane concentration. Otherwise, the mouse will receive an overdose of anesthesia.\nApply eye ointment onto both eyes and inject 5 mg/kg carprofen subcutaneously.\nKeep the mouse in a lateral position with the right temporal area facing up. Maintain the rectal temperature at 37 °C using a heating pad (35 °C) and a heat lamp controlled by a temperature regulator (see Table of Materials).\nShave the surface area between the right eye and ear, and disinfect the surgical area at least three times with iodine and alcohol swabs.\n2. MCAO surgery\nOpen the sterile instrument package for MCAO surgery. Wear sterile gloves and make a 1 cm skin incision between the right eye and right ear using surgical scissors.\n\tNOTE: Monitor skin color, body temperature, and response to toe pinch every 15 min.\nDissect the underlying fascia with forceps to expose the temporal and masseter muscles.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to damage the parotid gland.\nUse forceps to touch the lower part of the temporal muscle and detect the location of the zygomatic arch. Carefully pull aside the branches of the facial nerve.\nUse the tip of a high-temperature cautery loop (see Table of Materials) to cut a 5 mm transverse incision on the temporal muscle.\nUse two forceps to dissect the underlying zygomatic arch and expose the joint between the maxilla and zygomatic bones.",
    "Use scissors to cut a 3 mm portion of the zygomatic arch and remove it. Separate the masseter muscle from the skull base.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to fracture the retro-orbital sinus and superficial temporal vein.\nApply four small retractors positioned in different directions to expose the cranial skull base, with the trigeminal nerve branches pulled laterally by one retractor.\n\tNOTE: A sulcus on the external surface of the cranial base marks the location of the lateral fissure between the frontal and temporal lobes. The MCA lies here (Figure 2A), and its trunk and branches are visible through the thin, transparent skull (Figure 2B). The relationship of this artery to other major cerebral arteries is displayed in Figure 2A.\nApply a drop of 0.9% normal saline on the skull above the MCA trunk and proximal to the branch of the rhinal cortex. Use an electrical grinder to thin the skull until a small fracture is visible.\n\tNOTE: Do not push the grinder against the skull, as it may penetrate the skull and injure the underlying artery.\nUse the tip of the forceps to lift the thinned skull and remove it. For sham mice, stop here, and do not ligate the artery.\n\tNOTE: A small rectangular window across the MCA trunk is formed.\nPlace a single-strand loop of black braided silk on top of the MCA (Figure 2C). Insert an 8-0 microsurgical needle to lift the MCA trunk, and tie the suture (see Table of Materials) under the needle, leaving both ends of the needle on the top of the silk thread loop knot (Figure 2D).\nFor transient MCAO, tighten the silk thread knot slightly under the needle to block arterial blood flow (Figure 2E), representing MCAO onset.",
    "Use the forceps to hold the suture, and slowly remove the needle at the end of the ischemia (e.g., 60 min or longer).\n\tNOTE: When the needle is removed, the silk thread knot is slipped off the MCA, and the brain is reperfused (Figure 2F).\nFor permanent MCAO, firmly tighten the silk thread loop around the artery, and remove the needle. Cut and remove the excess suture materials.\nApply a drop of 0.25% bupivacaine to the skin incision, and suture the muscle and skin separately using 6-0 nylon sutures intermittently (see Table of Materials). Apply antibiotic ointment to the surface of the skin incision.\n\tNOTE: The skin incision can also be closed with sterile staples or glue.\n3. Post-surgical care\nTurn the isoflurane off to awaken the mouse. Disconnect the ventilator when spontaneous respiration is restored.\nTransfer the mouse to a recovery chamber (see Table of Materials) with a controlled temperature.\nExtubate the mouse when its righting reflex is restored, or it begins to move.\nClosely monitor the mouse in a temperature- and humidity-controlled chamber. Return the mouse to the home cage after it gains full consciousness (recovery period ~2 h). Administer 5 mg/kg Carprofen subcutaneously daily for 3 days.\n4. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)\nSix and 24 h post-MCAO, mount the anesthetized mouse on the stereotaxic frame. Shave the top of the head, and clean it with three alternating swabs of iodine and alcohol.\n\tNOTE: Anesthetization was performed as mentioned in step 1.3. LSCI is also performed before MCAO.\nMake a 3 cm midline skin incision and dissect the skin from the skull. Apply four small needle retractors to expose the skull top.\nMove the laser speckle camera (see Table of Materials) above the head, and adjust the focus of the camera. Image the cerebral blood flow.",
    "5. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining\nDeeply anesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane at the end of the experiment, typically on day 1, 3, or 28 after stroke. Pinch the tail to ensure there is no pain response.\nDecapitate the mouse using a surgical scissor and harvest the brain. Incubate the brain in ice-cold saline for 20 min.\nPut the brain in a brain slicer matrix on ice and drop cold saline on the brain. Cut the brain into 1 mm slices using thin razor blades.\nImmerse the brain slices at the same orientation into a dish of 2% TTC solution (see Table of Materials). Keep the dish in the dark at room temperature for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Normal brain tissue becomes red and ischemic tissue remains white.\nTransfer the brain slices to 10% formalin for 24 h of fixation. Image the brain slices and measure the infarct area.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
