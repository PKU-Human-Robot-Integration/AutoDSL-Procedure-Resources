    "1. Cell Preparation\nNotes: 1) complete RPMI 1640 based culture media recipe (500 ml) includes 435 ml RPMI 1640, 50 ml heat inactivated FBS, 5 ml non-essential amino acids, 5 ml sodium pyruvate, 5 ml antibiotic-antimycotic; 2) place matrigel at 4 °C one day prior to cell harvest.\nHuman ATC cell line THJ-11T8 are grown in 6 well culture plates and harvested once 80-90% confluent.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature.\nAspirate media and resuspend cells in RPMI 1640 media [2 ml/6 well plate].\nTake a small volume of the cell suspension, add it to one volume of 0.4% trypan blue dye and determine cell density using TC10 Automated Cell Counter.\nCalculate volume of cell suspension needed to get 5 x 105 cells/mouse times the number mice injecting.\nNote: To ensure adequate cell suspension for injection, prepare cells as though you are injecting double the number of mice (e.g. if injecting 5 mice, then prepare cell suspension as though you were injecting 10 mice).\nTransfer needed volume of cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 200 x g for 4 min at room temperature.\nAspirate media and resuspend cells in complete RPMI 1640 media.\nTransfer cells to a 1.6 ml tube, add 1 volume of matrigel and mix gently by slowly pipetting in and out.\nNote: Each mouse will receive 10 μl of the cell suspension/matrigel cocktail. Since 5 x 105 cells suspended in a 10 μl injectable volume have been successfully used in previous ATC orthotopic studies9-10, we used those parameters in this report.\nPlace cell suspension on ice until ready to use.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nClean the surgical zone, which includes the dissecting scope and surrounding area, by wiping all surfaces with 70% ethanol.",
    "Turn on heating lamps/pads where animals will be recovering from surgery.\nAdminister 0.1 ml ketamine/xylazine (drug cocktail consisting of ketamine 9 mg/ml and xylazine 1mg/ml) per 10 g body weight intraperitoneally using a 1 ml, 27G ½\" Tuberculin syringe.\nPrep mouse for surgery: 1) shave neck region of mouse (from jaw line to top of sternum and out to arms), 2) scrub surgical area three times with chorhexadine soaked gauze squares, 3) final scrub done with betadine soaked gauze, 4) gently apply eye ointment to prevent eyes from drying.\nCheck pedal reflex to ensure mouse is adequately sedated.\nPlace animal in dorsal recumbency on a disposable sterile field barrier under the dissecting scope and secure the animal in place with cloth tape.\nScrubs hands and fingernails then put on sterile surgical gloves.\nIn a sterile fashion, open surgery pack and arrange instruments.\nPlace sterile drape over animal, leaving only surgical site exposed.\n3. Surgical Access to Thyroid and Cell Injection\nUsing a sterile, disposable scalpel, make a 1-to-1.5 cm longitudinal incision along the midline of the throat.\nNote: Deviation from the midline complicates deeper cutting to access the trachea. Fairly precise midline incision allows you to tease and cut through the membranous tissue holding left and right salivary glands together and reduces chance of nicking or severing large arteries.\nMake a second incision into the strap muscles surrounding the trachea then pull the right side of the incised muscle to the side to expose the right thyroid gland.\nHemostats can be used at this point to hold the muscle layer apart for easy access to the thyroid gland (Figure 1).",
    "Note: Alternatively, if procedure performed by two surgical staff, the muscle layer may simply be held back with forceps while a ready injectable syringe is handed to the surgeon by the assisting staff.\nSlowly inject 10 μl of cell suspension into the right thyroid gland using a 31G 5/16\" insulin syringe then gently remove needle.\n4. Closure of Surgical Site and Mouse Recovery\nSuture muscle layer with 6.0 suturing material using either a continuous or interrupted suturing style.\nStitch the skin in the same fashion.\nApply a layer of triple antibiotic ointment directly over incision site.\nAllow animal to recover in dorsal recumbency on warm heating pad. Once animal can achieve sternal recumbency without assistance, it can be placed back with other mice.\n5. Post-operative Monitoring and Tissue Collection\nCheck the incision site and overall health of the animal daily for a week following surgery, then check once a week. If the sutures are still intact after 14 days, they are removed.\nNote: Animals exhibiting signs of declining health (e.g. substantial weight loss, scruffy hair, labored breathing) should be euthanized and tissues collected.\nOnce mice have reached a predetermined post-operative time-point, administer ketamine/xylazine as describe above to sedate.\nPerfuse animal intracardially and harvest thyroid/trachea and other tissues of interest (not described in detail here)."
