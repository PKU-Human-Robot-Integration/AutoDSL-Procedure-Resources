Detailed below is an AST protocol whereby both bacterial culture and MIC assays are performed in standard CAMHB and in DMEM cell culture medium.\nIsolate bacteria on bacteriologic agar media.\nLB: Gram-negative pathogens.\nIncubate 18 h, 37°C, ambient atmosphere.\nNote: Pathogen-specific media/incubation.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\nE. faecium/S. aureus: TSB, incubate 18 h, 37°C, ambient atmosphere.\nS. pneumoniae: CNA + 5% sheep blood, incubate 18 h, 37°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nCulture bacterium (3 biological replicates).\nInoculate 1 colony per replicate into 0.5 mL of 100% CAMHB and DMEM.\nIncubate 18 h, 37°C.\nCAMHB, ambient atmosphere, shaking (225 rpm).\nDMEM, 5% CO2 atmosphere, standing.\nNote: Pathogen-specific media/incubation.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\nS. aureus CAMHB: inoculate with 5–7 colonies; no incubation.\nS. aureus DMEM: supplemented with 5% v/v LB; inoculate with 1 colony; incubate 18 h, 37°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere, standing.\nS. pneumoniae CAMHB: supplemented with 5% v/v LHB; inoculate with 5 colonies; incubate 4 h, 37°C; ambient atmosphere, standing.\nS. pneumoniae DMEM: supplemented with 5% v/v LHB; inoculate with 5 colonies; incubate 4 h, 37°C; 5% CO2 atmosphere, standing.\nPrepare microtiter plates to determine MIC\nTiming: 2–3 h\nMIC testing requires preparing appropriate antibiotic concentration test ranges and bacterial inoculum concentrations for reliable MIC determination.\nPrepare antibiotic dilutions (3 biological replicates).\nPrepare 100 mL of test media (CAMHB and DMEM).\nPrepare media-diluted drug stock.\nDilute concentrated drug stock (e.g., 10 mg/mL) into ∼400 μL of test media (CAMHB or DMEM) to generate a media-diluted drug stock at 2 × the highest drug concentration in test range.",

Seven mL of 2 × inoculum is required per microtiter plate.\nNote: Cfu/mL for each pathogen/media was already determined by direct colony count (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], Step 4).\nTransfer 100 μL to microfuge tube to verify inoculum cfu/mL in Step 6.\nDecant remaining ∼7 mL to sterile Petri dish (to facilitate pipetting).\nAdd 50 μL of 2 × bacterial inoculum to all wells except column 12 (media only).\nAdd 50 μL of additional media to wells in column 12 (media only).\nNote: Pathogen-specific media.\nE. faecium CAMHB/DMEM: supplemented with 30% v/v TSB.\nS. aureus DMEM: supplemented with 5% v/v LB.\nS. pneumoniae CAMHB/DMEM: supplemented with 5% v/v LHB.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\nMIC assay incubation\nTiming: 20 h\nConstant incubation time is critical for reliable MIC determination.\nIncubate 20 h, 37°C, standing.\nCAMHB, ambient atmosphere.\nDMEM, 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nConfirm 2 × bacterial inoculum (106 cfu/mL) (aliquoted in Step 4a).\nSerially dilute (∼103-fold); plate 100 μL onto LB agar.\nIncubate 18 h, 37°C, ambient atmosphere.\nVerify actual 2 × bacterial inoculum is within 3-fold of target (106 cfu/mL).",

    "AST in human sera and urine presents a formidable challenge as these host fluids can be inhibitory to bacterial culture. Some pathogens form bacterial cell-to-cell aggregates in sera and/or do not grow to adequate bacterial cell densities in sera or urine for reliable MIC determination.
