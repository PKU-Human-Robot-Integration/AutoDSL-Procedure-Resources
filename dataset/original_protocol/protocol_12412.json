    "1. Preparation of Instruments and Reagents\nTransfer Pasteur pipettes\n\t\nGenerate a series of transfer Pasteur pipettes with different tip diameters by pulling 230 mm long Pasteur pipettes above a flame at different speeds. Ensure that the taper is as long as possible for smooth and fine control of aspiration.\nWith a diamond scribe, scratch the pipette along a line perpendicular to the length of the pipette. With both hands, pull the pipette parallel to its length to generate a blunt cut. Swiftly flame-polish the pipette without sealing the tip.\nVary the diameter of the tip with the stage of the oocytes/embryos to be pipetted: 300-400 µm for unfertilized oocytes (around 150 µm in diameter), 600 µm for fertilized eggs (around 500 µm in diameter), 200-400 µm for hatched neurulae. Use pipettes with a mouth-monitored aspiration tube to transfer oocytes/embryos from one dish to another.\nInjection needles\n\t\nManipulate the capillaries with gloves to ensure RNase-free conditions. Use borosilicate glass with filament capillaries with dimensions of OD 1.20 mm, ID 0.94 mm, length 10 mm.\nIf capillaries are pulled on the type of heating-filament needle puller described in the Materials List, use the following settings: Heat 600, Pull 50, Velocity 80, Time 60, Pressure 200 or 300. Otherwise, ensure that the shape, which is crucial for successful injections, is as shown in Figure 2 with the following properties: 4-8 µm outer tip diameter, 2 cm taper length.\n\t\tNOTE: Needles can be pulled before the spawning season and used throughout the season.\n5% Phenol Red stock solution (4x)\n\t\nPrepare fresh before each spawning season.\nIn a 0.22 µm-filtration tube, weigh out 25 mg of Phenol Red powder.\nAdd 0.5 ml of DNase- and RNase-free water to the tube containing the powder.",
    "Spin for 3-5 min at 18,000 x g at room temperature to filter-sterilize the solution and remove crystals that could clog the injection needle.\nStore at 4 °C or store 250 µl aliquots at -20 °C.\n0.25 mg/ml poly-lysine solution\n\t\nPrepare fresh before each spawning season.\nDissolve 5 mg of poly-L-lysine in 20 ml distilled water. Store 5 ml aliquots at -20 °C.\nUse a defrosted aliquot immediately and only once to ensure reproducible and robust adhesion of the oocytes to the poly-lysine-coated dish.\nmRNA synthesis\n\t\nPrepare fresh before each spawning season.\nLinearize 5 µg of DNA of interest with the adequate enzyme (usually for 2 hr, at 37 °C). To check the completeness of the digestion, run 2% in volume of the digestion mix on a 1% agarose-TBE gel in TBE buffer at 150 W for 20 min.\nExtract the linearized DNA with 25:24:1 phenol (pH 8.0):chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. Vortex for 20 sec, centrifuge 10 min at 18,000 x g and collect the aqueous (upper) phase.\nExtract the aqueous phase again with 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. Vortex for 20 sec, centrifuge 10 min at 18,000 x g and collect the aqueous phase.\nPrecipitate the linearized DNA with 100:10:300 linearized DNA:3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2):100% ethanol overnight at -20 °C.\nCentrifuge 20 min at 18,000 x g at 4 °C. Rinse in 70% ethanol.\nCentrifuge 10 min at 18,000 x g at 4 °C. Let dry and resuspend in RNase-free water at a final concentration of 0.5 µg/µl.\nTranscribe 1 µg of linearized DNA using an mRNA synthesis kit with the appropriate polymerase, according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nExtract the mRNA with 5:1 phenol (pH 4.7):chloroform and ammonium acetate stop solution provided with the kit.\nVortex for 20 sec, centrifuge 10 min at 18,000 x g and collect the aqueous phase.",
    "Extract the aqueous phase again with 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. Vortex for 20 sec, centrifuge 10 min at 18,000 x g and collect the aqueous phase.\nPrecipitate the mRNA with 100% isopropanol overnight at -20 °C.\nCentrifuge 20 min at 18,000 x g at 4 °C. Rinse in 80% ethanol.\nCentrifuge 10 min at 18,000 x g at 4 °C. Let the pellet dry at room temperature for no longer than 5-10 min as it will then be difficult to resuspend. Resuspend in DNase- and RNase-free water to a final concentration of at least 2 µg/µl to ensure a decent final mRNA concentration in the injection mix.\nTo check the quality and size of the transcription product, run 0.5 µl of the mRNA on a RNase-free 1% agarose-TBE gel in TBE buffer at 150 W for 20 min. Store 2 µl aliquots at -80 °C.\nPoly-lysine-coated dishes\n\tNOTE: Poly-lysine coated dishes are used to immobilize the oocytes during injection.\n\t\nFor each 35 mm cell-culture Petri dish (5 in total), cover the bottom of the Petri dish with 1 ml of the thawed 0.25 mg/ml poly-lysine solution. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nFor each 35 mm cell-culture Petri dish (5 in total), transfer the 0.25 mg/ml poly-lysine solution into another 35 mm cell-culture Petri dish. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nDiscard the 0.25 mg/ml poly-lysine solution.\nLet the Petri dishes dry, upside-down at room temperature for 2 hr.\nStore the poly-lysine-coated dishes wrapped in a plastic wrap at 4 °C to avoid contamination for one week maximum.\nAgarose-coated dishes\n\tNOTE: They are used to culture injected embryos. The agarose provides a cushion for the injected embryos and prevents them from sticking to the bottom of the dish.",
    "Make artificial seawater (ASW) using 37-38 g/L commercial salts + 0.25 mM NaHCO3 in reverse osmosis water.\nDissolve agarose to a 1% concentration in 0.22 µm-filtered ASW by heating the solution in a microwave.\nSwiftly pour the warm agarose solution from one 35 mm Petri dish into another one in order to ensure a very thin agarose coating of the dish.\nStore the agarose-coated dishes wrapped in Saran wrap at 4 °C to avoid contamination for one week maximum.\nInjection mix and loading of the injection needles\n\t\nAbout 2 hr before starting the injections, make a 2 µl injection mix in RNase- and DNase-free water with final concentrations of 1-1.8 µg/µl of mRNA, 15% glycerol, 1.25% Phenol Red.\n\t\tNOTE: The Phenol Red colors the solution, which allows monitoring of the injection efficiency and the identification of successfully injected embryos. Glycerol favors mRNA diffusion within the oocyte.\nCentrifuge 4 min at 18,000 x g to pellet crystals. Keep on ice until use.\nWith a 10 µl pipette, collect 0.5 µl of the injection mix, avoiding the bottom of the tube, where the crystals have been pelleted.\nBackfill at least two injection needles (in case one breaks during the injection) by pipetting the 0.5 µl drop of injection mix at the large opening of the needle.\nInstall the needles in a storage jar with liquid at the bottom at 4 °C to prevent evaporation of the injection mix. Let the injection mix slowly travel to the tip of the injection needle for at least 1 hr to minimize the creation of bubbles.\nStore additional injection mix at -80 °C for maximum of three additional uses, after which the mRNA quality deteriorates (data not shown).\n2. Collection of Biological Material, Microinjection and Embryo Culture\nOocyte and sperm collection",
    "NOTE: See Theodosiou et al.12 for a detailed protocol for inducing spawning and for gamete collection.\n\t\nShock males and females in ASW at 23 °C for 24 hr.\nOne to two hours before sunset, transfer the adults into individual cups in ASW at 19 °C because most adults will spawn 1-2 hr after sunset.\nRinse 35 mm Petri dishes in filtered ASW and let them dry upside-down to prevent the oocytes from sticking to the bottom of the dish.\nUpon spawning, immediately collect sperm and oocytes with a 1,000 µl pipette.\n\t\t\nKeep sperm and oocytes separate from adult amphioxus because the contact is detrimental for gamete health (data not shown).\nFurthermore, avoid startling the adults, which leads to movements that dissipate, and hence dilute, both sperm and oocytes. To keep the sperm active as long as possible and to optimize fertilization rate, collect the sperm as concentrated as possible.\nKeep sperm on ice in a 1.5 ml tube.\nTransfer oocytes in filtered ASW into the pre-rinsed 35 mm Petri dishes.\nTransfer 100-500 oocytes with a previously pulled 300-400 µm transfer Pasteur pipette to another 35 mm Petri dish to perform the injections.\nFertilize the remainder of the clutch as a control for sperm and oocyte quality or for other experiments.\nOocyte injection\n\t\nInstall the injection needle on the micromanipulator at a 50° angle relative to the horizontal plane.\n\t\tNOTE: Angles of less than 50° will push the oocytes around on the dish, while angles of more than 50° will not allow an appropriate monitoring of the needle position relative to the oocyte.\nUnder a fluorescent dissecting scope with 25X oculars, transfer 30 oocytes with the 300-400 µm transfer Pasteur pipette on a poly-lysine-coated dish containing filtered ASW.",
    "Deposit the oocytes along a line to carry out injections in an ordered way and to distinguish injected from non-injected oocytes. Inject small numbers (30 oocytes) to minimize the exposure time of oocytes to poly-lysine, which tends to deform developing embryos (data not shown).\nUse the dark field illumination to render the oocytes as translucent as possible.\nWith the coarse movement knob of the micromanipulator, bring the injection needle close to an oocyte.\nWith fine forceps, cut open the needle at the level where the tip starts to be curved. By pulsing with the injector, verify that red injection mix is actually flowing out of the needle.\nAt 200X magnification and with the fine movement knob of the micromanipulator, gently move the injection needle inside the core of the oocyte.\n\t\tNOTE: If inserted too superficially, the injected solution will not remain inside the oocyte. If inserted too far, the oocyte will be destroyed.\nInject with 1-3 pulses of 120 msec duration and 1-10 psi pressure. If the needle is fine enough, inject with continuous flow at constant pressure. Ensure that the injection volume corresponds to 1/5 to 1/3 of the volume of a single oocyte.\nFollowing injection, pull the needle out swiftly to avoid leakage of the oocyte.\nVerify that the injected solution remains within the oocyte and that after a few sec, the injected solution spreads throughout the oocyte.\nMove on to the next oocyte in line.\nKeep some uninjected embryos of each series as negative control to estimate the background fluorescence when scanning for injected embryos.\nFertilization, selection of injected embryos and embryo culture\n\t\nFertilize the oocytes as soon as a series has been injected. As oocyte quality declines with time, inject and fertilize oocytes within 1 hr after spawning12.",
    "Depending on the sperm concentration, add 1-5 drops of sperm to the oocytes and swirl the dish.\n\t\tNOTE: The fertilization envelope should become apparent on the embryos after about 1 min.\nAllow the embryos to detach from the poly-lysine-coated dish, while injecting another series of oocytes.\nTransfer the embryos with the 600 µm transfer Pasteur pipette into an agarose-coated Petri dish. Remove the embryos from the poly-lysine-coated dish as soon as possible, if at all possible before the 2-cell stage.\n\t\tNOTE: In case of prolonged exposure to poly-lysine, the embryos tend to become densely-packed blastulae, flattened on the side touching the bottom of the dish.\nAt the 2-cell to 4-cell stage, select with a fluorescent dissecting scope with DSR filter the successfully-injected embryos, i.e., those with a normal morphology that exhibit a Phenol Red-derived red fluorescent signal.\nKeep the embryos in culture in filtered ASW in agarose-coated Petri dishes at 19 °C until the desired stage for in vivo imaging.\nSubscription Required.
