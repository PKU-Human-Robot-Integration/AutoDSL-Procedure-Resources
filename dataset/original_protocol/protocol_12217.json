    "Procedures involving animal subjects were conducted in compliance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and animals were maintained in accordance with the Home Office published Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Bred, Supplied or Used for Scientific Purposes.\nNOTE: Experiments carried out using wild-type C57Bl/6J mice are well established and described below. Embryonic metatarsals from different mouse strains may similarly be cultured in vitro, although their growth and mineralization rates may differ to those detailed herein.\n1. Dissection Conditions and Preparation of Instruments\nPerform all media preparation, tissues dissections and culture work in a laminar flow hood to ensure the sterility of media and embryonic rudiments.\nAllow culture and dissection media to equilibrate for at least 1 hr in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator prior to use.\nSterilize dissection scissors, Dumont #5 and Dumont #4 tweezers alongside a pair of superFine Vannas micro scissors (8 cm straight, 3 mm blades) by autoclaving. After autoclaving, immerse the dissection equipment in 70% ethanol prior to use.\n2. Preparation of Dissection and Culture Media\nPrepare dissection medium\nDilute α-Minimum Essential Media (without nucleosides, αMEM) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (1:13) and resuspend bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 2 mg/ml before filter sterilizing through a 0.22 µm, 33 mm diameter syringe filter.\n\t\tNOTE: Dissection medium can be made, filter sterilized and stored in aliquots at -20 °C indefinitely.\nPrepare culture medium\nCulture embryonic metatarsals in 300 µl of culture medium (in each well of a 24-well culture plate). Prepare the culture medium by adding 0.2% w/v BSA; 5 µg/ml L-ascorbic acid phosphate; 1 mM β-glycerophosphate (βGP; optional – see results section); 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin and 1.25 µg Amphotericin B to αMEM and filter sterilize through a 0.22 µm, 33 mm diameter syringe filter.",
    "3. Murine Embryonic Metatarsal Dissection and Culture\nCull the pregnant mouse, harboring 15-day-old embryos, by cervical dislocation in accordance with home office guidelines in the U.K.\nPlace the animal supine and disinfect skin by spraying with 70% ethanol. Using dissection scissors make a large incision in the midline, penetrating both the skin and the peritoneum to expose the abdominal cavity.\nLocate the two uterine horns of the animal in the dorsal region of the body cavity. Remove the uterine horns by firstly freeing each uterine from the mesometrium by careful incisions with dissection scissors and then finally cutting the uterine horns free at their base. Place uterine horns into dissection medium.\nSeparate each embryo by cutting between implantation sites along the uterine horn and remove the embryos from their individual sacs using forceps. Cull embryos by decapitation in accordance with home office guidelines in the U.K.\nAfter disinfection of the skin by spraying with 70% ethanol, use Vannas micro scissors to remove the hind limbs from the embryos by incising around the proximal femur. This ensures as much of the hind limb as possible is removed. Place the hind limbs into a petri dish submerged in dissection medium prior to metatarsal dissection.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, begin to remove the skin surrounding the embryonic foot, by pinching and pulling it off using the #5 tweezers whilst holding the hind limb steady using the #4 tweezers. This is most effectively performed by grasping the skin at around the level of the tibia and pulling towards the phalanges. The use of scissors at this stage to cut the very thin skin is not required.",
    "Carefully hold the tarsals of the embryonic foot with #4 tweezers and remove the first and fifth metatarsals by pinching off near the tarsals using #5 tweezers and discard.\nWith the foot held in the same position, use the #5 tweezers to disrupt the connective tissues between the three remaining phalanges and metatarsals. Insert the tip of #5 tweezers at the joint between the phalanges and metatarsals to remove the phalanges from the metatarsals.\nFinally, use #5 tweezers to disrupt the connective tissues between the tarsals and metatarsals. Again place the tip of #5 tweezers in the joint space between the tarsals and metatarsals and gently free the metatarsals from the tarsals.\nGently pick up the now free metatarsals with #4 tweezers and place in fresh dissection medium.\n\tNOTE: Careful dissection should provide 6 metatarsals from each embryo.\nWhen all required metatarsals have been dissected, carefully place metatarsals individually into the pre-warmed 24-well plates containing 300 µl of culture media. Culture metatarsals at 37 °C in a 5 % CO2 incubator for up to 14 days.\n\tNOTE: Do not change the media of E15 cultures until at least day 5 of culture as this affects their mineralization capability 26. The reasons for this are unclear but linear growth and matrix mineralization may be dependent upon stimulation by growth factors released from the metatarsals.\n4. Analysis and Manipulation of Metatarsal Cultures\nOn the day of dissection (day 0) make initial longitudinal measurements using a microscope with a digital camera attached and image analysis software. Measure the length of the central mineralization zone when it appears after a few days of culture.\nPeriodically, as required, make further measurements (usually every 2nd day) until the final day of culture at which point metatarsal bones are processed dependent upon required outcomes (discussed in introduction).",
    "Supplement medium of metatarsal organ cultures with various exogenous factors e.g. growth factors, hormones and pharmacological agents from day 0 of culture 22,24. In all studies of this kind, control untreated metatarsals are required.\n\tNOTE: Although it is advisable that the control bones are the equivalent rudiment from the contralateral leg, there have not been any differences in linear growth or mineralization potential of cultured E15 2nd, 3rd and 4th metatarsals (see below, Figure 2)."
