Aliquot the stock solution and store at -20°C until use. A volume of 50 μl of 10× Starter Duplex is sufficient for 25 reactions (2 μl per reaction). Note: R2R DNA with unequal ratios of 1-nt 3’ DNA overhang nucleotides can be used to mitigate template-switching biases in TGIRT-seq (Mohr et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2019) ,Set up the above reaction components in a sterile PCR tube for annealing of oligonucleotides to form the Starter Duplex.Incubate the mixed 10× Starter Duplex components at 82°C for 2 min in a pre-heated thermocycler.Cool to 25°C with a 10% ramp or at a rate of 0.1°C/s.Note: The annealed R2 RNA/R2R DNA Starter Duplex should be prepared freshly each time before the template-switching reaction. Discard any left over after use. Template-switching reverse transcription reactionSet up the following reaction components in a sterile PCR tube adding the TGIRT-III enzyme last (Table 2).Table 2.

    "Notes:  Because TGIRT enzymes can also template switch to DNA, RNA samples should be DNase treated prior to TGIRT-seq. Minimum RNA Inputs for DNase-treated RNA samples are: 2 ng rRNA-depleted, chemically fragmented cellular RNA; 20-50 ng rRNA-depleted, unfragmented cellular RNAs; 500 pg plasma RNA; 2 ng RNA extracted from highly purified extracellular vesicles. Measure low RNA concentrations with a Qubit or Bioanalyzer. See Notes 1-4 at the end of the text for further details regarding preparation of RNA samples for TGIRT-seq. We use 200 mM NaCl in this protocol instead of 450 mM NaCl used in earlier versions to increase the efficiency of template switching without prohibitively increasing multiple sequential template switches, which result in artifactual fusion reads. See also Note 5 below. Do a pilot experiment to determine the optimal enzyme concentration for your samples using an Agilent Bioanalyzer or equivalent instrument to monitor library quality and quantity. A template-switching reverse transcription reaction using the TGIRT-III enzyme to a commercial RNA ladder (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog number: AM7145) can be carried through the procedure as a positive control. Pre-incubate at room temperature for 30 min, then initiate template switching and reverse transcription by adding 1 μl of 20 mM dNTPs (an equimolar mixture of 20 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP).Incubate at 60°C for 15 min for whole cell, EV, or plasma RNAs, 5-10 min for mature miRNAs, or up to 60 min for long or heavily modified RNAs. The optimal incubation time should be determined experimentally for different RNA templates.Add 1 μl of 5 M NaOH and incubate at 95°C for 3 min.Cool to room temperature and neutralize with 1 μl of 5 M HCl.Note: Steps B4 and B5 are needed because TGIRT-III binds very tightly to nucleic acids.",
    "Alkaline hydrolysis degrades the RNA template and enzyme but not the cDNA products. Add 78 μl of nuclease-free water to bring to a final volume of 100 μl.Clean up the cDNAs with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup kit (QIAGEN, catalog number: 28204) or a MinElute PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN, catalog number: 28004) and elute in 10 μl of QIAGEN elution buffer.Note: Incubate the column with the elution buffer at room temperature before centrifugation to maximize recovery. The procedure can be interrupted here, with the cDNAs stored at -20°C. Proceed with R1R adenylation, thermostable ligation, and Phusion PCR amplification.R1R 5' DNA adenylation using the New England Biolabs kit (New England Biolabs, catalog number: E2610S/L)Note: If the adenylated oligonucleotide is purchased from a commercial supplier, proceed to the ligation step.

After clean-up, recovered material should be 80-100 ng/μl for R1R and 100-120 ng/μl for 6N UMI R1R, measured with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer using the ssDNA setting. Adenylation can be monitored using an Agilent Bioanalyzer with a Small RNA kit. The adenylated oligonucleotide can be stored at -20°C for up to two weeks.

    "PCR cycles:Denaturation 98°C for 5 s.Up to 12 cycles of 98°C for 5 s, 60°C for 10 s, 72°C for 15-30 s/kb, hold at 4°C.Notes:  Minimizing the number of cycles of PCR amplification decreases bias and duplicate reads. Twelve PCR cycles is generally satisfactory for TGIRT-seq with RNA inputs indicated in Section B. The number of cycles can be increased or decreased for different RNA inputs and library complexities. The procedure can be interrupted here and the PCR products stored at -20°C. Use AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog number: A63880) to deplete adapter-dimers and enrich for desired DNA sizes in the library. The default ratio is 1.4× v/v (70 μl of beads/50 μl of PCR reaction). The ratio of beads to sample volume can be adjusted depending on the size profile of RNAs being sequenced.Check library quality by analyzing 1 μl on a Bioanalyzer with a High Sensitivity DNA Analysis kit (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4239/bioprotoc-11-23-4239-g002.jpgFigure 2. Bioanalyzer traces of representative TGIRT-seq libraries obtained by using an Agilent Bioanalyzer with a High Sensitivity DNA kit. A. Ribo-depleted and chemically fragmented HeLa S3 cellular RNA (20 ng starting material after ribodepletion). Library products for cellular RNAs that were fragmented to 70-90 nt run at 190-210 bp. B. Plasma RNA (0.5 ng of starting material). Library products run at 140-240 bp, with the peak at ~200 bp corresponding to library products from tRNAs. Residual adapter dimers (AD), which are present at low concentrations in the final libraries, run at ~120 bp for R1R-R2R, and slightly larger with the UMI R1R adapter or Unique Dual Index (UDI) PCR primer. Peaks smaller than 100 bp correspond to unused PCR and adapter oligonucleotides (P+A). The lower (35 bp) and upper (10,380 bp) markers are internal markers provided with the High Sensitivity DNA kit.",
    "DNA lengths (bp) are determined by the software program based on the ladder provided with the kit.Notes:  If needed, an additional round of the 1.4× AMPure XP beads clean-up can be performed to further deplete levels of adapter dimers. More extensive AMPure XP beads clean-up can result in loss of library products. The final TGIRT-seq library can be stored at -20°C until submitted for sequencing. Sequencing and data analysisTGIRT-seq libraries can be sequenced on any Illumina sequencing instrument to obtain single-end (SE) or paired-end (PE) reads. Read length and read depth are dependent upon the needs of the experiment. We have used PE75 on a NextSeq 500 with 330 million reads output for analysis of cellular, EV, and plasma RNAs. We have also used PE150 on a NovaSeq with at least 700 million reads output for large projects or samples requiring high-depth analysis.Because TGIRT-seq simultaneously profiles coding and non-coding RNAs, read mapping pipelines for TGIRT-seq typically use a sequential mapping strategy with specialized databases to first map reads with rRNA and tRNA sequences encoded at multiple loci, and sncRNAs embedded within introns in protein-coding genes, before mapping the remaining reads to a human genome reference sequence. In addition to end-to-end alignment, a local alignment step is typically included to more efficiently capture reads with non-templated nucleotides added to the 3' end of cDNAs by TGIRT enzymes. Detailed protocols for read processing and mapping, including UMI deconvolution of duplicate reads, and peak calling for the identification of protein-protected mRNA fragments, structured excised intron RNAs, and intron RNA fragments as potential biomarkers in human plasma can be found in       Yao et al. (2020)      .",
    "Additional TGIRT-seq read mapping protocols used for different sample types and applications, including statistical tests and details of replicates for different applications, can be found in the following references: plasma RNA (Qin et al., 2016); total cellular RNA, including spike-ins (Nottingham et al., 2016); plasma DNA, including nucleosome positioning and mapping of DNA methylation sites (Wu and Lambowitz, 2017); sncRNAs (Boivin et al., 2018); total cellular RNAs, including detailed analysis and remediation of sequencing biases (Xu et al., 2019)."
