    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIt is recommended that protocol steps 1–3 (establishment of the cell line) be completed non-stop as per the time indications for each step. However, steps 4 (OVA staining) and step 5 (Recombinant protein expression) can be performed on different days as required by the user.\nStep 1: Euthanization and dissection\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nThis step involves the collection of the magnum region of the oviduct. Chicken hens have a single oviduct located at the back left-hand side of the abdominal cavity, accessed through the abdomen.\nNote: Euthanization should be performed by a qualified, trained individual (i.e., veterinarian or animal technician). Dissection can be performed personally or with technical assistance from a veterinarian or animal technician.\nWeigh hen to determine the amount of sodium pentobarbitone to administer (200 mg/kg).\nAt the discretion of the qualified individual, euthanize the chicken by injection of Sodium Pentobarbitone into either the medial metatarsal vein (leg) or brachial wing vein (wing).\nNote: To minimize contamination, use F10 disinfectant spray or 70% ethanol to sterilize all equipment and the outer abdomen.\nPluck the abdomen feathers and, using the scalpel, scissors and forceps, open the abdomen to reveal the abdominal cavity.\nNote: To avoid contamination from internal organs, especially the intestines, refrain from using scissors/forceps to remove or pierce any internal organs. If necessary, use scissors to cut the loose connective tissue holding the organs in place and use your fingers to move the liver and gizzard to the right side of the abdomen.\nOnce the oviduct is identified, cut out a 10 cm section of the magnum region (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and put it in the 50 mL tube containing 1× PBS/ Primocin.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2899-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection reference for collection of the oviduct magnum",
    "The oviduct is generally folded into a small area of the abdomen, with the ovary (O) and magnum (M) region the most noticeable due to their size. The magnum is held in place by loose connective tissue (black arrow) that needs to be cut to unravel the section for dissection. Shell glad (SG) containing an egg.\nNote: The top part of the oviduct (infundibulum) is ∼10 cm long. The magnum is the second part of the oviduct, ∼30 cm long. Morphologically, the magnum is identified by its larger diameter, coiled nature and thick walls.\nStep 2: Tissue processing and dissociation\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps aim to dissociate the magnum tubular glands into a single-cell suspension for Percoll density centrifugation. From this point, all steps must be performed in a biosafety hood of a tissue culture facility.\nTissue processing\nWith Vannas Scissors and forceps, trim the outside of the oviduct of connective tissue and blood vessels in a 60 mm tissue culture dish.\nCut the oviduct into two pieces, roughly 4–5 cm long.\nCut each oviduct piece lengthwise along the oviduct to open it and expose the lumen lined by tubular glands.\nWash the oviduct pieces 3–5× in 1× PBS/ Primocin until all residual egg white and blood have been removed.\nIn a new 60 mm tissue culture dish, mince the oviduct tissue finely (<1 mm in diameter) using scissors and a scalpel/ razor blade.\nTissue dissociation\nTransfer the minced tissue to a 50 mL tube and add 10 mL 1 mg/mL Collagenase P.\nIncubate at 37°C for 40 min, agitating the solution every 10 min.\nNote: A sterile shaker incubator can be used for continuous gentle agitation (50 rpm) if available.\nStep 3: Percoll isolation of epithelial cells\nTiming: 40–50 min",
    "This step aims to separate the co-isolated fibroblasts from the tubular gland epithelial cells of the magnum. The discontinuous Percoll gradient is based on buoyant densities for epithelial cells (1.065–1.07 g/mL) and fibroblasts (1.04–1.055 g/mL) from previous publications.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] The Percoll gradient is prepared during the 40 min incubation for tissue dissociation.\nPrepare the stock isotonic Percoll (SIP) and duplicate Percoll dilutions according to Table 1 in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nPrepare the discontinuous Percoll gradient in a 15 mL tube:\nStarting with the highest density (1.08 g/mL), layer the Percoll dilutions from bottom to top in a 15 mL tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2899-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Technique for layering the Percoll dilution during preparation of the Percoll discontinuous gradient\n(A) Each Percoll dilution aspirated and mixed with a 1 mL syringe/ 20G needle.\n(B) The needle bevel is placed against the side of the 15 mL tube and the liquid gently layered on top of the previous density.\n(C) The final discontinuous Percoll gradient.\nNote: To minimize disruption of the lower layer, add each Percoll dilution with a 1 mL (1 cc) syringe and a 20G needle. Keep the needle bevel angled against the side of the 15 mL tube and slowly layer each dilution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAfter the 40 min dissociation, gently pipette the cell suspension up and down several times to break cell clumps and allow the larger tissue fragments to settle at the bottom of the tube.\nFilter the supernatant through a 70 μm nylon cell strainer into a new 50 mL tube.\nTransfer the filtered supernatant to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL DMEM and layer the single-cell suspension on top of the Percoll gradient.",
    "Centrifuge the Percoll gradient at 1000 × g for 40 min at room temperature.\nDuring the centrifugation, add 1 mL complete culture media (Table 2, materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to 8 wells of a 12-well plate labeled \"fraction 1–8\" (in duplicate), and keep in a CO2 incubator to pre-warm to 37°C.\nAfter centrifugation, plate the Percoll fractions spanning across the density borders in the prepared 12-well plate.\nRemove and dispose of the first 500 μL from the top of the Percoll gradient.\nRemove and plate 1 mL fractions with a p1000 micropipette in the appropriately labeled wells of the prepared 12-well plate.\nNote: To reduce contamination of cells in higher-density fractions by those above, use a new p1000 tip for each fraction.\nCritical: It is important to remove each fraction as a whole to prevent disruption of lower fractions, pipetting from the top of the fraction and moving down as the liquid level drops. Inserting the pipette too far into the fraction can disrupt the layer and remove liquid from the fraction below.\nIncubate the 12-well plates at 37°C, 5% CO2, checking the plates daily until cells have settled. The cells will settle after 2–5 days, at which point the media can be replaced.\nAll fractions with no visible fibroblasts after 1 week can be pooled into a single well using 1× trypsin-EDTA and expanded for future use. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nStep 4: Immunocytochemistry (ICC)\nTiming: 2–5 days\nThis step validates the cell line by confirming the expression of the major egg white protein, ovalbumin.\nDay 1–3, preparation of samples:\nSeed COEC and fibroblasts (control) on separate 12 mm coverslips placed in two wells of a 24-well plate.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2, until 60%–70% confluent.",
    "Note: To ensure that most cells attach to the coverslip, the cells can be seeded directly onto the coverslip and incubated for ∼ 10–30 min to allow cells to attach. The well can be filled with culture media to the appropriate volume when most cells have settled. The time to confluency can take 2–3 days.\nDay 4, ICC staining:\nWhen 60%–70% confluent, remove culture media and fix cells in 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash cells 2× in 1× PBS to remove 4% PFA.\nPermeabilization: Wash cells 2× with 1 mL TBST for 5 min each on an orbital shaker (50 rpm).\nBlocking: Add 1 mL 3% BSA in TBS to each well and incubate for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker (50 rpm).\nAdd the 200 μL primary antibody (Mouse monoclonal anti-chicken OVA, BioLegend Cat# 520401; RRID: AB_2561635) at 10 μg/mL in TBST/3% BSA and incubate overnight at 4°C.\nDay 5, ICC staining continued:\nWash cells 3–5× in TBST for 5 min on an orbital shaker (50 rpm) to remove excess primary antibody.\nNote: All steps should be performed in the dark from this point.\nAdd 200 μL of the secondary antibody (Rabbit Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (FITC), Abcam Cat# ab97045; RRID: AB_10687747) at a 1:100 dilution in TBST/ 3% BSA, and incubate for 2 h at room temperature in the dark.\nWash cells 3–5× in TBST for 5 min on an orbital shaker (50 rpm) to remove excess secondary antibody.\nCounter-stain the nuclei with DAPI (1 μg/mL) for 5 min at room temperature in the dark.\nWash cells for 5 min in 1× TBS to remove excess DAPI.\nMount the coverslips onto a microscope slide with mounting media, such as Fluoromount Aqueous Mounting Medium.",

Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nStep 5: Transfection, recombinant IgG expression and purification\nTiming: Approximately 1−1.5 weeks\nCOEC can be used to express and validate recombinant proteins for potential large-scale expression in transgenic chicken eggs. Prospective recombinant proteins can be expressed in COEC from constitutive promoters (i.e., CMV) or egg-white gene promoters, such as the native OVA promoter after CRISR-Cas9 knock-in into the OVA locus.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] This Percoll-established cell line has been used for the expression of a functional HIV broadly neutralizing antibody shown to be able to neutralize the virus during a neutralization assay (Loubser, C., Moore, P. and Nikitina, N. V. (2023). Feasibility of expressing a highly potent CAP 256V2LS antibody in ovo: preliminary study. [Unpublished manuscript]). To mimic oviduct secretion of egg-white proteins, the chicken lysozyme signaling peptide (GenBank: NM_205281.2 (RRID: SCR_002760); base pairs 32–85) can be placed directly upstream of the recombinant protein coding sequence. Lysozyme constitutes 3.5% of the egg white,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and the lysozyme signaling peptide has been utilized for recombinant protein secretion into the oviduct in transgenic chickens.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nThis section aims to provide a general protocol for transfection and expressing recombinant IgG and Protein A purification from the Percoll-derived COEC.\nTransfection and recombinant IgG expression\nAt least one day before:\nPrepare a large-scale, endotoxin-free preparation of the recombinant IgG expression plasmid according to the manufacturers’ protocol: https://worldwide.promega.com/products/nucleic-acid-extraction/plasmid-purification/pureyield-plasmid-midiprep-system/?catNum=A2492#protocols[href=https://worldwide.promega.com/products/nucleic-acid-extraction/plasmid-purification/pureyield-plasmid-midiprep-system/?catNum=A2492].\nNote: Any commercial endotoxin-free midi- or maxi-prep kit can be used.\nDay 1–3, preparation of cells for transfection:\nIn a T25, seed COEC at 1 × 106 and incubate (37°C, 5% CO2) until 60%–70% confluent.\nNote: The time to confluency can take 2–3 days.\nDay 4, transfection:\nOn the day of transfection, replace the culture media with 4.6 mL of fresh complete culture media.",
    "Note: For antibody expression with Protein A purification, replace the FBS in the COEC culture media with chicken serum. Protein A does not bind and therefore does not co-purify chicken IgG in the serum. Alternatively, IgG-depleted FBS can be used.\nTransfection using a 3:1 ratio of PEI MAX and plasmid DNA:\nDilute 15 μL of 1 mg/mL PEI MAX in 200 μL OptiPRO SFM.\nDilute 5 μg plasmid DNA in 200 μL OptiPRO SFM.\nAdd the diluted PEI MAX to the diluted DNA, mix by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nAdd the transfection mix (400 μL) to the T25 containing 4.6 mL culture media.\nIncubate the T25 overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nThe next day, replace the culture media and incubate the T25 for 5–7 days, replenishing the hormones every 2 days.\nProtein A purification\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section addresses the purification of the recombinant IgG antibody secreted into the cell culture media. Protein A is derived from Staphylococcus aureus and binds to the Fc region of IgG antibodies from various animals.\nPrepare the IgG column:\nResuspend the Protein A beads and add 2 mL to a 14 cm chromatography column attached to a retort stand, and allow the column to settle.\nEquilibrate the column with 10 mL 1× PBS.\nAlternatives: Prepacked Protein A antibody purification kits can be used, such as the Protein A Antibody Purification Kit (Cat#ab288103).\nAfter 5–7 days, collect the culture media and centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 20 min.\nLoad the supernatant onto the column and collect the flow through for storage on ice.\nNote: The supernatant can be passed through the column 3–4 times to ensure the binding of all antibody present.\nWash the column twice with 10 mL 1× PBS.",
    "Elute the antibody from the column with 4.5 mL elution buffer into a 15 mL tube containing 500 μL neutralization buffer.\nConcentrate the eluted antibody to <1 mL using a 10 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 6 concentrator, according to the manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.sartorius.com/download/1341138/vivaspin-manual-6-20-slu6092-en-sartorius-pdf-data.pdf[href=https://www.sartorius.com/download/1341138/vivaspin-manual-6-20-slu6092-en-sartorius-pdf-data.pdf]\nQuantify the antibody using spectrophotometry (i.e., Nanodrop), and store the antibody at −20°C for future use."
