    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRevive mel1 and H9 cells\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes the procedure to revive human embryonic stem cell lines.\nQuickly thaw a vial of frozen mel1 or H9 cells (4×105 cells) by gently swirling the vial in a 37°C water bath.\nOnce cells are thawed, immediately transfer cells to a 15 mL conical tube and add 5 mL DMEM/F-12 medium to the cells, drop by drop.\nGently mix the cells.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 mL DMEM/F-12 medium.\nCentrifuge at 20°C–25°C at 300 × g for 3 min again.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells with 2 mL TeSRTM-E8TM medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 which is prewarmed to 37°C.\nCritical: It is important to add Y-27632 in the medium for the first 24 h after reviving or splitting cells. Otherwise, the survival will be greatly impaired (Watanabe et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nCritical: If the freezing medium contains embryonic stem-cell FBS, cells must be washed at least twice with DMEM/F-12 medium. Otherwise, cells will differentiate in the presence of FBS.\nAspirate the medium from Matrigel-coated 6-well plates, and seed 4×105 mel1 or H9 cells into them.\nQuickly shake the plate in short side-to-side and back-and-forth motions to evenly distribute the cells in the well.\nNote: Because cells will quickly attach to Matrigel, it is important to shake the plate right away after adding cells.\nPlace the plate in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\n24 h later, replace Y-27632 containing TeSRTM-E8TM medium with 2 mL fresh warm Y-27632 free TeSRTM-E8TM medium.\nNote: Y-27632 is not needed after cells grow on plates for 24 h.\nChange medium daily, and cells will reach confluency on day 3.",
    "Note: Increase TeSRTM-E8TM medium to 3–4 mL per well when cells reach above 50% confluency.\nPassaging of mel1 or H9 cells\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes how to split and passage cells, which is essential for hESC maintenance and differentiation.\nIt is time to split cells when cells reach 70–80% confluency and colonies start to contact and fuse with each other.\nAspirate TeSRTM-E8TM medium from cells.\nAdd 2 mL warm 0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS to the cells and incubate at 37°C incubator for 10 min.\nRemove EDTA when cells are dissociated from each other but are still attached to plates.\nFlush the surface of the wells with 1 mL prewarmed TeSRTM-E8TM containing 10 μM Y-27632.\nCritical: It is important to include Y-27632 in the medium at this stage. Otherwise, the survival will be impaired.\nNote: Cells can be frozen for storage at this step.\nMake 2 × freezing medium: 20% DMSO, 60% embryonic stem-cell FBS, 20% TeSRTM-E8TM medium with Y-27632 (Kent, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nMix cell suspension with equal volume of 2 × freezing medium.\nAliquot the cell suspension from 1 well of a 6-well plate to 5 cryogenic vials.\nFreeze the vials at −80°C for 18–24 h in a 2-propanol-filled freezing container.\nTransfer cells to a N2 tank for long-term storage.\nNote: Cells can also be frozen with 10% DMSO and 90% TeSRTM-E8TM medium with Y-27632 only. But adding embryonic stem-cell FBS in the freezing medium improves cell survival, especially after long-term storage. To remove FBS after revival, cells need to be washed with 5 mL DMEM/F-12 medium at least twice. hESCs can also be frozen with mFreSR cryopreservation medium (Stemcell Technologies).\nSeeding mel1 cells for endoderm differentiation using STEMdiff differentiation medium plus crotonate\nTiming: 30 min",
    "This step describes how to seed mel1 cells on Matrigel-coated plates for differentiation using STEMDIFF differentiation medium plus crotonate.\nCount cells, and seed 3.5–4 × 104 cells per well (0.92–1.05 × 104 cells/cm2) into a new Matrigel-coated well of a 12-well plate. – Day -1\nCritical: Cell density is important for efficient endoderm differentiation. We found that cells seeded at density ranging from 0.52 – 2.1 × 104 cells/cm2 can all efficiently differentiate into endoderm cells after a 3-day induction with crotonate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). However, cells seeded at a density higher than 1.05 × 104 cells/cm2 experience increased cell death, and cells seeded at more than 4.21 × 104 cells/cm2 density dramatically reduce their differentiation efficiency (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/785-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Endoderm differentiation of hESCs under different cell densities\n(A) Phase contrast images of mel1 hESCs seeded at 2 × 104, 4 × 104, 8 × 104, or 16 × 104/well of a 12-well plate before induction (Day 0), and at 3 days after induction (Day 3). Mel1 cells were seeded at the indicated density. On day 0, cells were washed with DPBS once, and incubated with 1 mL (0.26 mL/cm2) STEMDIFF endoderm differentiation medium together with 5 mM crotonate for 3 days. Scale bar: 400 μm.\n(B) High seeding cell density reduces endoderm differentiation. Mel1 cells were seeded at indicated densities and induced for endoderm differentiation for 3 days as described in (A). The total RNA was extracted, and the mRNA levels of SOX17 and FOXA2 were analyzed by qPCR and normalized with the mRNA levels of GAPDH (n = 3 biological replicates/group, ∗p<0.05, values are expressed as mean ± SEM).\nGrow cells at a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nInducing mel1 cells for endoderm differentiation using STEMdiff differentiation medium plus crotonate\nTiming: 10 min a day",
    "This step describes the methods for endoderm differentiation using STEMDIFF differentiation medium plus crotonate.\nRemove TesRTM-E8TM medium on the next day. — Day 0\nWash cells with DPBS once.\nCritical: It is important to wash cells once with DPBS to remove any remainder of TeSRTM-E8TM medium, as it maintains pluripotency and inhibits differentiation.\nAdd prewarmed 1 mL (0.26 mL/cm2) endoderm differentiation medium from STEMDIFF trilineage differentiation kit, followed by adding crotonate to a final concentration of 5 mM.\nCritical: Please thaw and store the endoderm differentiation medium at 4°C to maintain the active differentiation factors in the medium. The medium can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks. Only aliquot and warm enough medium for each use.\nNote: 5 mM crotonate is sufficient to promote endoderm differentiation of mel1 cells.\nGently move the plates to mix the medium and leave the plates at 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nChange endoderm differentiation medium containing crotonate daily for 2 days. — Day 1 and 2\nNote: Cells do not grow within 24 h after induction. However, they start to proliferate and migrate after day 1, and reach confluency with 90.2% SOX17+ and FOXA2+ endoderm cells on day 3.\nPause point: At this step, cells can be frozen at −80°C for RNA isolation or kept at 4°C after fixation for several days before examining endoderm differentiation.\nSeeding H9 cells for endoderm differentiation with 1 × MEM NEAA, 25 ng/mL Activin A, 2 μM CHIR99021, 0.2% defined FBS, and 5 mM crotonate (RACC medium)\nTiming: 10–30 min per day\nThis step describes how to seed H9 cells into Matrigel-coated plates for endoderm differentiation with RACC medium.",
    "Count cells, and seed 20.0 × 104 cells per well (2.1 × 104 cells/cm2) into a new Matrigel-coated well of a 6-well plate with prewarmed TeSRTM-E8TM medium containing 10 μM Y-27632. – Day -2\nCritical: please seed the suggested cell number as described in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nQuickly shake the plate to evenly distribute the cells in the well followed by incubating the plate in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\n24 h later, gently aspirate old medium and replace it with 2 mL of new and warm TesRTM-E8TM medium. -- Day -1\nPlace the dish in an incubator and grow cells at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nInducing H9 cells for endoderm differentiation with RACC medium\nTiming: 10 min a day\nThis step describes the procedures to induce endoderm differentiation of H9 cells with RACC medium.\n18–24 h later, aspirate TesRTM-E8TM medium and wash with 2 mL of warm RPMI 1640 medium. — Day 0\nCritical: It is important to wash cells with warm RPMI 1640 medium before induction. Initiation of induction two days after H9 cells are seeded improves cell survival during differentiation.\nAdd 1.8 mL (0.19 mL/cm2) of RACC endoderm differentiation medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% dFBS, 1 × MEM NEAA, 25 ng/mL Activin A, 2 μM of CHIR99021, and 5 mM of crotonate) to each well and grow the cells in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\n24 h later, replace old medium with 1.8 mL of new endoderm differentiation medium. – Day 1\n24 h later, collect samples. – Day 2\nNote: Upon differentiation, H9 cells quickly migrate and proliferate after differentiation induction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/785-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "20 × 104 H9 cells/well (2.1 × 104/cm2) of a 6-well plate were seeded, washed with warm RPMI 1640 medium once, and induced with 1.8 mL (0.19 mL/cm2) RACC endoderm differentiation medium for 48 h. Scale bar: 400 μm\nPause point: At this step, cells can be frozen at −80°C for RNA isolation or kept at 4°C after fixation for several days before examining endoderm differentiation.\nExamining endoderm differentiations\nTiming: 2 h\nThe expression of key endoderm markers like SOX17 and FOXA2 is examined and quantified by qPCR and flow cytometry to determine the efficiency of endoderm differentiation. CXCR4 is another widely used endoderm marker.\nImmunofluorescence and/or flow cytometry analyses of endoderm cells using endodermal marker SOX17 and FOXA2. — Day 3 or 2\nImmunofluorescence analysis:\nOn Day 3 or 2, take out endoderm cells differentiated on Matrigel-coated coverslips.\nAspirate medium, and wash with DPBS once.\nFix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nRemove paraformaldehyde and wash coverslip with DPBS once.\nPermeabilize cells with 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS at 20°C–25°C for 10 min, followed by wash with DPBS once.\nDilute anti-SOX17 antibody (1:200) and anti-FOXA2 antibody (1:200) in DPBS containing 10% FBS.\nSpot 50 μL antibody solution for each coverslip on a clean parafilm and place a coverslip on the 50 μL antibody solution with cells facing down for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nFloat each coverslip with a drop of DPBS, and take all coverslips to a 12-well plate, wash with DPBS for 4–5 times.\nMaking secondary antibody solutions: 1:500 dilution for donkey anti-goat IgG (Alex Fluor 594) and 1:500 dilution for donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Alex Fluor 488) in DPBS containing 10% FBS.",
