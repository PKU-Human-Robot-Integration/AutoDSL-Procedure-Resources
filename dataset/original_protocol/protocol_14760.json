    "Ethics statement: The Washington University Animal Studies Committee approved all mouse infections and procedures as part of protocol number 20150226, which expires 12/10/2018. Overall care of the animals was consistent with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Research Council and the USDA Animal Care Resource Guide. Euthanasia procedures are consistent with the “AVMA guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals 2013 edition.”\n1. UPEC UTI Protocol, Inoculation Needle Preparation (Figure S1)\nRemove the cap of the 30 G needle. Thread approximately 1 inch of PE10 tubing onto the shaft of the needle. UV sterilize the needle assemblies overnight. Catheterized needles can be stored indefinitely in sterile petri plates.\n2. UPEC Bacterial Inoculum Preparation\nPrepare UTI89 inoculum (start 72 hr prior to the inoculation day)\n\t\nStreak UTI89 onto an LB (Luria-Bertani) agar plate from a frozen stock. Incubate overnight at 37 °C. Pick a colony and inoculate it into 10 ml of LB in a 125 ml flask. Incubate at 37 °C for 24 hr, statically.\nInoculate 10 µl of overnight culture into 10 ml of LB in a new 125 ml flask for an additional 24 hr at 37 °C, statically.\nTransfer 3 ml (will vary based on strain and desired inoculum size) to sterile 1.5 ml tubes and centrifuge at 7,000 x g for 3 min and resuspend the pellet in 1x PBS and centrifuge a second time. Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 1 ml 1x PBS.\nMeasure bacterial optical density and adjust concentration to the desired inoculum density. The standard concentration of the inoculum used is 107 bacteria; however, this may vary due to the design of the study.\n3. Bacterial Inoculation\nClean the workstation with 70% ethanol and cover area with absorbent paper (or use sterile flow hood).",
    "Draw up to 0.9 ml of the prepared bacterial inoculum into a 1 ml (TB) syringe (remove air bubbles). Attach a prepared sterile inoculation needle with PE10 tubing, onto the syringe containing the inoculum, then sterilely trim the polyethylene tubing.\n\tNOTE: Leave 1 mm of tubing above the tip of the needle to avoid puncturing the bladder.\nCut a 1 inch square piece of parafilm and put a dab of surgical lubricant (approximately the size of a dime) on top.\nAnesthetize female C3H/HeN mice by putting them in a vaporizer chamber (following manufactures protocol) until unconscious but still breathing normally (1 breath/sec).\n\tNOTE: Some IACUC committees do not approve the use of a vaporizer. Please follow the indication of the IACUC committee of your institution.\n\tCAUTION: Isoflurane is an inhalation anesthetic. Use in a well-ventilated area and minimize inhalation.\nRemove the mouse from the vaporizer and place it on its back on a paper towel and spread the legs.\nCover the nose of the mouse with a nose cone (a tube connected to the vaporizer that provides a controlled isoflurance dose that comes equipped on some vaporizer units) to maintain anesthetization.\nGently palpitate the bladder to induce urination and ensure a voided bladder. Wipe the periurethral area with 100% ethanol wipe. Dab the inoculation needle/syringe, point first, into the surgical lubricant.\nInoculate each mouse with 50 µl of the bacteria solution by inserting the inoculation needle transurethrally, approximately 12 mm, and pressing down on the syringe plunger gently to dispense the inoculum into the bladder gently (10 µl/sec). Remove the inoculation needle from the mouse.\n\tNOTE: Immediate return of inoculum at the urethral opening when beginning to inoculate indicates improper or incomplete insertion of the needle.",
    "Remove the mouse from nose cone and return it to its cage. Repeat steps 3.3-3.8 for each mouse. When/if switching inoculum conditions/strains, dispose of the syringe and inoculation needle in an approved sharps container and start again step 3.2.  \n\tNOTE: Inoculation with uropathogenic organisms generally does not cause severe pain symptoms. However, in rare instances, administering large doses of pathogens may cause fever, reduction in food and water intake and abnormal behavior. Animal health should be monitored throughout the experiment. If overt pain symptoms are notice, an analgesic, such as Buprenorphine (0.05−0.1 mg/kg given subcutaneously), can be applied. Procedures should be in accordance with each institution’s IACUC.\n4. Determination of Bacterial Burdens\nPrepare separate 5 ml tubes for each bladder and kidneys pair to be harvested. Add 1ml of 1x PBS/tube/mouse bladder to be harvested. Add 0.8 ml of 1x PBS/tube/pair of mouse kidneys to be harvested. Label each tube to correspond to a given mouse. Prepare a 96-well plate containing 180 µl of 1x PBS in each well for 1:10 serial dilutions.\nClean the work area with 70% ethanol and cover the area with an absorbent cover or paper towel.\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (see step 3.4) until the mouse stops breathing for approximately 1 min, then place it on the absorbent cover or paper towel. Other methods of euthanasia are also accepted by IACUC committees, such as carbon dioxide, and can be substituted for isoflurane overdose.\nSacrifice the mouse by rapid cervical dislocation that consists of restraining the neck at the base of the head and pulling the tail horizontally away from the body until dislocation occurs.\n\tNOTE: Most IACUC committees require a secondary means of euthanasia and cervical dislocation is a common method. However, other methods can be used if approved by the IACUC committee.",
    "Place the dead mouse on its back and spray 70% ethanol on the abdomen. Dissect the mouse, harvest the bladder and kidneys, in that order to minimize potential contamination from the blood following the kidney dissection. Place the organs independently into the prepared 5 ml tubes containing 1x PBS (see step 4.1).\n\tNOTE: Use different scissors for the external dissection and for organ harvesting to minimize contamination.\nTap the tube to ensure the organs are in the 1x PBS. Repeat step 4.3-4.5 for each mouse. Clean scissors and forceps in 70% ethanol after each mouse.\n5. Bacterial Recovery\nHomogenize harvested bladder and kidneys in the 5 ml tubes with a tissue homogenizer, 15 sec per kidney and 30 sec per bladder. Rinse homogenizer sequentially in 1x PBS, 70% ethanol and 1x PBS between samples.\nMake serial 1:10 dilutions out to 10-8 and plate each dilution for CFU (colony forming units) on LB agar plates. Incubate the plates at 37 °C overnight and count colonies the next day.\n6. IBC Enumeration\nAseptically remove the bladder and place it in 1x PBS in a 6-well plate with a silicone bottom. Plates can be prepared using a silicone elastomer kit and pouring approximately 1 cm of silicone in each well, see manufactures instructions. Cut the bladder in half using scissors.\nUsing small metal pins gently splay the bladder so that the bladder lumen is facing upward. Be sure to place the pins at the outermost edges of the bladder sections to ensure the maximal amount of urothelium is exposed.",
    "After splaying, gently wash the bladder once with 1x PBS. Remove the 1x PBS by pipet. Fix the bladder by adding enough 3% paraformaldehyde to cover the entire splayed bladder. CAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is carcinogenic. Proper protective equipment, including gloves, should be worn at all times. Disposal should follow institutional guidelines.\nIncubate at room temperature for 1 hr. Remove paraformaldehyde solution. Wash once with 1x PBS.\nWash with LacZ wash solution (2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate and 0.02% nonidet-p40in 1x PBS) three times for 5 min per wash.\nRemove wash solution and add enough LacZ stain (9.5 ml LacZ wash solution, 0.4 ml 25 mg/ml X-gal and 0.1 ml of 100 mM K-ferrOcyanide/K-ferrIcyanide) to cover the bladders. Incubate at 30 °C overnight protected from light.\nRemove splayed bladders from incubator and observe IBCs, which appear as blue puncta as visualized with a dissecting scope, 40-60X magnification.\n\tNOTE: Sometimes a mouse may urinate prior to placement of the tube under the urethra. In this case, wait 15-20 min before attempting to collect urine again.\n7. Urine Collection for Bacteriuria CFU Enumeration (Not Applicable for CAUTI)\nTo collect urine pre or post infection gently restrain the mouse by holding the tail and placing it on a flat elevated surface (top of mouse cage).\nHold a sterile 1.5 ml tube under the mouse urethra. Gently press down on the back of the mouse near the tail to apply pressure to the bladder. Catch the urine in the 1.5 ml tube.\nMake serial 1:10 dilutions out to 10-7 and plate each dilution on appropriate LB. Incubate the plates at 37 °C overnight and count colonies the next day.\n8. CAUTI Model Protocol, Catheter Needle Preparation for CAUTI Model (Figure S2)",
    "Remove the cap of the 30 G needle. Cut a 7 mm piece of PE10 tubing and 5 mm piece of silicone tubing such as RenaSIL. Thread the needle with PE10 tubing until the tubing touches the base of the needle.\nThen feed the 5 mm piece onto the PE10-containing needle. UV sterilize the needles assemblies overnight.\n\tNOTE: When loading the silicone tubing, leave approximately 1 mm of the tubing extending past the needle tip.\n9. E. faecalis OG1RF Bacterial Inoculum Preparation\nPrepare OG1RF inoculum starting 48 hr prior to the inoculation day. Streak OG1RF onto a BHI (brain heart infusion) plate from a frozen stock.\nPick a colony and inoculate it into 10 ml of BHI and grow it statically for 18 hr at 37 °C. Centrifuge the culture and wash the pellet (3 times) in 1 ml volumes of sterile 1x PBS.\nResuspend the bacterial pellet into 1x PBS. Measure bacterial optical density and adjust the concentration to the desired inoculum size. The standard concentration of the inoculum used is 107; however, this may vary due to the design of the study\n10. Catheter Implantation\nClean the workstation with 70% ethanol and cover the area with an absorbent cover (or use sterile flow hood).\nAttach catheter-needle to an empty 1 ml (TB) syringe. Cut a 1 inch square piece of parafilm and put a dab of surgical lubricant (approximately the size of a dime) on top.\n\tNOTE: Two different needles are used for deposition of the catheter and for the inoculum to minimized accidental inoculation due to the mechanical manipulation necessary for catheter implantation. This also allows for the convenience of preparing fewer inoculation needles.",
    "Anesthetize C57BL/6 mice by putting them in a 32 ounce glass jar containing a tea-infuser ball with cotton balls soaked in 3 ml of isoflurane or vaporizer chamber (following manufactures protocol) until unconscious but still breathing normally (1 breath/sec).\nThen put the mouse on its back on a paper towel and spread the legs. Cover the nose of the mouse with a nose cone or 50 ml conical tube with cotton balls containing a small amount (approximately 1-2 ml) of isoflurane.\n\tCAUTION: Isoflurane is an inhalation anesthetic. Use in a well-ventilated area and minimize inhalation by researcher.\nGently palpitate the bladder to induce urination and ensure a voided bladder. Wipe periurethral area with a 100% ethanol wipe.\nDisinfect the periurethral area with 10% povidone-iodine solution using a cotton-tip applicator. Dab the inoculation needle/syringe, point first, into the surgical lubricant.\n\tNOTE: Povidine-iodine is used for catheter implantation, which is a stronger aseptic solution than alcohol. Catheter implantation requires more mechanical manipulation to insert the catheter and thus a greater potential for contamination.\nInsert the catheter into the urethral opening. Once in, use tweezers to push the (7 mm PE10) long piece toward the bladder, consequently pushing the (5 mm silicone) small catheter and depositing it into the bladder. Remove the needle, with the 7 mm tubing still attached, immediately.\n11. Bacterial Inoculation\nFollow the bacterial inoculation protocol in section 3, using the prepared inoculum from section 9. Remove the mouse from the nose cone and return it to its cage\n12. At Each Time Point of Sacrifice\nPrepare 5 ml tubes for bladder and kidney (For organs follow step 4.1) and 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube for catheters. Add 1 ml of 1x PBS into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube for catheter samples",
    "Follow steps 4.3 to 4.5. Dissect the mouse, harvesting the bladder, kidneys and catheter, placing the tissues independently into 5 ml tubes containing 1x PBS and the catheter into the 1.5 ml Eppendorf (see step 12.1).\n\tNOTE: Use different scissors for the external dissection and for organ harvesting and catheter retrieval to minimize contamination\nThen follow step 4.6.\n13. Bacterial Recovery\nFor organs, follow steps 5.1 and 5.2. For bacterial recovery from catheters, vortex at maximum speed for 30 sec, sonicate the catheter samples for 5 min using a bath sonicator, and then vortex at maximum speed for an additional 30 sec.\nMake serial 1:10 dilutions out to 10-8 and plate each dilution for CFU enumeration on BHI plates. Incubate the plates at 37 ºC overnight and count colonies the next day.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
