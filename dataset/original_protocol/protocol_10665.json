    "1. Preparation of Water Dispersible Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)\nDisperse first CNTs in cell culture water, before sonicating them for 20 min in a bath-water sonicator at 20 °C. If CNTs are functionalized with a fluorescent probe, protect them as much as possible from light throughout the experiment.\n2. Labeling Cells with CNTs\nGrow human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (for example) on 25 cm² plates in DMEM medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin streptomycin.\nPrepare solutions of CNTs at concentration of 0, 10, 20, and 50 µg/ml in complete medium and incubate cells with at 37 °C for 20 hr or at 4 °C for 20 hr (2ml of CNT suspension for a 25 cm² plate).\n3. Cell Fixation\nRemove incubation medium afterwards; rinse cells with PBS, trypsinize, and resuspend cells in complete DMEM medium. Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,200 rpm.\nReplace the medium first by paraformaldehyde 4% for 1 hr at 4 °C, then by PBS to preserve them. If needed, cells can be stored at this stage of the process at 4 °C for several days until the cytometry analysis.\nEach sample has to contain about 106 cells concentrated in 50 µl of PBS. Suspend them correctly to avoid aggregates during the analysis and filter them through a 50 μm mesh stainer.\nNote: Each step has to be performed very gently to preserve cells.\n4. ImageStream Acquisition\nUse the multispectral imaging flow cytometer ImageStream to acquire images of cells.\nSome points have to be respected:\nSelect an adapted magnification (here a 40X objective is used).\nIf fluorochromes are used:\n\t- prepare a control sample without fluorochrome.\n\t- prepare cells with a single-color positive control for each fluorochrome used in\n\taddition to your samples.",
    "Use the laser 488 nm to excite the FITC and the channel 02 to collect the fluorescence emission (band-pass 480-560 nm). In addition, use also the channels 01 and 06 for the bright field (BF) and dark field(DF) respectively.\n5. Post Processing - IDEAS Analysis Software (Version 4.0)\nAmong all the events acquired, the analysis has to be first restricted to the population of single cells: use a biparametric dot plot representing 'aspect ratio' (i.e. width/height) versus 'cell area' (parameters applied on cells on BF) (Figure 1). Single cells included in the region of interest with a standard area and aspect ratio close to 1 are then discriminated from multicellular events (large area and small aspect ratio) and debris (extremely small area).\nTo select cells in the focused plane, use a biparametric dot plot adapted for highly contrasted CNTs-labeled cells: plot the 'contrast' versus the 'RMS gradient' (which measures the sharpness quality of an image) on the BF image - it allows the exclusion of unfocused cells showing both a low rms gradient and a low contrast in their BF images (Figure 1).\nDetermine the parameter which provides the best statistical separation between labeled and nonlabeled cells by using the \"find the best feature\". In our study, the mean pixel object feature is the parameter which is the most suitable (Figure 2).\nTrace an histogram using this parameter versus the normalized frequency to compare the quantity of uptaken-CNTs for tested concentrations (Figure 3).\nTrace the biparametric graph 'mean pixel object on BF' (Notation: Mean Pixel_Object (M01,Ch01,Tight)_Ch01) versus 'intensity on DF'(Intensity_MC_Ch06), in order to study the correlation between these two parameters (Figure 4).\nThe quantification is also assessed by means of masks:",
    "As CNTs appears as strongly absorbing dark spots on BF, create first a threshold mask that fit them precisely by selecting a restricted range of pixels with a low intensity comprised between 0-533 in this study (Mask 1, notation: Intensity(M01, BF, 0-533)) (Figure 5). The choice of the threshold intensity is made on labeled cells in comparison to the control cells.\nConversely create also a mask fitting with the pixels of high intensity (150-4095 in this case) of the DF (Mask 2, notation: Intensity (M06, DF, 150-4095)) (Figure 6).\nPlot a graph using the area of the mask (either 1 or 2; (notation: Area_Intensity(M01, BF, 0-533)for mask 1): it will provide a relative quantification of the internalization of CNTs at different concentrations (Figure 7).\nCheck the degree of correlation between these two masks (thanks to the biparametric plot 'area of Mask 1' versus 'area of Mask 2') (Figure 7).\nCreate other masks to localize CNTs in cells:\n\t\nA mask fitting the interior of the cell: Erode(M01, 7) - corresponding to the mask of the entire cell (M01) (Figure 8), which is further eroded of 7 pixels (Figure 9).\nA mask fitting the membrane only using the Boolean equation: M01 and not Erode(M01,7) - mask of the entire cell (M01) subtracted from the interior (Erode(M01,7)) (Figure 10).\nTo consider the dark pixels on the membrane (corresponding to CNTs), create then the mask: Intensity(M01 and not Erode(M01, 7), BF, 0-533) (Figure 11).\nVisualize the different masks applied on a collection of cells to check their relevance (Figure 12) for labeled and unlabeled cells.\nApply the feature area on the mask selecting the black pixels on the membrane 'Area_Intensity(M01 and not Erode(M01, 7), BF, 0-533)' so called black area. It will allow the quantification of the CNTs on the membrane.",
    "To discriminate finally CNTs that have been internalized from those adsorbed only on the membrane, plot the black area on the membrane versus the black area on the entire cell (i.e. 'Area_ Intensity(M01 and not Erode(M01, 7), BF, 0-533' versus 'Area_ Intensity(M01, BF, 0-533)'). \nNote: The same type of procedure is applied with the FITC-fluorescent signal: compare the increase of the intensity of FITC fluorescence versus the decrease of the mean pixel signal on the BF, or the colocalization between dark spots on BF and FITC fluorescence intensity. In our case, this type of analysis is not relevant because fluorescence signal does not correctly match with dark spots on BF on one hand and with bright field on DF on the other hand, showing that intrinsic properties of CNTs (light absorbance and scattering) are more appropriate than the signal related to the fluorescence probe.\nOnce all plots are created on one experimental condition create a \"statistical report template\", save template as .ast file and batch all data files."
