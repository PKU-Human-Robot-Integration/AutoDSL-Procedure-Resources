Follow the manufacturers transfection protocol[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0014337_expicho_expression_system_UG.pdf]. The harvest steps onward are the same for the CHO cell line.\nPrepare DNA/transfection reagent complex: dilute 2.25 mL of Turbo 293 transfection reagent into 37.5 mL of Opti-MEM I medium in a 125 mL flask, gently swirl to mix. Incubate at room temperature (20°C–23°C) for 5 min.\nAlternatives: A 125 mL flask is optional; any sterile container of adequate volume will work.\nMeanwhile, dilute 750 μg of spike DNA into 37.5 mL of Opit-MEM I Medium in the funnel of a sterile filter top, attached to a 50 mL tube.\nNote: If DNA is already sterile filtered, then there is no need to filter at this step. Simply add DNA to Opti-MEM I Medium.\nAdd diluted DNA to Turbo 293 complex by pouring gently down the side of the flask wall, mix gently by swirling and incubate at room temperature (20°C–23°C) for 15 min to allow the formation of DNA-Turbo 293 complex.\nAdd DNA-Turbo 293 complex, made in step 4, to the 800 mL of cell culture made in step 1, by tilting the cell culture flask at approximately 45 degrees and gently pour the DNA-Turbo 293 complex into the cell culture flask, gently swirl to mix. Leave the flask at room temperature (20°C–23°C) to incubate for 15 min.\nReturn the flask to incubate at 37°C, 9% CO2, 120 rpm, for 16–18 h.",
    "Adding enhancer to transfection\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section details step-by-step procedure of adding enhancer to cell culture, 16–18 h post-transfection.\nWarm FreeStyle 293F Medium in 37°C water bath until warm, approximately 45 min to 1 h.\nPlace Hyclone SFM4HEK293 medium at room temperature (20°C–23°C), for approximately 45 min to 1 h.\nNote: The Hyclone SFM4HEK293 liquid medium is a protein-free, phenol red-free, animal-derived component-free cell culture medium that contains L-glutamine, poloxamer 188, and sodium bicarbonate. This enhancer is optimized to support cell growth and high recombinant protein expression in HEK 293 cells.\nAdd 80 mL Hyclone Medium to cell culture flask, swirl gently to mix.\nAdd Freestyle 293F medium to cell culture flask until volume reaches 1 L, swirl gently to mix.\nReturn to incubator at 37°C, 9% CO2, 120 rpm, for 5 more days.\nHarvesting cell culture supernatant & preparation for purification\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis section details a step-by-step procedure for harvesting the cell culture supernatant and preparing for purification.\nDivide 1 L cell culture into two 500 mL conical tubes and centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 30 min at 22°C.\nFilter supernatant with 0.20 μM 1 L complete filtration unit.\nNote: If the flow of the supernatant through the filter slows down or stops, replace it with a new filter top and continue.\nDiscard the water that was left on the Vivaflow 200 membrane (see “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] – prepare Vivaflow concentrator[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]” step) and discard waste.\nPlace both the input and output tubing with a new sterile aspiration pipette into the 1 L filtered supernatant (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1878-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Vivaflow concentration step setup\nCartoon representation of Vivaflow 200 setup with peristaltic pump.\nPlace filtrate line into a sterile 1 L bottle.",
    "Concentrate filtered supernatant with Vivaflow 200, 100K molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) device until concentrate volume is around 100 mL. By increasing the speed of peristaltic pump to a setting of 5 or a speed setting that keeps the pressure gauge at a maximum of 3 bar.\nNote: By concentrating the supernatant anything smaller than 100 K will be filtered out into the filtrate bottle, leaving behind anything at or above 100 K molecular weight.\nLower the speed and rinse the membrane with approximately 20–50 mL of filtrate and empty concentrator.\nOptional: Vivaflow 200 can be reused up to 10 times if properly cleaned in between purification. Detailed cleaning method outlined in troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nAffinity purification using strep-tactin chromatography\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThese steps describe purification by affinity of Twin-Strep-tag fusion proteins to Strep-tactin resin.\nAdd concentrated supernatant to previously prepared Strep-tactin gravity flow column, collect filtrate.\nFlow rate of gravity flow column will depend on length of silicone tubing attached to column stopper; we use an average tubing length of 20 inches with the column stopper fully open.\nNote: If using a funnel attached to a gravity flow column, be cautious when pouring buffers, ensure the column is securely attached.\nNote: Clean the funnel thoroughly between purifications with soap and water, rinse three times with Milli-Q water.\nWash column by pouring 30 mL Buffer W at a time and collecting fractions of approximately 30 mL.\nContinue washing and collecting 30 mL fractions until absorbance at 280 nm wavelength reads 0 on UV-VIS spectrophotometer.\nElute bound protein by pouring 40 mL Buffer E at a time and collecting fractions of approximately 40 mL.",
    "Continue pouring elution buffer on the column and collecting 40 mL fractions until absorbance at 280 nm wavelength reads 0 on UV-VIS spectrophotometer and characteristic spike denaturation profile is no longer observed with Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1878-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Adapted from NanoTemper Technologies.\n(C) S-GSAS-Omicron-BA.1 S protein DSF First derivative ratio measurements of Strep-tactin elution fractions with inflection temperature (Ti) measurements shown by dotted line from final concentrated sample overlaid. Elution fraction 9, no longer follows characteristic DSF S protein profile and is thus excluded from elution fraction concentration.\n(D) Characteristic S protein DSF thermostability example.\nOptional: Strep-tactin resin can be regenerated and used up to 10 times. Follow the manufacturers protocol[href=https://www.iba-lifesciences.com/media/a8/ef/82/1655821040/Protocol%20Strep-Tactin_Column_Purification.pdf] for regeneration.\nIdentification of low-level S protein by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)\nTiming: 3–10 min\nThese steps will enable detection of low levels of S protein in elution fractions and facilitate complete elution of S protein from the column by continuing to elute until there is no longer a recognizable S protein DSF profile (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C shows first derivative profiles for S-GSAS-Omicron-BA.1, fractions 1–8 were collected for concentration. Fraction 9 shown in cyan, no longer showed the typical spike profile. Fractions 4–9 had an absorbance of 0.00 at 280 nm, highlighting the utility of DSF measurements in detecting low amounts of S protein. This method is particularly valuable when working with engineered or natural variants with low expression yields.",
    "Thermal stability measurements were performed using Tycho NT. 6 (NanoTemper Technologies). Changes in the intrinsic fluorescence from the tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the protein was measured as a thermal ramp was applied. Fluorescence was measured at both 350 nm and 330 nm as a temperature ramp from 35°C–95°C at a rate of 30°C/min was applied (NanoTemper Technologies). The inflection temperatures (Ti) indicated unfolding transitions. The S protein exhibited a unique unfolding event with three characteristic Ti’s (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPerform DSF assays with Tycho NT. 6 (NanoTemper Technologies), checking all elution fractions for typical spike profile (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPlace capillary into 10 μL of elution fraction sample, allowing the protein solution to rise in the capillary.\nThen securely place capillary in slot, close holder and start the measurement.\nNote: For low-producing proteins continue eluting until the spike profile is no longer present. For example, in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C fraction 9 no longer shows the characteristic spike DSF profile. Therefore, based on the DSF read-outs, for this purification fractions 1–8 were collected for downstream steps.\nConcentration of S protein elution fractions from strep-tactin affinity chromatography\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIdentify elution fractions with absorbance at 280 nm above 0.00, or with characteristic spike DSF profile.\nConcentrate using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal concentrator with a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) at 22°C following the manufacturer’s instructions[href=http://instructions], until sample volume is ready to inject on SEC column.\nNote: For Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column, sample injection volume max is 500 μL. If sample concentration is above ∼5 mg/mL do not concentrate to 500 μL, split sample into multiple SEC runs and combine peak fractions.\nSize exclusion chromatography of S protein\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nInject 500 μL sample with Hamilton syringe on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column.",
    "Note: Recommended flow rate at room temperature (20°C–23°C) is 0.50 mL/min.\nConcentrate the peak fractions (Figure 4A[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal concentrators with a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) at 22°C following the manufacturer’s instructions[href=http://instructions], until final sample is at a desired concentration.\nPrepare single-use aliquots, flash freeze with LN2, then store at –80°C.\nCritical: When a frozen sample of the purified spike is needed, thaw the aliquot at 37°C for ∼20 min (Edwards et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Then keep the sample at 22°C while working.\nQuality control\nTiming: ∼1–1.5 h\nThese steps outline measures to ensure the quality of S protein.\nDSF of freshly purified S protein\nTiming: ∼5–10 min\nOn the same day as purification using the final sample that has never been frozen, prepare three 10 μL aliquots at 0.1 mg/mL.\nNote: This is the optimal concentration required for adequate response.\nRun triplicates on NanoTemper Tycho.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1878_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1878_6.csv\nNote: Technical replicates data shown in Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nPause point: Samples can be flash-frozen in LN2 and stored at −80°C, for several months, but it is critical to perform QC of the sample by running SDS-PAGE before using protein for experiments.\nSDS-PAGE analysis of purified S protein\nTiming: ∼1–1.5 h\nPrepare reduced and non-reduced samples with 3 μg of protein in each sample.\nReduced samples: 3 μg sample, 2.5 μL 4× Laemmli sample buffer, 3 μL 1 M DTT, and bring volume to 10 μL with gel filtration buffer.\nNon-reduced samples: 3 μg sample, 2.5 μL 4× Laemmli sample buffer, and bring volume to 10 μL with gel filtration buffer.\nPlace NuPage 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel, with sticker pulled off, in the Invitrogen Mini Gel Tank, following the manufacturers detailed procedure[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/bolt_mini_gel_tank_qrc.pdf].",
    "Using 1× NuPAGE MES SDS Running Buffer fill to the fill line of the mini gel tank.\nThe total volume in the gel chamber for one side is 400 mL.\nRemove the comb and load 10 μL of sample in each well.\nRun gel at 200 V for roughly 30 min in the Invitrogen Mini Gel Tank until bands reach the bottom of the gel.\nNote: Voltage may need to be lowered if running multiple gels at the same time.\nStain with Coomassie blue for 20 min.\nDe-stain with DI water until bands are prominent.\nNote: We also QC our purified spike samples by negative stain EM (NSEM) analysis.
