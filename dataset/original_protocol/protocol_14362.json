    "The protocol follows the institutional guidelines of the human research ethics committee.\n1. Pre-selection of the Patient\nIdentify patients with dilation of the sinuses of Valsalva not exceeding 60 mm using the pre-operative computer tomography (CT) scan.\nNext, select among these patients a subgroup with normal or near-normal appearing aortic valve cusps on their pre-operative echocardiography.\nInform the staff of the possibility of a valve sparing aortic root replacement procedure.\nMake the final decision intra-operatively after inspection of the aortic valve. Verify the absence of calcifications of the cusps and/or thickening and retraction of their free margin.\n2. Preparation for Surgery\nNOTE: Preparation for surgery follows the institutional guidelines and recommendations for adult cardiac surgery patients.\nPrepare the surgical suite and patient for surgery as previously described13.\n3. Surgery\nAccess to the heart through a median sternotomy, as previously described13 (Figure 1A).\nPrepare the aortic root for replacement.\nGrab the ascending aorta at the sino-tubular junction with Carpentier dissection forceps. Make a horizontal opening with a #11-blade knife.\nComplete the aortotomy circumferentially and horizontally with Metzenbaum scissors.\nAfter having transected the aorta, verify the absence of calcifications of the cusps and/or thickening and retraction of their free margin. Check the coronary ostia.\nDissect free from the surrounding tissue the outer aspect of the non-coronary sinus down to the roof of the left atrium.\nDetach the right coronary ostium from the aortic wall with a generous circular patch, leaving 5 mm of the aortic wall remnant attached to the insertion of the cusp (Figure 1B).\nFree the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary sinus from the surrounding tissue.\nDissect free the outer aspect of the aortic wall remnant of the right coronary sinus from the outflow tract of the right ventricle.",
    "Free the outer aspect of the commissure between the non-coronary and left coronary sinus down to the roof of the left atrium.\nExcise the aortic wall of the non-coronary sinus leaving 5 mm of the aortic wall remnant attached to the insertion of the cusp.\nSeparate the outer aspect of the commissure between the right and left coronary sinus from the surrounding tissue. Take care not to injure the pulmonary artery.\nDetach the left coronary ostium from the aortic wall with a generous circular patch, leaving 5 mm of the aortic wall remnant attached to the insertion of the cusp (Figure 1B). Mobilize the left main coronary artery over its first 10 mm.\nDissect free the outer aspect of the aortic wall remnant of the left coronary sinus from the roof of the left atrium.\nPut a mattress 4/0 polypropylene stay suture on top of each commissure.\nStart the proximal implantation of the prosthesis.\nPerform the first row of the proximal anastomosis by 12 mattress non-pledgeted 2/0 braided polyester sutures. Put these sutures circumferentially in a horizontal plane 1 - 2 mm below the insertion of the cusps and at the base of the commissural triangles except for the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary sinus (Figure 2A).\nPut the first mattress suture at the base of the commissural triangle between the non-coronary and left coronary sinus. Put the second and third sutures 1 - 2 mm below the insertion of the non-coronary cusp, in the direction of the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary sinus.",
    "Place the forth suture next to the third one in the direction of the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary sinus by avoiding the base of the commissural triangle between the non-coronary and right coronary sinus and thus not compromising the membranous septum.\nStart the first suture of the right coronary sinus 2 mm away from the base of the commissural triangle of the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary sinus, thus skipping the membranous septum (Figure 2B).\nPut the following sutures of the right coronary sinus in the direction of the commissure between the left and right coronary sinus.\nPlace the forth suture of the right coronary sinus at the base of the commissural triangle of the commissure between the left and right coronary sinus.\nNext, pass 4 equidistant mattress sutures 1 - 2 mm below the insertion of the left coronary cusp for fixation of the left coronary sinus.\nTo choose the size of the prosthesis, add 4 to 6 mm to the size of a commercially available biological valve sizer which passes comfortably through the left ventricular-aortic valve junction.\nDetermine the commissural height between the commissural stay suture and the mattress suture at the basis of the commissural triangle. To adjust the commissural heights of the patient to the pre-shaped sinuses of the prosthesis, pass the 4/0 polypropylene commissural stay sutures inside-outside of the prosthesis in the vicinity of its sino-tubular junction.",
    "Be aware that the height of the commissure between the left and right coronary sinus is often slightly less than that of the other two. Trim circumferentially the lower neck of the prosthesis 2 mm below the measured commissural height to adapt the height of the sinuses of the prosthesis to that of the commissures and to be able to pass the first row of the mattress sutures through the prosthesis.\nNow pass the mattress sutures inside-out into the prosthesis. Slide down the prosthesis thus placing the valve inside it (Figure 3A). Tie the mattress sutures gently and cut them.\nStart the second row of the proximal anastomosis by three 5/0 polypropylene running sutures, one for each sinus.\nBegin the first 5/0 polypropylene running suture at the nadir of the left coronary sinus to fix the remnant of the aortic wall inside the prosthesis by following in parallel the insertion of the cusp up to the commissure between the left and right coronary and then up to the commissure between the left and non-coronary sinus. Put the 2 ends under slight tension.\nContinue with the second 5/0 polypropylene running suture at the nadir of the right coronary sinus to fix the remnant of the aortic wall inside the prosthesis by following in parallel the insertion of the cusp up to the commissure between the right and left coronary and then up to the commissure between the right and non-coronary sinus. Put the 2 ends under slight tension.\nPlace the third 5/0 polypropylene running suture at the nadir of the non-coronary sinus to fix the remnant of the aortic wall inside the prosthesis by following in parallel the insertion of the cusp up to the commissure between the non-coronary and left coronary sinus.",
    "Finish the second row of the proximal anastomosis by fixing the remnant of the aortic wall in parallel to the insertion of the cusp up to the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary sinus. Tie at each commissure the two suture-ends together (Figure 3B).\nCheck the absence of aortic regurgitation by filling the prosthesis with saline and applying suction to the vent placed through the right pulmonary vein and the mitral valve into the left ventricle.\nReconnect the coronary ostia to the prosthesis (Figure 4).\nCreate a button hole in the left sinus of the prosthesis adjusted to the size of the left coronary ostium patch.\nBegin the anastomosis at the nadir of the button hole in the prosthesis from inside out and to the left coronary ostium from outside in by a 6/0 polypropylene running suture.\nPlace the second stitch 2 mm to the right of the first one from inside out of the prosthesis and outside in of the left coronary ostium up to the mid-height of the right ridge of the anastomosis. Put the suture end under light tension.\nContinue the running suture on the left ridge of the anastomosis from outside in the prosthesis and from inside out of the left coronary ostium to meet the other end. Tie the two ends together.\nCreate a button hole in the right sinus of the prosthesis adjusted to the size of the right coronary ostium patch.\nConnect the right coronary ostium to the prosthesis by a 6/0 polypropylene running suture, starting at the nadir of the right coronary ostium from inside out and into the prosthesis from outside in.\nContinue the suture to the mid-height of the right ridge of the anastomosis and put the end under light tension.",
    "Complete the anastomosis by running the left ridge of the anastomosis to meet the other end. Tie the two ends together.\nPerform the distal anastomosis (Figure 4).\nStart the anastomosis at the nadir of the distal end of the prosthesis from inside out and into the distal ascending aorta from outside in by a 5/0 polypropylene running suture. Run up the suture first to the mid-height of the right ridge of the anastomosis.\nComplete the distal anastomosis by running the suture on the left ridge to meet the other end. Tie the ends together.\nTilt the operating table in the Trendelenburg position. Let the pump flow reduce to 50% of the full flow and slowly remove the aortic cross-clamp under gentle aspiration of the left ventricular vent.\nResume the full flow of the cardio-pulmonary bypass. Check the operative field for undue surgical bleeding.\nRewarm the patient to 37 Â°C and separate the patient from the cardio-pulmonary bypass. Stabilize blood pressure, neutralize heparin by protamine infused IV in a 1:1 ratio (3 mg/kg corresponding to 300 U/kg of heparin).\nCheck for hemostasis and put the chest drainage as needed. Close the chest in standard fashion by reapproximating the sternum with sternal wires and the soft tissue with absorbable sutures in two layers13.\n4. Post-operative Patient Care\nFollowing the transfer to the intensive care unit, provide the patient with standard post-operative care for cardiac surgical operation on aortic root13.\nSubscription Required.
