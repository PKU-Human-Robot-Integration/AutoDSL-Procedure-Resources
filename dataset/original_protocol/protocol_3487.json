In a 500 μL Eppendorf tube, add 100 μL medium in the tube.\nDissect fly ovaries and collect stage 10 egg chambers. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nDissect up to 6 flies, pull the ovaries out, and remove the surrounding tissues. Carefully pull out the ovarioles from the muscle sheath and remove the late stage egg chambers (stage 12–14).\nTransfer the egg chambers to the Eppendorf tube with medium and wash the egg chambers with 200 μL dissecting medium twice.\nIn a new 200 μL Eppendorf tube, add 4 μL insulin solution to 196 μL dissecting medium. Remove the wash medium in the 500 μL Eppendorf tube and add 200 μL medium with insulin to it.\nNote: Use fresh medium (less than one month) for live imaging.\nNote: Use ovaries from well-fattened females (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) to ensure egg chamber health.\nNote: To identify different stage egg chambers using a dissecting microscope, we focus on the overall size of the egg chamber and the relative volume of the oocyte (yolk) as a proportion of the whole egg chamber. Generally, yolk accumulates in the oocyte from stage 7. Stage 8 egg chambers are typically 200 μm long. By stage 9, the oocyte occupies ∼1/3 the volume of whole egg chamber volume and ½ by stage 10. During stage 11, the nurse cells transfer the majority of their cytoplasmic contents into the oocyte so that at stage 12, the oocyte occupies the majority of the egg chamber volume. The dorsal appendages become visible in stage 13 and fully elongate in stage 14 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nSample mounting",
    "Timing: 5 min\nSamples are carefully mounted to the dish for live imaging.\nUse the handle of forceps to break one 22 × 22 mm coverslip to two equal pieces by pushing hard in the center of the coverslip on a hard surface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Add two small drops of medium on the dish and carefully place the coverslip pieces on the Lumox dish (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/375-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sample mounting\n(A) Break one 22 × 22 mm coverslip into two equal pieces as shown on the left.\n(B) Add two small drops of medium onto the dish.\n(C) Carefully place the coverslip pieces on the Lumox dish.\n(D) Transfer samples in 90 μL medium to the center of the two coverslip pieces.\n(E) Cover the sample with a 22 × 40 mm coverslip.\n(F) Carefully wick away the excess medium with a tissue.\n(G) Add small droplets of halocarbon oil 27 carefully to the rims of coverslip. Yellow circles show the positions to add oil.\n(H) Let the oil spread to seal the coverslip.\nTransfer samples in 90 μL medium to the center of two coverslip pieces (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Then cover the sample with a 22 × 40 mm coverslip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Remove the excessive medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nAdd small droplets (less than 50 μL) of halocarbon oil 27 carefully to the rims of coverslip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G) and let them spread to all the sides (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nCritical: Be sure the coverslip pieces do not have any small glass fragments, which can lead to uneven mounting. Mounting should avoid bubbles and too much medium/halocarbon oil, which can cause the egg chambers to shift during imaging.\nImaging acquisition setup and live imaging\nTiming: 30–45 min",
    "Mount the Lumox dish to the microscope stage. On the Zeiss 780 microscope, mount the Lumox dish onto the motorized stage with temperature control module. Cover with the lip of temperature control module. Then close the image air chamber.\nNote: We suggest changing the normal stage to motorized stage with temperature control module before opening the Zen software.\nNote: We image the control group first.\nOpen temperature control module and set the temperature to 23°C. On Zeiss 780 microscope, open Zen software, select “temperature” control module and set the temperature to 23°C.\nSwitch to 20× objective lens. On Zeiss 780 microscope, select “Position” in the “Acquisition” mode then switch to “Locate” mode.\nSelect stage 10 egg chambers. On Zeiss 780 microscope, click “GFP” filter. Use microscope eyepiece to adjust focal plane and select stage 10 egg chambers by clicking “Add” in the “position” box. Select up to 10 egg chambers.\nNote: We describe the details for the Zeiss 780 confocal microscope and associated Zen software. Laser power, “gain,” and other details will vary for different manufacturers so some empirical parameter determinations will be necessary.\nNote: To image stage 10A egg chambers, we select those in which border cells contact the oocyte but are not yet in contact with centripetal cells.\nAdjust the 488 nm laser parameters. On the Zeiss 780 microscope, switch back to “Acquisition” mode and set up imaging parameters. Use a 488 nm argon laser for excitation and acquire GFP images using channel 1 (500–550 nm). Adjust the laser power (2% laser power in our experiment) and the pinhole size (2 Airy units in our experiment). Channel gains should be lower than 800.",
    "Adjust imaging parameters. On Zeiss 780 microscope, use frame size “512 × 512” pixels. Use averaging to 8 times for maximum signal-to-noise ratio. Use maximum speed.\nMove to the first egg chamber. On Zeiss 780 microscope, click “Move to” in the “Position” box to move the position to the first egg chamber. Click “Live,” adjust focus to the mid-plane of the border cells. Rotate crop box to make the egg chamber posterior side facing right side. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nAcquire single section image in 23°C. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nMove to the next egg chamber and repeat steps 12 and 13. On Zeiss 780 microscope, click “Move to” in the “Position” box to move the position to the next egg chamber.\nNote: To best image the border cells, carefully adjust the focus and acquire the images one by one manually.\nNote: If the orientation of the egg chamber happens to be with the dorsal side closest to the objective lens, the border cells will be closer as well and the signal will be stronger. It is not possible to control egg chamber orientation, and this assessment can only be made by focusing up and down to determine the position of the border cell cluster relative to the objective.\nAfter imaging all egg chambers at 23°C, return to the position of the first egg chamber. Set the temperature in the “temperature” module to 32°C. Wait for the air temperature to stabilize at 32°C. In our experiments, it typically takes 10 min.\nRepeat steps 12–14 to acquire the same single section image in 32°C.\nCritical: Use the lowest laser power and exposure time that allow visualization of the sample. Exposing the egg chamber too long or using high laser power can cause photobleaching. Do not use too high channel gains which can induce strong background.",
    "Image analysis\nTiming: 30 min\nRemove image background.\nOpen the image in FIJI.\nMeasure background in a nurse cell region using a “Rectangular selection” box without selecting the follicle cells\nUse “Analyze->Histogram” to obtain the background mean and standard deviation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/375-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Data analysis\n(A) Use FIJI to remove image background.\n(B) Use FIJI to generate mask image.\n(C) Use FIJI to generate adjusted image.\n(D) Choose pseudo color and adjust image for display.\n(E) Use the adjusted image to measure the intensity in follicle cells.\n(F) Examples show GCaMP signal in control and TrpA1 egg chambers.\n(G) Quantification of the level of GCaMP6s in thermogenetics experiments in follicle cells (fc). ∗∗p < 0.01, unpaired Student’s t test (two-tailed).\nCalculate background value as “mean+3 × StdDev.” Select the entire image. Subtract background value using “Process->Math->Subtract” function.\nSave the image as “file name_remove background”\nGenerate mask image.\nUse “Image->Duplicate” function to duplicate the image.\nIn the duplicated image, use “Image->Adjust->Threshold” to create binary mask. Choose “Dark background” to select the bright signal. Use the default algorithm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nUse “Process->Math->Divide” to divide mask by 255 to create a 0/1 binary mask image.\nSave the mask as “file name_mask”\nGenerate adjusted image and display.\nMultiply the mask with image using “Process->Image Calculator” to obtain a new image. Save the image as “file name_remove background_masked” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nUse “Image->Duplicate” function to duplicate the image.\nIn the duplicated image, use “Image->Lookup Tables” to change the lookup table which can visualize the dynamic range in different color coding. In our experiment, we used “16 colors” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nUse “Image->Adjust->Brightness/Contrast,” adjust the brightness/contrast to best capture the dynamic range of the image.\nSave the 32-bit image in tiff format. Convert image to RGB image and save for display.",
    "Note: The display image will NOT change the actual value of each pixel.\nUse the “file name_remove background_masked” to measure the intensity in follicle cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nUse “Freehand selections” function to select the ROIs of follicle cell.\nUse “Analyze->Measure” function to measure the intensity.\nExport the data and use the “Mean” intensity for further analysis.\nSummarize and plot the result.\nChanges in GCaMP6s intensity are calculated and expressed as ΔF/F0. ΔF= F1-F0, F1 is the GCaMP6s intensity after temperature shift to 32°C for 10 min, F0 is the GCaMP6s intensity in 23°C before temperature shift.\nImport ΔF in control and experimental group in Prism 6 GraphPad. Plot the data and perform statistical analysis (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3G)."
