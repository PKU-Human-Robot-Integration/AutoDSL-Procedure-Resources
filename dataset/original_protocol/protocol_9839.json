    "1. System Design Principles\nNOTE: This section presents the design principles used to create systems for US exposure and cavitation monitoring. These principles are illustrated with two existing systems for acoustic transfection (SAT) (shown in Figure 1). Each system consists of a cell exposure compartment, an US source, and a single element transducer functioning as a passive cavitation detector (PCD), all of which are integrated into a benchtop test chamber. These designs build upon the prior system development described in Carugo et al. (2015)65.\nMaximize ease of use.\n\t\nMake the cell exposure compartment compatible with existing culture techniques and imaging systems by using existing commercial cell culture devices as seeding/growth substrates.\n\t\t\nFor SAT2, use a culture dish (35 mm diameter, of which a 21 mm diameter area is observable, see Table of Materials).\nFor SAT3, use a Transwell insert (6.5 mm diameter, see Table of Materials). The Transwells have a permeable membrane and hence need to be placed in cell media rather than water.\nEnable rapid loading and sealing of the cell exposure compartment.\n\t\nForm the SAT2 cell exposure compartment by press fitting a flexible polymer lid over the culture dish (Carugo et al. 201565). As seen in Figure 1C, the lid has a pair of 1.2 mm diameter holes that allow filling the compartment with an 18 G blunt needle syringe. After filling, seal these filling ports with short plastic rods (Table of Materials).\nFill the SAT3 compartment by syringe or pipette and seal by press fitting a rubber stopper/bung.",
    "Enable rapid loading of the sealed cell exposure compartment into the test chamber. Holders for the cell exposure compartments were built into the chamber lids, where a light press-fit is sufficient to ensure proper alignment. With the systems shown in Figure 1, the time for sample changes can be as short as 20 seconds when multiple cell exposure compartments have been prepared in advance.\nMinimize the chamber internal volume so that the system is portable and the amount of required water/media can be minimized. Doing so also accelerates recovery from accidental spills or leaks of cavitation agents out of the cell exposure compartment.\n\t\tNOTE: The SAT2 internal volume is approximately 0.8 L. The SAT3 internal volume is approximately 7.6 L – made larger to accommodate easy loading and change of source transducer or its configuration. An internal chamber of 0.3 L was added to minimize the disposable volume and to allow biologically relevant fluids other than the tank fill water (e.g., cell culture media) to be used. The internal chamber bottom is made from 30 μm thick mylar sheet to allow maximum acoustic transmission.\nMake the chamber and the internal components out of optically clear materials when possible, so that any problems (e.g., leaks, entrapped macrobubbles) can be quickly observed and remedied.\nMaximize acoustic transmissibility of the exposure compartment.\n\t\nMaximize transmissibility through the choices of compartment wall materials and thicknesses. Under the assumption that the liquids on either side of a wall are essentially the same (e.g., water), the magnitude of the normal incidence pressure transmission coefficient71 is:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61989/61989equ01.jpg, where λ is the wavelength in the wall of thickness L, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61989/61989equ02.jpg, and zL and zo are the characteristic impedances (products of density and sound speed) for the wall material and liquid, respectively. T = 1 indicates perfect transmission.",
    "For broad spectrum monitoring of cavitation (e.g., 1-8 MHz), most laboratory polymers (e.g., PDMS, PTFE, polystyrene) will alter the transmitted pressure by no more than 10% if the thickness of material is less than 1/10th of a wavelength in the material. This condition can be difficult to meet with standard supplies at high frequencies (e.g., #1.5 coverslip at 8 MHz), so it is good practice to predict or directly calibrate the transmission frequency response.\nFor narrow band transmission of the US source signal into the cell exposure compartment, allow a thicker layer if it is approximately an integer multiple of a half wavelength in the layer material. For example, the PDMS lid in SAT2 is used at a thickness of 2.0 mm (~2 wavelength at 1MHz, cPDMS ~ 1000 m/s).\nMaximize the exposure region through selection of source and cell environment.\n\t\nTo maximize the number of exposed cells, make the area of cell attachment as broad as possible while maintaining compatibility with available culturing and imaging equipment.\nUse an US source with a field that spans the cell attachment area with minimal spatial variability by using the pre-focal region of a large focused source (SAT2) or a focused or lensed source with a main lobe width that matches the diameter of the cell attachment area (SAT3). See the Table of Materials for specific sources.\nMinimize the field complexity introduced by the cell compartment holder by mechanically supporting the cell compartment well away from the strongest part of the incident field, minimizing the scattering cross section of the holder or placing absorbing material on the holder. Examples are shown in Figure 1A and 1D.\nEnsure repeatable exposure conditions.",
    "Terminate the acoustic field in a fixed boundary to eliminate variability that can arise from air-water interfaces in partially filled chambers. In SAT2 and 3, this is accomplished by installing an acoustic absorber (see Table of Materials) on the chamber lid with a further benefit of reducing the field complexity that may arise from boundary reflections.\nMonitor and record the source drive voltage at the amplifier output/source input so that minor variability or major malfunction can be detected quickly. Use a voltage probe or other device that is safe to use over the drive voltage range of interest. Periodically check the calibration of the voltage probe using a well-known source such as a waveform generator.\nControl, monitor, and record the temperature of the chamber and its contents. Responses of cells, transducers, and propagation medium may all be temperature sensitive. In SAT2, monitoring and control are accomplished with a pair of circulation ports connected to a water conditioning system, whilst SAT3 employs an aquarium heater (not shown). Set the water temperature as needed to mimic the relevant physiological conditions for the therapeutic application.\n\t\tNOTE:  internal temperatures may change both as a result of external factors and from US-generated heating of the transducer and the medium.\nCarefully degas the chamber liquid(s) to minimize the likelihood of unintended cavitation and/or scattering from pre-existing bubbles in the propagation path.\n\t\tNOTE: if degassing is not carried out, e.g. due to the negative impact on cells, then there will be an enhanced background level of bubble activity, for which suitable.\nCalibrate the fully assembled system.",
    "Include a means of measuring the pressure field incident upon the exposed cells when all system components are in place, including the cell exposure compartment. In SAT2 and 3, this is accomplished with an opening in the chamber lid through which a needle or fiber optic hydrophone could be inserted without disturbing the field to be measured. Make the measurements as close as possible to where the cells are located.\nChoose a hydrophone with a sensitive radius (arcv) is small enough that it will not misreport the pressure field being measured. The acceptable size is a function of source frequency (f) and radius (asrc) as well as the distance between source and the field scan (zrcv). A general criterion for hydrophone size selection is: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61989/61989equ06.jpg, leading to: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61989/61989equ07.jpg, where c is the sound speed72.\nEnsure that the hydrophone is calibrated under the conditions used in system characterization, including the temperature as specified in section 1.6. Specifically, if the hydrophone is held at an angle with respect to the scan plane, the hydrophone must be calibrated at that angle, as directivity effects may differ significantly from those expected based purely on geometry. The change in hydrophone sensitivity with respect to temperature should be available from the manufacturer.\nScan the entire region in which cells may be exposed. To capture an appropriate level of field detail, use a scan spacing no coarser than 1/5th of a wavelength at the highest frequency of interest. If unexpected field complexity is observed, consider using short burst signals (e.g., 1-3 cycles) to allow identification and quantification of direct and scattered field contributions.\nIncorporate a cavitation monitoring capability.",
    "Determine the monitoring transducer type and placement as part of the design of the overall system, rather than as a retrofit. In practice, this leads to a system that is maximally compact without sacrificing the ability to reliably align the critical system components.\nPlace a cavitation monitoring device in the system in such a way that it can be repeatably positioned with minimal added setup time or disturbance to workflow. In SAT2, this is accomplished with a single element piezoelectric transducer acting as a PCD fitted into the chamber lid, whilst SAT3 integrates the PCD into the source base using a 90° reflector.\nSelect the PCD shape according to the objectives of the experiments. In Figure 2, calculations of the half-amplitude contours of unfocused (left) and focused (right) devices show the profound differences in spatial sensitivity with respect to frequency. The unfocused device is better suited for large volume monitoring with modest spatial variation with respect to frequency, while the focused device is better suited for more radially compact measurements at the frequencies of interest.\nSelect the PCD center frequency and bandwidth to fit the needs of the experiment. The center frequency is typically chosen to be at least five times that of the US source in order to minimize sensitivity to direct source emissions. Bandwidth is typically maximized in order to observe a broad range of bubble behaviors (harmonic and broadband noise).\nSelect conditioning, recording, and processing methods to allow analysis of cavitation data, as described in the next section.\n2. Instrumentation and Processing for Cavitation Monitoring\nNOTE: This section presents the signal flow components and functions recommended for collection of cavitation monitoring data, and the data processing that leads to qualitative and quantitative assessments of cavitation activity.\nInstrumentation (See also Figure 3).",
    "Unless the application calls for a customized device, select a PCD from the broad range of commercially available single element transducers, typically marketed for non-destructive testing of submerged targets. These suppliers also have cabling and accessories (e.g., the mirror reflector in SAT3).\nMinimize PCD response to the US source. This may be done both through selection of the PCD (center frequency and bandwidth) and by using a notch or high pass filter. The latter is implementable either as a standalone module or as part of a signal conditioning device.\nUse a digitizer with a large dynamic range (at least 12 bits) to capture as much data as possible with minimal likelihood of high signal clipping and maximal signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the smallest signals. When comparing devices, review the specifications for signal to noise and distortion and/or effective number of bits, as these are more complete descriptions of attainable dynamic range. Also consider whether the size of the memory buffer is sufficient for the desired length and rate of data capture.\nOptimize the use of the digitizer's dynamic range. PCD signals may cover several orders of magnitude, both because of a long exposure (as bubbles are eliminated) and if running experiments at varying US drive levels. It is therefore necessary to check that the signal conditioning chain scales all signals so that they can be properly recorded.\nInclude a preamplifier in the signal chain, so that the smallest expected signals can be adequately captured. In our experience, PCD self-noise is well below that of most digitizers, so a modest degree of preamplification (e.g., <100x) can still improve the SNR of the final result.\nFilter the US source frequency prior to preamplification to avoid saturating the amplifier.",
    "If an US pulser/receiver is used to provide gain and/or filtering capabilities, use it in pulser mode to confirm path length/alignment or check for unexpected scatterers in the propagation path between the PCD and the cell exposure compartment.\nEnable real time streaming of data to storage. The SAT2 and SAT3 systems both employ 12-bit streaming USB oscilloscopes (see Table of Materials), which have the conveniences of portability and well-built user interfaces.\nConfirm proper impedance matching in the signal chain to avoid gain or bandwidth errors. PCD devices typically have output impedances near 50 ohms, so a suitable process is to replace the PCD with a known signal from a waveform generator (with 50 ohm output impedance) and confirm that the signal size appearing on the digitizer matches expectations, scales linearly when the injected signal is changed, and no clipping is observed for the largest signal of interest.\nPre-processing\n\t\nCorrect the raw voltage signals for all known gains and sensitivities in the signal path that relate to processing of data in the frequency range of interest.\nIf the data were recorded with DC input coupling or otherwise show a DC-offset, remove this offset by direct subtraction or with a high pass filter.\nCompute the power spectrum P of each recorded signal.\n\t\nSet the Fourier transform length Nft so that the fundamental frequency of the US source f0 is a large integer multiple of the transform bin width: Nft = nfs/f0, where n is an integer and fs is the sample frequency of the digitized data. Set n ≥ 50 for clear capture of spectral features. For the example of a 1 MHz fundamental sampled at 50 MHz, Nft is 2500 and the bin width is 0.02 MHz.",
    "As the transform length Nft is usually smaller than the duration of recorded signal, use a power spectral density (PSD) estimator such as Welch’s method73. Power in a frequency band spanning f1-f2 is imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61989/61989equ13v2.jpg, where dF is the transform bin width.\nTo characterize bubble activity during each exposure, estimate the contributions to the power spectrum from integer multiples of f0 (harmonics), odd integer multiples of f0/2 (ultraharmonics), and broadband noise (inertial cavitation).\nHarmonic and ultraharmonic content is most simply estimated by selecting the power spectrum values at specific frequencies. However, large amplitude tonal responses may spread into a small number of adjoining frequency bins (e.g. f0 ± 2-3), so these should be included in the narrow band power calculations and excluded from the broadband calculations.\nEstimate broadband band cavitation power by subtraction of the harmonic and ultraharmonic contributions from the total power spectrum. Alternately, these contributions may be estimated using more sophisticated pre-processing74.\nEstimate the cumulative cavitation signal energy over the duration of the exposure, preferably according to spectrum feature / bubble activity type.\nAssuming all data records had equal duration Tr, the cumulative energy in the recorded data is imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61989/61989equ15.jpg, where M indicates the number of records.\nIf there are gaps between recordings, as may happen when the exposure is continuous, and the saved files capture a fraction of the total exposure duration Te, the cumulative energy may be estimated as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61989/61989equ16.jpg\nEstimate the measurement SNR by comparison of spectrum levels with those of background noise recorded in absence of US.\n3. Experimental Protocol\nSAT Preparation",
    "Minimize the likelihood of cavitation in the propagation path by degassing the fill liquid (typically filtered water) under a pressure of -105 Pa for at least two hours. Confirmation with a dissolved oxygen probe that the partial pressure of oxygen is below 10 kPa is recommended.\nFill the test chamber slowly to minimize re-introduction of air into the degassed liquid. Continue degassing the filled chamber if necessary.\nClear all residual bubbles from the transducer and media container surfaces immediately after filling and again just before initiating exposure experiments.\nMake sure the temperature of the chamber and its contents have stabilized before commencing exposure experiments.\nAllow the US source power amplifier to warm up (per manufacturer recommendation) so that the gain and output are stable with respect to time.\nExposure Compartment Preparation\n\t\nCavitation agent suspension\n\t\t\nWhen diluting the cavitation agent, gently and continuously stir to make a uniform suspension without entrapping macrobubbles or destroying the agent (especially if they are shelled bubbles).\nWhen working with MBs, withdraw and dispense slowly using the largest gauge needle available to minimize destruction during the loading process75. An 18 G blunt fill needle has been used regularly with the SAT systems.\nSAT2 Preparation\n\t\nSterilize the PDMS lid before use in experiments with live cells.\nForm the cell exposure compartment by press fitting the PDMS lid to the culture dish.\nPrepare a syringe with an 18 G blunt needle and fill with approximately 10 mL of liquid (e.g., MB suspension or water control).\nInsert the needle through one of the PDMS fill holes and slowly fill the chamber, tilting so that macrobubbles can escape through the open fill hole. For best results, tilt the chamber so that the open hole is above the fill hole.",
    "When filled, close the open hole by inserting a short (4-5 mm) polymer rod. Set the assembly so both holes are horizontal.\nRemove the blunt filling needle while injecting extra fluid so that air is not drawn in. Close the hole with another polymer rod. This process completes the sealing of the cell exposure compartment.\nVisually check the compartment for evidence of entrapped macrobubbles, and if any are found, repeat 3.3.3.-3.3.6.\nPress fit the cell exposure compartment in the compartment holder. Install the chamber lid in place atop the chamber. Lowering the lid with an angle to horizontal discourages macrobubbles from resting on the submerged parts (absorber, holder).\nConsider the buoyancy of the particles in suspension when deciding the orientation of the cell exposure compartment (e.g., floating bubbles or sinking nanoparticles) and how this will affect their contact with cells.\nIn all operations, use as little force as possible to minimize the flexure of the cell growth surface and detachment of cells.\nSAT3 Preparation\n\t\nFill the Transwell with approximately 150 μL of liquid (e.g., MB suspension or water control).\nForm the cell exposure compartment by carefully sealing the transwell with a rubber plug, removing any overflow liquid with a clean paper towel or wipe. Before use in experiments with live cells, sterilize the rubber plug.\nVisually check the compartment for evidence of entrapped macrobubbles, and if any are found, remove the plug, remove the macrobubbles and repeat 4.4.2.\nPress fit the cell exposure compartment in the compartment holder. Install the chamber lid in place atop the chamber. Lowering the lid with an angle to horizontal discourages macrobubbles from resting on the submerged parts (absorber, holder).",
    "NOTE: As noted above, macrobubbles may cause a variety of non-repeatable and potentially detrimental effects on US exposure experiments. Most critically, macrobubbles trapped in the cell exposure compartment may cause PCD responses and local cellular bioeffects that are not representative of the intended treatment. Always visually inspect all system components to find and remove macrobubbles before initiating US experiments.\n4. Data Collection\nEstablish background PCD response levels by conducting initial experiments with a cell exposure compartment filled with control liquid (e.g., degassed water or cell media).\nRecord PCD data without driving the US source to establish background electronic noise levels.\nRecord PCD data while driving the US source at the full range of planned drive levels. This data will indicate what parts of the acoustic response are unrelated to the cavitation agents to be tested subsequently.\n\tNOTE: Common laboratory liquids (e.g., PBS or cell media) will exhibit cavitation at moderate pressures (e.g. 0.5 MPa at 0.5 MHz) if not degassed.\nBefore commencing measurements, give time for the suspension to thermally equilibrate with the chamber temperature. A fine needle thermocouple may be useful for this purpose.\nMonitor the experiments in real time in both the time and frequency domains.\n\t\nTime domain monitoring of the PCD reveals whether signals are sized appropriately for the current instrumentation settings. Specifically, signal clipping is to be avoided, since it will appear in the frequency domain as multi-tone harmonic response.\nTime domain monitoring of the PCD also shows if cavitation signals are seen earlier than expected based on propagation time from the US source to the exposure compartment to the PCD. If such signals are seen, this may indicate leakage of cavitation agent into the test chamber.",
    "Frequency domain monitoring of the PCD indicates the type of bubble behavior and can be used to adjust the drive levels as needed to achieve the desired cell stimulus (e.g., lower drive levels for harmonic excitation).\nTo ensure that the first exposures are not missed, start the data collection process prior to turning on the US source drive signal.\nMonitor the amplifier output signal that drives the US source (as opposed to the waveform generator output) throughout the experiment to ensure that the exposure is proceeding as expected. Use a high voltage probe for this measurement and make sure that the oscilloscope is set to compensate for probe attenuation.\nAfter exposing a sample, carefully remove it from the test chamber.\n\t\nRemove and clean the PDMS lid (SAT2)/rubber plug (SAT3) in preparation for any subsequent use.\nTransfer the culture dish (SAT2)/Transwell (SAT3) as needed for subsequent analysis (e.g., microscopy, fluorescence imaging).\nAfter a small number of exposures (e.g., 3-5), it is good practice to re-acquire baseline cavitation signals (in the absence of cavitation agent) and compare with the original data set to make sure the chamber media have not been contaminated."
