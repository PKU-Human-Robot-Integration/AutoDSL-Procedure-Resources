    "All procedures and personnel were approved by the University of Southern California's Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), protocol #11394.\n1. Baculum Dissection and Preparation\nEuthanize a sexually mature male mouse via carbon dioxide over-exposure, according to protocols set forth by the relevant Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nLay the animal in the supine position, and protract the penis by applying pressure with thumbs lateral to the preputial opening.\nOnce the penis is protracted, extend the tissue through the prepuce as far as possible.\nWith scissors, cut the penile body proximal to the glans penis where the baculum resides.\nTransfer the dissected penis to a 1.7 mL tube and add 200 µL tap water. Make certain that the penis is fully submerged in the liquid.\nIncubate the tissue in water at ~50 °C for 3-5 days.\nAfter proper incubation, remove the surrounding tissue from the baculum, using forceps under a dissection microscope. Gently squirt 70% ethanol to push off remaining tissue and clean the bone.\nPlace the dissected baculum into a new microcentrifuge tube with the cap open. Leave cap open O/N to dry out bone.\n2. MicroCT Scanning\nPress a microCT scan cylindrical holder into a brick of florist foam to create a cylinder of florist foam.\nExtract the cylinder of florist foam and cut slices ~2-5 cm thick.\nPush dried bacula into the florist foam, around the periphery of an individual slice to minimize interference during scanning. The precise orientation of bones should be remarked allowing for proper identification of individual specimens in Protocol 4.\nGently place the slice with the embedded bones into the microCT holder.",
    "Acquire microCT scans. In the case of mouse bacula14, we used a uCT50 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at the USC Molecular Imaging Center under the following settings: 90 kVp, 155 µA, 0.5 mm Al filter, 750 projections per 180 (360 coverage), exposure time of 500 ms, and voxel size of 15.5 mm.\n3. MicroCT Processing: Converting a .DCM Stack to a Single .xyz File\nNOTE: Each microCT scan produces a stack of .DCM, or \"dicom\", files that represent image slices taken through the object. All downstream computational geometry requires flat .xyz files, which is simply a text file that contains four columns – the x, y, and z coordinates of each pixel, and the intensity of the pixel, ranging from -5,000 (black) to +5,000 (white). A pixel threshold above 3,000 generally works well as a threshold for defining bones.\nInstall Python (www.python.org) and the PYTHON modules COMMANDS, DICOM, PYLAB, SYS, and NUMPY.\nOpen \"01_process_dicom.py\"{Figshare} with any text editor. Under the Variables section, change path, pixel thresholds, and directory names as necessary.\nRun \"python 01_process_dicom.py\". Progress will be printed to screen. Within each directory named in step 3.2, a new file is made named; for example, directory_name.PT3000.xyz, where PT3000 indicates the pixel threshold indicated in step 3.2.\n4. MicroCT processing: Segmenting-out Individual Specimen .xyz Files\nInstall R (https://www.r-project.org/) with the library RGL.\nOpen the file '02_segment_dicoms.r'{Figshare} with any text editor. Under the Variables section, change the path name to point to the .xyz file created in Protocol 3 above.\nFrom within R, run the command \"source('02_segment_dicoms.r')\" (without the double quotes).\nAfter the three dimensional image of the .xyz file created in Protocol 3 appears, enter the number of specimens in the overall .xyz file. Then label and select the points from each specimen using the scroll and zoom functions.",
    "NOTE: In the background, separate .xyz files will be made for each specimen. These appear in a directory named, for example, XYZ_FILES_PT3000, where PT3000 indicates the pixel threshold used.\n5. \"Aligning\" Specimen .xyz Files to Common Coordinates.\nOpen the Python script \"03_transform.py\"{Figshare}, which requires the additional module mattdean_modules.py{Figshare}, as well as two self-standing applications: \"rotate_translate_cylindrical\" (https://github.com/timydaley/dean_cylindrical_tranform) and “qconvex” (www.qhull.org/html/qconvex.htm) that are used by this script.\nUnder the Variables section, identify the full path names to mattdean_modules.py, rotate_path and qconvex_dir. In addition, identify the full path to the directory containing the individual .xyz files created in step 4.\nRun 03_transform.py, which creates a new file per specimen with the suffix .TRANSFORMED.xyz.\n6. \"Slicing\" Aligned Specimen .xyz Files to Identify Semi-landmarks.\nOpen and run the Python script \"04_identify_landmarks.py\"{Figshare}. In the Variables section, identify full path names to the directory containing the .TRANSFORMED.xyz files. This script identifies 802 semi-landmarks that can be used to quantify size and shape of the structure.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
