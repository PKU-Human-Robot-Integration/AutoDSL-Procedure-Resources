    "1. Cell Culture Preparation\nUtilize human aortic smooth muscle cells purchased commercially.\nMaintain cells in smooth muscle cell growth media composed of 88.6% 231 media, 0.1% each of recombinant human insulin (rH-insulin), recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (rH-FGF), recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rH-FGF), and ascorbic acid; and 5% each of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and L-glutamine; and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic.\n\tNOTE: Each growth factor, FBS and L-glutamine are purchased as a vascular media growth kit.\nChange media every 48 hours until the cells are about 90% confluent and ready for tissue seeding.\nStore cells in an incubator in between media changes for expansion.\n2. Preparation of 3D Printed Inserts and Custom Silicone Molded Plates\nUse a commercial 3D printer (e.g., Replicator Mini) for 3D printing the plate inserts.\n\t\nUse open source 3D design software such as Blender to create the 3D models of the printed outer-shells and posts.\nExport the model's driver file via a .stl format allowing for portability to the 3D printer's software.\nProduce printed posts and outer shells using poly(lactic acid) filament (PLA) loaded into the 3D printer.\nFollowing printing, perform a 30-minute soak in a 70%-100% ethanol solution to sterilize each insert.\nPrepare a 1:10 curing agent to base polymer mixture of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) silicone polymer and allow the mixture to degas at room temperature for 10 min.\n\t\nDefine petri dish sizes used as small (35 mm), intermediate (60 mm), and large (100 mm).\nAdd 2 mL, 4 mL and 6 mL of uncured silicone to each small, intermediate and large plate, respectively, and create a thin layer across the entire bottom of the petri dish.",
    "Create posts for the small plate by pouring PDMS into a 100 mm plate to a height of 7 mm and allow to cure on a hot plate at 60 °C for about 2-3 hours. Then use a 5 mm biopsy punch to punch out cylindrical posts. Use a small amount of uncured PDMS to secure each PDMS cylinder and to the center of each small plate.\nFor the intermediate and large plates, prior to complete curing of the PDMS at the bottom of the plate, place the 3D printed posts 10 mm and 20 mm in diameter centrally into each intermediate and large plates, respectively. For the large plates, additionally place a 3D printed outer shell about 66.7 mm in diameter equidistance from the post.\n\t\t\nAllow each dish to cure in open air on a hot plate at 60 °C for about 2-3 hours, allowing 18 hours for degassing of the polymer. Fix printed components to the plate in the proper region and orientation as seen in Figure 1.\nAdd a solution of 70% ethanol with 30% distilled water for 30 minutes to the inside of all plates for sterilization and then cover each plate.\nCarefully aspirate the ethanol from each plate and allow to air dry.\nArrange each plate in a biological safety cabinet (BSC) next to its lid, face-up. Expose plates and lids to UV light under the BSC for 30 minutes to complete sterilization. Sterile technique is performed with every step after UV exposure.\n3. Preparation of Fibrin Hydrogel, Seeding with Smooth Muscle Cells and Maintenance of Plates\nMix a solution of fibrin gel containing growth media + 0.01% TGF-β1 in the amounts of 0.5 mL, 1.1 mL and 1.81 mL for small, intermediate and large plate sizes, respectively.",
    "Add 40 µL, 88.4 µL and 145 μL of thrombin, from a stock of 100 U/mL, to the media of each small, intermediate and large plate, respectively. Gently swirl each plate by hand to ensure that thrombin is evenly mixed within the media.\nNext, add 160 µL, 354 µL and 580 μL fibrinogen, from a stock of 20 mg/mL, drop-wise circularly to the thrombin-media mixture to each small, intermediate and large plate, respectively. Gently swirl by hand to ensure mixing and distribution of the hydrogel into an even layer.\nAllow hydrogel to cure for 10-15 minutes at room temperature.\nTrypsinize smooth muscle cells expanded in 150 mm cell culture plates and centrifuge according to standard protocols. The resulting pellet should be resuspended in 3 mL of differentiation media consisting of 98% - 231 media, 1% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic.\n\t\nVigorously mix cells by titrating up and down with a 2 mL pipette to break up any cell clumps. Count cells with a hemocytometer and create a cell suspension of 2 x 106 cells/mL, 1.0 x 107 cells/mL and 1.4 x 107 cells/mL for small, intermediate and large plates, respectively.\nAdd 1 mL of each cell suspension into a corresponding 50 mL conical labelled small, intermediate and large. Set up an additional 50 mL conical in this manner for each additional tissue ring desired.\nAdd differentiation media to each conical to obtain final seeding volumes of 2 mL, 4 mL and 5 mL for each small, intermediate and large vessel, respectively. Then, carefully pipet the cell solution drop-wise on top of the prepared hydrogel in each corresponding plate.\nPlace plates into the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "Change differentiation media every 48-72 hours for each plate. In the case of the larger plate, change media initially after 24 hours, then change it every 48-24 hours to compensate for the large cell seeding density.\n\t\nAfter 2-4 days as the rings will have completely contracted in towards the post, add 10 µL, 20 µL and 35 μL of TGF-β1 to each small, intermediate and large ring, respectively. After exposure to TGF-β1 for at least 24 hours, rings are ready to be handled.\n4. Assembly of Vascular Construct and Maintenance\nBefore the fabrication of the final vascular construct, a specialized container is created to hold the completed vessel.\n\t\nFor the small vessel, create a tall plate for ring stacking by cutting a 2-inch section off the top of a 50 mL polycarbonate conical tube, and then PDMS glue the cut edge into a 35 mm plate. Use the conical lid as the plate lid.\nFor the intermediate and large vessel tall ring stacking plates, cut a 1.75-inch diameter polycarbonate tube into 2.5 inch sections lengthwise to serve as the tall plate walls. For the tall plate bottoms, cut a 0.125-inch-thick polycarbonate sheet into 2-inch diameter circle pieces. Using acrylic solvent cement, bind the polycarbonate tube section to the circular cut piece. Use the lid from a 60 mm petri dish as the lid for the tall plate.\n3D print posts 5, 10 and 20 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length.\nAdd 10 mL of uncured silicone to each container. Prior to the complete curing of the PDMS, centrally place each post created in step 4.1.3 into each small, intermediate, and large container.\nAllow to cure on a hot plate set to 60 °C for 2-3 hours.",
    "Sterilize with a solution of 70% ethanol with 30% distilled water for 30 minutes.\nCarefully aspirate the ethanol from each container and then allow to air dry in the BSC. Next, arrange the containers in the hood with each plate placed next to its lid, face-up. Expose containers to UV light under the BSC for an additional 30 minutes for further sterilization. Use sterile technique with every step after UV exposure.\nUsing very fine forceps, carefully remove each tightly rolled smooth muscle hydrogel ring from its post and transfer to its corresponding larger container with the tall posts.\n\t\nUse a pair of forceps in each hand and lift one side of the ring from the post, and then the other. Be careful to protect and maintain the lumen.\nPerform the transfer with this two handed method, sliding first one side, then the other side of the ring onto the tall post. Using gentle, gradual movements, and working circumferentially, slowly push the ring down onto the tall post. Subsequently stack tissue rings until the desired vessel length has been obtained, with each ring adding approximately 1-2 mm of length to the completed construct.\nWith the ring stack positioned on the tall 3D printed posts, turn the plate so that the post is parallel with the working surface.\n\t\nUsing a micropipette, add 40, 80 and 160 μL of thrombin at a concentration of 100 U/mL gently to the outer surface of each small, intermediate and large vessel, respectively. While adding the thrombin, slowly rotate the plate to ensure even coverage of all surfaces of the construct. This will be the base for the fibrin glue utilized to secure the ring stack construct in the initial days after construction.",
    "Next, add 40, 80 and 160 μL of fibrinogen at a concentration of 20 mg/mL to each small, intermediate, and large construct, respectively, using a micropipette while rotating the construct quickly. The thrombin and fibrinogen quickly set into a firm gel once mixed. Due to the short curing time, apply the fibrinogen as quickly and evenly as possible.\nAdd 20 mL of differentiation media to each container holding the construct. Place vessels into a 37 °C incubator until needed. Change media every 3-5 days.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
