Transfer the brain to a 60 mm plastic dish or similar surface containing ice-cold PGM.\nUsing a number 10 scalpel, cut coronal sections by making incisions at ∼2 mm and ∼5 mm from the anterior end of the brain (discard the olfactory bulb) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Move the resulting ∼3 mm section to a clean 60 mm plastic dish and keep it submerged in ice-cold PGM.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1323-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Landmarks for blocking the mouse brain\n(A) dotted lines indicate where to cut the brain to create a block for further dissection.\n(B) Coronal section of the brain depicts where to make 3 incisions to produce a small piece of periventricular tissue that will contain the dorsolateral and striatal SVZ.\nNote: Several coronal slices from different animals from the same biological group can be kept in the same plate until the next step.\nUse curved #7 Dumont forceps to gently move the slices to a dish containing cold PGM. Place the dish under a dissecting scope (with the posterior side facing up).\nIsolate the area enriched in SVZ cells\nRemove the hippocampus to expose the ventricle\nMake the 1st incision between the corpus callosum and top of the lateral ventricle\nMake the 2nd incision parallel to the wall of the lateral ventricle\nMake the 3rd incision parallel to the medial wall of the ventricle\nRemove the target region that contains the SVZ (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and move it to a clean dish containing ice-cold PGM.\nMince the SVZ enriched tissue in PGM into < 1 mm cubes (using #5 straight forceps).",
    "Using a wide-bore 1000 μL pipet tip (a wide bore tip can be made by cutting off 2 mm of a standard tip), transfer the tissue to a 15 mL conical polypropylene centrifuge tube, rinsing the dish with PGM to collect all tissue.\nCentrifuge at 200×g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of Digestion buffer and carefully resuspend the pellet.\nIncubate tube at 37°C under agitation for 30 min (an orbital or rocker shaker at 230 rpm is recommended)\nNote: We have tested other digestive enzyme mixes and found that only Liberase I preserves these antigens on the cell surface. Thus, do not substitute the Liberase I enzyme with any other enzyme. That said, the time of incubation in the Digestion buffer may need to be optimized for the age, strain and tissue volume being used; however, we have found that the digestion protocol defined here works well for both neonatal and adult mouse brains.\nAdd 2 mL of Inactivation buffer\nCentrifuge at 200×g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant.\nShatter the pellet by firmly striking the tip of the tube against the tissue culture hood.\nTissue trituration\nAdd 3 mL of PGB and gently triturate the tissue by pipetting up and down with a P1000 wide bore tip 5 times.\nAllow debris to settle down for 5 min\nTransfer 2 mL of supernatant to a 50 mL conical tube passing through a 100 μm cell strainer (previously rinsed with PGB).\nAdd 2 mL of fresh PGB to the original cell tube and triturate using a standard P1000 tip ∼15 times (which should be sufficient to dissociate the tissue). Pass all of the solution through a 100 μm filter (cell strainer) into the same 50 mL tube.",
    "Rinse the cell strainer with PGB bringing the volume in the 50 mL conical tube to 25 mL.\nCentrifuge at 200×g for 10 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of PGB. Keep the cells on ice.\nNote: If the tissue is not completely dissociated after step 13d, then let the tissue fragments settle, resuspend with 500 mL of PGB and triturate with a P200 tip until dissociated. As debris is created during tissue dissociation, the purpose of increasing the volume to 25 mLs in step 13e above is to reduce the amount of debris collected after centrifugation. Cells should be kept on ice throughout the entire protocol.\nCell surface staining\nTiming: 2–4 h\nStaining cell suspension with fluorescently conjugated antibodies and using Click-IT chemistry to detect EdU incorporation.\nDetermine the number of viable cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.\nTransfer 1 × 106 viable cells, in 50 μL of PGB, to a 1 mL microcentrifuge tube (if necessary, cells can be centrifuged and resuspended to achieve this cell concentration). This is the sample tube.\nPrepare 3 additional 1 mL tubes with 1 × 105 cells in 50 μL of PGB. These tubes will be used as controls as follow:\nUnstained\nIsotypes\nLive/Dead\nAdd 1 μL of Fc Receptor block (1/50) to each tube and incubate on ice for 10 min\nProceed as follows for each tube:\nSample tube:\nAdd the necessary volumes of each primary antibody to reach the dilutions in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], increasing the final volume to 150 μL of PGB (if more than 1 sample tube is being prepared, prepare a mix of antibodies and distribute an equal volume to each tube).\nIsotypes or unstained samples:",
    "Add the same amount of isotype fluorophore controls as used for primary antibodies, increasing the final sample volume to 150 μL of PGB.\nOr omit adding isotypes and increase the volume to 150 uL with PGB\nLive/Dead:\nAdd 100 μL of PGB\nRemove ½ of the total volume and incubate at 65°C for 5 min\nCool on ice\nReturn heat-killed cells to original tube (reconstituting the 150 μL in the Live/Dead tube)\nKeep on ice until step 25\nNote: A commercial live/dead viability stain kit can be used as an alternative to the DAPI staining, which allows the cells to be fixed and then analyzed on the flow cytometer the next day. For compatibility with this protocol, we recommend using a Live/Dead Blue kit for the fluorophores specified in this protocol and to use twice the concentration of the Live/Dead fluorophore as recommended in the manufacturer’s instructions. When using Live/Dead fixable kits substitute PGB with PBS in steps 22–27.\nIncubate all tubes on ice for 20 min (protected from light)\nCentrifuge at 300×g 5 min at 4°C\nRemove supernatant\nResuspend in 200 μL PGB for the first wash.\nRepeat steps 19–21 for a second wash, resuspending cells in 150 μL PGB\nAdd secondary antibody to sample tube to the dilution in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]\nAdd DAPI to all tubes at 1:50,000 dilution\nIncubate for 25 min on ice (protected from light)\nWash 2× with PGB as in steps 19–21\nFix cells by adding 1% fresh PFA in PBS w/o Ca2+ or Mg2+ and incubate for 20 min on ice.\nCentrifuge cells at 300×g for 8 min at 4°C and remove supernatant.\nResuspend pellet with PBS w/o Ca2+ or Mg2+\nPause point: At this step, cells can be stored overnight in PBS w/o Ca2+ or Mg2+, at 4°C (protected from light).",
    "Centrifuge cells at 300×g for 5 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μL of 1× Click-It saponin-based permeabilization and wash reagent\nIncubate for 15 min.\nPrepare Click-iT reaction cocktail according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAdd 150 μL of Click-iT reaction cocktail to each well\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light.\nCentrifuge cell at 300×g for 5 min at 4°C\nDiscard supernatant and wash cells with 200 μL of PGB\nCentrifuge cells at 300×g for 5 min at 4°C\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 mL of PGB\nKeep at 4°C until ready to load into flow cytometer\nFlow cytometry analysis\nTiming: 1–2 h\nRunning samples through the flow cytometer to evaluate cell phenotype and EdU incorporation.\nThe flow cytometer must be properly set-up and fluorophore compensation must be performed before analyzing samples. For the fluorophores specified here, the flow cytometer must be configured as described in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and as described more completely previously (Buono et al., 2015b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nTransfer volume of sample, Isotype and Live/Dead tubes to appropriate flow cytometry tubes (depending on the brand and model of the flow cytometry apparatus)\nLoad samples into the flow cytometer applying standard hierarchical gates as illustrated in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] to:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1323-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating strategy used to study neural progenitors by flow cytometry\nSVZs from 12 to 15 mice at P5 were obtained by dissection (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), pooled together, dissociated into single cells and then stained for flow cytometry.",
    "(A–C) Single, viable cells were identified using the strategy shown in the panels (A–C). First, cells were separated from debris using side-scatter (SSC-A) versus forward scatter (FSC-A) gating (A). From that gated population single cells were separated from doublets (SSC-H vs SSC-A) (B). Viable cells were then identified based on negative DAPI (or Live/Dead) staining (C).\n(E) From these viable cells a double gating strategy was used to classify subpopulations of SVZ neural progenitors. Cells were first characterized based on their expression of CD140a and NG2 (E).\n(D) Three subsets P1 (green), P2 (red) and P3 (yellow) were defined based on gates set using isotype controls (D).\n(F–I) Next, populations P1 to P3 were individually analyzed for expression of CD133 and LeX (F, H, I), where positively stained cells were, again, gated based on isotype controls (G). This strategy produced the following stem cell and progenitor populations: Within P1: MP2 (CD133+/Lex+), GRP2 (CD133-/Lex-) and BNAP/GRP1 (CD133-/Lex+) (I). Within P2, MP4 (CD133+/Lex+), GRP3 (CD133-/Lex-) and PFMP (CD133-/Lex+) (F). Within P3, NCS (CD133+/Lex+) and MP1 (CD133-/Lex+) (H). The full antigenic profile and frequency of each of these progenitors is provided in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Proliferative status was evaluated in each population by subsequently gating for EdU incorporation as shown in panel K for BNAP/GRP1s.\n(J) Cells unstained for EdU but stained for the other markers (EdU-control) were used to set the gate for EdU+ cells (J).\nRemove debris (SSC vs. FSC) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A)\nRemove doublets (FSC-H vs. FSC-A or SSC-H vs. SSC-A) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B)\nSelect live cells by gating on the DAPI negative population. Use Live/Dead (DAPI only) sample to set this gate). (Figure 2C[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nUse the isotype control tube (or unstained samples) to set the thresholds for cells deemed positively stained for NG2, CD140a, CD15 and CD133 (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2G).",
    "Using the antigenic profiles in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], create gate inclusion criteria for all of the populations listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E, 2F, 2H, 2I and 2J).\nUsing cells from mice that had not received EdU, set the gate for EdU (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J), then determine the EdU+ cells for each subpopulation of neural progenitors (e.g., for BNAP/GRP1 as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nRun all experimental samples, recording at least 100,000 events for each tube. Record data for all required channels.\nNote: Isotopes are used to determine the level of background fluorescence due to non-specific binding of the antibodies. Use samples with only the isotype antibodies to define the thresholds for positive cells. We recommend setting the thresholds using the isotype controls to include 2% of the viable cells in the positive gates."
