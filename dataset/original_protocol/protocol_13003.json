    "NOTE: Unless otherwise stated, parts of the experiment can be performed on a lab bench while wearing appropriate protective equipment (gloves).\n1. Coverslip silanization\nNOTE: Coverslips must be silanized to be used with the polymer brush coating employed in these experiments. This is a hydrophobic silanization treatment that allows a block copolymer with a hydrophobic central block to bind and create a polymer brush. The following steps should be performed in a fume hood to prevent exposure to toxic vapors while wearing gloves. Dimethyldichlorolsilane is highly toxic and must be handled with utmost care.\nRinse the coverslips with ddH2O, 70% ethanol, and ddH2O in order. Dry them with lint-free laboratory wipes between each rinse. This removes dust and water-soluble or organic particles from the surface before treatment.\nPlace the coverslips in a metal coverslip-holding rack and transfer the rack to a UV-Ozone (UVO) machine. Irradiate the coverslips with UVO for 20 min to remove any background fluorescence. A plasma chamber can be used instead of UVO.\nUsing tweezers, transfer the coverslips from the metal rack used for UVO treatment to a different metal rack used for silanization. Do not use the same racks for both, as it will cause high levels of oxidation when UVO is applied. Pre-clean the racks with water and ethanol so that no residual chemicals remain from previous uses.\nImmerse the rack with the coverslips in a container with 100% acetone for 1 h. Rinse the container 3x with tap water and then 3x with ddH2O to remove all acetone.\nImmerse the rack with the coverslips in 100% ethanol for 10 min. Rinse the container 3x with tap water and then 3x with ddH2O to remove all ethanol.\nImmerse the rack with the coverslips 3x in ddH2O for 5 min each.",
    "Immerse the rack with the coverslips in 0.1 M KOH (50 mL of 1 M KOH in 450 mL of ddH2O) for 15 min. Rinse the container 3x with tap water and then 3x with ddH2O to remove all KOH.\nImmerse the rack with coverslips 3x in ddH2O for 5 min each.\nAir-dry the rack with the coverslips overnight in a fume hood or laminar flow hood.\nAfter completely drying the rack and the coverslips, immerse them for 5 min in 2% dimethyldichlorosilane (DDS) taken in a different container that is used specifically for silane. Do not let anything that is not dry come into contact with the silane.\nImmerse the rack and coverslips 2x in a container with 100% ethanol for 5 min. Rinse the container 3x with tap water and then 3x with ddH2O.\nImmerse the rack and coverslips 3x in ddH2O for 5 min each.\nAir-dry the rack with the coverslips overnight in a fume hood or laminar flow hood.\nAfter this final drying step, transfer the coverslips back into coverslip boxes using tweezers. These coverslips can be used in the next 1-2 months. Old coverslips will begin to lose their coating and should be discarded.\n2. Tubulin preparation\nNOTE: The purchased tubulin comes as a lyophilized powder that is either unlabeled or labeled with fluorophores. Lyophilized tubulin is stored in a −80 °C freezer. The following procedure is used to mix unlabeled tubulin with labeled tubulin in a ratio that is good for visualization.\nRemove from the −80 °C freezer one aliquot of unlabeled tubulin containing 1 mg of lyophilized tubulin powder and keep it on ice. Add 200 µL of cold PEM-80 to the tube to bring the tubulin concentration to 5 mg/mL. Keep it on ice for 10 min to dissolve all the lyophilate.",
    "Remove from the −80 °C freezer one aliquot of rhodamine-labeled tubulin containing 20 µg of lyophilized tubulin powder and keep it on ice. Add 4 µL of cold PEM-80 to the tube to bring the tubulin concentration to 5 mg/mL. Keep it on ice for 10 min to fully dissolve the lyophilate.\nOnce dissolved, add 100 µL of unlabeled resuspended tubulin solution to the 4 µL solution of rhodamine-labeled tubulin. Pipette 6x-7x very slowly to mix. If aggregates are visible, centrifuge the solubilized tubulin for 10 min at 90,000 x g to remove aggregates by discarding the pellet and retaining the supernatant. This tubulin mix will result in ~4% labeled tubulin.\nDrop-freeze the remaining 100 µL of unlabeled tubulin into liquid nitrogen (LN2) and store it at −80 °C to be used for additional tubulin mixes.\nTake the labeled tubulin mix and aliquot into seven tubes with 15 µL each. Each aliquot can be used for a single experimental chamber. Drop-freeze the remaining aliquots and store them at −80 °C for future experiments.\n3. MAP65 purification\nNOTE: MAP65 is not commercially available and, thus, needs to be purified for this work. The protocol has been elaborated previously in several publications23,29.\nTransform the MAP65 plasmid and GFP-MAP65 plasmid into BL21 bacteria strain for protein expression.\nGrow BL21 bacteria to an optical density of 0.6-1 at 600 nm. Induce protein production using the lac operator and grow the bacteria overnight.\nPellet the cultures and lyse the bacteria.\nCollect the lysate after centrifugation and incubate it with beads that have a nickel ion available to bind the 6x-histidine tag.\nElute the protein using imidazole and desalt it.\nDrop-freeze the protein with liquid nitrogen and store it at −80 °C for use within 1 year.\n4. Assembly of flow chambers",
    "NOTE: Experiments are performed in flow chambers made from a glass slide and silanized cover glass (Figure 3).\nTake a glass slide and clean it using ddH2O, ethanol, and ddH2O in order. Dry with a lint-free laboratory wipe between each rinse.\nUse a piece of double-sided tape to create a flow path. Using gloved hands, cut the tape to ~25-30 mm in length. Split the tape lengthwise to create two thinner strips. Place the two tape strips onto the slide with about 5-8 mm between them.\n\tNOTE: As the thickness of the tape is standardized to about 80-100 µm, the width of the path between the pieces of tape will determine the volume in the chamber.\nPlace the silanized coverslips on top of the flow path. Seal the slide and coverslip to the double-sided tape strips by gently pressing on the tape region with the back of a pen. Make sure to get a good seal over the entire area; the tape should turn from translucent to clear when the seal is made well.\nRemove the extra tape on the edges, leaving only 1 mm from the flow chamber entrance by cutting the tape with a razor blade.\nLabel the chamber with information on the experimental parameters, as needed.\n5. Tactoid experiments\nNOTE : Once all the reagents and supplies are generated, they can be used to nucleate and polymerize microtubule tactoids in the flow chamber.\nCollect all the reagents to be used. Thaw them on ice and store them on ice while working. Make several flow chambers for the experiments.",
    "Use one flow chamber for each experiment. Coat the flow chamber surfaces with a polymer brush by flowing in 20 µL of 5% non-ionic block co-polymer surfactant (Table of Materials) dissolved in PEM-80, with small drops at both ends of the chamber to prevent the formation of air bubbles inside. Keep this in a humid chamber (i.e., Petri dish with a wet lint-free laboratory wipe) until ready to use (at least 5-7 min).\nIn a sterile tube, mix the following to create the Tubulin-MAP mix: 9.5 µL of PEM-80; 4 µL of 10 mM GMPCPP; 4 µL of 5% Pluronic-F127; 1 µL of 1M DTT; 1 µL of glucose; 2 µL of polyethylene glycol (PEG); 12 µL of 5 mg/mL tubulin mix (13.6 µM final concentration) from Step 2.5.; and 5.5 µL of working stock of MAP65 where 10% is GFP-MAP65 for visualization. Keep on ice while mixing.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to use a positive displacement pipette for handling the viscous PEG solution. Regular pipettes can be used after cutting the tip to make the opening larger; however, this method is less accurate.\nMix 5x-6x by pipetting.\nJust before adding to the chamber, add 1 µL of a pre-mixed solution of glucose oxidase (0.5 mg/mL) and catalase (0.15 mg/mL) (Deoxy) into the Tubulin-MAP mix and mix 7x-8x. Divide the total volume of the solution (40 µL) into two portions to be used in separate chambers.\nFlow the Tubulin-MAP mix into chambers. As the chambers already have non-ionic block co-polymer surfactant in them, more liquid cannot be added without removing the old liquid. To do this, use a piece of filter paper or a lint-free laboratory wipe at the other end of the chamber to remove liquid via capillary action.",
    "Once the sample is fully inside the chamber, seal the two ends of the chamber using 5-min epoxy and keep it at 37 °C for ~30 min to nucleate and grow microtubule tactoids.\n6. Fluorescence microscopy\nUse a fluorescence microscope for imaging the tactoids.\n\tNOTE: Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy or spinning disc confocal microscopy are good to remove background fluorescence from free tubulin, but tactoids are also visible by regular epi-fluorescence and even transmitted light microscopy once they are formed, making this procedure accessible without specialized equipment.\nUse a numerical aperture (NA) objective of 1.2 NA or higher with a magnification of 60x or higher to collect enough light in fluorescence. These objectives often require immersion in either ddH2O or oil.\nRecord images with CMOS or CCD camera. Use an effective pixel size on the camera of 108 nm.\n\tNOTE: The pixel size depends on the camera and the magnification used, which in this case was 60x or 100x with a high numerical aperture (1.2 or 1.49 NA). Additional image expanders can be used before the camera to achieve the needed pixel size.\nKeep the sample at 37 °C using an environmental chamber set to this temperature. Alternatively, employ other stage heaters including hot-air stage heaters and objective temperature-controlled collars with circulating warm water.\nUse excitation sources that are correct for the fluorescence needed. For rhodamine tubulin, use a 561 nm laser with at least 1 mW of power at the sample, and for GFP-MAP65, use a 488 nm laser with at least 1 mW of power at the sample.",
    "NOTE: If using wide-field epi-fluorescence microscopy, use a rhodamine filter cube with excitation: 540 ± 12.5 nm, dichroic: 545 nm ± 12.5 nm cut-off, and emission: 575 nm long pass, and a GFP filter cube with excitation: 480 ± 15 nm, dichroic: 505 nm ± 15 nm cut-off, and emission: 515 nm long pass.\nTake at least 10 images of different areas to image over 100 tactoids. Take images in both the red and green channels and save them as 16-bit tiff images for analysis. Make sure that the illumination power and the exposure times are such that the intensity scale for the camera is not saturated.\n7. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)\nNOTE: To study the mobility of the internal constituents of the tactoids, FRAP was used. FRAP works by photobleaching a selected part of rhodamine-labeled tubulin and GFP-labeled MAP65 tactoid and then observing the recovery of the fluorescence with time in that region. The rate of recovery depends on the turnover of the species being photobleached. This turnover rate can depend on diffusion and binding reactions. For MAP65 binding to the tactoids, binding exchange rates can be estimated. FRAP is performed using an additional 405 nm laser system that can scan the laser in any shape. There are many possibilities for performing FRAP, including using the transmitted lamp and aperture to photobleach a local area14.\nSelect an isolated tactoid in the chamber to create a region of interest (ROI) covering parts of the tactoids and the surrounding solution.\nUse a microscope with an additional 405 nm laser for FRAP to photobleach both the tubulin and MAP65 simultaneously. Alternatively, a bright lamp can be used through the field stop of the iris14. Adjust the specific intensity of the photobleaching systems empirically to avoid damaging the proteins during bleaching.",
    "Record the tactoid as a time series movie for 30-60 s before photobleaching to get information on the intensity prior to the bleach. Record both the red and green channels.\nPhotobleach the tactoid by exposing the ROI with either the lasers or the lamp for as long as needed to photobleach without damaging the tactoid. Determine the intensity and time empirically.\nContinue to record the movie in both color channels for 5-10 min post photobleaching or until the recovery seems to have reached equilibrium.\nVisually inspect the GFP-MAP65 channel for recovery.\n8. Data analysis\nNOTE: Quantitative analysis of the images of tactoids was performed to learn about the effects of environmental changes imposed via different crowding agents, ionic conditions, and the addition of other factors.\nTactoid shape characterization\n\t\nQuantify the length and width of the tactoids from the red and green images taken with confocal microscopy.\nOpen the images using FIJI/ImageJ.\nIf raw data is taken in 16-bit, adjust the brightness and contrast if necessary. Select Image > Adjust > Brightness and Contrast to adjust the image to be able to see the tactoid clearly. Adjust the brightness and contrast without applying the setting so as not to accidentally alter the intensity data.\nOnce the tactoids are clearly visible, select good tactoids to measure (Figure 4Bi). Ensure that the tactoids are clearly visible with no overlap with any other tactoid or aggregates and are not curved or bent to be able to use straight-line measurement tools.",
    "Next, check that the correct pixel size is set for the images. The microscope images come with metadata about the pixel size. When using a different camera that does not have metadata or external image expansion systems that can change the expected effective pixel size, adjust the pixel size manually. In FIJI/ImageJ, go to the Analyze > Set Scale to set the correct pixel conversion.\nUsing the Straight Line tool from the toolbar in FIJI/ImageJ, click on one end of the tactoid and drag the cursor to the other end of the tactoid (Figure 4Bii). Once the line ROI is selected, select Analyze > Measure to measure the length. If the length is not measured by default, make sure to set the measurement to include length in the Analyze > Set Measurements dialog box.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, when measuring using the Straight Line tool, it will give the length and angle of the line drawn. As an example, Figure 4Bii shows a straight line drawn to the side of the tactoid to make the latter visible but make the measurement directly on the tactoid.\nAfter making the measurement, use the Text tool in the toolbar to label the tactoid. Create a text box, add a number label, and select Edit > Draw to fix the label into the image. Save the image as a separate ROI file.\n\t\tNOTE: Labeling and saving this file allows the investigator to know which measurement corresponds to which tactoid from the raw data. Make sure to measure each tactoid once.",
    "After the tactoids for the entire image are measured, save the data in the Results window to a comma- or tab-delimited text file (using File > Save As) and open the data in a spreadsheet program to parse the data into numbers. Collect all the data together (raw image data, ROI image, and text file of results) into a folder with an appropriate naming convention to keep everything organized.\n\t\tNOTE: Although tactoid length measurements are performed by hand, given that the tactoid widths are narrow, it is better to employ a different method for measuring tactoid width (see below) to reduce measurement error.\nUsing ImageJ/FIJI, draw a line region using the Straight Line tool. Draw the line as a perpendicular bisector to the tactoid long axis (Figure 4Bii).\nSelect Analyze > Plot Profile to create the intensity profile of the linear bisector (Figure 4Biii). A plot will appear. To retrieve and save the data from the plot, select the List button on the lower left; this generates the text file list of the intensity data along the length of the line drawn. Save the text file as a .csv or .txt file.\nOpen the text file in a fitting program such as MatLab, Python (sciPy), or other programs. Fit the intensity data with a Gaussian function of the form: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63952/63952eq01v2.jpg, where I(x) is the grayscale value along the length, x; B is the background level; A is the amplitude of the Gaussian; µ is the mean or center of the Gaussian; and σ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian.\nReport 2σ as the width of the tactoid. Estimate the intensity of the microtubules in the tactoid by calculating the area under the Gaussian (not including the background).",
    "NOTE: If the images are within the linear intensity range of the camera and are taken with the same exposure time and excitation intensity, integrated intensities can be compared to estimate the relative number of microtubules in the tactoid.\nFRAP analysis\n\tNOTE: Experiments to test the mobility of the microtubules and the MAP65 used FRAP to record the specific photobleaching and recovery of intensity due to molecular motion (Figure 5A). The data were quantified from the image time series data using ImageJ/FIJI.\n\t\nUse ImageJ/FIJI to open the movie data.\nRegister the stacks (time series data) over time to remove drift. Use the StackReg plugin along with the ancillary TurboReg plugin; for instructions on using the plugins, refer to the weblinks given in the Table of Materials. Select translation to shift the position of the frames and thus register the images.\nOnce the images are registered to remove drift, rotate the image so that the tactoid is either vertical or horizontal in the frame by selecting Image > Transform > Rotate. Select the angle to rotate and use Preview to determine if the tactoid is rotated enough. When the preview shows that the tactoid is either vertical or horizontal, select OK to rotate all the images in the movie.\nUse the Rectangle selection tool in the toolbar to create a rectangular section over the photobleached region of the tactoid. Record the integrated intensity of the ROI area for each frame using Image > Stacks > Measure Stack. Set the measurement type to Integrated Density using Analyze > Set Measurements. Save the analyzed intensity data shown in the Results window as a text file in .csv or .txt format by selecting File > Save As.",
    "NOTE: Figure 5B shows an example of the raw 16-bit intensity data measured for the microtubule and GFP-MAP65 channels in the bleach region.\nAs the overall intensity of the images will fade over time globally due to photobleaching caused by imaging, this global photobleaching must be corrected. To do so, use the same ROI size (Step 8.2.4.), and move it to a region in the background of the image where no microtubules or MAP65 are visible. Measure the integrated intensity of the stack as described in Step 8.2.4. Save the results as a second text file.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 5B shows an example of the raw 16-bit intensity data measured for the microtubule and GFP-MAP65 channels in the background region.\nTo correct the background fading, divide the signal intensity on the tactoid by the background intensity for the same time point. Calculate Icorrected (t) as: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63952/63952eq02.jpg, where IS (t) (the signal) is the measurement made on the bleached region and IBG (t) (the noise) is the measurement made on the background region (Figure 5C). This calculates the signal-to-noise ratio for each frame and subtracts the noise as well.\nThen, rescale the data to range between zero and one using imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63952/63952eq03.jpg, where Imin and Imax denote, respectively, the global minimum and maximum of the Icorrected data over the entire time (Figure 5C).\nFit this data to a decaying exponential of the form: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63952/63952eq04.jpg, where A is the amplitude of the recovery and τ is the timescale of the recovery (Figure 5C)."
