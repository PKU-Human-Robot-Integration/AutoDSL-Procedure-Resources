    "1. Daily transfers of LTEE populations\nNOTE: The twelve LTEE populations are transferred daily by inoculating fresh medium with 1% of the cultures from the prior day's flasks. The steps in this process are summarized in Figure 1. The six Ara− populations started from strain REL606 are designated A−1 to A−6, and the six Ara+ populations started from strain REL607 are designated A+1 to A+6. Strict adherence to aseptic technique and to a schedule and order for transferring the populations minimizes the risk of contamination and other disruptions.\nDisinfect the surface on which the LTEE transfers will be conducted by wiping it with either 70% ethanol or a 10% bleach solution. Light a Bunsen burner to create a local updraft and enable the flaming of glassware.\n\tNOTE: Wear laboratory gloves to prevent contamination. For safety around an open flame, it is critical to only use gloves that are made of a material like nitrile that is not flammable.\nPrepare thirteen 50 mL borosilicate Erlenmeyer flasks capped with 20 mL borosilicate or polypropylene beakers that have been washed and sterilized by autoclaving. Check the flasks for visible debris and replace any that are not perfectly clean.\nLabel six flasks A−1 through A−6 using a red marker and the other six flasks A+1 through A+6 using a black marker. Label the last remaining flask, which will be blank, with the date in month/day format and the day of the week.\nFill each of the 13 flasks with 9.9 mL of DM25 medium using a sterile 10 mL serological pipette. Flame the mouth of each flask after removing the beaker serving as a lid and before replacing the beaker. Flame the tip of the pipette between filling each flask.",
    "NOTE: Instructions for making DM25 are available online30. If using a plastic serological pipette, forego flaming its tip or limit the time in the flame to avoid melting the plastic.\nRemove the prior day's LTEE flasks from the shaking incubator.\nExamine each flask by holding it up to the light to assess its turbidity and color, check flask integrity, and look for the presence of foreign matter.\n\tNOTE: To the naked eye, all Ara− and Ara+ cultures will look slightly turbid compared to the blank, except for A−3, which will be ~10-fold more turbid than the others owing to growth on citrate in the medium. Many outside microbial contaminants are also able to grow on citrate, so increased turbidity in populations other than A−3 likely indicates contamination. See the Representative Results section for images of the LTEE cultures before a transfer.\nOPTIONAL: Confirm that each LTEE culture has the expected turbidity by pipetting 1 mL of the blank and 1 mL of each culture into 1 cm plastic cuvettes and taking optical density readings at 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer after blanking the instrument.\n\tNOTE: This extra step can be useful for researchers who are new to working with the LTEE and are unsure about judging the turbidity by eye, as well as for documenting and investigating suspected anomalies. Take samples for measuring OD600 from the prior day's flasks only after completing the day's normal transfers to new flasks (the following steps) to minimize the risk of contaminating the cell populations that will continue to be propagated if the OD600 values are as expected. See the Representative Results section for typical OD600 values for LTEE cultures.",
    "Using a P200 micropipettor with a sterile filter tip, transfer 100 µL of culture from each LTEE flask into the corresponding flask containing fresh DM25. Begin with A−1, then transfer A+1. After that, continue alternating between the − and + populations. To keep track of which cultures have been transferred, shift flasks to the left after pipetting from or to them.\n\tNOTE: The strict order of transfers and alternation between Ara− and Ara+ populations aids in preventing and detecting cross-contamination and mix-ups. Observe strict aseptic technique: use a fresh pipette tip for each transfer, flame the mouths of flasks immediately after uncapping and before recapping, and wipe down the barrel and ejector of the micropipettor with a lint-free paper wipe moistened with 70% ethanol between each transfer. Bleach should never be used to disinfect micropipettors, as even trace amounts can kill the cultures.\nIncubate the newly inoculated flasks at 37 °C for 24 ± 1 h with 120 rpm orbital shaking over a 1-inch diameter.\nStore the cultures from the previous day at 4 °C. Retain these backup cultures for two days. Discard older cultures that were saved at 4 °C three days before at this time.\n\tNOTE: The previous two days' cultures provide two complete sets of backups with which to restart the experiment, if necessary, should any problem or accident occur, or if contamination of the previous day's cultures is discovered prior to transferring (e.g., odd coloration or unexpected particulates).",
    "Enter the time, date, transfer number, name or initials of the researcher who did the transfers, whether or not the cultures were okay, and any other relevant information in the transfer log notebook. Move on to steps 1.12-1.14 if any of the following situations occurs: (1) the blank from the previous day is contaminated, (2) a flask or its lid is cracked or broken, (3) a flask contains foreign material, (4) a flask is tipped over or dropped during transfers, or (5) there is any other event or observation that makes continuing from these flasks questionable.\nIf there are any problems, accidents, or suspicions of contamination with the previous day's LTEE cultures, do not transfer from them. Instead, store the entire set of twelve cultures at 4 °C for later examination and further characterization.\nRetrieve the flasks containing the backup cultures that were transferred from the day before and stored at 4 °C. Place them on the benchtop to warm to room temperature. Gently swirl each flask to resuspend the cells.\nTransfer from the backup flasks to the new set of flasks containing fresh medium and continue the experiment normally as described in steps 1.6-1.11. Make a note in the transfer log that the backup cultures were used and record the same transfer number as the day before.",
    "NOTE: Even if a problem is noted in only one population's flask, transfer all twelve populations from the backup flasks so that the number of generations that have elapsed in all populations stays in phase. If contamination is noted in the backup flasks stored at 4 °C, then the affected LTEE populations must be restarted from frozen stocks using the procedure described in steps 3.1-3.2 for population samples. The transfer number for the LTEE should not be incremented until the growth of the first cultures in DM25 following revival.\n2. Archiving the LTEE populations\nNOTE: Samples of the LTEE populations are frozen every 75 transfers. The populations grow ~6 ⅔ generations each day following the 100-fold transfer dilution, so this period corresponds to ~500 generations. During archiving, the LTEE populations are also plated on different types of agar media to check for contamination. Optionally, representative clones can be picked from these plates and archived at this time. These steps are summarized in Figure 1.\nOn the day before the planned freeze-down or a few days before, prepare three types of agar plates: Minimal Glucose (MG), Minimal Arabinose (MA), and Tetrazolium Arabinose (TA). Make twelve plates of each type of agar, plus a few extras. Also prepare at least 250 mL of 0.85% (w/v) sterile saline and 50 mL of 80% (v/v) sterile glycerol.\n\tNOTE: Recipes for all media and solutions are available online30. The day before the LTEE reaches a generation that is a multiple of 500 for the regular archiving schedule is the 74th day since the last freeze-down plus any days that were added owing to transfers from the 4 °C backup flasks when problems were detected or suspected.",
    "OPTIONAL: If archiving clonal isolates from the LTEE populations, prepare additional supplies: isolating three clones from each population requires 72 MG plates, 80 mL of 80% (v/v) glycerol, and 370 mL of DM1000.\nPrepare an extra set of twelve flasks when performing step 1.2 of the daily LTEE transfers on the day before the planned freeze-down. Label six of the additional flasks xA−1 through xA−6 using a red marker, and the other six xA+1 through xA+6 using a black marker.\n\tNOTE: The \"x\" indicates that the extra set of flasks will be used for archiving and differentiates them from the other set of flasks that will be used to continue the daily transfers of the LTEE in parallel.\nFill each of the additional flasks that will be used for archiving with 14.85 mL of DM25 using a 25 mL serological pipette when performing step 1.4 of the daily LTEE transfers.\nComplete the normal LTEE transfer as described in steps 1.5−1.11. Then, repeat the instructions for step 1.8, but this time transfer 150 µL from each of the previous day's LTEE cultures to the additional flasks of 14.85 mL of fresh DM25 that will be used for archiving.\n\tNOTE: In this and all subsequent steps, avoid contamination and mixups by following these guidelines. Begin with population A−1, then transfer A+1, and then continue alternating − and + populations. Wipe down the barrel and ejector of the micropipettor with a lint-free paper wipe moistened with 70% ethanol when switching populations. Shift flasks and test tubes over in their trays or racks after pipetting from or to them to keep track of which transfers have been completed.",
    "Incubate the set of twelve flasks for archiving at 37 °C for 24 ± 1 h with 120 rpm orbital shaking over a 1-inch diameter alongside the twelve LTEE cultures and the blank as described in step 1.9.\nPrepare supplies for plating the LTEE populations at least one hour before the LTEE transfers are to be performed on the day of the freeze-down.\n\t\nSelect twelve MG, twelve MA, and twelve TA agar plates. Visually inspect each one to be sure it does not have any obvious contamination.\nLabel one of each type of plate for each of the twelve LTEE populations (A−1 through A+6).\n\t\tNOTE: When labeling plates, write on the sides of the bottom of the petri dish. This is important for not obscuring colonies when one wants to examine or photograph them from below the agar. Do not write on the lids, as these can be mixed up.\nPlace the agar plates in a 37 °C incubator for at least 20 min to warm them before using them in step 2.10.\nPrepare 24 test tubes containing 9.9 mL of saline. Arrange them in twelve sets of two tubes each.\nLabel each of the two sets of twelve test tubes in the same way as the plates, adding a \"1\" or a \"2\" below the LTEE population identifier to designate the order in which they will be used for making dilutions of that population.\nPerform steps 1.1-1.11 using the flasks that will continue the daily transfers of the LTEE as usual. During step 1.5, also remove the twelve flasks containing the extra cultures for archiving from the shaking incubator.",
    "Pipette 100 µL of the culture from each of the twelve additional flasks for archiving into the first test tube of saline in the pair for that LTEE population. Vortex the tubes with these 100-fold dilutions thoroughly. Then, pipette 100 µL from each one to the corresponding second tube of saline. Vortex the final 10,000-fold culture dilutions thoroughly.\nPipette 80 µL from each of the tubes containing a 10,000-fold culture dilution to the labeled TA, MG, and MA plates for that population. Spread the liquid uniformly across the agar surface using either a sterile spreading rod or sterile spreading beads, as preferred. Repeat until all twelve populations have been plated on all three types of media.\nIf necessary, allow the plates to dry until no liquid is visible on the agar. Place the plates upside down (with the agar side up) in a gravity convection incubator set to 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Incubating plates upside down keeps the agar from drying out and prevents condensation from dripping onto the agar surface. Movement of cells in liquid on the agar surface during incubation can smear colonies and yield incorrect colony counts.\nAdd 3 mL of sterile 80% (v/v) glycerol to each of the twelve extra flasks earmarked for archiving. Mix thoroughly by swirling and gently vortexing.\nDistribute the mixture from each flask to sterile cryovials that have been labeled with a unique identifier for the sample, the LTEE population to which the sample belongs, the generation at which it was frozen, that it is a mixed (population) sample, and the date. Pipette 6 mL into one large vial and 1.25 mL into each of six small vials.",
    "NOTE: The large vial is the working stock. One small vial is a backup in case the working stock is exhausted or becomes contaminated. The other five small vials are copies that can be sent to other labs.\nFreeze the filled vials at −80 °C.\nExamine and document the growth and morphologies of colonies on the TA, MG, and MA plates after 24 h and 48 h of incubation.\n\tNOTE: See the Representative Results section for images and descriptions of colonies formed by the REL606 and REL607 ancestors and each of the twelve LTEE populations when they were plated at 76,000 generations.\nOPTIONAL: Perform the following steps when archiving clonal isolates.\n\t\nPick three clonal isolates (colonies) for each LTEE population from the MG plates, streak each one separately on a new MG plate, and incubate these plates for 16-24 h at 37 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: If colonies with different morphologies are present, standard practice in the LTEE is to sample for maximum diversity by first picking the most common type, then selecting further colonies from minority types. One can also use a random sampling strategy by marking dots on the underside of the bottom of the petri dish before spreading cells and then picking the isolated colony nearest each mark after growth.\nThe next day, streak a representative colony from each plate on a new MG plate and incubate these plates for 16-24 h at 37 °C.\nThe following day, inoculate one isolated colony from each MG plate into a flask containing 10 mL of fresh DM1000. Also, fill one additional flask with 10 mL of DM1000 to serve as an uninoculated blank to test for media contamination.\nIncubate the flasks at 37 °C for 16-24 h with 120 rpm orbital shaking over a 1-inch diameter.",
    "After incubation, add 2 mL of sterile 80% (v/v) glycerol to each flask and swirl to mix.\nDistribute 1.25 mL aliquots from each flask into small, sterile vials labeled with a unique identifier for each clone, its LTEE population and generation of origin, that it is a clonal sample, and the date.\nFreeze the filled vials at −80 °C.\n3. Competitive fitness assays\nNOTE: In the LTEE, reproductive fitness is quantified in terms of the relative number of doublings that different bacteria achieve over one or more 24 h culture cycles under the same conditions as the daily transfers. Specifically, the relative fitness of one competitor to another is the ratio of their realized doubling rates when they compete head-to-head in a co-culture. Each competitor in a pair may be a full population or a clonal isolate that was previously archived as part of the frozen \"fossil record\" of the LTEE. Alternatively, one or both competitors may be a clone that has been genetically modified to add or remove specific mutations to test their effects. The two competitors must have opposite Ara+/Ara− states because this genetic marker is used to differentiate them during this assay. The overall workflow for a competition assay is shown in Figure 2. The duration of the co-culturing phase can be extended from one to three (or more) days to improve the precision of fitness estimates when testing for differences between competitors that are nearly evenly matched. See the Disussion for other critical considerations and possible modifications of this protocol.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65342/65342fig02v3.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Competition assay flowchart. The full procedure for a one-day competition assay is shown.

Prepare the necessary supplies as described in the following steps.\n\t\tNOTE: Recipes for all media and solutions are available online30. The flasks and test tubes required for all days of a competition experiment can be filled beforehand or as needed on the days they will be used. If flasks and test tubes are filled ahead of time, store them at room temperature in the dark to minimize evaporation. TA plates need to be prepared at least two days in advance of when they will be used so they can dry enough after being poured to allow for spreading culture dilutions. Always prepare a few extra flasks, test tubes, and TA plates so that an experiment can continue if there are pipetting mistakes, contaminated plates, or other minor mishaps.\nFor the revival day (Day −2), fill one sterile 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask capped with a 20 mL beaker with 9.9 mL of either DM1000 or Lysogeny Broth (LB) per strain or population of E. coli that will be used as a competitor. Fill one more flask with 9.9 mL of the same medium to serve as an uninoculated blank.",
    "For the preconditioning day (Day −1), fill one test tube with 9.9 mL of 0.85% (w/v) sterile saline per competitor, two flasks with 9.9 mL of DM25 per replicate assay between a pair of competitors, and one more flask with 9.9 mL of DM25 for a blank.\nFor the day the competition begins (Day 0), fill one flask with 9.9 mL of DM25, fill one test tube with 9.9 mL of 0.85% (w/v) sterile saline, and prepare one TA plate per competition assay replicate. Fill one more flask with 9.9 mL of DM25 to serve as a blank.\nALTERNATIVE: For each day of a multi-day competition past the first, fill one flask with 9.9 mL DM25 per competition replicate and fill one more flask with 9.9 mL of DM25 for a blank.\nFor the final day of the competition (e.g., Day 1 or Day 3), fill two test tubes with 9.9 mL of 0.85% (w/v) sterile saline and prepare one TA plate per competition replicate.\nDay −2: Revive competitors separately in DM1000 or LB\n\t\nFor each of the competitors, label a flask filled with 9.9 mL of either DM1000 or LB. Label an additional flask filled with 9.9 mL from the same batch of medium to serve as an uninoculated blank to test for contamination.\n\t\tNOTE: Frozen stocks are revived in LB or DM1000 for more uniform and predictable recovery of cryopreserved cells. The glycerol used as a cryoprotectant can be metabolized by E. coli, which will lead to higher cell densities than expected if samples are revived in DM25. LB and DM1000 support growth to such high cell densities that this complication becomes negligible.",
    "Take the cryovials containing the frozen stocks of the competitor strains out of the −80 °C freezer. Keep the vials chilled in an ice bucket while using them.\nAfter each frozen stock has thawed, vortex it thoroughly to resuspend the E. coli cells. If reviving a clone, inoculate the flask containing fresh medium with 12 µL of the frozen stock. If reviving a population, inoculate the flask with 120 µL of the frozen stock.\n\t\tNOTE: The 120 µL volume of the frozen stock is used for populations so that the number of cells that is revived is approximately the same as the daily bottleneck when 1% of the LTEE population is transferred to a new flask. Thawing and vortexing frozen stocks multiple times can stress cells and reduce the viability of stocks over time. If a given LTEE population or clone is going to be used in competitions multiple times, it is good practice to regrow and freeze multiple copies of the stock so that no single one is thawed and re-frozen many times.\nIncubate the revival flasks and the blank at 37 °C overnight (16-24 h) with 120 rpm orbital shaking over a 1-inch diameter.\nDay −1: Precondition competitors separately in DM25\n\t\nFor each competitor, label a test tube filled with 9.9 mL of saline. For each replicate competition assay between a pair of competitors, label two 50 mL flasks filled with 9.9 mL of DM25, each with the replicate number and the name of one of the competitors. Label one additional flask filled with 9.9 mL of DM25 to serve as a blank.\nTake the flasks containing the cultures of revived competitors out of the incubator. Examine their turbidity by eye to confirm that they grew and that there is no obvious contamination.",
    "Pipette 100 µL from each flask into the test tube of saline for that competitor.\n\t\tNOTE: This step dilutes the culture 100-fold, which is necessary because the density of cells is much higher in LB and DM1000 than it is in the DM25 environment used in the LTEE (see Representative Results).\nVortex each dilution tube thoroughly right before pipetting 100 µL from the diluted culture into a flask with fresh DM25. Inoculate two of these preconditioning flasks for each replicate assay, one for each of the competitors.\nIncubate the preconditioning flasks and the blank at 37 °C for 24 ± 1 h with 120 rpm orbital shaking over a 1-inch diameter.\nDay 0: Begin competition by mixing competitors and plate for initial counts\n\t\nFor each competition assay replicate, label one flask filled with 9.9 mL of DM25 and one test tube filled with 9.9 mL of saline. Label the flasks and tubes in a way that uniquely identifies each pair of competitors and the replicate number of the competition assay. Label one additional flask filled with 9.9 mL of DM25 to serve as a blank.\nTake the preconditioning flasks out of the incubator. Examine their turbidity by eye to confirm that they grew and that there is no obvious contamination.\nTransfer 50 µL of the Ara− competitor into the first replicate competition flask filled with fresh DM25. Immediately, transfer 50 µL of the Ara+ competitor into the same competition flask and mix it by gently swirling.\nRepeat step 3.4.3 for all replicates of all pairs of competitors.",
    "NOTE: The competition flasks now have an overall 100-fold dilution of E. coli cultures grown in DM25, the same condition cells in the LTEE experience after each daily transfer. The order of performing transfers and mixing is important. Add both competitors to each flask immediately one-after-the-other so that neither gets a head start growing in the fresh medium. For example, do not add the Ara− cultures to all competition flasks and then go back and add all of the Ara+ strains.\nPipette 100 µL from each newly inoculated competition flask into the test tube of saline labeled for that competition assay replicate so that each of these tubes contains an overall 10,000-fold dilution of the preconditioned DM25 cultures that were combined.\nPlace the competition flasks and blank into the shaking incubator. Incubate the competition flasks at 37 °C for 24 ± 1 h with 120 rpm orbital shaking over a 1-inch diameter.\nOn the same day, immediately after placing the competition flasks into the incubator, vortex each test tube from step 3.4.5 thoroughly and spread 80 µL of these 10,000-fold dilutions on TA plates as described in step 2.10. Label the side of the bottom of each plate with the pair of strains that were mixed, the replicate number, and \"Day 0\" to indicate it will be used to determine the initial representation of each competitor.\nIncubate the TA plates upside down in a gravity convection incubator at 37 °C until colonies of both the Ara− and Ara+ competitors are visible and distinguishable. Generally, this occurs within 16-24 h, but it may take longer for some evolved strains. Count the numbers of Ara− (red) and Ara+ (white) colonies on each plate and record the results.",
    "NOTE: Differences between the colors of Ara- and Ara+ colonies on TA plates become less distinct over time, even when plates are stored at 4 °C, so they need to be counted as quickly as possible once they are removed from the incubator. Images of TA plates showing the typical appearances of colonies formed by Ara− and Ara+ cells are included in the Representative Results. That section also has images of common \"edge case\" colonies (e.g., overlap or outgrowth of different colony types), and explains how to count them. If the growth rates and morphologies of colonies formed on TA plates by any of the competitors have not been previously characterized, spread 80 µL of a 10,000-fold dilution in saline from the preconditioning flasks on Day 0, when the competitors are still separate from one another. Then, examine colonies on these control plates after incubation at 37 °C for 16-24 h or longer.\nALTERNATIVE: Days 1 and 2: Continue three-day competition\n\t\nFor each competition assay replicate, label one flask filled with 9.9 mL of DM25. Label the flasks in a way that uniquely identifies each pair of competitors, the replicate number, and the day of the competition assay. Label one additional flask filled with 9.9 mL of DM25 to serve as a blank.\nTake the competition flasks from the previous day out of the incubator. Examine their turbidity by eye to verify expected growth and detect contamination.\nTransfer 100 µL from each competition flask into the corresponding flask of fresh medium for the next day of the competition.\nPlace the new competition flasks and blank into the shaking incubator. Incubate them at 37 °C for 24 ± 1 h with 120 rpm orbital shaking over a 1-inch diameter.\nRepeat steps 3.5.1-3.5.4 on Day 2 of the competition before proceeding.",
    "Day 1 or 3: Finish competition and plate for final counts\n\t\nFor each competition flask, prepare two test tubes filled with 9.9 mL of saline. Label them in a way that uniquely identifies each pair of competitors, the replicate number, and whether they are for the first or second dilution.\nTake the competition flasks out of the incubator. Examine their turbidity by eye to detect that they grew and there was no obvious contamination.\nPipette 100 µL from each competition flask into the first tube of saline for that replicate. The resulting tubes contain 100-fold dilutions of the DM25 cultures.\nVortex each 100-fold dilution tube to mix it thoroughly and pipette 100 µL to the second tube of saline for that replicate. The resulting tubes contain 10,000-fold dilutions of the DM25 cultures.\nVortex each test tube containing a 10,000-fold dilution thoroughly and spread 80 µL of it on a TA plate as described in step 2.10. Label the side of the bottom of each plate with the pair of strains that were mixed, the replicate number, and \"Day 1\" for a one-day competition or \"Day 3\" for a three-day competition to indicate it will be used to determine the final representation of each competitor.\nIncubate TA plates at 37 °C and count the Ara− and Ara+ colonies after growth as described in step 3.4.8.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep track of the replicate number of each competition assay throughout all transfers and plating steps. Confusing which final and initial counts correspond between different replicate assays — even when the same two competitors were mixed in each one — will result in incorrect fitness estimates.\nCalculation and plot fitness",
    "If using Excel for calculating and plotting relative fitness, download the XLS spreadsheet (Supplemental File 1). If using R, install the fitnessR package31 and download the comma-separated values (CSV) template (Supplemental File 2) or generate a new copy of this file following the directions in its vignette.\nEnter a \"transfer dilution\" of 100 for the competition assays conducted in the designated cell or column in the downloaded file. Enter the total number of daily growth cycles during which the competitors were co-cultured as the \"number of transfers\" (e.g., 3 for a three-day competition).\nEnter the names of each pair of competitors into the designated cells or columns with the reference strain as \"competitor1\" and the test strain or population as \"competitor2\".\nFor each competition assay replicate, enter the respective initial and final colony counts into the designated columns of the downloaded file.\nIf using the Excel spreadsheet, it will now display the mean relative fitness value and 95% confidence limits on this estimate. Copy the results for different combinations of competitors to another sheet and create a chart that summarizes the results. If using R to analyze the data, follow the directions in the vignette for the fitnessR package to perform these calculations, output a CSV file with the calculated values, and plot the results."
