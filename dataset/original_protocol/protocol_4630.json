    "DNA preparation (assumes use of pHYG3)Digest pHYG3 plasmid (http://www.biologie.uni-regensburg.de/Genetik/Mages/pHyg3.html[href=http://www.biologie.uni-regensburg.de/Genetik/Mages/pHyg3.html]) DNA with PvuII. PvuII was chosen specifically for pHYG3 plasmid because it releases a DNA fragment that contains the hygromycin B resistance gene aph7 with short flanking sequences. Based on our experience and others, linear DNAs are often shortened on each end after entering the cells of C. reinhardtii-ranging from dozens to hundreds of nucleotides-due to the exonuclease activity. It makes it harder to map the disrupted loci because the precise sequence of the insertion is unpredictable and different in each clone. Hence, we recommend using a DNA fragment that is just enough to cover the selectable marker (i.e. promoter, coding sequence, and terminator), so if the transformed DNAs are shortened to an extent that compromises the integrity of the marker, the clones harboring them will not be pulled out of the screen. In other words, the clones in the mutant library have the insertion whose length lies between the PvuII-digested fragment and the combined length of promoter, coding sequence, and terminator.Gel-excise the shorter, 2,012-bp fragments of the pHYG3 plasmid.Growth conditionIn general, cells were grown in liquid TAP medium under continuous light (70-80 μmol/m-2 s-1) at 22 °C, with shaking at 100 rpm; or ambient room temperature (~22 °C) for solid media.Glass bead transformationGrow cultures in TAP media (50 ml in 250 ml flask) until cell density reaches 1-2 x 106 cells/ml determined by Z2 Coulter Counter or hemocytometer, or approximately 0.2~0.3 OD550 by spectrophotometer.While cells are growing, prepare hardware: add ~0.3 g (~300 µl) glass beads to test tubes, autoclave.Pellet the cells by centrifugation (1,500 x g for 2 min), and resuspend in TAP to a concentration of ~2 x 107 cells/ml. Transfer 0.",
    "3 ml of cells to the glass bead-containing test tube, add ~1 µg linearized plasmid DNA prepared earlier (see Procedure A DNA preparation), and vortex 15 sec at top speed (Note 2).Add 6 ml TAP to the test tube, carefully transfer the cells (6 ml + 0.3 ml) to a new sterile 15 ml conical tube, and shake under growth conditions overnight (Note 3) at 100 rpm.After overnight recovery, add 6 ml of top agar (microwave to melt the top agar, cool to ~40 °C before pouring into the overnight culture) into the overnight culture (1:1 mixture). Mix gently.Immediately pour the 1:1 mixture onto TAP plates (6 ml for one regular Petri dish, 2 Petri dishes needed), let set (Note 4). Wrap plates with parafilm (cut slits to allow gas exchange), and place under lights. Colonies should start appearing in 5 to 7 days on the plate surface or embedded within the top agar layer. Generally speaking, 50 ml of culture (step C1) produces approximately 500 colonies after transformation. To create a mutant library ranging the entire C. reinhardtii genome (about 18,000 genes), it would require ~100 transformations in order to get a 3 fold coverage. Use sterile toothpicks or pipet tips to pick up the colonies."
