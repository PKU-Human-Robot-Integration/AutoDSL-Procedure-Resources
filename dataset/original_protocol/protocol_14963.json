  "procedures": [
    "Note: Three dental resin composites were studied using the glass cavities: Z100, Z250 and LS, as listed in Materials List. Among them, LS is known to be a low-shrinkage resin composite with a volumetric shrinkage of around 1.0%, much lower than those of Z250 and Z100 (~2% and ~2.5%, respectively)18-19. The equipment and other materials used in this study are also given in Materials List.\n1. Model Cavity Preparation\nCut a long cylindrical glass rod, 10 mm in diameter, into 10-mm long short rods using a low-speed diamond saw.\nCut a Mesial-Occlusal-Distal (MOD) cavity (Figure 1) measuring 3 mm (width) x 2 mm (depth) in each specimen using an adapted low-speed diamond saw.\nPolish down each cylindrical specimen to create a flat surface perpendicular to the length of the cavity, with dimensions as shown in Figure 1. The flat surface allows precise focusing and image calibration on the restoration. Henceforth, it will be called the observation surface.\nPrepare three specimens for each of the three materials tested: Z100, Z250 and LS; see Materials table.\n2. Cavity Filling with Resin Composite\nApply a thin layer of Ceramic Primer with a brush to silanize all the glass cavity surfaces. This allows bonding between the glass surfaces and the resin composites.\nAfter about 1 min, apply a thin layer of adhesive. Use LS Adhesive system for composite LS and Adper Single Bond Plus for composite Z100 and Z250.\nCure the adhesive with a curing light and duration (10-20 sec) based on the manufacturer’s instructions (Materials table).\nCover all the glass surfaces surrounding the restoration with black tape except the observation surface, as shown in Figure 2. The purpose is to avoid the curing light reaching the resin composite through the surrounding transparent glass, which does not happen in real teeth.",
    "Bulk-fill the cavity with resin composite and scrape off any excess to flatten all the surfaces.\n3. Surface Painting\nSpray a thin layer of white paint onto the observation surface, which now includes part of the resin composite.\nSprinkle immediately some black fine charcoal powder onto the paint to create high-contrast speckles. The irregular shapes of the speckles will help the DIC software to identify them and track their movements.\n4. Sample Mounting, Curing, and Photographing\nReferring to Figure 2, place a specimen (E) into the holder (C) and tighten it with a screw (D). Then, place the whole unit at the end of a large horizontal beam.\nSecure a CCD camera and a yellow illumination LED light onto the same beam such that they face the observation surface.\nUsing a stand with adjustable clamps, position the curing light such that its tip is about 1 mm above the sample.\nTake a picture of the specimen to provide the reference image prior to curing.\nCure the resin composite for 20 sec.\nTake another picture at 5 min after curing.\nPlace a calibration block at the same position as the observation surface and take a picture. The calibration block contains an array of circular dots with size and spacing precisely known.\n5. Image Analysis with DIC Software\nImport the two pictures taken for each sample, one before and one after curing, into the DIC software.\nCalibrate the dimensions of the images and correct for image distortion using the image of the calibration block. .\nDefine the area of interest within the observation surface for analysis.\nDefine the size of the square subset windows as 64 x 64 pixels for the first iteration and 32 x 32 pixels for the second iteration20. Define the overlap as 50%.",
    "Correlate the image taken after curing with the reference image taken before curing to calculate the displacement and strain distributions.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
