    "Collection of renal samplesPreparation of work tools for sample processingAutoclave clean tweezers and scissors after wrapping them in aluminium foil.Renal biopsies procedureA Needle core biopsy was performed at the start of experimental procedure (T0) and at several intermediate time points in healthy and treated pigs. Renal biopsies was performed under direct ultrasound guidance with automated biopsy needles. After the sacrifice, kidneys were explanted and cuneiform biopsies of cortical and medullary regions were obtained with safety safeshield scalpels. Each renal biopsy was delivered to the histological laboratory in a 50 ml Falcon containing 20 ml of cold (~4 °C) sterile DPBS and was identified by a unique code for each animal.All renal biopsies have to be immersed in ice for a half an hour at the most.Preparation of renal biopsies before fixationEach renal biopsy has to be transferred in a 60 mm dish containing 3 ml cold (~5 °C) DPBS and cleaned from any residual connective or adipose tissue by sterile tweezers.The specimen size can be reduced to 0.5 x 0.5 cm with a sterile mono-use scalpel.The renal specimen has to be transferred in another 60 mm dish containing 3 ml of cold (~4 °C) DPBS.Paraffin slides processingRenal specimen fixationThe renal specimen has to be transferred into 15 ml conical tube with 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) at room temperature for 8 h but no longer than 24 h. Make sure you have enough fixative to cover tissues. Fixative volume should be 5-10 times of tissue volume.Note: The renal specimen is not hold up in paraffin cassettes. Tissue processing was carried out manually to mimic the individual cumulative steps of automated processing. Renal specimen dehydrationAfter fixation, formalin has to be discarded.",
    "The renal specimen has to be dehydrated moving to alcohol grades steps:10 ml 50% ethanol for 40 min (max 5 days) at room temperature.10 ml 70% ethanol for 40 min at room temperature.10 ml of 95% ethanol for 25 min at room temperature.10 ml of 95% ethanol for 25 min at room temperature.10 ml of 100% ethanol for 25 min at room temperature.10 ml of 100% ethanol for 25 min at room temperature.Note: These steps should be completed fully (with sufficient time set aside for these steps) because insufficient dehydration can lead to tissue degradation. Renal specimen clarificationThe renal specimen has to be cleared with xylene:10 ml of xilene for 15 min.10 ml of xilene for 15 min.Renal specimen infiltration by paraffinThe renal specimen has to be transferred into a becker containing liquid Paraffin in 58 °C paraffin bath: 10 ml of liquid Paraffin for 2 h in an oven at 56 °C-58 °C (the melting temperature of paraffin).Embedding renal tissues in paraffin blocksSmall amount of molten paraffin has to be put in mold, dispensing from paraffin reservoir.Using warm forceps, the renal specimen has to be transferred into the well of the metal steel base mold in health block, placing cut side down.The embedding ring has to be put into the steel base mold (at 56 °C). The paraffin ribbon is floated onto the surface of a warm water bath, where it spreads out and flattens perfectly.The mold has to be transferred quickly to cold plate (-20 °C), and gently press tissue flat. Paraffin will solidify in a thin layer that holds the tissue in position.Hot paraffin has to be added to the mold from the paraffin dispenser. Be sure there is enough paraffin to cover the tissue. The paraffin block should solidify in 30 min at -20 °C.",
    "When the wax is completely cooled and hardened the paraffin block has to be easily popped out of the mold; the wax blocks should not stick. If the wax cracks or the tissues are not aligned well, simply melt them again and start over.Preparation of paraffin sections: Sectioning protocol:The paraffin block has to be sectioned at the desired thickness (usually 4-5 µm) on a microtome and float on a 40 °C water bath containing distilled water.Notes:Keep record of the orientation and sequence of the sections.  The histology bath has to reach a temperature up to 56 °C to allow the paraffin sections to flatten. The paraffined sections have to be transferred onto Super Frost Plus Microscope slide. The slides have to dry overnight and store slides at room temperature until ready for use. Immunofluorescence stainingThe paraffin sections have to deparaffinated and rehydrated (The entire process must be set up in the fume cupboard)The slides have to be deparaffinized in pure xylene for 15 min. Note: Xylene removes the excess of wax around the tissue and deparaffinates the paraffined sections. The slides have to rehydrated using graded alcohol series for few minutes and rinse in deionized water:Ethanol 100% for 6 min.Ethanol 95% for 1 min.Ethanol 70% for 1 min.Ethanol 50% for 1 min.Deionized water for 5 min (for three times).Heat-induced Antigen unmaskingThe slides have to be transferred into a plastic vertical staining jar (suitable for microwave), containing 100 ml of sodium citrate buffer 10 mM at pH = 6 (filled to the brim) and put in a water bath.Note: The water bat is obtained put slide jar into a glass of water (suitable for microwave) and put the entire thing into the microware. This reduces the boiling inside the jar .",
    "The slides have to be subjected to three microwave (750 W) cycles of 5 min.The volume of antigen retrieval buffer has to be top up with distilled water at each cycle in order to avoid evaporation during boiling.The slides have to be let slowly cool.Note: The number of slides must be the same of the positions available in the staining jar at each antigen unmasking process so that the efficiency of unmasking is always the same. If less slides are used, fill up the empty spaces with empty glass slides. This ensures a similar heat distribution to each slide and reduces the differences in antigen retrieval. Immunofluorescence staining:The cool slides have to be transferred into glass vertical staining jar with lid filled with deionized water. Wash the slides in deionized water for 5 min on aorbital shaker at room temperature.The slides have to be rinsed in three changes of PBS 1x for 5 min each with agitations at room temperature.The slides have to be placed with kidney sections facing up in the humidified chamber.Each section on the slides has to be limited with a PAP-pen to prevent overflows.100-200 μl of blocking buffer (10% Normal Goat Serum diluted in PBS 1x) has to be added to each section and incubated for 1 h, at room temperature, in the humidified box.The staining mix has to be prepared combined and diluted appropriately the two different antibodies (α-SMA 1:100, PDGFR-β 1:100) in the blocking mix (5% of Goat Serum), respecting the dilution tested individually before.The blocking buffer has to be removed gently (e.g., by tipping the slide sideways onto a paper towel), without rinsing before adding primary antibody.100 μl of primary antibodies mix has to be added to each section and incubated in the humidified chamber overnight at +4 °C.",
    "Negative control of the IF reaction has to be obtained incubating the isotype control antibody instead of the primary antibodies mix on a well delimited section in one of the slides.The slides have to be rinsedin PBS 1x for three times, 5 min each.A mix of the two secondary antibodies, respectively to bind the two primary antibodies, has to be prepared combined and diluted appropriately: Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse 555 (1:200) and Alexa Fluor goat anti-rabbit 488 (1:200) in PBS 1x in the dark.The secondary antibodies mix (the volume ranges from 50-100 µl depending of the biopsies area) has to be applied on the sections and incubate for 1 h in the humidified box in the dark.The slides have to be submersed in PBS 1x for 5 min for 3 times.To counterstain the slides, a solution of TOPRO3 (dilution 1:3,000) in PBS 1x has to be prepared and added on each section. The slides have to be incubated in the humidified box and in the dark for 10 min.TOPRO3 solution has to be drained off from the slides, and without rising, a drop of fluoromount has to be added on the slides to mount a coverslip. Make sure that no air bubbles are formed.The slides have to be sealed with a nail polish to preserve staining and stored for a long time in the dark.The slides has to be acquired by confocal microscope Leica TCS SP2 (Leica)."
