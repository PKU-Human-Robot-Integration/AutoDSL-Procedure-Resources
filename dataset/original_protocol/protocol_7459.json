    "This assay is performed by mixing the purified or reconstituted ATPase, 5 μCi [γ-32P]-ATP, and 1 mM non-radioactive ATP in a reaction buffer that contains Mg2+. Control reactions include a sample without protein addition and an incubation of the ATPase in the presence of 1 mM orthovanadate, a classical inhibitor of P-type ATPases. In addition, a catalytically inactive mutant of the protein can serve as a negative control for the reaction to evaluate the presence of potentially contaminating ATPases present in protein preparations. The amount of non-radioactive ATP used in each reaction has to be in excess, so that it is not rate-limiting. Typically, approximately 1 mM of non-radioactive ATP is used per reaction. However, the quantity of protein, the ATP concentration, and the incubation time for the ATP hydrolysis reaction should initially be tested. For an overview, the workflow is visualized in Figure 1. The ATPase reaction is terminated by placing the samples on ice and acid addition. Subsequently, reaction components are separated by molybdate-phosphate extraction and the amount of liberated inorganic phosphate is determined via scintillation counting. Comparison to a buffer sample without protein is used for background correction. A calibration reference sample with a known volume from the [γ-32P]-ATP stock allows calibration of the measured scintillation signal to [γ-32P] in the sample, and thus a quantification of the hydrolyzed ATP.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4676/bioprotoc-13-10-4676-g001.jpgFigure 1. Experimental design and workflow for measuring ATPase activity. After preparing the samples, the ATPase mix is added, and the reaction is started by transferring the samples to the heating block. The reaction is terminated by placing the samples on ice and adding reagent A, which contains molybdate that forms a complex with free inorganic phosphate.",
    "The solution is transferred to a glass tube containing orthophosphoric acid, and reagent B is added for phosphate extraction by phase separation. After separation, 500 μL of the upper phase is added to the scintillation fluid in the scintillation vial and taken for measurement.Sample preparation We recommend preparing each sample as duplicates or triplicates.Prepare test samples with a final volume of 45 μL in separate 2 mL reaction tubes on ice. An exemplary pipetting scheme is shown in Table 1. Typically, 40–250 ng of purified ATPase is used per reaction. If the specific ATPase activity range of the protein is unknown, several dilutions should be tested. Use the assay buffer to make a total of 45 μL volume.Note: It is recommended to store purified proteins at -80 °C in small aliquots to avoid multiple freeze-thaws. Thawing has to be done slowly on ice before an experiment is performed. Table 1. Exemplary pipetting scheme for samples and buffer in duplicates and calibration reference in triplicates. 10× ATPase reaction mix is added at a later step (see Section C).table:",

    "Prepare test samples with inhibitor using the same quantity of purified ATPase as before with the addition of inhibitor. Use the assay buffer to make a total of 45 μL volume. Incubate the samples for 20 min at room temperature to allow proper inhibition.Note: If sodium orthovanadate is used as an inhibitor, it has to be boiled for 15 min at 95 °C and subsequently stored on ice until use to destroy polymers. Prepare a blank by adding 45 μL of assay buffer in a separate 2 mL reaction tube.Store samples (after incubation if inhibitors are used) on ice until the assay is started.Preparation of the 10× ATPase reaction mix To take the rate of decay of [γ-32P]-ATP into consideration, calculate its activity for the day the assay is conducted. Manufacturers specify a calibration or reference date that corresponds to the indicated activity of a radiolabeled reagent. This date can be used to determine the residual activity of the radioactive isotope on the day the assay is conducted using the following equation:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4676/bioprotoc-13-10-4676-ga002.jpg A(t) = activity at time point t A0 = initial activity (at t = 0) t = time point (days after t = 0)Furthermore, the reference number of the [γ-32P]-ATP (BLU502H) can be used to obtain both the concentration in mCi/mL and the specific activity in Ci/mmol of the stock solution via the PerkinElmer Homepage:https://www.perkinelmer.com/tools/calculatorrad#/product/BLU502H[href=https://www.perkinelmer.com/tools/calculatorrad] Note: The recommended [γ-32P]-ATP (BLU502H) contains 50 μL only. The earlier the experiment is performed after the calibration date, the more samples can be tested. Calculate the volumes needed for each component for the preparation of the 10× ATPase reaction mix (1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 μCi/μL [γ-32P]-ATP in assay buffer) as displayed in Table 2.",
    "For each sample, 5 μL of mix is needed and an excess of one sample should be prepared for the preparation of calibration reference samples. Based on the calculation, first prepare the 10× ATPase reaction mix without [γ-32P]-ATP.Table 2. Exemplary pipette scheme for the 10× ATPase reaction mix for one and six samples. For every sample, 5 μL of the mix with a total of 2 μCi [γ-32P]-ATP is needed. The amount of [γ-32P]-ATP has to be calculated on the basis of the half-life and calibration date (exemplified here with a concentration on the date of the experiment of 5 μCi/μL). The total volume of the reaction mix should always be adjusted to 5 μL per sample using assay buffer.table:",

    "From this step onwards, radioactive material handling precautions have to be taken. These include the use of appropriate shielding materials such as Perspex shielding (3/8 inches thick), behind which all work should be done, and Perspex Eppendorf tube holders. Surfaces should be routinely monitored by Geiger counters, and ring dosimeters can be used to monitor personal exposure. Radioactive isotopes should be used only by authorized personnel in designated places following the institution’s regulations. Requisition and storage of radioactive material, solid and liquid radioactive waste disposal, and spill decontamination should be carried out according to the institution’s regulations. Finalize the 10× ATPase reaction mix by addition of the appropriate volume of [γ-32P]-ATP from the solution stock, as calculated in B.2.ATPase assay Add 5 μL of 10× ATPase reaction mix supplemented with [γ-32P]-ATP to each sample on ice.Note: The excess 10× ATPase reaction mix is later used for the preparation of reference samples in section D. Start the ATPase reaction by transferring the samples to a thermomixer at 28 °C under gentle shaking (do not exceed 700 rpm).Note: The optimal temperature will depend on the ATPase and should initially be tested. Incubate for 60 min.Note: Since the assay is based on end-point determination, it is important that the reaction is not limited by the amount of ATP available. To prevent a complete ATP consumption and thereby underestimation of sample activity, several ATPase dilutions should be tested. Stop the reaction by placing the samples on ice and subsequently adding 1.5 mL of Reagent A (Recipe 4).Note: All ATPases should be inactivated and the reaction stopped completely. However, to prevent autohydrolysis of [γ-32P]-ATP, the samples should be processed directly by extraction of phosphate. Molybdate-phosphate extraction Note: Molybdate-phosphate extraction is needed to separate inorganic 32P-phosphate from non-hydrolyzed 32P-ATP, as illustrated in Figure 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4676/bioprotoc-13-10-4676-g002.",
    "jpgFigure 2. Illustration of the molybdate-phosphate extraction procedure. After the ATPase reaction, free 32P-phosphate and non-hydrolyzed γ-32P-ATP are present in the same solution. Reagent A, containing ammonium molybdate, is added and forms a complex with the inorganic phosphate. Addition of reagent B results in phase separation in the lower aqueous phase and the upper organic phase. The molybdate-phosphate complexes localize to the upper organic phase, while the non-hydrolyzed ATP remains in the aqueous phase. A sample of the organic phase is taken for scintillation counting, to determine the amount of inorganic phosphate formed.Transfer each sample to separate 15 mL glass tubes containing 15 μL of 20 mM H3PO4 (Recipe 6).Note: The phosphate of H3PO4 serves as a carrier for the inorganic phosphate of the ATPase reaction in the next step. Add 3 mL of Reagent B to all samples, fasten the lid, and vortex for 30 s.Note: Reagent B is volatile. Work under the fume hood. Incubate on ice for 10 min to allow phase separation.Add 2 mL of scintillation fluid to 4 mL scintillation vials; separate tubes are needed for every sample and three calibration references.Note: The scintillation counter used here measures through the lid. Therefore, the tubes should be labeled on the sides of the vial, not on the lid. Clarify how your device is measuring and change the labeling position accordingly. After phase separation, take 500 μL of yellow, upper, organic phase containing the radioactive orthophosphate-molybdate complex and add it on top of the scintillation fluid in scintillation vials.Note: The organic phase has low surface tension and tends to drop out of the pipette. Note: Do not pipette up and down in the vial, as scintillation fluid gets stuck in the tip.",
    "To allow quantification of the scintillation measurement, prepare a 1:10 dilution of 10× ATP reaction mix (2 μL + 18 μL H2O) and add 2 μL of 1:10 dilution to the scintillation tube with scintillation fluid. Make triplicates of this calibration reference.Scintillation counting using MicroBeta2 Tighten the lids of the scintillation vials properly.Place vials in the measuring cassette, invert it several times for mixing, and place it in the scintillation counter with the stop cassette below.Start the MicroBeta2 Windows Workstation program.Create a protocol for 32P measurement, as shown in Figure 3.Set Label 1 to 32P and Label 2 to None.Set Plate/Filter to 4 mL plate 6 × 4.Set Assay Type to Normal.Set counting time to 1 min.Set Detector Normalization and Background correction to None.Set counting precision to 0.2 2 sigma%.Set cycling parameter to 1 time per plate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4676/bioprotoc-13-10-4676-g003.jpgFigure 3.
