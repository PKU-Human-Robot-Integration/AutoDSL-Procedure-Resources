    "The following experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.\n1. Preparation of Plasmid DNA for Microinjection\nPurify the plasmid pTol2-krt4:KalTA4-ERT2;cmlc2:eGFP with a commercial plasmid DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions and dilute the plasmid DNA to a final stock solution concentration of 100 ng/μl.\nLinearize the transposase containing plasmid pT3TS/Tol214 by BamHI restriction digestion, following the manufacturer protocol. This step can be extended overnight. Precipitate the linearized DNA by a phenol/chloroform extraction, following the standard protocol.\nIn vitro transcribe the transposase mRNA from the linearized plasmid with a commercial transcription kit for large amounts of capped RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions, dilute and aliquot to a final stock solution concentration of 100 ng/μl in nuclease-free water. Ensure quality of the purified RNA with a native 1-2% TAE (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA) agarose gel electrophoresis (80-120 V). Store the RNA at -80 °C.\n2. Microinjection of Plasmid DNA for Transient Gene Expression\nPrepare an agarose injection plate to hold the fertilized eggs during injection. Pour liquid 3% agarose into a 90 mm Petri dish. Let the agarose cool to 40-50 °C and add the wedged-shaped microinjection mold TU-1 on top of the liquid agarose. After hardening at room temperature, let the agarose rest at 4 °C for 30 min before removing the mold. Store microinjection molds at 4 °C and reuse.",
    "Prepare an aliquot of the injection solution. Perform the following steps on ice. Pipette 1 μl of plasmid DNA (final concentration of 10 ng/μl), 2 μl of transposase mRNA (final concentration 20 ng/μl), 2 μl of 10 mg/μl Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran, 2 μl of 5x Danieau solution (290 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 3 mM Ca(NO3)2, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.6) to a final volume of 10 μl in nuclease-free water.\nPrepare needles from borosilicate glass capillaries of 1 mm diameter containing an inner filament by pulling the capillary in opposite directions with a Micropipette Puller. Use the following program: heat 530, pull 200, velocity 80 and time 150.\nFill one needle with 2 μl of the injection solution (kept on ice). Avoid bubbles by carefully withdrawing the microloader tip while releasing the solution into the capillary. Carefully break the tip of the needle with a forceps.\nRegulate the drop size with a pneumatic pico pump. Measure the drop diameter/volume (V = 4/3πr3) and adjust the drop size with an ocular micrometer under a stereoscope in dimethylpolysiloxane. We recommend 100 μm, corresponding to 0.5 nl. This assures uniform and reproducible concentrations per each injected embryo. Titrate the injected concentration and adjust for each construct and plasmid preparation.\nPlace the zygotes (Figure 1A) obtained from a cross of Tg(UAS:eGFP-HRASG12V)io006 15 with Tg(lysC:dsRed2)nz50Tg 16 into the molds of the injection plate by use of a 3 ml pastette. Meanwhile, keep the tip of the pre prepared injection needle in dimethylpolysiloxane to avoid the solution from drying up and clotting.",
    "Inject the premeasured drop (100 μm corresponding to 0.5 nl) under a stereoscope through the chorion into the blastodisc17, prior to the first cleavage (Figure 1A). Injection into the one-cell stage increases the potential of a uniform distribution of the plasmid DNA and RNA in the developing cell mass and the possibility for germline transmission. It is notable that the expression of constructs more often tends to be mosaic.\n3. Conditional Skin Cell Transformation by 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)\nTransfer the injected embryos into 0.3x Danieau solution and keep them at 28.5 °C in an incubator. Remove unfertilized eggs from the dish at sphere stage17. The co-injected Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran can be utilized as an injection-control under a fluorescent stereoscope.\nScreen embryos at 24 hpf (hr post fertilization) for cardiac expression of eGFP. Continue to raise cmlc:eGFP positive zebrafish embryos until 72 hpf. Carefully monitor the water-quality (0.3x Danieau).\nRemove the chorion of those embryos that have not hatched with forceps at 72 hpf. Carefully poke the chorion with 1 forceps and pull it apart by using the other. Select embryos for lysC:dsRed2 expression using a fluorescent stereoscope.\nAdd 10 μl of a 10 mM stock of (Z)-4-Hydroxytamoxifen to 20 ml of 0.3x Danieau solution (final concentration of 5 μM). Use the 4-OHT induction-solution for one standard Petri dish (90 mm) on a batch of 40-60 embryos.\nTransfer the embryos into a new Petri dish containing 20 ml of freshly made induction-solution. 4-OHT has to be stored and handled in the dark. The first signs of expression may be detected 2 hr post induction commencement. The induction-step can be extended overnight, keeping in mind that initial host cell: preneoplastic cell interactions can already occur a few hours after treatment.\n4. Mounting and Live Imaging of Zebrafish Larvae",
    "Prepare a 60 mm Petri dish by introducing a hole with a diameter of 18-20 mm. Use high-vacuum silicone grease to cover and seal the hole on the outer bottom of the Petri dish with a 25 mm cover glass (Figure 1B).\nPrepare 1% low melting point (LMP) agarose. Keep one 1.5 ml tube of LMP agarose at 37 °C in a heating block.\nPreselect Tg(krt4:KalTA4-ERT2;UAS:eGFP-HRASG12V;lysC:dsRed2) larvae for green fluorescent skin cell and dsRed2 positive innate immune cell expression, under a fluorescent stereoscope. Anesthetize larvae by the addition of 1 ml of 0.4% tricaine18 to the 20 ml induction solution.\nTransfer the preselected larvae with a pastette into the liquid LMP agarose. Let the larvae sink into the LMP agarose and transfer them onto the cover glass (Figure 1B). Orientate the embryos under a stereoscope. The larvae have to be placed directly onto the glass to reduce the working distance (up to 6 larvae).\nCover the LMP agarose with the tricaine containing induction solution after it has hardened (Figure 1B arrow).\nImage the embedded larvae using an inverted fluorescent, laser-scanning or spinning disc confocal microscope. Use a 40X or 63X objective as objectives with long working distances enable focusing through the entire larvae."
