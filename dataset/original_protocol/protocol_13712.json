    "All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas (IPN; Protocol No. 2732).\n1. Preparation of the extract of the combination of cloves and cumin\nNOTE: The edible plants, Syzygium aromaticum (clove) and Cuminum cyminum (cumin) were purchased from Central de Abastos CDMX, Mexico.\nGrind 500 g of seeds from the plants and perform ultrasonic-assisted extraction. Sonicate them (320 Watts; 24 kHz frequency, 30 min) with ethanol:water (60:40 v/v) at a temperature range of 30 ± 4 °C.13\nFilter the solids using Whatman number 2 filter paper under vacuum and concentrate the extract with a rotary evaporator.\nMeasure the UV-vis spectrum of the extract of both plants (CC).\n2. Animals\nUse male C57BL6/J mice of six weeks old (48 in total, body weight 24-29 g) for the study.\nHouse the animals in groups of eight in standard laboratory conditions: temperature (20-22 ± 1 °C), relative humidity (45-54 ± 2%), lighting (08:00-20:00 h) with food and water ad libitum. Acclimate the mice in these conditions for a week before the experiment.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nPrepare the high fat diet14 as in Table 1.\nAt the beginning of the test, subject each of the groups formed (n = 8) to different treatments: Feed Group 1 on a normal diet; Group 2, on high-fat diet; Group 3, on high-fat diet + 100 mg/kg of CC extract; Group 4, on high-fat diet + 250 mg/kg of CC extract; Group 5, on high-fat diet + 450 mg/kg of CC extract; Group 6, on high-fat diet + phentermine (an antiobesity drug used as positive control)15.\nFeed all the groups of mice for 5 weeks and record the amount of food consumed daily.",
    "In a test tube with stopper, homogenize the extract or the drug with the dose of water corresponding to the group to which the treatment is being administered. This is done with vortex shaker.\nOnce homogenized, add all the corresponding treatment into the drinker of each group.\n4. Sample collection\nMeasure both food intake and body weight once per week. Fast the mice overnight for a 5-week period.\nSacrifice them by cervical dislocation and necropsy.\nAfter the mice have been sacrificed, immobilize them in a supine position.\nUsing clean surgical forceps and scissors, locate and lift the central skin near the genitals and make a small 0.2 mm incision.\nInsert the flat scissors horizontally into the incision and carefully separate the abdominal skin from the abdominal wall.\nWith the forceps, lift the central skin and with the surgical scissors cut it at the level of the rib cage. Then cut the skin above both of the hind limbs to facilitate the collection of adipose tissue.\nEnsure the collection of all adipose tissue from the body by blunt dissection with scissors and forceps. Once collected, place the adipose tissue in aluminum foil. Remember to collect the fat around the reproductive organs. Avoid the accumulation of hair and skin to not alter the results.\nTo access the visceral adipose tissue, cut the abdominal muscle with surgical scissors from the genitals to the rib cage, making an incision in the abdominal muscles from the genitals towards the mouse's back.\nPerform a hepatectomy to remove 100% of the liver. To externalize the liver, remove unnecessary organs and cut the hepatic veins and arteries to separate the liver from the rest of the body. As the last step, precisely extract the gallbladder from the liver16.",
    "Measure hypercholesterolemia (cholesterol) and hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides) using commercial assay kits according to the manufacturer's indications.\n5. Statistical analysis\nNOTE: All experimental results should be representative from three independent assays, expressed as mean ± standard deviation.\nCalculate standard error with a one-way ANOVA analysis of variance followed by Tukey's range test. Consider a P< 0.05 as statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
