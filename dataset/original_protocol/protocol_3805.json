    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLung homogenate preparation\nTiming: 2.5 h\nTwo weeks after naphthalene treatment, prepare the lung homogenates needed for the co-culture from Acta2-Cre-ERT2; tdTomatoflox mice and Scgb1a1Cre-ERT; tdTomatoflox mice.\nNote: Female 12- to 14-week-old Scgb1a1Cre-ERT; tdTomatoflox mice can be used without tamoxifen treatment.\nEuthanize animals by exposure to CO2 followed by cervical dislocation.\nSterilize the mouse thorax and abdomen with 80% ethanol.\nOpen the thoracic cavity to expose the lungs and heart using surgical scissors.\nUse a 25 G needle to perfuse the lungs with 20 mL of sterile Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Life Technologies) through the right ventricle until the lungs are free of blood.\nLung harvest:\nTo obtain lung cell suspensions from Acta2-Cre-ERT2; tdTomatoflox mice:\nHarvest the lungs and cut them into small pieces (∼2 mm) in a small petri dish using a blade.\nPlace the lung pieces in 15 mL Falcon tubes and incubate in 5 mL of 0.5% collagenase type IV in HBSS for 45 min at 37°C while rotating.\nTo obtain lung cell suspensions from Scgb1a1Cre-ERT; tdTomatoflox mice:\nMake a small incision in the exposed trachea to insert a shortened 21 G cannula (firmly fixed).\nInstill 1.5 mL of dispase through the trachea.\nRemove the cannula and immediately tie the trachea using a surgical suture.\nHarvest the lungs and place them in separate Eppendorf tubes containing 2 mL of dispase\nIncubate for 40 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the trachea and heart using surgical scissors.\nHomogenize the lungs in 10 mL of digestion medium using GentleMACS® Dissociator (MACS Miltenyi Biotech).\nCritical: Be careful not to digest lungs longer than 45 min. This could lead to significant loss of cells.\nFilter the homogenates through 70 μm and 40 μm nylon cell strainers (BD Biosciences).",
    "Centrifuge at 500 ×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: Wash the filters using 5 mL of DMEM if necessary.\nNote: The optimal yield expected at this stage for both cell types is between 15 ×106 to 30×106 cells per lung.\nPrimary cell isolation\nTiming: 3 h\nAfter the preparation of Acta2-Cre-ERT2; tdTomatoflox and Scgb1a1Cre-ERT; tdTomatoflox lung cell suspensions, use a cell sorter (For e.g., BD FACSAria™ III) to isolate mesenchymal and club cells, respectively.\nStain Acta2-Cre-ERT2; tdTomatoflox cells\nResuspend cells in 50 μL of anti-PDGFRα antibodies (1:100) or isotype control in MACS buffer for 20 min on ice in the dark.\nWash cells with 100 μL of MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge cells at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of MACS buffer.\nResuspend the cell suspension obtained from Scgb1a1Cre-ERT; tdTomatoflox mice in 300 μL of MACS buffer.\nFilter cells with a final volume of 500 μL of MACS buffer using 40 μm mesh into FACS tubes for cell sorting.\nSet the appropriate gating strategy (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/724-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gating strategy for sorting mesenchymal and epithelial cell populations\n(A) Representative flow cytometric dot plots of isotype control and PDGFRα and tdTomato expression in mesenchymal cells isolated from lung homogenates of Acta2-Cre-ERT2; tdTomatoflox mice 14 days after naphthalene injury.\n(B) Representative flow cytometric dot plots of tdTomato expression in club cells isolated from lung homogenates of Scgb1a1Cre-ERT; tdTomatoflox mice.\nIsolate PDGFRα+ tdTom+ cells from the lung homogenates of Acta2-Cre-ERT2; tdTomatoflox mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nIsolate tdTom+ cells from the lung homogenates of Scgb1a1Cre-ERT; tdTomatoflox mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nPerform cell sorting into FACS tubes containing 350 μL organoid medium using an 85 μm nozzle (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).",
    "Note: The expected viability post-sort is around 96% for mesenchymal cells and 86% for club cells.\nOrganoid culture\nTiming: 14 days\nFollowing cell isolation, co-culture mesenchymal and epithelial cells for 14 days to generate bronchiolospheres.\nCentrifuge flow-sorted cells for 5 min, 500 × g at 4°C.\nResuspend the cells in organoid medium.\nAdjust cell concentrations as follows:\n2×104 PDGFRα+ tdTom+ cells per 25 μL of medium per cell culture insert.\n1×103 SCGB1A1+ cells per 25 μL of medium per cell culture insert.\nNote: The expected number of sorted cells per mouse is ∼15,000 PDGFRα+ tdTom+ mesenchymal cells and ∼100,000 SCGB1A1+ club cells.\nNote: For each culture, between 15,000 and 20,000 mesenchymal cells and a minimum of 5,000 epithelial cells are required.\nCritical: It is advisable to perform a cell viability and quantification assay before the culture if the total number of isolated cells is lower than expected.\nMix both cell populations to end up with a volume of 50 μL of organoid medium per insert.\nDilute PDGFRα+ tdTom+ cells and SCGB1A1+ cells in 50 μL (per insert) with cold growth factor-reduced Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio as described before (Quantius et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nCritical: Mix well but carefully to avoid bubble formation.\nCritical: Work as fast as possible to avoid Matrigel polymerization in the tube.\nAdd 100 μL of mixed cells in Matrigel on top of a 12-mm cell culture insert.\nNote: Add the cell mixture drop by drop placing the pipette in the middle of the insert to ensure cell dispersion into the entire insert.\nPlace inserts in a 24-well plate.\nIncubate for 15 min at 37°C to allow Matrigel polymerization.\nRemove the insert and add 350 μL of organoid medium into each well.",
    "Critical: Add ROCK inhibitor at a concentration of 10 μM to the organoid medium for 14–18 h, then change to regular organoid medium.\nPlace back the insert into the well containing the organoid medium and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for at least 2 weeks.\nChange medium three times per week for at least 14 days to generate bronchiolospheres (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nNote: Bronchiolospheres can be kept in culture for at least 4 weeks."
