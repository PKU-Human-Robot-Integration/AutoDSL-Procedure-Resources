Further, this section describes in detail the procedures for time-lapse imaging of the same sample at desired time-points. We used a Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM) 880 upright confocal module equipped with the ZEN black edition software for image capture.\nPreparation of sample for imaging.\nOn the 8th -15th day of SIM incubation of the callus, cut out 0.25 cm–0.5 cm of green portions using pre-sterilized and cooled Vanna’s micro-scissors within the LAF (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPlace the excised portion (referred to as sample from hereon) at the center of a 35 mm sterile petri-dish containing 3 mL of solid SIM medium within the LAF (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSample fixation.\nCool down a drop of 0.75%–0.8% molten agar to approximately 37°C and place it next to the sample.\nUsing a sterile micro-tip, drag the droplet towards the sample and let it seal the sample from all sides.\nNote: Doing this will fix the sample to the SIM plate, but the top surface of the sample remains free of agar (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: If the molten agar used for sealing is too hot, it will de-localize the PIN1-GFP from the membrane and potentially damage the sample (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: Care should be taken to avoid the agar from fully encapsulating the sample (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nImaging of the sample.\nWipe the working area, the stage, and the controller of the microscope with 70% ethanol to ensure aseptic conditions.",
    "Turn on the power of the laser-scanning confocal microscopy system (we used Zeiss LSM 880) and initialize through the integrated imaging software (we used ZEN2.3 SP1 black edition) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2549-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Scale bar: 50 μm.\nAdd 5 mL of 20 μg/mL PI stain to the SIM containing 35 mm petri-dish and allow the sample to stain for 20 min before draining it out (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2549-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The schematic demonstrating the entire procedure for imaging of a progenitor\nNote: Do not wash away the PI stain before imaging, as it will lead to reduced fluorescence (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nOptional: PI staining is optional. Use only if you want to see the cell boundary.\nPlace the 35 mm petri-dish with the sample on to the universal mounting frame (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].5).\nCritical: Orient the petri-dish to ensure that the arrow marked on its side aligns with the edge of the left slider of the universal mounting frame. Doing so will ensure the placing of the petri-dish the same orientation for subsequent imaging sessions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].5).\nGo to the “Acquisition Interface” (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. A).\nClick on “Show All Tools” located at the top of the “Acquisition” interface.\nUnder “Setup Manager”, choose the lasers “Argon and DPSS 561” and turn them ON.\nClick on the dropdown menu for “Imaging Set Up”. Click on “Channels” and choose to switch track every “Frame”",
    "From “Track 1” choose the sensitive channel “Ch2m” for GFP and “Ch3” for chlorophyll autofluorescence.\nKeep emission range of 488 laser at 490 nm–510 nm for GFP (green pseudo-color) and 650–750 nm for chlorophyll autofluorescence (blue pseudo-color) (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2549_10.csv\nChoose the Main Beam Splitter “488/561”.\nCheck the “T-PMT”\nClick on “Add a new track” (represented as “+”). A new track will appear as “Track 2”. Choose the sensitive channel “Ch2m” for GFP and “Ch3” for chlorophyll autofluorescence.\nKeep emission range of 514 laser at 525 nm–550 nm for YFP (magenta pseudo- color) and 650–700 nm for chlorophyll autofluorescence (blue pseudo-color) (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nChoose the Main Beam, Splitter “458/514/594”\nAgain, click on “+”. A new track will appear as “Track 3”. Choose the sensitive channel “Ch2m” for PI stain.\nKeep emission range of 561 laser at 580 nm–610 nm for PI stain (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: Ensure that the emission spectra of chlorophyll autofluorescence does not overlap with that of PI (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nOptional: This step (3.k) can be skipped if the sample is not stained with PI.\nGo to “Acquisition Parameter”. Select “Acquisition Mode”. Click on “Objective” and choose 10 × objective. Focus the sample under the 10× objective (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].4).\nFrom “Scan Area” adjust the digital “zoom” to 0.6.\nGo to “Channels”.\nCheck “Track 1” and “Track 3” and proceed to check excitation lasers 488 and 561 respectively. Set the laser power for 488 nm and 561 nm to 50.\nIn Track 1, set Gain (Master) for Ch2m (channel corresponding to GFP), Ch3 (channel corresponding to chlorophyll autofluorescence), and T-PMT (channel corresponding to Brightfield) to 750, 650 and 170 respectively.\nIn Track 3, set the Gain (Master) for Ch2m (Channel corresponding to PI) to 650. Set Digital Gain to 1 for all four channels.",
    "Then check “Track 2”, and proceed to check excitation laser 514. Set the laser power for 514 nm to 50. Set Gain (Master) for Ch2m, Ch3, and T-PMT to 750, 650 and 170 respectively. Set Digital Gain to 1 for all three channels.\nAdjust the pinhole to 1Airy Unit by clicking on “1AU”, and increase as required while imaging.\nUncheck all Tracks except Track 1. Go to “Experiment Manager” and click “Live” and scan for the progenitors which are tagged with pPIN1::gPIN1-GFP.\nThe progenitors will be seen as small green areas against the chlorophyll autofluorescence (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUse the stage control joystick (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) or other stage movement control to scan through the sample visually.\nOnce the progenitors are spotted, set the work position for the stage by selecting the “set work position” option from the controller (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). This will ensure that the sample does not go beyond the set position to touch the objective.\nCritical: While setting the work position, care should be taken to prevent the sample from touching the objective above, thereby not damaging the sample.\nThen go to “Acquisition Mode” on the software, select “Averaging” and set “Number” to 1 (line averaging).\nUsing the stage control joystick, bring the progenitor to the center of the imaging frame (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].6).\nThen, go to “Acquisition Mode”, select “Frame Size” and set it to 512 × 512 and capture an image at scan speed 6 for location reference.\nLabel the progenitors in the captured images for future location references as L1, L2… (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCarefully bring the stage down without disturbing the petri-dish from its position and pipette 5 mL of filter-sterilized PI into the petri-dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].7).",
    "Optional: 5 mL of Autoclaved Milli-Q water can be used instead of PI, if visualization of cell boundary is not required.\nCritical: Care should be taken to avoid touching the petri-dish, while adding the PI/Milli-Q water as it should not be moved from its position or orientation.\nCritical: The lens of 40× water-dipping objective and its ceramic collar should be wiped with methanol before imaging to prevent the contamination of the sample.\nGo to “Acquisition Parameter”. Select “Acquisition Mode”. Click on “Objective” and choose 40 × water-dipping objective (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].8).\nBring the stage back up using fast auto focus. Then using the fine adjustment, focus the sample under 40× (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].9).\nBring the progenitor to the center of the frame using the stage control joystick.\nScan the enlarged progenitor and adjust the imaging parameters as following: laser power:50%, Increase pinhole up to 3 Airy Scan Units (AU) if needed, Gain (Master): 650–700. Digital offset: 1, Frame size: 1024 × 1024, Digital zoom 0.6, scan speed: 5 and line averaging 2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].10).\nNote: Exact gain, AU, and laser power may vary for any given progenitor, depending upon the brightness of fluorescence. Adjust the Gain (Master) just below the fluorescence saturation.\nTo set the z-positions, go to “Experiment Manager”, check the “Z-stack” option. This will allow the z-position dropdown menu to pop-up.\nUsing the fine focus adjustment, fast scan the z-position only with Track 1 until the progenitor cells are just out of focus and click on “Set first”.\nThen focus through the sample in the opposite direction, until the progenitor cells are once again out of focus and click on “Set last” (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nRepeat using Track 2. This will allow the capturing the entire progenitor and the non-progenitor cells surrounding it.",
    "In the “Z-stack” pop-up window, set the interval (step size) to 1μm (for polarity quantifications), or 5μm (for time lapse imaging of the same progenitor for several days across multiple intervals) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].11).\nTo capture the image, go to “Acquisition” interface. From “Experiment Manager”, click on “Start Experiment” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].12).\nNote: Ensure all the three tracks turned on before clicking on “Start experiment”.\nCritical: The parameter setting and image capture under 40× objective with PI stain should be done by working fast. This is to prevent the sample from overstaining during the course of imaging (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nNote: Do not expose the sample to laser for long periods, as it will de-localize the PIN1-GFP from the membrane (Trouble shooting 1).\nSave the captured z-stack image as .czi format. The Z-stacks can be reconstructed into a projection view with Zeiss LSM software.\nDrain the PI (or Milli-Q water, in case sample was unstained) using a pipette.\nTake out the petri-dish, and wash the fixed sample with 5 mL of autoclaved Milli-Q water 2–3 times before sealing the petri-dish with PhytaWrap and keeping it back in the growth chamber.\nNote: Wash the sample by pipetting Milli-Q water gently along the sides of the 35 mm petri-dish, so as not to dislodge the sample.\nRepeat steps from 3a-3v every 24 h (or as frequently as needed).\nEnsure that the imaging parameters remain identical for one progenitor throughout the time course. To do so, open the first image of the time lapse series for a progenitor, go to “Dimensions”, click on “Reuse” to apply the same settings as those described for the first-image of the time lapse series (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: The command for “Dimensions” is just below the main imaging frame.",
    "Critical: Ensure that the petri-dish is placed on the microscope stage in the same orientation each time (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].5). Use the image captured under 10× for finer adjustment of orientation and as a terrain map for reference (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].6).\nAlternative approach for imaging of the sample.\nNote: This step provides an alternative to capture the image with Milli-Q water instead of PI under 40× water dipping objective. This will override the risk of overstaining the sample during imaging.\nCapture the image with 40× water dipping objective while keeping the sample submerged in Milli-Q water.\nTo perform this, turn on the power of the laser-scanning confocal microscopy system and initialize through the integrated imaging software.\nAdd 5 mL of 20 μg/mL PI stain to the SIM containing 35 mm petri-dish and allow the sample to stain for 30 min before draining it out.\nNote: Allow the sample to stain for 30 min, as opposed to 20 min in the previous section.\nPlace the 35 mm petri-dish with the sample on to the universal mounting frame.\nCritical: Orient the petri-dish to ensure that the arrow marked on its side aligns with the edge of the left slider of the universal mounting frame. Doing so will ensure the placing of the petri-dish the same orientation for subsequent imaging sessions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].5).\nFrom here on, follow the instructions in the previous section in the exact same manner until 3.o of “Imaging of the sample[href=https://www.wicell.org#p0255]”.\nThen, carefully bring the stage down without disturbing the petri-dish from its position and pipette 5 mL of Autoclaved Milli-Q water.\nNote: Add 5 mL of Milli-Q instead of PI stain.\nCritical: Take care to avoid touching the petri-dish, while adding the Milli-Q water as the petri-dish should not be moved from its position or orientation.",
    "Continue to follow the instruction from the previous section in the exact same manner from 3.p to 3.v of “Imaging of the sample[href=https://www.wicell.org#p0255]”\nCritical: The parameter setting and image capture under 40× objective with Milli-Q water should be done by working fast. This is to prevent the sample from getting de-stained during the course of imaging.\nPIN1 polarity mapping and quantification\nTiming: 30 min\nThis is a detailed approach to calculating PIN1 polarity qualitatively and quantitatively. In this approach, we use Fiji/ImageJ software to quantify the pixel intensity of PIN1-GFP along the plasma membrane of each selected cell individually. The tools in Fiji/ImageJ allow to calculate area, distance, angle, and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections. We perform the quantification in two steps to get an accurate reading of the signal intensity. First, we define regions of the plasma membrane and measure the pixel intensity for each of the selections. Second, we extract the positions of each of the selections on the plasma membrane. This will allow us to locate the side of the cell corresponding to each selection. We can plot a graph of the pixel intensity against its exact position on the plasma membrane from the two sets of measurements and analyze the localization pattern of PIN1-GFP. The side of the cell with the highest peak of signal intensity corresponds to the side with the PIN1-GFP polarity.\nQuantify the signal intensity and map the localization pattern of PIN1-GFP from the captured z-stack of the progenitor.\nTo perform this, acquire a z-stack image of a progenitor with 1 μm step size in .czi format or .lsm format and open it using the Zen Image processing software. We used Zen 2.3 SP1 Black edition.",
    "Note: The boundary of the cells in the image should be conspicuous, and marked with a membrane reporter such as PI.\nNote: Since we quantify one cell at a time, all the sides of the selected cell should be conspicuous, with no interference from overlaying or underlying cells. The information for one cell can be extracted by acquired through subsets.\nTo take a subset, go to “Processing”. From the drop-down option under “Method”, click on “Copy”. Choose “Subset” from the drop-down options (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2549-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Extracting a subset of z-positions from a complete set of Z-stack\n(A and B) The screenshot detailing the steps to be followed to extract the desired set of z-positions from a complete z-stack. The numbers denote the order of commands to be followed.\nGo to “Method Parameters” and click on the “Select” option corresponding to the file name of your input image. This will display all the X, Y and Z coordinates of the input image (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nGo to “Dimensions” and choose the z-positions, for instance 16–22 that span only through the cell you want to quantify, using the slider corresponding to the “Z-position” or the up/down arrow buttons.\nThen go to “Z” under “Method Parameters”. Adjust the “Start” and “End” to the z-positions you chose, for instance “16” and “22” respectively. This can be done either by the slider or the up/down arrow buttons or by simply typing “16” and “22”.\nClick on “Apply” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: A subset having only the chosen z-positions of the input image will be created.\nConvert the subset image into TIFF format or JPEG format.\nGo to “File” on the toolbar, and choose “Export” from the drop-down options.",
    "A pop-up window will open. Choose “Tagged Image File” or “JPEG File Interchange Format” from the drop-down options corresponding to “Format”.\nClick “Select File Name and Save”\nNote: A JPEG images are lossy in nature . We therefore recommend to use the TIFF format.\nOpen the TIFF image in ImageJ/Fiji software (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2549-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Select the channel for PI (blue). Zoom into the image to focus on a single cell which is to be quantified for polarity.\nGo to the toolbar and select “Freehand Selections” tool. Using the tool, draw a boundary over the cell membrane of the chosen cell in the PI channel window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nGo to “Analyse” and choose “Set Measurements”. Check ‘Centroid’ option from the window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nNote: Centroid is the geometric centre point of a cell.\nGo to “Analyse” option in the tool bar and select “Measure”. A separate “Results” window will appear.\nThe X and Y axis values provided will be the centroid of the cell. Note down the centroid coordinates (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nClose the channel for PI (blue) and the results window.\nSelect the channel for PIN1-GFP (green). Then select the “Brush Tool” from the toolbar.\nWith the brush tool, mark the centroid of the cell using the centroid coordinates measured in step 5.m.\nChoose a color to mark this point (e.g.,: white) for your future reference (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nAlternatives: The “Pencil Tool” can also be used for marking the centroid.\nMark another point exactly above the centroid using the “Brush Tool” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\nNote: Ensure that the X- axis value is same as that of the centroid.\nNote: choose a color other than white, for instance red to mark the point above the centroid.\nSelect the “Multipoint Tool” from the tool bar. Use the tool to mark multiple points along the PIN1-GFP marked cell membrane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\nCritical: Space the points as close as possible.\nNote: Choose a different color, for instance yellow for marking multiple points.\nNote: The number of multipoint per cell depends on the span of cell membrane or the size of the cell.",
    "Save the snapshot of the cell marked with multipoints.\nTo set up the measurement parameter to quantify the PIN1-GFP signal corresponding to each multipoint on the membrane, go to “Analyze”, and click on “Set Measurements”.\nSelect “Mean Gray value” from the pop-up window and click “OK”.\nGo to “Analyze” and click on “Measure” or press “Ctrl + M”.\nA “Result” window will open up that contains the Mean Gray Value of the GFP signal corresponding to each multipoint on the membrane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J).\nCopy the entire measurement data from the “Result” window and paste it in a new excel sheet.\nClose all windows and open the previously saved snapshot of the cell marked with multipoints (refer to step 5.q) in Fiji/ImageJ (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K).\nSelect the “Angle Tool” from the tool bar of the Fiji window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K).\nUsing the cursor, click on the red dot, white dot (centroid) and yellow dot (1st measurement point marked using multipoint tool) respectively (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K).\nNote: it is important to click on the dots in the exact same order to measure the angle.\nGo to “Analyze” and click on “Measure”. The Results window appears displaying the value of angle between the three dots.\nRepeat the step 5.v for the rest of the measurement points 2,3,4, etc (rest of the yellow dots), one at a time in clockwise direction.\nOnce the values of angles are calculated for each of the measurement points, copy and paste the values to the excel sheet.\nNote: Ensure that the value of angle for a measurement point correspond to the previously measured Gray Value for the same point.\nNote: The red dot is defined as 0˚/360 ˚ angle. The angle should be calculated from the positive Y axis in the clock wise direction.",

    "(B) Zoomed in image of the progenitor. Steps 1–2 are directions to draw arrow to denote direction of PIN1-polar localization. Yellow double headed arrow denotes the inward curvature of the cell “I”. If the membrane with maximum signal intensity is curved inward a cell, then the membrane belongs to that cell itself. Red arrows mark direction of PIN1-GFP polarity.\nNote: Since adjacent cells are adhered together, it is difficult to determine which cell the membrane with the maximum signal intensity belongs to. Determine the curvature of the cell membrane to override this issue.\nGo to the side of the cell with maximum signal intensity and check the curvature of the side (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B). If the side is curved inwards with respect to a cell, for instance cell “I”, then the membrane with maximum signal intensity belongs to cell “I”. If not, it belongs to the adjacent cell.\nRepeat step 6.i for all cells.\nThe direction of polarity corresponds to the side of the cell with maximum signal intensity.\nTargeted laser ablation of cells\nTiming: 30 min (for steps 7 to 10)\nThis section describes the detailed procedure to ablate targeted plant cells using laser, and to do the follow-up imaging.\nPre-ablation imaging.\nFollow steps 3a- 3v from “time-lapse imaging of progenitor[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]” to capture a pre-ablation z-stack image with 40× water dipping objective (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: The track for PI can be kept off, if the target cell expresses a fluorescent reporter and does not require PI staining to identify the cell boundary.\nLocating prospective target cells.\nLocating Progenitor cells for ablation.\nFor ablation of progenitor cell (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A–8D), go to “Acquisition Parameter”, and choose “Channels”.

Yellow dotted ellipse indicates the site of ablation. Fluorescent puncta at the site of ablation represent the autofluorescence emitted from cell debris. Scale bars: 50 μm (A, C–E, G, and H), 10 μm (B and F). Reprinted from Varapparambath et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: Turn on “Track 3” also if you have used PI staining.\nGo to “Experiment Manager”, and click on “Live” to quick scan through the progenitors to choose the target cell (any of the GFP expressing progenitor cell).\nOnce the target cell is decided, position it to the center of the frame using the stage control joystick and click “Start Experiment” to capture a z-stack image of the progenitor (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nNote: The point of ablation should be on or near any landmark for instance, a shoot which can be easily recognized under a microscope. We recommend any fluorescently, labelled landmark (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nNote: Capture the image at Frame Size 1024 × 1024 and “1.2” zoom.\nThen click ‘New’, followed by quick scan again.\nGo to “Dimensions” and click “Crop” to zoom into the center of the target cell such that the cell fills the entire frame (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).",
    "Alternatives: You can also use the “zoom” option under “Scan Area” to zoom into the target cell.\nNote: the digital zoom will fall between 35-40 as the cell size varies from cell to cell. At this zoom level, the GFP will bleach rapidly. Minimize laser exposure time by working quickly.\nFor locating non-progenitor cells for ablation.\nFor ablation of a non-progenitor cells (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]E–8H), go to “Acquisition Parameter”, and choose “Channels”. Under “Channels”, deselect all tracks except for “Track 2” (corresponding to YFP).\nClick on “Live” to quick scan through the progenitors to choose the target cell (any of the YFP expressing non-progenitor cell).\nRepeat steps 8.a.iii to 8.a.v of “Locating Progenitor cells for ablation”.\nLaser ablation of a cell.\nGo to “Setup Manager” on the “Acquisition” interface and turn ON the laser “405” (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nGo to “Imaging Set Up”, click on “Add a new track” (represented as “+”).\nFrom “Track 4”, Check the channel corresponding to “Ch1” detector.\nGo to “Dye” corresponding to “ch1” detector, click on the drop-down menu provided and select “DAPI”.\nNote: Keep the remaining two channels (Ch2m and Ch3) in Track 4 unchecked.\nGo to “Range” corresponding to “ch1” detector, and keep the emission range at 409 nm–465 nm.\nChoose the “Main Beam Splitter” (MBS) “405”.\nGo to “Acquisition parameters”, choose “channels” and Check only Track 4 (DAPI).\nGo to “Lasers” below “Channels”. A check box will be displayed against each of the lasers: 405, 458, 488, 514, 561, 633.\nCheck the box corresponding to “405”.\nIncrease the laser power of 405 nm to 80%, either by sliding the slider, or by typing in “80” manually, or by clicking on the arrow button corresponding to the 405 nm laser.\nSet pinhole to 1AU, by clicking on the “1AU” button.",
    "Set Gain (Master) for Ch1 to 800.\nNote: Keep Track 1, Track 2 and Track 3 unchecked.\nSet a timer for 30 s.\nGo to “Experiment Manager” and click on “Continuous” to activate continuous scanning. Start the timer simultaneously.\nStop scanning immediately at 30 s, give an interval of 30 s, and follow up with a 30 s continuous scan again.\nNote: Choose an easily accessible cell, preferably one which is on the surface. This will help prevent damaging the cell above during ablation. Start with two pulses of 30 s with 30 s resting interval. You can fine then tune the ablation time to suit the cell type, and age of the cell (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nPost ablation imaging and time-lapse microscopy to study regeneration.\nIf ablation was done on GFP expressing progenitor cell;\nGo to “Acquisition Parameter”, choose “Channels” (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nUncheck the Track 4 (corresponding to DAPI) to inactivate the laser 405 used for ablation.\nCheck the box corresponding to Track 1 (corresponding to GFP) to turn it ON.\nGo to “Acquisition Mode” under “Acquisition Parameters”. From there go to “Scan Area” and decrease the “Zoom” to 1.2 either by using the slider or by typing in “1.2.”\nTo ensure successful cell ablation, increase the Gain (Master) to 800 and fast scan the field of view by clicking on “Live”.\nNote: No GFP expression should be visible within the targeted cell. If fluorescence is still observed, return to steps 9c to 9f of “Laser ablation of a cell”.\nNote: that the green puncta seen in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C is the autofluorescence from debris of ablated cell. The debris clears atmost by 48 Hours, after which GFP fluorescence in puncta will not be observed.\nRepeat the ablation steps for as many cells as desired.",
    "To capture a post ablation image, open the pre-ablation image captured. Then go to “Dimensions” and click on “Reuse”.\nNote: This will apply the same settings as those described for pre-ablation imaging.\nSet the “Set First” and “Set Last” of the z-stack.\nGo to “Experiment Manager” and click on “Start Experiment” to capture the post ablation z-stack image.\nNote: Ensure to keep all the imaging parameters identical to the pre-ablation image.\nSave the post-ablation image as .czi format or .lsm format (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]D).\nNote: If the image reveals remnants of fluorescent cells or additional cell bodies that needs to be removed, repeat the laser ablation steps to create a visible gap. Inspect the T-PMT channel image to further confirm cellular damage.\nBring down the stage and drain the PI/Milli-Q water using a pipette. Take out the petri-dish, and wash the sample with autoclaved Milli-Q water 2–3 times.\nThen seal the petri-dish with PhytaWrap and keep it back in the growth chamber until next imaging.\nFollow instructions stated in steps 3.a to 3.v of “Imaging of the sample[href=https://www.wicell.org#p0255]” to capture a time-series of post ablation images of the same sample.\nCritical: The time interval between each image of the time series after the ablation should be short enough to track the dividing cells (not be more than 5 Hours in this case). This is because, with higher number of cell divisions, tracing the point of ablation will become increasingly difficult (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nIf ablation was done on non-progenitor cell;\nGo to “Acquisition Parameters”, choose “Channels”.\nUncheck the Track 4 (corresponding to DAPI) to inactivate the laser 405 used for ablation.\nCheck the box corresponding to Track 2 (corresponding to YFP) to turn it ON.\nRepeat steps 10.a.iv to 10.a.xii. (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]H).",
    "Note: The fluorescent puncta seen at the site of ablation in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]G is the autofluorescence from debris of ablated cell. The debris clears atmost by 48 Hours, after which it will not fluorescence."
