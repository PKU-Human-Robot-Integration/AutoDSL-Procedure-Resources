    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHyperosmotic stress\nTiming: 90 min\nThis section describes how to expose freely swimming zebrafish larvae to hyperosmotic stress prior to immunostaining (described in this protocol) or other types of staining, such as HCR in situ hybridization (Choi et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The protocol described here was optimized for 5 dpf zebrafish larvae.\nNote: Administration of a hypertonic solution is an established stressor for zebrafish larvae. In this protocol, we treated zebrafish larvae with NaCl at a final concentration of 100 mM. Higher or lower concentrations of NaCl might also be used (Yeh et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; De Marco et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCritical: We advise to be consistent with the timing of the experiments as production of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh), which is responsible for the activation of the stress axis, was shown to fluctuate during the day (Yeh, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). Therefore, it is likely that neurons modulating stress are affected. For this protocol the experiments were performed in the early afternoon.\nApproximately 75 min prior to the experiment, transfer 20 to 25 larvae to a new Petri dish (60 mm diameter) using a 3 mL plastic pipette.\nGently tilt the Petri dish and remove as much Danieau’s medium as possible.\nRapidly fill the Petri dish with 13 mL of fresh Danieau’s medium.\nNote: We add 13 mL instead of 15 mL of medium as approximately 2 mL will remain in the tilted Petri dish during this procedure.\nLeave the Petri dish containing the zebrafish larvae at room temperature on the bench for 60 min under light conditions before the experiment.\nNote: In this way, the animals will have enough time to recover from potential stress received during the transfer procedure.",
    "Critical: Prior to the experiment the larvae should not be disturbed. If possible, place the Petri dishes on a vibration-free table as even touching the bench might cause vibrations in the water, which could stress the fish.\nUsing a serological pipette add 15 mL of Danieau’s solution to one Petri dish (control group) and 15 mL of 200 mM NaCl in Danieau’s medium to the other Petri dish (stressed group).\nNote: In this way, each petri dish will contain a final volume of 30 mL. We distribute the solution with the pipette evenly across the Petri dish, and do not swirl the dish.\nAfter 10 min add 1.3 mL of tricaine to each Petri dish and rapidly transfer the larvae to two different 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nRemove all the solution inside the microcentrifuge tubes and replace it with 1 mL of 4% PFA/PBT.\nNote: You can spin down the microcentrifuge tubes and use a glass Pasteur to rapidly remove the solution and avoid that the larvae stick to the plastic walls of the pipette.\nCritical: PFA is a hazardous chemical and should be always handled under a chemical hood and using personal protective equipment.\nCritical: This step must be performed rapidly as tricaine causes a decrease in neuronal activity (Turrini et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). No more than 90 s should pass from the administration of tricaine to the addition of PFA.\nImmunostaining\nThis section describes how to perform immunofluorescence staining to detect pERK and total ERK (tERK).\nPreparation of the samples\nTiming: 60 min without step 8, 120 min with step 8, plus overnight fixation (12–16 h)",
    "Note: To perform the washes we advise using a 3 mL plastic pipette with a 10 μL tip inserted on the top of it to avoid losing the larvae. The 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes can be inserted in a 50 mL Falcon tube placed on a rotator.\nFix the larvae for ∼18 h at 4°C placing the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes horizontally without agitation to ensure that all the larvae are homogeneously covered with PFA.\nCritical: Do not add more than 25 larvae in one 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube as this might result in an improper fixation of the samples.\nNote: Alternatively, larvae can be fixed for one hour at room temperature. However, in our experience, this leads to higher variability in the fixation of the larvae and penetration of the antibodies.\nRemove the PFA and wash the larvae three times with 1 mL of 1× PBT for 15 min at room temperature under agitation.\nCritical: PFA is a hazardous chemical and should be handled using personal protective equipment. Discard the liquid waste containing the PFA under a chemical hood and dispose of it according to the safety instructions of your workplace.\n(Optional) Clear the samples to remove melanin pigments:\nIncubate the larvae with 500 μL of a solution containing 3% H2O2 + 0.5% KOH in PBT.\nSeal the lid of the 1.5 mL tubes with parafilm and place them in a thermoblock at room temperature (∼23°C) with 300 rpm agitation for 15 min.\nCarefully remove the clearing solution trying to remove all the bubbles that will form.\nRinse the larvae with 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nWash the larvae under agitation three times with 1 mL of 1× PBT for 15 min.",
    "Note: The clearing solution should be prepared fresh immediately before use. H2O2 is unstable and should be kept in a dark container and discarded after six months from the opening.\nCritical: H2O2 can cause skin and eye irritation. Handle the solution with care and wear protective equipment. Once you open the lid of the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube after the incubation be careful as there will be a large amount of bubbles.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at 4°C for up to four days before proceeding with the next steps. Alternatively, they can be stored at −20°C for longer periods of time in MeOH (see steps 9 and 10).\nDehydration of the samples with MeOH for long storage (optional)\nTiming: 2 days (40 min the first day, and 30 min the day after)\nThis step is advisable whenever the samples are going to be stored for longer periods than one week before proceeding with the next steps of the protocol. Consider that treatment with MeOH generally leads to the disappearance of endogenous fluorescent signals.\nNote: To perform the washes we advise using a 3 mL plastic pipette with a 10 μL tip inserted on the top of it to avoid losing the larvae. The 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes can be inserted in a 50 mL Falcon tube placed on a rotator.\nDehydrate the larvae with a series of washes (1 mL each) under agitation at room temperature:\n25% MeOH / 75% PBT for 5 min.\n50% MeOH / 50% PBT for 5 min.\n75% MeOH / 25% PBT for 5 min.\n100% MeOH for 15 min.\nReplace with fresh 100% MeOH and store the larvae at −20°C.\nPause point: Larvae can be stored at −20°C for long periods of time. In our experience up to one year.",
    "Rehydrate the larvae with a series of washes (1 mL each) under agitation:\n75% MeOH / 25% PBT for 5 min.\n50% MeOH / 50% PBT for 5 min.\n25% MeOH / 75% PBT for 5 min.\n100% PBT for 5 min (repeat three times).\nPermeabilization of the samples\nTiming: 80 min\nThis part describes how to permeabilize and block the samples for immunostaining. As with the rest of the protocol, these steps are optimized for 5 dpf zebrafish larvae. Other methods of permeabilization will require different concentrations and incubation times, and their efficiency with the desired antibodies should be tested beforehand.\nNote: To perform the washes we advise using a 3 mL plastic pipette with a 10 μL tip inserted on the top of it to avoid losing the larvae. The 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes can be inserted in a 50 mL Falcon tube placed on a rotator.\nIncubate the larvae in 500 μL of 150 mM Tris-HCl in PBT for 5 min at room temperature without agitation.\nTransfer the tubes containing the larvae with the 150 mM Tris-HCl solution to a thermoblock set at 70°C and incubate without agitation for 15 min.\nRemove the solution and wash the larvae under agitation three times with 1 mL of 1× PBT for 15 min.\nIncubate the larvae in Trypsin-EDTA (diluted 1:50 in PBT) for 40 min on ice without agitation.\nCritical: The concentration of the permeabilization solution and incubation time indicated here are optimized for 5 dpf larvae. Younger or older embryos/larvae will require different concentrations and incubation times.\nNote: This incubation period can be used to prepare the blocking solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) that will be needed for step 16.",
    "Remove the solution and wash the larvae under agitation three times with 1 mL of 1× PBT for 15 min.\nPause point: If needed, the larvae can be left in PBT at 4°C for up to 16 h.\nBlocking and incubation with antibodies\nTiming: 75 min + 4 days (incubation with primary antibodies), 60 min washes + 2 days (incubation with secondary antibodies)\nThis section describes how to prepare the samples for immunostaining with antibodies against the following proteins: GFP, pERK, and tERK (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Incubation times and concentration of the antibodies may be different if different antibodies than the ones used for this protocol are employed.\nNote: To perform the washes we advise using a 3 mL plastic pipette with a 10 μL tip inserted on the top of it to avoid losing the larvae. The 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes can be inserted in a 50 mL Falcon tube placed on a rotator.\nNote: We used a transgenic line labeling with GFP hypothalamic neurons producing the neuropeptide galanin (TgBAC[galn:GAL4-VP16,myl7:mCherry] mpn213; Tg[5xUAS:EGFP]nkuasgfp1a). Hence the use of an anti-GFP antibody.\nNote: The use of an antibody against tERK is necessary to normalize the amount of pERK for the amount of total (phosphorylated and not) ERK in the neurons during the image analysis process.\nIncubate the larvae in 700 μL of blocking solution for one hour at room temperature under agitation.\nAlternatives: The larvae can also be incubated overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C under agitation. In our experience, there is no difference in the outcome of the results but it is always advisable to be consistent with different experiments.",
    "Note: 700 μL is the minimum volume required to ensure that the larvae in the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes are homogeneously covered by the solution. If smaller or larger tubes are used, adjust the volume accordingly.\nPrepare the antibody solution diluting the antibodies in 1,400 μL of blocking solution (for two experimental groups in two separate tubes). In this protocol the following antibodies were used:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2048_12.csv\nCritical: We recommend testing the efficacy of new antibodies and optimizing concentration and incubation time beforehand in a pilot assay. Optimization might be required also when using larvae at different developmental stages.\nRemove the blocking solution and replace it with the primary antibody solution (700 μL for each tube) and incubate the larvae for 96 h at 4°C with agitation.\nNote: The antibody solution should be prepared shortly before incubation and according to the number of samples. We recommend not to prepare different antibody solutions for different samples as it might affect the outcome of the analysis.\nRemove the primary antibody solution and wash the larvae under agitation at least three times with 1 mL of 1× PBT for 15 min at room temperature.\nNote: In our experience increasing the number of washes to remove excess of primary antibody decreases substantially the background.\nPrepare the secondary antibody solution diluting the antibodies in 1,400 μL of blocking solution (for two tubes). In this protocol the following antibodies were used:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2048_13.csv\nRemove the PBT and replace it with the secondary antibody solution (700 μL for each tube) and incubate the larvae for 48 h at 4°C under agitation.",
    "Critical: Secondary antibodies should be protected from exposure to light. Cover the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with aluminum foil and work quickly during the preparation of the secondary antibody solution and the following washing steps to minimize light exposure.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution and wash the larvae under agitation at least three times with 1 mL of 1× PBT for 15 min.\nNote: In our experience increasing the number of washes to remove the excess of secondary antibody decreases substantially the background. However, prolonged exposure to light during washes might cause fluorophore photobleaching.\nConfirm, using at least one larva, that the antibody signal is detectable using a fluorescence microscope.\nPause point: Larvae can be stored in the dark at 4°C for up to three days. However, we advise proceeding with the imaging as soon as possible.\nNote: This protocol for pERK/tERK immunostaining is optimized for 5 dpf larvae. However, this method was previously used to quantify neuronal activity in younger and older fish, for example from as early as 3 dpf to juvenile stages (Fore et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nImaging\nThis section describes how to image the immunostained samples, including the critical steps to obtain fluorescent images that can be reliably quantified.\nNote: The preparation of the samples and the imaging protocol might be adapted according to different types of confocal microscopes and/or objectives. We used an upright Zeiss LSM880 microscope equipped with a water-immersion objective (W Plan-Apochromat 20×/1.0 DIC VIS-IR).\nMounting\nTiming: ∼2 min per larva\nThis section describes how to mount the zebrafish larvae in low-melting-point agarose for acquiring images using a confocal microscope.\nKeep 1.5% low-melting-point agarose at 50°C while mounting to avoid solidification.\nMount the samples on the lid of a 35 mm plastic Petri dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2048-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Sequence of images showing the process for placing larvae in agarose for microscopy\n(A and B) Initially a single larva is embedded in a drop of low-melting-point agarose on the lid of a Petri dish (A, dashed circle, and B at higher magnification).\n(C and D) Subsequently, the other larvae are added (C), and the solidified agarose in the center is connected to the border of the lid by adding more agarose with a pipette (D, the dashed red lines mark the borders of the agarose). Scale bars: 1 cm in (A, C, D); 1 mm in (B). See also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nUsing a plastic pipette transfer a larva to the Petri dish’s lid and remove as much PBT as possible.\nUsing a glass Pasteur pipette add one drop of agarose on top of the larva.\nUsing a 10 μL pipette tip, gently orient the larva with its dorsal part up to expose the brain for imaging.\nRepeat the process for all the larvae you intend to image alternating samples belonging to different treatment conditions.\nOnce the agarose surrounding the larvae is solidified, add agarose to connect the wall of the Petri dish’s lid to the larvae to avoid the sample to move during imaging.\nCritical: Orient the larvae as quickly as possible as the agarose solidifies after approximately two minutes at room temperature. Avoid touching the head while mounting to avoid disrupting the tissue. In addition, add as little agarose as possible to embed the larvae to ensure that the brain is within the working distance of the microscope objective.",
    "Critical: While mounting, always alternate larvae belonging to different treatment groups to avoid exposing one group to light for more time than the other. Different exposure times to light of different experimental groups could lead to detection of fluorescence intensity differences during the analysis caused by photobleaching of the fluorophores rather than by the treatment itself.\nOnce the agarose is solidified, cover the Petri dish’s lid containing the samples with PBS (if you will use a water immersion objective) and proceed with the imaging.\nNote: Mounting medium and orientation of the larvae must be changed according to the objective and the microscope that you intend to use.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Procedure for embedding zebrafish larvae in agarose, related to step 25\nThe video displays the main steps for placing the zebrafish larvae in agarose to acquire images at the confocal microscope.\nSetup of parameters for confocal imaging\nTiming: ∼30 min, varies depending on the number of samples\nThis section describes the main steps for acquiring confocal images to perform quantitative fluorescence intensity analysis. The settings described here apply to the Zen Black software and an upright Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope.\nCritical: This protocol does not substitute a training for the use of a confocal microscope that should be given by experienced personnel. Use safety measures to avoid laser-induced eye damage.\nSwitch on the computer, microscope, and fluorescent lamp according to the instructions provided by Zeiss.\nLaunch the microscope software (Zen Black) and switch on the lasers you intend to use as they might need some minutes to warm up.\nPlace the Petri dish’s lid containing the larvae on the microscope stage.",
    "Press “Acquisition” on the top left of the Zen Black main window, and then select “Smart Setup” to choose laser, light, path, and filters in an automatic way (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2048-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Image showing the main panel of the Zeiss Zen Black software\nThe red letters and rectangles indicate the steps required to set up the imaging session.\nIn the “Smart Setup” window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) select the dyes and the pseudocolors you intend to use. For example, Alexa-fluor 488 and green; Alexa-fluor 555 and red; Alexa-fluor 647 and blue.\nChose the acquisition mode “Smartest” from the three options: “Fastest'', ''Best Signal'', and ''Smartest'' (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: We advise choosing the setting “Smartest” as in our experience it is the best compromise between imaging speed and cross-channels signal contamination.\nOn the left, under “Imaging setup” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) double-check that the detection range and the laser chosen by the software for each fluorophore are correct.\nClick on “Positions” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) and move the “Position” window at the center of the screen (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Press the “Locate” tab on the top left corner (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F) and open the shutter of the fluorescent lamp.\nLocate the first mounted zebrafish larva and focus on the brain.\nIn the “Position” window press “Add” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nRepeat steps a and b for all the samples.\nSave the position list (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nUsing the function “Move to” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E) you are now able to automatically move the microscope stage to each larva.\nNote: We highly recommend saving the positions of all the samples in order to spend less time for the adjustment of the imaging settings and for the imaging itself. This step can also be performed while waiting for the lasers to warm up.",
    "Note: Remember to do this step and the next ones always after using the function “Smart Setup” (step 30) otherwise the settings will be lost.\nPress again the “Acquisition” tab to continue with the setting of the imaging parameters.\nPress “Live” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G) and focus on the area of interest and adjust the settings by pressing “Channels” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nFor each laser set a “Laser Power” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I). The laser power should be enough to observe the fluorescent signal but set as low as possible to reduce photobleaching.\nSet “Gain (Master)” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I) while using the ‘Range Indicator’’ (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J) to visualize saturation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2048-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Picture of the image preview window in the Zeiss Zen Black software when the “Range Indicator” option is selected\nPixels with intensities below the detection threshold are labeled in blue, and saturated ones in red.\nDo not change “Digital Offset” and “Digital Gain” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nSet the “Pinhole Diameter” at 1 AU (Airy Unit) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nRepeat all the previous steps for each channel.\nOnce you have chosen the settings for each channel, move the stage using the “Move to” function in the “Position” window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nVerify that the fluorescence signal is below saturation in each fish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nIf in the region of interest in any of the larvae the fluorescence signal is saturated, lower the “Gain” and/or the “Laser power”.\nCritical: It is fundamental that the fluorescence signal in the area of interest is below saturation in all the samples. A saturated signal will compromise the final analysis.\nZ-stack acquisition\nTiming: ∼5/10 min per larva depending on the thickness of the region of interest",
    "This section describes how to set the Zen Black software to acquire confocal Z-stack multichannel images. It includes the description of the settings to enable automated imaging of several larvae in the same Petri dish.\nNote: Using a different software will most likely require different settings.\nGo to the “Acquisition Mode” window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K) to select the type of acquisition, image resolution, and scanning speed.\nChose “Frame” in the “Scan Mode” menu.\nSelect 1024 × 1024 in the “Frame Size”. In our experience, this resolution is a good compromise between time required for imaging and image quality.\nSet the “Speed”. We advise choosing a minimum of 8 as a high scan speed reduces the time required for image capture.\nIn the “Acquisition Mode” window (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K) chose “Averaging” to acquire multiple scans for noise reduction.\nChose the “Number” of scans that will be acquired for each plane. In our experience, two scans are sufficient to reduce significantly the noise.\nSelect under “Method” whether the pixels of the multiple scans will be summed (“Sum“) or averaged (“Mean”). We advise to choose the “Mean” option.\nUnder “Bit Depth’’ select 16. It is recommended to choose a high bit depth for performing quantification of fluorescent signals.\nChose the “Direction” of the scan. We advise choosing “Unidirectional” as “Bidirectional” is faster but not ideal when acquiring multi-track images.\nMove the stage to the first larva to be imaged and select the option “Z-stack” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]L).\nFocus on the top border of your region of interest, and in the “Z-stack“ window click “Set Last” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]M).\nMove the focus until you reach the bottom of your region of interest and click “Set first”.\nClick “Optimal” to set automatically the slice number based on the parameters you selected. Alternatively, the parameters can be set manually.",

In this case, you will have to make sure that the Z-stack is thick enough to encompass the region of interest in every sample. Using this automatic function, the Z-stack parameters will be the same for all the stage positions. In this case, proceed as follow:\n(Optional) Set the automatic imaging of all the larvae.\nIn the “Position” window use “Move to” to move to each larva you desire to image (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCheck that your region of interest is within the range of the Z-stack and press the center of the Z-stack clicking “C” on the left (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]M).\nGo to the “Position” window and select “Update”.\nRepeat the procedure for each larva.\nOn the top left of the main window press “Start Experiment” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]N) to acquire the Z-stack(s).\nSave your images by pressing “Save as” choosing the extension .czi. or .tif.\nImage analysis\nThis section describes the steps to quantify fluorescence intensity of the acquired images using ImageJ/Fiji.\nMeasurement of fluorescence intensity\nTiming: ∼5 min per cell\nThis section describes how to select the regions of interest (ROIs) using ImageJ/Fiji and measure fluorescence intensities of the pERK and tERK channels.\nOpen a multichannel image with ImageJ/Fiji and zoom on the neurons you intend to analyze (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2048-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

However, you should select the type of data-representation method and statistical analysis most suitable to your experimental design. Variance of the data will likely vary depending on the specific type of neuronal population under study and on the specific stimuli utilized, and will affect the number of neurons and animal required for the analysis."
