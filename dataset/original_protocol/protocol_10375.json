    "1. Synthesis of CDNSEDTA Polymers\nDry β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) in oven at 80 °C for 4 hr before use. Dry 500 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 100 ml of triethylamine (Et3N) over molecular sieves (4 Å) for 24 hr before using them in the protocol.\nIntroduce 25 ml of DMSO into a 50 ml one-neck round-bottom flask. Under magnetic stirring, add 5.675 g of β-CD (5 mmol). In order to reduce the formation of lumps, add the β-CD powder in small portions to DMSO.\nAfter about 30 min, add 6ml of Et3N to the homogeneous solution using a 10 ml graduated pipette. Keep the mixture under stirring for 15 min at RT. Plunge the flask into a water bath at RT.\n\tNOTE: The reaction between β-CD and EDTA is exothermic. Therefore, plunging the flask into the water bath favors the heat exchange avoiding the overheating of the reaction mixture.\nAdd 5.124 g (20 mmol, preparation of CDNSEDTA 1:4) or 10.248 g (40 mmol, preparation of CDNSEDTA 1:8) of EDTA-dianhydride under intense stirring.\nAfter 3 hr, remove the solid material (CDNSEDTA 1:4 or CDNSEDTA 1:8) from the flask using a spatula and crush it grossly with a mortar and pestle.\nWash the solid material onto filter paper with acetone at RT (100 ml × 5 times), with HCl 0.1 M (200 ml × 5 times), and deionized water (200 ml × 3 times).\nFinally, dry all the solid material in air at RT for 48 hr, crush it finely into a mortar and pestle and then keep it under vacuum (< 15 mbar) for 2 hr at 45 °C.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53769/53769fig1.jpg",

HR-MAS NMR Measurements\nHR-MAS NMR Sample Preparation\nPrepare a solution 0.27 M of ibuprofen sodium salt (IP) in deuterated water (99.8%).\nAdd 20 mg of CDNSEDTA 1:4 and 2 mg of anhydrous Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) to 150 µl of the solution prepared at the point 2.1.1) into a 2 ml glass vial. Mix the content of the vial with a small spatula in order to homogenize it. Wait 2 hr before using the gel formed with this procedure. Repeat this point for the CDNSEDTA 1:8 polymer.\nInsert the gel in a 5mm NMR rotor suitable for HR-MAS NMR experiments using a small spatula. The total amount of gel to use depends on the internal volume of the rotor (12 μl recommended).\nHR-MAS 1H NMR Experiments\nSet the following instrumental parameters: rotor spinning speed of 4 KHz at the MAS pneumatic control unit, sample temperature at 305 K in the variable temperature unit.\nAcquire the 1H HR-MAS NMR spectra of ibuprofen in CDNSEDTA (1:4) and CDNSEDTA (1:8) polymer systems using a conventional one pulse sequence on the proton resonance.\n\t\t\nCreate a new data set. Click on the \"AcquPars\" tab. Select the PULPROG: zg.\nSelect the number of scans (NS = 4) and the time delay between them (D1 = 5 sec).Set the spectral width (SW = 8 ppm), the time domain (TD = 16K) and the receiver gain (RG = 32).",
    "Type \"zg\" on the console and there will be a free induction decay (FID) on the screen. To process the data click on the \"ProcPars\" tab. Set the spectral size (SI = 32K), an exponential multiplication window function (WDW = EM) and line broadening (LB = 1). Type \"ft\" to perform the Fourier transformation. Phase the spectrum using the phase tab on the screen. Obtain a high resolution well resolved spectrum.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53769/53769fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: The Bipolar Pulse Pairs Longitudinal Eddy Current Delay (BPPLED) Pulse Sequence.

This is a pseudo two-dimensional experiment with a gradient ramp increasing linearly from 2% to 100% in the indirect dimension. The signal intensity is attenuated depending on the diffusion time Δ and the gradient pulse δ. The optimization of these parameters is required before running properly a PGSE experiment. The optimization is done by running a few 1D measurements in which Δ is kept constant, while δ is varied.\n\t\nParameters Optimization\nCreate a new data set - experiment number 1. Click on the \"AcquPars\" tab. Select the PULPROG: ledbpgp2s1d the 1D pulse sequence for diffusion optimization.\nSelect the number of scans (NS = 16) and the time delay between them (D1 = 10 sec). Set the spectral width (SW = 8 ppm), the time domain (TD = 16K) and the receiver gain (RG = 32).",
    "Set Δ (D20 in the sequence) equal to a constant value and δ (p30) to a trial value. Start value Δ = 50 msec, δ = 3 msec (maximum allowed value for high resolution instruments).\nRead the value of spectral frequency (SFO1) from the 1H experiment and use now this value. Set the GPZ6 gradient strength to 2%. Repeat step 2.2.2.3. Use this spectrum as reference for the optimization.\nIn the same data set create the experiment number 2. Observe all the experimental parameters. Increase the GPZ6 gradient strength to 95%. Repeat step 2.2.2.3. Compare this spectrum with the reference spectrum using the dual display icon and observe the change in the signal intensity.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A well attenuated spectrum should have about 5% residual signal intensity compared with the reference spectrum. If the signal intensity is lost, reduce the value of δ and restart the section 2.3.1 procedure from point 2.3.1.3 until the right value for δ is found.\nRepeat the parameters optimization procedure in section 2.3.1 for all the five Δ values.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Choose five value for Δ = 50, 80, 110, 140 and 170 msec and optimized the corresponding δ to 3, 2.7, 2.4, 2.1, 1.8 msec (for IP in CDNSEDTA 1:8) and to δ to 2.7, 2.4, 2, 1.7, 1.4 (for IP in in CDNSEDTA 1:4).\nAcquisition of the 2D Diffusion Data Set\nIn the same data set create the experiment number 3, all the 1D experimental parameters will be loaded. Type \"eda\". Select the PULPROG: ledbpgp2s the 2D pulse sequence and change the parmode to 2D.",
    "Set FnMODE=QF. Set the time domain TD in F2 dimension equal to 32, the number of gradient steps. All the other parameters are set correctly. Type \"DOSY\" and the gradient ramp will be generated and stored in a file. The start and final values of the ramp (2 - 95) are given as input parameters. The acquisition is now started.\nData Processing\nType \"xf2\" to execute the Fourier transformation in the F2 dimension. Type \"abs2\" to perform the baseline correction in the F2 dimension. Type \"setdiffparm\" to recall the experimental parameters (Δ, δ, and gradient list) for the next processing step.\nClick \"T1/T2 relaxation module\" in the analysis tab and define the peaks to be fitted using the first spectrum of the 2D experiment. Define the peak ranges and execute the fitting. The signal intensities at each applied gradient step are obtained.\n\t\tNOTE: The signal intensities I(q, td), for each Δ value, depends on the experimental variables: applied pulse filed gradient (g), time variable (δ), magnetogyric ratio (γ) q= (γgδ) according to the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53769/53769equation1.jpg\n\t\twith the molecular MSD=z2.\nExport the signal intensities in a spreadsheet and perform a linear fit of the data to get the value of z2 for each observed diffusion time td.\n\t\tNOTE: The MSD value is related to the observation time td according to: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53769/53769equation2.jpg\nPerform the log-log plot of z2 versus td for each experimental td value. The exponent α value is the slope of the linear regression. A more exhaustive discussion of the physical aspects of the equations reported above can be found in ref. 21 and in the references therein.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the value of the exponent α, the diffusion regime is defined as: i) isotropic unrestricted diffusion for α = 1, ii) anomalous subdiffusive regime for 0 < α < 1, iii) anomalous superdiffusive regime for α > 1.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
