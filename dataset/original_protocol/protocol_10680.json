    "1. Culturing a Cell Monolayer in Transwell Inserts\nIn a sterile, biosafety level 2 cell culture hood, place 0.8 mm pore PET transwell inserts into a 24-well plate (4 wells per condition, for statistical significance) with forceps. All materials entering the hood should be sterilized with ethanol.\nNote: The pore size of the filter needs to be selected in accord to the mean size of the NC used, to allow transport across the membrane. Also, for statistically significant results, each experimental condition requires a minimum of four repeats (wells) within the same experiment, and a minimum of 3 independent experiments.\nPrepare cell culture medium containing DMEM medium supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, 15% fetal bovine serum, and 1% Pen Strep, and heat to 37 °C in a water bath.\nDilute human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells in cell medium and place 200-400 μl of the cell solution into the upper (apical) chamber of the transwell insert, at a density of 1.5 x 105 cells/cm2. Fill the lower (basolateral) chamber with 700 - 900 μl of cell medium.\nCulture cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity for 16-21 days, replacing the medium in the upper and lower chamber every 3-4 days, using the volumes indicated in step 1.3. Replace medium in the following order to maintain the pressure above (rather than below) the cell monolayer: aspirate the medium from the lower chamber, aspirate the medium from the upper chamber, fill the upper chamber with fresh medium, and fill the lower chamber with fresh medium.\n2. Validation of the GI Epithelial Permeability Barrier Using Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) and Immunostaining of Tight Junctions",
    "For short-term storage (less than 2 weeks), submerge STX100 electrodes in an electrolyte solution (0.1-0.15 M KCl or NaCl). Connect the electrode cable to the electrode port on the EVOM volt-ohm meter so that the system is internally short-circuited and electrode symmetry is maintained. For long-term storage, rinse with dH2O and store in a dry, dark condition.\nTo sterilize the electrodes, immerse in ethanol for 15 min and allow to air dry for 15 sec. Alternatively, the electrodes can be stored in a UV hood. Rinse the electrodes in a sterile electrolyte solution (phosphate buffer saline, PBS) or 0.1-0.15 M KCl or NaCl solution, before each resistance measurement.\nWith the volt-ohm meter set to the resistance setting, vertically place electrodes in a well containing the transwell insert, with the short electrode in the upper chamber and the long electrode in the lower chamber touching the bottom of the well. Once the EVOM reading stabilizes, record the resistance value (given in ohms; Ω) for each well.\nCalculate resistivity (resistance normalized to area; Ω×cm2) of samples by subtracting background resistance (TEER of transwell inserts without cells) and multiplying by membrane surface area. Resistivity values are most often reported in the literature. (See Discussion)\nRepeat measurements every 1-2 days until TEER values rise to a maximum and plateau, indicating formation of a permeability barrier, which typically takes 2-3 weeks from the moment of cell platting. Plateau TEER values and time necessary to achieve barrier integrity may vary according to cell passage number.",
    "To verify the presence of tight junctions in cell monolayers with high TEER (equal to or above the threshold value for barrier formation), fix cells by incubation with cold 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Then, wash cells with PBS and incubate them for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μg/ml anti-occludin. Wash cells again with PBS and incubate them for 30 min at room temperature with 7.5 μg/ml fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies. Use wells with low TEER as a negative control for barrier formation.\nNote: As a substitute for anti-occludin, antibodies to alternative tight junction proteins may be used.\nCarefully excise the filter membrane on which the fixed monolayer is attached, and mount onto slides for imaging using epifluorescence or confocal microscopy.\n3. Evaluating Transepithelial Transport of Targeted Carriers\nLabel the targeting antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody against ICAM-1, anti-ICAM, in this example) with 125I, as previously described7. Use Bradford assay to estimate protein concentration and a gamma counter to determine 125I content on the antibody, then calculate the specific activity in counts per minute (CPM)/mg of labeled antibody.\nNote: To control for specificity, repeat the procedure by labeling mouse IgG, which will be used to prepare non-targeted coated NCs. To study transport of a therapeutic cargo, repeat the procedure labeling the cargo, e.g, alpha-Galactosidase (α-Gal) in this example. Alternatives may be used for the targeting agent, non-specific control, or therapeutic cargo. Alternative methods may also be used to label compounds and estimate the concentration of the labeled counterparts.\nCouple the labeled targeting antibody (anti-ICAM in our example) to the surface of NCs. In this example, incubate polystyrene nanobeads (100-nm diameter) for 1 hr at room temperature with 125I-anti-ICAM to allow surface adsorption, as described7.",
    "Note: For the non-specific control use 125I-IgG. To trace transport of a cargo, use a combination of targeting antibody and 125I-labeled cargo (α-Gal in our example).\nCentrifuge at 13,000 x g for 3 min and remove the non-coated counterparts in the supernatant by aspiration. Resuspend the pellet containing coated NCs using 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS by pipetting, and sonicate at low power to disrupt potential particle aggregates (20-30 brief pulses).\nFor NC characterization, measure size, polydispersity, and ζ-potential of coated particles using dynamic light scattering (following vendor instructions), and quantify the number of 125I-labeled targeting antibody molecules (e.g. anti-ICAM) on the particle surface using a gamma counter.\nNote: These methods can be repeated for non-specific and therapeutic counterparts. The size of coated particles ranges around 200 nm.\nAdd 125I-antibody NCs, (e.g. 125I-anti-ICAM NCs; 56 nCi/ml) to the upper chamber above confluent Caco-2 monolayers with TEER ≥350 Ω×cm2 (see Discussion) over background (16-21 days post-seeding). Incubate at 37 °C for one or more desired time intervals. Measure TEER (Section 2.3) before and after incubation to assess the effects of NCs on the permeability barrier.\nNote: This procedure can be repeated for non-specific and therapeutic counterparts.\nCollect medium from the upper and lower chambers and wash them once with 0.5 ml DMEM at 37 °C (upper chamber) or 1 ml dH2O (lower chamber). Collect the washes for measurement of total radioisotope content using a gamma counter.\nFor measurement of the cell fraction, excise the permeable filter, e.g. using a razor blade to cut around the edges, and incubate in a gamma counter tube with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min (to release cell contents), before measuring cell-associated total radioactivity.",
    "To measure 125I released from NCs during transport or due to potential degradation, first mix 300 μl of sample (from the upper, lower, or cell fractions) with 700 μl of 3% BSA in PBS and 200 μl trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Incubate at room temperature for 15 min. Meanwhile this time, measure the total radioactivity of this sample in a gamma counter.\nCentrifuge TCA samples at 3,000 x g for 5 min to separate intact protein (pellet) from the degraded protein or 125I fraction (supernatant). Quantify the radioactivity of the free125I fraction and subtract this value from total radioactivity measured before centrifugation. This will provide the amount of labeled-protein that is not degraded.\n4. Mechanism of Transepithelial Transport of Targeted Nanocarriers\nLabel albumin with 125I as described in Section 3.1 and previously reported7.\nNote: Albumin is a 66.5 kDa protein and, hence, a relatively large substance. Although a valid control for passive transport of larger objects (e.g. 200 nm NCs used here), it should be substituted with smaller inert tracer molecules when studying transport of smaller drug carriers (see Discussion).\nTo assess paracellular transport using albumin paracellular leakage, culture Caco-2 monolayers on transwell inserts as described above.\nTo the upper chamber medium above the cell monolayer, add either 125I-albumin alone (negative control showing the basal level of leakage), or 125I-albumin and non-radiolabeled antibody-targeted NCs (as described in Section 3.5). Incubate at 37 °C for the selected time interval(s), which should match those examined when testing NC transport. Measure TEER (Section 2.3) before, during, and after incubation, then collect all fractions for total 125I and free 125I measurements as indicated in Section 3. Note: Concomitant addition of 125I-albumin and non-radiolabeled control IgG NCs may be used as a control.",
    "As a positive control for opening intercellular junctions, add cell media containing 5 mM H2O2 to the upper and lower chambers of the transwell insert, and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, measure TEER (Section 2.3) and add 125I-albumin to the upper chamber for the selected time intervals. Measure TEER at various time points throughout the incubation to identify TEER value decay caused by H2O2-induced opening of the cell junctions.\nIn parallel experiments, evaluate transcellular transport, also called transcytosis, of 125I-targeted NCs by incubating confluent Caco-2 monolayers with either 50 μM monodansylcadaverine (MDC; inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis), 1 μg/ml filipin (inhibitor of caveolar-mediated endocytosis), 0.5 μM wortmannin (inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase [PI3K], involved in macropinocytosis), or 20 μM [5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride] (EIPA, inhibitor of macropinocytosis and CAM-mediated endocytosis15).\nNote: 125I-IgG NCs and 125I-albumin may be used as negative controls for the effect of these inhibitors, and other methods (e.g. siRNA techniques) may provide more selective inhibition.\nMeasure TEER (Section 2.3) before, during, and after incubation of cells with inhibitors and radiolabeled materials, as an additional control for the effect of the inhibitors on the monolayer permeability.\nSubscription Required.
