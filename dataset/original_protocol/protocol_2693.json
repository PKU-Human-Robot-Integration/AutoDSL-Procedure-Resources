Embryos would be around 10–11 somite stage at 9 am if they were incubated at 28°C until the shield stage and then incubated at 23°C for 12–16 h. Check GFP signal and morphology of embryos under fluorescence microscope. Remove embryos with abnormal morphology or weak GFP signal. Select 15 embryos for each experimental condition. Always keep embryos in dark; either cover tubes with aluminum foil or keep them in a dark box until the end of staining.\nNote: Embryos would be ready to be fixed after removal of ones with abnormal morphology or weak GFP signal. But depending on the injection room temperature (21°C–28°C), embryos might be earlier than 10 somite stage at 9 am, and it might take 1–2 h to reach 12 somite stage.\nTransfer embryos into 2 mL tube. Remove excess water.\nRinse with 1 mL 4% PFA (add and then remove 1 mL 4% PFA).\nAdd 2 mL 4% PFA. Cover the tube to keep embryos in dark and shake embryos for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2348-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Comparison between “good” and “bad” fixed embryos\nNote: Store the rest of 4% PFA at 4°C as it is going to be used in Day 3 and Day 6.",
    "Note: Before the end of fixation (after ∼45 min), check transparency of embryos under dissecting microscope with dim light and from the black side of the mirror (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B). Continue experiment only if the embryos are transparent (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). If the embryos are not transparent, it means the PFA is not good (see Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nRemove PFA. Rinse with 1 mL PBST-0.1%.\nAdd 2 mL PBST-0.1%. Shake slowly for 5 min.\nNote: In the meantime, mix 3 mL PBST-0.1% and 3 mL Methanol into a 60 mm petri dish.\nDechorionate embryos in the petri dish (3 mL PBST-0.1% + 3 mL Methanol) for 5 min in a dark room with the weakest microscope light.\nTransfer embryos back to the tube. Rinse them with 1 mL Methanol.\nAdd 2 mL Methanol. Shake slowly for 5 min.\nRefresh medium with 2 mL Methanol. Store tube for 24 h at −20°C.\nDay 2: Probe hybridization\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes the steps for smFISH probe hybridization developed from the RNAscope technology and Gross-Thebing et al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nNote: Start this step afternoon (∼1 pm). Set the oven to 40°C. Take tube out, wait until it reaches to 20°C–25°C.\nTransfer embryos to 1.5 mL flat bottom microcentrifuge tube with glass pipette.\nNote: Using 1.5 mL flat bottom microcentrifuge tube is important for evenly staining of 15 embryos.\nNote: Using glass pipette is important as embryos might get stuck to the side of plastic tips.\nRemove methanol as much as you can. Do not touch / damage embryos.",
    "Note: To remove solution as much as you can, first remove solution with 1000-μL filtered tip until less than 250 μL of the solution remains. Then hold the tube tilted, and remove the rest of the solution along the side of the tube taking care to avoid touching the embryos.\nAir dry: leave tube open for methanol evaporation until embryos don’t contact each other with methanol (∼5–20 min) (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: Don’t let the embryos dry. If embryos’ color turns into yellow-orange color, which means they are dried, it becomes harder to flat mount embryos later.\nAdd 1 drop of RNAscope Protease-III pre-treatment solution. Gently tap the tube to sink embryos down. Wait for 20 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: Protease makes embryos so fragile. After this step, be more careful and gentle with handling embryos till the end of experiment. From now on, never touch embryos with a tip while removing solutions. Add new solutions slowly from the inner side of the tube with ∼90° pipette tip (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). Always use either filtered or autoclaved tips. Shakings should be done at the slowest speed (i.e., approximately 20 rpm).\nNote: Prepare PBST-0.01% and fresh prehybridization buffer.\nOptional: You can prepare PBST-0.01% and fresh prehybridization buffer before starting the 11th step on Day 2.\nRinse with 1 mL PBST-0.01% gently.\nAdd 1 mL PBST-0.01%. Shake tube slowly in a horizontal position for 5 min (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nRepeat the previous step for 2 more times.\nRemove all solution, add fresh 250 μL prehybridization buffer. Place tube in a box with 45° tilted position (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G) and incubate it in oven at 40°C for 2 h.",
    "Note: Before 20 min end of prehybridization, take probes out from 4°C, warm them in oven (40°C) for 10 min, then cool to 20°C–25°C. Prepare probe mixture in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube: 1 μL Dr-her1-LE2-C3 into 50 μL Dr-her7.\nNote: While C1 probes are ready to use, C2 and C3 probes are shipped as a 50× concentrated stock. Thus, drop couple of droplets from C1 probe into a sterile microcentrifuge tube and use it as C1 aliquot.\nCritical: Before preparing the probe mixture, make sure all probes are completely dissolved.\nRemove all solution. Add 15 μL probe mixture. Gently tap the tube. Place tube in a box vertically (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H) and incubate it in oven at 40°C for 16 h.\nCritical: Make sure all embryos are in a row at the bottom of the tube for an even staining.\nNote: Start probe hybridization at ∼6 pm and end it next day by ∼9 am to ensure sufficient hybridization and maintain consistency between each experiment.\nNote: Add 1 μL probe mixture per embryo. If you have less than 10 embryo in a tube, add 10 μL probe mixture at a minimum volume. Do not include more than 15 embryos in a single tube.\nDay 3: Amplifications and washes\nTiming: 10 h\nThis experimental day includes four signal amplification steps in between a series of washings. To detect target RNAs, probes are hybridized to amplification molecules, which make target RNAs to be visible in a fluorescent channel via binding of dye-labeled probes.",
    "Note: Before starting this step, prepare 50 mL SSCT (0.2× SSC, 0.01% Tween 20). Place 4% PFA at 20°C–25°C. Be careful and gentle to embryos since they are fragile. Solutions should be added slowly from the inner side of the tube with ∼90° pipette tip (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). All the shakings should be done at the slowest speed (∼20 rpm) at 20°C–25°C. Shake tube in a horizontal position (90°, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) if it contains ∼1 mL solution, in a tilted position (45°, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G) if it contains 200–400 μL, or in a vertical position (0°, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H) if it contains less than 200 μL.\nRinse with 1 mL SSCT.\nAdd 1 mL SSCT. Shake tube slowly in a horizontal position for 15 min.\nRepeat the previous step for 4 more times.\nRemove all SSCT.\nRinse with 1 mL 4% PFA.\nAdd 1 mL 4% PFA. Shake tube slowly in a horizontal position for 10 min.\nNote: Store 4% PFA at 4°C.\nRemove 4% PFA as much as you can. Rinse with 1 mL SSCT.\nAdd 1 mL SSCT. Shake tube slowly in a horizontal position for 15 min.\nNote: Take Amp 1 out to 20°C–25°C for 30 min before applying it.\nRepeat the previous step for 2 more times.\nRemove all SSCT.\nCritical: Remove all solution before amplification reagents to ensure staining quality and comparability.\nAdd one drop of Amp 1 (∼20 μL). Tap gently to sink embryos down. Place tube vertically and incubate it in an oven at 40°C for 30 min.\nRinse with 1 mL SSCT.\nAdd 1 mL SSCT. Shake tube slowly in a horizontal position for 15 min.\nRepeat the previous step for 4 more times.\nNote: Take Amp 2 out to 20°C–25°C for 30 min before applying it.\nRemove all SSCT.",

In this experiment, since we stain nucleus with Hoechst and membrane with GFP, we choose Amp 4 Alt B to label C1 (her7) and C3 (her1) probes with red and far red, respectively (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nRepeat the previous step for 2 more times.\nRemove all SSCT.\nAdd one drop of Amp 4 Alt B (∼20 μL).

    "Rinse with 1 mL 4% PFA, then add 1 mL 4% PFA.\nStore embryos, 4% PFA and SSCT (if any) at 4°C for 16 h.\nNote: In order to avoid air bubbles, start preparing PBSTX one day before immunohistochemistry staining. Mix 5 mL 10× PBS with ∼30 mL DEPC water, then add 500 μL Triton X-100. Mix well and leave it at 20°C–25°C. Top it up to 50 mL with DEPC water on the next day.\nDay 4: Primary antibody staining\nTiming: 4 h\nThe following steps describe primary antibody staining for IHC on the fourth day of experiment.\nNote: Start this step afternoon (∼1–2 pm). Top up PBSTX to 50 mL that was prepared the day before. Final concentration would be 1× PBS 1% Triton X-100.\nCritical: Do not start too early or late to make sure enough incubation time and to finish the last step at around 6 pm as embryos are very fragile and buffers are pretty harsh.\nRemove 4% PFA. Rinse with 1 mL PBSTX.\nAdd 1 mL PBSTX. Shake tube slowly in a horizontal position for 5 min.\nNote: Prepare permeabilization buffer (995 μL PBSTX + 5 μL Triton X-100 for each tube). Don't introduce bubbles.\nRepeat the previous step for 2 more times.\nRemove PBSTX. Add 1 mL permeabilization buffer. Shake tube slowly in a horizontal position for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Be careful, don't add air bubbles.\nNote: Prepare blocking buffer PBSTXBG: 0.2 g BSA + 10 mL PBSTX + 100 μL GS.\nRemove permeabilization buffer. Add 1 mL PBSTXBG. Shake tube slowly in a horizontal position for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Prepare primary antibody solution: 180 μL PBSTXBG + 1 μL Chicken anti-GFP. Store the rest of PBSTXBG at 4°C.",
    "Remove PBSTXBG as much as you can (probably 20 μL left). Add 180 μL primary antibody solution. Final concentration would be 1:200 (10 μg/mL).

Use SSCT for sample preparation in a 60-mm petri dish.",
    "Critical: Avoid light as much as possible during sample preparation. Work in a dark room with the weakest microscope light. Turn microscope mirror to ∼90 degree against desk for a minimum light exposure.\nPlace one embryo into petri dish using a transfer pipette. First, cut from the head with a microsurgical knife. Then do little cuts on the skin to remove yolk from the tissue (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Use a lash tool to gently remove excess yolk. Cut until the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and 1–2 somites are left.\nCritical: Remove all yolk to ensure integrity of the PSM because yolk proteins interfere with fluorescent proteins.\nPlace one drop of ProLong Gold antifade reagent on a glass slide and transfer tissue into it using a lash tool (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nMake sure the tissue is dorsoventrally flattened (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nApply transparent nail polish and then fix with the coverslip on top gently (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E). Wait for 5 min for nail polish to dry before starting the imaging.\nCritical: Apply consistent amount of nail polish to control the PSM tissue thickness and imaging quality.\nCritical: Keep prepared slides in dark at 4°C, and complete imaging on the day of sample preparation.\nImaging\nTiming: 12 h to 7 days\nThis section describes steps and parameters for confocal imaging of flat-mounted smFISH and IHC stained samples (see Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] for microscopy and channel settings).",
    "Note: Resonant scanner confocal microscope is recommended to perform smFISH imaging. In our experiment, we used Nikon A1R HD confocal on TiE microscope with an Apo TIRF 100× Oil DIC N2 objective. For an equal comparison, do not change laser settings in the channels for RNA probes among the samples. On the other hand, you can set different laser powers and voltage in membrane and nucleus channels in order to achieve better cell segmentation. For an even imaging quality, periodically check laser strength.\nNote: Find appropriate laser settings for nucleus and membrane channels of each sample at the most anterior part of the tissue as the region of interest (i.e., PSM tissue) might be affected due to photobleaching. Signals should not be oversaturated but high enough to be detected in Imaris cell segmentation. In our case, 50–60 laser power and ∼60 PMT HV in DAPI channel, and 2–10 laser power and 10–20 in GFP channel depends on membrane injection and staining quality.\nCritical: As GFP can bleach quickly, avoid high laser power.\nNote: Since Channel 4 has a different integrate level, save it as a separate optical configuration in Nikon’s confocal NIS-Elements software.\nPut oil onto the lens of 100× objective.\nPlace specimen onto the stage.\nFind focus plane by ocular lenses.\nCheck nucleus (Hoechst) and membrane (GFP) signal at the most anterior part of the tissue and find appropriate laser power and PMT HV (see Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nOpen Acquire>Scan Large Image.

Then go to middle XY position and close “Scan Large Image” window.\nNote: Keep in mind the number of X and Y fields to use it while adding custom XY multipoints in the following step.\nGo to XY panel in the ND Acquisition window. Select “include Z”. Press Custom button. Under the Large Image section, select 100× objective, write number of X and Y fields, and 5% as overlap area (see Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3F).\nNote: This step adds custom XY multipoints, which cover the tissue, at the middle Z layer.\nNote: Deselect any multipoint if it doesn’t include the tissue because of rotated sample mounting.\nAdd optical configurations in to the λ (multichannel) panel in the ND Acquisition window (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nNote: While one of the optical configurations includes DAPI-TRITC-Cy5 channels, the other one includes FITC channel because they have different signal integration parameters.\nRun image.\nAnalysis\nTiming: 2 to 7 days\nThis section describes steps to analyze images.

Set nucleus diameter as 3 μm. Apply “smoothing” (filter width 0.3 μm), “background subtraction” (sphere diameter 1.2 μm) and “split nuclei by seed points”.\nSet automatic nuclei threshold (background subtraction), Then apply filter nuclei, “Nucleus Number of Voxels” between 8543 and 6.78e4.\nSelect cell detection type as “Detect Cell Boundary from Cell Membrane”. Set “cell smallest diameter” as 0.25 μm and “membrane detail” as zero.\nApply “Cell Volume” filter between 150 μm3 and 450 μm3.\nAs for vesicles, select channels for each RNA, set estimated dimeter as 0.5 μm, and apply background subtraction.\nFor each vesicle type, add “quality” filter, which is supposed to be high enough to detect one vesicle for each single RNA punctum.\nNote: Cell creation parameters can be stored and used for a batch analysis in Arena later.\nCritical: Embryos within the same batch should have similar quality score.\nAfter the end of cell segmentation (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B), export all cell statistics to file in XLS format (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) from every split images (see Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] for required cell statistics).",
    "Add a “Measurement Point” in the Surpass Tree list of the left-anterior and right-anterior files. Find anterior borders of the PSM tissue in each sample (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). Create “Somite” sheet in all anterior files (i.e., “TITLE_LA.xls” and “TITLE_RA.xls”). Add X-Y positions of two points in Cell A2-B2 for “Point A” and Cell A3-B3 for “Point B” in the “Somite” sheet (see Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E and 5F).\nMeasure angle and distance from the tail end of expression stripes of the segmentation clock in the PSM in all embryos in each genetic background (see Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A–6C). Then fit an equation to the data, i.e., “Angle_vs_Distance = delta_angle ∗ Distance + angle”, which provides “delta_angle” and “angle” to be used in “GENOTYPE_wVol.py” or “GENOTYPE_woVol.py” later for analysis (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).\nCritical: As the angles of stripes vary smoothly along the posterior-anterior axis, it is important to use comparable angles of slices with that of expression stripes.\nNoise calculation\nTransfer all XLS files into “XLS_to_XLSX” folder and convert XLS files to XLSX format using “xlsToxlsxIMARIS.py”.\nTransfer anterior XLSX files (i.e., “TITLE_LA.xlsx” and “TITLE_RA.xlsx”) into “Anterior” folder and posterior XLSX files (i.e., “TITLE_LP.xlsx” and “TITLE_RP.xlsx”) into “Posterior” folder.\nRun “separatePSM_volume_Green_farred.m” and “combineLRP_volume.m” in “Anterior” and “Posterior” folder, respectively, to calculate background from anterior files and combine sheets using MATLAB.\nNote: Make sure titles of vesicle sheets in the MATLAB codes are the same with the sheets in the XLSX files.\nTransfer all “TITLE_LA_PSM.xlsx”, “TITLE_RA_PSM.xlsx”, “TITLE_LP_PSM.xlsx”, and “TITLE_RP_PSM.xlsx” files into a “MergedPSM” folder and merge files using “merge_excel_FileInDirectory_wo_Vol.py” for without volume correction and “merge_excel_FileInDirectory_w_Vol.py” for with volume corrected RNA levels.",
    "Note: Check background values at “bgSomiteCount.xlsx”. Each tissue has two rows of background values either coming from left or right side of anterior PSM. Additionally, while columns B-E show raw values for mean or variance of farred and red spots in the somitic tissue, columns F-I show volume corrected background values. For raw RNA per cell distribution analysis, copy and paste row values, either from left or right anterior files, between columns B-E for every tissue into “SampleInfo.xlsx” file in the “Input” folder of “without volume corrected” excel files. For volume-corrected RNA variability (noise) analysis, copy and paste values between columns F-I, either from left or right anterior files, for every tissue into “SampleInfo.xlsx” file in the “Input” folder of “volume corrected” excel files.\nRename “TITLE_merged_w_Vol_PSM.xlsx” or “TITLE_merged_wo_Vol_PSM.xlsx” files with an ascending order number ending like “TITLE_wv_#.xlsx” or “TITLE_wov_#.xlsx”. Transfer them into the same “Input” folder together with “SampleInfo.xlsx” file, which has background values for each tissue.\nNote: Edit “Python name” in Column B in the “SampleInfo.xlsx” file in accordance with “TITLE_wv_#.xlsx” or “TITLE_wov_#.xlsx” excel filenames like “TITLE_wv_#” or “TITLE_wov_#”.\nRun “GENOTYPE_wVol.py” and “GENOTYPE_woVol.py” for each genetic background.\nNote: Make sure folder paths and filename formats are corrected in the python code.\nNote: If there is no stripy expression, use wild-type’s angle of expression and angle variation slope, which are 41.381 and 0.0403, respectively.\nTo compare transcriptional variabilities of different genetic backgrounds, run “COMPARE_GENETICBACKGROUNDS.py”.\nNote: Format: python COMPARE_GENETICBACKGROUNDS.py < number of genetic backgrounds> <number of bins for noise plots> <comparison outcome folder> <folders containing files to be compared (i.e., directory of “Output” folders of each genotype)> <genetic background names for labeling> <genetic background colors for plotting>\nNote: Example: python COMPARE_GENETICBACKGROUNDS.py 2 5 ../Compare/b567xher17_vs_her17/ ../wVol/b567xher17/Output/ ../wVol/her17/Output/ b567xher17 her17 b r."
