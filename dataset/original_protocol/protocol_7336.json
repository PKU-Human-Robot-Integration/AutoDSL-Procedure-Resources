    "Note: Working with liquid nitrogen is potentially dangerous and should be done with caution and proper protection (i.e., cryo-gloves, protective glasses, oxygen monitors, etc.). Sample Vitrification with High-Pressure Freezing (HPF) Note: For additional instructions and demonstrations of Procedure A, refer to Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Sample preparation with the waffle method. HPF sample preparation with the waffle method, including HPF planchette polishing (0:22) followed by application of 1-Hexadecene (2:25), waffle assembly in the HPF tip holder (2:50), and high pressure freezing of the waffle grid (4:10; Procedure A). For more information, including intermediate states of the planchettes, please refer to Supplementary Figure 1 in the original waffle paper (Kelley et al., 2022).Rigidify grids with an extra layer of carbon:Place grids on a glass slide, grid bar side down. Place the glass slide on the stage of a carbon evaporator, and evaporate 20 nm of carbon onto the film side of the grids.Sand and polish planchettes:Sand the flat side of Type B planchettes on 1,200, 7,000, and 15,000 grit sandpaper to get rid of the concentric rings present from manufacturing.Dip the flat side of the planchettes in POL metallpflege metal polish, and rub it by hand in circular motions on a piece of filter paper.Get rid of any excess polish with a Kimwipe tissue, then rub the planchettes on a piece of filter paper again to ensure all of the polish is gone.Coat planchettes in 1-Hexadecene:Place all planchettes flat side up on a piece of filter paper.Apply a droplet of 1-Hexadecene (4–6 μL) to the top of the planchette, then drag the pipette tip so the drop spreads onto the filter paper.Apply another droplet of 1-Hexadecene on top of the planchette.Keep the planchettes coated in 1-Hexadecene for at least 15 min before waffle assembly.Prepare a concentrated sample.",
    "Note: The sample should typically be as concentrated as possible while remaining pipette-able. However, the sample does not necessarily need to be viscous. Plasma clean carbon-rigidified grids:Plasma clean grids with the grid bar side up (extra carbon side down) using a recipe of 80% O2 gas and 20% H2 gas for 30 s, with a forward radio frequency (RF) target of 50 W.Waffle assembly:Blot away 1-Hexadecene from a planchette hat, and place it on the HPF holder tip, flat side up.Place the grid on the planchette hat, grid bar side up.Apply 5 µL of the sample to the grid.Blot away 1-Hexadecene from a second planchette hat, and place it on top of the sample, flat side down.If necessary, lightly blot away excess sample that has squeezed out of the planchette hats.Close the HPF tip.Tighten the assembly with tweezers.HPF:Note: Typically, with our setup (Wohlwend Compact 01 HPF), the HPF pressure is 2,100 bar. Transfer the assembled waffle sample to the HPF chamber.Vitrify the sample.Transfer the HPF holder into the liquid nitrogen chamber.Loosen the HPF holder tip, and remove the waffle assembly.Note: Ideally, the planchettes will separate fully from the grid. If the assembly is stuck together, use tweezers to press between the two planchettes; another pair of tweezers may be used to hold the assembly in place. If only one planchette hat separates, grab the grid by the outer rim and carefully lift it off of the other planchette hat. Clipping waffle gridsNote: Waffle clipping is done in the same setup as clipping of grids of conventional samples prior to cryo-FIB/SEM thinning with the addition of a stereoscope. Mark the notch of the AutoGrid with a marker (Figure 2A). This helps with grid bar alignment when clipping.",
    "It is also helpful for orienting the lamellae with respect to the TEM tilt axis during loading.Under a stereoscope and before clipping with a c-clip ring, rotate the grid with tweezers until the grid bars are square to the notch of the AutoGrid (Figure 2B, C). It is possible that the grid moves slightly while clipping, which is not detrimental to the method, as the grid bars are aligned primarily to maximize the area within a square where a lamella can be placed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4544/bioprotoc-12-21-4544-g002.jpgFigure 2. Waffle grid clipping after HPF. Properly orientating the grid bars helps to maximize the area within a square in which you can place a lamella. (A) Example of a cryo-FIB AutoGrid with the notch marked. The opposite side of the AutoGrid is shown with a marking that corresponds to the notch, which is visible during the clipping process. (B) Alignment of the grid bars as seen in a stereoscope without sample and (C) with sample in the grid clipping chamber.Sample Thinning using cryo-FIB Milling Notes:  Steps B1–B6, B8–B12, B14–B23, B25, and B29–B30 are done in xT software, B7, B13, and B23–B24 in MAPS, and B25–B28 and B31–B32 in AutoTEM. For additional instructions and a demonstration of how to prepare lamellae sites before automated milling, refer to Video 2. The process of automated milling is demonstrated in Video 3.Electron beam (EB) settings of 2 kV and 13 pA are kept throughout the whole protocol. Ion beam (IB) starting settings are 30 kV and 10 pA. While the IB voltage is kept the same throughout the protocol, currents are changed according to the text. For imaging, we typically use an ETD detector. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Setting up milling sites.",
    "Two-screen recording of xT, MAPS, and AutoTEM windows for the site preparation before automated milling of waffle lamellae (Procedure B). After creating a new project in MAPS, a SEM grid overview is recorded (0:08), followed by platinum sputtering and gas injection system (GIS) coating inside the instrument chamber, then defining of preliminary lamellae sites (1:09). Next, the grid is positioned orthogonally to the IB, and precuts are milled for several lamellae sites (1:24). After finishing the precuts, the grid is placed back to the mapping position, and a new grid overview is recorded (3:12) and used to define final lamellae sites (3:33). Then, an AutoTEM project is created, and eucentric positions, milling angle, and preliminary lamellae positions for each site are defined (3:35). Precleans and notch milling are shown starting at 5:25. Final lamellae placement is shown at 8:40.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. AutoTEM milling. Recording of automated milling in AutoTEM (Step B32d). First, Rough Milling, Medium Milling, Fine Milling, and Finer Milling are performed for each lamella (0:01). Then, Polishing 1 and Polishing 2 are performed for each lamella (0:45). Parameters are listed in Table 3.Before loading the specimen, purge the GIS lines. This step can be done while the FIB/SEM system is cooling down. No sample should be present during GIS purging.Wake up the system and switch on both beams, then make sure that the “touch alarm” is enabled.Apply a scan rotation of 180° to the EB and IB.Select the grid, then go to the predefined “Mapping” position.Lower the magnification, center on the grid, and focus the EB on the grid.Increase the magnification until one square is visible, focus the EB, and then link the Z height (press “link Z to FWD”).",

    "Click “Recover from Sputtering” when finished to shut down the sputtering functionality (the “Run” button should be active again).Go to the predefined “Deposition” position.Add a layer of organometallic platinum (also known as GIS platinum): in the cryo GIS Deposition tab, select a grid and define the timing. With our milling settings, specifically the milling angle, 2 min of GIS works well for lamellae being milled to 200 nm thickness, or 2 min 15 s for 150 nm thickness.Go back to the “Mapping” position.Define the ROIs and preliminarily lamellae sites.Notes:  For fluorescently labeled targets, ROIs and lamellae sites are defined based on the presence of fluorescence signals. This can be done either with a grid overview acquired in advance with an external cryo-FLM system, or with an internal FLM module. In both cases, MAPS allows for fluorescent image export, which is aligned with an EB grid overview. The general workflow for using fluorescence in FIB-SEM is described elsewhere, e.g., Gorelick et al. (2019). In most cases, the grid will have distinct features, which can be used for alignment (e.g., broken squares or the grid center mark). We typically perform three-point alignment. First, rough alignment is performed using three points; then, MAPS allows for fine adjustments. Alignments are usually performed after platinum sputtering and GIS coating. From the “Mapping” position, place the grid orthogonal to the IB:Notes:  Make sure that “touch alarm” is enabled during all steps. Additionally, one can lower the stage, then rotate it, tilt, and move the stage back up to move to the orthogonal position. Values are indicated for the standard TFS Aquilos 2 shuttle with 45° pretilt. For systems equipped with an iFLM, the shuttle pretilt is 27°, which requires tilting the stage to 25° in Step B14a. Rotate the stage to the actual value of 108.",
    "1°, or relative 180° from the Mapping position, then tilt the stage to 7°, so the IB angle is 90° to the sample.Save the shuttle position and use this saved position for future navigation.Wake up the system, which automatically shuts down after sputtering.With the IB at 10 pA current, navigate to one of the preliminary lamellae sites defined in Step B13.Adjust the contrast so that any features on the surface of the lamella site are clearly visible, then acquire an image, and focus the IB while the image is being acquired. This will minimize charging.Check the surface quality. Ideally, the surface should be “flat” and without contamination.Locate the grid bars. If they are not visible, mill small windows into the surface at 15 nA where you expect the grid bars to be (Figure 3). If you hit two or more orthogonal grid bars, draw the corresponding lines, extending to all the squares with preliminary lamellae sites (Kelley et al., 2022).Precuts:For 200-mesh grids where the grid bars are aligned during clipping, define rectangular milling patterns in {x,y} as {22 µm, 37 µm} (top) and {20 µm, 17 µm} (bottom), with the distance between the boxes set to 25 µm. Precut patterns for xT are available as Supplementary File 1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20221108/4544 Supplementary Files 1 3 s2.rar].Note: We recommend using these extensively-tested pattern dimensions while initially implementing the waffle method. Mill the patterns at 15 nA (milled precuts are shown in Figure 3D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4544/bioprotoc-12-21-4544-g003.jpgFigure 3. Milling precuts with the corresponding timing as in Video 2. Initial milling patterns (Supplementary File 1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20221108/4544 Supplementary Files 1 3 s2.rar]) are placed at the region of interest (A). Prior to milling, an additional smaller pattern (yellow pattern) is used to localize the grid bar location (B). The precut patterns are then adjusted to avoid the grid bars (C).",
    "The finished precuts are shown in panel (D).Change back to 10 pA, zoom out, navigate to the next preliminary lamella site, and repeat Steps B17–B20.Go back to the “Mapping” position.Acquire a new Tileset with the same parameters as in Table 1.Delete old preliminary lamellae sites and define new lamellae sites on the new grid overview according to the precut positions.Open AutoTEM and select the project with the same Project Name created in MAPS.Choose the corresponding template for milling, and apply it to all lamellae sites (Table 3).Table 3.

    "The template can be found as Supplementary File 3[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20221108/4544 Supplementary Files 1 3 s2.rar]. Initially, we recommend setting the Depth Correction to 100% for 10 μm lamellae length (see Notes for an additional discussion).Run “Preparation” for all lamellae sites in the “Guided” mode.Follow the prompts for eucentric tilt and milling angle (20°).Position the lamellae to guide the notch placement in Step B31.Prepare “Precleans” (Figure 4):Note: Confirm with EB images that material below the lamellae sites are milled away completely (Supplementary Figure 1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20221108/4544 Supplementary Figure 1 s1.docx]).Notes:  Steps B30b, d assume that apertures are aligned well, so there is no shift between milling patterns after changing the current. If there is a significant shift of milling windows between 10 pA and 7 nA or 3 nA, take a quick snapshot at the milling current in question to accurately position the rectangular milling pattern. Tilt the shuttle to a high milling angle, so the bottom of any material below each lamella is visible.Note: The standard Aquilos 2 shuttle has a 45° pretilt, and the maximum angle typically is around 25–30°. To reach the bottom of the material below lamellae, a standard shuttle might require moving the stage down in z. The iFLM shuttle has a 27° pretilt, and tilting the stage to achieve a high milling angle does not require moving the stage down. For the iFLM shuttle, a milling angle of 45° can be used as a starting point, followed by milling at 30°, and finally, at the milling angle in Step B30c. Define the milling rectangular pattern at 10 pA, and then mill at 7 nA until the bottom of the bulk material is gone (Figure 4A, B).Tilt to the final milling angle (20° in this protocol).",
    "Define the milling rectangular patterns at 10 pA and position the pattern a few microns away from the edge of the slab. Mill at 3 nA until the excess material is gone (Figure 4C). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4544/bioprotoc-12-21-4544-g004.jpgFigure 4. Precleans. Milling precleans with the corresponding timing, as in Video 2. (A, B) Milling at 7 nA is performed at high milling angles. (C) The stage is tilted to the milling angle (20° in this protocol), and a further preclean is performed at 3 nA current. In all cases, it is important to place milling patterns slightly below the edge of the slab (orange arrow), and to make sure that excess material below the potential lamella is milled away completely.Notch millingAlign the notch patterns in xT with the initial lamella position in AutoTEM (Figure 5A). This step does not have to be accurate since the lamella position will be redefined later.The total size of the notch pattern is 3.5 µm in x, 8.1 µm in y, and 3 µm in z. The size of the vertical patterns, except for the box on the side, is 3.5 µm in x and 0.2 µm in y, and vice versa for horizontal patterns. The overlap between patterns is 0.1 µm. The side pattern is 0.2 µm in x and 1.3 µm in y. The spacing between top and bottom parts is 1.1 µm (Figure 5B). The pattern can be found as Supplementary File 1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20221108/4544 Supplementary Files 1 3 s2.rar].Mill at 0.3 nA. With the z depth defined in Step B31b, milling should take ~2 min 15 s in total (Figure 5C). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4544/bioprotoc-12-21-4544-g005.jpgFigure 5.

(B) After digitally zooming on the pattern, the position of the Notch pattern with the defined dimensions is adjusted to be close to the edge of the slab. (C) Example of the milled notch before complete detachment.Final lamellae positioning:Rerun “Image Acquisition” and “Lamella placement.”Place the lamella ~1 µm away from the notch, with the top and bottom mill boxes overlapping with the notch, as shown in Figure 6. Typical lamellae dimensions are 12 µm × 15–20 µm × 150–200 nm.Run in step-wise mode based on the AutoTEM template in Table 3 and Supplementary File 3[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20221108/4544 Supplementary Files 1 3 s2.rar].Note: Step-wise mode is used to minimize contamination growth on lamellae after milling. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4544/bioprotoc-12-21-4544-g006.jpgFigure 6. Final lamella placement during the Preparation step in AutoTEM with the corresponding timing as in Video 2. Typical lamella dimensions are 12 μm in width, 10 µm length and 150 nm thick.Overtilts or Final Polishing:Note: This step is optional and performed depending on the final lamellae thickness and lamellae quality. If the lamella or GIS layer is damaged, do not perform automated post-milling operations.Otherwise, define a positive 0.5° overtilt (milling angle goes to 20.5°) in the Polishing 2 step, and run automated milling only for that step. Alternatively, manually place a CCS milling pattern on top of the lamella. In both cases, milling for 1–2 min is sufficient."
