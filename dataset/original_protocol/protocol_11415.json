    "Human adipose tissues for mesenchymal stem cell isolation were obtained from the department of Plastic Surgery of the Tergooi Hospital (Hilversum, Netherlands) after approval by the Institutional Ethical Committee and written informed consent. GFP-positive adipose MSCs were obtained from the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences for Children and Adults (University of Modena and Reggio Emilia).\nAnimal experiments were performed in accordance with the Dutch law on animal experimentation, and the protocol was approved by the committee on animal experimentation of the VU University medical center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n1. Isolation of Tumor-Secreted Extracellular Vesicles.\nPrepare EV-depleted Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) by centrifuging FBS at 70,000 x g overnight (16 hours), no brake, at 4 °C using an ultra-swinging bucket rotor (expect 1 h for deceleration). Carefully collect the supernatant (EV-depleted FBS) without disturbing the pellet. Filter the EV-depleted FBS with a 0.22 µm filter.\nPrepare EV-depleted culture medium by supplementing Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine (1x P/S/G) and 5% EV-depleted FBS.\nSeed 3 x 106 143B cells in 175 cm2 flasks and culture them in EV-depleted culture medium in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. When the cells are 80 - 90% confluent (typically after 36 h to 48 h), collect the supernatant from 8x 175 cm2 flasks (28 mL/flask) for EV-isolation.\nPre-clear the cell supernatant to remove cells and cell debris by differential centrifugation (centrifuging the supernatant of the previous spin each time) according to the following protocol:\n\t\nCentrifuge the supernatant twice at 500 x g for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the supernatant twice at 2000 x g for 15 min.\nCentrifuge the supernatant twice at 10,000 x g for 30 min.",
    "Perform all centrifugations at 4 °C with maximum acceleration and deceleration speed settings. After each step, carefully collect the EV-containing supernatant, leaving about 1 mL behind. Proceed immediately to step 1.5 or store the pre-cleared conditioned medium at -80 °C until EV isolation.\nIsolate EVs by centrifuging the pre-cleared conditioned medium once at 70,000 x g for 1 h, slow brake, at 4 °C in ultra-centrifuge tubes (final volume 38.5 mL/tube) using an ultra-swinging bucket rotor.\nCarefully remove the supernatant, leaving about 1 mL behind, resuspend the EV-containing pellets in the remaining volume, pool them all in one ultracentrifuge tube, and add phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) until complete tube filling (final volume 38.5 mL).\nCentrifuge once again at 70,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C, without brake (expect 1 h for deceleration). Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and leave 100 - 200 µL behind.\nResuspend the EV-pellet and adjust the final volume to 200 µL with PBS (standardized for all EV-isolations). Use the EV preparation immediately or store at -80 °C until use22.\n\tNOTE: EVs can be stored up to 6 months at -80 °C.\n2. EV Characterization.\nPurified EVs can be visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)23.\nMix EV preps with an equal volume of 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer.\nCoat 200 mesh Formvar-carbon-coated nickel TEM grids with 5 µL of EV suspension for 20 min at room temperature.\nFixate the EV samples on TEM grids with 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), contrast with uranyl oxalate (pH 7.0), and embed in a mixture of 4 % uranyl acetate and 2 % methyl cellulose in a 1:9 ratio on ice.",
    "Remove grids with stainless steel loops and blot the excess fluid with filter paper to ensure an appropriate thickness of the methyl cellulose film.\nAfter drying, examine grids with a transmission electron microscope and capture images with a digital camera coupled to the corresponding image software.\n3. Education of MSCs by tumor-derived EVs.\nPrepare MSC culture medium by supplementing alpha-minimum essential medium (alpha-MEM) with 4% EV-depleted human Platelet Lysate (hPL)24, heparin (10 U/mL) and 1x P/S/G.\n\tNOTE: EV-depleted hPL is obtained following the procedure described in section 1.1.\nSeed 1.4 x 106 adipose-derived MSCs per 75 cm2 flask and culture them in EV-depleted MSC-culture medium in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nWhen cells reach 70% confluence, add 143B osteosarcoma- or control human fibroblasts (hf)-EVs, 10 µL EV preparation/cm2 of culture flask. Incubate for 24 hours and add the same amount of EVs for additional 6 hours. NOTE: Human fibroblasts are cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) 10% FBS and EVs are isolated as described in section 1.\nCollect the MSC supernatant, centrifuge 1x at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (with maximum acceleration and deceleration speed settings), transfer to a new tube and store the cleared supernatant at -80 °C to enable future cytokine analysis (section 5).\nFor in vivo experiments (section 6), educate GFP-positive MSCs25 as described in sections 3.1 to 3.3, collect the cells and resuspend them in PBS at a final concentration of 106 cells per 100 µL. Keep cells on ice until injection.\n4. EV Internalization Assay.\nTo visualize EV uptake by MSCs, label EVs with a green-fluorescent linker dye (GFLD) (commercially available) following the manufacturer's protocol:",
    "Briefly, add 180 µL of diluent to the 200 µL EV prep. Dilute 1 µL of GFLD dye in 50 µL of diluent, and add 20 µL of diluted dye to the diluted EV prep.\nGently mix by pipetting and incubate for 3 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAdd 5 mL of 0.1 % BSA in PBS, transfer to ultra-centrifuge tubes and fill the tube with PBS (final volume 38.5 mL/tube).\nCentrifuge 1x at 70,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C, without brake (expect 1 h for deceleration). Carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the labeled EV-pellet in a final volume of 200 µL (adjust volume with PBS).\nAdd the labeled EVs to the MSC culture or store them at -80 °C. After overnight incubation, assess vesicle internalization by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry7.\n5. Assessment of MSC Cytokine Expression Profile.\nFor the multiplex quantification of interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70) protein levels in the MSC conditioned medium (see step 3.4), use a commercially available cytometric bead array (CBA) for human inflammatory cytokines following the manufacturer's instructions.\nBriefly, mix the antibody-conjugated capture beads and add them to all assay tubes. Add the cytokine standard dilutions or the conditioned medium samples to the tubes.\nAdd the detection reagent and incubate 3 hours at RT.\nWash the beads with the supplied washing solution. Measure the samples using a flow cytometer and analyze the data according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n6. Generation of an Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model of Osteosarcoma.\nAllow six-week-old, female, Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu mice to acclimatize for at least one week before starting the experimental procedures.",
    "One day before the surgical procedure and as peri-operative analgesia add paracetamol to the drinking water. Dilute \"paracetamol solution for kids\" (see Table of Materials) with water to get a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. Based on an average water intake of 150 mL/kg/day, and an average body weight of 20 g, this dose is sufficient to reach a dosage of 6 mg/mouse/day (300 mg/kg/day).\nContinue analgesic treatment until 24 hours after the operation, or longer if the animals show signs of pain.\nOn the day of the surgical procedure, collect cultured luciferase-positive (Fluc) 143B cells (previously generated by lentiviral transduction) by centrifuging at 300 x g for 10 min and resuspend the cells at a concentration of 2 x 105 cells/µL in PBS. Keep the cell suspension on ice up to 6 hours.\nAutoclave surgical equipment. Prepare and clean the working area and place the sterilized scissors and tweezers on sterile sheets. Twenty min before the surgical procedure (step 6.8), inject the animals subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, diluted in 0.9% saline) as analgesic using 0.5 mL insulin syringes (29-gauge needle).\nJust before anesthetizing each animal, fill a 10 µL syringe with at least 1 µL of the concentrated (Fluc) 143B cell suspension (see step 6.4).\nAnesthetize the animal with isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (2 - 3% in oxygen). Check the level of anesthesia by toe-pinching the animal. When the animal does not react to the pinching, i.e., it is deeply anesthetized, apply ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness during anesthesia.\nPosition the animal on its back with the head in an anesthesia mask and with the legs towards the operator. Flex the left knee. Wipe the skin with 70% ethanol and apply lidocaine (2%) with a cotton tip 3 times as local analgesic.",
    "Use a sterile surgical knife to make a small incision (approximately 5 mm) on the skin just below the knee to expose the tibia. Drill a pinhole in the tibia, approximately 2 mm below the knee using a 0.8 mm micro twist drill. Be cautious not to drill through both tibia cortices.\nInject 1 µL cell suspension (approximately 2 x 105 cells) slowly (in approximately 5 seconds) into the hole using a 26-gauge needle. Close the hole with a droplet of tissue glue to prevent backflow of the suspension.\nClose the skin with monofilament sutures and one drop of tissue glue. Let the animal recover in a well-heated environment (use a heat lamp). Do not leave animals unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Only after the animals are fully recovered from anesthesia, return them to their own cages.\nTwo days after tumor inoculation, inject EV educated or naïve GFP-positive MSCs (106 cells in 100 µL PBS, see step 3.5) intravenously with a 0.5 mL insulin syringe in the tail vein of the mice.\nFollow tumor growth by bioluminescence imaging26 twice a week. To this end, inject the mice i.p. with 150 µL D-luciferin (30 mg/mL) with an insulin syringe. Ten min after injection, position the animals in the bioluminescence imaging system and measure the photon-flux generated by tumor cells.\nIn addition, measure the diameter of the primary bone-tumor with a caliper. The tumor volume (in mm3) is estimated by width x length2 x 0.5.\nNOTE: Humane endpoints are defined as tumor diameter >15 mm or weight loss >15%.\n7. Assessment of Lung Nodule Number\nWhen one of the animals reaches the humane endpoint defined in step 6.14 (in approximately 3 - 4 weeks), terminate the experiment and collect and analyze all relevant tissues.",
    "Ten min before euthanization, inject 150 µL D-luciferin (30 mg/mL) with a 0.5 mL insulin syringe.\nAnesthetize the animals with isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (see step 6.7). Confirm the depth of anesthesia by the absence of reactions of the mouse to toe-pinching. Euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation27.\nCollect lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys using sterilized scissors and tweezers. Wash the organs in PBS to remove blood traces and put them on a Petri dish.\nPlace the Petri dish with the organs in the bioluminescence imaging system. Measure the bioluminescence signal on both sides of the organs. Immediately after measuring, plunge the organs in 4% formalin to fixate them  (24 - 72 hours, at RT) for future histological analysis.\nProcess the obtained pictures with appropriate imaging software by manual thresholding. Count the number of lung nodules on each picture. Count the total number of lung nodules on both sides of the lungs.\n8. Histological Analysis\nFor histological analysis of the lung tissues:\n\t\nEmbed the formalin-fixed organs in paraffin and prepare 6 µm tissue slides.\nDeparaffinate the lung tissue slides and perform antigen retrieval by boiling them for 15 min in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6).\nIncubate the slides horizontally at room temperature with anti-human vimentin antibody (200 µg/mL) diluted 1:150 in antibody-diluent (commercially available) and subsequently with the secondary, HRP-labeled antibody (0.5 mg/mL, dilution 1:500). Stain the tissues with 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and hematoxylin counter staining.\nObserve the stained tissue slides using an optical microscope coupled to the corresponding camera and image software.\nTo assess the presence of GFP-positive MSCs in mouse tibias:\n\t\nDecalcify the tibias in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 0.24 M, pH 7.2 - 7.4. Refresh EDTA buffer every other day until bones become flexible (approximately 1 week).",
    "Dehydrate tibias and infiltrate them with paraffin. Embed the tibias (including osteosarcoma tissue) in paraffin blocks.\nUse a microtome to prepare 6 µm paraffin sections. Place the paraffin sections onto glass slides. After drying, store slides overnight at room temperature.\nPerform heat-mediated antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (see 8.1.2) and stain the tissues with anti-GFP antibody (whole antiserum) in a 1:900 dilution in antibody-diluent. Counterstain the tissues with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).\nObserve the tissue slides with a fluorescence microscope coupled to the corresponding imaging software.\nSubscription Required.
