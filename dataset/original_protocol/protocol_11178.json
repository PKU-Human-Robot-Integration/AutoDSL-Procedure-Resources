    "1. Preparation of SG imaginal ring tumor\nCross adult flies with genotypes of UAS-NICD (Male: 10-15 flies) and Act-Gal4, UAS-GFP/CyO; tub-Gal80ts (Virgin female: 10-15 flies) and allow them to breed for 1 day at 18 °C. The selected adult flies should be 5-9 days old to ensure high fertility.\nAllow the adult flies to lay eggs in the fly food contained in vials for 24 h at 18 ˚C, then remove the adult flies.\n\tNOTE: Fly food is prepared using the standard cornmeal food recipe from Drosophila Stock Center8. Each vial should contain around 10mL of fly food.\nAllow the eggs to incubate for 6 days at 18 °C. During this period, the larvae will hatch.\nTransfer the vials containing larvae to a 29 °C incubator and incubate for another 7 days.\n\t​NOTE: This incubation step is optional depending on the specific experimental design.\n2. Preparation of adult wild type Drosophila for allotransplantation\nAnesthetize wild type or appropriate mutant adult flies with 100% CO2 and sort flies based on sexes. Both male and female flies can be used as tumor hosts.\nSecure a 5 cm long piece of fly tape to a microscope slide with the sticky side up by fixing it with two smaller pieces of tape, one at each end.\nImmobilize the flies by adhering their wings to the tape. Use forceps while maneuvering the flies.\n\t\nRepeat the above step for 60-80 adult flies used as allograft acceptors.\n\t\tNOTE: It is best to organize flies into neat rows, with their body axis aligned parallel to each other for a more time-efficient injection process later. Figure 1 shows rows of host flies taped down in this manner.\n3. Assembly of the autoinjector apparatus\nConnect both the autoinjector apparatus and power cord to the controller box.",
    "Set the injection volume to 59.8 nL. This will help maintain the appropriate amount of suction and injection forces during allotransplantation.\nPlace the controller box and the autoinjector on opposite sides of the light microscope.\n\tNOTE: For right-handed operators, the control box should be placed on the left side of the microscope with the injector on the right side. Vice versa for left-handed operators.\nPrepare the 3.5'' glass capillary for use by clipping off the closed end with forceps.\n\t\nProcess one end of the glass capillary using a four-step micropipette puller and heat to a narrow, closed end using the following specifications in the instrument: Heat = 650, Force = 200, and Distance = 8. Neatly place the capillaries into the puller apparatus and run the program after inputting the above settings.\nUse forceps to clip the capillary at an approximately 60° angle to make a sharper end for easy entry into the adult fly abdomen1. See Figure 2 for an example of a well-clipped capillary.\nLightly unscrew the cap of the injector. Hold down the Empty button to advance the injector needle until 70%-80% of its total length is showing. To accelerate capillary advancement, press the Fill button once while simultaneously holding down the Empty button.\nUse a syringe to fill the glass capillary with mineral oil. Then, carefully insert the glass capillary onto the injector needle until the former is firmly attached to the rubber stopper of the injector. Now screw the injector cap tight.\n\t\nWipe off the mineral oil residue on the external surface of the glass capillary cover to avoid contaminating the medium during allotransplantation.\n4. Dissection of the SG imaginal ring tumor",
    "Select one of the larvae and transfer it to a dissection plate filled with 100 µL of Schneider's Medium to prepare for SG imaginal ring tumor dissection.\n\t​NOTE: Only the specimens harboring the tumor will remain as larvae. This is because tumor growth delays larval development and progression9. Two thirds of the specimens will not harbor the tumor and will thus have progressed to pupae/adults.\n\t\nFor dissection and allotransplantation purposes, use a stereomicroscope with a 10x-20x magnification range.\nUsing one pair of forceps to hold the mid-section of the larval body, pinch the larval head using another pair of forceps and apply a stretching force lengthwise.\nLocate the Y-shaped SG of the larvae and isolate it from the rest of the larval tissue10.\nDissect and isolate the SG imaginal ring tumor by removing the adjacent tissue. See Figure 3 for a depiction of this dissection process.\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.4 for an additional 10 to 20 SG imaginal ring tumors based on research needs.\n5. Allograft of primary SG imaginal ring tumor\nSubmerge the capillary into the Schneider's Medium containing the primary SG imaginal ring tumors. Hold the Fill button to fill the glass capillary with Schneider's Medium all the way to the top 0.5 cm segment. This top segment should remain filled with mineral oil.\n\tNOTE: Accelerate this process by pressing the Empty button once while simultaneously holding down the Fill button.\nLocate a primary tumor and press the Fill button until the tumor is suctioned into the capillary.",
    "Ensure that the tumor sits at the tip of the capillary or several millimeters away from the tip of the capillary. This helps avoid the tumor drifting and becoming lost in the solution contained within the capillary. See Figure 4A for a demonstration of the appropriate tumor location as it sits in the capillary.\nLocate an adult fly immobilized to the tape on the microscope slide. Using forceps, gently hold down the lower abdomen. Then, pierce the lower lateral cuticle of the abdomen with the capillary. Press the Empty button until the tumor enters the new host abdomen. See Figure 4B for a demonstration of this technique.\nUsing forceps, gently pinch the wings of the host up to remove it from the tape. Place the host into a new vial with fresh food. It is best to place the vial sideways for the initial 24 h after injection. Each vial should only contain up to a maximum of 20 flies.\n\tNOTE: Some host flies will have missing wings and other wounds on their bodies after injection and may stick to the fly food if the vial is placed upright.\nRepeat steps 5.2 through 5.4 to transplant the remaining primary tumors into their new adulthosts.\nDispose capillaries into sharps' container and clean the mineral oil residue from the exterior of the autoinjector before replacing the apparatus back into its box.\nStore the vial of hosts at room temperature for 1 day, then transfer the vial to an incubation chamber at 29 ˚C. Transfer fly hosts to new vials every 2-3 days.\nMonitor the fly hosts daily and calculate survival rates. After a week, tumors should be visible under a stereo microscope with fluorescence adapter and can be continually monitored for their size and progression.\n6. Re-allograft of transplanted tumors",
    "Around 10-14 days post-allograft, screen for tumors that have grown in the host abdomens using a fluorescence microscope.\nAnesthetize a host with CO2 and place it in a dissection plate filled with 100 μL Schneider's Medium. Dissect the grown allografted tumor out of the host using two pairs of forceps.\n\t\nUse one pair of forceps to hold down the abdomen and the other pair to incise open the abdominal cuticle, exposing the allografted tumor1.\nCarefully isolate the tumor from the attached host tissues as much as possible using fluorescence markers as guidance.\nRepeat step 6.2 to prepare for two to three additional allografted tumors.\nTransfer the dissection plate containing the harvested tumors onto the stage of a light microscope.\nUse sterile needles and dissect the tumors into smaller pieces that are appropriate for the capillary size.\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.5 to prepare the new generation of adult hosts and repeat steps 5.1-5.7 to complete the allotransplantation of the tumors.\n\tNOTE: Success rates are generally higher for non-primary tumors compared with those of primary tumors.\nRepeat steps 6.1-6.6 for every subsequent generation of flies used in the study.\n\tNOTE: Choose Drosophila host lines appropriate for the experimental needs.\nSubscription Required.
