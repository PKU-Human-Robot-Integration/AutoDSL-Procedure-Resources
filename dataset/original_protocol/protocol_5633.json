    "PreparationMake the solutions listed in Recipes section.Sterilize 40 x 0.13 mm coverslips (depending on the manufacturer, they may need to be acid treated in 1 N HCl first; 10 min room temperature, followed by 3 rinses in sterile distilled water).Clean the flexiPERM cones in cleaning solution (50 ml or so–the exact volume does not matter) at 70 °C for 10 min. Rinse them 3 x and store them in sterile distilled water.Isolation of E11.5 mouse kidney rudiments Note: Takes about 20 min per pregnant mouse in skilled hands, a lot longer for beginners. Absolute beginners are advised to begin by isolating E12.5 kidneys before moving on to harder-to-see E11.5 kidneys. All steps should be done under sterile conditions. Sacrifice the pregnant mother mouse by methods appropriate to the local animal licence and laws.Remove the uterus.In a large Petri dish, immerse the uteri in dissecting medium and use a scalpel to cut between bulges in the uterus: ‘rolling’ the curved edge of the scalpel over the tissue to be cut is easier than pulling it in the conventional way. Squeeze the embryo out of the cut end next to it with the forceps. Remove the heads of the embryos, and any placental/membrane material. (Figure 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210182745_0109.jpgFigure 2. Illustration of the E11.5 metanephric kidney isolation. A. The pregnant uterus; B.

The rear of the embryo, after cutting it sagittally into two halves; the arrow points towards the metanephric kidney, edges of which are marked in white in the detail (seeing the kidney is the hardest part of the dissection, and takes practise). F. The isolated E11.5 metanephric kidney.",
    "Scale bar for A-C is 5 mm, for D and E is 1 mm, and 0.5 mm for F.Transfer the embryo trunks to a 60 mm dish filled to about 5 mm depth with dissecting medium (the precise amount can be altered to suit individual preferences), which can be used straight from storage at 4 °C.Using fine needles as dissecting instruments (see Materials and Reagents for details), transect the embryos just rostral to the hind limb buds. Retain the portions with the hind limb buds (these can be stored for a few days or transported on ice: see Davies, 2006, for details of the method).Remove the tails (which are otherwise a springy nuisance while dissecting).Lay each rear-end fragment of the embryo ventral-side-down, and cut it sagittally, directly down from the mid-line of the neural tube to its ventral surface.Inspect each half created in the last step, from the cut (anatomically medial) surface, and identify the kidney rudiment, which lies (at E11.5) next to the cranial limit of the hind limb bud. The ureteric bud diverticulum of the nephric duct is the most obvious spatial cue, and the extend of the metanephrogenic mesenchyme can be seen by a slight change in light-scattering properties (on some microscopes it appears lighter than the surrounding mesoderm, and on some it appears darker).Dissect the kidney rudiment free of the rest of the embryo, pinning tissue down with one needle and drawing the other needle against it to make accurate cuts, and transfer the kidney to a new dish in which rudiments can be pooled for later use (pulled glass pipettes provide one means of transferring rudiments easily: the heat of melting the glass to pull them will sterilize their ends).",
    "Note: Throughout the dissection, care should be taken to ensure that media are not left in air for so long that they become alkaline (the pH indicator in the medium will indicate this by a colour change. We suggest 15 min as a maximum but air movement may mean shorter times are needed. In our experience, HEPES inhibits normal kidney development and we avoid its use).Sebinger culturePut the cover slips and the silicone cones in 80 °C oven for 20 min to dry (dryness is essential for proper adhesion between the silicone cone and the cover slips). They can be handled with gloved hands or forceps–use plastic forceps for cones to avoid damage that might result from the use of metal.Place a cone, narrow-end down, on to the coverslip and use a blunt-ended forceps to press the edge of the silicone cone against the cover slip to ensure tight adhesion.Place the cover slip with the silicone cone attached to it on the base of a 60 mm Petri dish. (Figure 3)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210182932_0536.jpgFigure 3. The Sebinger culture method. A. Shows the different component of the culture system. B. Shows the assembled Sebinger culture system.Pipette a kidney rudiment into the approximate centre of the glass circle defined by the cone.Working quickly to avoid the risk of the tissue drying out, pipette away any medium carried over with the kidney rudiment, and place 85 μl of culture medium in the circle. It can be used straight from cold storage. Use a pipette tip to ensure that this medium spreads to cover the whole of the circle of glass bounded by the cone, including the kidney, and does not ‘bead’ into a single drop (Figure 4). Note that the optimal amount of medium varies slightly with batches of cones and with the glass.",
    "We therefore recommend that users try a series of volumes (e.g., 80, 82.5, 85. 97.5, 90 μl) with their own materials to determine the optimum.Place the 60 mm dish (with the cover slip, the silicone cone and the kidney rudiment now inside it) to the base of a 100 mm Petri dish and add 3 ml of hydration buffer into it (when the hydration buffer comes in contact with the silicone cone it detaches the cone from the cover slip and the system becomes leaky, this is why we use a separate dish to add the hydration buffer). (Figure 4)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210183032_0367.jpgFigure 4. The arrangement of the cone and dishes. A. Kidney rudiments are cultured in the centre of the silicone cone in a low volume of KCM medium and a humidifying buffer is added to the outer dish to prevent dryness. B. The KCM tends to bead as a single drop (left hand side image) and need to be distributed with a pipette tip to cover the glass circle enclosed by the silicone cone (right hand side image).Place the lid on the 100 mm Petri dish then place the dish in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% humidity). Kidneys can be cultured for 3 days; beyond that it is advisable to change the medium. A few cells at the periphery may egress and make a monolayer on the glass but the kidney as a whole should remain intact and coherent, as in Figure 1A. If it ‘rounds up’ but is still alive there is probably too much medium; if it rounds up as a dried mass, there is too little.Note: For time-lapse filming, we recommend in-incubator microscopes from Etaluma.Specimens should be fixed on their cover-slip, according to the protocol appropriate for any antibody staining to be used.",
    "We generally apply 100% methanol at -20 °C immediately after removing the culture medium, and allow it to warm to room temperature over 15 min, then wash in phosphate-buffered saline. If alternative fixation techniques involve detergents (Tween, Triton etc.), great care should be taken to change solutions very gently to avoid detaching the culture from the glass. Incubation in antibody is usually overnight at 4 °C in Bijou (5 ml) bottles. An example protocol, used for the laminin stain in Figure 1, is overnight incubation in 200 μl 1/100 anti-laminin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 4 °C, a 7 h wash in PBS at 4 °C, overnight incubation in 200 μl 1/100 FITC anti-rabbit (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 4 °C, two 2 h washes in PBS at 4 °C, followed by mounting, still on the filter, on a slide in PBS or 1:1 PBS-glycerol, with the cover-slip being held away from the main slide with fragments a broken coverslip used as spacers. This prevents crushing of the tissue. We do not embed or section."
