    "All the patients signed informed consent before examination according to approval of the local ethical committee (OGYÉI/12743/2018).\n1. Preparation\nStart the examination with patient preparation: ensuring at least a 4-hour fasting status, questionnaire about problems with swallowing and known upper gastrointestinal diseases.\nEnsure that written informed consent is read and signed.\nPrepare an intravenous line before the examination.\nPosition the patient in a left lateral decubitus position.\nAdminister mild sedation using intravenous midazolam (2.5-5 mg).\nMonitor ECG and oxygen saturation.\n2. Image acquisition\nVisualization of the left PVs\n\t\nInsert the probe into the oesophagus at approximately 30-40 cm from the front teeth.\nIn the upper (or mid) transoesophageal probe position visualize the LAA using 2D image acquisition at 20-45°.\nTurn the probe slightly clockwise and change the crystal angulation to 60-80° in order to centralize the LAA on the image.\nClick the full volume button in order to applying full volume 3D acquisition.\nAdjust the image’s lateral and elevational width to display the LAA and the left upper PV. This enhances visualization of the left lateral ridge.\nOptimize the image quality (adjusting the depth and gain, applying harmonic imaging).\nRecord a one-beat (if feasible, multibeat) loop with 2 cardiac cycles.\nChange the angulation to approximately 120° on the 2D image to centralize the LAA.\nTurn the probe slightly counterclockwise and apply anteflexion to visualize the ostia of the left PVs.\nApply color Doppler-coded imaging to confirm that both the upper and lower PVs are visible.\nClick the full volume button in order to applying full volume 3D acquisition.\nAdjust the image’s lateral and elevational width to display the left PVs. This enhances visualization of the ostia of the left upper and lower PVs and the intervenous ridge.",
    "Control dataset quality. Check the recorded dataset. If the dataset does not contain both the upper and lower PVs, change the patient position by further tilting to the lateral position, and repeat the procedure from step 2.1.8.\nAcquire 3D full volume datasets from the left PVs: one-beat (if feasible, multibeat) loop with 2 cardiac cycles.\nConfirm the visibility of PV ostia by cropping the image to the upper or lower PV ostium, respectively. The lower PV ostium requires a specifically careful confirmation. It is not unsual, that some parts of the ostium are outside the 3D dataset due to anatomical reasons, e.g. angulation or close proximity to the transducer.\nIn case the image is not suitable for visualizing the complete PV structure, repeat the procedure from step 2.1.10. Change the lateral or elevational width of the 3D dataset, if necessary.\nVisualization of the right PVs\n\t\nSwitch back to 2D mode and focus the image to the LAA at 45° upper (or mid) oesophageal probe position.\nTurn the probe clockwise and move the probe head to anteflexion position in order to visualize the right PVs.\nApply color Doppler-coded imaging to confirm that both the upper and lower PVs are visible.\nClick the full volume button in order to applying full volume 3D acquisition.\nAdjust the image’s lateral and elevational width to display the right PVs. This enhances visualization of the ostia of the right upper and lower PVs and the intervenous ridge. This image can be used to identify the presence of supernumerary PVs.\nAcquire 3D full volume datasets from the right PVs: one-beat (if feasible, multibeat) loop with 2 cardiac cycles.",

Change the lateral or elevational width of the 3D dataset, if necessary.\n3. 3D image reconstruction and measurements\nOffline 3D multiplanar reconstruction\n\t\nActivate the 3D analysis software on your scanner or workstation (Philips: activate the 3DQ software in QApps panel; Tomtec: activate the 4D Cardio-view 3 application; GE: activate the FlexiSlice software).\nSelect a frame in diastolic phase for the measurements. For standardization, it is recommended to select a frame timed to the T wave.\nSet the two perpendicular planes to the requested structure (left lateral ridge or each PVs ostium) and adjust plane direction while the 3rd plane represents the en face view of the examined structure.\nOn the left panel, select the measurement option. The en face view is suitable for measurements (diameter, area, distance).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
