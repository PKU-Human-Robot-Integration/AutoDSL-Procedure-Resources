    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details related to all the materials, reagents, and instruments used in this protocol.\n1. Extraction of IgY from egg yolks\nHygienization of the eggs\n\t\nImmerse the eggs (freshly laid or until 4 days post-laid, from the Gallus gallus Dekalb White lineage) in a 0.2% diluted solution of sodium hypochlorite, rinse quickly under running water, and wipe gently for later or immediate use.\n\t\tNOTE: If not used immediately, keep at 4 °C for up to 15 days.\nSeparation of the yolks\n\t\nBreak the egg carefully, and separate the yolk from the white with the help of a yolk separator.\nRemove the excess white with the help of filter paper. Pierce the yolk, and collect its interior into a 50 mL conical tube. Store the yolk at −20 °C for at least 24 h prior to use.\n\t\tNOTE: During these experiments (data not shown), it was observed that the use of yolks that had not been frozen previously hindered the isolation of immunoglobulins from the lipid portion of the yolks.\nAcidification of the yolks\n\t\nThaw the stored yolk and dilute it at a 1:10 ratio in 1 mM PBS. Adjust the pH of the solution to 5 with 1 N HCl, and incubate the solution at 4 °C for 6-24 h.\nCentrifuge the solution at 3,000 × g for 40 min, recover the supernatant, and filter it using a 0.7 mm cellulose filter.\nPrecipitation of lipids with caprylic acid\n\t\nReadjust the pH of the supernatants to 5, and add the caprylic acid (≥98% initial concentration) to a final concentration of 8.7% under constant stirring for 30 min at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: The volume of the supernatant may vary depending on the lipid mass precipitated in step 1.3.2. Thus, for example, 3.107 mL of caprylic acid should be added to 35 mL of the supernatant obtained after filtration.\nCentrifuge the samples for 15 min at 18,600 × g, and separate the supernatant from the precipitated material.\nReadjust the pH of the solution to 7.4 using 1 M NaOH, quantify the antibodies using the Bradford assay8, and store the antibodies at −20 °C until the time of use.\n\t\tNOTE: The antibodies were obtained at a concentration of 1 µg/µL, which was verified by means of a 12% SDS-PAGE gel.\n2. Saturation curve of IgY antibodies to latex beads\nCoupling of the beads to the IgY antibodies\n\t\nAdd 21 µL of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC, initial concentration of 367 mM) and 21 µL of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, initial concentration of 50 mM) to 21 µL of latex beads (4% w/v), and adjust to a final volume of 2.1 mL with filtered 10 mM PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The pH range of the PBS solution should be between 7.2 and 7.4, since in this work, a negative change in the coupling and other steps was observed when using a solution outside this range.\nIncubate at 22 °C with rapid shaking for 3 h.\nAdd 4 µg, 2 µg, 1 µg, 0.5 µg, 0.25 µg, 0.125 µg, and 0 µg of the previously extracted capture antibody IgY-PfHRP2 (see step 1.4.3) to different microtubes containing 100 µL of the solution described in step 2.1.1 (0.04% final bead concentration), and incubate under the same conditions as described in step 2.1.2 for 16 h.",
    "Centrifuge the samples at 857 × g at 15 °C for 5 min, discard the supernatants, and wash the latex beads twice with 500 µL of filtered 10 mM PBS (0.008% final bead concentration) using centrifugation and resuspension cycles.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exceed 857 × g, as in this work, it was observed that beyond this speed the beads undergo deformations that negatively alter the test result.\nBlocking the beads\n\t\nResuspend the samples in 1 mL of blocking buffer (0.004% final bead concentration) (filtered 10 mM PBS + bovine serum albumin, BSA, 5%), and incubate under the same conditions as described in step 2.1.2 for 2 h.\nAfter blocking, wash as described in step 2.1.4, and resuspend in 10 mM PBS buffer.\nIncubation with anti-chicken secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488\n\t\nAdd 100 µL of fluorescent anti-chicken antibody (2 mg/mL) diluted to 1:2,000 in 10 mM PBS + 0.5% BSA to each microtube, as described in step 2.1.3.\nIncubate the samples as described in step 2.1.2, this time in the dark, for 30 min.\nWash the beads as in step 2.1.4, and resuspend with 250 µL of (0.016% final bead concentration) filtered 10 mM PBS. Perform the flow cytometer reading as described in section 5.\n\t\tNOTE: From the fluorescence percentage data obtained, observe the initial point of plateau formation (1 µg, as observed in this study). We recommend using the plateau's second point (2 µg, as observed here) for the next steps (Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65123/65123fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Graph of the flow cytometry analysis to determine the saturation point of the IgY-PfHRP2 antibody coupling to the latex beads.

    "3. Flow cytometry assay based on latex beads for antigen detection\nAfter determining the saturation point of the IgY antibodies to the latex beads, perform the bead activation process again, according to step 2.1.1.\n\t\nCouple the beads at the observed saturation concentration (as described in step 2.1.3), and incubate according to step 2.1.2.\n\t\tNOTE: In the assays performed using the IgY-PfHRP2 antibody, the saturation condition was 2 µg for every 1 µL of latex beads.\nBlock and wash the beads according to step 2.2.\nIncubation with the antigen\n\t\nTo determine the limit of detection, distribute the equivalent of 100 µL of the blocked bead preparation into tubes containing different amounts of the recombinant protein PfHRP2 (1 µg/mL) (rPfHRP2, 10 µg, 1 µg, 0.1 µg, 0.01 µg, 0.001 µg, 0.0001 µg, and 0 µg) diluted in 10 mM PBS + 0.5% BSA in triplicate.\n\t\tNOTE: This recombinant protein was developed in the work of Sousa et al.9.\nIncubate the bead solutions with rPfHRP2 protein as described in step 2.1.2 for 1 h.\nPerform washings as described in step 2.1.4, and discard the supernatant after centrifugation.\nIncubation with the primary antibody\n\t\nAdd 2 µg of mouse IgG antibody against the rPfHRP2 protein diluted in 10 mM PBS + 0.5% BSA to a final volume of 100 µL in each sample. Incubate the samples as described in step 2.1.2, and discard the supernatant after the last centrifugation.\n\t\tNOTE: This antibody was developed in the work of Sousa et al.9.\nIncubation with the secondary antibody\n\t\nAdd 100 µL of fluorescent anti-mouse antibody (2 mg/mL) diluted to 1:2,000 in 10 mM PBS + 0.5% BSA to each sample. Incubate as described in step 2.1.2, and resuspend in 250 µL (0.016% final bead concentration) of filtered 10 mM PBS. Perform the reading according to section 5.",
    "4.

From the software workspace, select Cytometer | Startup | Clean mode | SIT fluids.\n\t\tNOTE: Air bubbles and obstructions should be removed during the cytometer initiation process prior to sample acquisition.\nQuality control\n\t\nUse the quality control reagent to check the voltages of the photomultiplier tubes and assess the cytometer's sensitivity.\nPlace the cytometer setup reagent and tracking beads in a 12 mm x 75 mm capped polystyrene tube.\nGently mix the tube by vortexing.\nPreparation of the suspension beads\n\t\nFor defining the baseline, add 0.5 mL of diluent (10 mM filtered PBS, pH 7) and three drops of beads to the 12 mm x 75 mm capped polystyrene tube. Vortex the tube gently before use.\nIn the cytometer software workspace, select Cytometer | CST, and wait for the cytometer to disconnect from the cytometer software interface and connect to the CS&T interface.

Sample analysis using flow cytometry\nLog in to cytometer software.\n\t\nFrom the cytometer software workspace, select Cytometer | Clean mode | SIT fluids.\nAdjust to the software workspace.\nDefine the gating strategy based on the negative control particles' morphometric and fluorescence characteristics (beads without fluorescence).\nTo determine the cell morphometry, choose Dot Plot Plot Graphic for the analysis of FSC-A parameters using SSC-A (Supplemental Figure 1A).\nDetermine single cells by SSC using Dot Plot Plot Graphic for the analysis of SSC-H in the y-axis and SSC-W in the x-axis (Supplemental Figure 1B), and determine single cells by FSC using Dot Plot Plot Graphic for the analysis of FSC-H in the y-axis and FSC-W in the x-axis (Supplemental Figure 1C).\nFor the fluorescence analyses, choose FL1 Dot Plot Plots using FCS-A. Use a 12 mm x 75 mm stoppered polystyrene tube containing unlabeled samples and samples previously labeled with single-color Alexa Fluor 488 (Supplemental Figure 1D, E).\nAcquire the sample in flow cytometry.",
