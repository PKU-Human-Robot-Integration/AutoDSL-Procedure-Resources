    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nSelection of Target Sequences in Wheat\nTiming: 2–5 days\nTo produce genome-edited multiple-recessive mutants in wheat, the target sequences must have a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for Cas9 nuclease and a restriction site for verifying the mutations. Moreover, the target sites must be present in all homoeologs, i.e. A, B, and D genomes of hexaploid wheat, for efficient cleavage and the absence of off-target sites. To select target sequences:\nAlign the three homoeologous sequences for the gene of interest. The gene information for wheat cv. Chinese Spring is available at the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (https://www.wheatgenome.org/Tools-and-Resources[href=https://www.wheatgenome.org/Tools-and-Resources]) website.\nIdentify 20-nucleotide target sequences within the gene of interest. When SpCas9 is employed, the target site of gRNA must be the 20-bp preceding a PAM (5′-NGG-3′) recognized by Cas9. The websites for gRNA design are useful, for example CRISPR-direct (http://crispr.dbcls.jp/[href=http://crispr.dbcls.jp/]) and WheatCrispr (https://crispr.bioinfo.nrc.ca/WheatCrispr/[href=https://crispr.bioinfo.nrc.ca/WheatCrispr/]).\nCheck the predicted secondary structures of the single-stranded RNA, including the target site and scaffold of the Cas9 nuclease, at the RNAstructure website (https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructureWeb/[href=https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructureWeb/]), the RNAfold web server (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi[href=http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi]), or the Quickfold web server (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/Quickfold[href=http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/Quickfold]).\nNote: According to Liang et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], three stem-loop structures, i.e. loops RAR, 2, and 3, are crucial for gRNA stability and activity. Therefore, a gRNA that can create such a structure should be chosen. We also confirmed the importance of the predicted secondary structure of designed gRNA in wheat (Kamiya et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nCheck for potential off-target sites at CRISPR-P 2.0 (http://crispr.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/CRISPR2/CRISPR[href=http://crispr.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/CRISPR2/CRISPR]). Reject gRNAs with potential off-target sites.\nConduct in vitro cleavage assays to exclude inferior sgRNAs, using the Guide-it Complete sgRNA Screening System. All steps should be performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nDesign primer sets for amplifying the fragments, including the target sites. Websites for primer design are useful, for example Primer3Web (https://primer3plus.com/primer3web/primer3web_input.htm[href=https://primer3plus.com/primer3web/primer3web_input.htm]).",
    "Note: The success of genome editing depends on the proper function of the designed gRNA. Although the nucleotide sequences that are conserved among homoeologs in cv. Chinese Spring are almost identical to those in cv. Fielder, the target sites of cv. Fielder should be sequenced to confirm this. The whole-genome shotgun data for the null-segregant, cv. Fielder (negative control), and the transgene-positive T1 plant #1-8 (positive control) have been deposited in the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under BioProject Accession PRJDB7455 (Abe et al. 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The sequence of Fielder can be generated by mapping whole-genome shotgun data of cv. Fielder (negative control) onto the reference target sequence (e.g. cv. Chinese Spring) to be edited. The candidate target site is better to have a restriction enzyme site that overlaps with the fourth nucleotide from the PAM; this makes it easier to detect mutations by PCR-RFLP using the restriction enzyme. If this site is not available, the PCR products, including the target sites of all homoeologs, should be sequenced to detect the mutations.\nVector Construction\nTiming: 2 weeks\nDetails of the construction method differ, depending on the vectors used to express Cas9 and the gRNA. We describe an example of the vector construction strategies used in Abe et al. 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nCloning a gRNA into the Vector pU6gRNA-oligo\nSynthesize forward and reverse oligo DNAs. These oligo DNAs contain the 20-bp designed sequence and must include overhangs specific for the BbsI-digested gRNA cloning vector. For example, for pU6gRNA-oligo and TaQsd1 target_1 (5′-ACGGATCCACCTCCCTGCAG-3′, Abe et al. 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), oligo DNAs are designed as below. 5′-gttgACGGATCCACCTCCCTGCAG-3′ 3′-TGCCTAGGTGGAGGGACGTCcaaa-5′\nDigest 1 μg of the gRNA cloning plasmid, pU6gRNA-oligo, using 1 μL of BbsI restriction enzyme and 2 μL of CutSmart buffer in a 20 μL final volume, and incubate at 37°C for 3 h.",

    "Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a straightforward approach to plant transformation that results in the insertion of only one or a few copies of the transgene. Producing the transgene-free genome-edited mutant is efficiently accomplished by crossing the resulting transformed plant with a wild-type plant and screening for progeny that contain the mutation but lack the transgene in the F2 generation.\nInfection of Immature Embryos with A. tumefaciens\nAdd 10 μL of A. tumefaciens glycerol stock (step 33) to 10 mL of MG/L medium (no antibiotics), and grow cells at 28°C with vigorous shaking for 20–24 h.\nCollect bacterial cells by centrifugation and resuspend to a cell density of 0.4 of A660 in WMS-inf medium.\nCollect immature seeds at the right developmental stage from panicles about 15 days after anthesis (DAA) (Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: The use of immature embryos at the correct developmental stage is a critical factor, and the size of the embryos is a very good indicator of the stage. Immature embryos that are 2.0–2.5 mm in length along the long axis are optimal for transformation. The time (DAA) required for embryos to reach the optimum stage differs, depending on the genotype and the season. Because wounding of immature embryos is detrimental for infection by A. tumefaciens and subsequent tissue culture, handle the immature embryos carefully up to the step for excising the embryo axis (step 50).\nRemove the glumes, lemma, and palea with forceps (Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSterilize immature seeds with 70% ethanol for 1 min and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for 15 min, and then wash three times with sterilized distilled water.",
    "Isolate immature embryos from the immature seeds under a stereoscopic microscope and transfer the embryos into 2.0 mL of WMS-liq medium in a 2.0-mL microcentrifuge tube (Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Taking into account subsequent handling of the embryos, it is recommended to place fewer than 100 embryos into one microcentrifuge tube.\nInvert the microcentrifuge tube several times and remove the medium.\nAdd 1.9 mL of WMS-liq medium.\nCentrifuge the microcentrifuge tube with a fixed-angle rotor with a maximum radius of 83 mm at 20,000×g at 4°C for 10 min.\nRemove the medium from the microcentrifuge tube and add 1.0 mL inoculum (step 35) (Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nInvert the microcentrifuge tube frequently for 30 s (Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nIncubate at 20–25°C for 5 min.\nTransfer the immature embryos to WMS-AS medium using a 60-mm petri dish. Although the inoculum will be absorbed by the culture medium, any excess inoculum should be removed with forceps (Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: About 50 embryos can be placed onto a single plate. We recommend starting with 10 embryos per plate and increasing the number up to 50 embryos depending on the level of skill. When the plate is left open for a long time to excise the embryo axis (step 50), the embryo will gradually dry out and die.\nGently turn over the immature embryos with the scutellum-side upwards.\nSeal the plate with Parafilm.\nIncubate the plate at 23°C in the dark for 2 days.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nVideo S1.

During the regeneration and rooting (steps 54 and 55), the plates are sealed with Parafilm. During the final step of rooting, we change the Parafilm to micropore surgical tape, and then culture for the final 3 to 5 days. The change from Parafilm to micropore surgical tape 3–5 days before transplanting helps the rooted plants acclimate to the new growth environment.\nTransplant rooted hygromycin-resistant plants to soil (Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
