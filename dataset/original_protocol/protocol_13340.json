    "The University Medical Center Utrecht Medical Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (METC 18/422), and the patient provided informed consent for the procedure and protocol.\n1. Patient screening\nPatient inclusion\n\t\nEnsure that the patient is >18 years old.\nEnsure that the patient is symptomatic for PAD and/or ISR.\nPatient exclusion\n\t\nExclude patients who cannot provide informed consent due to a language barrier or lack of comprehension.\n2. Vessel segmentation\nFor vessel segmentation, a preoperative acquired CTA has to be uploaded into the FORS software to create a roadmap for navigation by segmenting the aorta and both iliac arteries.\nSelect the contours of the aorta and common iliac artery in the segmentation software by moving the cursor over the arterial structures. The arteries will point out in a blue highlighted color and can be selected by clicking on them. Ensure only the arterial structures of interest are selected in this step.\nIn this case, select the abdominal aorta and both common iliac arteries in combination with the left external iliac artery.\nAfter selection of the arteries of interest, visually inspect the segmented structures by rotating the segmented vessels.\n3. Surgical preparation\nPlace the patient in a supine position on the operating table, with both arms along the sides of the patient.\nPosition the docking station at the operating table, at the left side of the patient, at the level of the upper legs.\nDisinfect the surgical field from the abdomen to the upper legs with chlorhexidine and expose the area of interest with sterile sheaths.\n4. Ultrasound-guided puncture of the left common femoral artery\nCreate an ultrasound-guided Seldinger arterial access to the common femoral artery.\nIntroduce a 0.035 standard guidewire within the lumen of the artery.\nIntroduce a 6 Fr sheath over the guidewire.\n5. Volume registration",
    "To align the created roadmap according to the real-time patient position, perform volume registration. In this case, a so-called 2D-3D volume registration is performed to align the preoperative and intraoperative positions of the patient.\nTo do this, acquire two intraoperative fluoroscopic images focusing on the field of interest, which in this case is the field of the previously implanted endograft and iliac limb.\n\tNOTE: The C-arm needs to be positioned in two different orientations to acquire fluoroscopic images with an angle difference of 90°. For this case, this results in one image captured with a 45° left anterior oblique angle and one with a 45° right anterior oblique angle. Capture and copy the images to the software.\nUse the visible pre-existent stent graft in both the acquired fluoroscopic images to align the segmented vessel volume with real-time fluoroscopic imaging.\nFirst, translate the segmented vessel volume onto the contours of the stent graft in the fluoroscopic images. Determine the correct windowing so the high Hounsfield values of the preoperative CTA are included to visualize the stent graft only. This can be performed by clicking on the windowing icon on the top.\nAfter translating the volume to the correct location in the fluoroscopic images, translate the center of rotation onto the center of the stent graft to enable rotation of the stent graft around its center. Rotate the stent graft in the segmented vessel volume to align the preoperative and intraoperative positions of the stent graft.\nTo confirm alignment of the segmented vessel volume with real-time fluoroscopic imaging, adjust the windowing of the volume to orientate and compare anatomical structures, such as bony structures. Now, volume registration is successfully completed.\n6. FORS shape registration\nNOTE: The FORS devices are registered inside the operation theatre to enable their usage without fluoroscopy.",
    "Position the FORS devices in the intervention area.\nAcquire two fluoroscopic images with a difference in angle position of at least 30° (e.g., one in the anterior posterior position and one with a 30° right or left anterior oblique angle).\nSelect the requested capturing angles in the software and rotate the C-arm toward the required position.\nAfter capturing a fluoroscopic image, copy the image by clicking on the symbol or icon presenting two documents.\nAnalyze the projected guidewire (in yellow) and the projected catheter (in blue) over the contours on the fluoroscopic images.\n\t​NOTE: The FORS technology can now be used autonomously.\n7. Endovascular navigation\nIntroduce the FORS guidewire through the 6 Fr sheath.\nUse the FORS devices to navigate through the target vessel (left iliac artery and endograft) and pass the stenotic lesion up to the abdominal aorta. Use the registered CTA segmentation as a roadmap during navigation. The black background indicates that no fluoroscopic images are captured while passing the lesion. So, the only orientation of the device position is provided by the registered segmented vessel volume.\nEnsure the iliac stenosis creates a resistance to the guidewire, which induces a pressure on the guidewire resulting in a dotted visualization.\nDo not use fluoroscopy during navigation.\nExchange the FORS guidewire to a 0.014 workhorse guidewire. Because this workhorse guidewire is not supported by the FORS system; fluoroscopy must be used to obtain the wire's position.\nPull out the FORS catheter.\n8. Pre-PTA IVUS diameter measurements\nUsing a stand-alone IVUS system, introduce the IVUS catheter over the 0.014 workhorse guidewire toward the aortic bifurcation.\nVisualize the intraluminal diameters from the aortic bifurcation toward the common iliac artery distal of the stenotic lesion by pulling back the IVUS catheter.",
    "Quantify the lumen diameter and cross-sectional area at the level of the lesion and the non-stenotic area of the iliac limb.\nExchange the 0.014 workhorse guidewire for a 0.035 standard guidewire by using fluoroscopy.\n9. Transluminal percutaneous angiography (PTA) treatment\nUse X-ray to introduce the 8 mm x 40 mm PTA balloon over the standard guidewire, and position the balloon at the stenotic lesion. Perform fluoroscopy-guided balloon inflation for 2 min.\nPull back the PTA balloon.\nReinflate the PTA balloon to treat the culprit lesion for a second time. The inflation process is visible by contrast enhancement of the balloon.\nRemove the PTA balloon and introduce the FORS catheter. Subsequently, replace the 0.035 guidewire with the 0.014 workhorse guidewire.\n10. Post-PTA IVUS diameter measurements\nUsing a stand-alone IVUS system, introduce the IVUS catheter over the 0.014 workhorse guidewire.\nImage the intraluminal diameters from the aortic bifurcation toward the common iliac artery distal of the stenotic lesion by pulling back the IVUS catheter from the aortic bifurcation toward the common iliac artery.\nQuantify the lumen diameter and cross-sectional area at the level of the stenotic lesion and remove the IVUS catheter.\n11. Pressure measurements\nIntroduce the FORS catheter over the 0.014 workhorse guidewire through the target vessel proximal to the treated stenotic lesion and pull back the standard guidewire.\nPosition the FORS catheter proximal to the stenotic lesion and connect the back of the FORS catheter to a pressure transducer. Level and zero the pressure transducer to ensure the blood pressure measurements are accurate. Measure the blood pressure.\nPull back the FORS catheter and measure the blood pressure distally to the treated stenotic lesion.\nPull out the FORS catheter, standard guidewire, and sheath, and close with a percutaneous closure device.\nSubscription Required.
