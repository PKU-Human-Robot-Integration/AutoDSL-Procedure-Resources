    "The use of mice for cell isolation purpose was in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and with the Swiss Animal Protection Law and was approved by the Swiss Cantonal Authorities.\nNOTE: The isolation of Sca-1+/CD31- SP-CPCs from the mouse heart was essentially done as previously described34 with some modifications. For the materials and reagents used, see Table of Materials. For all experiments, cardiac SP-CPCs isolated from mice were amplified, passaged, and used in a cell line-like manner. Passages 7 - 20 were used for this study.\n1. Tissue Preparation\nNOTE: All experiments using mice must be carried out according to the guidelines and regulations. This protocol uses four mice. Culture plates that are 100 mm in diameter are described as P100 and culture plates that are 60 mm in diameter are described as P60 for the following parts of the protocol.\nInject each mouse with 200 mg/kg of pentobarbital intraperitoneally (i.p.) and wait until it is fully anesthetized by checking its response to toe pinching.\nWipe the chest with 70% ethanol. Cut the skin and thoracic wall with scissors to expose the thoracic cavity.\nLift the heart with forceps and cut it at the base using scissors. Put the heart in a P100 with 25 mL (5 mL for P60) of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (three to five hearts per P100 or one to two hearts per P60).\nPump the heart with forceps to eject the blood out of the cavities (Figure 1A).\nPut the heart in a P100 with 25 mL (5 mL for P60) of cold PBS for washing. Remove the atria using small scissors. Cut the heart into two longitudinal pieces and wash them again in ice-cold PBS (25 mL/P100, 5 mL/P60).",
    "Transfer the pieces to a new P100 with 25 mL (5 mL for P60) of cold PBS. Cut the pieces into smaller pieces using small scissors (Figure 1B). Add a drop of 1 mg/mL collagenase B diluted in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) and mince the small pieces thoroughly with a sterile razor blade (Figure 1C).\n2. Digestion\nAdd 10 mL (2.5 mL for P60) of the 1 mg/mL collagenase B solution to the dish from step 1.6.\nPut the collagenase B solution containing the minced heart pieces in a tilted (about 30°) P100 (or P60) in a 37 °C incubator (Figure 1D).\nIncubate the minced heart pieces for a maximum of 30 min; homogenize by repeatedly passing them through a Pasteur pipette every 10 min during the incubation (Figure 1E).\n\tNOTE: It is important to not exceed 30 min of incubation in total for step 1.3.\n3. Filtration\nAdd 10 mL (5 mL for P60) of cold HBSS supplemented with 2% FBS to the minced and homogenized heart pieces.\n\tNOTE: HBSS supplemented with 2% FBS quenches collagenase B activity.\nFilter the heart pieces through 100 µm filter to remove undigested tissue and centrifuge at 470 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT) (Figure 1F, yellow filters).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL (3 mL for P60) of red blood cell lysis buffer, and incubate the pellet for 5 min with occasional shaking on ice.\nAdd 10 mL (5 mL for P60) of PBS (to stop the lysis reaction) and filter the sample through a 40 µm filter to exclude larger cells, including residual cardiomyocytes (Figure 1F, blue filters).",
    "Centrifuge the tube at 470 x g for 5 min at RT (without brake). Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of DMEM including 10% FBS.\nCount the cells in an aliquot with a hemocytometer. Resuspend the cells with DMEM including 10% FBS, aiming at a final cell concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: Roughly 5 x 106 cardiomyocyte- and erythrocyte-depleted cells can be estimated per mouse.\nDistribute the cells into two tubes (Figure 2): in tube A, add 1.5 mL for Hoechst 33342 staining with verapamil; in tube B, add 18.5 mL for Hoechst 33342 staining and proceed to stain and sort (steps 4.1 and 4.2) cardiac SP cells by flow cytometry.\n4. Sorting of Cardiac SP Cells by Flow Cytometry\nNOTE: Verapamil inhibits Hoechst efflux by blocking multidrug resistance (MDR) ABC transporter activity. Hoechst 33342 is a DNA-binding dye that can be used in living cells to detect the cell cycle as it correlates with the DNA content. Hoechst-33342-extruding cells appear in the Hoechst low part of both emission channels (450 nm, Hoechst blue; 650 nm, Hoechst red), that is, aside of the Hoechst-retaining “main population”, giving them their name “side population”. SP cells are enriched in cells with progenitor properties and show a high expression of multidrug-resistant ABC transporters (such as MDR1 and ABCG2). Hoechst 33342 is written as Hoechst for the following parts of the protocol. It is important to protect light-sensitive materials for ideal results.\nStaining with Hoechst in the presence and absence of verapamil",
    "Add verapamil (with a final concentration of 83.3 µM) and Hoechst (with a final concentration of 5 µg/106 cells) to the cell solution. For tube A, use Verapamil and Hoechst; for tube B, use Hoechst only. Incubate in a water bath (at 37 °C) for 90 min and revert the tubes every 20 min (Figure 1G).\nCentrifuge the tubes at 470 x g for 5 min at RT. Discard the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in HBSS (1 x 106 cells/mL).\nTake a 1.5 mL aliquot for single stainings and negative control from tube B (Figure 2): (i) fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-Sca-1; (ii) allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD31; (iii) nonstained cells (negative control).\n\t\tNOTE: Isotype controls are used here for setting up the isolation protocol.\nCentrifuge tubes A and B and the single-staining and negative control aliquots at 470 x g for 5 min at RT for washing out Hoechst and verapamil.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets of tube A and (iii) the negative control in 250 µL of HBSS and keep them on ice in the dark until sorting.\nResuspend the pellet of tube B in 200 µL of HBSS and the pellet of (i, ii) the single-staining aliquots in 100 µL of HBSS. Add FITC-conjugated anti-Sca-1 (0.6 µg/107 cells) and APC-conjugated anti-CD31 (0.25 µg/107 cells). Incubate the pellets for 30 min on ice and shake them from time to time in the dark.\nAdd 2 mL of HBSS to the tubes. Centrifuge the tubes at 470 x g for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend all pellets with 1 mL of HBSS and centrifuge as above. Discard the supernatants. Resuspend the pellet of the single-staining aliquots in 200 µL of HBSS. Resuspend the pellet of tube B in HBSS (20 x 106 cells/mL).",
    "Keep the samples on ice and protected from light until sorting.\nSorting with flow cytometry\nPrepare sterile 1.5 mL sorting tubes with 500 µL of HBSS including 2% FBS.\nStain the cells with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (0.15 µg/106 cells) on ice for 10 min to exclude dead cells.\nSort the cardiac SP using the following settings: excite Hoechst using 350 nm (UV) excitation, collect fluorescence emission with a 450/50 nm band-pass filter (Hoechst Blue) and a 670/30 nm band-pass filter (Hoechst red), and use a nozzle size of 100 µm and pressure of 15 psi.\nFor analysis, record 5 x 105 events for the sorting samples and 1 x 105 events for the negative control, verapamil control, and single-staining samples.\n\t\tNOTE: The cardiac SP is around 0.5% - 2% (Figure 1H) but may vary between laboratories and isolates. The Sca-1+/CD31- fraction is around 1% - 11% of the total cardiac SP (Figure 1I) but may vary between laboratories and isolates. Sca-1+/CD31- SP-CPCs are written as SP-CPCs for the following parts of the protocol.\n5. Primary Culture of Isolated SP-CPCs\nNOTE: Three different types of media were used in this protocol. They are referred to as Medium 1 (according to Noseda et al.)8, Medium 2, and Medium 3 and are described in the Table of Materials regarding their composition.\nWarm up Medium 1 to 37 °C before use and cool down the centrifuge to 4 °C. Centrifuge the sorting tubes at 4 °C and 470 x g for 6 min and resuspend the cells in Medium 1.\nPut the cells on a gas-permeable P60 dish with 4 mL of Medium 1. Change the medium every 3 d until the cells have reached 70% - 80% confluence.\n\tNOTE: Step 5.2 may take around 2 - 3 weeks.",
    "6. Expansion and Differentiation of SP-CPCs\nCell culture\nCulture 3 x 105 SP-CPCs in 8 mL of Medium 1 in a T75 flask.\nIncubate SP-CPCs at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until 70% - 80% confluence, changing the medium every 2 - 3 d.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell number should be modified according to the type of CPCs used, the doubling time, and the cell size.\nSP-CPC growth and viability under different serum concentrations\nCulture SP-CPCs for 2 - 3 d in T75 flasks with 8 mL of Medium 1. Carefully aspirate the medium and rinse gently with 5 mL of warm (37 °C) HBSS.\nTreat the cells with 5 mL of Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min in the cell incubator, add 5 mL of Medium 1 to stop the Trypsin activity, and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 470 x g for 5 min at RT.\nResuspend the cells in Medium 1 or Medium 2 (lineage induction medium) and plate 2.5 x 105 SP-CPCs on P60 dishes with 3 mL of medium containing different serum concentrations.\nCollect the medium from the dish of step 6.2.4 for the collection of dead cells into a 15 mL tube after 2 d of culturing in Medium 1 or Medium 2.\nTrypsinize adherent cells as in step 6.2.2 and collect the cell suspension into the 15 mL tube of step 6.2.5. Centrifuge the cells at 840 x g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL of Medium 1 or Medium 2 for cell counting. Stain SP-CPCs with trypan blue (0.4%) and count trypan blue-positive (dead) and trypan blue-negative (viable) cells.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell viability (step 6.2.7) is given as the trypan-blue negative cell number in relation to the total cell number.",
    "Induction of endothelial differentiation \nPrecoat a (6-well) culture plate with 10 µg/mL of laminin (LN) or fibronectin (FN).\n\t\t\nMake a substrate solution containing 10 µg/mL of LN or FN with F12 medium (or PBS). Add 2 mL of substrate solution to each well. Maintain the plate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nAspirate the solution from the plate and add 2 mL of PBS to each well until using it.\nAspirate the medium from the cells from step 6.1.2, rinse them gently with 5 mL of warm (37 °C) HBSS, treat them with 5 mL of Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min in the cell incubator, add 5 mL of Medium 1 to stop the Trypsin activity, and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 470 x g for 5 min at RT. Aspirate the supernatant and add Medium 2 for cell counting.\nSeed 8 x 104 cells per well on the coated plate with 3 mL of Medium 2 and keep it at 37 °C for 20 - 24 h. Change the medium to 3 mL of Medium 3.\n\t\tNOTE: We recommend using medium containing a low serum concentration—and without supplements—for the first 20 - 24 h. We recommended using <60% cell confluence (i.e., the cell number of step 6.3.4 has to be adjusted depending on the cell size and growth rate).\nCulture the cells for 21 d and change the medium every 3 d.\nVerify the endothelial nature of differentiated cells by staining them with an endothelial marker such as von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and performing fluorescence microscopy.\n\t\t\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS and fix the cells in 3.7% formaldehyde for 2 min at RT.",
    "Permeabilize the cells with 0.1% Triton X in ddH2O (or PBS) for 30 min and block it with 10% goat serum for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the cells with anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (1:100) for 48 h at 4 °C\nWash the cells 3x with 1 mL of PBS, for 10 min each time. Incubate them with Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500) for 1 h at RT in the dark.\nWash again 3x, for 10 min each, with 1 mL of PBS. Stain the cell nuclei with 4’6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI; 1:500) for 5 min at RT in the dark.\nWash the cells 3x, for 5 min each, with 1 mL of PBS. Mount the cells and store them at 4 °C\n\t\t\tNOTE: The culturing conditions (substrate, medium, supplemental reagents, and FBS concentration) of steps 6.1 and 6.3 are described in Figure 3.\nTube formation assay\nPrepare a basement membrane matrix (e.g., Matrigel, henceforth referred to as matrix) plate.\n\t\t\nThaw the matrix at 4 °C overnight.\nCoat a 96-well plate with 100 µL of the matrix on ice.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is important to avoid any bubbles in the matrix. The plates have to be coated on ice to avoid the jellification of the matrix.\nMaintain the plate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nAspirate the medium from the cells (after the completion of step 6.3.5), gently rinse the cells with 5 mL of warm (37 °C) HBSS, and treat them with Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min in the cell incubator. Add Medium 3 to stop the Trypsin activity and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 470 x g for 5 min at RT. Aspirate the supernatant, add 1 mL of Medium 3, and pipet gently.",
    "Filter the cells with a 35 µm cell strainer, if the cells are aggregated.\nCount the cells and seed 2 x 103 to 4 x 103 cells in 100 µL of Medium 3 in each matrix-coated well. Keep the plate at 37 °C in the cell incubator for 16 h.\nTake a picture with a bright-field microscope at 2X magnification.\n\t\tNOTE: In the case of an incomplete trypsinization, prolong the exposure time to Trypsin-EDTA to a maximum of 7 - 8 min.\nSubscription Required.
