    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nHuman Tumor Tissue Processing\nTiming: 3–24 h\nThe following steps are critical to obtain a homogeneous cell suspension to minimize variability for downstream experiments and high-throughput drug screenings in particular.\nTransfer the tumor sample to a sterile petri dish in a biological hood\nAdd 5 mL of Collagenase Working Solution to keep the tissue moist and use a sterile single-use bistoury to process into 1–3 mm3 fragments\nCollect the fragments in a 50 mL Falcon tube using the bistoury and wash the dish with an additional 5 mL of Collagenase Working Solution to ensure that all fragments are collected\nIncubate the tissue in Collagenase Working Solution at 37°C in the cell incubator for 2 h, vortexing every ∼10 min to facilitate tissue digestion\nNote: For larger specimens, 10 mL of Working Solution may not be sufficient. In that case, increase the volume accordingly.\nNote: After approximately 2 h, you should notice that the solution became increasingly turbid. Larger tissue fragments may still be present and will require iterative digestion and collection steps.\nPlace the Falcon tube in the biological hood and wait 2–3 min for the larger undigested fragments to deposit on the bottom of the tube\nGently remove the supernatant containing the cell suspension and place it in a new 50 mL Falcon tube\nSpin the cell suspension at 400–600 × g for 5 min, immediately followed by red blood cells lysis (#9–18)\nResuspend the remaining tissue fragments in 10 mL of Collagenase Working Solution and place back in the incubator for further digestion\nNote: Spinning speed may vary depending on tissue type. If unsure, start at the slowest recommended speed (400 × g) and spin a second time at higher speed if the supernatant is still turbid.",
    "Note: Repeat steps 4–8 until the tissue is completely dissolved. We have observed variability in incubation times not only for different types of tissue but also for individual tumors within the same tumor type. We recommend visual inspection of the sample to verify tissue digestion. Digestions of >24 h can result in reduced cell viability.\nRed Blood Cell Lysis\nTiming: 20 min\nMost tumor cell pellets will appear red due to the presence of contaminating red blood cells. While the amount of blood cells can vary significantly from sample to sample, we recommend performing a minimum of one lysis for all samples. For some specimens, excessive red blood cell contaminations will require multiple iterations of the lysis protocol or a larger amount of lysis buffer. Adjust the protocol accordingly.\nAt the end of the spin, gently aspirate the supernatant without disrupting the cell pellet\nGently resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of cold, sterile and serum-free RPMI medium\nAdd 9 mL of cold Ammonium Chloride solution drop-by-drop and invert the tube to mix\nIncubate on ice for 10 min, inverting the tube every 2–3 min\nSpin at 600 × g for 5 min\nGently aspirate all supernatant\nNote: If the pellet appears red, repeat steps 9–14.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL cold, sterile and serum-free RPMI medium, pipetting up and down several times to obtain a homogenous cell suspension\nPlace a 100 μm strainer on a new 50 mL Falcon and pipette the cell suspension through the strainer\nWash the tube with an additional 2–9 mL of cold, sterile and serum-free RPMI medium and pass through the strainer to obtain a final cell suspension of 2–10 mL\nLeave the tube on ice",
    "Note: The volume of RPMI depends on the size of the cell pellet and method used to count the cells. Cells can be diluted by adding more medium or concentrated by spinning and resuspending in a smaller volume if needed\nNote: From step 18 onward, leave the cells on ice unless stated otherwise\nNote: Cells from sequential digestions can be pooled at this step. Store the cells on ice while waiting for further digestions.\nViable Cell Counting\nTiming: 5 min\nHere, we determine the number of viable cells/mL prior to seeding. If multiple cell harvesting steps are performed, pool all cells and count at that point.\nInvert the Falcon containing the cell suspension in RPMI multiple times\nRemove a 25 μL aliquot and place in an Eppendorf tube\nAdd 25 μL of AO/PI Staining Solution\nMix by pipetting up and down 8–10 times paying attention not to introduce bubbles\nAdd 20 μL to each of the two counting chambers in a Cellometer Disposable Imaging slide\nImage and count both chambers with a Cellometer Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter using the “AO/PI Primary Cell/Cell lines” program to distinguish debris from nucleated, viable cells\nAverage the counts to obtain the number of viable cells/mL\nNote: Cell counting can be performed in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach chosen, we recommend selecting a method that allows to use a small volume of cells and can discriminate debris from viable nucleated cells.\nPause Point: Cells can be frozen at this step, if desired. We recommend freezing cells in Cryostor®CS10 or RecoveryTM Cell Culture Freezing Medium following manufacturer's instructions.\nSeeding Mini-Rings for High-Throughput Screenings and Drug Discovery Studies\nTiming: 1–4 h",
    "We establish mini-rings of Matrigel and tumor cells in 96-well plates for screening. For typical primary samples, we use 5,000 cells/well (range: 5,000–10,000). The same procedure can be used with cell lines as well. For cell lines, we recommend seeding 1,000–5,000 cells/well. Refer to Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for a visual example.\nCritical: All steps from this point are performed on ice. We recommend placing a small, sterile ice container in the biosafety cabinet (i.e. a 250 mL beaker).\nFirstly, determine how many wells you wish to generate. For each well, you need 10 μL of cells in Matrigel at a ratio of 1:1.33 (cell suspension to Matrigel). For example, if you want to generate 100 rings, you will need 500,000 cells to be resuspended in 430 μL of cold complete Mammocult medium and 570 μL of Matrigel (see below) for a total volume of 1 mL (10 μL/well).\nNote: Always calculate in excess so as to generate about 30% more rings than the number you desire to plate. For example, if you want to generate 100 rings, prepare enough cell suspension in Matrigel to obtain 130.\nPrepare an aliquot of cells according to the calculation above\nSpin at 600 × g for 5 min\nGently aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet\nAdd the calculated volume of cold Mammocult and thoroughly resuspend the cells by pipetting\nAdd the calculated volume of Matrigel to the cells directly on ice and pipette multiple times to ensure homogenous mixing\nVortex 3 times for 5 s at low rpm, placing the tube back on ice after each vortexing step\nKeep the mixture in a small beaker containing ice inside the biosafety cabinet and immediately proceed plating the mini-rings",
    "Using a P20 pipette with a low attachment 20 μL tip, pipette up and down a few times and aspirate 10 μL of the cell solution\nKeeping the tip at a 45 degree angle, place at the bottom of a 96-well plate and eject the mixture slowly while moving the tip in a circular motion around the rim. It should take ∼2 s to complete one ring.\nNote: Mini-rings can be generated in any 96-well plate and do not require any specialized or functionalized support (Phan et al, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Choose the 96-well plate on the basis of the assay that you wish to perform. For ATP release luminescence assay (see below), use white plates. Fluorescent-based assays or specific imaging approaches may be require black plates or glass-bottom plates.\nCritical: Always stop pipetting at the first resistance of the pipet dispenser. When finishing each well, pull the tip straight out without touching the surface of the well. To ensure optimal results: i) Change tips every ∼8 wells, ii) briefly vortex the cell mixture every 8 wells; iii) plate rings in random order to minimize inhomogeneities and plate variability.\nOnce all rings are plated, quickly move the plate to a humidified 37°C incubator at 5% CO2 and incubate for a minimum of 30 min\nWhile the rings are solidifying, prepare a Masterblock media plate. Each well will need to be fed with 100 μL pre-warmed Mammocult. Thus, prepare a Masterblock by adding Mammocult to each well using a multi-well pipette or a microplate dispenser\nNote: Add a 20% excess to ensure equal volume will be added to each well. For instance, if you have a single 96 mini-ring well plate, add 120 μL of Mammocult to each well.",
    "Note: If mini-rings are only present in a subset of wells, add pre-warmed PBS to all empty wells.\nCover the Masterblock media plate and leave in the incubator for a minimum of 30 min\nOnce the mini-rings are solidified, add 100 μL of Mammocult from the Masterblock media plate to the center of each well\nIncubate in a humidified 37°C incubator at 5% CO2 for 3 days prior to media exchange or drug treatment (see below)\nNote: To minimize uneven evaporation, add warm PBS in the space between wells.\nNote: We use a 3 day incubation followed by two sequential drug treatments as described in Phan et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. However, duration of each step can be adjusted depending on tissue type, experiment type, etc.\nNote: We strongly recommend using a 96-well automatic pipettor such as an Eppendorf EpMotion or an automated Beckman Biomek to add media as well as for all subsequent steps. If using an EpMotion, set the media dispensing speed to “1” to avoid disrupting the rings. Refer to Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for an example.\nNote: We recommend imaging each plate daily to visualize organoid establishment and growth. We use a Celigo S Image Cytometer in brightfield mode that allows for even illumination of the wells.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nVideo S1. A Visual Guide to Mini-Ring Preparation (Steps 27–40)\nHigh-Throughput Drug Screening\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nHere, we present two alternatives for high-throughput screening. Steps 41–47 describe the procedure we follow using an EpMotion or equivalent liquid handler. Steps 48–52 include the procedure for using an automated liquid handler such as a Beckman Coulter Biomek.",
    "After 3 days, proceed with drug treatment or medium exchange if you wish to maintain the organoids for longer times. In both cases, proceed to fully remove the medium and replace it as indicated below.\nAt least 30 min prior to media exchange, prepare a Masterblock plate containing either fresh pre-warmed Mammocult or drugs of choice and incubate at 37°C\nPrepare a set of tips (300 μL, filtered) for each plate requiring a media exchange\nRetrieve the mini-ring plate and aspirate all medium by placing the tips at the bottom of the wells, in the empty center. Parameters: up “2”, volume “200 μL”\nDispense the aspirated medium in a “waste plate”\nRepeat 43–44 until no medium is left in any of the wells and mini-rings are visible by visual inspection of the plate\nAspirate 100 μL from the new Masterblock plate and dispense at the center of the mini-rings. Recommended parameters: up “2”, down “1”, volume “100 μL”\nImmediately place the mini-ring plate back in the incubator\nNote: Repeat all steps 24 h after the first treatment for drug studies. For media exchange, replace media every 2–3 days.\nCritical: Always minimize the time that the Matrigel-containing plate spends outside the incubator. Therefore prepare all necessary reagents and supplies ahead of time.\nNote: When performing high-throughput drug treatments, we recommend scattering negative control wells (vehicle) across the plate. Positive controls (in our case, Staurosporine at 1 μM and 10 μM) are placed in the corner wells.\nAlternatives: If using an automated liquid hander such as a Beckman Coulter Biomek instrument, follow steps 48–52. The steps below are an alternative to steps 41–47.\nFor this type of automated liquid handler, we prepare compound library plates containing the desired drug stocks at 100x concentration in DMSO.",
    "At least 30 min prior to media exchange, prepare a dilution Masterblock plate containing Mammocult (120 μL/well) and incubate at 37°C\nUsing filtered Beckman Coulter Biomek p50 tips, program the robot to first transfer 1.2 μL of drug at 100x concentration in DMSO from the library compound plate to the dilution Masterblock plate and thoroughly mix\nThe robot then removes 100 μL of media from the mini-ring plate in two steps and disposes of it in a “waste plate”\nLastly, program the robot to add 100 μL from the dilution Masterblock plate directly to the mini-ring plate in two steps\nImmediately place the mini-ring plate back in the incubator\nNote: Repeat all steps 24 h after the first treatment for drug studies. For media exchange, replace media every 2–3 days.\nCritical: Minimize the time that the Matrigel-containing plate spends outside the incubator. Prepare all necessary reagents and supplies ahead of time.\nNote: When performing high-throughput drug treatments, we recommend to scatter negative control wells (vehicle) and positive controls (in our case, Staurosporine at 1 μM and 10 μM) across the plate.\nATP-Release Assay\nTiming: 2–4 h\nSeveral different assays can be performed to evaluate organoid growth and drug treatment effect (Phan et al, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Here, we focus on the assay we employ more frequently, the ATP-release assay.",
    "Note: Dispase will be added to each well of the mini-ring plate to help release the organoids from Matrigel prior to performing any assay. Before starting, calculate how much powder is needed taking into account that, while 50 μL/well of a 5 mg/mL solution are ultimately added to each mini-ring, a 50%–70% excess is needed to account for both the volume lost at the filtration step and the extra volume added to the dispase Masterblock plate. Once dissolved, keep the dispase tube or plate on ice at all times and use within 30 min. The enzyme can very rapidly precipitate.\nNote: For this assay, you will need to prepare a pre-warmed PBS Masterblock plate, a cold dispase Masterblock plate, 2 sets of 300 μL epTIPS and one set of 50 μL epTIPS.\nPrepare a Masterblock plate by adding PBS (120 μL) to each well and warm up at 37°C for a minimum of 30 min before starting\nPrepare a fresh dispase solution immediately prior to the assay by dissolving dispase powder in cold, serum-free RPMI to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL\nInvert the tube or gently vortex to dissolve the powder without forming bubbles\nOnce the powder is dissolved, filter using a 50 mL Millipore Steriflip\nUsing a multi-well pipette or a microplate dispenser, add 75 μL to each well of a Masterblock plate\nCover the plate and store on ice as you proceed to retrieve the mini-ring plate and PBS Masterblock plate from the incubator\nUsing one set of 300 μL epTIPS, remove all media from the mini-ring plate by placing the tips at the bottom of the wells, in the empty center. Parameters: up “2”, down “5”, volume “200 μL”\nDispense the aspirated medium in a “waste plate”",
    "Repeat 59–60 until no medium is left in any of the wells and mini-rings are visible by visual inspection of the plate\nUsing a second set of 300 μL epTIPS, aspirate 100 μL from the PBS Masterblock plate and add it to the mini-ring plate to wash. Parameters are as follows: up “2”, down “1”, volume “100 μL”\nUsing the same tips, aspirate all PBS following the steps in 59–61\nLastly, using a set of 50 μL epTIPS, remove 50 μL of dispase from the dispase Masterblock plate and add it to the empty mini-ring plate. Parameters are as follows: up “2”, down “1”, volume “50 μL”\nIncubate at 37°C for 25 min\nAfter the incubation, shake for 5 min at 80 rpm using a plate shaker\nUsing a microscope, confirm that the organoids are now in solution and released from the rings. If not, incubate for an additional 5 min, followed by shaking for 5 min as in #66\nAdd 75 μL of CellTiter-Glo 3D Reagent to each well using a multi-well pipette and without generating any air bubbles\nCover the plate with a MicroAmp Optical Adhesive film\nShake for 5 min at 80rpm using a plate shaker in the dark\nIncubate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark\nMeasure luminescence using a SpectraMax iD3. Parameters: shake for 5 min prior to reading, read all wavelengths, 500 ms integration time.\nNote: While we report instructions on how to perform this protocol using an EpMotion instrument, the same process can be programmed on a Biomek or similar liquid handler.\nSeeding Maxi-Rings for Histologic Characterization or Biochemical Analysis\nTiming: 1–4 h",
    "We establish maxi-rings of Matrigel and tumor cells in 24 well plates for histologic characterization or downstream biochemical analysis. The procedure is similar to the mini-ring protocol, with minor modifications such as cells/well (100,000 vs 5,000 for mini-rings). For a visual guide, refer to Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] (generating and feeding maxi-rings).\nCritical: All steps from this point are performed on ice. We recommend placing a small, sterile ice container in the biosafety cabinet (i.e. a 250 mL beaker).\nFirstly, determine how many wells you wish to generate and how much Mammocult and Matrigel is required. For each well, you need 70 μL of cells in Matrigel at a ratio of 1:1.33 (cell suspension to Matrigel). For example, if you want to generate 10 rings, you will need 1,000,000 cells to be resuspended in 300 μL of cold Mammocult medium and 400 μL of Matrigel (see below) for a total volume of 0.7 mL or 70 μL/well).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nVideo S2.

    "Using a P200 pipette with a low attachment 300 μL tip, pipette up and down a few times and aspirate 70 μL of the cell solution\nKeeping the tip at a 45 degree angle, place at the bottom of a single well in a 24 well plate and eject the mixture slowly while moving the tip in a circular motion around the rim\nCritical: Vortex shortly every 3 wells, together with tip change. Always stop pipetting at the first resistance of the pipet dispenser to avoid introducing air bubbles.\nOnce all rings are plated, quickly move the plate to a humidified 37°C incubator at 5% CO2 and incubate for a minimum of 45 min\nWhile the rings are solidifying, prepare a Falcon tube containing 1 mL of Mammocult for each of the maxi-rings seeded and incubate at 37°C for a minimum of 30 min\nAfter the rings are visibly solidified, add 1 mL of the pre-warmed Mammocult drop-by-drop directly to the center of the wells using a P1000\nIncubate the plate in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2, imaging every day using a Celigo S Image Cytometer\nNote: Make sure to add the media to the center of the well and not to the side as when working with 2D cells or Matrigel drops in order to avoid disrupting the maxi-rings.\nMedia Exchange for Maxi-Rings\nOrganoids in maxi-rings should be fed after 3 days, and subsequently every 1–3 days for maintenance. For a visual guide, refer to Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] (generating and feeding maxi-rings).\nMake an aliquot of Mammocult (1 mL for each well) and put in the incubator at least 30 min to pre-warm\nAspirate all the medium from the center of the well, paying attention not to aspirate or touch the ring",
    "Add 1 mL of the pre-warmed Mammocult drop-by-drop directly to the center of the wells using a P1000\nIncubate the plate in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2\nNote: To apply a treatment, follow the same protocol and replace Mammocult with Mammocult + drug of choice\nSample Preparation for Histologic Analysis\nHere, we focus on generating samples for histopathology.
