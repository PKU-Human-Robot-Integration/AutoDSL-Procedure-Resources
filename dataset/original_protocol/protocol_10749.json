    "This study protocol was approved by the Yamaguchi University Review Committee for Non-Medical Research Involving Human Participants. See Table of Materials for a list of all materials, equipment, and software used in this protocol. Public announcements were made regarding the date, time, and location that children, along with their parent(s) or guardian(s), could gather to voluntarily collaborate to create, use, and then clean up a playpark in an environment designed to encourage their creativity.\n1. Park landscapes and resources\nConduct on-site surveys of the topography and resources of each park and specifically design the waterslides for each park to utilize the specific resources available. If possible, place the waterslides in an open area so they are visible from all directions to attract visitors to the playground.\n\tNOTE: Figure 1 shows the Google Maps aerial view of each park, indicating the location and direction of the waterslide (WS).\nDesign and build waterslides based on the existing terrain.\n\tNOTE: The slope and length of each waterslide is shown in Table 1.\n\t\nTo make a waterslide for a flat park (Park 1, WS1; Video 1):\n\t\t\nDesign a tower structure using scaffolding pipes and clamps to allow for easy assembly of a strong but temporary structure (Figure 2Ab).\nBuild the frame for the pool section of the waterslide from 3 m long bamboo rods (Figure 2Aa1). Ensure the waterslide (Figure 2Aa2) has an angle of 25째, a length of 1.8 m, and includes a pool at the bottom.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Kuroishi Park is flat (Figure 2A).\nTo make a waterslide for a hilly park (Park 2, WS2; Video 2), take advantage of the natural slope.",
    "As in step 1.2.1, construct a frame for the pool section from bamboo rods and plywood using regional resources (Figure 2B). Ensure that the waterslide has an angle of 30째, a length of 6 m, and includes a pool at the bottom.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Kotosaki Park is hilly (Figure 1B).\nIf a park has a small slope in its center (Park 3, WS3; Video 3), create the waterslide using this small slope.\n\t\t\nUse bamboo rods and scaffolding to increase the natural slope (Figure 2C) upon which to build a waterslide, as in step 1.2.1. Ensure that the waterslide has an angle of 21째 at its steepest, a length of 4 m, and includes a pool at the bottom.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Kiwanami Park has small slope in its center (Figure 1C).\nIf present, use stairs to create a waterslide (School 4, WS4; Video 4).\n\t\t\nTo cover the staircase, build a structure with plywood and square wooden rods (Supplemental File 1) covered with cardboard to form a rail to keep the children on the slide (Figure 2D, center drawing). Ensure that the waterslide has an angle of 27째 and length of 6 m.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Kamiube elementary school has a staircase in the schoolyard (Figure 1D).\nConsider the safety of the playparks (Supplemental File 1).\n\t\t\nTo verify the safety of the structures, calculate the strength using simulations such as Finite Element Methods (FEM) (e.g., Adobe Fusion 360; Supplemental File 1).\nMake a prototype. Have multiple people pilot the prototype to find any potential risks, such as hard/protruding parts. If found, eliminate or cover such parts with soft caps. Consider leaving some minimal risks to allow children to learn how to overcome the risks on their own (Supplemental File 1).\nCover the slope with a tarp to create a waterslide and pool area (Supplemental File 1).",

Assembling materials (see Table of Materials)\nSmooth and clean the material surface.\nAssemble the framework with pipes, boards, joints, screws, and ropes, using an impact driver and a saw (Supplemental File 1).\nStake the corners of the framework into the ground.\nFix cardboard cushions at the steps.\nCover with the tarp to fit the shapes and secure with stakes and waterproof tape (Supplemental File 1).\nRun hose water down from the slide top.\nCheck the safety repeatedly and reinforce as needed.\nContinually monitor the safety during use and repair any issues immediately.\n3. Recording and quantitative analyses of activity\nCapture the children's use of the slides using video cameras.\nEstimate the ages of the children using each waterslide based on their height (Table 2).\nAssess the relationships between flow lines and activity level through qualitative observations and quantitative analyses, as shown in Figure 3.\n\t\nConvert video data to JPEG image files per second using Python (Supplemental File 2).\nUse Keynote to track each child's location with respect to the waterslide. Manually transform the location information to the top view image of the waterslide design (Supplemental File 2).\nConvert screenshots of a series of the object tracks to MP4 files (Supplemental File 2).\nUse Python detection on the MP4 files to determine object coordinates (Supplemental File 2) and calculate velocity (Supplemental File 2).",
