  "procedures": [
    "Tissue collection for the experiments described here was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Munich and the Ruhr-University Bochum. Studies were conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Patients gave their written informed consent prior to tissue collection.\n1. Tissue acquisition\nObtain human tissue from patients undergoing heart transplantation or cardiac surgery.\nBefore procuring the tissue, prepare 2 L of cardioplegic solution (further referred to as slicing buffer (Table 1)).\nAfter obtaining a 4 cm x 4 cm sized transmural left ventricular (LV) biopsy, place the tissue immediately (within 5 min after excision) in a closable plastic single-use sterile beaker containing approximately 70 mL of cold (4 °C) slicing buffer. Keep at 4 °C.\n\t​NOTE: The slicing buffer used in this protocol allows for cold storage (4 °C) of the tissue for up to 36 h. This permits cold transport of the tissue from clinics which are not close to the laboratory. However, transport times ≤ 24 h have proven to be optimal.\n2. Preparing agarose and the vibratome\nMake sure sufficient cultivation chambers are prepared and sterilized (Figure 1A).\n\t\nSubmerge the chambers and graphite electrodes in 1 L of a 10% isopropanol solution and agitate overnight. The following day, transfer the chambers to a 100% isopropanol solution for 3 min and autoclave the graphite electrodes at 120 °C for 10 min.\nLet the chambers and graphite electrodes air-dry under a laminar flow hood.\nAttach a circuit board to each of the chambers according to the available positions on the rocker. Place two graphite electrodes to the circuit board as per manufacturer's instructions.\nPlace a 35 mm Petri dish lid on top of the chamber to prevent contamination.",
    "Set up the Myodish cultivation system (see Table of Materials) in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 by connecting the system to a computer (Figure 1B).\nPrepare the 4% low-melt agarose in slicing buffer (without glucose; Table 2). The agarose can be stored at 4 °C for 6 months.\n\t\nOn the day of the experiment, melt a stock volume of agarose solution using a water bath set at 80 °C. Depending on the quantity, melting takes approximately 30 min.\nWhen the agarose is liquid, draw up 8 mL of liquid agarose into a 10 mL syringe, with an additional 2 mL of air. Close the syringe with a sterile cap and place it upside down in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min, to prevent the agarose from solidifying, and to equilibrate its temperature to prevent hyperthermia damage of the sample.\nIf present, turn on water cooling device of the vibratome at least 30 min prior to tissue slicing to allow for sufficient cooling capacity. Set the temperature of the water circulation to 4 °C. \n\tNOTE: The cutting tray and cooling plate used here both contained a built-in water circulation. This is highly recommended for cooling and to lower the contamination risks. It is however also possible to use ice as a cooling technique. Also, the water-cooling device does not need to be connected to the vibratome's cutting tray and/or cooling plate at this point in the protocol.\nClean the vibratome's slicing tray and sample plate by flushing all surfaces with 100% isopropanol for at least 3 min.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the vibratome system used, the vibratome set-up might differ. Refer to the manual of the vibratome present in the laboratory for information about the set-up and blade calibration methods.",
    "Fill the cutting tray up to 90%-95% with slicing buffer. In the currently used set-up, this corresponds to approximately 400 mL. Connect the tubing of the water-cooling device to the valves on the vibratome's cutting tray and cooling plate.\nDisinfect all tools needed for the preparation by submerging them in a 100% isopropanol solution for 5 s. Remove the tools from the isopropanol solution and air-dry under the laminar flow hood.\n3. Trimming and embedding the samples\nTransfer the tissue sample to a 100 mm Petri dish filled with cold slicing buffer. Keep the dish on a cooling plate at 4 °C (connected to cooler or placed on ice).\nRemove endocardial trabeculae by holding the endocardium with tweezers and using scissors to cut away approximately 3 mm of endocardial tissue. In the same way, remove excessive adipose tissue underneath the epicardium if present.\nFixate the cut tissue sample, endocardial side up, to a 2 cm x 2 cm rubber patch using four 0.9 mm x 70 mm 20 G needles that are fixed in a square position (0.9 cm x 0.9 cm; Figure 1C, D). Make sure that the diagonal edge of each needle tip is pointing inward. This enhances fixation and prevents damage to the myocardium.\n\tCAUTION: The orientation of the above-mentioned square should be orthogonal to the expected predominant myofiber direction.\nCut away all the excess tissue outside of the four needle square using a scalpel. If the size of the original sample allows, use two myocardial tissues samples during this preparation from the same raw sample.\nUsing tweezers, place the trimmed sample on a sterile piece of tissue to remove any excess slicing buffer left on the sample.To prevent drying out of the sample, do not keep the sample on the tissue for longer than 10 s.",
    "Place the sample(s) in a 35 mm Petri dish, such that the blade cuts perpendicular to the cardiomyocyte alignment and the epicardium is facing downwards. If the preparation includes two samples, make sure the samples are centered and do not touch each other.\nTake the agarose syringe from the water bath and submerge the sample(s) in agarose. (Figure 2A). Let the agarose solidify for 5 min on a cooling plate. The sample(s) must stay in contact with the Petri dish, which will ensure that the cutting plane will be parallel to the predominant myocardial fiber direction.\n\t​CAUTION: Do not fully empty the syringe, in order to prevent air bubbles. Pay attention to the amount of agarose that is left in the syringe during submerging of the samples. In the case of air bubbles in the dish with the samples, carefully pull air bubbles back into the syringe.\n4. Placing the samples on cutting tray\nRemove the solidified agarose containing the sample(s) from the 35 mm Petri dish using a spatula or similar tool, by wedging it in-between the sample and the side of the Petri dish. Cut away some of the agarose using a scalpel while keeping the samples covered.\n\tCAUTION: Do not remove too much of the agarose. There should be at least 5 mm of agarose left on the long and short sides in the X/Z plane.\n\tNOTE: Steps 4.2-4.4 need to be performed in rapid succession (i.e., maximum of 5 s). Have all required tools within reach prior to starting. No repositioning of the sample is possible after placement. Try to limit the exposure of the glue to air and moisture. Contact with air or fluids will solidify the glue, making it unusable.",
    "With a pipette, place and distribute 60 µL of glue in and around the center of the cutting platform.\nPlace the epicardial side of the sample contained in agarose on top of the glued area using tweezers. Do not reposition. The endocardial side of the sample must be visible in the agarose. Let the glue solidify for 1 min. Gently press the agarose containing the sample from the top with a blunt tool (e.g., tweezers) while preventing cutting into or damaging the agarose.\nPlace the sample platform in its designated position in the cutting tray of the vibratome, filled with slicing buffer.\n5. Starting the vibratome\nSet vibration amplitude to 1 mm and the initial cutting speed to 0.07 mm/s. Set the thickness of the slice to 300 µm to cut slices.\nAs long as the blade only cuts the agarose, increase the cutting speed to its maximum, which in this case is 1.50 mm/s. As soon as the vibratome starts cutting the tissue, decrease the speed to 0.07 mm/s immediately.\n\t​NOTE: If the tissue is not sliced smoothly, for example if there are large fibrotic areas in the sample, it may help to increase the cutting amplitude up to 1.5 mm and to reduce the cutting speed to 0.04 mm/s.\n6. Medium and incubator preparation during slicing procedure\nFill each cultivation chamber with 2.4 mL of complete cultivation medium (Table 3).\nPlace the cultivation chambers filled with medium on the cultivation system in the incubator set at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2, and a humidity of 80%. Equilibrate the medium for at least 20 min.\nConnect the cultivation system with a computer and start the corresponding software program.",
    "Set the rocker speed to 60 rpm and preset the stimulation parameters (stimulation pulses and frequency). For human cardiac slices, set the standard stimulation to biphasic impulses with 50 mA current, each consisting of 3 ms positive current, a 1 ms pause and a 3 ms pulse of inverted current, at a pacing rate of 30 beats per min (BPM).\n\tNOTE: In well preserved tissues, the typical stimulation threshold is around 15 mA. To ensure reliable stimulation and to account for any possible increase of the stimulation threshold, it is recommended to set current to a value that exceeds the stimulation threshold by two- to three-fold.\nCheck the electrode indicators of the software to verify that the electrodes of the cultivation chambers are working correctly.\n\t​NOTE: Action is needed whenever the channel indicator in the cultivation software turns red. In this case, the bipolar pulse charges are not balanced.\n7. Preparing the slices\nNOTE: Initial subendocardial slices are commonly not suitable for tissue cultivation and need to be discarded because of uneven morphology. After the first five to 10 slices, slice texture and morphology improve. The ideal slice is at least 1 cm x 1 cm, has no or only limited fibrotic patches, is not fragmented, and has homogeneous fiber alignment (Figure 2B, D). Interstitial fibrosis, located between the myocyte fibers, is often present in failing human myocardium. Surprisingly, this is not a negative predictor of cultivation success.\nPour an adequate amount of cold slicing buffer in a 5 cm Petri dish lid to ensure slices will not dry out. Place the slices in the Petri dish lid containing the cold slicing buffer.",
    "Separate the agarose from the tissue by using tweezers. Prevent touching the tissue. Handle the tissue carefully as any damage to the tissue will reduce the success rate of the cultivation.\nDetermine the direction of the myocardial fibers by close inspection against a light source. This is of importance when attaching the plastic triangles to the tissue in step 7.6.\n\tNOTE: Steps 7.4 and 7.5 need to be performed in quick succession, within 5 s.\nAttach two plastic triangles to a sample using glue in order to anchor the tissue inside the cultivation chambers.\n\t\nPlace 1 µL of glue on a sterile Petri dish lid. Use a hooked tweezer to pick up one of the autoclaved plastic triangles. Quickly dip the front edge of the triangle into the glue and paste the triangle onto the sample, perpendicular to the cardiomyocyte alignment. Repeat for the other triangle.\nTrim off tissue exceeding the triangle width with a scalpel (Figure 2C). Place the slice with the two mounted triangles back into the cutting tray's slicing buffer.\n\tNOTE: Repeat steps 7.2 to 7.5 until enough slices are prepared to fill the cultivation chambers. We recommend preparing a few additional slices to allow for the replacement of slices with poor contraction.\n8. Mounting the slices\nNOTE: The afterload is determined by the stiffness of the spring wire in the cultivation chambers. Three different types are available, based on the thickness of the spring wire.\nTake a medium-filled cultivation chamber from the incubator. Select one of the prepared slices and insert it into the chamber by connecting one triangle to each pin.",
    "Adjust the distance between the mounting pins according to the sample size. Make sure the sample is submerged in medium. Place the chamber back into its designated socket of the cultivation system in the incubator.\n\tCAUTION: Do not overstretch the tissue and do not over-bend the spring wire!\nSet the preload tension after placement of the dish onto the rocker.\n\t\nDecrease the preload by turning the adjusting screw counterclockwise. Do this until the baseline of the corresponding graph on the computer screen does not change anymore.\nCarefully increase the preload (i.e., increase the tension) by turning the adjusting screw clockwise. For the chambers with the highest stiffness, continue until the corresponding baseline in the graph has increased by 1000-1200 units, which corresponds to 1 mN of preload.\n\t\t​NOTE: The exact adjustment will depend on the individual spring constant of a cultivation chamber, which can be determined by calibration prior to an experiment according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recording software permits consideration of the individual chamber calibration so that forces will uniformly be displayed in µN. It is recommended to apply electrical stimulation from the start of the cultivation. As such, it is well possible that the slice starts contracting during the preload adjustment. In this case, focus on the diastolic baseline to assess the preload.\n9. Changing the medium\nPrepare cultivation medium according to the recipe in Table 3. Shortly before use of the medium, add 50 µL of β-mercaptoethanol (50 mM) to a 50 mL tube. Store at 4 °C.\nOnce every 2 days, partly exchange the cultivation medium. Refresh the medium every 2 days, if long term cultivation of the myocardial slices is desired.",
    "Pre-warm the fresh medium in a water bath or hot-air incubator at 37 °C for 30-45 min. Remove a cultivation chamber from the incubator and place it under a laminar flow hood.\n\tCAUTION: It is essential to keep the chamber, as well as the medium, warm at 37 °C (> 35 °C) to prevent hyper contractures due to low temperature. Less distinct damage may be present as an increase of diastolic tension within a few hours after medium exchange. This may seem to recover, but repeated stress might result in accumulating deterioration.\nRemove medium from the cultivation chamber, leaving approximately 0.8 mL in the chamber. Add 1.6 mL of fresh medium to the same chamber. The total volume of medium should be around 2.4 mL per chamber.\nPlace the cover of the chamber back and place the cultivation chamber back into its respective position.\nSubscription Required.
