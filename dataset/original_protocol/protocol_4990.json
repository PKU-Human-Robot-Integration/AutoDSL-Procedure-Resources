    "Generation of marker swap cassettes for transformationMarker swap cassettes to be used in the lithium acetate protocol below can be generated by two alternative means; by PCR amplification from or by restriction endonuclease digestion of the plasmids previously described in Lorenz (2015a and 2015b) (see below). Using appropriate modifications, this protocol can also be applied to constructs described elsewhere (Sato et al., 2005; Hentges et al., 2005; Gadaleta et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015). After the PCR or restriction digest run 1/20 volume of each reaction on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1x TAE at 80 V for 45 min to verify that the reaction has worked properly (band sizes to be expected for each reaction are detailed below). The remainder of the PCR reaction or restriction is stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0). DNA concentration is measured on a NanoDrop 2000c UV/Vis-spectrophotometer, and an appropriate volume (maximum 20 μl) to result in 1-5 μg of cassette DNA is used for each transformation.ura4+ marker swap cassette amplificationA 50 μl PCR reaction contains:100 ng of DNA from plasmid pALo120, pALo121, or pALo122 (Lorenz, 2015a and 2015b) to create cassettes by PCR for swapping an ura4+ marker to a kanMX6, natMX4, or hphMX4 marker, respectively.10 μl 5x Q5 reaction buffer200 μM dNTPs500 nM each of AL1forw (5’-agctacaaatcccactgg-3’) and AL1rev (5’-gtgatattgacgaaactttttg-3’) oligonucleotides as primers1 U Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymeraseMake up to 50 μl by adding the appropriate amount of sterile MilliQ water (see Note 1).Use the following PCR programme:30 sec at 98 °C35 x (10 sec at 98 °C, 20 sec at 55 °C, 85 sec at 72 °C)120 sec at 72 °CExpected band sizes for transformation cassettes:pALo120 (ura4+-to-kanMX6 swapping cassette): 1.97 kbpALo121 (ura4+-to-natMX4 swapping cassette): 1.74 kbpALo122 (ura4+-to-hphMX4 swapping cassette): 2.",

    "Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.Add 260 µl 40% PEG (see Recipes and Note 4) and incubate for 2-6 h at 30 °C. Mix well by carefully pipetting up and down.Add 43 µl DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), mix well by inverting the tube five times, and heat shock for 5 min at 42 °C (see Note 5).Plate suspension by evenly spreading onto 3 YES plates (~135 µl on each plate) without selection (see Recipes). After 24-48 h incubation at 30 °C, replica-plate these plates onto selective plates; either onto YES containing the corresponding antibiotic, or onto YNG lacking the corresponding supplement. Allow the selective plates to grow at 30 °C for several days until single colonies reach a diameter of 3-4 mm. Patch at least 20 colonies onto a fresh selective plate and incubate 24-48 h.Replica-plate onto a fresh selective plate and onto a plate selecting for the original marker, to ensure that the marker swap is correct (e.g., if the original strain was ura4+ and pALo120 was used to swap to kanMX6, the resulting strain must be resistant to G418 and unable to grow on media lacking uracil)."
