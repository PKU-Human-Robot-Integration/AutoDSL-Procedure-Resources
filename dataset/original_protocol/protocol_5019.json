    "Aliquot tube preparationPrint out labels containing the study name, study number, de-identified patient number and visit number, and paste on cryovials.Sample preparationMix the blood by gentle inversion several times to ensure a homogeneous suspension.Centrifuge the tubes at 1,800 x g for 20 min (brake can be on) at room temperature. Be sure that the tubes can clear the rotor in swinging-bucket configurations; some tube locations can cause collision with the rotor and result in broken tubes.If shipping to another location, wrap in protective foam and ship via same-day or overnight courier to the processing lab at room temperature.Note: Shipping sample at 4 °C (or on wet ice), can result in platelet activation and other unwanted physiological and phenotypic changes.PBMC isolationIn BSC, gently invert the CPT tubes several times, then pipette the plasma and PBMCs into a sterile 50 ml conical tube.Fill tube containing the plasma and PBMCs with PBS for a final volume of 50 ml in conical. Centrifuge at 250 x g for 10 min at room temperature with the brake on.Aspirate the supernatant carefully to not disturb cell pellet.A Pasteur pipette and vacuum can be used for aspirating as well as manually aspirating with serological pipettes and a pipette gun.Gently re-suspend the cells in 10 ml of PBS and remove an aliquot for cell counting. Use a 10 μl sample for a microscope using trypan blue exclusion, or amount needed for automated cell counter.After removing the aliquot for counting, fill the tube to final volume of 50 ml with PBS and centrifuge for 10 min at 250 x g with the brake on.Determining the number of aliquotsDepending on your cell count methods (manual or automated counter), determine the total amount of cells. This will be used to calculate how many aliquots of PBMCs are frozen down.",
    "Cells should be frozen in approximately 107 cells per ml of freezing media; when the total cell count is divided by 107, the result is the total number of aliquots.Place the appropriate number of cryovials on ice or in a cooling rack in the 4 °C to begin chilling the vials in preparation for freezing.Determining the volume of freezing mediaFreezing media is broken into two parts: ‘A’ and ‘B’. Part ‘A’ is made up of 100% Human AB Serum and Part ‘B’ is made up of 80% Human AB Serum and 20% DMSO.Note: Human AB Serum must be heat inactivated prior to use. Your samples will be frozen in a 50:50 mixture of Part ‘A’ and Part ‘B’, totaling a final concentration of 10% DMSO.Each aliquot will have a total of 1 ml of freezing media. Divide your total number of aliquots in half to determine what volume of each media you will need.Keep both parts of the freezing media on ice (or at 4 °C) until use.Freezing PBMC ALiquots (for viable cryopreservation)Aspirate the supernatant from the cells and re-suspend them with the volume of ‘A’ calculated in step 5c.At an approximate rate of 1 drop per second, and while swirling the sample, add the necessary volume of ‘B’.Do not re-freeze unused ‘B’ media.After all the freezing media has been added, gently pipette the sample up and down a couple times to ensure re-suspension. Over pipetting can result in cell rupture.Note: It is important to be efficient through this process, as warming DMSO is toxic to the PBMCs. Add 1 ml of the cell suspension to each pre-chilled cryovial and place the vials in a CoolCell or Mr. Frosty.Place the cells in a -80 °C freezer for 24 h.After 24 h, remove cells to a long-term LN2 freezer.",
    "Note: PBMC can be kept for days or even weeks at -80 °C before transfer to LN2; however, there is progressive loss of viability and function with longer storage at -80 °C. Also, repeated cycling between -80 °C (or dry ice) and LN2 will negatively affect viability and function. Thus, if cells are to be shipped on dry ice, it’s preferable to store them short-term at -80 °C, ship, then move to LN2."
