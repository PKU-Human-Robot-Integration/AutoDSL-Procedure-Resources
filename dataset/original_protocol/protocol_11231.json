    "1. Passaging and Culturing TUM622 Cells and CAFs in 2D Cultures\nPassaging and culturing TUM622 cells\n\t\nWarm 3D culture medium and cell dissociation reagents (see Table of Materials) for TUM622 cells at 37 °C.\nPassage TUM622 cells at 80% confluency in 2D flasks. Usually, this occurs 1 week after passaging.\nDiscard old medium from a T75 flask and wash once with 6 mL of HEPES buffer. Avoid pipetting directly onto the cells.\nAspirate the HEPES buffer. Add 4 mL of trypsin/EDTA (0.25 mg/mL, see Table of Materials) for a quick rinse and discard the trypsin/EDTA.\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin/EDTA and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Remove flasks from the incubator and tap the flasks to loosen the cells without creating air bubbles and return flasks to the incubator for an additional 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Prolonged exposure to trypsin will irreversibly damage the cells and alter their phenotype, thus it is recommended to limit the time cells are exposed to trypsin.\nConfirm cells have detached and dissociated under a light microscope (4x or 10x). Add 4 mL of neutralization buffer (TNS buffer) (see subculture reagent information in the Table of Materials) followed by 10 mL of 3D culture medium (see Table of Materials).\nPipette up-and-down gently to further dissociate the cells using a 10 mL pipette. Transfer the suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube.\nCount cell numbers using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter.\nSeed 0.8 x 106 cells/T75 flask in 20 mL of 3D culture medium (see Table of Materials).\nFeed the cells every other day by replacing half of the spent medium with fresh medium.\nPassaging and culturing CAFs\n\t\nPassage CAFs when cells reach confluency. Usually, this occurs after 5 days of culturing from a 1:2 split.",
    "Prepare CAF medium using RPMI basal medium with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% L-Glutamine and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. Warm the medium to 37 °C.\nIn a T75 flask, rinse CAFs with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once then add 2 mL of trypsin/EDTA and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nObserve under a light microscope to ensure cells have dissociated in the flask (4x or 10x). If not, extend the incubation for another 2-3 min.\nOnce cells have detached and dissociated, add 10 mL of 3D culture medium to neutralize the trypsin/EDTA and pipette up and down several times to further dissociate the CAFs.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL conical tube and spin down at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of 3D culture medium (see Table of Materials) and passage into two new T75 flasks.\n2. Plating TUM622 Cells in the Extracellular Matrix for 3D Culturing\nThe day before the experiment, thaw vials of basement membrane matrix in a 4 °C refrigerator overnight. Cooldown plastic pipettes (2 mL) and tips at -20 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Not all lots of basement membrane matrix have the same capacity to support the 3D growth of TUM622 cells. Therefore, it is necessary to acquire and test multiple lots of basement membrane matrix to identify those that support robust acini formation. Usually, this requires a higher protein concentration (16-18 mg/mL) in the matrix.\nOn the day of the experiment, warm 3D culture medium, HEPES buffer, trypsin/EDTA and trypsin neutralization buffer (TNS) in a 37 °C water bath. Immediately before setting up the culture, take the thawed basement membrane matrix out of the fridge and put the vial on ice.",
    "Cooldown the tissue culture plates on a metal platform cooler placed on ice. Place centrifuge tubes on a metal cooling rack on ice.\nUsing TUM622 cells obtained from step 1.1.7, calculate the desired number of cells needed for plating. Typically, 15,000-30,0000 cells are needed per well of a 24-well plate. Lower density is more suited for imaging and quantification, while higher density is preferred when collecting cells for RNA extraction or western blotting.\nTransfer cell suspension into a cooled centrifuge tube (each tube containing cells for triplicate plating) and spin down at 300 x g in a hanging bucket centrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully with an aspirating pipette attached to an unfiltered tip (20 µL), leaving approximately 100 µL of the medium in the tube (use markings on the tube as a guide).\nGently tap on the side of the tube to dislodge and dissociate the pellet before returning it to the cooling rack.\nUsing the 2 mL pre-cooled pipettes, gently mix the matrix by pipetting up and down a few times while keeping the vial in contact with the ice. Pipette at an even and moderate speed so that no bubbles are introduced into the matrix during this procedure.\nTransfer the appropriate volume of the matrix into each centrifuge tube. For plating triplicates in a 24-well plate, add 1.1 mL of basement membrane matrix to each tube.\nUsing pre-cooled tips, pipette the matrix in each tube up and down about 10 times to make a uniform cell suspension.",
    "Transfer 310 µL of cell/matrix suspension into each well of a pre-cooled 24-well plate. The pipette is placed at a 90° angle to the plate surface and the suspension added to the center of the well. The suspension should spread and cover the entire well without needing to tilt the plate.\nTo facilitate downstream immunofluorescence analysis, plate the cell/matrix suspension in parallel into 2-well chamber slides. Transfer 100 µL of cell/matrix suspension into the center of a well of 2-well chamber slide (see Table of Materials). This allows the matrix to form a dome-like structure with much smaller volume.\nReturn the plate and the chamber slide back into a tissue culture incubator and incubate for 30 min to allow the matrix to solidify. Examine the plate/slide under a light microscope to ensure that single cells are evenly distributed within the matrix (4x or 10x).\nAdd 1 mL of pre-warmed 3D culture complete medium into each well and 1.5 mL of 3D culture medium to each well of the chamber slide then return them to the incubator.\n3. 3D Coculturing of TUM622 Cells and CAFs in the Extracellular Matrix\nPrepare cell suspensions of TUM622 and CAFs according to section 2.\nCount the CAF cell density by taking 10 µL of cell suspension and mixing it with 10 µL of trypan blue.\nAdd 10 µL of the mixture to each of the two chambers on a hemacytometer to count and calculate cell density.\n\tNOTE: CAFs have irregular shapes and may not be accurately counted on an automatic cell counter.\nCo-embedding TUM622 cells and CAFs in basement membrane matrix",
    "Based on the cell density information, calculate the desired number of cells used for plating. CAFs are seeded at a 2:1 ratio of TUM622 cells. For example, for 30,000 TUM622 cells seeded, 60,000 CAFs are co-embedded.\nTransfer the appropriate volume of TUM622 as well as CAFs cell suspension into the same centrifuge tube and follow steps 2.5-2.11 for plating into 24-well plates. For immunofluorescence, transfer 60 µL of TUM622/CAFs mix to chamber slides as described in step 2.12).\nCoculturing TUM622 with overlaid CAFs in basement membrane matrix (see Table of Materials)\n\t\nSet up TUM622 mono-culture according to steps 2.5-2.13.\nTransfer twice the number of CAFs suspension (compared to the number of TUM622 cells seeded) into a centrifuge tube and spin down at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the CAFs in 1 mL of 3D culture medium.\nTransfer the 1 mL of CAFs suspension to the well containing the embedded TUM622 cells.\n4. Harvesting TUM622 Acini for RNA/Protein Extraction and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\nPrepare wash buffer and cell harvesting buffer according to the 3D cell harvesting kit protocol the previous day and chill overnight at 4 °C.\nKeep plates on a plate cooler and other reagents on ice before starting the extraction process.\nAspirate media from 3D culture wells without touching the matrix and gently wash the well 3 times with 1 mL of wash buffer.\nAspirate the final wash and add 1 mL of cell harvesting buffer to each well.\nUse a p1000 pipette tip to scrape the matrix off of each well.\nPipette up and down to further dissociate the matrix.\nTransfer 1 mL of the mix to a pre-chilled 15 mL conical tube. Add another 1 mL of harvesting buffer to the same well.",
    "Repeat steps 4.5-4.7, and transfer all mix of the same well into one 15 mL conical tube.\nCap the tubes and rock at 4 °C for 30 min.\nFill each tube with ice-cold PBS up to 10 mL and then centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant without touching the pellet. The supernatant should contain matrix fragments, but the spheroids should all be collected at the bottom of the tube.\nAdd ice-cold PBS for a second wash. Invert the tube a few times to dissociate the pellet. Spin down at 300 x g for 5 min.\nWhile spinning, prepare lysis buffer for protein and RNA collection.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and add lysis buffer for downstream processing to collect protein or RNA. Alternatively, cells could be resuspended for flow analysis/FACS sorting or serial passaging.\n5. Immunofluorescence of TUM622 Acini\nPrepare immunofluorescence buffer (IF buffer: PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween-20), primary blocking buffer (IF buffer with 10% goat serum), secondary blocking buffer (primary blocking buffer with 20 µg/mL goat anti-mouse F(ab')2)\nAspirate medium from 2-well chamber slides, rinse once with PBS and set the slide on metal plate cooler on ice. The chamber slide should remain on the metal plate cooler for the remainder of the protocol.\nAdd pre-chilled 4% PFA to fix the acini and incubate on ice for 20 min.\nRemove 4% PFA and wash three times with 2 mL of pre-chilled PBS each for 5 min with gentle rocking on a rocker.\nAspirate PBS and permeabilize with 1.5 mL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (pre-chilled) for 20 min. By the end of this procedure, the dome-like structure will become loose.",
    "Gently aspirate the permeabilization buffer from the chamber slide to avoid sample loss. This is achieved by adding a fine tip (20 µL) to the aspirating pipette and pressing the tip towards the corner of the chamber.\nWash three times with 2 mL of pre-chilled PBS each for 5 min with gentle rocking on a rocker.\nBlock the sample with the primary blocking buffer on ice for 1 h.\nRemove primary blocking buffer and add secondary blocking buffer and block for 30 min.\nAdd primary antibodies in primary blocking buffer and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of the antibodies used here should be higher than normally used for staining cells in 2D culture. Most of the primary antibodies used in this study are diluted at 1:100 dilution (see Table of Materials).\nRemove primary antibodies and wash the sample 3 times with 2 mL of cold IF buffer.\n\tNOTE: The samples could be loose, take extra caution when aspirating.\nIncubate the samples in secondary antibodies diluted in primary blocking buffer for 1 h at RT. The preferred secondary antibodies should be highly cross-adsorbed to reduce background staining. Most secondary antibodies used in this study are diluted at 1:200 dilution.\nRemove secondary antibodies and wash the sample 3 times with 2 mL of cold IF buffer.\n\tNOTE: The samples could be loose, take extra caution when aspirating.\nAdd PBS with DAPI (1:1,000 dilution) during the last wash to stain the nucleus. The perform another 2 washes in PBS.\nImage the samples on a confocal microscope within 3 days.\n\tNOTE: Due to the size of the organoids and limits in the objective's working distance, samples are usually imaged at 10x or 20x magnification.\n6. Preparing 3D Culture Samples for Immunohistochemistry",
    "Aspirate medium from 2-well chamber slides and rinse once with PBS.\nFix 3D cultures in 4% PFA at 37 °C overnight.\nRemove 4% PFA, surround cultures with 2.5 mL of histology sample gel (see Table of Materials) and place the slide at 4 °C to solidify for at least 1 h.\nTransfer samples surrounded with histological sample gel to tissue cassettes and processed in an automated tissue sample processor overnight.\nEmbed samples in paraffin wax and prepare for sectioning12.\n7. 3D Cytotoxicity Assay for Compound Screening (Example for One 96-well Plate)\nSet a 96-well plate on a plate cooler, a 25 mL reservoir on a reservoir cooler and a 15 mL conical tubes on ice before starting the experiment.\nPrepare cell matrix suspensions of TUM622 cells in a pre-chilled 15 mL polypropylene conical tube by adding the appropriate volume of basement membrane matrix to cells. The desired density for TUM622 cells is 10,000 cells per 70-75 µL of basement membrane matrix. Pipette up and down a few times to allow even mixing of cells within the matrix.\nMove the plate with plate cooler and reservoir with a reservoir cooler away from the ice to a dry surface to avoid contact of basement membrane matrix with ice during transfer.\nTransfer the matrix cell mixture to the cooling reservoir without creating bubbles.\nUsing a mechanical multichannel pipette (10-300 µL), transfer 70-75 µL of the mix cells into each appropriate well of a 96-well plate.\nIncubate plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min for the basement membrane matrix to solidify.\nAdd 100 µL of media in all rows and return the plate to the incubator.\nStart compound dosing the next day or later depending on the goal of the experiment.",
    "Spheroids can be re-fed and re-dosed every 2-3 days for up to 10 days, by removing spent media with an 8- or 12-well vacuum manifold and replacing with fresh media with or without desired compounds.\nThe number of TUM622 spheroids could be quantified using 3D imager according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nSubscription Required.
