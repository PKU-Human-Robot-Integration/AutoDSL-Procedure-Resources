    "All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Welfare Department of the Thüringer Landesamt für Lebensmittelsicherheit und Verbraucherschutz (03-048/16; TLV; Bad Langensalza, Germany).\n1. Cardiotoxin-induced Muscle Injury\nNOTE: Perform all experiments involving living mice in accordance with the national Animal Welfare Act and under appropriate aseptic conditions. Also, sacrificing of animals must be performed in accordance with the national Animal Welfare Act.\nDisinfect the inhalation box used for inhalation anesthesia and the surgery area with 70% ethanol. Place a sterile surgical cloth on the heating pad where the surgery will take place.\nTurn on the heating pad at 37 °C.\nAdminister analgesics (e.g., 1 mg/kg body weight meloxicam subcutaneously) 15 min prior to start of the surgery.\nNOTE: For a typical experiment, use mice which are at least 6 weeks old, sex-matched and in a good general physical condition.\nPrepare the cardiotoxin solution (20 µM in 0.9 % NaCl), store the solution at -20 °C.\nAllow the cardiotoxin solution to reach room temperature (RT).\nTransfer the mouse into the inhalation box and induce anesthesia with isoflurane (initiation 3.5 – 5 % in pure oxygen). Check the depth of anesthesia with a lack of response to a toe pinch.\nPlace the mouse on a clean paper towel and maintain anesthesia with a nose mask (1.5 – 3 % isoflurane in pure oxygen). Shave the injection area of the cranial lower leg (from knee to paw, Figure 1A). Remove all excessive loose hair.\nNOTE: Physically separating the shaving and injection area in the room will provide more sterile conditions for the injections.\nPlace the mouse in the lateral recumbent position on the heating pad covered with a sterile surgical cloth and maintain anesthesia with a nose mask (1.5 – 3% isoflurane in pure oxygen).",
    "Disinfect the injection area of the cranial lower leg (from knee to paw) with 70% ethanol.\nPerform a toe pinch before starting the intramuscular injection to ensure an adequate depth of anesthesia.\nInject 50 µL cardiotoxin (20 µM in 0.9% NaCl) into the tibialis anterior muscle using an insulin syringe with a 29-gauge needle. First, pierce the skin just distal of the knee.\nInsert the needle fully into the muscle (in myofiber orientation/parallel to the tibia bone) and inject the cardiotoxin slowly (10-20 s) along the full length of the muscle while moving the needle back and forth to allow an even distribution of the cardiotoxin thereby injuring the whole tibialis anterior muscle (Figure 1B,C).\nNOTE: Injure the tibialis anterior muscle from only one leg, the contralateral tibialis anterior muscle can serve as an internal control to determine that skeletal muscles were not pathologically affected before cardiotoxin injury.\nTransfer the mouse back to its cage placed on a heating pad and monitor the recovery process until the animal is conscious and becomes ambulatory.\nNOTE: The mice will only show a slight limp. If mice are limping heavily and do not put weight on the leg at all, sacrifice the mouse.\nAdminister analgesics during the following 2 days (e.g., 1 mg/kg body weight meloxicam subcutaneously, every 24 h) and monitor them on a weekly basis.\n2. Injection of Self-delivering siRNA into the Regenerating Tibialis Anterior Muscle (At Day 3 Post Cardiotoxin Injury)\nPrepare the siRNA solution by resuspending the siRNA (e.g., siRNA smart pool) in 0.9% NaCl (final concentration of 2 µg/µL) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.",
    "NOTE: The siRNA is chemically modified to facilitate the passive uptake by cells and protect it from nuclease degradation. No transfection reagents are needed, thereby reducing toxicity. Using a smart pool of four independent siRNA sequences targeting the same gene increases knockdown efficiency.\nStore the siRNA at -20 °C and transfer it on ice to the surgery room.\nDisinfect the inhalation box used for inhalation anesthesia and the surgery area with 70% ethanol. Place a sterile surgical cloth on the heating pad where the surgery will take place.\nTurn on the heating pad at 37 °C.\nTransfer the mouse into the inhalation box and induce anesthesia with isoflurane (initiation 3.5 – 5% in pure oxygen). Check the depth of anesthesia with a lack of response to a toe pinch.\nPlace the mouse in the lateral recumbent position on the heating pad covered with a sterile surgical cloth and maintain anesthesia with a nose mask (1.5 – 3% isoflurane in pure oxygen).\nDisinfect the injection area of the cranial lower leg (from knee to paw).\nPerform a toe pinch before starting the intramuscular injection to ensure an adequate depth of anesthesia.\nInject up to 50 µL siRNA solution (up to 100 µg total in 0.9% NaCl; directed against the target gene; use scrambled siRNA as control) into the injured tibialis anterior muscle using an insulin syringe with a 29 G needle. First, pierce the skin just distal of the knee, then insert the needle into the tibialis anterior muscle.\nInsert the needle fully into the muscle (in myofiber orientation/parallel to the tibia bone) and inject the siRNA solution slowly (10 – 20 s) along the full length of the muscle while moving the needle back and forth to allow an even distribution of the siRNA along the whole tibialis anterior muscle.",
    "Transfer the mouse back to its cage placed on a heating pad and monitor the recovery process until the animal is conscious and becomes ambulatory.\nNOTE: Analgesia is not necessarily following the injection of siRNA.\n3. Dissection of Tibialis Anterior Muscle\nPrepare the freezing solution (2 parts OCT compound and 1 part 30% sucrose in deionized water) at least 12 h before usage to avoid air bubbles.\nPrepare freezing molds by wrapping an aluminum foil around a pencil and seal it with tape. It is important that the bottom of the mold provides an even, closed surface.\nNOTE: Smaller freezing molds allow the faster freezing of the muscle avoiding freezing artifacts.\nSacrifice the mouse, e.g., by CO2 inhalation, at the respective time point of regeneration and spray the whole mouse and dissection tools with 70% ethanol.\nNOTE: Cervical dislocation can be applied, in addition, to avoid excessive bleeding at the leg when isolating the tibialis anterior muscle.\nRemove the fur and skin from the injured hindlimb by cutting the skin at the ankle with extra fine sharp scissors (cutting edge: 13 mm) and pulling up the skin towards the knee using forceps.\nTo expose the tibialis anterior tendon at the ankle, pull the remaining skin towards the foot or cut with sharp scissors.\nNOTE: The mouse can be pinned to a support board to allow better fixation.\nBefore harvesting the tibialis anterior muscle, remove the fascia using fine forceps (Dumont 5 or 7, straight or curved). Pinch the closed forceps through the fascia next to the tibia bone at the ankle of the injured leg (Figure 2A). Move the forceps towards the knee thereby tearing the fascia and exposing the tibialis anterior muscle (Figure 2B).",
    "To isolate the tibialis anterior muscle, expose the distal tendon and grab it with fine forceps (Dumont 7, curved). Cut the tendon using spring scissors (cutting edge: 5 mm, tip diameter: 0.35 mm) and pull the muscle (holding it at the tendon) towards the knee.\nTo harvest the tibialis anterior muscle, cut it as close to the knee as possible using sharp scissors.\nPrior to freezing, cut the tibialis anterior muscle at the mid belly region of the muscle with straight scissors into two halves of equal size to allow the analysis of the mid belly region (Figure 2C,D).\nFill the freezing mold halfway with the freezing solution.\nInsert the two halves of the tibialis anterior muscle into the freezing mold with the mid belly region facing the bottom of the mold (Figure 2E). Make sure the tibialis anterior halves are inserted in an upright position leaning against the wall of the freezing mold to avoid tipping of the muscle.\nNOTE: The more freezing solution is in the mold, the longer the freezing will take, thus increasing the risk of cryo-artifacts.\nHold the freezing mold using forceps and transfer it halfway into liquid nitrogen (Figure 2F). Make sure that no liquid nitrogen is entering the freezing mold during the freezing process.\nObserve the freezing process, the freezing medium changes color from transparent to white and becomes solid. Submerse the freezing mold in liquid nitrogen for a few seconds and transfer the freezing mold to a -80 °C freezer or to dry ice for future processing.\nStore the frozen muscles in the freezing molds at -80 °C until further usage.\nNOTE: The freezing molds fit well in 24-well plates or 1.5 mL reaction tubes allowing labeling and organized storage.",
    "Handle the muscle in the freezing molds for further usage always on dry ice.\n4. Cryosectioning of Regenerating Tibialis Anterior Muscle\nBefore starting sectioning, set the chamber temperature of the cryostat to -21 °C, the object temperature to -20 °C and the cutting thickness to 10, 12 or 14 µm (depending on the future applications) (Figure 3A).\nTransfer the muscle sample in the freezing mold into the cryostat and let it adjust to the temperature for several minutes. During this time, label the microscope slides.\nRemove the foil around the embedded muscle using precooled forceps inside the cryostat. Avoid touching of the sample as the cryomedium starts to thaw easily.\nMount the sample with the mid belly region of the tibialis anterior muscle directed upwards onto the metal sample holder of the cryostat using cryomedium. This ensures that the cutting site of the muscle (bottom of the mold) is facing the experimenter.\nInsert the sample holder with the mounted sample into the sectioning mechanism.\nNOTE: To ensure proper sectioning of the sample, use a new blade before starting.\nFirst, trim the sample block (30 µm) to get an even sectioning plane and to reach the respective region of the muscle (Figure 3B).\nAfter trimming, cut consecutive sections of the respective thickness (e.g., 14 µm).\nCollect the sections on microscope glass slides by holding the slide face down over the section. The section is attaching to the slide (Figure 3C).\nStore sections at -80 °C or -20 °C until further use or directly use for immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry.\n5. Immunostaining for Markers of Regeneration\nPerform all further steps in a humidified chamber.\nBriefly, equilibrate the sections at room temperature.\nFix sections with 1 mL of 2% PFA (in PBS, pH 7.4) per slide for 5 min at RT.",
    "Remove the 2% PFA solution by pouring it into the respective waste container.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the PBS by pouring it into a waste container.\nPer slide, add 1 mL of the permeabilization solution (0.1 % Triton X-100, 0.1 M Glycine in PBS pH 7.4) for 10 min.\nRemove the permeabilization solution by pouring it into a waste container.\nAdd 150 µL of the blocking solution (M.O.M. 1:40 in PBS pH 7.4) per slide and cover with the coverslip. Incubate for 1 h at RT.\nRemove the coverslip and the blocking solution, apply 100 µL of primary antibody solution [PAX7, DSHB, mouse IgG1, undiluted or devMHC, DSHB, undiluted, mouse IgG1and laminin (rabbit, 1:1,000)] per slide. Cover with coverslip. Incubate O/N (overnight) at 4 °C.\nNOTE: Perform a control staining by omitting the primary antibodies, incubate the section with blocking solution instead.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min at RT.\nRemove PBS by pouring it into a waste container.\nAdd 100 µL of the secondary antibody solution (Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG1 and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG in blocking solution, 1: 1,000) per slide and cover with the coverslip. Incubate for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the slides in the dark, e.g., use an aluminum foil to cover or use a black humidified chamber.\nNOTE: From now on all steps should be performed in reduced light conditions since some secondary antibodies are light sensitive.\nRemove the coverslip and the secondary antibody solution.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the PBS by pouring it into a waste container.",
    "Perform DAPI staining by adding 1 mL of the solution per slide to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the DAPI staining solution by pouring it into a waste container.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min at RT.\nCompletely remove the PBS used for washing.\nApply 2 – 3 drops of aqueous mounting medium and directly cover the slide with a new coverslip.\nLet the slides dry for 1 h at RT in the dark.\nStore the stained sections at 4 °C in the dark until further analysis using a fluorescence microscope.\n6. Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining\nPerform all further steps in a humidified chamber.\nFix sections with 1 mL of 2% PFA (in PBS, pH 7.4) per slide for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the 2% PFA solution by pouring it into the respective waste container.\nTransfer the slides into a Coplin jar.\nGently rinse the slides with tap water.\nNOTE: Do not turn on the faucet too high since that might damage the sections.\nTransfer the slides to the humidified chamber. Remove the liquid.\nApply 1 mL of Hematoxylin staining solution (Gill No 3) for 2 min.\nTransfer the slides into a Coplin jar.\nGently rinse the slides with the tap water until the nuclei turn blue.\nNOTE: Do not turn on the faucet too high since that might damage your sections.\nTransfer the slides to the humidified chamber. Remove the liquid.\nApply 1 mL of Eosin Y solution and incubate for 2 min.\nTransfer the slides into a Coplin jar.\nGently rinse the slides with tap water until the tap water coming off the slides is clear.\nRemove all liquid and let the slides dry for 2 min.\nMount in mounting medium suitable for immunohistochemistry."
