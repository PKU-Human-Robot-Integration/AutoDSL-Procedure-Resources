    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMock and library plasmids amplification\nTiming: 2 days\nThe sgRNA Library amplification is a crucial step to ensure sufficient DNA quantity (approximately 75 μg of DNA are required per screen) for performing multiple CRISPR screens (recommended to reduce the risk of false targets identification) and maintaining the genome-scale coverage.\nLibrary electroporation and amplification.\nPrepare two 2 L Erlenmeyer with LB+ Ampicillin medium by adding in each 250 μL of Ampicillin at [50 mg/mL] for 500 mL of LB medium and incubate at 37°C while performing the electroporation.\nPre-warm eight petri dishes at 37°C for electroporation efficiency measurement.\nPrepare 5 pre-chilled microcentrifuge tubes, one with 1 μL of mock DNA plasmid, three with library DNA plasmid at [10 ng/μL] and one with 1 μL of control DNA pUC19 (furnished with the Endura Cell kit) at [10 pg/μL].\nThaw electrocompetent Endura bacteria cells on ice (20 min).\nWhile the cells are thawing on ice, set the electroporator parameters as following: 10 μF ; 600 Ω ; 1,800 V.\nAdd 25 μL of electrocompetent Endura cells to each tube containing the DNA plasmids. Mix gently.\nTransfer 25 μL of the DNA/bacteria cells mix to a 1.0 mm pre-chilled cuvette without introducing bubbles.\nProceed to the electroporation and immediately add 1 mL of SOC medium at 22°C. Pipet up and down to resuspend the cells. Transfer the whole mix to a 15 mL propylene tube.\nReproduce steps g to h with the other tubes of library DNA and pool them in the same 15 mL tube.\nPerform the last electroporation with the control DNA and pour the electroporated cells in a different 15 mL tube.\nIncubate in a shaking incubator for 1 h at 37°C, 250 rpm.",
    "Note: The settings for the shaking speed is dependent on the orbital diameter of the shaker and the size of the flasks. The incubator used here has an orbital diameter of 19 mm. If using a shaker with different orbital diameter, the shaking speed needs to be adjusted. The new speed can be calculated using the formula r2 = R2x(d1/d2). d1 = the orbital diameter for the old shaker, d2 = the diameter for the new shaker, R = the rpm for the old shaker and r = the rpm for the new shaker.\nCollect 20 μL of each condition to measure electroporation efficiency.\nTransfer the bacteria electroporated with the mock and library plasmids into two different 500 mL pre-warmed LB medium and incubate 16 h at 37°C, 250 rpm.\nElectroporation efficiency measurement.\nFor Electroporation efficiency measurement, put 180 μL of SOC medium into 2 rows of 5 wells each, of a 96-well PCR plate (for example: A1-A5 and B1-B5).\nAdd 20 μL of the bacteria electroporated with the library into the first well of the first row (A1). Then add 20 μL of the bacteria electroporated with the control into the first well of the second row (B1).\nMix the wells and then transfer 20 μL from Column 1–2. Proceed to a successive dilution from Column 2–5.\nCollect 50 μL from each well of columns 2–5 and spread them on the petri dishes with Agar LB+ Ampicillin and incubate at 37°C for 16 h.\nCount the colonies formed the next day. From pUC19 transformation, calculate the transformation efficiency in colony forming unit (cfu)/μg using the following formula: Efficacy (CFU/μg) = X × 10Y × (Z/50) with X: number of colony, Z: μL of bacteria/SOC and Y: the column corresponding to the dilution.",
    "Note: The required efficacy should be > 5 × 107 cfu/μg for conserved library amplification.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nPlasmid DNA extraction.\nThe next morning, centrifuge 30 min at 5,000 g to obtain the bacterial pellet containing the plasmid DNA and proceed to purification.\nPause point: if needed, you can freeze the bacterial pellet obtained after amplification at −20°C for up to one month before plasmid purification.\nPerform plasmid purification using Qiagen EndoFree® Plasmid Mega Kit, as instructed by the manufacturer[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=399337ce-2fb3-495a-b2f3-e35a17f61cab&lang=en]. One column is necessary for 500 mL of LB. The expected yield of DNA retrieved should be > 3.5 mg.\nCritical: Plasmid DNA purification should include an endotoxin removal step. Endotoxins strongly influence transfection of DNA into primary cells and sensitive cultured cells leading to reduced transfection efficiencies.\nResuspend your DNA pellet in 250 μL of endotoxin-free buffer TE from the kit and freeze at −20°C.\nThaw and measure DNA concentration with NanoDrop spectrophotometer.\nAliquot the mock and library DNA plasmids at [1 μg/μL] and keep at −20°C.\nNote: At this step, the coverage of the amplified library has to be confirmed before proceeding to making virus to ensure the sgRNA are well represented, see PCR amplification of sgRNA region for NGS analysis section.\nMock and library retroviral virus production\nTiming: 2 days\nViruses later use for transduction are produced here by Plat-E packaging cell lines, that encapsulated the sgRNA library into retroviruses. Thus, efficient transfection of Plat-E cells with DNA plasmid is mandatory for large-scale production of retroviral particles. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDay 1: Plat - E seeding\nBefore starting, ensure that you have enough plasmid and transfection reagent.\nRemove Plat-E culture medium from two 75 cm2 flasks and rinse the cells with 10 mL of PBS.",
    "Detach the cells using 2.5 mL of TrypLE™ Express 1× and incubate 5 min at 37°C 5% CO2.\nHarvest the cells and centrifugate at 500 g 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 20 mL of seeding medium and count.\nSeed 16 × 106 Plate-E cells in five CellStar dish 20 cm (Greiner for cell culture) and incubate 24 h at 37°C 5% CO2.\nDay 2: Transfection\nPer 20 cm dish, add 3 mL of Opti-MEM in a 15 mL polypropylene sterile tube with 15 μg of plasmid DNA and mix with up and down.\nAdd 80 μL of TransIT®-293 reagent to the mix with gentle up and down and incubate at 22°C for 30 min.\nReplace the Plat-E medium from each 20 cm dish with 16 mL of fresh Plat-E viral production medium.\nAdd dropwise the transfection mix of OptiMEM, plasmid and TransIT®-293. Gently swirl the dish and incubate at 37°C 5%CO2.\n24 h after the transfection, replace the medium with 16 mL of fresh Plat-E viral production medium and incubate at 37°C 5%CO2 for 24 h.\nNote: Depending on the viral production efficacy, one to two 20 cm dishes are required for mock virus and between four to six dishes for the library viral production to perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, with the transduction of at least 200 × 106 activated T cells.\nT cell extraction and activation\nTiming: 3 h\nT cells extracted from harvested spleen and lymph nodes must be activated 24 h for efficient transduction.\nCoat a 6 well plate with anti-CD3 antibody [2.5 μg/mL] by diluting 5 μL of anti-CD3 in 1 mL of PBS per well and incubate 30 min at 37°C.",
    "Note: Make sure to cover the plate with parafilm to avoid drying. The coating can also be prepared the day before and conserved at 4°C.\nNote: Instruction are given for 1 × 107 cells. Adjust the volumes according to your cell count. The Miltenyi Pan T Cell isolation kit II provides T cells negative selection. Thus, T cells will be retrieved from the eluted fraction. You will obtain approximately 90 × 106 to 100 × 106 cells from one immunocompetent C57BL6-Cas9 mouse and isolate 20% of T cells.\nSacrifice the mice according to operative legal and ethical recommendations.\nCollect spleen and lymph nodes (inguinal, mesenteric, axillary, mandibular) in microcentrifugation tubes filled with sterile MACS buffer and keep on ice.\nIn sterile condition, place 70 μm cell strainers on a 6 well plate and add 2 mL of MACS buffer in each well.\nProceed to organ dissociation using a syringe plunger.\nRinse the strainer with up to 5 mL of MACS buffer and transfer the cell suspension in a 15 mL sterile tube.\nSpin down 5 min at 500 g.\nProceed to spleen red blood lysis with 1 mL of Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer incubation for 1 min at 22°C and add then 5 mL of MACS buffer.\nSpin down 5 min at 500 g.\nPool the cells from lymph nodes and spleen and count.\nProceed to T cell isolation using the Miltenyi Pan T Cell isolation kit II following the manufacturer’s instruction[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001946.PDF], with MACS MultiStand magnet, LS column and 30 μm pre-separation filters.\nRinse the anti-CD3 coated plate with 1 mL of PBS/well and add the T cell suspension at 1.5 × 106 T cells/mL with 5 mL per well in T Cell culture medium.",
    "Perform T cell activation5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] by adding [2 μg/mL] of anti-CD28 antibody, [10 ng/mL] of murine IL-7 and [5 ng/mL] of murine IL-15, gently mix and incubate 24 h at 37°C, 5%CO2.\nNote: Split the medium and add cytokines every two days or when the medium is turning yellow.\nT cells transduction with retroviruses\nTiming: 7 h\nThis section details the transduction of 24 h activated murine Cas9-expressing T cells by single spinfection of viruses harvested 48 h–72 h after transfection with the Teichmann Retroviral Mouse Genome-wide CRISPR Knockout library and the pMSCV-U6sgRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP vectors (See timeline). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nBefore starting, pre-heat the centrifuge at 32°C.\nHarvest Plat-E cells supernatant 48 h–72 h after the transfection, pass it through a PVDF 0,45 μm filter using a 20 mL syringe, collect in 50 mL tube and keep on ice.\nRemove 4,5 mL of medium from each well of T cells culture.\nAdd polybrene to a final concentration of [8 μg/mL] in each well of the 6 well plates.\nTitrate the quantity of virus to add to obtain only 35% of BFP+ T cells, which corresponds to a low multiplicity of infection (MOI<0.3) associated with only one sgRNA integration per cell, two days after spinfection (typically: 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of final volume).\nIn our hands, we add 2 mL of filtered supernatant and 2 mL of Plat-E viral production medium.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 g during 2 h at 32°C.\nPlace the 6 well plates back in the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nRemove 4.5 mL of medium from T cells culture after 3–4 h of incubation.\nAdd 4 mL of fresh T cell culture medium complemented with IL-7 [10 ng/mL] and IL-15 [5 ng/mL] and incubate for two days at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "Note: Renew half of the culture medium with appropriate dose of cytokine every two days, or sooner if your pH indicator is showing signs of acidification (yellow).\nPuromycin selection and SIP calculation\nTiming: 6 days\nTo ensure the single integration of one sgRNA per T cell, it is important to infect the cells at low MOI. Following Chen et al., protocol,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] we calculate a Single Infection Percentage (SIP) using the survival ratio of transduced T cell after Puromycin exposure. If the infection events are considered as independently-occurring, the SIP is the probability of a cell being infected by n viral particles if the MOI is m is given by the Poisson distribution,\n  P  ( n )  =    m n  ·  e  − m     n !    \nThe SIP calculation allows to determine the optimal viral volume that results in 30–35% of T cells surviving in puromycin-containing medium or 30–35% BFP+ expressing T cells, ensuring the integration of only one sgRNA per T cell.\nThis section details the protocol for T cells expansion and selection with puromycin 48 h after the transduction step to enrich in GW-KO T cells.\nHarvest, pool and count the transduced T cells (take an aliquot to assess the BFP expression in live cells by flow cytometry analysis, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2262-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flow cytometry gating strategy to assess the transduction, survival and activation of genome-wide mutated T cells at day 4 after extraction from C57BL6 Rosa26-Cas9-EGFP mice\nNote: The viability should range between 40 to 60% and BFP expression should be below 40% to ensure the integration of one sgRNA per cell.\nSpin down 5 min at 450 g.\nPrepare 2× fresh T Cell culture medium containing IL-7 [20 ng/mL], IL-15 [10 ng/mL], and puromycin [10 μg/mL].",
    "Note: We recommend to perform a puromycin killing dose response if you are using other than activated T cells.\nRemove half of the old medium from the centrifuged T cells.\nAdd half fresh medium (2×) to ensure a concentration of 5 × 106 T cells/mL, with 5 mL per well in 6 well plates.\nPlace in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.\nNote: For SIP calculation, seed 106 transduced T cells in triplicate in 96 well plate, in a final volume of 200 μL with 100 μL of old medium and 100 μL of fresh medium with IL-7 [20 ng/mL], IL-15 [10 ng/mL] with or without puromycin treatment. Similarly, incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.\nFor cells staining, prepare a 50 μL/sample master mix of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies against T cells markers of interest in MACS buffer with Fc block and counting beads (For example: live/dead, CD4, CD8, CD44 activation marker, CD62L homing marker at 1:200, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nTo calculate the SIP:\nCalculate Psurvival using the following formula:\n  P s u r v i v a l =   l i v e  c e l l s  w i t h o u t  p u r o m y c i n   l i v e  c e l l s  w i t h  p u r o m y c i n      \nThen, calculate SIP using the following formula from Chen et al.,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]:\n  S I P =    ( 1 - P s u r v i v a l )  × ln  ( 1 - P s u r v i v a l )    P s u r v i v a l",
    "Note: Expected SIP value should be higher than 75% to be sure only one sgRNA have been transduced per T cells.\nPCR amplification of sgRNA region for NGS analysis\nTiming: 8 h\nThis part details the essential steps to uncover changes in sgRNA diversity from the library amplification time point to the end of the screening process. Here, we assess the library representation after plasmid amplification and after viral integration in 50 × 106 GW-KO engineered murine T cells (corresponding to approximately 500 different sgRNA copies). A first step of genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction from GW-KO T cells is required prior to sgRNA region amplification by PCR 1 and Illumina NGS tails tagging with PCR2. A more detailed protocol on this matter has already been published,7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] we only report here the specificities related to the mentioned GW-KO library of sgRNA.\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) from 50 × 106 transduced and puromycin-selected T cells is extracted using DNeasy® Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen)[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=63e22fd7-6eed-4bcb-8097-7ec77bcd4de6&lang=en] on ten columns. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: The maximum amount of gDNA to be extracted per column correspond to 5 × 106 cells. The PCR1 of gDNA from transduced T cells has to be performed on all the extracted gDNA to ensure library coverage, typically on 300 μg of gDNA.\nPerform 200 parallel PCR1 reactions in 50 μL final volume with 1.5 μg of DNA per reaction with Herculase II Fusion Enzyme with dNTPs Combo, in the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2262_7.csv\nNote: Keep Herculase on ice or at −20°C until needed.\nCarry out the same PCR1 with amplified GWKO library DNA plasmid as control: perform 10 parallel reactions with 10ng of DNA each.\nTransfer 50 μL of the PCR 1 master mix into each well of a 96-well plate and cover.",
    "Spin down at 700 g 5 min at 4°C to get all the liquid to the bottom as well as to remove air bubbles.\nRun in the thermocycler with the following parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2262_8.csv\nNote: For the PCR amplification of the GWKO library vector, only run 18 cycles of PCR1.\nNote: To avoid cross-contaminations with the generated amplicons, we recommend to perform the following steps in a dedicated post-PCR room with a specific cabinet.\nAfter sgRNA region amplification, pool the 200 parallel reactions and the 10 reactions in two different 15 mL tubes and mix. Expected PCR1 product size is 246 bp.\nPerform PCR1 products clean-up using AMPure XP beads and DynaMagTM-2 magnet from 150 μL of each pooled tube according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.beckman.fr/reagents/genomic/cleanup-and-size-selection/pcr] with a 1:1.8 ratio.\nElute and concentrate in 50 μL of ddH2O.\nSet up the PCR2 mix accordingly:\nPrepare a master mix for 8 reactions (4 reactions for transduced T cells gDNA PCR2, 4 reactions for the amplified library plasmid PCR2).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2262_9.csv\nTransfer 50 μL of the PCR 2 master mix into each well of a 96-well plate and cover.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nRun in the thermocycler with the following parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2262_10.csv\nAfter running PCR2, pool the 4 reactions in two microcentrifuge tubes.\nPerform a PCR2 products clean-up by using AMPure XP beads from 150 μL of each pooled tube with a 1:1 ratio according to the manufacturer’s instructions and elute in 50 μL of ddH2O.\nQuantify the purified samples with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit using manufacturer’s protocol (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf]). Expected PCR2 product size is 313 bp.\nAdjust the DNA concentration to 10 pg/μL - 500 pg/μL of DNA.\nNote: The maximum total DNA concentration for this sensitive chip is 500 pg/μL per fragment. https://resources.perkinelmer.com/labsolutions/resources/docs/GDE_DNA_High_Sens_User_Guide.pdf?_ga=2.180854887.1582170491.1662388256-1531866421.1662388256[href=https://resources.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/gde_dna-high-sens-user-guide.pdf].",
    "Precisely evaluate the purified PCR2 product size and purity using LabChip GX Touch HT with DNA 1K / 12K / Hi Sensitivity Assay LabChip and DNA High Sensitivity Reagent Kit prior to pooling the two samples in equimolar concentration and sending for sequencing.\nSend the samples for sequencing together with an aliquot of U6-Illumina-seq2 and iPCR-tagseq primers.\nNote: If heteroduplex are observed, you should run PCR1 or PCR2 with less cycles."
