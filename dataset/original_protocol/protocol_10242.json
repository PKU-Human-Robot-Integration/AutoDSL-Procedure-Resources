    "The use of animals in this protocol was approved by the University of Notre Dame Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, followed all regulatory requirements and guidelines, and was conducted in a facility that is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), International.\n1. Selection of Animals\nAcquire pathogen-free Sprague Dawley rats from a reputable vendor or breeding colony.\n\tNote: Often, the facility veterinarian or manager can direct the investigator to appropriate sources. Rats of approximately 250 g body weight are suitable for this procedure.\nOne day prior to surgery, examine the animals to be used to ensure that they are clinically healthy. In this regard, weigh the animal and assess the body condition; note any abnormality in respiration, the presence of any open wounds or masses, and the general activity level of the animal. Note any abnormality in the surgical record and consider such observations as potential exclusion criteria.\n2. Anesthesia and Preparation of Animal for Aseptic Surgery\nFor analgesia, administer 1.1 - 1.2 mg/kg of sustained release buprenorphine, subcutaneously to the rat 2 h before surgery. Apply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes, and administer 2 mL of warmed sterile physiologic saline subcutaneously.\nAnesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine hydrochloride (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Apply a small amount of ocular lubricant to each eye to prevent corneal dessication. Once the animal’s respiration is steady and there is no longer any response to a firm toe pinch, the rat has reached a level of anesthesia sufficient for surgery. An acceptable level of anesthesia can be further confirmed by the presence of deep, regular respiration, and normal color of the eye (versus pallor, which might suggest inadequate cardiovascular perfusion).",
    "Shave the ventral abdomen with a commercial clippers from the pubis to the sternum and from the lateral margins on the ventrum. Remove the clipped hair by applying a moist paper towel to the area.\nScrub the shaved area with an iodophor antiseptic followed by a wipe with 70% ethanol. Apply surgical drapes so that a window for the incision can be isolated from potential contamination.\nDon a sterile surgical gown, a face mask, and a hair bonnet. Thoroughly wash and scrub hands with soap and don sterile surgical gloves.\n3. Creation and Repair of the Ventral Abdominal Hernia\nPrior to surgery, sterilize surgical instruments by autoclave.\nUsing a scalpel, make an approximately 3 - 4 cm vertical incision along the ventral midline down to the level of the abdominal musculature. Lift the abdominal wall gently with a forceps and create a small opening through the linea alba. To protect the underlying viscera, insert a forceps through the hole and into the abdominal cavity to serve as a protective guide as the muscle wall is incised to create an approximately 2 cm x 2 cm full thickness defect, cutting approximately 1 cm lateral from each side of the midline on both ends of the linea alba incision.\nLay a pre-cut 2 cm x 2 cm section of mechanical bridging material, 4-layer SIS in this case (Figure 1), over the defect.\n\tNote: Alternatively, an underlay approach can be used in which the section of material is placed into the abdominal cavity to cover the defect from the interior aspect.\nSuture the four corners of the bridging material to the abdominal wall muscle using 4-0 silk or nylon in a simple interrupted suture pattern.",
    "Note: The use of non-absorbable suture allows easy identification of the implanted material upon harvest versus absorbable suture material.\nSecure each edge of the material with three additional sutures spaced equally. Examine the entire circumferential edge to ensure that significant gaps do not exist that might allow passage of viscera through the abdominal wall; and, if such gaps exist, place additional sutures to further secure the margin.\nClose the subcutaneous tissue with 4-0 absorbable suture in a simple interrupted pattern. Close the skin with surgical staples, though suture applied in a simple interrupted pattern may also be used.\nDo not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to regain sternal recumbency; and do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered from anesthesia. During this time, keep the animal in a warm area to prevent hypothermia.\nExamine animals daily that have undergone this procedure to ensure full recovery and normal healing. Remove skin staples with a staple remover 7 - 10 days following surgery.\n4. Harvest of the Implanted Material\nConsistent with the needs of the study, euthanize, with carbon dioxide overdose administered at a chamber fill rate of 10 to 30%, the animals at a pre-determined time, often 21 - 28 days following surgery.\nUsing standard necropsy tools, open the skin and abdominal wall and expose the area of the implant.\n\tNote: If non-absorbable sutures were used to secure the implant, the material can be identified by the original sutures (Figure 2).\nObserve any gross pathological observations including any adverse reactions (e.g., wound dehiscence, abscess, seroma, hematoma) and adhesion extent and tenacity to the underlying viscera.",
    "Remove the implant site by cutting a wide section of tissue that includes the implant. Place the sample in a fixative, such as 10% neutral buffered formalin, in preparation for processing for histological examination and characterization.\nSubscription Required.
