    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California, San Diego.\n1. Mice\nChoose the appropriate mouse strain for the study.\nPurchase mice from a supplier or amplify a line to obtain appropriate experimental numbers.\nGroup-house purchased mice in the animal facility for at least 1 week prior to beginning the study to allow for an ample acclimation period.\nBegin the pre-experimental acclimation phase when mice are 8 weeks old.\n2. Housing\nChoose cages that are large enough to contain an un-obstructed running wheel, food receptacle, and a water bottle.\nRegulate room temperature and humidity to complement the hypothesis being tested.\n\tNOTE: Higher temperatures will reduce the development of ABA28.\n3. Running Wheels\nChoose wheels with wireless communication to avoid potential distractions and entanglements within the cage, see the Table of Materials for an example.\n4. Water Bottles\nSelect a water bottle that will not compete for space with the running wheel or food receptacle in the home cage.\nIf providing drug treatment in the drinking water, duct tape the bottle to create a light-sensitive environment.\n5. Food\nSelect a low-fat chow appropriate for the hypothesis being tested (e.g., Envigo's Rodent Diet 8604).\n\tNOTE: Diets high in fat and sugar can reduce the development of ABA29.\nUse a small glass jar to provide chow, approximately 65 cm in diameter x 50 cm in height.\n\tNOTE: An automated feeder may be used instead of a glass jar, which may reduce stress by limiting investigator interference. This may be most advantageous if performing ABA studies with drug manipulations.\n6. Pre-experimental Acclimation Phase\nSet up the experimental area by choosing a cage rack close to the laptop and wheel hubs. This will limit issues with data transmission.",
    "Turn on the laptop and wireless hubs.\nOpen the wheel management software on the laptop.\n\t\nLook at the software to ensure both hubs are active.\nOpen \"tools\" and select \"delete wheels.\" Repeat this step 5 times.\nClose the software, then re-open it.\nPlace 3 AAA batteries into the battery pack of a wheel base.\n\t\nConnect the battery pack wires to the hardware of the wheel base. This will be disconnected prior to use. Close the battery pack into the wheel base.\nCheck the software to ensure the wheel base is listed with the ID \"1\" under the appropriate wireless hub. If the base is not listed as ID \"1\", unhook the battery pack, and start over at step 6.2.\nChange the wheel ID from \"1\" to the mouse ID under the name column.\nAdhere the running wheel's base to the bottom of the cage with duct tape to ensure stability. Do not allow any tape to stick out, as mice will chew on exposed tape.\nChoose a running wheel disc without a corroded magnetic piece.\nPlace the wheel on the base and rotate the wheel to verify clearance from the cage walls and grating.\nSpin the disc a specific number of rotations to ensure the wheel running software is properly counting rotations.\nPrevent pieces of chow from being lost in the bedding or getting wet by duct-taping the underside of the food jar to the cage floor, away from the running wheel and the water bottle.\n\tNOTE: Wet chow increases food intake compared to dry chow30.\nPlace 5 pieces of chow into the jar.\n\tNOTE: The chow during the pre-experimental phase is available ad libitum and does not need to be weighed. Exposure to running wheels during the acclimation period may intensify ABA21,31.",
    "Place a full water bottle in the cage and provide water ad libitum.\nRepeat until all cages have a wirelessly connected running wheel, food, and water.\nIndividually place mice into their appropriate cages.\nIn the wheel managing software, go to \"file\" and click \"start acquisition.\"\nWatch the software update to ensure wheel rotations are being counted and the system is working well.\nAcclimate mice to the experimental housing conditions for 2 total days.\nAssess mice during this phase to ensure they are healthy enough to handle the ABA experiment.\nCheck cages for any flooding from water bottles each day. If bottles have flooded, replace the old cage with a new cage and repeat the necessary steps to adhere wheels and food to the cage without interference.\nOn day 2, check cages for food levels. If food is low, refill with 2 pieces of chow. Do this without disturbing the mice.\n\tNOTE: If during the pre-experimental acclimation phase any mouse is exhibiting hypophagia or is underweight, remove the mouse from the study.\n7. Experimental Baseline Phase - Day 1\nSelect \"end\", and then \"start acquisition\" in the wheel management software.\nMeasure out 9 g chow in a small plastic beaker on a scale with 0.00 g sensitivity. Record the exact weight.\nGently remove and weigh the mouse in a large plastic beaker on a scale with 0.0 g sensitivity. Record weight.\n\tNOTE: It is crucial to limit the stress of mice while handling, therefore handle them patiently.\nDispose of all acclimation food.\nSearch bedding for any food that may have been removed from the jar and dispose of that as well.\nLeave the water bottle in place, but ensure it is adequately full.\nClean soiled running wheels with 70% isopropanol and paper towels.",
    "If cleaning was necessary, after the isopropanol dries, return the mouse to its cage and replace the cage on the rack.\nRepeat these steps until every mouse is weighed and 9 g of food is measured out and placed in cages.\n8. Experimental Baseline Phase - Days 2 - 7\nReturn to the animal facility at the same time every day. Do not vary in taking measurements by over or under 10 min.\nMeasure out 9 g chow in a small plastic beaker on a scale with 0.00 g sensitivity. Record the exact weight.\nGently remove and weigh the mouse in a large plastic beaker on a scale with 0.0 g sensitivity. Record weight.\nPull the food jar out of the cage and dump all the food into a small beaker on the 0.00 g scale.\n\t\nIf feces and bedding are in the food jar with the food, pick out all of the bedding and feces. Use a small strainer to rub powdered food into the weighing beaker. Remove any feces before doing this with tweezers (if necessary).\n\t\t​NOTE: Bedding will not break up into smaller pieces to fit through the strainer.\nSearch for any food remnants in the cage and add them to the beaker to be weighed. Record the amount of food remaining.\n\t\tNOTE: If the bedding and cage must be searched, it is best to do so while the mouse is in the weigh beaker or transfer cage to reduce stress.\nDispose of all food.\nWipe jar clean and place back into the cage. Replace tape if necessary.\nPlace the previously measured 9 g of new food into the jar.\nClean soiled running wheels with 70% isopropanol, then dry the wheels. Do this one cage at a time and do not accidentally interchange wheels.",
    "End and restart acquisition in wheel running program every other day.\nRepeat these steps until the start of the restriction phase.\n9. Experimental Restriction Phase - Day 1\nEnd and start acquisition in the wheel management software.\nWeigh mice, old, and new food per baseline protocol.\nDo not clean wheels now. This may distract mice during their limited feeding period.\nAllow access to new food, 9 g of chow, for 6 h. Record the time food is offered.\n\tNOTE: The time during the light cycle that food is available will affect the development of ABA. Since mice normally sleep during the light cycle, giving access to food during this time exacerbates the development of ABA, since mice do not usually consume the majority of their daily food at this time. Conversely, mice given food access during the dark cycle will develop ABA more slowly32. Adjusting duration of food access will result in longer or shorter survival times (Figure 2). Food anticipatory activity (FAA) is hyperactivity, which occurs immediately before food is offered32,33,34. FAA can affect the development of ABA, as it has been shown that the denial of wheel running access during FAA ameliorates ABA behavior32.\n\t\nRemove food exactly 6 h later for each mouse and measure the quantity remaining. Record the time food is removed.\nClean wheels now, if necessary, and attempt to do so without getting behind on pulling food from subsequent cages.\nWeigh food and calculate the difference in food to determine the amount of food eaten per mouse.\nCalculate the dropout weight for each mouse.",
    "NOTE: Dropout weight is when a mouse must be removed from the experiment when it reaches 75% of its final measurement of baseline body weight. For example, if a mouse weighs 20 g at the beginning of the restriction phase, when it reaches 15 g it must be removed from the experiment.\nKeep a copy of the dropout weights on hand in the animal facility.\n\tNOTE: Experiments evaluating recovery from ABA may be attempted; food is either provided ad libitum, or wheels are locked to study the process by which mice return to a healthy body weight34.\n10. Experimental Restriction Phase - Days 2 to 14\nRepeat all measurement steps in the Restriction Day 1 protocol. Do not restart wheel acquisition.\nIf a mouse reaches drop weight (75% of its baseline body weight), remove the wheel and food jar from the cage and provide ample food on the bottom of the cage, then proceed with the other mice. Once all cages have been attended to, euthanize all mice that have reached drop weight.\nLeave the wheel on for each mouse for the duration of the experiment.\nCheck each mouse daily for any injuries. If necessary, clip damaged toenails, treat sores, etc. Ask animal care personnel for advice if unsure about how to proceed with an injury.\n11. Ending the Study\nIf the study has lasted 14 days, weigh all the mice on day 15. Restriction day 1 weight is considered a baseline weight.\n\tNOTE: The length of the study can be modified to address the hypothesis being tested. Longer duration food access periods may be used to extend study length.\nEuthanize mice as necessary.\nTake dirty equipment to appropriate rooms.\nEnd wheel count acquisition on day 15 to provide 10 full days of data.\nTurn off wireless wheel hubs.",
