    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNuclei isolation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step accomplishes the isolation of nuclei from ground plant leaves. Fresh or frozen (stored at -80°C) plant leaf tissue can be used as starting material. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] shows a schematic summary of this step.\nCollect enough young leaves of the selected plant (at least 5 grams) and process it immediately or flash freeze it in liquid nitrogen and store it at -80°C until use.\nIn the chemical fume hood, set up a magnetic stirrer with an empty 1 L beaker on top of the stirrer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/477-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Correct settings for nuclei isolation using the protocol\n(A) Equipment that needs to be placed inside the chemical fume hood.\n(B) Ice used during nuclei isolation to keep the sample at 4°C.\n(C) Example of the expected size of a nuclei pellet.\nWeight 5 grams of leaf tissue and quickly transfer to a pre-cooled mortar.\nGrind 5 grams of frozen leaf tissue in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle until the fine power can be seen.\nCritical: Always keep enough liquid nitrogen in the mortar to prevent tissue from thawing during grinding.\nTransfer the grinded tissue to a 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of cold NIBM, add a stir bar, and seal the flask with aluminum foil. Transfer the flask to the 1 L beaker on top of the magnetic stirrer inside the chemical fume hood and add ice to the beaker (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nCaution: This step as well as all the following steps should be performed inside a chemical fume hood.\nKeep the flask on ice for 15 min with gentle stirring (set the stirrer speed to less than 85 rpm).",
    "Critical: Avoid using high stirrer speeds because it could break the nuclei and you will lose nuclear DNA. If the ice melts, replace the ice bath and continue stirring. Low temperature and gentle stirring preserve the integrity of nuclei and guarantee higher DNA concentration.\nFilter the homogenate through four layers of cheesecloth and one layer of Miracloth and collect the filtered solution in a new 250 mL flask. Squeeze the pellet to allow maximum recovery of nuclei and rinse the flask with 5 mL of NIBM.\nNote: Change your gloves between samples and before moving on to the next steps.\nFilter the solution again through one layer of Miracloth and collect the nuclei solution in a flask containing a stirrer bar.\nAdd 5 mL of cold NIBT to the filtered nuclei solution, seal the flask with aluminum foil and keep the flask on ice for 15 min with gentle stirring .(set the stirrer speed to less than 85 rpm).\nCritical: Avoid using high stirrer speeds because it could break the nuclei and you will lose nuclear DNA. If the ice melts, replace the ice bath and continue stirring. Low temperature and gentle stirring preserve the integrity of nuclei and guarantee higher DNA concentration.\nTransfer the mixture into 50 mL Falcon tubes (2 per sample; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: To prevent the contents from spilling during centrifugation steps, parafilm can be used to secure the cap of the Falcon tubes.\nCentrifuge the Falcon tubes at 2,400 × g at 4°C for 15 min. If you do not see a white pellet in the bottom, see Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCarefully discard most of the supernatant without disturbing the pellet (∼ 35 to 40 mL) and resuspend the pellet in the remaining buffer (∼15 mL) by gently tapping the tubes.",
    "Critical: Avoid vortexing or vigorously shaking the tubes because it could break the nuclei and you will lose nuclear DNA.\nAdjust the volumes of both tubes to 45 mL with fresh NIBM and gently mix by inversion.\nCentrifuge the Falcon tubes at 2,400 × g at 4°C for 15 min. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nRepeat step 12.\nCombine the contents of both Falcon tubes in a single Falcon tube and adjust the volumes of the tubes to 45 mL with fresh NIBM.\nCentrifuge the Falcon tube at 2,400 × g at 4°C for 15 min. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nRepeat the washing steps (steps 12, 13, and 14) one more time for a total of three washes. Gently discard all the supernatant by pouring without disturbing the pellet (∼ 50 mL) and resuspend the pellet in 1.7 mL warm (65°C) DNA Extraction Buffer. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdd 300 μL of proteinase K (1 mg/mL) and mix gently by inversion.\nCritical: Avoid vortexing or vigorously shaking the tubes because it could shear the DNA.\nDNA extraction\nTiming: hands-on time 4 h\nThis step accomplishes the extraction of DNA from lysed nuclei using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to remove proteins, RNase A to remove RNA, and isopropanol or NaCl and ethanol to precipitate DNA. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows a schematic summary of this step.\nIncubate the nuclei solution at 60°C in an incubator with gentle shaking (250 rpm) for at least 18 h. Longer incubation time can be used to increase DNA yield (18 h to 20 h). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCentrifuge the Falcon tube at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min to collect all the liquid on the walls of the tube at the bottom of the tube.",
    "Critical: Cut the pipette tip or use wide bore tip to avoid shearing the DNA during transfers. This should be applied to steps 22, 24, 25, and 27.\nTransfer supernatant into one 15 mL tube (expect 2 mL).\nAdd 2 mL of phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), gently mix the content by inversion (at least 5 min) and centrifuge at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nCaution: Wear adequate personal protective equipment and work inside a chemical fume hood.\nTransfer the top transparent aqueous phase (2 mL) to a new 15 mL tube and repeat step 22 using an equal volume (2 mL) of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1).\nTransfer the aqueous phase to a new 15 mL tube and add 5 μL of RNase A (at 10 mg/mL) to the solution and incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nAdd an equal volume of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1), gently mix the contents by inversion (at least 5 min) and centrifuge at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nTransfer the aqueous phase to a new 15 mL tube and precipitate the DNA as follows.\nFor DNA precipitation you can follow one of two different protocols:\nAdd an equal volume of cold (-20°C) isopropanol and mix by inversion. Incubate the tubes on ice for at least 1 h and centrifuge at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to pellet the DNA. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Add ½ volume of 5 M NaCl to the sample and mix by inversion. Then, add 3 volumes of cold (-20°C) 95% ethanol and mix by inversion. Incubate the tubes at -20°C for 1 h (do not use more than 1 h because NaCl could precipitate and contaminate the sample) and centrifuge at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to pellet the DNA. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: After this step, handle the tubes containing DNA on ice, unless indicated otherwise.\nCarefully discard the supernatant without disturbing the DNA pellet.\nWash the DNA pellet with 4 mL of cold (-20°C) 70% ethanol and centrifuge at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nDiscard the ethanol and air dry the pellet for 30 min (up to 1 h) at 20°C–25°C. If extracting DNA from nuclei of sugarcane samples, proceed to step 44 (No need for further purification for sugarcane DNA samples).\nTo the DNA pellet, add 2 mL of G2 Buffer (QIAGEN Cat#1014636). Incubate the mixture at 50°C for 15 min.\nNote: Do not pipette or vortex to solubilize the pellet faster, it will solubilize by itself.\nDNA purification and quality control\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThis step allows to improve the A260/A230 ratio using a QIAGEN Genomic Tip 20/G column. Other kits for genomic DNA purification can be used (GenFind and Zymo columns) as long as you validate that they yield similar results. This step allows to check the concentration and quality of DNA before sequencing. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows a schematic overview of this step.\nEquilibrate the QIAGEN Genomic Tip 20/G column using 1 mL Buffer QBT (QIAGEN Cat#1905).\nPour the extracted DNA sample through the equilibrated column.\nOnce the liquid has passed through the column, add 1 mL of Buffer QC (QIAGEN Cat#19055) to wash the column.",
    "Repeat step 35 two more times for a total of 3 wash steps.\nAfter washing, place the column over a clean 15 mL tube and elute the genomic DNA with 1 mL of pre-warmed (55°C) Buffer QF (QIAGEN Cat#19056). After the liquid has passed through the column, add an additional 1 mL of pre-warmed (55°C) Buffer QF.\nAllow the eluate to cool down at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 1.4 mL of cold (-20°C) isopropanol to the eluted DNA and mix gently by inversion (no more than 10 times).\nIncubate the mixture at -20°C for 1 h (up to 12 h).\nCentrifuge the tube at 3,500 × g at 4°C for 30 min and discard the supernatant without disturbing the DNA pellet.\nAdd 4 mL of cold (-20°C) 70% ethanol and mix by inversion (no more than 10 times).\nCentrifuge the tube at 3,500 × g at 4°C for 10 min and discard the supernatant without disturbing the DNA pellet.\nAir dry the pellet for 30 min (up to 1 h) at 20°C–25°C.\nResuspend the DNA pellet in 50 μL Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.5), AE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl; 0.5 mM EDTA; pH 9.0) or PCR grade water at 20°C–25°C, and store it at 4°C until sequencing. Troubleshooting 3, 4, or 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Do not pipette or vortex to solubilize the pellet, because it could shear the DNA. Avoid freezing and unfreezing the samples before sequencing to prevent DNA shearing.\nPause Point: DNA can be stored at 4°C for 5 days before quality control.\nCheck the DNA quality by running 1 μL of DNA in a 1% agarose gel.\nCheck the DNA concentration with Nanodrop or using Qubit."
