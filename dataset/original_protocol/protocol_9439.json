    "1. Kinase Purification Resources and General Immunoprecipitation Pipeline\nNOTE: Kinases for use with this assay may be sourced from immunoprecipitates of cultured cells or by recombinant means such as affinity-tagged purification6. Below is a general protocol for flag-tagged immunoprecipitation that may have to be modified depending on the kinase of interest. Everything should be kept on ice when possible.\nAdd 2 µL of 1 mg/mL antibody to 200 µL of cell lysates (usually ~1 mg/mL total protein concentration) and incubate at 4 °C for 1 h while rocking.\nWash protein A sepharose beads 2-3 times with lysis buffer (see below) by briefly spinning at 4 °C for 30 s to 1 min at 5,000 x g (\"touch spin\"), removing supernatant with a pipette, and resuspending beads in buffer.\nPrepare lysis buffer: 50 mM HEPES pH 7.7, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Triton X 100 or 0.1% NP-40.\nAdd 30 µL of 50% slurry of protein A sepharose beads in lysis buffer to lysates; incubate at 4 °C for 1 h while rocking.\nTouch spin at 4 °C to pellet the beads and remove the supernatant.\nWash 3 times with 1 mL of bead wash buffer (1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.4).\nWash once with 1x kinase reaction buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2). Remove as much buffer as possible without removing beads.\n2. Initializing Kinase Reactions",
    "NOTE: For IP kinase assays, ~15 µL of unsuspended beads is a typical starting sample. For recombinant protein kinase assays, typical starting amounts range from 0.1-1.0 µg in 1-10 for 25-50 µL final reaction volumes. Adjust the volumes of recombinant protein samples to be equal with the buffer they are stored in prior to initializing the assay. When using high amounts of kinase, include a carrier protein such as BSA to aid in maintaining protein stability for the duration of the assay.\nPrepare the 5x kinase reaction buffer given below:\n\t50 mM HEPES pH 8.0\n\t50 mM MgCl2\n\t50 mM Benzamidine (protease inhibitor)\n\t50 mM DTT (reduction agent)\n\t250 µM ATP (unlabeled, or \"cold\")\nKeep kinase samples on ice in 1.5 mL tubes. Prepare the following reaction mixture in separate, chilled 1.5 mL tubes:\n\t21 µL H2O\n\t6 µL 5x kinase reaction buffer\n\t1 µL radiolabeled (\"hot\") ATP\n\t2 µL substrate (~5 mg/mL)\n\tNOTE: For recombinant kinase assays, volume may be adjusted to accommodate purified protein. Calculate such that final reaction volume is 30 µL. Use this recipe to prepare a master mix. Upon receipt of labeled ATP, dilute stock in H2O to a specific activity of 0.01 mCi/µL prior to adding to reaction mixture.\nTo initialize the assay, add entire reaction mixture to kinase sample and incubate reaction at 30 °C for 5 min to 1 h depending on activity of kinase being assayed.\n\tNOTE: When working with a kinase whose activity has not been previously assayed, perform a time course of kinase activity with 5 min intervals between time points.\n3. Reaction Termination and SDS-PAGE\nStop reaction by putting on ice and adding 7.5 µL 5x Laemmli sample buffer 6.\nHeat at 100 °C for 30 s to 2 min in heat block.",
    "Touch spin and load 20 µL per well on 10-15% SDS-PAGE gel. Run gel long enough to separate kinase and substrate (typically 1 h at constant power of 5 W) Make sure to keep gel apparatus shielded to limit exposure to 32P.\nHere, use homemade gel apparatuses, but standard commercially available mini-gels are perfectly suitable. Use the dimensions as follows:\n\t\tGels: 8 cm width, 5.5 cm length (resolving), 1.5 mm thickness.\n\t\tCombs: 15 wells, 1.5 mm thickness, 2.9 mm width, 16 mm depth\n4. Gel Staining and Drying\nCaution: For all steps be sure to reduce personal exposure to 32P by using radioactive shielding and wearing personal protective equipment. For more information on specific steps some helpful references are included.\nRemove the gel from glass/alumina plates and place in 50 mL Coomassie stain (10% glacial acetic acid, 50% methanol, 0.25% R-250 dye) for 1 h on an orbital shaker set to 50 rpm. For this step use a container that is slightly larger than the gel itself.8\nMove the gel from stain to fixing solution (10% glacial acetic acid, 20% methanol) in order to de-stain. Rock the gel in 600-700 mL of fixing solution overnight on orbital shaker at 50 rpm. Place pieces of foam or knotted laboratory wipes in the container with the gel to absorb the Coomassie dye 8,9.\nRemove gel from fixing solution and soak in 200 mL methanol for 1-2 min with gentle agitation until gel turns milky white. This will help prevent cracking during the drying step.\nWet a 14 cm x 14 cm piece of qualitative filter paper with methanol and place onto slab gel vacuum dryer. Lay the gel down onto the filter paper front side facing up.",
    "Cover the gel with plastic wrap carefully to avoid wrinkles and air bubbles. Run the dryer for 1.5 h at 80 °C. After the vacuum has been attained open the lid and roll out any air bubbles if needed with a soft rubber brayer.\n5. Autoradiogram and Scintillation Counts\nRemove dried gel and attach an autorad marker, phosphorescent ruler or dots to the filter paper on the side of the gel. If using dots make sure they are in an asymmetric pattern. This will align the gel with the film after exposure and development.\nUse a Geiger counter to check the intensity of the signal. For weaker signals exposure at -70 °C to -80 °C with an intensifying screen will increase the film band density.\nIn a dark room put dried gel in a film cassette with film and an intensifying screen in the following order from top to bottom: gel, film, intensifying screen.\nAttach the intensifying screen to the lid of the cassette and tape the gel in place to make this step easier. The intensifying screen emits light when irradiated by the beta particles from the 32P. These light emissions penetrate the film more efficiently than the beta particles.\nMake sure the wavelength emitted from the intensifying screen corresponds to a wavelength the film is most sensitive to.\nUse a Geiger counter to determine how long to leave exposure for: if cpm count is ~100 or below, try overnight at -70 °C. If count is ~10,000, start with a 1 h exposure and optimize from there.",
    "At the conclusion of the exposure remove the film and develop in a medical/X-ray film processor. If the exposure was performed at -70 to -80 °C, either allow the cassette to warm to room temperature to minimize condensation on the film or remove the film immediately before condensation forms10.\nLay the film over the dried gel/filter paper and align the image of the marker/dots with the markers/dots on the dried gel. Mark on the film the bands corresponding to the protein standards. Label the protein standards and which lanes the reactions are for future reference.\nExcise the bands from the gel that correspond to bands of interest on the film and place them in 7 mL scintillation vials. Add 4 mL of scintillation fluid and count with liquid scintillation counter. Confirm the counter is set to monitor the correct energy spectrum window for 32P.\n\tNOTE: Be sure to also excise the band corresponding to substrate from the no-kinase control lane. This will be used to calculate background radiation that will be subtracted from all sample scintillation counts.\n6. Analysis of Results\nNOTE: The autoradiogram provides a qualitative visualization of results. For accurate quantitation, 32P incorporation can be measured with a scintillation counter. Data are usually expressed in terms of relative activity, as shown in Figure 1B. As long as uniform conditions are maintained for all samples, relative measurements of specific activity are sufficient to compare treatments.",
    "When calculating absolute specific activity values, perform a rigorous optimization of all reaction conditions, including kinase, substrate, and cold ATP concentrations, in order to ensure a linear range of activity over a time course (e.g. 2 x [kinase] = 2 x specific activity). For kinases with high specific activity, perform assays with increased substrate concentration in case kinase activity is limited by amount of substrate.\nCalculate the specific activity of kinase of interest in units of nanomoles phosphate transferred per min per mg kinase.\nSubtract blanks from the cpm in the counted bands.\nCalculate the decay of hot ATP: [(1/2)^(t/t1/2)] x 0.95 where t is the number of days since the reference date (should be provided by vendor), t1/2 is the half-life of 32P, which is 14.3 days, and 0.95 reflects the efficiency of the scintillation counter. Example: if using hot ATP that is 28 days old, the decay value should be 0.245.\nCalculate the picomoles (pmol) of total ATP in the assay (usually this is equal to the amount of cold ATP in the reaction): assay volume (µL) x [cold ATP] (µM) = total ATP (pmols). Example: 30 µL x 50 µM = 1500 pmol\nCalculate cpm/pmol ATP: [µL of hot ATP x (2.2 x 107) x decay factor]/ pmol of cold ATP.\n\t\tNOTE: The value of 2.2 x 107 converts 0.01 mCi/µL of ATP to cpm.\nCalculate the amount of kinase in the assay in mg. For both recombinant kinase and immunoprecipitated kinases, standard methods such as BCA assays are suitable to determine starting concentrations. Example: wtERK2 0.0002 µg/µL in a 50 µL kinase reaction is 0.01 µg, or 1 x 10-5 mg.",
    "Calculate total cpm in assay. Assemble 30 µL reactions and run 20 µL from each reaction on a gel. Multiply the cpm counted (after blank subtraction) by a factor of total assay volume/ volume loaded. Continuing the above example, multiply all counts by 1.5, or 30/20.\nCalculate the specific activity of the assayed kinase:\n\t\tTotal cpm in assay)/(cpm/pmol ATP)/(assay time in minutes)/(amount of kinase in mg)\n\t\tNOTE: Dividing the above value by 1,000 yields the specific activity in nanomoles/minute/mg\nCalculate how many mols of phosphate are incorporated into a substrate (as long as its molecular weight is known). This is used to determine the number of phosphosites on a particular protein once the reaction has gone to completion.\n\tTotal cpm in assay)/(cpm/pmol ATP)]/(amount of substrate in pmols)\nSubscription Required.
