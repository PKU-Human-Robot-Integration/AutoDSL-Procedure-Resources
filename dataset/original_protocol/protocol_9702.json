    "In the studies described in this protocol, primary human keratocytes were used. This research was performed in compliance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Primary keratocytes were isolated from leftover human cadaveric corneoscleral tissues from Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty surgery, which were obtained from the Cornea Department of the ETB-BISLIFE Multi-Tissue Center (Beverwijk, the Netherlands) after obtaining consent from the next of kin of all deceased donors.\nNOTE: See the Table of Materials for details about all materials, reagents, equipment, and software used in this protocol.\n1. Fabrication of 3D cell culture substrates\nCreate a negative glass mold (#1) containing all features of interest, in this case, made from glass using a femtosecond-laser direct-write technique (see Figure 2).\nCarefully place the negative glass mold (#1) on the bottom of a Petri dish.\nPrepare a PDMS prepolymer by placing an empty 50 mL conical tube on a scale, tare the scale, and pour the desired amount of silicone elastomer base into the tube.\nAdd curing agent using a Pasteur pipet so that the final ratio of elastomer base and curing agent is 10:1 (w/w).\nThoroughly mix the components in the conical tube using a spatula.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g for 70 s to remove all air bubbles.\nPour the PDMS prepolymer on top of the negative glass mold (#1) in the Petri dish to cover it completely.\nPlace the Petri dish with the negative glass mold (#1) and the PDMS prepolymer in the vacuum desiccator and start the vacuum pump. Once a vacuum is reached, wait for 5 min to remove all bubbles present at the interface between the mold surface and the PDMS prepolymer.\nRemove the vacuum and take the Petri dish out of the desiccator.\nCure the PDMS prepolymer overnight in the oven at 65 °C.",
    "Carefully remove the newly cured positive PDMS chip (#2) from the negative glass mold (#1) by lifting the edges of the PDMS using a spatula. If the positive PDMS chip (#2) tends to stick to the negative glass mold (#1), add ethanol or water to the edges of the imprint while lifting.\n\tNOTE: The fluid will run in between the two layers and ease the separation of the negative glass mold (#1) and positive PDMS chip (#2).\nUsing a blade, cut off the sides of the positive PDMS chip (#2) so that a rectangular chip remains.\nPlace the positive PDMS chip (#2) in a desiccator next to a small vial with a droplet of tridecafluoro(1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)trichlorosilane, a silanization agent, and leave under vacuum overnight.\n\tNOTE: Silanization will make sure the imprint will not bind to other PDMS layers later in the protocol. Other silanization agents and/or methods may also work to ensure that the surfaces of the PDMS chips will not stick to other PDMS layers.\n\tCAUTION: Tridecafluoro(1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)trichlorosilane is flammable (H226) and causes severe skin burns and eye damage (H314). Wear personal protective equipment, work in a fume hood, and wash hands thoroughly after handling. Keep the silanization agent away from heat, hot surfaces, sparks, open flames and other ignition sources. Store between 15 and 30 °C (P280, P210, P240, P403, P235, P310).\nRemove the vacuum and place the positive PDMS chip (#2) on the bottom of a Petri dish. Pour PDMS prepolymer (10:1) on top to produce multiple negative PDMS molds (#3).\nPut the Petri dish under vacuum in the desiccator for 15 min to remove all bubbles.\nCure the PDMS prepolymer at 65 °C overnight, after which the negative PDMS mold (#3) can be peeled off from of the positive PDMS chip (#2) using a spatula.",
    "Silanize the final negative PDMS mold (#3) using silanization agent in a vacuum desiccator overnight.\nProduce multiple cell culture chips (#4, see Figure 2) of approximately 5 mm thickness by pouring PDMS prepolymer in the negative PDMS mold (#3), removing bubbles using the desiccator and curing for 3 h at 65 °C. With a razor blade, cut the chip to the final size as visualized in Figure 2. Store the chips at room temperature.\n\t​NOTE: Surface roughness may influence the cellular response. If needed, an additional thin layer of PDMS can be used as a coating on the positive PDMS chip (#2) to smoothen the surface. To do so, pour a small droplet of PDMS prepolymer on the chip and spread it over the complete chip using pressurized air. Cure the coated chip at 65 °C for 3 h and continue with step 1.12.\n2. Fabrication of flat PDMS samples (control samples)\nPrepare PDMS prepolymer (10:1) according to steps 1.3-1.6.\nPlace a glass coverslip on the rounded vacuum post in the center of the spin coater.\nTurn on the vacuum to attach the glass coverslip to the machine and pipet a droplet of PDMS in the middle of the coverslip using a Pasteur pipet.\nDistribute the PDMS prepolymer over the glass substrate using the following protocol to get an approximately 10 µm thick layer.\n\t\nSpincoat for 10 s at 0.45 × g, acceleration: 0.2 × g/s.\nSpincoat for 50 s at 44.8 × g, acceleration: 0.54 × g/s.\nTurn off the vacuum, remove the coverslip from the spin coater using tweezers, and place it in a Petri dish. Cure the PDMS overnight in the oven at 65 °C and store at room temperature afterwards.\n3. Substrate passivation of 3D cell culture substrates",
    "Activate the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the PDMS chip (#4) using O2-plasma. Using tweezers, place the chip in the basket of the plasma asher.\nRun an ashing cycle using a power of 20 W for 30 s. Vent the ashing chamber using N2.\nTake the chip out of the basket and place it in a small PDMS container (see Figure 1).\nUsing a Pasteur pipet, add 500 µL of Poly-L-lysine (PLL, 0.01%) on the top of the chip so that the complete surface is immersed in the PLL solution. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemove 450 µL of the PLL from the cell culture chip with a pipet and rinse the chip surface three times with 500 µL of 0.1 M HEPES buffer (8 < pH < 8.5). Always leave a small volume of liquid on the PDMS chip to avoid drying out of the sample, which will reduce the final pattern quality.\nMake 500 µL of a 50 mg/mL methoxypolyethylene glycol-succinimidyl valerate (mPEG-SVA; MW 5,000 Da) solution in 0.1 M HEPES buffer (8 < pH < 8.5) per cell culture chip and let it incubate on the sample for 60 min. Since the mPEG-SVA has a half-life of 15 min, be sure to prepare the required amount just before use.\n\tNOTE: The mPEG-SVA is dissolved when the solution is completely transparent.\nRemove 450 µL of the mPEG-SVA solution using a micropipet, and wash the chip surface five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Make sure to pipet up and down multiple times per wash to ensure all unbound mPEG-SVA is removed. To prevent the sample from drying out, minimize the time between washing steps and make sure to use an excess (500 µL or more) of PBS for washing.",
    "Store the samples by immersing them in PBS or continue to the patterning step of the protocol.\n\t​NOTE: If desired, passivation can be performed under sterile conditions when working in a culture cabinet and working with sterile solutions and equipment.\n4. Storage of patterned cell culture substrates\nNOTE: 3D cell culture substrates can be stored during different steps in the process.\nStore cured PDMS cell culture chips under dry conditions at room temperature.\nStore the passivated cell culture chips in one of these two ways:\n\t\nStore in PBS at 4 °C for up to 7 days.\nStore in dry conditions for up to several months. To obtain dry samples, remove the PBS and rinse multiple times using double distilled water (ddH2O). Blow-dry using a nitrogen- or air-gun.\n5. Design of digital masks used for photopatterning\nNOTE: Patterning of 3D substrates can be performed using a single or multiple focal planes (see Figure 3). A single focal plane can be used on features that are not larger than one digital mirror device (DMD, approximately 300 µm x 500 µm) and that are not too tall (50-100 µm). In that case, design a digital pattern using the TIFF-mode. For features that exceed the dimensions of one DMD and are relatively tall, divide the patterning of the substrate into multiple steps. In this case, multiple patterns are designed using the PDF-mode that all individually focus on single focal planes.\nDesign a digital mask using design software tools.\n\t\nPatterning in TIFF-mode (pixels): Create a completely black artboard of 1,140 x 1,824 pixels (the exact size of 1 DMD, approximately 300 µm x 500 µm) and fill the artboard with the shapes of interest. Export the artboard as an 8-bit TIFF-file.",
    "NOTE: Different grey levels in the pattern design determine the amount of exposure that will be performed on that location.\nPatterning in PDF mode (metric units): Create a black artboard of the desired size in mm and fill the artboard with any shape of interest. Divide the pattern into multiple files if the 3D substrate needs to be patterned using multiple focal planes. Save the artboard as a PDF-file.\n\t\t​NOTE: Different grey levels in the pattern design determine the amount of exposure that will be performed on that location.\n6. UV-photopatterning of 3D cell culture substrates\nCalibration\n\tNOTE: Calibration of the laser is done to get proper focus on the material of interest. Since the PDMS cell culture substrates are too thick to pattern through, use a glass slide on which the chip is placed upside-down. Since the laser encounters the glass slide first, use glass to calibrate the laser.\n\t\nApply fluorescent highlighter on a glass coverslip and place the glass coverslip in the stage of the fluorescent microscope. Ensure that the highlighted surface is facing upwards.\nSwitch on the microscope and the PRIMO equipment and open Micro-manager to access Leonardo software under 'plugins'.\nChoose Calibration in the initial menu, followed by selecting the 20x objective both on the microscope and in the software. Click on Next.\nPlace the glass slide with fluorescent highlighter in the optical path of the microscope. Switch to fluorescent mode and carefully focus on the PRIMO image that appears, making sure that both the logo and text are in focus. Click on Next to finish the calibration procedure.\nWrite down the Z-location of the stage when calibrating and use this location as a reference later in the protocol.",
    "NOTE: The calibration material should match the material that is used for patterning later in the protocol. The above steps describe the calibration needed for the cell culture substrates. For calibration of flat PDMS control samples, apply fluorescent highlighter on top of an additional flat PDMS sample and calibrate using Steps 6.1.2-6.1.5.\nPatterning 3D features using a single focal plane\n\tNOTE: Patterning using a single focal plane is done on 3D features that do not exceed the dimensions of one DMD (approximately 300 µm x 500 µm). A schematic of the focal plane setup is illustrated in Figure 3.\n\t\nRemove the calibration slide from the stage and place a glass slide containing a droplet (~50 µL) of photoinitiator (PLPP) in the stage.\n\t\tCAUTION: PLPP is irritating to the eyes, the respiratory system, and the skin (R36-38). Wear personal protective equipment, keep it away from explosive materials, never add water to this product, take precautionary measures against static discharges, and avoid shock and friction (S26-36).\nPlace the PDMS cell culture substrate upside-down in the droplet of photoinitiator. Ensure that the 3D features on the surface of the cell culture substrate face the glass slide and are fully submerged in PLPP to ensure proper patterning.\nSelect Pattern in the software.\nSwitch to brightfield mode on the microscope and move the stage to the feature of interest.\nFocus on the top or bottom of convex and concave structures respectively (Figure 3).\nSelect PRIMO to insert a pattern of choice. Observe the pattern preview in orange on top of the live brightfield image.\nAdjust the patterning settings according to the feature (location, angle, repetitions) and select a dose of 1,000 mJ/mm2.\nClick on Lock and switch the microscope to fluorescent mode.",
    "Click on the Play button on the right bottom of the screen to start the patterning. Once finished, observe the pattern displayed in green.\nOnce finished with all features on a cell culture chip, remove the chip from the patterning slide and store in PBS at 4 °C.\nPatterning 3D features using multiple focal planes\n\tNOTE: Patterning using multiple focal planes is done on 3D features that are larger than one DMD (approximately 300 µm x 500 µm) or are relatively tall. In this case, the 3D features need to be patterned in multiple steps, that is, the pattern design should be adapted according to the example in Figure 3.\n\t\nRemove the calibration slide from the stage and place a glass slide containing a droplet (~50 µL) of photoinitiator (PLPP) in the stage.\nPlace the PDMS cell culture chip upside-down in the droplet of photoinitiator using tweezers.\nSelect Pattern in the software. Switch to brightfield mode on the microscope and move the stage to the feature of interest.\nFocus on the area of the chip on the right location. Since patterning is performed in a single focal plane and the features are larger than a single DMD, use multiple focal planes and thus multiple rounds of patterning per 3D substrate to ensure sufficient pattern resolution along the complete height and width of the feature (see Figure 3). For example, for a feature with a height of 150 µm, pattern the feature in three rounds (± 1 focal plane per 50 µm of Z-travel), focusing around 25 µm, 75 µm, and 125 µm from the bottom of the feature. Make sure that the bottom of the feature is around the value written down in step 6.1.5.",
    "Select PRIMO to insert the pattern of choice. Observe the pattern preview shown in orange on top of the live brightfield image.\nAdjust the patterning settings according to the feature (location, angle) and select a dose of 1,000 mJ/mm2.\nClick on Lock and switch the microscope to fluorescent mode.\nClick on the Play button on the right bottom of the screen to start the patterning. Once finished, observe the pattern displayed in green.\nRepeat steps 6.3.4-6.3.8 on the feature of interest when multiple focal planes are used.\nOnce finished with all features on a cell culture chip, remove the chip from the patterning slide and store it in PBS at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: If desired, apply the UV-photopatterning under sterile conditions, making use of glass-bottom Petri dishes and prepare all substrates in sterile culture cabinets. Store the patterned samples in PBS for up to a couple of weeks. When washed with ddH2O and dried using pressurized air, samples can be stored up to a few months at 4 °C.\n7. Protein incubation\nNOTE: It is advised to use freshly protein-incubated substrates for cell culture. Only proceed to this part of the protocol if the cell seeding (step 8) is done directly afterwards.\nTransfer the patterned cell culture chip to sterile PDMS containers in the culture cabinet.\nWash the patterned cell culture chips 3x with an excess of sterile PBS if the patterning was not performed under sterile conditions.\nPrepare a fresh protein solution in PBS.\n\t\nFibronectin: add 2 mL of PBS using a micropipet to a vial of 20 µg of rhodamine-labeled fibronectin to obtain a concentration of 10 µg/mL. Pipet gently to avoid the formation of protein clumps and protect from light.\nGelatin: thaw a 200 µL aliquot of dissolved gelatin-fluorescein. Protect from light.",
    "Add 200-500 µL of the protein solution to the cell culture chip using a micropipet. Adjust the incubation time and temperature depending on the protein of choice: Fibronectin: 5 min at room temperature, Gelatin: 15 min at 37 °C. Make sure to cover the sample (e.g., with aluminum foil).\nRemove the protein solution and wash 5x with 500 µL of sterile PBS. Make sure to pipet the PBS up and down multiple times above all relevant features of the cell culture chip to remove any unbound protein.\n\tNOTE: During the washing steps, it is crucial that the sample never dries out. When removing the protein solution or PBS during washing, add new PBS immediately to prevent protein clumps from forming (see Figure 4). Convex features are especially sensitive to drying out as they are elevated above the substrate surface.\nOptional: review the protein patterns under a fluorescence microscope. Keep the samples sterile and immersed in PBS.\n8. Cell seeding\nNOTE: This protocol uses human primary keratocytes and human dermal fibroblasts. The keratocytes were harvested from human corneal tissue from patients, in line with Dutch guidelines for secondary use of materials, and previously characterized as keratocytes47. These cells are cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), and 1 mM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate (vitamin C) at 37 °C for a maximum of four passages. Human dermal fibroblasts were purchased and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S at 37 °C for a maximum of 15 passages. For seeding of both keratocytes and dermal fibroblasts on the photopatterned cell culture chip, 20,000 cells per chip were used.",
    "Detach the cells of interest (e.g., using trypsin) and prepare 1 mL of a cell suspension of ± 10,000-50,000 cells/mL in culture medium per chip. Adjust the exact number of cells added per substrate depending on the cell size and the desired readout.\nRemove the PBS from the cell culture chip and add 1 mL of the cell suspension.\nGently transport the cell culture chip with the cells to the incubator and incubate for 60 min at 37 °C.\nCheck the adhesion of the cells on the patterned cell culture chip under a brightfield microscope. Look for elongated cell morphologies in the case of line patterns (see Figure 5). If cells have also started adhering outside the patterned area, remove these by pipetting medium up and down directly above the cells on the substrate.\n\tNOTE: Cells attached to the patterned area will remain attached, while cells outside the patterned areas will detach.\nRemove the cell culture chip from the PDMS container and use sterile tweezers to put it in a 6-well plate filled with ~5 mL of culture medium.\nCulture the cells for the desired length of time. Replace the cell culture medium every 2-3 days. To ensure the visualization of the protein pattern after cell culture, reduce the amount of exposure of the sample to light during culture.\n9. Staining, image acquisition, and analysis\nFixation and staining\n\t\nAfter the desired length of culture, remove almost all the medium and wash three times with excess PBS. Next, incubate with 3.7% formalin for 15 min at room temperature followed by three washing steps with PBS for 5 min per wash at room temperature. Never let the sample dry out.",
    "CAUTION: Formalin is harmful if swallowed or if inhaled (H302, H332), may cause an allergic skin reaction (H317), is suspected of causing genetic defects (H341), and may cause cancer (H350). Wear personal protective equipment and work in a fume hood.\nStain the cell culture substrate with the desired staining agents or antibodies. To reduce the volumes of staining agents, place the cell culture chips upside-down in a droplet of staining solution pipeted on a glass slide.\nStore the samples in PBS (short-term) or attached to a coverslip using mounting medium (long-term) at 4 °C.\nImage acquisition\n\t\nPlace the stained sample upside down in a droplet of PBS on a glass slide. Put the sample in the stage of a confocal microscope.\nDepending on the required level of detail, make Z-stacks with a suitable objective (10x, 20x, or 40x) and Z-spacing to ensure proper image acquisition.\nImage analysis and visualization\n\t\nOpen the raw image files in image analysis software and check that the image properties (e.g., dimensions, resolution) are correct.\nAdjust the brightness and contrast per channel if needed.\nCrop the region of interest containing the pattern and cells.\nOptional: perform a deconvolution step if needed.\nCreate a 3D render of the Z-stack using 3D rendering software.\nOptimize the contrast and gain settings for each individual channel.\nTo make an image of the 3D render, create a snapshot and export as .TIFF file.\nTo create a movie of the 3D render, set the start and final frame as well as the timeframe before registering the movie. Export as .avi."
