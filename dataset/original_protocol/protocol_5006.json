    "Production of multicellular, mixed cell type spheroidsCulture MDA-MB-231 cells, HUVEC cells in EGM-2 medium and NHDF in low-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM L-glutamine in T-75 flasks to reach near confluency. Harvest MDA-MB-231 cells by trypsinization. Collect 1 x 105 cells by centrifuging at 300 x g for 5 min and resuspend them in 0.1 ml fresh growth medium (obtaining a cell concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml).Label MDA-MB-231 cells with the cell tracker dye CM-Dil or CMTPX by incubating the 0.1 ml of cell suspension with 2 μM of either of the two dyes for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark, shaking every 5 to 10 min.Note: Depending on the needs of the specific assay, you may leave the tumour cells unstained and label the non-malignant cell components using the same procedure.Harvest HUVEC and NHDF cells by trypsinisation. Collect 1 x 105 HUVEC cells and 0.5 x 105 NHDF cells by centrifuging them at 300 x g for 5 min and resuspend the cell pellets in 0.2 ml fresh growth medium (obtaining a cell concentration of 0.5 x 106 and 0.25 x 106 cells/ml, respectively). Add 150 μl of HUVEC cells (7.5 x 104 cells), 150 μl of NHDF (3.75 x 104 cells) and 75 μl of MDA-MB-231 cells (7.5 x 104 cells) into 15 ml of EGM-2 medium containing 20% methylcellulose solution (see Recipes).Add 150 μl of the above solution to each well of a 96 U-shaped well suspension plate and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C to allow for spheroid formation.Note: Figures 1A and 1B show the transmission light microscopic image of the single cell suspension in the U-shape well and the forming sphere (with still primarily round-shaped cells) 24 h after seeding the cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170102/20170102172937_3785.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Formation and morphology of mixed cell type tumour minispheres. A, B and D. Transmission light microscopic images of (A) the cell constituents of the tumour sphere immediately after seeding in U-shaped wells, (B) assembled tumour sphere after 24 h of incubation in U-shaped well, and (D) fully formed tumour sphere embedded in collagen matrix at 72 h after seeding. C. Collection of formed spheres from U-shaped wells using a 5 ml serological pipette. Note: The pipette is gently placed to the bottom of the well and the content collected. The pipette is then moved to the next well without releasing the collected medium. The medium with the tumour spheres collected in the pipette from several wells is then transferred into a 15 ml centrifuge tube (not shown). Drug efficacy testing on multicellular tumour spheroidsPrepare a 1.5 mg/ml collagen type-I stock solution by diluting rat tail collagen type-I into an appropriate volume of EGM-2 medium. Neutralize the pH to 7.0 by drop-wise addition of 1 N NaOH. Filter-sterilise the final solution using a syringe and syringe filter. Prepare this solution fresh each time.Add 100 μl of collagen stock solution to the bottom of wells of a glass-bottom 12 well dish which has been previously warmed to 37 °C in the incubator. Incubate dish at 37 °C for 30 min to allow the collagen gel to set.At the end of the 24 h incubation, gently harvest the formed spheroids from the 96 U-shaped well plate into a 15 ml centrifuge tube using a 5 ml or a 10 ml serological pipette and collect the spheroids by centrifuging the solution at 300 x g for 5 min. Note: An image of the harvesting step is shown in Figure 1C. Typically, one sphere forms per well, though it may vary for different cell types.",
    "Remove the medium, taking care not to disturb the spheroid pellet. Add 1,400 μl freshly prepared 1.5 mg/ml collagen stock solution and carefully resuspend the spheroid pellet by tapping the bottom of the tube.Add 100 μl of spheroid suspension on top of each collagen gel in the 12 well plate to generate between 5-8 spheroids per well. Place the plate in incubator at 37 °C for 1 h to allow this second collagen gel layer to set. Note: It may take a bit longer for the gel to set. Proceed with the protocol only after the gel has set, but not later than 2.5 h.Add 1.5 ml of EGM-2 medium to each well and incubate the spheroids for 24-48 h. Note: A transmission light microscopic image of the fully formed spheroid embedded in collagen is shown in Figure 1D.Treat cells with a drug/drugs of choice at appropriate concentration.2 h before analysis, add 1 μg/ml Hoechst33342 nuclear dye and SYTOX Green viability dye at a final concentration of 1 μM to the media and complete the incubation time at 37 °C (for 2 h).Analyse induction of cell death by monitoring the number of SYTOX Green positive cells both in the CM-DiI/CMTPX-labelled tumour cell population and the CM-DiI/CMTPX-negative non-malignant cellular components using confocal microscopy (e.g., Taking images in 0.5 μm Z-stack planes without fixing the spheroids beforehand)."
