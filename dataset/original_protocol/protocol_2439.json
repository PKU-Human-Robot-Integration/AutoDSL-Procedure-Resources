Lift up the skin with a pair of Graefe forceps and make an incision, along the midline, with fine scissors. Continue cutting through the skin, on either sides of the incision, to procure a C-shaped opening that is perpendicular to the midline of the mouse (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nHolding with the Graefe forceps, make additional cuts in the peritoneum. This would expose the abdominal cavity and the uterine horns can be visualized (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2073-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Place the uterine horns in a 100 mm cell culture dish containing ice-cold 1× PBS. Using extra-fine Graefe forceps and Dumont #5 straight forceps, and working under a stereo zoom microscope, gently remove the endometrial tissue around each conceptus, taking care not to puncture the placenta (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, 1C, and 1D).\nUse the Dumont #5/45 bent-tip forceps to transfer the conceptus to a fresh 60 mm cell culture dish with ice-cold 1× PBS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2073-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Clearly visible under the epidermis, it is maroon coloured and present underneath the developing fetal diaphragm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nTransfer the fetus to a new 60 mm cell culture dish with minimal level of ice cold 1× PBS, enough to keep the fetus wet. Optimal level of 1× PBS will make sure that the fetus remains securely in placed during dissection.",
    "Use the extra fine Graefe forceps and Dumont #5 straight forceps to tease away fetal tissues from the rostral and caudal ends and expose the FL from within the abdominal cavity (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F–2L, Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: Take utmost care not to damage the FL tissue while teasing away the extra abdominal tissues surrounding it. To this end, it is advisable to minimize or completely avoid direct handling of FL tissue with forceps.\nNote: After euthanizing the mice and dissection of tissues, all steps preceding fixation of tissue should be carried out quickly to minimize lysozyme mediated tissue degradation. Harvested tissues should be maintained on ice to reduce lysozyme activity.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S2. Dissecting out murine E14.5 FL, related to steps 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11\nFixation, cryo-protection and cryo-block preparation\nTiming: ∼18 h\nThis section contains detailed procedures for E14.5 FL fixation, cryo-protection and cryo-block preparation.\nUse the Dumont #5/45 bent-tip forceps to transfer the FL tissues isolated into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 1.5 mL ice-cold 4% PFA.\nCritical: Take measures to transfer the tissue without causing damage.\nNote: A tissue:fixative volume ratio of approximately 1:20 is maintained to enable efficient fixation of each FL tissue. In order to maintain this ratio, one FL is added per 2 mL microcentrifuge tube, containing 1.5 mL 4% PFA.\nPut the 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes, containing FLs, horizontally on ice and place it on a 2D rocker at 30 rpm, for 1 h of fixation.\nNote: The speed of the 2D rocker should enable sufficient mixing of PFA solution within the tube to prevent it from getting depleted at a particular end.",
    "After 1 h, remove the PFA solution completely and add 1.5 mL 1× PBS and give a quick rinse. Discard this 1.5 mL 1× PBS immediately and add 1.5 mL 1× PBS again and wash the tissues for 30 min, placing the 2 mL tubes horizontally on ice, on the 2D rocker.\nCritical: It is important to remove the fixative after 1 h to prevent over-fixation of the FL tissue. The first quick wash with 1× PBS ensures that maximum amount of fixative is removed.\nGive two more washes of 30 min each with 1× PBS, discarding 1× PBS from the previous wash and adding fresh 1× PBS each time. Add fresh 1× PBS to the tubes, at the end of three 30 min washes.\nCritical: Make sure that the pipette tip does not damage the tissue during change of fixative and wash buffer. To avoid any such incident, aspirate buffer from the diametrically opposite side of the tissue and add buffer on the wall of the microcentrifuge tube, away from the tissue.\nPause point: The E14.5 FLs, in fresh 1× PBS, can be stored at 4°C (for up to 2 months) before proceeding with further steps of the protocol.\nBefore cryo-block preparation, cryo-protect the FL tissue using 30% sucrose solution. Remove 1× PBS, add 1.5 mL 30% sucrose and place the 2 mL microcentrifuge tube on the tube revolver at 24°C–26°C for 30 min.\nNote: Sucrose will replace a part of the water molecules and prevent crystal formation during snap-freezing in the subsequent step.\nAfter 30 min, transfer the tubes to 4°C, on a stand, for overnight (∼16 h) cryo-protection.",
    "Critical: At the start of cryo-protection, the FL floats on the surface of 30% sucrose solution. FL sinking to the bottom of the tube marks the end point of cryo-protection.\nNote: Certain antibody paratopes are considerably more predisposed to a particular conformation of epitopes. In such cases, the native epitopes available within the tissues cannot be efficiently identified by the antibodies. However, treatment with alcohols (like MeOH or EtOH) might bring about sufficient changes to the native epitopes, enabling optimum recognition. For example, while performing immunohistochemistry with Lyve-1 AF488 (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), FLs would have to be fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min on ice, followed by three 30 min 1× PBS washes. At the end of the washes, the livers would have to be dehydrated with MeOH in a graded manner; 50% MeOH for 10 min and then 100% MeOH for another 10 min, followed by sucrose gradient and further steps leading to immunohistochemistry. Lyve-1 AF488 staining will not be optimal without the MeOH dehydration steps. This makes combining Lyve-1 AF488 with other antibody stainings relatively more challenging.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2073_8.csv\nNote: Usually, MeOH dehydration steps are avoided to prevent change of epitope conformation for other sensitive antigens (especially when performing HSC staining) within the tissue.\nPut together the set-up for preparation of the cryo-mold (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Take a disposable mold (15 × 15 × 5 mm), fill it up with approximately 1.5 mL PolyFreezeTM cryo-matrix and set it aside. Take a mortar and pestle and crush some dry ice. Place a stainless steel mold (24 × 24 × 10 mm), having approximately 2 mL inert 2-methyl butane, on the dry ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2073-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of E14.5 fetal liver cryo-block",
    "(A) Paraphernalia used for making cryo-block; clockwise from top: steel mold/ container, disposable plastic mold, a pair of Graefe forceps, mortar, pestle.\n(B) Fixed E14.5 FL sample immersed in PolyFreezeTM cryo-matrix within disposable cryo-mold.\n(C) Set-up for indirect flash-freezing of FL tissue.\n(D) Flash-freezing E14.5 FL sample.\nCritical: Avoid introducing bubbles by maintaining a continuous flow of the cryo-matrix while filling up the disposable mold. Bubbles that are near the specimen might cause the sections to tear during cryo-sectioning. Bubbles can be dispensed with the help of a pipette-tip.\nNote: The steel mold is placed on the dry ice to facilitate better conduction and bring down the temperature of the inert medium quickly.\nNote: Indirect snap-freezing method is used, keeping an inert medium between the dry ice and the sample, to avoid exposing the tissue to very harsh temperatures and achieve a more controlled rate of freezing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nWhile the 2-methyl butane cools down (30–45 s), gently place the cryo-protected FL in PolyFreezeTM, immersing it completely within the cryo-matrix (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nOnce the 2-methylbutane is cold, use a pair of forceps to place the mold, containing the FL, floating on top of the cold 2-methyl butane (Caution: do not submerge it). As it cools down, the cryo-matrix will start solidifying, changing from a transparent jelly to a solid white form (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nAfter the entire cryo-matrix has solidified, transfer the molds containing the cryo-blocks to −80°C for storage (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nPause point: The cryo-blocks can be stored at −80°C until the next steps in the protocol are carried out.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S3. Preparation of cryo-block and storage, related to steps 18, 19 and 20, 21\nCryo-sectioning and immunohistochemistry\nTiming: 2–4 days",
    "This section contains a step by step detailed procedure for obtaining 50 μm-thick cryo-sections of fixed E14.5 FLs and their staining by immunohistochemistry.\nKeep the mold containing the cryo-block inside the cryotome for at least 30 min before taking cryo-sections. This will help raise the temperature from −80°C to −28°C.\nCritical: Cryo-sections are taken at −28°C. Obtaining cryo-sections immediately after taking the cryo-blocks out of −80°C might lead to brittle broken sections.\nNote: The cryotome temperature has to be maintained at −28°C. The paraphernalia required for taking cryo-sections like fine brush, cryotome blade, pair of Graefe forceps, should be maintained at −28°C as well, inside the cryotome.\nTake a 24-well cell-culture plate and wrap the lid and the bottom half, separately, with aluminum foil. This plate will be used for performing immunohistochemistry and the aluminum foil would prevent light from entering the plate.\nCritical: The primary and secondary antibodies used in this protocol are fluorophore tagged. Care should be taken to allow minimum direct light exposure to preserve signals, as much as possible.\nLabel the wells where the immunohistochemistry experiments will be carried out. Fill these wells with 1.5 mL 1× PBS.\nNote: The described method is based on immuno-staining of free-floating sections of the FL tissues. While it can be applied to sections taken directly on glass slides, immunohistochemistry on free-floating sections results in more uniform staining, perhaps due to an enhanced antibody penetration. Hence, thicker sections can be labeled and imaged for better 3D characterization of the tissue. In addition, free-floating sections also allowed more effective washing, reducing background signals.\nOnce the temperature of the cryo-block has balanced with the cryotome (∼30 min), detach the cryo-block from the mold by pressing gently underneath the mold (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).",
    "Critical: Do not handle the cryo-block with hand, directly. Heat from the hand will melt the cryo-block. Use cold Graefe forceps to hold the cryo-block.\nPour approximately 1 mL PolyFreezeTM onto a chuck, kept at 24°C–26°C. Put the chuck inside the cryotome and quickly place the cryo-block on the PolyFreeze blob, sticking it to the chuck before the cryo-matrix solidifies (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nNote: Press the cryo-block down gently, on the chuck, using horizontally placed Graefe forceps. This is done to obtain a properly aligned cryo-block-chuck assembly.\nAfter the cryo-matrix between the cryo-block and the chuck has solidified completely (∼2 min), insert the chuck in the chuck holder and tighten the screws to keep the sample in position (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2073-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cryosectioning E14.5 fetal liver tissue\n(A) Set-up inside the cryotome.\n(B) Transferring FL cryo-section into a 24 well cell culture plate.\n(C) 50 μm FL section, as observed under a stereo zoom microscope; asterisk (∗) denotes ovoid/ circular shaped blood vessels. Scale bar: 2000 μm.\nSet the trimming thickness on the cryotome at 50 μm. Place the cryotome blade in the blade-holding slot and tighten the screws. Rotate the cryotome wheel handle in a clock-wise manner to start obtaining sections.\nNote: The movement of the cryotome wheel should be unidirectional (i.e., clockwise only), steady and continuous. This would ensure better quality of sections.\nNote: Initial trimming is done to get rid of the excess layers of cryo-matrix before reaching the sample.\nCritical: Use separate blades for trimming and sectioning purposes. An older blade can be used for trimming and newer one for sectioning. This ensures that the blade used for sectioning is free of dents, which would result in better sections.",
    "Switch to sectioning mode when the sample starts becoming visible through thinner layers of cryo-matrix. Set the sectioning thickness at 50 μm. Change the trimming blade to sectioning blade.\nRotate the cryotome wheel handle slowly and steadily while using a fine brush to pull out single cryo-sections from the edge of the cryotome blade (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nCritical: While pulling the cryo-sections, avoid putting the brush bristle on the tissue area of the section as it would damage the sample.\nBring the aluminum foil covered 24-well cell culture plate within the hood of the cryotome and quickly transfer the cryo-section into one of the wells, filled with 1× PBS, using a pair of Graefe forceps. This is done by carefully touching the section on the surface of 1× PBS. The cryo-matrix will immediately dissolve into the 1× PBS and the section will remain afloat (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nNote: Sections that do not remain afloat, or are partially submerged in buffer, are nicked. For preventing nicked sections, check troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Keep the section away from the wall of the well as the section would get stuck on the wall, leading to loss of tissue.\nDiscard the 1× PBS, containing dissolved PolyFreezeTM, and add 500 μL 1× PBST. This wash removes the cryo-matrix and starts permeabilizing the thick tissue.\nNote: Repeat steps 30–32 to obtain cryo-sections for all the immunolabeling experiments to be performed.\nNote: At a plane of the block where the E14.5 FL has more than one lobe, the section might split into the individual lobes after being floated in 1× PBS. This will not hamper immunolabeling. However, extra care should be taken to maintain the sections (from the different lobes) in buffer.",
    "Critical: Use 200 μL tip for changing buffers for better control of the floating tissue. Add buffers on the wall of the well to prevent agitation of the floating section.\nCritical: The tissue, at no point, should be left dry.\nAfter obtaining the requisite number of sections, observe the sections under a stereo zoom microscope.\nNote: The FL vasculature has been defined to be an important niche component for HSCs. The first few sections obtained, while cutting through a new block of E14.5 FL, are usually devoid of prominent vasculature. Prominent vasculatures appear as circular or ovoid shaped gaps within the FL tissue, when observed under a stereo zoom microscope. Presence of such structures can be confirmed during this preliminary observation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: The presence of nicked or partially brittle sections can also be detected under the stereo zoom microscope. Such sections should not be used for immunolabeling.\nUse a thin film of cryo-matrix to cover the exposed tissue in the cryo-block. This prevents tissue dehydration from the exposed end. After the PolyFreezeTM solidifies, store the remaining block on the chuck, within a labeled zip-lock bag, inside −80°C for future use.\nNote: Each time a used cryo-block is trimmed and sectioned, a part of the initial tissue is lost to obtain a leveled complete plane of the sample. To minimize this loss, the orientation of sectioning can be marked so that the angle of the blade and the angle of the used block can be aligned before re-starting the sectioning process. Also, performing experiments in batches can further help reduce this loss.\nTransfer the 24-well cell culture plate, having the floating FL sections, on ice. Place this on the 2D rocker at 15 rpm for 5 min.",
    "Note: In all the succeeding steps, other than buffer changes and additions, the sections would have to be placed on the 2D rocker to facilitate proper mixing.\nNote: Sections can remain in 1× PBST until all the sections have been procured. However, the minimum duration of 1× PBST wash is 5 min (step 32).\nOptional: At the end of 5 min, discard 1× PBST and perform biotin blocking for the sections that would require Streptavidin conjugated fluorophore (secondary antibody) addition in subsequent steps of the experiment.\nAdd 300 μL avidin to the sections and incubate at 24°C–26°C for 15 min.\nAfter 15 min, remove avidin and wash the sections with 300 μL 1× PBST for 5 min at 24°C–26°C.\nDiscard the wash buffer and add 300 μL biotin and incubate at 24°C–26°C for 15 min.\nAfter 15 min, discard biotin and wash the sections for 5 min with 300 μL 1× PBST, at 24°C–26°C.\nPrepare the optimal working concentration of primary antibody in 1× PBST. The working concentrations used for different primary antibodies have been listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Remove the wash buffer and add primary antibody to the sections and incubate for 2 h at 24°C–26°C or 16–24 h at 4°C, according to the conditions optimized for individual antibodies (refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nNote: The final volume of the working concentration for primary antibodies is 300 μL.",
    "Critical: This immunolabeling protocol involves the usage of several primary and secondary antibodies. These antibodies were selected after screening a number of commercially available products against each marker. Additionally, their working concentration as well as incubation period was optimized carefully to avoid non-specific signals (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). These products were tested thoroughly for the objective described. Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] also lists alternative reagents that have been tested, and successfully used, for optimal outcome of this method. However, changing the target cell type or incorporation of additional/alternative markers may require additional optimization of the antibodies as well as working concentration and time of incubation. Optimization would have to be performed for any new antibody used to label a new cell type of choice.\nNote: For CD31, Lyve-1 AF488 and F4/80 APC, signals are obtained 2 h post-incubation at 24°C–26°C, however, optimum results are obtained by 16–20 h incubation at 4°C. For Sca-1 FITC and Sca-1 biotin, 20–24 h incubation at 4°C is integral for securing signals.\nAfter primary antibody incubation, wash the sections with 1× PBST twice, for 5 min each, at 24°C–26°C.\nPrepare the working concentration for the secondary antibodies in 1× PBST. The working concentrations used for different secondary antibodies have been listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Remove the wash buffer and add secondary antibody to the sections and incubate for 1–2.5 h at 24°C–26°C, according to the conditions optimized for individual antibodies (refer Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: The final volume of the working concentration for secondary antibodies is 300 μL.\nAfter secondary antibody incubation, wash the sections with 1× PBST for 5 min at 24°C–26°C.\nNote: Repeat steps 36–39 for completing antibody additions for all pairs of primary and secondary antibodies of the experimental combination.",
    "Critical: Depending on the experimental combination and animal sources, primary antibodies could be added together or sequentially. Sequential addition of antibodies is performed in order to avoid cross-reactivity of antibodies or binding of secondary antibodies to multiple primary antibodies (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S4.

    "Critical: For the experiment mentioned above, anti-goat AF594 2° antibody (Add 2) is raised in donkey and anti-Armenian hamster AF647 2° antibody (Add 4) is raised in goat. To prevent anti-goat AF594 from binding to goat raised anti-Armenian hamster AF647, the former is added first in the sequential steps (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5C).\nCare should be taken to design experimental combinations and additions such that interferences and cross-reactivities stemming from animal sources can be avoided (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] presents the sequential steps that can be taken to select correct antibodies for multiple markers in a staining protocol, and avoiding cross-reactivity.\nMounting and storage\nTiming: 17 h\nIn this section, the procedure for mounting and storing 50 μm thick E14.5 FL cryo-sections, post immunohistochemistry, has been described.\nTake a frosted slide and wipe it with lint-free tissue paper. Lay it down on a black surface. The black surface will provide better contrast and help to clearly visualize the tissue section.\nUse a PAP pen to draw circular hydrophobic boundaries on the frosted slide. Two to three circles can be drawn on one slide. Take care to position the circles away from the edge of the slide (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A, Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2073-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Mounting immunostained E14.5 fetal liver section\n(A) Frosted slide showing hydrophobic boundaries and a convex aqueous surface.\n(B) Lifting FL section with a fine brush.\n(C) Transferring FL section onto the convex aqueous surface.\n(D) Addition of mounting media slightly ahead of the FL section.\n(E) Lowering cover glass on the FL section.\nNote: The inner diameter of the hydrophobic boundary should approximately be 1.5 cm.",
    "After the boundaries are completely dry, add 100–200 μL 1× PBS inside the boundary to create a convex aqueous surface where the sections can be floated (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A, Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nCritical: Adding 1× PBS while the boundary is wet would make the PAP pen ink form a film over the aqueous media. This would lead to non-specific fluorescence from the samples, during imaging.\nDiscard Hoechst (step 40) and add 2 mL 1× PBS into the sample well using a 200 μL tip. This would raise the tissue section from the bottom of the well.\nDip a wet, fine brush very carefully into the well and underneath the floating section without touching it. Once the bristles of the brush are completely immersed in 1× PBS and the section is stable on the surface, gently lift the brush out of the well such that the section layers the outer surface of the brush (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B, Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nCritical: Make sure that the brush is smooth, fine and uniform. Brushes with individual bristles sticking out would make tears in the section.\nHold the brush horizontally and gently roll the section off onto the aqueous convex surface built on the slides. Carefully remove the 1× PBS from within the hydrophobic boundary using a 200 μL tip (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nUse the pointed end of a folded lint-free tissue paper to remove the hydrophobic boundary surrounding the section. Absorb the left-over 1× PBS as well, taking care not to wipe the tissue off.",
    "After the tissue loses most of the moisture content, add a drop of Prolong Gold anti-fade mountant slightly ahead of the section. We avoid adding mounting media directly on the section because the sample might come off the slide when the nozzle of the mountant tube is raised from the surface of the slide. This is because the sections are placed on the slides after immunolabeling and are not effectively bound to the slides due to difference of charges (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D, Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nPlace a coverslip on the drop of mounting media and let it spread across the edge before lowering it gently over the sample (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E, Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nNote: After lowering the coverslip over the tissue, make sure that the mounting media spreads uniformly over the entirety of the section.\nCritical: Prevent the formation of bubbles. Bubbles that have been introduced can be removed with the help of 200 μL tip.\nCritical: Do not over-dry the sections before mounting them.\nCarefully place the mounted slides in a dark area and leave them to dry at 24°C–26°C for approximately 16 h. After overnight drying, transfer the slides to 4°C until the samples are being imaged.\nPause point: Dried slides can be maintained in 4°C for 2–3 weeks before they are imaged. After this, the signals from some of the fluorophores will start diminishing significantly.\nImaging\nTiming: 3–6 h per section\nThis section mainly describes the settings that were used for imaging immunostained E14.5 FL sections, using Zeiss LSM 880.\nPut a drop of ImmersolTM 518F over the coverslip, covering the area right above the tissue section. Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 Oil DIC M27 lens will be used for imaging the FL tissue sections.",
    "Mount the slide on the slide holder of the microscope stage. Use the UV range light from the fluorescent lamp to coarsely focus the tissue section under 10× objective magnification.\nNote: Hoechst is excitable in the UV range and we utilize this nucleus staining dye to bring our section into focus. Alternatively, in the absence of Hoechst, any photo-stable fluorophore can be used to focus the sample.\nAfter adjusting coarse focus, change the objective to Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 Oil DIC M27 lens and tune the fine focus knob until the nucleus appears clear. Move the stage in x-y plane to choose a region of interest, in this case an area having proper vasculature.\nScan the area of interest by going through all the channels and set the optimal signal strength by adjusting laser intensity and gain master. Denote the ‘start’ and ‘end’ z-steps of the total FL volume to be imaged (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nUse the following settings for imaging:\nImage size: 1024 × 1024 pixels.\nLine average: 1.\nScan direction: Unidirectional.\nDetector type: PMT.\nPinhole: 1 Airy Unit.\nz-increment (step-size): 1 μm.\nScan speed: 6 Hz.\nSet the emission capture range according to the following slider values and start imaging:\nChannels: Ex633 nm: 636 nm–758 nm.\n        Ex561 nm: 561 nm–635 nm.\n        Ex488 nm: 492 nm–560 nm.\n        Ex405 nm: 408 nm–487 nm.\nNote: Capture images from 10–15 different areas on the tissue section to ensure adequate sampling.\nNote: Alternatively, tile scanning can be done to take into account the entire area of the section and obtain complete perspective of the tissue slice. Tile scanning can be taken in combination with z-stack to acquire the entire volume of the FL tissue.\nAfter completion of imaging, name the image files appropriately and save them in the designated folder.",
    "Critical: Avoid imaging the edges of the tissue as there will be non-specific binding of antibodies, leading to non-specific fluorescence from the area."
