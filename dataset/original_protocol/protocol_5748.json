    "Fly rearingGenetic requirementsA fluorescent reporter expressed in mature follicle cells (stage 14) is required for isolating mature follicles with an intact follicle-cell layer. In our experiments, we used either R47A04-Gal4 or R44E10-Gal4 from the Janelia Gal4 collection (Pfeiffer et al., 2008) to drive the expression of a UAS-RFP reporter specifically in stage-14 follicle cells.Collect virgin females with correct genotype and age them for 5-6D at 29 °C.Supplement food with ~1 teaspoon of fresh yeast paste 2-3D before the experiment.Experimental preparationWarm Grace’s media to room temperature (~25 °C).Prepare the culture media mixture (see Recipes).Line utility boxes with aluminum foil to shield inside from the light.Add a damp paper towel to the bottom of the box to maintain moisture during the three-hour incubation.Dissection and isolation (see Figure 1)Make sure to minimize the amount of time from the start of dissection to the last step in Dissection and Isolation. Limit the entire Dissection and Isolation within one hour.Fill one well in the PYREX spot plate with ~1 ml Grace’s media (Figure 1, ‘1. Initial dissection’).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180514/20180514221823_9124.jpgFigure 1. PYREX 9-well spot plate setupUse forceps to dissect ovary pairs out of eight females in Grace’s media. Make sure not to damage ovaries and keep them intact.Tip: Gently remove ovaries from the abdomen by grabbing the oviduct/uterus region instead of directly grabbing the ovaries.Fill another well with ~1 ml Grace’s media and transfer all ovary pairs into this new well (Figure 1, ‘2. Holding ovary pairs’).See Video 1. ‘Dissection Example’Move ovary pairs (~two at a time) to a new well with ~1 ml Grace’s media (Figure 1, ‘3. Isolating follicles’).Use one of the forceps to hold the anterior end of the ovary, near the germarium. Use the other forceps to gently separate ovarioles at the posterior end of the ovary near the calyx.",
    "Next, use the other forcep to gently squeeze follicles out of the posterior end. This process is to liberate follicles from surrounding ovariole sheath. Be careful not to puncture follicles.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Dissection example Identify mature follicles according to the fluorescent reporter and make a pile of intact mature follicles using the needle.Transfer the intact mature follicles using the P20 pipette to a new well filled with ~1 ml culture media (Figure 1, ‘4. Pool of isolated, intact S14 follicles’). Coat the pipet tip with culture media first to prevent follicles from sticking to the pipet tip.Repeat Steps C4-C7 until you have enough follicles or until around ~40 min have passed since initial dissection.Remove any younger-stage follicles in the pool and double check that every follicle in the pool remains intact. Younger-stage follicles should not express the fluorescent reporter when viewed under fluorescent light but can be viewed under the bright-field light. Use the needle to pile ~25-35 intact follicles together. Transfer piled follicles in culture medium to new wells with a P20 pipette. These follicles should not be dried–they should remain in the ~20 μl culture media in which they were transferred. Repeat this step until all of selected follicles are dispensed in new wells in ‘groups’ of 25-35, or until a total of ~50 min have passed since initial dissection (Figure 1, ‘~25-35 intact S14 follicles in ~20 μl CM’).Prepare octopamine working solution (see Recipes)–1 ml per each ‘group’.Add 1 ml of octopamine working solution to each well to stimulate ex vivo rupture OR 1 ml of culture media to each well as a negative control.Put the PYREX spot plate into a foil-lined utility box (prepared in Procedure B), cover the box, and put the box into a 29 °C incubator for three hours.",
    "Image acquisitionRemove the box from the incubator after three hours.Use the needle to pile follicles toward the center of each well under a microscope. Do not overlap follicles with each other.Use Micro-Manager to capture both bright-field and fluorescent images.Modify for in situ zymographyFollow Steps C1-C10 to prepare isolated mature follicles.Prepare gelatin working solution (see Recipes)–1 ml per each ‘group’.Add 1 ml of gelatin working solution to each well to stimulate ex vivo rupture and detect gelatinase activity. A negative control should be gelatin working solution without octopamine.After three hours incubation at 29 °C, wash out gelatin working solution from each well by pipetting out the solution and replacing with fresh culture media (be careful not to remove follicles from each well).Use the needle to pile follicles toward the center of each well under the microscope. Do not overlap follicles with each other.Identify follicles with posterior enzymatic activity (exhibiting green fluorescence at the posterior end) and segregate them to one side. See Video 2 for an example of identifying follicles with posterior enzymatic activity. Use the micromanager to capture bright-field, green-fluorescent, and red-fluorescent images.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Analysis of in situ zymography assay. Open images acquired at the end of each experiment (both bright-field and fluorescent images) in ImageJ. Count the total number of follicles using the multi-point tool in the bright-field image. In this example, there are a total of 29 follicles. Then, count the total number of follicles with posterior green fluorescence in the green-fluorescent image. Before taking the image, most of the follicles identified with enzymatic activity were segregated toward the top of the image. In this example, there are a total of 12 follicles with posterior green fluorescence; therefore, 41.4% of follicles had enzymatic activity."
