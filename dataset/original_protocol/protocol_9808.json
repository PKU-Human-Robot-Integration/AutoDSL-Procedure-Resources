  "procedures": [
    "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt University Medical Center approved the protocol. The described procedures were conducted in accordance with the US National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition. The overview and the timeline of the experimental procedure are provided in Figure 1. Supplementary Table 1  describes the sheep’s sex, weight, breed, source of sheep, and other relevant information that may be helpful for reproducibility purposes.\n1. One day before surgery, preparation of the animal\nWithhold food for 24-40 h prior to the surgical procedure to decompress the animal's rumen.\nApply a 50 µg/h fentanyl patch to a sheared area on the sheep's dorsum 12 h before the procedure. Clean the area with chlorhexidine to remove lanolin oil residues prior to patch application. Cover and protect the patch with an elastic tubular dressing.\n2. Day of the surgery, pre-operative steps in the preparation room\nAdminister tiletamine/zolazepam intramuscularly (2.2-5 mg/kg) and deliver 1%-3% of isoflurane mixed with 80%-100% of oxygen via a face mask to induce anesthesia.\nPosition the sheep supine on the preparation table and secure its legs.\nIntubate with a 10 mm endotracheal tube and start mechanical ventilation under volume-control mode (tidal volume, TV = 10 mL/kg, respiratory rate, RR = 15 breaths per minute).\nShave the surgical field from the sheep's neck to its upper abdomen, as detailed below.\n\t\nShave the sheep's anterior neck to expose the skin overlying the jugular veins for central venous catheterization (see step 3.7).\nShave the anterolateral thorax bilaterally in preparation for thoracotomy (see step 4.1).",
    "Shave the left side of the torso from the chest to the back (i.e., as dorsally as the table will allow with the subject in the supine position), and from breast to rear flank caudally, in preparation for implantation of subcutaneous ports (see steps 4.12-4.15).\nInsert a 20 G angiocatheter in the auricular artery for arterial pressure monitoring and blood gas sampling.\nPlace a silicone tube with an inner diameter of 3/8\"-1/2\" for rumen decompression. The orogastric tube will remain in the rumen throughout the entire procedure.\nTransport the animal from the pre-operative prep room to the surgical suite.\n3. Day of surgery, pre-operative steps in the operating suite\nReconnect the sheep to the ventilator in the surgical suite, and continue ventilation at the same setting in step 2.3 (isoflurane 1%-3%, TV = 10 mL/kg, RR = 15 breaths per minute)\nConnect the pulse oximetry (SpO2), arterial blood pressure, temperature, end-tidal capnograph, and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors to the anesthetic monitor.\nConnect the sensors for vital signs to the animal.\n\t\nPlace the pulse oximeter on the tongue of the animal.\nPlace the temperature probe into the rectum.\nConnect 3-lead electrocardiogram probes: Place the red lead on the left rear leg, the white lead on the right front leg, and the black lead on the left anterior leg.\nConnect the three-way stopcock's male luer end to the auricular artery angiocatheter and connect the opposite female luer end to the pressure transducer for arterial line monitoring using an appropriately sized pressure tubing.\n\t\t\nAlign the transducer to the level of the operating table.\nOpen the three-way stopcock on the transducer.\nScroll the main knob of the vitals monitor to highlight the arterial blood pressure channel, and then press the knob to select the channel.\nSelect ZERO IBP to zero the transducer.",
    "Connect the male luer connection of the capnography monitor line to the female luer connection on the ventilator tube to monitor end-tidal CO2.\nSet up the IV pumps for continuous fluid administration and inotropic or vasopressor support.\n\t\nPerforate the septum on the saline bag with the IV administration set. Make sure that the IV tubing is clamped prior to perforating the bag to prevent spillage.\nAlign and fit the IV administration set tubing into the IV roller pump, and check whether the direction specified on the pump matches the direction of fluid administration.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the IV administration set is compatible with the IV pump.\nTurn on the pump and specify PRIME to remove all the air in the line.\nPosition the sheep for the operative procedure.\n\t\nFrom the supine position, rotate the sheep to a partial right lateral decubitus position.\nSecure the right front foot downward and secure the left front foot while retracting it cephalad and lateral with rope or atraumatic straps.\nPerform transthoracic echocardiography for baseline assessment of the ventricular anatomy and function. Ultrasonography is also useful to determine the optimal intercostal space that facilitates surgical access to both the main pulmonary artery and the left pulmonary artery.\nClean the surgical field free of dirt and other contaminants using soap or scrub brush. Prep the neck and the chest with chlorhexidine or betadine solution and drape the surgical field in a sterile fashion.\nUsing ultrasound guidance or anatomic landmarks, access the left or right internal jugular vein using a finder needle or angiocath. Using Seldinger technique, insert a 7-French triple-lumen central venous catheter into the internal jugular vein for intravenous access and central venous pressure monitoring.\n\t\nUse the proximal port for pressure monitoring and distal port for fluid and drug administration.",
    "Administer 20 mg/kg of cefazolin and 5 mg/kg of enrofloxacin intravenously. Repeat the dosing of cefazolin every 2-4 h during the procedure.\nAdminister a 500 mL bolus of normal saline solution to augment the preload before surgery. Begin a maintenance intravenous fluid rate of 15 mL/kg/h.\n4. Operative procedure\nPerform a muscle-sparing mini-thoracotomy (length < 8 cm) at the left fourth intercostal space to obtain mediastinal exposure. Choose mini-thoracotomy to expedite postoperative recovery.\n\t\nAfter dividing the skin, split the underlying muscle (pectoralis major) longitudinally along its fibers, which run slightly oblique to the intercostal space. Place a self-retaining retractor to spread the muscle layer and expose the chest wall.\nDivide the serratus anterior and the underlying intercostal muscle in the selected intercostal space, taking care to stay immediately cephalad to the rib.\nEnter the pleural space and then continue to fully release the intercostal muscles posteriorly toward the spine and anteromedially toward the sternum to prevent inadvertent rib fracture or dislocation at the sternum. Avoid injury to the mammary vessels medially.\nPlace the self-retaining retractors to open the rib space and the overlying soft tissue. Use a small or medium Finochietto retractor to separate the ribs and a Tuffier retractor (5 cm retractor blade) to sit perpendicular to the Finochietto within the intercostal space, which retracts the soft tissue within the intercostal space to improve exposure.\nIncise the pericardium anterior to the phrenic nerve without injuring it and create a pericardial well with 2-0 silk sutures to expose the main PA and RV. Identify the left atrial appendage within the exposure as a landmark for the level of the PA bifurcation.",
    "Assess the exposure and ensure whether the appropriate intercostal space has been entered. Ideally, the proximal PA and the left atrial appendage are readily visible directly below the incision, suggesting the optimal intercostal space has been selected to provide exposure to both the main PA and LPA.\nIf exposure is deemed inadequate to safely reach both the main PA and LPA, do not hesitate to open an additional intercostal space to accomplish all the necessary steps of the operation; however, this will not be necessary with appropriate incision selection.\nDissect around the main PA and isolate it with an umbilical tape. Ensure adequate posterior dissection for the eventual occluder placement and PA flow probe as distal as possible on the main PA.\n\t\nPlace a sterile flow probe into a bowl of water or saline on the sterile field to calibrate the data acquisition software. Handoff the electrical plug on the other end to a non-sterile designee to connect the probe to the meter.\n\t\t\nRefer to the supplementary documents for details of connecting and calibrating PA flow probe and meter.\nApply a generous amount of sterile ultrasound gel in the groove of the PA flow probe.\nFit the silicone liner into the groove of the PA flow probe and apply an additional layer of ultrasound gel onto the liner.\nPlace the PA flow probe onto the PA and acquire PA flow readings on the flow meter and the data acquisition interface.\n\t\t\nPlacement of the PA flow probe may cause partial occlusion of the PA that can decrease left ventricular preload and mean arterial pressure. Pay careful attention to the hemodynamics during PA flow acquisition.",
    "Check on the flow meter screen to ensure that the PA flow signal strength is 5 bars. If the meter displays fewer than 5 bars, ensure adequate contact between the flow probe and the main PA. Apply additional ultrasound gel if needed.\nComplete intra-pericardial dissection of LPA and encircle it with an umbilical tape.\n\t\nUse a small sponge stick or thin malleable retractor for caudal retraction of the left atrial appendage.\n\t\tNOTE: Exposure to the LPA is facilitated by caudal retraction of the left atrial appendage, cephalad retraction of the main PA, and lateral retraction of the pericardium just anterior to where the LPA exits the pericardium.\nPlace a heavy-duty silicone vascular occluder around the main PA (Figure 2A,B, circle). Occluder size can be adjusted based on PA diameter; ensure the fit is snug. Use a 0 silk suture on a Keith needle to secure the ends of the vascular occluder together with a U stitch. Once secured around the main PA, slide the occluder distally along the main PA.\nEncircle the proximal main PA with a ½\" Penrose drain to facilitate dissection and reserve space to place a flow probe at subsequent re-operative surgery. Trim the Penrose drain to fit loosely around the PA and secure the Penrose to itself with a running 4-0 Prolene suture (Figure 2B).\nEstablish an RV pressure line for monitoring of RV pressures (Figure 2B, white arrow).\n\t\nSelect a location for the RV pressure line in the RV outflow tract-free wall. Place a 5-0 monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene purse-string suture with pledgets surrounding the selected location and seat a vascular snare. Make the pledgets from a sterile surgical glove.",
    "Prepare the RV pressure line: cut off the male end of sterile 36'' pressure tubing at a 30° angle to facilitate insertion through the myocardium. Use a 2-0 silk tie to mark the pressure line at an optimal depth for placement within the RV.\nUsing an 11-blade scalpel, make a small cardiotomy in the RVOT free wall within the previously placed purse-string suture. Control bleeding with manual pressure or by tightening the snare on the purse-string suture.\n\t\tNOTE: Obtain a baseline biopsy of the RV free wall at this step by sampling RV tissue within the purse-string suture. This biopsy site can then serve as the entry point for the RV pressure line.\nInsert and secure the cut end of the pressure tubing into the RV outflow tract (RVOT). Tie down the purse-string and then secure the purse-string to the pressure tubing to secure the pressure line.\nExtend the RVOT tubing by connecting an additional pressure tubing to the RVOT pressure line.\nHand off the additional pressure tubing to a non-sterile designee to connect the tubing to a pressure transducer and monitor for the measurement of the baseline RV pressure. Set up the pressure transducer as follows.\n\t\nConnect IV administration set's male luer end to transducer's female luer end.\nConnect pressure tubing's female luer end to transducer's male luer end.\nSpike the IV administration set into a heparinized saline bag (2 IU/mL).\nFit the saline bag into a pressure bag and pump the pressure bag to 250-300 mmHg as indicated on the gauge.\nFully prime the line by releasing the valve on the transducer, ensuring proper de-airing.\nFollow Supplementary Methods for transducer calibration.",
    "After carefully dissecting around the LPA, encircle it with an umbilical tape. Ligate the LPA by tying down the umbilical tape. Note the animal's hemodynamic response to ligation if relevant to the study. Increase the minute ventilation to compensate for the increased dead-space ventilation created upon LPA ligation. These ventilator adjustments mitigate respiratory acidosis.\nSlowly inject up to 3 mL of saline into the main PA occluder to ensure there is no leakage while monitoring RV pressure from the RVOT pressure line. Once the RV response is confirmed, withdraw the instilled saline.\nBring the RVOT pressure line and PA occluder tubing out of the chest one intercostal space below the thoracotomy incision.\nForm two subdermal pockets along the fascial layer on the left dorsum of the sheep as far posteriorly toward the spine as feasible within the sterile field. These serve as the sites for indwelling ports (Figure 2C).\nUsing a chest tube puller, tunnel the RVOT pressure line and occluder tubing from the chest incision out to the left dorsum port sites.\nSecure both the occluder tubing and RV pressure line to the port's barb connections. Anchor the occluder and pressure tubing around the port connectors with additional ties. Use the provided barbed connector fitting to protect the connection (Figure 1C). Seat the ports within the pre-formed subdermal pockets.\nAnchor the ports in three locations around its rim to the underlying fascia with 3-0 polypropylene sutures to prevent port migration. Reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue, dermis, and skin in layers with polyglactin 910 sutures. Reconfirm the pressure readings through percutaneous access of the ports. Flush the RVOT port with 5 mL (1000 IU/mL, 5000 units) of heparin sodium.",
    "Place a 16-French chest tube in the left pleural cavity through a separate incision, secure it to the skin, and then connect to a closed chest tube drainage unit at a pressure of -20 cm·H2O. Place an untied U-stitch around the tube to facilitate closure after chest tube removal.\nAdminister an intercostal nerve block (0.5-1 mg/kg bupivacaine) for postoperative analgesia.\nClose the thoracotomy with figure-of-eight, #2 polyglactin 910 sutures. Close the pectoralis muscle layer with running #0 polyglactin 910. Close the subcutaneous tissue in layers of running #2-0 polyglactin 910 sutures and staple the skin.\nReposition the animal to dorsal recumbency, remove the orogastric tube, and then discontinue isoflurane.\nContinue mechanical ventilation and supportive care until arterial blood pH > 7.35 and pCO2 < 55 mmHg.\nExtubate once the animal is breathing spontaneously, lifting its head, and chewing on the endotracheal tube. Remove the chest tube prior to full anesthetic recovery. Tie the U-stitch to close the chest tube incision.\nTransfer the animal to its cage while monitoring its anesthesia recovery. Ensure supplemental oxygen (3-5 L/min by facemask) is available at all times while the sheep remains immobile. Monitor vital signs every hour for the first 4 h, every 8 h for the next 24 h, and once daily after that.\n5. Postoperative recovery\nMonitor the thoracotomy and port implantation sites daily for signs of infection. Administer long-acting antibiotic (ceftiofur, 5 mg/kg intramuscularly) within 24 h after the procedure and every 3-4 days after that for 1 week.\nContinue the fentanyl patch postoperatively for a total of 72 h. After that, provide additional analgesia (e.g., meloxicam, 1 mg/kg once daily intramuscularly) if the animal continues to show signs of pain (i.e., teeth grinding, elevated heart rate).",
    "Remove the external sutures and skin staples 10-14 days after the surgery or as recommended by veterinary staff.\nEnsure port site protection from the animal rubbing or scraping the port sites against surrounding structures using a tubular dressing (Figure 2D).\n6. Chronic PA banding (9 - 10 weeks)\nTransfer the sheep to a small enclosure. Shear off the excess wool around the implanted ports.\nClean the shaved areas with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Apply topical lidocaine spray for local anesthetic.\nPrepare two pressure transducers for monitoring RV and occluder cuff pressures (Figure 3A).\n\t\nFor both transducers: Connect the female luer end of pressure tubing (36 in or longer) to the male luer end of the transducer. Connect the male luer end of the pressure tubing to one of the female luer connections on a three-way stopcock. Finally, connect a 22 G Huber needle to the male luer end of that three-way stopcock.\nFor RV pressure transducer: Hang a heparinized saline bag (2 IU/mL), puncture the bag with the IV administration set, and connect the IV administration set's male luer connection to the female luer connection of the RV pressure transducer. Then, pressurize the saline bag (e.g., pressure bag).\nFor the occluder transducer: Prime the transducer and the pressure tubing fully. Put a male luer cap on the female luer end of the pressure transducer to prevent the cuff fluid from leaking out back to the transducer.\nConnect both the transducers to the data acquisition hardware using an appropriate cable or adapter.\nCalibrate the transducers as specified in Supplementary File 1.\nClick on Start on the top right of the software window to start recording the data acquisition software to capture RV and PA cuff pressure waveforms at 400 Hz.",
    "Have an assistant provide mild restraint of the animal prior to port access. Insert Huber needle from the RV pressure transducer to the RV port. Attach a 10 mL syringe to the three-way stopcock and attempt to draw blood back into the syringe from the RV port (Figure 3B).\n\t\nIf it is difficult to pull back on the syringe, first inject 5-10 mL saline into the RV port to dislodge the source of occlusion.\nIf clogging persists, instill 2 mg of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) into the port as fibrinolytic agent and leave it overnight. Check the following day to aspirate the tPA.\nOnce the RV pressure line is established, connect the Huber needle from the PA cuff transducer.\nCapture the starting values of RV and PA cuff pressures (Figure 3C). Note any drastic changes from previous readings.\n\t\nIf PA cuff and/or RV pressure dropped substantially from the previous reading, it may be a sign that the PA cuff is leaking.\nObserve another obvious sign of PA cuff leak by studying the PA cuff waveform. If the average PA cuff pressure drops at a discernible rate, then there is a high chance that the cuff is leaking.\n\t\tNOTE: Re-check that all the luer connections on the pressure transducer, tubing, and stopcock are tightened. The highly pressurized fluid content from the PA cuff can flow back and leak out of loose luer connections.\n\t\t\nIf the PA cuff is leaking, determine the extent of leakage. If the leakage rate is slow, then a more frequent banding strategy can overcome the leakage to make the disease model still effective.\nSlowly inject 3% hypertonic saline into the occluder port while paying attention to RV and cuff pressures.",
    "Adjust the amount of injection based on desired PH disease severity and RV phenotype. A weekly increase of cuff pressure by 100-150 mmHg is a reasonable target to develop an adaptive compensating RV phenotype.\nMore rapid increases in cuff pressure (>250 mmHg per week) will likely produce a decompensating RV phenotype.\nOnce the PA cuff is inflated to the desired amount, remove the Huber needle from the cuff port.\nObtain a blood sample from the RV port.\n\t\nAspirate 10 mL of blood out of the RV port in a sterile fashion and set aside.\nPlace a new syringe in place of the aspiration syringe and aspirate as much blood as needed without going over the weekly blood draw limit of 7.5% of the total blood volume.\nReconnect the original syringe with aspirated blood and return it through the RV port.\nPull on the valve lever of the pressure transducer to flush heparinized saline from the saline bag into the RV port. Continue flushing until the entire line becomes clear and colorless.\nFlush the RV port with 10 mL of saline. Then, further flush the port with 5 mL of 1000 U/mL of heparin sodium.\nRepeat the steps 6.1-6.12 every 1-4 days for 9-10 weeks.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
