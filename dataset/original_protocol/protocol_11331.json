    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Northwestern University.\n1. Induction of tumors with BBN\nObtain male C57/BL6 mice, each at least 6 weeks old.\n\tNOTE: Male mice develop bladder cancer more quickly and consistently than female mice14,15.\nAdd N-nitrosobutyl(4-hydroxybutyl) amine (BBN) at a dose of 0.05% to the drinking water. Store it in an opaque container and provide it ad libitum as drinking water to mice16.\n\tNOTE: Storing the BBN solution in a clear container will degrade the carcinogen17.\nChange the 0.05% BBN water twice per week.\nMonitor the animals by inspecting for signs of distress associated with bladder tumors including hematuria, firm bladder, and masses. Inspect the mice twice per week or in accordance with local IACUC guidelines.\nExpect the tumors to develop between 16 and 24 weeks of exposure18.\n2. MRI setup\nPerform a subcutaneous injection of sterile saline (0.1–0.2 mL using a 25–27 G needle and 1 mL syringe) 10 min prior to MRI to facilitate bladder filling.\nAnesthetize each mouse with a gas mixture of 100% O2 and isoflurane (2%–4% as necessary). Verify an adequate plane of anesthesia by testing the withdrawal reflex (toe pinch) before proceeding. Apply sterile eye ointment to the animal. \nTransfer the mouse to the imaging holder outfitted with a nosecone for delivery of inhaled isoflurane (0.5%–3%).\nMonitor body temperature and respiration using a rectal temperature probe connected to the physiological recording computer.",
    "NOTE: Normal body temperature (36–37 °C) is maintained using the recirculating hot water circuit built into the animal MR holder. Temperature is measured through a rectal sensor and recorded on the physiological monitoring computer using dedicated physiological monitoring software. The same system is used to record the respiration and electrocardiogram signals measured through a pneumatic pillow placed under the rib cage and via 3-lead electrocardiogram electrodes. The respiration signal is also used for triggering MRI acquisition and reducing artifacts associated with respiration motion.\n3. MRI image acquisition\nUtilize a quadrature body coil for excitation.\nPlace a 4-channel receiver coil on the lower abdomen of the mouse being scanned to enable optimized detection of signals from the region of interest.\nInitiate automatic adjustments through the integrated imaging software to acquire a tri-axial set of images of the whole mouse body. From this reference set of images, identify the region of interest (in this case, the bladder region).\nAcquire three sets of orthogonal-sliced images along the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using radiological frames of reference.\nUtilize the true FISP imaging sequence (included as one of the features in the integrated imaging software) with the following MR parameters: TR = 900 msec, TE = 2 ms, FA = 70, 14 averages.\n\tNOTE: This set of parameters allows for rapid imaging with high diagnostic quality, including T1/T2 weighting in <10 min per mouse.\nSpatial resolution and slice thickness are determined by geometric parameters selected by the user through the graphical interface of the integrated imaging platform. This results in a series of slices across the whole bladder of 0.5 mm thickness with an in-plane resolution of 0.148 mm.\n4. MR image analysis\nIdentify the set of slices of 0.5 mm thickness and in-plane resolution of 0.148 mm covering the whole bladder.",
    "Export to the medical image analysis software by selecting the folder with corresponding images in ANALYZE format.\nSelect “representative axial view” at the center of the bladder for quantitative analysis by scrolling through the generated images and identifying a slice at the midpoint of the bladder, which allows for visualization of the bladder wall and lumen.\n\tNOTE: The center slice should be the chosen one with the largest diameter.\nCarefully delineate the region of interest (ROI) by manually tracing the boundaries around the outer edge of the bladder (BLAout) and around the inner lumen (BLAin) of the bladder (see schematic and representative figures in Figure 2) in the selected representative axial view.\nSubtract the inner lumen from the outer edge to calculate the surface area of the bladder wall.\n\tBLAwall = BLAout - BLAin\n\tNOTE: The surface area of a control bladder with no tumor is expected to be less than that with a bladder tumor.\n5. Euthanasia and dissection of bladder\nAfter 20 weeks of BBN exposure, euthanize the mice using standard operating procedures in accordance with local IACUC guidelines.\nClean the area of incision with 70% ethanol, then grasp and lift the abdominal wall skin with forceps.\nMake a midline incision from the pubic symphysis to the xiphoid process.\nSharply incise the peritoneal cavity by grasping with forceps and incising with scissors.\nIdentify the bladder, which is located in the midline lower abdomen.\nIdentify and cut the median umbilical ligament connecting the dome of the bladder to the umbilicus and abdominal wall.\nGrasp the dome of the bladder with forceps to provide countertraction and dissect the bladder away from surrounding structures, including the seminal vesicles, rectum, and fat.\nIdentify the ureters entering the bladder and cut with scissors close to the bladder.",
    "Lifting the bladder cephalad, cut the urethra with scissors and remove the bladder.\nImmediately weigh the bladder after rinsing it with PBS.\n6. Histologic examination of bladder tissue\nFix the bladder tissue in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 36–48 h at room temperature (RT).\nEmbed the tissue in paraffin blocks, cut the slides for subsequent examination, and stain the slides with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic examination as described previously19,20.\nPerform a microscopic examination of the mouse bladder at low (2.5x and 10x) and high (20x and 40x) magnifications, examining for macroscopic lesions, hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ, papillomas, papillary tumors, and invasive neoplasms19,21.\nSubscription Required.
