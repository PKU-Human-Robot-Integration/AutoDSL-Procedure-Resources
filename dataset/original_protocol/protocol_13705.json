    "All steps in this protocol comply with the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) animals use guidelines and have been approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Animal model\nObtain mice from commercial sources.\n\t​NOTE: C57BL/6J (age = 18 months; n = 22 (7 males, 15 females)) (Table of Materials) and Pkd1(RC/RC) (age = 18 months; n = 9 (3 males, 6 females))4 were used for the study.\n2. Hair removal\nAnesthetize the animal using vaporized isoflurane (2%-3%) in an anesthesia chamber. Ensure that the animal is sufficiently anesthetized by performing a toe pinch. Ensure that the mouse is breathing at a rate of approximately 60-90 breaths/min without obvious air gulping.\n\tNOTE: Vaporized isoflurane was chosen due to the ability to control and fine-tune the animal's level of anesthesia. Isoflurane mixed with 100% oxygen was utilized.\nUse an electric razor to shave the desired skin area for US measurements.\n\tNOTE: In this study, the focus is on kidney and cardiac measurements, so the animal's chest and back were shaved.\nApply the depilatory cream to the animal's shaved skin with a cotton-tipped applicator. Wipe the cream off after 30-60 s using a dry paper towel. Then, continue to wipe away depilatory cream residue using wet gauze pads. Ensure the hair removal is complete prior to beginning scans.\n\t​NOTE: Any remaining hair will interfere with the image quality; complete hair removal is crucial. However, it is necessary to wipe the depilatory cream off within a minute to prevent injuring the animal's skin. Leftover depilatory cream on the animal can stain the imaging membrane of the US machine. Ensure proper cleaning of the animal using wet gauze pads.\n3. Animal positioning",
    "Turn on the US machine and the switch for the internal heating element for the US bays. Turn on the appropriate anesthesia valves for the corresponding US bays that will be used.\n\tNOTE: The US machine must be turned on prior to starting the imaging US software.\nFill the bays with enough water to cover the membrane. Place the anesthetized animal in the nose cone.\n\t\nFor cardiac measurements, place the animal in a prone position and angle it approximately 30° to the right.\nFor kidney measurements, place the animal in a straight and supine position. Gently flatten the animal's body to minimize the air pockets between the animal and the membrane (Figure 1B).\n\t\tNOTE: Running a finger alongside the animal's body can remove any air bubbles adhering to the skin, which will interfere with imaging. Use water or US saline gel as US medium; but water facilitates the rapid imaging discussed here.\n4. Ultrasound measurements\nIn the imaging US software, select US Acquisition and allow the instrument to initialize.\nKidney Imaging using B-mode.\n\t\nEnter a name for the study in the appropriate dialog box.\nEnter the animal ID in the appropriate dialog box.\n\t\t​NOTE: Up to three animals can be imaged sequentially.\nClick on the tab labeled 3D to initialize 3D scanning.\nUsing the live camera feed, move the region of interest (ROI) box to contain the kidneys.\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the ROI may be adjusted depending on the size of the image target. Increasing the size of the ROI will slightly increase the scan time (Figure 1C). Depending on ROI size, the scanner will automatically adjust the number of passes required for the transducer to scan the entire ROI.",
    "Depending on the type of image desired, select Linear Array or Wobbler, to choose the transducer. Select from Fast Scan or Optimized for either transducer.\n\t\tNOTE: Linear array is faster and usually provides adequate imaging. The wobbler transducer can be utilized if unable to acquire the desired image quality with the linear array. The wobbler transducer utilizes a higher frequency wavelength and therefore provides more definition in images. The Fast Scan option acquires medium quality images with no breathing correction at a higher speed. While the Optimized option requires slightly more time, it provides better image quality and allows for breathing correction. This manuscript will focus on using the Optimized linear array preset.\nClick on the Live View to see a live image of the desired viewing area.\nTo move the transducer, click on the circular Go To button, and then click on the area of the mouse to be imaged. Use the directional arrows with predetermined step sizes to finely adjust the transducer position.\nClick on the arrow at the side of the Control Panel window to open the Settings Tray. Click on Scan Protocol to open scanning settings.\nDetermine the ideal focal depth and adjust the sliders for the TGC (time gain compensation) to change the image contrast to best view the kidneys. After achieving the desired settings, click on the arrow again to close the Settings Tray.\nPress the Acquire Static button to commence 3D scanning.\n\t\tNOTE: Progress of the scan is indicated via a progress bar in the bottom left of the software.",
    "Once the scanning is complete, check the image quality by clicking on the blue download arrow to open the scan in Preview Mode. Move through the 3D frames of the scan by dragging the red arrow at the top of the window. To zoom in or out, hold the Ctrl key and use the scroll button on the mouse.\nTo scan additional animals, refresh the animal ID dialog boxes, input the new IDs, and then repeat the above steps.\n\t\tNOTE: When the scans are complete, dry the animals off and return them to their home cages.\nCardiac imaging using M mode.\n\tNOTE: M-mode is the display of an ultrasound wave along a specific, chosen ultrasound line.\n\t\nClick on the M Mode tab to activate cardiac imaging.\n\t\t​NOTE: Only one animal can be imaged at a time.\nEnsure that the animal is in the appropriate position for cardiac scans (step 2.2). Move the ROI to the approximate location of the heart.\nPush the Heart Finder button to locate the heart. Use the heat map to optimize the location of the transducer. Use the circular Go To button to move the transducer to the left ventricle (Figure 2A).\nGo to the Live View and use the arrow buttons to place the transducer between the papillary muscles (Figure 2B). To verify the proper placement of the transducer, view the live M Mode trace (Figure 2D).\nOnce the transducer is in the appropriate position, click on Acquire Sequence. Click on the blue download arrow to view the completed scan.\n5. Kidney analysis (mechanics of analysis)\nOpen the Image Analysis tab and select the Load Volume(s) button to input the image files/folders.\n\t\nSegmentation\n\t\t\nMove the colored lines representing various planes to find the kidney in all the planes.",
    "Click on Add to add a new segmentation. Provide a markup name for the file.\nUse the Surface Cut button to add points around the outer edge of the kidney in multiple planes. Click on Apply to generate segmentation through the entire kidney (Figure 3A).\nScroll through the different frames in each plane and edit any inaccurate regions by clicking on Edit and dragging the points to the correct location.\nAlternatively, if the kidney is irregular in shape, use the Draw function to create an irregularly shaped trace around the kidney. Either click points around the edge or hold the left click to draw the trace freehand.\nTo complete the trace with the Draw button, right-click with the mouse. Scroll ahead multiple frames and repeat the tracing process.\nRepeat until the frames are traced throughout the entire region of interest.\nIf the Draw function is used, select Fill Between Slices to check and adjust the trace. Click on Initialize to see a preview. If the preview is acceptable, click on Apply. If not, click on Cancel and modify the tracings.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The Erase button will allow deletion of a region within a trace. The Smooth button smooths the jagged edges of a trace.\nWhen image analysis is satisfactory, select Save to save the analysis to the original image file.\nMeasurement\n\t\t\nUse the Calipers function to measure features within the image. Click on the Calipers button and left click the two points of the distance to be measured (Figure 3B).\nSave the measurement by clicking the disk button at the top of the screen.\n6. Cardiac analysis\nSelect Load Volumes to input the file(s) to analyze.\nSelect the Add option.",
    "Use the Point Placement tool to trace the systole and diastole for each layer of heart tissue. Continue with the other layers of heart tissue. Use the Edit function to modify the traces (Figure 2C,D).\n\tNOTE: If the M-mode trace is very clear, use the Add (auto) button to automatically generate tracings of each layer.\nSelect Apply to calculate the cardiac parameters. View the Quantify tab and select Export Statistics to export all data as a *.csv file (Figure 2E)."
