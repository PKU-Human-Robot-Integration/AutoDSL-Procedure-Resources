    "NOTE: All zebrafish studies and maintenance of the animals were done in accord with Mayo Clinic Institute IACUC-approved protocol # A41213.\n1. DNA Constructs for Transgenesis\nAmplify a 5.2-kb dopamine beta hydroxylase (dβh) promoter region8 using the CH211-270H11 BAC clone (from BACPAC resources center (BPRC)) as a DNA template. Use a PCR system appropriate for long and accurate PCR amplification of long DNA templates and the following cycle programs for PCR: 94 °C for 2 min, 10 cycles of (94 °C, 15 sec, 50 °C, 30 sec, 68 °C, 8 min), followed by 30 cycles of (94 °C, 15 sec, 53 °C, 30 sec, 68 °C, 8 min), 68 °C, 4 min (forward primer 5’-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGGCGTACTCCCCCTTTTTAGG-3’ and reverse primer 5’- GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTGTTGCTTTGTCGTCTTTTGA-3’).\nCreate the dβh-pDONRP4-P1R entry clone 8 using commercial recombinant cloning system such as multisite gateway. Mix 1 μl of purified dβh PCR product (172 ng/μl), 1 μl (150 ng/μl) pDONRP4-P1R donor vector (together with other gateway vectors are generous gifts from Dr. Chi-Bin Chien, Univ. of Utah), 4 μl of TE buffer (pH 8.0) with 2 µl of BP clonase enzyme mix, incubate for 1 hr at 25 °C and then transform to One Shot TOP10 competent E. coli according to the manufacturer's protocol.",
    "Generate the dβh:EGFP-MYCN transgenic construct 8 using recombinant cloning system mentioned in step 1.2. Mix 1 μl of each entry clone (150 ng/μl ) including a 5.2-kb dβh promoter (dβh-pDONR P4-P1R construct), EGFP lacking a stop codon (pME-EGFP construct), and human MYCN cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. Hogarty at the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania, MYCN-pDONRP2R-P3 construct), 1 μl (150 ng/μl ) of the modified destination vector containing I-SceI recognition sites (a generous gift from Dr. C. Grabher, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany), 4 μl of TE buffer (pH 8.0) with 2 µl of LR Clonase enzyme mix, incubate for 1 hr at 25 °C and then transform to chemically competent E. coli such as One shot top 10 and follow the manufacturer's protocol.\nMake mitf:mitf transgenic construct 8 by digesting the PNP-mitf vector (a generous gift from Dr. D. Raible, Univ. of Washington) with NotI and SalI restriction enzymes for 2 h at RT, and by subcloning the released 2.65-kb DNA fragment that contains the mitf promoter and the coding sequence of the zebrafish mitf gene into the NotI and MluI sites of a modified pBluescript vector containing flanking I-SceI recognition sites (a generous gift from Dr. Hui Feng, Boston University), using T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer’s protocol.",
    "NOTE: To increase the efficiency of generating stable MYCN-expressing lines, dβh:EGFP-MYCN and the mitf:mitf DNA constructs are coinjected into one-cell stage nacre embryos. Nacre designates a type of mutant fish lacking a neural crest-derived melanophore during development 36. Thus, the appearance of pigment cells in the injected embryos suggests the integration of mitf:mitf DNA constructs into the genome. It has been demonstrated that two or three coinjected DNA constructs can be cointegrated into the fish genome 31. Thus, pigmentation caused by mitf expression can serve as a marker for the integration of the dβh:EGFP-MYCN transgene and for easier identification of MYCN stable transgenic line.\nMix the dβh:EGFP-MYCN  and mitf:mitf DNA constructs at a 3:1 ratio in a total volume of a 15 μl reaction with 1 μl of I-SceI enzyme and 0.75 μl of buffer. Ensure that the total amount of DNA in the reaction does not exceed 750 ng.\nCarry out the I-SceI digestion at RT for 4 hr or O/N. On the second day, the I-SceI-digested DNAs are ready for microinjection or can be stored at -20 °C for injection in the future. Store the I-SceI enzyme at -80 °C in small aliquots to maintain its enzyme efficiency.\nSubclone the human ALKF1174L and wild-type ALK gene from the PCDNA3 vector (a generous gift from Dr. George at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) 7 into EcoRI and NotI sites of a pENTRY1A vector (a generous gift from Dr. C. Grabher, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany) using T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer’s protocol.",
    "Generate the dβh:ALKF1174L or dβh:ALKWT transgenic constructs using the recombinant system as mentioned in Protocol 1.2. Briefly, combine three entry clones, dβh-pDONRP4-P1R, ALKF1174L-pENTRY1A (or ALKWT-pENTRY1A) and p3E-polyA, into the modified destination vector containing I-SceI recognition sites (a generous gift from Dr. C. Grabher, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany), using LR Clonase enzyme Mix, according to manufacturer's protocol.\nMix the dβh: ALKF1174L (or dβh:ALKWT) and dβh:mCherry DNA constructs at a 3:1 ratio and linearize them with I-SceI enzyme as described in PROTOCOL 1.5-1.6.\n2. Microinjection\nUse glass micropipettes with 1.0 mm diameter for all injections 37. Break off the tip of the glass micropipettes with a razor blade before injection. Calibrate the injection volume by injecting H2O into a drop of mineral oil. Measure the diameter of the resulting droplets and adjust the microinjector (pressure or duration of pressure pulse) to ensure that the injection volume is less than 10% of the total cell volume of one cell-stage embryos.\nAdd an additional 0.5 μl of fresh I-SceI enzyme (5 unit/μl) in 5 μl of injection solution containing DNA constructs right before the injection to increase the efficiency of transgenesis 38. Inject 50-80 pg of linearized DNA constructs into the cytoplasm of one-cell stage embryos. To ensure the success of injection, mix the sample with 0.25% phenol red for visualization. If cells turn red after injection, it indicates the microinjection is successful. To ensure a high success rate for generating transgenic fish, we typically inject as many as 500 embryos.\nTo generate transgenic fish stably expressing MYCN, coinject the linearized dβh:EGFP-MYCN and mitf:mitf DNA constructs (at a 3:1 ratio) into embryos of the pigmentation mutant nacre zebrafish at the one-cell stage. The expression of Mitf serves as a reporter for the integration of transgenic constructs in the fish genome.",
    "For mosaic overexpression of ALK in the wild-type or MYCN transgenic embryos, co-inject the linearized dβh:ALK F1174L (or dβh:ALKWT) with dβh:mCherry DNA constructs (at a 3:1 ratio) into the one-cell embryos resulting from breeding of F1 heterozygous Tg(dβh:EGFP-MYCN) transgenic fish with wild-type AB fish. Thus, half of offspring are transgenic for MCYN and half are wild-type.\n3. Screen for Stable or Mosaic Transgenic Fish\nTo increase the efficiency of identification of stable MYCN-expressing lines, anesthetize primarily injected nacre embryos with tricaine (0.02%) at days 3-5 of postfertilization and screen for pigmentation. Transfer the embryos with pigmentation to a new petri dish with fresh egg water and raise them to sexual maturity for further screening for the founder fish, which carry the dβh:EGFP-MYCN transgene in the germ cells.",
    "To identify the founder with germline transmission of EGFP-MYCN, outcross pigmented F0 adult fish with wild-type AB fish and screen for EGFP-positive embryos at 1-2 days post fertilization for further genotyping. Place a single EGFP-positive F1 embryo into a PCR tube and remove all liquid. Add 50 μl of gDNA extraction buffer which contains 12.5 μl of 4x lysis buffer, 35 μl H2O and 2.5 μl proteinase K (10 mg/ml) to single embryo. Incubate the reaction for 2-3 hr at 55 °C, followed by 10 min of incubation at 98ºC to inactivate proteinase K. To make 50 ml of 4x lysis buffer, add 500 μl of 1M Tris (pH 8.4), 2.5 ml of 1M KCl to 47 ml of H2O. NOTE: After F0 MYCN stable transgenic fish are bred with wild-type AB fish, all of the offspring are pigmented. Thus, pigmentation cannot serve as marker for the identification of MYCN-positive fish. While in the MYCN transgenic fish, the EGFP-MYCN fusion protein is expressed in the PSNS, including the sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglia and sequential segmental ganglion of the sympathetic chain and the non-PSNS dopaminergic neurons, such as the medulla oblongata and cranial ganglia 8. Thus, the expression of EGFP can serve as a marker for identification of the MYCN stable transgenic embryos.",
    "Use 2 μl of gDNA extracted from the pigmented F1 embryo as template, primers MYCN-test F1: 5’-CTG CTT GAG AAC GAG CTG TG-3’; MYCN-R3: 5’-AGG CAT CGT TTG AGG ATC AG-3’, and the following program with the GC-RICH PCR System: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec, 58 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 3 min. We typically genotype 14-16 pigmented embryos from a single mating to confirm the presence of integrated MYCN transgene in the pigmented embryos, more than 6 founder fish overexpressing mitf and MYCN were identified by this method.\nRaise up the remainder of the EGFP-positive F1 embryos. Fin clip and genotype them at 2-3 month of age using the above protocol to further confirm the integration of MYCN transgene into the fish. Breed F1 MYCN stable transgenic fish with wild-type AB fish. Co-inject the linearized dβh:ALK F1174L (or dβh:ALKWT) with dβh:mCherry DNA constructs into the one-cell embryos as described in PROTOCOL 2.4.\nSort the MYCN-expressing embryos in the experiment described in PROTOCOL 2.4 using a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope and screen the primarily injected embryos at days 1-3 of postfertilization for the expression of EGFP-MYCN in the PSNS. Then, during days 2-5 of postfertilization, anesthetize the embryos with tricaine (0.02%) and sort those MYCN-positive or negative embryos again based on the expression of mCherry in the PSNS using a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope. The expression of mCherry serves as a marker for the coexpression of ALK in tissues of the mosaic primary injected animals.",
    "NOTE: ~600 offspring resulting from the breeding of MYCN stable transgenic fish with wild-type fish were injected per group with the linearized DNA constructs, including dβh:ALK F1174L and dβh:mCherry, dβh:ALKWT and dβh:mCherry, or dβh:mCherry alone, respectively. Mosaic expression of mCherry can be observed in 70-90% of the primarily injected fish. One-half to one-third of the injected fish survived through the larvae stage for tumor watch.\nRaise all of the mCherry+MYCN+ and mCherry+MYCN- embryos according to the standard protocols from the zebrafish book 39 and monitor tumor onset beginning at 5 weeks postfertilization.\n4. Tumor Watch in Mosaic Transgenic Fish\nMonitor mCherry-positive primarily injected fish every 2 weeks starting at 5 weeks postfertilization for evidence of tumor onset.\nAnesthetize fish with tricaine (0.02%) and screen for the presence of mCherry- and EGFP-expressing tumors in the PSNS under the Nikon SMZ-1500 stereoscopic fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital sight DS-U1 camera.\nTo confirm whether the tumors are expressing the ALK transgene, isolate the mCherry- and EGFP-positive masses for ALK genotyping PCR.\nUsing PCR, amplify genomic DNA extracted from developed tumors with the following primers: ALK P7: 5’-AGG CCA GGT GTC CGG AAT GC-3’ and ALK P18: 5’-TGT CTT CAG GCT GAT GTT GC-3’ and the following PCR reaction: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of (94 °C for 30 sec, 55 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 60 sec). Then, sequence the PCR product with ALK P7 primer to further confirm the existence of mutant or wild-type ALK in the mCherry-positive tumors.\nSubscription Required.
