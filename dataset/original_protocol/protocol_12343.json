    "NOTE: All experimental protocols were approved by the International Committee for Animal Care and Use in Israel. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.\n1. Preparation for the Forced Swim Test\nUse two adjacent rooms. Use one room as a “waiting room” for holding the animals prior to behavioral testing, and the other for carrying out the procedure.\nPrepare transparent cylindrical glass containers (the only restriction for the number of containers is the space available) measuring 50 cm in height and a diameter of 20 cm.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to run several animals simultaneously in the same room. If so, separate the containers from one another using a dark screen so that the animals will not see each other during the procedure.\nPrepare video camera(s) in front of the containers so that every camera perceives one or more containers in a way that will allow the clear observation of the animals’ behavior later on while viewing the footage.\nPrepare clean drying cages, heat lamps and heat pads for the animals that have finished the procedure to avoid hypothermia. Make sure the bottom of the cage has blotting paper and change it when it gets wet. Do not place the cages in the testing room.\n\tNOTE: Make sure not to mix animals from different home cages while they are staying in the transient drying cages.\n2. Animal Handling Prior to Testing\nHouse animals in a room with a 12 hr light/dark cycle.\nDuring the days of the experimental procedure give the animals free access to food and water, except for the specific time spent in the procedure room.\nWhen using rats, handle the animals for about 2 min daily, 5 days prior to the beginning of the experimental procedure.\n3. Training Procedure",
    "The procedure is carried out differently for rats and mice.\nNOTE: For both mice and rats, watch the animals while they are in the water at all times. In case an animal appears in serious distress (e.g. very tired, cannot stay up float) remove the animal from the water and exclude it from the experiment.\nFor mice — There is one session 6 min long, divided into pretest (the first 2 min) and test (the last 4 min).\n\t\nIn order for the mice to get acclimated to the testing environment, transport the animals in their home cages at least 30 min prior to behavioral testing to the waiting room.\nFill the cylinders with tap water at 25 °C and adjust the water depth according to the mouse’ size, so that it cannot touch the bottom of the container with its hind legs.\nMark the cylinder with the animal number for the purpose of the identification of the animal later on while viewing the footage.\nTurn on the video camera/s and then place each mouse in the water filled cylinder container for 6 min.\nAfter 6 min have elapsed, turn the camera/s off, remove the mouse from the container and place it in the transient drying cage with the heat lamp above it and the heat pad under it. The mice should be closely and continuously monitored while recovering in this cage. For this purpose it is possible to place a thermometer at the level of the mice to make sure the temperature in the cage does not exceed 37 °C. Also, place the cage such that not all of it falls under the lamp or over the pad; this allows the mouse to move to a cooler area if desired.",
    "Change the water after every session to avoid any influence on the next mouse.\nFor rats — There are 2 sessions, 24 hr apart. The first session is the pre-test stage (15 min) and the second session is the test stage (5 min).\n\t\nIn order for the rats to get acclimated to the testing environment, transport the animals in their home cages at least 30 min prior to behavioral testing to the waiting room.\nFill the cylinders with tap water at 23 ± 1 °C and adjust the water depth according to the rat’s size, so that it cannot touch the bottom of the container with its hind legs.\nMark the cylinder with the animal number for the purpose of the identification of the animal later on while viewing the footage.\nPlace each rat in the water filled cylinder container for 15 min.\nAfter 15 min have elapsed remove the rat from the container and place it in the transient drying cage with the heat lamp above it and the heat pad under it. The rat should be closely and continuously monitored while recovering in this cage. For this purpose it is possible to place a thermometer at the level of the rat to make sure the temperature in the cage does not exceed 37 °C. Also, place the cage such that not all of it falls under the lamp or over the pad; this allows the rat to move to a cooler area if desired.\nChange the water after every session to avoid any influence on the next rat.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the end of the pretest stage.",
    "Twenty-four hours later, in order for the rats to get acclimated to the testing environment, transport the animals in their home cages at least 30 min prior to behavioral testing to the waiting room.\nFill the cylinders with tap water at 23 ± 1 °C and adjust the water depth according to the rat’s size, so that it cannot touch the bottom of the container with its hind legs.\nMark the cylinder with the animal number for the purpose of the identification of the animal later on while viewing the footage.\nTurn on the video camera/s and then place the rat in the water filled cylinder container for 5 min. Make sure that each rat is tested in the same container and position in the room as the previous day.\nAfter 5 min have elapsed turn the camera/s off, remove the rat from the container and place it in the transient drying cage with the heat lamp above it and the heat pad under it. The rat should be closely and continuously monitored while recovering in this cage. For this purpose it is possible to place a thermometer at the level of the rat to make sure the temperature in the cage does not exceed 37 °C. Also, place the cage such that not all of it falls under the lamp or over the pad; this allows the rat to move to a cooler area if desired.\nChange the water after every session to avoid any influence on the next rat.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the end of the test stage.\n4. The Behavioral Coding\nFor mice, code the last 4 min defined as the test stage. For rats, code the 5 min of the test stage.",
    "Code the duration of time spent as “Immobile” if the mouse is floating with the absence of any movement except for those necessary for keeping the nose above water.\nCode the duration of time spent as “Struggling/climbing” if quick movements of the forelimbs are observed such that the front paws break the surface of the water.\nCode the duration of time spent as “Swimming” if movement of forelimbs or hind limbs in a paddling fashion is observed.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to use an alternative way to code these behaviors, this includes a time-sampling method. Rate the swimming, struggling or immobility as the frequency of episodes at 5 sec intervals throughout the test session.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
