    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBlood sample collection\nTiming: 10–15 min\nOnce working FCS vials are ready for use, blood samples (30–500μL) may be collected from subjects by finger pricking, preferably using a lancet.\nOptional: A capillary with anti-coagulant (such as EDTA or heparin) can be used for collection of blood.\nCritical: If there is a delay of more than 5 mins between collection of blood and its fixation in FCS, treat the blood with anticoagulant (heparin/EDTA).\nNote: Blood treated with anticoagulant (heparin/EDTA) and stored at 4°C, can be used for fixation in FCS, up to 24 h after withdrawal. Frozen blood samples and/or blood samples stored bellow 4°C, were not tested for the fixation with FCS.\nNote: The protocol below requires 0.5ml blood samples for each fixation.\nBlood fixation with FCS\nTiming: 8–10 min\nInfuse collected blood samples (0.5 mL) with 7.5 mL of FCS solution (Mixture 3), drop by drop (8–10 drops/min, with intermittent manual shaking after each drop, gentle vortexing can also be carried out, it is recommended to avoid high speed vortexing).\nCritical: Blood sample should be added slowly, drop by drop with gentle mixing, otherwise there would be a possibility of formation of small blood clots, which are difficult to dissolve.\nNote: We previously optimized the ratio of FCS and blood volumes as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. We compared the cell recovery for each ratio with recovery obtained by RBC lysis method, which served as a control.\nThe optimum dilution range of FCS: Blood, v/v is 1:0.1 to 1: 0.45. Below we describe the protocol for a proportion of 7.5 mL (FCS): 0.5 mL (blood volume) (ratio of 1:0.15).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1014_4.csv",
    "Note: Since the ratio of FCS to blood is important, the user may scale up or down the volumes of both (depending on their needs). Blood is to be mixed with FCS such that the final ratio remains between 1:0.1 and 1: 0.45.\nGently shake the vials, to allow homogeneous distribution of blood cells. The RBCs and platelets will get lysed, and the WBCs will get fixed in the whole blood. These fixed blood samples can be stored and/or transported at ambient temperature for up to 4 months.\nNote: FCS has been tested for its stability up to 4 months in ambient conditions (in dark and temperature range of 4°C–35°C). The fixed sample may be stored in FCS such that the total storage time of FCS does not exceed the upper limit of 4 months (i.e., if 2 months old FCS is being used for the fixation of the blood, it can be stored for 2 more months).\nProperly fixed blood sample will be a dark maroon homogeneous mixture. It contains fixed WBCs and lysed RBCs and platelets. Fixed sample needs to be stored in the dark and in an airtight vessel/tube. pH of FCS fixed blood (500 μL blood in 7.5 mL of FCS) sample:\nFreshly fixed blood sample (same day); pH = 3.18\nOne month old fixed blood sample; pH = 3.18\nFour months old fixed blood sample; pH = 3.16\nNote: This slight change in the pH of the fixed blood sample, does not affect the recovery of the leukocytes. After fixation, the cap should be closed airtight as leaky storage may lead to increase in the pH of fixed blood sample, owing to evaporation of glacial acetic acid. This may alter the fixation properties of the FCS.\nLeukocyte recovery\nTiming: 50–60 min",
    "Centrifuge fixed blood samples at 1000 RPM (188×g) for 10 min (25°C, brake setting should be low, 1–2), to allow for settling of leukocytes along with the debris.\nDiscard the supernatant by aspiration with a micropipette or with the help of motor/pump orerated aspirator.\nCritical: Discarding supernatant by inverting the tube, should be avoided. The discarded supernantant must not be discharged down the drain, it must follow proper disposal procedure (read, how to dispose mixture of organic solvents).\nResuspend the resulting pellet gently in 8 mL stock FCS Mixture 1/recovery cocktail. Recovery cocktail dissolves the debris of RBCs and platelets present in the mixture.\nRepeat washing with the recovery cocktail 2–3 times to remove all the debris and preserve the pellet. No, additional incubation is required in between, to allow lysis to occur.\nNote: To determine the number of washes required, we recommend that you resuspend the pellet in 50 μl of recovery cocktail after the 2nd wash and take 5 μl of cell suspension and drop it on top of a glass slide, let it air dry and observe at 10 and or 40× magnification with a bright field microscope. Population of WBCs and cell debris can be easily distinguished (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). If a substantial amount of debris is observed, repeat the washes 1 or 2 more times, and recheck with the microscope. Generally, 3 washes are enough to remove cell debris, but we did not observe changes in the nuclear morphology and integrity of WBCs even after 5 washes.\nThis pellet contains all types of WBCs, which can be used as per the need of the assay.",
    "These recovered WBCs can further be re-suspended in stock FCS (Mixture 1) and stored at room temperature or at cold condition (4 or −20°C) for long durations. The work flow is pictorially presented in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1014-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. WBCs with cell debris at different recovery steps\nField view of recovered WBCs along with cell debris after (A) 1st wash (B) 2nd wash and (C) 3rd wash, with recovery cocktail (Mixture 1). It can be observed that cell debris reduced significantly after each wash.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1014-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic illustration of the process of collection of blood sample in tubes containing FCS, fixation, storage, and recovery of leukocytes at ambient temperature\nPause point: WBCs can be recovered anytime (within 4 months) from the FCS (Mixture 3) fixed whole blood sample. After recovery (at any time, up to 4 month), these WBCs, can be re-suspended and stored in Mixture 1, at room temperature for 5–6 days, in an airtight tube and same can be stored for, maximum up to 4 months at 4 or −20°C, without compromising its morphology and nuclear integrity (stability at 4°C and −20°C was found to be same). If WBCs are recovered after 1, 2 or 3 months of fixation, it can be stored/preserved, in Mixture 1 for 3, 2 and 1 months respectively at 4 or −20°C. WBCs recovered after 4 months of fixation, should be used within 1–2 days. In short, total storage time (either in Mixture 1 or in Mixture 3), should not exceed 4 months.\nNote: For comparison and to serve as a control sample, leukocytes can also be recovered from unfixed fresh blood sample by RBC lysis method using commercially available RBC lysis buffer from BioLegend, USA, following the recommended protocol (de Resende et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])."
