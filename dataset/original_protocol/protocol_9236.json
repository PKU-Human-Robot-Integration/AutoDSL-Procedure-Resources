    "1. Installing and Running ArrayNinja\nDownload and install Oracle Virtual Box from www.virtualbox.org.\nDownload and uncompress the ArrayNinja virtual machine (VM) from http://research.vai.org/Tools/arrayninja.\nOpen Virtual Box and add the ArrayNinja VM by clicking 'Machine,' 'Add,' and select arrayninja.vbox from the folder where ArrayNinja VM was saved.\nStart ArrayNinja by selecting it inside Virtual Box and clicking the green 'start' arrow.\nVirtual Box will open a new window and display a message that the VM can be accessed by navigating the web browser to localhost:2080.                                                                                                                                         NOTE: A containerized version of ArrayNinja is also available via hub.docker.com/r/bradley.dickson/arrayninja/\n2. Designing the Array Slide and Source Plate Layout\nUnder the 'Plan a slide layout' heading on the ArrayNinja interface, click on the link that corresponds to the microarray printer being used.\n\tNOTE: ArrayNinja has been programmed to mimic the robotic movement of two commonly used microarray printers (see Table 1). Compatibility with the other arrayers can be configured upon request.\nClick inside the 'Load plate' dialog box, type \"empty\", and click 'enter.' See Figure 2 for a screenshot of the ArrayNinja design module.\nAdjust the spot diameter to 275 µm and spot spacing to 375 µm. Adjust the remaining settings (Plate Blocks/plate row, Total plate Rows, replicates, features in y, Super Arrays, SuperA fudge; see Figure 2) to customize how the features will appear on the microarray slide.\n\tNOTE: The spot diameter is determined by the size of the microarray pin. As these settings are adjusted, the cartoon slide will update in real-time. Use this cartoon to preview how each setting is modifying the final slide layout.\nAfter the layout of features on the slide is finalized, mouse over each unique feature and enter the feature identifier in the pop-up dialog box.",
    "NOTE: Feature identifiers can consist of numbers, letters, or combinations. This is only required for unique features, and a dialog box will not appear when replicates are selected.\nAfter all unique features have been assigned an identifier, click 'populate.' Enter a name for the slide layout and click 'print your plate' to save. A new page will open displaying the number of 384-well source plates needed to fabricate the chosen slide design and a table mapping the physical location of each feature to be loaded in the source plate(s).\n\tNOTE: Remember this name, as it will be used to recall this design when analyzing microarray data (see section 6.2). Clicking 'print your plate' saves the layout within ArrayNinja.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55912/55912fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: ArrayNinja Design Module. A screen shot of the ArrayNinja design module is shown in the dotted line. The control panel (top) shows all of the parameters that can be altered on the microarray printer. As these parameters are adjusted, the cartoon image of the slide layout (bottom left) updates in real time. After the layout is set, the user can mouse over individual spots to enter unique feature identifiers. ArrayNinja constructs from this user input a map of the position of each feature in the source plate(s) (bottom right) needed to fabricate a specified microarray slide layout.

Fabricating Microarrays\nPreparing the Source Plate\n\t\nUse the map generated with ArrayNinja in section 2.5 to create the 384-well source plate(s).\n\t\tNOTE: Detailed descriptions of peptides queried on this platform can be found elsewhere17.\nDeposit 1 - 2 µL of each feature (e.g., biotinylated histone peptide) into the correct well of the 384-well source plate(s).",
    "NOTE: Biotinylated histone peptides are typically deposited from 200 - 400 µM stock solutions, which equates to 10 to 25-fold molar excess of peptide to streptavidin binding sites in a single array spot. This is calculated using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55912/55912eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere V is the volume delivered by a pin, [P] is the concentration of the feature being printed, NA is Avogadro's number, and S is the surface area of a spot. C is the coverage of the slide, expressed as the number of streptavidin molecules per unit area multiplied by three (the average number of available streptavidin binding sites). V and C are obtained by the respective manufacturer's. Other features may require different concentrations depending on the size of the biomolecule where crowding may be a concern. A range of printing concentrations for each new type of feature should be tested empirically to determine the optimum printing concentration.\nDilute each feature 10-fold with 1x printing buffer supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Spin the source plate(s) at 500 x g for 2 min at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The inclusion of fluorescein-labeled biotin (5 µg/µL) in the printing buffer is recommended as a spotting control and as a visual aid to facilitate proper array alignment during analysis (see Figure 4).\nPrinting Protocol (Figure 3A – B).\n\t\nPrepare the arrayer by emptying the waste collection container and filling the wash solution container and humidifier container with sterile distilled water.\nEnter the parameters used to design the slide in ArrayNinja (section 2 and Figure 2) into the microarray printer control program.\nUsing the microarray printer control program, set the washing procedure for a 1 s wash with one immersion. Set the post-wash settings to re-dip the pins 5 times following each wash. Set the humidity to 60%.",
    "NOTE: The optimal wash configuration may vary depending on the microarray printer being used. The optimal post-wash pin dip configuration may vary depending on the microarray printer being used.\nInsert functionalized slides (e.g., streptavidin-coated glass) into the substrate platens and place all platens into the platen elevator. Insert the source plate(s) into the plate holder(s) and place into the source plate elevator.\nClick 'print'. Monitor the printing process for a few rounds of feature deposition to ensure all wash and dip settings are correct. When the print run is complete, remove the substrate platens from the arrayer.\n\t\tNOTE: When large print runs prohibit completion of blocking steps within one day, printed slides can be incubated in a humidified chamber at 4 °C overnight. Incubate the slides next to a small beaker of water inside a cardboard box sealed with plastic wrap.\nBlock the slides with blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature with mixing.\nWash the slides 2 x 10 min at room temperature in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.6 with mixing. Dry the slides by spinning in a microarray slide centrifuge for 30 s at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: For processing a large number of slides at once, a high-throughput microscope slide washing chamber can be used, allowing 50 slides to be washed in parallel.\nFor slides designed to be partitioned with wax, proceed to section 4.1. For all other designs, store slides at 4 °C protected from light and moisture.\n\t\tNOTE: Printed biotinylated histone peptides are stable for at least 6 months when stored this way.\n4. Partitioning Microarray Slides\nHydrophobic Wax Pen (Figure 3C)\n\t\nApply wax around the areas that contain features using a wax pen. Allow wax to air dry for 5 min before proceeding to section 5.",
    "NOTE: After blocking, the array spots can be very difficult to visualize by eye. The slide design from ArrayNinja can be printed to scale and used as a guide for applying wax.\nSilicon gasket (Figure 3D)\n\t\nPeel the clear film off the back of the array gasket and place adhesive side down onto the microarray slide.\nHold the gasket in place for 5 s prior to proceeding to section 5.\nWax Imprint (Figure 3E)\n\t\nFor slides designed to be partitioned by wax, print a test slide on plain glass using 10% BSA. Use this test slide to optimize the wax imprinter guides or array settings to ensure all features will be within the wax-mold chambers.\nHeat the microarray wax imprinter to 85 °C until all the wax is completely melted, approximately 30 min.\nInsert the slide with the printed side facing down and push the slide all the way to the right guide on the microarray imprinter. Pull up the lever to bring the mold into contact with the surface of the slide. Hold for 2 s.\n\t\tNOTE: The hold time can be altered to achieve optimal wax border thickness.\nQuickly remove the slide and visually inspect the wax borders to ensure all wells are enclosed and that the borders are not so thick that they encroach on the spots. Store slides at 4 °C protected from moisture and light.\n\t\tNOTE: The hold time can be increased or decreased to obtain thicker or thinner borders.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55912/55912fig3.jpg",

Hybridizing a Histone PTM Antibody with a Peptide Microarray\nPrepare hybridization buffer (PBS, pH 7.6, 5% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20).\nEquilibrate the slide in hybridization buffer using a hybridization vessel. Completely cover the entire slide in hybridization buffer and incubate for 30 min at 4 °C on an orbital shaker at low speed.\nPrepare a solution containing diluted histone PTM antibody in hybridization buffer.\n\tNOTE: In the example data, both histone Antibody #1 and Antibody #2 were diluted 1:1,000 in hybridization buffer. A dilution range similar to that used for immunoblotting is recommended as a starting point.\nIncubate the array with the antibody solution for 1 h at 4 °C. Remove the antibody solution and wash the array 3 times for 5 min at 4 °C with cold PBS, pH 7.6.\nPrepare a 1:5,000 - 1:10,000 dilution of fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody in hybridization buffer.\nIncubate the array with secondary antibody solution for 30 min at 4 °C protected from light. Remove the secondary antibody solution and wash the microarray slide 3 times for 5 min at 4 °C with PBS, pH 7.6. Dip the microarray in a 50-mL conical tube containing 0.1x PBS, pH 7.6 to remove excess salt at room temperature. Dry the slide in a microarray slide centrifuge at room temperature.",
    "Scan the slide with a microarray scanner at 25 µm resolution or higher, following the microarray scanner manufacturer's recommended scanning protocol.\n\tNOTE: If fluorescein-labeled biotin tracer is present, scan both the green channel (ex: 488 nm, em: 509 nm) and the channel that corresponds to the fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody, typically red (ex: 635 nm, em: 677 nm). The goal of scanning is to obtain single channel .tif files that can be merged into a single .png file (as described in section 6.1).\n6. Analysis of Microarray Data using ArrayNinja\nPreparing a merged microarray image\n\tNOTE: The goal of this section is to create a .png image file that merges the two single-channel .tif files (obtained in section 5). This is the only image format compatible with the ArrayNinja analysis module. The following instructions represent one possible way to obtain a merged image file. However, other solutions are available (e.g., the freeware ImageJ).\n\t\nFrom the command line in a bash terminal of a computer with the freeware ImageMagick installed, navigate to the folder that contains the single channel .tif files and copy/paste the following steps, hitting 'enter' between each step (6.1.4 - 6.1.7).\n\t\tNOTE: File names in capital letters (e.g., RED_CHANNEL) should be replaced with the file name of the microarray slide images.\nIf necessary, first invert the images using the command 'convert INPUT.tif -negate OUTPUT.tif'. This is required if the scanner saves .tif files with the signal in white and background in black.\n\t\t\nconvert -depth 16 RED_CHANNEL.TIF -clone 0 -channel GB -evaluate set 0 -delete 0 out.png 2>error.file.\nconvert - depth 16 CONTROL_CHANNEL.TIF -clone 0 -channel RB -evaluate set 0 -delete 0 outa.png 2>error.file.\nconvert -depth 16 CONTROL_CHANNEL.TIF -clone 0 -channel RG -evaluate set 0 -delete 0 outB.png 2>error.file.\nconvert out.png outa.png outB.png -set colorspace RGV -combine merged.png.",
    "NOTE: A file named 'merged.png' will be saved in the same folder as the original .tif files.\nQuantifying data using ArrayNinja\n\t\nOpen ArrayNinja and click on the appropriate microarray printer link under \"To quantify images which have a known source plate.\" Type the name of the saved slide design (step 2.5) in the \"load plate\" dialog box and click 'enter.' See Figure 4 for a screenshot of the ArrayNinja analysis module.\nClick 'Choose File' and navigate to and select the 'merged.png' file created in section 6.1. The merged image will load as well as a grid for the slide layout.\nUse the sliders at the bottom of the ArrayNinja control panel to adjust the contrast, brightness, and midpoint.\n\t\tNOTE: These adjustments are for visualization purposes only and have no impact on quantification.\nSelect \"resolution\" and enter the value that matches the resolution of the scanned image. Use the \"margin side\" and \"margin top\" to move the grid into alignment with the spots on the array. Adjust as needed to get the grid as closely aligned over each spot as possible.\nClick 'Spot Seek' and wait until the button returns to the original grey color.\n\t\tNOTE: This can be repeated several times to center the grid circles on individual spots. The Seek function relaxes the grid toward each spot to fine-tune the alignment.",
    "Change the \"Super Arrays\" value to \"1\" to work up each sub array panel individually (if desired). If using a 4 x 12 wax imprint slide layout (Figure 3E), use the \"iPin\" \"jPin\" and \"subA\" controls to turn off features to analyze any desired combination of 4 x 12 wells. For example, to analyze the top left and top right wells as replicates of each other, enter \"1 4\" into iPin, \"1 1\" into jPin and \"1 4\" into subA. Press 'enter'.\nHover the mouse over individual spots to view the identity of that feature.\nClick 'Toggle zoom' to review features more carefully. Select background reference spots by pressing the 'R' key while the mouse is over a spot. Reference spots will be highlighted in orange.\n\t\tNOTE: In \"toggle zoom\" mode, a magnified image of the feature that the mouse is over is displayed in the upper right hand corner. A detailed discussion of additional background correction features in ArrayNinja are discussed elsewhere28.\nToggle off spots (with widely varied spot morphology or debris that would affect accurate quantification) by pressing the 'A' key while hovering the mouse over the affected spots. Inactivated spots will turn white.\nClick 'populate' followed by 'Submit' to quantify the spots.\n\t\tNOTE: A new tab will open and display a bar graph of data normalized to the brightest spot average. A table below the bar graph contains both the normalized and raw data values. This table can be copied into a spreadsheet for archiving and further analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55912/55912fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4: ArrayNinja Analysis Module. A screen shot of the ArrayNinja analysis module is shown. The control panel (top left) shows all of the parameters that can be adjusted to visualize the array, find spots, and align a grid over the array image. Hovering the mouse over a feature shows a zoomed-in view (top right) and displays a popup that contains the identification information associated with that feature (bottom). Reference spots selected for background correction are orange. Features to be excluded from downstream analysis are white. ArrayNinja contains a text-based search feature that highlights matching features in yellow, as shown in the example for H4K16.
