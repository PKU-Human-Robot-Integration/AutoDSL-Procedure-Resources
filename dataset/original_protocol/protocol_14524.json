    "In the protocol described below, steps 1, 2 and 3 belong to both the research and clinical protocols, which are both strictly followed from every mesial TLE candidate for resection surgery selected only by clinical criteria. Steps 4 and 5 belong exclusively to the research protocol. Both procedures are in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethical Committee of the Hospital de la Princesa.\n1. Pre-implantation Procedures\nExplain the experimental procedures to the participant, specifying which points correspond to the research and which ones are applicable to clinical practice, remarking that the research procedure is in no way modifying the clinical procedure. Pay special attention to explaining the potential risks of the surgical implantation of electrodes. Obtain a signed informed consent form the participant.\nFor all candidates for resection surgery, perform presurgical neurological and neuropsychological examinations18.\n\t\nEvaluate the patient by interictal single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) with 99Tc-HmPAO, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1.5 T and video-electroencephalography (v-EEG) using 25 scalp electrodes according to the 10 - 20 international system and Maudsley's protocol18.\nDuring the presurgical v-EEG recording stay, progressively taper the antiepileptic drugs from the second day to the fourth day (approximately one-third of the dose per day).\n2. Implantation Procedures (Surgery)\nAdminister antiepileptic drugs pre-operatively, and perform surgery under general anesthesia (3 mg/kg propofol bolus, followed by 0.2 - 0.3 mg/kg fentanyl and 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium).\nInsert two six-contact FOEs with a 1-cm center-to-center distance bilaterally into the ambient cisterns using Kirschner's technique19.\n\t\nPlace the patient on the operating table in the supine position, with the neck gently extended at 15 degrees. Prepare the patient's cheek with an iodine solution, starting at the incision site and circling outward, and drape the area immediately surrounding the incision site.",
    "Puncture the skin with a 20-gauge spinal needle according to Hartel's landmarks20: an entry point approximately 3 cm lateral to the ipsilateral side of the oral commissure toward a point immediately inferior to the ipsilateral pupil in the anterior-posterior plane and a point approximately 2.5 cm anterior to the external auditory meatus in the lateral plane.\nAdvance the needle toward the region of the foramen ovale under fluoroscopic guidance. Use the lateral views provided by the fluoroscopy images to determine the position of the needle tip. When the needle passes the foramen ovale, remove the stylet, replace it with an electrode, and advance it into the ambient cistern (Figure 1A).\nAssess correct implantation by fluoroscopic imaging in the operating room21; this is important to exclude penetration into the foramina of the skull base, such as the inferior orbital fissure (located anterior to the foramen ovale) and the jugular foramen (located posterior to it). Such misplaced cannulation could potentially lead to serious neurovascular injury22.\nOnce the electrodes are correctly positioned in the ambient cisterns, secure them to the skin with drapes. Wake up the patient, and lead him or her to the recovery room.\n3. Acquisition of FOE Recordings\nReturn the patient to the v-EEG room for a stay of approximately 5.2 ± 2.4 days (mean ± SD).\nPlace 19 electrodes according to the international 10-20 system.\n\t\nMeasure the distance between the nasion (bridge of the nose) and the inion (occipital protuberance) using a measuring tape, and mark with a marker the middle point (location of the Cz electrode). Measure and mark the point 10% of the distance above the nasion (location of the Fpz electrode).",
    "Repeat the same procedure for the inion (location of the Oz electrode), marking the distances 20% from the Cz in both the nasion and inion directions (locations of the Fz and PZ electrodes, respectively).\nMeasure the distances between both preauricular points, and mark the distances 10% above the left and right preauricular points (T3 and T4 electrodes, respectively). Then, mark the distances 20% above both T3 and T4 in the Cz direction to obtain the locations of C3 and C4.\nCreate a circumference using the measuring tape to link the Fpz and Oz at 5% of the distances above both electrodes at FP1 (left) and FP2 (right) in the front and at O1 (left) and O2 (right) in the back.\nIn the same circumference, add 10% of the distance upward in the inion direction to obtain the position of F7, add 10% to reach T3 (it should be located above the line between the preauricular points), and add another 10% to obtain T5 (O1 electrode). Mark each electrode position and repeat the same procedure for the right (even) electrodes.\nMeasure and mark the intersection (F3 electrode location) halfway between F7 and Fz and 20% of the distance upward from Fp1 in the F3 direction. Repeat this process in each quadrant of the head to obtain F4 (front-right position), P3 (back-left position) and P4 (back-left position).\nClean and dry the skin. Place a moderate quantity of collodion with conductive gel in each electrode cup, and position the electrodes in the prepped areas. Dry the collodion with a hair dryer.\nConnect all of the electrodes (scalp and FOEs) by wires to the electrode box, which is already connected to an electroencephalographer. Ensure that the electrode signals are good, and verify that the scalp electrodes impedances are under 10 kΩ using the electroencephalographer.",
    "Acquire digital scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data and FOE data at 1,024 Hz using a video synchronized electroencephalographer (v-EEG), and filter the data using a band-pass filter in the range 0.5 - 100 Hz and a Notch filter (50 Hz) with the electroencephalographer.\nProgressively remove the antiepileptic drugs from the second to the fourth day (approximately one-third of the dose per day) to increase the likelihood of seizures. This step depends on the particular drug prescription of each patient.\nUse both interictal paroxysmal and ictal activities to approximately locate the ictogenic areas by identifying the electrodes/channel where epileptogenic elements appear23, including the slow-wave complex, polyspikes, runs of rapid spikes, sharp waves, sharp-and-slow-wave complex, slow sharp waves, spikes and spike and slow waves. Record the times of seizure onset and end, as well as any other clinical signs or occurrences relevant to the study. There is a one-to-one mapping between the electrodes location in the patient's head and the head model in the EEG software which allows identifying anatomically where the epileptogenic activity appears.\nWhen the study is finished, remove the FOEs at the v-EEG unit by gently pulling them out while the patient's mouth remains half-opened. Do not systematically perform imaging after FOE removal, except when neurological symptoms appear. In such cases, perform an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan.\n4. FOE Signal Preprocessing\nExport the data stored on the electroencephalographer at 200 Hz in ASCII format in epochs suitable for numerical analysis of approximately 30 min of seizure activity (already identified by an expert neurophysiologist) (Figure 1C). Avoid epochs containing artifacts, such as saturated electrical activity, muscle activity, and electrode displacements.",
    "Open the exported files using any UNIX stream editor, and remove all non-numerical characters from the exported data files, leaving only time stamps and channel voltages. Save the modified files for further numerical analysis.\n\tNOTE: From now on, perform all calculations using R packages from the R repository or homemade codes (Table 1).\nUsing R software, install the required R packages, and load the modified data files into the R environment. Order all channels, assigning each one to a particular column of the array that contains all of the data, eliminating empty channels and referencing them to an average mid-line reference (Fz + Cz + Pz)/3.\n\t\nUse the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (R function: fft) and plot the resulting variable to check for the effective removal of the line frequency (approximately 50 Hz). Use the frequency domain to filter other spurious frequencies that may contaminate the signals.\nConvert the loaded data to a multivariate time-series object (mts) of 28 columns — 16 scalp and 12 FOEs — using the R function ts. Divide the mts object into non-overlapping temporal windows of 5 seconds each (1,000 data points at 200 Hz) to reduce the file size and optimize computation time.\n5. Post-processing Calculations (Complex Network Analysis)\nNOTE: Calculate the measures described below in each temporal window, starting at 5 min before seizure onset (60 windows) and ending at 5 minutes after seizure onset (60 windows), with the aim of visualizing the temporal evolution.\nCalculate univariate measures, spectral power, excitability and spectral entropy for each individual column/channel without considering the correlations between different time series.\n\t\nCalculate excitability (S) for each voltage activity time series using a homemade code according to the equation proposed by Schindler24 (see supplemental file). S > 2.5 is considered epileptogenic, an empirically determined threshold17,25,26.",
    "For each activity time series, calculate the power spectral density using a homemade code for the Delta (>0.5 Hz and <4 Hz), Theta (4 - 7 Hz), Alpha (7 - 14 Hz), Beta (14 - 30 Hz) and Gamma (>30).\nCalculate Shannon entropy with a homemade code using the power spectral density of each time series instead of the corresponding probability time series. Average the individual spectral entropy (SE) values obtained for each channel over a set of electrodes. Shannon entropy is explained in the supplemental file.\n\t\tNOTE: A decrease in SE should be interpreted as a decrease in the number of frequencies of the spectrum because SE is the entropy of the spectrum.\nNetwork measures\n\tNOTE: This section assesses the interactions between different time series of electrodes.\n\t\nCalculate the functional connectivity between each pair of voltage time series in each temporal window using the absolute value of the linear cross-correlation coefficient computed at zero lag (R function: ccf).\n\t\tNOTE:To eliminate non-representative values of synchronization, establish a threshold based on previous studies17,25,26. Use a threshold of 0.5 in this particular case.\nInstall the igraph R package27. Create an igraph object from the adjacency matrix (R function: graph.adjacency). Use the correlation matrix obtained in the previous step, specifying that the graph is weighted and undirected.\nIn each temporal window calculate the average path length (APL) (R function average.path.length) for the entire network (scalp+FOE), and for each of the four sub-networks: left scalp, right scalp, left FOE and right FOE. In exactly the same way, calculate the density of links (DoL) (R function: graph.density), modularity (Mod) (R function: modularity) and the Average clustering coefficient (ACC) (R function: transitivity).\nRepeat the previous steps 5.2.1 through 5.2.3 using phase synchronization (homemade R code) as an estimate of functional connectivity instead of the cross-correlation function.",
    "To represent the size effects in the variable changes, calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) (R function from package MBESS: smd), between the preictal and the ictal stages as well as between the preictal and postictal stages.\n\t\nTaking the preictal as the baseline, select thirty seconds (6 values) five minutes before seizure onset mark, as the preictal value. A similar temporal window of 30 s can be chosen during the seizure in order to quantify the change, respect to the preictal stage, by using the SMD.\nIn a similar fashion, 5 min after seizure ends, select a temporal window of 30 s in order to quantify the change during the postictal stage (in respect to the preictal stage)."
