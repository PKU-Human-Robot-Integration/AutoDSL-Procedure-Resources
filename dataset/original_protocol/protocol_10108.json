    "The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Care was taken to avoid unnecessary prolonged anesthesia and also to avoid hypothermia. Animals were weighted at each ROM measurement session and monitored for weight loss.\n1. Study Subjects\nUse 10 Sprague-Dawley rats that are 13 weeks old at the time of surgery and that range between 250–300 g of body weight.\n2. Surgical Procedure\nUnder anesthesia and before surgical immobilization, measure the baseline torque as a function of rotation angle between 60° of external rotation and 80° of internal rotation (see Step 5).\nInduce anesthesia with 5% isoflurane through inhalation in an induction chamber, and then sustain with 2% isoflurane through a nose cone throughout the surgery.\nUse a water-based heating element underneath the animal to maintain body temperature during anesthesia.\nFor the purpose of pain control, administer sustained-release buprenorphine subcutaneously at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg depending on the rat’s body weight.\nImmobilize the left glenohumeral joints at an angle of 60° of abduction (the angle between the humeral shaft and the scapular spine)10,11.\nStart the surgical procedure with a posterior longitudinal incision, parallel to the humeral shaft. Make the skin incision just below the glenohumeral joint and extend for about 3 cm.\nUse 2 sutures (braided polyester) to immobilize the glenohumeral joint, by piercing through the lateral edge of the scapula and around the distal two thirds of the humeral shaft, and subsequently tighten as illustrated in Figure 1A. Take extra effort to avoid constricting critical structures such as the brachial artery.",
    "Note: The surgical technique has an advantage of being able to limit the glenohumeral joint at 60° of abduction (Z) without affecting other plans (X & Y). By placing sutures around the humerus and through the lateral border of the scapula, an approximation of the two structures is achieved and maintained at the scapular blade plane. After tightening the sutures, the arm is fixed at the resting position when considering X & Y planes and at 60° of abduction when Z plane is considered. This is thought to limit variability between the animals which might be generated from failure of fine tuning the joint position in the three plans.\n3. Closing the Incision\nAfter proper hemostasis, close the skin incision using skin clips.\nDiscontinue the anesthesia and allow the animal to recover under supervision in a warm environment. After the animal regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency, return it back to its cage.\nImmediately after the procedure, allow the animals to return to normal activity. Allow the animals to move without restriction, relying mainly on internal sutures to fix the glenohumeral joint.\nTo monitor for possible infection, inspect the incision sites daily during the first post-operative week.\nRemove wound clips on the 10th day after surgery.\n\tNOTE: There was no manipulation of muscles during the procedure, and the technique did not involve any intra-articular trauma, thus preserving capsular and articular continuity and anatomic integrity. Neither external restrain nor activity limitation was followed in our protocol.\nProvide analgesia using sustained-release buprenorphine, injected subcutaneously at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg starting at anesthesia induction and repeated every 72 h if needed.\n4. Suture Removal 8 Weeks After Immobilization",
    "Induce anesthesia with 5% isoflurane through inhalation in an induction chamber, then sustained with 2% isoflurane through a nose cone throughout the surgery. For the purpose of pain control, administer sustained-release buprenorphine subcutaneously at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg depending on the rat’s body weight.\nMake an incision on top of the scar from the previous procedure.\nCut the sutures and remove from the humerus and the scapula.\nClose the incision with wound clips.\nExamine the incision site daily during the first week to detect any signs of infection. Monitor pain and distress as well.\nRemove wound clips on the 10th day after surgery.\n5. Range of Motion and Joint Stiffness Measurements\nMeasure the ROM and passive shoulder mechanics before and after immobilization using a customized device consisting of an arm clamp, a sensor assembly and a pivoting axle11. This is performed pre-operatively (baseline) and continuously after suture removal.\nMeasure ROM immediately after suture removal (follow-up day 0), and subsequently twice a week.\nReduce measurements to once weekly, upon recording less than 10% change from the previous time point.\n\t\tNote: After testing ROM for weeks, the ROM of each animal did not change drastically between testing time points (less than 10% change). The ROM seemed to plateau at this point, therefore, we felt that decreasing testing frequency from twice a week to once a week was sufficient.\nCarry out measurements under anesthesia using isoflurane via precision vaporizer at 5% for induction and 2% for maintenance for the full length of the procedure (approximately 5 minutes), in order to facilitate measurements efficiently. Use a water-based heating element underneath the animal to maintain body temperature during anesthesia.",
    "Position the animal properly for ROM measurement with the aid of a laser guide. Position the forelimb on the arm clamp in 90° forward flexion, with the sensing axis aligned with the long axis of the humerus. Secure the forelimb by the wrist and elbow as illustrated in Figure 1B.\nControl passive forelimb rotation by a stepper motor to assess ROM and torque in a consistent manner. Control the stepper motor with a microcontroller. Use inputs from the inclinometer, in conjunction with those from a torque sensor to indicate the start and end of the measurements.\nConnect the microcontroller to a computer and control using an in-house developed MATLAB code.\nFor the baseline measurements only, cycle the sensor assembly 3 times between 60° of external rotation and 80° of internal rotation to obtain initial torque measurements (external: text and internal: tint) for later comparison.\nFor ROM measurements, use the torque values of each animal at their own baseline measurements (text and tint) as preset input variables in the program to detect changes in rotation ROM. Use the baseline measurements as a comparative stopping point for subsequent ROM measurements. Changes were detected with a 0.2° resolution.\nFor stiffness measurements, use the original rotation angles of 60° external rotation and 80° internal rotation as preset input in the program in order to detect changes in torque. Changes were detected with a resolution of 0.01 Nmm.\nWeigh animals on the same day as each ROM assessment. Place the animals on scales and record their masses. These data were used as one of the tools to assess animal health status during the study.",
    "Following recovery, return rats to their cages and monitor for signs of pain or distress. Throughout this testing, no animal is left unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n\tNOTE: ROM and torque measurements were achieved with a customized device, previously reported by our group {Villa-Camacho 2015}. The device is a custom-made jig that consists of a shaft rotated by stepper motor and controlled by a custom MATLAB script. A torque sensor and inertial measurement unit are used to capture torque and position data during articulation of the specimen.\n6. Post-mortem Immunohistologic Analysis\nAt the end of the 8-week ROM measurement period, euthanize rats with CO2 exposure.\nDissect both left (immobilized) and right (healthy control) shoulders by disarticulating the humerus from the ulna, and by sectioning the scapula from the clavicle and thoracic cavity.\nFix the excised shoulders in a solution of 10% neutral buffered formalin for 3 days, followed by decalcification in a solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 10% at pH 7.4 for another 2 months.\nDuring this process, place samples on a shaker in a gentle agitation cycle and store at 4 °C. Monitor decalcification of the glenohumeral joint with weekly microcomputed tomography (uCT) scans.",
    "NOTE: EDTA is a chelating agent that binds calcium ions from the apatite crystal outer surface, progressively reducing the crystal size12,13,14. This process is very slow and gentle, and it is used to detect specific tissue elements that must be preserved for techniques such as immunohistochemistry (IHC). The rate at which the EDTA decalcifies the specimen is dependent on the pH and concentration of the solution. In terms of pH, it can range from 7 to 7.4, with more alkaline solutions accelerating the decalcification speed. However, solutions with higher pH levels can damage key tissue elements. In addition, the usual EDTA concentration for such experiments lies between 10% to 14%, but it is very important to remember that the active agent becomes depleted once it bonds to calcium, so this requires replacement of the decalcification fluid at least 3 to 4 times per week15.\nOnce the decalcification process was concluded, mount the glenohumeral joints in paraffin stacks for histological sectioning. Orient the samples to allow for coronal slices. Slices obtained at 50% depth of the humeral head (at the center, mid-coronally) are shown in Figure 1. Perform immunohistochemical staining using the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method to denote the presence of fibrotic tissue in the joint.4,9,10,16\nPerform antigen retrieval by microwave irradiation by submerging the slides in a plastic Coplin jar in a sodium citrate buffer solution (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0, preheated for 5 min at 95–100 °C) and placing in a regular microwave oven for 10 minutes at medium power. Allow slides to cool for 30 min at room temperature.\nPerform blocking with goat serum for 30 min, and incubate the specimens with a primary mouse mono-clonal antibody (1:400 dilution) to fibronectin overnight at 4 °C.",
    "After incubation with the primary antibody, wash specimens twice with PBS (0.5 ug/mL) for 10 minutes; and incubate with a secondary antibody, goat antimouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate (1:400 dilution) for 30 minutes.\nWash the specimens twice with PBS (2.5 µg/mL) on a shaker for 10 minutes and expose to 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydro-chloride and 30% hydrogen peroxide in the dark for 10 min. Counterstain with Carazzi hematoxylin.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
