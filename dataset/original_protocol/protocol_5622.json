    "Sample collection and shippingCervical tissues (~5 g/piece) from patients undergoing voluntary hysterectomy are obtained in sterile DMEM with 1x penicillin/streptomycin (see Recipes) at 4 °C within 24 h post-surgery (Merbah et al., 2011), coordinated by National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) (an institutional review board must approve the research protocol involving human tissues. Please verify with your own institutional review board for the regulation).Tissue preparationThe tissue explants were cultured based on a method described by Schürch et al. (1978).Rinse tissues three times with cold HBSS.Rinse tissues three times with cold Leibovitz’s (1x) L-15 medium.Remove mucus gently using a cotton swab.Remove muscle tissues using a carbon steel surgical blade (Figure 1A, black dashed line).Separate the endocervical region from the rest of the cervix tissue explant using a carbon steel surgical blade (Figure 1A). Store the endocervix for the next steps of the protocol while the rest of the cervix is discarded. Rinse endocervical tissue explants three times with cervical tissue culture medium.Incubate endocervical tissue explants in a 6-well tissue culture plate, one piece per well, in cervical tissue culture medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.Take a picture of tissue along with its well.Determine the area of the tissue luminal surface (dotted line in Figure 1B) by measuring the tissue to well size ratio using NIH ImageJ software. Wash the endocervical tissue explants three times with antibiotic-free cervical tissue culture medium (see Recipes), and incubate the tissue in the antibiotic-free media at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h before bacterial inoculation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201003850_6401.jpgFigure 1. Endocervical tissue explant in culture. The endocervical tissues (A), after removing mucus, muscle tissue and other parts of the cervix, are trimmed into the desired size (B) and cultured in the cervical tissue culture medium in a six-well plate.",
    "The black dashed lines indicate the cutting line on tissues and the yellow dash line circles the luminal surface of the endocervix. Scale bar = 10 mm.Infection of the endocervix with GCGrow GC on GCK agar plate (see Recipes) for 16-18 h.Collect GC by using a sterile applicator to swab GC from the plate and re-suspend GC in pre-warmed antibiotic-free cervical tissue culture media. Determine the number of bacteria by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 650 nm (an OD650 of 1 = 1 x 109 CFU/ml). Estimate the number of epithelial cells by dividing the luminal surface area of a tissue explant by the average luminal surface area of individual endocervical epithelial cells (25 µm2) (Figure 3D).Add an aliquot of the GC suspension (1 ml) directly onto each tissue piece to make an MOI = 10 bacteria to 1 epithelial cell and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3 min.Add 1 ml of antibiotic-free cervical tissue culture medium (see Recipes) to each of the above tissue pieces. Incubate tissue explants at 37 °C with 5% CO2 with gentle shaking for 24 h. Rinse infected tissue explants 6 times with 3 ml antibiotic-free cervical tissue culture medium at 6 and 12 h to remove un-adhered bacteria and replace with 2 ml of fresh media without bacteria.Tissue preparation for cryosection–FixationRinse tissue explants three times with 3 ml PBS (see Recipes).Fix tissue explants with 3 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) (see Recipes) for 1 h at room temperature.Rinse tissue explant three times with PBS.Cut tissues into a desired size, approximately 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm (Length x Width x Depth), using a razor blade.",
    "Tissue preparation for cryosection–Infiltration & EmbeddingIncubate tissue explants in 5 ml of 5% sucrose in PBS (see Recipes) at room temperature for 30 min until the explants settle to the bottom of the tube.Carefully remove the 5% sucrose and resuspend the tissue in 5 ml of 15% sucrose (in PBS) (see Recipes) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Carefully remove the sucrose and resuspend tissue explants in 7.5% porcine skin gelatin in PBS (see Recipes) for 4 h at 37 °C.Carefully remove the gelatin solution and resuspend tissue explants in 5 ml pre-warmed 20% porcine skin gelatin in PBS (see Recipes) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C.Pre-warm a flat embedding mold (Figure 2A) for each piece of tissues on a heating block at 37 °C.Fill the bottom 1/3 of molds with 20% gelatin and let it solidify at room temperature.Put one tissue piece per mold and top with 20% gelatin at 37 °C. Arrange the orientation of the tissue using pipette tips as shown in Figure 2A to have luminal surface at the top. Make sure the tissue piece is fully embedded in gelatin (Figure 2B).Let samples sit for 5 min at room temperature and then on ice block for 10 min.Use long forceps to place the mold containing tissues into liquid nitrogen vapor until the gelatin turns white.Dip the mold into liquid nitrogen for a few seconds till the samples are all frozen.Push sample blocks out of molds by warming the bottom of the mold at 42 °C on a heating block for 30 sec. Store the embedded samples in conical tubes at -80 °C.CryosectionPlace a sample block on the stage of a cryostat in an orientation, which enables sectioning through both the luminal surface and the subepithelium (Figure 2C).",
    "Section sample blocks in 40 μm thickness until reaching the tissue.Switch to desired section thickness ranging from 10-40 μm.Collect sample sections by attaching them to glass slides (Figure 2C).Store cryosections on glass slides at 4 °C for the same day processing or -20 or -80 °C for future processing.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201004138_2062.jpgFigure 2. Embedding and sectioning of endocervical tissues. A-B. Endocervical tissues are embedded with the luminal side up in 20% gelatin. Black arrow, the direction that the tissue is positioned. C. Endocervical tissue blocks are sectioned transversally through both the luminal surface and the subepithelial tissue. Endocervical tissue sections are collected using super frost plus slides for immunofluorescence staining.Immunofluorescence staining for imagingIncubate tissue sections on glass slides in a slide holder with PBS at 42 °C for 10 min to remove gelatin.Wash tissue sections three times with PBS.Aspirate excess PBS and draw an aqueous barrier circle round tissue sections using a pap pen.Fill the circle with the staining solution (see Recipes) and incubate at room temperature for 1 h for permeabilizing and blocking. Incubate tissue sections with a primary antibody in the staining solution at room temperature for 1 h. (Table 1)Table 1. The antibodies/chemicals and the final concentration used in Figures 2 and 3imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180202/20180202010607_1460.jpgNote: Fluorescent phalloidin and immunofluorescence E-cadherin staining can also be included to assess the cellular location of GC.Rinse tissue sections three times with the staining solution.Incubate tissue sections with a secondary antibody in the staining solution at room temperature for 1 h. (Table 1)Rinse tissue sections three times with the staining solution.Incubate tissue sections with Hoechst 33342 (0.2 μg/ml) in the staining solution at room temperature for 10 min. (Table 1)Rinse tissue sections three times with the staining solution.Mount tissue sections using Aqua/poly mounting media and No.1.5 or No. 1 coverslip glass.",
    "Dry for 5 min before sealing the edge of coverslip using nail polish.Slides are now ready for imaging or can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months.ImagingAcquire images using a ZEISS LSM 710 confocal microscope (an equivalent microscope can be used).Acquire Z-stack of 0.37 μm slices from the top to the bottom of a tissue section (Figure 3A).Reconstitute Z-stack images into 3D-images using ImageJ or ZEN software (Figure 3B), which allows obtaining both the transversal (Figure 3C) and luminal views (Figure 3D) of the endocervical epithelium.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201004455_3604.jpgFigure 3. 3D-reconstruction of fluorescence images. Cryo-sections of endocervical tissue explants were stained for ZO-1 (green), GC (red), and DNA (blue). Z-stack images were taken using a confocal fluorescent microscope. Shown are series of Z-stack images (A) and their 3D reconstruction (B). Images of XZ view (C) and XY view (D) of the luminal surface are then generated for publication. The red dashed line circles the luminal surface of an epithelial cell (~25 µm2). Scale bar = 10 µm."
