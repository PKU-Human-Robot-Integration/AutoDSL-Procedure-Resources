    "All procedures need to be approved by the local ethics committee and adhered to the European Union guidelines on animal care as well as the national law on the protection of animals.\nNOTE: Each experimenter involved in this procedure must be trained in basic surgical procedures and has to obtain a valid license for performing animal experiments.\n1. Anesthesia\nAnesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (an initial dose of 60 mg·kg-1).\nAfter approximately 5 min, check the depth of anesthesia by pinching the rat’s ear or forelimb with blunt forceps. Go to the next steps of the protocol only when no reflex action is observed.\nDuring the surgery, check the animal for reflex actions every 10-15 minutes and supplement anesthesia if the animal responds to a pinch with movement (usually, 10 mg·kg-1·h-1 sodium pentobarbital, IP).\n2. Surgery\nPrepare the animal for the surgical procedure by shaving the fur over the left hindlimb from the heel to the hip (the first segment, muscle and nerve isolation), the right hindlimb from the heel to the hip (the second segment, ground electrode), and the backside from the tail to the thoracic segments (the third segment, laminectomy). Antiseptic is not necessary because of the acute nature of the experiment.\n\t\nPlace the rat on its abdomen on a heating pad (37 °C ± 1 °C.)\nLaminectomy\n\t\nUsing sharp-blunt scissors, cut the skin along the spinal column from the sacrum up to the thoracic vertebrae.\nSeparate the skin from the underlying muscles.\nUsing blunt tip scissors, cut out the longissimus muscle on both sides of the sacrum and lumbar spinous processes.",
    "Identify the S1 vertebra as the lowest segment. Using sharp-blunt scissors, cut and remove the spinous processes from L6 to L2 vertebrae. Next, using fine rongeurs, remove the transverse processes L6-L2 and perform a laminectomy over L6 – L2 segments (first transverse processes, then lamina, begin with L6 vertebral segment) to expose the lumbar segments of the spinal cord covered by the dura mater. Be careful not to cut the sacral bone and L1 spinous process, which will be used as a fixation point for animal immobilization.\nUsing sharp scissors, cut the spinal cord (its caudal fragment) and the dorsal and ventral roots at L2 vertebrae segment level, at the upper border of laminectomy. Place small pieces of dried gel foam to stop bleeding. Next, place a thin, saline-soaked cotton wool over the exposed spinal cord segments.\nIsolation of medial gastrocnemius muscle and its nerve\n\t\nUsing sharp-blunt scissors, make a longitudinal cut on the posterior side of the left hind limb, from the Achilles tendon to the hip.\nGrasp the skin with the forceps and separate the skin from the underlying muscles on both sides of the incision.\nLocate the popliteal fossa at the back of the knee joint, which is covered by the biceps femoris muscle. Using scissors, make a cut between the anterior and posterior part of this muscle.\nMoving upwards, cut the two heads of the biceps femoris all the way to the hip to expose the sciatic nerve.\nUsing blunt forceps and scissors, separate the lateral from the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle and cut the distal insertion (Achilles tendon) of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Preserve the fragment of Achilles tendon as long as possible in order to use it to connect to the force transducer.",
    "Identify the medial gastrocnemius (MG) nerve. Using the forceps and scissors, cut all remaining collaterals of the sciatic nerve, including collaterals to posterior biceps and semitendinosus. Leave the supply blood vessels to the medial gastrocnemius intact.\nThread a non-elastic ligature through the Achilles tendon and make three knots.\nPlace a saline-soaked piece of cotton wool under the exposed nerve and muscle.\nUsing serrated forceps, close the skin over the operated area.\nUsing sharp-blunt scissors, make a 2 cm incision in the skin and underlying connective tissue along the anterior side of the left hind limb for immobilization with a metal clamp (3.1.6.).\n3. Preparation for the recording and stimulation\nVertebral column and leg fixation and muscle arrangement\n\t\nUsing a steel clamp, fix the left hind limb by putting the clamp on the tibia.\nPlace the rat in the custom-made adjustable frame (isolated copper wire, 1 mm), pull up the skin flaps around the laminectomy using four ligatures and suture the skin to the frame in order to form a pool for paraffin oil (size approximately 50 mm x 50 mm) over the exposed spinal cord.\nUsing a Dumont #55 forceps, lift the dura mater at the intersection of the spinal cord, cut it caudally up to the sacral bone and retract it.\nUsing a blunt glass rod, separate left and right dorsal and ventral roots at successive levels, taking care not to damage them.\nFill the pool over the spinal cord with warm (37 °C) paraffin oil, covering the exposed ventral and dorsal roots.",
    "Place the rat on the custom-made aluminum plate (length 260 mm, width 120 mm, height 80 mm) with a pool (length 135 mm, width 100 mm, depth 45 mm) for his hindlimbs connected to the closed-loop heating system. The plate is a place where the animal will be immobilized and the experiment will be performed.\nFix the clamp put on the left hindlimb with the metal bar to immobilize the hindimb.\nFix the vertebral column by putting steel clamps at the sacral bone and the L1 vertebra to immobilize the animal body and eliminate the artefacts in force recordings related to respiratory movements.\nConnect the left medial gastrocnemius muscle with the non-elastic ligature to the force transducer (with compliance of 50 μm/250 mN, measurement range 0-1000 mN) via the Achilles tendon.\nFill the chamber for hindlimbs with warm (37 °C) paraffin oil to cover the medial gastrocnemius muscle and maintain the oil temperature at 37 °C ± 1 °C using the temperature probe and the automatic system.\nPlacement of electrodes for action potentials recording and stimulation\n\t\nInsert a bipolar silver-wire electrode through the middle part of the medial gastrocnemius muscle, perpendicular to its long axis. Maintain about 5 mm distance between the two electrodes located along a long axis of the muscle. These electrodes will be used to record motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). Connect the electrodes to the low-noise amplifier.\nStretch the operated muscle to a passive tension of 100 mN, controlled by the force transducer. For rat medial gastrocnemius at this stretch the MUs of three types develop the highest twitch force15.\nUsing sharp-blunt scissors, make a 2 cm incision in the skin of the right hind limb and insert a silver-wire electrode to be used as a reference electrode.",
    "Place and fix a custom-made insulated metal plate (size 30 mm x 13 mm) above the exposed spinal roots. Put left pairs of ventral and dorsal roots (L4, L5 and L6) on the plate.\nAdd saline to the pool formed by the skin around the laminectomy. The saline level should be below the insulated plate.\nPlace a silver wire stimulating electrode (two silver wires, 0.5 mm diameter, length 50 mm) over the exposed spinal roots, place a positive pole 3 mm above the plate in oil, whereas the negative pole in the saline (added to the pool, below the plate) and connect to the stimulator.\n4. Motor unit recordings\nStimulating with electrical rectangular pulses (0.1 ms duration, amplitude up to 0.5 V), select the ventral roots (L4, L5 and L6); ventral root stimulation evokes contraction of muscles whereas there is no such effect for dorsal roots. Eliminate dorsal roots from the plate. For the medial gastrocnemius, most axons are in the L5 ventral root.\nUsing a pair of Dumont #55 forceps and magnifying glasses, split L5 or L4 ventral roots into very ﬁne bundles of axons (grasp the cut end of the ventral rootlet with both forceps and peel the rootlet apart); place one of these bundles on a silver wire electrode and stimulate (0.1 ms rectangular pulses of amplitude up to 0.5 V) to achieve activity of a single MU. A solid support (metal bar) is very useful for manipulating thin bundles of axons, which can be used as a hand support for using forceps. Note also that an additional source of light is necessary.",
    "By progressively increasing the intensity of the stimulus, identify a single MU on the basis of the evoked “all-or-none” character of the twitch contraction and action potential stimulus. Carefully test the evoked activity at a stimulation around the threshold.\n\t\nWhen more than one MU is contracting in the studied muscle and increasing level of the force as well as increasing amplitude or changing shape of the action potential are visible, go back to step 4.2 and split the bundle of axons again. Note that the strongest MUs in rat medial gastrocnemius have about 70 times larger twitch force than the weakest ones and when very strong MU is twitching the second, weak MU may be not evident. Note also that some MUs have their muscle fibers located out of the recording area of the electrode and are not visible in electromyogram; in such a case changes in the stimulus amplitude may have effect in the force but not in action potential.\nStimulate a motor unit with a stimulation protocol necessary for the aim of experiment. For a basic stimulation protocol necessary to calculate all basic motor unit contractile and action potentials properties, include the following.\n\t\nInclude 5 stimuli at 1 Hz (5 single twitches recorded and averaged; averaging is eliminating noise, which is especially important for the weakest MUs).\nInclude a series of stimuli at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100 and 150 Hz frequencies with a duration of 500 ms (these recordings enable calculation of the force-frequency relationship, the maximum tetanic force at 150 Hz as well as the sag at 20-40 Hz stimulation).\nInclude the fatigue test (tetani evoked by trains of 14 stimuli at 40 Hz frequency, repeated every second for 4 minutes).",
    "Include at least 10 s time intervals between all the elements of the protocol above.\nRepeat the process with successive isolated motor units.\nTerminate the experiment and euthanize the animal using intraperitoneal administration of a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium (180 mg·kg-1).\n5. Electronic apparatus\nNOTE: The custom-made computer program controls the stimulator, providing the possibility to create variable patterns of stimulation, including those indicated in step 4.4. The program cooperates with the analog-to-digital converter (at least 10 kHz for the MUAP and force recordings).\nConnect the AC amplifier to the computer by the analog-to-digital converter and in parallel to the oscilloscope.\nConnect the force transducer to the computer by the analog-to-digital converter and in parallel to the oscilloscope. Use the force transducer to control the passive muscle force during experiment. Note that during experiment, the passive force may decrease; therefore, it is necessary to increase the muscle length to keep the passive muscle force constant.\nSubscription Required.
