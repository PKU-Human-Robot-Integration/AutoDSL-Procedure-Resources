  "procedures": [
    "The initial step to take advantage of the LIPSTIC approach to track cell-cell interactions is to select a ligand and receptor pair and to design their modification with G5 and SrtA tags. The selection of a ligand and receptor pair depends on the biological question that will be addressed; nevertheless, there are a few technical aspects that should be taken into account. First, the G5 tag must be present at the N-terminus of the molecule of interest; thus type II membrane proteins (with the C-terminus present at their extracellular portion) are not possible candidates for this modification. Second, SrtA fusion (which in contrast with the G5 tag can be both at the C- or N-terminus of the molecule of interest) might interfere with protein folding. Even if we successfully fused SrtA to several immune receptors with different structures, favoring single-pass monomeric receptors for SrtA modification might increase the possibility of success.\nOnce a ligand and receptor pair has been selected, we propose the following workflow to design LIPSTIC-engineered molecules. As an example, we perform the workflow for the murine interacting molecules CD40 and CD40L.\n1. Identify the correct gene symbol for the ligand and receptor of interest at https://www.genenames.org[href=https://www.genenames.org].\nOther databases can be used for this purpose. The correct gene symbols for our example are CD40 and CD40LG.\n2. Identify and download the coding nucleotide sequence of the gene of interest at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov] by browsing the nucleotide database.\nIt is necessary to specify the correct gene symbol and species.",
    "The correct nucleotide coding sequences corresponding to CD40 and CD40LG genes in Mus musculus are identified by accession numbers M83312.1 and NM_011616.2, respectively. We recommend the use of molecular biology software for the annotation and manipulation of nucleic acid and protein sequences. We currently employ SeqBuilderPro (Lasergene), but equivalent alternatives are available (e.g., SnapGene).\n3. If not known, predict the membrane topology of the protein of interest and, if present, the cleavage site of the signal peptide at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-6.0[href=https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-6.0].\nFor CD40, cleavage of the signal peptide occurs between C in position 23 and V in position 24. Results of CD40 sequence analysis provided by the SignalP platform are shown in Supplementary Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#support-information-section].\n4. For the engineering of G5-tagged construct, insert the coding sequence of G5 residues and of the Myc tag immediately after the signal peptide cleavage site (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-fig-0002]).\nThe insertion of a Myc tag will facilitate detection of the engineered construct.\nG5, Myc tag, and the correctly assembled G5-Myc-CD40 coding sequences are available in Supplementary Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#support-information-section].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/813f437a-96fd-4f6a-9ef8-191a3916b4a0/cpz1311-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Schematic representation of LIPSTIC-engineered molecules and cloning vectors. (A) Five glycine (G5)-tagged molecules are designed to carry a five glycine tag at their extracellular N-terminal portion. Based on this requirement, only type I membrane proteins (i.e., proteins with the N-terminus exposed on their extracellular moiety) are eligible for this modification. The coding sequence of the G5 tag should be preceded by the coding sequence of a signal peptide to allow correct membrane topology and followed by the coding sequence of Myc tag to enable construct detection. (B) Sortase A (SrtA)-tagged molecules are designed to carry SrtA at their extracellular portion. Depending on the topology of the molecule to be engineered, SrtA can be added at the N-terminus (type I proteins) or at the C-terminus (type II proteins). In the first case, the coding sequence of SrtA should be proceeded by the coding sequence of a signal peptide and a FLAG tag and should be followed by a linker. In the second case, the protein of interest will be genetically fused to a linker, SrtA, and FLAG tag. (C) Schematic representation of Gibson assembly cloning strategy. DNA inserts are modified to carry at both ends a 20-bp overlap with the receiving vector. The receiving linear vector is generated by PCR amplification. Combination of insert and vector with Gibson assembly enzyme mix will lead to the generation a circular plasmid. (D and E) Schematic representation of retroviral vectors allowing the expression of G5 (D) and SrtA (E) fusion constructs. In all three vectors, the coding sequence of the LIPSTIC-engineered protein of interest is preceded by the coding sequence of a fluorescent protein (eGFP or Tomato) and of the P2A peptide, which thanks to ribosome skipping allows for the expression of two distinct protein products from a single transcript.",
    "5. For the engineering of SrtA fusion construct in type I membrane proteins, insert the coding sequences of FLAG tag, SrtA, and a linker immediately after the signal peptide cleavage site. For the engineering the SrtA fusion construct in type II membrane proteins, insert the coding sequence of a linker, SrtA, and FLAG tag immediately before the STOP codon of the protein of interest (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-fig-0002]).\nThe insertion of a FLAG tag will facilitate detection of the engineered construct, while the linker between the protein of interest and SrtA will facilitate correct folding.\nFLAG tag, SrtA, linker, and the correctly assembled CD40L-linker-SrtA-FLAG coding sequences are available in Supplementary Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#support-information-section].\nAt the end of this protocol, the investigator should have assembled the complete coding sequences of the G5- and SrtA-tagged molecules. We recommend verifying that all coding sequences are assembled in frame and contain a STOP codon at the 3′ end.",
    "Once the design of LIPSTIC-engineered molecules has been completed according to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-prot-0001], it is necessary to clone the coding sequences of interest into expression vectors. We use retroviral vectors derived from pMP71 (Engels et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-bib-0006]), which were initially developed to achieve high transduction efficiency and robust transgene expression in T cells. In our hands these vectors perform very well for the transduction of primary mouse B and CD4+ T lymphocytes but can also be employed for the transfection of other cell types. To clone the designed sequences into pMP71 vectors, we recommend employing a Gibson assembly cloning strategy (Gibson et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-bib-0008]). With this approach, it is sufficient to generate DNA fragments with 20-bp overlaps with the vector and to incubate them in the presence of a combination of 5′ exonuclease, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase to obtain the assembled DNA product (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-fig-0002]). Importantly, we modified pMP71 vectors to express a fluorescent protein followed by the P2A peptide, which induces ribosome skipping during translation (Kim et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-bib-0012]). We refer to these vectors as pMP71-GFP-P2A and pMP71-Tomato-P2A. Insertion of the desired construct after the P2A sequence allows the expression of two distinct protein products (in our case the fluorescent reporter and the LIPSTIC-engineered molecule) from the same transcript (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-fig-0002],E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-fig-0002]). Here we describe the step-by-step procedure to generate pMP71 vectors and LIPSTIC inserts with a 20-bp overlap and to rapidly assemble them using Gibson assembly.\nMaterials\nLIPSTIC-engineered molecule (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-prot-0001])\npMP71 vector encoding GFP-P2A or Tomato-P2A coding sequences\n10 mM dNTP mix\nPrimers to amplify pMP71 vectors:\n               \nForward F1: AATTCGAGCATCTTACCGCC\nReverse R1: CGGTCCAGGGTTCTCCTCCA\nLongAmp® Taq DNA Polymerase (e.g., New England BioLabs, cat. no.

We recommend carefully verifying the entire sequence of the insert before proceeding with Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-prot-0003].",
    "Once LIPSTIC-engineered molecules have been cloned into expression vectors, it is necessary to assess a few parameters to validate the novel constructs: (1) cell surface expression; (2) presence of enzymatic activity in SrtA fusion constructs; and (3) interaction-specific LIPSTIC labeling. To evaluate these aspects, we suggest individually transfecting 293T cells with LIPSTIC-engineered ligand and receptors, performing LIPSTIC labeling in vitro, and analyzing cells by flow cytometry. We also recommend including in the assay a control construct, where no interactions are expected, encoding for SrtA fused only to a synthetic transmembrane domain. Plasmid pMP71-Tomato-P2A-SrtA-PDGFR is available from the corresponding author upon request. This protocol informs the investigator on surface expression and activity of the LIPSTIC-engineered constructs and represents the first validation step that should be performed in the development of novel LIPSTIC-engineered ligand and receptor pairs. Representative results of intercellular labeling obtained in 293T cells are shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-fig-0003] and are discussed in the Commentary, Understanding Results.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/23fdddbd-08d5-4525-b3ca-3b51cb306211/cpz1311-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nValidation of LIPSTIC-engineered receptor in vitro. 293T cells were transfected with G5-CD40 (GFP reporter vector), CD40L-SrtA (Tomato reporter vector), or SrtA-PDGFR (Tomato reporter vector) or were left untransfected.

    "The washing step is extremely important since it allows for removing excess biotinylated substrate that, if not properly removed, will quench the anti-biotin antibody used for FACS staining.\n8.

Other instruments can be used to perform the analysis, with a minimum requirement of the ability to measure six fluorescent parameters.\nCompensation setup of the instrument can be performed with compensation beads (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 01-1111-41), untransfected unstained cells, transfected unstained cells, and untransfected single-stained cells.",
    "Once surface expression and functionality of LIPSTIC-engineered molecules have been initially assessed in 293T cells, it is advisable to further characterize the constructs in the context of the target immune cells. Assays with this aim will strongly depend on the molecules involved and on their biological function, and thus it is not possible to provide a one-size-fits-all protocol to guide the investigator in this task. Nevertheless, once the constructs have been characterized, their use to measure interaction ex vivo can follow a simple strategy that we have successfully employed with murine B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells. As a reference, here we provide details on how to measure interactions between primary murine B and T cells. This experimental setup can be exploited to rapidly investigate how the perturbation of choice (e.g., genetic modifications, pharmacological treatments, antigen recognition, nature of the immune stimulation) affects immune interactions. Moreover, cells undergoing interactions can be analyzed phenotypically (e.g., by characterizing cell surface marker expression by flow cytometry) or isolated by FACS sorting for downstream analysis. Representative results are shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-fig-0004] and discussed in the Commentary, Understanding Results.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c5a4a153-0530-4892-ba1d-e04d407512ea/cpz1311-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nMeasuring interaction with LIPSTIC in immune cells ex vivo.

Distribute 2 × 105 cells/well LIPSTIC-engineered B and T cells in a 96-well U-bottom plate in a final volume of 200 μl complete RPMI.\nLIPSTIC-engineered cells can be obtained by retroviral transduction of primary murine B and T lymphocytes, by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, or by isolation from LIPSTIC-engineered mouse strains as in the case of Cd40G5 and Cd40lgSrtA animals. Detailed protocols for all these procedures have been previously published (see Current Protocols article: Huang, Johansen, & Schwartzberg, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-bib-0010]; Lee, Sadelain, & Brentjens, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-bib-0014]; Pasqual, Chudnovskiy, & Victora, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-bib-0026]). The investigator should be aware that the retroviral constructs described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.311#cpz1311-prot-0001] are ideal for retroviral transduction of primary murine B and T lymphocytes, allowing for high transduction rates.\nWe recommend a 1:1 ratio between B and T cells.\nSeeding cells on a 96-well U-bottom plate will favor the concentration of cells on a small surface. Despite the high density reached by the cells in this setup, we observed that labeling specificity is not affected. Alternatively, 96-well flat-bottom plates or other larger formats can be employed if a larger number of cells are available for testing.\n2. At the desired time point, add 20 μl/well of 1.1 mM biotin-LPETG solution in RPMI to a final concentration of 100 μM/well.\nIf working in this format, it is not necessary to mix or resuspend the cells upon addition of the substrate.",
    "The choice of timing depends on the kinetics of the interaction, which will be monitored. As a reference, when tracking the CD40-CD40L interaction, we co-culture cells for a minimum of 6 hr to a maximum of 24 hr before adding SrtA substrate.\n3. To allow for the SrtA labeling reaction, incubate co-culture in the presence of the substrate for 30 min at 37°C.\n4. Wash cells three times with cold PBE to remove excess substrate. Perform washing as follows: Centrifuge plate 5 min at 300 × g, 4°C, and discard supernatant by firmly inverting the plate. Then resuspend cells in 200 μl PBE.\nWashing and subsequent FACS staining can be performed directly in the 96-well plate as detailed. This approach is convenient when a large number of conditions are being analyzed. Alternatively, when the SrtA labeling reaction is terminated, cells can be transferred to tubes and washed and stained in this format.\n5. After the last wash, resuspend cells in 50 μl/well PBE containing 2 μg/ml Fc block. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\n6. Add 50 μl/well of 2× antibody staining mix.\nThe final dilutions of the antibody are as follows: 1:50 anti-biotin-APC, 1:400 anti-CD4-BV421, and 1:400 anti-CD19-PE-Cy7.\n7. Incubate sample 15 min at 4°C.\n8. Wash cells two times with cold PBE, and resuspend cells in 200 μl PBE.\nIf the cells are not analyzed the same day, the samples can be fixed in 2% (w/v) formaldehyde. Fixed samples are stable for at least 1 week if stored at 4°C.\n9. Analyze samples by flow cytometry."
