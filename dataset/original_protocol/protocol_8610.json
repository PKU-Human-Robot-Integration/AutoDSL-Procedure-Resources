    "Note: General overview of the experimental design: The experimental design includes an adapted protocol for courtship suppression7-9 in which male flies are exposed to rewarding and nonrewarding experiences in 3 consecutive training sessions over the course of 4 d. At the end of the experience phase, the flies are tested in a two-choice voluntary ethanol consumption assay for 3 - 4 d. The protocol herein includes several preparatory steps, some of which can be done in advance to be used in more than one experiment, while others should take place in a timely manner before the beginning of the experiment (Table 1).\n1. Preparatory Steps\nPreparing the capillary feeder system\n\t\nHeat a 27 G needle and use it to puncture small holes along a vial (Figure 1).\nCut the vial plug in half (crosswise) using a razor blade. Mark four points on the surface of the plug, creating a square shape to position the capillary holders into. Use an 18 G needle to make 4 holes through the plug (Figure 1b).\nUse a razor blade to cut micropipets so that they can firmly hold 5 µL glass capillaries, which serve as adaptors.\nInsert 4 capillary adaptors into the prepared plugs.\nMark the position of the 2 ethanol- and two nonethanol-containing capillaries on the plug.\n\t\tNote: It is recommended to keep the positions of the 2 types of capillaries consistent across all vials. Pay attention to the size of the holes, as large holes allow the escape of flies out of the vials. In addition, it is recommended to use the smoother side of the plug (usually opposite the cut side) as the side that faces down when inserted into the vial, as cutting the plug creates some small, loose fibers that the flies can get tangled in.",
    "Prepare a large number of vials and adaptors to be used for the capillary feeder system (CAFE) experiments described in step 2.3.\nPreparing small glass food vials\n\t\nA day before collecting the flies (step 1.4), arrange 200 glass vials on microcentrifuge tube racks. Melt fly food (according to the cornmeal molasses recipe, see the Table of Materials) using a microwave. Pour 2 mL of fly food into the glass vials (try not to smear the food on the vial walls). Let the food harden, and cover the vials with plastic wrap.\n\t\tNOTE: The glass vials containing the food can be kept at 4 °C for several weeks.\nOn the day of fly collection, take the vials out of the refrigerator and let them reach RT before using them to house flies.\n\t\tNOTE: If food vials are several weeks old, make sure that the food is still intact and not detached from the vial, as flies can be trapped in the cracks between the food and the glass.\nMaking stock food solution for the capillary feeder assay\n\t\nTo prepare the stock food solution (5% sucrose and 5% yeast extract), dissolve 5.88 g of yeast extract and 5.88 g of sucrose in 100 mL of distilled water.\n\t\tNOTE: The stock solution is highly prone to contamination. Therefore, it is recommended to autoclave it (121 °C, 30 min, and without a drying cycle) and aliquot it into 850 µL working aliquots to be kept at 4 °C until further use. The concentration of the ingredients in the stock solution is 5.88% and will reach the final concentration of 5% after the addition of 15% ethanol or water (150 µL into 850 µL of premade food solution) just before its use in step 2.3.\nCollecting experimental flies",
    "Collect 200 naïve male flies using a CO2 pad.\n\t\tNote: Use any lab strain relevant for the experimental question. 250 flies can be easily collected from five bottles of flies at their eclosion pick phase. When collecting the flies, pay careful attention to collect flies that have recently eclosed (virgin-looking flies: bright flies with a meconium spot on their abdomen). Experimental flies should be kept singly in small glass vials containing food and aged to 3 - 4 d old before being used in the experiment.\nUse soft plugs to close the vials.\n\t\tNOTE: The same soft plugs will be very useful for the training phase when using mouth aspiration to insert females into and out of the vials during the experience phase.\nCollecting trainer flies\n\tNOTE: All collected flies should be kept in a 12 h/12 h light/dark incubator at 25 °C and 70% Relative Humidity (RH). The 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle can be changed to a convenient starting time.\n\t\nVirgin female trainer flies\n\t\t\nCollect 500 virgin female trainer flies from a WT stock or a virginator stock for use as virgin receptive females. Keep the female flies in groups of 25 per regular-size food vial, and allow them to age to 3 - 4 d old before using them in the experiment.\nMated female trainer flies\n\t\t\nCollect 300 virgin female flies from a WT stock or a virginator stock to undergo mating before the training phase (step 1.6.1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Female flies are kept in groups of 10 females per regular-size food vial and aged to 3 - 4 d old before being used in the experiment.\nMale flies used to generate mated female trainer flies\n\t\t\nCollect 150 male flies (not necessarily virgin).",
    "NOTE: Flies are kept in groups of 15 males per regular-size food vial and aged to 3 - 4 d old before being paired with virgin female flies to create the mated trainer females.\nGenerating mated female trainer flies\n\t\nTo generate mated female flies to be used as trainers, pair groups of 10 virgin female flies with 15 male flies by flipping one male-containing vial into a female-containing vial 16 - 18 h before the training phase (step 2.1)10.\n\t\tNOTE: This should normally take place the evening before the training session. The 1.5:1 ratio between male flies to female flies assures that all females will be mated.\nOn the day of the experiment, separate the mated females from the males by aspirating the males out of the vial using a mouth aspirator. Perform this right before the beginning of each training day.\n2. Experimental Steps\nSetting up the experience phase\n\t\nStart the experiment as close as possible to the beginning of the light phase in the incubator. Place the trainer females (both virgin and mated) in the behavior chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to perform the experiment in a behavior chamber, or any secluded environment that is quiet and set to 25 °C and 60 - 65% RH. Keeping humidity over 50% is very important, since courtship and mating behaviors depend on pheromone sensing, which is known to be sensitive to humidity.\nExposing male flies to rewarding and nonrewarding experiences\n\t\nArrange the glass vials containing the single male flies on microcentrifuge racks, positioning the vials along the margins of the rack.\n\t\tNOTE: This arrangement allows the experimenter to easily observe the pairs of flies that undergo copulation without taking the vials out of the rack.",
    "Prepare (as described in step 2.2.1) 2 groups of 100 glass vials containing single male flies on separate racks for males undergoing rewarding and nonrewarding mating experiences (i.e. rejected and mated).\nAspirate trainer females and add them to each vial containing the male flies. Set the timer for 1 h. Starting with the rejected group, add a mated female to each vial. Then, move on to the males to be mated and add a virgin female to each vial.\nWatch the mating encounters closely to make sure that the males interacting with virgin females mate successfully within the first hour and that the males interacting with the previously-mated females do not mate. To monitor the rejected cohort over the course of 1 h, set a second timer for 15 min and watch the males every 15 min.\nDischarge the males from the rejected cohort that managed to mate and males from the mated cohort that did not end up mating by the end of the first training session.\nFinish the first training session by aspirating out the previously-mated female trainers into a regular fly food vial, and keep them for the next conditioning session. Follow this step by gently aspirating the females from the mated male group.\nLet the flies rest for 1 h.\nRepeat steps 2.2.3 - 2.2.7 twice.\nRepeat the training session in steps 2.2.3 - 2.2.8 each day for 3 more d.\nRecording consumption (CAFE)",
    "At the end of the last conditioning session (fourth day), aspirate the single males and group them into the capillary feeder vials. Use a soft plug to cover the capillary feeder vial while inserting the flies, and replace it quickly with the ready-made capillary feeder plug after all the flies have been inserted. Group 6 - 8 flies from each of the experimental groups into a vial, creating no less than 8 vials per condition.\nWet the plugs by gently adding 5 mL of water to the top of the plug. Be careful while adding the water to avoid spillage into the vials. Add equal amount of water to each vial.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is done to reduce evaporation from the capillaries. Therefore, it is repeated every day for the rest of the experiment. Depending on the relative humidity, the following days may require less water to be added to the plugs.\nPrepare two separate food solutions by adding ethanol or water to the stock food aliquots to create a final concentration of 15%.\nTo fill the capillaries with the two food solutions, create 5 µL liquid food drops on a laboratory film strip and allow the solution to fill the capillary until it reaches the 5 µL mark. Make sure to use the clear end of the capillary, which is close to the 5 µL black mark line.\n\t\tNOTE: To fill several capillaries at once, it is possible to connect 6 - 8 capillary adaptors together and use them as an insert to hold the capillaries.\nTap the capillaries gently on the paraffin strip to position the food solution exactly at the black mark. Seal the capillaries by dipping the end of each capillary into small drops of mineral oil. This step minimizes potential evaporation of the food solution.",
    "Insert two ethanol-containing capillaries and two nonethanol containing capillaries through the 4 adaptors/holders in the plug until the exposed sides of the capillaries barely peek from the interior of the vial (1 mm or less from the plug surface).\n\t\tNOTE: Keeping the opening of the capillaries close to the wet plug reduces evaporation and allows easy access to the food, as flies normally sit on the plugs and climb down on the exposed capillary to feed.\nIn addition to vials that contain experimental flies, prepare a mock vial without flies. This control serves to assess natural evaporation.\n\t\tNOTE: Try to maintain relatively equal positioning of the capillary opening compared to the plugs, as differences can lead to variable evaporation and to misleading consumption data. Maintain adequate humidity during the experiment and position the capillary openings as closely as possible to the wet plug, as low humidity and large distance from the wet plug can both result in uncontrolled evaporation.\nRecord the relative position of the liquid in each of the capillaries with respect to the black mark line in mm using a ruler, and write these values down.\n\t\tNOTE: If the solution is positioned exactly at the black line, the value should equal zero, and if it is above or below, it should be positive or negative values, respectively. The initial levels of the liquid set the reference points for the final O/N consumption values.\nSet the vials back in the incubator for 24 h. Replace the capillaries at a constant time throughout the entire experiment.\nRemove the capillaries gently from the vials and measure the levels of liquid with respect to the black marking line.\nCarefully check the liquid level in the mock vial.",
    "NOTE: If the levels dropped more than 2 mm, it indicates that evaporation is high and the consumption levels are not reliable.\nDampen the plugs gently with 2 mL of water and insert a new set of capillaries, as indicated in steps 2.3.3 - 2.3.10. Set the vials back in the incubator for 24 h.\nDetermining preference\n\t\nCalculate the total consumption of each capillary by subtracting the final level from the initial level at the starting point.\nCombine the values of both capillaries with the same food (i.e. nonethanol capillaries separately from ethanol-containing capillaries).\nCalculate ethanol preference by subtracting the amount consumed from the non-ethanol capillaries from the amount consumed from the ethanol-containing capillaries and divide the value by the total consumption values from all the capillaries of the same vial.\nAverage the preference indexes of all vials of the same experimental group.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54910/54910equation1.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Nonethanol 1 (NE1), Nonethanol 2 (NE2), Ethanol 1 (E1), Ethanol 2 (E2), Total nonethanol (Total NE) = NE1 + NE2, Total ethanol (Total E) = E1 + E2, Total sum consumption (Total Sum) = Total NE + Total E, and Ethanol preference Index (PI)\nSubscription Required.
