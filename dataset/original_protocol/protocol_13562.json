    "This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College of Stomatology, Xi'an Jiaotong University (xjkqll[2022]NO.034). Informed consent was available from the patients involved in this study.\n1. Adjunctive diode laser therapy in the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis\nEligibility criteria\n\t\nUse the following inclusion criteria: age ≥ 18 years; probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥ 5 mm; detectable clinical attachment loss (CAL) and radiographic bone loss (RBL).\nUse the following exclusion criteria: patients with systematic diseases or under medication that may affect the inflammation and healing process; patients who had received periodontal treatment within 6 months; smokers or alcoholics; pregnant or lactating patients; periodontal-endodontic combined lesions; class III tooth mobility.\nClinical examination\n\t\nMeasure full-mouth PPD, bleeding on probing (BOP) at six sites per tooth (i.e., mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, distolingual, lingual, and mesiolingual), and mobility of each tooth, excluding third molars. Measure CAL for teeth with PPD ≥ 5 mm. Detect the cementoenamel junction by probing to calculate the CAL.\nRecord the baseline parameters on a periodontal chart (Supplementary File 1).\nDisinfection and anesthesia\n\t\nGargle with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 1 min, followed by pure water. Disinfect the operating area with 1% iodophor. Administer a local injection of primacaine adrenaline for anesthesia.\nMechanical debridement by scaling and root planing (SRP)\n\tNOTE: SRP is necessary for treating periodontitis including ultrasonic or manual cleaning. Dental scaling removes the plaque and calculus from the surface of the tooth above and below the gumline. Root planing usually follows dental scaling and attempts to smooth out the rough surface of the root and helps the gums to reattach to the teeth.",
    "Firstly, use an ultrasonic device to perform SRP for teeth with PPD > 3 mm. Secondly, use hand-held instruments (Gracey curettes 5/6, 7/8, 11/12, and 13/14) to perform SRP for teeth with PPD > 3 mm (Figure 1). Thirdly, use an ultrasonic device to perform SRP for these teeth a second time.\n\t\tNOTE: The diode laser alone is not effective in eliminating calculus, so a thorough SRP cannot be omitted. If the patient has a large number of affected teeth, only one quadrant can be treated at each appointment. The ultrasonic and manual SRP can be performed within 1-4 appointments.\nRinse the periodontal pockets with 3% hydrogen peroxide and gargle with pure water.\nApply polishing paste to the teeth surface, polish the full-mouth teeth surfaces using a low-speed handpiece with a rubber cap, and then gargle with pure water.\nAdjunctive diode laser therapy\n\tNOTE: Choose teeth with PPD ≥ 5 mm for laser treatment. Choose one of the following two usage modes (i.e., steps 1.5.1 or 1.5.2).\n\t\nInside pocket laser irradiation (only one session of laser appointment per tooth is suggested) (Figure 2A).\n\t\t\nEnsure that both the operator and patient wear protective goggles to protect the eyes from laser damage.\nPrepare the diode laser device (wavelength = 980 nm, output power = 1 W, power density = 1414.7 W/cm2, continuous wave, 300 µm fiber optic delivery system).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Improperly increasing the power may cause thermal damage; please consult the laser manufacturer and follow the manufacturer's instructions before use.\nCalibrate the length of the fiber tip exposed to 1 mm less than the measured PPD (Figure 2B).",
    "NOTE: To prevent bleeding due to the insertion of the fiber tip too deep into the periodontal pocket, it is generally recommended that the exposed fiber tip length is 1 mm less than the measured periodontal pocket depth.\nGently insert the fiber tip into the periodontal pocket 1 mm less than the measured PPD, and slowly sweep the tip both in mesial-distal and apical-coronal directions for 30 s per tooth (Figure 2B,C).\n\t\t\tNOTE: During this process, inserting the fiber too deeply into the periodontal pocket can irritate periodontal bleeding and thus prevent the laser from acting. Remove the granulation attached to the fiber tip using a cotton ball containing 75% alcohol to avoid jeopardizing the laser effectiveness.\nOutside pocket laser irradiation (a total of 3-5 sessions of laser appointments per tooth is suggested) (Figure 3A).\n\t\t\nEnsure that both the operator and patient wear protective goggles to protect the eyes from laser damage.\nPrepare the diode laser device (wavelength = 980 nm, output power = 0.4 W, power density = 566.2 W/cm2, continuous wave, 300 µm fiber optic delivery system).\nIrradiate the gingival surface of the pocket for approximately 15 s per pocket, with the laser fiber tip 5 mm (2-10 mm) away from the gingival surface and directed at an angle of 90° (Figure 3B,C).\nRepeat the same outside pocket laser treatment after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days.\nGive oral hygiene instruction (OHI) to each patient, including Bass brushing technique, interdental floss, and brush19.\nClinical examination\n\t\nMeasure the PPD, CAL, and BOP for each tooth 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after periodontal treatment. Record the postoperative parameters on a new periodontal chart (Supplementary File 1).\nCompare the baseline and postoperative parameters.\n2. Adjunctive probiotic therapy in the nonsurgical treatment of peri-implant mucositis (Figure 4A)\nEligibility criteria",
    "Use the following inclusion criteria: age ≥ 18 years; at least one implant with erythema, swelling, suppuration, or BOP in the peri-implant mucosa; radiographic bone loss (RBL) < 2 mm.\nUse the following exclusion criteria: peri-implantitis (RBL ≥ 2 mm); implants with mobility; patients with systematic diseases or under medication that may affect the inflammation and healing process; patients who had received periodontal treatment within 6 months; smokers or alcoholics; pregnant or lactating patients.\nClinical examination\n\t\nMeasure the clinical parameters PPD, BOP at six sites per implant (i.e., mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, distolingual, lingual, and mesiolingual), and plaque index (PI) at four sites per implant (i.e., mesial, buccal, distal, and lingual).\nRecord the baseline parameters on a periodontal chart (Supplementary File 1).\nFor disinfection, gargle with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 1 min, followed by pure water.\nMechanical debridement by supragingival scaling\n\t\nUse a titanium ultrasound tip to perform supragingival scaling for the mucositis implants, adjusting the mode to medium power (Figure 4B). Rinse the pockets with 3% hydrogen peroxide, and then gargle with pure water.\n\t\tNOTE: Supragingival scaling removes the plaque and calculus from the surface of the implant denture above the gumline.\nProfessional administration of probiotic\n\t\nGrind the probiotic tablet into powder using a sterilized mortar (Figure 4C).\n\t\tNOTE: If there are lumpy particles in the powder, they can easily clog the syringe.\nMake a solution of probiotic powder and sterile saline in a 1:3 ratio (Figure 4D). Deliver the probiotic solution into the peri-implant sulcus using a 5 mL syringe with a blunted and soft tip (Figure 4E).\nHome administration of probiotics\n\t\nInstruct the patients to dissolve one tablet for approximately 10 min in the oral cavity every 12 h, twice a day for 1 month (Figure 4A).",
    "Give OHI to each patient, including Bass brushing technique, interdental floss, and brush19.\nClinical examination\n\t\nMeasure the PPD, PI, and BOP for each implant 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment. Record the postoperative parameters on a new periodontal chart (Supplementary File 1).\nCompare the baseline and postoperative parameters.\nSubscription Required.
