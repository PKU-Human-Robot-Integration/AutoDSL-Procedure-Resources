    "1. Growing the plants and root preparation\nOption 1: Prepare adventitious roots from stem.\n\t\nTake a rooting tray for growing plants.\nFill the tray with soil.\nAdd one seed of M82 tomato cultivar to each cell in the tray.\nCover the seeds with a little soil.\nWater the tray from the bottom with a dropper as the water fills the bottom of the tray and the soil absorbs water.\nAdd 2 mL of fertilizer per 1 L of water to the bottom of the tray once a week.\nGrow in a growing chamber at 25 °C.\nUse lighting conditions of 9 h light (7:00-16:00) alternated with 15 h of darkness.\nAfter 3 weeks remove the plant from the soil.\nCut the root system from the plant at the point of interaction with the stem.\nPut the rootless plant in a beaker filled with water.\nAfter a few days, cut the adventitious roots that emerge from the stem and use them for replication.\nOption 2: Prepare seed germinating roots.\n\t\nWet a Petri dish sized filter paper with water.\nPut several M82 seeds (no more than 10) on the paper, inside a Petri dish.\nIncubate the plate at 25 °C.\nHydrate the paper every day.\nAfter germinated roots are long enough (approximately 5 days), remove the seeds and use the roots for replication.\n2. Preparation of the root negative replica from polyurethane\nTo generate negative replica solution, add 9.49 g of diurethane dimethacrylate to a 20 mL vial.\n\t\nAdd 1.45 mL of ethyl methacrylate to the vial.\nStir at room temperature (RT) until the solution looks clear and becomes homogeneous.\n\t\tNOTE: Approximately 2 h is sufficient to reach a homogeneous solution.\nAdd 3 mL of the plasticizer, diethyl phthalate, and stir for 1 h at RT.",
    "NOTE: Diethyl phthalate is miscible in acrylate monomer.\nAdd 300 µL of the photo initiator, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone, and stir overnight at RT. Continue stirring until all bubbles are removed.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. The solution can be kept at RT.\nTo generate the negative replica of the root, take a clean glass slide and pour 1 mL of the negative replica solution on it.\n\t\nPlace 2‒3 roots over the solution. Do not allow the roots to be fully covered by the solution.\nKeep the slide under 8 W ultra violet (UV) lamp for 8‒10 min. Do not keep the solution under UV light for too long.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important not to keep the solution under the UV light for too long as it makes the polyurethane too hard, making it impossible to remove the root.\nSwitch off the UV lamp, remove the replica from the glass slide and put it in a Petri dish filled with ethanol, to remove unreacted monomer.\nTo obtain the negative replica, remove the root from the replica very slowly using forceps.\n3. Prepare the root positive replica from PDMS.\nTo generate the mixture for the positive replica, place 10 g of dimethyl siloxane in a paper cup.\n\t\nAdd 1 g of curing agent and mix thoroughly.\nKeep the mixture in a desiccator under vacuum for 2 h to remove air bubbles.\nTo generate the positive replica, place the polyurethane negative replica in a Petri dish.\n\t\nPour the PDMS mixture on top of the negative replica.\nApply vacuum for 2 h to assure coverage of the microstructure.\nKeep the Petri dish overnight at RT.\nSeparate the cured positive replica from the negative replica by hand.\n4. Prepare the root positive replica from ethyl cellulose.",
    "To generate the ethyl cellulose solution, put 1.32 ml of diethyl pthalate as a plasticizer in a 100 ml cup.\n\t\nAdd 20 mL of ethanol and stir at RT for 2 h.\nAdd 3.3 g of ethyl cellulose and stir overnight.\nTo generate the positive replica, place the polyurethane negative replica in a Petri dish.\n\t\nPour the ethyl cellulose solution on top of the negative replica.\nKeep the Petri dish overnight at RT under the hood.\nRemove the positive replica from the negative replica very slowly by forceps."
