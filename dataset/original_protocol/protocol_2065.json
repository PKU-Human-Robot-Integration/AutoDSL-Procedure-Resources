This prevents the adult flies from sticking to the fly food.\nSolution preparation",
    "The following protocol describes the preparation of 1 mL solutions containing 1 mM or 5 mM or without sucrose with different color dyes. Prepare these solutions just before distributing them on a microtiter plate. Other attractive tastants (e.g., sugars) can also be tested using this assay. To test the tastants (e.g., 25 mM arginine and 100 mM arginine) without sugar, add 1 mM arginine to one colored dye and 25 mM (follow steps 5 and 6) or 100 mM tastants (follow steps 5 and 7) to another colored dye. Similarly, to test the effects of a bitter tastant (e.g., 10 mM caffeine), add the aversive compound to the 5 mM sucrose, which is tested against the 1 mM sucrose alone (follow steps 8 and 9). One color dye should be added to the 1 mM sucrose and the other dye to the 5 mM sucrose. We will also explain below how to prepare 2 mM sucrose alone versus 2 mM sucrose combined with cuc-B (follow steps 10 and 11) or 1 mM L-arginine versus 25 or 100 mM L-arginine. In the initial experiments, set up controls in which the dyes colors are switched to control for biases caused by the dyes. After the ‘follow ∼ to ∼’ process mentioned above, go to step 12. If dye bias happens, please refer to ‘problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]’ for potential solutions.\nPreparation of 1 mM of L-arginine solution\nTiming: ∼ 5–10 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1657_1.csv\nMix the components completely by vortexing and immediately dispense in microtiter plates as described below in step 12.\nPause point: Place in a 57°C heat block for ≤30 min if immediate dispersion cannot be performed.",
    "Note: If the final volume before addition of agarose to any of the dye side is higher then add d/w to the lower side to make an equal volume to both the side.\nPreparation of 25 mM L-arginine solution\nTiming: ∼ 5–10 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1657_2.csv\nMix the components completely by vortexing and immediately dispense in microtiter plates as described in step 12.\nPause point: Place in a 57°C heat block for ≤30 min if immediate dispersion cannot be performed.\nNote: If the final volume before addition of agarose to any of the dye side is higher then add d/w to make an equal volume to both the side.\nPreparation of 100 mM L-arginine solution\nTiming: ∼ 5–10 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1657_3.csv\nMix the components completely by vortexing and immediately dispense in microtiter plates as described in step 12.\nPause point: Place in a 57°C heat block for ≤30 min if immediate dispersion cannot be performed.\nNote: If the final volume before addition of agarose to any of the dye side is higher then add d/w to make an equal volume to both the side.\nPreparation of 1 mM sucrose solution\nTiming: ∼ 5–10 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1657_4.csv\nMix the components completely by vortexing and immediately dispense in microtiter plates as described in step 12.\nPause point: Place in a 57°C heat block for ≤30 min if immediate dispersion cannot be performed.\nPreparation of 5 mM sucrose solution\nTiming: ∼ 5–10 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1657_5.csv\nOptional: Add an aversive tastant (for adding 10 mM caffeine from 100 mM stock solution, add 100 μL of caffeine solution).\nNote: If solution is more than 200 μL then concentration of agarose should be increased to balance the rigidity.\nMix the components completely by vortexing and immediately dispense in microtiter plates as described in step 12.",
    "Pause point: Place in a 57°C heat block for ≤30 min if immediate dispersion cannot be performed.\nPreparation of 2 mM sucrose alone solution\nTiming: ∼ 5–10 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1657_6.csv\nMix the components completely by vortexing and immediately dispense in microtiter plates as described in step 12.\nPause point: Place in a 57°C heat block for ≤30 min if immediate dispersion cannot be performed.\nPreparation of 2 mM sucrose with tastant solution\nTiming: ∼ 5–10 min\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1657_7.csv\nOptional: Add an aversive tastant (for adding 0.01 mM cuc-B from 10 mM stock solution, add 1 μL of test solution).\nCritical: Some aversive compounds are not soluble in water or have very low solubility in water. You may use ethanol as a solvent and insert the same amount of ethanol in both sides. For example, we used absolute ethanol to dissolve cuc-B (Rimal et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]) and 50% ethanol for umbelliferone to make stock solution (Poudel et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]).\nMix the components completely by vortexing and immediately dispense in microtiter plates as described in step 12.\nPause point: Place in a 57°C heat block for ≤30 min if immediate dispersion cannot be performed.\nCritical: To ensure that the dyes have minimal effects, the exact concentrations of the red and blue food need to be re-established empirically for each batch of food dye. See: Dye dose-response curves.\nCritical: If a volatile chemical such as DEET is to be tested, add the chemical immediately before dispensing the 5 mM sucrose solution on the microtiter plates to avoid evaporation. Beginners would better be trained to dispense the solutions to make 1 plate in 2 min.\nPreparing 72-well microtiter dishes for binary-choice feeding assays\nTiming: dispensing, 1–2 min per dish; use between 10 min to 2 h after dispensing",
    "This section describes dispensing process of dye containing food to 72-well microtiter dishes.\nDistribute 11 μL of the two types of tastants in an alternative fashion into 72 well microtiter dishes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). For the dispensing of the solution, regular 0–20 μL pipette can be used.\nCritical: This step should be done quickly. The distribution should be finished within 30 min since prolonged exposure to air may cause dehydration, therefore changing the food texture.\nCritical: The microtiter dishes should be closed with the microplate lid immediately after the dye/tastants distribution. This will prevent any contamination and evaporation.\nStart next step in 30 min.\nPreparing flies for binary-choice feeding assays\nTiming: ∼ 18–24 h\nThis section describes fly preparation for maintaining flies before the binary food choice assays begin.\nTo induce feeding during the food choice assay, starve the flies by incubating them in a vial containing 1% agarose only for 18–24 h (humidity: 50%–60%, temperature: 25°C, Light/Dark: 12/12 h).\nNote: The flies gross motor activities must not be significantly reduced after starvation, since this may decrease exploration and result in inaccurate or non-reproducible results. It should be noted that starvation can alter feeding motivation independent of the sense of taste, due to effects on the metabolic state, changes in the expression of hormones and proprioceptive feedback from the gut and crop. Depending on the internal nutritional state, starvation may affect taste perception. Furthermore, starvation can reduce aversion to bitter compounds and reduces attraction to sugars (LeDue et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Regarding the problem raised by the no color observation of the abdomen, please refer to ‘problems 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]’ for potential solutions.\nCritical: To avoid subjectivity, code the vials at this point so that the results can be scored in a blind manner.\nConducting and analyzing binary-choice feeding assays",
    "Timing: ∼ 5–6 h\nThis section describes the process of transferring starved flies to microtiter dishes, incubation process for allowing the feeding, sacrificing the fed flies and calculating the preference index based on color of abdomens.\nCritical: Perform the assays between ZT0– ZT5 because circadian rhythm can affect the amount of food intake.\nCritical: The binary-choice feeding assays should be performed in a controlled chamber with temperature of 25°C and 60% humidity.\nPlace the vials containing the starved flies in an ice-water mixture for 2–5 min to stop the animals motor activity.\nGently transfer ∼50–70 flies into the middle of each microtiter plate, and immediately cover the plates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPut the plates into a dark, humidified box, and allow the flies to consume the food for 90 min in the dark. Dark environment is to reduce the influence of dye color to visual cues.\nNote: 1.5 h is typically the optimal feeding period. The decrease in the PI after 2.5 h may be a consequence of food adaptation.\nAfter 90 min, transfer the microtiter plates to a −20°C freezer for 90–120 min. The plates should be inverted to allow the sacrificed flies to fall onto the lids.\nScore the number of flies with red (NR), blue (NB) or purple abdomens (NP) using a stereomicroscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: Ideally, the number of flies that can be scored is ≥80%, to minimize variability resulting from scoring low numbers of flies. If sexual dimorphic effects are doubted, each gender should be retested separately.\nDetermine the preference index (PI) according to the formula below. The noncolored flies are not included when calculating the PI (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1657-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Three different set-ups for binary food choice assays",
    "(A) Binary food choice assays of 10 mM caffeine in 5 mM sucrose vs 1 mM sucrose condition with w1118 (control), Gr33a1, Gr66aex83, and Gr93a3 mutants. Two color dyes (red and blue) mixed with alternative food choices were switched to exclude possible preferences to dye. Blue and red lines indicate the dye color mixed with the food and flies’ preference to that dye containing food (n = 6).\n(B) Binary food choice assays of w1118 (control) and Gr33a1 at 0.01 mM cuc-B (n= 4).\n(C) Binary food choice assays of w1118 (control) flies performed with 1 mM L-arginine versus 25 mM or 100 mM L-arginine concentration (n= 5). All error bars represent SEMs. Single-factor ANOVA coupled with Scheffe’s post hoc analysis was conducted to compare multiple sets of data. Asterisks indicate statistical significance compared with the control and mutant, respectively (∗∗p < 0.01).\n  PI =   (  N B  −  N R  )  /  (  N R    + N  B    + N  P  )    or    (  N R  −  N B  )  /  (  N R    + N  B    + N  P  )    \nDye dose-response curves\nThis section describes how to maintain dye concentration so that the dyes do not affect the result of PI.\nCritical: To establish the optimal concentrations of red and blue dyes, it is critical to identify dye concentrations that are not aversive, as this would influence the outcome of the binary-choice feeding assays. In addition, sufficient dye must be used so that it is possible to detect red, blue, and purple colors in the abdomens following the 90-minute feeding interval. We typically use 1× (0.125 mg/mL of blue dye and 0.1 mg/mL of red dye) concentrations of the dyes.",
    "Note: It is possible to use up to 10-fold less dye of one color than the other, and still assess both blue and red abdomens.\nNote: Because high dye concentrations make it easier to score the color of the abdomens, the goal is to establish the highest concentrations of red and blue dyes (up to 1×) that are not aversive or attractive.\nBecause 1× (0.125 mg/mL of blue dye and 0.1 mg/mL of red dye) of each dye is usually acceptable, mix 1× red dye and 1× blue each with 1 mM or 2 mM or 5 mM sucrose or without sucrose, and distribute in a zigzag pattern into 72 well microtiter dishes (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B). Also, to avoid any bias raised due to dye effect, dye switching test can be performed in the same paradigm. This switching of tastant/dye combinations does not affect food preference (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nNote: We recommend the number of trials of dye switching should be ≥ 3.\nDetermine the PI and the percentage of animals that can be scored. This is based on the visibility of the dye in abdomen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). If food consumption is low, then it is difficult to detect the color in the abdomen.\nInterpretations.\nNeither dye is aversive: The ideal results would be a PI=0 and ≥80% of flies that can be scored based upon the visibility of colored abdomen. If this is the case, no additional tests are necessary, and you can use 1× (0.125 mg/mL of blue dye and 0.1 mg/mL of red dye) concentrations of each dye.",
    "One dye is aversive: If the PI is outside of the range of 0 but the percentage of flies that can be scored is ≥80% based upon the visibility of colored abdomen, then just one dye is excessively aversive.\nBoth dyes are aversive: If the PI is outside of the range of 0, and the percentage of flies that can be scored is <80% based upon the visibility of a colored abdomen, then both dyes are excessively aversive.
