    "mT/mG (stock no. 007676), and Apoe-/- (stock no. 002052) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Myh11-CreERT2 mice were a gift from Stefan Offermanns (available from the Jackson Laboratory as stock no. 019079). Tgfbr2fl/fl mice were obtained from Harold L. Moses (Vanderbilt University). All animal procedures were performed using protocols approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Mice\nProduce MYH11-CreERT2;mT/mGf/f;Apoe-/- and MYH11-CreERT2;Tgfbr2f/f;mT/mGf/f;Apoe-/- mice as previously described7. Breed mutant strains to the C57BL/6J background for more than ten generations.\n\tNOTE: The Myh11-CreERT2 Cre mouse line provides a powerful tool for studying the role of smooth muscle cells in vascular homeostasis and vascular pathology. The Cre allele is inserted into the Y chromosome; thus, female mice do not express this construct.\n2. Mouse genotyping, tamoxifen induction, and high cholesterol high fat diet feeding\nPerform mouse genotyping using mouse ear DNA and PCR analysis. Mouse ear DNA should be isolated using the blood and tissue DNA isolation kit (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR primers are listed in Table 1.\nInduce Cre-Lox recombination by tamoxifen injection at 1 mg/day i.p. for 5 days in 6 week-old MYH11-CreERT2;mT/mGf/f;Apoe-/- and MYH11-CreERT2;Tgfbr2f/f;mT/mGf/f;Apoe-/- male mice.\nInduce atherosclerosis by placing 8 week-old male mice (2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment) on a HCHF diet (40% kcal fat, 1.25% cholesterol, 0% cholic acid) for 16 weeks.\n3. Reagents and dissection tool preparation\nStock Oil Red O solution preparation: dissolve 1 g of Oil Red O in 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol.\nWorking Oil Red O solution preparation: mix 24 mL of stock Oil Red O solution with 16 mL of dH2O. Filter the diluted Oil Red O with 0.45 μm sterile syringe filters (the solution is only good for 1–2 h).",
    "60% isopropyl alcohol preparation: mix 60 mL of isopropyl alcohol with 40 mL of dH2O.\n4% formaldehyde in 1x DPBS preparation: dilute 10 mL of 16% formaldehyde in 30 mL of 1x DPBS.\nClean all dissection tools with 70% ethanol (Figure 1).\n4. Euthanasia (Figure 2A)\nMeasure the mouse’s weight prior to euthanasia.\nEuthanize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine (each milliliter contains 10 mg/mL ketamine and 2 mg/mL xylazine).\nPlace the mouse in supine position (belly side face-up).\n5. Opening of chest and abdominal cavity and heart perfusion (Figure 2B)\nPrepare a 10 mL syringe with 10 mL of 1x DPBS. Cap with a 25 G needle. The syringe will be used to flush the heart.\nHold up the skin with tweezers (Style 5) and cut with fine scissors from the base of the abdomen to the top of the neck.\nOpen the abdominal wall below the ribcage.\nLift the sternum with tweezers (Style 5) and cut the diaphragm, then cut away the ribcage to expose the thoracic cavity.\nMake a small incision in the right atrium of the heart.\nPerfuse through the apical left ventricular puncture by slowly injecting 10 mL of 1x DPBS. Once thoroughly perfused, the liver and kidney become light brown in color.\nClean the chest cavity of extraneous blood and fluid by using a non-woven sponge to absorb the material.\n6. Isolation of aorta and branches (Figure 2C)\nRemove organs (i.e., lung, liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal and reproductive organs) and cut the clavicle using tweezers (Style 5) and fine scissors while leaving the heart, kidney, and aorta intact in situ.\n\tNOTE: Make sure not to lacerate the heart or any major blood vessels.\nPlace the mouse under a stereomicroscope.",
    "Dissect aorta and aorta branches including brachiocephalic artery, carotid arteries, subclavian arteries, renal arteries, common iliac arteries, and femoral arteries using tweezers (Style 4) and spring scissors.\n\tNOTE: Cover the aorta with a wet, non-woven sponge to avoid dehydration while dissecting the aorta branches.\nCarefully dissect and remove adventitial adipose and connective tissue around the aorta and aorta branches using tweezers (Style 4) and spring scissors.\n\tNOTE: Since inflammation is prominent in the aneurysm hyperlipidemia mouse, it is difficult to remove adventitia. Be careful not to tear or nick the aorta and aorta branches. This step requires practice and patience.\n7. Fixing of heart and aorta (Figure 2D,E)\nPrepare a 10 mL syringe with 10 mL of 4% formaldehyde in 1x of DPBS. Cap with a 25 G needle.\n\tCAUTION: Formaldehyde is hazardous. Read the MSDS before working with this chemical. Wear gloves and safety glasses and produce the dilution solutions inside a fume hood.\n\tNOTE: 4% formaldehyde solution degrades over time. It is important to use freshly made 4% formaldehyde for fixation.\nFix the vascular tree through apical left ventricular puncture by slowly injecting 10 mL of 4% formaldehyde.\n\tNOTE: Formaldehyde fixation interferes with several downstream applications, such as cell culture, FACS analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Skip this step if the aorta will be used for any of these applications.\nClean the chest cavity of any extraneous fluid with a non-woven sponge to absorb the material.\nSeparate the heart from the aorta by holding the heart with tweezers (Style 4) and using micro-dissecting spring scissors.",
    "NOTE: To perform en face Oil Red O staining after this step, it is recommended to cut the aorta open in situ instead of ex vivo and proceed to section 8. This makes it easy for the en face aorta to lay flat.\nIsolate and excise the aorta and its major from 1 mm above the carotid artery to the end of femoral artery using tweezers (Style 4) and spring scissors.\nTransfer the vessel into a wax Petri dish or 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and fill with 1x DPBS until it covers the aorta.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n8. Oil Red O staining and imaging of unopened whole aorta (Figure 3)\nPin the vessel onto a wax Petri dish using minutien pins (Figure 3A).\nRinse the vessel once with 1x DPBS.\nPour 25 mL of fresh Oil Red O solution into the Petri dish (Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: (1) Isopropanol is hazardous and a flammable liquid. Use proper personal protective equipment. (2) Oil Red O solution can easily precipitate. The precipitated particles can interfere with subsequent staining. It is important to remove the precipitate by filtering the Oil Red O solution through a 0.45 μm filter before use. (3) It is best to prepare fresh Oil Red O solution and discard any unused solution. (4) In addition to Oil Red O, Sudan IV is another chemical compound used for staining of lipids, triglycerides, and lipoproteins. However, Oil Red O has gradually replaced Sudan IV because the red color produced by Oil Red O is more intense and can thus make fat much easier to see.\nStain the aorta for 60 min at room temperature (RT). Oil Red O will stain lipid-rich plaque red, leaving other non-plaque containing areas pale in color.",
    "Wash once for 20 min with 60% isopropanol at RT.\n\tNOTE: Over-rinsing can destain the plaque.\nRinse the aorta 3x with dH2O for 5 min to remove isopropanol.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, gently clean all perivascular adipose tissue around the aorta using tweezers (Style 4) and spring scissors (Figure 3C,D).\n\tNOTE: It is important to clean all perivascular adipose tissue around the aorta and its branches after staining, because Oil Red O-stained perivascular adipose tissue can yield false background and interfere with plaque morphometry and plaque area quantification. Make sure not to remove a portion of the aortic wall. Fill the wax dish with dH2O until it covers the stained aorta during cleaning. This step requires practice and patience.\nTransfer the vessel to a clean, glass microscope slide.\nAcquire digital micrographs using a camera connected to a light microscope. Save high resolution images, preferably in tagged image file format (TIFF) (Figure 3E).\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. To prevent the aorta from drying, transfer the vessel into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and fill with 1x DPBS until it covers the aorta. Store at 4 °C.\n9. En face aorta mounting (Figure 4, Figure 5)\nTransfer the vessel to a wax Petri dish and fill with 1x DPBS until it covers the aorta.\nSever the carotid, subclavian arteries of the aortic arch and iliac arteries in the abdominal aorta 1–2 mm after bifurcations. Sever the renal arteries. (Figure 4A)\nLongitudinally cut open the aorta preparation along the inner curvature (Figure 4B1) and alone iliac arteries (Figure 4B2) with micro-dissecting spring scissors.\nCut open the three branches of the aortic arch (i.e., innominate, left common carotid, left subclavian artery) along the greater curvature until the base level of inner curvature (x-mark) (Figure 4B3–B8) with micro-dissecting spring scissors.",
    "Pin the aorta flat (lumen side face-up) in a wax dish with minutien pins and apply 1x DPBS until it covers the aorta to prevent it from drying (Figure 4C).\n\tNOTE: (1) It is important to make the rolled-up aorta flat and pin it en face without stretching. This step will take a few days depending on the severity of atherosclerosis. (2) For aortas from Apoe-/- or Ldlr-/- animals, it is recommended to pin the aorta flat for 24 h. (3) The protocol can be paused here.\nClean the glass microscope slides with 70% ethanol and delicate task wipers (Figure 5A).\nTransfer the aorta into a clean glass microscope slide and put 15 drops of optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound onto another clean glass microscope slide (Figure 5B).\nCarefully place the glass microscope slide with OCT compound over the aorta and avoid trapping air bubbles on the slide (Figure 5C).\nLabel the slides with sample names (Figure 5D).\n\tNOTE: The mounted en face aorta slides can be stored in the moisture chamber at 4 °C for several months.\n10. Imaging and lesion quantification of en face aorta (Figure 6)\nAcquire digital micrographs using a camera connected to a light microscope. Save high resolution images, preferably in tagged image file format (TIFF) (Figure 6A).\nTransfer images of the en face stained whole aorta to a computer equipped with ImageJ software.\nIn ImageJ, select the “Freehand selection” tool and circle all Oil Red O-stained plaque manually (intense red spots) while pressing the “Alt” key (for Windows PC) or “Shift” key (for Mac). Then, click “Measure” in the “Analyze” menu to display lesion areas in the result window (Figure 6B left).",
    "NOTE: There are several pitfalls of the quantification of atherosclerotic lesions: (1) any small pieces of stained adventitial fat that remained attached to the aorta from step 8.7 can yield false background and interfere with plaque quantification; (2) removing a portion of the aortic wall or damaging the aorta from steps 6.4 and 8.7 can interfere with plaque quantification; (3) bubbles and folds formed in the aorta after mounting (step 9.8) can interfere with plaque quantification; and (4) atherosclerotic plaque is a 3D phenomenon, and measurements performed in a 2D plane may not reflect the true extent of the plaque. In addition to analysis of the en face aorta plaque area, it is recommended to analyze plaque size in the aortic root, brachiocephalic artery, ascending aorta, and abdominal aorta separately8.\nCircle the outer border line of the aorta and click “Measure” in the “Analyze” menu to display the aorta area in the result window (Figure 6B right).\nExport all measurements to an Excel file.\nCalculate the ratio of plaque area from the total aorta area and normalize the value as the percentage of total Oil Red O surface area.\nCalculate the ratio of plaque area in 8–10 Apoe-/- and 8–10 TGFβR2iSMC-Apoe mice. Present the data as mean ± SEM (Figure 6C).\nPerform an unpaired Student’s t-test for statistical analysis of the ratio of plaque area data compared to another mouse group. Consider the differences in mean values as significant at p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
