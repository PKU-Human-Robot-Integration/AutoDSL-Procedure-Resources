    "Amplify flanks using PCR.Amplify the upstream and downstream region of your gene of interest using M. oryzae genomic DNA as the template.Amplify the two pieces of your selectable marker using an ILV1 containing plasmid as the template.Purify the amplified fragments using a PCR purification kit.Fuse the upstream region of your gene of interest with the 5′ end of the selectable marker together using the 5′ products generated from the first round of PCR. Final DNA concentration should be approximately 5 μg (see Note 3).Fuse the downstream region of your gene of interest with the 3′ end of the selectable marker together using the 3′ products generated from the first round of PCR. Final DNA concentration should be approximately 5 μg.Purify the resulting fused fragments using a PCR purification kit.Combine the fused fragment containing the upstream region of the gene and the 5′ end of the selectable marker along with the downstream region of the gene and 3′ end of the selectable marker in one tube.Dry each tube until only ~10 μL of DNA are present using a vacuum concentrator.Add 50 μL of STC buffer to each tube (see Note 4).Protoplast generation Grow M. oryzae mycelia on liquid complete medium (CM) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4809/bioprotoc-13-17-4809-g002.jpgFigure 2. Materials needed for generation of liquid CM mycelial culture Plate fungal strain on three CM plates each containing three colonies. M. oryzae was grown at 24 °C with a 12 h photoperiod using a I36VL Percival incubator with a IncuWhite Linear LED lighting system, with an intensity of 120 μmol/m2/s (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4809/bioprotoc-13-17-4809-g003.jpgFigure 3.

(Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Cutting growing circumference of mycelia.",
    "Using a blade, the growing edge of mycelia is cut from CM plates and placed in liquid CM to blend.Combine the cut edges of mycelium in 250 mL of liquid CM in a sterile blender. Blend on high for 10 s, then on low for 10 s.Transfer blended mycelium into a 500 mL flask and add 250 μL of antibiotic solution to the culture. The PSN antibiotic solution from Thermo Fisher is used at a 1× concentration.Incubate culture at 24 °C with a 12 h photoperiod for approximately 48 h with shaking at 150 rpm (see Note 5).After 24 h, add an additional 100 mL of liquid CM to the culture along with 100 μL of antibiotic solution and leave in shaking incubator at 200 rpm for the remainder of the 48 h.Lyse mycelia to generate protoplast.Filter mycelia from liquid culture using a sterile funnel and sterile Miracloth (Figures 4 and 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4809/bioprotoc-13-17-4809-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Filtered mycelia Rinse filtered mycelia with sterile distilled water.Using sterile paper towels, dry the filtered mycelia by squeezing the mycelia between paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible.Divide dry mycelia into two 50 mL falcon tubes containing 40 mL of OM buffer.Incubate tubes at 29 °C with shaking at 75 rpm for 3 h in a shaker incubator (see Note 6).Harvest protoplast; do all of the following on ice.Divide each falcon tube among two sterile clear polycarbonate Oakridge tubes.Slowly add cold ST buffer drop by drop until each Oakridge tube is filled to the neck (see Note 7) (Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Slow addition of ST buffer to Oakridge tube. Following mycelia lysis, the OM buffer and mycelia mixture is divided between two Oakridge tubes.",
    "Using a serological pipette, cold ST buffer is added slowly until the tube is filled to the neck.Centrifuge tubes at 3,200× g for 25 min at 4 °C using a swinging bucket centrifuge with brakes disabled to ensure proper generation of protoplast layer.Using a 1 mL pipette, slowly draw up protoplasts from each tube into new Oakridge tubes. Protoplasts from two Oakridge tubes can be combined into one new Oakridge tube (see Note 8) (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4809/bioprotoc-13-17-4809-g006.jpgFigure 6. Protoplast appearance in Oakridge tube after centrifuging Add STC buffer to the neck of each new Oakridge tube containing protoplasts.Centrifuge tubes at 1,900× g for 10 min at 4 °C, with breaks half engaged.A protoplast pellet should now be seen.Washing protoplast.Decant all STC buffer from each Oakridge tube.Gently resuspend pellet with 5 mL of cold STC buffer.Two resuspended pellets can be combined into one Oakridge tube.Add STC buffer to the neck of each Oakridge tube.Centrifuge tubes at 1,900× g for 10 min at 4 °C, with breaks half engaged.Repeat steps B4a–B4e 2 additional times for three total protoplast washes.Protoplast transformation.Resuspend final protoplast pellet in 1 mL of STC buffer.Using a hemocytometer, calculate protoplast concentration. A proper yield should be 2 × 108–5 × 108 protoplasts. Concentrate or dilute protoplasts with STC accordingly (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4809/bioprotoc-13-17-4809-g007.jpgFigure 7. Protoplast after harvest. Visualization is at 40× magnification.For each transformation, in a 1.5 mL tube, add 100 μL of protoplast to DNA (5 μg of each flank) that has been combined and resuspended in 50 μL of STC (see Note 9).Incubate tubes at room temperature for 20 min (see Note 10).*Please note that this is a time critical step. Avoid leaving the protoplasts in PTC for longer than the allotted time. Add 500 μL of PTC buffer to each tube.",
    "After adding PTC to the final tube, begin a 15 min timer (see Note 11).Repeat the addition of 500 μL of PTC buffer to each tube until all tubes have a total of 1 mL of PTC.Invert the tubes periodically during the 15 min incubation period.Divide and label Petri plates. Four plates should be used for each strain (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4809/bioprotoc-13-17-4809-g008.jpgFigure 8. Four Petri plates set aside per strain Protoplast plating.Add protoplasts to 100 mL of bottom media. *Please ensure that the bottom media is at approximately 45 °C as hotter temperatures will destroy the protoplast. Gently swirl to mix (see Notes 12 and 13).Pour and divide media between four Petri dishes (see Note 14) (Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Division of media. Following PTC incubation, the protoplasts are added to barely warm bottom media, swirled, and plated between four Petri dishes.Once solidified, transfer plates to clean, dark trays and cover with aluminum foil.Incubate plates at 24 °C for 16 h.The next day, add top media with corresponding antibiotics to transformation plates (see Note 15).Place plates back in dark trays and incubate for at least five days until colonies appear (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4809/bioprotoc-13-17-4809-g009.jpgFigure 9. Colonies after fungal transformation Screening fungal colonies DNA extraction.When colonies appear on the top layer of transformation plates, re-plate colonies in a grid on new media with corresponding antibiotics.After 3–6 days, transfer a small amount of mycelia using a sterile toothpick or pipette tip from each colony into a sterile 1.7 mL tube and label each colony accordingly.To each tube, add 500 μL of DNA extraction buffer.Using an electronic homogenizer, pulverize mycelia for ~10 s (see Note 16).Spin tubes at 2,100× g for 10 min at room temperature.Following centrifugation, transfer the supernatant to a new tube containing 300 μL of 100% isopropanol. Mix tube (see Note 17).",
    "Centrifuge tubes at 12,000× g for 10 min at room temperature.Discard as much supernatant as possible.Wash tube with 300 μL of 70% ethanol.Centrifuge tubes at 12,000× g for 10 min at room temperature.Discard as much supernatant as possible.Air dry tubes by placing inverted tubes on a tissue for ~15 min.After all ethanol has evaporated, add 30 μL of sterile water and 1 μL of RNase to each tube.Incubate tube for 20 min at room temperature.Incubate tube at 55 °C for 15 min to inactivate RNase.Following incubation, add 150 μL of sterile water to each tube. Mix.Use 1 μL of DNA extraction for screening.PCR verification.Using primers that fall outside the L1 and L4 region, run a PCR reaction for each of the potential mutants using the DNA extraction as a template. Use the wild-type Guy11 as a negative control (see Notes 18 and 19).Run PCR amplification on a gel.Verify band size for confirmation of positive transformation (see Note 20) (Figure 10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4809/bioprotoc-13-17-4809-g010.jpgFigure 10. Schematic of DNA gel depicting arbitrary amplifications following transformation. This arbitrary gene of interest is proposed to be 1 kb (although sizes will vary based on the gene of interest selected). A wild-type band would include the 1 kb upstream region, the 1 kb gene, and the 1 kb downstream region, yielding a size of 3 kb. A positive mutant would carry a higher band size at 4.8 kb, including the 1 kb upstream region, the 2.8 kb ILV1 gene, and the 1 kb downstream region. Please note that these sizes will vary based on the size difference between the gene of interest and the selectable marker."
