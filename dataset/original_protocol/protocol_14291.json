    "All patient data used for evaluating the RPA were used retrospectively, with approval from the University of Texas MD Anderson Institutional Review Board.\n1. Monitoring Planning Progress\nOpen the Radiation Planning Assistant Control Center Workspace and log in.\nTo see all patient data that is currently active, click All Patients.\nTo find a patient by their Medical Record Number (MRN), click on Select Patient.\nTo see the status of the plan for any patient who has an approved CT or approved Plan Order (or both), look in the RPA Plan section. The status options are summarized immediately above this section, and in the Message section.\nTo review details of any completed plan, click the patient (in the RPA section). Details of their plan order and CT can also be seen in the Plan Order and CT Approval sections.\n\t\nTo approve a completed plan, click on Approve. There are certain levels of approval (physician, physicist, and technician) that can be set for each institution.\nTo review the task history of the RPA, click on log.\nTo review details for any plan order (including ones that have not yet been approved), click on a patient in the Plan Order section.\nTo review details for any CT image set (including ones that have not yet been approved), click on a patient in the CT Approval section.\n2. Plan Order Approval\nNOTE: Plan order approval (typically by the radiation oncologist) is required before the RPA creates a treatment plan.\nOpen the Plan Order workspace. Use the standalone icon, or do this from the Radiation Planning Assistant Control Center workspace.\nCreate a new plan order as follows.\n\t\nClick New.\nComplete Section 1 - Demographics; this section is always the same.\n\t\t\nEnter the medical record number and patient name.",
    "Select the appropriate treatment site. Choose from head/neck, cervix, breast, and others.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This list will increase as our development efforts progress. This selection changes the choices offered in Section 3, below.\nComplete Section 2 - General Treatment; this section is always the same.\n\t\t\nComplete the questions on sex/pregnancy status, prior irradiation, pacemaker, and other implants.\nComplete the question on Autostart or Technician.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Selecting autostart will result in the RPA automatically starting the planning process when there are both an approved Plan Order and an approved CT image. Selecting Technician will require a technician to start the automatic planning process. This can be done in the Control Center Workspace.\nComplete Section 3 - Treatment Specific.\n\t\tNOTE: This example is for head/neck treatments.\n\t\t\nSelect the head/neck primary site and positive lymph involvement by selecting the appropriate radio button; the following sections are automatically selected based on these choices.\nConfirm or change the sections on cervical neck and retropharyngeal lymph node coverage, by selecting the appropriate radio button. Then select the appropriate radio button to indicate whether these correspond to CTV1 or CTV2 (CTV: Clinical Target Volume).\nSelect treatment machine and treatment technique.\nSelect the treatment approach by clicking on the appropriate radio button (this example is for VMAT treatments).\n\t\t\t\nConfirm or change the treatment prescription. To change the prescription, enter the required fraction doses into the text boxes.\nConfirm the appropriateness of the normal tissue dose constraints.\nSave the Plan Order; a pdf of the plan order will be generated.\nReview the final plan order.\n\t\t\nIf the final plan order is correct, click on Approve.\nIf the final Plan Order is incorrect, click on Edit and make changes as necessary.\nClose the Plan Order workspace.\n3. CT Image Approval",
    "NOTE: CT approval is required before the RPA creates a treatment plan.\nOpen the CT Approval workspace.\n\tNOTE: This can be done from the standalone icon, or from the Radiation Planning Assistant Control Center workspace.\nClick on the CT scan that it to be approved.\n\tNOTE: If the CT scan does not show up, it has not been received by the RPA.\nReview the CT slices centered on the isocenter.\n\t\nClick on Load All to review all CT images.\nReview isocenter location and CT image quality.\nIf the CT images, number of slices, orientation and data are correct, click on Approve.\n4. Initiate Automatic Treatment Planning\nNOTE: This step is only needed if Autoplan start (in the plan order) is set to Technician.\nSelect the correct patient/Plan Order/CT in the Control Center workspace, and click Add RPA Plan.\n5. Contouring Review and Approval\nNOTE: For some treatments, such as head/neck VMAT, contouring review and approval is required. This is typically performed by the radiation oncologist.\nWait for the patient data status to indicate W (wait) in the control center; it is now ready for contouring review.\nClick on the W icon, or on ROI Approval (ROI: Region-of-Interest). Note that the Contouring Review and Approval workspace will open.\n\tNOTE: The contours that are available here depend on the type of plan to be generated (selected in the Plan Order).\nReview all contoured tissues/targets. To edit structures, first select the structure of interest (pulldown list), then click on the Nudge icon and edit the contour on each CT slice.",
    "If necessary (e.g., for head/neck plans), manually delineate the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) and positive lymph nodes. To do this, select the structure of interest (e.g., GTV) from the pulldown list, click on the manual delineation icon, and draw the structure on each CT slice.\nCreate Clinical Target Volume (CTV1) (for head/neck cases)\n\t\nTo expand the GTV and positive lymph nodes, click on GTV->CTV.\nTo manually draw CTV1, select CTV1 from the list of structures (pulldown list), click on the manual delineation icon, and draw the structure on each CT slice.\nReview and edit CTV1, as necessary.\nCreate Planning Target Volumes (PTVs).\n\t\nClick on CTV->PTV. Review.\nEdit if necessary, but remember these expansions account for the many uncertainties in both contouring and patient setup. To edit the PTV, select the appropriate PTV from the pulldown list, click on the Nudge icon (or one of the other editing icons),\nApprove contours.\n\t\nReview all contours then click on Approve ROI. Once the ROIs are approved, the treatment planning process will proceed automatically. Pay attention to any warning messages and add explanatory notes, as necessary.\n6. Radiotherapy Plan Review and Approval\nReview the treatment plan when it is ready for review; it appears as a Plan Review Document (pdf format) in the Control Center.\n\tNOTE: The plan can be reviewed in stages (which can be combined, depending on available staff). The appropriate review stage is shown in the footer of each page.\nPerform Technical Review.\n\tNOTE: This can be combined with the Physics Review.\n\t\nReview the front page.\n\t\t\nReview and ensure that the patient demographics, prescription and plan details are appropriate.\nCheck that all the automatic plan verification checks were successful.\nCheck the marked isocenter.",
    "Answer the questions on the form to check that the marked isocenter was correctly identified. Compare with the library cases, as necessary.\nPerform Body Contour Review.\n\t\t\nAnswer the questions to check that the body was correctly contoured. Compare with the library cases, as necessary.\nPerform Field Aperture Review.\n\t\t\nAnswer the questions on the form to check that the field apertures are appropriate.\nPerform Dose Distribution Review.\n\t\t\nAnswer the questions on the form to check for appropriate dose calculation\nTo approve or reject this plan, click on Tech. Approve.\nPerform the Physician Review.\n\t\nDepending on the treatment type, review the dose distributions and field apertures.\nTo change the approval status of this plan to approve or reject, click on MD Approve.\nPerform Physics Review.\n\t\nReview the plan using standard procedures. See the following guidelines for supplemental checks.\nReview the Physician Review and Technical Review Sections.\nReview the results of the independent verification QA: table removal, body contour check, isocenter check.\nReview the results of additional independent verification checks that are specific to the treatment site - for example, the block check for 4-field cervix treatments.\nReview the results of the comparisons of the field and plan parameters with those from the patient population.\nReview the dose verification report.\nReview additional data. Additional data at the end of the document should be reviewed for consistency - this includes the original Plan Order and CT Approval.\nTo change the approval status of this plan to Approve or Reject, click on Physics Approve.\n7. Final Plan Transfer\nOnce the plan is approved, export it. The next steps are dependent on the local setup, record-and-verify software and treatment planning system. They are also dependent on ethics protocols and local clinical workflow. The following are steps are examples of appropriate steps.",
    "Transfer DICOM plan to local record-and-verify (R&V) system.\nUse a software tool to compare the original plan with that in the R&V system (to verify correct data transfer)."
