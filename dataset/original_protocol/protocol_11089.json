    "Three different types of cell lines were employed: \"MAM\"-a cell line originating from bone metastases of renal cell carcinoma, \"MAC\"-bone metastases of an invasive ductal breast carcinoma, and \"17-1012\"-a giant cell tumor of bone. Marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were used as a control group. Institutional and ethical approval was obtained before the commencement of the study (project number: 008/2014BO2-for the cancer cell lines and project number: 401/2013 BO2 for MSCs).\n1. Cell culture\nNOTE: Culture media can be prepared beforehand. The culture medium for MAM and 17-1012 consists of RPMI supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine. The culture medium for MAC and MSCs consists of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with glutamine substitute (see the Table of Materials), 4.5 g/L D-glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS.\nHarvest and passage cells until 80% confluence is achieved.\nWash the cells with 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and aspirate the PBS from the flask using a pipette.\n\tNOTE: This step ensures the removal of residual complete medium containing protease inhibitors.\nAdd 3 mL of 0.05% (v/v) trypsin-EDTA to dissociate the adherent cells from the bottom of the flask in which they are cultured.\nIncubate the flasks for 5 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.\nObserve the cell detachment under a phase-contrast microscope.\n\tNOTE: The incubation time must be adjusted for each cell type. Prevent cell exposure to trypsin solution for longer periods (>10 min).\nStop the trypsinization by adding add 3 mL of culture medium.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to add the appropriate culture medium for each cell type containing 10% (v/v) FBS.\nTransfer the detached cells to a centrifugation tube and centrifuge them for 7 min at 350 × g at 7 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cells pellet in 1 mL of culture medium and count the cells using a hemocytometer as described previously13.\n2. PDT setup and exposure\nPrepare the PDT device (see the Table of Materials) by plugging in all the cables and accessories.\nDim the light in the room to avoid unnecessary light dissipation.\nPosition and stabilize the light fiber with the aid of duct tape directly on top of the well plate.\n\tNOTE: A uniform distribution of the light fibers on top of the wells is desired to ensure that all cells are irradiated and receive the same amount of energy (Figure 1).\nMake sure not to severely bend or damage the light fiber as this might lead to a reduction in the light intensity.\nCover the well plates with aluminum foil to minimize light dissipation.\nSwitch on the PDT device by pressing the ON/OFF switch button.\nInsert the metered card into the slot in the front of the PDT device.\n\tNOTE: One metered card is provided with the device corresponding to 300 s exposure time. An additional 2,000 s program is automatically integrated within the PDT device. For both exposure times, the light is delivered in a continuous output mode for the indicated periods.\nEnsure the timer on the PDT lightbox display changes to the prescribed time indicated on the metered card.\nStart the PDT treatment by pressing the incorporated foot pedal.\n\t​NOTE: An automatic stop function is incorporated into the device, and the system runs automatically. Do not stop the light process or remove the light fiber prior to the completion of the cycle. At the completion of the light cycle, the light source shutter is closed, and no further light is delivered.\n3. Migration assay",
    "Seed cells as follows: 2 × 104 cells - MAC, 1 × 104 cells - MAM, 3 x 104 - 17-1012, and 2.5 × 104 - MSCs into each 2-chamber culture insert integrated into opaque F-bottom, 6-well plates.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. Remove the inserts afterward.\n\tNOTE: To have a starting reference point for the migration and the initial unbiased gap size, a separate plate, which will not be subjected to further 5-ALA-PDT exposure (steps 3.3-3.4) but instead directly stained and quantified (steps 3.5-3.12), is employed.\nReplace the medium with fresh FBS-free medium containing 1 mM of 5-ALA.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 h.\n\tNOTE: As controls, additional wells should concomitantly be covered with medium without 5-ALA.\nSubject the cells to PDT with blue light (436 nm, 36 J/cm2) in a continuous output mode for predefined time frames of 300 s or 2,000 s, as indicated in section 2.\n\tNOTE: Plates that are not subjected to PDT exposure should be employed as controls.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: Check the cells periodically to assess the degree of migration for each cell type. This must be optimized for each cell line.\nWash the cells with 1.5 mL of PBS and completely remove the PBS afterward.\nFix the cells by adding and incubating the cells with 1.5 mL of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol and incubate for 10 min.\nDiscard the ethanol and allow the plates to air-dry at room temperature for 10 min.\nIncubate the cells with 1.5 mL of 0.2% (v/v) Coomassie blue dye in 90% (v/v) ethanol for 20 min.\nWash the plates with double-distilled water.",
    "NOTE: To thoroughly wash the plates and remove the remaining debris, fully immerse the plates 2-3 times in clean, double-distilled water.\nAllow the plates to air-dry at room temperature for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, the dried plates may be stored at room temperature for at least several weeks.\nVisualize and photograph the migration of cells into gaps with an inverse phase-contrast microscope at 10-fold magnification.\n\tNOTE: Observe and photograph the migration of live cells for up to 24 h after 5-ALA-PDT exposure. However, fixed cells can be stored and photographed later.\nExport the images in the desired format and quantify the gaps using software for processing and analyzing scientific images as described previously14.\n4. Viability assay\nSeed all the cells at a density of 1.5 × 104 in 96-well plates in 50 µL of culture medium.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h in a standard cell culture incubator.\nAdd an additional 50 µL of FBS-free culture medium containing 5-ALA at a final concentration of 1 mM.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2  for 4 h in a standard cell culture incubator.\n\tNOTE: Use 2x concentration as the cells are already covered with 50 µL of culture medium. A control with culture medium should be included.\nSubject the cells to PDT exposure with blue light (436 nm, 36 J/cm2) in a continuous output mode for predefined time frames of 300 s or 2,000 s, as indicated in section 2.\n\tNOTE: A negative control that is not subjected to PDT exposure should also be included.\nIncubate the irradiated cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h in a standard cell culture incubator.",
    "Add 15 µL of MTS reagent onto the cells and incubate the cells for 90 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nMeasure the absorbance with a spectrophotometer reader at a wavelength of 490 nm.\n5. Cellular growth arrest/senescence assay (β-Galactosidase( β-Gal) activity)\nNOTE: All reagents and buffers used here were provided in the assay kit (see the Table of Materials).\nSeed the cells at a density of 1.5 × 104 in 96-well plates in 100 µL of culture medium. Incubate the cells for 24 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a standard cell culture incubator.\nAdd 100 µL of fresh FBS-free medium with 5-ALA at a final concentration of 1 mM and incubate for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: As controls, separate wells should concomitantly be covered with fresh medium without 5-ALA photosensitizer.\nSubject the cells to PDT exposure with blue light (436 nm, 36 J/cm2) in a continuous output mode for predefined time frames of 300 s or 2,000 s, as indicated in section 2.\n\tNOTE: A negative control plate that is not exposed to PDT should also be included.\nIncubate the cells for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a standard cell culture incubator.\nDiscard the medium and wash the cells two times with PBS.\nCover the cells with 100 µL of 1x cell lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 350 × g 1 for 10 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant.\nPipette 50 µL of the supernatant to a new 96-well plate and add another 50 µL of 2x assay buffer.\nPlace the new 96-well plate in a 37 °C incubator for 1.5 h.\n\tNOTE: The pates should be protected from light to avoid photobleaching.",
    "Transfer 50 µL of the mixture into an opaque-walled 96-well plate and add 200 µL of stop solution.\nMeasure the absorbance with a fluorescence microplate reader at 360 nm excitation/465 nm emission.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
