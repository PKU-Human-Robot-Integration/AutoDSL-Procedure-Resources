    "An informed, written consent has been signed by all participants. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Milan (n. 48/19) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Training of experimenters\nTake the grating tool and apply a force of 100 g on a sponge placed on a scale.\n\tNOTE: Refer to Figure 1 for the schematic of the grating tool used in this study\nRepeat this procedure at least 10 times to reduce variation in the force applied by the grating on the subjects' tongues during testing, both within and across experimenters.\n2. Assessment procedure\nNOTE: Conduct the assessment of tactile acuity following the required health and safety standard to guarantee the subject's safety (e.g., mask, gloves, and lab coat).\nDisplay all gratings (0.20 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.50 mm, 0.75 mm, 1.00 mm, 1.25 mm) (Figure 2) on a table out of sight of the participant.\nSeat the participant in a comfortable chair and inform them that they can leave the experiment at any time.\nInform the participant that they will be blindfolded during the experiment and asked to stick out their tongue in a comfortable and relaxed way.\nPrior to the beginning of the experiment, familiarize the subjects with the procedure using the largest grating (1.25 mm) to demonstrate the force applied (100 g for 3 s).\nNotify the participants that they can take a sip of water whenever deemed appropriate.\nApply each grating onto the subjects' tongue (anterior region of the tongue just around the midline).\nAfter each touch, ask the subjects to indicate, using their hands, the tool's orientation (either horizontal or vertical) and their degree of sureness (sure, unsure). Subjects must guess if they do not know.",
    "After each touch, record all the answers (horizontal, vertical, sure, not sure) for each subject on a spreadsheet (Supplemental Table 1).\nRepeat each grating as many times as deemed necessary for the R-Index cut-off selected, for instance, 6 times, 3 horizontally, and 3 vertically (Supplemental Table 1).\nSterilize each grating after testing each participant (refer to section 4).\n\tNOTE: The tongue should protrude gently from the mouth without effort by the volunteers to avoid excessive fatigue, which would lead to an alteration in their performance results. It is important to note that the higher the repetitions by grating, the more reliable the measurement16.\n3. Cleaning protocol\nPrepare a solution consisting of 20 mL of sodium hypochlorite (see Table of Materials) diluted in 1 L of water according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nManually shake the solution for a few seconds.\nFill 6 cups with approximately 20 mL of the disinfectant solution to fully immerse each tool in the solution.\nPlace each tool in the corresponding cup.\nLet the tools soak for 15-20 min.\nRinse the tools with plenty of water according to the manufacturer's instructions and scrub them with a toothbrush to ensure removing any sodium hypochlorite residue.\nAllow the tools to air dry.\n4. R-index calculation\nCreate a response matrix for each volunteer and for all the tools (Figure 3) based on the response frequencies used to calculate the R-index using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62898/62898eq01.jpg",
    "NOTE: R-index expresses individual tactile sensitivity for each tool16. R- index is based on SDT17 and represents an estimated probability of discerning a target stimulus (i.e., the signal) from an alternative stimulus (i.e., the noise). The signal and the noise correspond to the correct or incorrect identification of the horizontal-vertical orientation of the grating. Four response options for both signal and noise can occur: \"horizontal-sure\", \"horizontal-unsure\", \"vertical-unsure\" and \"vertical-sure\"16. R-index values range between 0-1. A higher R-index value indicates better discrimination.\n5. Sensitivity and threshold determination by the R-index estimates\nTo determine whether a subject can discriminate the orientation of each tool, calculate the cut-off using a table of critical values for R-index significance tests18\n\tNOTE: Considering the present example, corresponding to 36 presentations (i.e., each grating presented 6 times, 3 horizontal and 3 vertical), the cut-off value for discrimination is set to 0.7426 according to the one-sided R-index critical values for Î± = 0.0518.\nIf a sufficiently high number of tools is used (e.g., six different grating dimensions)19, derive R-index threshold estimations.\nTo calculate the threshold for each subject, interpolate the two R-indices immediately below and above of the cut-off value20.\nSubscription Required.
