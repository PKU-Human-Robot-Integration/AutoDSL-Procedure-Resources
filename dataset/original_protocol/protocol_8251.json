    "Studies of animals was approved by Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and use (ACUC) protocol number M017M385.\n1. Brain Slicing\nTo immobilize, anesthetize mice by the application of 3% isoflurane.\n\t\nSoak a cotton ball with drops of isoflurane and place it in a 15 mL microcentrifuge tube. Place the animal’s nose into the tube and allow it to inhale the isoflurane. Check for the depth of anesthesia by the lack of response to toe-pinch.\nPlace the animal on its back and immobilize it by pinning its extremities down with a T pin while having access to its abdomen.\nCut the animal with surgical scissors by making a snip from the abdominal skin and cut through the skin in the thorax region. Pin the skin down using T pins. Then break the peritoneal membrane up to the thorax. Expose the heart by cracking the thoracic cavity and cutting the diaphragm.\nCut the right atrium to allow the blood to flow out of the animal. Insert a 10 mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle into the left ventricle and perfuse with 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: This allows the solution to flow through systemic circulation and exit through the right atrium.\nRemove the 10 mL syringe and insert a 25-gauge needle attached to the 60 mL syringe. Perfuse through the left ventricle with 50 mL of ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n\t\nPrepare ice cold 4% PFA solution by diluting 10% PFA solution in H2O and chilling the final 4% PFA solution at 4 °C.\nIsolate the head of the mouse and remove the brain from the skull.",
    "Cut the skin from the neck, and then cut towards the eyes to expose the skull. Crack the skull from the neck to the nose, and then from one eyeball to the other. Peel the skull out and excise the whole brain.\nIncubate the brain in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 °C.\nTransfer the brain with forceps into a 50 mL conical tube filled with 25 mL of 30% sucrose solution. Keep it at 4 °C for 48-72 h until the brain sinks to the bottom of tube.\nCut the brain with an adult mouse brain slicer matrix coronal through the midbrain (~3 mm posterior of bregma). Keep the brain section containing the brainstem.\n\tNOTE: This will result in two brain sections – one containing most of cortex (anterior of the cut) and one containing the brainstem/cerebellum (posterior of the cut). Use the brainstem section for the following steps.\nEmbed the brainstem section with the cut surface placed on the bottom of an embedding mold, surrounded by optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT); move the embedded brain to a -80 °C freezer and freeze for at least 12 h – until further use.\nCutting at the cryostat: place the embedding mold containing the brain in OCT into the cryostat; incubate it in the cryostat for several hours to adjust the temperature of the brain block to that of the cryostat.\nPeel away the embedding mold to expose the OCT block containing the brain.\nUse razor blades to remove excess of OCT from the surface of the block without touching the brain.\nMount the OCT block on the chuck of the cryostat, exposing the cut surface of the brain toward the front.",
    "Adjust the cut surface of the brain so that it is oriented in parallel to the razorblades of the cryostat.\nTrim the brain beginning at the medulla, cutting 100 µm sections rostrally.\nTrim rostrally until the cerebellum and brainstem cut as one continuous slice. Begin collecting slices at 50 µm thickness.\n\tNOTE: As one trims rostrally from the medulla, the brainstem and cerebellum will cut as two separate sections. In rostral sections, the brainstem and cerebellum will eventually merge at the level of the 4th ventricle. Once the lateral edges of the 4th ventricle are well-formed, then the cerebellum and brainstem will come out as one continuous slice.\n\t\nCollect OCT-surrounded brain slice with forceps and place it in a well of a 24-well plate filled with PBS (Figure 2a). The LC will be most prominent when the cerebellum and inferior colliculus meet one another at ~-5.52 mm posterior of bregma (Figure 1b).\n\t\tNOTE: The most anterior part of LC will disappear once the cerebellum has been fully sectioned and no longer surrounds the inferior colliculus at ~-5.34 mm posterior of bregma (Figure 1c).\n2. Immunohistochemistry for Dopamine β-Hydroxylase or Tyrosine Hydroxylase (Figure 2)\nDay 1\n\t\nWash the selected slices three times for 5 min in PBS.\nPermeabilize for 24 h in 0.5% phosphate buffered saline with detergent (PBSD) at 4 °C.\n\t\t\nDilute 125 µL of detergent in 25 mL of PBS.\nDay 2\n\t\nWash slices three times for 5 min in 0.5% PBSD.\nAdd the primary antibody, anti-DBH or anti-TH for 18 h at a dilution of 1:500 in 0.5% PBSD at 4 °C.\nDay 3\n\t\nWash slices three times for 10 min in 0.5% PBSD.\nAdd the desired secondary antibody (488 donkey anti-rabbit for green fluorescence) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 0.5% PBSD for 16 h.",
    "Wrap the 24 well plate in aluminum and place at 4 °C.\nWash slices three times for 5 min in 0.5% PBSD.\nWash for 5 min in PBS.\nTransfer slices with a pencil brush into a water container.\nMount slices floating in water on charged slides.\nCoverslip sections with hard-set mounting media (without DAPI).\nDry the mounted brain sections for 30 min at room temperature.\nImage brain slices at a confocal or fluorescent microscope with settings to detect signal from appropriate secondary antibody fluorophore wavelength.\nAdjust the microscope to the focal plane of the brain slice and take a single image at 10X magnification.\nTo locate a possible LC region in the brain slice, use the 4th ventricle for orientation; the cerebellum is located above the ventricle, pons and brainstem are found below30.\nTo locate the LC, focus on the lateral edges of the 4th ventricle; the LC originates from the edges of the 4th ventricle and points toward the pons/ brainstem region (Figure 2b, 2c).\nFollowing imaging and localization of the LC in certain brain slices, store slides containing brain slices at 4 °C.\n3. Detection of the LC in Brain Slices\nTo locate the brain section containing the LC, slice the mouse brain as described above and collect sections in PBS filled 24 well dishes, as shown in Figure 2a.\n\t\nPlace one brain section per well to allow for the proper localization of the LC.\nCollect a total of 48 brain slices that will be immunostained per brain.\n\tNOTE: All the wells of the two dishes shown in Figure 2a contain brain slices from one animal.\nImmunostain every third to fifth slice for DBH, or TH. Preferably, perform immunohistochemistry of those brain slices that are adjacent to those that are assayed further (via X-ray fluorescence microscopy, XFM).",
    "NOTE: This procedure allows for exact localization of the LC in the final assay slices (Figure 2a; labeled with numbers between the wells).\nAdjust the number of brain slices that are immunostained depending on the application, e.g., whether they require exact location of the center and edge of the LC, or just a rough approximation.\nFollowing immunohistochemistry, detect brain slices containing LC via a characteristic pattern of expression at both sides of the 4th ventricle (Figure 2b, 2c). Magnification of the DBH signal in the LC of consecutive brain slices is shown in Figure 2d, 2e; the magnified image of the LC that is stained for TH is shown in Figure 2f.\nUse the sections adjacent to those containing LC for further studies - in this case for XFM to quantify metal levels (Figure 3).\nTo perform XFM, collect 10-30 µm (depending on the setup) thin coronal brain slices on thin polymeric film with which they can be mounted on sample holders and imaged at the synchrotron.\nStore brain slices which are prepared on thin polymeric film for XFM at room temperature and perform XFM.\n4. Metal Imaging in the LC via XFM\nSlice example mouse brain as described above, determine LC, and measure metal levels via XFM from these brain slices containing the LC.\nImage elemental distributions on beamline 2-ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL).\nRecord data ‘on the fly’ as described previously31.\nDetermine elemental concentrations in brain slices containing the LC using the program MAPS32,33.\nSubscription Required.
