    "Seedling preparation and inoculation (adapted from Latch and Christensen, 1985):Seed surface sterilization:Incubate endophyte-free seeds in 50% sulfuric acid (H2SO4) for 30 min.Pour off the acid and soak the seeds 3 times in sterile water for 3 min each time.Incubate the seeds in 50% commercial bleach for 20 min.Pour off and soak the seeds 3 times in sterile water for 2 min each time.Dry the seeds on sterile filter paper in a laminar flow hood.Seed culture:Using sterile forceps, transfer the sterile dried seeds to 4% water agar (10 seeds per plate).Incubate the plates in the dark at 22°C for 7 days.Mycelium preparation for inoculation:Subculture the Epichloë strain onto a PDA plate.Incubate the plate at 20°C for 7-10 days.Seedling inoculation:After 7-8 days, the seeds will germinate with etiolated shoots.Using a dissecting microscope in a laminar flow hood, make a small incision in the meristem (usually appears as a faintly visible line between the mesocotyl and the coleoptile) with a scalpel.Cut a small piece of fungal mycelium from the PDA plate (around 2 mm × 2 mm) and insert into the incision in the meristem.Incubate the seedlings in their original water agar plates at 22°C in the dark, with the plates standing on their end and the seedlings upright.Subsequent steps are described in detail (including videos and figures) in Becker et al. (2018) .In all plant response tests, there are 4 inoculation treatments including seedlings with an incision inoculated with wild type E. festucae (“Wild Type”), mutant ΔvelA E. festucae (“ΔvelA”), a block of agar without fungi (“E- (cut)”), and seedlings without an incision but a piece of agar placed over the meristem (“E- (Uncut)”).",
    "Staining for defense responsesInoculated seedlings were incubated for the different plant response tests as follows:Callose deposition (adapted from Knox, 1979):Impatiens walleriana pollen tubes can be used as a positive control to test whether the Aniline Blue solution is working properly.Sprinkle pollen over a freshly prepared pollen germination slide.Store the slides in a moist Petri dish (containing wet tissue paper) for at least 5 h until germination occurs.Cover the slide with a few drops of Aniline Blue solution and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Rinse the slides twice with distilled water.Observe callose deposition in the pollen tubes using a fluorescence microscope (excitation 450-490 nm, emission >515 nm).Callose deposition appears as a yellow-green color (Figure 1A).Studying callose deposition at different time points determined that 4 days post-inoculation (DPI) was optimal for Epichloë-ryegrass associations.At 4 DPI, place the seedlings in Aniline Blue solution for 30 min at room temperature.Rinse the seedlings twice with distilled water.Remove the inoculum (fungal block, or agar block in the negative controls) from the meristem and cut out the meristem section of the seedlings including the 1.5 cm above and below.Observe callose deposition under a fluorescence microscope (excitation 450-490 nm, emission >515 nm).Callose deposition appears as a yellow-green color (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4013/bioprotoc-11-09-4013-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Callose deposition appears yellow-green.Lignin production (adapted from Tanaka et al., 2014):Studying lignin production at different time points determined that 2.",
    "5 DPI was optimal for Epichloë-ryegrass associations.At 2.5 DPI, place the seedlings in Safranin solution for 10 min in the dark at room temperature.Rinse the seedlings twice with distilled waterRemove the inoculum (fungal block, or agar block in the negative controls) from the meristem and cut out the meristem section of the seedlings including the 1.5 cm above and below.Observe lignin under a fluorescence microscope in brightfield.Lignin deposition appears as a red color (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4013/bioprotoc-11-09-4013-g002.jpgFigure 2. Lignin detection in the meristematic region of 7-d-old seedlings inoculated with wild type and ΔvelA mutant strains of E. festucae and endophyte-free cut and uncut seedlings inoculated with agar block as a control; 4 DPI stained with 1% Safranin O solution. Lignin deposition appears red.Plant cell death (adapted from Koch and Slusarenko, 1990):The highest levels of plant cell death were observed at 7 days post-inoculation (DPI), but a time-course study can be performed from 1-12 DPI.At 7 DPI, place whole seedlings in 20 ml boiling lactophenol-Trypan Blue for 1 min. Since this solution contains corrosive phenol and requires boiling, this step should be carried out under the laminar flow cabinet. First, warm the solution in a 100-ml glass beaker over a Bunsen burner until boiling, then add the seedlings.Decolorize the stained seedlings by placing in 20 ml chloral hydrate solution for 30 min. Since chloral hydrate is toxic, this step should be carried out under the laminar flow cabinet.Rinse the seedlings twice with distilled water.Remove the inoculum (fungal block or agar block in the negative controls) from the meristem and cut out the meristem section of the seedlings including the 1.5 cm above and below.Mount the seedling sections on slides with coverslips in water.Observe the cell death response under a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (camera: Nikon DsRi1) in brightfield.",
    "Dead cells appear dark blue (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4013/bioprotoc-11-09-4013-g003.jpgFigure 3. Cell death detection in the meristematic region of 7-d-old seedlings inoculated with wild type and ΔvelA mutant strains of E. festucae and endophyte-free cut and uncut seedlings inoculated with agar block as a control; 4 DPI stained with lactophenol-Trypan Blue solution. Dead cells appear dark blue.Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production (adapted from Thordal-Christensen et al., 1997):Detecting H2O2 production after the normal inoculation procedureMost H2O2 production should be detected immediately after inoculation.Immediately after inoculation, place whole seedlings in freshly prepared DAB solution for 4 h in the dark at room temperature.Rinse the seedlings twice with distilled waterRemove the inoculum (fungal block, or agar block in the negative controls) from the meristem and cut out the meristem section of the seedlings including the 1.5 cm above and below.Observe H2O2 production under a Leica DMR microscope in brightfield.H2O2 appears as a brown color (Figure 4A).Detecting H2O2 production without incisionSince cutting the meristem produces a high level of H2O2, making the differentiation between treatments difficult, we optimized the methodology to measure H2O2 in the absence of an incision.Place 1-2 mm2 fungal culture on agar blocks 1 cm above the meristem.Immediately after inoculation, place whole seedlings in freshly prepared DAB solution for 4 h in the dark at room temperature.Remove the inoculum (fungal block, or agar block in the negative controls) from the meristem and cut out the meristem section of the seedlings including the 1.5 cm above and below.Observe H2O2 production under a Leica DMR microscope in brightfield.H2O2 appears as a brown color (Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4013/bioprotoc-11-09-4013-g004.jpgFigure 4.
