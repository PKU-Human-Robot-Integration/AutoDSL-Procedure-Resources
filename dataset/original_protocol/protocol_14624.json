    "All studies with mice were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Housing and all procedures involving mice described in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Massachusetts General Hospital (Subcommittee on Research Animal Care). All procedures were performed with care to minimize suffering.\n1. Preparation of Reagents\nNear-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Whole Aortas\n\tNote: A bisphosphonate-derived, near-infrared fluorescent imaging probe can be used to mark osteogenic activity in the vasculature by binding to hydroxyapatite.46,47 A cathepsin-activated fluorescent imaging probe can serve as a marker for macrophage proteolytic and elastolytic activity in the vasculature.9 To permit the simultaneous use of both fluorescent probes, it is important to use probes that are spectrally distinct. The notation calcium NIR will be used to indicate the calcification-specific near-infrared fluorescent imaging probe and cathepsin NIR to indicate the cathepsin activity-specific near-infrared fluorescent imaging probe.\n\t\nPrepare the solutions of calcium NIR and cathepsin NIR. As per manufacturer's protocols, add 1.2 ml of 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the vial containing 24 nmol of calcium NIR or cathepsin NIR and shake gently.\n\t\tNote: According to the manufacturer, once reconstituted with PBS, the calcium NIR and cathepsin NIR solutions remain stable for 14 days when stored in the dark at 2-8 °C.\nIsolation and Calcification of Murine Aortic VSMCs\n\t\nAortic Digestion Solution:\n\t\t\nPrepare a fresh solution (~3-5 ml per aorta harvested) with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 175 U/ml type 2 collagenase and 1.25 U/ml elastase. Sterilize the solution with a 0.22 µm vacuum-driven filtration system and keep the solution on ice until use.\nCell Media:",
    "Supplement 500 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Warm the media to 37 °C prior to use.\nCalcification Media:\n\t\t\nCalcification Media A (NaPhos; used in mouse cell lines):\n\t\t\t\nSupplement 100-500 ml of DMEM (volume as needed) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM sodium phosphate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Warm the media to 37 °C prior to use.\n\t\t\t\tOR\n\t\t\t\t \nCalcification Media B (βGP/Asc/DEX; used in either mouse or human cell lines):\n\t\t\t\nSupplement 100-500 ml of DMEM (volume as needed) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate disodium, 50 µg/ml L-ascorbic acid, 10 nM dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Warm the media to 37 °C prior to use.\n2. Tail Vein Injection\nBefore tail injection, warm the mice under a mild heating lamp for 5 min.\nRestrain the mouse in a tube rodent holder. Disinfect the tail with an alcohol swab.\nUtilize a 30 G needle for tail vein injection. Tail veins are located laterally.\n\t\nApply a gentle amount of forward pressure on the syringe as the needle is advanced into the tail. The vein is accessed once the resistance to injection is no longer present.\nInject a volume of 100 µl of calcium NIR and/or 100 µl of cathepsin NIR at a steady rate. At the end of injection, after a 5 sec pause, withdraw the needle.\nHarvest the aortas (see section 3) 3-24 hr after injection.\n3. Mouse Dissection\nEuthanize mouse with a 200 mg/kg intraperitoneal pentobarbital injection.\nLay the animal supine on the dissection board and stabilize by taping each paw to the board. Using a dissecting microscope and small scissors, make a midline incision extending from the lower abdomen to the upper thorax.",
    "Peel back the skin with forceps and remove the peritoneum, revealing the abdominal organs. Remove the gastrointestinal organs, taking care not to transect the aorta.\nMake a lateral incision in the anterior diaphragm and continue the incision across the abdomen. Using dissection scissors, release the ribcage by cutting through the sides of the ribs and removing the soft tissue adherent to the superior portion of the sternum. Remove the ribcage, revealing the lungs.\nLeave the heart in place initially (to aid in identifying and dissecting the proximal aorta) and carefully remove the lungs. Remove the thymus, trachea, and esophagus with care, ensuring that the aorta remains intact.\nUsing straight fine forceps and micro-dissecting scissors, remove the soft tissue surrounding the aorta from the iliac bifurcation to the aortic arch, paying careful attention when removing the peri-aortic fat (Figure 1A). Remove the remaining fat and soft tissue surrounding the large branches of the aortic arch (i.e., brachiocephalic, common carotid and subclavian arteries, Figure 1B).\n\tNote: It is important to remove the fat from the aorta because fat can increase the background signal when performing fluorescence imaging.\nRemove the heart from the thoracic cavity, carefully detaching it from the proximal aorta, and discard. Transect the distal aorta at the iliac bifurcation. Using an insulin needle, inject normal saline into the aorta from the aortic arch to wash out remaining blood cells. Detach the aorta along with the aortic arch vessels, completely removing it from the body.\nPlace the aorta in normal saline solution on ice until ready for imaging.\n4. Aortic Imaging\nImage aortas ex vivo immediately after harvest by near-infrared fluorescence reflectance imaging.25",
    "Set the fluorescence imager at the appropriate multichannel wavelengths to quantify fluorescence signal intensities from the aortas of calcium NIR and cathepsin NIR-injected mice, as previously described.25 According to the manufacturer, calcium NIR can be excited by ~ 650-678 nm light with a maximal emission in the ~ 680-700 nm range. Cathepsin NIR can be excited by ~ 745-750 nm light with a maximal emission at ~770 nm.\n5. Isolation of Primary Murine Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells\nPerform steps 3.1-3.7 as described above.\nPlace aortas in cold HBSS until the dissections are complete. Carefully cut away any remaining periaortic fat and soft tissue, leaving only the aorta.\nUnder a sterile tissue culture hood, transfer the aortas to the Aortic Digestion Solution in 35 mm x 10 mm tissue culture dishes. Place in an incubator at 37 °C for 30 min with gentle intermittent rocking. After digestion, the aortas exhibit a stretched or frayed appearance.\nWith the dissection microscope and sterile forceps, remove the outer adventitial layer of the aorta while keeping the medial layer intact. One technique for removing the adventitia is to peel away the outer layer of the aorta at one end and remove it from the underlying medial layer like a sock could be peeled back and removed.\nOnce the adventitial layer has been removed, place the remaining aorta into a new tissue culture dish with cell culture media and store at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2-4 hr.\nUnder a sterile hood and using sterile 3 mm micro-dissection scissors, cut the aorta into 1-2 mm wide rings.",
    "Place these rings in a new tissue culture dish with Aortic Digestion Solution and incubate at 37 °C with gentle intermittent rocking for 120 min. Pipette the solution up and down several times during this incubation to resuspend cells.\nAdd 5 ml of warm cell culture media to the digestion solution and transfer to a 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tube for 5 min at 200 x g.\nAspirate the media and resuspend cells in the desired volume of cell culture media (e.g., 5 ml).\nPlate the entire amount of isolated cells from each aorta in a 25 cm2 cell culture flask and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Propagate cells using standard techniques, as previously described.25,48 During the initial 7-10 days of incubation, change the media every 72-96 hr. As the cells approach confluence, replenish media more frequently (every 48 hr).\n\tNote: It may take many weeks to grow a sufficient quantity of cells.\nOnce confluent, passage cells with trypsin that is warmed to 37 °C. \nAdd 0.5-1.0 ml of trypsin to each culture flask and incubate for 3-5 min; gently tap the side of the flask every 30-60 sec as needed to detach cells from the surface.\nOnce the cells detach from the bottom of the flask, add 10 ml of cell media to the cells in trypsin. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the media and trypsin from the cell pellet. Resuspend the cells in the desired amount of fresh cell media (e.g., 5-10 ml) and transfer to a new flask (with some cells transferred to a chamber slide).\nAt the first passage of cells, confirm the smooth muscle cell lineage with standard immunocytochemistry techniques, as previously described,49 using an antibody directed against α-smooth muscle actin.",
    "6. Inducing Calcification of Cultured Smooth Muscle Cells\nPlate cells obtained from 5.12 in a 6-well format. Note: Starting with 1 x 105 cells/well in a total volume of 2.0 ml of cell media per well is recommended.\nAllow cells to grow in Calcification Media A or B for at least 7 days in a 6-well plate format. Incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nChange cell media every 48 hr.\n7. Assessing VSMC Calcification Using the von Kossa Staining Method\nNote: The von Kossa method for measuring extracellular matrix calcification of tissues or cultured cells is based on the substitution of phosphate-bound calcium ions with silver ions.50 In the presence of light and organic compounds, the silver ions are reduced and visualized as metallic silver. Any unreacted silver is removed by treatment with sodium thiosulfate.50 The protocol for von Kossa staining is as follows:\nAspirate media from cell culture plates.\nFix cells by placing them in 1 ml of 10% formalin at room temperature for 20 min.\nRemove the formalin and wash the fixed cells with distilled water for 5 min.\nIncubate cells in 1 ml of 5% silver nitrate solution under a 60-100 W bulb for 1-2 hr.\nAspirate the silver nitrate solution and wash with distilled water for 5 min.\nRemove unreacted silver by placing the cells in 1 ml of 5% sodium thiosulfate (w/v) solution in distilled water for 5 min.\nRinse cells with distilled water for 5 min. Repeat washes 3x. The von Kossa stain is ready for imaging with standard inverted light microscopy.\nOptional Step: Counterstain with 1ml of nuclear fast red for 5 min. Follow this with three washes with distilled water (5 min each).\nOR\n8. Assessing VSMC Calcification with Near-infrared Fluorescent Imaging",
    "Note: Similar to its ability to identify calcification within mouse aortas, calcium NIR readily binds calcific mineral deposited by cultured cells. Using this technique, fluorescent microscopy and plate readers with long wavelength filters can image and quantify in vitro calcification, respectively. The long wavelength emission of the calcium NIR allows for the simultaneous utilization of lower wavelength emitting fluorophores to detect other features. The protocol for calcium NIR staining is as follows:\nAs described in Section 1.1.1, add 1.2 ml of 1x PBS to the vial containing 24 nmol of calcium NIR.\nDilute the calcium NIR stock 1:100 in the appropriate calcification or control media.\nAspirate cell media from culture plates and replace with the calcium NIR-containing culture media.\nIncubate the culture plates with calcium NIR media overnight at 37 °C.\nAspirate the media from the wells and wash the wells once with PBS.\n\tNote: At this point, the original culture media can be added to the wells, and the cells can be imaged live. Otherwise, proceed to the steps below.\nFix cells by placing them in 1 ml of 10% formalin at room temperature for 20 min.\nRemove the formalin and wash the fixed cells with distilled water for 5 min. Repeat washes 3x.\nOptional step: Perform immunofluorescence staining or other counterstains for proteins of interest.8,9\nImage or detect the calcium NIR stain using appropriate fluorescence excitation wavelengths (e.g., calcium NIR can be excited by 650-678 nm light) and emission filters (~ 680-700 nm).\nSubscription Required.
