    "Collect stem fragments (5 to 10 mm) of 30 day-old Arabidopsis plants of the main inflorescence from immediately above the uppermost rosette leaf in a 15 ml falcon (Figure 2A). Incubate for 30 min in 90% acetone.Wash twice with water by emptying the recipient and filling it with fresh water.Cover with 4% glutaraldehyde, 0.1% Tween 20 and vacuum infiltrate for 15 min.Leave at 4 °C overnight or longer. Stems can be stored in this fixative.Wash twice with water.Dehydrate in ethanol series up to 100% ethanol:30% ethanol (3 h) 50% ethanol (3 h) 75% ethanol (3 h) 95% ethanol (3 h) 100% ethanol (overnight) Incubate the stems in Preinfiltration solution overnight (minimum) at 4 °C. Incubate the stems in Infiltration solution at 4 °C (overnight minimum, up to two weeks). Fill the bottom of HISTORESIN MOLD TRAYS with embedding medium (Figures 2B, 2C). Immerse and orient the specimens in the mold trays (Figures 2D, 2E). Put the block holder adapter on the mold before polymerization so that it forms a single piece together with the block (Figures 2F, 2G).Allow to polymerize overnight at room temperature. Take out the block plus adaptor from the mold (Figures 2H-J).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141014/20141014000027_1845.jpgFigure 2. Making a resin block. A. Reactives needed for block making. B, C. The mold trays are filled with embedding medium. D, E. The specimens are immersed and orient in the mold trays. F, G. The block holder adapter is set on the mold before polymerization. H-J. The block plus adaptor is taken out of the mold.Fix it to the mobile head of the microtome (Figure 3A-3C).Cut 3-8 µm sections of resin-embedded specimens using a motorized microtome Leica RM2155 with tungsten carbide blades TC-65 (Figures 3C, 3D, Video 1).     <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1.",
    "Cutting and slides  Float sections in a 50 °C water/ethanol bath for a few seconds until the section flattens (Figures 3E, 3F, Video 1). About 40 ml of 100% ethanol per liter of water are added to restrict the rapid movements of the historesin sections occurring when floating in water.Collect sections on a glass slide (Figure 2G, Video 1) and allow to dry in an oven overnight at 50 °C. Optional staining step (only when a contrast staining solution is needed).Immerse the slides in cresyl violet staining medium 2-5 min.Wash with distilled water 2 min.Dry the excess of moisture from the slides using a kimwipe.Dry in oven for 15 min at 50 °C.Mount sections in Surgipath micromount.Cover with a coverslip. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141013/20141013233126_8133.jpgFigure 3.

Sections are collected with tweezers. F. Sections are put to float in a 50 °C water bath for a few seconds until the section flattens. G. Sections are collected on a glass slide.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141013/20141013233504_1840.jpgFigure 4.
