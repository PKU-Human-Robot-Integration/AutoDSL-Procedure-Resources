  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The in vivo animal study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Boston Children’s Hospital (Protocol Numbers: 13-10-2526R,14-02-2568R). All drugs used in this protocol are pharmaceutical grade and these drugs are prepared under sterile conditions. \n1. Fibrin Gel Preparation\nPrepare fibrin gel that contains VEGF and bFGF.\n\t\nThaw stock solutions of fibrinogen and thrombin that are stored at -80 °C to room temperature (25 °C).\nAdd thrombin (final concentration: 2.5 U/ml), CaCl2 (final concentration: 45 mM), VEGF (final concentration: 0-100 ng/ml) and bFGF (final concentration: 0-100 ng/ml) to the fibrinogen solution (final concentration: 12.5 mg/ml in 0.9% sodium chloride solution 43-45) in a 1.5 ml tube.\nMix gently by pipetting.\nGently pipette 200 µl of the mixture onto a sterile plastic dish in a drop-wise fashion using p200 pipette tip.\nIncubate the drops at 37 °C for 30-60 min until they solidify.\n\t\tNOTE: The solidified gel can be kept in the sealed plastic dish at room temperature (25 °C) for several hours before implantation (Figure 1a).\nTrim the fibrin gel into approximately 3 x 3 x 3 mm cubes using small surgical scissors before implantation.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nAnesthetize adult mouse (8-12 weeks) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and confirm that the mouse is adequately anesthetized by pinching toe of the mouse.\n\t\nUse vet ointment on eyes of the mouse to prevent dryness during the experiment.\nShave fur over left side of the rib cage of the mouse.\nPerform endotracheal intubation of the mouse.",
    "Place the mouse on the intubation stand angled at 70° and hold mouse in place by hooking its upper incisors over a small rubber band located at the top of the stand.\nGently retract the tongue to one side using blunt forceps.\nVisualize the larynx with the aid of a fiber-optic gooseneck microscope illuminator.\nInsert endotracheal elastic catheter (21 G) into the trachea.\nConfirm that the mouse is spontaneously breathing in a smooth way (regular 100-150 breaths/min, no paradoxical or shallow respiration).\nPlace the mouse in prone position under the dissection microscope.\nMechanically ventilate the mouse using a rodent ventilator (150 breaths/min and 7 ml/kg tidal volume).\nCount ribs to locate intercostal space between 4th and 5th rib.\nCreate a sterile field over the area by thoroughly wiping down with alcohol and Povidone-Iodine. Cover the surgical field adequately with a sterile surgical drape.\n3. Mouse Surgery\nAfter local injection of 0.25% bupivacaine (200 μl) in the skin, make a transverse skin incision (approximately 1 cm length) over the intercostal space using dissecting scissors.\nAfter injection of 0.25% bupivacaine (200 μl) into the intercostal muscle, make a muscle incision between the 4th and 5th rib using fine small scissors.\nInsert a dissecting retractor between the ribs to fully visualize the left lung.\n\t\nScrape a small area (1 x 1 mm square) of visceral pleura of the center of left lung using fine forceps.\nApply gentle pressure on the area using a sterile cotton swab until bleeding and air leaks are completely controlled.\nPut small amount of fresh mixture of fibrinogen/thrombin (fibrin glue) (step 1.1.2. 20 µl) over the area using p200 pipette tip.\nGently place one fibrin gel (step 1.2) using small forceps over the area (Figure 1b).",
    "Confirm that the gel is well fixed on the area during respiratory movements of the lung.\nMake sure that there is neither massive air leaking nor bleeding from the lung.\nClose incisions (muscle and skin layers) with absorbable suture, which does not have to be removed.\nAspirate the thoracic cavity using 27 G needle and 1 ml syringe to prevent pneumothorax.\nTerminate mechanical ventilation.\n4. Mouse Recovery\nMake sure the mouse is spontaneously breathing in a smooth way (regular 100-150 breaths/min, no paradoxical or shallow respiration).\nIP inject 1 ml of pre-warmed 0.9% NaCl to prevent dehydration.\nAllow mouse to recover on the circulating warm water pad.\nRemove the endotracheal tube after confirming that the mouse has stable breathing.\nInject Meloxicam (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection (SC), for 3 days as postoperative analgesic.\nMonitor the movements of the mouse carefully at a minimum of 15 min intervals until it is sternal (able to roll onto its stomach and remain upright) and conscious.\nAfter recovery, return the mouse to a new cage isolated from mice without surgery.\nMonitor the surgical site for signs of infection (redness, swelling, discharge), animal’s basic biologic functions (food and water intake, urination, defecation, body weight gain) as well as clinical signs of distress (piloerection, reduced locomotion) daily following the surgical procedure.\n5. Harvesting the Lung\n7 to 30 days after implantation, euthanize the mouse using CO2 via source of compressed gas.\nMake an incision between the tip of xyphoid process and the sternal notch (median sternotomy) and harvest whole lung with the implanted gel for histological and biochemical analysis by cutting the trachea and dissecting all connections to the heart, lungs, and trachea.",
    "Fix implanted gel with lung with 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight at 4 ºC, embed in OCT compound, and take serial step sections of 30 µm thickness.\nPerform histological (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and immunohistochemical analyses (endothelial marker: CD31, epithelial marker: aquaporin (AQP)5 and surfactant protein (SP)-B) using confocal microscope 22,37,40.\nCompile stacks of optical sections (30 µm thick) to form three-dimensional images of lung endothelial and epithelial cells using 3D image analysis software 37.\nQuantify projected areas of newly formed blood vessels using image analysis software 46.\nSubscription Required.
