    "All blood samples for iPSC generation and autopsied tissue collections are approved by Johns Hopkins IRB with Johns Hopkins ethics oversight. All patient information is HIPPA compliant. The following protocol adheres to all Johns Hopkins biosafety procedures.\n1. Preparation of slides for immunostaining and imaging\nPosition a positively charged glass microscope slide in an empty cytofunnel and draw a circle with a hydrophobic barrier pen to outline an area to deposit the nuclei.\nAdd 50 μL of 1 mg/mL collagen solution (diluted in 1x PBS) to the center of the circle drawn in step 1.1 and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAspirate the collagen solution and let the slides air dry at room temperature for about 1 h.\n2. Preparation of lysis buffer and sucrose gradients\nPrepare the lysis buffer and sucrose gradient solutions according to the nuclei isolation kit protocol.\n\t\nFor each sample, prepare a 50 mL conical tube of lysis buffer by combining 11 mL of the supplied lysis buffer, 110 μL of the supplied 10% Triton X-100 solution, and 11 μL of freshly prepared or thawed 1 M DTT (Dithiothreitol).\nFor each sample, use a 50 mL conical tube to prepare a 1.85 M sucrose cushion solution by combining 27.75 mL of the supplied 2 M sucrose cushion solution, 2.25 mL of the supplied sucrose cushion buffer, and 30 μL of freshly prepared or thawed 1 M DTT.\n\t\tNOTE: A 1.85 M sucrose cushion solution is optimal for iPSNs and postmortem human CNS tissue, but adjust it for other cell types or tissue samples. Additional details for HEK293 cells, iPSC-derived astrocytes, and enrichment of oligodendrocyte nuclei from postmortem CNS tissues have recently been published15.\nGently mix lysis buffer and sucrose cushion solutions by inverting conical tubes and store it on ice.",
    "3. Lysis of iPSNs and postmortem human CNS tissue\nBefore proceeding with the lysis, place the ultracentrifuge rotor (without sample holders) in the ultracentrifuge and allow it to pre-cool to 4 °C.\nLysis of iPSNs.\n\tNOTE: Lysis protocols differ for iPSNs and postmortem human CNS tissue. Follow the protocol for the sample type specified below (step 3.2: iPSNs, step 3.3: postmortem human CNS tissue).\n\t\nRemove the iPSNs from the incubator and aspirate the media. Rinse briefly with 1x PBS and add the lysis buffer directly to the well or plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to adequately rinse iPSNs with a sufficient quantity of 1x PBS to remove debris and dead cells. The volume of lysis buffer to be added to iPSN plates will vary. Please refer to Table 1. Ensure that the starting material is >2.5 million iPSNs.\nScrape the iPSNs with a cell scraper and transfer them to the remaining lysis buffer in the 50 mL conical tube.\nCap each conical tube and vortex the samples for 20 s to facilitate iPSN lysis.\nLet the samples sit on ice for 1-2 min before proceeding.\nLysis of postmortem human CNS tissues.\n\t\nWeigh out ~100 mg of frozen postmortem human CNS tissue by cutting with a razor blade in a Petri dish placed on a bed of dry ice. Be sure to work on a surface surrounded by disposable pads to avoid local tissue contamination. Pay attention to specific gray matter versus white matter dissections (e.g., cortical mantel versus underlying white matter) visible at the time of tissue dissection.",
    "NOTE: Wear the appropriate PPE, including eye protective wear and gloves when handling frozen postmortem human tissue samples. This step can also be completed ahead of time and tissue aliquots stored at -80 °C. 50 mg is a sufficient quantity for nuclei isolation. However, more than 100 mg tissue often yields incomplete isolation of nuclei, as evidenced by the presence of intact cytoplasm surrounding some nuclei.\nPrepare the Dounce homogenizer by cleaning and thoroughly rinsing with distilled water. Chill the homogenizer by placing it on ice.\nAdd 100 mg of tissue to freshly cleaned, rinsed, and chilled (on ice) Dounce homogenizer containing 2 mL of the prepared lysis buffer.\nHomogenize in Dounce homogenizer using the standard procedure on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, 10-20 strokes per pestle is sufficient to move through the sample without resistance.\nTransfer 2 mL of postmortem human brain homogenate to the remaining 9 mL of lysis buffer in conical tubes.\nVortex vigorously for 30 s and let it sit on ice for 5 min to facilitate lysis.\n4. Isolation of nuclei from iPSNs and postmortem human CNS tissue\nLayer 10 mL of 1.85 M sucrose cushion solution (made in step 2.1.2) at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and add 18 mL of 1.85 M sucrose cushion solution to each lysate.\nGently mix the lysate/sucrose cushion solution (combined in step 4.1) by inverting the 50 mL conical tube.\nSlowly add 28 mL of lysate/sucrose cushion solution mix to the top of the 10 mL of 1.85 M sucrose cushion solution in the ultracentrifuge tube (from step 4.1).",
    "NOTE: There is a total of 29 mL lysate/sucrose cushion solution mix in the 50 mL conical tube (steps 4.1-4.2). Leave 1 mL of this lysate/sucrose cushion solution mix in the 50 mL conical tube. This ensures accurate and consistent pipetting among all samples due to the viscosity of the sucrose cushion solution.\nPlace the ultracentrifuge tubes in the holders and add an additional 1.85 M sucrose cushion solution (made in step 2.1.2) as needed to balance the samples.\nPlace the sample holders in the rotor in the chilled ultracentrifuge and spin at 30,000 x g, 4 °C for 45 min.\nRemove the ultracentrifuge tubes from the sample holders and discard the supernatants. Nuclei will be visible as pellets on the bottom sides of the ultracentrifuge tube.\nResuspend the nuclei pellets in 1 mL of the supplied nuclei storage buffer by vortexing and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes at 2,500 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the nuclei by vortexing in fresh 1 mL of the supplied nuclei storage buffer.\nProceed with immunostaining or store the nuclei at -80 °C.\n\t​NOTE: Nuclei can be stored at -80 °C for up to 6 months and be subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles before structural integrity is compromised.\n5. Immunostaining of the isolated nuclei\nTake a 10 μL aliquot of the nuclei suspension and count using a hemacytometer or an automated cell counter.\nAssemble the prepared slides (from step 1.3) into the cytofunnels.\nTo each cytofunnel, layer 200 μL of fresh nuclei storage buffer and ~100,000 nuclei.\nGently spin the nuclei onto the slides by placing the cytofunnels into a cytospin and centrifuging for 3 min at 100 x g.",
    "Unclip the cytofunnels and immediately add ~100 μL of 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) to the slides and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Nuclei can also be fixed with methanol. Use fixation method appropriate for each antibody. If using methanol, skip the permeabilization step (5.7). Cytofunnels are single-use; discard them at this point.\nWash the nuclei 3x for 5 min with 1x PBS.\nPermeabilize the nuclei with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\nBlock the nuclei in block solution (10% goat or donkey serum in 1x PBS) for 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubate the nuclei with primary antibodies diluted in block solution overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the nuclei 3x for 5 min with 1x PBS.\nIncubate the nuclei with secondary antibodies diluted in block solution for 1 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Alexa Fluor 488, 568, and 647 secondary antibodies are preferred.\nWash the nuclei 3x for 5 min with 1x PBS.\nOPTIONAL: Incubate the nuclei for 5 min with DAPI or Hoechst followed by two additional 5 min washes with 1x PBS.\nHold a lint-free wipe at the edge of the circle containing nuclei to remove the last PBS wash completely.\nAdd 1 drop (~10 μL) of a hard mount antifade mounting media (without DAPI) to each slide and gently place high tolerance 18 mm x 18 mm square coverslips on each slide.\n\tNOTE: When using a hard-mount media, slide sealing is not necessary if slides are imaged within an appropriate time frame. Nup immunoreactivity has typically remained stable on unsealed slides stored at 4 °C for ~6 months. However, the edges of the coverslip can be sealed with a thin layer of nail polish if a wet-mount media is used or for prolonged storage.",
    "Keep the slides protected from light and let them cure overnight at room temperature.\nImage the nuclei can by super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM).\n\tNOTE: Zeiss, Nikon, and GE Healthcare all manufacture SIM microscopes. Follow the system-specific protocols for image acquisition and processing. Use imaging parameters (laser power, filter sets, exposure time) appropriate for each Nup and fluorophore. When imaging, avoid edges of the circle (from step 1.1) as these nuclei are typically flattened and spread out as a result of the centrifugation step (5.4). Fully deconvolved and processed images can be subjected to a number of analyses, including spot detection and volume measurements using standard 3D analysis modules in FIJI or Imaris image analytics software. Additional details on analysis methods have been recently published15.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
