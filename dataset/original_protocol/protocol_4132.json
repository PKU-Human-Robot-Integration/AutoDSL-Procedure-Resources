    "Enzymatic isolation protocol   Surgical specimens of human intestine are collected in R10 medium. The tissue is kept on ice and the isolation procedure started optimally within 1 h.   Underlying muscular layers and fat are removed with scissors and the remaining tissue is cut into small (< 5 mm) pieces with surgical knives (Figure 1). The tissue is placed into a 50 ml Falcon tube. The maximum amount of tissue in one tube should be approximately 4 g.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140328/20140328220255_0631.jpg Figure 1. Preparation of terminal ileum for enzymatic or migration based isolation protocols. A) Tissue is placed on a Petri dish and cut longitudinally to expose the mucosa (now facing upwards). B) The soft mucosal layer (containing the immune cells) is held by forceps and the underlying rigid muscular layer together with fat is then removed by cutting with scissors.  C) Prior to EDTA treatment, the mucosal layer obtained in B) is cut into approximately 5 mm sized pieces.  D) After the EDTA treatment, the tissue is cut into even smaller (1 mm) pieces. These can be then added directly in the bottom of a cell culture well (migration protocol) or in a beaker with enzymes (enzymatic protocol).    Epithelial cells are removed by incubating tissue fragments in 15 ml of HBSS supplemented with 5% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and EDTA (2 mM) for 15 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the tissue is shaken vigorously by hand for 15 sec (foam will appear) and the epithelial cells in suspension are removed by filtering through a nylon filter. The tissue pieces are collected from the filter and placed again in 50 ml Falcon tubes.    Repeat step A3 for a total of three times.   Confirm the denuded appearance of the tissue by light microscopy (Figure 2).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.",

Arrowheads in A) point to numerous villi with the clearly visible epithelial cell layers still intact. In B) the arrow heads point to the missing epithelium. Tiny pieces (1 mm) of intestine were placed directly on glass objective slides together with a drop of R10 medium and a glass coverslip. Images were acquired with a 5x objective and a digital camera attached to the microscope.    Transfer remaining tissue pieces to a Petri dish. Cut in very fine pieces (< 1 mm) using a needle/forceps and a surgical scissor/scalpel. Look carefully if there are any big pieces left, cut more (Figure 1).   Transfer the fragments into plastic beakers making sure that all pieces are transferred from the Petri dish.   Wash the tissue fragments with 20 ml of R10 to remove any remaining EDTA, which may otherwise interfere with enzyme activity in the subsequent step. The pieces will sediment to the bottom of the beaker, remove the R10 with a pipette.   For isolation of macrophages and DC, the tissue fragments are digested for 2 x 60 min at 37 °C in 10 ml of R10 containing Liberase TM (0.13 Wünsch units/ml) and DNase I (20 IU/ml) with magnetic stirring in plastic beakers with lid. Change the medium and enzymes after the first 60 min and then incubate another 60 min. The cell suspensions are pooled after filtering through 100 µM cell strainers. For T cells, incubate in 20 ml of R10 containing collagenase 1A (1 mg/ml) and DNase I (10 U/ml) with agitation for 60 min. The obtained cell suspension is filtered through 70 µM cell strainer.",
    "The single cell suspension is washed in 20 ml of R10 and pelleted at 177 x g for 10 min.   Approximately 4 x 106 T cells, 5,000 CD11c+CD103+ DC and 50,000 CD14+ cells can be isolated from each gram of tissue as calculated by cell sorting (weighed after removal of muscular layer). These numbers are however only an estimate as the donor/preparation variation is high.   Example of flow cytometry analysis from retrieved cell populations is shown in Figure 3.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140328/20140328220451_7513.jpg Figure 3. Isolation of human T cells, DC and macrophages. Human intestine was treated with either Collagenase 1A to isolate T cells or Liberase TM to isolate DC macrophages, as described above. The resulting cell suspensions were stained for multicolour FACS analysis. After gating for size and granularity on the FSC/SSC profile, single, live CD3+ cells were gated and analysed for the expression of CD4 and CD8. For DC/macrophage analysis, live CD45+Lin-HLADR+ events were analysed for the expression of CD103 and CD14 showing both CD103+ DC and CD14hi/CD14lo macrophages. Comparison between liberase and migration based isolation method shows less CD14+ macrophages when the cells were allowed to migate out from the tissue. (Lin= CD3, CD19, CD20, CD56, TCRab)       Migration based isolation protocol   The intestine is collected, cleaned and the epithelial cells removed as in the previous section resulting in tiny pieces (< 1 mm) of denuded tissue.    Approximately 5 pieces of tissue/well are placed in 2 ml of R10 medium in ultra low attachment 24-well culture plates.   The tissues are incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 to allow cells to migrate out of the tissue.   Place the plate on ice for 30 min in order to detach any plate bound cells.",
    "The tissue pieces are discarded and the medium containing migrated cells, is collected from the wells and cells pelleted by centrifugation at 177 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.   Example of staining of the DC subsets is shown in Figure 4.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140328/20140328220543_8710.jpg Figure 4. Characterisation of CD103+ DC subsets in the human intestine. DC were allowed to migrate out of human small intestinal preparations as described above. The cells were stained for multicolour FACS analysis with antibodies to CD3, CD19, CD20, CD56, TCRαβ(Lin), CD45, HLA-DR, CD11c, CD14 and CD103. The contour plots show Live CD45+Lin-HLADR+CD11c+CD103+CD14- events. DCs were assessed for expression of SIRPα and CD141."
