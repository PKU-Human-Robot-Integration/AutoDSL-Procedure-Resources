    "1. Introduction\nIn this video, we describe methods for retinal dissections and immunohistochemistry at three defined developmental periods: the third instar larval, the midpupal and the adult stage. Although our protocol also works for other pupal stages (for details on earlier stages, see 16), we chose the midpupal stage, as it is optimal for imaging all PRs in one focal plane and their nuclei are easily identifiable, which facilitates the visualization of transcription factor expression patterns. The dissection of late pupal retinas is very similar to the dissection of adult retinas.\nFirst, we demonstrate how to collect larvae and pupae at the desired stages. Then, we explain how to obtain optimal dissections of larval 17-18, midpupal and adult retinas. Second, we demonstrate how to visualize PR development at these stages using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.\n2. Staging and Preparation of Specimen\nThe developmental period of insects is temperature-dependent. To facilitate reproducible staging of larvae and pupae, we recommend raising all fly stocks at 25 °C under a 12 hr/12 hr light/dark cycle.\nThird-instar larvae: About 96 hr after egg laying (at 25 °C), late third instar larvae stop feeding and wander on the walls of the food vial, where they eventually pupate. Use a soft brush or a forceps to gently remove a wandering third-instar larva from the wall of the food vial.\n50% pupae ('midpupae') are observed about 48 hr after pupation. For exact timing, you can circle just-formed white pupae with a marker on the food vial. Alternatively, move all white pupae to a new vial to obtain a vial of uniform staging (for staging of pupae using morphological criteria, see 19). After 48 hr, carefully remove the midpupae from the vial using a forceps.",
    "Adult flies: Anesthetize young adult flies (2-5 days after eclosion) on a CO2 pad. Remove heads using a forceps and store them in a glass well dish containing cold 1x PBS.\n3. Dissection Procedure (About 1-2 hr per Experiment)\nAfter collecting the specimen, place them in a drop of cold PBS on a Sylgard dissection dish. Dissect about 10-15 retinas per genotype.\nPlease consult the Material Safety Data Sheets as well as your institution's Environmental Health and Safety Office for proper handling of the reagents and equipment (see tables at the end of this protocol).\n1. Larval Eye Imaginal Discs\nLocate the anterior end of the larva, which contains the mouth hooks. Use a forceps to press the middle part of the larva gently against the base of the Sylgard dish. Use another forceps to grab the mouth hooks and pull gently and slowly away from the body. Discard the main part of the body and use the mouthparts to hold the anterior part in order to remove extraneous tissue from the imaginal discs that remain attached to the brain.\nTransfer brain with imaginal discs by grabbing the mouth hooks with a forceps to 1x PBS in a three-well glass dish. Perform fixation step (step 4.1.).\nAfter fixation, remove salivary glands, fat tissue and pull the brain away from the eye-antennal imaginal disc. To improve accessibility of 'difficult' antibodies, the peripodial membrane, which is located on the surface of the epithelium, can be removed by holding down the antennal part of the disc and peeling the membrane away with a dissecting pin. Next, perform immunohistochemistry (step 5.1.).\n2. 50% Pupation/Midpupal Retinas",
    "Hold posterior end of the pupal case with a forceps. Gently remove the anterior surface of the pupal case by grabbing the cuticle with another forceps and slowly pull away from the puparium. Peel away residual cuticle to expose the head.\nUse the forceps' tips to pierce the underlying, soft sack in the dorsal anterior region. This provides access to the head. Gently separate the head from the thorax by slowly sucking up the head with a P20 pipette. Expel head from pipette tip into fresh cold 1x PBS and remove excess tissue; grab the head cuticle and remove proboscis. Proceed to fixation step (step 4.1.).\nPierce the optic lobe with one dissecting pin to steady the tissue. Insert the other dissecting pin between the lamina and retina to separate the retina from the lamina/optic lobe. Perform immunohistochemistry (step 5.1.).\n3. Adult Eyes\nGrab the center of the posterior head capsule with a forceps and remove mouth parts (proboscis), fat tissue and tracheae.\nGrab the dorsal head cuticle with one forceps and use the other to separate eyes from brain tissue by gently pulling sideways. In most cases, the lamina, a thin and transparent sheath of brain neuropil, will stay attached to the retina. It is easier to remove the lamina after fixation.\nRemove cuticle at the eye margin, but leave a small piece behind to facilitate the transfer of retinas to different solutions. Perform fixation (step 4.1.).",
    "Remove the lamina by grabbing it at one side with a forceps and gently pulling sideways with the other forceps without impairing the retina. Remove residual cuticle, as it could fold onto the retina during mounting. These two steps are critical for visualizing photoreceptors, which would otherwise be obscured by the lamina and remains of cuticle during the imaging process. Proceed to immunohistochemistry (step 5.1.).\n4. Fixation and Washing (About 1 hr)\nStore the dissected retinas in 1x PBS in a three-well glass dish placed on ice while freshly preparing the fixative (dilute 40 microliters of 37% formaldehyde solution with 360 μl of 1x PBS, vortex and store on ice). We recommend to proceed with the fixation protocol and to avoid long storage times on ice (>15 min).\nReplace 1x PBS with 200 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde solution. Make sure the tissue is submerged in fixative. This is critical, as it may otherwise not be fixed properly. If necessary, remove air bubbles and tracheae with the forceps.\nIncubate on shaker for 15 min at room temperature.\nReplace fixative with 1x PBS and rinse twice with 1x PBS. Continue washing in PBS for 30 min (on shaker, at room temperature).\nReplace PBS with PBST. Rinse twice with PBST.\nProceed with removing the peripodial membrane from larval eye discs (3.1.3.) and the laminas from midpupal/adult retinas (3.2.3., 3.3.4.).\n5. Immunohistochemistry\nBlocking: Replace PBS with 200 μl of 5% normal serum in PBST and incubate retinas for 20 min on shaker at room temperature.\nReplace blocking solution with primary antibody solution. Seal the three-well dish with parafilm and incubate overnight on shaker at room temperature.\nReplace solution with PBST and rinse 3 times. Continue washing with PBST for a minimum of 1 hr on shaker at room temperature.",
    "Transfer in secondary antibody solution and incubate in a parafilm-sealed glass well dish on shaker overnight at room temperature.\nReplace antibody solution with PBST and rinse three times. Continue washing with PBST for a minimum of one hr on shaker at room temperature. The samples can be kept in PBST for several days, but it is critical to add fresh PBST at least once per day to prevent them from drying out.\n6. Mounting\nFor mounting larval and midpupal retinas, use the P20 to transfer retinas to the center of a clean glass slide. Remove excess PBST. Use a forceps to align retinas in order to facilitate imaging.\nAdd 10 μl of mounting medium on top of the retinas. Cover them gently with a 24x40-1 cover slip and seal with clear nail polish.\nFor mounting adult retinas, prepare 'bridges' 20: Add two 5 μl droplets of 50% glycerol on both ends of a glass side and cover them with 22x22-1 cover slips (0.13 to 0.17 mm thick).\nRemove the PBST with a P20 pipette; make sure that the retinas do not dry out. Add 20 μl of mounting medium to the well. Use mounting medium to transfer retinas with the P20 to the 'bridge' glass slide.\nUse a forceps to orient (lenses should face the glass slide) and align retinas in order to facilitate imaging. If necessary, remove air bubbles with the P20.\nSlowly place 24x40-1 cover slip (0.13 to 0.17 mm thick) from one side on top and seal edges with clear nail polish or Scotch tape. Store samples at 4 °C in a microscope slide saver box (keep in the dark).\n7. Representative Results",
    "As an example for the application of this protocol, we show representative results for visualizing photoreceptor differentiation at the three developmental stages in the video. A larval eye-antennal disc and a midpupal retina were stained with antibodies that label different photoreceptor types during their development (Figure 1A, B) and an adult retina was stained with two Rhodopsin antibodies to visualize two photoreceptor subtypes (Figure 1C).Subscription Required.
