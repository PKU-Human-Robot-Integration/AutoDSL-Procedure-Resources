    "1. Preparation of precursors\nPreparation of cellulose nanocrystals suspension\n\tNOTE: Isolation of cellulose nanocrystals is done according to the procedure reported by Mathew, et al30.\n\t\nDilute 17 wt% suspension of cellulose nanocrystals to 2 wt% by adding distilled water to make a total volume of 2 L. Mix thoroughly using ultra sonication and use smaller batches (250-300 mL) for efficient mixing.\nPass the sonified suspension through the homogenizer 10 times at a pressure of 500-600 bar. At this point, a thick transparent gel of 2 wt% cellulose nanocrystals is obtained.\nConcentrate 2 wt% cellulose nanocrystals gel to 11 wt% through centrifugations at 24,500 x g for 1.5 h. Decant water out in between every 30 min.\n\t\t​NOTE: Experiment can be paused here.\nPreparation of matrix phases\n\t\nPrepare homogeneous solution of 6 wt% sodium alginate (SA) in distilled water at 60 °C under continuous stirring.\nPrepare homogeneous solution of 12 wt% gelatin (Gel) in distilled water at 60 °C under continuous stirring.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare a volume of 20 mL for matrix solutions and store in refrigerator.\nPreparation of crosslinkers\n\t\nPrepare the solution of 3 wt% calcium chloride in distilled water at room temperature under continuous stirring.\nPrepare the solution of 3 wt% glutaraldehyde in distilled water at room temperature under continuous stirring.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare a volume of 50 mL for crosslinking solutions and store in room temperature. Refer to the Table of Materials for vendor information. Experiment can be paused here.\n2. Preparation of hydrogel ink\nPrepare 40 mL of hydrogel ink in a polystyrene container by mixing 11 wt% CNC, 6 wt% SA and 12 wt% Gel to obtain a wet (wt%) composition of CNC/SA/Gel/Water: 6.87/1.50/1.50/90.12.\nHeat the mixture to 40 °C and mix with a spatula until a smooth paste is obtained.",
    "Transfer the mixture into a 60 mL syringe. Pass the mixture through a series of nozzles with different diameters into another 60 mL syringe, with the help of mechanical clamp. Repeat the process until smoothly extruded filaments of hydrogel ink are obtained. Start with nozzle with biggest diameter of 800 µm, followed by 600 µm and 400 µm.\nGently centrifuge (4,000 x g) the syringe filled with hydrogel ink to remove trapped air.\n\tNOTE: Experiment can be paused here.\n3. Measurement of rheological properties of hydrogel\nNTE: Perform the rheological properties by using a smooth cone-on-plate geometry, CP25-2-SN7617, diameter 25 mm, 2° nominal angle and gap height 0.05 mm at 25 °C.\nTurn on the rheometer, air compressor and temperature control box. Initialize the software.\nMount the measuring tool in the rheometer and set zero-gap.\nExtrude approximately 1 mL of the hydrogel ink onto the rheometer platform.\nMeasure the viscosity as a function of shear rate. Select the shear rate range from 0.001 to 1,000.\nAfter the measurement is done, clean the rheometer platform and measuring tool. Extrude 1 mL of fresh hydrogel ink again on the rheometer platform.\nMeasure storage moduli (G′) and loss moduli (G″) as a function of shear stress at a frequency of 1 Hz. Select the shear stress range from 103 to 107.\nOnce the tests are completed, copy the data into text file and plot rheological curves in logarithmic scale.\n4. File preparation for 3D Printing\nNOTE: Cura 2.4.0 software is used for designing 3D scaffolds (20 mm3) having three types of pores. 1- Uniform pores of 0.6 mm, 2- uniform pores of 1.0 mm and 3- gradient pores of range 0.5-1 mm.\nDownload stereolithography (stl) file of a solid cube from thingsinverse.com and open the file in Cura.",
    "Click the loaded model and move it to X/Y/Z : 0/0/0 mm. Click Scale, uncheck box for Uniform scaling and set the dimensions to  X/Y/Z : 20/20/20 mm. Click Rotate and rotate the cube by 45° in XY plane.\nIn the side panel, in Nozzle & Material, select 0.4 mm and paste the profile. Select Discov3ry complete as the printer.  \nIn the side panel, select Custom for Print Setup. Under Quality section, enter 0.2 mm for all sub sections. Under Shell section, enter 0 mm for all sub sections. Under Material section, enter 26 °C for temperature, 1 mm Diameter and 100 % Flow. Under Speed section, enter 30 mm/s as Print Speed and 120 mm/s as Travel Speed. Under Support section, uncheck the box for Enable Support. Under Build Plate Adhesion section, select Skirt, enter 3 mm as Skirt Distance and 150 mm as Skirt/Brim Minimum length.\nFor scaffolds with uniform pore size, enter 0.6 or 1 mm Infill Line Distance and select Grid Infill Pattern.\nFor gradient porosity scaffolds, Merging and Grouping tool is used. Right click the loaded model, select Multiple Models, enter 2 and press OK. Scale each model as X/Y/Z : 20/20/7 mm. Place the models on top of each other. Enter Infill Line Distance as 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 mm for bottom, middle and top model, respectively. Select all three models (Ctrl + A), right click and click Group Models.\nSave the models on the Sure Digital (SD) card. Cura automatically save the file as gcode that is read by the printer.\n5. 3D printing porous scaffolds\nInsert the transfer tube into the nozzle holder and connect 400 µm nozzle to it. Level the build plate to get the correct distance between the build plate and nozzle.",
    "Load the centrifuged syringe into the cartridge and connect it to the other side of the transfer tube.\nInsert the SD card into the printer, select Purge fast and start purging the hydrogel ink until it starts to extrude from the nozzle. Continue purging for 2-3 min to obtain a homogeneous flow.\nFrom the SD card, select the saved files for uniform and gradient porosity scaffolds and start printing. Keep an eye on the extrusion rate. If needed, adjust the speed and flow rate accordingly. For smaller pore size, use faster speed combined with low flow rate (50 mm/s and 70%).\n\tNOTE: Do not touch the 3D printed scaffolds.\n 6. Crosslinking of 3D printed scaffolds\nAfter the 3D printing is complete, gently add drops of 3 wt% CaCl2 to the scaffold until it becomes completely wet. Wait for 5 min.\nVery carefully transfer the scaffold from the printer to a 50 mL container filled with 3 wt% CaCl2. Leave it overnight.\nWash thoroughly with distilled water and transfer the scaffold to a 50 mL container filled with 3 wt% glutaraldehyde. Leave it overnight.\nWash thoroughly and store the 3D printed scaffold in distilled water.\n7. Compression testing\nNOTE: Perform compression tests with 100 N load cell in water at 37 °C.\nFill the container equipped with submersible compression base plate with 2 L of water and start the heating system to reach 37 °C.\nInitialize Bluehill Universal software and set up the testing method. Select rectangular specimen geometry and choose the option to enter dimensions before testing each sample.  Set the strain rate to 2 mm/min and end of result as 80% compressive strain together with 90 N force.",
    "In the Measurement section, select force, displacement, compressive stress and compressive strain. Choose the option to export data as text files for future plotting.\nSet the zero extension point by using the jog controls to lower crosshead plate as close as possible to base plate.\nMeasure and note the dimensions of the samples to be tested.\nWhen the water temperature reaches to 37 °C, place the sample on the base plate.  Secure the sample by moving the crosshead plate so that it starts to touch the sample.\nMove the water bath up, so that the plates with the sample in-between them are immersed in water.\nEnter sample name and dimensions. Start the test.\nAfter the test is complete, first move the water bath down and then raise the crosshead plate.\nRemove the sample and its pieces, if any, clean both the plates and load a new sample.\nAfter all the samples are tested, export the raw data. Plot compressive stress vs. compressive strain curves and determine the compressive tangent modulus at strain values of 1-5 % and 25-30 %.\n\tNOTE: Place the gradient cube in such a way that the larger holes face the stationery base plate.\n\tFirst secure the scaffold in between the grips and then start/stop the measurement.\nSubscription Required.
