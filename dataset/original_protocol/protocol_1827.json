    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrimary immunization\nTiming: 24 h\nPrimary immunization of mice with 80 μg [4Y] MBP\nPrepare [4Y] MBP at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ mL in 1× PBS, with 200 μL volume required per mouse, plus 10% extra as buffer. Keep on ice.\nInject Tg4 Tiger Nr4a3-Tocky mice with 200 μL peptide (80 μg total dose) subcutaneously into the right flank using a 0.5 mL insulin needle and syringe.\nAfter injection of the peptide, remove the needle and gently pinch skin for 10 s to minimize peptide/ PBS leakage.\nLeave mice for 24 h.\nCritical: A bolus shape should form under the skin if injection is subcutaneous. If significant amounts of peptide/PBS solution leaks after injection (>5–10 μL) then that mouse should be excluded from the experiment.\nAdministration of anti-PD1 immunotherapy\nTiming: 30–60 min\nPreparation and injection of anti-PD1 antibodies\nPrepare anti-PD1 and isotype control antibodies at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ mL in sterile 1× PBS. You will require 200 μL per mouse plus 10% excess volume.\nInject 0.5 mg (200 μL) of anti-PD1 or isotype control i.p. 24 h after the primary immunization.\nWait for 30 min.\nCritical: It is crucial to allow a minimum of 30 minutes for the antibodies to distribute in the mouse before re-challenge with peptide. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPeptide re-challenge of mice\nTiming: 4 h\nRechallenge of mice with 8 μg [4Y] MBP\nPrepare [4Y] MBP at a concentration of 0.04 mg/ mL in 1× PBS, with 200 μL volume required per mouse, plus 10% extra as buffer. Keep on ice.\nInject Tg4 Tiger Nr4a3-Tocky mice with 200 μL peptide (8 μg total dose) subcutaneously into the left flank using a 0.5 mL insulin needle and syringe.",
    "After injection of the peptide, remove the needle and gently pinch skin to for 10 s to minimize peptide/ PBS leakage.\nLeave mice for 4 h.\nNote: 8 μg is a recommended rechallenge dose. However, lowering or raising this dose will alter the proportion of responder T cells (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] (Elliot et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]))\nCritical: A bolus shape should form under the skin if injection is subcutaneous. If significant amounts of peptide/PBS solution leaks after injection (>5–10 μL) then that mouse should be excluded from the experiment.\nSpleen harvest and generation of splenocyte suspensions\nTiming: 1–2 h\nAfter 4 h peptide rechallenge, euthanize mice, and process spleen for flow cytometric staining\nMice are euthanized and the whole spleen is removed intact from the Tg4 Nr4a3-Tocky mice. Ensure complete detachment of the pancreas and place it into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 mL of 2% FBS/ PBS (v/v).\nInto a sterile 5 mL petri dish, place a 70 μm cell strainer and add the spleen and 1 mL of 2% FBS PBS buffer. (Alternatively, a strainer can be placed in a 50 mL Falcon tube for processing).\nUsing the syringe plunger from a 5 mL syringe, gently force the spleen through the cell strainer.\nUsing a P1000 pipette add 1 mL 2% FBS PBS buffer to wash the strainer.\nFilter the splenocyte solution back through the strainer by taking from suspension in the petri dish and pipetting back onto the strainer.\nRepeat this 8–10 times using P1000 pipette until suspension is homogenous.\nTransfer the splenocyte suspension from each mouse into individual 15 mL Falcon tubes.\nWash strainer with 1 mL 2 % FBS PBS and transfer this to the 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge Falcon tube at 500 g for 5 min at 15°C–25°C.",
    "Decant supernatant and proceed to perform red blood cell lysis by resuspending the cell pellet in 1 mL of RBC lysis buffer.\nIncubate for 2 min on ice.\nTop up falcon tube to 10 mL with cold 2% FBS PBS and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend splenocytes in 2 mL ice cold 2% FBS PBS.\nRemove with a P1000 pipette any cell clumps that may have formed.\nTransfer 100 μL of splenocyte suspension (typically 2–5M splenocytes) to a 96 well U bottom plate for staining. Alternatively, cells can be stained in 5 mL FACS tubes.\nFlow cytometric staining\nTiming: 1 h\nFlow cytometric staining (for 96 well plate staining)\nCentrifuge 96 well plate at 500 g for 3 min at 15°C–25°C.\nPrepare master mix of antibodies in 2% FBS PBS containing 1 in 2000 dilution of fixable viability dye eFluor780, as per table below.\nOptional: For splenocyte analysis we do not routinely perform Fc receptor block, however this can be included at this stage.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1419_4.csv\nStain samples in 25 μL of antibody master mix.",
    "Critical: Remember to include compensation controls. Unstained splenocytes can be used for compensation of Nr4a3-Timer Red (PE-Texas Red channel) as per (Jennings et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). As stated previously, the staining panel design is optimized to not require compensation between Nr4a3-Timer Blue (BV421 channel), GFP (FITC channel) and the other channels. For tandem dyes like PE-Cy7 use the same antibody from the panel master mix. Typical cytometer settings, channels and compensation matrix are shown earlier for reference, suggested controls are listed below. NB Timer Blue and Timer Red are excited by different lasers (405 nm versus 561 nm) and emit in different ranges (Timer Blue ∼ 450 nm, Timer Red ∼ 610 nm) so compensation between these two channels is not necessary. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1419_5.csv\nIncubate plate at 4°C for 20 min.\nAdd 180 μL of ice cold 2% FBS PBS to each well and centrifuge plate at 500 g for 3 min at 15°C–25°C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend pellets in 150 μL 2% FBS PBS and transfer to 5 mL FACS tubes.\nWells can be rinsed with 150 μL 2% FBS PBS and combined in FACS tube to give a total volume of 300 μL for acquisition.\nKeep cells on ice in dark and acquire data on flow cytometer within 2–4 h.\nCritical: Do not fix cells as this will result in loss of Nr4a3-Timer Blue fluorescence. Due to slow maturation of Timer protein from Blue to Red it is advised that data are acquired soon after completion of staining. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]"
