First, one should turn on all the electronic components: power supply of the OT laser; microscope; positioning stage; computer and all other accessories; temperature control; atmosphere control and any other component that may exist in the assembly. The anti-vibration table should also be activated in this step. Once the computer is initialized, certify that all the required software is loaded correctly. In our system, a joystick is used to better control the stage position. Any such gadget should be started, calibrated, and/or verified at this moment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Schematic representation showing the OT microscope with the culture chamber\n(A) OT microscope representation.\n(B) Zoom showing the culture chamber attached to the OT microscope system.\nNote that the infrared laser is directed to the microscope and reaches the back entrance of the objective lens. The culture chamber used in our system controls temperature and CO2 concentration, allowing real-time and living cell experiments.",
    "Microscope objective lens inspection For tether extraction experiments with OT, an appropriate objective lens with a numerical aperture (NA) between 1.2 and 1.4 must be used. In our system, a PLAN APO 100× 1.4 NA DIC H Nikon objective lens is used. This type of lens requires careful manipulation and storage to avoid any dust accumulation on its surface. At this step, the chosen lens, previously calibrated, should be installed or checked for proper connection (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nTemperature Stabilization To extract tethers from living cells, strict control of temperature and other optimal culture conditions is essential. The temperature must be set according to the cell culture of interest, using a temperature control system attached to the microscope. In our setup, an acrylic chamber encloses the sample holder (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). Since the entire optical system can experience some variation with temperature, it is recommended to wait for temperature stabilization inside the chamber before introducing the sample. In our system, this step can take up to 15–30 min.\nSample preparation and positioning: this sub-step assumes that cells were previously cultured in the aforementioned glass-bottom dishes.\nDispersing the beads within the sample Polystyrene beads are used as probes for the OT. These beads must be dispersed in the medium before tether extraction.\nNote: The use of a biological safety cabinet and properly sterilized materials is advised to avoid contaminants that might interfere with the results. The optimal number of beads to be added to the sample will depend on the size of the sample dish and the volume of culture medium utilized. For a glass-bottom dish with 8.8 cm2 of bottom surface area and 2 mL of culture medium, 1 μL of a bead solution (number of beads estimated at 1.68 × 106 beads) has worked properly in our setup.",
    "Adjusting the sample position in the microscope Once the beads are dispersed, the glass-bottom dish can be placed into the microscope. The NA of the used objective lens implies that an immersion oil objective lens is used. The lens immersion medium should be applied immediately before sample positioning. In our setup, the sample is positioned inside an atmosphere-controlled acrylic chamber. After the sample is moved to the chamber, the objective lens is approached to the glass-bottom dish until the immersion oil touches the outer bottom face of the coverslip.\nFor living cells: adjusting CO2 level After proper placement of the sample, the CO2 controlled injection system can be turned on. The setup used is illustrated in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]. For most cell cultures, a CO2 concentration of 5% is used, reproducing the conditions of a cell incubator. Wait for the CO2 stabilization. If atmosphere control is not needed, this step can be skipped. If a different CO2 concentration is needed, adjust accordingly.\nKohler Illumination With both atmosphere and temperature control stabilization, the Kohler Illumination procedure must be employed to ensure that the sample is optimally illuminated.\nCritical: The procedure for tether force measurement relies on image analysis. If the optical system is not properly aligned, the generated image can be less clear, and the tether force values wrongly determined.\nObtaining the OT equilibrium position for the reference bead For this section, the equilibrium position of a trapped bead is determined as a reference for zero force.",
    "Setting the laser output The laser equipment in our setup [an infrared, 1,064 nm, polarized and collimated laser beam model YLR-5-1064-LP (IPG Photonics, NY, USA)] allows output controls in percentage parameters, from 0% to 100% of its emission power capacity. To perform tether extraction experiments, the laser power that reaches the back focal plane of the objective lens should be around 1 W. In our setup, the powermeter is placed above the microscope stage (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). Ensure that the laser power is checked before and after the tether pulling experiments, to avoid any variation that might affect the tether force measurements.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Schematic representation of how to measure the OT laser power\nVideo capture parameters In the chosen video acquisition software, one should define the capture parameters. Although the resolution is limited by the available frame grabber, the imaging software usually allows controlling the frames/second (fps) and the total acquisition time. The minimum recommended frame rate for capture is 10 fps. As for the total time, the minimum recommendation is 20 s.\nVideo of the reference bead Find a region of the sample clean of debris and cells. Turn on the laser in the chosen power intensity and trap a bead with the OT. Start the video capture, at the established parameters. Save the video and tag it accordingly.\nCritical: During video acquisition, if any type of debris crosses or gets captured by the OT, restart the procedure.\nMembrane tether extraction and video acquisition\nApproaching a cell of interest In the sample, search for a cell with enough space around it to allow tether extraction. Turn on the laser emission with the same parameters used previously to obtain the video of the reference bead. Capture a nearby bead and place it near the chosen cell (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig12.jpg",
    "Figure 12. Schematic representation of a typical tether extraction experiment\n(A) Trapping a bead with the OT.\n(B and C) Pressing the OT-trapped bead against the cell surface to allow bead attachment.\n(D) Tether extraction experiment, indicating tether formation. Δx is the variation between the probe’s position during tether extraction and the corresponding position of zero force reference.\n(E) Tether recoil after turning off the OT laser.\nAdhering the OT-trapped bead to the cell surface Approach the OT-trapped bead to the cell surface by pressing it against the cell membrane for 5–10 s (Figures 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]B and 12C).\nNote: To press the bead against the cell surface, first place the OT-trapped bead above a chosen cell, then use the microscope and move the focus toward the coverslip. Consequently, the OT-trapped bead will also move toward the coverslip until it touches the cell surface. As soon as it touches the cell surface, you should be able to identify a visual change in the OT-trapped bead image, caused by a slight displacement in the optical axis direction, indicating the pressure done by the OT.\nNote: In our experiments, we typically use uncoated polystyrene beads as we have previously demonstrated that bead coating or size do not affect tether pulling (Pontes et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). The coating only helps to induce a more efficient first contact between the bead and cell surface. The most important caution must be to properly press the OT-trapped bead against the cell surface. The beads are attached to the cell surface by nonspecific adhesions which likely involve Van der Waals forces.",
    "Critical: This step should be performed as fast as possible, since the contact of the bead with the cell membrane distorts the nearby cytoskeleton, reorienting actin filaments lining from parallel to perpendicular to the membrane surface, and even attempting to phagocyte the bead if allowed enough time, especially in professional phagocytes (Icard-Arcizet et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nMembrane tether extraction experiment After waiting for bead attachment, use the positioning stage to move the entire sample (in the xy direction), trying to separate the bead from the cell. This step can be performed with controlled velocity. In our setup, we typically use velocity of 1.0 μm/s. Other velocities can be used according to the sample (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]D). It should be possible to roughly see the shape of the tether if the optical system is clear enough. Pull until a distance of 3–5 bead diameters is reached, to properly extend the tether. Keep the tether extended for the remaining time of the video acquisition. After video completion, turn the laser emission off and observe the bead recoil (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]E).\nNote: Bead recoil is an important step for validating the measurement. If the bead is pulled back in the direction of the membrane, this indicates the presence of a membrane tether (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]E). If the bead resumes regular Brownian motion, the tether might have broken or might even not have been formed at all. It is also possible to observe more than one tether attached to the bead at the same time. In this case, the recoil movement of the bead is erratic, oscillating between two or more directions. Some other interferences, such as vibrations or debris, can disturb the experiment, requiring repetition of the measurement.",
    "Note: An interesting analogy is to compare the procedure to a tug of war between the OT and the cell, both trying to hold the bead. At a given moment the OT wins by pulling out part of the cell surface in the form of a membrane tube or tether.\nRepeat until conclusion After correctly recording a membrane tether extraction, repeat the steps initiating in a. Repetition should be performed for at least 20 different times and from different cells on the dish.\nMeasuring the membrane tether force\nThis section describes the steps and procedures to precisely measure the tether force.\nMeasurement of laser output As mentioned before, the value of laser power P that reaches the sample is used to determine k and, therefore, the tether force, F0. To verify the laser power, a powermeter is used. For the assembly illustrated, it is necessary to remove both the microscope condenser unit and the objective lens. Usually, as cited earlier, the mean value of power should be around 1 W (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). At least 2 different measurements of power should be performed, before and after the tether pulling experiment, to obtain the mean value of power with its respective error bar.\nNote: The value acquired is not the power that reaches the sample, since a large fraction of the power is dispersed when passing through the objective lens system. The transmittance of the lens should be evaluated and accounted for, during calibration.\nCritical: If your OT system is calibrated and stable, small variations in power are acceptable (in our setup, 5%–10% variations are considered acceptable). However, if one observes a drastic variation we suggest checking the stability of the system as well as the origin of such variation before redoing all the experiments.",
    "Data analysis In this step, the videos obtained previously are analyzed to determine the variation between the probe’s position during each tether extraction procedure and the corresponding position of zero force reference. This variation in position Δx can be plotted versus the acquisition time, and, using the parameters defined during calibration, to generate a plot of the force applied to the probe versus the elapsed time. A bead trapped in the OT acts as an object attached to a spring. A radial deviation from the bead’s rest position results in a force F in the opposite direction, that can be modeled through Hooke’s Law as: F = k Δx, where k was defined in the calibration section and is related to the laser power, the index of refraction of the medium, and other known parameters. Thus, this model allows determination of the force F applied to the trapped bead using its position variation relative to a reference position.\nEstablishing the probe’s position using an image analysis software The image processing exemplified here uses the ImageJ software. However, the principles described should be reproducible using other programs that employ equivalent tools. The same process is used for both the reference position and tether extraction videos.\nOpen file In the “File” tab, select “Open” and find the video to be analyzed. For the video processing step, it is recommended to analyze each video individually (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig13.jpg\nFigure 13. Representative screenshot of a typical movie opened in ImageJ\nScale bar, 5 μm.",
    "Threshold With the video window selected, click in the “Image” tab, select “Adjust” and then “Threshold.” In the new window, keep the options “Default” and “B&W.” Adjust the parameters to ensure that the centralized bead is in optimal contrast when compared to the background (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]). The lower slider should be dragged to 255. The upper slider should be adjusted until the bead resembles the example shown.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig14.jpg\nFigure 14. Representative screenshot of a typical movie after the threshold processing\nNote the threshold parameters (left window) and how the movie looks after processed by the threshold function (right window).",
    "Analyzing particle position Using the rectangular selection tool, outline a region around the trapped bead. Each wall of the rectangle should be at about one diameter far from the bead. This ensures that the analysis is made within the selected area, thus saving processing time. In the tab “Analyze,” choose “Analyze particles.” In the “Size” section, determine a minimum size in the range of 50–100 pixels. That keeps the software from calculating the position of smaller and without interest particles. In the “Show” section, select “Outlines.” This option produces outline images of what the software identified as a particle and serves as quality control of this step. Also, select the options “Exclude on edges” and “Display results” (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]). The first removes the frames in which the particle touched or crossed the selection boundaries. The second displays a table of results with the XY position, for each frame of the particle i.e., the probe. With all the proper options selected, process all frames. Examine the produced images of the outlines, assessing if the software computed particle positions other than the ones of the probe. Save the resulting table accordingly. If there are more position points than frames, the software recognized multiple particles at some frame. Repeat the procedure, adjusting the threshold and size filtering. If needed, it is possible to manually remove the positions of other non-desired particles from the table. Repeat this procedure until all videos are processed and all corresponding tables are obtained (Figure 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig16]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig15.jpg\nFigure 15. Representative screenshot of typical parameters to perform the center of mass analysis\nNote the yellow selection around the bead and the parameters to allow particle analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig16.jpg\nFigure 16. Representative screenshot of a typical bead center of mass position (XM, YM) for each frame of the tether extraction movie",
    "Optional: Using ImageJ, it is possible to create a macro that automatically computes a series of predetermined actions. This can be performed intuitively by clicking in the “Plugins” tab, and selecting the option “Record,” under “Macros.” In this mode, the software records every input and creates a correspondent script that will repeat the same processes when loaded again, so that the series of steps previously described can be performed in a faster way. It is important to check the quality of the process in the same ways described before.\nDetermining the tether force using the data analysis software For this step, data analysis software is required. In our system we use the KaleidaGraph software (Version 4.5.3; Synergy Software); however, other software packages with similar capabilities can also be selected accordingly.\nDetermining the reference position in terms of an XY coordinate If using KaleidaGraph, open the XY coordinates corresponding to the reference position video for the sample to be analyzed. When opening a text file, a window appears and allows for the selection of the correct input format. For tables generated using ImageJ, select “Tab” under “Delimiter;” choose “=1” for “Number;” and select “Read Titles.” Then, select “OK” (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]). The opened table should present three columns: video frame number, X positions and Y positions (Figure 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig18]). The values required are the mean values of position for both the X and Y axis. Select the X column by clicking in its title, click in “Summary Statistics” and retrieve the mean position from the generated list. Repeat the same for the Y column. Alternatively, run the command “mean(c#)” in the Formula Entry window, to determine the mean value of a column of # number. Either way, both mean values should be obtained (Figure 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig18]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig17.jpg",
    "Figure 17. Representative screenshot showing the necessary inputs to correctly open the table in KaleidaGraph software\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig18.jpg\nFigure 18. Representative screenshot of how to obtain the mean XM and YM reference values\nNote: The table generated by ImageJ (Figure 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig16]) is a text file, presenting three columns. The first column (left to right) refers to the frame number and has no title. The second column, titled YM, presents the vertical positions for the center of mass of the probe, and the last one (XM) has the horizontal positions. If using another software, one should take the input table (from the reference video) and define the reference position. For that, one should retrieve the statistical mean for the numerical values in both YM and XM data columns. Be aware that in ImageJ these columns have tab-separated values, and the decimal separator is a period.",
    "Input for equations If using another software, go directly to the note of this section. If using KaleidaGraph, open the “Formula Entry” window. It is possible to store equations that can be later applied to the data table. To obtain the tether force, , a sequence of mathematical transformations is required. The frame number column should be converted into an elapsed time column, using the known frame rate. For example, the formula “c3=c0/10” creates a column in the c3 position where each frame (c0 column) is converted to a value in s, since the frame rate used in our example was 10 fps (Figure 19[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig19]). The next equation is c4 = ((c1-XMref)ˆ2+(c2-YMref)ˆ2)ˆ0.5/12.46. “XMref” and “YMref” are the average XM and YM values of the reference probe. “c1” and “c2” represent the columns with the position values on the X and Y axis, respectively, for the tether extraction procedure. This equation uses the Pythagoras theorem to establish the bead position deviation between the reference position and the measurement in question. It then creates a column with the variation value, for each frame, in the “c4” position. The number 12.46 is a conversion factor of pixels to micrometers, in our camera setup resolution. This value should be previously determined (Figure 20[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig20]). The third equation is an adaptation from the Hooke’s Law: c5 = c4 × 0.25 × 1,050. In this equation, 1,050 is the value, in mW, of the laser power and 0.25 is the optical tweezers spring constant k per unit of power. Both values are acquired through calibration (see calibration section for more details). Thus, “c4” represents the position variation, c5 represents the force applied to the bead and 0.25 × 1,050 is the final result for the OT spring constant k (Figure 21[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig21]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig19.jpg",
    "Figure 19. Representative image of how to obtain the time column c3\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig20.jpg\nFigure 20. Representative screenshot of how to obtain the Δx value column c4\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig21.jpg\nFigure 21. Representative screenshot of how to obtain the force value column c5\nNote: If using another software, make sure that the steps below are applied to all the data tables, previously generated in ImageJ from the tether extraction experiments.\nCreate a new column (4th column) in each table and make sure that it represents the conversion of number of frames (represented in the 1st column) into time (seconds). Create a new column (5th column) in each table and make sure that it represents the variation in the equilibrium position of the bead in relation to the reference position (Δx). For such, the following mathematical procedure should be implemented, based on the software used: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si65.jpg where XM and YM are the values listed in the table, XMref and YMref are the mean values previously obtained for the reference position and ψ represents the pixel/micrometer ratio. Create another column (6th column) in each table and make sure that it represents the force, F, in pN. For such, the following mathematical procedure should be implemented, based on the software used: F = βΔxP , where β represents the OT spring constant k per unit of power previously calibrated, P is the laser power measured for the particular set of experiments, and Δx determined in step 3.\nRun the sequence of calculations If using KaleidaGraph, open the position data tables of the experimental measures. Run the sequence of equations described above, following the same order described. Therefore, there should be three new columns of data, two of them are important: “c3” for the time and “c5” for the force (Figure 22[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig22]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig22.jpg",
    "Figure 22. Representative screenshot of a typical KaleidaGraph table of results\nNote: If using another software, run the sequence of equations, following the same order described. Thus, there should be three new columns of data, two of them are important: 4th column for the time (seconds) and 6th column for the force (pN).\nPlot the time progression of the observed force If using KaleidaGraph, in the “Gallery” tab, select a plot profile of preference. For our example, the style selected was “Line,” located under “Linear.” In the pop-up window, select the X axis with the time column (c3) and the Y axis as the force column (c5). Create a plot (Figure 23[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig23]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig23.jpg\nFigure 23. Representative screenshot of how to obtain a typical force (pN) versus time (s) plot\nNote: If using another software, adapt it to create a plot of the force (6th column) as a function of time (4th column) for each data table.\nNote: This is an important step for quality control. A typical tether force curve is shown in Figure 24[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig24]. When pulling the probe away from the membrane, a force peak is observed. Then, the value decreases and reaches a plateau that represents the tether force, . If no plateau is recognized, eliminate the data.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig24.jpg\nFigure 24. Representative image of a typical force (pN) versus time (s) plot\nSelect the plateau region The plateau represents the tether force, . If using KaleidaGraph, choose the free selection tool (Figure 25[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig25]), select the plateau region. Pay attention to the corresponding data table. The force column should be highlighted and values out of the selected regions should be masked.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig25.jpg\nFigure 25. Representative image indicating how to use the selection tool for the plateau region of the tether force curve",
    "Retrieve the average value for the plateau force In KaleidaGraph, select “Summary Statistics” and retrieve the average value for the plateau. Repeat the process, restarting at iii, for the other measured tables. Each force value should be recorded in a new table and then the mean tether force value for that specific experimental condition can be obtained.\nNote: If using another software, make sure to somehow select the plateau region in order to retrieve an average value for such plateau. We suggest to record each average force value obtained in a new table. Finally, the mean tether force value for that specific experimental condition can be obtained. Make sure to adapt these procedures in your preferred software, as well.\nSample preparation for scanning electron microscopy\nTiming: 4 h and 30 min\nThe following steps describe how to prepare the samples for SEM, preserving the membrane tethers for radius measurements.\nFixing the sample (40 min) Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]\nPrepare the fixing solution: in a fume hood prepare a final solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). The volume of the final solution should consider the number of samples to be fixed. Use an estimated volume of 2 mL of fixing solution per dish.\nImmediately after tether extraction with OT, attach the bead used to extract the tether to the sample coverslip by pressing it against the coverslip for 5–10 s (Figure 26[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig26]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig26.jpg\nFigure 26. Schematic representation showing the steps to allow bead attachment to the coverslip\n(A) Pressing the OT-trapped bead against the coverslip to allow attachment; (B) representation of the bead attached and the tether stabilized. Note that the bead is pressed against the coverslip to allow its attachment. The extracted tether remains stable and the sample can be fixed for SEM.",
    "Repeat the procedure and extract several other tethers from the same cell and other surrounding cells.\nCritical: The cells of interest must be within the square previously drawn on the coverslip during the glass-bottom dish preparation process.\nNote: If possible, try to choose cells that are attached near the border of the square, preferably near one of the vertices, as it becomes easier to find them during SEM imaging.\nNote: The glutaraldehyde and cacodylate buffer stock solutions must be stored at 4°C.\nThen, with the sample still in the microscope, open the glass-bottom dish, remove almost all the culture medium, using an automatic micropipette and by collecting the medium from the side of the dish (very carefully to avoid disturbances on the sample).\nCritical: Try to remove as much of the culture medium as possible, leaving only the medium inside the circular region delimited by the coverslip and the hole cut on the dish.\nAdd 2 mL of the fixing solution. Again, gently and from the side of the dish. After 15 min you can carefully remove the sample from the microscope and let the dish fix for the remaining time.\nRepeat the procedure for any other dishes.\nPost-fixing the sample (40 min)\nPrepare the post-fixing solution containing 0.2 M sucrose and 2 mM MgCl2 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4).\nGently remove the fixing solution, from the side of the dish, and add 2 mL of the post-fixing solution.\nPause Point: At this stage, it is possible to pause and restart the next day. However, the sample must be stored at 4°C.\nNote: To prevent the samples from drying out, store them in a plastic (or metal) wet chamber.\nNote: The post-fixing stock solution must be stored at 4°C.",
    "Wait for at least 40 min (or 12–15 h if the pause point was chosen) and then change the post-fixing solution.\nNote: The changes of sample solution must be performed very slowly and from the sides of the dishes to preserve the tethers.\nSample dehydration (1–2 h)\nPrepare five solutions with different dilutions of ethanol: 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% (anhydrous).\nReplace the post-fixing solution with the first ethanol dilution (30%) and incubate for 10 min at 20°C–25°C. Then, rinse with the same solution and leave for another 5 min. Repeat the steps, increasing the concentrations of ethanol until 100% is achieved.\nNote: Again, all the changes must be performed very gently and from the sides of the dishes to preserve the tethers.\nNote: Most of the coverslips will be detached from the culture dish by this point; however, if it does not happen, use a pair of tweezers (or similar object) to remove the paraffin sealing the coverslip and the dish.\nNote: The ethanol solutions can be stored at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical-point drying (1 h and 30 min)\nAdd the coverslips to a critical-point dryer following the manufacturer’s procedures. Wait until the entire process is complete (1 h and 30 min).\nCritical: Make sure to remember the correct side of the coverslip where cells were attached.\nSpecimen stub mounting (5 min)\nRemove the dried coverslips from the critical-point dryer and attach them to specimen stubs by using an electrically conductive carbon adhesive tape.\nCritical: Pay attention to the correct side of the coverslip.\nCoating with metallic sputtering (45 min)\nTake the specimen stubs to the sputter-coater and follow the manufacturer’s procedures.\nThe samples are then ready for visualization in the scanning electron microscope.\nObservation in a scanning electron microscope\nTiming: 2 h",
    "To perform the following tasks, you need the assistance of someone trained on how to use a scanning electron microscope. Since each electron microscope has its particularities, the steps that follow are focused only on describing how to find and recognize the tether images for radius measurements.\nFinding and imaging the cells\nAfter placing the sample into the microscope and adjusting the parameters, try to find, with the lower magnification mode, the square on the coverslip and the region where the chosen cell is located.\nAfter finding the cells of interest, increase the magnification and prepare to take individual images of the tethers (Figure 27[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig27]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig27.jpg\nFigure 27.

Then, align the image so that the tether becomes vertically arranged. To do this, follow the steps: in the ImageJ software, click on the “Image” tab, “Transform,” “Rotate” and select the specific angle for image rotation until the tether is vertically arranged (Figure 28[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig28]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig28.jpg\nFigure 28. Procedures to obtain the plot profile of a membrane tether SEM image\nScale bar, 1 μm.\nThen, use the rectangle selection tool in ImageJ to draw a rectangular-like shape around the tether (Figure 28[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig28]).\nOpen the “Analyze” tab and select the option “Plot Profile.” A new ImageJ window will open with a plot. Click on the bottom “List” and then save the opened table (Figure 28[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig28]).\nRepeat the above procedures for all other tether SEM images.\nAnalyzing plots in the KaleidaGraph software (1 h)",
    "Export the saved tables by individually opening them on the KaleidaGraph software. Then, create a new scatter plot of the listed results (Figure 29[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig29]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Fig29.jpg\nFigure 29. Procedures to determine the tether radius from a membrane tether SEM image\nNote that the image was analyzed using ImageJ. The KaleidaGraph software is then used to obtain the parameters m3 and m5 from the curve fit. These two parameters are the ones important to determine the tether diameter or radius.\nWith the plot window selected, go to the “Curve Fit” tab, “General function” and define a new adjustment, as indicated in the “General curve fit definition” and containing the parameters listed in Figure 29[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig29].\nRun the curve fit with the adjustment and check whether it appears in the scatter plot (Figure 29[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig29]).\nThe most important values are “m3” and “m5,” highlighted by red arrows in Figure 29[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig29]. Retrieve these two values in a new table. The tether diameter, or the tether radius, depends on these two values. The tether diameter corresponds to the difference between these two values (m5 – m3) while tether radius is half that difference. Remember to check whether these values are in pixels. If so, do not forget to convert them to micrometers or nanometers based on the pixel/micrometer ratio of each image.\nRepeat the above-described procedures for all other tether plot profiles. Then, the mean tether radius value for that specific experimental condition can be found.",
