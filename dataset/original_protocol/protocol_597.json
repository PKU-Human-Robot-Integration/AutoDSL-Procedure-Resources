    "An overview of the SBCapSeq experimental workflow is shown in \"Figure 1\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4239/original/Figure_1.jpg?1454608223.\nDetailed protocol steps follow:\n**A. Genomic DNA extraction \\(Timing overnight, 2 hours hands-on)**\n1. Choose one source of genomic DNA below.\n     a. Isolate genomic DNA from flash frozen specimens — Perform DNA extraction from frozen tissue according to the Gentra Puregene Handbook protocol for DNA purification from tissue frozen in liquid nitrogen. Using a razor blade or scalpel, shave off fine sections of frozen tissue equaling 10 mg, working on ice at all times, and add directly to Cell Lysis Solution. Follow the protocol exactly, including a 55 °C overnight incubation step in Proteinase K for maximum yields. In the final steps of isolation, re-suspend DNA pellet in 100 μL of DNA Hydration Solution. Quantify once DNA is completely dissolved —this step can be enhanced by overnight incubation at room temperature or 4 °C.\n   b. Isolate genomic DNA from whole genome amplified single cells — Single cells can be isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting followed by whole genome amplification according to methods outlined in Leung _et al_.<sup>4</sup> and Wang, Y. _et al_.<sup>5</sup>. Genomic DNA obtained from these methods provides high-quality DNA in amounts amendable to the library preparation and sequencing methods described below.\n<h5>2. Quantify genomic DNA extraction by either NanoDrop™ Lite Spectrophotometer or Qubit<sup>®</sup> 3.0 Fluorometer \\(using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit per manufacturer’s recommended instructions) to ensure sufficient yield to proceed with barcode library preparation.

A 500-flow sequencing run will complete in approximately 4 hours.\n  \n4. After a sequencing run is complete, Torrent Suite™ Software will align reads to a Reference Genome and generate a chip run report. Typically this analysis runs overnight.",
    "5. It is important to note that the portion of the PI™ chip run report pertaining to the metrics for sequence data after aligning sequenced reads to a reference genome \\(for mouse the default is mm10) is expected to look similar to \"Figure 3\":http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4243/original/Figure_3.jpg?1454608227. Specifically, the range of expected Reference Coverage is between 1.1X to 2.9X and Unaligned bases is between 40% to 70% when successful sequencing of SBCapSeq libraries is achieved \\(see Figure 3). The variation in values differs depending upon the number of pooled libraries per chip and the complexity \\(e.g. transposon copy number, etc.) of SB insertions in a given tumor, or pooled set of tumors. This occurs because of SB Capture Hybridization enrichment of non-Reference Genome reads belonging to the SB transposon are not able to map well to the Reference genome.\n  \n6. Once the sequencing run and genome alignment is complete,  download and archive the Ion Torrent Suite generated sequencing data files.\n  \n**K. SBCapSeq data analysis \\(~1 day)**\nNote that elements below contained in square brackets \\(<code>\\[text]</code>) are variables that the user must set; before running the code replace <code>\\[text]</code> with your non-bracketed text. Refer to the README.md file at \"https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq\":https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq for detailed instructions and a demonstration of this workflow on a toy data set.\n1. Prepare computer workstation for data analysis by downloading the required installer and python scripts from \"https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq\":https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq. If you download the master archive \\( \"https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq/archive/master.zip\":https://github.com/jynewberg/sbcapseq/archive/master.zip ), make sure to unzip the contents. Once you do this, you should see an installer script \\(<code>'install.sh'</code>), a python directory, and some documentation and license files.\n  \n2. Install the toolbox and reference indexes by executing the installer script \\(<code>'install.sh'</code>). Using Terminal.app \\(or similar terminal emulator), navigate to the directory containing the installer, then run the following command:\n   \n    <code>bash install.sh</code>",
    "3. Add the sbcapseq toolbox scripts to your system paths by running the following command:\n     \n<code>export PATH=$HOME/nnlab/sbcapseq/bin:$PATH</code>\n4. Convert the Ion Torrent Suite sequencing data to FASTQ format, if it is not already in this format. This can be done using samtools<sup>6</sup> and the <code>sam2fastq.py</code> script:\n  \na. Converting from SAM format to FASTQ format: \n    <code>samtools view -S \\[reads.sam] | sam2fastq.py - > \\[reads.fastq]</code>\nb. Converting from BAM format to FASTQ format: \n    <code>samtools view \\[reads.sam] | sam2fastq.py - > \\[reads.fastq]</code>\n5. Map the FASTQ reads to mouse TA sites using the <code>fastq2tas.py</code> script:\n  \n    <code>fastq2tas.py $HOME/nnlab/sbcapseq/srv \\[reads.fastq]</code>\nThis will generate a folder containing a file detailing the TA sites \\(<code>insertions.txt</code>) and a log file giving a breakdown of reads that made mapped to TA sites \\(<code>log.json</code>).\n6. Convert the TA sites to <code>BED</code> format, and mask potential hotspots, using the following command:\n  \n    <code>tas2bed.py -f \\[insertions.txt] | maskbed.py $HOME/nnlab/sbcapseq/srv/protonMaskSites.bed - > \\[insertions.bed]</code>\n7. The <code>BED</code> file format is suitable for several types of analysis \\(e.g. common insertion site statistical analysis) and may be used to visualize SB insertions in a genomics browser \\(e.g. UCSC Genome Browser, Integrative Genomics Viewer, or Integrated Genome Browser)."
