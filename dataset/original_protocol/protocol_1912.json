    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTree-based MP analysis\nTiming: 1Â day to a few days\nNote: Timing depends on the size and complexity of the data set matrix, and also of PAUP software execution times of 16 MP and 16 bootstrap runs.\nFor the MP analysis with the complete initial Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc1.zip], take into consideration three kinds of constraints in the execution of the runs: the type of characters, the presence of polymorphic characters in multistate taxa, and with regard to the weighing of characters use two options, i.e., initially apply same weights and reweigh characters after the initial runs.\nCritical: It is essential to discard preconceived subjective biases with regard to these constraints, and conduct the MP analysis with all possible numerical options available in order to objectively select the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario, without postulating a priori how morphological character changes evolve, what type of multistate taxa setting to use, and whether characters should be reweighed or not.\nOnce a most parsimonious evolutionary scenario is selected, the supporting derived characters (apomorphies and eventually informative homoplasies) at the nodes of the cladogram (LCAs) ought to be visualized such as for example in Figures S9 and S10 of Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] showing graphically the apomorphies listed in Tables S2 and S3 of that paper. The visualization will facilitate the discussion of the anatomic modifications of an adaptive nature or the result of epigenetic processes that come in support of the evolutionary changes.\nFinally, the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario must be validated by comparing a bootstrap simulation based on the same MP parsimony settings with an alternative statistical method such as for example BMCMC.",
    "Critical: Doubts have been expressed as to whether phylogeny reconstruction ought to be considered as a statistical question, with the suggestion that phylogenetic inference is best viewed in non-statistical terms (Farris, 1983[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). In studies of phylogenetic reconstruction both the non-statistical method such as MP and the statistical ones, such as BMCMC and bootstrap analyses, must be used and compared for a better interpretation of the data. However, in light of contrary views concerning the adequacy of MP or statistical methods to make phylogenetic inferences (Wright and Hillis, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib50]; Kolaczkowski and Thornton, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]), as far as statistical methods are concerned caution must be exercised with regard to the question of statistical consistency, the complexity and empirical basis of the evolutionary models used, and what epistemological considerations support the use of these specific models of evolution.\nExecute 16 MP runs and 16 corresponding bootstrap runs With Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc1.zip] and the PAUP software execute 16 MP runs corresponding to 16 different evolutionary tree scenarios with two settings for weights (equal weight and Rescaled Consistency Index RC reweight), four character types (Fitch, Wagner, Camin-Sokal or Dollo), and two settings for multistate taxa (uncertainty or polymorphism). The runs can be executed with a search algorithm in two phases: one phase with equal weights and one with characters reweighed. We show below the relevant dropdown menus used to execute the 2 phases.\nNote: With regard to the computational MP tree search methods, there exists three algorithms available in PAUP:\nExhaustive Search: exact algorithm that evaluates every possible tree and can be used for a maximum of 12 terminal taxa.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig2.jpg\nBranch-and-Bound Search: also an exact search option that can be used for more than 12 taxa; however, this algorithm works computationally for data sets of a limited size.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig3.jpg",
    "Heuristic search: when the processing with the branch-and-bound algorithm is not feasible with a large data set, the only alternative to process the data is by heuristic search that operates by hill-climbing methods, and is computationally effective. In Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] all the runs were conducted by heuristic search with simple stepwise addition and TBR branch swapping.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig4.jpg\nFor further explanations of the search parameters consult the PAUP manual (http://phylosolutions.com/paup-documentation/paupmanual.pdf[href=http://phylosolutions.com/paup-documentation/paupmanual.pdf]).\nMP runs corresponding to 8 scenarios with initial equal character weights In a first phase, execute 8 equal weight runs with the appropriate search method and the following parameters:\nEqual character weights.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig5.jpg\nFour character-types.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig6.jpg\nRuns are executed with the four character types optimality criteria (Fitch-unordered, Wagner-ordered, Camin-Sokal-irreversible or Dollo-reversible). For Dollo and Irrev types two modes are available: Up (normal) and Down (reversed); these modes are related to the polarity of the coded observed states, with Up starting with the lowest observed ancestral state and Down the highest. We used Up polarity in Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].",
    "Note: There are four main character type options to choose from PAUP to conduct MP analysis runs . The four parsimony optimality criteria represent four models of evolutionary paths applied to character changes, subject to constraints as to the polarity or reversibility of the characters. If one does not want any constraint, one then uses unordered Fitch setting (Fitch, 1971[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]) which permits any state of a character to transform directly to any other state. If one wants to impose a constraint as to the direction (polarity) of the state changes, one uses Wagner ordered setting (Farris, 1970[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Swofford and Maddison, 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib48]) which is bidirectional, i.e., in a three states 0,1,2 character there is no requirement that 0 be the ancestral state, only the resulting tree will determine which state is ancestral after orienting the tree (graph) with an outgroup. Wagner parsimony makes convergence and reversion possible, as in Fitch parsimony. If one considers that evolution is irreversible as suggested by Simpson (1953)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib40], then one chooses the Camin-Sokal criterion (Camin and Sokal, 1965[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) which is equivalent to ordered characters with the additional constraint of irreversibility, or unidirectionality from a plesiomorphic state or less derived state to a more derived state. Finally, if one assumes that a derived character can change only once from the plesiomorphic state to the derived state, and can revert more than once to the plesiomorphic state, then the Dollo criterion (Farris, 1977[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]), which only allows homoplasy under the form of reversal, is required. For a more comprehensive description of these four main choices we refer to Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] - Supplemental Information/Transparent Methods 1. Maximum Parsimony (MP) optimality criteria), and show below their graphical representation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig7.jpg",
    "Critical: In most MP published studies in Paleoanthropology, authors commonly use the unordered character type (Fitch parsimony) or ordered type (Wagner parsimony), or a combination of both (Collard and Wood, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Strait and Grine, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib46]), whereas the ones favoring convergent homoplasies (Camin-Sokal parsimony) or reversals (Dollo parsimony) are never selected. The use of Fitch and/or Wagner character types would indicate that authors make a priori assumptions about the process of evolution with regard to character-state changes. Thus, to avoid any bias with regard to which model of evolutionary path a character type should follow, we strongly recommend that the four character types be used in the analysis runs.\nUncertainty or polymorphism setting for multistate taxa For each of the 4 character types execute runs with uncertainty and polymorphism settings for multistate taxa.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig8.jpg\nCritical: Many authors tend to discard polymorphic characters in multistate taxa. Ignoring polymorphism results in a loss of information (Wiens, 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib49]); this is the reason why we recommend that polymorphic characters in multistate taxa be coded and kept in the data set. For further discussion of the multistate taxa choices (uncertainty or polymorphism), we refer to Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] - Supplemental Information/Transparent Methods 2. Treatment of multistate taxa).\nNote: Caution is required in interpreting the results with regard to uncertainty or polymorphism setting for multistate taxa. After running the parsimony algorithm, PAUP assigns one of the states of a multistate character to the terminal taxon, i.e., the algorithm treats the multistate character as an ambiguity, and by optimization assigns one of the features to the terminal in the output. Conceptually one may construe the selected chosen state in the output terminal as if the polymorphism had resulted in the monomorphic dominant fixation of the trait in the concerned species.",
    "Thus, using the distinct character types (4) and multistate settings (2), 8 runs will be executed in total with equal character weights.\nMP runs corresponding to 8 scenarios with reweighed characters In a second phase, execute 8 runs with characters reweighed by the respective Rescaled Consistency indices (RC) obtained from the previous corresponding equal weight runs, with the same character types and multistate settings. The relevant parameters are as follows:\nRC reweighed characters.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig9.jpg",
    "Critical: Weighing of characters in cladistics is a controversial issue, one argument being that reweighing characters after an initial run leads to unparsimonious hypotheses (Kluge, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]). However, Farris (1983)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] considered that characters with more homoplasy are less reliable and suggested that parsimony is not equivalent to equal weights; he argued on the basis that some characters represent stronger evidence than others, that consequently they should be weighed. Reweighing of morphological data sets produces substantial increases in jackknife frequencies, and results compared to equal weighing become more stable with lower error rates (Goloboff etÂ al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). This supports the affirmation that âit is not that parsimony does not preclude weighing, but rather that it requires weighing\" (Goloboff, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). Successive weighing is successful when cladistically reliable characters such as apomorphies are outnumbered by homoplasies (Farris, 1969[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]), which is generally the case in most studies. Thus, should the characters originally with equal weight be reweighed after a first run? The answer is definitely yes as is evident in Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Table 1) showing that reweighing produces higher tree Retention Indices RIs. Higher tree RIs imply a more coherent degree of overall synapomorphy and a more consistent phylogenetic information signal. The use of the character rescaled consistency index rcÂ = retention index (ri) x consistency index (ci) from the first phase runs is recommended as a weighing criterion (Farris, 1989a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) of the respective characters.\nFour character-types (Fitch-unordered, Wagner-ordered, Camin-Sokal-irreversible or Dollo-reversible) are used as in step 1, a, ii.\nUncertainty or polymorphism settings for multistate taxa are used as in step 1, a, iii. Thus, using the distinct character types (4) and multistate settings (2), 8 runs will be executed in total with character RC reweighing.",
    "Execute 16 bootstrap runs To assess the branch support of the 16 MP tree scenarios individually, execute bootstrap runs concurrently to the MP runs with the same parsimony settings used in each MP run.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig10.jpg\nCritical: Bootstrapping, a random resampling method developed by Efron (1979)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] to evaluate the accuracy of statistical estimates, was proposed by Felsenstein (1985)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] to assess the confidence intervals in phylogenetic analyses. There seems to exist some confusion with regard to the use of bootstrap simulation in MP analysis. In some phylogenetic studies, the MP bootstrap consensus tree is used as a final result and considered as an end in itself, without relating it to or showing the relevant MP tree it is supposed to evaluate. For comparative purposes, it is imperative to show graphically the 50% majority rule bootstrap consensus tree with its relevant bootstrap branch replicate values along with the corresponding tree figure (single or consensus) of the MP scenario, as for example in Figures S3âS6 of Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nNote: Bootstrap values in general are negatively affected by the number of characters, the number of non-informative characters, the number of missing characters in some taxa, and by the sample size and the nature of the search algorithms (Soltis and Soltis, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib44]). One should not exclude the possibility that a tree topography with very low support values of an extensive and complex data set might still be phylogenetically closer to the \"true\" tree than a tree topology with higher support values from a limited and related data set. It is thus paradoxical that the more extensive a data set is, the lower the support values may be.",
    "Note: Since the bootstrap analysis is a random resampling method, it is not certain that the resulting bootstrapping consensus tree will be exactly identical to the MP tree (single or consensus) obtained with the same settings, and various bootstrapping runs might generate slightly different results. Refer to troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1] for a potential solution.\nOutput After an MP run PAUP provides two types of output:\nTree(s)-cladogram(s). The run may generate one most parsimonious tree or multiple trees that are also most parsimonious. A run producing more than one most parsimonious tree can be expressed for analytical purposes under the form of a consensus tree (see troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]). We recommend to use the 50% majority rule consensus tree of the resulting minimal trees, the most robust commonly used method that allows one to retain all groups found in over half of the rival trees.",
    "Analytical descriptive parameters. In addition to the most parsimonious tree(s) and eventual consensus tree resulting from the analysis, extensive descriptive output data are available for each run from the Describe Trees menu. The following information is available to conduct an in-depth analysis of the results: main result parameters (along with the cladogram, number of most parsimonious trees, number of steps, tree Retention Index and Consistency Index; these may be summarized in a table for all the 16 runs as for example in (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Table 1), branch lengths and linkages of terminalÂ taxa and nodes (LCAs) to other nodes, possible character-state assignments to internal nodes, data matrix and reconstructed states for internal nodes on the basis of the optimization algorithm selected to resolve ambiguities (ACCTRAN or DELTRAN), character change lists showing at which nodes/terminal taxa each character changes, apomorphy lists showing for every branch which characters change and how, and character diagnostics list providing for each character the Minimum, Actual and Maximum number of steps (changes) allowing the computation of character consistency indices (ci), retention indices (ri) and rescaled consistency indices (rc). From this last list you will select the apomorphies with character retention index riÂ = 1 that will compose Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc2.zip] for the intermediate MP analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig11.jpg\nSelection of the most parsimonious tree scenario",
    "Why do apomorphies matter? An apomorphy is the sharing of an anatomical novelty by two species as a sign of close relatedness (Hennig, 1966[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). By contrast, a novelty not shared by an immediate common ancestor is designated as an homoplasy such as convergence or reversal (Simpson, 1961[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib41]). For further information on the concepts of apomorphy and homoplasy refer to Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] - Transparent Methods. Foundations of the phylogenetic concept of Maximum Parsimony). As a general rule if a character shows n states, an apomorphous character will result in n-1 one-time character state changes in the cladogram, and for a homoplastic character there will be at least n character-states changes. The most parsimonious tree(s) that you are searching is(are) the one(s) that reveals the maximum number of apomorphies or equivalently minimizes the number of homoplasies inherent to the tree.\nHow to identify apomorphies? The discovery of apomorphies (synapomorphies shared downstream in a tree or autapomorphies specific to a branch) represents an important aim of the MP analysis because before conducting the analysis the researcher does not know which character-state changes are apomorphous. An apomorphy is not a declaration ex ante of a character-state derived change; an apomorphy emerges from the results of the run, and the easiest and most elegant way to identify apomorphies after a PAUP run is to select characters with a retention index riÂ = 1 from the \"character diagnostics\" list of the Describe Trees output menu, as shown for example in Table S1 of Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].",
    "The character retention index The character retention index ri is \"the fraction of apparent synapomorphy in the character that is retained as synapomorphy on the tree\" (Farris, 1989b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). We illustrate graphically in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] reproduced from Figure S8 (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) the ri character retention index's behavior related to the coherence of the MP tree; it expresses the degree of a posteriori homology apparent in the character, i.e., its information content. If riÂ = 1 the character change represents an apomorphy while values of 0Â < riÂ < 1 represent homoplasies. The lower this index the more homoplastic the character is; thus, the quantity 1- ri represents the degree of homoplasy inherent to this character in the MP tree.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Fig2.jpg\nFigureÂ 2. Character retention index ri formula and description of how it behaves as a function of changes in character state variables\nYellow color: three variables m, s and g provided in the character diagnostic output of the first PAUP run.\nPink color: homoplasy definitions based on variables m, s and g.\nGreen color: behavior standardized from 0 to 1 of character retention index ri and its complement d observed homoplasy index.\nBlue color: inference interpretations drawn from behavior from 0 to 1 of character retention index ri.\nReproduced from Figure S8 of Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nFrom the character retention index to the tree retention index A distinction should be made between a single character retention index ri and an overall tree retention index RI. The tree Retention Index RI is the sum over all the individual-character retention indices ri calculated as per the formula (â g â â s) / (â g â â m) with g, s and m as defined in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].",
    "Metric to select the most parsimonious scenario The tree RI is the best metric to select the most informative run because it measures accurately the overall degree of synapomorhy of the MP tree (Farris, 1989a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], 1989b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Caparros, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), i.e., the scenario with the highest tree RI is the most coherent and phylogenetically informative. The tree RI is a better indicator of the level of synapomorphy than the Consistency Index CI, and represents a robust proxy for confidence and accuracy estimate in the selection of the most informative and coherent MP scenario (Caparros, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Farris, 1989a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], 1989b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Mounier and Caparros, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]; Mounier etÂ al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]). In essence, a high value of the RI index is indicative of a high degree of overall synapomorphy inherent to the tree, and thus of its phylogenetic information content. In Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] - FigureÂ 1, Table 1) we called MPMAX the scenario with the highest RI.\nNote: Some workers may object to the use of the tree RI to select the most parsimonious scenario. In such eventuality, refer to troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].\nNote: The total number of steps of a PAUP run is not a reliable parameter to select the most parsimonious scenario due to the fact that the constraints (models of character type, equal weight or reweighing, and multistate taxa settings) affect the scale of the number of steps as evidenced in Table 1 of Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nVisualization of the most parsimonious scenario results and character support",
    "Elliptic graphic representation The results of an MP run are normally expressed as a tree (single or consensus) where the nodes of the branches represent the hypothetical LCAs. Hennig (Hennig, 1966[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26] Figure 18, p.71) was the first to present an elliptic phylogenetic graphic representation equivalent to a cladogram. For illustrative purposes we show in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] the similarities between an elliptic representation and the MP cladogram from Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] - Figures 1 and S7). The identifying node numbers of the LCAs of the cladogram are expressed asÂ numbered stem species elliptic boundaries. The difference between the cladogram and the elliptic representation is the way the phylogenetic relationship is expressed between the stem species and its successor sister groups. In the cladogram, it is represented by the nodes (hypothetical ancestors) linking the dichotomous branches to its successors (two other nodes, or a node and a terminal, or two terminals) whereas in the elliptic representation, the boundary lines of the stem species are drawn around their successor species. The elliptic boundaries illustrate more accurately than the tree-based representation the formation of higher taxa monophyletic groups in conformity with the hierarchic system of Phylogenetic Systematics, and facilitate the interpretation of the ancestor-descendant relationships among the various species under study.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Fig3.jpg\nFigureÂ 3. MPMAX cladogram and its elliptic representation\nMPMAX cladogram (A) and its elliptic representation (B) reproduced from Figures 1 and S7 of Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]. The nodes of the tree are indicated in black numbers with arrows. In the elliptic representation the LCA nodes are expressed as equivalent elliptic boundaries. Refer to the legend of Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Figure 1 for sister group definitions.",
    "Note: The elliptic representation applies only to a fully resolved tree, i.e., it cannot be used with a tree that has polytomies. No software exists for the elliptic representation which must be done manually, with the character state changes coming in support of the branches (as illustrated for example in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] reproduced from Figure S9 (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])) obtained from the PAUP run Describe Trees output.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Fig4.jpg\nFigureÂ 4. Character-state changes (apomorphies) in support of stem species elliptic boundaries 40 to 26 (tree nodes - LCAs) of MPMAX scenario\nMeaning of symbols are as follows: numbered stem boundaries correspond to nodes of equivalent tree, arrows from boxes to stem boundaries indicate supporting apomorphous character-state changes, ==> unambiguous characters and --> ACCTRAN resolved ambiguous characters. ACCTRAN optimization (Agnarsson and Miller, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) was used for the treatment of ambiguities. Reproduced from Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Figure S9.\nVisualization of apomorphies in support of LCAs Contrary to probability-based methods of phylogeny reconstruction, MP identifies clearly the character-state changes that support the various clades, e.g., in Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] - Tables S1 and S2) 74 apomorphies in support of the LCAs were identified from the MPMAX run output with character retention index riÂ = 1. We show in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] the one-time character-state changes (apomorphies) in support of stem species elliptic boundaries 40 to 26 (tree nodes - LCAs) of this scenario that encompasses the Homo genus species definitions.\nCritical: We strongly recommend that the apomorphies in support of the various clades be graphically visualized as a prior step to the discussion of the anatomical significance regarding the appearance of morphological novelties.",
    "Note: In Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] the character changes highlighted for nested elliptic boundaries (stem taxa) A, B, C, D, E, F, 34 and terminal Hsap (H.Â sapiens) are synapomorphies, i.e., morphological novelties passed on to succeeding nested monophyletic groups, whereas the novelties of the remaining lower sister groups J, I, H, G and stem boundaries 26, 31 and 33 are autapomorphies specific to these groups.\nProjection of individual characters on to the cladogram The PAUP software after conducting a run provides extensive detailed output data from the Describe Trees menu which are very useful in analyzing the anatomical features of individual character state changes and their relevant phylogenetic significance. However, PAUP does not provide an easy way to visualize synthetically this rich output material. In our opinion, the best software to visualize these results is MacClade which happens to be compatible with PAUP. Both the MacClade software (Maddison and Maddison, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]) and the PAUP software (Swofford, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib47]) use the NEXUS format, e.g., one can set up a character data matrix in MacClade and execute the MP run in PAUP with this matrix, or vice-versa visualize with MacClade the tree output of a PAUP run from a given outsourced data set.",
    "Critical: The freely available MacClade software works well only on old PowerPC Mac computers under a classic operating environment and on Intel Macs under operating systems up to MacOS 10.6. Unfortunately, it does not work under MacOS X 10.7 or later versions of the MacOS, and cannot run under Windows; thus, to benefit from this very helpful visualization tool one needs to use an old Mac computer with one of the operating systems just mentioned. We are not aware of any other phylogenetic software having the versatile features of MacClade for visualizing and rendering with high precision the results obtained from PAUP.\nSetting up a data matrix in MacClade This is done easily with the data editor, with the possibility of entering additionally the character state names along with the coded symbols if necessary.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig12.jpg\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig13.jpg",
    "Projection of individual characters on to the cladogram One attractive feature of MacClade is the possibility to project individual characters on to the cladogram from the resulting PAUP analysis run. To use this feature, read in MacClade Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc1.zip] and the relevant resolved tree saved from the PAUP run. This projection allows one to verify graphically for each character its status either as an apomorphy or homoplasy, and in the case of homoplasy to ascertain its status as convergence or reversal provided one insures that the projection is unconstrained by selecting an unordered mode. These projections are useful to explain the anatomical changes that took place along the evolutionary path of the tree. Below are four examples of character state projections (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) from the MPMAX output of Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] - FigureÂ S8) with (B) example of synapomorphy of mandibular fossa position character, (C) example of autapomorphy in Paranthropus clade of lingual shape of maxillary canine character, (D) example of convergence homoplasy of suprameatal spine character, and (E) example of reversal homoplasy of external auditory meatus size character.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Fig5.jpg\nFigureÂ 5.

    "Comparison of non-statistical MP and statistical BMCMC results with same data set An empirical objective for a better interpretation of the data in studies of human phylogenetic reconstruction requires that MP, a non-statistical numerical method based on mathematical graph theory (Darlu and Tassy, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), be compared with a statistical one such as for example BMCMC (Goloboff and Pol, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]; Cummings etÂ al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). However, the two methods are not directly comparable since the measure of coherence of MP such as the tree RI is unrelated to the posterior probabilities produced by the BMCMC analysis. An indirect way of comparing the two methods is to execute a bootstrap run with the same settings as the MP run, and compare the proportions of bootstrap replicates values Pboot of the bootstrap tree to the posterior probability values Ppost of the BMCMC tree resulting from the Bayesian analysis with the same data set.",
    "Are Pboot and Ppost comparable? The question is, are the values of Pboot and Ppost comparable? The proportion of bootstrap replicate value Pboot in which a clade is identified is subject to various interpretations in phylogenetic analysis (Soltis and Soltis, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib44]). Some view Pboot as a measure of repeatability, others as a measure of accuracy, i.e., closeness to the true tree, or a measure of statistical confidence. Most systematists view bootstrap values as a relative assessment of clade support rather than a strict statistical confidence statement of the nodes, or joint confidence for the entire tree. Simulations of maximum likelihood bootstrap and BMCMC analyses performed on the same sequence data set show that over various model spaces values Pboot and Ppost are not significantly different (Cummings etÂ al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). These findings are corroborated in a set of simulations showing that Ppost estimated by Mr Bayes software and Pboot calculated by PAUP software were almost exactly the same (Goloboff and Pol, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). Thus, the search method with the highest support values will indicate relatively a higher coherence level in the relationships expressed phylogenetically by the clades.\nExample of scenario validation further to the comparison Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] compared the bootstrap values Pboot of MPMAX to the Ppost probabilities of a BMCMC analysis from Dembo etÂ al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] executed with the same data set. Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] shows the results of the comparison by means of an elliptic phylogenetic representation. The MPMAX scenario had a systematically higher support in practically all of the sister groups with a higher resolution concordant with paleoanthropological paradigms, and the conclusion was that the bootstrap tree identical to the MPMAX tree with the same settings validated this most phylogenetically informative and coherent evolutionary scenario.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Fig6.jpg",

Prior to answering this question, you need to verify the phylogenetic signal related to the various sister groups by following the fundamental principle of Phylogenetic Systematics. This principle stipulates that the evolutionary history of taxa is reconstituted from characters by the sharing of apomorphies while homoplasies, resemblance not due to inheritance from a close common ancestor, represent features of an adaptive nature and are therefore phylogenetically less informative; in other words, \"The more characters certainly interpretable as apomorphous (not characters in general) are present in a number of different species, the better founded is the assumption that these species form a monophyletic group (Hennig, 1966[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26])\".\nCritical: In essence, only apomorphies ought to be relevant in finding monophyletic groups \" not characters in general\". To obtain the response to the question whether the most parsimonious scenario is indicative of reticulate evolution, it is advisable to re-run the MP analysis with apomorphous characters.\nRe-run the parsimony analysis with apomorphous characters as prior step to the PN analysis",
    "In keeping with the Hennigian principle that only apomorphies are relevant in finding monophyletic groups, re-run the MP analysis with apomorphies (and if necessary add informative homoplasies as per troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9] below) resulting from the most parsimonious scenario MPMAX. Select apomorphous characters with retention index riÂ = 1 to make up Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc2.zip] from the MPMAX character diagnostics output. With Data S2 execute an MP run with the same settings as the most parsimonious scenario from Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc1.zip] selected with the highest tree RI. In Caparros and Prat (Caparros and Prat, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Table S1) apomorphies of the MPMAX scenario (Dollo type algorithm, RC reweighing and uncertainty setting for multistate taxa) were selected with character retention index riÂ = 1, and generated a reduced Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc2.zip] of 74 apomorphous characters. There was no need to execute a second run with reweighed characters since the selected apomorphies of Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc2.zip] had an riÂ = 1 and ciÂ = 1, with a reweighing parameter rc (ri x ci)Â = 1 identical to the initial run equal weights. We reproduce below Table S1 of Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] showing character diagnostics from output of MPMAX run. The list shows for each informative character its consistency index ci, retention index ri and rescaled consistency index rcÂ = ci x ri. Apomorphies for the subsequent intermediate MP analysis were selected on the basis of their character riÂ = 1.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-InFig15.jpg\nExample - Intermediate MP analysis results from Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]",
    "The run with 74 apomorphous characters generated a set of 3213 MP trees called MMPT (multiple most parsimonious trees) which make up Data S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc3.zip], with perfect tree congruence indices RIÂ = 1 and CIÂ = 1 for all the trees. The 50% majority consensus tree of MMPT trees resulting from the analysis based on Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc2.zip] is reproduced in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]; it confirmed the existence of four highly resolved ancestral monophyletic sister groups identified in the MPMAX scenario (PreHs, Her, NalSed and Par in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] - elliptic representation) and showed four polytomies that regroup incompatible parts of the multiple trees.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Fig7.jpg\nFigureÂ 7. 50% majority consensus tree from MP run with apomorphousÂ Data S2Â that generated 3213 Dollo MP trees (MMPT) with RI=1 and CI=1 for all trees\nReproduced from Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Figure 3.\nNote: More polytomies become apparent when the number of homoplastic character decreases in the executed Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc2.zip], while the number of most parsimonious trees increases substantially, as observed in Caparros (1997)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]. Polytomies may be construed as background noise defined as NÂ = (1 - RIâ), RIâ being the tree retention index of the MPMAX scenario from analysis with the full Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc1.zip] and the value 1 representing the perfect tree retention index from the intermediate analysis with the apomorphous Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc2.zip]. Conceptually N represents the contribution of removing homoplastic characters to the diminution of the RI between the two types of analyses, and may be considered as a loss of phylogenetic information.\nAs shown below, polytomies thought to be generally uninformative resulted in being of utmost importance in the PN analysis, i.e., deciphering this apparent loss of information embedded in the polytomies allowed to conduct the PN analysis with Data S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc3.zip] composed of the MMPT multiple most parsimonious trees.\nPhylogenetic Networks analysis",
    "Timing: a few hours\nTransition from a tree to a network to explain human evolution\nPhylogenetic trees may not be the best tool to represent phylogenetic history in light of the complex biological processes such as hybridization that may generate evolutionary reticulation; networks are therefore the solution if one conceives that a network is a tree with reticulations. The question methodologically is how do we make the transition from a tree to a network to explain evolution. In a hybrid species, its genome comes partly from one parent and partly from the other, so the resulting hybrid genome will have different evolutionary histories; therefore, the analysis will endeavor to reconstruct and blend the different phylogenetic trees of the genomes. In the construction of a hybridization network the conflicting gene trees will be processed, and not the original genomic data. More generally, the question becomes how do we represent evolutionary relationships when the history of a set of taxa includes inheritance from multiple ancestors across hybridized taxa.\nEmpirical assumptions to link MP and PN analyses\nBased on the analogy of hybrid species sharing multiple ancestral evolutionary histories, in Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] we used a Phylogenetic Networks conceptual approach extensively employed in molecular biology to test the hypothesis of phenotypic hominin evolutionary reticulation. To establish a link between the MP and the PN analyses, we made two empirical assumptions: 1) apomorphous character-state changes represent analogous proxies of gene sequence changes evolving from common ancestors, and 2) the 3213 MP trees (MMPT) making up Data S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc3.zip] (resulting from the parsimony PAUP run with apomorphies of Data S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1507-Mmc2.zip]) are methodologically analogous to gene trees from a set of species, and are thus used as input in the PN analysis.",
    "Types of phylogenetic networks Huson and Bryant (2006)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27] distinguish three main types of phylogenetic networks:\nPhylogenetic trees used to summarize taxonomic relationships between biological entities.\nSplits networks used to represent incompatibilities in data sets reflected for example by polytomies in consensus trees.\nReticulate networks used to explain evolutionary histories with edges representing lineages of descent or reticulate events, and internal nodes representing hypothetical ancestors. In Caparros and Prat (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], to shed some further light on the taxonomic threshold betweenÂ the genus Homo and other hominin sister groups, we tested the hypothesis of phenotypic hominin evolutionary reticulation based on these three types of phylogenetic networks.\nNote: For a review of Phylogenetic Networks methods, we refer to the comprehensive syntheses of the field by Huson etÂ al.
