    "Thaw PBMC   Warm complete RPMI media to 37 °C in water bath. Each sample will require 22 ml of media with benzonase. Calculate the amount needed to thaw all samples, and prepare a separate aliquot of warm media with 1:10,000 benzonase (final concentration 25 U/ml). Benzonase is added into the media to prevent dead cell aggregation. Thaw no more than 3 samples at a time. Run one control PBMC with each batch of samples.   Remove samples from liquid nitrogen and transport to lab on dry ice.   Place 10 ml of warmed benzonase media into a 15 ml tube, making a separate tube for each sample.    Thaw frozen vials in 37 °C water bath.   When cells are nearly completely thawed, carry to hood.    Add 1 ml of warm benzonase media from appropriately labeled centrifuge tube slowly to the cells, then transfer the cells to the centrifuge tube. Rinse vial with more media from centrifuge tube to retrieve all cells.   Continue with the rest of the samples as quickly as possible.   Centrifuge cells at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473) for 8 min at room temperature.   Remove supernatant from the cells and resuspend the pellet by tapping the tube.   Gently resuspend the pellet in 1 ml warmed benzonase media. Filter cells through a 70 micron cell strainer if needed. Add 9 ml more warmed benzonase media to the tube.   Centrifuge cells at 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473) for 8 min at room temperature. Remove supernatant from the cells and resuspend the pellet by tapping the tube.   Resuspend cells in 1 ml warm media.   Count cells with Vicell (or hemocytometer if necessary). To count, take 20 μl cells and dilute with 480 μl PBS in Vicell counting chamber. Load onto Vicell as PBMC with a 1:25 dilution factor.",
    "Adjust the cell concentration to 5-10 x 106 cells/ml with warm media (no more benzonase at this point).    Using a multichannel pipette, add 200 µl cells (for at least 1 x 106 cells) into each well of a 96-well deep well plate. Split each sample equally into two or more wells keeping one as an unstimulated control and the others for different types of stimulation.   Rest overnight (6-18 h) at 37 °C in CO2 incubator.      Stimulate cells   After overnight rest at 37 °C, add the activation reagents and secretion inhibitor (brefeldin A/monensin) to the well for stimulation. Add only the secretion inhibitor to the unstimulated control well. If doing CD107a staining, add CD107a antibody during the stimulation.  Table 1. Protein secretion inhibitors table:",

    "Notes:    It is important to avoid solvent toxicity. Final DMSO+ethanol concentration from all sources (peptides, brefeldin A, monensin) should not exceed 0.5%.   For most cytokines: Use brefeldin A at 10 μg/ml final concentration (see stock preparation table). For CD107 and CD154: Use monensin at 10 μg/ml final concentration (see stock preparation table). For assays combining cytokines and CD107 or CD154: Use brefeldin A and monensin at 5 μg/ml final concentration each.    Metal-labeled CD107 and CD154 can be added into the culture during the stimulation at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. This allows for staining of target molecules that are re-internalized by cells during the activation process.   Addition of costimulatory antibodies is optional. Add 1 μg/ml final concentration of CD28 and/or CD49d (labeled antibody can be used if analysis of the marker is desired).     Incubate the cells for 4 h (PMA + ionomycin stimulation, PHA + ionomycin stimulation) or 6-8 h (SEB, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, peptide stimulation) at 37 °C, in a CO2 incubator.  Note: For most cytokines 6-12 h incubation at 37 °C is sufficient; For IL-10 optimal incubatation time is 12-24 h, but it is possible to detect in 6 h.   At the end of stimulation, add EDTA to a final concentration of 2 mM and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.      Staining   Wash 2x with 250 µl CyFACS buffer per well 1,550 rpm (RCF = 473), 10 min at room temperature. The same volume and centrifuge conditions are used in additional wash steps before fixation with PFA (step C6).   Make surface Ab cocktail in CyFACS buffer (filter with 0.1 µm spin filter) 100 µl per reaction. Incubate on ice for 45 min. Use vendor’s recommended concentration (or optimal titer as determined for self-made conjugates) for each antibody.   Wash 2x in CyFACS buffer.",

Resuspend in 100 µl of 2% PFA in CyPBS, Incubate 4 °C overnight.   Wash 2x in 1x eBioscience perm buffer (1x in milliQ water), 2,000 rpm (RCF = 787), 10 min at 4 °C.
