    "NOTE: The production, purification, and crystallization of GCSH are described in Supplementary File 1.\n1. Brief description of the offline preparation and crystal mounting\nPosition a nylon loop or another crystal mounting support already fixed to a SPINE pin under one or more crystals and lift them out of the precipitation solution (20 µL of 0.5 M sodium formate pH 4.0 + 25 µL of protein solution).\n\t\nRemove the bulk liquid around the crystal(s) by touching the mount with a paper wick to suck off any excess liquid.\nSoak the crystal(s) in the cryoprotective solution containing the precipitation solution plus 30% glycerol; then, remove both the crystal support and the crystal(s).\n\t\nRemove the bulk liquid around the crystal(s) by touching the mount with a paper wick to suck off any excess liquid.\nPlunge the mount into a SPINE vial filled with liquid nitrogen and store it, along with any other crystals similarly prepared, in a European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)/ESRF sample changer puck9 at liquid nitrogen temperature.\n\tNOTE: The crystal(s) are stable in this condition until the beamtime is available.\n2. Requesting beamtime on MASSIF-1\nRequest beamtime as early as possible on the ESRF homepage (at http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/UserGuide/Applying).\n\tNOTE: There are a number of possible modes of access to the ESRF MX beamlines. Laboratories can apply collectively as part of a Block Allocation Group (BAG), to have beamtime allocated for 2 years. If groups wish to apply individually, they can apply for rolling access, which allows them rapid access to the beamlines after peer review. The group’s proposal will be reviewed and cleared by the ESRF Safety Group who may request additional details. If the proposal is accepted, an experiment number and password will be communicated. Proprietary research can be performed by purchasing beamtime.",
    "Complete the required safety training online (at http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/UserGuide/Preparing/SafetyTraining).\nBook beamtime on the MASSIF-1 Calendar.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to book up to a maximum of 50 sample holders to be analyzed per shift.\nFill in the A-form to declare a mail-in experiment (http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/UserGuide/Preparing/new-a-form), along with the required safety information, for the samples that are to be measured.\n3. Creation of a diffraction plan in ISPyB\nNOTE: The diffraction plan holds all the information needed for a sample in ISPyB and can contain additional information to tailor the experiment performed for each sample.\nOpen ISPyB (at https://exi.esrf.fr/).\nChoose MX experiments.\nLog in with the experiment number and password.\nClick on Shipment | Add new and provide the necessary information. Click Save.\nClick Add parcel and fill in the information requested. Click Save.\nThen, click Add container, give the puck barcode as the name, and choose SPINE puck. Click Save.\nClick on the container symbol and Edit, and fill in the necessary information, like protein name, preferred workflow, crystal position in the puck, etc., concerning the samples.\nChoose the protein (for example, GCSH or lysozyme) that has been approved by the ESRF safety group.\nEnter a unique sample name to identify each individual sample. It is possible to optionally scan the pin barcode. The rest of the information below is optional.\nEnter the optional information.\n\t\nFor each individual sample, enter the experiment type (i.e., MXPressE_SAD, SCORE, or MXPressO, etc., default MXPressE) under Exp. Type. This defines which automatic workflow will be used to process each crystal. Given that the GCSH crystals are needles, choose MXPressP.\nEnter a space group (for example, P1, C2, or P212121), if known. If present, this will be used for data collection strategy calculations and by the automatic data processing pipelines available.",
    "Enter the desired resolution (default: dmin = 2.0 Å). This defines the crystal-to-detector distance for the initial mesh scans, characterization, and default data collection.\nSet the desired threshold resolution (for example, 1.5 Å or 2.3Å), to prevent the collection of full datasets from crystals which do not diffract to this limit. This can save data storage space and analysis time.\nSet the required completeness (default: 0.99). Set the required multiplicity (default: 4). If more than one crystal is contained on the sample support, set the maximum number of crystals to be analyzed. The default value is 1 or 5 for MXPressP.\nSelect the appropriate beam size (default: 50 µm). If a specific value is not selected, the X-ray-centering and data collection strategy calculations will be performed with a beam size of 50 µm.\n\t\tNOTE: During any subsequent collection of complete data sets, the beam size will be adapted automatically.\nPut in the space group, if known, in the forced space group column. Set the radiation-sensitivity of the crystals (0.5–2.0 for low to high sensitivity, with a default value of 1).\nIf desired, set the total rotation angle to be collected for the full dataset collection (default: the total rotation angle determined by eEDNA).\nSave the values. Click on Return to Shipments. Press Send Shipment to ESRF.\nPrint the shipping label and send the samples. Users should arrange a pickup with a courier, using the ESRF account details.\n\tNOTE: It is very important to select Include return label to allow the seamless return of samples (see https://www.esrf.eu/MXDewarReimbursement).\n4. Data collection, viewing, and retrieval",
    "NOTE: On the day of the experiment, samples are transferred to the MASSIF-1 High Capacity Dewar (HCD). Beamline scientists then launch the data collection, which can be followed by users remotely. For each different sample type users receive an e-mail informing them that the data collection has started. As previously noted, the execution of all steps in all workflows can be followed online and in real-time by the user via ISPyB, from which the results can be viewed and downloaded.\nFor each sample analyzed, examine the results of the automatic experiment in ISPyB (https://exi.esrf.fr/).\n\t\nLog in, using the experiment number and password, and click on the desired experimental session at ID30A-1.\nSelect the preferred (top-scoring) autoprocessing pipeline (for example, Grenades or XDS_APP) and download the data written out in the correct space group with the highest completeness and highest resolution by clicking on Last Collect Results and, then, Download.",
    "NOTE: All mesh, line, and characterization images are in a subdirectory for each sample, called /MXPressE_01. The ESRF automatically runs five separate processing packages, namely EDNA_proc12, Grenades12, XDS_APP14, autoPROC15, and XIA216. Data integration is based on XDS, with the exception of XIA2, which is based on DIALS. All packages are also run in anomalous and nonanomalous modes, allowing the automatic detection of an anomalous signal, if present in the data, to be used in SAD phasing protocols. Each package uses different parameters and decision trees, meaning that some packages run better with certain samples. However, this can make for a large number of results when the number of packages and possible space groups is accounted for. The results are, therefore, ranked based roughly on resolution and other quality metrics, such as Rmerge in the lowest resolution shell, CC(1/2), and completeness. This is aimed at guiding the user to the best data sets, but all possible space groups and results should be inspected carefully.\nUnzip the downloaded folder, which will include all log files and unmerged XDS_ASCII.HKL and merged and scaled .mtz files.",
    "NOTE: In case the structure (in PDB format) of the protein of interest or a close homolog was uploaded to ISPyB at the start of the experiment, the autoprocessing pipeline at ESRF will automatically perform a molecular replacement (MR) run using this structure as the search model on the best scoring solution. The results of the MR pipeline are displayed in ISPyB and can be found in the processed data folder (for example, /data/visitor/mx2112/id30a1/20180711/PROCESSED_DATA/GCSH/GCSH-x5/autoprocessing_GCSH-x5_run1_1/grenades_fastproc/user_nohet.pdb_mrpipe_dir/). Here, the final model will be named coot1.pdb and the reflection data sidechains.mtz. Note that the pipeline might reduce the symmetry of the cell (primitive cell reduction) in order to increase the likelihood of finding a solution. In the case here, the MR pipeline wrote out the solution in a monoclinic cell (C2) rather than in an orthorhombic cell (C2221). Details on how to perform a molecular replacement run manually (exemplified for the second best-scoring autoprocessing solution) are included in the Supplementary Files."
