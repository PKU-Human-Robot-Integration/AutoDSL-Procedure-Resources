    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnesthesia\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section describes the procedure to anesthetize the mice.\nWeigh the mice before giving anesthesia and inject the anesthesia mixture into the peritoneum (I.P) of 6 weeks old C57/Bl6 male mice.\nInject 50 μL of anesthesia into mice weighing 17–20 grams.\nNote: This dose is used for mice ranging 5–6 weeks which weigh (16–20 grams) to temporarily anesthetize the mice. Mice with higher weight or age are not used for I.C injection as their cranium gets harder to inject. Confirm the effect of anesthesia by pinching the tail or foot pad of mice and do not proceed until they are completely unconscious.\nInjection of the oligonucleotide into the cranium\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section describes injection of oligonucleotide precisely into the cranium of mice and avoid any bleeding from site of injection.\nDissolve oligonucleotides and fill the solution into 0.5 mL syringe with thin needle (26 G   5 ⁄ 8   gauge).\nWipe the head region of mice (no shaving required) with 70% alcohol and hold the head of the mice from the side of its neck with left hand.\nVery slowly start piercing the needle of syringe into the left side of the cranium at the frontal side of the cortex (left cerebral area as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2165-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. various steps of intracranial injection of antimiR into mouse brain and position of needle in the cranium while injecting\nNote: Once the needle tip pierces into the cranium, no resistance to the needle is felt. Do not move the needle further into the brain as it may disrupt brain vessels and may cause bleeding.",
    "As soon as the tip of needle penetrates the cranium, do not pierce the needle further deep into the brain and inject 20 μL of antimiR solution into cranium. The position of needle in the cranium is depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nSlowly take the needle out of the brain and observe the site of injection carefully in order to check bleeding or popping out of the solution. Any leakage or bleeding will be clearly visible at site of injection.\nNote: The solution should not leak out from the site of injection for efficient delivery of the oligonucleotide to the brain. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] depicts injection of antimiR efficiently into cranium without causing any bleeding from site of injection.\nRecovery from anesthesia\nTiming: 20 min\nThis section describes the recovery of mice after intracranial injection.\nKeep the mice on a heating pad for some time until they start regaining consciousness.\nPlace the mice back into the cage and monitor them until they start moving.\nPlace a diet gel so that they have easy source of food in the cage.\nObservation of injected mice\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section describes observing injected mice for any symptoms and monitoring body weight.\nObserve the mice daily and monitor its body weight.\nHarvesting the injected mice\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes perfusion of mouse brain with paraformaldehyde and isolation after 4 days post injection weight.\nAfter 4 days, inject a terminal dose of anesthesia into the peritoneum of mice and allow the mice to lose consciousness.\nNote: 80 μL of anesthesia with mixture of ketamine and xylazine used at same final concentration as mentioned above is considered terminal dose for mice weighing 17–20 grams.",
    "Place the mice on a surgical pad and make an incision to expose their hearts (on the ventral side of the body).\nInject 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS into the beating hearts of mice to drain out blood from the blood vessels.\nNote: Perfusion is done only to remove blood from blood vessels.\nThen make an incision at the snout area between eyes (dorsal side) and remove the skin to expose the cranium.\nCut the cranium by using scissors and isolate the brain. Snap chill brain tissue in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 degree.\nConfirmation of silencing of miRNA-24 in mouse brain\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis section describes isolation of RNA and protein from mouse brain and confirmation of miRNA-24 silencing by RT-PCR and Western blotting.\nConfirm the silencing of miR-24 in mouse brains by RT-PCR using a miR-24 specific Taqman probe. For extraction of miRNA and protein from same tissue, use the miRVana PARIS kit using manufacturer protocol available online.\nhttps://www.thermofisher.com/documentconnect/documentconnect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Ffm_1556.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/documentconnect/documentconnect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Ffm_1556.pdf].\nNote: To ensure that the injected oligonucleotide has been well absorbed in the brain tissue, use the right hemisphere for RNA and protein isolation (as the oligonucleotide is injected into the left side) for confirmation of miR-24 silencing.\nReverse-transcribe the extracted RNA into cDNA using Taqman reverse transcriptase kit following the manufacturer protocol:\nhttps://genome.med.harvard.edu/documents/qpcr/microRNATaqManAssayProtocol.pdf[href=https://genome.med.harvard.edu/documents/qpcr/microRNATaqManAssayProtocol.pdf].\nPerform RT-PCR using the Taqman probes specific to miR-24 using manufacturer protocol.\nhttps://genome.med.harvard.edu/documents/qpcr/microRNATaqManAssayProtocol.pdf[href=https://genome.med.harvard.edu/documents/qpcr/microRNATaqManAssayProtocol.pdf].\nSilencing of microRNA causes de-repression of the target mRNA. Confirm the silencing of miR-24 by assessing the expression of STING and Myc protein (which are direct targets of miR-24) through Western blotting."
