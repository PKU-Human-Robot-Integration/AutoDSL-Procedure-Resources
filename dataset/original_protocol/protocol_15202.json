    "1. Identification of Morphological and Molecular Tumor Heterogeneity\nTumors removed from -80 °C freezer and kept on dry ice.\nDivide tumors into sections of approximately 1 cm3. Map the original position of each tumor section relative to each other and label with a unique name. Store samples in individual cryovials at -80 °C until ready for use.\nCoat samples in OCT and cut in a cryostat at -22 °C.\nSamples stained using Hematoxylin and Eosin counterstaining method.\nMicroscopy analysis of frozen sections to ensure they are of ccRCC nature, viable tumor and for grading (low grade, high grade or mixed low/high grade, challenging to differentiate Fuhrman grades 1 to 4 on frozen section). Figure 1 a&b (H&E staining of high low and mixed grade).\nSelect up to 4 samples from each morphologically differing region within each tumor for protein extraction.\n2. Protein Extraction from Tumor Samples\nCut tumor sample from OCT.\nPlace 50-75 mg of tissue into 2 ml tubes with 990 μl of lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EGTA (pH 8.5), 150 mM NaCl] supplemented with aprotinin (Sigma A6279) (10 mg/ml), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma, P5716), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma, P0044) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11836153001).\nAdd a single 5 mm steel ball to each tube and homogenize at 50Hz for 5 min twice using a TissueLyser, checking the level of homogenization after each 5 min period.\nTransfer homogenized sample to new 2 ml tube using pipette leaving the steel ball behind.\nAdd 10 μl of Triton X-100 to each sample before centrifuging at 13,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer supernatants to fresh microcentrifuge tubes.\nDetermine protein concentration using BCA assay (Figure 2).\nNormalize protein concentrations at 1 mg/ml.\n3. Antibody Validation",
    "Prepare protein samples (extracted from suitable cell lines or tissue) for western blot and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.\nTransfer samples onto nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 4 °C.\nBlock the membrane in Li-Cor Odyssey Blocking Buffer (diluted 50:50 in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature.\nDilute the primary antibodies in Li-Cor Odyssey Blocking Buffer (diluted 50:50 in PBS) at the manufacturers recommended dilution typically 1 in 1,000.\nIncubate membrane in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C.\nMake up 0.1% PBS-Tween20 (PBS-T; 1 ml Tween20 /1L PBS).\nWash membrane in PBS-T at room temperature for 5 min (x3).\nDilute fluorescently-labelled secondary antibodies in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (diluted 50:50 in PBS) 0.01% SDS at 1:10,000 dilution (1.5 μl/15 ml).\nIncubate membrane in secondary antibodies at room temperature for 45 min with gentle shaking - it is important to protect the membrane from the light until such time as it has been finally scanned.\nWash membrane in PBS-T at room temperature for 5 min (x3), keeping the membrane in the dark.\nWash membrane in PBS at room temperature for 5 min (x3) to remove residual Tween20, again keeping the membrane in the dark.\nLie membrane flat on a piece of filter paper in the dark and allow to air dry - allowing the membrane to dry may enhance the signal and reduce background but render it useless for stripping and re-probing.\nScan the membrane on the LiCor Odyssey scanner. Keep the membrane in the dark until such time as it has been scanned.\nOnly select antibodies that generate a single predominant band at the correct molecular weight. Figure 3 shows examples of acceptable and unacceptable antibodies for use with RPPA.\n4. RPPA Printing",
    "Protein lysates were spotted onto nitrocellulose- coated glass slides (Fastslides-Whatman) using a MicroGrid II robotic spotter. The slides used contained 2 pads onto which the samples were spotted. Each pad was spotted with identical samples, in this case 100 samples. Other available formats include 1, 8 and 16 pad slides. The higher the number of pads the smaller the number of samples which can be spotted onto each.\nA series of five 2-fold dilutions were made from each sample and each was then spotted in triplicate (resulting in a total of 15 spots per sample).\n5. RPPA Protein Detection\nWet slides in excess LiCor Blocking Buffer (diluted 50:50 in PBS). Incubate at RT for 1 hr on a rocking platform.\nPrepare 800 μl of primary antibodies in LiCor Blocking Buffer (diluted 50:50 in PBS) at the desired concentrations and keep on ice.\nMount the slides in either (i) the single frame Chip Clip or (ii) the 'FastFrame' four bay slide holder so that a tight seal is formed between the slide and the incubation chamber.\nRemove residual buffer from wells and add 600 μl primary antibody to respective wells.\nPlace the slide and chamber into a sealed wet box and incubate on rocking platform overnight at 4 °C.\nMake up 0.1% PBS-Tween20 (PBS-T; 100 μl Tween 20 /100 ml PBS).\nRemove slides from cold room and carefully remove the primary antibodies from each well.\nAdd 600 μl of PBS-T and wash slides on rocking platform at RT for 5 min (X3).\nPrepare fluorescently-labelled secondary antibodies by diluting in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (diluted 50:50 in PBS) 0.01% SDS at 1:2,000 dilution (1 μl/2 ml) in the first instance.",
    "Remove buffer from wells and add 600 μl fluorescently-labelled secondary antibodies to respective wells. Incubate secondary antibodies at room temperature for 45 min with gentle shaking - it is important to protect the membrane from the light until such time as it has been finally scanned.\nRemove secondary antibodies from well and briefly wash (x3) in 600 μl PBS-T at room temperature. Remove slide from carrier, transfer to a suitable container and wash in excess PBS-T for 15 min, keeping the membrane in the dark.\nRemove PBS-T and further wash membrane with PBS at room temperature for 15 min to remove residual Tween-20, again keeping the membrane in the dark.\nDry the Fastslide in 50 °C oven for 10 min and then scan on the Li-Cor Odyssey scanner. Keep the slide in the dark until it has been scanned.\nScan the slide at 680 nm and/or 800 nm depending on the secondary antibody/antibodies used. For two-color detection always use highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies to minimize cross reactivity. Careful selection of primary and secondary antibodies is necessary for two-color detection. Of primary importance is the selection of different host species (e.g. rabbit and mouse) for the two primary antibodies. This allows discrimination by anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies which are labelled with dye with easily distinguishable emission spectra.\nImage files are saved as .tiff files. Figure 4 (image of scanned files).\n6. Data Analysis\nLaunch the MicroVigene Software (VigeneTech, Carlisle, MA, USA).\nOpen .tiff image file containing the scan of the RPPA slide.\nSelect a predefined template file which will have a grid to overlay on the image of the RPPA slide.\nClick the Define Regions of Interest (ROI) button, to bring up the Grid.\nPosition the Grid over the RPPA spots. Figure 6a (image of grid over image).",
    "Click the Select ALL button to highlight all the ROI.\nClick Find All. MicroVigene will automatically find the ROI, find the spots, subtract the background, remove any dust and quantify spots.\nClick the View Dilution Curve button to bring up the results for all the samples on the RPPA slide.\nClick Save Dilution Data.\nAs each sample is printed across 5 dilution points each in triplicate there are 15 points to analyze, which reduces the risk of errors and improves the quality of curve fitting. MicroVigene produces a 4-parameter logistic-log model \"Supercurve\" algorithm (Figure 6b), that incorporates all spots to produce a sigmoid curve of antigen-antibody binding kinetics. The assumption is that the same antibody-antigen binding kinetics is taking place at each sample spot, even in the different samples, thus by taking all spots on an array to fit a common response curve can increase the confidence of the curve fitting10,11\n Y=a+ ((b-a)/(1+e(c*d-ln(x)))\n where x is the dilution factor and Y is the signal intensity.\n Samples can be comparatively analyzed by using the y0 value, which in our analysis corresponded to the y value at the midpoint of the x values after mapping those onto the supercurve.\nExport the data in Microsoft Excel and plot y0 as in Figure 7.",
    "Intratumoral protein variance was calculated separately for untreated and treated treated patients in an ANOVA framework. Variance distributions combining data from all the analyzed proteins were compared by a Mann-Whitney test (MWT). Intratumoral variances for individual proteins were compared by an F-test where assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity held, respectively assessed using the Lillefours and Fligner tests; false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied12. Differential protein expression between untreated and treated patient samples was tested for each protein using student's t-test where normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were met, otherwise MWT was performed; FDR was applied over combined t-test and MWT values 12. Significance of protein expression and variance Pearson correlation for the proteins were estimated using a standard approach [R reference] and FDR applied 12.\nSubscription Required.
