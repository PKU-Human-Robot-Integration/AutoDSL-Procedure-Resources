    "Notes: It is essential to perform the experiment in ≥3 biological replicates using different batches of purified protein and total RNA. Conditions need to be optimized for each experimental system. Protein and/or RNA titration might be required to obtain an optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Include a vitRIP reaction with experimental RNA, but lacking the recombinant protein, to score RNA background on beads. Additional control reactions (e.g., total RNA extracted from a different species or protein mutated in its RNA binding domain (if known)) might help to further characterize the specificity of identified protein-RNA interactions. Work in RNase-free conditions. Preparation of total RNACultivate Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells under standard conditions. For details, see Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/Home[href=https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/Home]).Collect 5 × 106 exponentially growing cells by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min, 25 °C) and discard the supernatant.Wash the cell pellet with 500 µl PBS, collect by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min, 25 °C) and discard the supernatant.Proceed directly with RNA extraction or store the cell pellet at -80 °C for a maximum duration of 3 months.Extract total RNA using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute the RNA in 50 µl RNase-free water and determine the concentration spectrophotometrically. The typical yield from 5 × 106 S2 cells ranges between 25-50 µg.Store extracted RNA at -80 °C until further use (for a maximum duration of 1 year). Avoid frequent freezing/thawing of the RNA sample to prevent degradation.Note: Any other cell line or animal tissue can be used. We successfully tested several male and female Drosophila cell lines as well as head tissue from adult Drosophila. The methodology for RNA extraction from tissues might require adjustment. Preparation of highly purified proteinNote: The vitRIP protocol presented here uses the well-characterized RNA helicase MLE as an example.",
    "However, vitRIP can be applied to any protein, which can be purified to near-homogeneity. Protein purification strategies have to be determined for each protein individually and cannot be generalized. Express the protein of interest in an appropriate heterologous expression system (e.g., E. coli or SF21 insect cells) and purify to near-homogeneity. Analyze the purity of the protein sample by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.Determine the protein concentration by an appropriate method (absorption at 280 nm or Bradford protein assay). If necessary, use spin concentrators to increase the protein concentration. Flash freeze small aliquots (10-20 µl) and store at -80 °C. The required protein concentration for vitRIP strongly depends on the affinity to RNA substrates and needs to be determined empirically by applying protein titration series, as described in Müller et al. (2020). See also Step D, Note 3.Before use, thaw protein prep on ice, spin down to remove potential aggregates (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and use the supernatant for vitRIP.The purification of full-length FLAG-tagged Drosophila melanogaster MLE after baculovirus-driven expression in SF21 cells is described in detail in Izzo et al. (2008) and Maenner et al. (2013), differing only in the elution buffer for MLE (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol). Purified MLE has a typical concentration of 0.5-1 µg/µl and can be used directly for vitRIP.Preparation of Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity GelNote: Prepare the resin always fresh. Any other resin matching the affinity tag can be used. Alternatively, protein-specific antibodies coated to Protein A or Protein G Sepharose may be used. Use 20 µl Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (“beads”) for each vitRIP reaction.",
    "Wash the beads: Add 1 ml PBS, invert the tube 10 times, centrifuge for 1 min at 500 × g, 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step one more time.Block the beads: Add 2% BSA/PBS/0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA to the bead and incubate for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Centrifuge for 1 min at 500 × g, 4 °C and discard the supernatant. This step intends to prevent non-specific binding of protein and/or total RNA to the FLAG affinity gel.Wash the beads: Add 1 ml vitRIP-100 buffer, invert the tube 10 times, centrifuge for 1 min at 500 × g, 4 °C and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step one more time.With the last washing step, discard as much of the supernatant as possible and keep beads on ice.Pull down of RNA-protein complexesNotes: Pipet all steps on ice and centrifuge at 4 °C. Use low-binding tubes. The RNA amount for vitRIP depends on the abundance of individual transcripts and on the affinity of the studied protein to RNA. The amount might be determined empirically by applying an RNA titration series. In our hands, 2 µg total RNA per vitRIP reaction (100 µl volume) worked well. The protein concentration for vitRIP depends on the affinity to RNA and needs to be determined empirically by titration. We recommend to start with 10-250 nM of recombinant protein and 2 µg of total RNA. If no binding is observed, protein amount may be increased. MLE vitRIP was performed with 5-50 nM protein.  Per reaction, dilute 2 µg of total RNA with vitRIP-100 buffer to a final volume of 10 µl. 10% of this mix (1 µl) serves as an RNA input sample and is kept on ice.",
    "Mix the remaining 90% of the RNA mix (9 µl) with the purified protein (MLE-FLAG: 5 nM and 50 nM, respectively) in a total volume of 100 µl in vitRIP-100 buffer including 10 µg BSA, 0.1 U/µl RNase-free recombinant DNase I, 0.8 U/µl RNasin RNase inhibitor and 1 mM ATP.Incubate 30 min at 25 °C (thermoblock with heated lid).Spin down reaction at 20,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C and transfer the supernatant to blocked and equilibrated FLAG beads (from Step C5) in a 1.5 ml tube.Incubate for 30 min at RT (22 °C) with rotation.Centrifuge at 500 × g, 1 min, 4 °C and discard the supernatant (= unbound fraction).Wash beads with 1 ml vitRIP-100 buffer: Add 1 ml buffer, rotate 1 min at room temperature, centrifuge for 1 min at 500 × g, 4 °C and discard the supernatant.Wash beads with 1 ml vitRIP-250 buffer: Add 1 ml buffer, rotate 1 min at room temperature, centrifuge for 1 min at 500 × g, 4 °C and discard the supernatant.Wash beads with 1 ml vitRIP-100 buffer: Add 1 ml buffer, rotate 1 min at room temperature and distribute the beads in two tubes for protein and RNA extraction: 75% (750 µl) for RNA extraction and 25% (250 µl) for protein extraction. Centrifuge for 1 min at 500 × g, 4 °C and discard the supernatant.Protein extraction for Western Blot analysisTo each sample (25% bead material, from Step D10), add 20 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Incubate at 95 °C, 5 min, with agitation.Centrifuge for 1 min at 500 × g to pellet beads and analyze the supernatant by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot for successful protein pull down.Note: vitRIP of FLAG-tagged MLE is analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody at 1:5,000 (v/v) dilution.",
    "MLE is visible as a single band corresponding to a molecular weight of 145 kDa. RNA extraction for RNA identificationInput samples: Mix 10% RNA input (1 µl), 5 µl 10% SDS, 10 µl Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) and 84 µl vitRIP-100 buffer. Incubate in a thermoblock (with heated lid) at 55 °C, 45 min with agitation at 1,000 rpm.IP samples (75% bead material, from step D10): Add 5 µl 10% SDS, 10 µl Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) and 85 µl vitRIP-100 buffer. Incubate in a thermoblock (with heated lid) at 55 °C, 45 min with agitation (1,000 rpm).Centrifuge tubes for 1 min at 500 × g at room temperature to pellet beads of IP samples.Transfer the supernatant (contains eluted RNA) and transfer to a fresh 1.5 ml tube.To each sample (Input and IP), add 1 volume (around 100 µl) of acidic phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol. Vortex each tube thoroughly for 10 sec and centrifuge 5 min at 20,000 × g at room temperature.Safety note: Always use a fume hood when handling phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol and appropriately dispose of phenol-containing waste. Transfer the upper, aqueous phase (contains RNA; around 100 µl) to a fresh 1.5-ml tube and add 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 20 µg RNase-free glycogen and 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% EtOH.Incubate at -20 °C for > 12 h to precipitate the RNA.Centrifuge at 20,000 × g (full speed), 4 °C for 30 min. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant with a pipet tip without disturbing the RNA pellet, which is small and might be invisible.Wash pellet by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 70% EtOH.Centrifuge at 20,000 × g (full speed), 4 °C for 15 min. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.Remove as much liquid as possible with a 20 µl pipet and air-dry the pellet (10-15 min).",
    "Resuspend the RNA pellet in 20 µl RNase-free water. Pipet up and down 10 times, followed by a quick spin. For complete solubilization, incubate the samples for 15 min at 25 °C with gentle agitation (500 rpm).Quantify 2 µl of the purified RNA using a Qubit fluorometer and the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity (HS) Assay kit.Note: The RNA concentration of IP samples might very low and not in the range of the Qubit RNA HS Assay kit standard. Our experience showed that RNA sequencing libraries could still be prepared with the NEB Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit. Other RNA-Seq library prep kits dealing with low-input samples may be employed. Store RNA at -80 °C until further use.RT-PCRNotes: If one or several RNA targets of the protein of interest are known, vitRIP can be analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using gene-specific primers. It is important to include a non-bound transcript (e.g., housekeeping genes) as the negative control. In MLE vitRIP, the enrichment of the known MLE target roX2 RNA is quantified using roX2-specific primers and represented as the bound fraction relative to the input. The abundant 7SK RNA serves as the negative control. For details on primer sequences, see Müller et al. (2020). An example is given in Figure 2A. DNase I digestMix 8 µl RNA, 1 µl 10× DNase I reaction buffer, 0.5 µl DNase I and 0.5 µl RNasin.Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C. Store on ice.cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SystemUse 10 µl DNase I-treated RNA and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cDNA synthesis using random hexamer priming.Dilute the cDNA 1:5 to 1:50 (depending on the transcript abundance) with RNase-free water and analyze by qRT-PCR using transcript-specific primers and FAST SYBR Green Mastermix. Follow the recommendations specific for your Real-Time PCR machine.",
    "RNA-Seq Library preparationNote: The library preparation protocol depends on the experimental strategy. The high content of rRNA in total RNA will interfere with the analysis and should be removed before the library prep. In MLE vitRIP samples, rRNA is depleted using rRNA probes specific for human/mouse/rat rRNA, which also work reasonably well for Drosophila rRNA. This strategy allows for the identification of various RNA species in vitRIP samples (coding and non-coding). Alternatively, polyadenylated RNAs can be enriched using oligo d(T) beads if the experimental strategy aims at identifying exclusively enriched polyadenylated RNAs. Starting material for library preparationQuality control: Analyze 1 µl of purified input and immunoprecipitated RNA on a Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit.Choose an appropriate RNA quantity according to the recommendations of the RNA-Seq library prep kit. For MLE vitRIP library preparation with the NEB Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit, 30-40 ng RNA served as starting material.rRNA depletionUse 30-40 ng RNA as quantified by Qubit fluorometer for rRNA depletion using the NEB rRNA Depletion Kit.Follow the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://international.neb.com/protocols/2017/02/07/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-rrna-depletion-kit-human-mouse-rat-neb-e6310-and-nebnext-ultra-ii-directional-rna-library-prep-kit-for-illumina-neb-e7760-e7765] for rRNA depletion (NEB # E6310  ).Analyze 1 µl of rRNA-depleted sample on a Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit.
