    "All methods described here have been approved by the VA Puget Sound Health Care System’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nNOTE: Local requirements for monitoring and/or intervention of animals that experience hypoglycemia may differ from those described here.\n1. Fasting (t= -210 min)\nAfter the dark cycle has ended, transfer mice to a new cage with non-nutritious bedding such as cellulose or paper bedding (not corn-cob bedding, which will affect metabolic endpoints if consumed by mice13). Provide mice with ad libitum access to water throughout the fasting period. Be consistent with the fasting time of day and duration across groups of mice. For the data shown, food was removed between 0700 and 0800 hours, which was 1-2 hours after the dark cycle had ended.\nMove cage(s) to the location where the ITT will be performed. This should be a quiet space where stressors such as temperature, noise, light or movement are minimized.\n2. Acclimation (t= -150 to -60 min)\nIMPORTANT: Handle mice as gently as possible. Avoid use of a restraint device if possible.\nAt -150 min, measure body weight. This will be used for calculation of the volume of insulin that will be administered for the ITT.\nPick up the mouse gently by the tail and rest on a flat tabletop surface while still gently gripping the tail. Use a 20 G needle (or surgical scissors) to make a small incision in the tip of the tail. A drop of blood should begin to form at the site.\nSet the mouse on a smooth hard surface and restrain the mouse gently by the tail.",
    "To record blood glucose at this time, place a drop of blood from the tail tip on the test strip of a handheld glucometer. If necessary, very gently massage the tail to obtain a drop of blood.\nDraw up 100 µL of sterile saline into an insulin syringe. Pick up the mouse using gentle scruffing and inject intraperitoneally. Record the time of saline injection.\n\t\nIf multiple mice are being studied, inject the mice with saline at 1 min intervals to allow time for subsequent steps below.\nAt 15 min after saline injection, pick up the mouse gently by the tail. Use gauze to gently dislodge any blood clot on the tail tip.\n\t\nOptional: Record blood glucose again at this time as described in step 2.3.\nAt 30 min after the saline injection gently pick up the mouse by the tail. If desired, obtain another blood glucose measurement as described in step 2.3.\nReturn the mouse to the cage, and repeat for other mice as necessary. Leave mice undisturbed until -90 min.\nAt -90 min, repeat steps 2.3 through 2.6, including measurement of blood glucose levels if desired.\nReturn the mouse to the cage, repeat for other mice as necessary. Leave mice undisturbed until the ITT (for which the baseline blood glucose measurement is done at -5 min).\n3. Insulin Tolerance Test (t= -5 to +60 min)\nPrepare a working solution of regular insulin (CAUTION) in sterile saline, such that the desired dose can be injected at 4 µL/g body weight.\n\tNOTE: Caution should be used when handling insulin as accidental injection can result in hypoglycemia.\nPrepare a 25% (v/v) dextrose solution in sterile saline to have on hand in case mice develop hypoglycemia requiring intervention.",
    "At -5 min, pick up the mouse gently by the tail. Determine the baseline blood glucose level at this time, by placing a drop of blood from the tail tip on the test strip of a handheld glucometer. If necessary, very gently massage the tail to obtain a drop of blood.\nDraw up insulin working solution into an insulin syringe (4 µL/g body weight, for a typical dose range of 0.5-2.0 U/kg). Pick up the mouse using gentle scruffing and inject intraperitoneally. Record time of insulin injection.\n\t\nIf multiple mice are being studied, inject the mice with insulin at 1 min intervals to allow time for subsequent blood sampling and data recording below.\nAt 15 min after insulin injection, pick up the mouse gently by the tail. Use gauze to gently dislodge any blood clot on the tail tip. Determine the blood glucose again at this time as described in step 3.3.\nReturn the mouse to the cage and monitor for signs of hypoglycemia (e.g., excessive lethargy). If mice develop symptoms of hypoglycemia, measure blood glucose as described in step 5 and administer dextrose if necessary. A mouse undergoing dextrose intervention would be removed from the ITT protocol at this time.\nRepeat steps 3.5 and 3.6 at 30 min after insulin injection.\nRepeat steps 3.5 and 3.6 at 45 min after insulin injection.\nRepeat steps 3.5 and 3.6 at 60 min after insulin injection.\nReturn the mice to their home cage, containing a few food pellets on the floor of the cage to aid in recovery from the ITT. Continue to monitor for 30 min and if mice have not regained normal activity/behavior follow procedure described in step 3.6.\n\tNOTE: Figure 1 summarizes the above acclimation and ITT procedure.\nSubscription Required.
