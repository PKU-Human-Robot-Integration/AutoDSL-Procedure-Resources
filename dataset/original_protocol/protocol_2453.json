    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWhole blood stimulation\nTiming: 5 h 30 min (including 5 h incubation time)\nThis section describes the steps to stimulate whole blood with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide.\nPrepare the stimulation mixes in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes labeled appropriately (Negative control and Spike for the unstimulated and SARS-CoV-2 spike condition, respectively) according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Start by adding the PBS and then the other components.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2087_5.csv\naIncluding a 10% overage.\nbThe peptide pool used in this protocol does not contain DMSO. If the peptide pool contains DMSO, an equimolar amount of DMSO needs to be added to the negative control mix. q.s.: quantum satis.\nAdd 20 μL of each stimulation mix to the bottom of a 15 mL tube (i.e., 2 tubes per donor, one with the negative control mix and one with the Spike mix).\nAdd 400 μL of whole blood collected in sodium heparin (NaHep) tube to the bottom of each 15 mL tube and mix gently with the pipette to avoid creating bubbles.\nIncubate at 37°C for 5 h in a benchtop incubator or a water bath.\nProcessing of whole blood after stimulation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the steps to simultaneously lyse the red blood cells and fix the leukocytes before cryopreservation.\nAfter the 5 h stimulation, vortex gently each tube.\nAdd 1.2 mL (3:1 volume ratio) of 1× eBioscience Fixation solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) to each tube and gently vortex.\nIncubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nAdd 12 mL of PBS in each tube, close the cap and invert five times.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant and blot the tube edge on absorbent paper to remove excess liquid.\nResuspend the pellet by flicking the bottom of the tube manually.",
    "Add 1 mL of cryopreserving solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) and gently resuspend the cells.\nTransfer to appropriately labeled cryovials.\nPlace in a CoolCell™ freezing container and store at −80°C for up to 12 months (see note below).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2087-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. EDTA abrogates IFN-γ production from T cells in response to SEB\n(A) Comparison of IFN-γ production from CD3+ T cells stimulated for 5 h with SEB (0.5 μg/mL) from NaHep and EDTA blood collection tubes.\n(B) Frequency of SEB-specific CD4+ T cells from NaHep and EDTA blood collection tubes (n=3). Data are reported after background subtraction (i.e., unstimulated tube).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2087-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Detection of Mtb-specific IFN-γ+ CD4 T cells in blood volumes ranging from 50 to 500 μL\n(A) Flow cytometry plots of IFN-γ expression in CD4 T cells from blood stimulated with Mtb300 peptide pool (1 μg/mL) for 5 h.\n(B) Frequency (red square) and number of events (blue circle) of Mtb-specific IFN-γ + CD4 T cells detected using 50–500 μL of blood (n=1).\nCritical: Do not use blood collection tubes containing chelating agents such as EDTA. As illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], cytokine secretion upon a Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) stimulation is completely inhibited when the assay is performed using blood collected in EDTA tubes.\nNote: The minimal blood volume required for a whole blood assay will depend on the frequency of the cells of interest. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows the assay’s linear range, where blood volume ranging from 50 to 500 μL allows the detection of Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells with a consistent frequency.\nNote: It is recommended for blood to be processed within three hours of collection. Delays of more than three hours between blood collection and antigen stimulation have been shown to reduce antigen-stimulated cytokine secretion (Hanekom et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Hardy et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).",
    "Note: If complex antigens such as whole pathogen, pathogen lysate or proteins are used as a stimulus, it is necessary to delay the addition of brefeldin (3–6 h) to allow antigen processing and presentation (Horton et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: The cryopreservation step can be skipped, and samples can be stained immediately (see cell staining for flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] section). If samples are cryopreserved, they can be kept at −80°C for up to 12 months without affecting the assay performance (Nemes et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nThawing of cryopreserved samples\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to thaw the fixed cells in preparation for staining for flow cytometry assessment.\nBefore thawing the samples, prepare 15 mL tubes containing 10 mL of room temperature PBS containing 2% FBS.\nThaw cryopreserved samples in a water bath set at 37°C for 1 min 30 s (i.e., when cells are nearly thawed).\nTransfer cells to 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of PBS 2% FBS.\nRinse the vial with 1 mL of PBS containing 2% FBS, and add to the 15 mL tube.\nClose cap and invert the tube five times.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant and blot the tube edge on absorbent paper to remove excess liquid.\nResuspend the pellet by flicking the bottom of the tube manually.\nTransfer the dead volume (∼70–100 μL) into a 96-V bottom plate.\nAdd 100 μL of 1× eBioscience Permeabilization solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nIncubate for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 4 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant by flicking the plate (rapidly invert the plate over a waste container and gently tap the plate on a paper towel to remove excess fluid). The cells are now ready for staining.\nCell staining for flow cytometry",
    "Timing: 2 h\nThis section describes the steps to detect and phenotype SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells. Here, we used an 11-color panel to assess cytokine production (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2), memory differentiation (CD45RA and CD27), cytotoxic potential (Granzyme-B and Perforin), and the expression of the inhibitory receptor, PD-1.\nPrepare the fluorophore-conjugated antibody mix in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube according to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. Start by adding the 1× eBioscience Permeabilization solution (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) then the BD Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer plus and then each antibody.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2087_6.csv\nVortex the antibody mix.\nCentrifuge the antibody mix at 12,000 rpm (∼8,500 rcf) for 4 min in a mini centrifuge.\nStore at 4°C in the dark until use.\nCritical: BD Brilliant Stain Buffer Plus reduces possible compensation artifacts when using multiple Brilliant Violet (BV) reagents in the same flow panel. This buffer is formulated to allow for reduced test volume (10 μL/test), avoiding excessive dilution of the permeabilization buffer during staining.\nCritical: Keep all antibodies and buffers on ice while preparing the antibody mix.\nCritical: The centrifugation of the antibody staining mix (step 31) will pellet antibody aggregates that could lead to non-specific staining.\nCritical: The panel’s performance depends on the sensitivity and setting of the cytometer and reagents. Failing to titrate reagents properly may result in off-scale events or a lack of optimal separation between the negative and positive populations. It is thus critical to properly calibrate the instrument and titrate reagents before the experiment (Maciorowski et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nNote: To aid with the discrimination of positive events, one can set up fluorescent minus one (FMO) controls, where the marker of interest is omitted from the staining mix (Roederer, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). In this protocol, we strongly recommend using FMO controls for the PD-1 antibody.",
    "Note: Additionally, a “dump” channel can be added (for example CD14 and CD19) to exclude specific cell subsets from the analyses.\nAdd 50 μL of antibody mix to each well.\nMix well by pipetting up and down (8–10 times), while avoiding creating excessive bubbles.\nIncubate for 45 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAdd 170 μL of 1× eBioscience Permeabilization solution.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 4 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant by flicking the plate (rapidly invert the plate over a waste container and gently tap the plate on a paper towel to remove excess fluid).\nAdd 200 μL of 1× eBioscience Permeabilization solution and mix well by pipetting up and down (8–10 times).\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 4 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant by flicking the plate.\nAdd 100 μL of 1% formaldehyde solution and mix well by pipetting up and down (8–10 times).\nIncubate for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAdd 100 μL of PBS.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 4 min at room temperature.\nResuspend in 160 μL of PBS and transfer to prelabeled Microtiter tubes and store cells at 4°C protected from light until ready to acquire on the cytometer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2087-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The absence of viability dye in the presented protocol does not significantly affect the assay’s performance\n(A) Example of viability dye staining of lymphocytes (CD3 positive and CD3 negative cells).\n(B) Frequencies of dead cells in CD3 positive and CD3 negative lymphocytes (n=30). Bars represent medians.\n(C) Frequencies of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells producing IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2 with or without exclusion of dead cells (n=30). P values are reported on top of the graph. Satistical comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test.",
    "Note: To ensure the procedure is simple and rapid with minimal perturbation of the samples (i.e., no blood dilution, no erythrocyte lysis prior to stimulation), the usage of a viability dye to differentiate live and dead cells was not included in this protocol. To ensure that this approach does not skew the detection of antigen-specific T-cells, whole blood assays set up to measure Mtb-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were performed in the presence of a viability dye (Riou et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Briefly, whole blood was stimulated for 5 h with Mtb peptide, red blood cells were lysed, and live leucocytes were then stained with a viability dye. Cells were then fixed and cryopreserved until batch staining. Data were analyzed to define: 1) the extent of cell death in our assay, and 2) whether the absence of a viability dye affects the quantification of the antigen-specific T-cell response (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Our data show that cell death in the T-cell compartment was minimal (median: 0.19%), and the detection of cytokine-producing CD4 T-cells was comparable with or without the exclusion of dead cells. Thus, because blood is processed fresh and the stimulation time before cell fixation is short (5 h), the absence of a viability dye in the staining process does not significantly impact the quality of the results.\nPreparation of flow cytometry compensation controls\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes how to prepare single stain controls using commercial beads to calculate compensation and correct for spectral overlap between fluorophores.\nPrepare 14 Polystyrene tubes (5 mL) labeled as describe in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2087-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Experimental setup of compensation tubes\nAdd 100 μL of 1× eBioscience Permeabilization solution at the bottom of each compensation tube.\nAdd 15 μL of anti-Rat or anti-Mouse Ig compensation beads at the bottom of the appropriate tubes.",
    "Add 1 μL of antibodies to the designated tube.\nVortex tubes gently.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS 2% FBS, vortex the tubes.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant.\nResuspend in 200 μL 1% formaldehyde solution.\nIncubate for 15 min.\nAdd 2 mL of PBS, vortex the tubes.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant.\nResuspend in 200 μL of PBS 2% FBS and keep at 4°C protected from light until use.\nCritical: Since compensation beads precipitate rapidly, vortex the beads thoroughly and regularly before adding them to the 5 mL FACS tubes.\nCritical: Since compensation control beads are coated with a species-specific antibody, it is important to choose beads that will bind the host species of the fluorochrome-conjugated antibody used. Based on the antibody panel used in this protocol, only one antibody (IL-2 PE dazzle™ 594) is produced in rat, with the remainder being produced in mouse.\nPause point: We have not extensively tested saving the samples in the fridge overnight after staining. However, in the case that samples cannot be immediately acquired by the flow cytometer, the cells can be saved for 16–20 h at 4°C, protected from light."
