    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTumor harvest, digestion, and single-cell isolation\nTiming: 2 Days\nPigmented lesions will start to form on the backs of mice between days 12–15 after the last 4-HT treatment (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). The pigmented lesions will progress to a measurable melanoma between days 24–28 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). The humane endpoint is set at day 50 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). In our experience, 100% of the BRAFV600E/PTENnull/null mice painted with 4-HT develop melanoma and outgrow at a similar rate (Huang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). An advantage of this optimized digestion protocol is that we can isolate viable immune cells on day 7, prior to the generation of pigmented lesions on the backs of mice (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The latter enables us to characterize potential rare immune cell populations such as ILC2s, which are known to be “first-responder” immune cells at the site of inflammation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/766-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Melanoma progression following 4-HT treatment\n(A) Day 7 following 4-HT treatment. During this timepoint, no pigmented lesions yet visible.\n(B) Day 12 – 14 following 4-HT treatment. During this timepoint, pigmented lesions will start to form.\n(C) Day 24 – 28 following 4-HT treatment. During this timepoint, measurable tumors will start to form.\n(D) Any time after Day 40 following 4-HT treatment, mice are monitored closely for human endpoints.\nPrior to harvesting the skin or tumor, it is recommended to shave the mice. We determined that cutting the skin tumors with a razor into thin strips and then into 1–2 mm2 squares resulted in optimal cell viability and numbers.",
    "By optimizing the skin digestion protocol, we determined Collagenase P to be the optimal digestion enzyme. We also tested Collagenase IV, Collagenase D, Dispase I, and Liberase TM but found that the obtained cell viabilities and counts were very low (~30% viable cells). Cell viability and yield further improved when tissues were digested for 16–20 h at 4°C, compared to 1 h at 37°C (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3D). It is important to note that this is different from our routinely used lung digestion protocol which employs Liberase TM and DNase for 45 min at 37°C. We opted to not to include a red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer, as we observed it to decrease cell viability. However, all of our staining procedures included intracellular protein detection using fixation and permeabilization reagents that lyse RBCs. As such, removal of RBC was ensured.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/766-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Single cell suspensions of melanomas were prepared using distinct enzymatic treatments and cell viabilities were determined by flow cytometric analysis.\n(A) Collagenase D, (B) Collagenase P, (C) Collagenase IV at 30°C for 1 h, (D) Liberase TM\nEuthanize 4-HT treated mice using approved institutional guidelines, typically through 5% isoflurane and carbon dioxide asphyxiation and confirmation of death by cervical dislocation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/766-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Skin and melanoma harvest\n(A) Euthanize mice according to institutional guidelines, typically by sedation with 5% Isoflurane, followed by asphyxiation and physical confirmation of death by cervical dislocation.\n(B) Shave fur from tumor sites and peripheral area.\n(C) Harvest tumors using scissors and forceps.\n(D) Place tumors in cold PBS.\n(E) Place tumors in 10cm dishes on ice.\n(F) Cut tumors into strips.\n(G) Cut strips into 1–2 mm2 squares.\n(H) Place tumors squares into a 6-well plate and add 5 mL digestion media.",
    "(I) Place plate containing tumor squares on a rocker in a cold room and incubate for 16–20 h.\n(J) Place tumors and digestion media through a 70μM cell strainer.\n(K) A 3 mL or 5 mL syringe plunger is used to mash the tumor on the strainer and wash the strainer twice with DMEM containing 5% FBS.\n(L) Filter the tumor and media through a 50μM cell strainer, wash, and count cells with Trypan Blue and a hemocytometer.\nShave off any hair from the tumor and peripheral area (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B)\nUsing a pair of scissors and forceps, cut the tumor around the periphery, minimizing the amount of non-tumor bearing skin (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C)\nNote: The tumour bearing skin will typically separate from the body easily. If not, place the scissors under the tumour and open the scissors repeatedly to separate the tumour from the body by removing the connective tissue\nHarvest the tumor bearing skin and weigh it\nPlace the tumor in a 50 mL conical tube containing FACS buffer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1])\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_766_1.csv\nStore at 4°C for up to 1 month.\nPlace tube on ice and work on the next mouse\nPlace tumor on a 100 mm dish on ice (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E)\nUsing a single-use blade, cut the tumor into small strips (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F)\nFrom the strips, cut the tumor into approximately 1–2 mm2 squares (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G)\nCritical: We have tried mincing the tissues with scissors to form a paste but determined that this results in a great reduction in cell viability. Instead, we established that cutting tissues into strips and squares yields a cell preparation with significantly increased viability.\nPlace the cut tumor in a 6-well plate with 5 mL tumor digestion media (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H) (Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3])\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_766_2.csv\nStore at 4°C for up to 1 month.",
    "table:files/protocols_protocol_766_3.csv\nStore at 4°C for up to 1 month\nPlace the 6-well plate on a rocker in a cold room for 16–20 h (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I)\nThe following morning transfer the contents of each well to an individual 50 mL conical tube overlaid with a 70 μM cell strainer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J)\nAdd 2 mL DMEM with 10% FBS to the wells to collect any remaining single cells and transfer to the same cell strainer (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2])\nUse a 5 mL syringe plunger to further crush the tissue pieces on the 70 μM strainer, 3 times (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K)\nRinse the cell strainer with 5 mL DMEM plus 10% FBS between each tissue crush\nPlace the 50 mL conical tube in an ice box while working on the next samples\nOnce all samples have been processed as in steps 12–15, place the 50 mL tubes in a centrifuge and spin at 450 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 5 mL DMEM with 10% FBS\nTransfer the resuspended contents to a 15 mL conical tube containing a 50 μM cell strainer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]L)\nPlace the tubes in a centrifuge and spin at 450 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL DMEM with 10% FBS\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue\nCritical: We have observed cell viability between 60%–70% with our protocol. Having said that, we may occasionally observe viability between 40%–50% and we still acquired data from those samples. However, we do not recommend staining samples with viabilities lower than 40% viability, as we have experienced difficulties identifying rare cell populations such as ILC2s.\nCharacterization of ILC2 cells over the time course of melanoma progression\nTiming: 5 h",
    "After acquiring the single cells from the digested tumor, ILC2s are characterized by flow cytometry using specific markers to the receptors and transcription factors that they express such as CD45, ST2/IL-33R, CD127/IL-7Rα, and GATA3. In addition, ILC2s do not express lineage-specific markers such as TCRβ, TCRγ/δ, Gr-1 (myeloid differentiation marker), NK1.1 (marker of NK cells), FcεR1 (high affinity IgE receptor) and B220/CD45R (marker of B cells), and thus these are useful to discriminate between lineage-positive and lineage-negative populations. To effectively distinguish the various populations, Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls, isotype controls and an unstained control are used for proper gating. The titrations listed below are optimized for our institute’s flow cytometer (BD LSRFortessa) and further titration may be required for your institute’s flow cytometer.\nNote: 1- Titration of antibodies will be required to determine optimal antibody dilutions for your institute’s flow cytometer. 2- ∗NK1.1 is used only when immune phenotyping tissue from C57BL/6 mice, while CD49b/DX5 is used for BALB/c mice.\nPrepare antibody lineage cocktail in FACS buffer\nAdd ILC2 extracellular surface antibodies to the cocktail\nPrepare the GATA3 antibody dilution in FACS buffer in a separate tube for intracellular staining\nAliquot 2–4 million cells per sample per well in a 96-well plate for staining with the ILC2 extracellular surface antibody cocktail\nNote: Remaining cells from samples once allocated for ILC2 staining can be used for FMO and unstained controls\nNote: 2 sets of cells per sample are required for test and isotype controls\nWash cells with cold 1× DPBS to remove DMEM at 450 g at 4°C for 5 min.\nDecant the supernatant in a quick downward motion\nIn the dark, add 50 μL of 1/2000 viability dye to each well, except to the unstained control well.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice in the dark",

    "Critical: We optimized our staining panel according to the available fluorophores. If your lab or institute is in a region where it may be difficult to purchase the indicated markers with the above-mentioned fluorophores, we recommend using different fluorophores and adjust and optimize accordingly.\nCritical: If your institute’s flow cytometer has an UV laser, we recommend using BUV-conjugated antibodies (e.g.,: Mouse Anti-GATA3 BUV395, BD #565448) and titrate accordingly.\nCritical: For endpoint tumors (Day 40), we typically harvest at least 20 million cells. While 2–4 million cells are recommended for the staining, for the Day 14 immune phenotyped samples, no measurable tumor has yet formed. Thus, it is primarily pigmented skin and low cell numbers are recovered. We have added 200,000 cells for our staining and have acquired between 100,000 and 150,000 events via FACSDiva. The end-users of this protocol can pool the skin samples should they wish to stain an increased number of cells.\nCharacterization of T cells and myeloid cells over the time course of melanoma progression\nTiming: 5 h",
    "After acquiring the single cells from the digested tumor, T-cells and myeloid cells are characterized by flow cytometry using specific markers to the receptors and transcription factors that they express, such as CD45, CD3ε, CD11b, CD11c, F4/80 and FOXP3. In this panel we identify: CD3+ cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, regulatory T-cells (Tregs), monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and granulocytic-MDSCs (G-MDSCs), non-lymphoid tissue dendritic cells, myeloid dendritic cells, and macrophages. To effectively distinguish the various populations, Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls, isotype controls and an unstained control are used for proper gating. This protocol applies to C57BL/6 mice, but as already specified in Major Step 2, it can be applied to BALB/c mice with one modification: instead of using the NK1.1 antibody, the CD49b/DX5 antibody is instead used for staining immune cells from BALB/c mice (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]). The titrations listed below are optimized for our institute’s flow cytometer (BD LSRFortessa) and further titration may be required for your institute’s flow cytometer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_766_4.csv\nLineage markers are included as these provide a lineage-negative population to discriminate ILC2s.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_766_5.csv\n(Note: Titration of antibodies required to determine an optimal dilution for your institute’s flow cytometer)\nCritical: We optimized our staining panel according to the available fluorophores.

    "Critical: As ILC2s are a rare cell population, we acquire all the stained cells in the tube and do not set a pre-determined number of events to acquire. We then normalize to CD45+ cells, or as an absolute number of cells from the total cell count, tissue weight, and total cells acquired via FACSDiva.\nCritical: Depending on the timepoint following 4-HT induction of melanomagenesis, we have a variable range of ILC2s acquired. For Day 7, our range is approximately 10,000–40,000 ILC2s per 1 million CD45+ cells, while at Day 14 it is approximately 3,000–60,000 ILC2s per 1 million CD45+ cells, and at Day 40 it is from 4,000–15,000 ILC2s per 1 million CD45+ cells."
