    "Human liver cancer tissue was collected from patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University. All patients signed an informed consent form, and the collection of human tissue samples was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University. See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, equipment, and software used in this protocol.\n1. Preparation\nPlace the transference decoloring shaker in the incubator and set the temperature at 37 °C. See Figure 1 for all the other needed equipment.\nClean the scalpel and forceps by spraying them with 75% alcohol.\nPrepare the digestive solution by measuring 6 mg of collagenase D (4 mg/mL) and 24 µL of DNase Ι (80 U/mL) and adding them to 1.5 mL of RPMI-1640 basic medium. Mix by gentle inversion until the additives are completely dissolved.\nIn advance, moisten 70 µm and 0.22 µm cell strainers with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nPlace a 100 mm sterile cell culture dish on the icebox to hold the liver tissues after defrosting.\nWithin 15 min after hepatocellular carcinoma tissue isolation, rinse off the blood on the surface of the tissue block with PBS, transfer the tissue into a sterile frozen tube, and store it at −80 °C until the experiment for not more than 2 weeks.\n2. Tissue dissociation\nRemove the tissue sample from the −80 °C freezer and place approximately 400 mg of the tissue-cut into 2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm fragments-into the 10 cm cell culture dish on the icebox.",
    "Move the tissue into a 6-well plate with 1.5 mL of the digestive solution; then, place the plate on the transference decoloring shaker (20 rpm/min) to incubate for 20 min at 37 °C for complete dissociation of the liver cancer tissue and release of the sEVs.\nRemove the 6-well plate from the incubator and place it on the icebox. Add 80 µL of phosphatase inhibitor and 200 µL of complete protease inhibitor solution to stop the digestion.\nTransfer the digestive solution to the 70 µm cell strainer and filter it slowly to remove any large tissue debris. Collect the filtrate and place it in a 2 mL centrifuge tube.\n3. Differential ultracentrifugation\nNOTE: Perform all the centrifugation steps at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 500 × g for 10 min and collect the supernatant in a new 2 mL centrifuge tube. Most of the small tissue debris can then be removed.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 3,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new centrifuge tube until the tip of the pipette is about to touch the white substance on the surface.\nCentrifuge the remaining liquid at 3,000 × g for 3 min; then, aspirate the supernatant to facilitate the collection of vesicles. To ensure the purity of the sEVs, make sure that the white substance is not aspirated.\nCentrifuge the collected supernatant at 12,000 × g for 20 min and transfer 900 µL of the supernatant to a 4.7 mL ultracentrifuge tube. Centrifuge the remaining liquid at 12,000 × g for 3 min and then collect and mix both supernatants into the same ultracentrifuge tube. Fill the tube completely with PBS.",
    "Centrifuge the supernatants at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet by filling the ultracentrifuge tube with PBS and centrifuging again at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Resuspend the pellet with 50 µL of PBS.\nAspirate the sEV suspension using a 1 mL sterile syringe and filter it through a 0.22 µm membrane filter. Collect the filtrate in a 600 µL centrifuge tube and store it at −80 °C for further analysis.\n4. Evaluation of enrichment quality\nObserve the morphology of the sEVs under a transmission electron microscope.\n\t\nThen, drop 10 µL of the sEV sample onto a copper net, incubate at room temperature for 10 min, and clean it with sterile distilled water, using absorbent paper to remove excess liquid.\nDrop 10 µL of 2% uranyl acetate onto the copper net for negative staining for 1 min. Use filter paper to absorb the liquid on the surface of the copper net and dry it for 2 min under an incandescent lamp.\nObserve the copper mesh under a transmission electron microscope and image at 80 kV.\nUse a nanoparticle flow cytometer to determine the size distribution and purity of the sEVs.\n\t\nBefore the machine is started, prepare tubes containing 200 µL of quality control, 200 µL of silica nanospheres, 2 x 200 µL of ultrapure water, 2 x 200 µL of cleaning solution, and 200 µL of PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Before testing the sEV samples, it is necessary to carry out quality control on the instrument and test the particle size standard (the size distribution must be calculated using standard curves generated with several nanomicrospheres of different diameters [68-155 nm] under the same detection condition). QC beads and silica nanospheres were diluted 100x with ultrapure water in a total volume of 200 µL.",
    "Check the volume of the cleaning solution (>10 mL) and note the difference between the levels of the sheath liquid and the waste liquid (20-30 cm).\nTurn off the main power supply of the instrument; after 20 s, turn on the computer and wait for the beeps indicating that the instrument is properly connected to run the software.\nClick on Start Up to turn on the camera, laser, and air pump.\nClick on Sheath Flow-Start Up, and place ultrapure water on the loading platform. After 4 min (instrument's countdown), click on Sample-Boosting | Sample-Unload.\nAfter 30 s, place the blank tube on the loading platform and click on Sample-Boosting | Sample-Unload. Then, place the tube holding the ultrapure water on the loading platform, and, simultaneously, click on Sample-Boosting | Sheath Flow-Purge.\nClick on Manual Operation and place the particle concentration tube on the loading platform. Then, click on Sample-Boosting for 1 min and simultaneously select 250 nm Std FL SiNPs quality control in \"SAMP.

Use ultrapure water to remove residual cleaning solution from the capillary tip.\nCheck the sample information as described earlier in steps 4.2.17-4.2.20; change the PBS (step 4.2.17) to the sEV sample and analyze the data.\nFurther identify the sEVs by western blot.\n\t\nDetermine the protein concentrations of the sEVs and tissues by using the BCA protein quantification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Calculate the loading volume of sEVs (e.g., for 5 µg of protein per well) based on these quantitative results. Add loading buffer in a 1:4 ratio and vortex the mixture.\nAfter denaturation in a 100 °C metal bath (dry thermostat) for 10 min, separate the protein on a 12% polyacrylamide gel at 60 V for 80 min.\nTransfer the gel onto a 0.22 µm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 220 mA for 2 h using transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol).\nBlock the membrane with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubate with primary antibody (rabbit monoclonal anti-human CD9 antibody, rabbit monoclonal anti-human CD63 antibody, rabbit monoclonal anti-human TSG101 antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-human GM130 antibody) overnight at 4 °C. Dilute the primary antibodies in 5% nonfat milk at 1:1,000.\nFollowing three washes with TBST, incubate the membrane with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h.\nDetect the HRP-linked antibody using ECL blotting substrate, and then collect and analyze the images.\nSubscription Required.
