  "title": "Lumican Extraction from Amniotic Membrane and Determination of its Storage Temperature",
  "procedures": [
    "All the experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board (Project No. CEI-2020/06/04). The AM was obtained from the Instituto de Oftalmologia Conde de Valenciana amnion bank (from deidentified human subjects), which is prepared as described by Chávez-García et al.17.\n1. Preparation of the amniotic membrane extract\nObtain 100 mg of AM from the amnion bank.\n\tNOTE: According to a previous report, 50 mg of AM secretes a total of 10 ng/mL of lumican14. To obtain a higher concentration of lumican, use 100 mg of AM, equivalent to a total area of 32 cm2.\nIf the AM is frozen, thaw it at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Perform the following procedures under a laminar flow hood class II B.\nWash the AM in a Petri dish with 10 mL of sterile balanced salt solution (BSS, see Table of Materials) for 2 min.\n\t\nPour the BSS into a beaker.\nRepeat step 3 and visually confirm that glycerol medium is not present in Petri dish BSS.\n\t\tNOTE: Repeat step 3. as needed until glycerol medium is not present in Petri dish BSS.\nIncubate the AM with 10 mL of dispase II (1.7 IU/mL, see Table of Materials) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Dispase II is a neutral protease with gentle activity over epithelial cells. This enzyme effectively separates the intact epidermis from the dermis and isolates intact epithelial sheets18.\nAfter dispase incubation, perform a mechanical de-epithelialization14 with a rubber policeman (see Table of Materials). Confirm de-epithelialization by microscopy visualization.\n\tNOTE: The process of de-epithelization is corroborated in an inverted microscope using 4x and 20x objectives. Visualize the tissue to exclude the presence of any cellular layer.\nWash the AM in a Petri dish with 10 mL of BSS for 2 min. Pour the BSS into a beaker.",
    "Place the de-epithelialized AM (dAM) in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Immerse the dAM in liquid nitrogen for 40 min.\nManually ground the frozen dAM for 2-3 min in a precooled mortar at -85 °C until a fine powder is obtained.\nIn the mortar, solubilize the dAM powder with 2.5 mL of protease inhibitor solution (BSS with protease inhibitors).\n\t​NOTE: Every tablet of protease inhibitor consists of the following mixture of enzymes: pancreas extract (0.02 mg/mL), thermolysin (metalloprotease) (0.0005 mg/mL), chymotrypsin (0.002 mg/mL), trypsin (0.02 mg/mL), and papain (0.33 mg/mL) (see Table of Materials).\nCollect the mixture with a micropipette, and clean the mortar walls with the help of a scalpel knife. Place the mixture in a 5 mL tube.\nMix well with the vortex for 30 s.\nHomogenize the tissue mixture by centrifuging at 34 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and immediately centrifuge at 3360 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nThe supernatant collected is the AME (Figure 1). Store 0.7 mL of each AME in different 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes for 6, 12, 20, and 33 days at the different temperature conditions of -20 °C, 4 °C, and room temperature (RT).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64460/64460fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Process of AME preparation and lumican concentration measurement. 100 mg of AM were incubated with dispase II at 37 °C for 30 min and mechanically de-epithelialized. The de-epithelialized AM was washed and immersed in liquid nitrogen for 40 min, and then crushed until a fine powder was obtained, which was solubilized with 2.5 mL of saline buffer with protease inhibitors and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and RT for 6, 12, 20, and 32 days until total protein and lumican quantitation.

    "2. AME protein quantification\nNOTE: The quantification of total protein in the AME must be carried out immediately after obtention. Quantify proteins using Lowry protein assay and follow the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials). It is recommended that all standards and samples be assayed in triplicate.\nPipette 40 µL of each sample of AME into a 96-well microplate.\n\t\nPrepare a standard curve into the same microplate using bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard for a final BSA concentration of 0-1,500 µg/mL (0, 1, 5, 25, 125, 250, 500, 750, 1,000 and 1,500 µg/mL).\nPipette 200 µL of the modified Lowry reagent to each well. Immediately mix it on a plate mixer for 30 s.\nCover the microplate with aluminum foil and incubate it at RT for 10 min.\nPipette 20 µL of 1x Folin-Ciocalteu reagent to each well. Immediately mix it on a plate mixer for 30 s.\n\tNOTE: To prepare 1x Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, dilute 2x (2N) reagent 1:1 with ultrapure water. Prepare 1x Folin-Ciocalteu reagent on the same day of use as the diluted reagent is unstable.\nCover the microplate from light with aluminum foil and incubate it at RT for 30 min.\nMeasure the absorbance of samples at 660 nm in an ELISA plate spectrometer (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Color can be measured at wavelengths between 650 nm and 750 nm.\nAverage the 660 nm absorbance value of the standard blank samples and subtract it from other 660 nm values of standard and unknown samples.\n\t\nMeasure the absorbance with an ELISA plate spectrometer in an endpoint mode with low shaking for 10 s.\nUse the standard curve to determine the protein concentration of each unknown sample.",
    "For the calculation of protein, determine the concentration from a lineal regression graph using the values of absorbance on the Y axis against the concentrations in mg/mL on the X axis of each standard BSA curve.\n\t\nObtain the equation of linear regression and r value to calculate the protein concentration.\n\t\t​NOTE: Results are expressed as normalized relative concentration values of total protein relative to mg of AM (µg/mL protein/mg AM tissue).\n3. Quantification of Lumican in AME\nNOTE: The concentration of lumican must be measured in the AME stored at different storage conditions and time periods. Quantify lumican using sandwich ELISA and follow the manufacturer's instructions. It is recommended that all standards and samples be assayed in duplicate.\nDilute the human lumican capture antibody (see Table of Materials) to the employed concentration in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: The capture antibody vial contains 120 µg of antibody. After reconstitution with 0.5 mL of PBS, dilute the capture antibody at a working solution of 2 µg/mL.\n\t\nInstantly pipette 100 µL per well of the diluted capture antibody to a 96-well microplate. Enclose the plate and incubate it overnight at RT.\nAspirate each well and wash it by pipetting with 300 µL of wash buffer: 0.05% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate 20 in PBS, pH 7.2-7.4 (see Table of Materials) using a multi-channel pipettor. Repeat three times.\n\tNOTE: After the last wash, remove any remaining wash buffer by everting the plate and gently tap it against paper towels.\nBlock plates by adding 300 µL of reagent diluent: 1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.2-7.4, 0.2 µm filtered (see Table of Materials) to each well. Incubate at RT for 1 h.\nRepeat step 2.",
    "Prepare a standard curve into a 96-well microplate using two-fold serial dilutions from 0-8,000 pg/mL for final concentrations of 125, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 and 8,000 pg/mL. The ELISA lumican kit contains a recombinant lumican standard of 75 ng (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 100 µL of samples and the standard curve in the capture antibody-coated 96-well microplate.\nCover the microplate and incubate for 2 h at RT with low agitation in a compact rocker maintaining the velocity between 2-3 rpm.\nRepeat step 2.\nAdd 100 µL of the biotinylated-detection antibody (see Table of Materials) to each well. Cover from light and incubate 2 h at RT with low agitation in a compact rocker maintaining the velocity between 2-3 rpm.\n\tNOTE: The biotinylated-detection antibody vial contains 24 µg of antibody. After reconstitution with 1.0 mL of reagent diluent, dilute the biotinylated-detection antibody at a working solution of 400 ng/mL.\nRepeat step 2.\nAdd 100 µL of the working dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP, see Table of Materials) to each well. Cover the microplate from light and incubate for 20 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: The reactive streptavidin-HRP was 40-fold concentrated. The work solution 1x of streptavidin- HRP was made with reagent diluent.\n\tNOTE: Avoid placing the plate in direct light.\nRepeat step 2.\nFinally, add 100 µL of substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, see Table of Materials) solution to each well.\n\tNOTE: Prepare TMB solution with an equal volume of stabilized hydrogen peroxide 30% solution provided in the kit.\n\tNOTE: Prepare the solution immediately before use and maintain it at room temperature.\nIncubate for 30 min at RT in a dark place.\n\tNOTE: Avoid placing the plate in direct light. Do not aspirate the TMB solution as no further washing is needed.",
    "Add 50 µL of 1N H2SO4 stop solution to stop the colorimetric reaction. Gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.\nImmediately determine the absorbance of each well using a microplate reader set to 450 nm in an ELISA plate spectrometer.\nMeasure the absorbance with an ELISA plate spectrometer in an endpoint mode with low shaking for 10 s.\nAverage the 450 nm absorbance value of the standard blank samples and subtract it from other 450 nm values of standard and unknown samples.\nUse the standard curve to determine the lumican concentration of each unknown sample.\nFor the calculation of lumican concentration, make a lineal regression graph using the values of absorbance on the Y axis against the concentrations in pg/mL on the X axis of each standard lumican curve.\n\t\nObtain the equation of linear regression and r value to calculate the lumican concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of lumican was normalized with respect to the mg of tissue extracted. Results are expressed as normalized relative concentration values of lumican to mg AM (ng/mL lumican/mg AM tissue).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
