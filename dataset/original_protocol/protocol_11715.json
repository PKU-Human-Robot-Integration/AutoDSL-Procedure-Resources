    "Experiments were approved by the Monash Animal Ethics Committee under animal ethics number 19143. Animals were housed in specific pathogen-free animal house conditions at the animal facility (Monash Animal Research Platform) in strict accordance with ethical guidelines.\n1. Preimplantation mouse embryo collection\nSuperovulate and mate mice as described previously16,18, in compliance with the institutional animal ethics guidelines.\n\tNOTE: The most commonly used strains for live embryo collection are C57BL/6 or FVB/N mice. All data shown here were generated using FVB/N mice.\nOn the morning after mating, flush zygotes from the oviduct using M2 medium as described20, or Human Tubal Fluid (HTF) medium. Using a mouth pipette apparatus as described21,22, transfer zygotes to fresh Potassium Simplex Optimised Medium (KSOM) droplets, prewarmed to 37 °C and equilibrated to 5% CO2, in a 35 mm culture dish overlaid with a sufficient volume of mineral oil to ensure media coverage.\nMicroinject zygotes as described20 with cRNA encoding for a red fluorescently-tagged microtubule plus end marker. Here, cRNA for the End Binding protein 3 (EB3)-dTomato was used at 30 ng/µL concentration after preparing and purifying as described16,18 and diluting in microinjection buffer.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to prepare cRNA ahead of time and store it at -20 °C until required.\nCulture embryos in dark at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until embryos have reached the desired developmental stage for PST-1P treatment.\n\tNOTE: For a comprehensive resource of the culture times required for different embryonic stages see23. For 16-cell stage embryos used here, culture to embryonic day 3 (E3) post-fertilization.\n2. Drug and imaging dish preparation\nNOTE: For Steps 2.1-2.10, work exclusively in the dark or red-light conditions to avoid unintended PST-1P activation. Aluminum foil or dark covers should be used for all tubes and dishes containing PSTs.",
    "Prepare a stock concentration of 50 mM PST-1P in ultrapure water.\n\tNOTE: The molecular weight of PST-1P is 440 g/mol. The stock solution is stable at -20 °C for up to 1 year. PST-1P is soluble in water or aqueous buffer but does not readily dissolve in DMSO.\nFrom step 2.1, prepare an intermediate working concentration of 800 µM PST-1P in ultrapure water.\nDilute PST-1P to a final concentration of 40 µM in fresh KSOM. As a typical experiment requires approximately 20 µL of PST-1P-treated KSOM, dilute 1 µL of 800 µM PST-1P in 19 µL of KSOM for a final volume of 20 µL to ensure sufficient medium is prepared in advance, using only red light for visibility.\n\tNOTE: Both the concentration and the activation status of a PST-1P dilution can be checked by taking a UV-Vis absorbance spectrum using a spectrophotometer which should be done during assay establishment. The absorbance at 380 nm (A380) of a fully-trans 40 µM dilution in a 1 cm cuvette should be approximately 0.8. Both cis- and trans-forms have the same absorbance at 455 nm (A455). When the ratio of the A380 to the A455 is approximately 9:1, the dilution is inactive (fully trans). When the ratio A380:A455 is 1:2, the dilution is fully activated (fully cis). Intermediate ratios reflect intermediate states of activation.\nTo prepare the chamber slide for live imaging, pipette 10 µL of PST-1P-treated KSOM into the center of one well to form a hemispherical droplet (Figure 1A).\nGently add sufficient mineral oil to cover the droplet, ensuring that it does not disperse the media. This will ensure that the droplet does not evaporate.\nPre-warm and CO2-equilibrate the chamber slide dish in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for a minimum of 3 h or at most, overnight.",
    "At the end of the equilibration period in step 2.6, prepare a 35 mm culture dish with a 10 µL droplet of PST-1P-treated, prewarmed, and equilibrated KSOM as a wash step. Do not overlay with oil.\nTransfer embryos by mouth pipetting into the PST-1P-treated KSOM droplet from step 2.7.\n\tNOTE: Steps 2.7 and 2.8 are recommended for mouth pipetting of embryos but are optional.\nImmediately transfer embryos by mouth pipetting into the center of the PST-1P-treated KSOM droplet in the imaging chamber slide prepared in steps 2.4-2.6 (Figure 1A).\nIncubate embryos at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in PST-1P-treated KSOM in the imaging chamber slide for at least 1 h before imaging. If possible, mount the chamber slide on the microscope inside an environmental chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and in complete darkness to ensure all PST-1Ps are in the inactive trans-configuration and that embryos can sink to the bottom of the dish.\n3. Live imaging and PST-1P photoactivation\nNOTE: Steps 3.1-3.13 are performed on a laser scanning confocal microscope fitted with avalanche photodiode detectors (APDs) and a dark environmental chamber. These instructions refer specifically to the imaging setup using the acquisition software described in the Table of Materials; however, they can also be applied to other confocal microscopy systems.\nPrepare a 63x/1.2 NA water oil immersion objective with the prescribed immersion medium.\nUsing a red light torch to guide positioning, advance the objective to contact the immersion medium. At this stage, avoid using white or brightfield light to find the embryos as this could precociously activate PST-1P.\nUsing the eyepiece and while under red light illumination, locate the edge of the droplet of medium and position the objective directly over this location. This can assist the user to establish orientation and find the focal plane.",
    "Next, through the eyepiece or on software-enabled live-mode scanning, use a red wavelength filter or 561 nm laser to locate the embryos within the droplet.\nUse stage controllers and live-scanning mode to set the start- and end-points for acquiring a z-stack of the whole embryo.\nAdjust the laser power settings (typically, with highly sensitive detectors such as the APDs, a 561 nm laser power of less than 5% is sufficient), digital offset (typically at -0.900) to optimize the appearance of EB3-dTomato comets and minimize background noise, pinhole at 2 µm, pixel resolution of 512 x 512, and pixel dwell time of 3.15 µs.\nAcquire a z-stack of the whole embryo with 1 µm section intervals to assess areas of microtubule growth in the whole organism (Figure 1B).\nUse the 3D z-stack image from step 3.7 to identify regions of interest (ROIs) for EB3-dTomato tracking experiments. Increase the zoom to 3x and draw a rectangular ROI around the specific subcellular area of interest.\nAcquire a time-lapse movie of a single z-plane using the typical values of imaging parameters: 561 nm laser power at 5%, digital offset of -0.900, pixel resolution of 512 x 512, pinhole at 3 µm, pixel dwell time of 3.15 µs, zoom of 3x, time interval of 500 ms.\n\tNOTE: 120 time frames will provide a tracking movie of 1 min and should be sufficient for data analysis. The acquisition can continue for longer, provided that bleaching of the fluorophore is minimal (Figure 1C).\nTo activate PST-1P, switch to a 405 nm laser and acquire another time-lapse movie with the 405 nm laser set to 10% power, pixel resolution of 512 x 512, pinhole opened maximally, pixel dwell time of 3.15 µs, zoom of 3x, time interval of 500 ms, and a total of 20 frames (Figure 1D).",
    "Switch back to 561 nm laser and repeat acquisition as in step 3.9 to confirm the loss of EB3-dTomato comets after activation of PST-1P (Figure 1E). Ensure that this acquisition takes place as soon as possible following activation.\n\tNOTE: Step 3.10 can be performed repetitively for longer inhibition of EB3-dTomato comets. However, embryos must be monitored carefully to avoid any harm caused by UV light.\nTo reverse PST-1P back to its inactive trans-state, engage a 514 nm laser at 10% power. Acquire a time-lapse movie with the 514 nm laser set to 10% power, pixel resolution of 512 x 512, pinhole opened maximally, pixel dwell time of 3.15 µs, zoom of 3x, time interval of 500 ms, and a total of 20 time frames (Figure 1F).\nRepeat step 3.11 to visualize recovery of EB3-dTomato comets (Figure 1G).\n4. Image data analysis\nFor analyzing and quantifying the inhibition of microtubule polymerization by PSTs, use software programs available to researchers to suit their specific needs. Those recommended for use will possess a tracking tool, that can manually or automatically track the movement, direction, and speed of EB3-dTomato comets16,18.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63290/63290fig01.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Schematic representation of PST-1P photoactivation and deactivation in the live 3D preimplantation mouse embryo. All experiments are performed in complete darkness (black background) or only by red light illumination. (A) Live preimplantation mouse embryos expressing EB3-dTomato are cultured to 16-cell stage and then transferred to a droplet of KSOM containing 40 µM PST-1P in an imaging chamber slide. (B) A 3D image of the whole embryo allows the assessment of microtubule growth by visualizing the distribution of EB3-dTomato comets. (C) To start the experiment, EB3-dTomato comets are tracked in a subcellular region using time-lapse imaging. (D) Subsequent PST-1P photoactivation in the same subcellular region using a 405 nm laser results in the loss of EB3-dTomato comets (E). Intensified PST-1P activation can be implemented, if necessary, by sequential 405 nm light illumination. (F-G) To reverse PST-1P back to its inactive state and restore EB3-dTomato comets, a 514 nm laser is applied to the same subcellular region. If required, multiple rounds of photoactivation and deactivation can be performed.
