    "Case Presentation:\nThe patient is a 60 year old male with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He has developed progressive heart failure symptoms over the past 10 years with recent multiple readmissions for decompensated heart failure. He was started on chronic IV milrinone and was listed for heart transplantation. His PMH is notable for atrial arrhythmias s/p ablation, recurrent pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, left atrial thrombus, and prior stroke. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing demonstrated a low maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max 10.6 ml/kg min). Imaging was notable for severe LV hypertrophy with moderate to severely reduced systolic function, and no LV outflow tract obstruction (LVEF 25-30%, LVIDd 5.0 cm, IVSd 1.5 cm, LVPWd 1.5 cm). He had a large left atrial thrombus in the appendage and a possible LV thrombus as well. Hemodynamics (on milrinone 0.5 mcg/kg/min) were notable for: RA 17 mmHg, PCWP 37 mmHg, PA 74/35 mmHg, and Fick CI 1.4 L/min/m2. Due to his restrictive myopathy and small LV cavity, he was considered to be a poor candidate for isolated left ventricular assist device.\n1. The Device\nThe Syncardia total artificial heart is the only FDA approved TAH in clinical use. It was first introduced in 1982 as the Jarvik-7 heart.\nThe device consists of 2 polyurethane ventricle chambers. Each chamber has a maximum stroke volume of ~ 70 ml. Each chamber has 2 tilting disc valves (Medtronic Hall, 27 mm inflow, 25 mm outflow) to direct blood inflow and outflow. Each chamber is pneumatically driven by a separate driveline connected to a driver externally (Figure 1).\n2. Indications",
    "The device displaces a total volume of ~400 ml. General minimum recipient size recommendation include a BSA > 1.7 m2 and a thoracic diameter (AP dimension spine to sternum at the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra) > 10 cm (Figure 2). Placement in smaller patients is possible by displacing the device into the left chest although this increases the risk for left sided pulmonary vein and bronchus compression. A smaller sized device for use in smaller patients is being developed and is expected in the near future.\nTAH support is indicated in patients with late stage severe biventricular failure or other anatomic abnormality that is not optimally treated with isolated left ventricular mechanical support. Such patients often present in extremis with complications related to their malperfusion. Typically patients are classified as INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) profile 1 (critical cardiogenic shock) or 2 (progressive decline on inotropic support).\nPatients with significant concomitant cardiac pathology. Critically ill patients with end stage heart failure requiring mechanical support may not be optimally treated by the addition of other extensive reparative procedures. This may increase the risk for right ventricular failure post LVAD implantation, which increases the risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. This includes: acute myocardial infarction with ventricular septal defect; aortic root aneurysm / dissection, cardiac allograft failure, massive ventricular thrombus, refractory malignant arrhythmias (independent of filling pressures), hypertrophic / restrictive cardiomyopathy, and complex congenital heart disease.\n3. Preparation of the Device\nThe Dacron aortic and pulmonary grafts are sealed with CoSeal Surgical Sealant (Figure 3).\nThe grafts and devices are soaked in rifampin.\n4. Implantation\nRoutine preparation and median sternotomy. The chest and abdomen are prepped in the routine fashion for cardiac surgery and a median sternotomy is performed.",
    "Division of the left diaphragm and creation of a left upper abdominal preperitoneal pocket. Similar to the implant of an LVAD, the left diaphragm is divided medially and a left upper abdominal preperitoneal pocket is created for the pneumatic drivelines. Two incisions ~5-10 cm below the left costal margin are made and carried through the rectus fascia. Intramuscular tunnels for the pneumatic drivelines are created and maintained with two 1\" Penrose drains.\nCannulation and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aorta, SVC, and IVC are cannulated. Bicaval cannulation is performed through the atria (vs direct cannulation of the SVC/IVC) to preserve the sites for use during subsequent transplantation. Unnecessary dissection within the pericardium is minimized to preserve tissue planes.\nThe aorta is cross clamped. The aortic root and pulmonary artery are divided at the level of the valvar commissures. Excision of the right ventricle is started along the acute margin, 1-2 cm distal to and parallel to the right atrioventricular groove. The interventricular septum is incised opening the left ventricle. The right ventricular incision is continued superiorly into the RV outflow tract. Similarly, the left ventricle incision is extended laterally parallel to the left atrioventricular groove. The LV outflow tract is opened laterally. The remaining interventricular septum is divided and specimen is removed (Figure 4).\nThe coronary sinus is oversewn. If a PFO is identified it is similarly oversewn. The left atrial appendage is ligated with a non cutting endoscopic stapler to eliminate a potential source of thrombus (Figures 5 and 6).",
    "The mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets are excised leaving a several millimeter cuff to the annulus. The ventricular cuffs are trimmed leaving a 1 cm rim of tissue. The cuffs are then oversewn with 2-0 Prolene (MH) for hemostasis and to downsize the orifice to the size of the TAH atrial quick connects. Some centers elect to use a reinforcing strip of felt.\nThe cuffs of the TAH atrial quick connects are trimmed to 0.5-1 cm. The cuffs are then inverted and sewn to their respective left and right ventricular cuffs.\nIn a similar fashion, the aortic and pulmonary artery graft quick connects are trimmed. The pulmonic graft is left several centimeters longer than the aortic graft to allow room for the aortic graft to pass below. The grafts are sewn to their respective orifices (Figure 7).\nAt the time of subsequent re-entry for transplantation, an intense inflammatory response of the pericardium is often seen. Dissection through this tissue at the time of transplantation can be associated with significant blood loss. This appears to be greater than what is typically seen during redo sternotomy. Preclude pericardial membrane is used to line the pericardium and maintain avascular tissue planes. This is started along the left inferolateral pericardium as access to this space will be hindered once the device is in place. Strips of Preclude are also placed around the aortic and pulmonic anastomoses. Some centers use sterilized rubber tourniquets to wrap the anastomoses.",
    "The drivelines are passed through the previously created tunnels. A 13-15 mm Hegar dilator is used to guide the driveline through the previously placed Penrose drain. A sheet of Preclude membrane is wrapped around the drivelines as well. The original metal connectors of the external console driveline are replaced with plastic connectors that will also connect with the portable discharge driver.\nDe-airing nipples on the TAH left and right ventricles are ligated. The left and then right artificial ventricles are flushed and then connected to their respective orifices. The pliable quick connects are grasped with 2 heavy needle drivers and stretched over the hard plastic connectors of the artificial ventricles ensuring a tight connection (Figure 8).\nAn aortic root vent is placed. Low rate, low pressure pumping is initiated (Left drive pressure 40, right drive pressure 0, % systole 40, rate 40, vacuum 0) and the lungs are ventilated for de-airing. Flow through the right side is initially passive.\nThe cross clamp is removed. Once adequate de-airing is confirmed by TEE, cardiopulmonary bypass can be discontinued relatively quickly. TAH support is increased. Typical initial immediate TAH parameters are: Left drive pressure 180-200 mmHg, right drive pressure 30-60 mmHg, HR 100-120 bpm, and % systole 50. Vacuum is generally left at 0 until the chest is closed (or sealed) to prevent entrainment of air. Once sealed, increases in vacuum (generally to 15 mmHg) will result in increased fill volume and increased cardiac output. Parameters are then titrated for partial ventricular filling and complete ejection.",
    "Protamine is given and the CPB cannulas are removed. Patients requiring a TAH often present with significant end organ dysfunction including chronic hepatic congestion and may have significant associated underlying coagulopathy. The most common complication following TAH implantation is bleeding. We recommend a low threshold for mediastinal packing and delayed sternal closure.\nOnce the chest is ready to be closed, the remainder of the pericardium along the right and superiorly is lined with Preclude. The configuration of the TAH does not maintain the normal oblong shape. Contraction of the pericardium about the device will limit the space available for subsequent transplantation. A saline breast implant is used to maintain the apical pericardial space for subsequent transplant. A smooth saline breast implant is placed at the apex and filled with 200-250 ml of saline (Figure 9).\nThe chest is closed in the routine fashion. Although imgagin by intraoperative TEE is limited, it remains a useful tool at the end of surgery to assess for compression of the right and left atrial venous return by the device during closure. This is more common on the right (both the cava and right sided pulmonary veins) and can generally be treated with displacement of the device inferiorly and to the left. This can be secured with a heavy suture placed around the costal margin and tied to the artificial right ventricle. A strip of silastic is left beneath the sternum to protect the pump during re-entry for transplantation."
