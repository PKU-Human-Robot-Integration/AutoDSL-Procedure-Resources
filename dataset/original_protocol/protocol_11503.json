    "Ethics statement: All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n1. Prepare Cancer Cells for Injection\nSeed the cancer cells one or two days before injection. Use DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS, unless a specialty medium is indicated in literature for a particular cell line.\nOn the day of surgical operation, harvest cells when they reach 70 - 80% confluence by first washing with serum-free media once before trypsinization (0.25%) for 1 - 2 min at 37 °C. Add into cells 10% FBS-containing DMEM/F12 media to quench the 0.25% trypsin.\nCentrifuge the cells at 80 × g for 3 min. Wash cells in serum-free media twice to remove residual serum, count the cells with a hemocytometer and re-suspend in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) at 1 - 5 × 106 cells/ml, depending on the cell line. Keep on ice until time of injection.\n\tNOTE: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and K1735 melanoma cells were used in this study, and both cell lines were used at 2 × 106 cells/ml concentration. Keep the trypsinization duration as short as possible as overtreatment may influence the outcomes of metastasis assays.\n2. Prepare Mice for Tumor Cell Injection\nAnesthetize mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail (ketamine 100 mg/kg, xylazine 10 mg/kg).\nConfirm complete anesthesia by pinching the animal feet and observe lack of response.\nPlace the mouse on a glass plate (used for casting protein gels), and secure with rubber bands.\nIf necessary, remove the hair of neck by shaving or applying a small amount of hair removal product and wiping the hair off with paper towel. NOTE: If using nude mice, skip this step as they do not have body hair.",
    "Clean the neck skin by applying povidone-iodine and 70% alcohol.\nPlace mouse on stage of the dissecting microscope\nMake an incision in the skin ~ 1 cm long with a surgical scalpel.\nBluntly dissect the muscle with toothed forceps to expose the carotid artery underneath.\nSeparate the carotid artery from the adjacent vagus nerve with surgical forceps.\nUsing surgical forceps, separate some cotton from a cotton ball, moisten, and fashion into a smaller cotton ball. Place this buffer-moisturized cotton ball underneath the carotid artery of intended site of injection.\nPlace a suture distal and proximal to the cotton ball and make loose knots. Tighten the proximal knot to block the blood flow into the injection site.\nProceed to cancer cell injection if the carotid artery on the cotton ball appears fully pressurized with fresh red blood.\n3. Cancer Cell Injection into Carotid Artery\nVortex and draw 100 µl of cancer cells into the syringe.\nUnder the dissecting microscope, slowly insert the 31 G needle (with bevel up) into the lumen of the carotid artery sitting on top of the cotton ball.\nSlowly inject the cells from the syringe into the carotid artery. Successful injection can be observed under the microscope by the changing color of nearby blood vessels and musculature when buffered cancer cells are pushed into the circulation.\nWhen injection of the entire volume is complete, lift the distal carotid artery gently to prevent regurgitation.\nQuickly tighten the distal knot to complete the injection process.\nAfter completing the injection, tighten the ligatures and trim the excess silk suture with micro-scissors under the dissecting microscope. Move back the separated muscle to cover the wound site. Close the skin with two staples.\n4. Surgical Recovery",
    "Move the operated animal onto a heating pad for recovery. It may take 30 - 60 min for the animals to regain consciousness. In the meantime, administer buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection as post-surgical analgesia.  Note: Analgesia should be provided according to your local IACUC approved protocol. \nOnce the animals awaken and resume their normal behavior, return the mice to their housing location. Provide mice with gel food for several days post-surgery. Maintain a surgical record and keep it in the room.\n5. Non-invasive In Vivo Imaging\nFor cells labelled with luciferase reporter constructs, measure cancer cell injection efficiency using in vivo imaging system14.\n\tNOTE: Imaging is not performed on the day of injection to avoid excessive stress to research animals.\nSubscription Required.
