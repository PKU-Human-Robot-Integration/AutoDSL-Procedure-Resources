    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for the list of materials and equipment and Table 1 for the list of solutions to be used in this protocol.\n1. Preparation of plants for glass bottom dishes\nGrow the moss protonemal tissue in BCDAT agar medium in a 13 cm Petri dish under constant white light (~50 µmol m-2s-1) for 7 days at 25 °C in the growth chamber.\nFilter-sterilize the calcofluor white and store at 4 °C until use. The reagent is stable for several months.\nDisperse the 7-day-old moss tissue into a 1.5 mL microtube containing 20 µL of sterilized water. Ensure the moss protonemal tissue is sufficiently dispersed as small pieces in the water. For wild type (WT), use forceps to separate the protonemata; for the ggb mutant, use a P-1000 pipette.\nAdd 10 µL of the sterilized calcofluor white into the 1.5 mL microtube and leave the microtube upright in the hood for 2 min for staining.\nImmediately after staining, mix the plants with 200 µL of cooled BCDATG, containing BCDAT medium supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 0.4% (w/v) gellan gum, by pipetting five times with a P-1000 pipette.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the BCDATG medium is cooled enough (just before the medium solidifies) to avoid stressing the plants.\nTransfer the mixture containing the plants and the BCDATG medium into a 27 mm diameter glass base dish. Ensure that the volume of BCDATG for mixing the cells is no more than 200 µL and that the 200 µL of BCDATG with samples is evenly distributed on the surface of the 7 mm glass bottom dish to produce a thin layer of film, so that the samples are within the objective working distance during imaging.",
    "After solidifying for 2 min at room temperature, cover the thin layer with 3 mL of cooled BCDATG and let it set for 10 min to solidify again.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that steps 1.2-1.5 are conducted in a sterile hood to avoid contamination.\nOn the bottom of the dish, draw nine lines each in parallel and perpendicular directions (Figure 2). Mark the rows with characters from a to h, and mark the columns with numbers from 1 to 8. Use upper, lower, right, middle, and left to mark the positions within each square. For example, if a plant is in a square in the second row and the sixth column and is positioned in the upper left part of the square, then this plant is given the name of \"b6_upper_left\".\nPreculture the glass bottom dish containing the plants under red light for 5 days at 25 °C in the growth chamber, and then under white light for 1-2 days before being subjected to time-lapse imaging every day for up to 3 days. For WT, preculture the plants in weak red light (0.5 µmol m-2s-1) from the above for 5 days to induce the phototropic response of the protonemata, so that the plants can attach to the bottom of the dishes11.\n\tNOTE: The weak red light is provided by passing a white light through a 3 mm thick red acrylic plastic filter into light-proof boxes. For ggb mutants, preculturing in red light is optional, as the ggb mutants do not have a phototropic response3.\n2. Imaging and 3-D reconstruction",
    "Place the glass bottom dish containing plants onto the stage of an inverted confocal microscope, with the glass bottom facing the objective. Use a confocal microscope for the visualization of calcofluor with a 20x objective lens. Take images with the 405 nm laser, the pinhole at 1.0, HV-gain at 100, offset-background adjustment at 0, Laser Power at 5%-7%, a scan size of 1,024 x 1,024, and a scan speed of 1/2 frame/s. Collect 17-30 z-series optical sections with a step size of 1.0 µm. Name the images using the code in step 1.6, such as \"b6_upper_left-day0\", and save.\n\t\nSelect the DAPI channel in Acquisition and check the Z box in ND Acquisition. To set the lower and upper limits for the Z-stack, click the Top and Bottom buttons.\nTo reconstruct the 3-D images, open the .nd2 file (Figure 3A; see Table of Materials) and click the Volume (Figure 3B).\n3. Imaging the same plants at different time points\nAfter each imaging, put the glass base dish back into the growth chamber.\nRepeat from step 2.1 for imaging and 3-D reconstruction.\n\tNOTE: To find the same plants, use the code mentioned in step 1.6 and give the name \"b6_upper_left-day1\", or \"b6_upper_left-day2\", according to the age of plants.\nSubscription Required.
