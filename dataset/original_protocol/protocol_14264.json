    "All experiments described were approved by the Alfred Medical Research Education Precinct Animal Ethics Committee (AMREP AEC) and mice were provided humane care in line with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia Guidelines on Animal experimentation. Animals were administered their prescribed diet and water ad libitum and housed in a temperature-controlled environment (~21 - 22 °C) with a 12 h light and 12 h-dark cycle. Seven week old male mice (on a C57Bl/6J background) were fed either regular normal chow diet (energy content 14.3 MJ/kg, consisting of 76% of kJ from carbohydrate, 5% fat, 19% protein; see Table of Materials) or for the high fat-feeding group, a high fat diet (HFD) (energy content 19 MJ/kg, consisting of 36% of kJ from carbohydrate, 43% fat, 21% protein, Specialty Feeds) for 3 weeks. Body weight and body composition measurements using an EchoMRI machine were made weekly while the metabolic monitoring analysis took place in a CLAMS after 3 weeks of the diet.\n1. Body Composition Analyzer Procedure\nNote: To function optimally, the EchoMRI 4-in-1 used in this protocol should be contained within a room where the air temperature is stable and does not fluctuate. Ideally this should be constantly monitored. Moving of the machine and interruptions to power should also be avoided if possible. If the power supply has been interrupted and the system has to be restarted, allow at least 2 - 3 h for the machine to warm up before using it again. Before starting, ensure that you are wearing correct personal protective equipment.",
    "Prior to scanning mice, perform a system test on the body composition analyzer machine. This involves using a calibration standard (referred to as a canola oil system test sample (COSTS)) to test the precision of the instrument and to ensure there has been no drift in its accuracy.\n\t\nOpen the system software, then click the System Test toolbar button or pressing \"Alt + Y\" simultaneously.\nBefore the system test is carried out by the computer, wait for a reminder to verify that the correct COSTS (in this case the mouse-specific COSTS) has been placed inside the gantry of the system ( Figure 1). Once confirmed that this is indeed the case, accept to proceed with the test, which will take few minutes to complete.\nOnce the system test has been passed, continue forward with scanning.\n\t\nIf the system test fails, repeat the system test.\nIf the machine continues to be out of range (indicating a deviation has occurred), calibration may be necessary to rectify the situation. Complete this by following the prompts or as described in the user manual provided at time of purchase. If the problem persists, check the manual3 or report the issue to the manufacturer's support team and seek further instruction.\nPlace the mice in a small animal specimen holder (long cylinder) to keep them contained while in the machine. To do this, place the holder horizontally, pick up the mouse and insert it into the opening of the cylinder head first. Slowly and carefully bring the holder to the vertical position so that the mouse is at the bottom of the cylinder and ready for analysis.",
    "Once within the holder, insert a delimiter to limit the movement of the mouse during the measurement period. In some circumstances, with extremely active mice, it may be necessary to hold the delimiter in place with your fingertip.\n\tNOTE: Familiarize the mice with placement in the specimen holders prior to their initial analysis to reduce stress. The use of a red colored animal specimen holder can also reduce the potential stress response, as the mice feel that they are in the dark.\nWithin the software, select a folder (folder toolbar) to save the data to and create a file name.\nIf necessary, reduce the amount of random noise in the fat and lean measurements by increasing the number of primary accumulations of the scan. Once the software is initiated, the primary accumulations is set to a recommended default value for general everyday use; unless there is a specific reason to change these parameters, the default settings will give the necessary level of precision to users.\nIf not interested in obtaining data for free water and total water, turn off the water stage by selecting the tab to say no. Doing so will reduce the scan duration significantly and improve throughput.\nInitiate the scan by selecting \"start scan\" or by pressing F5 on the keyboard. Enter all relevant data about the animal (e.g., animal ID, body mass, etc.) and press \"ok\" or F5 to commence the scan, which will take approximately 1 min.\nAfter data have been obtained, remove the animal holder containing the mouse from the machine and place the animal back in its cage. Once all animals have been scanned, export the data for further analysis and collation.",
    "Before and after use, thoroughly clean the animal holders as per the instructions of the manufacturer. As these holders are constructed from acrylic plastic, isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol should be avoided as they can cause cracking of the holders and/or rapid deterioration of the holder, thereby increasing the likelihood of breakage. Instead, either use warm dishwashing water solution, or, if further disinfectant is required, use F10 (at a 1:125 dilution) or other disinfectant or cleaning sprays (see Table of Materials) and then wipe off.\n2. Metabolic Animal Monitoring System Procedure\nNOTE: The system requires ~2 h to warm up and stabilize. If the machine has been turned off, it must be switched on to allow the Zirconia cell to be heated to 725 °C. Also we generally place mice in the body composition analyzer a day prior to entering the animal monitoring system to avoid any issues with restraint stress.\nEnsure the computer attached to the animal monitoring system is turned on and open the control program. Select the \"Oxymax Utility\" option from the tool menu to initiate the pumps.\nFill water bottles with appropriate water, weigh and inspect the health of the mice, and organize food. If measuring food intake in the system, consider powdering the food. Fill the food hoppers by depressing the spring-loaded platform and tip food into the hopper. Ensure that the food hopper and water bottle are completely full to ensure that there is enough food and water to last the allotted experimental time.\nCheck the status of the drierite/desiccant; if using a color indicator, it should be blue and therefore dry, but if it is pink/purple, it has had significant moisture absorbance and should be replaced or topped up.",
    "Check the condition of the ammonia trap and soda lime and replace if required. If the ammonia trap is connected two at a time, when the second trap displays signs of a color change, replace the first one. An increase in the CO2 offset can also signify the need to replace the soda lime.\n\tNOTE: Desiccant can be dried in an oven and reused, however we follow the recommendations from the manufacturer of the system to use fresh each time.\nAssemble the chambers. To do this, place the food hopper on the balance, then place the chamber on top with the perforated platform that becomes the floor of the chamber inserted. Carefully place the mouse in the chamber and attach the lid of the system with the front and back clips and secure before positioning the water bottle and fastening. As a precaution, re-check all chamber lids, mice, and water (Figure 2A-D).\n\tNOTE: Depending on the size of the mice being examined, it may be necessary to adjust the height of the spaces above the food hopper so that the mice have access to the food but not enough space that they can sleep directly on top of the feeder.\nAs it is recommended that the gas sensors be calibrated before each experiment, calibrate the system.\n\t\nUse a gas of known composition (0.5% CO2, 20.5% O2, balance nitrogen). Connect the calibration gas tank to the system via a regulator and hose. Turn on and ensure the tank output pressure is reading 5 - 10 psi.\n\t\tNote: Some systems will have a second tank, hose and regulator for use of pure Nitrogen as an \"offset\" gas. The system we operate instead utilizes soda lime to generate CO2 free air.",
    "Follow procedures to calibrate both the O2 and CO2 sensors. Select \"calibration\" from the tools menu and sequentially calibrate both the O2 and CO2. Before calibrating ensure that 1) sample and reference flows are 0.400LPM, 2) the Zirconia O2 sensor temperature is 725 °C (± 1 °C), 3) the sample and reference drier and air pumps are on, and 4) the calibration gas is attached and turned on.\nIf necessary, when calibrating the O2 sensor, slightly adjust the offset control on the front of the zirconia oxygen sensor to achieve an O2 ratio value of 1.0000 (± 0.0002). This is to ensure it is within acceptable limits (highlighted in green font in the software display on the computer screen).\nAfter successful O2 and CO2 sensor calibration, turn off the calibration gas cylinder and disconnect the hose from the regulator. After calibration, O2 for reference air (atmospheric) should read 20.92 (± 00.02). If calibration is out of tolerance, repeat, and refer to trouble shooting guides from the manufacturer. Failing this, contact the manufacturer for further instructions.\nProceed with experimental set-up. Select \"experimental file open\" from the experiment menu. Select the appropriate template (e.g., mouse). Under \"setup\" in the experiment menu define the parameters of the experiment that should be recorded (e.g., mouse ID, weight, group, etc.) De-select any chambers not in use and select the location for the experiment to be saved.\nEnsure the scales have been tared if measuring food intake and start the capturing of data by selecting \"run\" in the experiment menu. Data is captured for different lengths of time depending on the phenotype, institutional guidelines on animal isolation, and system usage.",
    "NOTE: In our hands, the experiment is routinely run for 48 h, with the first 24 h used as acclimatisation to the new environment and the second 24 h used for data analysis. The data collection period is based on how long the investigator wishes to keep their mice singly housed and dependent on animal ethics approval. Alternatively, if provisions exist, mice may be acclimatised in the chambers prior to being placed into the system and connected. Each chamber is measured approximately once every 13 min when a 12 chamber system is in use.\nRegularly check and monitor the results that are obtained while the mice are in the system to ensure animal welfare and that appropriate data is being collected. Any issue may be able to be identified at this stage and rectified. Check on each mouse every morning and evening when they are in the system.\nCheck the metabolic tab at the top of the data file page for the data collected in real time for each mouse in regards to the oxygen consumption, RER, and energy expenditure. Meanwhile, beam breaks and food consumption data can be located in the activity and feeding tabs, respectively. Check that the \"O2 In\" is reading around 20.90 - 20.94, the \"CO2 In\" is around 0.040 - 0.050, the RER is between 0.7 and 1, and the flow rate is constant at 0.5 - 0.6 L/min.\nAt regular intervals, check that the mice have access to food and water and that they are consuming each. Ensure they are not demonstrating any signs of distress such as digging at the perforated flooring. Also, monitor the results which are displayed.",
    "At the completion of the allocated experimental time, select \"stop\" from the experiment menu and export the results (as CSV files, File>Export>Generate Subject CSV's) for analysis.\nInspect the health of the mice, weigh them and then return to their home cages.\n\t\nMice may be hostile towards each other after separation, so monitor once they are housed together again.\nDisassemble the cages, remove excess food from hoppers, and tip out any feces, urine, and food from the cages. Submerge bottles and sippers in diluted T-bac solution, soak, and clean the other components in diluted bleach solution. Rinse with clean water and leave to air dry.\nCalculate metabolic parameters with the software. The software utilizes a number of equations to provide the final data output4.\n\tFor calculation of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production: Oxygen consumption: VO2 (LPM)= ViO2i - VoO2o; Carbon dioxide production: VCO2 (LPM)=VoCO2o-ViCO2i\n\tWhere: Vi = the input ventilation rate (LPM), Vo = the output ventilation rate (LPM), O2i = the O2 concentration at input, O2o = the O2 concentration at output, CO2i = the CO2 concentration at input, CO2o = the CO2 concentration at output.\nFor calculation of RER: RER = VCO2 / VO2. Note that protein oxidation was not measured and therefore the RER was not adjusted for this.\nFor calculation of energy expenditure: Energy Expenditure: CV = 3.815 + 1.232* RER\n\tHeat (Kcal/h)) = CV * VO2. Where: CV is the calorific value (the relationship between heat and the volume of oxygen consumption). This is derived from \"The Elements of the Science of Nutrition\" referred to as the Lusk Table, comprised by Graham Lusk.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
