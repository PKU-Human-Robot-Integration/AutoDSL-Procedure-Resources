    "Sample collection and preparationAortic valve tissues that would otherwise be discarded should be aseptically removed from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement by a cardiac surgery specialist. Immediately after surgery, tissues should be placed in a sterile specimen container, kept on ice and immediately taken to the laboratory for processing.Tissue preparationIn a biosafety cabinet, open the vial containing the heart tissue and assess the level of calcification, inflammation and damage prior to further processing. Ideally, valve sections should be obtained from smooth areas with no calcification, signs of inflammation or residual blood (Figure 1). With a biopsy punch, press firmly on the selected areas of the tissue to cut through and remove the section from the rest of the tissues (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531183238_3261.jpgFigure 1. Selection of tissue from aortic valve tissues. After primary tissues are obtained, they should be immediately taken to the laboratory for evaluation and preparation. Only areas with no signs of calcification or inflammation are selected for sectioning with a 3 mm biopsy punch.Use sterile forceps to collect the section and place it in individual wells of a 12-well plate containing 1 ml of supplemented EGM + gentamicin 300 µg ml-1.The number of sections that can be effectively obtained depends on the quality and the size of the tissue as well as on the type of experiment to be performed (see below).Incubate the 12-well plate containing the valve sections at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight (18-20 h).Bacterial attachment to aortic valve tissuesOn the same day of valve tissue processing, grow overnight bacterial cultures in triplicate. To grow S. mutans OMZ175, add 2 ml of BHI in a 4 ml sterile culture tube and inoculate by picking a single isolated colony from a freshly streaked plate.",
    "Incubate cultures at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight (18-20 h) without aeration.On the following day, wash the valve sections twice at room temperature with HBSS buffer to remove residual antibiotics. For this, add 1 ml of HBSS into two clean empty wells of the same plate and transfer the sections using sterile tweezers. Gently rock plate containing valve sections for 5 min and set the rocker to a setting of 40-50 motions per minute for each wash step.In the meantime, centrifuge the overnight cultures at 3,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, wash twice with sterile PBS and resuspend cultures with the initial culture volume. For each strain replicate, add 2.7 ml of fresh EGM without antibiotics to a clean 4 ml sterile culture tube and 300 µl of the bacterial culture making a 1:10 dilution of the bacterial suspension (approximately 1 x 107 CFU ml-1). Transfer washed valve sections to a new 12-well plate and add 1 ml of the bacterial suspension in EGM. In addition, take 100 µl of each replicate for serial dilution and plating of the initial culture CFU (T0).Incubate plate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with gentle rocking for 90 min.After incubation, transfer each valve section into a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of HBSS and then vortex at medium intensity for 5 sec. This process should be performed three times in order to remove loosely bound bacteria.After washing, place each valve section in a 4 ml sterile culture tube containing 500 µl of PBS and homogenize the tissue for 2 min with a motorized pestle to detach tightly adhered bacteria.",
    "Take 100 µl aliquot from the homogenized valve suspension for serial dilution and plating of the final culture on BHI medium plates to determine the CFU (TF).Incubate inoculated plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 48 h, count colonies for CFU determination.Tissue preparation for analysis of adhesion by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)To visualize bacterial adhesion to heart valve sections by SEM, follow the inoculation protocol described above (steps 3a-3g). After incubation of tissue with bacteria, transfer each valve section into a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of HBSS and then vortex at medium intensity for 5 sec once. Note: It is important not to perform too many washes at this stage as the SEM sample preparation includes several washing steps.Upon washing, transfer the valve section to a labeled glass scintillation vial containing 15 ml of fixative solution.After the sample is fixed at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 48 h, it is ready for SEM analysis.Competition analysis of bacterial attachmentOn the same day of valve tissue processing, grow overnight bacterial cultures in triplicate. Unlike monoculture inoculations, this protocol requires marked strains so that they can be distinguished in CFU determination.For this study, S. mutans OMZ175 containing an erythromycin resistance cassette (ErmR) and S. mutans OMZ175 with the collagen binding protein gene (cnm) interrupted by a kanamycin resistance cassette (KanR) were used. To grow bacterial cultures, add 2 ml of BHI + Erm 10 µg ml-1 or BHI + Kan 1 mg ml-1 in a 4 ml sterile culture tube and inoculate by picking colonies from freshly streaked plates. Incubate cultures at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight (18-20 h) without aeration.On the following day, wash the valve sections twice at room temperature with HBSS buffer to remove residual antibiotics.",

Transfer washed valve sections to a new 12-well plate and add 500 µl of the S. mutans OMZ175 (ErmR) and 500 µl of the S. mutans ∆cnm (KanR) bacterial suspensions in EGM. In addition, take 100 µl of each mixed bacterial replicate for serial dilution and plating of the initial culture CFU (T0).Incubate the inoculated valve sections at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with gentle rocking for 90 min.After incubation, transfer each valve section into a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of HBSS and then vortex at medium intensity for 5 sec.

    "Take 100 µl aliquot from the homogenized valve suspension for serial dilution and plating of the final culture on both BHI + Erm 10 µg ml-1 and BHI + Kan 1 mg ml-1 plates to determine the CFU (TF).Incubate inoculated plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 48 h, count colonies for CFU determination."
