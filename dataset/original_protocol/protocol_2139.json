    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMeasurement of intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi)\nTiming: 2 days\nNMR technology is one of the main techniques to study living cells under physiological conditions without causing damage to the organism and is suitable for studying life phenomena closer to physiological states. The 31P-NMR technique proved to be feasible to detect Pi concentrations in vivo in the plant (Roby et al., 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Bligny et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Wang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Xu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). In this step, rice seedling samples are well-adapted and packed into 5 mm NMR tubes and cytoplasmic and vacuolar specific Pi peaks are dissected by the perfusion system on a Bruker Ascend 600 NMR spectrometer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1723-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Scheme of perfusion system exampled as rice root or leaf samples\nTransfer the 2-week-old seedling growing in the nutrition solution into perfusion solution, and soak the root of testing samples (about 5 seedlings) for 1 h to adapt to the perfusion solution.\nPreparation of perfusion system:\nAdd D2O into two 0.5 mm capillaries, and pack MDP solution into a 0.3 mm capillary, respectively (see below).\nSeal both ends of the three capillaries (place one end of the capillary tube at a 45° angle on the edge of the fire generated by the alcohol lamp, keep rotating while heating the tube, and complete the seal when both ends are closed) and then place them into a 5 mm NMR tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPack roots or leaves (about 50 mg fresh weight) from 2-week-old seedlings into the 5 mm NMR tube and connected it to a peristaltic pump by two polytetrafluoroethylene tubes, followed by adding perfusion solution (Aubert et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Stefanovic et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCritical: The samples should not exceed one-third of the height of the NMR tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
    "CAUTION: The strong magnetic field of NMR can suddenly pull nearby unrestrained magnetic objects into the magnet with considerable force. The analyzer should keep all tools, equipments and personal items containing ferromagnetic material (e.g., steel, iron) at least 2 metres away from the magnet. In particular, keep the peristaltic pump outside of 5-gauss lines (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), and do not use metal seats in the operating room.\nSetting the parameters in NMR Spectrometer:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1723_7.csv\nTest the samples according to the above parameter setting, with a run time of about 2 h. Record the in vivo 31P-NMR spectra on the Bruker Ascend 600 NMR spectrometer and measure the chemical shifts (δ) relative to the signal from a glass capillary containing 10 mM MDP solution.\nNote: Set the phosphate peak at 0 ppm by 85% H3PO4 determination, and the standard MDP peak will occur at 18.9 ppm using same parameters. In this way, different Pi components in the testing sample can be discriminated by their relative positions to MDP peak based on the previous report (Quiquampoix et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nAssign specific peaks to cytoplasmic and vacuolar Pi pools following the methods given previously (Roby et al., 1987[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Bligny et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: The 31P-NMR method is used to detect not only the phosphate concentration in plants but also distinguish the metabolic pools of phosphate in different organelles of cells (such as Vac-Pi, Cyt-Pi) in vivo.\nDetermination of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in different tissues\nTiming: 3 days\nThe ammonium vanadate molybdate method has been widely used to detect Pi content, which is suitable for a variety of plant tissues, including both dry and fresh samples. In this step, we sample different rice tissues and extract the Pi crudes for chromogenic reaction.\nPreparation of testing samples.",
    "Sample different tissues directly from the mature plants in the field. For dry samples preparation, dry the tissues (root, leaf, stem, seed, etc.) at 65°C in an oven for 48 h and then grind them into powders directly by Tissue Lyser at or below 25°C. For fresh samples, snap-freeze the tissues in liquid nitrogen, grind them into powders rapidly by Tissue Lyser and proceed with subsequent testing immediately.\nPlace 50 mg of each powdered samples into separate 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes.\nOptional: In the case of a high-throughput assay, the samples can be transferred to a 96-well plate for rapid determination.\nExtraction of Pi crudes.\nResuspend each 50-mg sample in 1 mL phosphate extraction buffer, followed by shaking the extraction mixture on a Multipurpose Shaker (20 g) at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nCentrifuge the extraction mixture at 4°C (10,000 g, 15 min), then collect the supernatant (500 μL) and load it into new 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes to produce the Pi extraction crudes.\nPause point: Pi extraction crudes can be stored at 4°C for several days.\nPreparation of Pi standard solution and standard curve.\nTake the appropriate amount (2 g) of KH2PO4 into a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask, and dry it in 105°C temperature in an oven for 1 h (Keep the mouth of the flask open).\nAfter cooling, use an analytical balance to accurately weigh 0.2195 g powder and dissolve it in diH2O in a 1 L volumetric flask. Then, add 3 mL of 70% HNO3, and make up the volume with diH2O to 1 L to generate the Pi standard solution (50 μg/mL).",
    "Transfer exactly 0.0 mL, 1.0 mL, 2.0 mL, 4.0 mL, 8.0 mL and 16.0 mL Pi standard solution to the 50 mL centrifuge tubes (polypropylene with scale) to make 0 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 2 μg/mL, 4 μg/mL, 8 μg/mL, 16 μg/mL gradients, respectively.\nAdd 10 mL ammonium vanadate molybdate developer solution into each above tube, and dilute the solution up to 50 mL with diH2O. Fasten the cap securely and mix by inversion and let stand for more than 10 min.\nSet the 0 μg/mL Pi standard solution as the blanking control, and measure the OD400 values of various Pi standard solutions by spectrophotometer or microplate reader. Draw the standard curve with Pi concentration as abscissa and OD400 absorbance as ordinate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nChromogenic reaction and data collection.\nDilute the Pi extraction crudes in step 8 five times with diH2O, and mix the diluted crudes and the ammonium vanadate molybdate developer solution in a 5:1 ratio to 300 μL volume.\nRecord the OD400 values in the microplate reader after 10 min rest.\nCalculate the Pi concentration of each sample based on OD400 value and Pi standard curve and further process it into Pi content per unit weight based on the total buffer volume and sample weight.\nOptional: In case of low-Pi concentration samples, the ammonium vanadate molybdate developer could be substituted as the ammonium molybdate-ascorbic developer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) which contains H2SO4, ammonium molybdate and ascorbic acid.\nCritical: The recording of OD400 for all samples should be finished within 1 h since the ammonium vanadate molybdate developer undergoes photo-decomposition, and the mixture must be protected from light damage by packing the containers with tinfoil.\nDetermination of total phosphorus (P) of different tissues\nTiming: 3 days",
    "The total P levels are measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, NexION 350D, PerkinElmer). This method is widely used in detecting P content and other elements, and even for genetic screens in plants (Gong et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Zhao et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). In this step, we sample different rice tissues and digest the sample for ICP-MS analysis.\nPreparation of plant samples.\nRinse the plant samples from the field with diH2O 3–4 times to remove impurities.\nPrepare powdered samples following step 7.\nDry the powdered samples in an oven at 65°C for 24 h, and weigh 50 mg powder each into Pyrex test tubes (16 × 100 mm) or Round Bottom High Clarity PP Test tube (14 mL).\nSamples digestion.\nAdd 1 mL 70% HNO3 to each sample tube.\nDigest the samples completely in a block heater (DigiPREP MS, SCP Science; Essex, UK) or Microwave 3000 (Anton PAAR, Graz, Austria) at 115°C for 5 h.\nNote: Sample tube caps should be loosened or removed during digestion.\nAlternatives: If there is no block heater or Microwave 3000 available, the sample digestion can be performed by placing the samples tubes in boiling water for 4–5 h.\nDilute the digested samples with diH2O to a final volume of 14 mL.\nDetect the total P signal by ICP-MS (NexION 350D; PerkinElmer, USA) coupled with an Apex desolvation system and an SC-4 DX autosampler (Elemental Scientific Inc., USA).\nFinally, calculate the total P concentration based on the signal value of the P standards.",
    "Optional: Other elements, such as Li, B, Na, Mg, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, and Cd can be detected as well in the presence of standards. In the case of a high-throughput assay, it is not necessary to weigh each sample, and part of the samples are accurately weighed to calculate the weights of the rest samples (WeightUnknown= (SignalUnknown/ConcentrationKnown) × dilution factor), and all samples are normalized with a heuristic algorithm using the best-measured elements as reported (Lahner et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nμXRF element fluorescence imaging\nTiming: 2 days\nμXRF element fluorescence spectrometer (M4 TORNADO) is the preferred device for element characterization using small spot micro area X-ray fluorescence. The measurement can provide information about the composition and element distribution of the sample, especially for the element distribution under the surface of the sample. It is widely used to detect P distribution in plant samples as reported (Dong et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Ma et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In this step, we prepare rice tissues with flatten surface and generate the visualization of P fluorescence intensity using μXRF spectrometer.\nPreparation of image samples.\nFor mature samples, cut the plant tissues (seed, kernel, husk, etc.) smoothly with a single side razor, and then dry the samples at 37°C in oven for 24 h.\nFor fresh samples, embed the plant tissues in 5% agarose rapidly to prevent water loss and proceed with testing immediately.\nPut the samples carefully on the Sample Chamber of the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (M4 Tornado, Bruker. Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2E).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1723-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematics for the μXRF element fluorescence assay\n(A–C) Images of X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (M4 Tornado, Bruker, A), M4 Sample Chamber (B), and simple working model of key components including X-ray tubes, filters, and samples (C).",
    "(D and E) Maize kernel (D) and rice seeds (E) samples loading on the Sample Chamber.\nCritical: The surface of all samples must be kept on the same plane during these measurements.\nOperate the X-ray generator at 40 kV and 300 μA, and set X-Ray Beam Spot Size smaller than 20 μm for the Molybdenum K-shell X-ray Emission Spectrum (Mo-K). Then observe the P fluorescence under Rh X-ray tube illumination.\nCollect the element distribution images for further analysis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nOptional: Other elements, such as Na, Mg, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Cd, etc. can be analyzed at the same time with the X-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 600 μA."
