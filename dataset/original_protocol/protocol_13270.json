    "All the animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Research Council. 2011. Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition. The animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Boston Children's Hospital.\nPrior to surgery, all the surgical instruments are steam-autoclaved, and modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer, with a final concentration of 22 mmol/L KCl, is prepared as a cardioplegic solution (Table 1). The solution is filter-sterilized and stored at 4 °C overnight. A surgical microscope (12.5x) is required for the heterotopic neonatal rat heart transplantation procedure.\n1. Preparation and anesthesia\nUse male/female Lewis rats with a weight of around 150 g (5-6 weeks of age) as recipients.\nTo start, generously shave the rat's abdomen with a razor.\nPlace the rat into an isoflurane chamber, and turn on the oxygen flow at 2 L/min with 2% isoflurane until the animal is properly sedated but still spontaneously breathing. Inject 45 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine intraperitoneally (IP), as well as 300 U/kg heparin. Confirm proper anesthetization with a toe pinch test.\n\tNOTE: Carefully monitor the spontaneous breathing and heart rate through palpation of the chest to assure a stable hemodynamic status throughout the entire process.\nFor intubation, place the rat on an oblique shelf (Figure 1), secure the front teeth with a string, and place the head facing toward the surgeon.\nPlace the light on the outside of the neck onto the area of the vocal cords, grab the tongue with two fingers, and slightly push it upward and to the left to provide optimal vision for intubation. Use an 18 G, 2 in cannula for a 100-150 g rat. Secure the intratracheal tube with tape.\n\tNOTE: Surgical loups with 3.5x magnification are recommended for intubation.",
    "Connect the intubation cannula to the small animal ventilator, and adjust the settings according to the manufacturer's instructions based on the animal size.\n\tNOTE: Use the following settings for a 150 g rat: volume mode; respiratory rate, 55/min; tidal volume, 1.3 mL 50 % I/E ratio, but this can be adjusted appropriately as needed. Assure proper bilateral and equal chest movement, and administer isoflurane continuously at 0.5%–2% through the ventilator.\nPlace the rat on a heating pad (to maintain normal body temperature) in a supine position with the tail facing toward the surgeon. Sterilize the abdomen three times with betadine solution and 70% of ethanol alternatingly. Administer eye lube, and cover the rat with a sterile surgical drape, leaving the abdomen uncovered.\n2. Surgical preparation and heterotopic transplantation of the neonatal donor heart in the recipient rat\nPerform a midline laparotomy using a 15 blade scalpel for the skin incision, and use scissors to open the anterior abdominal wall, followed by blunt exposure of the retroperitoneal abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) with cotton tip applicators.\nMobilize the intestines (including the descending colon), and place them toward the right upper quadrant. Cover the intestines with warm saline-soaked gauze. Use retractors to ensure optimal exposure of the IVC and abdominal aorta.\nPerform blunt dissection of the infrarenal IVC and abdominal aorta up toward the bifurcation. Ligate all the infrarenal branching arteries and veins (e.g., inferior mesenteric artery and lymph node arteries) with a 10-0 nylon suture.\n\tNOTE: There is great variability in the anatomy of these side branches. Monitor the aorta's pulse and heart rate visually when no other hemodynamic monitoring is available. Assess the proper depth of anesthesia every 15 min through a toe pinch test. Adjust the isoflurane concentration accordingly.",
    "After the donor heart is harvested from a neonatal rat, deliver the excised heart in sterile conditions in a surgical basin containing Krebs-Henseleit buffer to the surgical field. Irrigate the donor heart intermittently with ice-cold cardioplegic solution.\n\tNOTE: When a second surgeon is available, the heart should be prepared at the same time, as a second surgeon reduces the total anesthesia time of the recipient animal and the ischemia time of the donor heart. When a second surgeon is not available, cover the recipient's abdomen with warm saline, and monitor the animal during the harvesting procedure.\nApply four small atraumatic vascular clamps to the distal and proximal segments of the infrarenal aorta and IVC. If needed, temporarily occlude an unfavorable renal vessel with a 7-0 silk suture, and release the suture after the procedure. Place a 10-0 nylon suture vertically onto the anterior wall of the aorta to facilitate the aortotomy. Perform an aortotomy with two small horizontal cuts (wedge-shaped) with microscissors by slightly pulling up the suture.\n\tNOTE: To remove any blood clots, flushing of the aortic lumen with heparinized saline is recommended.\nPlace the donor heart on the left side (from the animal’s perspective) of the aorta and secure the recipient’s infrarenal aorta and the donor’s ascending aorta end-to-side at the 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock positions of the aortotomy with sutures. Continue with the third and fourth sutures at the 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions, gently flipping the heart over to the right side of the aorta after the third suture. Complete the arterial anastomosis by adding one to two sutures to every interspace.\n\tNOTE: Care should be taken to avoid touching either the donor's ascending aorta or the recipient's abdominal aorta with forceps when creating the anastomosis to avoid tissue damage.",
    "Rotate the rat counterclockwise, with the head facing toward the surgeon's left hand. Move the donor's aorta to the left side of the abdominal aorta to allow optimal sight onto the IVC.\nPerform a venotomy on the IVC, slightly proximal to the aortic anastomosis, using an 11 blade for puncture and microscissors for adequate size adjustment according to the diameter of the donor's pulmonary trunk. Again, flush the intracaval lumen with heparinized saline.\nStart with the venous anastomosis between the recipient's IVC and donor's pulmonary trunk, which is best achieved by placing interrupted 11-0 nylon sutures on the back wall of the vessel, starting at the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions (related to the IVC), and then place a continuous 11-0 nylon suture on the front wall (from the 6 o'clock toward the 12 o'clock position).\nCover the anastomoses with small strips of an absorbable gelatin sponge, and remove the microvascular clamps starting distally. Use a cotton tip applicator to lightly compress the sponges to obtain optimal hemostasis.\nObserve the graft's coronary vessels filling at the time of the release of the distal microvascular clamps, and make sure that the donor heart starts beating immediately when the proximal clamp is released.\n\tNOTE: The graft's viability can be scored from 0 to 4 intraoperatively according to a modified Stanford score19 to confirm adequate graft function.\nPlace the intestines back into the abdomen by ensuring not to distort the arterial and venous anastomosis.\nAdminister meloxicam (1mg/kg) and ethiqa XR (0.65 mg/kg) subcutaneously while the animal is fully anesthezised to ascertain postoperative analgesia. Then, close the abdominal wall with a continuous 5-0 absorbable vicryl suture before closing the skin with a 6-0 absorbable vicryl suture intracutaneously.\n\t​NOTE: Guidance regarding common failures and troubleshooting is presented in Table 2.",
    "3. Harvesting of the neonatal donor heart\nPlace the neonatal donor rat in a chamber insufflated with isoflurane (2%) for sedation. Administer ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg), as well as heparin (300 U/kg) intraperitoneally.\nConfirm the depth of anesthesia by toe pinch, and place the rat in a supine position with the tail facing toward you. Sterilize the entire thorax and abdominal wall with betadine and 70% ethanol three times alternatively. Cover the rat with a sterile surgical drape.\nUsing a 12.5x surgical microscope, remove the entire anterior thoracic wall by starting with a horizontal incision using a 15 blade scalpel at the xyphoid followed by vertical incisions laterally up to the axillae on both sides with scissors. The anterior thoracic wall can then be removed by continuing with another horizontal incision right beneath the neck.\nDissect the IVC, right and left superior vena cavae, and pulmonary vessels with scissors, and then encircle and ligate all the vessels with a 7-0 silk suture. Administer 3 mL of ice-cold, high-potassium modified Krebs-Henseleit solution to the right atrium by puncturing the IVC with a 30 G needle and slightly pushing the diaphragm down with forceps.\nCut the IVC, SVCs, pulmonary vessels, and aorta with scissors. Transect the pulmonary arteries as far as possible and the aorta distal to the brachiocephalic trunk to ensure proper length using a 11 blade scalpel.\nSeparate the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta with microscissors, and flush the heart with ice cold cardioplegic solution using a 3 mL syringe.\n4. Recovery of the recipient and graft monitoring\nAfter surgery, give the rat ample time to wake up, which usually occurs in a 15 min time window, and let it recover on a heating pad.",
    "NOTE: No antibiotics are necessary due to the very low risk of infection and in order to not compromise the experimental model, and no restriction to food or water is applied.\nFollowing transplantation, monitor the graft function by palpation of the transplanted heart daily, but consider that this can sometimes be difficult to assess due to intestine overlay.\n\tNOTE: Abdominal echocardiography can more accurately measure the graft viability. For echocardiography, sedate the rat slightly with isoflurane (1-2%) inhaled through a nose cone, and position it on a heating pad. Echocardiography is usually performed on postoperative day (POD) 1, POD 7, and POD 14. To allow for the assessment of the heart rate and contractility, one can easily obtain long-axis and short-axis views (Figure 2A, B). To evaluate the anastomoses, use Doppler echocardiography (Figure 3A), and confirm the formation of EFE tissue as seen as an echo-bright endocardial layer within the left ventricular cavity (Figure 3B, C).\nSubscription Required.
