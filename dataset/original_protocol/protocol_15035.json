    "1. Advance Preparation\nKeep sterile serological pipettes and pipette tips at 4 °C.\nTroubleshooting: Matrigel gels at room temperature (RT); using cold pipettes and tips will prevent Matrigel from gelling during the culture setup.\nThaw a bottle of Matrigel at 4 °C overnight.\n2. Preparation of Reagents\nPreparation of fibronectin stock solution: Make a 1 mg/ml stock solution of fibronectin by dissolving 100 mg human fibronectin in 100 ml of distilled water. Once the fibronectin has dissolved, sterile filter, aliquot, and store at 4 °C for up to 6 months.\nTroubleshooting: If fibronectin doesn't dissolve quickly incubate the solution for a few minutes in a water bath set at 37 °C.\nPreparation of 10x PBS: Dissolve 80 g sodium chloride NaCl, 14.4 g Na2HPO4, 2 g KCl and 2.4 g KH2PO4 in 1 L of distilled water. Set the pH to 7.4, sterile filter, and store at 4 °C for up to 6 months.\nPreparation of neutralization buffer20: Make a solution containing 100 mM HEPES in 2x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using 1 M HEPES and 10x PBS stock solutions. Adjust the pH of the solution to 7.0. Store at 4 °C for 2-3 months.\nPreparation of 2 mg/ml solution of rat tail collagen type I: Make a 2 mg/ml collagen I solution in the neutralization buffer (step 2.3). Vortex the solution at low speed and mix gently by pipetting up and down. As this collagen is very viscous, avoid generation of air bubbles while pipetting. It is recommended to prepare collagen I solution fresh every time. Keep the solution on ice until use.",
    "Preparation of endosteal coating (rEnd): Mix 1 mg/ml fibronectin stock with 2 mg/ml collagen I stock (steps 2.1 and 2.4) to a final concentration of 77 μg/ml and 29 μg/ml respectively, in 1x sterile PBS. Mix and store at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nPreparation of reconstructed bone matrix (rBM):\n\t\nPrecool 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes on ice. Keep all matrix solutions on ice at all times.\nMix 4 parts Matrigel (Matrigel concentration varies from lot-to-lot, but the variations were found to be negligible), 2.5 parts of 1 mg/ml fibronectin and 1 part of 2 mg/ml collagen I on ice by first pipetting Matrigel into the tube using cold pipette tips and then add fibronectin and collagen I. Matrigel will start solidifying at temperatures above 4 °C, so work quickly while pipetting Matrigel. Mix the matrix very gently by pipetting up and down, avoid introducing bubbles. Keep the tubes on ice while mixing the rBM.\nPreparation of bone marrow growth medium (BMGM): Make 500 ml of BMGM containing 6.2 x 10-4 M CaCl2, 10-6 M sodium succinate, 10-6 M hydrocortisone, 20% human plasma (normal or malignant collected from healthy donors or patients), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in RPMI-1640. CaCl2, sodium succinate, and hydrocortisone supplements can be stored at -80 °C for >6 months as 1,000x stock solutions. When growing cell lines, fetal bovine serum (FBS) can be substituted for human plasma.\nPreparation of 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF): Add 37% formaldehyde stock solution to 1x PBS at 10% v/v. Mix well and store at room temperature for 2-3 weeks protected from light.",
    "Preparation of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA): Weigh appropriate amount of BSA and dissolve it in 1x PBS. Store at 4 °C and use within 1 week. BSA solution tends to get contaminated if kept refrigerated for longer periods. Alternatively, BSA solution can be aliquoted and frozen at -20 °C for long-term storage. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nPreparation of cell recovery solution (CRS): Make 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate (Na3VO4) and 1.5 mM sodium fluoride (NaF) solution in 1x PBS. Sterile filter and store at 4 °C up to 6 months.\n3. Embedded 3-D Culture of Nonmalignant and Malignant Human BM Cells\nPurify primary BM mononuclear cells by Ficoll-Plaque gradient centrifugation per manufacturer's instructions.\nOptional step: cells can be labeled with 0.25 μM carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE) per manufacturer's instructions to follow cell proliferation throughout the culture period.\nTroubleshooting: If cells die after CFSE staining, titrate the amount of CFSE as the concentration depends on cell type; 0.25 μM works well for primary BM mononuclear cells.\nAdd 65 μl of rEnd solution into each well of a 48-well tissue culture treated plate. Spread the solution evenly to cover the entire surface of the well and incubate for >30 min at RT.\nPrepare the cell suspension at a density of 0.5 x 106 cells in 10 μl of 1x PBS per well of a 48-well plate. In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube mix the cell suspension with 100 μl of rBM matrix per well. Mix the cells and rBM matrix by gently pipetting up and down; avoid introducing bubbles. Keep the cell/matrix mixture on ice to avoid gelling of the matrix.",
    "Note: the rBM system is fully scalable; to set up the system in a non-48-well format, adjust the amounts of all reagents (matrices and medium) based on the surface area of the plate used. Scale the number of cells to be plated accordingly.\nAspirate the remaining rEnd and add the cell/matrix mixture into the center of a well. Quickly, spread the cell/matrix mixture to cover the entire surface of the well evenly. Place the plate for 30-60 min in 37 °C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator to allow the matrix to solidify. Do not shake or disturb the plate during incubation.\nTroubleshooting: To prevent uneven distribution of cells in rBM, mix well prior to plating. Mix after every 5th well plated to avoid cells settling to the bottom of the tube. Once plated, cells do not sink to the bottom of the well due to surface tension in the matrix.\nTroubleshooting: To prevent uneven distribution of cells in rBM, mix well prior to plating. Mix after every 5th well plated to avoid cells settling to the bottom of the tube. Once plated, cells do not sink to the bottom of the well due to surface tension in the matrix.\nPrewarm BMGM in a water bath set to 37 °C.\nAfter 30 min, check to see that the matrix has set properly; it will form a soft gel like layer that does not move when the plate is tilted. Overlay the cell/matrix layer with 1 ml of warm BMGM. To avoid tearing of the matrix pipette the medium very gently (dispensing drop-by-drop) using a serological pipette. Place the assembled rBM culture into a 37 °C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator and culture for the desired time period.",
    "Note: cell viability is maintained for at least 30 days without changing medium; if medium change is required only change 50% of medium each time.\nCritical step: It is crucial that the medium is not cold as cold temperature might disturb the already set matrix. Take care not to squirt the medium on top of the matrix at it might break the soft matrix layer.\nTroubleshooting: If cell viability in the rBM system is low, cell density may have to be determined experimentally when working with cells other than primary mononuclear cells from BM aspirates. When working with cell lines, decrease the cell number 10-fold, as immortalized cell lines proliferate faster than primary cells.\n4. 'In-matrix' Imaging\nLight microscopy\nImage the cultured cells directly in rBM using bright field, differential interference contrast (DIC), confocal or any other imaging techniques that allow long-distance imaging as the matrix is approximately 1 mm thick. Use the Z-stack feature available on many of the microscopes to image the entire culture from top to bottom.\nImmunofluorescence staining\nTip: For the immunostaining protocol below avoid aspirating staining/washing solutions, instead tilt the plate and remove solutions using a pipette.\n\t\nRemove the BMGM by using a pipette and wash 2-3x with 100 μl/wash/well of RT 1x PBS. Make sure that enough PBS is used to cover the entire surface of the well.\nFix cells in matrix by adding 100 μl/ well (for a 48-well plate) of 10% NBF for 15 min at RT. Remove NBF and wash cells twice with 100 μl/wash/well of RT 1x PBS.\nNote: Avoid using cold NBF as it may liquefy the matrix.\nRemove PBS, add 1% BSA for 1 hr at RT or at 4 °C overnight in order to block nonspecific binding of antibodies.",
    "Prepare primary antibody solution in 1% BSA at the required dilution. Dilution will vary for each antibody, check with the manufacturer or titrate to determine the optimal antibody concentration. Add 100 μl/well of primary antibody solution and incubate according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCritical step: All incubations involving antibodies conjugated to fluorophores or fluorescent dyes should be performed in the dark.\nRemove primary antibody solution and wash 3x with 1x PBS for 5 min.\nFor indirect immunofluorescence staining, incubate with a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescent probe for 1 hr at RT. Dilute the antibodies in 1% BSA at concentration suggested by the manufacturer.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution and wash 3x with 1x PBS for 5 min.\nTroubleshooting: To avoid high background during imaging, titrate the fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies and use the lowest concentration that provides adequate signal. If high background is still an issue, increase the number and the duration of wash steps, or use directly conjugated primary antibodies, and skip step 4.2.6.\nTo stain the nuclei add 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear staining solution, at the dilution suggested by the manufacturer, and incubate for 7-10 min at RT.\nRemove nuclear staining solution and wash 2x with 1x PBS for 5 min.\nRemove the PBS from the last wash and add a drop of mounting medium (regular set), on the sample to preserve fluorescence. Image using appropriate excitation/emission settings on a fluorescent or confocal microscope.\nNote: Imaging should be done within 2 days of staining to avoid degradation of matrix and loss of rBM integrity and loss of fluorescent signal. If not imaged immediately, stained samples should be kept at 4 °C, protected from light, until imaging.\n5. Isolation of Cells from rBM\nRemove medium gently without disturbing the matrix layer. Do not aspirate.",
    "Wash cells 2x with sterile 1x PBS. Do not aspirate.\nAdd 0.5 ml of ice-cold CRS to each well and remove the entire matrix layer along with the cells, by vigorously pipetting up and down. Collect the cells, matrix, and CRS in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Place on ice.\nAdd an additional 0.5 ml CRS to the same well and collect all remaining material. Transfer to the same microcentrifuge tube.\nVortex the mixture of cells, matrix, and CRS and incubate on ice for 1hr. Vortex cells every 15 min to facilitate release from the matrix.\nCheck the mixture after 1 hr, no visible clumps of matrix should be present.\nTroubleshooting: if clumps of matrix are still visible after 1 hr, transfer cells/matrix/CRS mixture to a bigger tube, add additional 2-5 ml of CRS, and incubate for an additional 30-60 min.\nCentrifuge cells in CRS at 1,000 rpm for 5-10 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of cold 1x PBS.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5-10 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat the PBS wash one more time.\nThe second PBS wash completes the recovery of cells from matrix and isolated cells can be used for any downstream applications such as DNA/RNA/protein isolation, flow cytometry, in vivo transplantation, etc.\nSubscription Required.
