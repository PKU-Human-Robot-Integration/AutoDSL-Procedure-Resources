    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol outlined above, starting with hPSCs, is designed to generate hPSC-derived airway epithelial organoids. The following step by step method details the subsequent derivation of iBCs (starting from Day ∼30 of differentiation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A)), including their expansion, cryopreservation, and in vitro differentiation into airway epithelium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/836-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Generation of iBCs\n(A) Schematic of iBC differentiation protocol from BU3-NGPT (top row) or non-reporter iPSCs (bottom row).\n(B and C) Representative expression pattern of GFP and tdTomato via microscopic analysis on Day 29(B) or flow cytometry analysis in single live cells on Day 30(C). The suggested gating for NKX2-1GFP+ and TP63tdTomato+ population is shown with bold line square.\n(D) Immunolabeling of non-reporter iPSCs with antibodies against NKX2-1 and TP63 on day 28 of directed differentiation. DNA is labeled with DAPI; Scale bar = 50 μm. The round arrowhead indicates a NKX2-1 single positive cell, the square arrowhead a TP63 single positive, and the triangle arrowhead a NKX2-1 and TP63 double positive.\nEvaluation of NKX2-1+/TP63+ airway progenitors in hPSC-derived airway epithelial organoids\nTiming: 4 h–2 days\nThis step evaluates how successful is the preparation of hPSC-derived airway epithelial organoids. A visual inspection may be done for BU3-NGPT with fluorescent microscopy imaging (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). To quantify, flow cytometric analysis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) or preparing a cytospin followed by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) should be performed. Cells in one droplet/well should be sufficient for this step. This confirmation can be performed several days prior to the next step. (This step is optional, but recommended)\nDigest Matrigel to release organoids\nRemove media and add 0.5 mL Dispase (1U/mL) per well, dislodge Matrigel droplets mechanically using a pipette tip but without pipetting and incubate at 37°C for 30 min in a humidified incubator.",
    "Pipette Dispase and Matrigel together several times to break Matrigel down until Matrigel is no longer visible by eye and incubate again at 37°C for approximately 30 min to 1 h in a humidified incubator. Confirm under a light microscope that there is no visible Matrigel remaining. If any, incubate an additional 15–30 min.\nDilute with DMEM/F-12 (1 mL or more/well) and transfer to a 15 or 50 mL conical tube and pellet organoids by centrifugation, 200–300 g, 3–5 min. Remove supernatant.\nNote: Before the incubation at step 1a, Matrigel tends to stick to pipette tips. Allowing 30 minutes to incubate with Dispase before pipetting at step 1b. helps to avoid the loss of cells while dislodging the droplets accelerates their degradation.\nDissociate organoids to single cells\nTreat with 1 mL 0.05% trypsin per harvested well. Gently pipette or invert, lay the tube on its side and incubate at 37°C, 5 min.\nGently invert the tube several time to mix and avoid aggregation of cells at the bottom or on the wall of the conical tube, and incubate for another 5 min. Confirm that the majority of clumps are not visible.\nNeutralize trypsin with equal volume of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS. Pellet cells by centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min.\nTreat 1 mL ReLeSR per well to further dissociate the remaining small clumps to single cells at approx. 22°C for 10 min. Occasionally invert to mix.\nDilute ReLeSR with equal or greater volume of DMEM/F-12 and pass cells through a 40 μm cell strainer, and then count.",
    "Critical: Longer incubation in trypsin may be required during step 2.b, up to an additional 5 minutes. However, longer trypsinization causes significant cell death. Small clumps, several cells per aggregate, can be further dissociated by non-enzymatic dissociation reagents, such as ReLeSR, to avoid excess cell damage from enzymatic dissociation. In general, a half million to one million cells per organoid can be expected after the dissociation step.\nPellet cells by centrifuging at 300 g for 5 min. Remove supernatant.\nNote: For BU3-NGPT follow step 4, and for Non reporter iPSC follow step 5.\nBU3-NGPT: Analyze percentage of GFP and tdTomato with flow cytometry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C)\nResuspend in FACS buffer+ live or dead cell dye\nAnalyze with flow cytometry\nNon reporter iPSCs: Analyze percentage of cells expressing NKX2-1 and TP63 by cytospin and immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D)\nSpin down 105 single cells on a charged slide mounted in a cytospin funnel at 100 g for 5 min.\nRemove the funnel and let cells dry for 30 s to 1 min.\nFix the cells on the slide with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min.\nWash the cells three times with PBS.\nPermeabilize the cells with 0.3% triton X in PBS for 15 min.\nBlock the sample with 2% BSA solution at approx. 22°C for 1 h.\nImmunolabel samples with primary antibodies against NKX2-1 (1:500) and TP63 (1:200) in 2% BSA solution approx. 16 h at 4°C or 1 h at approx. 22°C.\nWash three times for 5 min with PBS.\nIncubate samples with secondary antibodies, Alexa488-Donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500) and Alexa555-donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) in 2% BSA solution for 1 h at approx. 22°C in dark.\nWash three times for 5 min with PBS.",
    "Mount with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI, seal with a coverslip and cure for 24 h before imaging.\nQuantify the cells that are NKX2-1 and TP63 positive in their nuclei.\nPause point: PFA-fixed cells on slides can be stored in PBS at 4°C prior to start staining up to one month.\nGeneration of iPSC-derived basal cells (iBCs)\nTiming: 10–14 days\nIn this step, NKX2-1+/TP63+ airway progenitors in hPSC-derived airway epithelial organoids are further matured into iBCs with transcriptional and functional similarity to adult primary airway basal cells, including the expression of the surface receptor Nerve Growth Factor Receptor (NGFR).\n∼Day 30 Follow steps 1 through 3 described above (Evaluation of NKX2-1+/TP63+ airway progenitors in hPSC-derived airway epithelial organoids) to obtain single cells from hPSC-derived airway epithelial organoid.\nNote: For BU3-NGPT follow step 7, 9, 10, 11 and for Non reporter iPSC follow step 8, 9, 10, 11.\nBU3-NGPT: Sort live NKX2-1GFP+ cells that co-express TP63tdTomato+ live cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C)\nNon reporter iPSCs: Skip step 7 and move to step 9. Troubleshooting 3\nRe-plate 20,000 NKX2-1GFP+/TP63tdTomato+ cells in a 25–50 μL Matrigel droplet per well of 12 well plate at 400 - 800 cells per μL of Matrigel. Place the culture plate in a humidified incubator for 10–20 min and then add 1 mL FGF2+10+DCI+Y medium per well.\nOne day after re-plating, change the culture medium to basal cell medium (see Table in Materials and Equipment).\nFeed every 2–3 days and culture ∼9 days or longer in basal cell medium.\nEvaluation, isolation and expansion of iBCs\nTiming: 1 day",
    "This step describes how iBCs, the targeted cell population generated through this protocol, can be evaluated and isolated based on NGFR expression. At this stage, the organoid morphology has evolved with denser appearing spheres (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), while the earlier culture stages contain spheres with thinner, single-cell layer, spheres (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/836-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The suggested gating for NGFR+EpCAM+ iBC population is shown with bold line square.\n∼Day 40 or later Follow steps 1 through 3 to obtain single cells from airway epithelial organoids cultured in basal cell medium\nNote: For BU3-NGPT follow step 13, 15, and for Non reporter iPSC follow step 14, 15.\nBU3-NGPT: Evaluate and sort iBC (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B)\nResuspend single cells in FACS buffer.\nStain cells with NGFR antibody (1:100) (and EpCAM antibody, 1:100) in 50 μL of FACS buffer per 1 million cells for 30 min at 4°C.\nWash and resuspend in FACS buffer+ 10 μM Y-27632 (5 to 10 million cells/mL) + live or dead cell dye\nSort NKX2-1GFP+, TP63tdTomato+, and NGFR+ (and EpCAM+) population to isolate iBC.",
    "Non reporter iPSC: Evaluate and sort iBC (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C)\nResuspend single cells in FACS buffer.\nStain cells with NGFR antibody (1:100) (and EpCAM antibody, 1:100) in 50 μL of FACS buffer per 1 million cells for 30 min at 4°C.\nWash and resuspend into FACS buffer+ 10 μM Y-27632 (5 to 10 million cells/mL) + live or dead cell dye.\nSort NGFR+ (and EpCAM+, Troubleshooting 4) population to isolate iBC. Troubleshooting 5\nRe-plate 20,000 sorted cells in a 25–50 μL Matrigel droplet per well of 12 well plate at 400–800 cells per μL of Matrigel. Place the culture plate in a humidified incubator for 10–20 min and then add 1 mL basal medium per well. Feed every 2–3 days.\nNote: iBCs sorted at step 13 or 14 are ready to use for experiments requiring ALI culture. If necessary iBCs can be expanded by passaging every 10–14 days by following step 15. Some PSC lines such as BU3-NGPT maintain high percentage of iBCs in the culture (>80%) over time, allowing to simply re-plate single cells at every passaging. On the other hands, some PSC lines may require additional NGFR (and EpCAM) sorts (step 14) to enrich for iBCs and remove the secretory and to a lesser extent multiciliated cells that can differentiate from iBCs in this culture format. In particular, a high proportion of NGFR+ iBCs is required for ALI cultures or in vivo Xenograft model and thus NGFR sorting is recommended prior to transitioning to these steps.",
    "Optional: We recommend performing a post-sort analysis of iBCs generated from non-reporter iPSC to check the purity based on NKX2-1 and TP63 co-expression. Perform cytospin and immunofluorescence staining by following step 5 with additional blocking to mask mouse antibodies used for sorting. For this purpose, use MOM (Mouse On Mouse) blocking reagent at the dilution of 2 drops in 2.5 mL PBS, 1 h at approx. 22°C, prior to step 5f.\nCryopreservation and thawing of iBC\nTiming: 2 weeks\nCryopreservation of iBCs offers significant practical benefits and avoids the need to redo the lengthy differentiation protocol for every experiment. This step explains the methods for the cryopreservation and subsequent thawing of iBCs.\nNote: We have tested cryopreservation at several stages of the differentiation protocol. From our experience, cryopreservation is most successful, in terms of viability, at the iBCs stage. Cryopreservation prior to ∼day 40 of differentiation is not recommended.\n∼Day 40 or later: Cryopreservation\nFollow steps 1 through 3 from the “Evaluation of NKX2-1+/TP63+ airway progenitors in hPSC-derived airway epithelial organoids” section above to obtain single cells from airway epithelial organoids cultured in basal cell medium.\nResuspend single cells in basal cell medium supplemented with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a density of 200,000–500,000 cells per mL and transfer to a cryovial (1 mL per vial).\nPlace in cryostorage containers and cool in a −80°C freezer at −1°C/min for 24 h and then transfer to −150°C freezer or into liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nOptional: If the culture contains a low percentage of iBCs (less than ∼50%), sorting prior to freezing is recommended.\nOptional: We have also used a proprietary freezing medium with 10% DMSO, such as CryoStor CS10 and NutriFreez D10.",
    "Thawing: Thaw the cryopreserved cells using conventional cell culture methods. Briefly working quickly place the vial in a 37°C water or bead bath until almost completely thawed, transfer to a 15 mL conical and add 10 mL of DMEM/F-12 drop by drop, and then pellet by centrifugation at 300 g, 5 min.\nPlate 200,000 cells in a 50 μL Matrigel droplet per well of 12 well plate at 4,000 cells per μL of density in Matrigel. Incubate in a humidified incubator for 10–20 min and then add 1 mL basal medium per well. Feed every 2–3 days.\n3–4 days later, dissociate organoids to single cells by following steps 1 through 3.\nRe-plate 20,000 live cells in a 50 μL Matrigel droplet per well of 12 well plate at 400 cells per μL of Matrigel. Place the 12 well culture plate in a humidified incubator for 15–30 min and then add 1 mL basal medium per well. Feed every 2–3 days.\n10–14 days later, iBCs are ready to expand or to sort prior to the use for the desired experiment.\nNote: Significant cell death may be observed after thawing (the survival rate can vary greatly between 10 and 70%). Therefore, we recommend plating cells at a higher density at step 18 and re-plate based on live cell count, using trypan blue staining at step 20, to further expand cells at the appropriate cell density.\nEstablishing air-liquid interface culture (ALI) from iBCs\nTiming: 3 weeks\niBCs establish pseudostratified, well-differentiated airway epithelium through, but not limited to, in vitro air-liquid interface (ALI) culture or in vivo tracheal xenograft. ALI culture is a widely used and well-established methodology for in vitro airway biology research. This step explains how to establish ALI cultures from iBCs. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/836-Fig4.jpg",

DNA stained with DAPI, Scale bar = 50 μm.\n∼Day 40 or later coat 6.5 mm Transwell inserts with hES-qualified Matrigel.\nPlate 150,000-200,000 iBCs sorted at step 13 or 14 from either ∼Day 40, expansion, or cryopreservation, on the apical chamber of an insert in basal cell medium and add 500–600 μL of basal cells medium to the basolateral chamber. Place the culture plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2. Feed both top and bottom chambers with basal cell medium every other day.\nAfter 4–7 days, confirm confluent or near confluent (>80%) cell monolayer and then change the medium to PneumaCult ALI in both apical and basolateral chambers.\nThe following day, remove the medium from only top chamber and keep feeding every other day from bottom chamber for 2–3 weeks before using.\nNote: After one week in ALI, beating cilia should start to be visible under the light microscope. Evaluating specialized cell types such as ciliated cells and secretory cells is recommended to confirm the successful differentiation as needed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: As few as 30,000 iBCs can be plated in step 23, however, a longer duration of submerged culture may be required.\nNote: Other commercially available or non-proprietary defined media (e.g., bronchial epithelial growth medium, BEGM) may also be used in this step but have not been well characterized in this platform."
