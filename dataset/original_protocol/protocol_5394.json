    "Labeling requires a 25-ml culture of cyanobacterial cells at the exponential phase of growth. Protocol works very well for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 grown at 30 °C in growth medium BG11 (Rippka et al., 1979) to optical density at 750 nm~0.4. Harvest cells by centrifuging at 3,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature using brake 5 (Mikro 22R centrifuge).Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 2 ml of growth medium BG11, supplemented by 20 mM TES (pH 8.2). Transfer cells into a 2 ml tube and centrifuge at 3,500 x g for 2 min at room temperature (MiniSpin centrifuge).Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 450 μl of growth medium/20 mM TES. Transfer cells into a glass vial.Incubate cells in a water bath shaker for 30 min at 100 rpm under light and temperature conditions you prefer for your experiment.Add 180 μM of [14C]Glu dissolved in growth medium. Incubate under the same conditions for another 30 min.Transfer the labeled culture into a 2 ml o-ring cap tube. Spin down the cells at 7,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature and discard supernatant. At this point, the cell pellet can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C or used immediately for following pigment extraction.Resuspend cells in 1 ml of H2O and pellet cells at 7,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature. Discard water and repeat wash twice by 1 ml of H2O to remove all traced of labeled [14C]Glu. Resuspend cells in 1 ml of methanol/0.2% NH4OH. Add 50 μl of glass beads and vortex for 1 min to facilitate pigment extraction. Spin down 4 min at max rpm.",
    "Work under a dim light for all following stepsTransfer supernatant (~1 ml) into 2 ml tube and add another 300 μl of methanol/0.2% NH4OH to cells, vortex and spin down again. Combine supernatants and add 140 μl of 1 M NaCl.Add 400 μl of hexane, vortex and spin down 30 sec at max rpm to accelerate phase separation. Collect upper phase containing chlorophyll. Repeat step 9 three times and combine all hexane into a 2 ml tube.Evaporate hexane using SpeedVac concentrator set to V-AL and 30 °C for 5 min.Resuspend the pellet in 190 μl of methanol and add 10 μl of 10% KOH. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min to convert chlorophyll into phytol-less Mg-chlorin.Extract this solution by 200 μl of hexane and discard upper phase, repeat 4-times.Transfer remaining ~150 μl of the methanol phase into a new 0.5 ml tube. Evaporate this solution using a SpeedVac concentrator to final volume of 30-50 μl.Extract this solution 5 times by 150 μl of petroleum ether and discard upper phase containing carotenoids.Evaporate completely at 30 °C for 30 min and resuspend pellet in 30 μl of methanol:chloroform (1:1). Load 10 μl on the TLC plate. 5 μl can be used for measurement using scintillation counter (see next step).Load 10 μl of pigment solution on a silica gel TLC plate. Place the plate in a TLC developing tank with 300 ml of mobile phase – methanol: 10 mM NaXHYPO4, pH 6.8 (3:1, v/v). Remove the plate from the tank after 30 min of incubation and dry it at 37 °C for 10 min. Expose the plate to X-ray film for 3-5 days and develop. After development only a one signal should be detected corresponding to Mg-chlorin ‘green’ band on TLC.",
    "Note: An alternative to TLC followed by detection on an X-ray film is to use a scintillation counter and measure directly radioactivity in the final pigment fraction (5 μl). The later method is faster; however it is less sensitive and also accurate due to presence of 14C labeled impurities."
