    "Adult Sprague Dawley rats were used in this project and all procedures were approved by the University of Wyoming Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Surgery and In Vivo Nerve Fixation\nNOTE: Vendor information for all materials and equipment used in this protocol are listed in the Table of Materials.\nNOTE: In vivo nerve fixation is used to preserve the tissue and reduce structural degradation that can occur between the time of death and collection of the nerves. In vivo tissue fixation is a standard practice for preparation of nervous system tissue for histology, where perfusion is often a precursor to this. The placement and size of peripheral nerves allowed for in situ fixation. We do not recommend collection and fixation of tissue after euthanasia due to the possibility of tissue degradation.\nPrepare the rat for general anesthesia by placing it in an induction chamber with 2-3% isoflurane, then place the anesthetized rat in the prone position on the top of a dissection mat and maintain at 1-2% of isoflurane via anesthetic nose cone. To ensure adequate depth of anesthesia, test animals for pedal withdrawal at the hind feet and check for the absence of palpebral reflexes at the eyes by touching the medial canthus of the eye.\n\tNOTE: Intraperitoneal injection of ketamine is a commonly used alternative to inhaled isoflurane.",
    "To expose the sciatic nerve, shave the hair of the hind limb(s) and clean the shaved areas with 70% ethanol. With a scalpel or scissors, make a 2-3 cm incision in the skin along the hind limb from the knee up to the greater trochanter, where palpation of the femur using the sterile scalpel to ensure the proper location of the incision. The femur is located just proximal to the most accessible segment of the sciatic nerve. Even though this is a non-survival surgery, maintain sterile techniques.\nAfter making the skin incision, locate the plane between the biceps femoris muscle and the gluteus maximus muscle, and using microdissection scissors separate the underlying fascia and expose 2-3 cm of the underline sciatic nerve. To expose a clear section of the sciatic nerve, use a retractor to widen the gap between the two muscles (Figure 1A). With fine forceps and iris scissors, carefully separate the nerve from surrounding connective tissue, taking great care not to compress or cut the nerve.\nAdd sufficient Trump’s fixative (4% formaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde in 1x PBS (phosphate buffered saline) with 1.16 g of NaH2PO4·H2O per 100 mL) into the cavity containing the exposed nerve to cover the nerve and let sit for 10 min. If necessary, place gauze under the hind leg to improve the angle so that more fixative can be added into the cavity. Remove the fixative after 10 min and repeat this step two more times.\nUsing a dissecting microscope, cut the nerve from both sides using fine dissection scissors, making sure not to stretch or pinch the sciatic nerve, and immediately put the nerve sections in 15 mL tubes containing Trump's fixative at 4 °C for one week, changing the fixative every 48 h.",
    "Do not leave animals unattended during any part of the surgical procedure. After removal of the nerve, euthanize animals by cervical dislocation while under anesthesia.\n2. Osmium Tetroxide Treatment and Resin Embedding\nPost fixation, carefully remove any remaining fat and connective tissues from the nerve and use a sharp scalpel to cut the nerve into segments approximately 5 mm in length (nerve segments can be separated and labeled in different tubes). Prepare fresh 2% osmium tetroxide diluted in Trump's fixative solution and keep in a glass tube. Immerse nerve segments in 2% osmium tetroxide for 2 h, which can be in plastic tubes for this short period of time.\n\tNOTE: Some plastic tubes react with osmium tetroxide, causing a darkening of the solution, so prolonged storage of osmium tetroxide in plastic tubes is not recommended.\nUsing an epoxy embedding medium kit, prepare the final embedding formula:\n\t\nMix the epoxy embedding medium with DDSA solution (dodecenylsuccinic anhydride; mixture A) and mix the epoxy embedding medium with NMA solution (methylnadic anhydride; mixture B). Let both mixtures A and B mix at least 20 min by stirring with a magnetic stirrer.\nImmediately before use, mix mixture A and B and add the accelerator DPM-30 (2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol) in the proportion of 1.5 to 2.0% of the total volume of the mixture. Note that the DPM-30 solution should be measured precisely to prevent the block from becoming dark in color and brittle. All resin chemicals are toxic; take extra care to prevent skin contact or inhalation.",
    "Using 1.5 mL tubes, wash nerve segments with PBS and start the dehydration process by placing the nerve segments in different acetone/distilled water passages: 30%, 60%, 90%, concentrations for 10 min each, then in 100% acetone 3 times for 10 min each.  Note that ethanol can be used in the place of acetone.\nFor resin infiltration, place the nerve segments in a mixture of 1 part of the final embedding mixture and 1 part 100% acetone for 30 min, then in a mixture of 2 parts of the final embedding mixture and 1 part 100% acetone for 30 min, and finally place the nerve segments in the final embedding mixture for 30 min.\nPut the nerve segments into silicone rubber embedding molds (we have used 106 mm length x 71 mm width x 7 mm depth; block size 11 mm length x 6 mm width x 3 mm depth). Gently add the resin on top of the nerves, making sure to cover the whole nerve segments and avoid making air bubbles. Leave the mold containing nerve segments with the resin to polymerize at 60 °C overnight.\n3. Sectioning by Ultramicrotome\nPrepare glass knives using a glass knife maker (Figure 1B) and make glass knives with boats(Figure 1C), which are used to collect nerve sections floating on the distilled water.\nPlace resin embedded nerve blocks into the ultramicrotome holder with the trapezoidal side facing up. Using the ultramicrotome scope, trim any excess resin surrounding the nerve tissue, and make the block face a trapezoid shape and as close to the longitudinal surface of the nerve as possible using a single-edged blade, such as a razor blade. Do not penetrate the longitudinal surface of the nerve segment, which is recognizable by its dark staining by osmium tetroxide.",
    "NOTE: Trimming of excess resin will reduce the area of resin to be sectioned and improve blade performance and cutting in subsequent steps.\nUsing the ultramicrotome, make multiple cross sections sufficient to expose a uniform cross section surface of the nerve tissue using a plain glass knife. Once this is done, switch to a glass knife whose boat is filled with distilled water at room temperature and adjust the ultramicrotome to 1-2 μm to cut thin sections.\nTransfer floating thin sections from the glass knife boat to a drop of deionized water on glass slide using metal loop (Figure 1D). Dry slides containing sections by passing several times over a flame for a few seconds, making sure not to overheat the sections. Stain dried sections immediately with toluidine blue or store at room temperature for several days before staining.\n\tNOTE: Sections can also be dried using a plate warmer at 60 °C for 15 min. A slow drying process makes the sections smooth.\n4. Toluidine Blue Staining\nPrepare 1% solution of toluidine blue by dissolving 2 g of sodium borate in 100 mL of deionized water, then add 1 g of toluidine blue and stir until dissolved. Filter the solution using filter paper (pore size: 11 µm) and keep the solution in an opaque bottle at room temperature for up to two weeks.\nUsing a plastic pipette or micro pipettor, add a drop of toluidine blue solution on the top of the nerve sections and leave for 20-30 s.",
    "Rinse off all toluidine blue solution excess by gently dipping the slides into deionized water jar and repeat 3-4 times until sections are clear. Dry the slides at least 15 min at 60 °C or overnight at room temperature and then cover the sections with a coverslip using regular mounting medium. Examine the mounted slides immediately or store at room temperature.\nExamine under a light microscope. A 100X oil immersion lens is recommended for detailed images used to calculate g-ratios.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
