    "General requirements for the protocol: protein purification facilities, UV-Vis spectrometer, high-field NMR spectrometer and operating software, post-processing analysis software including; NMRPipe32, Sparky33, (or CCPN Analysis34, or NMRViewJ35).\n1. Recombinant expression and purification of a protein for PRE measurements\nDesign an expression construct for the protein of interest so that there is a single cysteine residue present. Multiple mutations will be required to introduce a free cysteine at different positions in the protein of interest36.\nExpress and purify a natural abundance (14N) or 15N-labeled sample of the protein of interest using an established protocol37.\n\tNOTE: E. coli expression systems provide cost effective and robust method for recombinant protein expression since isotopic enrichment of 15N is a minimal requirement for biomolecular heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Typical steps are expression in minimal media, chromatographic purification, and removal of affinity purification tag. This protocol assumes a robust expression and purification protocol has been established that can produce sufficient protein of suitable quality for NMR investigations.\n\t\nMaintain 1 mM reducing agent (DTT or TCEP) in buffers at all purification steps to prevent reaction of the free cysteine and formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds for IDPs.\n\t\tNOTE: Some systems may be more tolerant and less aggregation prone to non-reducing conditions depending on the specific characteristics of the protein, as well as the temperature, pH, and buffer system chosen for purification38.\nRemove affinity tags used for purification before proceeding since they may non-specifically interact with the protein in unpredictable ways or possibly contain reactive cysteine residues that could inadvertently serve as an unintended attachment site.\nPrepare a 15N labeled reference sample without cysteine mutation(s) mixed with a soluble version of the spin-label to assess the contribution of solvent PREs.\n2. Conjugating the 3-Maleimido-PROXYL nitroxide spin label",
    "Store or exchange the purified protein into a degassed buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7 and 1 mM TCEP; the buffer may also contain up to 8 M urea if needed to aid protein solubility.\n\t​Alternatively, rapidly dilute a protein stock solution into at least 10 volume equivalents of degassed 50 mM Tris pH 7 and 1 mM TCEP buffer. Ensure that the protein concentration prior to adding spin-label is at least 100 µM.\nAdd 3-Maleimido proxyl from a stock solution to 20x molar excess of the protein of interest. Protect the sample from light and oxygen and incubate overnight at room temperature or 4 °C; gentle rocking or nutation may improve labeling efficiency.\nPrepare stock solutions of the spin-label by dissolving 3-Maleimido proxyl powder in 95% ethanol. Aliquots of the stock can be stored at -80 °C for less than 6 months.\nCritical step: Remove the non-reacted free spin-label to prevent non-specific solvent PREs. Achieve this by gel filtration or (preferably) extensive dialysis of the protein sample. This step will also introduce the protein into a buffer suitable for NMR.\n\tNOTE: Reducing agents should be prepared fresh, and compatibility between buffer components should be considered; for example, TCEP degrades quickly in phosphate-based buffers, and this combination should be avoided39.\nTreat all buffers used from this step forward with a chelating resin selective for divalent and transition metals to remove paramagnetic ions or spin-label quenchers. If the protein cannot be stored in an NMR buffer, concentrate the protein to be rapidly diluted into a buffer suitable for NMR.\nMonitoring the efficiency of spin-label incorporation.\n\t\nUse Ellman's reagent (5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) for quantifying free sulfhydryl groups in solution40.",
    "NOTE: Detailed protocols are available from the manufacturer. For the purposes here, it is important to determine incorporation of the spin-label, the concentration of free sulfhydryl groups is compared with the total protein concentration. The percent of free sulfhydryl groups is the percent of molecules that do not have a nitroxide spin label attached.\nMonitor the intensity of the peak corresponding to the tagged cysteine residue to judge spin-label incorporation into the protein of interest.\n\t\t​NOTE: This is a rapid and effective approach to determine the degree of spin labeling of the protein. Complete incorporation of the spin-label will result in the disappearance of the peak from the spectrum. With the poor dispersion characteristic of IDPs the peak corresponding to the mutant cysteine residue may not always be readily identified, and thus the use of Ellman's reagent (step 2.6.1) is recommended.\n3. Prepare NMR sample for measuring intra- or inter-molecular PRE\nPrepare sample for measurement of intramolecular PRE\n\t\nPrepare 15N isotopically enriched, spin-labeled protein to a concentration of at least 100 µM but not more than 300 µM in a buffer suitable for NMR. Total sample volume (including D2O) is 500 - 550 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: Common NMR buffers include phosphate, acetate, (bi)carbonate, and TRIS. Good's buffers such as MES, HEPES may also be appropriate. Exercise caution when selecting buffers to ensure no cross-reactivity with other solution components.\nEnsure that the pH is ~7.2 or lower to minimize the effects of amide proton exchange with water. Keep the concentration of salt as low as possible (typically less than 150 mM), although the primary consideration is to maintain protein stability.\n\t\tNOTE: Approaches for conducting NMR experiments in high-salt conditions have been described elsewhere41.\nPrepare sample for measurement of intermolecular PRE",
    "Follow this step or step 3.1; they are not performed simultaneously. Prepare 14N natural abundance, spin-labeled protein in the chosen NMR buffer.\nPrepare the protein sample by mixing 15N isotopically enriched non-spin-labeled protein with 1%-50% 14N natural abundance spin-labeled protein so that the final concentration is identical to the sample prepared in 3.1.1. The total sample volume (including D2O) is 500 - 550 µL.\nEmpirically optimize the ratio of the 15N and 14N proteins for each protein studied. The ratios of 1%, 5%, and 20% of 14N-spin-labeled protein are good starting points.\n\t\tNOTE: A buildup of the PRE as a function of added 14N-spin-labeled protein indicates a specific effect; the observed PRE is sample-specific since it depends on distance and population (as discussed above), and therefore higher ratios of 14N-spin-labeled protein will be required if the interaction is particularly transient17.\nTransfer the NMR (either intra- or inter-molecular) sample to a 5 mm NMR tube that is appropriate for use in high-field magnets using a long-stem (9\") glass pipette or micropipette. Ensure that all NMR samples include 5%-10% of D2O to facilitate field locking.\n\t​NOTE: NMR tubes that utilize polymer plugs to reduce the necessary sample volume are not recommended for PRE measurements due to difficulties related to effective sample shimming.\n4. Set up NMR spectrometer and experiment specific parameters\nExercise extreme caution when working around superconducting, high-field NMR spectrometers.",
    "NOTE: Hazards include injuries due to the sudden acceleration of metallic objects toward the magnet, interference with implanted medical devices, and asphyxiation due to a sudden release of N2 and He2 gas in the event of a magnet quench. The following steps assume that the reader has undergone the required training, is aware of these and other local hazards, and has received approval from the facility manager to operate the NMR spectrometer. When in doubt of a step or instruction, consult with the facility manager or experienced user to prevent potential personal injury or damage to the spectrometer.\nThe following steps assume a commercial NMR spectrometer running a modern version of the acquisition control software. Download the pulse program and parameter files and place them in the appropriate directories.\n\tNOTE: A pulse program and parameter set suitable for use with a Bruker spectrometer and TopSpin (3.2 or later) are available upon request from the authors.\n\t\nCritical step: Familiarity with installing non-native NMR pulse programs is assumed; consult with the facility manager or an experienced user if necessary.\nPlace the sample in the magnet, lock on the 2H signal using the Lock command, tune and match the 1H channel according to facility protocols (the exact procedure will depend on if the probe is equipped with a remote tune and match module).\nAdjust the shims using the topshim subroutine to optimize solvent signal suppression.\nCalibrate the 1H and 15N 90° pulses using standard methods.\n\t\nCalibrate the 1H pulse using the popt program (use pulsecal first to estimate pulse length).\nCalibrate the 15N pulse against a standard sample; make sure this value has been calibrated recently by discussing with a technical director or experienced user.",
    "Alternatively, calibrate the 15N pulse on the sample by varying one of the 90° pulses of an HMQC experiment until a null signal is achieved.\nDetermine the correct attenuation for shaped pulses using the shape tool (stdisp) subroutine.\nOpen the appropriate pulse shape file by clicking on the folder icon. The shaped pulses are found in the pulse parameters section of ACQUPARS.\nLoad the pulse definition file and click on Analyze Waveform > Integrate Shape. Input the calibrated 1H 90° hard pulse, desired shaped pulse length, and rotation (90° or 180°).\nCalculate the power level of the shaped pulse by adding the change of power level to the attenuation for the calibrated 90° pulse.\nRecord a standard 1H, 15N HSQC (hsqcetfpf3gpsi) to optimize sweep width, carrier frequency and check water suppression25.\nAdjust the sweep width and the number of indirect dimension increments using the sw and td commands or directly in the appropriate dialog boxes. Typically, for collecting PREs, spectral widths are chosen so that the spectrum is not folded.\n5. Setup the 1HN-T2 experiment\nCalibrate the shaped pulses as described above (4.4.5-4.5.7). The shaped pulse parameter files for the PRE experiment are Eburp2.1000 (90° pulse), Reburp.1000, and Iburp2.1000. Enter the calibrated pulse lengths in the pulse parameters section on the ACQUPARS tab.\nThis experiment measures the 1HN-T2 using the two time-delay point approach30.\n\t\nSet the time delays by editing the vdlist file, the first delay (Ta) is set to 0.01 ms.\nChoose the second delay, (Tb) using the relationship to the expected maximum PRE (Tb ~ 1.15/(R2,dia + Γ2) where R2,dia represents the R2 of the diamagnetic sample13. Without prior knowledge of the magnitude of the PRE contribution to the observed relaxation, a good starting point is setting Tb to ~1x 1H T2.",
    "Then determine a suitable value by comparing the first increments (processed with the efp command) of the Ta and Tb spectra and adjusting Tb such that the signal decays to between 40%-50% of its initial value.\n\t\tNOTE: This approach optimizes the spectral signal-to-noise, a necessary consideration for samples that cannot be highly concentrated (< 50 µM). Suitable values of Tb are sample dependent but typically range from 8 - 40 ms for an average sized protein.\nDetermine the number of complex points to record and number of scans for sufficient signal averaging. Since IDPs have longer 15N T2 than folded proteins of comparable size, longer acquisition times in the indirect dimension may be used.\n\tNOTE: This value is dependent on the specific characteristics of the protein but can be roughly estimated from the 15N T2 and optimized by monitoring signal decay in the FID. For the direct dimension, 1024* complex points (13 ppm sweep width, 112.6 ms acquisition time) is sufficient for most samples.\nUse the command expt to calculate the experiment time and then start the experiment with the command zg.\n6. Make a diamagnetic sample by reducing spin-label with ascorbic acid\nDissolve sodium ascorbate in the NMR buffer and adjust the pH to match the original NMR buffer.\nCalculate the concentration of sodium ascorbate stock so that a 10x molar excess of ascorbate over the concentration of the spin-label can be added with the least change of sample volume. For example, for a 100 µM protein sample, a 100 mM stock of ascorbate is appropriate. Reducing the spin-label will require adding 5.5 µL of ascorbic acid stock solution, which is only 1 % of the total sample volume.",
    "Add the required amount of ascorbic acid to the NMR tube by placing a droplet below the rim of the tube, cap the tube, carefully invert the tube to mix, and then spin at 200-400 x g for 10-20 s in a hand-cranked centrifuge to settle the sample at the bottom of the tube.\nWrap the NMR tube in foil to protect from light and allow the reaction to proceed for at least 3 h.\nRecord 1HN-T2 on the diamagnetic sample using the same parameters used for the paramagnetic sample.\nRecalibrate the pulses. However, they should not have changed from the paramagnetic measurements; if they are significantly different (> 0.5 µs difference), consider sample quality (e.g., degradation, precipitation).\nEnsure that all acquisition parameters, including the specified relaxation delays (vdlist), number of dummy scans, number of scans collected, number of complex points collected, acquisition time, sweep widths, and carrier frequencies remain the same for the diamagnetic and paramagnetic samples.\n7. Process paramagnetic and diamagnetic spectra\nCopy the data to local computer or workstation that has NMRPipe and Sparky installed and configured. Make a folder named proc in the experiment data directory that contains the ser file.\nCopy the NMRPipe scripts fid.com, p3d.com, and nmrproc.com into proc (processing scripts are available upon request from the authors).\n\t\nUse the fid.com script to convert the Bruker data format (ser) into NMRPipe format.\nUse the p3D.com script to split the pseudo3D planes into individual spectra.\nUse the nmrproc.com script to read the output of the fid.com script, apply solvent suppression, a window function, append zeros to the raw data (zero fill), apply phase correction, execute a Fourier transformation, trim the data for display and write the processed data to disk. The script will output one file for each relaxation delay recorded (Ta and Tb).",
    "​NOTE: Each of these scripts is customizable to optimize the processing for the specific details of each experiment. Tutorials and example data sets are included in the NMRPipe distribution available from the NMRPipe website32. NMRDraw may be used for spectral viewing during processing (e.g., setting proper phase angles etc.). Options available for NMRPipe commands can be viewed using the command nmrPipe -help.\n8. Transfer resonance assignments and extract peak heights\nChange the file header information for each spectrum file (Ta, Tb for both paramagnetic and diamagnetic samples) using the command sethdr  [filename]  -ndim 2.\nUse Sparky to extract peak heights33 following steps 8.3-8.5. Other software packages, including NMRPipe (NMRDraw)32, CCPN Analysis34, and NMRViewJ35 are also appropriate.\nRead the spectral files into Sparky. At this step the data set will consist of one spectrum for each time point spectra (Ta, Tb), for both the paramagnetic and diamagnetic samples, measured for each position of the spin-label in the protein.\nUse Sparky to pick peaks (command: F8, then click and drag) and transfer assignments using the transfer peak list tool from a reference peaklist.\n\tNOTE: Resonance assignments of the protein of interest are necessary for sequence-specific interpretation of the observed PREs36.\n\t\nSet contours in both paramagnetic and diamagnetic spectra to the same level. Ensure to set the contours so that the spectra collected after the time delay do not purposely exclude peaks but are high enough so that the Ta spectra are not overly noisy.\nSave the new peak lists for each spectrum and include the measured peak intensity and Sparky calculated signal to noise ratio (command: lt to open peaklist, click options to include intensity and SNR columns, command: save).\n9. Extract 1HN-T2 rates for each residue and calculate PRE",
    "Import the peak lists into spreadsheet software or a preferred programming language such as Python.\n\tNOTE: For each spin-label position on the protein, the dataset will consist of four peak lists with associated peak intensities, one each of Ta and Tb for both the paramagnetic and diamagnetic experiments.\nCalculate 1HN R2 for both the paramagnetic and diamagnetic samples using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63057/63057eq01.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63057/63057eq02.jpg\nUse the above equation to determine the relaxation rate for each residue for the paramagnetic and diamagnetic samples.\nDetermine the 1HN-Γ2 rate for each residue using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63057/63057eq03.jpg\nUse the Sparky calculated signal to noise ratio (SNR) to compute the uncertainty of the peak height for each residue.\nPropagate the error using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63057/63057eq04.jpg\nPlot 1HN-Γ2 as a function of residue number using a scatter plot including the error calculated in 9.6.\nSubscription Required.
