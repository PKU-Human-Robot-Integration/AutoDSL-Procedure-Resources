Save the Report in PDF format with the Performance Tracking Report Date.\nAdjust 'Fluorescent PMT voltages' with Rainbow Beads (Table of Materials).\n\t\t​NOTE: The target values are stipulated in the Euroflow Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) entitled \"20180302_7th_Peak_Target_Values_Rainbow_Beads\". This SOP is available on Euroflow site (www.euroflow.org; in the public area; Protocols tab).\n\t\t\nCreate a new experiment via 'Monthly Instrument Setup Date | Specimen'.\n', choose the optical parameters and fluorochromes corresponding to the tubes concerned (FITC, PE, PerCPCy5.5, PE-Cy7, APC, APC-H7, V450, V500), and check the desired acquisition parameters (Log, A, H and / or W). Apply current CST settings (right click on 'Cytometer Settings' of the Experiment). Set the threshold for FSC parameter at 10,000.\nOn the cytometer, turn the compensation off while setting fluorescence PMT voltages for Target MFI setting; for this purpose, go in the 'Inspector', navigate to the 'Compensation' tab. Disable compensation by unchecking 'Enable Compensation' option.\nCreate a worksheet 'Target MFI' with all necessary dot plots (n = 2; FSC versus SSC, FITC versus PE), histograms (n = 8; one histogram for each fluorescence detector) and statistics showing the reference peak values (MFI and CV) for each fluorescence channel.\nDilute 1 drop of 8-peak Rainbow beads calibration particles in 1 mL of distilled water and vortex before use. Acquire without recording the 8-peak Rainbow beads solution at 'LOW' flow rate. Store the tube for up to 8 h at 2-25 ˚C in the dark if not acquiring immediately.",
    "Gate singlet beads 'Population P1' in the FSC versus SSC bivariate dot plot and the 8th or 7th peak in the FITC versus PE bivariate dot plot (the brightest peak or the next one downwards, as it's stipulated in the Euroflow document entitled \"20180302_7th_Peak_Target_Values_Rainbow_Beads\") and name this gate Population P2.\nContinue the acquisition of the 8-peaks Rainbow bead suspension and adjust PMT voltages in all fluorescence channels to reach target MFI values according the Euroflow document \"20180302_7th_Peak_Target_Values_Rainbow_Beads\".\nOnce Target MFI values for the 8th or 7th Peak are reached, record the Target MFI achieved and the corresponding final PMT values. Acquire 5,000 events and record the data.\n\t\t\tNOTE: That PMT values must be used below in step 1.2.3 (Performance Check - Confirmation of PMT Values with Rainbow Beads).\nRecord these values making a print screen with Worksheet 'Target MFI' and instrument settings and save as .jpg picture.\n\t\t\tNOTE: When a \"New\" tube is created, sometimes the PMT values vary unexpectedly.
