    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare preformed liposomes\nTiming: 8 h\nThis step describes the preparation of preformed liposomes from a well-defined ratio of pure lipids.\nDissolve the required lipids (POPC:POPG:Cholesterol in a ratio of 2:1:2) in chloroform (Sigma, 372978) to a concentration of 25 mg/mL in a glass vial.\nCritical: It is important to use glassware for handling and storing lipids that are dissolved in chloroform, as this will prevent contamination of polymers from the plastics (Pidgeon et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Furthermore, as chloroform is volatile, pipetting exact volumes can be difficult, so supplementation of chloroform should be performed rapidly.\nDehydrate the sample using a weak nitrogen stream while hand rotating the glass vial (4 mL test tube, Shimadzu) until all liquid is removed, leaving a lipid film on the bottom.\nNote: After dissolving the lipids in chloroform in the glass vials, it can be an advantage to mix and dehydrate them in a round-bottomed flask (50 mL round-bottomed flask, Glassco) while also rotating the flask. By doing so it will be easier to dry the lipids in a thin film, for subsequent rehydration.\nContinue dehydrating the thin lipid film for 2–4 h or overnight in a vacuum desiccator for complete removal of the chloroform.\nNote: If no desiccator is available, the glass vial can be placed in a 50 mL Falcon tube, the nitrogen outlet left inside the tube, finally wrapping the tube with parafilm. If dehydrating in a round-bottomed flask, the nitrogen outlet can be placed in the flask with parafilm wrapped around the neck. Perforate the parafilm by pinching small holes to ensure that excess nitrogen can flow out. The perforation should be sufficient to permit that excess nitrogen can leave the container.",
    "Critical: It is important to rehydrate the lipids immediately. In their dried state lipids are sensitive to oxidation. Thus, proceed with the next steps immediately following the dehydration.\nRehydrate the lipid film in lipid-resuspension buffer to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL lipid in the solution.\nWork swiftly to avoid lipid oxidation and/or keep the vial covered.\nEnsure that the suspension is homogenous through gently stirring or tapping the glass vial. In this way multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) will spontaneously form (Bangham et al., 1965[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: The fluorophore 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein is orange red as a powder as well as in a liquid stock (20 mM) due to self-quenching. The color of the fluorophore will change during the process of preparing proteoliposomes as the fluorophore will be diluted and will emit a neon-green color. Upon removal of excess fluorophore after dialysis and centrifugation, the suspension will be colorless.\nSonicate the lipid suspension in three cycles (15 min on / 5 min off) by placing the glass vial in a bath sonicator at 35 kHz (Sonorex RK100, Bandelin Electronic) or the equivalent (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1568-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic overview of preparation of AQP4 containing proteoliposomes\n(A) Following dehydration of the lipids to remove chloroform, the lipids are rehydrated in lipid resuspension buffer with fluorophore. Subsequently, the lipid suspension is sonicated to form small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs).\n(B) The lipid suspension is then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and the suspension slowly thawed at 20°C–22°C three times to form large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs).\n(C) The sample is extruded 11 times using a 100 nm polycarbonate filter to form LUVs with a uniform size (diameter of 100 nm).",
    "(D) The lipid sample is titrated with detergent to determine Rsat and Rsol by measuring the optical density at 540 nm (Geertsma et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Rsat and Rsol refer to the detergent concentration at which the membrane is saturated with detergent and fully solubilized, respectively. The middle arrow indicates the suggested detergent concentration at which the liposomes can be combined with the detergent-purified AQP for reconstitution.\n(E) Removal of excess fluorophore from the external side of the liposome as well as detergent to seal the proteoliposomes. Panel D is adapted from (Rigaud and Levy, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nCover the glass vial with e.g., parafilm. In this step small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are formed.\nCritical: SUVs should not be stored above their transition temperature for more than 24 h. The transition temperature of POPC and POPG is −2°C.\nTransfer the lipid solution to a plastic tube, while glass will break, and flash freeze the sonicated sample using liquid nitrogen, and thaw at 20°C–22°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nRepeat step 5 three times. This will fuse the SUVs into LUVs with fluorophore incorporated (Pick, 1981[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nPause point: In our laboratory we often introduce a pause point after the rehydration step (step 3) when MLVs have been formed, by storing the lipid suspension at −80°C. However, it is also possible to store the lipid solution after sonication or after the third freezing step, also at −80°C. The formed SUVs are stable for a couple of weeks before they start to aggregate and fuse into LUVs or MLVs (Lasic, 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), while the MLVs can be stored for longer periods.\nReconstitute the AQP into detergent-destabilized liposomes\nTiming: 20 h\nIn this step, the reconstitution of AQP4 into preformed liposomes destabilized in detergent is described.",
    "Equilibrate a mini extruder (Mini-Extruder, Avanti) filters (2× support filter, Whatman – 230300) and 1× 100 nm polycarbonate filter (Whatman Nucleopore – 800309)) using reconstitution buffer. The filters are assembled with a support filter on each side of the nanometer filter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: Prewash the extruder to ensure that it is equilibrated in the desired buffer and certify that the extruder does not leak before the sample is applied.\nDilute the lipid suspension to 1 mL in reconstitution buffer and extrude the non-uniform LUVs 11 times through the 100 nm filter membrane to form uniform LUVs for reconstitution.\nThe liposome suspension is initially opaque and will become transparent following the treatment (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: it can be difficult to remove the fluorophore completely from the individual parts of the extruders. Thus, if different proteins are assayed, it can be advantageous to have two sets of extruders, one for proteins that have fluorescein incorporated and one for non-fluorescein work. Residual fluorophore can also be removed by bath sonication for 10 min.\nDilute the LUVs 5× to reach a lipid concentration of 4 mg/mL in the reconstitution buffer.\nCritical: To stabilize the detergent-solubilized protein samples, the LUVs should be diluted in reconstitution buffer including 25% v/v glycerol to reach a final glycerol concentration of 20% v/v.\nTitrate the LUVs with a detergent such as Triton X-100 at 20°C–22°C until the liposomes are saturated with detergent and the so-called Rsat is reached.\nSupplement aliquots of 5 μL 10% v/v Triton X-100 and mix the suspension gently.\nLet the Triton X-100/LUV suspension equilibrate shortly (approx. 20–30 s) between each addition.",
    "The destabilization of the liposomes can be monitored through assessment of the optical density of the lipid suspension at 540 nm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). In our hands, Rsat is typically reached at a 0.02% w/v Triton X-100 concentration.\nCritical: The appropriate concentration of detergent (e.g., Triton X-100) to destabilize the liposomes needs to be determined empirically through titration. At detergent concentrations below Rsat, the efficiency of protein insertion is low, while at detergent concentrations somewhat above Rsat, insertion is typically efficient (Geertsma et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). At elevated detergent concentrations, the liposomes will start to disintegrate forming lipid-detergent mixed micelles, rendering the solution optically transparent (Rsol) (Rigaud and Levy, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nDivide the liposomes into the required number of tubes, with 500 μL solution (or 2 mg lipids) in each.\nSupplement the purified AQP to the detergent destabilized liposomes in the desired lipid-to-protein-ratio (LPR, w/w) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nFor AQP4, a LPR of 200 is prepared by adding 10 μL of 1 mg/mL protein to the solution. The LPR may need to be optimized for each target.\nCritical: Include a sample with empty liposomes that has been treated with Triton X-100, as this will serve as a negative control in the following activity measurements. Also, do at least triplicates of the reconstitution procedure for statistical purposes when quantifying the water permeability (see below). Preferably the triplicates should represent three different biological samples (purifications) but triplicates using the same purification will assess differences in reconstitution effectiveness.\nMix by gently inverting the tube 2–3 times and incubate for 1 h at 4°C.\nDialyze the sample against 1 L dialysis buffer (see above) using a 12–14 kDa cut-off membrane (Spectrum, 132700) for 16 h at 4°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).",
    "This step is critical to reduce the detergent concentration of the mixture and to remove residual fluorophore from the external side of the liposomes.\nCentrifuge at 57,000 × g for 1.5 h in a small ultra-rotor (Thermo Scientific - F23-48 × 1.5) and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the lipidic pellets of three independent reconstitutions (triplicates) in 1 mL dialysis buffer (see above).\nAssay water flux through proteoliposomes by stopped-flow spectrometry\nTiming: 1–6 h (depending on the number of constructs and conditions measured)\nMix the proteoliposomes with reaction buffer in a stopped-flow spectrometer such as a SX-20 (Applied Photophysics) and collect data at 495 nm at a 90° angle for 2 s (or adjust the length of the measurement depending on the construct and condition).\nAs proteoliposomes are impermeable to sucrose, the osmolytic gradient will trigger water efflux and shrinkage of the proteoliposomes and thereby an increase in light scattering by (5)6-carboxyfluorescein at this wavelength (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1568-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Assessing water flux capacity of isolated AQPs using stopped flow\n(A) Schematic overview of the proteoliposome-based assay. Proteoliposomes with AQP inserted are mixed with reaction buffer and exposed to a hyperosmotic gradient in a stopped-flow setup. This triggers water efflux and shrinkage of the proteoliposomes, leading to an increase in the light scattered by (5)6-carboxyfluorescein measured at 495 nm.\n(B) Representative measurement of the water permeability of reconstituted AQP4 (blue line) and control empty liposomes (black line).\n(C) Representative western blot of three separate reconstitutions of an AQP to scale the water transport capacity relative to the protein levels incorporated in the proteoliposomes. Quantification is performed using e.g., the software ImageJ. The efficiency can be used to adjust the k1-value of each reconstitution, and hence to adjust the Pf-value.",
    "Note: Depending on the AQP and measurement, other osmogents such as NaCl (Missel et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) and sorbitol (Liu et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) may also be exploited."
