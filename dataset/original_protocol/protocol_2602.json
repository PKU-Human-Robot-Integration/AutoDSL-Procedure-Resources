    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue collection and tissue slice generation\nTiming: 30 min\nBulk tissue, the full tumor sample removed directly from a tumor bearing mouse or patient, is sectioned into thin cross-sectional slices suitable for surgical implantation. These slices contain both epithelial and stromal tissue in its native tissue architecture to facilitate engraftment and support tumor initiation and growth. These flexible slices are more amenable to folding into a pocket of pancreatic tissue for orthotopic implantation compared to a rigid cube.\nThe protocol may be used for either implantation of primary tissues from human patients, or for expansion of established PDX lines.\nNote: Just prior to tissue collection, fill wells of a 6-well plate halfway with ice cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution. Keep plate on ice.\nCollecting tissue sample from:\nPrimary human (biopsy).\nTwo sample cores should be collected from each biopsy and placed into cold, sterile PBS. Biopsy cores are generally thin strings of tissue, with a <1 mm diameter.\nTrim core samples with a scalpel under sterile conditions into approximately 2 mm long fragments.\nPlace individual slices from each core into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes with 50 μL PDX media (RPMI + 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and 50 μL Matrigel.\nCritical: Store on icy slush (ice half filled with water).\nProceed directly to step 4 (orthotopic implantation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]).\nPrimary human (resection).\nFollowing resection, tissue should be placed in cold, sterile DMEM – or any standard collection media - and kept on ice until embedded (step 2). If possible, the optimal size and shape of resected patient tissue should be in the shape of a cylinder or wedge, with 2–3 mm width and a longer axial dimension (> 1 cm if possible) in order to facilitate stable embedding into the sample holder.\nEstablished PDX line (mouse).",
    "Humanely euthanize the animal as per your approved IACUC protocol.\nPlace the mouse on a dissection stage in a supine position and spray torso with 70% ethanol to sterilize.\nUsing dissection scissors, cut through and peel away the skin and peritoneum to expose the abdominal cavity.\nLocate the pancreas (typically behind intestinal loops, below the stomach, extending laterally to the spleen) and locate the tumor.\nUse dissection scissors and/or scalpel to remove the tumor from the surrounding tissue. Place in a sterile petri dish.\nIf necessary, trim any healthy pancreas tissue from the borders of the tumor, then transfer to the 6-well plate with ice-cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution and store on ice prior to moving on to step 2.\nEmbed tissue in specimen tube.\nAdd 10 mL distilled H2O to pre-measured low-melting agarose (2.5% w/v) and microwave on high for 30 s.\nLet cool until the flask is still hot, but comfortable to touch (approximately 1 min to around 50°C/120°F).\nInsert Compresstome white plastic plunger into metal casing, leaving an approximately 2–3 cm chamber.\nTape casing to plunger with lab tape (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and place the completed construct vertically in ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2260-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Embedding specimen in agarose\nFully assembled specimen holder with cooling block.\nNotice the change in color and opacity of the agarose from clear (middle, newly embedded sample) to a hazy gray (right, cooled and solidified sample).\nFill the chamber of the specimen tube with cooled agarose using a transfer pipet.\nTransfer the bulk tissue into the specimen tube using forceps and submerge until fully covered by agarose.\nPlace the frozen chilling block around the specimen tube and let sit on ice for several minutes until the agarose solidifies.",
    "Note: The agarose will solidify and turn slightly opaque. However, remove the sample from the cooling block before the agarose freezes, indicated by crystals forming on the edges of the agarose.\nSection bulk tissue.\nInsert specimen tube into Compresstome tray until flush, then remove tape around the specimen tube to release the plunger.\nScrew the tray into the Compresstome base.\nFill the tray halfway with ice cold Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution.\nScrew in blade holder with blade-side facing the specimen holder using the provided Allen wrench.\nAdvance the Compresstome piston until in contact with specimen holder using ‘fast forward’ button and continue advancing until agarose begins to protrude from the edge of the specimen holder into the tray.\nSection tissue using the Compresstome settings as described in equipment setup[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3] section). Collect slices into cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution in a 6-well plate on ice.\nUse a scalpel to further trim slices into pieces approximately 2 × 3 mm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2260-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Tumor slice trimming\nRepresentative images of a full tumor slice and appropriately trimmed implantation-sized pieces (step 3h).\nPlace individual slices into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes with 50 μL PDX media (RPMI + 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and 50 μL Matrigel. Store on icy slush (ice half filled with water).\nCritical: The ice-water slush mix is critical. Using only ice may freeze the slices, drastically reducing the engraftment viability.\nOrthotopic implantation\nTiming: 7–10 min/mouse\nMethods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] provides a step-by-step visualization of the implantation surgery.\nUse an isoflurane chamber primed with 2% isoflurane in oxygen to induce anesthesia in 4–6 weeks old mice.\nEnsure adequate depth of anesthesia by toe pinch reflex check and continue to check every 10 min for duration of procedure.",
    "Place the anesthetized mouse lying on its right flank on a heated pad with head in an anesthesia nosecone, administering 2% isoflurane.\nAdminister 3.25 mg/kg Buprenorphine∗ extended-release (∼50 μL) followed by 20 mg/kg antibiotic enrofloxacin (Baytril; diluted 1:10 in sterile saline, ∼50 μL) subcutaneously (preferably under the neck scruff).\nCritical: Buprenorphine is a Class III Controlled Substance and must be stored, dispensed, and used according to all relevant regulatory requirements. Extended-release formulations (Buprenorphine extended release) are preferred as to simplify the number, frequency and volume of analgesic administrations.\nNote: User should use the analgesic and antibiotic treatments approved for their protocols.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to mouse’s eyes to prevent the eyes from drying during the surgery.\nIf the recipient animals have fur, shave the left abdominal flank and remove fur stubble with depilatory cream (e.g., Nair). Clean off excess cream and fur with gauze soaked in PBS or isotonic saline.\nNote: This step could also be done as part of surgery prep to save time.\nDisinfect the skin three times with povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol in alternating swabs.\nIdentify the location of the spleen on the left abdominal flank.\nUse scissors to make a lateral (“head to tail” axis) skin incision (≤ 15 mm) on the left upper quadrant of the abdomen slightly ventral (toward the belly) from the distal point of the spleen.\nGently blunt dissect the skin away from the peritoneal muscle.\nUse another pair of sterile scissors to make a lateral incision in the peritoneal wall above the spleen, parallel to the skin incision.\nNote: Take care to avoid injury to the spleen.\nIdentify the pancreatic tissue in the vicinity of the distal tail of the spleen and the left kidney.",
    "Using a sterile cotton swab (rather than forceps), externalize the pancreas by touching the swab to the pancreas.\nGently lift the pancreas through the incisions, and rest it on top of the abdomen.\nNote: Pancreatic tissue is extremely fragile and prone to injury. Thus, the use of forceps to manipulate the pancreas is not advised.\nPlace a suture loop underneath the pancreas, with the suture ends above the pancreas.\nWith the tail of the pancreas oriented to point distally, use microscissors to make a coronal incision (“body cross section” axis) in the pancreatic parenchyma of approximately 2–3 mm, 1 mm below the line of the suture loop and create a “pocket” by gently expanding scissors or tongs within the parenchyma.\nRemove the cut tissue slice from the media/Matrigel mix and carefully insert into the pancreatic pocket.\nVery carefully fold the tail of the pancreas over the pocket and inside the suture loop, such that the tails of the suture loop are underneath the pancreas.\nGently pull close the suture loop to close the pocket and firmly hold the tumor fragment in place.\nNote: The closed suture should be tight enough to maintain the integrity of the pocket such that the tissue will remain folded over once released, and loose enough to not risk laceration of restriction of blood flow that will induce ischemia. If the tissue is distorted around the suture loop (puckered or noticeably cinched), this indicates that the suture is pulled too tight.\nPull the suture loop tails around to the front of the pancreas and tie a double knot to fix the pocket closed.\nCarefully return the tail of the pancreas to the abdominal cavity, making sure that the pocket is disturbed as little as possible.",
    "Note: Take care that the pancreas is entirely within the abdomen space and not protruding between peritoneum and skin layer.\nSuture the abdominal incision closed with sterile absorbable suture.\nNote: Take care to avoid suturing the pancreas onto the incision wound.\nUse wound clips to close the skin incision.\nApply povidone-iodine disinfectant to the closed wound and return animal to a cage on a heated pad for recovery. Monitor until animal is alert and independently mobile.\nReturn mice to the cage and ensure full recovery.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Orthotopic implantation surgery – An example surgery demonstrating the implantation of tissue into a murine pancreas\nThis video corresponds to steps 10 and 19.\nPost-surgical monitoring & maintenance\nMonitor mice daily for satisfactory wound healing, administering post-operative analgesia in accordance with IACUC protocol and veterinary guidelines.\nApproximately 14 days after surgery, the surgical wound should be healed enough to remove the wound clips using a clip remover.\nAfter wound clips are removed, implanted mice should be monitored at least twice a week for tumor development.\nPrimary screening for tumor development may be performed by abdominal palpation.\nHalf suspend the mouse by holding the base of the tail with one hand while allowing the mouse to grip onto a surface with its front paws.\nWith the other hand, place thumb and index finger on the animal just caudal (below) the ribcage.\nGently press fingers together and gently push underneath the ribcage.\nNote: Presence of a hard lump suggests that a tumor has likely developed.\nAn animal identified via palpation should then be examined with ultrasound as previously described by Sastra et al.,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] to confirm tumor presence and size."
