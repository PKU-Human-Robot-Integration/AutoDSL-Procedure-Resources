Remove the supernatant.",
    "Wash the cells with 200 μL of ice-cold DPBS.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 100 × g for 5 min at 4°C and remove as much supernatant as possible.\nNote: It is recommended to use a BSA cross-linking positive control (96 μL of 10 μM BSA). Negative control is performed using 4 μL of DMSO instead of DSSO. The optimal working final concentration of DSSO is between 1–5 mM.\nCritical: Cross-linkers are moisture sensitive. Prepare these cross-linkers immediately before use. Use amine-free buffers (PBS, 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM carbonate/biocarbonate, or 50 mM borate). Cross-linking reactions (acylation) are favored near neutral pH (pH 6– 9) and with concentrated protein solutions.\nSubcellular protein fractionation of cross-linked and non-cross-linked cells.\nTiming: 3 days\nThe following methodology describes the steps of subcellular protein fractionation after the cross-linking reaction. This methodology is based on the instructions from the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Scientific, Cat# 78840). For more details and troubleshooting, please refer to the manual on Thermo website[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011667_Subcellular_Protein_Fraction_CulturedCells_UG.pdf].\nDMSO control of cells are treated according to the same protocol. These controls are key to determining the experimental subcellular location of the AltProts.\nOther subcellular fractionation kits in the market are Abcam’s Cell Fractionation Kit - Standard (Cat# ab109719) and Cell Signaling’s Cell Fractionation Kit (Cat# 9038). These kits are designed to fractionate the cells in three subcellular fractions which will not decrease the complexity of the samples as much.\nNote: Thaw all buffers using a 20°C water bath. Keep CEB, MEB, and NEB buffers on ice until use. Use a rotary shaker to avoid clumping of insoluble material during incubations.\nCritical: Immediately before use, add Thermo Scientific Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail at a 1:100 dilution into each volume of buffer required. Keep all protein extracts on ice.",

BSA cross-linked and not cross-linked are used as controls. Red arrows display cross-linked signals demonstrating that the reaction takes place.\n(B) The subcellular fractionation was confirmed by Western blot with compartment specific markers. The cytoplasm fraction showed the presence of HSPA1A signal. Calreticulin signal was detected at chromatin, cytoskeleton, and exhibited a stronger signal at the membrane-bounded fraction. SP1 was observed in the nucleus and cytoskeleton, while Histone H3 was found in chromatin and cytoskeleton. Similarly, Cytokeratin 18 was detected in the nucleus and cytoskeleton. These findings are consistent with the results reported in UniProtKB, COMPARTMENTS, and the literature.\nNote: Only non-cross-linked samples will continue to the western blot analysis.\nCritical: Use one membrane with the five subcellular protein fractions for one compartment specific primary antibody.\nTransfer the gels onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane.

This will provide you with a general panorama of the commands, formatting options, and different analyses that can be performed in the software.\nPPIs network treatment.\nExport the cross-links identified from Proteome Discoverer 2.5 as an Excel file (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2778-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Cytoscape and ClueGo interface windows\n(A) Displays how to import a cross-linking network from a file of identification by Proteome Discoverer 2.5. Additionally, it shows how to label the columns as target and source nodes during this process.\n(B) Presents the control panel of the ClueGo app at Cytoscape. The loading marker square, where to load the query protein list, is highlighted in yellow.\nOpen the file and split the column description to obtain the gene symbols of the proteins identified in cross-link.\nWrite in two new columns (Gene A and Gene B) the gene annotations.",
    "Import this network from the file to Cytoscape.\nAssign the source node to the Gene A column and the target node to Gene B column.\nSelect the network (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A) and STRINGify it (STRING App).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2778-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Cross-linking network evolution during the processing steps\n(A) Shows a raw cross-linking network after import.\n(B) Stringified cross-linking network. Note that the AltProts are not in the STRING format, meaning they are not indexed at string database.\n(C) Displays only the interaction between the RefProts without cross-links. The enriched nodes are shown in gray STRING nodes.\n(D) After merging B and C, all the interactions are displayed. Formatting is done for the nodes and edges.\n(E) Presents a ClueGo enriched network. Only GO term nodes are displayed, the protein nodes are kept hidden.\n(F) Resulting network after merging D and E. Combined the information of enriched proteins, query RefProts and AltProt, connected to the GOterm. As well as the cross-link identified interactions, StringDB and other databased enriched interaction existing between the proteins of the network.\nNote: Verify that all RefProt nodes are now STRING nodes. If not (plain gray nodes at Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B), verify that there are no spaces in the accession numbers or genes. For Cytoscape a space after the gene/accession creates a duplicate non-referenced node.\nOnce all the RefProts have a STRING node, copy the column of accession numbers, and input them in the STRING protein query. This step will identify the already described interactions between the RefProts (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nNote: If there are RefProt nodes that do not have any interactors, select them one by one and add known interactors in the STRING menu (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C, bright gray STRING nodes).\nMerge the networks.",
    "Note: The resulting merged network (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D) will simplify the redundant cross-links. We recommend formatting this network to visualize the interactions of interest.\nCross-validate the RefProt interactions in other databases. We recommend BioGrid[href=https://thebiogrid.org/]34[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34] and IntAct[href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/home].35[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]\nGO term enrichment (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nOpen ClueGo App.\nSelect the functional analysis as analysis mode.\nInput the whole list of RefProt genes at the load marker list box.\nSelect the ontologies/pathways to use for the enrichment.\nSelect the specificity of the network.\nEnable the GO term fusion.\nRun the app.\nMerge the ClueGO network (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E) and the merged STRING network (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D).\nAt the resulting network (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]F) select the preferred network layout and edit the node’s properties. We recommend formatting the network in a way that you can obtain the information you need."
