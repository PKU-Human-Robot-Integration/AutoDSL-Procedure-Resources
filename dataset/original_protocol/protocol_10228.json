    "1. Fabrication of a 3D Printed Receptacle\nChambers, lids, and base\nLoad a 3D printer with High-Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) by using the printer interface to set the print bed temperature to 85 °C and the extruder to 230 °C. When the temperatures are reached, loosen the idler arm, insert the filament, and push down until it starts to extrude out of the hot end. Then, retighten the filament idler arm and remove the extruded material.\nImport the 3D receptacle STL model file into a 3D printing slicing software, which can normally be achieved by navigating to the file tab and selecting the import/open options (Figure 2).\nIf slicing software offers high and low quality print settings, select high quality while also ensuring that the correct material profile is selected.\n\t\tNOTE: If printing several receptacles in one run, make sure that the software is set to print each object one at a time. If this step is skipped, the print quality may be reduced, which will likely cause tolerance issues when fitting the parts together.\nOnce the printing is complete, wait until the print bed temperature is below 50 °C to remove the parts.\nUsing a thin wire brush, gently clear the electrode socket of any imperfections that may cause obstructions when fitting the chamber with an electrode.\nElectrodes\nReplace the HIPS filament for a cleaning filament and run plenty of the material through the print head.\nLoad the printer with an electrically conductive polylactic acid (PLA) filament that has a volume resistivity of 0.75 Ω-cm or less.\nSet the print bed temperature to 60 °C and the extruder to 230 °C (see step 1.1.1 for guidance).",
    "When the temperatures are reached, extrude several centimeters of the filament through the print head. This process will help ensure that all particulates from previous sessions are removed.\nUsing a 3D printing slicing software, load the electrode STL file (Figure 3).\nIn the print settings, specify the following: Layer height = 0.16 mm, Shell thickness = 1.7 mm, Bottom/Top thickness = 0.74 mm, Fill density = 100% (Figure 4).\nIf printing several electrodes in one run, set the printer to print one at a time.\nOnce printed, leave the electrodes on the print bed until they have cooled to room temperature. This ensures the part does not become warped and misshaped.\nReceptacle assembly\nSlot an electrode into each of the two chambers. If step 1.1.5 has been completed correctly, the electrodes should go into the chambers without much force.\nUsing a sharp scalpel, cut a 10 mm piece of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing (4 mm inner diameter and 6 mm outer diameter) taking care to ensure that each end is cut straight and cleanly.\nGently ease each end of the 10 mm PVC tubing over the rim of the two electrodes.\nOnce connected, the two chambers clip into the base.\n2. Receptacle Preparation and P. polycephalum Inoculation\n2% agar medium preparation\nPut 2 g of non-nutrient microbiological agar powder into a 250 mL glass bottle.\nAdd 100 mL of deionized water and mix well.\nAutoclave the bottle for 12 - 15 min at 121 °C or place in a boiling water bath for 15 - 20 min.\nSetting the agar substrate into the receptacle's chambers\nMelt the agar using a water bath or microwave.\nFill a 2 mL pipette with molten agar.",
    "Fill each of the receptacle's chambers by hovering the nib of the pipette approximately 5 mm above the internal base and slowly filling the wells up to the bottom of the connecting tube hole.\nImmediately after filling the wells, place a lid on each of the chambers and set the receptacle aside until the agar has set and reached room temperature.\nP. polycephalum inoculation\nPlace an oat flake in each of the two chambers.\nRemove one 2 mL blob of pseudopods from a starved (approximately 12 h) culture of plasmodium and place it in one of the two chambers. To promote speedy growth, try to take the protoplasm from the most active anterior of the organism."
