    "NOTE: All cell manipulations, as well as culture dishes and medium preparations, should be performed under sterile conditions. The laminar flow hood should be cleaned thoroughly prior to use and after processing by wiping all the surfaces with 70% ethanol. The described protocol is optimized for neuronal differentiations in a CERO 3D Incubator and Bioreactor (in the following referred to as benchtop bioreactor). This benchtop bioreactor offers four slots for specialized bioreactor tubes, each with a maximum capacity of 50 mL. Temperature and CO2 levels are continuously controlled, and cultivation parameters (e.g., rotational speed and time) are regulated for each tube independently. All aspiration steps have been performed using an aspiration pipette and vacuum pump, if not stated otherwise.\n1. Culturing and expansion of hiPSCs\nNOTE: The engineered doxycycline-inducible NGN2 hiPSC line BIONi010-C-13 is used in this protocol. The expansion protocol provided here is optimized for 6 cm Petri dishes, but alternative culture formats can be used if preferred.\nCoat 6 cm Petri dishes with basement membrane matrix diluted in cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 (-/-) at a final concentration of 0.083 mg/mL/10 cm2. Incubate the coated dishes at 37 °C for at least 30 min.\n\tNOTE: A detailed protocol for the preparation of basement membrane matrix solution can be found in the manufacturer's instructions. hiPSCs can be cultured on alternative extracellular matrices for expansion.\nThaw cryopreserved hiPSCs according to the EBiSC Cell line User Protocol21 in feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632). A seeding density of 1 × 106 viable cells per 60 mm dish is recommended.\nChange the medium the next day to feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium without ROCK inhibitor, and perform daily media changes.",
    "Start passaging when the hiPSC cultures reach a confluence of 60%-80%. Check for differentiated areas and clean the colonies manually if the area exceeds 5%.\n\tNOTE: Undifferentiated hiPSCs appear as round cells with a prominent nucleolus and less cytoplasm. Flat and tightly packed colonies are formed early after thawing or passaging. Exemplary brightfield images of hiPSC cultures are shown in Figure 1. Further information is provided in the EBiSC Cell line User Protocol21. For passaging, prepare basement membrane matrix-coated dishes and feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium.\nAspirate the medium from hiPSC cultures and rinse the cells 2x with 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 1x Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPS [-/-], see Table of Materials).\nRemove the supernatant and add 2 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA in 1x DPBS (-/-) to the 6 cm Petri dishes. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 3 min in the incubator.\nAspirate 1.5 mL of the EDTA solution and continue incubation for 3-5 min.\nGently tap the dishes to facilitate cell detachment.\n\tNOTE: Check detachment by visual assessment. hiPSC colonies should start to detach after 5 min, but a longer incubation time may be required with higher confluent hiPSC cultures. If the colonies do not detach, increase the incubation time until 10 min, but do not exceed this time frame.\nAdd 5 mL of feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium to the 6 cm Petri dishes, and gently resuspend the colonies 2x with a 10 mL serological pipette or by using wide-bore pipette tips. Transfer the cells to a 15 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: hiPSCs are highly sensitive to mechanical stress; thus, multiple resuspending should be avoided. The final cell suspension should consist of small colony fragments (50-200 µm).",
    "Aspirate the supernatant from the coated culture dishes, and prepare 4 mL of feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium per 6 cm dish.\nTransfer small colony fragments to the freshly prepared culture dishes in split ratios of 1:10 to 1:40, and cultivate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with daily media changes.\n\tNOTE: Small colonies should attach within 1 or 2 h after passaging.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65085/65085fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Morphology of human induced pluripotent stem cell cultures.

Precultivation of hiPSCs in the benchtop bioreactor system (day-2)\nNOTE: Start precultivation when the hiPSC cultures reach a confluence between 60% and 80%. Check the hiPSC colonies for differentiated areas. During this precultivation phase, the hiPSCs are maintained in feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium for 2 days.\nPrepare the culture media, consisting of feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632).\nAspirate the medium completely from the hiPSCs and gently rinse the cells with 1x DPBS (-/-) twice.\nAdd 2.0 mL of prewarmed trypsin-EDTA solution to the 6 cm Petri dishes and incubate the cells for 3 min at 37 °C in the incubator.\nGently tap the dishes to facilitate cell detachment, or incubate for 1-2 min longer.\nResuspend the cells in 5 mL of feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium + ROCK inhibitor per dish. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL or 50 mL tube and mix gently by pipetting to ensure cell singularization.",
    "Determine the cell numbers in 100 µL of cell suspension using an automated cell counter as previously described20. Transfer the corresponding volume for 15 × 106 cells per bioreactor tube into a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 2 mL of feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium + ROCK inhibitor.\nFill up each 50 mL tube with 18 mL of medium (cell seeding density of 0.75 × 106 cells/mL). Dispense the cell suspension into the bioreactor tubes (20 mL per tube).\nPlace the tubes into the bioreactor system. Set the following cultivation parameters: 2 s rotation period, 60 rpm rotation speed, no agitation pause, 37 °C, and 5% CO2 for an unlimited duration20.\nStart the cultivation program via the bioreactor display.\nChange the media the next day. Let the aggregates settle down in the bioreactor tubes for ~5 min. Carefully aspirate the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: Do not let the aggregates settle down for longer than 10 min, as they might stick to each other and build a heterogeneous aggregate suspension. It is recommended to leave ~5 mL of culture medium in the bioreactor tube.\nAdd 15 mL of fresh feeder-free iPSC maintenance medium without ROCK inhibitor per tube, and continue the cultivation in the benchtop bioreactor for 24 h.\n3. Differentiation of hiPSCs into early neurons (day 0)\nPrepare neurobasal medium (NBM): 50% DMEM/F-12 with stabilized L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, 50% neurobasal medium, 0.5x serum-free supplement (50x), 0.5x serum-free supplement based on Bottenstein's N-1 formulation (100x), 0.5x stabilized L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, 0.5x MEM non-essential amino acids solution (100x), 500 nM sodium pyruvate (100 mM), 50 nM 2-mercaptoethanol (50 mM), 0.025% human insulin solution, and 5 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin.",
    "NOTE: NBM has to be stored at 4 °C and can be used for up to 2 weeks.\nStart neuronal differentiation by adding doxycycline (DOX) to the hiPSC cultures. For this, let the aggregates settle down in the bioreactor tubes. Carefully aspirate the supernatant from the cells, leaving ~5 mL in the tube, and add 35 mL of neural induction medium (NIM) consisting of NBM and 2 µg/mL DOX.\n\tNOTE: As DOX is light-sensitive, it is recommended to turn off the light while working.\nPlace the tubes back into the benchtop bioreactor and continue cultivation.\nPerform media changes every day for 2 days, as described in step 3.2.\n\tNOTE: After 4 days in suspension culture, the aggregates can be dissociated, and early neurons cryopreserved or directly replated for terminal maturation.\n4. Cryopreservation of early neurons (day 2)\nNOTE: Cryopreservation is not required and not critical for the differentiation process, but highly recommended as large stocks of early neurons can be produced and stored for subsequent maturation and analyses.\nLet the aggregates settle down in the bioreactor tube. Aspirate the supernatant as previously described.\nTransfer the aggregates to a sterile 15 mL or 50 mL tube and gently rinse the aggregates 2x with 1x DPBS (-/-). Carefully aspirate the supernatant as much as possible without disturbing the aggregates.\nAdd 2-5 mL of prewarmed cell dissociation enzyme, depending on the pellet size, and incubate the cells for approximately 10 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Gently resuspend the sedimented aggregates every 2 min until the aggregates dissociate.\n\tNOTE: An almost homogenous cell suspension should be obtained after 7-10 min of incubation.\nAdd the triple volume of prewarmed NBM medium and resuspend the cells carefully to ensure cell singularization.",
    "Determine the cell numbers and transfer the corresponding volume for cryopreservation into a 15 mL or 50 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: A cell density of 5-10 × 106 cells/mL of freezing medium is recommended.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellet in the corresponding volume of freezing medium containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nAliquot the cell suspension in suitable vials for cryopreservation (1 mL/vial).\nTransfer the vials immediately to a prechilled, slow-rate freezing container filled with 2-propanol and place the container at -80 °C overnight. Place the vials at -150 °C the next day for long-term storage.\n\t​NOTE: The liquid 2-Propanol is highly flammable and may cause eye damage upon contact. Keep away from heat and wear protective gloves as well as glasses.\n5. Maturation of hiPSC-derived neurons in monolayer cultures\nPrepare poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated culture dishes for the long-term cultivation of hiPSC-derived neurons.\n\t\nDilute the poly-L-ornithine stock solution to 0.001% in 1x DPBS (-/-) and coat the dishes overnight at 4 °C, or for 4 h at 37 °C. Aspirate the poly-L-ornithine solution and wash the plates once with 1x DPBS (-/-).\nDilute the laminin solution in 1x DPBS (-/-) to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL and incubate the dishes overnight at 4 °C, or for 4 h at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: A volume of 0.1-0.15 mL per cm2 is recommended for the coating procedures, and 0.2 mL per cm2 for all respective washing steps. Alternative coating substrates can be used, but potential effects on cell attachment and maturation should be evaluated.\nThaw the cryopreserved cells. For this, place the cryovial in a water bath (set to 37 °C) and swirl it for approximately 1 min, until a small clump of frozen cell suspension is left.",
    "Carefully transfer the cell suspension dropwise to a 15 mL tube prepared with 10 mL of prewarmed NBM. Rinse the cryovial with 1 mL of NBM and transfer the cell suspension to the identical 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 1-2 mL of NIM supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\nResuspend the cell pellet carefully and determine the cell numbers.\nAspirate the remaining laminin solution from the coated cell culture dishes and seed the cells at a seeding density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2  in NIM supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\nSwitch the medium after 24 h to NIM without ROCK inhibitor.\nPerform daily medium changes for 4 days.\nAfter this initial phase of NGN2 induction, omit the DOX and culture the cells in NBM, with half-media changes 2x a week until reaching the desired stage of maturation.\n\tNOTE: Co-culturing of iNGN2 neurons with astrocytes is recommended to increase cell survival, attachment, maturity, and electrical activity13,22.\n6. Characterization of hiPSC-derived neurons\nNOTE: Differentiation into neuronal derivatives can be evaluated by the following techniques.\nImmunocytochemistry and imaging\n\t\nAspirate the medium from the hiPSC-derived neurons and wash the cells once with 1x DPBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (+/+).\n\t\tNOTE: Pipette carefully, preferentially on the well edges as cells may detach very easily from the surface. A volume of 0.2 mL per cm2 is recommended for all washing steps to ensure a complete coverage of cells with 1x DPBS (+/+).\nFix the neuronal cells using a fixation solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS (+/+) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). A volume of 0.1 mL per cm2 is recommended.",
    "NOTE: Paraformaldehyde (4%) in DPBS is a hazardous and skin irritating solution with acute toxicity and potential carcinogenicity. Keep away from heat, wear protective gloves and glasses, avoid inhalation, and use the solution only in a ventilated environment.\nGently rinse the cells 2x in 1x DPBS (+/+) and proceed with staining.\n\t\tNOTE: Fixed cells can be stored in DPBS (+/+) at 4 °C for up to 1 month until further processing.\nAspirate the DPBS (+/+) from samples. Permeabilize the cells and block non-specific binding sites with 1x DPBS (+/+) containing 1% BSA and 0.2% Triton-X-100 for 60 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: A volume of 0.2 mL per cm2 is recommended.\nRemove the supernatant and incubate the cells overnight at 4 °C, with respective primary antibodies diluted in staining buffer (1x DPBS [+/+] containing 1% BSA) (see Table of Materials). Ensure that the cells are completely covered by solution.\n\t\tNOTE: A volume of 0.1-0.15 mL per cm2 is recommended.\nAspirate the staining buffer and rinse the cells 3x in 1x DPBS (+/+).\nDilute the corresponding secondary antibodies (see Table of Materials) in staining buffer at a final concentration of 1:1,000.\nIncubate the cells in diluted antibody solution for 1 h at RT in the dark. Ensure that the cells are completely covered by solution.\n\t\tNOTE: A volume of 0.1-0.15 mL per cm2 is recommended.\nAspirate the secondary antibody solution and rinse the cells 2x in 1x DPBS (+/+).\nCounterstain the nuclei with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), diluted in DPBS (+/+) for 5 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: A working volume of 0.1-0.15 mL per cm2 is recommended.\nRinse the cells 2x in 1x DPBS (+/+).\nStore the cells in DPBS (+/+) at 4 °C until imaging.",
    "NOTE: Brightfield imaging is suitable to track morphological changes and neurite outgrowth. In addition, stereotypic marker expression can be assessed by fluorescence microscopy. While undifferentiated hiPSCs express OCT 3/4 and NANOG, beta-III-tubulin (TUBB3) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) may serve as neuronal markers for visualizing neurites and axons. The neuritic network can be further assessed by determining the neurite length in brightfield or fluorescent images.\nGene expression analyses by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\n\t\nAspirate the medium and rinse the cells once in 1x DPBS (-/-).\n\t\tNOTE: A volume of 0.2 mL per cm2 is recommended.\nAdd cold RNA lysis buffer and harvest the cells by scratching.\nIsolate the RNA using a suitable column-based kit, and determine the RNA concentrations by UV photospectrometry.\nGenerate cDNA using 250 ng of total RNA and a suitable kit for reverse transcription.\nPrepare molecular beacon qPCR reactions containing 2.5 ng of cDNA in duplicate. Use an appropriate master mix and corresponding primer assays20 (see Table of Materials).\nRun the qPCR by applying 45 cycles with primer annealing at 60 °C for 20 s.\nNormalize relative gene expression levels to the mean of the housekeeping genes GAPDH, HPRT1, and GUSB. Apply the ΔΔCt method23, using undifferentiated hiPSCs as the calibrator."
