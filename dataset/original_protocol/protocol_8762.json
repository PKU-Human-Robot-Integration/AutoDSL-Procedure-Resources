    "1. Instruments, Culture Media, and Dishes\nUse a microscope that is capable of keeping the sample in focus and that is equipped with an automatic stage. Build a custom-made lid heater or purchase a commercial solution. Set up an LED-EMCCD camera system in which the exposure of the camera triggers LED illumination through a TTL signal using manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNote: See Discussion for details.\nPolydimethylsiloxan (PDMS) stamps:\n\t\nFabricate PDMS stamps in a microfluidics facility or have the PDMS stamps produced by a commercial foundry. To use a commercial foundry, send an autocad file to the company and specify the depth (15 µm, for example) of the device. After delivery from the foundry, cut the PDMS chip into its 16 stamps using a scalpel.\nBond each individual stamp to a glass slide using air plasma. For bonding, expose both the PDMS stamp and the glass slide to air plasma for about 1 min (using the highest plasma settings at 0.5 mbar). Ensure that the surfaces for bonding face upwards during plasma treatment. Then, place the PDMS stamp onto the glass slide.\nTake a 3.5 cm bottom dish and cut out a square area of 18 x 18 mm from the center of the bottom of the dish using a vertical milling machine and sharp rotary cutters. Use low rotation speed of the cutter and slow feeding to prevent the plastic from melting due to heat produced by friction. Prepare several dishes at once.\n\tNote: The bottom dish can be reused many times after the experiment if it is cleaned after soaking in pure ethanol O/N.\nAgarose:",
    "Dissolve 3 g high-melting point agarose in 100 ml S-Basal (5.85 g NaCl, 1 g K2HPO4, 6 g KH2PO4, 1 ml cholesterol (5 mg/ml in ethanol), H2O to 1 L, sterilize by autoclaving) by boiling. Make aliquots of the dissolved agarose in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and store. Also, prepare a batch of low-melting point agarose exactly the same way as the high-melting point agarose.\nPrior to use, place 3 aliquots of high-melting point agarose onto a heating block at 95 - 98 °C. Prior to use, place one aliquot of low-melting point agarose onto a heating block at 95 - 98 °C until it has melted and then onto a heating block at 30 - 35 °C.\n2. Selection of Animals\nGrow worms at a low density on seeded NGM plates to obtain clean animals. Make sure that there is plenty of food and only few animals on the plate.\nFor imaging L1 larvae, transfer about 30 eggs containing embryos at the pretzel stage onto a fresh seeded NGM plate. For transferring later larval stages or adult C. elegans, transfer about 30 worms onto a fresh seeded NGM plate.\n3. Preparation of Agarose Microchambers\nPreparation of the dish:\n\t\nTake a plastic dish with a square opening of 18 x 18 mm at the bottom and place it upside down with the opening facing upwards. Close the opening by placing a piece of double-sided sticky tape of 20 x 20 mm onto the opening. Turn the dish around so that the sticky tape is on the bottom and place the dish onto a hard surface. Cut the opening free using a scalpel.",
    "Using a P1000 pipette, fill 2 ml of 3% high-melting point agarose in S-Basal into the dish. Place the agarose onto the area that surrounds the opening and let solidify. Wait until the agarose is solid.\nTurn around the dish and peel off the protective film that covers the double-sided sticky tape so that the sticky side will remain on the dish and will be exposed.\n\t\tNote: As a result, a fine ring of sticky tape will surround the outside of the opening. The agarose serves as a moisture reservoir that will later surround the sample.\nCasting of microchambers:\n\t\nExpose the PDMS surface for molding with air plasma for 20 - 60 sec.\n\t\tNote: This plasma treatment renders the PDMS surface hydrophilic, which prevents the trapping of air bubbles and produces sharper prints.\nConstruct two spacers of equal height by stacking 5 - 9 glass slides. Place, in parallel to their long sides, the first spacer stack, then a single glass slide, then again a spacer stack. Place the glass slide that contains the PDMS stamp orthogonally across the spacers. Adjust the height of the spacers so that there is a space of about 1.5 mm between the molding surface of the PDMS stamp and the single glass slide.\nPlace a drop of hot liquid high-melting point agarose onto the single glass slide near the PDMS stamp and quickly slide the PDMS stamp vertically into the liquid agarose. Let the agarose solidify. Check that it gets an opaque appearance, which usually takes about 2 min. Pull off the stamp vertically with one move.\n\t\tNote: It is convenient to glue the spacer slides together with double-sided sticky tape. The vertical movement of the stamp prevents air bubbles from getting trapped in the agarose.",
    "Transfer the eggs or worms together with OP50 bacteria onto the agarose using a fine platinum wire pick. Distribute one egg or one worm per chamber together with food using an eyelash. Fill around 30 eggs onto one agarose pad.\nCut the agarose slab containing the filled microchambers into a square of about 15 x 15 mm so that it fits nicely into the opening of the dish. Pick up the square agarose slab with forceps and place it upside down onto a glass coverslip of 20 x 20 mm. Once dropped, do not lift it up again or slide it around because this may cause the bacteria and worms to be pushed out of their chambers.\nAssembly of the dish:\n\t\nPlace the glass coverslip onto the opening of the plastic dish. Gently press down the glass coverslip onto the ring made of double-sided sticky tape. Take care not to break the glass.\nTurn the dish upside down and use a P1000 pipette to fill the gap between the agar slab containing the microchambers and the agarose reservoir with liquid low-melting point agarose cooled to about 30 °C. Wait until the agarose has solidified.\nSeal the dish with a lid. For inverted microscopes use a heated lid. For upright microscopes use a normal lid and seal the dish with Parafilm.\nAfter finishing the preparation of microchambers, check them under a stereomicroscope. The correct filling is crucial. See the Discussion for details.\n4. Calcium Imaging\nUse transgenic strains expressing genetically encoded calcium sensors such as HBR16 (goeIs5[pnmr-1::SL1-GCaMP3.35-SL2::unc-54-3'UTR, unc-119(+)])27.",
    "Use a compound microscope equipped for wide-field epifluorescence. Connect the TTL output of the EMCCD camera to the TTL input of the LED, so that each time the camera records a frame the sample will be illuminated. Use an exposure time of about 5 msec. Use EM gain in the range of 50 - 300.\nSpecify a burst movie running for 24 hr with each worm being imaged every 15 - 30 min first for 20 sec with DIC, then for 20 sec with a GFP fluorescence to record GCaMP, and then take a final image of the mKate2 signal is taken to control for expression levels. Use a frame rate of 2/sec during each burst.\nFor visual data inspection, use a false-color map to enhance the visibility of small changes in fluorescence intensity. Plot fluorescent data as ΔF/F, with F being the average baseline value of fluorescence. A detailed description of calcium data analysis can be found in the literature20.\n5. Parallel AMI of Multiple Worms\nPlace the dish containing the microchambers onto the microscope, focus on the sample and engage the autofocus. Set up a software protocol so that the camera acquires a burst of 40 image frames in 20 sec every half an hour for 24 hr, which will result in 1,920 frames per worm, a reasonable amount of data. Set up the scan so that it visits each worm using the stage. Aim to film about 30 worms in one run.\nImage multiple worms by zooming out, i.e., using a lower magnification. Use a lower magnification to cover several microchambers with the camera chip and film several adjacent microchambers simultaneously. After the end of image acquisition, separate the data for each individual chamber by cropping a region of interest covering one animal.",
    "To quickly assess mobility data, use frame subtraction28-32.\n6. Imaging Different Life Stages of C. elegans\nUse agarose microchambers for all life stages of C. elegans from L1 to adult and including dauers. Use the appropriate chamber dimensions for different life stages that are shown in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nLife stage,Chamber size,Chamber depth,Typical recording time,Magnification\nL1,190 x 190 μm,10 - 15 μm,egg - mid L2,400X\nL2,370 x 370 μm,15 μm,egg - L3,200X\nDauer larva,370 x 370 μm,25 μm,4 days,200X\nL3,700 x 700 μm,45 μm,L2 - L4,200X\nL4,700 x 700 μm,45 μm,young L4 - young adult,100X\nYoung adult,700 x 700 μm,45 μm,12 - 24 hr,100X\nTable 1.
