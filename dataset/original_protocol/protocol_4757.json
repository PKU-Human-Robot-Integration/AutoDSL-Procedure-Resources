    "Predicting the structure of a peptide-protein complex with the fully blind docking protocol pepATTRACT requires the following steps:Installing the ATTRACT software (www.attract.ph.tum.de/services/ATTRACT/attract.tgz[href=http://www.attract.ph.tum.de/services/ATTRACT/attract.tgz]) and a molecular viewer.Obtaining the protein structure and the sequence of the peptide of interest.Generating a docking script and docking files with the pepATTRACT web interface (www.attract.ph.tum.de/peptide.html[href=http://www.attract.ph.tum.de/peptide.html]).Running the docking script on the user’s local machine.Instructions and the main parts of the pepATTRACT docking protocol are visualized in Figure 1.In the following, the individual steps are described in more detail.Installation of the ATTRACT softwareThe user can choose between building and installing ATTRACT directly from the source code or downloading an ATTRACT virtual machine (VM). The virtual machine has ATTRACT and all its dependencies installed. Note that ATTRACT can only be installed on Unix-based OS (Linux/Mac). The ATTRACT VM can be used on a large number of operating systems including Windows, Linux, Macintosh and Solaris (the following instructions for the ATTRACT VM are valid for all operating systems).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602155504_7888.jpgFigure 1. A flow chart illustrating the usage of the pepATTRACT docking protocol and its web interfaceInstructions for ATTRACT VMDownload and install VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org[href=http://www.virtualbox.org]), any version can be used.Download the ATTRACT VM from www.attract.ph.tum.de/services/ATTRACT/ATTRACT.vdi.gz[href=http://www.attract.ph.tum.de/services/ATTRACT/ATTRACT.vdi.gz] and unpack the file.Open the VirtualBox program. Add the ATTRACT.vdi file to VirtualBox (click the “New” button, pick the option “Use an existing virtual hard disk file” and select the ATTRACT.vdi file, follow the instructions). Start the virtual machine to use ATTRACT.Instructions for installing ATTRACT from source codeExample commands are given for Ubuntu OS 14.04.Download the ATTRACT source code from www.attract.ph.tum.de/services/ATTRACT/attract.tgz[href=http://www.attract.ph.tum.de/services/ATTRACT/attract.tgz.].Open a terminal and unpack the source code (tar xzf attract.",
    "tgz)Install g++ and gfortran (sudo apt-get install g++ gfortran)Install numpy and scipy (sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy)Install pdb2pqr (sudo apt-get install pdb2pqr)Go into attract/bin, type make clean and then make all or make all -j 4 (if you have 4 cores)Edit your .bashrc file and add the following lines to it:Export ATTRACTDIR=/home/yourname/attract/bin *(i.e. wherever you installed attract)*Export ATTRACTTOOLS=$ATTRACTDIR/../toolsExport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/share/pdb2pqrType source ~/.bashrc Installation of a molecular viewerThe molecular viewer PyMOL can be installed on Ubuntu by entering sudo apt-get install pymol in the terminal. Open a PDB file with it by typing pymol myprotein.pdb.Input preparationThe user has to supply an atomic 3D structure of the protein of interest in PDB file format.Alternatively, good homology models with sufficient sequence similarity can be used. Using a sequence alignment, such models can be built with programs like MODELLER (Eswar et al., 2014). Homology models can also be found in public databases; e.g., ModBase (modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi[href=http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi]), the Protein Model Portal (www.proteinmodelportal.org[href=http://www.proteinmodelportal.org]) or the Protein Model Data Base (bioinformatics.cineca.it/PMDB[href=https://bioinformatics.cineca.it/PMDB/]). Investigations on structural deviations of homology models have shown that good models can be generated for sequence identities of e.g., > 40% (accuracy statistics of EVA at pdg.cnb.uam.es/eva/cm/res/accuracy.html; Eyrich et al., 2001; Rodrigues et al., 2013). Note that the docking protocol is quite sensitive to structural changes of the docking partners and hence it is sensitive to structural deviations in the input structure resulting from incorrect homology modeling. At the moment, unnatural and modified amino acids (e.g., post-translational modifications) are not supported and have to be removed from the input PDB file or mutated to standard amino acids manually (see Note 2). We are working towards adding support for modified amino acids to pepATTRACT in the next ATTRACT release.Generating the docking script and executing itGo to www.attract.ph.tum.de/peptide.html[href=http://www.attract.ph.tum.de/peptide.html] (Figure 2).Upload the PDB file of the protein.",

Screenshot of the pepATTRACT web interface with instructionsIncluding experimental information The web interface offers the possibility to include experimental information in the docking run and restrict the search for the peptide binding site to a portion of the protein’s surface. If certain protein residues are known to be important in peptide binding e.g., from mutational experiments, they can be specified as active residues. This will ensure that only solutions in which these residues are in contact with the peptide are generated. Multiple residues can be specified as active residues separated by commas. There is no limit on the number of possible active residues, however, keep in mind that the more residues are specified the less specific the search gets while increasing the computational load.Protein conformational changeMany proteins undergo conformational changes when binding to a partner molecule. Although this is less common for peptide-protein than for protein-protein interactions, it influences the prediction quality of this semi-rigid peptide docking approach strongly. The pepATTRACT protocol allows to include conformational change on the protein side by providing an ensemble of possible conformations. This option is also useful if the protein structure has been derived from template-based homology modeling. Instead of uploading a PDB file containing a single protein structure to the web interface, the user can upload a multi-model PDB file and then has to specify the number of conformers present in the uploaded multi-model PDB file (web interface field “if the PDB is a multi-model ensemble, specify the number of conformers”).",
    "In a multi-model PDB file, different structures of the protein are separated by MODEL and ENDMDL lines. For more information on the format please visit deposit.rcsb.org/adit/docs/pdb_atom_format.html - MODEL. Please note that all the conformers need to have the same sequence and coordinate information for the same residues in the same order. Unfortunately, predicting conformational change upon binding is very difficult due to the large number of degrees of freedoms involved. Protein flexibility can be tested to a certain degree by performing molecular dynamics simulations or normal mode calculations prior to docking.AnalysisThe final models are converted to PDB file format for visual inspection by the user (type pymol results.pdb to look at the structures). The final structures could then be further refined in molecular dynamics simulations (Schindler et al., 2015a). The web interface offers the opportunity to benchmark pepATTRACT’s performance by docking previously experimentally resolved peptide-protein complexes and evaluating how accurate the experimental structure can be reproduced. For this, reference PDB files containing the protein structure and the peptide structure can be uploaded. Standard evaluation criteria like ligand-RMSD, interface-RMSD and fraction of native contacts (Mendez et al., 2005) can be selected for automatic computation (results.lrmsd, results.irmsd, results.fnat) (see also Note 1).Docking protocol description The web interface generates an archive containing the PDB files and a bash script (yourruname.sh). The bash script contains all the commands necessary to run the fully blind peptide-protein docking protocol pepATTRACT for a given protein structure and peptide sequence. The docking protocol consists of the following steps (Figure 1). First, three peptide model structures are generated from sequence (α-helical, extended and poly-proline conformation) (Tien et al., 2013). This approach is supported by the experimental observation that this limited set of three motifs dominates the conformational ensemble that peptides adopt in peptide-protein complexes (London et al.",
    ", 2010) and has also been successfully used in the HADDOCK peptide docking protocol (Trellet et al., 2013). Then global rigid body docking with ATTRACT using a coarse-grained force field is performed (Zacharias, 2003; May and Zacharias, 2008). The ATTRACT coarse-grained force field uses soft distance-dependent Lennard-Jones (LJ)-type potentials with attractive or repulsive parameters and electrostatics between charged residues to calculate the interaction energy between residue types A and B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160602/20160602160718_8637.jpgNotes: The ATTRACT energy/score is only used to compare/rank different docking models, it does not represent a measure for peptide binding affinity. In the coarse-grained docking stage, the internal structure of the protein and the peptide are kept rigid and only orientational and translational degrees of freedoms are explored (6 rigid body degrees of freedom). The energy calculations are accelerated by a precalculated grid (de Vries et al., 2015). The rigid body docking solutions are rescored and ranked by ATTRACT score. The top ranked models can then be refined with the flexible interface refinement method iATTRACT (Schindler et al., 2015b).In the refinement stage, the models are subjected to a simultaneous optimization of their global rigid body degrees of freedom and of the local position of the interface atoms."
