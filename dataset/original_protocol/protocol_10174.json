    "1. Synthesis of Hydrazide-functionalized Polymers\nNote: The following specific recipe is provided for the PNIPAM-mimetic thermoresponsive POEGMA precursor polymer (PO10) with 30 mol% hydrazide functionalization. PNIPAM and POEGMA precursor polymers with different phase transition temperatures can be prepared using this same general method but modifying the type and ratio of the core monomers used (see section 1.2 for modifications for various POEGMA polymers)21,25,27.\nWeigh out 37 mg of 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionate) (AIBMe, initiator), 3.1 g of diethylene glycol methacrylate (M(EO)2MA), 0.9 g of oligoethyleneglycol methacrylate (OEGMA475, 475 g/mol n=7-8 ethylene oxide repeat units), 523 µL of acrylic acid (AA, comonomer), and 7.5 µL of thiolglycolic acid (TGA, chain transfer agent) into a 20 mL glass scintillation vial.\nFor PO0 (room temperature transition temperature POEGMA), use 4.0 g of M(EO)2MA (no OEGMA475). For PO100 (no transition temperature POEGMA), use 4.0 g of OEGMA475 (no M(EO)2MA).\n\tNote: Intermediate phase transition temperatures can be achieved based on the use of intermediate mixtures of M(EO)2MA and OEGMA475, according to Lutz et al.23\nDissolve all reagents in dioxane (5 mL/g total monomer) in a round bottom flask with one or more necks.\nPurge the reaction with nitrogen (UHP grade) flow for 30 min.\nOnce purged, place the flask in a pre-heated oil bath maintained at 75 °C for 4 h under nitrogen and 400 rpm magnetic stirring.\nAfter 4 h, remove the solvent using a rotary evaporator set to 50 °C and 200 rpm.\nDissolve the resulting polymer product in 150 mL of deionized water.\nAdd adipic acid dihydrizide (ADH) at a five-fold molar excess to the number of AA residues incorporated into the polymer (in this example, AA comprises 29 mol% of the monomer units in the polymers produced, as per conductometric titration).\nAdjust the pH of the solution to pH 4.75 using 0.1 M HCl.",
    "Once the pH has stabilized, add N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) at a 5-fold molar excess to the number of AA residues present).\nMaintain the reaction pH 4.75 with dropwise addition of 0.1 M HCl over 4 h.\nLeave the reaction to stir overnight.\nPour the product solution into three ~30 cm long dialysis tubes (3500 Da molecular weight cut-off, 1 inch thickness), using a funnel to minimize spillage. Use a pinch clamp to close the bottom of the tube prior to filling by folding a small (~2 cm) segment of the tube to improve the clamp integrity; repeat at the top (pressing to remove air bubbles) when filling is complete. Place the tubes inside a 100-fold excess volume of deionized water and leave for at least 6 h, fully replacing the water over six cycles of dialysis to achieve desired purity.\nLyophilize the dialyzed sample to obtain a final dried polymer product.\n2. Synthesis of Aldehyde-functionalized Polymers\nSynthesis of Aldehyde-Precursor Monomer N-(2,2-Dimethoxyethyl) Methacrylate (DMEMA)\n\t\nPlace 200 mL of a 20% w/v NaOH solution into a 500 mL 3 neck round-bottom flask.\nCool the solution in an ice bath and maintain a temperature of 0 °C with ice during the reaction.\nAdd 50 mL of aminoacetyl aldehyde dimethyl acetal to the cooled NaOH solution.\nAdd in 0.1 g of TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl) and stir at 400 rpm using a magnetic stir bar until the TEMPO fully dissolves.\nAdd 48 mL of methacryloyl chloride dropwise using a burette over 2 h.\nAfter 2 h, cover the reaction vessel with aluminum foil and leave to stir overnight.\nExtract the product by adding the reaction product to 75 mL of petroleum ether in a 1 L separation funnel, shaking, degassing, and discarding the top layer.",
    "Repeat step 2.1.7 three times by adding the bottom layer product from each extraction step as the raw product to the next extraction cycle.\nRemove the final bottom layer product and transfer to a 100 mL beaker.\nAdd ~5 g magnesium sulfate (Mg2SO4) to beaker with monomer until a \"snow globe\" effect is observed.\nFilter through a 100 mL Buchner funnel to remove the Mg2SO4.\nRinse the beaker twice with ~75 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether, pouring the rinse solution through the funnel each time.\nTransfer the product to a 500 mL round-bottom flask and evaporate the solvent using a rotary evaporator at room temperature 200 RPM to collect the final product.\nSynthesis of Aldehyde-Functionalized Polymers\n\t​Note: The following specific recipe is provided for the PNIPAM-mimetic POEGMA precursor polymer (PO10) with 30 mol% aldehyde functionalization. PNIPAM and POEGMA precursor polymers with different phase transition temperatures can be prepared using the same general method but modifying the type and ratio of the core monomers used (see section 1.2 for modifications for various POEGMA polymers)21,25,27.\n\t\nWeigh out 37 mg of 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionate) (AIBMe), 3.10 g of diethylene glycol methacrylate M(EO)2MA, 0.1 g of oligo ethyleneglycol methacrylate (OEGMA475, 475 g/mol, n=7-8 ethylene oxide repeat units), 1.30 g of N-(2,2-dimethoxyethyl) acrylamide (DMEMA) and 7.5 µL of thiolglycolic acid (TGA) into a 20 mL glass scintillation vial.\nFor PO0 (room temperature transition temperature POEGMA), use 4.0 g of M(EO)2MA (no OEGMA475). For PO100 (no transition temperature POEGMA), use 4.0 g of OEGMA475 (no M(EO)2MA).\n\t\tNote: Intermediate phase transition temperatures can be achieved based on the use of intermediate mixtures of M(EO)2MA and OEGMA475, according to Lutz et al.23\nDissolve all reagents in dioxane (5 mL/g total monomer) in a round bottom flask with one or more necks.",
    "Purge the reaction with nitrogen (UHP grade) flow for 30 min.\nOnce purged, place flask in a pre-heated oil bath maintained at 75 °C for 4 h under nitrogen and 400 rpm magnetic stirring.\nAfter 4 h, remove the solvent using a rotary evaporator set to 50 °C and 200 rpm.\nDissolve the resulting polymer product in 100 mL of deionized H2O.\nAdd 50 mL of 1 M HCl into the dissolved solution and stir under magnetic stirring (400 RPM) for 24 h to fully hydrolyze the acetal functionalities in DMEMA.\nAfter reaction completion, transfer the polymer solution into dialysis tubing, as per step 1.13.\nLyophilize the dialyzed sample to obtain a final dried polymer product.\n3. Fabrication of Hydrazone Crosslinked Bulk Hydrogels\nDissolve hydrazide and aldehyde functionalized polymers separately in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or any desired aqueous buffer, to create solutions of desired concentrations.\n\tNote: Mass concentrations between 5-40 wt% are typically used, with gelation at lower concentrations possible if higher functional group fractions are present on the polymers.\nUsing a single barrel syringe to transfer the solutions, load each precursor solution (~1 mL each) into separate barrels of a double barrel syringe (2.5 mL volume, 1:1 ratio syringe) attached to a static mixer (1.5\" length) and (optionally) a syringe (typically 18 G, 1.5” length for in vitro studies) and (optionally) a syringe (typically 18 G, 1.5” length for in vitro studies).\nPrepare molds of desired thickness, shape, and diameter by punching holes into a silicone rubber sheet.\n\tNote: In a typical experiment, a standard punch set is used to punch a 7 mm diameter cylindrical hole inside a 1/16\" thick silicone rubber sheet (total volume of reservoir ~300 µL).",
    "Mount the silicone mold on a standard glass microscope slide such that the holes punched in the mold are completely backed by glass.  A 0.1 M HCl wash of the glass is recommended but not required prior to mounting of the silicone mold.\nCo-extrude the double barrel syringe contents through the static mixer to completely fill (or slightly overfill, with a meniscus at the top) the silicone mold.\n\tNote: Multiple samples can be prepared during one extrusion sample provided the gelation time is on the same order of magnitude or longer than the total time required to fill multiple molds.\nPlace another standard glass microscope slide on top of the mold and wait for the gelation to complete.\n\tNote: The standard recipes described in the synthesis section gel within <1 minute; slower gelation times (and thus longer required wait times) are observed at lower functional group densities, lower polymer concentrations and/or higher fractions of OEGMA475 relative to M(EO)2MA (for POEGMA hydrogels).\nRemove the top microscope slide and use a spatula to push the hydrogel away from the silicone rubber mold.\nLift the mold from lower microscope slide to recover the hydrogels for further testing.\n4. Fabrication of Hydrazone Crosslinked Gel Microparticles\nFabrication of Microfluidic Chip\n\t\nDehydrate a silicon wafer (D = 76.2 mm, 380 µm thickness, P-doped, <100> orientation) by heating on a hotplate at 200 °C for 5 min.\nCenter the wafer on a spin coater and coat a ~100 µm thick layer of SU-8 100 photoresist by applying ~7 mL of SU-8 resist, ramping the spin speed up to 3000 rpm at a rate of 500 rpm/s, and then holding the speed at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds.\nPre-bake the coating at 65 °C for 10 min and then soft-bake the coating at 95 °C for 30 min.",
    "Print a photomask on a transparency with the microfluidic pattern defined by Figure 2A, such that the transparent sections are the desired pattern of the polymerized photoresist layer.\nInsert the photoresist-coated silicon wafer and the photomask in a mask aligner and expose the wafer to 365 nm light for 95 s (6.5 W exposure power).\nBake the patterned wafer for 10 min at 95 °C, first by placing it on a hotplate at 65 °C and subsequently heating the hotplate to 95 °C at 10 °C/min.\nRemove the wafer from the hotplate and place in a 500 mL beaker containing 100 mL SU-8 developer for at least 10 min, swirling the wafer slowly in the solution throughout to remove non-exposed photoresist. After 10 min, rinse the patterned wafer with isopropanol and dry with air. Store the patterned wafer in a cool, dry environment away from light when not in use for soft lithography replica molding.\nPlace the patterned microfluidic mold in a Petri dish. Position ~10 mm lengths of L/S 13 silicone tubing on the inlets and outlets of the chip.\nPour ~10 mL of poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS; prepared by mixing Silicone Elastomer Base and Silicone Elastomer Curing Agent in a 10:1 ratio) on top of the chip, carefully avoiding incorporating any PDMS within the placed silicone tubing.\nPlace the Petri dish in a vacuum chamber for ~10 min to remove air bubbles persisting in and around the patterned structure during curing.\nCure the PDMS by placing the Petri dish containing the patterned mold and uncured PDMS on a hotplate at 85 °C for 2-3 h.\nCarefully peel off the cured PDMS from the patterned silicon wafer to expose the soft lithographic patterned PDMS replica of the microfluidic mold.",
    "Place the patterned PDMS and a glass slide upside-down in a high-power plasma cleaner with an air feed. Apply the plasma at 200 mTorr and 45 W for 90 s to bond the PDMS to the glass slide and create the final microfluidic chip.\nSynthesis of Gel Microparticles\n\t\nPrepare hydrazide-functionalized PNIPAM (PNIPAM-Hzd) by dissolving NIPAM (4.5g), acrylic acid (0.5 g - 15 mol% total monomer), thioglycolic acid (TGA, 80 µL), and 2,2-azobisisobutyric acid dimethyl ester (AIBME, 0.056 g) in 20 mL of anhydrous ethanol and subsequently following steps 1.4-1.14 to complete the synthesis, although changing the reaction temperature to 56 °C in step 1.5.\nPrepare aldehyde-functionalized PNIPAM (PNIPAM-Ald) by dissolving NIPAM (4 g), N-(2,2-dimethoxyethyl)methacrylate (DMEMA, 0.95 g - 13.4 mol% total monomer), thioglycolic acid (TGA, 80 µL), and 2,2-azobisisobutyric acid dimethyl ester (AIBME, 0.056 g) in 20 mL of ethanol and subsequently following steps 2.2.4-2.2.10 to complete the synthesis, although changing the reaction temperature to 56 °C in step 2.2.5.\nDissolve PNIPAM-Hzd and PNIPAM-Ald at 6 wt% in deionized water and load into separate standard 5 mL syringes.\nDissolve 1 wt% nonionic surfactant (e.g., Span 80) in heavy paraffin oil and load the solution into a standard 60 mL syringe.\nConnect the two precursor polymer solution syringes individually to the two separate polymer inlet channels on the microfluidic chip and the paraffin oil solution to the oil inlet channel on the microfluidic chip via 1/32” ID silicone tubing (~30 cm length per inlet, ~45 cm length per outlet).",
    "Using two seperate infusion syringe pumps (one for the oil upstream, one for the oil added after the nozzle), deliver the oil into the chip at a flow rate between 1.1 mL/h and 5.5 mL/h without starting the polymer flow to prime the chip and ensure the chip is defect-free and operational (typically maintained over a 30 min period).\nUsing a separate infusion syringe pump, deliver each of the aqueous polymer solutions to the chip at a flow rate of 0.03 mL/h.\nFollowing an initial stabilization period to ensure that the flow has equilibrated and uniform particles are formed (30 min - 1 h), collect the particles in a magnetically stirred round bottom flask.\nCollect the particles until all oil is consumed (12-55 h, depending on flow). Stop the syringe pumps and, if desired, immediately pump water in place of the precursor polymer solutions through the chip to clean.  However, given the rapid in situ gelation of these materials when the flow is stopped, it is recommended to use a new chip for each separate experiment.\nTurn off the magnetic stirring and allow the gel microparticles to settle. Decant off all available paraffin oil using a pipette.\nTo remove the remaining paraffin oil, wash the gel microparticles  with pentane (applied at a volume of 10 mL for every 0.5 mL of microparticle volume), vigorously mix the emulsion for ~ 1 minute, allow the gel microparticles to re-settle for ~1-2 hours, and decant off the residual organic phase using a pipette. Repeat at least 5 times to ensure full paraffin oil removal.\nResuspend the gel microparticles  in 10 mL deionized water inside a 20 mL glass scintillation vial and purge the vial with nitrogen overnight to remove any residual pentane.\n5.

Prepare PNIPAM-Hzd and PNIPAM-Ald as described in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, respectively.\nHeat a 5 mL aliquot of the PNIPAM-Hzd stock solution to 70˚C using an oil bath under magnetic stirring (350 RPM) inside a 20 mL glass scintillation vial.\n\tNOTE: The solution should become opaque (i.e. the temperature exceeds the lower critical solution temperature of PNIPAM-Hzd), but no visible precipitate should be formed.\nAdd a 0.25 mL aliquot of PNIPAM-Ald (5-20 wt% of the mass of PNIPAM-Hzd present in the seed solution) drop-wise into the heated PNIPAM-Hzd solution over a period of 5-10 s.\nContinue mixing the solution in the scintillation vials for an additional 15 minutes, after which remove the sample from the oil bath and allow the product to cool to room temperature overnight.\nDialyze the resulting nanogels over 6x6 hour cycles (using a 3500 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane) against deionized water to remove any non-crosslinked polymer. If desired, lyophilize for storage.\n6.
