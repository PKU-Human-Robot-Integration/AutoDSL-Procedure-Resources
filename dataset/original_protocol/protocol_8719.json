    "Note: The following is a step-by-step description of the experimental protocol we use to allow reliable triggering of aggression between pairs of male fruit flies (D. melanogaster). This procedure induces the formation of a \"loser\" effect. Using this protocol, a short-term \"winner\" effect also has been recently reported 5,6. Figure 1 shows the timeline of the behavioral experiments.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53395/53395fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Timeline of aggression experiment. On day 1, late-stage male pupae (when wings become black) are isolated in freshly prepared isolation vials. On day 5 after emerging as adults, 4 day-old male flies are anesthetized with CO2 and painted with different colors for identification purposes. On day 7, food cups and fighting chambers are prepared to set up the behavioral experiments. Two 6-7 day-old adult males are loaded into the chambers and are able to interact.

Day 1: Social Isolation of Pupae\nRaise and maintain fly stocks in an environmentally controlled 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle incubator at 25 °C and 50% relative humidity.\nPrepare isolation vials: Heat fresh fly food until melted. Using a Pasteur pipette, transfer approximately 1.5 ml of melted fly food into single empty glass test tubes (1.6 x 10 cm). Allow the food to solidify.\nIsolate pupae: With a fine paintbrush, gently remove a late-stage male pupa (when wings become black) from the stock vial and place it on the side of a freshly prepared food containing test tube. Close isolation vials with cotton (Figure 2).\nPlace isolation vials containing pupae into the 12 hr light/12 hr dark incubator at 25 °C and 50% relative humidity.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53395/53395fig2.jpg",

Day 5: Painting the Flies for Individual Identification Purposes\nPerform this step at day 5 with 4 day-old male flies and two days prior the behavioral experiments to minimize the negative effect of CO2 anesthesia.\nAnesthetize fly with CO2.\nWith a fine toothpick, place a small dot of acrylic paint on the thorax. Avoid placing paint on the head, wings, abdomen or legs (Figure 3).\nLet paint dry for approximately 10 sec, and gently transfer flies back to their original isolation vials.\nReturn isolation vials to the 12 hr light/12 hr dark incubator at 25 °C and 50% relative humidity.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53395/53395fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Individual identification. After anesthetizing a fly with CO2, a small drop of acrylic paint is applied on the thorax. For individual identification purpose, different colors are used (white and blue here). See discussion below about use of CO2 at this step. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53395/53395fig3large.jpg]\n3. Day 7: Preparing the Apparatus\nPrepare Food Cups:\n\t\nHeat fresh fly food until it melts.\nUsing a Pasteur pipette, transfer approximately 0.8 ml food to the lid of a screw cap vial (1.5 cm diameter, 1 cm height) and allow to cool. Avoid air bubbles.\nMake fresh yeast paste by mixing dry yeast with a few drops of water. When thick, apply a small drop of yeast paste to the center of the food cup surface with a toothpick (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53395/53395fig4.jpg",

Dry with paper towel before use.\nPlace a food cup in the center of each fighting chamber and fix in place with a drop of putty.\nCover fighting chambers with the apparatus lid (Figure 5).\nPlace the apparatus into a high-humidity environment (60%) at 25 °C.\nPlace a light source above the apparatus to illuminate the fighting chambers and set a video camera for recording from above.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53395/53395fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Preparing the individual fighting chamber. The freshly prepared food cup with a dot of yeast paste on the surface is fixed into washed individual fighting chambers. Chambers are closed with the two-piece cover allowing insertion of an opaque plastic divider into individual fighting chambers.

Day 7: Behavioral Experiment\nPerform the behavioral experiments with 6-7 day-old male flies.\nInsert plastic dividers into each fighting chamber.\nRemove the cotton plug from the isolation tube and position the tube below an open hole on the side of the apparatus.\nLet the fly enter into the fighting chamber by negative geotaxis, usually within a few seconds.\nClose the sliding wall after the fly has left the tube and entered the chamber.\nRepeat the procedure to introduce the second fly into the fight chamber on the other side of the apparatus.\nPlace the apparatus back in the illuminated videotaping position.",
    "Begin video recording and remove the plastic divider to allow flies to interact.\n\t\nFor Aggression Experiments:\n\t\t\nIn these experiments, record fights for at least 20 min to ensure the formation of strong dominance relationships.\nAfter the desired time, stop video recording.\nRemove flies from the fighting chambers by reversing the procedure described above.\nThoroughly wash the behavioral apparatus with mild detergent and water after each use and rinse.\nFor \"Loser\" Effect Experiments:\n\t\tNote: In these experiments, first fights are considered as the conditioning phase and second fights as the test phase. The period of rest between fights can differ but 10 min allows formation of a strong \"loser\" effect.\n\t\t\nFollow the procedure described above to perform a first fight.\nCRITICAL STEP: To induce the formation of a \"loser\" mentality, ensure that first fights are at least 20 min long in order to establish strong dominance relationships.  After 20 min, re-insert the plastic divider into fighting chambers to separate the flies.\nAfter a 10 min period of rest, gently remove the plastic divider to allow flies to interact for second fights.\nAt the end of the second 20 min fight, stop the video recording.\nRemove flies from behavioral chambers as above.\nOnce again, thoroughly clean the behavioral apparatus.\n5. Behavioral Analysis\nTransferring Movies\n\t\nConnect cameras to the computer.\nConvert flies .MTS to .mov flies and join movies clips together, using video converting software and the option \"join selected clips\".\nObserve and analyze each movie with video reader software.\nScoring Behavior\n\tNote: this can be done manually or using behavioral analysis program software if available. The illustration below describes a possible manual analysis for a \"loser\" effect.",
    "Score the time of the first encounter between the flies on the food cup (encounters are interactions between pairs of flies that last at least 2 sec) and the time of appearance of the first lunge (a behavioral pattern in which one fly rises high on its hind legs and snaps down on and attempts to grab the opponent). Then, score the latency to lunge (the interval between the first encounter and the first lunge).\nCount the total number of encounters and lunges during a fight.\n\t\tNote: If desired, one also can score other behavioral patterns, like wing threat, boxing, fencing, retreat or the numbers of encounters before the first lunge, for example.\nScore the time of establishment of dominance (time between the first encounter and the time when one fly retreats for three consecutive times off the food cup after receiving lunges). Note which fly is the winner and which the loser of the fight.\nCalculating a \"Loser\" Effect\n\t\nDivide the number of fights in which previous losers lose 2nd fights (Losers that lose: LL) by the total number of fights, and multiply by 100. The percentage obtained represents the \"loser\" effect:\n\t\t[(# flies LL) / (# total fight)] x 100\nUse a Chi-square test to compare whether the \"loser\" effect is statistically different from the expected value of 50%.\nSubscription Required.
