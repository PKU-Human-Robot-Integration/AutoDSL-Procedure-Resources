    "The MNTT was conducted according to the human research protocol approved by the ethics committee of the Affiliated Suzhou Science & Technology Town Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (IRB2021029).\n1. Preoperative evaluation\nCheck the medical history: Ensure that the patients have no coagulation abnormalities, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, skin disease, history of central venous catheterization, history of pacemaker implantation, neck and chest trauma, or surgical diseases.\nPerform physical examination results: Ensure symmetrical blood pressure in both upper limbs, good arterial pulse, strong pulsation, negative Allen test11, good venous distensibility after binding the tourniquet, no edema or varicose veins in the upper limb, and no previous central or peripheral venous scars.\nPerform comprehensive assessment of the forearm vasculature of the patient's operative limb by color Doppler ultrasound.\n2. Disinfection and anesthesia\nPlace the patient in the supine position with external rotation and abduction of the operative upper limb.\nPerform routine iodophor disinfection, draping, and local infiltration anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.\n3. Superficial fascia exposure\nMake a 4-cm skin incision (longitudinal incision) at a distance of <2 cm between the radial artery and the cephalic vein of the forearm, and ensure it is relatively close to the cephalic vein.\nSeparate the subcutaneous adipose tissue using curved hemostatic forceps to expose the superficial fascia. Look for the presence of the cephalic vein and its surrounding tissues below the superficial fascia (Figure 2a). Do not open the superficial fascia in this step and do not use the electric knife to stop the bleeding.\n4. Preparation of the cephalic vein",
    "Ensure that below the exposed superficial fascia, the cephalic vein (including part of the vasa vasorum) and its surrounding adipose tissue could be clearly seen.Make two tunnels along the direction perpendicular to the cephalic vein. The tunnel openings should be located >1 cm from both sides of the cephalic vein.\nPull the cephalic vein close to the radial artery by two blue vessel loops passing through the tunnels at each end to facilitate surgical suturing (Figure 2b).\n5. Preparation of the radial artery\nCut the tissue layer by layer to expose the radial artery pedicle (including the radial artery and its accompanying veins on both sides) in the pulsating area of the radial artery that can be reached with the index finger. Ligate the small artery branches and pick out the radial artery pedicle with the hemostatic forceps. Dissect the radial artery pedicle for about 40-50 mm.\nPass the two red vessel loops through each end of the radial artery pedicle. The radial artery could be pulled to be closer to the cephalic vein to facilitate the surgical suture (Figure 2c).\n6. Opening the cephalic vein and the radial artery\nPlace a vascular clamp along the tunnel at both ends of the cephalic vein to block the cephalic vein blood flow. Place a vascular clamp at each end of the pedicle to block arterial blood flow.\n\tNOTE: Although vascular clamps were used to block blood flow, the intact tissue is preserved around the cephalic vein, which plays a better protective role for the vessels.\nPull the red vessel loops to bring the radial artery pedicle closer to the cephalic vein, and an incision is made on the lateral wall corresponding to the radial artery and cephalic vein.",
    "Lift the superficial fascia at the cephalic vein gently with micro-forceps and cut the superficial fascia and the wall of the cephalic vein with a micro-scissor or sharp knife. The incision length should be about 8-10 mm.\n\tNOTE: Do not touch or mobilize the vein outside this incision.\nOpen the arterial sheath and the wall of the radial artery successively to make an 8-10-mm-long incision with a sharp knife and microscopic scissors, taking care not to twist the vessel. The incision is in the lateral wall of the artery.\n\tNOTE: Do not touch or mobilize the artery outside this incision.\nGently rinse the cephalic vein and radial artery with heparin saline solution (25 IU/mL) to remove any blood or blood clots.\n7. Functional end-to-side anastomosis\nUse the 7.0 non-absorbable single-strand suture to establish vein-arterial anastomosis (side-to-side) with the Kunlin's technique (Figure 2d, e). Suture the posterior wall of the vessel first, and then suture the anterior wall of the vessel. Pull the vessels close to each other to reduce vascular tension.\nOpen the blood flow and ligate the distal cephalic vein to form a functional end-to-side anastomosis (Figure 2f).\nEnsure that no obvious bleeding is detected in the surgical field and use a mattress suture for surgical incision.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62784/62784fig02.jpg\nFigure 2.
