    "Note: Perform all the cell culture-related work inside a sterile biosafety cabinet following standard aseptic technique. Preparation of Matrigel PlateThaw a vial of Matrigel overnight by submerging the vial in ice in a walk-in cold room.Place a box of sterile pipette tips (1,000 µl) and a glass-bottom black-wall 24-well plate on ice or ice pack for at least 15 min before handling Matrigel.Using a P1000 pipette, gently dispense 250 µl of Matrigel into each well without introducing any bubbles while keeping the plate on a flat ice pack.Incubate the plate at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator for 20-30 min to polymerize Matrigel.Add 500 µl/well of RPMI growth medium (see Recipes) containing 4% Matrigel to avoid further drying of the Matrigel beds.Keep the plate in the cell culture incubator until the mCherry-Ovcar5 cells are ready in Procedure B.Cell seeding and 3D cultureMaintain a 2D culture of mCherry-Ovcar5 cells in a T75 flask with RPMI growth medium in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Check the confluency of mCherry-Ovcar5 cells using an inverted light microscope. Use a plate that has 50%-80% confluency.Replace the existing culture medium from the flask with 10 ml DPBS and incubate for 10 min.Discard DPBS and add 2-3 ml of Trypsin-EDTA solution to the flask.Incubate for 3-5 min at 37 °C.Observe the plate under a light microscope to check if the cells come off the surface completely.Quench trypsin by adding 10 ml RMPI growth medium and resuspend the cells.Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 ml tube.Centrifuge the tube at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 10 ml RPMI growth medium.Determine the cell concentration using Beckman Coulter Counter by setting the cell size between 8-20 µm.",
    "Prepare 13 ml cell suspension in RPMI growth medium to achieve a concentration of 10,000 cells/500 µl.Add 500 µl of the cell suspension into each well of the 24-well plate resulting in the final concentration of 10,000 cells in 1 ml medium with 2% Matrigel.Incubate the plate for 7 days to allow 3D tumor nodule formation and replace the medium with fresh RPMI growth medium with 2% Matrigel on Day 4.In vitro Photodynamic therapyOn Day 7, observe the plate under an inverted light microscope to ensure the formation of the tumor nodules on the Matrigel beds (see Figure 1A).Prepare 13 ml of Visudyne working solution (see Recipes) by diluting Visudyne stock in RPMI growth medium to achieve 1 µM PS concentration.Protect the PS solution in the dark and perform the following steps in the dark or low-light environment.Set a very slow aspiration speed and connect a P200 pipette tip (without cotton/filter) to an aspiration pipette and gently aspirate the existing medium from each well without disrupting the 3D nodules.Add 500 µl of Visudyne working solution into each well except ‘no treatment’ and ‘light-only’ control wells. Add 500 µl of RPMI growth medium into each of the control wells. Incubate for 90 min at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator.Replace Visudyne-containing medium with fresh RPMI growth medium.During the PS incubation, prepare the Laser source and controller by adjusting light density (irradiance) to 50 mW/cm2 using a Laser power meter.To perform PDT, sequentially irradiate each well with 690 nm light directly administered vertically through the bottom of the plate at different doses of light (for example 0-10 J/cm2) by varying the exposure time using a custom-made programmable TTL shutter.",
    "Note: Do not apply any Laser in the ‘no treatment’ wells whereas apply the highest dose of Laser into the ‘light-only’ control wells.  Incubate the plate for additional 4 days following the light irradiation.ImagingOn Day 11, image the plate to quantify residual viable tumor by analyzing mCherry fluorescence (see Figure 1B).Place the plate on Operetta CLS, a high-content imaging instrument with confocal capability while maintaining the temperature at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Use the excitation and emission filters of 530-560 nm and 570-650 nm, respectively to image mCherry-expressing cells.Set image acquisition parameters in Z-stack mode by keeping the visually best fit focal plane in the middle of 10-14 z-planes with 50 µm step size. Adjust the LED power and exposure time based on the “No Treatment” control groups so that the camera sensor is not saturated leaving a wide dynamic range for capturing the highest and lowest. Acquire images using a 5x air objective (NA 0.16) lens in a 2-by-2 mosaic-format (512 x 512 pixels each with 10% overlap)."
