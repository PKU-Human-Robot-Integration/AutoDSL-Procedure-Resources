    "This protocol describes light transmission aggregometry performed in a microtiter plate to assess agonist-dependent platelet–platelet interactions. Briefly, platelets are aliquoted into the appropriate wells of a half-area, clear-bottom 96-well plate. After adding an agonist, the plate is shaken for 5 to 10 min at 37°C, and the absorbance is read on a plate reader. A simple previously published equation can be used to calculate the final percentage of aggregation for each sample (French et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0013]). A diagram depicting how the aggregation formula was derived is shown in Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0001],B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0001]. For most assays, platelet activation should be measured in a dynamic, submaximal range of agonist concentrations. See Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-tbl-0001] for suggested concentrations of common agonists; however, the investigator should optimize agonist concentrations (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0001]). PRP may be substituted for platelets in the protocol, as long as platelet-poor plasma (PPP) is used as the blank rather than Tyrode's buffer and absorbance is measured at 595 nm instead of 405 nm (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0001]). Platelets should be resuspended at 3.0 × 108 platelets/ml. If a hematologic analyzer is unavailable, platelet count can be adjusted based on optical density (OD) at 405 or 800 nm (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0001]). For aggregation assays with PRP, it is unnecessary to adjust the platelet count (Chan et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0009]; Ho & Chan, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0015]; Munnix et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0027]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8e9d9e05-2ae6-45b3-adb4-e98373157829/cpz1668-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Principles of light-transmission aggregometry. (A) Left: Graphical illustration depicting light transmission through cuvettes representing (left to right) resting platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to measure the nominal light transmittance at baseline, agonist-stimulated PRP with platelet aggregates allowing an increase in light transmission, and a blank used to measure the maximum light transmission possible. Right: Depiction of a conventional aggregation tracing of agonist-stimulated platelets to illustrate how percent aggregation is calculated based on the change (∆) in the optical density (OD) between the sample and baseline divided by the difference in the OD between baseline and blank, which represents the maximum amount of change possible in the OD. (B) The complete mathematic formula used to calculate percent aggregation from the OD of the sample, the OD of the baseline (0% aggregation), and the blank (100% aggregation). (C) Image of wells containing platelets stimulated with increasing concentrations of protease-activated receptor-4-activating peptide (PAR4-AP) and shaken for 5 min following the procedures described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-prot-0001]. The OD and aggregation (%) are provided for visual comparison for each well. (D) A spectral scan of wavelengths ranging from 300 to 800 nm was used to determine the wavelength that maximizes the change in OD (red dotted line) between 100 μl PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) or between platelets and Tyrode's buffer. An OD of 1.0 corresponds to 10% light transmission; therefore, although lower wavelengths of light provide a larger maximum change in OD between PRP and PPP, they should be avoided due to the increased chance of error caused by readings above an OD of 1. (E) There is a linear relationship between the concentration of platelets and the OD of the sample in a 96-well plate at all wavelengths tested between 405 and 800 nm.",

    "1. Prepare working stocks of each agonist in a separate V-bottom 96-well plate such that 10 μl of each working stock can be used to achieve the desired final concentration in a volume of 100 μl.\nIf agonists will not be used immediately, the 96-well plate can be sealed and stored at 4°C.\nMost agonist dose responses are steep; therefore, two-fold serial dilutions or lower are recommend.\nA wide range of agonist volumes are suitable to initiate aggregation; however, we recommend adding 10% of the final volume. Larger volumes will decrease the OD of the sample, whereas lower volumes (<2 μl) may lead to increased variability in the data due to pipetting error, especially if using a multichannel pipette.\n2. Aliquot 90 μl platelets into the wells of a 96-well, half-area, clear, flat-bottom plate. If applicable, treat platelets with pharmacologic inhibitor or vehicle control before aliquoting them into individual wells.\nAggregation can be performed in conjunction with either dense-granule secretion or Ca2+ mobilization using this same protocol with only slight modification. CHRONO-LUME or Fluo-4 AM can be added to platelets at this step, and luminescence and fluorescence can be read with absorbance at step 6. The use of CHRONO-LUME and Fluo-4 AM is discussed in detail in Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-prot-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-prot-0003], respectively.\nLower volumes of platelets can be used; however, to prevent spontaneous aggregation observed at lower sample volumes, treat wells with 75 μl of 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tyrode's buffer for 15 min at 37°C, and wash twice with 100 μl Tyrode's buffer before adding platelets (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0002]). Additionally, slightly more expensive microtiter plates coated with a proprietary nonbinding surface (e.g., Corning, cat no 3881) can be used to reduce spontaneous binding if required.",
    "Avoid introducing air bubbles into the well, as they may interfere with absorbance readings.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5a93b490-9c60-42c9-8ac1-182b4f71dd31/cpz1668-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nMicrotiter plate light-transmission aggregometry. (A) A 5% or less spontaneous, agonist-independent aggregation is recommended for most assays. Increasing the sample volume from 50 to 100 μl decreases the amount of spontaneous aggregation in either platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or platelets; experimental details to measure spontaneous aggregation are provided in the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-prot-0004]. Blocking wells with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 min before the addition of platelets reduced spontaneous platelet aggregation. (B) The spontaneous aggregation observed with 50 μl platelets was as effectively blocked by coating wells with BSA as treatment of platelets with 20 nM iloprost (a potent platelet inhibitor) or 4 mM arginine-glycine-aspartate-tryptophan (RGDW; a small peptide that blocks the interaction of αIIbβ3 with fibrinogen). (C) To demonstrate the reproducibility of microtiter-based aggregometry, six technical replicates were performed with platelets stimulated with increasing concentrations of protease-activated receptor-4-activating peptide (PAR4-AP), and the optical density (OD) at 405 nm is reported. (D) Six-point concentration–response curves (0.156 to 20; see graph for units) were performed with platelets and common agonists, anti-CD9 antibodies (n = 7), collagen (n = 14), ADP (n = 4), and thrombin (n = 12). (E) Concentration–response curves were performed with PRP and standard agonists, anti-CD9 antibodies (n = 5), collagen (n = 4), and ADP (n = 5). Data represent mean ± SD.\n3. Transfer 10 μl agonist(s) from the 96-well V-bottom plate to wells containing platelets using a multichannel pipette.\nEquivalent results have been achieved by adding platelets to wells containing agonist with a multichannel pipette.\n4. Shake plate 5 min at 1000 rpm, 37°C.\nPrevious studies have shown the OD of aggregated platelets is stable for at least 15 min (Vinholt, Nybo, Nielsen, & Hvas, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0036]).",
    "Some agonists such as anti-CD9 antibodies may require a longer time to initiate platelet aggregation.\nOrbital plate shakers have unique orbit shapes or diameters and may need to be optimized for shaking speed.\n5. Aliquot 90 μl platelets and 10 μl Tyrode's buffer into an unused well to use as unstimulated resting platelet suspension representing 0% aggregation. Aliquot 100 μl Tyrode's buffer into another well to use as a buffer-only control representing 100% aggregation.\n6. Read absorbance of the plate at 405 nm.\nOther wavelengths have been used to successfully quantify platelet aggregation. See spectral scan of PRP and platelets in Figure 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0001]. The OD of platelet concentrations <6.0 × 108 platelets/ml are linear at wavelengths from 405 to 800 nm (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0001]). However, ODs >1 should be avoided as they correspond to <10% light transmittance and may contribute to increased variability in readings.\n7.

Aggregation data are typically plotted as a concentration–response curve (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0002]-E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0002]) and are often used to test the effect of pharmacologic inhibitors (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fe0d913f-c21b-496e-b392-d4e7c7baefc8/cpz1668-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Data represent mean ± SD.",
    "Following stimulation, platelets initiate several positive feedback mechanisms, including the secretion of dense granules. Dense granules contain small molecules including ADP, ATP, and serotonin that elicit platelet activation. This protocol uses a microtiter luciferin–luciferase bioluminescence assay to measure ATP release from agonist-stimulated platelets as a marker for dense-granule secretion. The method is based on the consumption of extracellular ATP by the enzyme luciferase, which oxidizes its substrate luciferin to oxyluciferin. The decay of oxyluciferin emits visible light that can be quantified by a plate reader (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]). The luciferin and luciferase are provided at excess, so the rate-limiting step in luminescence generation is the amount of ATP released. Thus, the luminescence generated is proportional to the amount of ATP secreted by the platelets. Importantly, luminescence is linear when measuring the exogenous addition of ATP to platelets at concentrations tested up to 40 μM (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/efb4d849-d51e-4edf-9ab0-10ac5d1a8534/cpz1668-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
    "Measuring dense-granule secretion in high-throughput microplate assays. (A) Graphical illustration depicting dense-granule secretion from stimulated platelets. The presence of a luciferin/luciferase mixture can convert the extracellular ATP released from dense granules into light via a chemical reaction. (B) The luminescence (relative luminescence units [RLU]) generated by the addition of exogenous ATP (0.078 to 40 μM) to platelets incubated with CHRONO-LUME is linear (n = 4). Data represent mean ± SD. (C) ATP secretion from platelets stimulated with increasing concentrations of collagen (0.078 to 20 μg/ml) was measured at various gains on a multimode plate reader. The RLU increases as the gain increases, but the percent ATP secretion measured relative to the maximum RLU for each gain remains constant. (D) Platelets were stimulated with a range of thrombin or collagen concentrations, and dense-granule secretion was measured as a single-endpoint read. (E) Lumiaggregation, in which parallel aggregation and luminescence readings are taken on the same well, was performed with protease-activated receptor-4-activating peptide (PAR4-AP)-stimulated platelets treated with 4 mM arginine-glycine-aspartate-tryptophan (RGDW), 20 nM iloprost, 100 μM aspirin, or vehicle control (Ctrl; 0.1% ethanol). (F) Six technical replicates were performed with 50 μM PAR4-AP to determine the reproducibility of real-time ATP secretion measurements. (G) Real-time measurement of ATP secretion following PAR4-AP stimulation of platelets. Data can be presented as representative tracings plus maximum secretion or composite tracings (n = 3). Data represent mean ± SD.

Data represent mean ± SD.",
    "Most modern plate readers allow users to adjust the gain of luminescence. The relative luminescence units (RLU) of a sample increases as the gain increases, but the percent change compared with maximum release is constant (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]). This assay can be performed as either a real-time or static-endpoint assay with aggregation (lumiaggregometry; Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]-G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]). Platelets incubated with CHRONO-LUME can be stimulated and shaken for 5 min, and a single luminescence read can be performed (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]). As noted above, lumiaggregometry can be performed in a 96-well plate simply by adding 1 vol. CHRONO-LUME to 24 vol. platelets before aliquoting platelets into individual wells (i.e., 40 μl CHRONO-LUME to 960 μl platelets, then 90 μl mixture to each well; Fig. 4E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]). Then follow the same protocol for 96-well plate aggregation in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-prot-0001], but measure both absorbance and luminescence at the end of plate shaking. The high sensitivity of luminescence detection can also be used to measure dense-granule secretion in whole blood or PRP, which limits preanalytical procedures and allows testing dense-granule secretion under more physiologic conditions (Sun, Tandon, Yamamoto, Yoshitake, & Kambayashi, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0031]; Fig. 4H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]).\nMaterials\nPlatelet agonists (see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-tbl-0001])\nCHRONO-LUME reagent (e.g., CHRONO-LOG, cat. no. 395)\nPlatelets (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-prot-0004])\n96-well, conical (V-bottom) polypropylene plate (e.g., USA Scientific, cat. no. 1833-9600)\n96-well, half-area, white- or black-walled, clear, flat-bottom plate (e.g., Corning, cat. nos. 3883 or 3880, respectively)\nPlate reader (e.g., BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader)\n10- and 200-μl multichannel pipettes\nOrbital plate shaker (e.g., Eppendorf ThermoMixer)\n1. Prepare working stocks of each agonist in a separate V-bottom 96-well plate such that 5 μl of each working stock can be used to achieve the desired final concentration in a final volume of 50 μl.",
    "If agonists will not be used immediately, the 96-well plate can be sealed and stored at 4°C.\nMost agonist dose responses are steep; therefore, two-fold serial dilutions or lower are recommend. See Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-tbl-0001] for suggested concentrations of common agonists.\nAlthough spontaneous aggregation was observed in endpoint assays with 50 μl platelets (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0002]), in real-time dense-granule secretion assays, we did not observe an increase in baseline ATP release over time using 50 μl (Fig. 4G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0004]). Therefore, we chose to use 50 μl for the real-time ATP-secretion assays to maximize the number of conditions that could be tested with the platelets and converse reagents.\n2. Add 2 μl CHRONO-LUME (a luciferin/luciferase mixture) to 43 μl platelets, and incubate 5 min in the wells of a 96-well, half-area, white- or black-walled, clear, flat-bottom plate.\nTo decrease the amount of pipetting and ensure CHRONO-LUME is equally distributed in each well, we recommend adding CHRONO-LUME to the platelets and then aliquoting 45 μl platelet/CHRONO-LUME mix into the plate. If using an antiplatelet agent with an incubation time <10 min, add CHRONO-LUME to all platelets first, and then aliquot and treat platelets with the inhibitor or vehicle control.\nWhen using PRP or whole blood, add 5 μl CHRONO-LUME to 40 μl sample, and perform protocol as described.\n3. Program a kinetic read on a multimode microplate reader to perform steps 4 to 7.\n4. Read baseline luminescence before agonist stimulation.",
    "To optimize gain, some machines provide an autogain function. If this function is not available, we recommend selecting a gain that maximizes the change in luminescence between an unstimulated sample and a maximally stimulated sample, such as 10 nM thrombin or the highest concentration of agonist used for the experiment. Once selected, the gain should be kept the same for all experiments in the same study.\nBaseline luminescence can vary between donors and even between different preparations of platelets from the same donor depending on the quality of platelet preparation (von Papen, Gambaryan, Schütz, & Geiger, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0037]).\n5. Eject plate and transfer 5 μl agonist to platelets from V-bottom 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.\nPipette up and down three times to mix agonist, being careful not to introduce bubbles into the sample.\n6. Read plate luminescence after agonist stimulation.\n7. Shake plate continuously 5 min at 800 rpm while reading luminescence every 30 s.\nShaking is not required for all agonists, such as thrombin, protease-activated receptor-1-activating peptide (PAR1-AP), and PAR4-AP. However, some agonists such as collagen and anti-CD9 antibodies will have a marked increase in granule secretion when platelets are shaken. Therefore, when using certain agonists, the number of samples that can be run simultaneously is limited by the time required to read those samples without infringing on the shaking time between reads. The more samples there are, the longer it will take to read them, and the less time the platelets will have to shake between reads. To increase the number of samples that can be run simultaneously, plate readers can be set to “sweep mode,” or the interval between reads can be increased to 45 to 60 s.\n8. Report data as RLU.",
    "Due to variability in background ATP secretion and interindividual variability, normalizing data as percentage of maximum can reduce variation in the data. If absolute quantification of ATP release is required, prepare a standard curve of ATP (0 to 40 μM), and mix 5 μl ATP dilution with 43 μl platelets and 2 μl CHRONO-LUME.

    "The rise in intracellular Ca2+ is an early second messenger that is common and essential to most platelet functions, including platelet aggregation and granule secretion. Upon activation of platelets, basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels go from ∼100 nM to low micromolar levels depending on the type and amount of agonist used. This protocol describes the use of a nonratiometric, fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fluo-4 AM, to measure rises in intracellular Ca2+ following agonist stimulation. Ca2+ mobilization is transient following stimulation with many agonists; therefore, it is best to measure changes in Ca2+ mobilization in real time (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0005]-C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0005]). However, for drug screens, Ca2+ mobilization can be measured as a single endpoint by simply adding 1 µl Fluo-4 AM per 499 µl platelets and performing Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-prot-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/aa9d1513-5308-4711-b3c3-98cb05a69b23/cpz1668-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nHigh-throughput microplate assays to measure Ca2+ mobilization in platelets. (A) Six technical replicates were performed with 100 μM protease-activated receptor-4-activating peptide (PAR4-AP) to determine the reproducibility of real-time Ca2+ mobilization. Data are reported as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). (B) Real-time intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to 5 nM thrombin, 5 μM PAR1-AP, or control (ctrl). Data represent mean ± SD; n = 3. (C) A single-endpoint fluorescence measurement was made 4 min after stimulation with 5 nM thrombin, 5 μM PAR1-AP, 200 μM PAR4-AP, or control (ctrl) using Fluo-4 AM–treated platelets. (D) The rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ was measured in real time following stimulation with increasing concentrations of PAR4-AP (n = 3). Data represent mean ± SD.\nAdditionally, Ca2+ can be multiplexed with dense-granule secretion for real-time measurements (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0006]-D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0006]) or as an endpoint assay with aggregation and dense-granule secretion (Fig. 6E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4baef26b-4f3b-4633-b8e2-4b66ca29dfc6/cpz1668-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",

(A) Ca2+ mobilization and (B) ATP secretion were monitored in real time following stimulation of washed platelets with anti-CD9 antibodies in the presence of 20 nM iloprost (ilo), 1 μM cangrelor (Can), or vehicle control (Ctrl); n = 3.

Prepare working stocks of each agonist in a separate V-bottom 96-well plate such that 5 μl of each working stock can be used to achieve the desired final concentration in a final volume of 50 μl.\nIf agonists will not be used immediately, the 96-well plate can be sealed and stored at 4°C.\nMost agonist dose-responses are steep; therefore, two-fold serial dilutions or lower are recommend. See Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-tbl-0001] for suggested concentrations of common agonists.",
    "2. Add 1 μl of 1 μg/ml Fluo-4 AM (a fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye) to 498 μl platelets, and incubate 10 min at 37°C. Immediately before aliquoting platelets, add 1 μl of 1 M CaCl2 (2 mM final).\nIf using an antiplatelet agent with an incubation time <10 min, add Fluo-4 AM to all platelets first, and then aliquot and treat platelets with the inhibitor or vehicle control.\n3. Aliquot 45 μl Fluo-4 AM–treated platelets into the wells of a 96-well, half-area, black-walled, clear, flat-bottom plate.\n4. Program a kinetic read on a multimode plate reader to perform steps 5 to 7.\n5. Read baseline fluorescence (494 nm excitation/506 nm emission) before agonist stimulation.\nTo optimize gain, some machines provide an autogain function. If this function is not available, we recommend selecting a gain that maximizes the change in fluorescence between an unstimulated sample and a maximally stimulated sample without oversaturating the signal. Once selected, the gain should be kept the same for all experiments in the same study.\n6. Eject plate and transfer 5 μl agonist to Fluo-4 AM–treated platelets from V-bottom 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.\nPipette up and down three times to mix agonist, being careful not to introduce bubbles into the sample.\n7. Read plate fluorescence after agonist stimulation.\n8. Shake plate continuously 4 min at 800 rpm while reading fluorescence every 20 s.",
    "Shaking is not required for all agonists, such as thrombin, PAR1-AP, and PAR4-AP. However, some agonists such as collagen and anti-CD9 antibodies will have a marked increase in Ca2+ mobilization when platelets are shaken. Therefore, when using certain agonists, the number of samples that can be run simultaneously is limited by the time required to read those samples without infringing on the shaking time between reads. The more samples there are, the longer it will take to read them, and the less time the platelets will have to shake between reads. To increase the number of samples that can be run simultaneously, plate readers can be set to “sweep mode,” or the interval between reads can be increased to 45 to 60 s.\n9. Report data as mean fluorescence intensity.\nDue to interindividual variability, normalizing data as percentage of maximum can help reduce variation.",
    "This protocol provides a detailed procedure for the isolation of PRP or platelets from human whole blood. PRP and platelets can be separated from other cellular components of blood by centrifugation.\nMaterials\n10× ACD (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-rec-0001])\n50 U/ml apyrase (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. A6410)\n50 μg/ml prostaglandin E1 (PGE1; CAS 745-65-3; e.g., Cayman Chemical, cat. no. 13010)\nTyrode's buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-rec-0002])\n21-G needle\n5-ml sodium citrate or ACD vacutainer (e.g., BD, cat. nos. 363083 or 364606, respectively)\nBenchtop centrifuge (e.g., Eppendorf 5810)\n15- and 50-ml polypropylene conical tubes\nTransfer pipette (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 13-711-7M)\nAutomated hematology analyzer (e.g., Drew Scientific, Hemavet 950FS)\nMicrotiter plate\nPlate reader (e.g., BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader )\nOrbital plate shaker (e.g., Eppendorf ThermoMixer)\nPrepare platelet-rich plasma\n1. Draw up to 50 ml blood from the antecubital vein of a consenting donor with a 21-G needle into 5-ml sodium citrate or ACD vacutainers.\nSodium citrate is the anticoagulant of choice for isolating PRP to use in functional assays. ACD or sodium citrate can be used for the isolation of platelets.\nThe final yield of 3 × 108 platelets/ml in Tyrode's buffer from 1 ml whole blood is usually between 0.3 and 0.8 ml depending on the donor's platelet count, which can range from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets/μl in whole blood.\n2. Centrifuge citrated whole blood in vacutainers 10 min at 200 × g, room temperature, with low acceleration set to “2” and brake set to “0” (off) if using an Eppendorf 5810.\nThe centrifugation time is dependent on the volume of blood in the vacutainer being spun. The time listed is the total centrifugation time including acceleration for a 5-ml vacutainer. If using 8.5-ml vacutainers, the total centrifugation time should be increased to 15 min.",
    "3. Transfer PRP to a clean 15- or 50-ml polypropylene conical tube with a plastic transfer pipette, being careful not to disturb the buffy coat or red blood cell layers.\nTo decrease red blood cell contamination, leave ∼10% PRP remaining in tube.\n4. Centrifuge remaining whole blood in vacutainers 10 min at 2000 × g, room temperature, with acceleration set to “9” and brake on to obtain PPP. Transfer PPP to a clean polypropylene conical tube, being careful not to disturb the buffy coat and red blood cell layers.\nOnly perform this step to collect PPP as a blank if you are performing aggregometry with PRP. If using washed platelets, the remaining whole blood can be discarded.\nIsolate platelets from platelet-rich plasma\n5. Add 1 vol. of 10× ACD to 9 vol. PRP, and then add apyrase to a final concentration of 0.02 U/ml and/or PGE1 to 50 ng/ml. Mix gently by inverting three times.\nPGE1 is a prostacyclin receptor agonist that activates protein kinase A and elicits a strong antiplatelet effect (Braune, Küpper, & Jung, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0004]; Iyú et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-bib-0017]). Alternatively, prostacyclin can also be used at a final concentration of 0.5 μM instead of PGE1 but is more labile than PGE1.\nApyrase is an enzyme that degrades ATP or ADP released from platelet dense granules during platelet processing.\nWe find the addition of both PGE1 and apyrase results in less chance of spontaneous platelet activation during isolation, but ACD plus either PGE1 or apyrase alone can be used to isolate platelets.\n6. Centrifuge PRP 10 min at 2000 × g, room temperature, with acceleration set to “2” and brake set to “2.”\n7. Remove PPP supernatant, and gently resuspend platelet pellet(s) in Tyrode's buffer.",
    "For new donors, resuspend platelets in 0.2 ml Tyrode's buffer per ml whole blood collected. The amount of platelets isolated from a donor remains relatively consistent over time. Therefore, for repeat donors, resuspend their platelets in 80% of their previous total platelet volume, assuming the same amount of blood was drawn.\n8. Count platelets using a hematology analyzer.\nIf a hematology analyzer is not accessible, platelet count can be adjusted to a standard OD using a plate reader. The OD of 50 μl of 3.0 × 108 platelets/ml is 0.455 at 800 nm and 0.745 at 405 nm (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.668#cpz1668-fig-0001]). Although OD of platelets can vary between donors based on a number of intrinsic platelet factors such as their size and granule content, the use of OD to estimate platelet count is accurate enough to obtain reproducible data. To calculate platelet count, use the following equations:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} {\\rm{Platelet\\ count\\ ( \\times 1}}{{\\rm{0}}}^{\\rm{8}}\\;{\\rm{platelets/ml)}} = \\frac{{{\\rm{(O}}{{\\rm{D}}}_{{\\rm{800}}}{\\rm{\\ }} - \\ {\\rm{0}}{\\rm{.06276)}}}}{{{\\rm{0}}{\\rm{.1309}}}} \\end{equation*}$$\nformula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} {\\rm{Platelet}}\\;{\\rm{count}}\\;( \\times {\\rm{1}}{{\\rm{0}}}^{\\rm{8}}\\;{\\rm{platelets/ml)}} = \\frac{{{\\rm{(O}}{{\\rm{D}}}_{{\\rm{405}}} - {\\rm{0}}{\\rm{.07582)}}}}{{{\\rm{0}}{\\rm{.1419}}}}. \\end{equation*}$$\n9. Test platelets for amount of spontaneous, agonist-independent aggregation to examine quality of platelet preparation: Aliquot 90 μl platelets and 10 μl Tyrode's buffer into the wells of microtiter plate; perform in duplicate. Aliquot 100 μl Tyrode's buffer into a well as a blank to measure maximal light transmittance.\nThe inadvertent activation of platelets during preparation is often undetectable until the platelets are shaken, which allows the platelets to come into contact with each other.\nAvoid introducing air bubbles into the well, as they may interfere with absorbance readings.\n10. Read OD of wells at 405 nm on a plate reader.\n11. Shake plate 10 min at 1000 rpm, 37°C.\nAggregation can be performed at room temperature without a significant change in platelet responsiveness.",
    "12. Reread OD of wells at 405 nm on a plate reader.\n13. Calculate percent spontaneous aggregation.\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray*} &amp;&amp;{\\rm{Percent}}\\;{\\rm{spontaneous}}\\;{\\rm{aggregation}}\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;&amp;= \\frac{{{\\rm{(OD}}\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{sample}}\\;{\\rm{before}}\\;{\\rm{shaking}} - \\ {\\rm{OD}}\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{sample}}\\;{\\rm{after}}\\;{\\rm{shaking)}}}}{{{\\rm{(OD}}\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{sample}}\\;{\\rm{before}}\\;{\\rm{shaking}} - \\ {\\rm{OD}}\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{blank)}}}}{\\rm{ \\times 100}}{\\rm{.}} \\end{eqnarray*}$$\nIdeally, spontaneous aggregation should be <5% to use platelets for further functional assays."
