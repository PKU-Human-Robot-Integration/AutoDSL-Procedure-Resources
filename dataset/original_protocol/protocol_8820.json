  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: Here, the use of FIM is presented for handy high throughput analysis of larval locomotion for screening in free-moving conditions and under influence of a heat stimulus. Other applications such as analysis of olfactory stimuli dependent locomotion or high resolution imaging of rolling or other behaviors might need subtle changes to the protocol, which are provided upon request.\n1. Set-up of Experiments\nUse about 100 larvae per genotype in total (1 hr time required) to obtain statistically meaningful values. NOTE: In case several genotypes need to be compared and recorded on different days, record the same number of larvae per genotype per day.\nFor most applications, record at 10 Hz for parameter analysis. For high resolution imaging applications, vary imaging speed if needed.\nFor tracking of third instar larvae, conduct experiments about 120 hr after egg laying. Make sure that cultures yield enough larvae in the experimental period (see 4.3).\nFor non-stimulus applications, prepare a crawling surface containing translucent agar (see section 2). To contain larvae in the stimulus range for heat gradient application, surround the field of view with an aversive salt agar barrier (see section 3).\n\tNOTE: Other applications may require different surfaces.\nMake sure to use a room with constant environmental conditions (temperature, light, air flow, air humidity etc.).\n2. Crawling Surface Preparation (Translucent Agar)\nNOTE: In the FIM setup an agar surface is added to provide a moist crawling surface. In addition, it also improves illumination properties.\nBoil 0.8% food grade agar in deionized ultrapure water. For screening application prepare 400 ml.",
    "Pour agar at 50 °C (hand-hot) on a separate 33 cm x 33 cm acrylic-glass plate. The surface tension of the agar and thus the temperature will define the thickness of the agar slab. At 50 °C, 2 mm thick agar slabs are obtained. Do not agitate after boiling and pour constantly to avoid bubbles. Prepare fresh agar slabs for every imaging period of about 4 hr.\nFill standard 6 cm petri dishes with the remaining 0.8% agar solution to sort, clean and habituate larvae prior to the experiment (1 dish per genotype).\nIn case an aversive agar barrier is needed for the application, proceed to section 3.\nTrim off approximately 2 cm of the perimeter of the agar slab to obtain a plane square surface for recording. Remove the excess agar.\n\tNOTE: The size is dependent on the application.\nTransfer the agar slab to the FIM setup directly after cooling by gently pushing the gliding agar over the edge of the acrylic glass plate.\n3. Optional: Adding an Aversive Agar Barrier to the Crawling Surface (Salt Agar)\nBoil 2.5% food grade agar with 3 M NaCl in deionized ultrapure water. For screening in a heat gradient prepare 200 ml.\n\tNOTE: The volume depends on the application.\nCut a 2 cm wide notch in the previously poured crawling surface surrounding the field of view (22 x 22 cm).\n\tNOTE: Different barrier forms and fields of view may be required depending on the application.\nFill the notch with salt agar 0.1-0.3 cm higher than the tracking surface.\n4. Fly Handling\nRear flies in 25 °C incubator with 12 hr light/dark cycle adjusted to the experiment’s time on standard fly food at 65% air humidity.",
    "For crosses, anesthetize 30 virgin female flies and 8 males with CO2 and cross them in 130 ml culture vials with 35 ml food.\n\tNOTE: One 130 ml culture vial with 35 ml food will yield about 20-30 late third instar larvae within the imaging span of 4 hr. Imaging and tracking works for all larval instar stages.\nDrop a little water in culture vials to drive late third instar larval movement and collect the largest larvae from vial walls using a small paintbrush.\n2-5 min before recording, transfer larvae for one video to a Petri-dish containing 0.8% food grade agar in deionized ultra pure water to habituate and clean them.\n5. Adjusting the FIM Imaging Setup for Recordings (Non Stimulus Conditions)\nAdjust camera lens focus and aperture if needed. Set the exposure time for the respective camera.\n\tNOTE: These settings do not need to be changed during an experiment.\nAdjust illumination intensity to obtain good contrast by imaging one larva.\nKeep environmental conditions in the room constant during recordings. Darken the room to not disturb larvae with directional light.\n6. Optional: Adjusting the FIM Imaging Setup for Recordings (Gradual Temperature Stimulus Conditions)\nNOTE: The heat gradient device is a 42 x 42 x 0.2 cm3 aluminum plate with a matt black paint and isolating material on the top site. The plate is perfused with water from two different circuits connected to calorifiers/coolers and pumps at both ends (see Figure 1B). The temperatures can be regulated from -5 to +50 °C.\nTurn on the heat gradient device 1 hr prior to the experiments and place it above the setup to allow establishing the desired temperature profile and components to equilibrate.\nTransfer the crawling surface agar with a salt barrier to the setup.",
    "Place the radiator plate over the agar and adjust the spacing between the plate and the crawling surface to 2 mm (~1 mm above larvae).\nEstablish a linear gradient of at least 0.8°C/cm from 34 °C (approx. 2 cm from the barrier in the field of view) to 18 °C (approx. 2 cm from the barrier at the opposite site in the field of view) by adjusting the temperature of the water circuits to 1 °C and 45 °C.\n\tNOTE: Different gradient properties of the metal plate require different temperatures which need to be ascertained empirically. These settings do not need to be changed during the experiments.\nAdjust settings as described in section 5.\nAllow the crawling surface to equilibrate in the gradient before experiments for 20 min. Test the temperature gradient with a pyrometer.\nProceed with section 8.\n7. FIM Imaging (Non Stimulus Conditions)\nUse a small wet paintbrush to gently gather 15 larvae from the habituation petri dishes and transfer them to the center of the tracking surface. Don’t transfer food remains or too much water (see 7.8).\nRecord 1 - 50 larvae on a 22 cm x 22 cm tracking area. Use 15 animals per video for most screening applications (for statistical reasons use at least 100 individuals per genotype).\nGently separate larvae and wait for about 10-20 sec until all larvae started to move straight before recording.\nRecord larval locomotion for 2 min at 10 frames per sec for non stimulus conditions. Use uncompressed tif images as the output format.\nDuring recording, collect larvae for the next video from vials to habituate them. Critical: Do not disturb recorded larvae with light.\nAfter recording, remove larvae with a large paintbrush and discard them in accordance with local safety and legislation rules.",
    "After removing larvae, use the paintbrush to clean and moisturize the crawling surface with ultra pure deionized water.\nCritical: Keep the surface moist at all times but avoid excessive moisture, which can be seen as halos or drops surrounding larvae in recordings and disturb tracking.\n8. Optional: FIM Imaging (Gradual Temperature Stimulus Conditions)\nAfter the temperature gradient is established (see section 6), prepare the recording software for instant recording within 20 sec after placing the larvae on the crawling surface (see 8.2) e.g., set the number of frames per video and define the saving path.\nLift the radiator plate slightly and place the larvae at 33 °C 2 cm from the salt barrier. Refer to 6. and 7. for further general instructions. Lower the radiator plate again and start recording for 3-4 min directly after larvae started to move straight.\nAfter recording, remove larvae directly, clean and moisturize the surface. Do not touch the salt agar to avoid spreading of NaCl.\nCritical: Keep the surface moist at all times but avoid excessive moisture, which can be seen as halos or drops surrounding larvae in recordings and disturb tracking.\nAllow the agar surface to equilibrate again after moisturizing for 1-2 min, while saving images and gathering new animals before preparing for next video. Control the temperature gradient using a pyrometer every 5 videos and adjust temperature device if needed (water temperature, height, and x-y orientation in respect to the tracking surface).\n9. Tracking of Larval Locomotion\nNOTE: For more details refer to the attached manual for FIMTrack (supplement). For a program flow chart see Figure 2.\nAdjust tracking parameters for the respective experiments using the preview option.\n\t\nAdjust pixel per cm according to camera and field of view.\nAdjust frames per sec based on the camera settings.",
    "Adjust brightness thresholds so that all animals are detected correctly (feedback is given in the preview).\nAdjust larval area size thresholds. Note the feedback option in the preview: single animals are highlighted in yellow, colliding larvae are highlighted in red and the area of each animal is given in blue.\nStart tracking by using the button in the bottom right.\n\tNOTE: After successful tracking, an image featuring larval tracks and a csv file containing the calculated locomotion and posture features is stored in the image directory.\nUse the FIM Results viewer module (Edit >Results Viewer…) to review and manually adjust the tracking results. If required, define stimulus regions to evaluate data in respect to the stimulus regime e.g., crawling orientation in respect to the heat gradient or distance to an odorant source. For more detailed description please use the manual (supplement).\n10. Evaluation of the Data\nImport the csv file into Excel, Matlab or any other program for further statistical analysis."
