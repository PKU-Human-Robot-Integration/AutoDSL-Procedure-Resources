  "procedures": [
    "1. Microscope setup\nUse a compound microscope with fluorescence capabilities. For this study, data were collected on an upright microscope (Table of Materials) fitted with LEDs for excitation.\nIn order to properly visualize fluorescence changes in body wall muscles, use a high magnification objective.\n\t\nFor dissected preparations, use a 60x NA 1.0 water immersion objective (Table of Materials).\nFor preparations using nanobeads, use a 60x NA 1.4 oil immersion objective (Table of Materials). This magnification ensures sufficient resolution of muscles onto the camera sensor.\nUse a high sensitivity camera attached to the microscope to capture images at a high frame rate in order to track rapid changes in calcium levels. For this study, image with an sCMOS system (Table of Materials) capable of full frame imaging at 100 Hz, as rise times for the Ca2+ signals can be as rapid as tens of milliseconds.\nControl camera acquisition and LED fluorescence excitation with a micro-manager software running in ImageJ10 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Table of Materials).\nUse an open-source electronic platform plugin, which connects an external open-source microcontroller board (Table of Materials), to manage the external timing pulses to control the fluorescence excitation.\n\tNOTE: Digital outs are available from digital pins 8 to 13 providing output bits 0 to 5. These can be addressed as base 2 values of 1, 10, 100, etc. Serial port settings are indicated in Table 1 and available from the micro-manager website (Table of Materials). Firmware for the microcontroller board is similarly available at this website.\nTo control the timing logic, activate the micromanager acquisition protocol in the software according to the manufacturer's instructions (Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: This simultaneously initiates a preset camera frame duration and the number of frames to be activated, as well as the logical shutter and preset amber LED for fluorescence excitation. In this case, the amber LED solid state switch is controlled by microcontroller bit 1 output through pin 9. The camera frames out TTL (back plate out 3 connector) triggers a stimulator. This precisely times the activation of the blue light LED for the activation of channelrhodopsin at a set time following the activation of the imaging sequence.\nTo stimulate channelrhodopsin with blue light and record RCaMP changes, use two LEDs. Activate channelrhodopsin with an LED with a peak emission wavelength of 470 nm and a bandpass filter (455 to 490 nm) and excite RCaMP with an LED with a peak emission wavelength of 594 nm and a bandpass filter (570 to 600 nm).\nIn order to simultaneously activate channelrhodopsin and capture changes in RCaMP fluorescent levels, co-illuminate both LEDs and transmit the light to the same optical path using a dichroic beam combiner.\nControl the timing of LED illumination with solid state switches (Table of Materials) controlled by TTL signals (maximum rated turn-on time, 1 ms, turn-off time 0.3 ms: 0 to 90% turn-on and turn off time of < 100 µs).\nSet the LED intensity with the current controlled low noise linear power supplies (Table of Materials).",
    "To ensure the precise timing of the blue light LED, activate it directly by TTL pulse to the solid-state relay from a stimulator. Program the blue light stimulation protocol into a stimulator (Table of Materials), which acts as a precise timer from the start of image acquisition to blue LED illumination. In this experiment, turn on blue light stimulation after 2 s of capturing RCaMP fluorescence only and use a train of 5, 2 ms blue light pulses with 50 ms interpulse intervals to activate channelrhodopsin.\n\tNOTE: The delay before blue light pulses, the duration of the blue light pulses, the time between pulses, and the number of pulses in the train can all be set at this point and should reflect the specific parameters of experimental interest.\n2. C. elegans sample preparation and data acquisition\nTo optically stimulate presynaptic neurons, obtain animals expressing channelrhodopsin in excitatory cholinergic neurons, driven with the unc-17 promoter region, and RCaMP expressed in all body wall muscles driven with the myo-3 promoter region2.\n\tNOTE: Only the use of animals with integrated transgenes and robust levels of fluorescence are recommended as the variable expression in the corresponding cell types may affect the reliability of data acquisition.\nMake a working stock of all-trans retinal by diluting the retinal powder (Table of Materials) in ethanol to create a final concentration of 100 mM and store at -20 °C. This working stock will be stable for approximately one year.\nCreate a stock of OP50 E. coli, grown in LB media, supplemented with all-trans retinal from the working stock made in step 2.2, at a final concentration of 80 µM. The volume used for the OP50+retinal stock will be dependent on the number of plates necessary for the experiment.",
    "Seed nematode growth media (NGM) plates with approximately 300 µL of the OP50+retinal stock and allow plates to dry overnight at room temperature in the dark.\nGrow C. elegans strains to the desired age in the dark on OP50+retinal NGM plates at 20 °C. For this experiment, use adult worms.\n\t\nFor the experiment using the dissected preparation, only use gravid adult worms as performing the dissection on younger, smaller animals is extremely challenging. Leave the animals on the OP50-retinal plates for a minimum of 3 days for an effective channelrhodopsin activation.\nIf using the dissected preparation8,11 (Figure 1A), perform dissections in low light.\n\t\nPlace animals in a dissecting dish with a silicone-coated coverslip base that is filled with a 1 mM Ca2+ extracellular solution composed of 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM sucrose, and 15 mM HEPES (pH 7.3, -340 Osm).\nGlue down animals using the liquid topical skin adhesive with blue coloring along the dorsal side of the worm and make a lateral cuticle incision along the glue/worm interface using glass needles.\nUse a mouth pipette to clear the internal viscera from the worm cavity.\nGlue down the cuticle flap of the animal to expose the ventral medial body wall muscles for imaging.\nIf using the nanobead preparation (Figure 1B)\n\t\nMake a molten 5% agarose solution using ddH2O to a final volume of 100 mL.\nUsing a Pasteur pipette, place a drop of molten agarose solution onto a glass slide and immediately place a second glass slide over the top, perpendicular to the first, using gentle pressure to create an even agarose pad. Remove the top slide before use.\nAdd approximately 4 µL of polystyrene nanobeads (Table of Materials) to the middle of the agarose pad.",
    "In the low light, pick 4-6 C. elegans into the nanobead solution, making sure animals do not lay on top of each other, and carefully place a coverslip on the top.\nPlace the prepared slide or dissection dish onto the microscope, and find and focus on a worm using 10x magnification and dim bright field illumination.\nSwitch to 60x magnification and RCaMP fluorescence excitation to identify a ventromedial body wall muscle that is anterior to the vulva and in the correct focal plane.\n\tNOTE: Muscles anterior to the vulva are selected as they reflect muscles commonly stimulated in electrophysiology experiments.\nChange the image pathway from the eyepiece to the camera by pulling out the toggle and clicking Live within the data acquisition software (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Make sure the blue light stimulation pathway is turned off at this point to ensure that the channelrhodopsin does not get activated before capturing images.\nFocus the image within the data acquisition software using the microscope fine focus.\nOnce the muscle is clearly in focus, turn off the live image by unclicking the Live button.\nClick the ROI button in the data acquisition software and create a box around the muscle being focused on.\nOn the stimulator, switch on the blue light stimulation pathway that has been previously programmed in step 1.10.\nClick Acquire in the imaging software to capture the image through the CMOS camera. To do this, set the exposure time to 10 s with 1,000 frames and 2x binning.\n3. Data analysis\nOpen the data file in the imaging software (Table of Materials) and, using the Polygon Tool, outline the muscle of interest. This is the ROI.",
    "Go to Image | Stacks | Plot Z-axis profile and export the resulting data points into the spreadsheet software (Table of Materials). This function plots the ROI selection mean value versus the time point.\nMove the muscle ROI created with the Polygon tool outside of the animal to get a background fluorescence measurement using the steps outlined in 3.2. Export the resulting data into the spreadsheet workbook.\nIn the spreadsheet workbook, subtract the background fluorescence values from the muscle fluorescence values at each time point. This provides the background subtracted fluorescent signal.\nAverage the background subtracted fluorescence for the first 2 s of data points. This will give the baseline fluorescence measurement, F.\nUse the baseline fluorescence measurement to calculate the normalized fluorescence level at each time point. To do this, use the equation (ΔF/F)+1. ΔF represents (F(t)-F), where F(t) is the fluorescence measurement at any given time point and F is the baseline value. The +1 is added as a y-axis offset.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.6 for each muscle image that is collected. Using single or multiple muscle cells per image is at the discretion of the researcher. The n of the experiment can be determined by performing a power analysis.\nUse the processed data from steps 3.2-3.6 to make a trace of the fluorescent values in graphing software according to the manufacturer's instructions (Table of Materials).\nFrom this trace, measure the kinetics of the calcium transient, such as rise to peak time and half decay time, using the tools provided in the graphing software as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nSubscription Required.
