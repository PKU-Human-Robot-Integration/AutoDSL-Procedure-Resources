    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNick translation (sufficient for 3 wells of a 384-well plate)\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step randomly digests a BAC probe into <1000 base pair linear segments, amplifies them by duplicating them with polymerase, and directly labels these segments through the addition of fluorescently tagged dUTP.\nThe volumes described below, for 1 μg starting probe DNA in a total reaction volume of 25 μL, are generally suitable to make enough probe to stain 3 wells of a 384-well plate.\nIn our hands, nick translation reactions have been successfully scaled up from a total volume of 25 μL as described here to a maximum of 500 μL. We do not recommend scaling up an individual reaction farther than this. If more than 500 μL of probe is required, set up several reactions up in parallel, and then pool the concentrated products.\nMix the nick translation reaction, on ice and protected from light.\nDilute DNAse in PCR-grade water 1:1000 to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL\nCritical: Retest this dilution with known probes every time you open a fresh 1 mg/mL stock of DNAse, as the appropriate concentration varies between 1:500 and 1:2000.\nNote: Depending on the probe used, this dilution can be adapted from 1:500–1:2000.\nDilute DNA to 65 μg/mL in PCR-grade water on ice by mixing:\n1 μg probe DNA\nFill to 15.5 μL PCR-grade water\nMix master mix (scaled up as necessary) on ice and protected from light:\n2.5 μL 10× nick translation buffer\n2.5 μL fluorescent nucleotide stock\n2.5 μL β-mercaptoethanol\n1 μL diluted DNAse stock\n1 μL DNA polymerase\nAdd 9.5 μL master mix per 2 μg probe DNA to each reaction tube\nTap tubes to remove bubbles and spin 1 min at 20,000 g in a desktop centrifuge.",
    "Incubate at 16°C in a water bath in a cold room for 80 min\nNote: we have tried anywhere from 30 min to 3 hours with varied results. Retest this when you are troubleshooting a new probe (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nStop the reaction:\nAdd 1 μL of 0.5 M EDTA\nIncubate at 72°C for 10 min\nAs a quality control step, run 5 μL of the reaction volume on a 2% agarose gel at 60 V for 30 min. Verify that probes run as a smear between 100 bp and 1000 bp (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nPause point: Nick translated probes can be stored at −20°C for up to six months, although freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided. We have had the best results with relatively freshly made probes, stored for up to a week.\nProbe precipitation and resuspension in hybridization mix (sufficient for 3 wells of a 384-well plate)\nTiming: 4 h to 1 day\nProbes generated by nick translation are diluted in an aqueous solution and must be resuspended in hybridization mix for the FISH protocol. They also still contain residual DNAse and DNA polymerase. We use an ethanol precipitation step to clean the DNA and concentrate it, which allows us to resuspend it in hybridization mix.\nThe volumes described here, starting with 20 μL of nick translated probe in each of three colors, are usually suitable for staining 3 wells of a 384-well plate.\nMix the following in a micro-centrifuge tube:\n20 μL nick translated probe in each color you will be using\n9 μL human Cot-1 DNA (competitor; final concentration: 25 ng/μL)\n6 μL yeast tRNA (carrier; final concentration: 165 ng/μL)\n12 μL NaOAc\n150 μL ethanol\nVortex to mix and spin 1 min at 20,000 g in a desktop centrifuge\nChill at −20°C for 60 min",
    "Spin at 4°C at 20,000 g for 30 min\nGently decant supernatant and air dry tubes while inverted and protected from light for 10 min\nNote: The pellet at this point should be brightly colored (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Its color depends on the fluorophores used. Green fluorophores (such as DY-488) tend to make pellets more yellow, red fluorophores (such as DY-549) tend to make pellets more pink, and dark red fluorophores (such as DY-647) tend to make pellets more blue. (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11])\nNote: To remove residual ethanol without over-drying the pellet, we often use a shorter drying step and dry the sides of the tube with a KimwipeTM (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nResuspend the pellet\nAdd 45 μL hybridization buffer\nHeat to 65°C and vortex, or use a thermomixer at 65°C and 700+ rpm for at least 60 min (troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13])\nPause point: Resuspended probes in hybridization mix can be stored at −20°C for up to six months, although freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided. We have had the best results with relatively freshly made probes, stored for up to a week.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Use of a KimwipeTM to remove residual ethanol after precipitation of probes, related to step 9\nFixation, washes, and permeabilization of the plate\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step prepares cells for the hybridization process. Cells are fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized to ensure access of probes through cell and nuclear membranes, chromatin is slightly deproteinated to allow probes to bind, and finally samples are equilibrated in a formamide solution to destabilize the DNA base pairing and allow denaturation to occur at lower temperatures.",
    "For all washes in this step, we use 100 μL per well of a 384-well plate, but high precision is not necessary. For techniques to exchange media in 384-well plates, see Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nFix cells directly from cell culture\nAdd 50 μL 8% PFA in PBS to wells already containing cells and 50 μL media (final: 100 μL of 4% PFA in PBS).\nIncubate 10 min at 20°C–22°C\nRinse thrice in PBS\nNote: 8% PFA in PBS is best made fresh the day of the experiment, but can be stored for up to a week at 4°C.\nCritical: Formaldehyde is a hazardous substance. It must be disposed of properly and working with it in a fume hood is critical for the health of the experimenter.\nPause point: Cells can be held here up to 24 hours at 4°C in PBS or transferred to 70% ethanol and kept at −20°C for up to a week. Longer than that and signals start degrading, especially if using oligo-library based probes or plasmid probes. At this step, plates should be sealed with parafilm and/or plastic plate seals to prevent drying out during storage. If cells are stored after fixation, bring them fully to 20°C–22°C before continuing.\nIncubate in permeabilization solution for 20 min at 20°C–22°C.\nRinse twice in PBS\nDenature in 0.1N HCl for 15 min at 20°C–22°C\nNeutralize in 2× SSC for 5 min at 20°C–22°C\nIncubate in equilibration buffer for at least 30 min at 20°C–22°C.\nPause point: Cells in equilibration buffer can be kept at 4°C for a few days or up to a week. Longer incubations in fact often improve staining of larger regions. At this step, plates should be sealed with parafilm and/or plastic plate seals to prevent drying out during storage.",

Techniques of performing exchange of washes in plates: shaking over a reservoir and gentle extraction with a sponge, related to steps 11–16, 23–27, and troubleshooting 2 and 3\nHybridization and washes\nTiming: 2–4 days\nThis step combines the probe with the cells, allows stable binding, and washes off excess probe before imaging.\nFor all washes in this step, we use 100 μL per well of a 384-well plate, but precision is not necessary.\nAdd probe mix to wells\nAspirate equilibration buffer gently with a 200 μL micropipette\nImmediately add 13.5 μL probe mix (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3])\nCritical: Do not let cells get dry at this step. We often go 3 wells at a time, pipetting probe mixes by hand. Use of an automated liquid handler that can handle viscous solutions (as the hybridization solution is quite viscous) may facilitate this step.\nCritical: Do not fully empty pipette when adding probe mix; this will cause bubbles that can interfere with the experiment.\nSeal plate with foil plate seal to block light and prevent evaporation\nTap plate firmly against benchtop to disrupt bubbles (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3])\nCritical: It is recommended to add fiducial beads to two wells on the plate at this step, as using beads to check proper alignment between imaging channels and realigning images in post-processing is recommended for high precision measurements. However, without cells to stick to beads tend to float in PBS, and so beads should be dried onto an empty well. Thus, if you are using beads as fiducial markers, do not cover these wells with foil.\nSpin plate 1 min at at least 100 g in a plate centrifuge\nDenature by placing plate directly onto preheated slide moat, at 85°C for 7.5 min",
    "Note: Most slide moats do not have completely flat surfaces; make sure that all wells are fully in contact with the metal surface of the slide moat.\nNote: This hybridization temperature and time has worked well for us for a variety of cell and probe types, but during optimization with different cell types and probe types we have tested anywhere from 75°C to 95°C and anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes (see troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.15]).\nImmediately move to humid hybridization chamber at 37°C, hybridize at least 18 h\nNote: Hybridization of repetitive regions is typically completed in around 30 minutes, and unique genome regions should be largely hybridized within 18 hours of hybridization.\nRinse once in 2× SSC at 20°C–22°C\nNote: This step mostly just dissolves and lifts the hybridization solution. You can instead aspirate the hybridization solution with a pipette if cells are sufficiently adherent.\nWash three times for 5 min in 1× SSC at 42°C\nWash three times for 5 min in 0.1× SSC at 42°C\nNote: These wash conditions have worked well for us with a variety of cell and probe types, but during troubleshooting we have tested a wide variety of different wash conditions including: changing the concentration, duration, and temperature of these washes, as well as adding formamide to these wash steps (see troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.17], troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.19]).\nStain with DAPI\nDilute DAPI in PBS\nIncubate 10 min at 20°C–22°C\nRinse once with PBS\nPlate with PBS, seal plate with foil\nNote: Imaging of high-throughput experiments in 384-well format requires an automated microscope designed for high content imaging such as a Perkin Elmer Opera, Yokogawa CV8000 or similar.\nPause point: Stained cells can be kept at 4°C, sealed as described, for up to one month before imaging, although prompt imaging is recommended.",

Technique of applying hybridization mix onto plates while minimizing bubbles formed, related to steps 17–19\nImage acquisition\nTiming: 3–12 h\nRoutinely, we image 10–20 fields per well, in four channels, in a z-stack around 10 microns high and with slices every half micron, in each of 45–100 wells per experiment.\nIf stored at 4°C prior to imaging, warm plate at 20°C–22°C for one hour or at 37°C for 15 min to prevent condensation on the bottom of the plate.\nMeanwhile, turn on the water line on the microscope for water immersion lenses\nClean the bottom of the plate with 70% ethanol and load it into the microscope\nFind the approximate focal plane and height of the cells in the DAPI channel\nVerify the signal-to-noise in all channels used: DAPI should be at least 5:1 and FISH signals should be easily discernible.\nProgram in the following image acquisition steps. Each channel’s acquisition should be unbinned and with the same z-stack, centered around the determined software focus. Optimize the laser power and exposure time so that all FISH channels have good signal-to-noise ratios (3-fold is ideal) and the signal is not oversaturated:\nSoftware focus optimizing the DAPI channel focus within a 10 μm z-stack surrounding the approximate focal plane found in step 32.\nDAPI image acquisition (Ex: 405, Em: 445/50)\nDyomics DY488 or another green fluorophore acquisition (Ex: 488, Em: 525/50)\nDyomics DY549P1 or another red fluorophore acquisition (Ex: 561, Em: 600/27)\nDyomics DY647P1 or another deep red fluorophore acquisition (Ex: 640, Em: 676/29)",
    "Note: When selecting your z-slicing interval, consider whether you will be analyzing data as maximal projections (i.e. in 2D) or 3D volumes. If the former, a z-slice interval around the same size as the depth of field of the lens (around 1 μm) will limit imaging time while not missing any signals. However, in 3D this often causes artifacts as voxels are extremely uneven in size and 3D centers cannot be determined with great precision. As such, for 3D analyses we recommend oversampling in z by at least 3-fold (i.e. a z-slice interval around 300 nm).\nCritical: Do not optimize imaging conditions in only one well if different probes are used in different wells as there can be considerable variability across the plate. We recommend verifying imaging conditions in at least 5–10 wells.\nProgram the microscope to acquire sufficient fields of view to image 1,000 cells per condition.\nSave and launch the routine."
