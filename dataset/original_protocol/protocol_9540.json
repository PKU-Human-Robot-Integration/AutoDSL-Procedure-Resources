    "1. SBDS-FlAsH Tag Protein Expression and Purification\nNOTE: For the anisotropy experiments, a FlAsH-tag corresponding to the sequence Cys-Cys-Pro-Gly-Cys-Cys was added to the C-terminus of the human SBDS coding sequence by PCR. This construct was subcloned into the expression vector pRSET-A and transformed into Escherichia coli C41 cells to express a protein encoding a N-terminal hexahistidine tag (His-tag), the human SBDS coding sequence and a C-terminus FlAsH tag 10.\nSBDS-FlAsH protein expression\nTransform competent E. coli C41 cells with the plasmid pRSET-HisSBDS-FlAsH using a standard heat shock protocol 19. Plate the cells in solid Luria-Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin. LB solid media composition consists of 10 g NaCl, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g tryptone and 20 g agar for 1 L volume.\nCulture transformed bacteria at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm (A600) reaches 0.5-0.7 in 1 L of LB liquid media supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin.\nInduce protein expression by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside to the culture and continue the incubation for further 5 hr.\nCollect the bacterial suspension by centrifugation at 3,800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant. At this point, either store the cell pellet at -20 °C or use immediately for protein purification.\nSBDS-FlAsH protein purification\n\tNOTE: All chromatographic steps are performed using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system or a peristaltic pump. Ni2+-affinity chromatography uses a 5 ml fast flow column. Anionic exchange chromatography uses a 5 ml strong sulfopropyl cation exchanger column. A flow rate of 3 ml/min was used for all the chromatographic steps.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 35 ml of SBDS Lysis buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and lyse by sonication for a total time of 4 min using cycles of 10 sec ON and 30 sec OFF, at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the sample at 9,000 x g for 50 min at 4 °C.\nKeep the supernatant and discard the pellet to remove cellular debris.\nEquilibrate the Ni2+ affinity column with 3 column volumes (CV) of SBDS Lysis buffer and introduce the whole clarified supernatant onto the column.\nRemove unbound protein by washing with 3 CV of SBDS Lysis buffer and elute with 3 CV of SBDS Elution buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole).\nDilute the eluted protein 6-fold with 50 mM Phosphate buffer pH 6.5 and remove possible aggregates by filtration through a 0.22 µm cellulose membrane.\nEquilibrate the sulfopropyl cation exchanger column with 3 CV of Low salt S column buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl) and introduce the protein sample from the previous step.\nWash unbound material with 3 CV of Low salt S column buffer and elute the protein in one step with 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5, 1 M NaCl.\nDilute the eluted protein 3.3-fold with 50 mM Phosphate buffer pH 6.5. Concentrate the protein with ultrafiltration devices by centrifugation at 3,800 x g for 15 min. Flash freeze the protein in liquid nitrogen and store it at -80 °C until further use.\nVerify the purity of the protein by SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie staining 20.\n2. EFL1 Protein Expression and Purification",
    "NOTE: EFL1 was expressed under the regulation of the Gal 1/10 divergent promoter 21 and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MATA 3'UTR in the vector pRS426. The recombinant protein encodes the human EFL1 isoform 1 fused to a Tobacco Etch Virus protease (TEV) recognition site and a hexahistidine tag at the C-terminus.\nEFL1 protein expression\nTransform S. cerevisiae BCY123 cells with the plasmid pRS426-EFL1TevHis using a standard Lithium acetate protocol 22. Plate all the transformed cells in synthetic drop out media without uracil (SD-URA) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose. Composition of the SD-URA media consists of 8 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 11 g casamino acids, 55 mg adenine sulfate, 55 mg tyrosine, 60 mg leucine and 60 mg tryptophan for 1 L volume.\nCulture transformed yeast at 30 °C until A600 reaches 1.8 in 1 L of SD-URA media supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose.\nInduce protein expression by adding 2.8% (w/v) galactose to the culture and continue the incubation for further 18 hr at 30 °C.\nCollect the yeast suspension by centrifugation at 3,800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant. At this point, either store the cell pellet at -20 °C or use immediately for protein purification.\nEFL1 protein purification\n\tNOTE: All chromatographic steps are performed using a FPLC system or a peristaltic pump. Ni2+-affinity chromatography uses a 5 ml fast flow column at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Size exclusion chromatography uses a 125 ml column pre-packed with Superdex 200 resin at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 50 ml of EFL1 Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM benzamidine and disrupt the cells by friction on a bead beater using glass beads (Ø = 0.5 mm) for a total time of 6 min using cycles of 2 min ON and 15 min OFF, at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the sample at 9,000 x g for 50 min at 4 °C.\nKeep the supernatant and discard the pellet to remove cellular debris.\nEquilibrate the Ni2+ affinity column with 3 CV of EFL1 Lysis buffer and introduce all the clarified supernatant onto the column.\nRemove unbound protein by washing with 3 CV of EFL1 Lysis buffer and elute with 3 CV of EFL1 Elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol).\nEquilibrate the size exclusion column with 1.5 CV of Anisotropy buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol).\nConcentrate to 1 ml the EFL1 protein eluted from the Ni2+ affinity column with ultrafiltration devices by centrifugation at 3,800 x g to the desired volume.

Measurements were done at 25 °C in a 200 µl cuvette with a 5 mm path length 10.\nIn a fluorescence cuvette, place 200 µl of 30 nM SBDS-FlAsH in anisotropy buffer and titrate 2 µl of 30 µM EFL1. Mix thoroughly and let the reaction stand for 3 min before measuring the anisotropy value.\nRepeat step 4.1 until a total volume of 40 µl of EFL1 has been added.\n5. Data Analysis\nFit the data to the appropriate binding model using a nonlinear least squares regression algorithm. Equations for the most common binding models are presented in Table 1.\nEvaluate the best model that describes the interaction between the proteins by inspecting the residuals of the fit 23.
