  "procedures": [
    "1. Generation of Cationic Nanoliposomes (Figure 1)\nDissolve the lipids DC-cholesterol (3β-[N-(N′,N′-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl]cholesterol hydrochloride) and DOPE (dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine), delivered as a powder, in chloroform to achieve a final concentration of 25 mg/mL.\n\tNote: Store the dissolved lipids at -20 °C.\nWork with 25 mg/mL stock solution of both lipids. Mix 40 µL of the dissolved DC-cholesterol and 80 µL of the dissolved DOPE in a glass flask.\n\tNote: The total lipid amount is 3 mg. To avoid fast evaporation of the chloroform, place the lipids on ice during pipetting.\nVaporize the chloroform for 15 min under an argon gas flow. Subsequently, fill a desiccator with silica gel, place the open glass flask inside, and apply a vacuum overnight to make sure that the remaining chloroform is evaporated, and a lipid film is formed inside the glass flask.\n\tNote: Work fast and avoid unnecessary O2 contact.\nRehydrate the formed lipid film with 1 mL of nuclease-free water and vortex the suspension for 15 min (Figure 2A). Afterward, place the suspension into a sonication bath for 1 h (Figure 2B).\n\tNote: The suspension will be slightly cloudy.\nAssemble the mini extruder according to the manufacturer's instructions, fill a syringe with the lipid suspension, and place the filled syringe and an empty syringe on both sides of the extruder. Press the lipid suspension through the membrane from one syringe to the other, 20x – 25x, to extrude the suspension (Figure 2C).\n\tNote: The size of the NLps is determined by the pore size of the membrane used.\nStore the NLps in a glass flask at 4 °C until further use.\n\tNote: After prolonged storage time, the NLps should be placed in the sonication bath again for 15 min by 35 kHz to circumvent complex formation.\n2. In Vitro Transcription of Synthetic mRNA",
    "Prepare the eGFP-encoding mRNA following the protocol published earlier34.\nAmplify the eGFP sequence from the plasmid with 0.7 µM of the forward (5’-TTG GAC CCT CGT ACA GAA GCT AAT ACG-3’) and reverse (5’-T120 CTT CTT ACT CAG GCT TTA TTC AAA GAC CA-3’) primers and the polymerase kit with PCR.\n\t\nMix 20 µL of a commercial buffer solution which changes the melting behavior of DNA (Table of Materials), as well as 20 µL of the 5x mix from the polymerase kit.
