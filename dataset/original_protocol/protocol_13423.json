    "Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the International Guidelines on Handling of Laboratory Animals, demanded by the European Directive (Directive 86/609/EEC of 1986 and Directive 2010/63/UE) and Italian laws (D.Lgs. 26/2014).\n1. Setup of the PET/CT imaging protocols and workflow\nNOTE: The protocol presented here is specifically designed for cardiac imaging of mouse models. Working with rats might imply some modifications to the actual protocol, mainly because of the bigger size of the animal (roughly 10x heavier). The modifications for rat imaging are specifically mentioned in the steps; if no modifications are mentioned, then the same steps for mouse imaging can be used for rats.\nOpen the graphical user interface (GUI) of the PET/CT scanner (see Table of Materials) and create a set of new protocols (inclusive of parameters for data acquisition, preprocessing, and image reconstruction): (i) a dynamic PET scan, (ii) a low-dose CT scan for attenuation correction (CTAC) without contrast agent, and (iii) a contrast-enhanced Cine-CT scan.\n\tNOTE: The creation of new protocols (i.e., specific software instructions for the tomograph) for the acquisition, preprocessing, and reconstruction phases is a straightforward process; in case of trouble, the user can find more detailed information in the GUI user manual.\n\t\nFor the PET scan, open the Protocol tab of the scanner (GUI) and create three new protocols (for acquisition, preprocessing, and reconstruction) with the following parameters:\n\t\t\nFor the acquisition protocol: set 3,600 s total scan time and single bed position. Save this protocol with a proper name for subsequent import into the workflow. Do the same also for all the next protocols in the following points.",
    "For the preprocessing protocol for mouse: select a 250-750 keV energy window (EW) and enable the following corrections: radioactive decay, random coincidences, and dead time. Set the framing protocol (i.e., dynamic splitting of the raw data) as follows: 8 x 5 s, 8 x 10 s, 3 x 40 s, 2 x 60 s, 2 x 120 s, 10 x 300 s (= 3,600 s). For rat, select a 350-750 keV energy window (EW), using the same framing as for the mouse protocol.\nFor the reconstruction protocol: select the high-quality, Monte Carlo-based 3D Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (3D-OSEM-MC) algorithm, with 8 subsets and 8 iterations, with normalization, quantitative correction, and CT attenuation correction enabled.\nFor the low-dose CT scan for attenuation correction (CTAC), use the following parameters:\n\t\t\nFor the acquisition protocol: single frame, single bed position, full-scan; tube settings: 80 kV, low-current (low-dose); 576 views over 360°, with 34 ms of exposure time per view (20 s scan time); rotation type: continuous, sensitivity mode: high sensitivity.\nFor the preprocessing protocol: 240 µm voxel size, transversal FOV: Rat, axial FOV: 100%.\nFor the reconstruction protocol: filter window: smooth, voxel size: standard, enable beam hardening and ring precorrection, disable ring artifact post correction.\nFor the contrast-enhanced gated CT scan, create three new protocols (for acquisition, preprocessing, and reconstruction) with the following settings:\n\t\t\nFor the acquisition protocol for mouse: set single frame, single bed position, full-scan; tube settings: 65 kV, full-current (low-noise); 8,000 views over 360°, with 15 ms of exposure time per view (120 s scan time); rotation type: continuous, sensitivity mode: high sensitivity. For rat, set the acquisition protocol parameters as follows: 80 kV tube voltage, 16,000 views over 360°, with 12 ms exposure time per view (192 s scan time).",
    "For the preprocessing protocol for mouse: select 120 µm voxel size; transversal Field of View (FOV): Mouse; axial FOV: 50%. For rat, select a 240 µm voxel size; transversal Field of View (FOV): Rat; axial FOV: 50%.\nFor the reconstruction protocol: filter windows: smooth, voxel size: standard; enable beam hardening and ring precorrection, disable ring artifact post correction.\nOpen the Workflow tab in the GUI, and create a new workflow, adding the protocols just created: steps 1.1.1.1-1.1.1.3 for PET, steps 1.1.2.1. -1.1.2.3. for CTAC, and steps 1.1.3.1. -1.1.3.3. for gated CT, in the given order. In both cases, ensure that the protocols are nested with the following order: Acquisition | Preprocessing | Reconstruction.\n\t\tNOTE: Dynamic PET frames with durations <5 s to better capture the peak of the arterial input function at the beginning of the PET scan are possible but are not recommended as this can lead to noisy images with reduced quantitative accuracy. In step 1.1.2.2, we have used the \"Rat\" size for the transversal FOV. This is commonly used for both rats and mice in CTAC.\n2. Animal preparation for PET/CT imaging\nNOTE: For the present protocol, all animals were fasted overnight.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3%-4% (v/v) isoflurane in an induction chamber initially, and then maintain with 1%-2% (v/v) isoflurane.\nWeigh the mouse and measure the basal glycemia to monitor the condition of the animal. To take the required blood sample, use sharp scissors and make a small cut at the tail tip, then gently massage the tail to collect a droplet of blood (~1 µL) directly on the test strip.\nProceed with the insertion of a venous access at the level of the caudal vein using a 29 G butterfly for mouse and 24 G for rat.",
    "To perform the cannulation technique, use concurrent heating (typically, under a heating lamp) and disinfection of the point where the needle is inserted for vasodilation of the vein. After cannulation, fix the butterfly with a silk ribbon to the tail to keep it in place during the procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: Fasting is required for [18F]FDG studies. Different tracers might involve different animal preparation, but a thorough discussion on this topic is outside of the scope of the present protocol. As far as [18F]FDG is concerned, avoiding fasting leads to very different tracer biodistribution16.\nTurn on the anesthesia system (isoflurane 1%-2%, 0.8 L/min O2 for mouse and 1-1.2 L/min for rat) connected to the PET-CT scanner and transfer the mouse to the bed.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position, head first, on the scanner bed of the PET-CT tomograph, putting its nose in the nose mask for anesthesia and gently blocking the head of the mouse to the mask with adhesive tape.\nFix the upper and lower limbs of the mouse on the scanner bed to prevent any involuntary movements during the imaging procedures, which may lead to motion artifacts.\nMonitor the body temperature and respiration rate using a rectal probe and a respiration pillow, respectively.\n3. PET tracer dose preparation\nFor mice, draw 10 MBq of [18F]FDG in a volume of 100-150 µL with an insulin syringe (1 mL). For rats, draw a higher dose of 15 MBq in 0.20-0.25 mL.\n\tNOTE: Avoid higher activity as the PET scanner discussed in this protocol has very high sensitivity and just requires a modest amount of activity to obtain high-quality images.\nIf the original concentration of the tracer in the vial is too high, use physiological solution (0.9% w/v NaCl) to dilute the tracer dose to a concentration of 50-100 MBq/mL.",
    "Use the PET dose calibrator to measure the actual activity in the syringe. Annotate the preinjection activity and time of measurement as these values will be used later using specific input modules of the PET scanner GUI.\n4. CT contrast agent preparation\nDraw 0.2 mL per 20 g of mouse weight of iodinated lipid emulsion contrast agent into a 1 mL syringe. Limit the volume of injection to 0.5 mL of CA for heavier mice. If using iomeprol, set the injection rate for mice to 10 mL/h (~0.17 mL/min) and limit the injection volume to 0.5 mL.\n\t\nFor rats, draw 2.3-3 mL of iomeprol, diluted to a concentration of 200 mg/mL, into a 5 mL syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: If small-animal lipid emulsion CA is not available, iomeprol with continuous injection by means of a syringe pump can be used, as discussed below.\nConnect the syringe to the syringe pump, and set the pump for the actual syringe size and diameter.\nConnect the syringe to the CA tubing and needle, and prefill the tubing with the CA.\nSet the injection rate to 24 mL/h (= 0.4 mL/min), limiting the injection to a maximum volume of 2 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Using blood-pool CA based on iodinated lipid emulsion is also possible in rats, despite the relatively high cost of this procedure due to the larger volume of a single injection. If this option is preferred (e.g., to simplify the protocol by avoiding the syringe pump), the following procedure can be employed:\nDraw 7.5 mL per kg of body weight of iodinated lipid emulsion contrast agent into a 5 mL syringe. Limit the volume of injection to 2 mL of CA also for heavier rats.\n5. Animal alignment and preliminary operations before imaging",
    "Upon immobilization of the animal on the imaging bed, create a new study on the tomograph GUI. Add a study name identifier in the Study name module and select the imaging workflow previously saved from the dropdown menu.\nSelect the proper anatomical part with Animal/Specimen information | Anatomical part | Cardiac and animal positioning by Animal/Specimen information | Positioning | Supine/Head first. Annotate the animal weight in grams for the corresponding module: Animal/Specimen information | Animal weight.\n\tNOTE: All other information in this section is optional, but it is useful to provide as much as possible of the requested information to find it in the DICOM header of the reconstruction images, thus facilitating subsequent data querying.\nSelect the radionuclide in PET Scan information | F18 for [18F]FDG studies and other 18F-labeled compounds; modify if other tracers (e.g., [13N]NH3) are used. Write also the name of the tracer in the PET Scan information | Tracer name module as this name will be reported in the DICOM header upon completion of the image reconstruction.\n\tNOTE: The information about tracer injection time, activity, and volume is mandatory but could be provided later during the PET acquisition.\nIn the CT scan information, write all the available information regarding the contrast agent.\n\tNOTE: All this information is optional but could facilitate subsequent data querying if provided.\nPress Perform scan and wait for another tab of the GUI to be opened, allowing animal positioning and the specification of other scanning options.\nSelect CT calibration type in CT calibration | Use default CT calibration.\nIn the Study preparation section, select each scanning protocol from the dropdown menu, and check the Wait for user confirmation before this scan checkbox.",
    "NOTE: This step is very important, as it will put the scanner in standby waiting for user input before starting the corresponding acquisition phase. For the PET scan, this will allow the synchronization of the tracer injection and actual PET scan start; for the CTAC scan, it will allow the user to close the lid (shielding) before the emission of X-rays during the CT scan (the study will be automatically aborted if the lid is open before the CT scan start); for the Cine-CT scan, this pause will allow the user to initiate the CA infusion protocol and CT data scanning with the required delay.\nFor animal positioning, switch on the Motor control module using the switch on the left pane of the GUI.\n\tNOTE: This will switch on the centering lasers on the animal bed and enable the manual bed alignment buttons placed on the side of the scanner.\nUse the manual bed alignment buttons to move the chest of the animal onto the laser marks. Check carefully both the longitudinal and vertical alignment of the animal.\nOnce the animal is placed in the correct position according to the centering laser, press Switch off the laser to save the current laser-marked position, which is to be moved to the center of the PET and CT scanners during the corresponding acquisition phases. Afterward, switch off the motor control module.\n6. PET scan\nPress Start acquisition to move the animal onto the PET scanner FOV. The tail and the cannula will remain outside the FOV to allow tracer injection. The scanner will stay idle until the user presses the Continue button.\nPrepare the syringe with the calibrated PET tracer dose.",
    "Start the acquisition by pressing the Continue button and start injecting the tracer in the cannula within 5 s from the scan start (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The injection duration will be ~20-25 s.\nPut the syringe in the PET dose calibrator to measure the residual activity in the syringe. Annotate the actual activity and the time of measurement.\nIn the Hardware monitor tab of the scanner GUI, use the Update PET tracer info button to insert the actual injected time, activity, and volume.\nDuring the scan, check the animal's physiological parameters periodically.\nDuring the scan, measure the glycemia as explained in step 2.2 at the following time points: 5 min, 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min after the beginning of the PET scan.\nAfter the measurement of glycemia, put the test strip in the gamma counter and perform the activity measurement for 60 s. Record the actual time at which the activity measurement has been carried out, and correct for radioactive decay, taking the tracer injection time as a reference time. Convert the recorded activity values into activity concentration (Bq/mL) by considering an average blood volume of 1 µL in the glucose test strip (i.e., by using equation [1]):\n\tCblood(t) = Ablood(t)/0.001 mL [Bq/mL]    (1)\n\twhere Ablood(t) is the decay corrected measured activity of the blood sample in the test strip, expressed in Bq.",
    "NOTE: The PET scan start and tracer injection can be performed by the same operator by using the tomograph's mobile controlling device placed on the lateral table of the scanner close to the site of the operator during injection. Longer delays between the scan start and the beginning of the injection are allowed, but some reconstructed frame at the beginning of the dynamic sequence will remain blank. It is recommended to avoid delays greater than 10 s (i.e., leading to two blank frames with the current protocol).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64066/64066fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Injection of the PET tracer. This operation is performed right after the PET scan start. The animal is inside the PET field of view (head first, with its tail visible on the operator's side).

CT scans\nBefore injecting the CT contrast agent, start the CTAC scan right after closing the scanner's lid and pressing the Continue button on the GUI. At the end of this very short acquisition, employ the following procedures to ensure proper enhancement of the blood pool by injecting the CA prior to acquisition using the same vascular access employed for the injection of the PET tracer.\n\t\nIodinated lipid emulsion CA:\n\t\t\nAfter completion of the CTAC scan, inject the iodinated lipid emulsion CA using the cannula already connected to the mouse tail vein. The typical injection duration is in the order of 30-60 s.\nStart the imaging right after completion of the injection. Press Continue on the scanner GUI to start the Cine-CT acquisition.\nIomeprol/syringe pump:\n\t\t\nIf a normal X-ray CA is used, such as iomeprol, use a syringe pump allowing slow injection at a constant rate.",
    "For mice, set the injection rate of the CA to 10 mL/h (~0.17 mL/min) by limiting the volume of injection to 0.5 mL. With this setting, stop the injection after ~3 min. For rats, set the pump to a rate of 24 mL/h (= 0.4 mL/min) and limit the volume of injection to 2 mL. With this setting, stop the injection after 5 min.\nConnect the needle attached to the CA tubing to the tail vein's cannula, ensuring that both the tubing and the needle are prefilled with CA.\nStart the injection. Close the scanner's lid and prepare for the Cine-CT scan.\nPress the Continue button on the tomograph's GUI after 60 s from the beginning of the injection for mice and after 90 s from the beginning of the injection for rats, so that the Cine-CT acquisition is started. The injection of CA will stop roughly at the same time as the Cine-CT scan completion for mice and upon completion for rats.\nUpon completion of the Cine-CT scan, disconnect the animal from the physiological monitoring system and remove the tail vein cannula. Depending on the actual protocol, animals are either recovered or euthanized after the described imaging procedure. In the first case, animals are awakened in their cages in a warm environment under an infrared lamp. They are monitored until complete awakening, taking 15/30 min after gaseous anesthesia. In case of protocols requiring e.g., tissue harvesting at the end of the imaging procedure, animals are euthanized using a anesthetic overdose in an induction chamber (5% isoflurane), as per Annex VI of D.Lgs. 26/2014.",
    "NOTE: In the case of 18F-based radionuclides as discussed in this protocol, 24 h after tracer injection are sufficient to reach a level of residual radioactivity on the animal's body that is safe for all practical purposes.\n8. Reconstruction of the cardiac 4DCT images using intrinsic cardiorespiratory gating\nNOTE: Upon completion of the imaging study, the standard PET and CT reconstruction is automatically performed. Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the 4D (Cine) cardio CT sequence must be performed manually and requires some user interaction. This special type of reconstruction, mandatory for the subsequent morpho-functional cardiac CT analysis, is discussed in this section.\nOpen the cardiac gating module of the tomogragh's GUI and select the imaging study to be analyzed.\nSelect a region of interest (ROI) on the displayed animal's radiographs (Figure 2) for building a time-dependent cardiac motion curve, representing the gating signal-the kymogram. Vertically move the predrawn rectangular ROI in such a way that both the heart apex and the diaphragm are selected. Then, select Gating signal analysis. The user interface will now show the gating signal both on the time domain and frequency domain.\nIn the first frequency domain graph, select the respiratory frequency band by highlighting the first group of peaks of the frequency spectrum (refer to Figure 3 for an example spectrum).\nIn the second frequency-domain graph, select the cardiac motion frequency band, highlighting the second sharpest peak.\nIn the next phase, observe the time-domain gating signal with color markers (dots) superimposed, showing the identified respiration peaks and cardiac contraction peaks. If the marker positions fit well with the respiratory and cardiac peaks of the original gating signal, proceed to the next phase. Otherwise:",
    "If the shape of the gating signal is too different from that displayed in Figure 3, go back to step 8.2 and select another ROI.\nIf the shape of the gating signal is reasonably similar to the one shown in Figure 3, go back to step 8.3 and step 8.4 and select different frequency bands on the gating signal spectrum.\nIn the next phase, select a minimum of four cardiac gates.\n\tNOTE: Typical Cine-CT reconstruction consists of 8-12 cardiac gates.\nSelect the proper respiratory window by using the dropdown menu: Respiratory window | 20%-80%.\n\tNOTE: This will retain 60% of the acquired data in the reconstruction, excluding the phase of peak inspiration and, thus, improving the sharpness of the reconstructed myocardial walls in each cardiac phase.\nPerform reconstruction to convert the retrospectively gated Cine-CT images into DICOM format, ready to be imported into the software for subsequent functional analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64066/64066fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: ROI selection tool for intrinsic gating. This image is shown in the tomograph's GUI during the Cine-CT reconstruction phase. The user must select the position of the ROI (yellow rectangle) on which the intrinsic gating signal (kymogram) is obtained from the raw CT projections. The circular-shaped object superimposed to the animal chest is the respiratory pillow used only for physiological monitoring during the study.

    "Figure 3: Example gating signal (top frame) and corresponding frequency spectrum (center and bottom). Images obtained with the cardiac gating module of the Atrium software. The user must select the proper frequency bands for both respiratory (center frame) and cardiac motion (bottom frame). This will allow the identification of the respiratory and cardiac markers on the gating signal, which must be checked by the user before proceeding with the 4D reconstruction. Bad identification of the peaks or wrong assignment (e.g., respiratory to cardiac, or vice versa) will lead to incorrect reconstruction. The data shown were obtained from the analysis of a 4D Cine-CT scan of a healthy, adult male Wistar rat (507 g) injected with 2 mL of iomeprol, 200 mg/mL, at the rate of 0.4 mL/min for 5 min (the graph on top is zoomed in on the first 22 s of acquisition to allow better visualization of the identified cardiac and respiratory motion).

PET cardiac analysis\nNOTE: This section shows how to perform a kinetic analysis of dynamic [18F]FDG data of the small-animal left ventricle. The analysis is based on the Carimas software. The instructions below are not meant to be a replacement for the software user manual17. The procedure presented below is based on the Patlak graphical analysis of dynamic PET data18. Refer to the Discussion section for details regarding this analysis.\nOpen the DICOM images of the dynamic PET scan.\nSelect the HeartPlugin module.\nZoom into the image on the mouse/rat heart, and select the last time frame (or equivalently, the sum of the last three to five time frames) for which most of the blood-pool activity has been already washed out.",
    "Follow the on-screen instruction to reorient the image along the principal axis of the animal heart (short axis, vertical, and horizontal long axis). Do this interactively by moving the displayed markers for the heart base and apex (Figure 4).\nSelect the Segmentation tool.\n\tNOTE: By default, automatic segmentation is enabled, which yields reliable results in most cases.\nIf the result of the automatic segmentation is not acceptable, refine the shape of the segmented myocardium and/or LV cavity by enabling the Manual Mode (ROI Search Disabled).\nIn the Modeling Tool, select the appropriate kinetic model to be used for dynamic PET analysis. In this case, select Graphical | Patlak to enable the Patlak plot analysis for the computation of the metabolic rate of glucose uptake (MRGlu) for each cardiac sector.\nIn the polarmap tool, select the correct number of displayed heart segments. In this case, select 17 segments.\nNow, press the Fit button to perform the fitting procedure of the Patlak analysis.\nAt the end of the fitting procedure, observe the displayed polar map of the Ki values (i.e., the slope of the linear regression expressed in mL/[mL × min]).\nUsing the Ki values for each sector shown in a table, calculate the MRGlu using equation (2):\n\tMRGlu = (Ki × PGlu)/LC    (2)\n\twhere PGlu is a blood-sample-derived value of the plasma glucose concentration (mmol/L), and the lumped constant (LC) is an empirical coefficient used to compensate for the difference in uptake between normal glucose and FDG. See, for instance, Ng et al.22 for typical values of the lumped constant in various experimental conditions.",
    "NOTE: Before starting PET analysis, it is good practice to visually inspect the dynamic sequence of PET volumes within the PET analysis software tool. This is necessary to exclude macroscopic animal motion between time frames during the study. If motion is present, proper image registration (outside of the scope of this protocol) should be carried out before analysis, if possible.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64066/64066fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Reorientation tool of the PET analysis software. The projection of two simple line segments in 3D space is shown on each of the three standard planes (transaxial, coronal, and sagittal). The first segment allows the user to select the heart base and apex, while the second one allows for selecting the left and right sides of the heart. This step results in a new (interpolated) PET image (bottom row), with the heart reoriented along the standard AHA representation. Images were obtained with Carimas from a healthy adult male CD-1 mouse weighing 51 g and injected with 10 MBq of [18F]FDG.

Cine-CT cardiac analysis\nNOTE: This section shows how to perform quantitative analysis of the Cine-CT cardiac image to collect global quantitative data of the heart function. The analysis is based on the Osirix MD software. The instructions below are not meant to be a replacement for the Osirix user manual24.\nLoad the DICOM images of the Cine-CT scan in the software.\nOpen the dynamic dataset with the built-in 4D viewer.\nUsing the 3D Multiplanar Reformation (MPR) tool, reorient the image data along the short axis (Figure 5).",
    "Export the reoriented data to DICOM, ensuring that the entire 4D data are exported, with preserved slice thickness (same as the original) and image bit depth (16 bit per voxel)\nOpen the exported 4D MPR images using the 4D viewer.\nSelect a time frame corresponding to end-diastole. Browse through all the time frames with the time slider on the main toolbar to ensure that the correct cardiac phase is selected.\nOn this time frame, pick the closed polygon annotation tool and manually delineate the endocardial wall of the LV.\nDo the same for 10-20 slices from the base to the apex, ensuring that all the ROIs have the same name (e.g., LVENDO).\nOn the ROI menu, select ROI Volume | Generate missing ROIs to generate the ROIs on all the short axis slices by interpolation of the manually drawn ROIs.\nOn the ROI menu, select ROI Volume | Compute Volume to calculate the volume of the ROI group with the same ROI name.\nBrowse through the time frames and select a phase corresponding to end-systole (smaller LV volume) and repeat steps 10.7-10.10 above.\nCalculate the stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction using equations (3) and (4):\n\tSV = EDV - ESV[mL]    (3)\n\tEF = 100 × SV/EDV [%]    (4)\n\twhere EDV is the end-diastolic volume and ESV is the end-systolic volume.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64066/64066fig05.jpg",
    "Figure 5: Graphical interface of the multiplanar reformation tool. This tool is used for the reorientation of the Cine-CT data for subsequent functional analysis. The user shall rotate and translate the reference axes on the left side of the screen in such a way that the short-axis view of the heart is shown on the right. At the end of this procedure, the user can export the reoriented images as a DICOM file set. The images were obtained with Osirix MD and refer to a healthy adult male Wistar rat (507 g) injected with 2 mL of iomeprol, 200 mg/mL, at a rate of 0.4 mL/min for 5 min, reconstructed with Filtered BackProjection with a voxel size of 0.24 mm3.
