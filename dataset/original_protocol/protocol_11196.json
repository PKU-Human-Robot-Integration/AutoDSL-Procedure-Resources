    "All described animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\n1. Preparation of cell lines\nGrow cell lines in accordance with the laboratory’s standard cell culture protocols for traditional cell culture or injection into mice. Standard protocols used here are growth in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (hereafter known as complete growth medium).\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, Abrams osteosarcoma cells are used in Balb/c Foxn1 nu/nu mice. For breast cancer studies, 4T1 cells in Balb/c mice and EO771 cells in C57BL/6 mice are used.\nGrow cells in either vented tissue culture flasks or 6-well tissue culture plates at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nPassage the cell line of interest and prepare the cells for injection when the cells reach a confluency commonly used with injection of these cells into mice.\n2. Animals\nUse Balb/c Foxn1 nu/nu mice at least 6-8 weeks of age for subcutaneous tumor generation to ensure that the animals are beyond the rapid growth phase and have achieved adulthood and skeletal maturity.\nUse either male or female mice. Make exceptions when selecting hormone-responsive cell lines (e.g., breast cancer cells in female mice and prostate cancer cells in male mice).\nFor xenograft experiments, use immunodeficient athymic nude mice based on the cell line being incompatible with an intact mouse immune system under normal conditions.\nFor allograft experiments using murine cell lines, this is also recommended based on dissimilar mouse genetic and immune backgrounds. However, for syngeneic experiments, use animals of the same strain as the cell line of interest.\nHouse animals at standard densities depending on the institution’s husbandry policies.\n3. Subcutaneous tumors\nHarvest cell lines from culture by trypsinization and resuspend in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).",
    "Assess cell viability and determine the cell density by the trypan blue exclusion method. Use a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter to count the cells. A minimum cell viability of 90% is to be used for injection into mice to create subcutaneous tumors.\nAdjust the cell density to inject 1-2 x 105 cells in a final volume of 0.1 to 0.15 mL (100 to 150 µL) of sterile PBS. Keep the cells on ice until injection.\nAlternatively, pellet cells by centrifuging at 800 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pelleted cells in undiluted sterile basement membrane matrix medium to obtain 1-2 x 105 cells in a final volume of 0.1 to 0.15 mL (100 to 150 µL). Keep the cells on ice until further use.\nAnesthetize mice to be used for subcutaneous tumor growth with isoflurane in oxygen anesthesia. Use an induction dose of 5% isoflurane in 2 L/min oxygen and a maintenance dose of 2-3% isoflurane in 2 L/min oxygen. Check for the lack of blink or pedal reflexes before proceeding further.\n\tNOTE: Isoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic. Use isoflurane in a well-ventilated area with appropriate scavenging and free gas collection systems. Please consult with the institutional veterinary staff to develop a plan for anesthesia induction, maintenance, and monitoring, and ensure that the laboratory staff have appropriate training in anesthesia monitoring and the handling of inhalant anesthetic agents.\nRemove hair from the dorsal region of the thorax or abdomen of anesthetized mice with depilating solution or with an electric clipper. Depilating solution is preferred to minimize potential trauma to the skin. Skip this step if using athymic nude mice.\nClean the prepared area with a 70% ethanol swab prior to injection of the cell suspension.",
    "Use a 1 mL tuberculin syringe with a 27 G needle to inject cells subcutaneously over the dorsal region of the thorax or abdomen, not to be impacted by movement of the shoulder blades. Alternatively, inject the cells subcutaneously as a suspension in commercially available extracellular matrix.\n\tNOTE: Injection in commercially available extracellular matrix will limit migration of the cell suspension in the subcutaneous space because these matrices solidify at room temperature.\nRecover the mice on a heating pad in individual cages until ambulatory. Mice can then be placed in their normal cages with clean, dry bedding.\nMonitor the size of the subcutaneous tumor overlying the dorsal thorax or abdomen with a caliper and measure body weights weekly to ensure that the subcutaneous tumors do not ulcerate or mice meet early removal criteria as established by the institutions’ animal care and use committee. A maximum tumor size of 15 mm in any dimension is recommended to reduce the risk of skin ulceration or central tumor necrosis.\n\tNOTE: Consult local guidelines to determine maximum permissible tumor size/volume.\nEuthanize mice bearing subcutaneous tumors after three to four weeks by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Follow institution’s acceptable policies for mouse euthanasia.\nHarvest subcutaneous tumors using aseptic surgical technique. Sterilize the skin overlying the tumor as before with 70% ethanol after removal of the hair (if applicable). Incise through the skin overlying the tumor with a #15 scalpel blade (with or without a scalpel blade handle). Sharply dissect the tumor from the surrounding attached soft tissues with a pair of sterile surgical scissors.",
    "Place the tumor in 6-well tissue culture plates containing complete growth medium and mince into multiple small fragments of pre-determined size (~ 0.6 mm x 0.6 mm x 0.6 mm – 0.25 mm3 up to 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm – 1 mm3) with a #15 scalpel blade (with or without a scalpel blade handle).\nMaintain tumor fragments in sterile complete growth medium at room temperature until the time of intratibial implantation. For cell lines that carry luciferase or fluorescent reporter genes, use ex-vivo bioluminescent or fluorescent imaging to confirm tumor viability ahead of intratibial implantation into mice.\nFor cryopreservation, place multiple fragments in the same cryovial in complete growth medium supplemented with 20% FBS and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Freeze gradually using a commercial cryopreservation system at –80 °C and store long-term in liquid nitrogen. Preserve tumor fragments for subsequent analysis, but not for future implantation, by snap freezing using liquid nitrogen immersion. Store these frozen tumor fragments for long-term at –80 °C.\n\tNOTE: It has been previously reported that snap frozen tumors will not engraft and grow in vivo8.\n4. Surgical implantation of subcutaneous tumor fragments\nBring fresh or cryopreserved fragments of subcutaneous tumor to room temperature in complete growth medium prior to surgical implantation.\nAnesthetize mice of the strain of interest using isoflurane in oxygen anesthesia as described in Section 3. Check for the lack of pedal reflexes before proceeding. Administer subcutaneous buprenorphine at a dose of 0.02-0.05 mg/kg to provide peri-operative analgesia. This can be repeated every 6-8 h in the post-operative period, if needed.\nRemove hair on the right knee joint and proximal tibia of the hindlimb with depilating solution to minimize the potential trauma to the skin.",
    "Scrub the prepared area with surgical antiseptic. Scrub first with a 70% ethanol swab and then scrub with alternating chlorhexidine and saline scrub.\nVisualize the proximal tibia as the region just distal to the knee joint while flexing and extending the joint.\nCreate a 3-4 mm incision at the level of the proximal tibia on the medial aspect of the limb with a #15 scalpel blade (with or without a scalpel blade handle). Incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to expose the medial cortex of the proximal tibia.\nApply gentle pressure with the tip of a 25 G needle, while also rotating the tip, to create a small hole in the medial cortex of the proximal tibia. Make this hole approximately 2 mm distal to the knee joint at a point equidistant between the cranial and caudal tibial cortexes. Select the needle size depending on the size of the tumor fragments.\nUse sterile forceps to pick up and insert the tumor fragments into the medullary cavity of the proximal tibia. Use a 27 to 30 G needle to manipulate the tumor fragment into the medullary canal. Depending on the size of the tumor fragments, implant a minimum of 0.5 mm3 total tumor volume into each tibia. This may require implantation of 1 or more tumor fragments depending on the size of tumor fragments created.\n\tNOTE: Modifications to prevent or limit displacement of the graft outside of the bone would be placement of bone wax or bone cement in the bone defect or either gel foam or a subcutaneous fat graft over the hole in the bone.",
    "Appose the skin edges with sterile liquid tissue adhesive or a single skin suture. Do not use wound clips in this site. Take caution if using fluorescence imaging in the post-operative period, since both tissue adhesives and suture have the potential to fluoresce.\nRecover the mice on a heating pad in individual cages until ambulatory.\n5. Serial and end point assessment\nAnesthetize mice using isoflurane in oxygen anesthesia as described previously.\nEvaluate tibial tumor growth non-invasively by either weekly digital radiography, bioluminescence, or fluorescence imaging (if using cells expressing luciferase or a fluorescent reporter gene). Caliper measurements of the limb at the site of implantation can also be performed in awake mice.\nIn addition to the traditional monitoring of tumor-bearing mice (body weight, activity level, respiratory rate, grooming, posture, mentation, and behavior) monitor mice weekly for signs of hind limb lameness, swelling, and surgical site infection.\nMonitor the skin surgical wound for the first 10-14 days for excessive redness, swelling, draining, and wound dehiscence until the skin wound is healed. After 4-5 weeks, evaluate mice in accordance with the study outcome evaluation either alive or following euthanasia.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
