    "1 Prepare the reagents and supplies\nReagent preparation\n\t\nPrepare 500 mL of 3x Danieau's solution (Solution 1, Table 1).\nPrepare 1 L of egg water (Solution 2, Table 1).\nPrepare a 1.2% solution of agarose in egg water. Melt the agarose entirely in the microwave, and then cool to 55 °C in a water bath.\nPrepare 4 mL explant media (Solution 3, Table 1, modified slightly from19,21) per experimental condition.\n\t\tNOTE: Remember to account for at least one well of explants from uninjected (or control injected) embryos when calculating the required volume.\n\t\t\nSanitize the workspace with 70% ethanol.\nRemove cell culture media from 4 °C and spray/wipe with 70% ethanol.\nMake explant media and place in the 28.5 °C incubator to warm while the embryos are injected.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Always include age-matched, intact sibling embryos for staging purposes. Dechorionate these embryos and culture them on agarose-coated plates in 0.3x Danieau's solution (Solution 4, Table 1).\nRemove pronase aliquots (1 mL at 20 mg/mL) from -20 °C and allow to thaw on ice. Thaw one 1 mL aliquot for every three experimental conditions.\nPrepare agarose plates\n\t\nMake the injection plates.\n\t\t\nFill a 100 mm x 15 mm plastic Petri dish half-way with molten agarose in egg water.\nGently place the injection mold on top of the molten agarose at a 45° angle and lower it gradually into the agarose, ensuring that no bubbles are trapped underneath. Let it cool completely.\nRemove the mold. Use the plate immediately or save for later by adding 2 mL of egg water, wrapping the plate, and storing it at 4 °C. Warm the plate for 15-30 min in the 28.5 °C incubator before injection.\nMake explant cutting plates.",
    "Add 3 mL of molten 1.2% agarose in egg water to a 60 mm x 15 mm Petri dish, ensuring that the entire bottom of the well is coated. Let it cool completely.\nCoat culture plates with agarose.\n\t\t\nFor each experimental condition, dispense 1 mL of molten 1.2% agarose in egg water into one well of a 6-well plate, ensuring that the entire bottom of the well is coated. Let it cool completely.\nFor making chimeric explants, create an explant cutting dish with small wells by adding twelve 1 mm glass beads to molten agarose in a 60 mm x 15 mm Petri dish. Remove the beads with forceps once the agarose cools completely.\n2 Inject embryos with RNA\nWearing gloves, remove an aliquot of synthetic ndr2 mRNA from storage at -80 °C and immediately place it on ice.\nPrepare the injection needle.\n\t\nFill a pulled glass capillary needle with RNA. Place the filled needle into a micro-manipulator and break the tip of the needle with forceps.\nCalibrate injection volume using a stage micrometer with a drop of mineral oil, adjusting injection time and pressure on the pneumatic injector to achieve a bolus of the desired size. A bolus with a diameter of 120 µm has a volume of 1 nL.\n\t\tNOTE: The desired volume of the bolus will depend on the concentration of the RNA and the desired dose per embryo. For example, if RNA is aliquoted at 10 ng/µL, inject 1 nL to achieve a final amount of 10 pg.\n\t\t\nKeep the RNA needle tip submerged in the oil until ready to inject.\nLoad the embryos and inject.\n\t\nPull the dividers in breeding tanks, allow fish to spawn for 10-15 min, and collect the embryos using a tea strainer.",
    "Load the embryos into the injection plate using a Pasteur pipette and pipette pump, and then use a gloved finger to press the eggs into the troughs gently.\nInject 10 pg ndr2 RNA into the yolk of single-cell embryos until the desired number of embryos is reached or until embryos begin to divide.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not inject after the single-cell stage to ensure even distribution of the RNA throughout the embryo.\nWash the embryos out of the injection plate into a labeled 100 mm x 15 mm Petri dish with a gentle stream of egg water from a squeeze bottle.\n\t\tNOTE: Always keep a group of age-matched, uninjected siblings as controls.\nPlace the embryos into the 28.5 °C incubator until they reach the 128-cell stage. Remove unfertilized eggs and dead embryos from the dish.\n3 Dechorionate the embryos\nOnce the embryos have reached the 128-cell stage, place them into labeled glass Petri dishes and decant as much egg water as possible from them.\nLabel glass crystalizing dishes with lab tape (corresponding to small dish names) and fill 2/3 of the way with egg water. Place these dishes next to the dissecting microscope for quick accessibility.\nAdd 1 mL of pronase stock (20 mg/mL, thawed on ice) to 15 mL of 3x Danieau's solution in a 50 mL conical tube.\n\tNOTE: This amount is sufficient for up to three experimental conditions. Increase the volume of pronase and 3x Danieau's solution for additional explant conditions.\n\tCAUTION: Pronase is an irritant; hence wear gloves when handling.\nAdd at least 5 mL of pronase solution to each glass Petri dish containing embryos.\nAgitate the glass dishes in a circular motion, monitoring the progress of dechorionation consistently under a dissecting microscope.",
    "Once the chorions begin to wrinkle and 1-2 embryos are out of their chorions, carefully dunk the glass Petri dish containing pronase and the embryos into the corresponding glass crystallizing dish containing egg water.\nWash the dechorionated embryos.\n\t\nWash the embryos three times with egg water by gently adding and then decanting egg water from the dish.\nThe third and final wash is with 0.3x Danieau's solution.\n\t\t​NOTE: If the embryos still have chorions after washing, gently pipette the embryos until the chorions are removed or let them sit in the wash (egg water or 0.3x Danieau's solution) for a minute or two and gently agitate with circular motions.\nCover dechorionated embryos with a Petri dish lid and return them to the incubator (28.5 °C) until they reach the 256-cell stage.\n4 Cut explants\nFill the agarose-coated 60 mm x 15 mm Petri dish with 3x Danieau's solution.\nOnce the embryos are at the 256-cell stage, transfer them into the agarose-coated plate containing 3x Danieau's solution, lining them up along the center of the dish.\nCut the explants using forceps (Figure 1).\n\t\nUse one pair of forceps, held closed, to stabilize the embryo and use the other to cut through the blastoderm at approximately half of its height (from margin to animal pole) (Figure 1A).\nTo cut, gently squeeze the blastoderm cells with one pair of forceps. Then, take the stabilizing forceps and run them along the other forceps to slice approximately halfway across the blastoderm (Figure 1B).\nRotate the embryo, placing the forceps into the existing cut, and then sever the remaining blastoderm orthogonal to the first cut (Figure 1C).",
    "Keep explants in 3x Danieau's solution for at least 5 min to heal, then transfer them to the well of a 6-well plate coated with agarose and filled with 4 mL of explant media.\n\tNOTE: Cut explants from uninjected (or control injected) siblings as negative controls. If explants are performed correctly, these explants will neither extend nor express markers of endoderm, mesoderm, or neuroectoderm.\nPlace the explant culture plates into the 28.5 °C incubator until the desired timepoint/stage (determined from intact siblings) is reached.\n\t​NOTE: If treating explants with a compound, such as a small molecule inhibitor, the desired concentration can be added directly to the explant media within the wells at desired time points. Remember to include the volume of agarose when calculating concentrations. (Example: 1 mL agarose + 4 mL explant media = 5 mL total volume per well).\n5 Prepare chimeric explants\nIn place of a regular agarose coated plate, cut chimeric explants in a dish with agarose molded into twelve small, shallow wells using 1 mm glass beads (section 1.2.4). Fill this plate with 3x Danieau's solution.\n\t​NOTE: Chimeric explants are generated from blastoderm cells of two embryos of different genotypes or conditions. Ensure that these conditions can be distinguished from one another by the expression of transgenic or injected fluorescent markers.\n\t\nPrepare by adding twelve embryos of one genotype/condition to the left side of the plate and twelve embryos of the other genotype/condition to the right side of the plate.\nMove one embryo of each condition into the center of the plate, near one of the 12 wells.\nUsing forceps, cut an explant from each embryo as described for single embryo explants (step 4.3).",
    "Quickly press the cut edges of the two explants together within the shallow well using forceps to allow the two halves to heal together into a single explant.\nContinue with the remaining eleven wells within the plate. Once explants are healed, transfer them to the well of a 6-well plate coated with agarose and filled with 4 mL of explant media. Repeat until the desired number of explants is achieved.\n6 Culture and/or image the fixed explants\nCulture explants in the 28.5 °C incubator until intact sibling embryos reach the desired stage.\nLive explants can be mounted for continuous time-lapse imaging, imaged periodically throughout the culture period, or imaged live at the experimental endpoint.\nFix the explants if desired. Once the explants reach the desired endpoint, note the stage of intact embryo siblings and place the explants into a glass scintillation vial with 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fix overnight on a shaker at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is toxic. Wear gloves when handling this chemical and dispose of it via methods approved by each institution.\n\t\nAfter fixation, rinse explants six times, 15 min each with PBS + 0.1% Tween-20, and dehydrate gradually into methanol. Store explants at -20 °C for later analysis by the whole-mount in situ hybridization, immunofluorescent staining, etc."
