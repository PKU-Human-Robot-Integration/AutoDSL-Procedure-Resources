This entails filling the inserts with fluorescent THP-1 in full EGM-2 MV medium, filling reservoir wells with full EGM-2 MV containing the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1)/monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) (hereafter referred to as MCP1) and launching the scan acquisition program.\nPreparation of mKate2-N THP-1 cells.\nNote: Seed mKate2-N THP-1 cells in the IncuCyte® ClearView 96-well chemotaxis cell migration plates at 5000 cells/well in 60 μL of HUVEC culture medium (full EGM-2 MV), i.e. at a concentration of 8.33 × 105 cells/mL.\nCritical: Prepare twice the required number of fluorescent mKate2-N THP-1 cells to anticipate losses due to trapping of cells by the plastic wall of the tubes during preparation and centrifugation.\nDetermine the concentration of mKate2-N THP-1 cells in the culture by a dye exclusion procedure for viable cell counting.\nCentrifuge twice the required number of cells at 120 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C, then remove supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in half the theoretical volume of full EGM-2 MV pre-warmed to 37°C to obtain a final concentration of 8.33 × 105 cells/mL.\nDetermine the total number of mKate2-N THP-1 cells by a dye exclusion procedure for viable cell counting.\nAdd full EGM-2 MV pre-warmed to 37°C to reach a final concentration of 8.33 × 105 cells/mL.\nStore at 37°C until seeding in insert plates.\nSeeding mKate2-N THP-1 cells in IncuCyte® ClearView 96-well chemotaxis cell migration plates.\nRinse HUVEC monolayers with 60 μL of EGM-2 MV pre-warmed to 37°C and empty the wells.",
    "Add 60 μL (5000 cells) of mKate2-N THP-1 cells per well.\nCentrifuge plates at 50 × g for 3 min at 20°C–25°C to rapidly bring monocytes to the surface of the endothelial cell monolayer.\nAlternatives: This step requires a plate centrifuge. If centrifugation is not possible, allow mKate2-N THP-1 cells to settle on the endothelial monolayer at 20°C–25°C for 45–60 min. In this case, and for each type of cell, it will be necessary to determine the minimum time to allow for sedimentation to standardize the start time of the experiment.\nFill the wells of a new reservoir plate with 200 μL of full EGM-2 MV pre-warmed to 37°C and containing 100 nM of the chemoattractant MCP1.\nTransfer the insert plate containing the cells into the new pre-filled reservoir plate containing full EGM-2 MV ± MCP1.\nCritical: When removing culture medium from insert plates, we recommend leaving a small volume of medium in the insert well to avoid touching and damaging the HUVEC monolayers.\nCritical: Change the medium two columns by two columns so that the cells are not in contact with air for too long, which could result in damage or death. Use the same procedure to fill the wells with mKate2-N THP-1 cells.\nLaunching real-time acquisitions with the IncuCyte® S3 live-cell analysis system and analysis of the scans.\nPlace the IncuCyte® ClearView 96-well chemotaxis cell migration plates on the vessel tray placed in the IncuCyte® live-cell analysis instrument (which itself is placed in a Heracell 240i cell incubator) and allow the plate to warm to 37°C for about 10 min.\nIf necessary, wipe away any condensation remaining on the outside of the cover plate.\nIn the chemotaxis module of the IncuCyte® software, schedule 24-h scans every 30 min for one plate for a total time of 3 days.",
    "Note: The scan time for one plate is approximately 26 min. Adapt the frequency of the scans to the number of plates, i.e. every hour for 2 plates or every two hours for 4 plates. In our experiments, scans of the top and bottom sides of the permeable membrane are recorded in transmitted light and red fluorescence (800 ms exposure) using a ×10 objective lens.\nNote: The chemotaxis module scans each well in its entirety in a single image. There is no other possibility.\nNote: The choice of exposure time depends on the fluorescence intensity of the cells and should be adjusted beforehand. However, once adjusted for a cell line, use this value for each new experiment.\nCritical: Long scans cause a significant increase in temperature inside the IncuCyte® S3 device. The Status window provides options for viewing the temperature. To maintain a constant temperature of 37°C within the IncuCyte® S3 instrument, lower the temperature of the cell incubator. Trials are necessary to find the right temperature. We usually lower the temperature of the cell incubator to 35.8°C for scanning 2 plates every hour.\nImage analysis and assessment of transendothelial migration rates\nTiming: 1–2 h (for steps 4 to 6)\nThis section accomplishes the analysis of the transendothelial migration data acquired with the IncuCyte® S3 instrument.\nWe describe here the steps for analyzing transendothelial migration data acquired over time with the IncuCyte® S3 instrument.",
    "Note: The IncuCyte® device performs phase and fluorescence scans focused on the top surface of membranes (on which endothelial cells and THP-1 fluorescent monocytes are located) and fluorescence scans focused on the bottom of the membrane (on which monocytes that have passed through the endothelial cell monolayer and the membrane pores under the influence of the chemotactic gradient remain attached to the membrane, at least temporarily, and can be visualized).\nIn our experiment, detection of fluorescent objects is achieved by setting the appropriate segmentation parameters from the scans of the bottom of the membranes. Fluorescent THP-1 cells on top membranes are not studied. Quantification of top fluorescent THP-1 is indeed too inaccurate due to the density of THP-1 in the upper compartment (5000 cells per 6.68 mm2), which alters segmentation, and due to cell multiplication over time, which continuously changes the number of cells. Furthermore, the number of fluorescent objects detected over time on the bottom of the membrane is quite small compared to the number of cells seeded (about 10%), making it easier and more accurate to track the appearance of cells that have migrated through the endothelial cell monolayer rather than those that persist.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2781-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The segmentation parameters allow rigorous selection of fluorescent THP-1 cells that have crossed the endothelial cell layer and the membrane\nThe figure shows red fluorescence scans of the same field of the top and bottom of the permeable membrane of the chemotaxis cell migration plate and the segmentation results for the fluorescent objects after analysis by the IncuCyte® software (24 h after initiation of transendothelial migration in the presence of 100 nM MCP1 in the wells of the reservoir plates).",
    "(A) Control panel for viewing scans and segmented objects. The panel allows choosing the time point, the scan (phase or red, top or bottom), and the masks (top red, bottom red, pore) to be viewed in the window on the right of the panel.\n(B and C) Red fluorescence channel images of the top and the bottom of the membrane without (B) and with (C) segmentation masks. In the bottom channel image, THP-1 on top of the membrane, and therefore not having crossed the HUVEC layer, appear large and blurred, while monocytes that have crossed, adhering to the membrane, are well focused and detected by the IncuCyte® S3 segmentation module (circled in yellow). Similarly, in the top channel image, THP-1 cells on top of the membrane are efficiently segmented by the software (circled in purple). Examples of THP-1 located on the top and the bottom membrane are shown on the red fluorescence scan. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nNote: The chosen parameters allow segmenting the fluorescent objects that have undergone transendothelial migration, even if those that remained on the top of the membrane are visible because of the transparency of the membrane and of the endothelial cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The focus is placed on these objects which appear smaller and sharper than those on the top of the membrane, as the latter are blurred and broader in appearance, making it possible to assign segmentation parameters for their exclusive detection (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).",
    "Critical: It is important to correctly define the parameters for segmenting the fluorescent objects which are applied to each scan. Within our laboratory, the transendothelial migration experiments are very reproducible, and the parameters have almost never been changed, allowing the saved analysis parameters to be reused to perform the analysis automatically as the experiment progresses and to save time. We describe the segmentation parameters we commonly use in this section, in part 4b. However, it is necessary to visually verify that the fluorescent objects are correctly detected from one experiment to another with these analysis parameters. Otherwise, refine these parameters to launch a new analysis on the same data.\nNote: The “Quantification and statistical analysis” section describes the meaning of the segmentation parameters and how they can be set.\nScan analysis.\nNote: Once the scan parameters are set, they can be saved and reused, and the analysis can be performed automatically after each scan during the acquisition period. For this purpose, at the time of launch, load the parameters of the pre-saved analysis in the Analysis Setup window.\nUse the IncuCyte® software (Chemotaxis Migration Top/Bot analysis) to perform the scan analysis.\nUse the following analysis settings as a basis for determining segmentation parameters: for the phase, seed threshold of 50, grow threshold of 100, no clean-up, and no area and eccentricity filters; for the red fluorescence, segmentation with a seed threshold (RCU) of 10-5, a grow threshold of 50, an edge sensitivity of 0, no clean-up filter, area filter of minimum 20 mm2 and maximum 600 mm2, eccentricity filter of maximum 0.78, mean intensity filter of 0.1, and no integrated intensity filter.",
    "Critical: The segmentation parameters are to be established in each laboratory because they are probably dependent on the cells used and the laboratory in which the experiment is performed. We show here the parameters that we commonly use. A detailed method for determining the segmentation and filtering parameters is described below in the “Quantification and Statistical Analysis” section.\nData analysis and visualization.\nExport the data from the IncuCyte® software.\nIn analysis results, open the graph data.\nSelect [Bottom] metrics, wells, and scans to be considered for export.\nIn the selecting grouping menu, check “None” and click on “Export data.”\nNote: Exported the data to a text file and open it with a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.\nAnalyze the data in statistical software.\nOpen the export text file with a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel, and organize the data as required for the statistical analysis.\nImport the data into statistical analysis software such as GraphPad Prism.\nAnalyze and represent the data in visualization charts.\nVisualization of transendothelial migration of monocytes in video form.\nNote: The IncuCyte® software enables exporting images and movies from the same well. This can be done from unanalyzed and analyzed scans, which in the latter case allows displaying the masks of the objects and thus visualizing the segmented objects at each time point.\nAfter opening an experiment or an analyzed experiment, click on the Export Images and Movies icon.\nIn the Export Type window, choose “As Displayed.”\nIn the Wells Selection window, select one or more wells and choose the Image Channel(s) and the Channel Mask(s) to display.\nIn the Sequence Type and Scans window, select “Single Movie of Images as Displayed” and select the scans to include in the movie.",
