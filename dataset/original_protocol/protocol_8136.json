    "NOTE: This protocol is divided into five sections. In sections 1–3, the main protocol to culture C. elegans at a large-scale is presented. Sections 4 and 5 provide additional protocols for the assessment of exemplified metabolites occurring in diabetic metabolites. In detail, section 1 describes a general large-scale culture on plates. Section 2 focuses on the transfer of large amounts of C. elegans, whereas section 3 explains the harvesting of a large-scale sample. Section 4 explains the protein isolation from the sample and section 5 describes the sample preparation for subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses.\n1. Large-scale Culture on Plates\nIn general, work under a sterile hood or next to an open flame to avoid contaminations.\nTo culture worms until they reach the young adult stage, follow this previously published protocol7 with the following adaptations.\nUse living Escherichia coli OP50 bacteria to feed the nematodes and prepare 400 µM fluorodeoxyuridine agar (not ampicillin/FUdR) for experiments.\nFor the preparation of a synchronous population, use unconcentrated OP50, and for succeeding experiments with the adults, use 3.3x concentrated OP50 by removing 70% of the supernatant.\nDaily feeding intervals are recommended. When assessing oxidative stress, different intervals and volumes for feeding might interfere with the results.\nFor inoculation, take a plate with several nematodes and cut it into pieces of approximately 0.5 x 1 cm2 with a scalpel. Transfer two to three pieces onto nematode growth media (NGM) plates of 60 mm in diameter, containing unconcentrated OP50.\nIncubate the plates at the temperature suitable for the strain (wild-type N2 should be cultured at 20 °C) until eggs are visible on the plate.",
    "Wash off most of the eggs and adult animals with 2 mL of M9 buffer and collect them in a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge the suspension at 800 x g for 2 min. Meanwhile, start preparing the bleaching solution.\nTake out the centrifuged tube and remove the M9 buffer with a 10 mL pipet. Add 10 mL of the bleaching solution and mix on the vortex until the adult nematodes are lysed. This takes usually approx. 5–7 min, but should not take longer than 15 min or the eggs will not develop fully later on in the experiment.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 800 x g for 2 min. Wash 3 times with 10 mL M9 buffer to clear the eggs from bleaching solution.\nNow add 150 µL of the egg suspension on OP50 plates. A density of 200–300 eggs should be reached on each plate. Wait until nematodes reached the adult stage.\n\t\tNOTE: The M9 buffer (pH 7.0) used for the depicted experiments consists of the following substances: 22 mM KH2PO4, 42 mM Na2HPO4, and 86 mM NaCl. After autoclaving the mixture, add 1 mM MgSO4. The bleaching solution contains 0.5 M NaOH, 2.3 mM NaOCl solved in distilled water.\nPrepare sterile M9 buffer, sterile pipette tips with a cut tip to wash off the worms, and 15 mL tubes to collect them in.\nApply approximately 1 mL of M9 buffer on the plates, gently distribute the buffer by swinging and gently pipet the nematodes off the plate.\nNow, collect the nematodes in the tube. Apply 150 µL of suspension directly on the plates (seeded with OP50) with the cut pipette tips, and evaluate microscopically the density of the nematodes (recommended: 50–100 nematodes per 60 mm plate).",
    "If they are too dense, dilute the suspension with M9 buffer and evaluate it under the microscope until the desired density is reached. If the yield is too little, let the worms settle down or centrifuge the suspension 10 s at 800 x g to remove fluid.\n\t\tNOTE: An example of a sufficient density is given in Figure 1A (macroscopic) and 1B (microscopic) at 20X augmentation. Proceed empirically as described.\nKeep in mind that the worms settle down quickly. To ensure an equal distribution between the plates, invert the tube after every stack of plates (4–5 plates).\n\t\tNOTE: The cut pipette tip, as well as the gentle swinging and washing of the plates, reduces shear stress.\n2. Transfer of Large Amounts of Caenorhabditis elegans\nWash off the nematodes with approximately 500 µL of M9 buffer, depending on the age and dryness of the plates. Using the same buffer, repeat detaching the nematodes until most of the animals are collected in suspension.\nSlowly take up the nematodes with a cut pipette tip and transfer them on a plate prepared with OP50. Let the plate dry.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to apply much more than the recommended volume. Especially in long-term experiments, the plates might not tolerate it and the agar can break, allowing the nematodes to crawl into the cracks.\n3. Harvest of a Large Caenorhabditis elegans Sample\nDepending on the selected method, start experiments with a sufficient amount of C. elegans. For LC-MS/MS analyses, prepare 20 plates (60 mm x 15 mm) per group with approximately 100 nematodes per plate to ensure a yield of at least 200 µg of protein per sample.\n\tNOTE: This part of the protocol does not require working under sterile conditions anymore, as the nematodes will be collected and frozen.",
    "On the day of the sample collection, prepare liquid nitrogen to snap-freeze the collected samples. Keep non-sterile M9 buffer on ice to slow down the nematode’s metabolism.\nWash off the C. elegans from the plates by applying 1 mL of M9 buffer and gently swirling the plates. This avoids collecting deceased nematodes and most eggs, if there are any present, because they stick to the bacteria and agar.\nTake up the volume and transfer it to a 15 mL tube.\nAfter the collection of the complete sample, wait for the nematodes to settle or centrifuge the tube briefly at 800 x g and remove most of the M9 buffer. Wash the sample 3x with approximately 10 mL of M9 (10x the sample volume) to remove any bacteria.\n\tNOTE: To ensure that all deceased nematodes are removed, sucrose floatation is another option. However, this was not suitable for the displayed experiments15. Sucrose is hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose. In the depicted experiments, the role of glucose was assessed to promote biochemical changes found in chronic diabetes. Thus, sucrose floatation could potentially confound the results.\nPrepare one 1.5 mL tube with 1 mL of M9 buffer and one empty 1.5 mL tube for every sample. Transfer the pellet with a glass pipet from the 15 mL tube to the empty 1.5 mL tube. This step is crucial to ensure a quantitative transfer.\n\tNOTE: Unlike during previous steps, here the nematodes are more concentrated. Because of a possible adherence to plastic pipet tips, loss of a large part of the sample is expected. Therefore, use glass pipettes instead.",
    "After the transfer, use the glass pipette to take up 1 mL of M9 buffer from the second 1.5 mL tube to rinse the nematodes from the pipette wall. Also, wash the remaining nematodes from the 15 mL tube and transfer them to the sample tube.\nCentrifuge the sample tube at 19,000 x g for 1 min and then remove as much supernatant as possible.\nSeal the tube with Parafilm and immediately snap-freeze it in liquid nitrogen. Store the tube at -80 °C until the lysate preparation.\n4. Protein Isolation for Mass Spectrometry\nNOTE: The protein isolation described here can also be used for other assays (e.g., western blot).\nTo the frozen sample, add the same volumes of 0.5 mm zirconium oxide beads and at least 2x the volume of lysate buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor cocktail.\n\tNOTE: The depicted nematodes-to-protein correlation analyses were performed using 100 µL of buffer. LC-MS/MS samples were lysed with 200 µL of buffer.\nStart the homogenizer for 1 min on speed 9. Ensure that the samples are completely lysed. Repeat this step if they are not fully lysed.\nCentrifuge the samples for 30 min at 4 °C at 19,000 x g. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube on ice and store it at -80 °C until further measurements are going to be taken.\n\tNOTE: The non-denaturing buffer used for the depicted experiments consists of the following substances: 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8), 137 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X, and 2 mM EDTA.\n\tNOTE: Having followed the steps of this protocol and having applied the suggested scale, the yield of a protein pellet from approximately 1,000 nematodes should be approximately 500 µg. For more comparisons, consult Figure 2 and the Representative Results.\n5. Sample Preparation for Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry Measurements",
    "NOTE: Depending on the parameter of interest, the sample preparation will differ. This protocol focuses on methylglyoxal and AGE determination.\nMeasure intracellular methylglyoxal by derivatization with 1,2-diaminobenzene (DB) as previously described9.\nHomogenize the samples with 20 µL of ice-cold 20% (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid in 0.9% (wt/vol) sodium chloride and 80 µL of water in a 1.5 mL tube.\nSpike the samples of 5 µL with the internal standard (13C3-MG; 400 nM), mix them by vortexing, and then centrifuge them at 21,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer 35 µL of the supernatant to the HPLC sample vial containing a 200 µL glass insert.\nAdd 5 µL of 3% sodium azide (wt/vol) to each sample followed by 10 µL of 0.5 mM DB in 200 mM HCl containing 0.5 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DETAPAC) in water.\nIncubate the samples for 4 h at room temperature, protected from light.\nAnalyze the samples by LC-MS/MS, as previously described9.\n\t\tNOTE: For the measurement of AGEs, isolate the proteins as described in section 4 of the protocol.\nMeasure the protein concentration of the (thawed) lysates using a Bradford assay10.\nPrepare aliquots of 30 µL for a standard curve spiked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) solved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) of the following concentration: 0; 0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4; 0.6; 0.8; and 1.0 mg/dL.\n\t\tNOTE: If the sample was prepared at the suggested size (see step 4.1 for the preparation of lysate with 200 µL of buffer), the estimated concentration should be in the range of approximately 2–7 mg/mL. In this case, dilute the samples 1:10 with PBS prior to the measurement.",
    "NOTE: For the first experiments using this method, it is recommended to measure the samples in different dilutions (1, 1:10, and 1:100). As there is no exact determination of the number of nematodes, the yield can differ between individual researchers.\nUse a transparent 96-well plate (polystyrene) and pipette 10 µL of each standard concentration and of the samples in the chosen dilutions in duplicates in the wells.\nDilute the protein assay dye reagent concentrate 1:5 with distilled water (aq. dest.) and add 200 µL of the dilution to every sample on the plate. Incubate the plate for 10 min at room temperature.\nMeasure the absorbance within 30 min at 595 nm with a plate reader. The samples can be interpolated from the calculated standard curve. More details of the method have been described extensively in the literature10.\nMeasure the intracellular AGEs as previously described11,12.\nWash the total protein extracts (approximately 200 µg) 3x with water by ultracentrifugation in 10 kDa centrifugal filter units.\nAdd 10 µL of 100 mM HCl, 10 µL of pepsin (2 mg/mL in 20 mM HCl), and 10 µL of thymol (2 mg/mL in 20 mM HCl) to the recovered protein (approximately 100 µL) and incubate the samples at 37 °C for 24 h.\nNeutralize and buffer the samples at pH 7.4 by adding 12.5 µL of 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 5 µL of 260 mM KOH.\nAdd 10 µL of Pronase E [2 mg/mL in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)] and 10 µL of a penicillin-streptomycin solution, and incubate the samples at 37 °C for 24 h.",
    "Add 10 µL of aminopeptidase [2 mg/mL in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)] and 10 µL of prolidase [2 mg/mL in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)], and incubate the samples at 37 °C for 48 h.\nAnalyze the resulting hydrolysate by LC-MS/MS, as previously described12.\nSubscription Required.
