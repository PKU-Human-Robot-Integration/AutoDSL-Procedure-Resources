Instead of this step, you can use ‘55 °C for 1-2 h’ (see Procedure C). Preparation of posterior eyeballs-Sclerochoroid/RPE/RetinaPrepare No. 5 forceps, spring scissors, wipers, a spatula, 60 mm dishes, 48-well plates, dissection microscope, PBS and transfer pipettes (Figure 1A).Remove optic nerve head and muscle tissues from the eyeballs on the PBS-moisten KIMTECH wipers under a dissection microscope, using micro-spring scissors and No. 5 forceps (Figure 1B; Video 1).Cut a circle at the ora serrata and remove the cornea and lens (Figures 1C, 1D; Video 2).Rinse Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina in PBS.",

Remove cornea and lensStaining protocolPermeabilize Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina tissues in blocking solution at RT shaking (85 rpm) for 1-2 h.Incubate Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina in blocking solution containing primary antibodies (e.g., RPE65, CD11b) at RT shaking (85 rpm) for 2 h to 6 days.Wash Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina three times in PBS at RT, shaking (85 rpm) for 10-15 min each.Incubate Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina in blocking solution containing fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies and other reagents such as Phallodin-488 and Hoechst 33342 at RT shaking (85 rpm) for 2 h to 6 days.Wash Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina three times in PBS at RT shaking (85 rpm) for 10-15 min each.Put the stained Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina on a glass slide with ganglion cell (GC) layer against the glass, cut into quadrants (Figure 1G) and mount with a coverslip.Notes: Use enough volume of staining solution (over 250 μl), and washing solution (over 500 μl PBS). The incubation time of staining agents can be optimized.",
    "6 days incubation is recommended for strong labeling intensity. At an antibody dilution of 1:1,000, fluorescence labeling intensities in Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina staining are not saturated before 6 days (data not shown). Long incubation and strong fluorescence labeling allow us to easily observe the RPE layer in Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina mounts using a fluorescent microscope before confocal scanning. In whole mount staining, the labeling intensity is stronger in the peripheral areas than center, due to different thickness and density (Figure 2) Use RT condition instead of 4 °C to save time (Figure 3). Do not apply Pressure-Related Efficient and Stable Transfer of Macromolecules into Organs (PRESTO) method (Lee and Sun, 2016). PRESTO (600 x g) has no benefit over RT shaking in this staining. We suspect that molecular penetration and diffusion will be different between brain and retina (Figure 4). If you want to scan the inner retina such as ganglion cell layer, mount the stained Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina on a glass slide with sclera layer against the glass. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3872/bioprotoc-11-01-3872-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Scale bar, 20 μm.ImagingScan horizontal view of any layer in Sclerochoroid/RPE/Retina whole mount: Single, z- and tiled-scan images can be captured under any objective lens of confocal microscope. 20x objective lens will be generally acceptable for this purpose.Notes: This protocol has merit to observe the subretinal microglia or macrophages (Figure 5), which are separated to retina and/or choroid/RPE whole mounts in the general protocol. See additional resources for a demonstration of subretinal microglia and extended processes (Kim et al., 2016). The protocol is recommended to be applied for the subretinal observation and to see the neighboring layers, but it could also address any retina layer, from sclera to GC layer (Figure 6). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3872/bioprotoc-11-01-3872-g005.jpgFigure 5.
