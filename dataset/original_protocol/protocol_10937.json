    "All methods described in what follows have been approved by the Office of the Human Research Protection Program (OHRPP) of the University of California, Los Angeles.\n1. Pre-experiment Steps\nDuring recruitment, prescreen participants to ensure that they have no medical concerns, no history of neurological or psychological disorders, and no other disqualifying conditions for undergoing TMS, such as using a pacemaker, having any metal implants other than dental fillings, suffering a serious medical illness, taking anti-depressant or anti-psychotic medications, having a personal or family history of seizure disorder, or pregnancy.\nWhen prescreening (e.g., via phone), also ask questions regarding the prospective participant's political orientation, US citizenship, religiosity, and ethnicity.\nExclude non-US citizens or individuals who identify as 'extremely liberal' from the study to ensure that the participants will have a negative response to criticisms of the US (e.g., from a Latino immigrant, as has similarly been done in prior studies of intergroup bias)12,54,55.\nExclude those who identify as either 'extremely religious' or as 'atheist/agnostic' to ensure that participants will introspectively consider their degree of religious belief rather than answer reflexively on the basis of hardened convictions or habitual responses.\nExclude individuals who self-identify as 'Hispanic/Latino' in advance of the study toensure that the participants view the immigrant characters in the group bias measure as out-group members.\nContinue recruitment until there are at least 20 participants who satisfy the screening criteria in each cell of the design.\nObtain written consent after thoroughly explaining the experiment, including what TMS is and how it works, upon arrival of the prospective participants at the laboratory.\n2. cTBS Procedure",
    "Seat the participant in a comfortable position and fit a grid-marked swim cap to his/her head. Use earplugs if needed to increase the comfort of the subject. Attach two differential parallel-bar EMG-recording electrodes, centered over the belly of the tibialis anterior muscle, after cleaning the skin over the muscle thoroughly. Attach a third, ground electrode to the skin over a bone somewhere else on the hand or arm.\nOn the swim cap, measure and mark the center location (Cz) on the subject's head.\nIf using neuronavigation (recommended), launch the neuronavigation software and follow the software's procedure for localizing the subject's head. Have the subject rest comfortably and begin recording the EMG electrode output to software that will filter and display the signal.\nPerform thresholding on the primary motor cortex. With a double-cone coil (110 mm), place the center of the coil over the motor cortex, held tangential to the scalp surface. Apply single-pulse TMS at 50% of the maximum stimulus output (MSO) and observe whether a motor-evoked potential (MEP) was present in the EMG signal following the stimulation.\nIf no MEP is seen following the stimulation, reposition the coil 1 cm away in any direction and try the stimulation again. Wait at least 6–10 s between stimulations in order for the neurons to completely recover. Continue moving the coil 1 cm at a time, marking on the cap the stimulation sites that result in an MEP of 50 mV or greater.\nIf no MEPs are seen after trying many locations, increase the stimulation intensity by 5% at a time, until MEPs are observed.\nMultiple nearby locations on the grid may elicit reliable MEPs. If this is the case, stimulate each of these locations at intensities decreasing by 1% at a time, until only one location remains that elicits reliable MEPs.",
    "To determine the active motor threshold (aMT), have the subject slightly contract the target muscle. Stimulate the located region for 10 repetitions, separated by ~7 s, at decreasing intensities, until a corresponding observable twitch in the hand muscle no longer occurs for 50% of the stimulations (5 out of 10). The threshold is the lowest intensity that elicits 5/10 twitches.\nNavigate the coil to the specified location on the cap corresponding to the brain region of interest. If the double-cone coil to be used has a directionality of current flow, and if the target region is lateralized, orient the coil laterally so that the current flow is directed toward the hemisphere to be stimulated (e.g., a rightward current flow for a right hemisphere target)56,57.\n\t\t\nIf using neuronavigation, locate the coordinates for the region of interest (pMFC) at Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates [8, 16, 52] and mark this point on the system. Use the guiding software to target the region with the coil.\nIf neuronavigation is unavailable due to logistical or financial constraints (as was the case in the example experiment), determine the location of the pMFC for each subject's head using the international 10–20 system58. Place the coil 3.75 cm anterior to the motor cortex.\nApply cTBS as follows: three pulses at 50 Hz repeated at 200 ms intervals for 40 s, totaling at 600 pulses.\nIf the participant is in the sham group, apply cTBS at only 10% of the maximal stimulation output.\n3. Survey Tasks\nSeat participants alone, in a private setting, at a desktop computer to perform the computer-mediated survey tasks.",
    "Remind participants that their responses will be anonymous, confidential, and inaccessible to the research assistant, particularly to the extent that the target judgments (e.g., group bias and religious belief) are likely to raise self-presentation concerns (e.g., to appear patriotic, or not to appear prejudiced) which might obscure the effect of the cTBS manipulation.\nPresent participants with filler tasks for 10 min before starting the main task, as the maximal effect of cTBS begins 5–10 min after the stimulation53, and in order to minimize demand effects.\nAdminister the Multiple Source Interference Task59 (MSIT) (or a comparable distracter), as this task is highly cognitively demanding and requires approximately 10 min.\nNext, present a set of ostensibly unrelated survey tasks, beginning with two further filler distracters: challenge the participants to estimate the number of colors present in images of jellybeans and seashells that have been converted to greyscale.\nInstantiate the threat context. If the ideological shifts of theoretical interest pertain to responses to death (as in this example study), ask participants to write two brief passages on the subject of their mortality60 by saying: (a) \"Please briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you\" and (b) \"Please jot down, as specifically as you can, what you think will happen to your body as you physically die and once you are physically dead.\"\nFollowing the threat-induction task, administer the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form (PANAS-X)61 to allow self-reporting of potential effects of the cTBS intervention on emotional responses to the threat induction, as well as to distract the participants from the death prime encountered earlier in the protocol55.\nNext, administer the relevant ideological judgment tasks.",
    "NOTE: In the example given here, group bias and religious conviction were assessed. If more than two measures are employed, present them in a counterbalanced order.\n\t\nTo assess group bias with regard to ideological conflict, present participants with two essays ostensibly written by immigrants to the United States from Latin America (counterbalanced order) and ask participants to evaluate the authors and their arguments62. Note that there are intentional grammatical errors included in both essays which should not be corrected.\n\t\t\nPresent the \"Pro-U.S.\" essay:\n\t\t\tThe first thing that hit me when I came to this country, was the incredible freedom people had. Freedom to go to school, freedom to work any job you want. In this country people can go to school and train for the job they want. Here anyone who works hard can make their own success. In my country most people live in poverty with no chance of escape. In this country people have more opportunity for success than any other and success does not depend on the group belong to. While there are problems in any country, America truly is a great nation and I don't regret my decision to come here at all.\"\nPresent the\"Anti-U.S.\" essay:",
    "When I first came to this country I believed it was the \"land of opportunity\" but I soon realized this was only true for the rich. The system here is set up for the rich against the poor. All people care about here is money and trying to have more than other people. This no sympathy for people. It's all one group putting down others and nobody cares about the foreigners. The people only let foreigners have jobs like pick fruit or wash dishes because no American would do it. Americans are spoiled and lazy and want everything handed to them. America is a cold country that is unsensitive to needs and problems of foreigners. It thinks it's a great country but its not.\"\nAfter presenting each essay, ask participants to rate their agreement with six statements using an 8-point Likert scale (1= 'Strongly Disagree'; 8 = 'Strongly Agree'): (i) \"I like the person who wrote this\", (ii) \"I think this person is intelligent\", (iii) \"This is the kind of person I would like to work with\", (iv) \"I think this person is honest\", (v) \"I agree with this person's views\", and (vi) \"I think this person's opinions of America are true.\"\nAssess these responses for reliability and, if sufficiently reliable, average them. To explore potentially distinct effects of cTBS on personal affiliation (items I - iv) versus ideological agreement (items v and vi), average them to create submeasures (see Figure 1).\nMeasure religious conviction according to a modified version of the Supernatural Belief Scale63 (SBS) in which two distinct subscales tap positive and negative aspects of Western religious belief, mirroring the positive and negative valence of the two essays in the group bias measure.",
    "Present the SBS items in random order (positive scale: i - iii; negative scale: iv - vi), rated according to the same scale employed in the group bias measure: (i) \"There exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God\"; (ii) \"There exist good personal spiritual beings, whom we might call angels\"; (iii) \"Some people will go to heaven when they die\"; (iv) \"There exists an evil personal spiritual being, whom we might call the Devil\"; (v) \"There exist evil, personal spiritual beings, whom we might call demons\", and (vi) \"Some people will go to hell when they die.\"\nAssess the responses for each subscale for reliability and average them if sufficiently reliable."
