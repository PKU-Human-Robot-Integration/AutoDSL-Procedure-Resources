    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThawing an AML sample\nTiming: 45 min–1 h\nAML samples (bone marrow or peripheral blood) stored in liquid nitrogen can be thawed and immediately stained with antibodies for the marker panel or cell sorting. The used thawing procedure, as previously described (Schuringa and Schepers, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]; van Gosliga et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]), consists of the following steps:\nThaw two tubes of 6 mL newborn calf serum (NCS)\nCollect the AML sample from the liquid nitrogen storage and quickly thaw the sample in a water bath kept at 37°C\nTransfer the AML sample to an NCS tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 450 g\nIn the meantime, prepare NCS mix by adding 5 U/mL heparine, 4 μM MgSO4 and 20 U/mL DNAse I to the other NCS tube\nResuspend the AML cell pellet in the pre-warmed NCS mix\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 15 min\nSpin down cells and resuspend in PBS-mix (6 mL PBS + DNAse (5 U/mL) and MgSO4 (4 μM))\nCount the viable cells using Trypan Blue and continue with:\nRun the marker panel or\nSorting of potential subclones\nCritical: 30–50% of the AML cells will not survive the thawing process. To obtain a higher yield speed is essential in steps 2 and 3. Complete steps 2 and 3 within 15 minutes. If less than 50% viable cells are obtained, it can be considered to perform a Ficoll separation to remove deal cells.\nRun the marker panel\nTiming: 4 h",
    "Plasma Membrane Protein marker expression data is acquired by flow cytometry that can be used as input for the following analyses: 1) Leukemic cells can be identified based on aberrant expression of one or more markers compared to the healthy control. 2) Aberrantly expressed plasma membrane protein marker expression can be used to identify and sort potential subclones. 3) Disease progression can be tracked by running the panel on longitudinal samples from individual patients.\nCells are stained for markers CD34, CD38, CD45 and CD45RA, from now onwards called backbone stain. These markers are used as a basis to merge all measured plasma membrane protein markers together and are therefore present in every tube. More detailed explanation about this principle can be found in Merge the marker panel flow data. Addition of antibodies can be performed at 15°C–25°C. All stainings are carried out at 4°C in the dark.\nLabel unstained and single stained control tubes\nTake 15 million viable mononuclear cells (MNCs) of the thawed AML sample and resuspend this in 320 μL PBS\nAdd 2 μL of cell suspension to the unstained and single stained control tubes containing 98 μL PBS\nAdd the backbone stain to the remaining cells:\nFcR blocking reagent 10 μL\nCD34-APC 9 μL\nCD38-FITC 9 μL\nCD45-PECy7 3 μL\nCD45RA-BV421 3 μL\nStain cells for 20 min at 4°C in the dark\nLabel tubes for the marker panel (1-36)\nAdd PBS to the backbone-stained cells in a total volume of 100 μL ∗ number of markers\nAdd 100 μL of backbone-stained cells to each of the labeled tubes. Resuspend in between so that all tubes have a similar amount of cells\nAdd one PE-labeled plasma membrane protein marker antibody per tube. The volume of antibody per tube is indicated in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].",
    "Stain cells for 30 min at 4°C in the dark\nWash cells with 2 mL of PBS per tube and centrifuge at 450 g for 5 min\nRemove PBS and resuspend cells in 100 μL fresh PBS\nAcquire expression data using a flow cytometer\nNote: The extra volume of backbone-stained cells will be approximately 300 μl. Keep this at 4°C until all PE-labeled marker panel antibodies have been added. It can serve as back-up if a pipetting mistake is made with the marker panel.\nNote: The steps described above have been optimized for staining of cells in FACS tubes. For staining of cells in a 96-well plate some adjustments may be needed in the protocol.\nNote: While we have used a backbone panel with antibodies against CD34, CD38, CD45 and CD45RA, other markers, or additional markers such as CD64 or CD117, can be included as backbone markers as well.\nNote: The percentage of viable, thawed cells when measuring the marker panel usually lies between 70-90%. The largest cell loss during the thawing procedure is cleaned by the DNase in the NCS mix and does not result in the accidental staining of large number of dead cells. If desired, PI (at 1 μg/mL) can be added to the backbone panel in order to discriminate viable cells. In case of limited patient material, for instance at follow-up time points, a prioritized list consisting of 15 markers can be used, indicated by an asterisk behind the antibody in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. The ranking of these markers was based on the number of times it was positive in a cohort of 87 AML samples and on literature describing the use of specific markers in AML.",
    "Note: We acquire flow data at the MacsQuant Analyzer 10. Other flow cytometers may also be used if the lasers are sufficient for the used fluorophores.\nOptional: Experiment can be paused here. Data analysis and the thawing of a second AML sample for sorting can be done on a different day.\nMerge the marker panel flow data\nTiming: 30 min\nA limiting factor in flow cytometry is that the number of markers that can be measured per tube is limited due to availability of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies with distinct excitation and emission spectra and flow cytometers with multiple lasers. To circumvent this problem, we add a backbone of markers in each independent FACS tube. Additional to the backbone in each of the tubes an antibody against a specific plasma membrane marker is added, that can carry the same fluorochrome, in our case PE. Flow data acquired in separate tubes can be combined based on the expression of the backbone markers using Infinicyt™. With the recent development of full spectrum flow cytometers, such as the Cytek Aurora, more fluorochromes may be included to further increase the resolution and reduce analysis time.\nGate the FCS files in FlowJo\nExport the cells of interest as new FCS files. Here, we make use of CD45+ cells of which 10.000 events were exported per FCS file. See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for stepwise instructions\nUse Infinicyt™ to combine FlowJo™ exported FCS files into a merged file. See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] for stepwise instructions\nWithin the Infinicyt™ environment, select ‘Calculate data’ in the ‘Guided modules’ window\nLoad all FCS files necessary for your analysis. For instance, when disease progression is monitored load all FCS files per patient for every time point\nDeselect parameters that can be excluded, such as the time parameter HDR-T",

Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nNote: By making use of Infinicyt to separate the PE-labeled markers, the panel can be easily adapted. The number of markers can be increased, provided that a PE-labeled antibody is available.\nNote: Pay attention to the names of the markers and make sure these are consistent throughout analyses. This will avoid errors in the CombiFlow pipeline. Spaces are allowed but will be replaced by an underscore in the Combiflow analysis script.\nNote: Additional information on exporting FCS files can be found here: FCS file export from FlowJo. Additional explanations on the merging of FCS files and the APS plotting can be found in the Infinicyt documentation available on the Cytognos website.\nNote: Select which markers to include in the export if the merged file is used as input for CombiFlow, since here markers should match between included files.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "With the merged flow data from Merge the marker panel flow data marker expressions can be compared with marker expressions of a healthy donor. Aberrantly expressed markers can be selected and used for further analysis in the Infinicyt™ environment to identify potential subclones as depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. First, markers with aberrant expression are selected and used as input for the Principal Component analysis, which is used to identify the most discriminating marker (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and B). Subpopulations can be sorted based on this marker and sequenced (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Based on the sequencing outcomes, a pedigree can be created that depicts the expected evolutionary track of the leukemic cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1041-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Plasma membrane protein marker CD25 was identified as most distinguishing marker. A FACS sort was performed based on CD34 and CD25 expression resulting in two subclones: subclone 1 CD34+CD25+ and subclone 2 CD34+CD25-.\n(D) To identify whether the sorted subclones were genetically distinct targeted sequencing was performed for the mutations DNMT3A G>A, RUNX1 duplication CCTA and FLT3-ITD. It was found that both subclones have a DNMT3A and RUNX1 mutation, but only subclone 1 CD34+CD25+ also has a FLT3-ITD.\n(E) Pedigree of the subclones depicting the possible evolution pattern.

    "The CombiFlow pipeline can be used to study the hematopoietic landscape of healthy and leukemic samples at diagnosis and longitudinally. Potential relapse-inducing populations can be identified at MRD time points and changes in clonal composition can be monitored based on marker expression data as depicted in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. The CombiFlow pipeline is based on an analysis workflow for CyTOF data (Nowicka et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). Whereas in the described examples clusters are assigned to visualize differences between diagnosis, relapse and healthy (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), it may also be used to visualize different cell types such as blasts, lymphocytes and mature myeloid cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1041-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Create a cluster file. The number of clusters can be adjusted based on the expected number of populations. If this is not known before running the analysis, a fixed number of clusters can be used. Here, 40 clusters were created per analysis to avoid missing out on smaller, more rare cell populations\nClusters are formed using the FlowSOM algorithm (Van Gassen et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]) and can be visualized for all samples or per sample using tSNE landscapes. These can be colored by marker expression to identify and visualize specific cell populations such as CD34+ cells or CD4+ lymphocytes\nCreate a heatmap that depicts the transformed marker expression per cluster.

    "Optional: Clusters can be assigned to a sample but also cell type. In order to do so, create a file similar to the cluster and sample file but now assign each cluster to a cell type based on the expression data in the heatmap. For example, a cluster with small size, high CD45 and CD19 expression may be assigned to either lymphocytes or, more specifically, B cells.\nNote: Some clusters may have cells originating from both the leukemic and healthy sample. We opted to assign these cells to the healthy sample until the ratio Healthy/Leukemic cells fell below 1:8.\nNote: Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualization may be an alternative for the currently used tSNE plots. Implementation of UMAP into the CombiFlow pipeline is currently ongoing, as well as a more automated, machine-learning approach for the cluster assignments to reduce analysis time."
