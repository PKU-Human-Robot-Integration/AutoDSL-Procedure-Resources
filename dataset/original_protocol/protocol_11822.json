    "The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Utah State University. The steps outlined below should serve as a guide for programming and conducting a delay discounting task.\n1. Setting up a Delay Discounting Task\nChoose the range of delays for which discounting will be assessed.\n\tNOTE: For example, a typical scenario would use delays that range from 1 week to 25 years. The selected delays should follow, by convention, an approximately exponential progression (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 25 years)\nChoose the maximum amount of money that will be used in the task. For example, typical amounts of money used in the task are $100 or $1,000.\nChoose the number of trials that must be completed to determine an indifference point at each delay.\n\tNOTE: For example, a typical number of trials for each delay should be between 6 to 8 trials to balance data resolution and participant fatigue.\n2. Obtain Informed Consent and Login Participant\nHave the participant sit in an isolated room in front of a computer. Ask the participant to turn off their cell phone and/or any other electronic devices.\nProvide the participant with an informed consent form to review and sign if they agree to participate in the task.\nStart the program by clicking the icon associated with the task on the computer.\nObserve the dialogue box and enter a unique participant ID tag that will be attached to the participant's data.\n\tNOTE: Because the task must be programmed by experimenters, this step could be automated by having the program assign a participant tag automatically.\n3. Provide Instructions and Practice Trials\nGive the participant instructions about what he or she will experience in the task.",
    "Provide practice trials that will not be included in data analysis.\n\tNOTE: The practice trials are designed to familiarize participants with the task design and provide participants the opportunity to ask questions if they fail to understand what is expected of them without threatening the integrity of the data collected at the beginning of the task. Practice trials should not use the adjusting procedure outlined below. Instead, practice trials should simply consist of a series of choices between immediate outcomes and delayed outcomes.\n\t\nFor example, begin the practice trials by showing a question on the computer screen and asking the participant to choose between $10 available immediately and $100 available in 1 month. Observe the choice made on the screen.\nAsk the same question on the next screen but for subsequent choices increase the immediate alternative by an increment of $10 on each trial (regardless of the choices made by the participant) until the immediate and delayed alternatives are equal to $100.\nCarry out ten practice trials to allow the participant to acclimate to the task.\n4. Assess a Single Indifference Point\nNOTE: Indifference points serve as the major dependent variable from delay discounting tasks and represent a point at which the present value of the delayed alternative is equal to that of the immediate alternative.\nDisplay the starting amounts for the delayed and immediate alternatives to participants. For the first trial, display the maximum amount as the amount for the delayed alternative. Simultaneously display the immediate amount as ½ of the maximum amount. Set the mouse cursor to the center of the screen (equidistant from each of the choice alternatives) at the beginning of the trial.\n\tNOTE: The side (right or left side of the screen) on which an alternative is presented should be randomly determined on each trial.",
    "Observe the participant's choice.\nAdjust the amount of the immediate alternative by ¼ of the maximum for the second trial based on the participants choice.\n\t\nDecrease the amount of the immediate alternative for the second trial if the participant chose the immediate alternative on the first trial. For example, if the immediate amount was $50 and it was chosen on the first trial, then on the second trial display the immediate amount as $25.\nIncrease the amount of the immediate alternative for the second trial if the participant chose the delayed alternative on the first trial. For example, if the immediate amount was $50, but the delayed amount was chosen on the first trial, then on the second trial display the immediate amount as $75.\nDisplay the new amount of the immediate alternative and the constant delayed alternative to the participant and allow them to make their next choice.\nObserve the participant's choice and adjust the amount of the immediate alternative by ½ of the previous adjustment.\n\t\nDecrease the amount of the immediate alternative for the next trial if the participant chose the immediate alternative on the current trial. For example, if the immediate amount was $25 on the second trial and it was chosen, then on the third trial display the immediate amount as $12.50.\nIncrease the amount of the immediate alternative for the next trial if the participant chose the delayed alternative on the current trial. For example, if the immediate amount was $25 on the second trial and it was chosen, then on the third trial display the immediate amount as $37.50.\nRepeat steps 4.4 and 4.5 until the participant has made the required number of choices\n\tNOTE: The number of choices is up to the discretion of the experimenter; see discussion for further detail.",
    "NOTE: The adjustment for the upcoming trial should always be equal to the maximum amount multiplied by 2-n, where n is the trial number for the current adjustment (see Figure 1).\nMake the final adjustment to the immediate amount based on the participant's choice. Use this new amount as the indifference point for that delay.\n5. Determine Indifference Points at Each Delay\nFully repeat Step 4 for each of the chosen delays, resetting the amount of the immediate outcome and the amount of the adjustment for the first trial at each delay.\n6. Assess Delay Discounting of Qualitatively Different Outcomes (Optional)\nAsk the participant to provide an example of the chosen outcome. For example, if the chosen outcome is food then ask the participant \"What is your favorite food?\"\nObserve the participant's response and ask the participant how much a unit of the outcome costs (e.g., \"What is the cost of the preferred food?\").\n\tNOTE: If experimenters are interested in assessing differences in discounting across commodities, this step will equalize commodities in terms of value so that any differences in discounting are not due to differences in the amount being discounted.\nDisplay the values of the immediate and delayed starting values based on the price reported by the participant. Set the delayed amount of the outcome to be equal to the maximum value divided by the per unit price that was provided by the participant and then set the immediate alternative to ½ of that amount.",
    "NOTE: For example, if 1 serving of ice cream costs $5 and the maximum is $100 then there are 20 servings of ice cream in $100. Use this calculated value as the delayed alternative (e.g., \"20 servings of ice cream in 1 week\") and ½ of that amount as the immediate alternative (e.g., \"10 servings of ice cream now\").\nRepeat all of Steps 4 and 5 with the recalculated value of each outcome.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53584/53584fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Trial Structure of the Adjusting Amount Task. The starting value for the delayed alternative, Y, should equal the maximum. The starting value for the immediate alternative, X, should equal .5Y. If X is chosen then the value of X should be decreased on the next trial. If Y is chosen then the value of X should be increased on the next trial. The amount of the adjustment is .25Y on Trial 1 and is .5 of the previous adjustment on each subsequent trial.

Data Analysis\nImport data into any preferred data analysis program. Isolate the indifference point for each delay for each participant. Calculate the median indifference point for each delay for each group.\n\tNOTE: Calculation of median indifference points is only necessary if a group design is used.\nChoose a curvilinear regression model (see representative results for examples). Use curvilinear regression to fit the model to the (median) indifference points. This will generate relevant parameter estimates for the selected model (see below for an explanation of the parameters).\n\tNOTE: We have provided code to conduct curvilinear regression in Supplemental Materials for the statistical program R to aid the reader with Step 7.\nSubscription Required.
