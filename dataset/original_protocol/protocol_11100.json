    "1. Cell culture medium collection and concentration\nSeed the melanoma cells (here A375, SK-MEL-28, Hs 294T, WM9, WM1341D cell lines) into tissue-culture 75 cm2 flasks in complete medium [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose with reduced concentration (1.5 g/L) of NaHCO3, supplemented with 10% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) L-Glutamine, and 1% (v/v) Antibiotic-Antimycotic].\nCulture the cells under standard conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C).\nAfter the cells reach 80-90% confluence, aspirate and discard the supernatant and wash the flasks 3 times with serum-free medium or PBS warmed to 37 °C to remove residual medium in the culture flask.\n\tNOTE: The supernatant (complete medium) should be removed completely before adding the serum-free medium. FBS contains various MMPs, which may lead to false-positive results and wrong data analysis and interpretation29.\nAdd 10 mL of warm serum-free medium and incubate the cells at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 48-72 h.\n\tNOTE: The duration of cell incubation in the serum-free medium may affect cell viability, as well as the amount of secreted proteins. Therefore, the duration of cell starvation must be optimized before performing zymography depending on the type of cell line. The trick is to choose when cells are most viable and secrete the highest amount of MMPs. All melanoma cell lines used here were cultured in a serum-free medium for 48 h without affecting viability. The condition of the cells was verified using a phase-contrast microscope, although an XTT or MTT cell viability assay can be performed.\nCollect the media from the cell cultures after 48-72 h and transfer them to 15 mL tubes. Keep the media constantly on ice to avoid protein degradation.\nCentrifuge the media for 20 min at 7,000 × g at 4 °C33.",
    "NOTE: Centrifugation is crucial for removing floating intact cells, cell debris, and apoptotic bodies, as they may be sources of active MMPs. Skipping this step could lead to false-positive results and wrong data analysis and interpretation. Optionally, media can be filtered through 0.22-µm filters to remove apoptotic bodies, large microvesicles, and cell debris34. It is important to centrifuge the media before transferring to -20 °C for storage, as freezing and thawing of cells may lead to their damage, thus releasing intracellular components35.\nStore the media at -20 °C if required before further analyses (STOP POINT 1).\nThaw the media on ice and concentrate them to achieve the desired final concentrate volume using ultracentrifugal filter units with a 10-kDa cutoff (see the Table of Materials), according to the manufacturer's recommendation.\n\tNOTE: Here, the obtained concentration factor was approximately 20 times. As the molecular weight of the detected MMPs is 43-215 kDa, it is recommended to use ultracentrifugal filter units with 10 kDa Nominal Molecular Weight Limit (NMWL). Using higher NMWL (30 kDa) may result in losing the MMP molecules with lower molecular weight (e.g., 43 kDa collagenase MMP-1).\nTransfer the concentrated medium immediately to -80 °C and store at -80 °C (STOP POINT 2).\n\tNOTE: Fresh or thawed samples should be kept on ice during the next steps of the protocol to avoid protein degradation.\nMeasure the concentration of proteins in collected and concentrated media using, e.g., the Bradford or BCA method, according to the manufacturer's recommendation (STOP POINT 3).\n2. Preparation of SDS-PAGE separating and stacking gels with gelatin (1 mg/mL) for gelatin zymography\nPlace the spacer plate with a short plate into a casting frame to form a cassette and place the frame on the casting stand.",
    "NOTE: The spacer plate with 0.75-1.5 mm integrated spacers can be used (here 1 mm). Ensure that the working surface is stable and perfectly leveled.\nPrepare 2.65 mg/mL of gelatin by weighing the appropriate amount of gelatin and dissolving it in ultrapure or sterile deionized H2O by warming the solution to 65 °C. Sterilize the solution using a 0.22-µm syringe filter. Cool the gelatin solution down to room temperature before preparing the separating gel.\n\tNOTE: The gelatin solution can be stored for 1 week at 4 °C. Long-term storage may cause bacterial contamination and the presence of proteolytic enzymes secreted by them36.\nPrepare 10 mL of 10% separating polyacrylamide gel by mixing 3.95 mL of 2.65 mg/mL gelatin, 3.3 mL of 30% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide, 2.5 mL of 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 48 µL of 10% SDS, 80 µL of 50% glycerol, 70 µL of H2O, 48 µL of 10% APS, and 4.8 µL of TEMED.\n\tNOTE: CAUTION! Wear gloves and goggles when handling acrylamide/bis-acrylamide. APS (an activator) and TEMED (catalyst of gel polymerization) must be added at the end of gel preparation, after which it is important to work quickly and efficiently. CAUTION! TEMED must be added under a fume hood. This volume of the separating gel is sufficient to prepare two separating gels with a 1 mm spacer suited to the referenced electrophoresis apparatus (see the Table of Materials). If a lower percentage of the gel is required, recalculate the volumes of the components to obtain the desired percentage of acrylamide in the gel.\nMix the 10% separating gel solution by inversion six to eight times, avoiding air bubble formation, and pour the solution into the gel cassette sandwich (step 2.1) up to 75% of the height of the short plate.",
    "NOTE: The thickness of the gel, the amount of loaded protein, and incubation time in the incubation buffer (see step 5.1.3 for composition) should be optimized to obtain areas of the gel with the fully digested gelatin bands separated for individual MMPs. Ultimately, this depends on the amount of MMPs secreted by a given cell type.\nLayer the top of the gel with 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: It is essential to remove bubbles and prevent the gel from drying out and forming contact with air, which is unsuitable for polymerization.\nLeave the gel for approximately 30 min at room temperature. When the polymerization is complete and a clear separation line between the gel mix and ethanol layers is visible, remove the ethanol layer carefully.\nPrepare 4% stacking gel (5 mL) by mixing 3.05 mL of H2O, 0.67 mL of 30% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide, 1.25 mL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50 µL of 10% SDS, 50 µL of 10% APS, and 5 µL of TEMED. Mix the 4% stacking gel solution by inversion six to eight times.\n\tNOTE: This volume is sufficient to prepare two stacking gels with a 1 mm spacer.\nInsert a comb on the top of the gel sandwich cassette immediately and fill it with the stacking gel solution.\nIncubate the stacking gel for approximately 30 min at room temperature to allow it to polymerize completely.\nWrap the gels with moist paper towels, place them in a plastic bag, and keep the gels at 4°C for at least overnight but no longer than 1 week.\nLoad the gel sandwich cassette into an electrode assembly, transfer it to the tank, and fill it with 1x SDS-PAGE buffer [250 mM Tris-HCl, 1.92 M glycine, 1% (w/v) SDS] before running the SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.",
    "NOTE: SDS-PAGE buffer can be stored at 4 °C for extended periods.\nRemove the comb from the gel.\n3. Preparation of SDS-PAGE separating and stacking gels for total protein content determination\nNOTE: The steps in section 3 are similar to the steps in section 2 describing gel preparation for gelatin zymography. Note that the composition of the gels is different. A gel for total protein content determination must not contain gelatin, as it will also be stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution.\nPrepare 10 mL of 10% separating gel by mixing 3.34 mL of 30% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide, 2.5 mL of 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 100 µL of 10% SDS, 3.99 mL of H2O, 50 µL of 10% APS, and 20 µL of TEMED.\nMix the solution by inversion, avoiding air bubble formation, and transfer the solution to the gel cassette sandwich up to 75% of the height of the short plate.\nLayer the top of the gel with ethanol and leave the gel for approximately 30 min at room temperature. Remove the ethanol.\nPrepare 5 mL of 4% stacking gel by mixing 650 µL of 30% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide, 1.25 mL of 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 50 µL of 10% SDS, 2.99 mL of H2O, 25 µL of 10% APS, and 12.5 µL of TEMED.\nPlace a comb on the top of the gel sandwich cassette and fill it with stacking gel solution.\nLeave the gel for approximately 30 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The gel can be prepared just before SDS-PAGE electrophoresis or stored for a few days at 4 °C. For gel storage, wrap the gel in a wet paper towel and place it in a plastic bag to keep it moist.",
    "Put the cassettes with the gels in the tank, load the gel sandwich cassette into an electrode assembly, and transfer the assembly to a tank with 1x SDS-PAGE buffer [250 mM Tris-HCl, 1.92 M glycine, 1% (w/v) SDS] before running the SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.\nRemove the comb from the gel.\n4. Sample loading and electrophoresis running\nPrepare each SDS-PAGE sample for zymography by mixing a 1:1 ratio of 3-20 µg (here 10 µg) of concentrated medium with 2x nonreducing loading buffer [10 mM Tris pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) bromophenol blue] based on the estimated concentration of protein in the medium.\n\tNOTE: Loading buffer should be stored at 4°C. Using β-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol (DTT) is not recommended due to their ability to destroy disulfide bonds between cysteine residues, which results in the inability of the MMP to refold after electrophoresis.\nPrepare the gel for the determination of total protein content by mixing samples in a 1:3 ratio with 4x reducing buffer [40% (v/v) glycerol, 240 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 8% (w/v) SDS, 0.04% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol].\n\tNOTE: CAUTION! Wear gloves and goggles, and work under the fume hood. Loading buffer should be stored at -20 °C. The same amount of protein should be loaded into each lane. Samples can be optionally stored at -80 °C for a few days if required (STOP POINT 4).\nIncubate the samples for gelatin zymography for 20 min at 37 °C before running the electrophoresis.\n\tNOTE: Do not heat the samples at a temperature higher than 37 °C. Thermal denaturation of proteins may lead to the inactivation of protease activity or prevent the refolding of the enzymes causing false-negative results and wrong data interpretation31.\nIncubate the samples for total protein content determination for 10 min at 95 °C.",
    "Spin the samples for a few seconds in a small table centrifuge and load them into the wells of the gels.\nOptionally, load a molecular weight ladder and negative (samples that have been boiled for 10 min at 95 °C) and positive control samples (e.g., recombinant MMP-2 and MMP-9 or a cell line known to secrete MMP-2 and MMP-936) into the wells.\nRun electrophoresis, keeping it on ice until the dye flows out of the gel to provide good MMP-9 and MMP-2 band separation. Use the following SDS-PAGE electrophoresis conditions: initially, 20 mA per gel, increasing the power to 40 mA per gel when the samples enter the separating gel.\n\t​NOTE: The maximum electric current should not exceed 130 mA for four gels. Otherwise, the gel will get overheated during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis can be performed in a box containing ice or in a cold room (4 °C), if available.\n5. Activation, staining, and destaining of the polyacrylamide gel\nGel washing and activation\n\t\nRemove the zymography gel from between the short and spacer plates and transfer it to a plastic container with washing buffer [50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100]. Prepare washing buffer on the day of gelatin zymography.\n\t\tNOTE: As Triton X-100 is very viscous, pipet it according to the rules for pipetting viscous liquids to add the same volume of Triton X-100 each time the buffer is prepared37.\nIncubate the gel twice in the washing buffer, each time for 30 min with gentle agitation to remove SDS from the gel and replace it with Triton X-100.\nTransfer the gel to a plastic tank containing incubation buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2).",
    "NOTE: For long-term storage, keep the incubation buffer at 4 °C. Prepare fresh buffer if there are any signs of microbial contamination or precipitation.\nIncubate the gel in the incubation buffer for 12-20 h (here 16 h) at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The thickness of the gel and amount of loaded protein influence the incubation period in the incubation buffer, which should be optimized to obtain the areas of well-digested gelatin in the gel.\nGel staining and destaining\n\t\nPrepare the staining solution containing an aqueous solution of 0.5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 30% (v/v) of ethanol, and 10% (v/v) of acetic acid.\n\t\tNOTE: CAUTION! Work under the fume hood and wear gloves when using acetic acid. Dissolve the weighed amount of Coomassie Blue in water, add ethanol, and mix the solution. In the end, slowly add acetic acid to the ethanol-water solution to avoid an exothermic reaction.\nPrepare the destaining solution containing 30% (v/v) of ethanol and 10% (v/v) of the acetic solution in H2O.\n\t\tNOTE: Mix ethanol with H2O. Add acetic acid slowly to the ethanol-water solution at the end to avoid an exothermic reaction.\nTransfer the gel to a plastic container with Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution and stain the gel for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.\n\t\tNOTE: FastGene Q-Stain can also be used for staining the gel. The advantage of this dye is that it is ready to use and that the stained gel does not require any destaining step.\nIncubate the gel in the destaining buffer at room temperature with gentle agitation to destain. Continue the destaining until clear bands representing the gelatinase activity are visible.\n\t\tNOTE: If the staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution is very intense, change the destaining buffer a few times during incubation.",
    "Keep the gel moisturized and do not allow it to dry out until its visualization.\n\t\t​NOTE: Replace the destaining buffer with water to slow down the destaining process until visualization.\n6. Visualization of proteins in polyacrylamide gels\nNOTE: See the Table of Materials for details on the imaging system and software used to visualize proteins in polyacrylamide gels (Figure 2A-C). Other readily available gel visualization systems (such as iBright Imaging Systems, UVP PhotoDoc-It Imaging System, E-Gel Imager, and Azure Imagers) can also be used for this purpose.\nSwitch imaging equipment on and open the software.\nClick File | New project to open a new project.\nChoose the application type by clicking Select... | Protein gels | Coomassie blue.\nTransfer the gels, one by one, into the imaging system and check the gel position using the Position Gel button.\nVisualize the gel by clicking Run protocol.\nSave the image as .scn to allow further analysis using the referenced software.\nAdditionally, export file as .tif by clicking File | Export | Export for Analysis, which will be useful for analysis using ImageJ (STOP POINT 5).\n7. Data analysis\nGel analysis using the imaging software\n\t\nOpen the imaging software and images of the zymogram and the gel representing the total protein content.\nInvert the image to obtain black bands on a white background. Under Go to the Image transform setting, click on the Invert image display.\nSelect lines and bands on zymogram representing MMP-2 and MMP-9 manually or automatically using the Analysis Tool Box | Lane and Bands section. Create one band per line and adjust its size to include the whole line area for total protein content determination on the gel representing the total protein content.",
    "Adjust the lines and bands using the tools available in the Lane and Band section (Figure 2A'-C').\nGo to the Analysis Table and copy the Volume (intensity) and molecular weight of each lane and band (Figure 2A\"-C\").\nDivide the Volume of each lane per Volume of the selected control lane (here A375) to compare the total protein content between lanes (Figure 2A\").\nDivide the Volume of each band per the value of the corresponding lane (from step 7.6) to normalize the Volume of MMP activity to the total protein content (Figure 2B\",C\").\nTo compare the activity of gelatinases between lines, divide the normalized Volume of the studied line/studied condition per normalized Volume of the control line/standard condition (here A375) (Figure 2B\",C\").\nAlternative gel analysis using ImageJ software\n\t\nOpen the ImageJ software and open the inverted gel image (black bands on a white background).\nOutline the first lane with gelatin-digested bands using the rectangle tool.\nChoose Analyze | Gels | Select First Lane in the ImageJ toolbar to select and mark the first lane.\nTransfer the first outlined selection (yellow rectangle) into the next lane and click Analyze | Gels | Select Next Lane to select and mark the next lane.\nSelect all lanes presented on the gel in the same way (Figure 3A-C).\nGo to Select Analyze | Gels | Plot Lanes to make the lane profile plots (Figure 3A'-C').\nUsing the Straight tool, separate bands with vertical lines at the edges of each peak and then draw horizontal lines to \"close\" their area (Figure 3A'-C'; yellow lines).\nMeasure the size of each peak using the Tracking tool. Click in the area of each peak to select it and wait for the peaks to be outlined in yellow.",
    "Look for the size of each selected peak in the Results table (Figure 3A\"-C\").\nNormaize the data to the total protein content as described in step 7.1.\nDivide the \"area\" of the studied line/condition per \"area\" of the control line/standard condition (Figure 3A\"-C\").\nData presentation\n\t\nShow the results obtained with the imaging software as the MMP activity normalized to total protein content and control line (Figure 4A,B).\nPresent the results obtained with ImageJ as the MMP activity normalized to total protein content and control line (Figure 4C,D).\nSubscription Required.
