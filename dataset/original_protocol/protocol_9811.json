  "procedures": [
    "1. Gene circuit design\nSelect genetic components to combine into a single gene circuit/plasmid (e.g., mammalian DNA integration sequence motifs32, light-responsive elements33, or functional genes34).\nUsing any genetic engineering and/or molecular cloning software, store the DNA sequences for later use and reference, annotate each sequence, and examine all the necessary features (e.g., START codons, regulatory, or translated sequences)35.\nDevelop or adopt parts according to the overall gene circuit design36. As an example, for optogenetic repressors as in the LITers11, fuse a gene sequence coding for a domain capable of light-inducible degradation37,38 or inactivation of a repressor's DNA binding ability39, adjacent to and in the frame of the repressor gene (e.g., TetR)4.\n\t\nFor optogenetic activators, ensure the presence of an activator domain40 that promotes gene expression upon light-induced DNA binding41. For negative or positive autoregulation, ensure the presence of a regulatory binding site in or upstream of the regulator gene's promoter (e.g., tetO sites in or upstream of the TetR expressing promoter)42.\nDesign the primers for DNA sequence amplification or sequencing of the plasmid using the molecular cloning software for each gene circuit.\nValidate the primers computationally for plasmid construction through the built-in feastures of molecular cloning software (e.g., sequence alignment).\nOrder oligonucleotide primers from the manufacturer. Plasmids constructed and used in this work can be found in the original supporting material11 along with the primers designed and used.\nDilute the primers to 100 mM stock concentration in double-distilled water (ddH2O).\nDilute the stock of 100 mM stock primers to 10 mM concentration for PCR.",
    "Prepare the PCR mix with 1 µL of forward primer, 1 µL of reverse primer, 1 µL of template DNA to a total mass of 0.5-500 ng for genomic or 0.5 pg-5 ng for plasmid or viral DNA, 12.5 µL of DNA polymerase 2x master mix (or the volume that satisfies the manufacturer's dilution factor), and 9.5 µL of ddH2O for a total reaction volume of 25 µL.\nIncubate the PCR mix in a thermocycler at appropriate settings depending on the enzyme chosen43. Suggested reaction cycles include:\n\tStep 1: One cycle of 30 s initial denaturation step at 95 °C.\n\tStep 2: 40 cycles of 5 s of denaturation step at 98 °C.\n\tStep 3: One cycle of 30 s of annealing step at 65 °C (determined by primers designed earlier).\n\tStep 4: One cycle of 1 min of extension at 72 °C (~1 kilobase (kb) template fragment length).\n\tStep 5: One cycle of a 2 min extension at 72 °C.\n\tHold the reaction at 4 °C until it can be tested via gel electrophoresis. This protocol will vary depending on the reagents used (e.g., polymerase and buffers).\nRepeat step 1.9 to amplify all the fragments to be used in a DNA assembly reaction required for linking linear PCR products into a single circular DNA vector.\nRun the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel followed by purifying the bands of the desired length.\nPrepare the master mix for a DNA assembly reaction (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: In this example, the mother-vector is split into two fragments to increase the efficiency of the PCR steps without causing significant changes to the overall assembly outcome.",
    "Incubate the DNA assembly reaction master mix in a thermocycler at 50 °C for 1 h (unless otherwise specified in DNA assembly reagent protocol) and store the reaction at 4 °C to use the reaction product for bacterial transformation.\nSet up bacterial transformation (chemical or electroporation) using competent E. coli (Escherichia coli) cells and the corresponding bacterial transformation protocol. After transformation, use the bacterial Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing the chosen bacterial selection marker (e.g., Ampicillin) to plate the transformation mix. Incubate the plates at 37 °C overnight44.\nCheck the plates the following day. To inoculate the colonies, pick individual colonies from the plates and resuspend them in a liquid LB broth with the corresponding bacterial selection marker in culture tubes. Incubate in a shaker incubator at 37 °C, 300 rpm overnight.\nPerform plasmid preparation protocol to extract the plasmid DNA from the bacterial culture.\nValidate the circuit in two steps. First, perform a test digestion using restriction enzymes as a crude verification to see whether the approximate plasmid product was obtained. Second, if the test digestion is passed/confirmed, submit the plasmid to a Sanger sequencing facility (or process using the available equipment) to obtain the precise DNA sequence to compare it later to the expected sequence in the design software.",
    "To perform test digestion, select at least two restriction enzymes that produce at least two fragments, based on the molecular cloning software used. Once enzymes are selected, prepare the test samples by adding 1 µL of each enzyme, 5 µL of the generated DNA, and 13 µL of water with appropriate salts and buffers depending on the enzymes used. Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 1 h, or as the enzyme manufacturer suggests. Run the test digestion products on a 1% agarose gel and determine whether the bands are correct.\n\t\tNOTE: If the bands are correct, proceed to sequencing.\nTo perform sequencing, generate primers based on the DNA stored in the software so that the annealing regions of the primers are about 500 bp (base pairs) apart and cover the fragment of interest (gene circuit component) or the full plasmid. Dilute the primers with pure nuclease-free water (NF-H2O) to 10 mM concentration. Prepare the sequencing samples by adding 1 µL of 10 ng/µL DNA, 1 µL of primer, and 8 µL of NF-H2O to a 0.2 mL tube. Repeat this for each primer.\n\t\tNOTE: When samples are prepared, drop them off at the sequencing facility and compare the results with plasmid sequence using molecular cloning software.\nAt this step, generate approximately 100-1000 ng/µL of DNA sample for integrating the plasmids containing gene circuits into the appropriate cell line.\n2. Stable cell line engineering\nOrder a mammalian cell line designed for rapid generation of stable sub-lines that ensure high-level expression of the protein of interest from a mammalian expression vector. The cell type and the ease of cell line engineering can be variable depending on what the users prefer or aim to achieve.",
    "For example, if users prefer cell line engineering with minimal intermediate steps, order the cells that contain a single stable integration site (e.g., FRT) at a transcriptionally active genomic locus. If more nuanced cell engineering is preferred, create integration sites at preferred locations using genetic engineering tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.\nGrow cells in 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37 °C. Adjust growth conditions as needed for the cell type.\nTransfect the gene circuits designed above in the desired cells obtained from the previous steps to begin a stable cell-line generation process. To achieve this, use a liposome mixture45 of the gene circuit DNA with appropriate recombinase (for example, Flp-recombinase for Flp-FRT recombination) or through other methods such as electroporation.\nTwo days after transfection, split the cells to 25% confluency.\nSix hours after splitting the cells, begin antibiotic selection by exchanging the media to a fresh media containing 50 µg/mL of hygromycin antibiotic (or another antibiotic agent corresponding to the mammalian antibiotic resistance gene chosen during plasmid construction).\n\tNOTE: There are a variety of mammalian antibiotic resistance genes utilized in gene circuit construction, each of which has a different kill curve. Therefore, whichever mammalian antibiotic resistance gene is chosen for circuit construction, a proper kill curve should be studied in the cells of interest. This step ensures that cells containing the gene circuit payload are enriched while those without the system are killed off.\nAllow the cells to grow in the antibiotic selection media, change to fresh media every 2-3 days until the plate or flask has a few dozen foci. Passage adherent cultures when they are in the log phase before they reach confluence.",
    "Once there are sufficiently many foci, trypsinize the cells with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin, 0.1% EDTA in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) without Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium Bicarbonate for several minutes. Neutralize the trypsin with fresh media and pass all the cells into a fresh container.\nOnce the cells in the fresh container are 80%-100% confluent, freeze them down in a mix of 45% old media, 45% fresh media, and 10% DMSO. Transfer the remaining cells to a sterile tube and perform single-cell sorting to isolate monoclonal cells into a 96-well plate.\nApproximately 2-3 weeks post monoclonal sorting, wells within the 96-well plate should have foci. When approximately 50%-60% confluent, split the cells into a 12-well plate.\nOnce the 12-well plate is 80%-100% confluent, split into a tissue culture treated T-25 flask. Once the cells in the T-25 flask are 80%-100% confluent, freeze the cells and maintain a passage for characterization and testing of monoclonal cell lines.\n\t\nCharacterize the monoclonal cell lines by microscopy and flow cytometry assays to report gene expression profiles based on the induced fluorescent reporter production. Verify functional protein production via fluorescent antibody labeling and immunofluorescence assay. Test the transcriptional-level gene expression induction via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Validate the genetic sequence and integration accuracy via local and whole-genome sequencing of the clones.\n3. Light plate apparatus induction assays\nConstruct an LPA device31,46 to be used for light induction of engineered cells. Briefly, several broad steps are crucial for creating LPA to use for controlling gene expression. These include 3D printing LPA frame components, circuit board construction, programming the circuit via microcontroller programmer, assembling the components into a final LPA, programming the memory card via IRIS software, and calibrating the finished device. For a more thorough explanation, refer to the above references.",
    "Print the 3D parts as outlined in Gerhardt et al. (2016 and 2019)31,46.\nAssemble the circuit board as outlined in Gerhardt et al. (2016 and 2019)31,46.\nAdd the firmware to the assembled LPA circuit using microcontroller programmer as outlined in Gerhardt et al. (2016 and 2019)31,46.\nCombine 3D printed parts and the assembled circuit board as outlined in Gerhardt et al. (2016 and 2019)31,46. This includes taking the mounting plate, the circuit board, the LED (light-emitting diodes) spacer, the plate adaptor, a 24-well plate, a plate lid, mounting bolts, and wing nuts and stacking components as shown in the filmed video and Figure 2.\nFor memory card programming and calibration of the device, follow the steps described below.\nUse the IRIS software available on the Tabor Lab website47 to program an SD card for the Light Plate Apparatus (LPA)31 and explore appropriate light conditions needed to begin an optogenetic experiment.\n\tNOTE: The IRIS software is a web-based application for programming the optogenetic electronic hardware, known as the LPA, developed by the Tabor Lab. The software allows programming of relative IRIS values that control the individual light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in each well of the LPA hardware.\nChoose the LPA (4 x 6) drop-down option, followed by clicking the appropriate illumination approach (Steady-state, Dynamic, Advanced).\n\tNOTE: For this manuscript, all the assays will focus on the steady-state examples. However, the advanced setting examples can be used for pulse durations and duty cycle regimes.",
    "Choose whether the top or the bottom LEDs will be illuminated by entering values in the cells corresponding to the wells of the plate. For the LPAs used in this work, blue LEDs placed in the top position were used in all experiments. Each LED, once programmed, can provide continuous light exposure with a constant light intensity. The IRIS software allows for 4096 intensity levels which can be programmed.\nOnce the LED locations are chosen, enter intensity values for the desired experimental outline. For example, enter 8 different light intensities (or pulse durations or duty cycles) with three technical replicates per plate (Table 2). G.s. refers to grayscale units-the light intensity level measurement values used for LPA programming in the IRIS software.\n\t\nWhen designing IRIS experimental files, keep in mind edge effects from adjacent wells on the LPA device, light toxicity from increasing intensities of blue light exposure, and determining the type of dose-response desired (e.g., monotonic vs. non-monotonic).\nIf users program cells in the LPA in ascending/descending order of a particular light parameter (e.g., intensity), wells may produce edge effects of light crosstalk or even heat which can influence adjacent wells. This can inadvertently influence the outcome of measured outputs when experiments are complete. To alleviate this, users can implement a randomization matrix on the IRIS software to scramble well locations, minimizing edge effects. An example is described in the Representative Results below (Figure 4A-B).\nIn addition, higher intensities of blue light have been found to interfere with cellular growth and viability48. Therefore, to mitigate light toxicity, it is important to produce a light-intensity, pulse duration, or duty cycle response curve depending on the modality being investigated.",
    "For example, program 8 light intensity values with three replicates per 24-well plate, with a range from no light to a max intensity of the LPA. Then, run these samples on a flow cytometer with an SSC-FSC gate or a live stain such as propidium iodide to quantify the population cell survival (living cells compared to total events including dead cells/cellular debris) at each light value.\nThen, determine the ideal amount of population survival for the experimental setup, since any stimulus may adversely affect proliferation, gene expression, or survival (e.g., setting 80% cell survival as an appropriate tradeoff). For example, in this work, once calibrated, the intensity did not exceed 3000 g.s. units (~3/4 the maximum intensity of the LPA device). An example of this is described in the  Representative Results below.\nIn addition to restricting light values because of toxicity, users may wish to restrict light values to characterize a particular part of the dose-response, such as the range of the monotone response.\n\t\t\nTo achieve this, initially scan a wide range of light intensities, pulse durations or duty cycles depending on the modality being analyzed when determining the desired dose-response (Table 2) to narrow in on the light regime of interest, e.g., where gene expression correlates positively with increasing light values for a monotonic dose-response.",
    "To determine the light range of interest, program a single LPA with up to 24 wells of different intensity/pulse duration/duty cycle/etc. or more wells (e.g., 48, 72, 96, etc.) depending on whether multiple LPAs are calibrated to deliver equivalent light amounts and proceed with the cell culture work or assays outlined below. Therefore, start characterization of an optogenetic system with a wide dose range of light stimuli to determine the range interval that gives the desired gene expression and subsequently perform experiments in that refined dose range.\nFor example, in this work, once 3000 g.s. units was determined as the threshold for toxic light intensity; this threshold was used as the upper bound of light for assays outlined below (e.g., immunofluorescence).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The steps above are independent of the optical calibration of the LPA and refer to a molecular-level calibration for each optogenetic system.\nOnce the appropriate light intensity values are programmed in IRIS, insert a memory card with the USB 3.0 outlet into the LPA to download and transfer the files.\nIf calibration of the LPA is complete31, proceed to cell culture work for initiation of light-induction assay. If the calibration has not been done, calibrate the LPA using an Image analysis method (steps 3.7.1-3.7.3) once the LPA is programmed with the microcontroller programmer.\n\t\nBriefly program the LPA to have the same IRIS level as described by Gerhardt et al. (2016)31.\n\t\tNOTE: For calibration, the LPA was programmed to have a value of 2000 g.s.\nOnce the device is programmed with the memory card and the reset button (physical button on the LPA) is pressed, acquire an image of the entire device (e.g., gel station imager, scanner device, etc.). For the calibration, acquire two images with the device rotated by 180°.",
    "Then, use open-source software designed by Gerhardt et al. (2016)31 to show the variability in LED intensity on the LPA plate and calculate the LED compensation values to make the intensity equal across wells. An example of this is described in the represented results below (Figure 3). Once this calibration is complete, proceed to cell culture work for initiation of light-induction assay.\nObtain flasks of engineered monoclonal cells from the previous section to investigate light-induction effects on gene expression.\nRemove the old media from the flask.\nAdd 1 mL of trypsin to the cells and incubate for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, neutralize trypsin by adding 4 mL of Dulbecco-modified Eagle's medium (DMEM or other desired media) supplemented with the necessary chemicals (this work used 50 µg/mL of hygromycin, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution, 10% fetal bovine serum, FBS).\nAdd ~75,000 cells per well in a 24-well black plate in a total volume of 500 µL. The number of cells seeded can vary depending on the duration of the experiment desired and the cell type used.\n\tNOTE: Additionally, note that cell seeding density affects the culture maintenance and potentially the duration of the experiment. Starting at a lower number of cells per well ensures longer time durations before the culture reaches confluency. Furthermore, the type of optogenetic components integrated into the gene circuits of interest will influence when gene expression reaches a steady state and therefore affect the duration of the experiments. Other factors that may be considered are cell line-specific growth rates, media composition, and conditional growth effects (i.e., light).\nAfter plating, place the cells in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 to allow them to settle for 2-6 h.",
    "After the incubation, transfer the cells to a tissue culture hood, remove the plastic lid, and add an adhesive foil strip to the top of the plate (Figure 2D). This step allows minimal light transfer between wells, as the top and the sides of the wells are coated, and the light can now only enter from the bottom of the well where the LED is placed.\nPlace the plate in the fitted 3D parts of the LPA. Then, cover the plate with the 3D-printed LPA lid, which fits over the device screws on each corner.\nPlug the device into the power source and push the reset button on the LPA device to ensure that the updated LPA experiment settings are applied.\nIncubate the cells within the experimental system for an appropriate amount of time, depending on the original seeding density, cell line-specific growth speed, and growth conditions. In this example, the cell lines were induced for 3 days continuously for gene expression to reach a steady state. However, it should be noted that many optogenetic systems (e.g., VVD) may reach steady-state gene expression much sooner (e.g., 24 h), and therefore experimental induction times can be reduced or prolonged as needed.\nAt the end of the light induction experiment, utilize the samples for any of the following four assays to characterize the engineered cell lines (sections 4-7).\n4. Fluorescence microscopy of light-induced engineered cells\n24-72 h post-induction, remove the cells in the LPA from the incubator and place them in a tissue culture hood.\nRemove the foil strip and let the plate sit for 1-2 min. This prevents condensation from forming on the plastic lid, if placed immediately on the plate.\nAfter 1-2 min of sitting, put the original plastic lid back on the plate.",
    "Image the cells with the appropriate phase contrast or fluorescence microscope.\nDepending on the instrument, adjust the exposure time, light source intensity, and gain for displaying engineered cells. In this experiment, the following parameters were applied: 50 ms for FITC/GFP (green fluorescent protein) light source exposure time and 1-5 ms for phase-contrast exposure time at 100% intensity for each.\n\tNOTE: It should be noted that optimal exposure times, gain levels, and light source intensities are often derived empirically from the experience of this work to minimize oversaturation in the fluorescence reporter, minimize cellular damage, and capture adequate images for qualitative and quantitative analysis. When determining the levels of each of these parameters, the aspects to keep in mind include maximizing signal-to-noise ratios, minimizing phototoxicity, minimizing oversaturation of fluorescence signals, and increasing the ability to amplify weak fluorescence signals.\n\t\nOptimize these parameters grossly ad-hoc; however, previous experimental values (e.g., light source intensity causing oversaturation of fluorescence reporter) can guide future experimental settings when applicable. For example, the gain settings, exposure times, and light intensity initial values from one circuit (LITer1.0) or experimental setup (e.g., light intensity) can be used as a starting point when moving to a similar but different gene circuit (LITer2.0)11 or a different light modality (e.g., light duty cycle).\nStreamline plate imaging by a coordinate template programmed into the microscopy software allowing the entire plate size (e.g., 24 wells) to have automatized image acquisition from multiple image locations per well.\n5. Flow cytometry of light-induced engineered cells\n24-72 h post-induction, remove the cells from the LPA in the incubator or from the microscope after imaging and place them in the tissue culture hood.\nIf removed directly from the LPA, remove the foil strip, and let the plate to sit for a minute or two.",
    "Aspirate the media from each well (of the entire 24-well plate if all the wells are used).\nAdd 100 µL of 0.25% trypsin to each well, cover the plate with a plastic lid, and place it back in the incubator.\nLeave the cells undisturbed in the incubator for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, remove the plate and return it to the tissue culture hood.\nNeutralize each trypsinized well with 400 µL of DMEM.\nLabel a 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube with cell strainer (or appropriate flow cytometry tube that can be filtered to remove large clumps of cells not fully trypsinized) with a name corresponding to each well.\nUse a P1000 pipette to pipette the contents of each well up and down 6-8 times to break cell clumps and create single-celled samples for flow cytometry49.\nTransfer the entire contents of each well (~500 µL) to the labeled tubes with the strainer.\nBring cells to the appropriate flow cytometry instrument with lasers of the correct wavelengths (can bring tubes with cells on or off ice).\n\tNOTE: The flow cytometer used in this work was a part of a core facility located at the university hospital.\nCreate a forward- and side-scatter gate (FSC and SSC, respectively) to capture the single cells of the appropriate size and granularity to exclude debris and cellular clumps on the flow cytometry software.\nOnce the gate is set, capture approximately 10,000 cells with the appropriate gate. Adjust this number depending on the amount of cellular data the users are seeking. Repeat for each tube containing the cells from the experiment.\nOnce the experiment is complete, import the data to the available flow cytometry data software for analysis.",
    "Create an FSC-SSC gate (as before during acquisition) and apply it to each batch of experimental data. A reference well of the un-induced cell population is used for creating this gate in this manuscript, but other metrics for gate creation exist, such as density-based gates.\nWith the experimental conditions gated with an FSC-SSC gate, plot the flow cytometry data as histograms or represent in other ways to illustrate the obtained expression patterns. In this experiment, the fluorescence was captured by the GFP/FITC or PE/TexasRed channels.\n6. RNA extraction and quantitative PCR of gene circuit components\n24-72 h post-induction, remove the cells from the LPA in the incubator or from the microscope after imaging and place them in the tissue culture hood.\nIf removed directly from the LPA, remove the foil strip, and let the plate sit for a minute or two.\nAspirate the media from each well (of the entire 24-well plate if all the wells are used).\nProceed to extract RNA from the cells using the appropriate RNA extraction kit.\nOnce the RNA extraction is complete, perform a reverse transcription reaction of each sample (Table 3).\nFurther, perform quantitative PCR of each sample (Table 4). Utilize a DNA polymerase and associated protocol to set up PCR reactions. For this step, set up a multiplexed reaction with a housekeeping gene and a gene of interest, or create separate reactions. In this example, GFP, KRAS, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels were probed. After completing the qRT-PCR experiment, proceed with the analysis via available software to illustrate gene circuit fold change at the RNA level.\n7. Immunofluorescence of gene circuit components\nUse an ice bath or freezer to cool down methanol.",
    "24-72 h post-induction, remove the cells from the LPA in the incubator or from the microscope after imaging and place them in the tissue culture hood.\nIf removed directly from the LPA, remove the foil strip, and let the plate sit for 1-2 min.\nAspirate the media from each well (of the entire 24-well plate if all the wells are used).\nAdd 100 µL of 0.25% trypsin to each well, cover the plate with a plastic lid, and place it back in the incubator.\nLeave the cells undisturbed in the incubator for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, remove the plate and return it to the tissue culture hood.\nNeutralize each trypsinized well with 400 µL of DMEM.\nLabel mini-centrifuge tubes with names corresponding to each well.\nUse a P1000 pipette and pipette the contents of each well up and down 6-8 times to break the cell clumps.\nTransfer the entire contents of each well (~500 µL) to the labeled tubes.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 400 x g.\nWhen complete, discard the supernatant and move the samples to a chemical fume hood.\nResuspend the cells (use a P1000 pipette and pipette up and down 6-8 times in each tube to break cell clumps) in 750-1000 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS).\nAllow the cells to sit for 15 min at room temperature.\nAfter the incubation, add 750-1000 µL of PBS.
