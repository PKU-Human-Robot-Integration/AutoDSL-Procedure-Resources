Representative Results:",
    "Skin reconstructs with normal melanocytes and dermal stem cells\nThe skin reconstructs are cultured in a special 6-well tray with inserts. The dermal compartment is cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for the first four days (Fig. 1A). The skin reconstruct medium I is used when keratinocytes are seeded with melanocytes or melanoma cells (Fig. 1B). The epidermis is exposed to the air at day 9 and this allows keratinocytes to differentiate (Fig. 1C). At day 18, the epidermis of skin reconstructs is composed of stratified keratinocyte layers. The undifferentiated basal layer and sequentially differentiated layers are vertically oriented (Fig. 1D). Staining the section of reconstructs with the melanocytic marker S100 shows that melanocytes are aligned in the basal layer of the epidermis and communicate with multiple keratinocytes through dendrite extensions (Fig. 1E). The dermal compartment contains fibroblasts embedded in a collagen type I matrix. Deposited collagen IV indicates the basement membrane, which separates the epidermis from the dermis (Fig. 1F). When dermal stem cells (labeled with GFP lentiviral vector) are embedded with fibroblasts in a collagen I matrix, they migrate to the epidermis and differentiate into melanocytes (1), (Fig. 2). Multiple layers of keratinocytes in the epidermis are developed.\nSkin reconstructs of melanoma tumors",
    "Clinicopathological studies indicate that melanomas progress in a stepwise manner: common acquired nevi, dysplastic nevi, RGP (radial growth phase) melanomas, VGP (vertical growth phase) melanomas and metastatic melanomas (7). Different stages of melanoma cell lines are morphologically similar to each other in 2-D culture (Fig. 3A-D) but when they are incorporated in skin reconstructs, the behavior of the cells reflects their in vivo characteristics. The location and the growth rate of normal melanocytes are tightly controlled in skin reconstructs (Fig. 3E). RGP primary melanomas WM35 proliferate predominantly in the epidermis (Fig. 3F), whereas VGP melanomas WM793 grow invasively into the dermis (Fig. 3G). Metastatic melanomas 1205Lu aggressively invade deep into the dermis (Fig. 3H).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2937/2937fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Skin reconstructs with normal melanocytes.

    "Figure 2. Dermal stem cells in skin reconstructs migrate to the epidermis and differentiate into melanocytes. At day 5 after seeding keratinocytes, single GFP-positive cells (green) start migrating out from spheres. The epidermis is still composed of a single layer. At day 8, a few cells reach the epidermis-dermis interface. By day 10, GFP-positive cells are tightly aligned at the basement membrane position. The migrated GFP-positive cells in the epidermis express melanocytic marker HMB45 (red, as indicated by white arrows). Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). The epidermis is developed as multiple layers. The basement membrane is indicated with white dotted lines.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2937/2937fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

If the color is bright yellow, more sodium bicarbonate should be added drop by drop.\"\nCollagen prematurely precipitates in the mixuture,Keep all components on ice until the collagen mixture is placed onto the insert\nContracted collagen is not even (one side is thicker than the other side),Calibrate the shelf of incubator\nThe epidermis is formed with less than three keratinocyte layers.,Use undifferentiated keratinocytes at lower passages"
