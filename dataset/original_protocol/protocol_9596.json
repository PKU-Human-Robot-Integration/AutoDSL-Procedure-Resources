    "1. LiDEP microfluidic device fabrication\nNOTE: The fabrication process consists of combining three layered components: (i) a photoconductive layer with amorphous silicon (A:Si) and molybdenum deposited onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate; (ii) a microchannel layer cut out from double-sided tape; and (iii) a top ITO glass substrate with holes drilled for the inlet and outlet of the cell suspension.\nGlass coating of photoconductive indium tin oxide (ITO)\n\t\nClean the ITO-coated glass substrate (15-20 Ω resistance) by flowing nitrogen (N2) gas at the surface at a flow rate that is sufficient to move visible dust particles. After this step, rinse the substrate with acetone.\nTransfer the ITO-coated glass slide to an isopropyl alcohol bath to wash off the acetone residue, rinse with DI water, and flow N2 gas again until the substrate is completely dry.\nPlace the glass slide with the ITO-coated side up into the vacuum sputtering system.\nSputter a 10 nm thick layer of molybdenum onto the ITO-coated glass substrate (molybdenum target) with a deposition rate of 0.7 Å/s and a deposition time of 140 s.\nAdd a shadow mask to one side of the glass substrate to leave 2 mm from the edge of the glass substrate uncovered for electrical connections. Deposit 1 µm of A:Si using inductively coupled plasma-plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ICP-PECVD), as described in Medjdoub et al.25.\nClean the slide with N2 gas to remove dust and other impurities. For any A:Si deposited under the shadow mask, submerge the edge up to the 2 mm mark in a 25% w/v potassium hydroxide solution to etch the A:Si.\nLiDEP chip device fabrication",
    "To form the microchannel, obtain double-sided tape (52 mm x 25 mm), and punch holes (diameter = 4 mm) 5-6 mm away from the edge of the shorter dimension and centered between the longer sides of the tape. Use a scalpel to cut two straight lines (3 mm apart) across the holes. Ensure the protective sheets on both faces of the double-sided tape are on during the entire microchannel cutting step.\nDrill two 3 mm diameter holes in the top ITO glass slide. The tape can be aligned on top of the ITO-coated glass, with the long edge of the tape aligning with the long edge of the glass. Mark the hole location with a washable marker. Make sure the drilled holes align with the holes punched in the double-sided tape. These two holes will act as the inlet and outlet holes of the microfluidic device.\nRemove one side of the protective film on the double-sided tape, align the holes in the tape and the top ITO glass slide, and press them together. Press gently to remove air pockets, especially near the microchannel. Air pockets may allow the medium or other solutions to seep under the tape, which can damage or cause mold in the microfluidic device.\nRemove the other protective film from the double-sided tape, and press onto the molybdenum and A:Si-coated ITO glass side. Match the edge of the photoconductive slide that is opposite to the 2 mm clearance side to the edge of the double-sided tape that is toward the center of the top ITO glass slide. There will be hangover from the top ITO glass slide and the photoconductive material-coated ITO glass slide.",
    "Press on a flat surface to ensure good adhesion. A schematic of the glass substrate and double-sided tape layers is illustrated in Figure 1A. Cut off excess tape on the side.\nApply copper tape to the edges of layer A and layer C to connect the function generator. Do this by wrapping the tape on the side of the ITO or photoconductive material, depending on if it is layer A or layer C, from the edge of the double-sided tape to about 3 cm onto the uncoated side of the glass substrate.\nTo ensure successful device fabrication, use a multimeter to test for a resistance reading between the coated slides of both glass substrates and the copper tape that was attached to the glass.\nDEP buffer preparation\n\t\nMeasure out 4.25 g of sucrose, and place it into a 50 mL conical tube. Then, measure out 0.15 g of glucose, and place it into the same 50 mL conical tube.\nFill the conical tube with 25 mL of ultrapure water, close the lid, and mix. Once about half of the sucrose and glucose have dissolved, fill the conical tube with ultrapure water up to the 50 mL line. Mix vigorously until all the sucrose and glucose are dissolved. DEP buffer solution contains 8.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.3% (w/v) glucose.\nObtain 20 mL of the prepared sucrose and glucose solution, and place it into a 50 mL conical tube. Then, measure out 0.1 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA), and place it into the 50 mL conical tube containing the sucrose and glucose solution. Vortex until the BSA is dissolved. The final DEP buffer solution contains 0.5% (w/v) BSA.\nCell preparation",
    "Obtain at least 1 x 106 cells (hMSCs or HEK 293) suspended in 1 mL of growth medium using the cell culture protocol described in previous studies26,27. Place the cell suspension into a 10 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the HEK 293 cells at 201 x g for 5 min and the hMSCs at 290 x g for 10 min. After centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of the DEP buffer solution with 0.5% BSA. Be sure not to add the buffer solution too fast because bubbles may form.\nRepeat the centrifugation process two more times, and then resuspend the cells in the DEP buffer with 0.5% BSA for LiDEP characterization. The cell preparation protocol listed is enough for 10 runs. For example, one frequency test requires at least 15 runs, and, thus, 2 mL of cells at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL needs to be made.\n2. LiDEP characterization\nExperimental setup\n\t\nAssemble the following equipment for the experimental setup for quantifying the cellular responses to LiDEP: a laptop, a projector, an objective lens, a digital microscope, and a function generator. Use the laptop to design the light projections (star, diamond, three lines, and oval), and connect it to the projector.\nUse the projector as the light source to display the light projections onto the photoconductive surface (layer C) of the LiDEP chip. Set it up so that the light from the light source (projector) travels through a 10x objective lens onto the microchannel region of the LiDEP chip. The 10x objective lens sits on top of the projector lens. Supplementary Figure 1 shows the integration of the projector into the LiDEP system.",
    "Connect the LiDEP chip to the function generator to apply the AC electric field. Observe the cells experiencing the LiDEP force by using the digital microscope for imaging and video recording. Figure 1B shows a schematic of the experimental apparatus. Follow standard cell culture protocols26,27 for all the cells tested.\nExperimental procedures\n\t\nFlush the microchannel with 70% ethanol, followed by 0.5% BSA solution. Flush the microchannel again with 0.5% BSA solution two more times to ensure that the ethanol and previous cells are completely washed away. Cells that have already been exposed to the DEP field will respond differently than fresh cells and may disrupt the data collection.\nRemove the 0.5% BSA solution with a pipette, and fit the microfluidic device into the device holder.\nAttach alligator clips to each of the copper tape connections on the device. Set the function generator to the desired voltage (voltage peak-to-peak, Vpp) and frequency (Hz). The frequency range tested here was 30 kHz to 20 MHz.\nAdd 70 µL of cell suspension (cells + DEP buffer solution with 0.5% BSA) into the device microchannel. Due to the thinness of the microchannel (~0.05 mm), spillage out of the inlet and outlet holes may occur. To help reduce the amount of spillage, use a smaller pipette tip, and tilt the tip slightly in the hole toward the microchannel. Any access solution (0.5% BSA or cells in solution) can be wiped away with single-use paper wipes and discarded into biohazard waste.\nProject the desired virtual electrode geometry (here, circles, diamonds, stars, and/or parallel lines) onto the LiDEP chip.",
    "In the digital microscope software, set the video length to 3 min. Set a lab timer to 2 min 30 s. Once the cells are stationary in the microchannel of the LiDEP chip, press Start in the digital microscope software to begin the video recording process.\nWait 10 s, then press the ON button of the function generator channel output to apply the AC electric field, and press Start for the timer. Monitor the cell DEP behavior through the digital microscope, and prevent shaking or movement around the setup.\nOnce the timer goes off, press the ON button of the function generator channel output. This turns the function generator channel output off, and the AC electric field is no longer supplied through the electrodes. Stop the video recording at 3 min, and save to the digital microscope for future analysis.\nPipette the cells out of the outlet end of the LiDEP chip by slowly pushing 60 µL of DEP buffer with 0.5% BSA into the microchannel and simultaneously collecting at the outlet. Continue until there are little to no cells in the microchannel.\nRepeat steps 2.2.3-2.2.9 until all frequencies have been tested."
