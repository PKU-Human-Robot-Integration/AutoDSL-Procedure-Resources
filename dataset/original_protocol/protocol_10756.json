    "1. Plasmid DNA Purification\nTransform the eukaryotic plasmid DNA encoding EGFP (pCX-EGFP) into DH5α E.coli competent cells.  The empty pCX vector may also be used as a negative control.    \nCulture and harvest the DH5α E.coli cells and purify the pDNA according to the Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Purification Handbook. \nFilter pDNA solution through a 0.22 μm PVDF sterile filter, and store it at -20 °C until use. \n2. Tattoo System Preparation\nConnect the handheld unit and the control pedal to the power supply unit per the manufacturer's instructions.    \nSet the needle oscillation frequency to approximately 100 Hz. For the tattooing device we chose (Stealth Rotary Tattoo System), the dial on the power supply should be set to 4 volts. Refer to user manuals or technical support for other tattooing systems. \nSterilize the needle array before use. We recommend using one needle array per animal. The needles can be reused after being cleaned with soapy water and autoclaved.\nInstall the needle array into the handheld unit and loosely attach the plastic grip. \nAdjust the needle depth to an appropriate setting by moving the plastic grip up or down. We used a needle depth of approximately 0.5 mm for our mouse experiment. \nTighten the plastic grip when the needle depth is properly set, and the tattoo system is ready for use. \n3. Animal Shaving\nChoose the site for the tattooing treatment. The site should be a relatively firm, flat, and fleshy area of the skin, for example, the side of the animal's hindleg.    \nAnesthetize a balb/c mouse with a mixture of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) according to the animal's body weight. For other animals, refer to the anesthesia guidelines of your institution. \nCheck the animal's reflexes by pinching its foot to confirm the animal is properly anesthetized.",
    "Use the electrical trimmer to trim down the hair at the animal's hindlegs slowly and carefully. Remove the hair from the planned tattooing site and the surrounding area. \nRemove the residual shorter hair with the disposable safety razor. Be careful not to cut the animal's skin. Note that depilatory cream may be used as an alternative hair-removal method; however, we prefer shaving over depilatory cream. \nRemove stray cut hairs from the skin with compressed air if necessary. \n4. Delivery of Plasmid DNA by Tattooing\nIf an immunization protocol has been established previously, the dose and volume of DNA solution to be applied should be calculated accordingly. We recommend using as small a volume as practical to make the tattooing process more manageable. In this EGFP demonstration, we used 7.5 μl of DNA solution at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml, which was applied onto a tattooing area of approximately 1 cm2. For immunization experiments, higher pDNA concentrations may be required to induce strong immune responses1,2.    \nApply the DNA solution by pipetting directly onto the tattooing site. Alternatively, load the DNA solution into the plastic grip by pipetting, so the liquid is suspended between the needle and the tip of plastic grip. Refer to the video for a demonstration. We have observed no noticeable difference between the two methods. However, loading the solution into the plastic grip may be advantageous on vertical skin surfaces, for example. \nStart the needle oscillation and place the needle array with light pressure on the animal's skin at the tattooing site. Then move the oscillating needle gently and slowly in a linear fashion to deliver plasmid DNA over the entire tattooing area. Maintain a 90-degree angle between the needle and the skin to avoid lacerations to the skin.",
    "Observe the skin. Abrasion and inflammation are normal. If bleeding happens, stop the tattooing process and decrease the needle depth. \nContinue the needle movement for approximately 1 min, and then stop the tattooing process.    \nUse a clean cotton swab to apply a thin layer of topical analgesic on the tattooing site. Topical analgesics such as Silver Sulfadiazine Cream (SSD Cream) or Neosporin ointment can help alleviate the pain or distress of the animals, and therefore it is advised to apply them before the anesthesia wears off. Observe the animals the next day for signs of pain or distress (change of gait, inactivity). Reapply analgesic cream if the signs persist. \n5. Confirmation of Antigen Expression\n48 hr after the tattooing treatment (note that different pDNA constructs may require different expression times), the mouse is euthanized by CO2 narcosis. For other animals, refer to the euthanasia guidelines of your institution.    \nDissect the skin at the tattooing site, and fix the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight.\nRinse the tissue with 70% ethanol, and transfer it into 1X PBS for imaging. \nExamine the whole tissue using a confocal microscope to check for EGFP signals. Alternatively, the skin tissue can be embedded in paraffin wax and examined in sections under a fluorescent microscope.    \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
