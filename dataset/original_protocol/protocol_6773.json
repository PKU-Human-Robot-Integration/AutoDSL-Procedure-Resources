    "Stage setup Make sure the heating pad of the stage is plugged in and that the stage is at 37 °C before starting the animal procedure.Microscope setup Turn on the laser source, microscope and start the imaging applications, and all imaging components (data analysis workstation/computer, monitor, laser sources, camera, raster scanning unit, and detectors).!CAUTION: Prepare all microscopic settings before subjecting the animals to anesthesia. Anesthetic cone setup Uncouple the normal sized anesthetic cone from the anesthetic breathing circuit and cover the end with a cut-out finger from a rubber glove. Cut a small hole at the tip of the rubber finger to fit the size of the neonatal mouse head (Figure 1A).!CAUTION: The hole size of the rubber glove finger should fit tightly around the head of the neonate mouse head, otherwise the isoflurane gas might leak. Mice and surgery for image preparation A neonatal ROSAmT/mG;Tie2-Cre mouse of either sex is used in this protocol to visualize the hemodynamics of the small intestinal microcirculation.Place the mouse in the chamber for anesthesia with 2% isoflurane in oxygen. Confirm appropriate anesthesia by the absence of the withdrawal reflex after a toe pinch, as well as physiological responses including reduced respiratory and heartbeat rate. Once the mouse is anesthetized, reduce the isoflurane gas flow to 1-1.5%.Put the mouse on the preheated heating pad on a diaper pad, and the mouse head into the end of the anesthetic breathing circuit, with the mouse’s upper extremities fixed to the rubber finger with tape (Figure 1B).!CAUTION: To ensure that the animal is unconscious during the procedure, isoflurane is delivered continuously via the end of the anesthetic breathing circuit with the rubber finger covering the nose.",
    "Tape the lower extremities of the mouse to fix the body on the stage of the microscope and position it with a downward slope towards the tail (Figure 1C).The level of the downward slope should be such that it makes a triangular space on the neonatal abdomen from a lateral view. The angle θ from 30 to 45 degree is the best range for this experiment (Figure 1D, see also Table 2).▲ CRITICAL STEP: Making this triangular space is critical to stabilize the image or movie. The top side of this triangle should be aligned at the same height as the sternum, and the bottom of the angle should be positioned above the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (Figure 1D). Table 2. Troubleshooting table table:",
    "﻿0,1,2,3\nStep,Problem,Possible reason,Solution\n8,Can not make the triangle space,The level of downward slope is not enough,Put a small back pillow made by Kimwipe or a small folded cloth between the soft absorbable pad and mouse's back. See also Figure 1D.\n12,Bleeding from the abdominal wall,Incision line may have transversed the inferior epigastric artery and vein,Make a muscle incision vertically at the middle of abdominal wall. You can distinguish the vertical abdominal midline from other muscle lesion because only the midline can see through to the inside of the abdominal wall clearly.\n13,Bleeding from the intestine or mesenteric lesion,Too much force was used to pulled the intestine outside of the abdominal cavity,\"During picking up of the intestine and putting it back into the abdominal cavity, be careful not to pull the intestine lower than the superior interior iliac spine level to avoid the intestinal and mesentric injury induced by tensile force.\"\n17,Having a difficulty making the gentle curve of the solder lug,Fine manual work could be difficult by hand,Use two fine pliers and gently make the curve.\n23,The fixed intestinal color is getting dark after putting the cover glass on it,The pressure on the fixed intestine is too high,\"Remove the cover glass quickly and release the compressed intestine. Re-check the diameter of both the intestine and the space created by the curved solder lug, and regulate the shape of the solder lug to fit the intestinal diameter.\"\n24,Can not keep the optimal intestinal observation position without intestinal physical injury.,Pulling up the intestine over the heart level or pulling down the intestine over the superior anterior iliac spine level.,Re-check the anesthetic mouse body condition. Make sure that there is a enough trianglular square under the horizontal line of sternum. See also step 5 troubleshooting.",
    "27,Noisy background signal,Laser power is too high,\"Too high of a laser power can cause not only photobleaching or photo-damage to the observed intestine but also non-specific autofluorescence. Decreasing the laser power (regulation of both laser intensity and fluorescent gain) is necessary, and then keep the imaging lesion clear as long as possible when long observation time is needed.\"\n27,Difficulty focusing the images,Focusing area is outside of the contact area,Control the x and y axes and find the appropriate contact region. Possible intestinal scan area is limited in the attached lesion with coverglass. See also step 20.",
    "Disinfect the whole abdominal skin area with 70% ethanol. Note that normally, mice have no hair in the neonatal period. If the mice have the hair on the operational skin area, you should use the hair remover gel to remove the hair softly with a small cotton swab.Put a sterile gauze on top of the disinfected abdominal area. The sterile gauze should have a small hole in the middle large enough to allow making a small incision.Make a vertical skin incision at the lower to middle abdominal area. This incision will expose the intestine and urinary bladder through the abdominal muscle layer.Cut the abdominal muscle and peritoneal layer vertically in the middle (Figure 1E, see also Table 2).!CAUTION: The length of the abdominal muscle incision should be shorter than the length of the skin incision to prevent intestinal protrusion and allow the mouse’s body to maintain its position throughout the imaging. Push gently on the lateral sides of the abdominal wall to allow a portion of the intestine to be completely externalized from the abdominal cavity. Using the cecum as a landmark, locate the segment of the small intestine that is of interest to your study, and place the rest of the intestinal length back into the abdominal cavity (Figure 1F, see also Table 2).▲CRITICAL STEP: It is not recommended to use forceps to locate the cecum because even with gentle maneuvers, picking with forceps could easily injure the neonatal intestine. Additionally, it is possible that with an intestinal disease model, the microcirculation of the target area is already compromised, making the intestine and blood vessels even more delicate.",
    "With confirmation of the location of the cecum, which allows to distinguish the small intestine from the colon, the intestine should be carefully handled from a region away from the target area. The rest of the intestine should be put back into the abdominal cavity using blunt forceps. !CAUTION: Gentle maneuvers are necessary while moving the intestine around. Using blunt forceps, try to move the intestine by grasping tissue away from target region. Avoid unnecessary picking of the intestine with the forceps to reduce the number of contact points and to prevent puncturing/injuring the intestine. Avoid grasping the mesentery when moving the intestine. For the small intestine section that is selected for observation, use blunt forceps to gently pull out a small portion of the intestine that you will be observing. It is important to do this gently and allow the tissue to be under no tension to prevent potential ischemia or damage. Place one drop of PBS on the intestine to avoid drying.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3937/bioprotoc-11-05-3937-g001.jpgFigure 1. Neonatal mouse preparation for the TPLSM analysis. (A-D) Mouse anesthesia and appropriate positioning. (E, F) Intestine exposure.Preparation of custom fixing device Bend the solder lug to a gentle curve, creating a space to sandwich the intestine between the ring of the solder lug and the cover glass (Figures 2A, 2B).Attach the other end of the bent solder lug to the holding device with tape (Figure 2C).Put the cover glass on the end of the solder lug that is attached to the holding device and clip it in place using the holding device. Ensure that there is space between the ring of the solder lug and the cover glass.",
    "The thickness of the space between the cover glass and the ring of the solder lug should be exactly the same as the maximum diameter of the intestine (Figure 2D, see also Table 2).!CAUTION: Maintaining a fixed space between the solder lug and cover glass according to the actual diameter of the intestine is crucial to keep the intestine in place while allowing proper intestinal blood circulation. Bend the ring of the solder lug to a complete horizontal plane parallel to the cover glass (Figure 2E, 2F).▲CRITICAL STEP: Precise bending of the solder lug to sandwich the intestine between the ring of the solder lug and the cover glass is crucial to keep the small intestine in position during microscopic observation. After creating the appropriate space between the bent solder lug and cover glass and orienting the solder lug ring parallel to the cover glass on a horizontal plane, remove the cover glass.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3937/bioprotoc-11-05-3937-g002.jpgFigure 2. Fixing device setup for intestinal microscopic observation. (A, B) Solder lug. (C, D). Solder lug attached to holding device with appropriate spacing, the spacing should be the same as the diameter of the intestine being used (generally between 1 and 3 mm). (E, F) Cover glass attached on top of the solder lug and clipped with the holding device.Preparation of the microscopic stage Transfer the customized fixing device to the microscopic stage where the mouse is mounted.Put the ‘U’ shaped intestine on the ring of the solder lug. Wet the intestine with a drop of PBS and place the cover glass directly on top of the area, fixing the cover glass with the clip of the holding device. The bottom area of the ‘U’ shaped intestine should be slightly over the solder lug (Figure 3A).",
    "CRITICAL STEP: If the bottom area of ‘U’ shaped intestine is not over the solder lug, the position of the intestine should be moved, as miss positioning may prevent stable intravital imaging. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3937/bioprotoc-11-05-3937-g003.jpgFigure 3. Neonatal mouse intestine exposed for TPLSM observation. (A-C) Mouse intestine preparation and areas of observation. The yellow marking or alternatively in the red dotted area shows the contact lesion area between small intestinal wall and the cover glass. The green dashed line (under image) shows the cover glass level (the top picture in C: view from above the cover glass, the bottom picture in C: view from the frontal view. The observable area is between the green dotted line and the yellow line from the frontal view. The red dashed circle represents the outer intestinal wall line from the frontal view. (D) Illustration of mouse intestine for microscopic observation.Put one drop of distilled water on the cover glass where the intestine is touching the cover glass. Bring down the objective lens immersion into the waterdrop dome and begin the microscopic observation (Figure 3B).Figure 3C shows the ideal set up of the customized holding device, the microscope, and the mouse. After putting the cover glass on top of the intestine, only a small portion of the intestine will be in contact with the cover glass (shown in Figure 3C inside the yellow marking or alternatively in the red dotted area). This area will be the best location to observe the whole intestinal wall from the serosa level to the villi. When viewing the set up from the side, the segment of intestine sandwiched between the solder lug and the cover glass should look slightly oval shaped (Figure 3C red dotted circles). This positioning of the intestine is essential to prevent ischemia (see also Table 2).",
    "▲CRITICAL STEP: Make sure that the intestine is not damaged after fixation on the device and putting on the coverglass. Damaged tissue can be identified by increased redness. If the color of the intestine turns dark soon after fixation, remove the cover glass immediately and release the compression to restore intestinal blood flow circulation. !CAUTION: Placing of the cover glass and securing it with the clip must be done very carefully. Applying too much pressure with the clip can break the cover glass. Once the intestine is fixed, ensure that any parts of the device are not in direct contact with the mouse body (Figure 3D). Additionally, confirm that the fixed intestine that is being observed lies between the sternum and the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine in position (see also Table 2).!CAUTION: Do not pull the intestine above the level of the heart (towards the head) to avoid both the potential positional effects on blood pressure and the potential effects on blood flow from stretching the tissue. As well, do not pull the intestine below the level of the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine, this would impose too much tension and cause ischemia. Intravital imaging Intravital observation can now be performed using a Zeiss LPM710 inverted microscope (Zeiss) with ×20 water immersion objective lens (W Plan-Apochromat 20×/1.0 DIC, VIS-IR M27 75mm). TPLSM images are acquired at 512 × 512 pixels of spatial resolution from a 386.45 μm field of view. The excitation wavelength to detect GFP is 910 nm. The scan speed should be set at 1.27 μs/pixel. Two-photon fluorescence signals are collected by an internal detector (non-descanned detection method) at an excitation wavelength.!CAUTION: The laser power is adjusted according to the imaging depth and intestinal diameter.",
    "When imaging at greater depths, the laser power level should be increased (up to 100%) manually using the laser power level controller. The laser power should be adjusted slowly from a low to high level to avoid photo-bleaching of the target area, which may occur at higher laser power. If the observation area is photo-bleached the stage must be moved to focus on another area. Each area of interest is scanned at a high magnification (water-immersion objective 20× or higher if desired) by manually setting the X/Y plane and adjusting the Z axis to obtain high-resolution, clear TPLSM images.In our experimental setting, the imaging depth ranged from 100 μm to 400 μm. Optimal high-resolution images were obtained from the tissue surface up to 200 μm in depth. For optimal simultaneous imaging of EGFP and tdTOMATO, detection gain should be adjusted for EGFP (to 500-570) or tdTOMATO (to 580-650)!CAUTION: The range of gain value should be changed according to each intestinal region. A higher gain produces a stronger signal; however, it also produces more background. ▲CRITICAL STEP: The combination of laser power and gain value determines the intensity of the laser signal. The settings of these two values depend on the quality of image focus and on the length of time of continuous imaging (see also Table 2).Start the observation and recording by TPLSM and save the acquired data. Saving the data as a czi file is recommended because czi files can be used to analyze the blood flow dynamics or make Z-stack movies/3-dimentional images using ZEN 2 lite software after imaging.!CAUTION: For the analysis of blood flow dynamics, including blood flow velocity, blood flow volume, and leukocyte rolling speed, we recommend capturing 80-100 frames within 30 s.",
