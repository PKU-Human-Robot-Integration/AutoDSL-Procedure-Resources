    "The animal experiments were all performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines and approved protocols at Clemson University. Surgical procedures were performed in anesthetized wild-type C57BL/6J mice between 8 and 10 weeks old.\n1. Animal surgery\nPreparation of solutions and instruments\n\tNOTE: Perfusion solutions and anesthesia cocktail recipes are shown in the Table of Materials.\n\t\nPrepare Perfusion Solution 1 (HEPES, EGTA, and EBSS), Perfusion Solution 2 (HEPES, EGTA, EBSS, CaCl2, and MgSO4), and Perfusion Solution 3 (Solution 2 and Liberase). Make sure the solutions are well mixed.\nSet the water bath to 42 °C and prewarm Perfusion Solutions 1, 2, and 3 for a minimum of 30 min before starting the procedure and keep them in the water bath.\n\t\tNOTE: Perfusion Solutions 1 and 2 will chelate the calcium and flush out the blood in the liver. Perfusion Solution 3 contains the digestive enzyme liberase to dissociate the extracellular matrix.\nPlace 150 mL of DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in conical tubes and keep them on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: This medium will be used to release the cells from the liver capsule and wash the isolated hepatocytes in steps 2.1 and 2.2, respectively.\nSet the centrifuge to 4 °C.\nSterilize the pump tubing by placing both ends of the tubing in a flask filled with 70% ethanol and cycling the ethanol three times.\nWash the tubing with distilled water and empty it.\nFill the tubing with prewarmed 30 mL of Perfusion Solution 1, followed by 8 mL of Perfusion Solution 2. If the tubing still has space for more fluids, fill the rest of the tubing with Perfusion Solution 3. Stop the pump when switching to a different perfusion solution to avoid introducing air bubbles into the tubing.",
    "Place the excess tubing into the 42 °C water bath to keep the perfusion solutions warm.\nPlace the end of the pump tubing in the conical tube containing Perfusion Solution 3, while kept in the water bath.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is necessary to allow the pump to continuously fill with Perfusion Solution 3 during perfusion.\nAnimal preparation\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse by injecting the anesthetic cocktail intraperitoneally at a dose of 10-11.7 µL/g body weight. The anesthetic cocktail has a final concentration of 7.5 mg/mL ketamine, 0.25 mg/mL acepromazine and 1.5 mg/mL xylazine.\nMonitor the mouse breathing and check that the mouse is not reacting to pain. Wait until the mouse has a breathing rate of ~55-65 breaths per min, is unresponsive to having its toes pinched, and has a flaccid tail. Additionally, check the palpebral (blinking) reflex by lightly touching the skin on the medial side of the closed eye. If the mouse blinks or the eye muscles twitch, increase the dose of the entire anesthetic cocktail by 5-10 µL.\nPlace the mouse on its back in a supine position and secure the limbs to the surface using pins or tape (Supplemental Figure S1).\nSpray the abdomen with 70% ethanol and pat it dry using a cotton ball.\nLiver perfusion\n\t\nMake a U-shaped lateral incision in the abdomen skin using scissors and expand the hole through the sides.\nContinue opening the skin to the rib cage.\nUsing scissors, cut through the peritoneum to expose the abdominal cavity up to the rib cage, being careful not to nick any organs. Move the intestines to the right side using the back of forceps or the blunt surface of scissors. Identify the inferior vena cava and the portal vein (Supplemental Figure S1).\nStart the pump to flush prewarmed perfusion solution through the catheter.",
    "Stop the pump and remove the catheter once all air has been flushed through the system. Insert the tip of the needle connected to the catheter into the inferior vena cava at a 10°-20° angle to the vein. Remove the needle from the catheter and gently push the catheter into the vein in a movement parallel to the vein.\n\t\t​NOTE: The user should observe flashback of blood in the catheter to verify proper cannulation in the vein.\nConnect the tubing to the catheter without moving the catheter further into the vein.\nStart the pump with a 2 mL/min flow rate. Look for the liver immediately turning pale as a sign that the perfusion is successful.\nCut the portal vein using scissors.\nGradually increase the flow rate to 5 mL/min.\nApply pressure periodically to the portal vein at the approximate cut site for 3 s using forceps or a cotton swab to block the drainage and facilitate good perfusion.\nOnce Perfusion Solution 3 is flowing through, carefully monitor the elasticity of the liver. To determine if the liver is softened, gently press the liver with a cotton swab or forceps and check whether indentations form on the liver. Be careful not to overperfuse to avoid loss of cell viability.\nOnce the liver is softened (occurring after 30-50 mL of Perfusion Solution 3 has flowed through), stop the pump, remove the catheter, and carefully dissect the liver. Place the liver into a 100 mm Petri dish containing ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS medium. Excise the gallbladder, being careful not to spill its contents. Swirl the Petri dish to gently remove possible blood clots.\nTransfer the liver to a new Petri dish containing ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS medium.\n2. Hepatocyte isolation\nRelease cells from the liver capsule.",
    "Place the Petri dish on ice and using two pairs of sterile forceps, gently tear apart the liver capsule on all the lobes. Gently swirl the liver around in the medium using a cell lifter or a forceps to release the hepatocytes. Continue this motion until the liver becomes very small and the suspension turns brown and opaque.\nRemove the remains of the liver tissue from the plate and using a 25 mL serological pipette set to low speed, carefully transfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL conical tube (prechilled on ice) fitted with a 100 μm cell strainer.\nAdd fresh, ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS medium to the Petri dish to wash out and collect the remaining cells from the surface and transfer to the 50 mL conical tube. Repeat this step until all the cells are collected.\nWash and purify hepatocytes from nonparenchymal cells.\n\t\nCentrifuge the cells collected in the 50 mL conical tube at 50 × g at 4 °C for 5 min at low deceleration or without any brakes.\nDiscard the supernatant containing debris and nonparenchymal cells and resuspend the pellet in the leftover supernatant by gently swirling the tube. After the pellet is resuspended, add 30 mL of fresh, ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS medium.\nRepeat the centrifugation (step 2.2.1) and washing (step 2.2.3) three times.\nResuspend the final cell pellet in 10 mL of ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume of medium used to resuspend the pellet depends on the pellet size. If the pellet is considerably smaller than 15 mm, use 1-5 mL of ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS medium.\nCell viability quantification",
    "In a microfuge tube, add 50 µL of 0.4% Trypan Blue solution to 350 µL of Hepatocyte Plating Medium (PM). Then, add 100 µL of cell suspension to make a final 1:5 dilution and pipette up and down multiple times to mix.\nCount cell density and viability using a hemocytometer. While counting, place the hepatocyte suspension on ice, and then place the ice bucket on an orbital shaker set to 30 rpm to keep the hepatocytes from settling.\nFollow the Percoll treatment and centrifugation steps below if the cell viability is <70%.\n\t\t\nDilute Percoll with 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a 9:1 ratio.\nMix the hepatocyte suspension with the diluted Percoll in a 1:1 ratio.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g at 4 °C for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant containing dead cells. Resuspend the pellet in ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS medium.\nCount the cells again.\nTesting hepatocytes for plateability\n\t\nPlate some of the cells on collagen I-coated 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells per mL using 1.5 mL of prewarmed PM.\nKeep the remaining cells on ice while on an orbital shaker until ready to perform electroporation.\nPlace the plate of cells in a water-jacketed CO2 incubator at 37 C. Move the plate horizontally and vertically gently in a north-to-south and east-to-west motion to ensure homogeneous plating. Repeat the movement two more times every 1.5 h.\nVerify cell attachment at 3 h after plating.\n\t\tNOTE: At least 60% of the cells should adhere to the plate as an indicator of good-quality hepatocytes.\nChange the medium to prewarmed Hepatocyte Maintenance Medium (MM) at 24 h after plating to maintain the cells in culture.\nGlycogen staining\n\t\nAfter the cells have attached to the 6-well collagen I-coated plates, remove the spent medium from the cultured cells.",
    "Fix the cells for 10-15 min in ice-cold ethanol.\nWash thoroughly with sterile water.\nIncubate in 1% aqueous periodic acid for 5 min and then wash with sterile water.\nIncubate in 100% Schiff Reagent for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The Schiff reagent must not be diluted before adding to the cells.\nWash with water three times over 10 min.\nMount in mounting medium.\nImage using a microscope on brightfield setting.\n3. Design sgRNAs for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing\nNOTE: This section describes the design of an sgRNA targeting the mouse hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (Hpd) gene as proof-of-principle gene editing to disrupt a therapeutic target gene related to an IMD of the liver.\nDesign the guide sequence targeting the Hpd using the referenced software15.\nVerify the sequence for Hpd with the Ensembl Genome Browser.\nUse the following parameters for designing the gRNA: single guide length of 20 nucleotides and an NGG (N can be any nucleotide) protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence.\nSelect a target region from exon 3 in the Hpd.\nGenerate a list of guide sequences from the target region with On- and Off-Target Scores.\n\tNOTE: The On-Target Score indicates predicted on-target editing efficiency for the given design: a higher score is correlated with higher editing efficiency. The Off-Target Score correlates with the specificity of the guide sequence: a higher score indicates lower probability of off-target editing. Ideally both scores should be high: the On-Target Score >60, and the Off-Target Score >50.\nSelect the guide sequence with the highest On-Target and Off-Target Scores. Have the sgRNA containing the guide sequence chemically synthesized.\n4. Electroporation and cell culture\nPreparation of CRISPR-Cas9 substrates, media, cells, and the electroporation instrument\n\t\nAdd the entire accompanying supplement to the PM and warm in the 37 °C water bath for 10 min.",
    "Turn on the electroporation device by pressing the power button and set the electroporation program by pressing the x button and then the down arrow button until the program T-028 appears on the screen.\nPrepare the destination wells for the electroporated hepatocytes by adding 1.5 mL of PM to six-well collagen I-coated plates. Incubate the plates in a 37 °C incubator until ready to use.\nAdd the entire accompanying supplement to the electroporation buffer solution and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Label the electroporation buffer expiration date on the vial (3 months after the date of supplement addition).\nRemove the electroporation vessels from the packaging and label them for each sample.\nIn PCR split-strip tubes, prepare the Cas9 RNP complexes by combining 30 µg of sgRNA with 300 pmol of Cas9 protein and incubate the complexes at room temperature for 10 min. Prepare the Cas9 mRNA by combining 30 µg of sgRNA with 4 µL of Cas9 mRNA (1 µg/µL). Store the mRNA-sgRNA mix on ice until electroporation. Separately prepare a tube containing 1.0 µg of eGFP mRNA to verify successful electroporation using fluorescence microscopy.\nCentrifuge 1.2 × 106 cells per electroporation reaction at 100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant from the cell pellet and add 100 µL of electroporation solution per reaction along the side of the tube wall. Resuspend the hepatocytes in the electroporation solution by rocking the tube gently by hand.\nElectroporation of CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs and mRNA into hepatocytes\n\t\nOnce the hepatocytes appear evenly dispersed in the electroporation solution, transfer 100 µL of the hepatocyte suspension to the strip tubes containing the Cas9 complexes.\n\t\tNOTE: Use wide-bore pipette tips when transferring hepatocytes to preserve cell viability.\nTransfer the contents of the strip well to a electroporation vessel.",
    "Place the nucleovette vessel into the slot on the electroporation device. Electroporate the hepatocytes by pressing the x button. After electroporation, wait for a screen to pop up on the device that says OK. Press the x button again and remove the vessel.\nIncubate the electroporated vessel on ice for 15 min.\nAdd 500 µL of prewarmed PM to the electroporation vessel.\nTransfer 300 µL of the electroporation reaction to each destination well on the prewarmed plate.\n\t\tNOTE: There should be two destination wells per electroporation reaction. One well will be used to quantify gene editing efficiency; the other well will be used for the MTT and albumin assays.\nTo prevent hepatocytes from accumulating in the center of the well, disperse the cells by gently moving plates horizontally and vertically in a north-to-south and east-to-west motion. Ensure that the plate maintains contact with the incubator shelf while it is being moved. Repeat this motion at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min after plating the electroporated hepatocytes.\nIncubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.\nRemove the medium from the wells designated for gene editing analysis 24 h after plating the cells, and replace with 0.25 mg/mL basement membrane matrix overlay.\n\t\t​NOTE: If stored in the freezer, transfer the membrane matrix to 4 °C and allow it to thaw. Because the basement membrane matrix is solid above 10 °C, it is crucial for the basement membrane matrix to remain on ice or at 4 °C until ready to use.\n5. Calculate the volume of the membrane matrix to mix with MM to give a final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL\nNOTE: For a 6-well plate, 2 mL of overlay is needed per well.",
