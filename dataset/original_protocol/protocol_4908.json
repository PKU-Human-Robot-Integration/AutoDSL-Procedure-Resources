    "Depending on the experimental design, the number of microglial cells required for experiments varies. Below we list the steps of processing 3 newborn mouse pups to generate mixed glial cultures in two T-75 flasks. In the mixed culture, astrocytes form a confluent cell layer at the bottom and microglia grow on top of the astrocytic layer. The total amount of primary microglia generated from two T-75 flasks should be enough to seed four 12-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2.Coat two T-75 culture flasks with 7 ml each of 10 μg/ml PDL for 2 h. Wash the flask bottom with distilled water 3 times before use. Note: You can coat more flasks than needed and the unused coated flasks can be stored at 4 °C for months. We usually keep the flasks in plastic wrap to avoid contamination. Collect new born pups from breeding cages. Keep the pups on a 37 °C heating plate to maintain body temperature. In the meantime, prepare tools and reagents needed for the culture experiment. Spray dissection tools and work space with 75% ethanol. Warm up culture medium (No. 16 in ‘Materials and Reagents’ and No. 1 in ‘Recipes’) in 37 °C water bath.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030204248_5275.jpgFigure 1. Process of newborn mouse pups for primary microglial culture. (a) Use fine scissors to cut off the pup head. (b) Use fine scissors to cut open the scalp along the midline from the posterior end to the middle point between the two eyes. (c) When the thin skull was exposed, put one end of the fine forceps beneath the skull but above the brain tissue and pull toward the snout along the midline so that the brain could then be easily scooped out using curving forceps.Remove pups from the heating plate.",
    "Decapitate and place the heads into a 6 cm Petri dish containing 5 ml cold dissection media (Figure 1a) (No. 17 in ‘Materials and Reagents’ and No. 2 in ‘Recipes’). Use fine scissors to cut open the scalp along the midline starting posteriorly and ending near the snout (Figure 1b). Place one sharp tip of the fine forceps beneath the skull at the posterior end of a brain, and cut the skull by pushing the end from posterior to anterior (Figure 1c). Scoop out the brain using curving forceps and immerse the brains in 5 ml cold dissection media in a new Petri dish. Note: Newborn pups have a transparent and soft skull. Using scissors to cut the skull may damage the fragile brain tissue underneath.Put the Petri dish containing the brains under a dissection microscope. Carefully remove the meninges (readers may refer to the video presented by Bowyer et al., 2012 for this step) and collect the cortices and hippocampi. If you use 3 pups, you will get 6 halves. Put 3 halves per Petri dish with 5 ml dissection media and mince the tissue into small pieces using spring scissors. Transfer the contents of each dish to a 50 ml tube. Wash the dish with dissection media to collect any remaining tissue on the dish and repeat the transfer. Fill the 50 ml tube to reach a final volume of 30 ml dissection media. Add 1.5 ml 2.5% trypsin to each tube and incubate in the 37 °C water bath for 15 min. Swirl frequently.Add 1.2 ml 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and incubate for 1 min. Add 750 μl 10 mg/ml DNase to digest the sticky DNA released from dead cells.Centrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and triturate the pellet with 5 ml warm culture media using a 1 ml pipet tip. Transfer the homogenous cell suspension to a 15 ml tube. If undissociated tissue chunks remain, let them settle and repeat the trituration and transfer step using 3 ml media.Centrifuge the 15 ml tubes at 400 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 5 ml warmed culture media. Count the cell density using hemocytometer.Plate each tube of cells into one coated T-75 flask at the density of 50,000 cells/cm2. Add culture media to reach a volume of 15 ml in the flasks. Put seeded flasks into a CO2 cell culture incubator with 5% CO2, 100% humidity at 37 °C. Change the culture medium the next day to remove cell debris and then change culture media every 5 days.In 5-7 days, astrocytes at the bottom of the flask form a confluent cell layer (Figure 2). Microglia and some oligodendrocytes grow on top of the astrocytic layer. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030204532_7958.jpgFigure 2. Astrocytes form a connective confluent layer at the bottom in the mixed glial culture. Arrows point to representative astrocytes. Scale bar = 100 μm.To collect microglia, vigorously tap the flasks on the bench top and collect the floating cells in conditioned culture media (No need to change media before tapping). The resulting cells are purified microglia. Use a hemocytometer to count the floating cell density and seed the cells at 50,000 cells/cm2 in PDL-coated culture vessels. After 2 h, check that the microglia have attached to the bottom under a microscope. Aspirate medium and replace with fresh culture medium. The microglial cells are ready to use the next day (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030204634_4471.jpgFigure 3. Purified primary microglial culture.
