PNN disassembly by repeated KXA-induced anesthesia\nTiming: 1–3 weeks\nHere, we describe first how to prepare a ready-to-use KXA solution, followed by performing the intraperitoneal injection, and finally we outline how to check the level of anesthesia and how to maintain the animals during the anesthetized state.\nThe drug dosages used for mice are: (1) ketamine 100 mg/kg; (2) xylazine 10 mg/kg; (3) acepromazine 3 mg/kg.\nNote: The effect of PNN loss also occurs with just ketamine and xylazine. On the other hand, acepromazine reduces the death rate and improves the surgical plane (Arras et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCritical: Ketamine at this dosage must be combined with xylazine to prevent uncontrolled muscular contraction.\nPrepare the ketamine-xylazine-acepromazine (KXA) solution.\nCombine 2 mL of ketamine, 1 mL of xylazine, and 0.6 mL of acepromazine in 3 mL of physiological saline solution containing 0.9% (w/v) NaCl.\nVortex for 30 s.\nThe KXA solution should look yellow without any precipitates and can be stored for up to 2 weeks at 4°C. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nWeigh the mice on a fine scale.\nCalculate the injection dosage for each mouse. A mouse receives 33 μL/10 g weight e.g., a mouse weighing 30 g receives 99 μL of the KXA solution (Harkness and Wagner, 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCritical: The drug dosage must be adjusted for each mouse. Even if mice are the same sex or come from the same litter, there may be fluctuations in the body weight.\nPrepare a 1 mL syringe equipped with a 26G needle with the appropriate amount of KXA solution.\nInject intraperitoneally. A schematic of the repeated KXA treatment protocol can be found in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1234-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

S1, primary somatosensory cortex. V1, primary visual cortex.\n(B) Mouse receiving injection. Left, restraining position for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Arrow, position of the tail between the ring and the pinky of the operator. Right, the injection procedure, in which the needle is inserted with a 45° angle into the lower quadrant of the abdomen.\nGrab the mouse at the neck and turn it around (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nInsert the needle at 45° into the peritoneal cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCritical: Do not inject on the linea alba. This might cause lesions to the bladder.\nCritical: Make sure that the solution does not leak out of the mouse.\nNote: After the injection, no solution should accumulate and be visible under the skin.\nTurn the mouse back, head down, and gently release it back into its home cage.\nNote: Tilting the mouse head down helps push the internal organs towards the head, which prevents damage from the injection.\nCritical: The injection must be performed intraperitoneally with the needle inserted directly into the peritoneal cavity. In our experience and with the anesthetic dosage used in this protocol, misplacement will cause inefficient anesthesia induction. As a note, it has been shown that ketamine anesthesia can be achieved with subcutaneous administration in mice with double the concentration used here (Levin-Arama et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nMonitor the state of anesthesia.\nAfter the injection, the mouse will undergo a hyperexcitation phase for the first 1–2 min marked by increased running activity. Then, the mouse will slowly become unconscious, and the anesthesia will begin. It might take 5–10 min to reach the induction of the surgical plane, which will last for approximately 40 min. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]",
    "Apply eye ointment to prevent dehydration of the sclera.\nConfirm the anesthesia by checking the following parameters (Tsukamoto et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]):\nAbsence of the toe pinch reflex around 10 min after induction.\nDecrease in respiratory frequency.\nNo responses to noxious stimuli.\nFlaccid paralysis.\nAbsence of whisker movement.\nCritical: To prevent hypothermia, the mouse should be kept at 37°C with a heating pad or a red lamp for the entire time (induction, deep anesthesia and recovery phase).\nNote: Regularly check temperature with a thermometer and adjust the heating device accordingly.\nAfter complete recovery, return the mouse to the animal facility with food and water ad libitum.\nNote: If many animals are housed in the same cage, make sure that all animals are awake, as they otherwise become aggressive to the ones that are still waking up.\nNote: To avoid potential impact of circadian rhythm on brain activity (Hor et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), we always injected the animals at the same time (in our case 9 a.m.) and collected the tissue 4 h after the last treatment.\nRepeat steps 1–7 every 2–3 days at least two times (up to 6 times) to reach the desired level of reduction in the number of PNN-coated cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Expected results for 6× KXA treatment can be found in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1234-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Linear regression model with selected post-hoc comparison. ∗∗p < 0.01. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, nsp > 0.05. SEM: standard error of the mean.\nNote: We typically performed our analyses 4 h after the last injection.\nNote: 20% of PNN recovers within 3 days after the last 3× KXA injection and reaches full coverage by 14 days for S1 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) and V1 of C57BL/6J mice (Venturino et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nNote: PNN recovery kinetics may differ between the mouse model and strain background.\nNote: We observed a significant reduction in the number of PNNs in S1 and V1 after repeated KXA anesthesia (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The effect of this treatment may not be the same in all brain regions because ketamine does not act equally throughout the brain (Alda et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). For example, we found PNN removal in the hippocampus only after 6× KXA (Venturino et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nOption 2. PNN disassembly by 60-Hz light entrainment\nThis section describes first how to build and program a 60 Hz light stimulation device, and then how to verify the stimulation frequency. Steps 9–17 outline the building of the hardware, steps 18–24 the software.\nPart 1. Build light stimulation device for PNN disassembly with 60 Hz\nTiming: up to 1 h\nAn overview of the circuit and the components needed for the assembly of the light stimulation device can be found in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1234-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The LED strip goes round the box in 6 layers with 4 cm space in between.\nNote: Add the LED stripes in a way from top to bottom to allow equal illumination.\nThe circuit is built as outlined in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nTake the breadboard and insert the transistor. The ground pin of the transistor is on the right (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: The ground pin of the transistor is often indicated on the chip with the letter “G”.\nConnect the ground of the breadboard (blue symbol “−”) with the ground of the transistor (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).",
    "Put a 200 Ω resistor between the ground of the breadboard and the left pin of the transistor (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nNote: A resistor is critical for the functionality of the transistor.\nConnect one ground port of the Arduino board (indicated with the letters GND) to the ground of the breadboard (blue symbol “−”) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nConnect the digital port 5 of the Arduino board to the left pin of the transistor (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nNote: The resistor should be in front of the cable that goes to the left pin of the transistor.\nNote: The number of the Arduino digital port depends on the programming code. We used digital port 5 in our code to send the signal to the LEDs.\nConnect the voltage wires from the LED strip as follows:\nthe red cable is connected to the Arduino board at the Vin (voltage in) port, and\nthe black cable to the middle pin of the transistor (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nNote: If the cable is a fine-stranded conductor, solder a jumper wire on the cable to allow a stable connection with the transistor on the breadboard (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nCritical: Insulate the solder joint with electrical tape.\nThe system is connected to a 12 V power supply via the jack plug of the Arduino.\nDownload and install the Arduino IDE for PC or Mac from this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[href=https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software]\nConnect the Arduino board to the laptop with a USB cable type A/B.\nOpen the Arduino IDE (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J) and select the Arduino board in Tools > Board > Arduino/Genuino UNO.\nNote: Ensure that the correct Arduino board is selected.\nCopy and paste the following codes:\nfor the 60 Hz flickering in the Arduino IDE text editor:\nint ledPin = 5;//digital input from the board\nvoid setup ()\n{\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n}\nvoid loop()\n{",
    "digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);//light on, no fading\n  delay(8.3);//delay in ms\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);//light off, no fading\n  delay(8.3);//delay in ms\n}\nfor the control with the same light intensity without 60 Hz flickering.\nint ledPin = 5;//digital input from the board\nvoid setup ()\n{\n  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);\n}\nvoid loop()\n{\n  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);//keep light on\n}\nNote: In this script, we use digital port 5 to send the signal to the LEDs. If another digital port is used, the script has to be modified accordingly.\nVerify that the script is functional by clicking on the “check” icon (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nNote: If the script doesn’t work the Arduino IDE will show a red error message reporting in which line of the code the problem is. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nSelect the output port for uploading the code in Tools > Port. In our example, the port is COM5.\nNote: Ensure that the port number corresponds to your Arduino.\nUpload the code from step 21 by clicking on the “upload” icon (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L).\nNote: The Arduino board memorizes previously uploaded code. Each time the board is powered up it will execute the code automatically.\nConfirm with an oscilloscope that the frequency (60 Hz) and the shape (square wave) of the stimulation is correct (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]M).\nTake a mouse cage, adjust it to the center of the stimulation box, and mark the position with a tape (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]N).\nPart 2. PNN disassembly with 60 Hz light entrainment\nTiming: 5 days\nThis section outlines the light stimulation protocol for inducing PNN disassembly with 60 Hz light entrainment with the previously built device. An overview of the 60 Hz light stimulation protocol and the expected results can be found in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1234-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

SEM, standard error of the mean.\nAcclimatize animals after they have arrived from the animal facility for 1 h.\nNote: To avoid potential impact of circadian rhythm on brain activity (Hor et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), we always stimulated the animals at the same time (in our case from 9 to 11 a.m.) and collected the tissue four hours after the last stimulation.\nRemove all enrichment from the cage before stimulation to prevent the mouse from hiding.\nNote: The animals should always have unlimited access to food and water.\nPosition the animal cage in the marked position in the center of the box.\nNote: Up to 4 animals can be simultaneously stimulated.\nStart the Arduino software as described in the previous section in steps 21–24 and select the stimulation protocol for either 60 Hz or control non-flickering light but with the same light intensity.\nExpose the mice to light stimulation for 2 h per day for 5 consecutive days (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nNote: During the stimulation the box lid was closed.\nNote: This test paradigm causes approximately 40% PNN reduction in V1 (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C). We have no insights into whether prolonged treatment will further reduce PNN and how fast the PNN recovers. According to the recovery rate after 3× KXA administration, the PNN recovers by 20% within 3 days after KXA withdrawal (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "Note: We typically perfused the animal 4 hours after the last stimulation and performed image analysis. For detailed protocols see Venturino et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]. Alternatively, this protocol could be explored for in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake mice, behavioral studies, and in vivo imaging experiments to name a few.\nNote: The stimulation device generates electrical noise, therefore further modifications, such as isolating the electrical connections with copper mesh, are required to enable in-vivo electrophysiology during the 60 Hz light stimulation.
