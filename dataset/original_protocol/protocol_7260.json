    "Generation of stable cell lines for the expression of recombinant CD89If using commercial CD89 from Sino Biological, skip sections A and B, and go directly to section C.To generate recombinant soluble CD89 protein (rCD89), synthesize DNA that encodes human FcαRI/CD89 ectodomain (Met1-Asn227 based on RefSeq accession: NP_001991.1) fused to a C-terminus 3×Flag of DYKDHD-G-DYKDHD-I-DYKDDDDK sequence.Clone the cDNA fragment into pcDNA3 vector for expression using mammalian cells.Transfect pcDNA3-rCD89-Flag plasmid into HEK293 cells cultured in growth medium using Lipofectamine 2000 in 6-well plates following the standard transfection protocol. The plasmid (2.5 μg, diluted in 100 μL of Opti-MEM medium) and Lipofectamine 2000 (7.5 μL, diluted in 100 μL of Opti-MEM medium) are mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min, then added to the well and mixed with the culture medium by gently pipetting.After one day, dissociate the transfected cells by trypsin digestion and transfer the cells to 100 mm cell culture dishes with five-fold serial dilutions (five 100 mm dishes are used, with dilution ranges from 1:5 to 1:3125). Maintain the cells in 15 mL of selection medium.Replace the selection medium every 3 days for 14 days until distinct cell clones are formed with an average of 100–500 cells per clone.Isolate well-formed individual stable cell colonies under a microscope using a 20 μL pipette (by gently scratching and then catching the detached cell clones) and seed them in 96-well plates.Maintain the cells in the selection medium for 5–7 days without changing the medium. Test the medium in each well for recombinant expression of rCD89-Flag by dot-blotting using HRP-conjugated anti-DDDDK tag antibody.Prepare a strip of nitrocellulose membrane and draw grids (1 cm × 1 cm) on it with a pencil.Spot 5 µL of medium samples onto the nitrocellulose membrane at the center of the grids.",
    "Minimize the area that the samples penetrate (usually less than 4 mm in diameter) by applying it slowly. Wait until the membrane is dry.Block the membrane with 5% dry milk in TBST and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.Pour off the block buffer, and keep the membrane always wet for the remainder of the procedure.Incubate the membrane with HRP-conjugated anti-DDDDK tag antibody (dilute at the ratio of 1:1,000 with 2% non-fat milk in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature.Wash the membrane three times with TBST.Incubate the membrane with ECL reagent and image with a chemiluminescence imaging system. The ECL reagent detects protein at the picogram level.Select 2–3 stable cell clones with the highest recombinant protein expression and expend these individual clones to culture in 100 mm dishes.Freeze down stable cell clones with cryopreservation medium (2 × 107 cells/mL) using a cell freezing container (e.g., Nalgene 5100-0036), and then store the cell bank in a liquid nitrogen tank.Expression and purification of recombinant CD89-FlagCulture a high-yielding stable cell clone in 100 mm dishes with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 500 μg/mL G418.When the cells grow to ~90% confluency, change the medium to serum-free DMEM and culture for another 5 days to allow the production of rCD89-Flag protein in the culture medium.Harvest the medium (~100 mL) and then concentrate the medium with Amicon Ultra-15 filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 Da. Spin the filters at 4,000 × g at room temperature until the sample was concentrated to less than 5 mL.Assemble a 5 mL gravity column packed with 2 mL of anti-flag M2 antibody-conjugated affinity gel. Load the concentrated medium into the column.Wash the gravity column three times with PBS (30 mL each time).",
    "Then elute the recombinant protein with 5 mL of 3× Flag peptides at 150 μg/mL in PBS.Collect the elution buffer containing the rCD89 protein, and dialyze the purified protein against PBS buffer overnight at 4°C by using Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassettes with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 Da.Measure the total protein concentration using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, following the manufacturer’s instruction.Store the recombinant protein at -80°C.Detection of poly-IgA complexes in plasma by performing rCD89-directed ELISAPlate PreparationDilute rCD89 protein in carbonate sodium buffer (pH = 9.6) to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. Immediately coat a 96-well ELISA microplate or strips with 100 μL of rCD89 protein per well. Seal the plate and incubate the reactions overnight at 4°C.Aspirate each well and then wash the wells with 300 μL of washing buffer. Repeat the process two more times for a total of three rounds of washes. After the last wash, remove any remaining wash buffer by aspiration, and then by inverting the plate to be patted against a stack of clean paper towels.Block the plate by adding 300 μL of blocking buffer to each well. Incubate the blocking reactions at 37°C for 1 h.Repeat aspirating and washing cycles as described in step C1b. The plates are now ready for measuring samples. However, avoid letting the empty wells to get air dried for a long time.Prepare plasma samples and IgA standardDilute the plasma samples 1:1,000 in blocking buffer (Plasma can be from freshly harvested samples, or from frozen stocks retrieved from -80°C storage. Based on our test results, 2–3 rounds of freeze-thaw cycles with storage at -80°C do not significantly change the reading of poly-IgA contents using the assay.",
    "If there is any precipitation from the freeze-thaw process, plasma samples should be centrifuged to remove the precipitates at 3000 x g at 4°C for 15 min).Dilute purified human IgA1 standard in blocking buffer in a concentration series ranging from 500 μg/mL to 7.8125 μg/mL.Assay procedureAdd 100 μL of diluted plasma samples or IgA1 standards in blocking buffer to each well. Cover the plate with an adhesive strip and incubate the reactions for 3 h at 37°C.Perform aspiration/washing cycles as described in step C1b above.Dilute the detection antibody (HRP-conjugated anti-human IgA antibody) 1:1,000 in blocking buffer. Add 100 μL of detection antibody solution to each well. Cover the plate with a new adhesive strip and incubate the reactions for 1 h at 37°C.Wash the wells three times as described in step C1b.Add 100 μL of TMB substrate solution to each well. Incubate the reactions for 25 min at room temperature. Avoid placing the plate under direct light.Add 100 μL of stop solution to each well.Measure the optical density of each well using a microplate reader under dual-wavelength set at 450/570 nm."
