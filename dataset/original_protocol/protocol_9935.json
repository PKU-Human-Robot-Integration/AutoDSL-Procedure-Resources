    "NOTE: All steps can be completed in general lab space.\n1. Glass coverslip cleaning\nTo provide a clean surface for evaporative deposition of colloidal particles, place 24 x 30 mm optical borosilicate glass coverslips (0.16−0.19 mm thickness) within the grooved inserts of a coplin glass staining jar for cleaning.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the coverslips stand upright and are well-separated so that all surfaces are clearly exposed during the cleaning process.\nPour enough acetone in the staining jar to cover the coverslips, place the cover on, and sonicate for 10 min at 40 °C.\nPour out the acetone and rinse the coverslips by filling the staining jar with distilled H2O and pouring out the water. Repeat 2 more times.\nRepeat the acetone sonication (steps 1.2 and 1.3) once more.\nPour enough 200 mM KOH in the jar to cover the coverslips and sonicate, covered, for 20 min at 40 °C.\n\tNOTE: The KOH slightly etches the glass.\nRinse the coverslips with distilled H2O 6 times.\nAdd ethanol to cover the coverslips, add the lid, and sonicate for 10 min at 40 °C.\nRinse the coverslips with distilled H2O 3 times.\nPick up each coverslip at the edge using gentle forceps and dry the coverslips with N2 gas. Touch only the edges of the coverslip. Place each of the dried, cleaned coverslips in an individual clean Petri dish.\n2. Evaporative deposition of polystyrene beads\nTo create the colloidal crystal mask for the ZMW array, centrifuge 50 µL of 1 µm diameter, non-functionalized polystyrene beads (2.5% w/v in water) at 15,000 x g, 25 °C for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Before pipetting the beads, the stock solution should be briefly vortexed in case the beads have settled to the bottom of the bottle.\nDiscard the supernatant, leaving as little water remaining as possible.",
    "NOTE: Residual water can change the evaporation properties of the ethanol resuspension39, so removal of a small amount of beads in order to remove all of the water is acceptable.\nResuspend the beads from step 2.2 in 50 µL of 1:400 TritonX-100:ethanol solvent. Pipette up and down several times to thoroughly mix the beads with the solvent.\n\tNOTE: TritonX-100:ethanol solvent should be sealed with paraffin film after use and prepared fresh once a month. The beads tend to adhere to the sides of a plastic vessel, such as a microcentrifuge tube, so pipette along the sides to ensure that all beads are resuspended.\nTo set up a humidity chamber for deposition, place 6 Petri dishes, each with one coverslip, on a bench in a line with lids left slightly ajar. In each dish, move the coverslip to the open region so that the coverslips are exposed to the environment when the humidity is increased in the next step.\nPlace a hygrometer and a small electric fan centered behind the Petri dishes.\nRecord the starting relative humidity (RH) in the lab. Fill a 200 mL beaker with 150−200 mL of ~75 °C water and place it behind the fan.\nTurn on the fan and cover the Petri dishes, fan, beaker, and hygrometer with an overturned, transparent plastic storage container (66 cm x 46 cm x 38 cm).\nLet the RH in the chamber rise to 70−75%, which typically takes 5−10 min.\n\tNOTE: If the ambient lab RH is low (below ~50%), let the chamber reach a higher RH, but no higher than 80%, to compensate for loss of humidity during deposition (see below).",
    "When the RH reaches 70−75%, record the RH and lift up the plastic storage container slightly to quickly place covers on the Petri dishes, which prevents over-wetting of the coverslips.\n\tNOTE: The temperature in the chamber will be slightly warmer than room temperature, typically 25−26 °C, as a result of humidification. If moisture is visible on the coverslips, then the glass surfaces are too wet. A commercial glove box might simplify this part of the protocol.\nLet the RH in the chamber continue to rise to 85%. At that point, record the RH in the humidity chamber and pipette 5 µL of the bead suspension onto the center of each coverslip.\nClose the chamber and Petri dishes after each deposition to minimize loss of humidity. Aim to finish all 6 depositions within 2 min.\nRecord the RH in the chamber after the deposition.\n\tNOTE: The RH after deposition will help gauge how fast humidity was lost during deposition, which depends on ambient lab conditions. For a typical successful run, the chamber will start at 85% RH prior to deposition and end at 70−75% RH after the deposition.\nLet the bead droplets spread and dry for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: If the colloidal crystals have many holes or multilayered regions, then the chamber was likely too humid or dry, respectively. Adjust the relative humidity at which to close the Petri dishes and begin the depositions (see the results section for further discussion of optimization).\n3. Bead annealing for reducing pore size in the colloidal crystal template\nTo provide a uniform temperature surface for annealing of the polystyrene beads, which narrows the inter-bead interstices and rounds the interstices’ corners, place a flat, milled aluminum plate on top of a standard ceramic hot plate.",
    "Set the temperature of the hot plate to 107 °C, the glass transition temperature of polystyrene40.\n\tNOTE: To obtain stable and accurate temperature, a thermocouple probe was held in a 2−3 mm wide and 4−5 mm deep hole in the aluminum plate.\nPlace a coverslip containing the bead template on the hot aluminum plate and anneal for 20 s (see the discussion section for explanation of melting time).\nAfter heating, remove the coverslip from the aluminum plate and promptly place it on another room temperature aluminum surface to cool it.\n\tNOTE: It is helpful to either have the coverslips hang slightly over the edge of the plate or mill shallow channels (see the accompanying video) into the plate to facilitate pickup of the coverslips.\n4. Nanofabrication of aluminum zero mode waveguides using the colloidal crystal template\nUsing thermal or electron-beam evaporative deposition, deposit 300 nm of copper at 2 Å/s over the colloidal crystal template to generate posts in the interstices between the beads.\nRemove excess metal on top of the beads by gently pressing the surface with tape. Slowly peel the tape to pull off the metal.\n\tNOTE: Some small patches of reflective excess metal may remain after the tape pull, and these can often be removed by a stream of N2 gas. If substantial patches of reflective excess metal remain after the tape pull, try soaking the templates in toluene for 2 h to partially dissolve the polystyrene beads. Wash the coverslips with distilled water, dry with N2, and repeat the tape pull. The additional soak should not completely dissolve the beads, as the beads help protect the posts from damage during the tape pull.\nTo dissolve the polystyrene beads, place the bead templates in toluene and soak overnight.",
    "CAUTION: Toluene fumes may be toxic. Work with toluene under a well-ventilated hood and wear personal protective equipment, including gloves, safety glasses, and a lab coat. Toluene should be stored in ventilated cabinets designated for flammable liquids.\nAfter the toluene incubation, rinse the templates once with chloroform and twice with ethanol. Handle coverslips carefully at this point because the delicate 200−300 nm tall metal posts are now exposed. Dry the templates with N2 and remove residual polymer and contaminants in an oxygen plasma cleaner for 30 min.\n\tCAUTION: Chloroform fumes may be toxic. Work with chloroform under a well-ventilated hood and wear personal protective equipment, including gloves, safety glasses, and a lab coat. Chloroform should be stored in ventilated cabinets away from other flammable solvents.\nUsing thermal or electron-beam evaporative deposition, deposit 3 nm of a titanium adhesion layer at 1 Å/s followed by 100−150 nm of aluminum at 4 Å/s around and on top of the copper posts.\n\tNOTE: One can use thicker cladding to obtain deeper guides and better attenuation of background fluorescence, but this also decreases the yield after exposing and dissolving the posts in the next step (see the discussion section).\nTo dissolve the metal posts, soak the coverslips in copper etchant (citric acid-based; Table of Materials) for 2 h.\n\tCAUTION: Metal etchant can cause skin burns. Work with etchants under a well-ventilated hood and wear protective equipment. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Metal etchant should be stored in ventilated cabinets designated for corrosive liquids.",
    "Rinse the coverslips with distilled water, dry with N2, and gently buff the surface of the metal cladding with lens paper to expose any posts that are still covered in cladding. Place the coverslips back in copper etchant for another 2 h, then rinse again with distilled water and dry with N2.\n\tNOTE: ZMW slides should be stored in covered, clean Petri dishes to keep them free of contaminants.\n5. Nanofabrication of gold zero mode waveguides using the colloidal crystal template\nNOTE: The method to fabricate gold ZMWs (Supplemental Figure 1), which mirrors the protocol to fabricate aluminum ZMWs, is provided in this section.\nUsing thermal or electron beam evaporative deposition, deposit 3 nm of a titanium adhesion layer at 1 Å/s followed by 300 nm of aluminum at 4 Å/s.\nRemove excess metal on top of the beads by gently pressing the surface with tape. Slowly peel the tape to pull off the metal.\nTo dissolve the polystyrene beads, place the bead templates in toluene and soak overnight.\nAfter the toluene incubation, rinse the templates once with chloroform and twice with ethanol. Dry the templates with N2 and remove residual polymer contaminants in an oxygen plasma cleaner for 30 min.\nUsing thermal or electron beam evaporative deposition, deposit 100−150 nm of gold at 5 Å/s around and on top of the aluminum posts.\nTo dissolve the metal posts, soak the coverslips in aluminum etchant (phosphoric acid-based; Table of Materials) for 1 h.\nRinse the coverslips with distilled water, dry with N2, and gently buff the surface of the metal cladding with lens paper to expose any posts that are still covered in cladding. Place the coverslips back in aluminum etchant for 1 h, then rinse again with distilled water and dry with N2.",
