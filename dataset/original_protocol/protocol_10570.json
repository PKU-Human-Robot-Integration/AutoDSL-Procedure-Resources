    "1. Spinning Dope Preparation\nPrepare a range of biopolymer concentrations to be investigated (0.1% to 30%, w/v) and be sure to consider moisture content of the biopolymer powder in these calculations. For each concentration, weigh the biopolymer (starch or pullulan) powder into a 50 ml test tube. Add aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution and a stir bar.\nPlace the tube into boiling water with constant stirring on a magnetic stirrer hotplate.\nAfter about 1 hr, turn off heat and allow the dispersion to cool to room temperature. The dispersion is then ready for rheological testing and electrospinning.\n2. Steady Shear Rheology\nWarm up the rheometer and set the stage temperature at 20 °C. Calibrate the gap between the probe (25 mm cone used) and the stage (plate).\nLoad 0.41 ml of the biopolymer dispersion onto the center of the stage and lower the probe to set the position (0.053 mm gap for 25 mm cone). Make sure that the dispersion evenly spreads within the gap.\nPerform the rheological test with the following experimental parameters: sweep mode: log, initial rate: 100 sec-1, final rate: 0.1 sec-1, points per decade: 10, delay before measure: 5 sec, measure time: 10 sec, and directions per measure: two (both clockwise and counterclockwise).\nAnalyze rheological data to estimate appropriate dispersion concentrations for electrospinning trials.\n\t\nPlot apparent shear viscosities against shear rates as a function of polymer concentrations. For each flow curve, approximate zero shear viscosities, η0, by the actual or extrapolated values (e.g., at low concentrations where the low shear rate data are unreliable) for apparent viscosity at 0.1 sec−1.\nCalculate specific viscosity: ηsp = (η0− ηs)/ηs, where ηs is the viscosity of the solvent.",
    "Plot specific viscosities as a function of concentration. Identify semidilute unentangled and entangled regimes. The semidilute unentangled regime begins from the low concentration end with a small slope, and the semidilute entangled regime has a greater slope following the unentangled regime. Fit power-law regression models in both regimes. The power values are the slopes (concentration dependence) in semidilute unentangled and entangled regimes on a log-log plot. The intersection of the two fitted lines is the entanglement concentration, ce.\n3. Electrospinning Parameter Variation\nAssemble the electrospinning setup as shown in Figure 1. Load the syringe with dispersion of appropriate composition, e.g., 15% (w/v) starch or pullulan in 100% DMSO, onto the syringe pump. Clip the high voltage wire (positive) to the needle. Connect the coagulation bath containing pure ethanol to ground by immersing the ground wire (negative) into the bath. Use a lab jack to adjust the distance between the syringe needle and coagulation bath. Immerse a metal mesh in the bath to collect the fiber mat after electrospinning.\nSpin the biopolymer in the following parameter ranges: feed rate from 0.1 to 0.4 ml/hr, spinning distance from 5 to 10 cm, and voltage from 0 to 15 kV.\n\t\nStart with a spinning distance of 5 cm. For the first feed rate (0.1 ml/hr), ramp the voltage up slowly from 0 V. Pay attention to the shape of the dispersion extruded at the needle tip and note when the dripping dispersion is accelerated and then elongated.\nNote the voltage at which a tiny jet initiated from the drop surface, indicating electrospinnability of the solution. Record the voltage at which a continuous jet initiates, if any.",
    "Examine the complete range for each of the three parameters and note successful spinning conditions. Collect the fibers only when there is a continuous jet from the tip.\nAfter a few minutes of collecting, rinse the fiber mat with pure ethanol. Place the fiber mat into a desiccator containing desiccant under vacuum.\nRepeat for each biopolymer concentration for complete characterization.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51933/51933fig1highres.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic drawing of the electro-wet-spinning setup. The biopolymer dispersion is extruded from a syringe pump. A high voltage DC power supply provides high voltage to the blunt needle and grounds the coagulation bath. The polymer jet from the needle tip travels through a straight path and then develops a rapid whipping path (aka whipping instability).\n4. Morphological Characterization\nCut a piece of dried fiber mat and immobilize it onto a SEM stub using carbon tape.\nLoad the sample stub into the SEM instrument and obtain images for analysis.\nSubscription Required.
