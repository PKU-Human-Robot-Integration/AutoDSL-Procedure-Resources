    "All animal experiments described follow the guidelines set forth in the National Academies of Sciences' Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were reviewed and approved by the University of Florida's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Follow all applicable rules and regulations when engaging in animal subject research.\n1. Preparation of Perfusate for the Maintenance of Central Nervous System Tissues\nMake fresh artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF).\nTo generate 2 L of bicarbonate-buffered aCSF perfusate, measure out 1,500 mL of water purified by double distillation or reverse osmosis into a 4 L flask. Place a magnetic stir bar in the flask and agitate the liquid using a stir plate.\nInto the purified water, dissolve the following quantities of salts: 14.03 g (120 mM) sodium chloride, 4.37 g (26 mM) sodium bicarbonate, 0.41 g (1.5 mM) monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.69 g (1.4 mM) magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.59 g (2 mM) calcium chloride dihydrate, 0.45 g (3 mM) potassium chloride, and 3.6 g (10 mM) glucose.\n\t\tNOTE: The chemical contents of the perfusate will differ depending on the specific metabolic requirements of the tissue and the desired conditions of the experiment.\nMix this solution thoroughly until all salts have dissolved. Adjust volume to 2 L using additional purified water.\nTest the osmolality of the aCSF using a freezing point depression osmometer. Adjust to 300 mOsm/kg using sorbitol. Addition of 324 mg sorbitol to 2 L of 299 mOsm/kg aCSF perfusate will increase osmolality to 300 mOsm/kg (approximately 1 mOsm per 324mg).\n\t\tNOTE: The aCSF can be stored at 4 °C in an air-tight, sealed bottle for a period not to exceed 24 h.\n2. Set Up the Perfusion System\nPrepare the aCSF perfusate.",
    "Equilibrate aCSF to ambient temperature (~23 °C) while gassing with 95% carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2; 1/16 L/min) via direct bubbling for no less than 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Different tissue types or desired experimental conditions may require adjustment of the perfusate temperature or gas contents. The desired conditions for dissolved gas content in the perfusate can be controlled precisely by varying the percent concentrations of individual components of the supply gas (Figure 1).\nOnce the aCSF reaches the required temperature and carbogen saturation, confirm that the pH is in the physiological range (7.3 - 7.4). Continue to bubble gas directly into the perfusate reservoir (1/16 L/min) throughout the course of experiment in order to maintain proper dissolved oxygen content and pH conditions conducive to healthy tissue metabolism.\nPrime the perfusion lines.\nSubmerge the inlet tube connected to the peristaltic micro-pump into the prepared aCSF (300 mOsm, pH 7.3 - 7.4, continuously gassed).\nPass the oxygenator device (Figure 2) and perfusion lines through both the magnet bore and gradient coil stack (top to bottom) and set the coils aside until probe assembly. Hang the oxygenator above a beaker to catch any aCSF effluent.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the MRI system design, perfusion lines may need to be passed through the magnet bore and gradient coils or probe body base prior to priming the system with aCSF. Confirm that perfusion line placement will not interfere with the assembly of the probe body or insertion of the probe into the bore before beginning the priming procedure.\nConfirm the intended flow rate (2 mL/min) is selected and begin filling the perfusion lines by switching on the pump.\nInvert the empty, in-line bubble trap so that aCSF will displace the air contained inside.",
    "Connect the oxygenator's gas port to a second source of carbogen (either a manifold or a secondary carbogen cylinder) and set a flow rate of 1/16L/min.\nConfirm that carbogen is flowing over the oxygenator's gas-exchange membrane by dipping the exhaust port on top of the oxygenator into water.\nOnce aCSF is detected dripping from the perfusion chamber, purge any visible gas bubbles from the inflow lines by manual agitation.\nConfirm the oxygenator is operating correctly by submerging the oxygen electrode in the aCSF flowing from the perfusion chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: The reading on the oxygen meter should approximate the percentage of oxygen contained within the supplied gas.\n3. Tissue Preparation\nEuthanasia\nPlace a rat (125 - 150 g) into the induction chamber of an anesthesia machine and expose to 4% isoflurane in an oxygen carrier gas at a rate of 1 L/min for 4 min.\nRemove the unconscious rat from the anesthesia chamber.\nPerform a righting reflex test by placing the rat in the supine position. Check for any movements—head turning, leg lifting, spine flexing, etc.—indicative that the animal is turning onto its stomach.\nPerform an eye-blink reflexive test by touching the open eye of the animal using a cotton swab. Check for any response—lid closure, muscle twitching, etc.—to this sensory input.\nLastly, perform a limb-withdraw reflex test by pinching the skin between the toes of the rat's outstretched back leg using tweezers or hemostats. Check for flexion of the leg.\n\t\tNOTE: In the case of a positive reflexive test result, do not proceed with euthanasia.\nIn the event that any of the three reflex tests elicits a response, return the rat immediately to the anesthesia chamber and allow for an additional 2 min of exposure to 4% isoflurane.",
    "Perform all three reflexive tests over in their entirety. Repeat the 2 min anesthesia exposure as necessary and only proceed once a complete lack of response to all three reflexive tests has been observed.\nEuthanize the rat via guillotine decapitation.\nBrain resection\nRemove rat brain by gross dissection. Start with the head in the prone position. Using scissors, cut rostrally through the skin from the back of the neck to the nose and expose the skull.\nRemove soft tissues from the surface of the skull with a blunt probe.\nWorking from the caudal end, remove the occipital, parietal, and frontal bones of the cranium using rongeurs.\nRetract the dura by cutting along the longitudinal fissure with micro scissors and peeling back the layer from both hemispheres.\nRemove the brain from the skull by turning the head to the supine position and severing the cranial nerves on the ventral side.\nSlice isolation\nReturn the brain to the prone position and isolate the central portion containing the hippocampus by removing all tissues caudal to the transverse fissure and rostral to the fimbria. Make two cuts along the transverse plane (i.e. coronal slices) with a straight-edged razor.\nAffix the brain's caudal-most plane to the center of a vibratome cutting bath using cyanoacrylate glue.\nAdd ice-cold, carbogen bubbled aCSF to the vibratome cutting bath and place the nylon retention hardware inside.\nCut 300 μm thick slices to obtain 3 to 4 usable slice preparations per hemisphere (6 to 8 total).\nIsolate a hippocampus or cortical section from one hemisphere and trim the slice so that it fits within the microcoil's 5 mm diameter tissue well.\n4. Sample Positioning and Perfusion System Assembly\nCoil preparation\nFill the microcoil's tissue chamber with oxygenated aCSF from the vibratome's cutting bath using a transfer pipette.",
    "Take the trimmed brain sample and position the region of interest (eg. pyramidal cell layer) over the microcoil using a dissecting scope.\nInsert the tissue retention device (nylon mesh net affixed to nylon washer) to retain sample position throughout the imaging experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Proceed quickly through the sample positioning procedure to minimize exposure to intense light. Provide additional oxygenated aCSF as needed using a transfer pipette.\nAssembling the in-bore oxygenator, microcoil and probe\nSecure the modified microcoil assembly (Figure 3) in a table clamp and affix the in-bore oxygenator device by inserting the acetal support peg into the hole on top of the coil.\nSeal the perfusion system by placing the perfusion chamber over the microcoil's tissue well and cinching the two together using a miniature cable tie.\nTrim the excess length from the cable tie using wire cutters.\n\t\tNOTE: Upon successful sealing, perfusate should be observed exiting through the outflow lines and no leakage should be evident around the silicone seal of the perfusion chamber. Failure to confirm these conditions prior to probe assembly could result in serious damage to imaging hardware.\nOnce aCSF can be seen dripping into the waste reservoir, take the microcoil and oxygenator and attach the assembly to the top of the imaging probe body.\nSlide the gradient stack over the assembly and seat the gradient on top of the probe. Photographs detailing the relative placement and proper connection of coil, oxygenator and probe hardware components are provided (Figure 4).\n5. Performing the MR Image Collection\nInserting the assembled probe into the magnet bore\nPlace the probe body in close proximity to the spectrometer bore opening at the bottom of the magnet.\nRetract the excess length of perfusion lines through the bore opening at the top of the magnet.",
    "Once all of the available slack has been taken up from the perfusion lines, advance the probe body into the magnet bore at the base while simultaneously removing more slack from the perfusion lines from the top of the bore.\nThread the two securing screws at the base of the probe into the corresponding slots of the shim stack.\nBefore proceeding, check that perfusion lines were not pinched or kinked during probe insertion by confirming aCSF outflow into the waste reservoir.\n\t\tNOTE: Failure to confirm perfusate outflow can result in permanent damage to perfusion lines and risks catastrophic damage to MR imaging hardware.\nIn the event no perfusate is seen exiting the return line into the waste reservoir, remove the probe body and confirm that perfusate flow has recommenced prior to attempting reinsertion. A schematic layout of the assembled perfusion system and imaging spectrometer has been described previously8.\nConnecting the Probe Body\nAttach the inflow and outflow water lines from the gradient chiller.\nTurn on the pump for gradient chiller and confirm the water temperature setting (19 °C).\nAttach the air hose from the air chiller unit to the probe body using a hose clamp.\nTurn the flow knob on the air chiller unit to the \"1\" position.\nAttach the thermocouple wire to the probe body.\nAttach the coaxial cable from the preamp to the radio frequency (RF) input/output on the probe body's proton (H) channel.\nAttach the power cable from the gradient amplifiers to the probe body.\nInside the RF cabinet, turn on the power to the B0 compensation unit, all three gradient amplifiers (x,y,z), and the master unit.\nPreparing the Spectrometer\nSet the intended bore temperature using the variable temperature adjustment module at the console.",
    "Match (impedance) and tune (frequency) the RF circuit by adjusting the variable capacitors within the probe. This is accomplished by manipulating the wands at the base of the probe body.\nAdjust the current settings for the spectrometer's shim coils to maximize the magnetic field homogeneity at the sample.\nBegin Image Collection\nCollect pilot images to determine the spatial position of your sample within the magnet bore. Typical parameters for a two dimensional gradient echo are as follows (TR/TE = 100/4 ms, averages = 1, pulse angle = 30o, time = 6 sec, matrix = 64 x 64, field of view = 0.3 x 0.3 cm, resolution = 47 x 47 μm).\nCollect diffusion-weighted pilots in order to confirm proper scan geometry and tissue position if applicable. Typical parameters for a two dimensional diffusion-weighted pilot scan are as follows (TR/TE = 2000/11.6 ms, time = 4.3 min, Δ = 6 ms, δ = 1 ms, averages = 1, b = 1200 (1860 effective) s/mm2, matrix = 64 x 64, field of view = 0.2 x 0.2 cm, resolution = 31 μm).\nCollect a diffusion-weighted time series to determine the stability characteristics of the acute slice preparation. Typical parameters for a two dimensional diffusion weighted image are as follows (TR/TE = 2000/11.6 ms, time = 1.5 h, Δ = 6 ms, δ = 1 ms, averages = 42, b = 1200 s/mm2, matrix = 64 x 64, field of view = 0.2 x 0.2 cm, resolution = 31 μm). Note: Characterizing stability in a given system will vary from the described protocol depending on factors such as the MR contrast employed (e.g. T1,T2, diffusion, susceptibility), the physical perturbation studied, and the MR signal change per unit time resulting from said perturbation."
