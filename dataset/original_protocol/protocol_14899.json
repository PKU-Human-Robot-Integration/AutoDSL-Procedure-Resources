  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All experimental procedures described in this section were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Project: 154/2013-B De Geest).\n1. Permanent Ligation of the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal administration of 40 mg/kg to 70 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital. Ensure the mouse reaches its proper plane of anesthesia when it no longer reacts a firm toe pinch. Always confirm proper anesthetization this way prior to any surgical procedure or intervention. Use lubricating ophthalmic ointment to prevent dryness of the cornea while under anesthesia. Provide preoperative analgesia 2-4 hr before the start of the procedure (buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg SQ).\n\t\nApply consistent aseptic techniques during survival surgery. Implement procedures that inhibit to a maximally possible extent microbial contamination so that significant infection or suppuration does not occur. These procedures include use of sterile instruments and sterile materials, disinfection of the surgical area, and removal of fur/hair over the surgical site and disinfection of this site.\nIntubate the mouse with a self-prepared blunted 20-gauge needle.\n\t\nPut the mouse in supine position with hyperextension of the head.\n\t\t\nFocus the light on the neck region. Lift the tongue with a blunted pincet. The entrance of the larynx can be clearly seen.\nPass the blunted needle through the larynx into the trachea under direct vision. Assess correct intubation by connecting the mouse to the ventilator (stroke volume in µl: 3 x body weight (g) + 155; frequency: 120 strokes per min).\nAlternatively, enhance visualization of endotracheal intubation by first carefully exposing the trachea.\n\t\t\nMake a 5 mm mid-neck incision and retract muscle tissue just above the trachea.",
    "Perform the intubation using a surgical stereomicroscope for direct visualization of the trachea. Lift the tongue and enter the self-prepared blunted 20 gauge needle into the trachea. Confirm correct intubation by connecting the mouse to the ventilator (stroke volume in µl: 3 x body weight (g) + 155; frequency: 120 strokes per min).\nKeep the mouse in supine position and fix the mouse with tape. Perform surgery on a heating pad to prevent hypothermia.\n\t\nShave and disinfect the skin with Betadine. Take care that the left hind limb crosses the right hind limb in order to obtain a better view on the left ventricle during surgery.\nMake a small transverse cutaneous incision up to the sternum and separate the underlying skin and muscles.\nPull aside the m. pectoralis minor and m. pectoralis major with a 5-0 silk suture.\nMake an incision in the third intercostal space by inserting a blunted pincet.\nMove the pincet under the intercostal muscles from lateral to medial till the sternum is reached. Puncture the thoracic wall by pushing the pincet from inside to the skin. Complete the thoracotomy by carefully cutting the intercostal muscle just above the pincet with a small scissor. Use this technique to prevent puncturing of the lungs.\nPut a sponge immersed in 0.9% NaCl into the cavity to protect the lungs. Introduce a wound spreader (chest retractor) into the intercostal space to obtain exposure of the left side of the heart. As of now, the left atrium, the left ventricle, and the left anterior descending coronary artery are visible under the stereomicroscope.\nPerform a ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery with a single 6-0 prolene ligature about 1 mm under the tip of the left atrium. This is distal from the first diagonal branch.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, 7-0 (0.05 mm diameter) or 8-0 threads (0.04 mm diameter) may be used. The needle is a C-1 13 mm 3/8 circle Taper Point needle. Successful ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery induces immediate discoloration, resulting in a pale appearing myocardium in the affected territory.\nRemove the wound spreader (chest retractor).\n\t\nPlace three 6-0 Ti-Cron sutures around the intercostal space. Before tightening the sutures, remove the sponge from the chest cavity and re-expand the lungs by blocking the outflow of the ventilator. By doing so, the lungs reconnect with the parietal pleura.\nSubsequently, pull the sutures tight and repeat re-expansion by pressing down on the chest. Confirm the successful closure of the thorax using a small amount of saline (no air bubbles must be seen when applying pressure on the chest).\nLook through the intercostal muscle to confirm normal expansion of the lungs. Reposition both pectoralis muscles, serving as an extra barrier for prevention of a pneumothorax.\nClose the skin with 5-0 silk-sutures.\nDisconnect the mouse from the ventilator and allow recovery on the heating pad. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nConsistently provide postoperative analgesia (buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg SQ BID for at least 48 hr after surgery). \n2. In vivo Invasive Hemodynamic Measurements in Mice\nBefore the procedure, submerge the 1.0 French Millar pressure catheter in sterile water at 37 °C for at least 30 min to minimize signal drift. Electronically calibrate the pressure sensor at 0 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg and record data at 2,000 Hz.",
    "Perform anesthesia by intraperitoneal administration of 1.4 g/kg urethane. Check that the mouse reaches its proper plane of anesthesia when it no longer reacts a firm toe pinch.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse in supine position. Secure its limbs with tape. Maintain body temperature with a heating pad and monitor with a rectal probe. Shave the neck region and make a midline incision in the neck region to expose the thyroid gland.\nFix the neck with bent needles.\nPull aside the salivary gland and expose the right common carotid artery. The vagus nerve, which resembles a white thread, lies along the artery. Carefully separate the carotid artery from the vagus nerve using a curved forceps.\nPass a curved forceps under the right common carotid artery to separate it from other tissues. Remove connective tissue around the artery.\nPass two 6-0 silk wires under the right common carotid artery. Make a tight knot on the top wire, which is placed towards the head, close, and fix with a kocher (distal occlusive ligation). Pass the proximal wire twice from left to right and fix with 2 kochers (proximal non-occlusive wire).\nKeep the carotid artery moist by dropping sterile 0.9% NaCl. Dry off excess liquid with cotton buds.\nMake an incision in the right common carotid artery with a 26-gauge needle between the distal ligation and the proximal non-occlusive wire.\nIntroduce the pressure sensor into the artery. Verify that there is no blood loss. Gently push the 1.0 French Millar pressure catheter forward and adjust the proximal non-occlusive wire in such a way that the catheter can pass carefully through the wire under the clavicle.",
    "Minimize blood loss during adjustment of the proximal non-occlusive wire. Do not compress the pressure sensor too much while advancing since it is very fragile. Since the proximal wire must not occlude the artery, the vessel should remain filled with blood.\nStart recording the pressure signal. An arterial pressure signal fluctuates in a healthy mouse between a diastolic pressure of 60 - 70 mm Hg and a systolic pressure of 100 - 120 mm Hg.\nDirect the catheter via the innominate artery and via the aorta into the left ventricle. The ventricular pressure fluctuates between 0 mm Hg and 100 - 120 mm Hg. Allow the catheter to stabilise inside the left ventricle. Record the signal for 30 min to 60 min depending on the experimental requirements.\nAfter completion of the experiment, soak the catheter in Alconox 1% for 30 min. Wash the catheter with Milli-Q water. Store the catheter in a foam block.\nRetrieve data from the recording software for further analysis.\n\t\nFor data analysis, consider a time interval where the pressure signal is stable. Choose at least 10 consecutive cardiac cycles of the recorded data of interest.\nUse LabChart software version 8.0 or similar to analyse the heart rate, the maximal systolic left ventricular pressure, the minimal diastolic left ventricular pressure, the peak rate of isovolumetric left ventricular contraction (dP/dtmax), the peak rate of isovolumetric left ventricular relaxation (dP/dtmin), the end-diastolic left ventricular pressure, and the time constant of the isovolumetric left ventricular pressure fall (tau)7.",
    "NOTE: The end-diastolic pressure corresponds to the pressure at the time-point immediately before the pressure surge induced by isovolumetric contraction. The calculation of tau is based on fitting the left ventricular pressure into a monoexponential decay curve, expressed as P(t)=P0e-t/tau + b, In this formula, P(t) is the left ventricular pressure at time t after the maximal negative value of dP/dt has been reached. The parameter b corresponds to the theoretical asymptote, which in a simplified approach can be assumed to be zero. Enhanced isovolumetric relaxation results in a smaller value of tau.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
