    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMembrane preparation and solubilization—Day 1\nTiming: 5–7 h\nATP synthases are membrane complexes. In Synechocystis 6803, the ATPase locates mainly to the thylakoid membrane. Therefore, preparation and solubilization of the membrane fraction is an important initiation step for the purification of ATPase.\nResuspend the collected Synechocystis 6803 cells with buffer A (Store at 4°C for up to 1 month; take 10 mL buffer A for 5 OD of cells), break cells using Precellys 24 homogenizer with 6 cycles of 25 s at 6,000 rpm in the presence of glass beads.\nNote: We use a bead volume of approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the resuspension volume.\nNote: The following steps should be kept at 4°C or on ice, unless specifically mentioned.\nAlternatives: Cells can be lysed via multiple methods, including lysis by mechanical vibration as in the Precellys 24 or Retsch homogenizer (Retsch GmbH), as well as high pressure cell disruptors.\nAlternatives: cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor used in this protocol can be replaced by other protease inhibitors, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).\nCentrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, then remove the pellet fraction including unbroken cells, cell debris, and beads.\nCentrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h, remove the supernatant, and keep the pellet fraction which is the crude membranes.\nOptional: To increase the purity of the collected membranes, the collected membranes can be washed for 1–2 times using buffer A, by first re-suspend the pellet from step 3, then repeat step 3. This can further remove soluble proteins and avoid unspecific binding as much as possible.\nPause point: The membrane pellet can be stored at −80°C (better less than 1 month). Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.",
    "Re-suspend the collected membrane pellet thoroughly using FLAG buffer (Store at −20°C), and incubate on ice for 0.5–1 h to solubilize the membranes.\nNote: Brief gentle vortexing may help but we didn’t test this.\nMeasure the protein concentration of the membrane solution, and adjust the protein concentration to 5–10 mg/mL with FLAG buffer.\nNote: For measuring the protein concentration, here the Coomassie Plus Bradford assay was used.\nAlternatives: Other assays such as the Pierce BCA protein assay may be suitable as well for protein quantification.\nNote: Adjustment of the protein concentration is important for sufficient solubilization of the membranes.\nSlowly add dodecylmaltoside (DDM) to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) from freshly prepared 10% DDM solution in water, incubate for 1 h with gentle agitation to solubilize the membrane.\nCentrifuge the membrane solution at 20,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble debris, and filter the resulting supernatant through 0.45 μm membrane.\nOptional: Depending on the actual volume, the filtered solution can be concentrated at this step, to give a proper volume for further flag tag affinity chromatography. Higher protein concentration can lead to better binding efficiency, and save time if several loading rounds are desired to obtain higher product amounts. We used 100 KDa cutoff Amicon Ultra-2, Merck Millipore ultra-centrifugal filters to concentrate the solution from 5 OD of cells to 10 mL volume.\nPause point: The solubilized fraction can be stored at 4°C for up to 12 h, or at −80°C for longer periods (better less than 1 month). The protein complexes are more fragile without intact membrane, therefore freeze-thaw cycles are not recommended here.\nFLAG-tag based affinity chromatography—Day 2\nTiming: 2–4 h",
    "The affinity chromatography based on flag tag and anti-FLAG beads can be used to isolate FLAG-tagged proteins/protein complexes at small scale (for co-immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectrometry analysis) or larger scale (for biochemistry analysis). Here the anti-FLAG agarose beads were used; the anti-FLAG magnetic beads can also be used, with similar purity. The protocol described here can be applied for co-immunoprecipitation with slight modifications, which will be described in notes.\nPreparation of Anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma-Aldrich CAT#A2220; for this step, one can also refer to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/DE/en/technical-documents/technical-article/protein-biology/protein-purification/anti-flag-m2-magnetic-beads]).\nRe-suspend the affinity resin thoroughly, and transfer appropriate amount of resin into a clean, empty chromatography column (for 5 OD of Synechocystis 6803 cells, 1 mL of resin is recommended).\nDrain the gel bed naturally, followed by washing using three sequential column volumes (CV) of 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 3.5) (do not leave the resin in glycine-HCl for longer than 20 min).\nWash the resin with 5 CV of FLAG buffer to equilibrate the resin, and the resin is then ready for use.\nCritical: No extra pressures other than the gravity are recommended during preparation of affinity resins, as well as during following chromatography steps; this can promote the formation of channels, ensure sufficient contact between solutions and resins, and avoid bubbles. Also, like other resins, the gel bed should always be kept wet.\nLoad the membrane lysate onto the prepared column under gravity flow; the flow through membrane lysate sample are reloaded twice to increase binding.\nNote: Repeated loading is especially important for co-immunoprecipitation assay.\nOptional: Repeat the loading-washing-elution procedure if you have limited bed volume but want to accumulate more proteins.\nSufficiently wash the column with 5–15 times of 2 CV of FLAG buffer 2 [FLAG buffer supplemented with 0.03% (w/v) DDM; prepare before use].",
    "Critical: The washing step 10 is very important for the purity of the final product. Here, 0.03% (w/v) DDM was added to the FLAG buffer, in order to remove lipids from the purified ATPase, and to increase the solubility of intact ATPase complex. Also, the buffer volume used for washing should be sufficient; in the case of FLAG-tagged ATPase, ten times of 2 CV of washing buffer, which is the highest volume recommended in the manufacture’s instruction, still resulted in quite high amounts of unspecific proteins as indicated by SDS-PAGE; these unspecific proteins became mostly undetectable when 15 times of 2 CV washing buffer was used.\nNote: The additional supplementation of 0.03% (w/v) DDM is not necessary for the purification of non-membrane embedded proteins, or for co-immunoprecipitation assays in which no membrane-located protein interaction partners are expected.\nElute the FLAG-tagged ATPase with 2 times of 1.5 CV of FLAG buffer 2 supplemented with 150 μg/mL 3×FLAG peptide.\nAlternatives: The resulting eluate can be further concentrated using 100 KDa cutoff ultra-centrifugal filter; this can not only remove most of the 3×FLAG peptide and overexpressed ATPase subunit, but also allow the changing of buffer.\nAlternatives: The elution step 11 can be performed at a temperature of about 22°C–25°C, with eluted samples kept on ice.\nNote: Instead of FLAG buffer 2 containing 3×FLAG peptide, 0.1 M glycine HCl (pH 3.5) can be used for the elution of FLAG-tagged proteins, but its effect on the activity of ATPase was not tested. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, both 0.1 M glycine HCl (pH 3.5) or SDS-PAGE sample buffer can be considered for elution instead of the 3×FLAG peptide used here; in that case the eluted samples can proceed directly to SDS-PAGE, followed by mass spectrometry to identify protein components.\nPurity check and following biochemical assays\nTiming: variable",
    "Before conducting any biochemistry analysis, the integrity and purity of the isolated ATPase should be checked. Generally, SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and mass spectrometry are recommended sequentially to control the quality of isolated ATPase.\nSDS-PAGE analysis of the isolated ATPase.\nNote: The molecular weight judged from SDS-PAGE is inaccurate and should only be used as reference.\nWestern blot analysis of the isolated ATPase.\nOptional: The isolated ATPase can also be checked using native PAGE such as blue-native PAGE (Wittig et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Only one band of about 400–600 kDa should be visible.\nChecking the isolated ATPase using mass spectrometry.\nNote: By this method one can be sure about the purity of the isolated ATPase, as well as the possible presence of contaminations that might interfere following biochemical assays.\nConduct biochemical assays as needed, such as the ATP hydrolysis assay described in Song et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13].\nLiquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry\nTiming: 3–5 days\nSamples were prepared using S-Trap micro filters (Protifi, Huntington, NY) following the manufacturer’s procedure[href=https://files.protifi.com/protocols/s-trap-micro-long-4-7.pdf]. Afterwards peptides were analyzed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to an EASY-nLCTM 1000 UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific). Other LC-MS/MS systems might be adequate as well but cannot be addressed here.\nSample preparation:\nSamples were mixed 1:1 with 2× SDS protein solubilization buffer (10% SDS, 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.55; store at −20°C) for a final concentration of 5% SDS.\nNote: At least 2% final concentration of SDS is necessary in order for the S-Trap to bind the proteins.\nSamples were reduced by adding 5 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride) and incubated for 10 min at 95°C.\nSamples were alkylated by adding iodacetamide to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubated for 20 min at a temperature of about 22°C–25°C in the dark.",
    "12% aqueous phosphoric acid were added at 1:10 for a final concentration of ∼1.2% phosphoric acid (e.g., 2.5 μL into 25 μL) and mixed.\nAt least 6 times the current sample volume of S-Trap protein binding buffer (90% aqueous methanol containing a final concentration of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.1; store at −20°C) were added.\nNote: Given sufficient protein amount, the solution will appear translucent.\nThe S-Trap micro column was placed in a 2 mL tube to collect the flow through. Afterwards, the acidified sample was pipetted onto the micro column.\nNote: If initial sample volume is higher than one column load, load the column multiple times until the full volume has passed the column material. Up to 100 μg protein can be loaded.\nThe micro column was centrifuged at 4,000 g until all sample has passed through the S-Trap column.\nNote: Proteins will be trapped within the protein-trapping matrix of the spin column. After each centrifugation step, make sure that all added solution has gone through the S-Trap column. Do not exceed 5,000 g with the S-Trap mini spin columns.\nCaptured protein has been washed by adding 150 μL S-Trap protein binding buffer; centrifugation was repeated. The whole washing procedure was repeated three times.\nThe S-Trap micro column with trapped sample was moved to a clean 1.5 mL low-bind sample tube for the digestion.\n20 μL of Digestion buffer (50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate) containing trypsin at 1:10–1:25 (wt:wt) were added onto the top of the micro column.\nNote: For effective digestions, do not apply less than 0.75 μg of trypsin. The protein trap is hydrophilic and will absorb the solution. Ensure there is no air bubble between the protease digestion solution and the protein trap.\nThe S-Trap column was capped to limit evaporative loss.",
    "Incubation for 1 h at 47°C.\nPeptide elution was carried out in three subsequent elution steps all into the same tube:\n40 μL of 50 mM Digestion buffer were added and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for approx. 1 min to elute peptides.\n40 μL of 0.2% aqueous formic acid were added and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for approx. 1 min to elute peptides a second time.\n35 μL of 50% acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid were added and centrifuged at 4,000 g for approx. 1 min to elute peptides a third/last time.\nThe peptide solution was completely dried in a SpeedVac. Dried peptides were resuspended in 25 μL H2O and a BCA assay performed to determine the peptide concentration.\nMS measurement and data analysis:\nOne ug of peptides was analyzed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to an EASY-nLCTM 1000 UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific). The analytical column was self-packed with silica beads coated with C18 (Reprosil Pur C18-AQ, d = 3 Â) (Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH, Ammerbusch, Germany).\nFor peptide separation, a linear gradient of increasing buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile, Fluka) was applied, ranging from 5 to 40% buffer B over the first 90 min and from 40 to 100% buffer B in the subsequent 30 min (120 min separating gradient length).",
    "Peptides were analyzed in data dependent acquisition mode (DDA). Survey scans were performed at 70,000 resolution, an AGC target of 3e6 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms followed by targeting the top 10 precursor ions for fragmentation scans at 17,500 resolution with 1.6 m/z isolation windows, an NCE of 30 and a dynamic exclusion time of 35 s. For all MS2 scans the intensity threshold was set to 1.3e5, the AGC to 1e4 and the maximum injection time to 80 ms.\nRaw data were analyzed with MaxQuant (v 1.6.14.0) allowing two missed cleavage sites, no variable modifications, carbamidomethylation of cysteines as fixed modification. The database “Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803 / Kazusa)” was downloaded from https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000001425[href=https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000001425] on Jan 29th, 2021. Only unique peptides were used for quantification using the iBAQ (Intensity Based Absolute Quantification) algorithm.\nNote: iBAQ values calculated by MaxQuant are the (raw) intensities divided by the number of theoretical tryptic peptides. Thus, iBAQ values are proportional to the molar quantities of the proteins. The iBAQ algorithm can roughly estimate the relative abundance of the proteins within each sample (Nagaraj et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Schwanhäusser et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12])."
