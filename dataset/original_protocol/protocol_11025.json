    "This protocol follows the guidelines of Mayo Clinic's Institutional Review Board (IRB), Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC A00001767), and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC, Bios00000006.04).\nNOTE: All the materials used to work with mice must be sterile.\n1. Injection of busulfan to NSG mice\nObtain male, 8-12 weeks old, immunocompromised, NOD-SCID IL2rγnull (NSG) mice, and weigh them prior to injection.\n\tNOTE: For statistical significance, it is recommended to use at least five mice per group and to repeat this experiment at least once more with female mice.\nPrepare busulfan for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Using a 1 mL insulin syringe, slowly and carefully fill the syringe with exactly 30 mg/kg of busulfan, followed by i.p injection to the mice, and place them back into the cage.\n2. Injection of ALL patient-derived blasts (CD19+) to the NSG mice\nNOTE: This protocol follows the guidelines of Mayo Clinic's Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC, Bios00000006.04).\nCollect primary leukemic blasts from the peripheral blood of patients with relapsed and refractory ALL.\nPrepare target cells for intravenous (i.v.) injection.\n\t\nCount CD19+ target cells using a hemocytometer, and record the final volume and concentration of cells.\n\t\tNOTE: To determine cell viability, it is strongly recommended to utilize trypan blue while counting the cells.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 50 × 106 cells/mL in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and place on ice.\nFinger-vortex the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the target cells until the cells are completely homogenized.\nUsing a 1 mL insulin syringe, slowly and carefully fill the syringe with exactly 100 µL of the prepared target cells, and flick the syringe to remove bubbles.",
    "NOTE: The volume of 100 µL will administer 5 × 106 cells to each mouse.\nPlace the mice under warm light for 5-10 min. Once the tail vein becomes engorged and more visible to the naked eye, place the mice in an appropriate confinement/restraining chamber.\nWipe the tail of the mouse with an alcohol swab. Inject the target cells directly into the tail vein (i.v.), and place the mouse back in the cage. After the inoculation of the target cells, monitor the mice daily or as recommended by the local animal ethics committee.\n3. Tumor engraftment assessment\nStarting at 6 weeks after the target cell injection, assess tumor engraftment by using flow cytometry to measure the expression of CD19+ cells in the peripheral blood.\nPeripheral blood assay to assess CD19+ expansion\n\t\nWithdraw blood from the mice 6-8 weeks after CART19 cell injection.\n\t\tNOTE: Several methods can be used to withdraw blood. For this protocol, submandibular blood collection is the preferred method of choice.\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane in an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane. Once anesthesia is achieved, maintain at 1-3% isoflurane inhaled through a nose cone.\n\t\tNOTE: It is strongly recommended to apply ophthalmic ointment to prevent eye dryness.\nRemove the mouse from the chamber, and hold the mouse with the non-dominant hand by grasping the loose skin over the neck. Puncture the vein with a lancet slightly behind the mandible.\n\t\tNOTE: Only the tip of the needle (1-2 mm) is required to enter the vein.\nAs the blood is dripping, collect at least 50 µL in a heparin-coated tube, and mix well by inverting the tube up and down several times. Transfer 30 µL of blood into a 5 mL round bottom polystyrene tube.",
    "NOTE: For the remaining blood, spin down the tube at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer the serum (supernatant layer) to a clean and labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and store it at −80 °C (for use in the cytokine assay).\nAdd 2 mL of lysis buffer (10x ammonium chloride-based lysing buffer diluted to 1x using nuclease-free water) into the 5 mL round bottom tube containing the blood. Mix very well by vortexing the tube. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 20 min to ensure proper lysis of the red blood cells.\nAdd 2 mL of flow buffer (PBS, 0.2 g/L of potassium chloride, 0.2 g/L of potassium phosphate monobasic, 8 g/L of sodium chloride, and 1.15 g/L of sodium phosphate dibasic containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% sodium azide).\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Decant the supernatant, and add 2 mL of flow buffer. Repeat this washing step 2x.\nCarefully decant the contents of the tube. Observe the small amount of fluid with a pellet remaining in the tube. Add 100 µL of flow buffer, and resuspend very well.\nTransfer all the remaining liquid in the 5 mL flow tube into a 96-well plate. Make sure each sample is properly labeled. Add 100 µL of flow buffer to the corresponding wells and centrifuge the 96-well plate at 650 × g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nAssess the expansion of the CD19+ target cells by flow cytometry (Figure 2).",
    "Prepare a master mix containing 0.3 µL of live/dead stain, 0.13 µg (2.5 µL) of anti-human CD19 antibody, 0.06 µg (2.5 µL) of anti-human CD45 antibody, 5 µg (2.5 µL) of anti-mouse CD45, and 42.2 µL of flow buffer for a total of 50 µL per sample. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15 min.\nWash with 150 µL of flow buffer followed by centrifugation at 650 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Decant the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 195 µL of flow buffer and 5 µL of counting beads.\nAcquire on a flow cytometer to determine the level of CD19+ cell expression. For gating and analysis purposes, first gate the population of interest (CD19+) based on the forward versus side scatter characteristics, followed by a single gating population, and then live cells. Once the live cells are gated, assess the human CD45 versus mouse CD45 population, and from the human population, gate the CD19+ target population.\nQuantify to determine the amount present in 70 µL, and then express in cells/µL using equation (1):\n\tAbsolute CD19+ cell count = ([CD19+ cells/counting beads] × number of counting beads within 5 µL)/70\n\t​​NOTE: Repeat the peripheral blood assay every 5 days to assess the CD19+ cell expansion. Collect no more than 200 μL of blood cumulatively every 2 weeks in accordance with local animal ethics committee guidelines. Once the mice have reached a disease burden of ≥10 cells/µL, randomize to CART19 cell or control groups (section 4).\n4. Administration of CART19 cells  in vivo\nPreparation of CART19 cells (~Day 80):\n\tNOTE: The generation of CART19 cells has been previously published27,30,31. This procedure must be carried out inside a Biosafety Cabinet Level 2+ using aseptic technique and personal protective equipment.",
    "Thaw the CART19 cells in a water bath container (37 °C). Then, wash the cells in warm T cell medium (TCM) to remove the dimethyl sulfoxide.\n\t\tNOTE: TCM is made of 10% human AB serum(v/v), 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (v/v), and serum-free hematopoietic cell medium27,30.\nCentrifuge the CART19 cells at 300 × g for 8 min at 4 °C, and resuspend in warm TCM to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL. Allow the CART cells to rest in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) overnight but for no more than 16 h.\nAdministration of CART19 cells via i.v. injection (Day ~80)\n\t\nCount the CART19 cells, and spin down at 300 × g for 8 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the CART19 cells with 10 mL of PBS, and spin down at 300 × g for 8 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the CART19 cells to a final concentration of 40 × 106 cells/mL with PBS, transfer the cells into a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and place them on ice.\nPerform CART19 cell tail vein injections (as detailed above) by injecting 100 µL of resuspended cells i.v.\n\t\t​NOTE: A volume of 100 µL will administer 4 × 106 cells to each mouse. Include a group of untreated mice as a negative control.\n5. Assessment of CART19 cell-associated toxicities\nAfter CART19 cell administration, monitor the mice 2x a day to assess any changes in their well-being, such as motor weakness, hunched body, and loss of body weight.\n\tNOTE: All these physical changes correlate with CRS symptoms in this model28.\nOnce the mice begin to develop motor weakness and weight reduction (10-20% reduction from the baseline), collect peripheral blood to analyze the tumor burden and conduct serum isolation for cytokines as per the methodology described in section 3 (Figure 3).",
    "Store the serum microcentrifuge tubes at −80 °C, and use the sera to analyze the chemokines and cytokines using a Multiplex assay (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: If the mice exhibit signs of hind limb paralysis, appear moribund or lethargic, and the weight loss is > 20% of their body weight up to the point that limits their ability to reach food and/or water, then they will be subjected to euthanasia.\n6. MRI imaging\nNOTE: A preclinical (for small animals) MRI scanner with a vertical bore magnet was used for in vivo magnetic resonance and image acquisition32,33.\nMix 120 µL of Gadolinium + 880 µL of saline solution, and load into a 1 mL insulin syringe. Inject 100 µL into each mouse (i.p.).\n\tNOTE: Gadolinium should be injected 15-20 min prior to the start of the experiment.\nAnesthetize the mouse using isoflurane (2-3%) in an induction chamber for 10-15 min.\n\tNOTE: It is highly recommended to apply ophthalmic ointment to prevent eye dryness.\nPlace the mouse spine on the rodent-compatible cradle probe. Then, proceed to position the mouse by hooking its teeth on the bite bar.\nPull the head of the mouse into the 25 mm volume coil, and adjust the nose cone tethered to the isoflurane anesthesia system. Tighten the knob of the bite bar to maintain the position for the duration of the scan.\n\tNOTE: If conducting a contrast-enhanced MRI scan, ensure that the gadolinium (in this case) or contrast agent is injected at least 10 min prior to placing the apparatus into the bore magnet. Throughout the time of the imaging, the mice will be anesthetized by the inhalation of 2-3% isoflurane in air via the nose cone, and their respiratory rate will be simultaneously monitored.\nFor breathing assessment, use a breathing/respiratory monitoring device.",
    "NOTE: It is important to assess the body temperature as well in order to prevent possible hypothermia due to extended exposure to anesthesia. It is recommended to use heat pads to control the body temperature.\n\t\nAttach the breathing monitor probe close to the diaphragm, and secure it with surgical tape. Keep the respiration rate between 20-60 breaths per min so that the mouse's condition is stable.\n\t\tNOTE: This rate provides more stable MRI images and prevents motion artifacts in the acquired image. If the respiratory rate is higher than the 20-60 breaths per min range, increase the concentration of isoflurane. If the respiratory rate is less than 20 breaths per min, the anesthesia is too deep; therefore, concentration needs to be decreased.\nInsert the animal probe into the small bore within the vertical-bore small-animal MRI system. Adjust the animal's head at the center of the coil. Secure the apparatus with the lock so it can stand upright, and connect the instrument to the computer.\nOpen and use the software (e.g., Paravision) to set up the scan positions and types of scans. Determine the optimal axial and sagittal positions while keeping them consistent for all the experimental groups.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to use the acquisition of a trial scan as a reference prior to the actual full-length MRI scans.\nProceed with the MRI data collection (as previously described32,34,35,36). Obtain both T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images using the suggested setup mentioned below.\n\t\nFor T1-weighted MRI images, use T1-weighted multislice multiecho (MSME) sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 300 ms, an echo time (TE) of 9.5 ms, a field of view (FOV) of 4 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm, and a matrix of 192 x 96 x 96.",
    "For T2-weighted MRI images, use a Multislice Multiecho (MSME) sequence with a TR of 300 ms, a TE of 9.5 ms, an FOV of 4 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm, and a matrix of 192 x 96 x 96 was used.\nOnce the scans are complete, remove the probe from the bore. Gently extract the mouse by removing the teeth off the bite bar. Monitor the animal in a separate cage until it is fully conscious and has regained adequate motor function.\nAfter the extraction of data from the software, use analysis software for the quantification and 3D volume rendering (Figure 4) of the hyperintensity regions.\n\tNOTE: If possible, it is strongly encouraged to have two separate blinded observers for the data analysis.\nSubscription Required.
