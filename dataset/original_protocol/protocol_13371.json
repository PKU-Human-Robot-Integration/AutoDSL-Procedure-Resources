  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were conducted according to the guidelines issued by the National Institutes of Health's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the 8th edition of the NRC) and were approved by Anhui University of Science and Technology Animal Ethics Committee.\n1. Animal preparation\nHouse 32 male C57/BL6 mice aged 8 weeks in a laboratory with a 12 h light/dark cycle. Ensure that the mice have free access to food and water.\nAfter 2 weeks of acclimation to the environment, when the 10 week old mice weigh 23-26 g, use random numbers generated by a computer to randomly group the animals without partitioning, resulting in four groups of mice: the control group (Con), the nicotine group (Nic), the silica group (SiO2), and the nicotine combined with silica group (Nic+ SiO2).\n2. Nicotine preparation\nNOTE: The nicotine density is 1.01 g/mL.\nDissolve the nicotine in anhydrous ethanol, and dilute 20x to prepare a nicotine stock solution of 50 mg/mL.\nDilute the nicotine stock solution 1,000x with sterile normal saline to make a working solution at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL.\n\t​NOTE: Store nicotine away from light. The stock solution can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\n3. Silica preparation\nSuspend sterile crystalline silica in saline to prepare a 20 mg/mL silica suspension, and oscillate it in an ultrasonic shaking water bath for 25 min.\nShake the silica suspension with a vortex oscillator for 3 min before the mice receive the nasal drip. Mix the silica suspension by pipetting up and down 2x-3x with a 200 µL pipette, and then take up 50 µL for the nasal drip.\n\tNOTE: The silicon dioxide suspension should be mixed and administered via nasal drip as soon as possible.\n4. Mouse capture and nicotine exposure",
    "Weigh the mice, and record the weights daily before exposure.\nOn days 1-40, subcutaneously inject nicotine twice daily (12 h apart) into the mice in the Nic and Nic+ SiO2 groups. Use a nicotine dose of 0.25 mg/kg; for example, ensure that a mouse weighing 25 g receives 6.25 µg of nicotine. For this mouse, the injection volume would be as follows: 6.25/0.05 = 125 µL. Simultaneously, inject the mice in the Con group with an equal volume of saline.\nPrepare the required 1 mL syringes for each group, and use them to aspirate the injection volume of nicotine or saline. Before taking up the nicotine, first draw 0.1-0.2 mL of air into the syringe, and then draw up 125 µL of nicotine. Carefully tap the syringe to fill the needle and the front end of the syringe with the nicotine. Place the nicotine-containing syringe in a tray protected from light.\n\tNOTE: At the time of injection, 0.1-0.2 mL of air is situated behind the nicotine, guaranteeing that all the liquid is successfully administered to the mouse.\nGrasp the tail of the mouse with the right hand, and when the animal relaxes, use the left thumb and forefinger to press the skin on the back of the neck from the tail to the head up to the edge of the ear, applying moderate pressure. After that, release the right hand, and use the left small thumb and ring finger to pinch the tail and hind limbs, at which point the mouse will be completely immobilized by the left hand.\n\tNOTE: Grasp the mouse with appropriate force. Insufficient strength makes it easy for mice to bite, whereas excessive strength may result in the asphyxiation of the mice.",
    "Using the right hand to inject, puncture the skin on the back of the neck near the ear edge of the mice in a head-to-tail direction with the syringe, and inject with nicotine at a uniform rate. Look for a semicircular skin bulge that indicates a successful injection.\n\tNOTE: When the needle has punctured into the skin, there will be a feeling of resistance; the resistance disappears after the needle has been inserted. At this point, the needle needs to be slightly withdrawn to inject slowly and evenly.\n5. Silica exposure in vivo\nOn days 5-19, instill the silicon dioxide suspension into the nasal cavity of the mice in the SiO2 and Nic+ SiO2 groups. Rapidly anesthetize each mouse with 2% isoflurane in an anesthesia machine at a dose of 3.6 mL/h. After anesthesia, place the mouse on the palm of one hand, and expose the nasal cavity of the mouse. Instill 50 µL of silica suspension into the nasal cavity within 4-8 s.\nTo allow the silica suspension to enter the lungs as soon as possible, after instillation, press the mouse's heart gently with the index finger for 3-5 s, 3x-5x per second, to promote its respiratory rate.\nAfter the respiration of the mouse gradually becomes uniform, place the mouse in a cage to observe for 3 min.\nFor all mice receiving the silica suspension, repeat steps 1-3. In the control group, instill 50 μL of sterile saline into the nasal cavity on days 5-19.\n6. Acquisition of fresh and fixed lung tissues\nOn day 41, use 50 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital to anesthetize the mice intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.1 mL/20 g according to their body weight. Fix the limbs on a foam test plate, and spray the fur with 75% alcohol.",
    "Perform cardiac perfusion to obtain fresh lung tissue, cut the midline of the abdomen to expose the chest cavity, and make a small opening at the apex of the right heart. Then, inject 20 mL of pre-cooled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) slowly and evenly from the apex of the left heart, causing the blood to flow out from the opening created at the apex of the right heart. Take out the entire lung lobe, place it in a pre-cooled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and transfer to −80 °C for storage pending protein extraction.\nPerfuse other mice with 20 mL of pre-cooled PBS followed by 10 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde at the same location to fix whole lungs; preserve each lung in 30 mL of 4% PFA.\nAfter 72 h, embed the fixed lung tissues in paraffin.\n\t\nImmerse the lung tissue in the prepared fixative in an ultrasonic water bath at 40 °C for 30 min, followed by a dehydration process in 75% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and anhydrous ethanol for 50 min each.\nWash 2x with xylene for 50 min each.\nPlace the tissue in melted paraffin wax at 55-60 °C for 2-3 h so that the xylene in the lung tissue is gradually replaced by paraffin wax.\nFix the lung tissue in the embedding frame with paraffin, and wait for the wax block to harden. After the wax block has hardened, use the paraffin sectioning machine to slice the lung at 4-5 µm.\nPlace the lung sections in ultrapure water at 45 °C. Once the paraffin has melted, load the lung section onto an adherent microscope slide.\n7. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining",
    "Bake the slides at 60 °C for 2 h, and place the slides in xylene to dewax for 2 x 30 min. Subsequently, place the slides in anhydrous ethanol, 95% ethanol, 85% ethanol, and 75% ethanol for 5 min each. Finally, wash them for 3 x 5 min with ultrapure water.\nDrop 50 µL of hematoxylin staining solution onto the lung tissue with a pipette gun, and stain for 5 min; then, wash the slices with running water for 5 min.\nAdd 50 µL of 2% hydrochloric acid in ethanol onto the section, and rinse with distilled water for 30 s. Then, add 50 µL of eosin staining solution onto the lung tissue to stain for 1 min.\nDehydrate, transparentize, and seal the paraffin sections.\n\t\nAdd 100-150 mL of 75% ethanol, 85% ethanol, 95% ethanol, anhydrous ethanol, and xylene in a combined plastic dyeing tank. Place the slides in 75%, 85%, 95%, and anhydrous ethanol for 5 min each to dehydrate.\nThen, place the slides in xylene for 5 min to transparentize.\nFinally, drop 20 µL of neutral gum onto the lung section, and place a coverslip over the slide to seal it.\n\t\t​NOTE: The above steps are carried out at room temperature.\n8. Masson staining\nDewax, hydrate, and wash the paraffin sections as described in step 7.1.\nStain the sections with 50 µL of configured Weigert's hematoxylin staining solution for 7 min, followed by 50 µL of acidic ethanol fractionation solution for 10 s, and wash with running water to turn the nuclei blue.\nStain the sections with 50 µL of Masson trichrome solution for 4 min, and wash with water.\nRinse the sections with distilled water for 1 min, and then stain with Lichun red acid magenta for 7 min.",
    "Wash the sections with a weak acid working solution (30% hydrochloric acid) for 1-2 min, phosphomolybdic acid solution for 1-2 min, and weak acid working solution for 1-2 min.\nStain the sections in aniline blue staining solution for 2 min, and then wash with a weak acid working solution for 1 min.\nDehydrate the sections with 95% ethanol followed by anhydrous ethanol for 1 s, transparentize with xylene for 1 s, and finally seal with neutral resin as described in step 7.4.\n9. Immunohistochemistry\nBake the slices at 60 °C for 6 h. Dewax, hydrate, and wash the paraffin sections as described in step 7.1.\nAntigen retrieal: place the slices in a heat-resistant plastic slicing box containing enough citrate antigen retrieval solution to submerge the slices, and boil for 20-30 min.\nCool to room temperature, remove the sections, and rinse with deionized water. Subsequently, soak for 2 x 5 min in PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST).\nDraw a loop near the lung section on the slide with a hydrophobic pen to form a hydrophobic circle.\nAdd 50 µL of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (3% H2O2) dropwise to the slices, and incubate for 15 min at room temperature protected from light for the inactivation of endogenous peroxidase.\nSoak the slices in PBST for 3 x 5 min.\nAdd 50 µL of 5% bovine serum protein (BSA)-PBST dropwise to the slices, and block for 1 h at room temperature.\nDiscard the blocking solution, add 50 µL of the diluted primary antibodies CD206 (dilution: 1:1,500), TGF-β1 (dilution: 1:200), and vimentin (dilution: 1:2,000) dropwise to the slices, and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: In this work, all the antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA.\nThe next day, return the slices to room temperature (40 min). Wash the slices as described in step 9.6.",
    "Dilute the secondary antibody in 5% BSA. Add 50 µL of horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (dilution: 1:500) dropwise, and incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Wash the slices as described in step 9.6.\nDrop 50 µL of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution corresponding to the enzyme-labeled secondary antibody onto the lung tissue, and incubate for 5-10 min in a black immunohistochemical wet box. Observe under the microscope until the color develops to a strong brown. Rinse the slices with distilled water to terminate the reaction.\n\tNOTE: Brown staining is considered positive staining.\nStain with 50 µL of hematoxylin stain for 30 s, and wash with running water. Next, soak the slices in 75%, 85%, 95%, and anhydrous ethanol for 3 min each and then in xylene for 2 x 10 min. Seal the slides as described in step 7.4.\n10. Western blot analysis\nTake the lung tissue out of the freezer, and weigh it. Next, add 150 µL of RIPA lysis buffer containing PMSF per 20 mg of lung tissue. Lyse the mouse lungs on ice for 3-5 min using a handheld homogenizer, shake gently for 2 h at 4 °C to allow adequate lysis of the lung tissue, centrifuge at 4 °C and 14,800 × g for 15 min, and collect the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: Add 100 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF) a few minutes before using the RIPA lysis buffer. The final concentration of PMSF is 1 mM (e.g., 10 µL of PMSF + 990 µL of RIPA).\nUse a BCA protein concentration kit to determine the protein concentration of the sample by following the manufacturer's instructions. After determination, using the smallest concentration of protein lysate as a base, dilute the same batch of protein lysate with RIPA to the smallest concentration to achieve the same mass and volume.",
    "NOTE: The total amount of lung tissue loading is 30 µg.\nAdd 40 µL of 5x loading buffer to 160 µL of protein lysate, and heat it at 100 °C for 10 min.\nAssemble the prepared 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel in the western blotting electrophoresis system, add the SDS-PAGE electrophoresis buffer, gently pull out the electrophoresis comb, and add 20 µL of protein sample per well slowly and uniformly. Switch on the power, and start the electrophoresis at 80 V for 30 min. After the proteins have reached the lower gel layer, switch to 100 V, and continue the electrophoresis for 60-70 min.\n\tNOTE: Electrophoresis needs fresh electrophoresis buffer.\nTransfer the proteins to a PVDF membrane by wet transfer. Activate the PVDF membrane with methanol in advance (5-30 s). Take the electrophoresis gel plate out, carefully pry it open, place the separator gel into the wet transfer buffer, make the electric transfer sandwich, and assemble the wet transfer system. Fill the electrophoresis tank with transfer buffer, and transfer at 400 mA for 90 min.\n\tNOTE: The transfer buffer is cooled in advance to avoid the effects of high temperatures during the wet transfer.\nWash the PVDF membrane with Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween-20 (TBST) for 3 x 5 min. Block the PVDF membrane with 5% skim milk diluted in TBST, and incubate on a shaker at room temperature for 60 min; then, wash with TBST for 2 min. After washing, incubate the membrane overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody vimentin (1:5,000) and GAPDH (1:10,000) diluted in 5% BSA.",
    "Place the membrane at room temperature for 30 min, and wash with TBST for 5 x 5 min. After washing, incubate the membrane with the secondary antibody (1:10,000) diluted in 5% skim milk for 60 min at room temperature.\nPlace the membrane, protein-side up, drop the prepared ECL working solution, incubate for 1-2 min, and observe the results with a gel imager. Use the greyscale values measured by the software in the gel imager to evaluate the protein expression levels.\n\tNOTE: Here, GAPDH served as an internal reference.\nSubscription Required.
