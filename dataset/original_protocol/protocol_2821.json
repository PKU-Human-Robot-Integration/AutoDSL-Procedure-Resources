Each row contains about 12–14 seeds spaced about 0.5 cm apart.\nSeal plates with micropore tape (3M).\nWrap the plate with aluminum foil and stratify the seeds at 4°C for 3 days.\nGrow seedlings vertically in a Percival CU36L5 incubator (or similar) at 21°C–23°C under a 16-h light, 8-h dark photoperiod for 4–5 days.\nPreparation of split-agar system with plastic separator\nTiming: 4–6 h\nThese steps aim to prepare the split-agar plates with a plastic separator.\nPrepare 1/2 MS medium (1.2% agar, 1% sucrose, pH 5.7) and 1/2 MS medium containing 200 mM NaCl (1.2% agar, 1% sucrose, pH 5.7) with a magnetic bar in 1 L bottle and autoclave at 120°C for 20 min.",
