    "1. Solutions and Preparations\nNOTE: All buffers and solutions should be prepared in double-distilled (dd) H2O. Because the hydration state of sucrose varies, the final concentration of all sucrose solutions must be determined using a refractometer.\nPrepare phosphate-buffered saline without divalent cations (PBS-): 137 mM NaCI, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, and 6.5 mM Na2HPO4. Adjust the pH to 7.4. Sterilize by autoclaving (1 cycle at 121 °C for 15 min) and store at room temperature.\nPrepare stock solution of 300 mM imidazole: 0.204 g of imidazole in 10 mL of ddH2O.Adjust the pH to 7.4 at 4 °C using HCl. Filter-sterilize using a 0.22 μm pore size filter and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare homogenization buffer (HB; prepare approximately 100 mL): 250 mM sucrose in 3 mM imidazole. Adjust the pH to 7.4 at 4 °C using a pH-meter. Filter-sterilize using a 0.22 μm pore size filter and store at 4 °C. Complement the HB just before use with a cocktail of protease inhibitors at final concentrations corresponding to 10 mM leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin A, and 10 ng/mL aprotinin.\nFor the step floatation gradients, prepare 62%, 39%, and 35% sucrose solutions in 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4, as described below. Precisely determine the final concentration of all sucrose solutions using a refractometer.\nPrepare 100 mL of 62% sucrose solution in 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. Dissolve by stirring 80.4 g of sucrose in ddH2O pre-warmed to 35 °C. Add 1 mL of 300 mM imidazole stock solution and fill to 100 mL with ddH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.4 at 4 °C. Filter-sterilize using a 0.22 μm pore size filter and store at 4 °C.",
    "Prepare 100 mL of 35% sucrose solution in 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. Dissolve by stirring 40.6 g of sucrose in ddH2O. Add 1 mL of 300 mM imidazole stock solution and fill to 100 mL with ddH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.4 at 4 °C. Filter-sterilize using a 0.22 μm pore size filter and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 50 mL of 39% sucrose in 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. Dilute the 62% sucrose solution with the 35% sucrose solution. Store at 4 °C.\nDissolve 3 g of paraformaldehyde (PFA) by stirring in 100 mL of PBS- pre-warmed to 60 °C while adding 1 M NaOH dropwise; adjust the final pH to 7.4 using NaOH. Filter-sterilize using a 0.22-μm pore size filter and store at -20 °C.\n\tCAUTION: 3% PFA is a toxic reagent.\nPrepare 1 M KCl stock solution. Dissolve 3.73 g of KCl by stirring in 50 mL of ddH2O. Filter-sterilize using a 0.22-μm pore size filter and store at room temperature.\nPrepare 50X concentrated stock solution containing 0.625 M Hepes at pH 7.0 and 75 mM MgOAc2in ddH2O. Aliquot and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare mounting medium. Mix by stirring 2.4 g of poly(vinyl alcohol) Mw ~31,000 (PVA) with 6 g of glycerol. Add 6 mL of ddH2O and leave for at least 2 h at room temperature. Add 12 mL of 0.2 M Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) and heat to approximately 53 °C with occasional stirring until the PVA has dissolved.\nClarify the solution by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 20 min at room temperature. Collect the supernatant and add 2.5% (w/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) to prevent photobleaching during fluorescence detection. Vortex for about 30 s to dissolve. Aliquot into 1.5-mL plastic tubes and store at -20 °C.\n2. Cell Culture",
    "Culture HeLa cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10% non-essential amino acids, 10% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Maintain them at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nTransfect the cells 24 h before the experiment with GFP-RAB510, using commercial transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nWhen needed, prepare endosomal fractions and cytosol from cells depleted of a protein of interest (i.e., using RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9) and/or overexpressing a wildtype or mutant form of the protein of interest.\n3. Endosomal Fraction Preparation\nNOTE: This protocol describes the straightforward preparation of subcellular fractions containing endosomes and other light membranes. If needed, purified endosome fractions can also be used11. Prepare 2 Petri dishes (10-cm outer diameter; 57 cm2) of confluent cells expressing GFP-RAB5 as starting material. The total number of confluent HeLa cells in 2 Petri dishes corresponds roughly to 2.5 x 107 cells. When needed, the endosomes can also be prepared from cells depleted of a protein of interest (i.e., using RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9) and/or overexpressing a wildtype or mutant form of the protein of interest, always expressing GFP-RAB5.\nCAUTION: All steps of the fractionation protocol should be performed on ice.\nPlace the Petri dishes onto a wet metal plate in a flat ice bucket and immediately wash the cells twice with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS-.\nRemove all PBS- from the last wash and add 3 mL of ice-cold PBS- per dish. Cells should not dry during handling: if necessary, place the ice bucket on a rocking platform to adequately cover cells with fluid.",
    "Mechanically remove the cells in PBS from the Petri dishes using a flexible rubber policeman (i.e., homemade cell scraper). Scrape the cells off the dishes first in a quick, circular motion around the outside of the dish, followed by a downward motion in the middle of the dish. Scrape gently to obtain \"sheets\" of attached cells. Gently transfer the cells using a plastic Pasteur pipette with a wide opening to a 15-mL conical polypropylene tube on ice.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 175 x g and 4 °C.\nGently remove the supernatant (SN) and add 1 - 3 mL of HB to the pellet. Using a plastic Pasteur pipette with a wide opening, gently pipette up and down once to resuspend the cells.\nCentrifuge for 7 - 10 min at 1,355 x g and 4 °C. Gently remove the SN.\nPerform cell homogenization.\n\tNOTE: Conditions should be gentle so that the plasma membranes of the cells are broken but the endosomes remain intact.\n\t\nAdd a known volume of HB with protease inhibitors onto each cell pellet (approximately 100 μL per cell pellet). Using a 1,000-µL micropipette, gently pipette up and down until the cells are resuspended. Do not introduce air bubbles.\nPrepare a 1-mL tuberculin syringe with a 22G needle pre-rinsed with HB and free of air or bubbles.\nFill the syringe with the cell suspension relatively slowly (to avoid creating air bubbles), place the beveled tip of the needle against the wall of the tube, and expel the cell suspension rapidly to shear off the plasma membranes of the attached cells.",
    "Take a small aliquot of the homogenate (approximately 3 µL) and dilute it into 50 µL of HB on a glass slide. Mix and cover with a glass coverslip. Inspect the homogenate under a phase-contrast microscope equipped with a 20X or 40X objective.\n\t\tNOTE: Under optimal conditions, most cells are broken, but nuclei, which appear as dark grey and round structures, are not (Figure 1).\nRepeat step 3.7.3 and 3.7.4 until most cells are broken; usually, 3 - 6 up-and-down strokes through the needle are necessary. Keep a small aliquot (10 - 30 µL) of the homogenate for protein determination.\nCentrifuge homogenate for 7 min at 1,355 x g and 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: After centrifugation, the pellet (defined as the nuclear pellet; NP) contains the nuclei and the supernatant (defined as the postnuclear supernatant; PNS) contains the cytosol and the organelles released upon homogenization and in free suspension.\nCarefully collect the PNS. Keep small aliquots (10 - 30 µL) of the PNS and NP for protein determination and discard the NP.\nAdjust the PNS to 40.6% sucrose by diluting the 62% sucrose solution with PNS using a 1:1.1 ratio of PNS:62% sucrose. Mix gently but thoroughly, without creating air bubbles. Check the sucrose concentration using the refractometer.\nPlace the PNS in 40.6% sucrose at the bottom of an ultracentrifugation tube. Overlay carefully with 2.5 mL of the 35% sucrose solution and fill the centrifuge tube with HB.\n\tNOTE: The sucrose solutions should be layered so that interfaces are clearly visible.\nUltracentrifuge the gradients for 1 h at  ̴165,000 x g and 4 °C.\nCarefully remove the white layer of lipids on top of the gradient. Next, collect the interface containing endosomes, between the HB and 35% sucrose, using a 200-μL micropipette with a cut tip.",
    "NOTE: The endosomal fractions can be used directly in the in vitro actin polymerization assay or can be aliquoted on ice, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.\nDetermine the protein concentration of the PNS and endosomal fractions.\n\tNOTE: This concentration should be at least 100 µg/mL. Approximately 2.5 x 107 cells grown in 2 Petri dishes are needed to obtain a PNS with at least 100 µg/mL (see the Note above).\n4. Cytosol Preparation\nNOTE: Prepare 2 Petri dishes (10 cm diameter; 57 cm2) of confluent HeLa cells as starting material.When needed, the cytosol can also be prepared from cells depleted of a protein of interest (i.e., using RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9) and/or overexpressing a wildtype or mutant form of the protein of interest. As for the endosome fractionation protocol, all steps should be performed on ice.\nRepeat steps 3.1 - 3.8.\nPlace the PNS in a centrifuge tube and ultracentrifuge for 45 min at ̴250,000 x g and 4 °C.\nCarefully remove the white layer on top and collect the SN (cytosol fraction) without disturbing the microsome pellet. Keep an aliquot of the cytosol fraction for protein determination.\n\tNOTE: The cytosol can be used directly in the in vitro actin polymerization assay or can be aliquoted on ice, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.\nDetermine the protein concentration of the cytosol.\n\tNOTE: It should be at least 3 mg/mL.\n5. Assay Measuring Endosome-dependent Actin Polymerization In Vitro",
    "NOTE: Endosome-dependent actin polymerization can be performed using two alternative approaches. In the first approach, the materials are mixed in a test tube, fixed, and transferred to a coverslip and analyzed. In the second approach, described here, the assay can be carried out directly in the imaging chamber and can be fixed and analyzed without mechanical perturbation (Figure 2C). In this second approach, the assay mixture is not transferred from a test tube to a coverslip and thus remains unperturbed, decreasing the danger of F-actin networks being physically perturbed during the transfer. In addition, this second approach is compatible with a time-lapse analysis of F-actin polymerization. It should be noted that no difference in the analysis of F-actin polymerization was observed with either approach.\nNOTE: Use cut tips throughout the protocol.\nIn a test tube\nGently mix ice-cold purified GFP-RAB5 endosomes (step 3) with cytosol (step 4) at a ratio of 1:10 (protein concentration) in an ice-cold 1.5-mL conical test tube.\n\t\tNOTE: A typical experiment is carried out with approximately 40 - 50 µL.\nAdjust the ice-cold reaction mixture to final concentrations of 125 mM KCl (using the 1 M KCl stock solution), 12.5 mM Hepes, and 1.5 mM MgOAc2 (using the 50x stock solution). Then, adjust the mixture with protease inhibitors to final concentrations of 10 mM leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin A, and 10 ng/mL aprotinin. Gently mix all components.\nPlace the test tube containing the reaction mixture at 37 °C, without shaking, and incubate for the desired time.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, it will take approximately 3 min to detect actin polymerization on endosomes and 30 min for the formation of an extensive network.",
    "At the desired time (i.e., 3 min or 30 min), stop the reaction by placing the test tube on ice and add 1/10 (vol:vol) of the precooled 3% PFA solution.\nAdd 0.3:10 (vol:vol) of 200 units/mL (~6.6 μM) phalloidin conjugated to red-orange dye to stain the polymerized actin.\nPlace 12 μL of the mixture onto 12 μL of PVA mounting medium on a micro glass slide. Put an 18 x 18 mm2 glass coverslipon top.\nAnalyze the sample with confocal microscopy.\nIn the imaging chamber\nTo make microscopic imaging chambers, use plasma cleaner for 1 min to clean a round 18-mm diameter coverslip and a round 35 mm diameter Petri dish equipped with a 20 mm glass bottom (0.16-0.19 mm).\nIncubate the cleaned surfaces with 1% β-casein for 20 min to minimize protein binding to the glass. Wash twice with 3 mM imidazole.\nAdd endosome and cytosol, in the same assay mixture as in steps 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, to a precooled 1.5 mL test tube and complement the assay mixture with 0.1 μg/μL rhodamine-actin.\nAdjust the final refractive index of the mixture to 1.375 (26.5% sucrose) using 39% sucrose solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, the same volume is added; however, this has to be empirically re-adjusted depending upon the sucrose concentration of the collected fraction, determined using a refractomer, since the sucrose concentration may slightly change from experiment to experiment.\nPlace the mixture on the pretreated 35-mm dish (step 5.2.1) and cover it with the pretreated 18-mm coverslip (step 5.2.1).\nPlace the chamber at 37 °C, without shaking.\nAnalyze the sample using fluorescence confocal microscopy.\n6. Image Acquisition and Analysis of Actin Network\nImage acquisition\nAcquire the images on an inverted scanning confocal microscope.",
    "NOTE: Image acquisition settings were optimized for an inverted scanning confocal microscope with a 63X 1.25 NA oil objective. Adjust the laser power (usually around 50%) to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio.\nQuantification of the actin network\nAnalyze the fluorescent micrographs. Use the opensource software CellProfiler (v2.1.1)12 to measure the amount of actin per endosome (alternative software can be used).\n\t\t\nFirst, identify endosomes as the primary object using the GFP-RAB5 signal. Then, quantify the F-actin associated with individual endosomes using the propagation of the actin signal (red-orange dye conjugated Phalloidin) as a secondary object.\nAverage and normalize the number of associated material for each object to the control condition.\nSubscription Required.
