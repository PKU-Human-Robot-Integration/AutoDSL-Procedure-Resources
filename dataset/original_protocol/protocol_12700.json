    "1. Advance preparations\nPreparation of the peristaltic liquid handler programs\n\tNOTE: For the diluent and cell dispensing steps of the protocol, a dedicated program must be prepared, taking into account the height of the dispensing head to the plate used and the step intent.\n\t\nFor the 1 µL diluent dispense step, mount a 1 µL cassette and prepare a program with the settings as described in steps 1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1.2.\n\t\t\nAdjust the flow rate parameter to High for the best throughput as no biological material damage is expected in this step. Adjust the dispense height to 9.6 mm (according to the cell culture plate used, Supplemental Figure 1) to allow the 1 µL drop to touch the bottom of the wells during dispensation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step is crucial to avoid the retention of the droplets on the dispensing head until reaching a sufficient volume to drop.\nAdjust the plate clear height to 14.4 mm to allow a free displacement of the dispensing head over the plate after dispensing each row. Visually control the proper settings of the peristaltic liquid handler head height: make sure no drops are retained on the dispensing tips while dispensing and verify that the head is high enough to allow displacement of the head after dispensing each row.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Avoiding drop retention is a crucial parameter as it will impair the accuracy of the volume of the dispensation.\nFor dispensing the 40 µL cell suspension, mount a 10 µL cassette and prepare a program with the settings as described in steps 1.1.2.1-1.1.2.2.",
    "Adjust the flow rate parameter to Low to dispense cells with a low speed to avoid promoting potential damages to the cells by shear stress and high impact on the bottom of the wells. Adjust the dispensation height to 11.43 mm (according to the cell culture plate used, Supplemental Figure 1), high enough to lower the cell impact on the bottom of the wells during the dispensing process but low enough to avoid retention of the droplets on the dispensing head. Adjust the plate clear height to 16 mm to allow free displacement of the dispensing head over the plate after dispensing each row.\nVisually control the proper settings of the peristaltic liquid handler head height: make sure no drops are retained on the dispensing tips while dispensing and verify that the head is high enough to allow displacement of the head after dispensing each row.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Avoiding drop retention is a crucial parameter as it will lead to dispensing an unreliable cell number.\nDNA plasmid preparation (classical miniprep extraction protocol)\nGrow a transformed DH5α bacteria strain in LB medium supplemented with 125 µg/mL ampicillin selection antibiotic (Table of Materials) overnight at 37 °C and under gentle agitation (200 rpm) on an orbital shaker (Table of Materials).\nHarvest 2 mL of the culture, pellet the cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 6,000 x g, and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 250 µL of resuspension buffer containing RNase A (Table of Materials). Add 250 µL of lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min at room temperature, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nStop the lysis reaction by adding 300 µL of neutralization buffer (Table of Materials) and vortexting shortly. Centrifuge the tubes for 5 min at 11,000 x g.",
    "Place a new plasmid minicolumn (Table of Materials) in a 2 mL collection tube and decant the supernatant in the column by centrifuging for 1 min at 11,000 x g.\nDiscard the flow-through and place the minicolumn back in the collection tube.\nWash the plasmid minicolumn with 500 µL of optional washing buffer (Table of Materials) and centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nDiscard the flow-through and place the plasmid minicolumn back in the collection tube.\nAdd 700 µL of washing buffer (Table of Materials) supplemented with ethanol and centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nDiscard the flow-through and centrifuge the plasmid minicolumn and its collection tube 1x more for 2 min at 11,000 x g to dry the silica membrane.\nPlace the dried plasmid minicolumn in a new 1.5 mL tube and add 30 µL of distilled water prewarmed at 60 °C, incubate it for 2 min at room temperature, and then, centrifuge it for 1 min at 11,000 x g.\nDiscard the plasmid minicolumn and keep the eluate containing the purified DNA plasmid.\nMeasure the DNA concentration of the eluted DNA using a microvolume spectrophotometer (Table of Materials).\n\t\t\nTurn on the spectrophotometer and choose the DNA measurement settings.\nRaise the sampling arm of the spectrophotometer and pipette 1 µL of water onto the measurement pedestal to perform a blank calibration.\nLower the sampling arm, start the blank measurement, and wait for completion.\nRaise the sampling arm and wipe the sample from the upper and lower pedestals.\nPipette 1 µL of the DNA solution onto the lower pedestal to measure it.\nLower the sampling arm, start the DNA concentration measurement, and wait for completion.",
    "Raise the sampling arm and wipe the sample from the upper and lower pedestals.\nFor further DNA concentration measurements, repeat steps 1.2.13.5-1.2.13.7.\nOnce the measurements are finished, store the DNA solutions at 4 °C until use.\n2. Experimental design and generation of the picklists to drive the ADE-based dispenses\nNOTE: A dedicated \"user-friendly\" spreadsheet macro was developed to manage DNA amounts and mix up to four plasmids in a 384-well plate format. Based on the entered experimental design, this macro generates the necessary files to drive the ADE-based DNA transfection protocol by nanodispenser. In order to generate these files, several fields have to be filled in the Template Sheet as shown in Figure 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59570/59570fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Generation of the picklists to drive the ADE dispensation using the spreadsheet macro. Several parameters have to be filled, namely (1) the transfection reagent (TR) and the minimal/maximal volumes to be used in the source plate, (2) the initial plasmid concentrations to be dispensed in the source plate, and (3) the whole-plate design, including the expected plasmid amounts and multiplexing in each of the 384-wells. (4) Generate Picklists activation allows the different fields to be verified and, once properly filled, picklists for DNA and TR dispensation and the necessary source plate template are automatically generated. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59570/59570fig2large.jpg]\nEnter the nanodispenser protocol parameters in the pink fields. Set the transfection reagent (TR) mixture value to 500 nL. Set the minimal volume value in the source plate wells to 4 µL. Set the maximal volume in the source plate wells to 11.25 µL.",
    "NOTE: The nanodispenser used here can only transfer a maximum of 500 nL in one run of ADE. These pink fields are prefilled with the recommended values but can be modified according to the user needs.\nEnter 100 ng/µL DNA starting concentrations in the blue fields corresponding to the underlying DNA.\n\tNOTE: This value is the optimal concentration previously defined but can, however, be modified for different user needs.\nEnter the desired DNA amount in the grey/green fields. Enter the amounts and plasmid names for the 384 wells, ensuring the same spelling if the same plasmid is used in several wells.\nGenerate the source plate design, the picklists files, and the pipetting guide file. Click on Generate Picklists to allow the macro to generate the DNA-Picklist.csv, the T.R.-Picklist.csv and the 384-Wells-Pipetting-Guide.csv files from data collected on the corresponding sheet. If requested, correct the orange-filled cell values as it indicates errors or volumes that cannot be handled by the nanodispenser.\nPrint the template(s) from the Source Plate sheet. Plasmid names and minimal volume to fill in the wells are indicated. Likewise, transfection reagent mixture volumes that will next have to be filled in the following wells are indicated as TR and highlighted in green.\n3. DNA source plate preparation using the 384-well pipetting guide application\nDilute the stored DNA plasmid from step 1.2.14 to 100 ng/µL using distilled water.\nCalibrate the 384-well grid to the plate dimensions: open the 384-well pipetting guide application on a tablet (Figure 3). Place the source plate on the grid on the lower screen, and in the upper left calibration menu, click + or - (or use the red cursor) to enhance or reduce the size of the grid and wells in order to adjust the green wells to the four corner wells of the plate.",

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59570/59570fig3large.jpg]\nUsing double-sided tape, mount the 3D-printed plate adapter on the screen to avoid source plate movements while dispensing. If needed, move the calibrated grid using the rotation arrows and Up/ Down/ Right/ Left buttons to adjust the grid on the screen to the plate position. Once the grid and well sizes are properly calibrated and located, tick the Lock calibration box.\nClick on FILE and open the 384 wells pipetting guide.csv file. Follow the screen instructions to manually dispense the indicated volume of the indicated plasmid at the indicated concentration in the white highlighted well corresponding to the proper target destination of the expected plate. Use - or + arrows to go back or further in the DNA dispensing process. Stop dispensing when reaching the first Transfection reagent solution to load.",
    "Once the DNA dispensations are finished, remove the source plate from the adapter. If several source plates have to be filled, then place a new source plate on the adapter and follow the dispensing instructions. Once the DNA dispensation has finished, centrifuge the DNA-filled source plate(s) (at 1,500 x g for 2 min) to ensure proper liquid leveling and to remove bubbles leading to inaccuracy in the ADE-based transfers.\n4. Peristaltic liquid handler-based 1 µL diluent dispensation in the destination plate\nNOTE: Perform steps 4.1-4.5 in a biological safety cabinet.\nDisinfect the 1 µL cassette head by spraying it with a spray disinfectant (Table of Materials), and allow this solution to enter the tip holder. Absorb the remnant disinfectant on absorbing paper. Mount the 1 µL cassette on the peristaltic liquid handler device. Turn on the device and make sure the cassette type setting is correct (1 µL), as well as the plate format (384 wells).\nDisinfect the entire lumen of the tubing: insert the tube organizer (holding the eight tubes together) in a sterile vessel and fill it with 5 mL of 70% alcohol. Using the priming function of the peristaltic liquid handler, first flush the alcohol in the tubing and then rinse it by passing 5 mL of distilled water and 5 mL of serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium [DMEM] supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin; Table of Material), successively filling in the same vessel. Make sure none of the tip is clogged by visually inspecting the liquid flow from all of them.",
    "Prime the tubing with serum-free medium by filling a new sterile vessel with 10 mL of prewarmed serum-free medium and diving the tube organizer in it. Press the prime button of the peristaltic liquid handler for about 10 s. Once again, ensure no tip is clogged by visually inspecting the liquid flow from all of them.\nFill the plate with 1 µL of diluent. Place a sterile 384-well culture plate (destination) on the peristaltic liquid handler plate carrier and remove its lid.\nRun the precalibrated program to dispense 1 µL in each well of the 384-well plate. The dispensing time is approximately 8 s. Then replace the lid of the 384-well plate.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, this step can be handled manually, in a safety cabinet, using a multichannel micropipette.\n5. Performance of a survey to control the manually dispensed volumes\nNOTE: For details, see Figure 4.\nRun the nanodispenser program, go to the diagnostic tab, tick the source plate Out box, load the source plate on the plate holder, and tick In to enter the plate. When prompted, select 384LDV_AQ_B2 to set the nanodispenser to the aqueous buffer dispensing mode, and press Ok.\nSelect Survey in the Miscellaneous menu and click on Launch. Select the prefilled wells to analyze and click on the Go button. Verify that the measured volumes match the expected ones and ensure no wells have been loaded with volumes of more than 12 µL as this will avoid transfers.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59570/59570fig4v3.jpg",

Click on Play and save the protocol. Click on Simulate to perform a simulation of the programmed dispensations to make sure that the picklist matches the expected experimental design. Once completed, click on Close.",
    "Click on Play, and then Run, to start the dispensing program: when asked, insert the requested source plate (DNA solutions manually filled) and the destination plate (diluent-filled) in the nanodispenser. \n\tNOTE: The dispensing time is approximately 5-20 min for a complete 384-well plate, depending on the selected volumes and the total number of dispensations in the experimental design.\nAlternatively, pause the protocol here as the diluent- and DNA-filled plates can handle dry or frozen storage for up to 7 days. For dry storage, let the plates dry on the bench at room temperature and then store them the same way. Thaw and centrifuge (at 1,500 x g for 2 min) frozen stored plates before use in a transfection step (section 7).\n\t \n7. ADE-driven transfection reagent dispensation\nIn a biosafety cabinet, extemporaneously dilute lipopolyplex transfection reagent in serum-free medium to a 1x final concentration. Vortex and immediately dispense this transfection reagent mix according to the predefined source plate(s) designed by the macro and using the precalibrated 384-well pipetting guide application as described in step 3.4.\n\tNOTE: Do not centrifuge the source plate once it is loaded with the reagent as no transfection is noticed after centrifugation.\nRun the nanodispenser program to perform a \"survey\" as described in section 5, in order to control the volumes of all the manually filled TR wells of the source plate(s) to avoid dispensing errors due to volumes exceeding 12 µL.\nClick on Reset to clear the sample list of the DNA picklist in the picklist software, and verify that the device parameters are still set to aqueous buffers and to the source and destination plate types used, as in step 6.1.",
    "Click on Import and choose the TR-Picklist.csv file. Click on Play and save the protocol if prompted, and (this is optionally but strongly recommended) perform a simulation of the programmed transfection reagent mixture dispensations to ensure proper design of the dispensations by clicking on the Simulate button. Once completed, click on Close.\nClick on Play, and then Run button to start the dispensing program: as requested, place the source plate(s) (TR-mixture-filled) and the destination plate (diluent- and DNA-filled) in the nanodispenser.\n\tNOTE: The dispensing time is  less than 20 min for a complete 384-well plate when dispensing 500 nL of TR mixture.\nIncubate 15-30 min at room temperature after adding the TR to the DNA as indicated by the manufacturer's protocol.\n8. Peristaltic liquid handler-based cell dispensation\nPrepare the peristaltic liquid handler for dispensing cells. Disinfect a 10 µL cassette head by spraying it with Aniospray Surf 29 Disinfectant and absorbing the remnant on paper. Mount the cassette on the peristaltic liquid handler device, change the cassette type setting to 10 µL, and make sure the plate format is set to 384 wells.\nDisinfect the 10 µL cassette tubing as previously described in step 4.2. Dive the tube organizer in a sterile vessel and flush the tubing with 5 mL of 70% alcohol, then with 5 mL of distilled water, and finally, with 5 mL of serum-free medium, successively filled in the same vessel and until each tube is empty.\nPrepare the cell suspension to dispense. From a confluent HeLa cell B10-culture dish, wash the cells 1x with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, and then dissociate the cells with trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C.",
    "Verify the cell dissociation under a microscope and stop the trypsin/EDTA action by adding 10 mL of complete medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin; see the Table of Material) in the culture dish. Harvest cells in a 50 mL tube and count the cells under the microscope, using a Malassez cell or an automatic cell counter.\nPrepare at least 25 mL of HeLa cell suspension at a concentration of 37,500 cells/mL in complete medium (i.e., 1,500 cells/40 µL) for a complete 384-well plate, to ensure tube priming and 40 µL/well dispensation.\nTo dispense the cells, fill a new sterile vessel with the prepared cell suspension and stir it to avoid sedimentation leading to inaccuracy in the cell density of the dispensation. Insert the tube organizer in this solution and press the Prime button until the cell suspension is starting to flush from the dispensing head. Make sure none of the tip is clogged by visually inspecting the liquid flow from all of them, and ensure each tube is loaded with cell suspension.\nLoad the DNA and TR-filled 384-well destination plate on the peristaltic liquid handler plate carrier and remove its lid. Run the precalibrated program to dispense 40 µL of the cell suspension on the complete 384-well plate (i.e., 1,500 cells/well). The dispensing time is about 8 s. Replace the lid of the 384-well plate.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the 40 µL cell suspension can be manually dispensed using a multichannel micropipette.\n9. Custom biological assay (cell transfection efficiency monitoring)\nNOTE: Following the experimental settings and intent of the experiment, use the required methods for luminescence, fluorescence, high-content screening, and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In this section of the protocol, cell transfection efficiency is evaluated by automated fluorescence microscopy and image analysis.",
    "Incubate the plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a water-saturated atmosphere and until proper protein expression.\n\tNOTE: Here, a 48 h incubation time is used for HeLa cells to monitor the transfection efficiency, using tdTomato- and mVenus-expressing plasmids.\nRemove the culture medium 48 h post-transfection by inverting the plate, add 30 µL/well of 10% formalin using the peristaltic liquid handler (10 µL cassette), and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nRemove the formalin by inverting the plate; then, incubate the cells for 15 min at room temperature with 0.1 ng/mL Hoechst diluted in 1x PBS solution.\nWash the cells 3x for 15 min with 80 µL of 1x PBS adjusted to pH = 8 in order to recover the high fluorescence signal lost by the 6.9 pH of the formalin solution incubation step.\nUsing an automated fluorescent microscope, acquire images of two or three fluorescent channels (Hoechst, tdTomato, and mVenus) sequentially with 10x objectives and a proper emission filter set (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI], dsRed, and fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC], respectively).\nTo evaluate transfection efficiencies, use image analysis software to determine the transfection efficiencies using script analysis based on nuclei staining.\nSubscription Required.
