    "Gain-of-function-mediated dynamic perturbationThe use of inducible gain-of-function strategies to understand regulatory hierarchies can be extremely informative. For example, Gomez-Mena et al. (2005) overexpressed an AG-GR fusion under the control of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CMV) 35S promoter (Benfey and Chua, 1990), to identify targets of AG (Gomez-Mena et al., 2005). Many of the genes they identified as differentially expressed in response to AG activation were shown to be direct targets (O’Maoileidigh et al., 2013; Gomez-Mena et al., 2005). Ito et al. (2004) also used a 35Spro:AG-GR line to perform perturbation experiments in the presence of the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which was used to infer the direct regulation of the SPOROCYTELESS gene by AG. In addition, Ito et al. (2007) introduced the 35Spro:AG-GR transgene into the ag-1 background and determined the temporal requirements for AG activity, particularly during stamen development, using an AG dosage-dependent rescue assay (Ito et al., 2004). Although these gain-of-function-mediated perturbation strategies are extremely useful, they can also produce artifactual results, as the activity of the protein of interest may behave differently due to its altered spatio-temporal pattern of expression (Smith et al., 2011).To perform a gain-of-function-mediated dynamic perturbation experiment, the protein of interest can simply be expressed from a promoter of interest in combination with the glucocorticoid (GR) or androgen (AR) receptor fusion technique (O'Maoileidigh et al., 2015; Yamaguchi et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2009). Alternatively, the chemically inducible two-component promoter systems OPpro/GR-LhG4 or AlcApro/AlcR can be employed (Roslan et al., 2001; Deveaux et al., 2003; Craft et al., 2005). Use of these promoter systems would not require modification of the protein of interest, which simplifies the design process relative to the GR/AR fusion techniques and eliminates the possibility that the GR/AR domain will interfere with protein function.",
    "Fuse the coding region of your gene of interest to the coding region of the GR/AR ligand binding domain (Notes 1-2). Be sure to preserve the open reading frames of the gene of interest and the GR/AR domain. Place the gene fusion downstream of a promoter of choice (Note 3) in a binary vector. Alternatively, utilize a two-component inducible system (see above and Note 4).Transform wild-type or mutant plants (Note 5) with the inducible transgene by floral dip and identify transformants using the appropriate selection technique (Clough and Bent, 1998).Discard first generation (T1) plants displaying phenotypes in the absence of the inducing agent.Treat the inflorescences of the remaining first generation plants with the appropriate inducer (Note 6).Phenotype the flowers at least every second day after treatment. A gradient of phenotypes would be expected, depending on the stage of a given flower when it was treated (Note 7).Alternatively, the plants can also be characterized on a molecular level to select candidates for further analysis (Notes 8-9). However, the phenotype produced after activating the transgene should be carefully examined.Select several independent lines and, if using the GR/AR fusion technique, perform Western blotting analysis, using an anti-GR or anti-AR antibody, in the second generation to determine the level of expression of the fusion protein.Select lines that produce full-length proteins, desirable phenotypes and/or desirable mRNA levels. Isolate lines that are homozygous for the transgene.At this point, an inducible perturbation experiment can be initiated. However, it may be difficult to dissect the stage-specific functions of the factor of interest on a molecular level. Therefore, we recommend crossing the transgenic lines with the appropriate floral induction system.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160330/20160330000915_9574.jpgFigure 1.

A flower from a plant containing a 35Spro:RNAi-AG transgene (unpublished); F. A flower from a plant containing a 35Spro:AG-4-amiRNA transgene (O’Maoileidigh et al., 2013).Transcriptional effector domain-mediated dynamic perturbationThe function of the protein of interest can be modified by fusing it to a transcriptional repressor domain. For example, overexpression of a fusion between AG and an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif from the protein SUPERMAN (SRDX) was shown to phenocopy a strong ag mutant phenotype (Mitsuda et al., 2006). We independently generated a 35Spro:AG-SRDX fusion that was designed to produce an identical protein to the published version in Mitsuda et al. (2006) (Figure 1C), however, we did not observe any strong ag-like phenotypes. We also overexpressed a fusion of AG with the WUSB repression domain from the transcription factor WUSCHEL in plants (Ikeda et al., 2009) and, in this case, did observe ag-like phenotypes (Figure 1D). However, we also observed plants with leaf-like floral organs (Figure 1D, inset). The reasons behind these discrepancies are unclear to us, however, they highlight the usefulness of generating control lines that constitutively express the chimeric gene prior to generating an inducible version. The gene of interest can also be expressed as fusion with a transcriptional activation domain. To our knowledge, such domains have not been fused with AG, however, they have been successfully used to understand the functions of other important floral regulators (e.g., Parcy et al., 1998). As with the gain-of-function experiments, the overexpression of the chimeric protein may alter its behavior.To perform this type of perturbation, the protein of interest can be fused to a transcriptional activation [e.g., VP16 (Triezenberg et al., 1988; Cousens et al.",
    ", 1989)] or repression domain [e.g., SRDX (Hiratsu et al., 2002)]. This should result in the activation or repression of all genes that the protein associates with, respectively (Note 10). The choice of an activation or repression domain would be weighted based on the known activities of the protein of interest and on the presence of endogenous transcriptional effector domains in the protein of interest.Fuse the protein of interest to the transcriptional effector domain of choice so that the reading frame of the gene and domain remain intact. The chosen domain should be positioned so that it is unlikely to interfere with the activity of the protein of interest (Notes 1-2). To generate a non-inducible version of the fusion protein, place this fusion gene downstream of a chosen promoter (Note 11) in a binary vector. Transform wild-type plants with the fusion gene by floral dip (Clough and Bent, 1998) and identify transformants using the appropriate selection technique (Miki and McHugh, 2004).Characterize the phenotypes of the resulting transgenic plants. If they match expectations, proceed to step B4 (Note 12).To make an inducible version, introduce the fusion gene into the dexamethasone or ethanol-responsive two-component promoter systems (Note 4).Transform wild-type plants with inducible transgene by floral dip (Clough and Bent, 1998) and identify transformants using the appropriate selection technique (Miki and McHugh, 2004).Discard T1 plants displaying phenotypes in the absence of the inducing agent.Treat the inflorescences of the remaining T1 plants with the appropriate inducer (Note 6).Phenotype the flowers periodically after treatment. A gradient of phenotypes would be expected, depending on the stage of a given flower when it was treated (Note 7).Alternatively, the plants can also be characterized on a molecular level to select candidates for further analysis (Notes 8-9). However, the phenotype produced after activating the transgene should be carefully examined.",
    "Select plants that produce desirable phenotypes and/or desirable mRNA levels and isolate lines that are homozygous for the transgene.At this point, an inducible perturbation experiment can be initiated. However, it may be difficult to dissect the stage-specific functions of the factor of interest on a molecular level. Therefore, we recommend crossing the transgenic lines with the appropriate floral induction system.Loss-of-function-mediated dynamic perturbationThe use of loss-of-function-mediated perturbation strategies offers several advantages over the perturbation strategies described above. In this case, the activity of the factor of interest would be removed via small RNAs. Therefore, the caveats associated with overexpression of the factor of interest, or a modified version, would not apply. The options available to perform this type of perturbation include the production of short interfering RNAs from a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursor (termed RNA interference, RNAi) or artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) (Ossowski et al., 2008; Schwab et al., 2006). The RNAi strategy relies on expressing a dsRNA that is homologous to a large portion of the factor of interest. This results in the production of many short RNA molecules, whereas amiRNAs rely on the production of a single type of small RNA to target a specific transcript (Schwab et al., 2006). Notably, RNAi-mediated perturbation is thought to lead to more off-targets than amiRNA-mediated perturbation (Ossowski et al., 2008; Schwab et al., 2006).We previously screened seven independent amiRNA constructs before identifying an amiRNA that efficiently targets the AG mRNA, which, when overexpressed, can recapitulate a strong ag null phenotype (Figure 1F) (O’Maoileidigh et al., 2013). We also successfully perturbed AG activity with an RNAi construct, however, the phenotype was somewhat weaker than the phenotype observed for the functional amiRNA (Figure 1E).",
    "Furthermore, the proportion of first generation plants that displayed a phenotype in the RNAi lines (~8%) was much lower than the proportion of lines that displayed a phenotype in the amiRNA lines (100%). Given this, and the potential off-target effects associated with RNAi-mediated perturbation, our recommendation would be to utilize amiRNAs to perturb gene activity.To perform a loss-of-function-mediated dynamic perturbation experiment, the chemically inducible two-component promoter systems described above can be used. To demonstrate functionality, we recommend making stable transformants that constitutively express the RNAi/amiRNA of interest prior to making an inducible version (Note 13).Design an RNAi (Note 14) or amiRNA (Note 15) construct and place it under the control of a promoter of choice in a binary vector.Notes:The materials and the cloning procedure to generate RNAi constructs are described in Eamens and Waterhouse (2011).The cloning procedure to generate amiRNAs is described by Schwab et al. (2006) while the appropriate vectors can be obtained through wmd3.weigelworld.org[href=https://bio-protocol.org/C:\\Users\\xiaoqing\\Desktop\\3\\3\\wmd3.weigelworld.org]. Transform wild-type plants with the construct by floral dip (Clough and Bent, 1998) and identify transformants using the appropriate selection technique (Miki and McHugh, 2004).If the phenotypes of the transgenic plants match expectations, proceed to step C4 (Note 12). Alternatively, if the phenotype of a corresponding null mutant is unknown, the mRNA levels of the gene of interest can be determined.To allow an inducible knockdown of gene activities, introduce the RNAi/amiRNA sequence into the dexamethasone or ethanol responsive two-component promoter systems (Note 4).Transform wild-type plants with inducible transgene by floral dip (Clough and Bent, 1998) and identify transformants using the appropriate selection technique (Miki and McHugh, 2004).Discard T1 plants displaying phenotypes in the absence of the inducing agent.Treat the inflorescences of the remaining first generation plants with the appropriate inducer (Note 6).Phenotype the flowers periodically after treatment.",

However, it may be difficult to dissect the stage-specific functions of the factor of interest on a molecular level. Therefore, we recommend crossing the transgenic lines with the appropriate floral induction system.Inducible perturbation followed by gene expression analysis and phenotypic analysisGene expression profiling using dynamic perturbations with whole inflorescences It is possible to perform an inducible gene perturbation experiment using whole inflorescences, however, no temporal information will be available from these data. In fact, the RNA populations isolated are likely to be dominated by RNA from older flowers (Wellmer et al., 2004).Grow plants so that they bolt in a relatively synchronous manner (Note 18).Divide plants into two populations: those that will be treated with the inducer and those that will be treated with a mock solution. The same strategy would be applied to any control plants being used.Treat the inflorescence to activate expression of the dynamic perturbation transgene (Note 6).Harvest approximately 20 inflorescences per sample from a few hours to days after initiating the dynamic perturbation using liquid nitrogen to keep the samples frozen. Extract RNA and perform qRT-PCRs to measure the responsiveness of i) the effector molecule (e.g., amiRNA precursor, protein fusion) and ii) a gene (or several genes) that will be affected by the induction. These data will allow the assessment of the kinetics of the knockdown, which will inform the subsequent experimental design (Note 19).",

Harvest approximately 20 inflorescences at chosen time-points using liquid nitrogen to keep the samples frozen. Process tissue for molecular analysis.Gene expression profiling in a stage-specific manner using dynamic perturbationsCombining dynamic perturbation strategies with the FIS, which facilitates the collection of flowers at similar stages of development, affords the user with a low-cost, easy to use approach to identify stage-specific functions of their gene of interest (Figure 2A-C). The inducible transgene of choice can be crossed with the appropriate FIS or can be transformed directly into the FIS (Notes 20-21).Isolate the inducible transgene in a suitable FIS background (Note 20).Grow plants so that they bolt in a relatively synchronous manner (Note 18).Induce synchronous flowering by locally treating the ap1-1 cal-1 inflorescences (Note 22) (O'Maoileidigh et al., 2015).Divide plants into two populations: those that will be treated with the inducer and those that will be treated with a mock solution. The same strategy would be applied to any control plants being used.Treat the inflorescence to activate expression of the dynamic perturbation transgene (Note 6).Harvest whole flowers (Note 23) from approximately 20 plants per sample from hours to days after initiating the dynamic perturbation using liquid nitrogen to keep the samples frozen. Extract RNA and perform qRT-PCRs to measure the responsiveness of i) the effector molecule (e.g., amiRNA precursor, protein fusion) and ii) candidate gene(s) that will be affected by the perturbation to the inducer.",

Correlation of days after activation of synchronous flowering in the FIS with stages of flower development. After day 7-8, the flowers developing from the inflorescence are no longer synchronized. At this point, however, it is possible to distinguish them morphologically. The table indicates approximations of the developmental stages that can be harvested on the indicated day after initiation of synchronous flowering using the FIS. These approximations are based on the flower stages described in Smyth et al. (1990) and growth of the plants in continuous light.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160406/20160406225032_1974.pngPhenotyping flowers after a dynamic gene perturbationGrow plants so that they bolt in a relatively synchronous manner (Note 18).Activate the inducible promoter system with the appropriate inducer (Note 6).Dissect flowers at anthesis in the following days and phenotype them as desired. Continue this process until the flowers have produced the strongest mutant-like phenotype and the flowers return to a wild-type state.Correlate the phenotype you observed at anthesis with the stage at which the transgene was activated (Note 24).Compile a stage-dependent phenotyping series to compare with expression profiling data.ControlsWe outline the controls below that can be used for each perturbation strategy. In addition, we outline controls that are required for the inducible systems themselves.",
    "These latter controls are extremely important, as we have previously characterized the effects of these inducible systems on the transcriptome of A. thaliana (O'Maoileidigh et al., 2015).Transcriptional effector-mediated perturbations: Essential sequences in the transcriptional effector domain of choice can be mutated to produce a functionally inactive transcriptional effector domain [e.g., mSRDX (Hiratsu et al., 2004) or mVP16 (Cress and Triezenberg, 1991)]. These inactive domains can be fused to the factor of interest and expressed in an identical way to the primary experimental line. The protein-mEAR fusion should behave as a gain-of-function line. Therefore, it may also be desirable to generate an equivalent gain-of-function line that lacks an EAR motif as a control.amiRNA-mediated perturbation: We have previously described a CONTROL-amiRNA sequence that is not predicted to target any annotated A. thaliana transcript (O'Maoileidigh et al., 2015). Therefore, this CONTROL-amiRNA can be expressed in an identical manner to the primary experimental line to control for expression or phenotypic artifacts. An additional control includes generating an amiRNA-resistant version of the factor of interest by introducing synonymous mutations in the amiRNA target site of the corresponding gene. This would require the generation of an equivalent mutant plant whose phenotype is restored by an amiRNA-resistant factor.AlcR and GR-LhG4 transcription factors: These chemically responsive transcription factors have been shown to influence the expression of the A. thaliana transcriptome (O'Maoileidigh et al., 2015). Therefore, an essential control is to transform plants with T-DNAs that contain the AlcApro/AlcR or OPpro/GR-LhG4 cassettes and identify plants that express the transcription factors to a similar level to the primary experimental line.Treatment controls: All treatment controls should be partnered with a “mock” treatment. This mock treatment solution should consist of an identical mix of the solvents and surfactants used but lacking the active ingredient.",
    "An additional control includes the treatment of a wild-type line, or an equivalent line, with the active solution."
