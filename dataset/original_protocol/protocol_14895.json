    "1. SFG experimental\nUse a commercial picosecond SFG system (Table of Materials), which provides a fundamental 1064 nm beam with a pulse width of ~20 ps and a frequency of 50 Hz, based on an Nd:YAG laser.\nConvert the fundamental 1064 nm beam into a 532 nm beam and a 355 nm beam by using second and third harmonic modules. Directly guide the 532 nm beam as an input light beam and generate the other input mid-infrared (IR) beam covering the frequency range from 1000 to 4000 cm-1 through the optical parametric generation (OPG)/optical parametric amplification (OPA)/difference frequency generation (DFG) process.\nSet the incident angles of two input beams to be 53° (IR) and 64° (visible), respectively, versus the surface normal.\nTo detect the polymer interfacial structures (either film/substrate interface or film/the other medium interface), use ssp (s-polarized sum-frequency beam, s-polarized visible beam and p-polarized infrared beam) and ppp polarization combinations.\nTo detect the interfacial protein secondary structures and water structures surrounding DNA, besides ssp and ppp, use chiral spp and psp polarization combinations were used.\nTo ensure the samples were not damaged, control the infrared and visible pulse energies to be ~70 and ~30 μJ, respectively. A schematic of the SFG process with the energy level diagram was shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the SFG system in our clean room.\n2. Fresnel coefficients",
    "Use right-angle prisms as substrates for all the experiments discussed here. There exist two interfaces for a polymer film on the solid substrate, i.e., polymer surface in air and polymer/substrate interface. Both can generate SFG signals since inversion symmetry is broken at both interfaces. Therefore, a collected SFG spectrum is an interfered one. However, the local field coefficients or the Fresnel coefficients at the two interfaces can be adjustable by varying either the incident angles or the film thickness one at a time or simultaneously31,32. This provides the opportunity for us to probe the SFG vibrational signal from only one interface. Here, the PHEMA film on the CaF2 prism was taken as an example9.\nAs shown in Figure 3, employ the right-angle prism geometry to detect the SFG signals generated from the bottom PHEMA film. The SFG output intensity in the reflected mode is expressed as\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq1.jpg (1)\n\twhere  imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq2.jpg denotes the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq2.jpg consists of three parts, namely, the prism/polymer interface, the polymer/bottom medium interface (bottom medium includes gas, liquid or solid.) and the nonresonant background, as shown in the following equation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq3.jpg (2)\n\t​Here the bottom medium could be air, water or something else.

Similarly, a suitable thickness can be chosen for detection of the PHEMA/bottom medium interface with neglectable contribution from the CaF2 prism/PHEMA interface.\n3. Chiral SFG polarization combination\nFor the normal achiral interface, commonly, use C∞v symmetry in terms of ensemble average33,34. With operation of inversion symmetry, the nonzero second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor components can be deduced, which are cxxz, cxzx, czxx, cyyz, cyzy, czyy and czzz (the existing terms can be further reduced if an isotropic interface is assumed, which means x and y are the same). However, for the chiral interface, situation will be different. The chiral interface possesses the C∞ symmetry, only the rotation symmetry operation is allowed. In this case, besides the normal achiral terms, more second-order nonlinear susceptibilities will be nonzero, which can be termed as the chiral terms, namely, czyx, czxy and cyzx under the consideration of non-electronic resonance. Therefore, by using psp, pps and spp polarization combinations, chiral SFG spectra can be collected33,34.\n4. Sample preparation\nPreparation of PHEMA film\n\t\nDissolve PHEMA powder (see Table of Materials) in anhydrous ethanol to prepare the solution with 2 wt% and 4 wt% respectively.",
    "Before deposition of the PHEMA films, soak the CaF2 right-angle prisms in the toluene solvent firstly and then wash them with ethanol and ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ·cm).\nAfterwards, expose the substrates (CaF2 right-angle prisms) to oxygen plasma to remove possible organic contaminants by plasma cleaner (see Table of Materials).\n\t\t\nFirst turn on the plasma cleaner and put the substrates in it.\nThen turn on the vacuum pump to vacuumize the cleaner. Input the oxygen in it.\nFinally set 4 minutes for cleaning. After that, preserve the clean substrates for the sequential PHEMA film preparation.\nThen prepare the PHEMA films on the CaF2 prisms by a spin-coater (see Table of Materials). Adjust the film thicknesses by the solution concentration and spin speed.\n\t\t\t\nImmobilize the CaF2 prism on the sucking disc of spin-coater.\nDrop one drop of the PHEMA solution prepared before onto the clean substrates at 1,500 rpm for 1 min (film thickness 2 wt% for 100 nm and 4 wt% for 200 nm).\nAnneal all the prepared PHEMA films in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight.\nPreparation of silk fibroin (SF)\n\t​NOTE: The protocol suggested by Kaplan et al.35 was adopted.\n\t\nPlace 7.5 g of silk cocoons of B. mori in the boiling sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, 0.02 M) aqueous solution (3 L) for 30 min. Remove the fibrous SF to a clean container.\nWash the obtained fibrous SF with deionized water for three times under stirring in order to remove the sericin molecules and leave only the SF molecules in the fibrous sample.\nDry the fibrous SF sample in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight.",
    "Afterwards, dissolve the degummed fibrous SF sample in a lithium bromide (LiBr, 9.3 M) aqueous solution (1 g of  SF was solved in ~4 mL of LiBr solution.) and incubate it at 60 °C for 2 h under stirring.\nDialyze the SF solution against deionized water (3,500 Da dialysis bags) for 3 days to remove the dissolved LiBr. Change new deionized water three times every day. Finally store the processed SF solution at 4 °C for later SFG experiments.\nPreparation of short-chain oligonucleotide duplex\n\t\nOrder the single-stranded oligonucleotide sample with its 3’-end modified by cholesterol-triethylene glycol (Chol-TEG) (5’-GCTTCCGAAGGTCGA-3’) from a commercial corporation (see Table of Materials) as well as the complementary one. For each single strand, dissolve 10 nmol of the sample powder in 0.5 ml ultrapure water. Then mix them together to form the duplex oligonucleotide solution (10 nmol/mL).\nMix 2 mg of 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 2 mg of deuterated DPPC (d-DPPC) and dissolve them in 1 mL of chloroform to prepare the lipid solution.\nPreparation of DPPC & d-DPPC monolayer by a Langmuir−Blodgett (LB) trough\n\t\t\nAttach the right-angle CaF2 prism to a homemade sample holder with one prism face perpendicularly dipped into the aqueous environment of the LB trough.\nAfterwards, inject the mixed lipid solution prepared before onto the water surface until the surface pressure reached a certain value below 34 mN·m−1.\nAfter the surface pressure levels off, use two Teflon barriers to compress the lipid monolayer at a ratio of 5 mm/min until a surface pressure of 34 mN·m−1 was reached.\nLift the prism with a lipid monolayer out of the water at a rate of 1 mm/min vertically.\nPreparation of the other lipid monolayer",
    "To facilitate the assembly of the duplex oligonucleotide and the lipid molecules via the hydrophobic interaction (cholesterol and a lipid alkyl chain), mix the duplex oligonucleotide solution with the lipid solution in a molar ratio of 1:100 (oligonucleotide to lipid).\nInject the mixed lipid and duplex oligonucleotide solution onto the water surface in a homemade Teflon container until a surface pressure of 34 mN·m−1 was reached.\nFinally, put the lipid monolayer at the bottom of the prism in contact with the lipid monolayer with inserted duplex oligonucleotides on the water surface to form the final sample for the SFG measurement.\nLorentz equation\n\t\nUse the Lorentz equation to fit the SFG spectra to extract the vibrational information for a specific vibrational mode.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq26.jpg  (25)\n\t\twhere imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq27.jpg represents the intensity of the qth vibrational mode, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq28.jpg represents the resonant frequency, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq29.jpg denotes the half width at half maximum (HWHM) and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59380/59380eq30.jpg represents the scanning frequency of the incident IR beam.\nSubscription Required.
