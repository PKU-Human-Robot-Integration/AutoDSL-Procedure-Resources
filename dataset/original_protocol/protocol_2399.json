    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSection 1: Dissection of mouse placental labyrinthine zone\nTiming: 1 h per litter\nThis part describes the procedures required to isolate the placental labyrinthine zone (Lz) that contains FPEC (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Isolation of Lz eliminates the risk of contamination with endothelial cells of maternal origin. One standard litter of 6–8 embryos is required to isolate enough FPEC for n=1 biological replicate for downstream applications. The steps are performed on ice, under sterile conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2037-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation of labyrinthine zone (Lz) from E15.5 mouse placenta\n(A) Isolated gravid uterus at E15.5 mouse pregnancy.\n(B) Isolated E15.5 mouse conceptuses.\n(C) Individual E15.5 conceptus prior to opening the yolk sack.\n(D) Separated fetus (Fe), placenta (PL) and yolk sack (YS).\n(E) Fetal side view of a E15.5 placenta, with a darker, intense vascularized central area corresponding to the labyrinthine zone.\n(F) Micro-dissected labyrinthine zone (Lz), which is separated from the junctional zone (Jz) and decidua basalis (Db).\n(G) Lz collected from all E15.5 placentae in the litter.\n(H) The pooled Lz tissue after mincing into small fragments. For all panels, scale bars are 1 cm.\nIn the morning, euthanize the E15.5 pregnant female(s) by cervical dislocation.\nCritical: Avoid using inhaled CO2 or anesthetics as a method for humane euthanasia of the pregnant mouse. These methods will impair the recovery of the FPEC.\nOpen immediately the abdomen and remove the uterus using scissors, and place it into a 12 cm Petri dish containing ice-cold dissection media. Quickly place the Petri dish on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nOpen the uterus and peel off all conceptuses using a curved forceps (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nIsolate each placenta by removing the yolk sac and sectioning the umbilical cord (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E).",
    "Transfer placentas to another Petri dish filled with ice-cold dissection media, and isolate the Lz from each under a dissecting microscope, by removing the junctional zone and decidua basalis using one pair of Dumont tweezers #5 (straight) and one pair of Dumont tweezers #7 (curved) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G).\nSection 2: Preparation of placental Lz single-cell suspension\nTiming: 2 h\nThis part of the protocol describes the steps required to dissociate the isolated placental Lz into a single-cell suspension. The conditions used for the collagenase digestion (concentration, temperature, time) were optimized to maximize the isolation of single cells, while avoiding over-digestion and damaging cell membranes.\nPlace all placental Lz in a new Petri dish and wash twice with ice-cold HBSS++ solution to remove the excess blood.\nUsing scalpels or small, sharp scissors mince finely the Lz tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nPlace the entire volume of minced placental Lz tissue into a 50 mL Falcon tube filled with 20 mL pre-warmed collagenase-containing digestion solution, and incubate for 1.5 h at 37°C, with gentle rotation (35 RPM).\nNote: While cells are undergoing the 1.5 h collagenase digestion, perform the antibody coating of the beads as described in Section 3: Coating the magnetic beads with rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3], under steps 13–20. Alternatively, the coating can be done the day before (see below).\nFilter the digested tissue through a sterile 70-μm nylon mesh to remove clumps of cells or fragments of undigested tissue; press tissue through the filter with a cell lifter to ensure maximal cell recovery.\nPellet the cells by gentle centrifugation for 5 min at 260 × g in a centrifuge pre-chilled at 4°C, and then gently aspirate the supernatant (the pellet may be loose).",
    "Wash once with 20 mL ice-cold HBSS++ solution by gently re-suspending the cell pellet in 1 mL solution, followed by mixing with the remaining 19 mL. Repeat step 10.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 3 mL ice-cold Beads Buffer and transfer to a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCritical: It is important to perform one wash only (cells are fragile) and to carefully aspirate the supernatant to avoid disturbing or accidentally aspirating the cell pellet.\nNote: The volume of 3 mL Beads Buffer is recommended when working with Lz tissue isolated from one standard litter of 6–8 conceptuses. This volume should be adjusted when working with different amounts of placental tissue (e.g., 1 mL extra for a litter of 10).\nSection 3: Coating the magnetic beads with rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe procedures described in this part (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) are performed during the 1.5 h collagenase digestion (Section 2: Preparation of placental Lz single-cell suspension[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], step 8).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2037-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. FPEC isolation using antibody-coated magnetic beads\n(A) Incubation of Dynabeads pre-coated with sheep anti-rat IgG with rat anti-mouse CD31 (steps 13–20).\n(B) FPEC pulldown from the single-cell Lz suspension (steps 21–27).\nCritical: All the steps described in this part are performed at room temperature.\nResuspend the sheep anti-rat IgG magnetic beads suspension by gentle shaking, to avoid bubbles.\nFor a typical litter of eight embryos, transfer 8–10 μL of sheep anti-rat IgG Dynabeads into a sterile 2.0 mL round bottom microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: The use of 2.0 mL round bottom microcentrifuge tubes for this step is recommended in order to avoid the beads becoming stuck to the bottom of 1.5 mL conical-shaped tubes.",
    "Add 1 mL of Beads Buffer and gently mix by pipetting. Place the Eppendorf tube on the DynaMag magnetic stand and allow the separation of beads from solution (approximately 1 min). Aspirate the solution without disturbing the beads. Repeat twice (total three washes).\nRe-suspend the washed beads in 1 mL of Beads Buffer by gentle pipetting.\nAdd 1.2 μL rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody to 10 μL Dynabeads and mix by gentle pipetting.\nNote: The Dynabeads (sheep anti-rat IgG) are supplied at 4 × 108 per mL, and the concentration of the rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody is 0.5 mg/mL. 10 μL Dynabeads incubated with 1.2 μL antibody was determined as optimal for isolation of endothelial cells from one litter of eight; adjust volume if preparing for different litter size or litter number.\nAllow antibody to bind to the beads for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rotation (35 RPM), using a rotator.\nAlternatives: Steps 13–18 can be performed the day before, using an overnight incubation of the beads with the antibody (step 18) at 4°C.\nWash the beads three times, using the magnetic stand (as described in step 15) to remove the unbound antibody.\nAfter the three washes, re-suspend the beads in the Beads Buffer, using the original volume (8–10 μL) and immediately add to the digested placental tissue (see step 21) or keep on ice until needed.\nSection 4: Isolation of pure FPEC\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis part of the protocol describes the steps to isolate FPEC from the single-cell suspension prepared in steps 6–12 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAdd the coated beads (step 20) to the 15 mL Falcon tube containing the single-cell placental Lz suspension (step 12).",
    "Incubate the Falcon tube for 1 h at 4°C with slow rotation (35 RPM) to allow the binding of FPEC to the CD31-coated beads.\nAfter incubation, transfer the beads + cells suspension into three 2 mL microfuge tubes with round bottom, placed on the DynaMag magnetic rack. Beads and bound cells are collected by the magnet, and after 1 min the bead-free suspension is removed.\nWash beads in each tube in 1 mL room temperature Beads Buffer by removing from the magnet, gently pipetting to avoid foam or bubbles. Place the tubes back on the magnetic rack for 1 min and carefully aspirate the bead-free Beads Buffer.\nNote: The presence of BSA in the Beads Buffer makes it foamy. Bubbles can lead to loss of beads and cells.\nTo pool all beads into one single tube for the remaining washes, remove tubes from the magnet and resuspend beads from one tube in 1 mL Beads Buffer, transfer to the second one, gently mix the two aliquots of beads, and finally transfer again to the last tube – all beads are now suspended in 1 mL of Beads Buffer.\nWash three more times as in step 24, with 1 mL room temperature Beads Buffer each time.\nRe-suspend the bead-bound cells in 1 mL FPEC growth medium without heparin, pre-warmed at 37°C.\nSection 5: Culture and passage of FPEC\nTiming: 10–14 days\nThe procedures described in this part allow for the optimal culture and expansion of FPEC isolated as per steps 21–27 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2037-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Ex vivo culture of E15.5 FPEC",
    "Each panel shows representative images of primary FPEC at various stages of growth post-isolation: D0 – day zero – shows clusters of FPEC with antibody-coated Dynabeads attached to their surface; D4 – day 4 – attached FPEC after the removal of dead cells; D6 – D10 FPEC at various levels of cell confluence (full confluence at D10) with beads visible as dark clusters. Scale bars are 100 μm.\nTransfer bead-bound cells to two wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate and add 1.5 mL FPEC growth medium without heparin for a total of 2 mL media/well.\nIncubate the plate in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C, under 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nNote: 5% O2 mimic the average physiological oxygen tension found in the placenta, and this was found to significantly improve the yield of FPEC, and prevents metabolic and functional adaptations to hyperoxia.\nCritical: Primary endothelial cells may take time to adhere, and to ensure cell adherence and reduce cell loss, growth medium should not be changed for at least four days.\nAfter the cells attach, gently aspirate the medium, and perform an additional wash, with 1 mL FPEC growth medium without heparin, to remove the dead cells.\nFeed the cells with 2 mL FPEC growth medium without heparin per well every other day until the cells reach 70%–80% confluence.\nNote: FPEC are ready for first passage around 10 days after seeding.\nTo passage the cells, remove the media and add 0.2 mL Accutase, pre-warmed at 37°C. Incubate for 5 min at 37°C, until the cells detach.\nNote: Accutase is efficient in detaching endothelial cells and is suitable for downstream experiments, such as flow cytometry-based analyses.",
    "Alternatives: Instead of Accutase, FPEC can be detached using a trypsin-EDTA solution. Incubation times depend on trypsin concentration (2–3 min for a 0.25% trypsin solution; 5–6 min for a 0.05% trypsin solution).\nAdd 1.8 mL media into the well and transfer the cells into a microcentrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 260 × g for 3 min. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend cell pellet evenly in 1 mL of FPEC growth medium with heparin.\nAdd 0.5 mL cell suspension (obtained at the end of step 34) into two wells of a new 6-well tissue culture plate and place back in the incubator.\nNote: Some beads remain present after the first or even the second passage, because the Accutase treatment is not 100% efficient in detaching them from FPEC. Usually, persistent beads do not interfere with cell growth or with downstream experiments.\nCritical: Ideal split ratio for FPEC is 1:2. Do not split FPEC at low density, as this will compromise their ability to survive and expand.\nSection 6: CD31 staining of FPEC on coverslips\nTiming: 6–7 days\nThis part describes the procedures that are required to assess purity of the endothelial cell preparations by immunofluorescence staining.\nPlace sterilized coverslips into the desired number of wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate.\nAdd 400 μL of the gelatin-coating solution. Incubate the coverslips for 10 min at room temperature inside a laminar flow hood.\nRemove the gelatin-coating solution by gentle aspiration. Air-dry the coverslips for 15 min.\nSeed approximately 5,000 cells in 500 μL of FPEC growth medium with heparin in each well containing gelatin-coated coverslips.",
    "Incubate the plate in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C, under 5% CO2 and 5% O2 for approximately 4–5 days, until the cells reach the desired density (80%). Feed the cells on alternate days.\nRemove the culture media from each well by gentle aspiration and wash twice with 500 μL PBS.\nAdd 500 μL of 2% formaldehyde solution (in PBS) to each well. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nNote: To avoid detachment of endothelial cells due to the change in surface tension during step 42, an alternative method is to pre-fix the cells by adding 500 μL of 4% formaldehyde solution directly into the culture medium. After 2 min, replace the pre-fixation culture medium with 500 μL of 2% formaldehyde solution and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. This alternative fixation method replaces steps 41 and 42.\nWash the wells twice with 500 PBS μL for 5 min at room temperature.\nBlock non-specific staining by adding 400 μL of blocking buffer (10% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS). Incubate for 45 min at room temperature.\nRemove the blocking buffer. No rinsing is necessary.\nDilute the unconjugated primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-CD31) 1:50 in staining buffer, supplemented with 1% normal donkey serum. Add 400 μL per well and incubate overnight at 2°C–8°C.\nNote: Each staining experiment should include at least one negative control well, using the polyclonal rabbit IgG antibody (isotype control) diluted 1:50 in staining buffer, supplemented with 1% normal donkey serum, to identify non-specific staining caused by non-specific secondary antibody binding.\nNext morning, wash twice with 400 μL of PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 5 min per wash, at room temperature.",
    "Dilute the secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit-AF594) 1:250 in staining buffer, supplemented with 1% normal donkey serum. Add 400 μL to each well. Incubate at room temperature for 1 h in the dark.\nNote: From this step forward, all incubations should be performed in the dark.\nWash two times in 400 μL PBS-T (5 min each).\nAdd 300 μL of 5 μM DAPI solution in PBS to each well. Incubate 2–5 min at room temperature.\nRinse once with PBS and once with water (5 min each).\nCarefully remove the coverslips from the wells and blot to remove any excess water. Dispense 1 drop of antifade mountant onto the microscope slide per coverslip. Mount the coverslip with the cells facing towards the microscope slide.\nVisualize using a confocal microscope (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). On a Leica SP8 confocal microscope, use 405 nm excitation and 425–465 nm emission to detect DAPI, and 580 nm excitation and 600–615 nm emission to detect AF594.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2037-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Immunofluorescent staining of FPEC grown on coverslips\n(A) Staining for the endothelial cell marker CD31 (also known as PECAM1).\n(B) Negative control – FPEC incubated with polyclonal rabbit IgG. For both panels, DAPI stains the DNA in the nucleus; scale bars are 20 μm.\nNote: The slides can also be stored in a slide box at 4°C, protected against light, for later examination. If the coverslips are sealed with nail varnish, the fluorophores are stable for at least two months.\nSection 7: Flow cytometry analysis of FPEC for CD31 protein expression\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis part describes the procedures required to assess the purity of the endothelial cell preparations by flow cytometry.\nWhen FPEC reach confluence in one well of a 6-well plate, remove the culture media and wash each well twice with 1 mL PBS at room temperature.",
    "Note: When confluent, expect around 1–1.5 million FPEC/well.\nAdd 0.2 mL Accutase per well (pre-warmed) and then incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nNote: We recommend Accutase over Trypsin/EDTA digestion as method to detach FPEC prior to flow cytometry analyses, as Accutase does not remove cell-surface antigens such as CD31. Trypsin solutions require careful monitoring of the incubation time, to avoid loss of membrane-bound CD31.\nAdd 1.8 mL media into the well and transfer the cells into a microcentrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation (400 × g for 5 min at 4°C), and discard supernatant.\nWash cells once with 1 mL of 0.1% BSA in PBS, then pellet the cells as above.\nRe-suspend the cells in a small volume of PBS (e.g., 100 μL) and use a small aliquot (10 μL) to count the cells.\nNote: We recommend counting FPEC with the aid of an automated cell counting system based on the propidium iodide exclusion method (e.g., using the ADAM-MC system).\nRe-suspend the cells at 1 × 107 cells/mL in staining buffer. For each experimental sample prepare one aliquot of 1 million cells (100 μL volume) and place it in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Additionally, each experiment includes three control tubes (negative control, 7-AAD control, CD31 control) with same amount of 1 million cells each. Add another 100 μL staining buffer to all tubes, for a final volume of 200 μL to each tube.\nTo block Fc receptors, add 1 μg anti-CD16/32 antibody per 1 million cells and incubate on ice for 20 min.\nAt the end of the blocking incubation, add 0.25 μg of rat anti-mouse CD31-AF647 antibody in the CD31 control and experimental samples. Incubate all tubes on ice in the dark for 1 h.",
    "After the 1-h incubation ends, add 800 μL staining buffer to all tubes and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the cells one more time with 1 mL staining buffer.\nRe-suspend the cells in 0.5 mL PBS and filter the cells through 70-μm cell strainers into 5 mL polystyrene test tubes.\nAdd 5 μL 7-AAD solution per tube in all sample tubes and in the 7-AAD control tube and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nPerform the flow cytometry analysis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2037-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Gating strategy used for flow cytometry analysis of CD31 expression on passage one FPEC\nAfter flow cytometry gating, more than 95% of the stained cells are CD31+, demonstrating the high purity of isolated FPEC (polygonal gate in the bottom right panel). For each panel, the polygonal shapes represent the defined populations (the percentage values shown under each polygonal gate relate to the parent gate). SSC-A – side scatter area; FSC-A – forward scatter area; FSC-W forward scatter width; 7-AAD – 7-aminoactinomycin (marker of cell death)."
