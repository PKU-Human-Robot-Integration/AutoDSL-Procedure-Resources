    "Macrophage isolationObtain 500 ml of swine blood by venipuncture and treat with heparin.Incubate the blood at 37 °C for 1-2 h until you observe erythrocyte sedimentation and blood leukocyte enrichment into a supernatant plasma.Collect plasma and float over Ficoll-Paque (35 ml plasma, 10 ml Ficoll-Paque) in a 50 ml Falcon tube.Centrifuge in an Eppendorf 5810 at 367 x g for 30 min at room temperature.Collect top layers and pool into a 250 ml centrifuge bottle.Centrifuge at 7,500 x g in a Sorval SLA-1500 for 20 min at room temperature.Collect mononuclear leukocytes and wash with macrophage media by adding an equal volume of media as collected cells, inverting several times to mix.Centrifuge in an Eppendorf 5810 at 367 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Remove supernatant, and wash cells by adding 10 ml macrophage media and centrifuging as in Step 8 again for a total of three washes.Resuspend cells in 10 ml of Macrophage complete media.Plate cells into five PrimariaTM T-75 flasks (each with 1 ml of cells and 10 ml of macrophage media) and incubate overnight.Adherent cells are now considered macrophages.Detach cells using PBS EDTA, washing with 10 ml and incubating with 10 ml at 37 °C until cells detach (typically 15-20 min).Count macrophages using 10 μl of cell suspension in a hematocytometer.Plate macrophages at a density of 5 x 106 per well in PrimariaTM 6-well plates and allow to attach overnight.Infection/Transfection with CRISPR/Cas9Inoculate each well with a field isolate of ASFV, such as ASFV-G or other field isolates of ASFV, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. Inoculate by adding virus directly to the media of each well containing 2 ml of media, gently shake plates side to side to mix and incubate at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 1 h.Add 1.",
    "6 µg of donor plasmid and 1.6 µg of gRNA plasmid suspended in ddH2O to 150 µl of optiMEM in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. Carefully mix by pipetting or vortexing briefly.Add 10 µl of Fugene HD mix by pipetting and incubate for 10 min.Add dropwise 150 µl of complex to macrophages containing 2 ml of media.Incubate at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 24 h.Observe under a fluorescent microscope 24 h after transfection for your reporter gene to determine the rate of transfection. Calculate the percentage by observing both attached and unattached cells that are expressing the fluorescent marker. Freeze plate at -70 °C, and store until ready to use.Take 1 ml of frozen media from transfection to make serial 1:10 dilutions (1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000; etc.) in macrophage media.Add 100 µl of dilutions to 6 well plates of macrophages prepared as in Step B7, in a final volume of 2 ml of media. Incubate at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Observe every 24 h for complete CPE (cytopathic effect) (typically 1-7 days), mark wells that are positive for your fluorescent marker. If complete CPE occurs quickly (< 48 h) without seeing your fluorescent marker in any of the dilutions, additional dilutions may be required–further diluting the transfection allows for expression of your reporter gene.Freeze all plates as CPE occurs, and take the lowest dilution that has your recombinant gene expressed to purify further.Continue diluting and passing recombinant virus until you can observe fluorescence in all cells showing CPE. At least 5 passages are recommended. Confirm purity by the absence of the deleted gene by conducting PCR of an internal portion of the deleted gene or by Whole Genome Sequencing."
