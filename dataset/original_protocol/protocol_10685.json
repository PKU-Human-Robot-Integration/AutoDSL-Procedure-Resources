    "1. Isolation of Rat Intestine\nPrepare a 1 L solution of Phosphate Buffered Saline (Sigma, UK) with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma, UK) (PBS/AA). Fit the peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S variable speed) with two tubes. Run 70% ethanol (EtOH) through the tubes of the peristaltic pump for 15 min at maximum speed, followed by PBS/AA for another 15 min.\nEuthanize adult Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 250-350 g by CO2 inhalation and cervical dislocation in accordance with local animal guidelines and approvals (in the UK, Home Office guidelines under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986).\nAutoclave the surgical instruments before use. Spray and wipe the abdomen of the animal using 70% EtOH.\nPerform a xifo-pubic laparotomic incision on the abdomen to ensure a clear surgical field.\nEviscerate the small intestine on the right side of the animal onto a paper towel sprayed with 70% EtOH. Take care to continuously wet the intestine with PBS/AA so as to avoid dehydration of the tissue and denaturation of the extracellular matrix (ECM).\nLocate the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) arising in a 90° angle from the aorta towards the intestine. Use a 27 G cannula to enter the SMA from the aorta and quickly withdraw the needle to avoid tearing the wall of the vessel. Advance the plastic tube of the cannula into the SMA and secure using sutures (Vicryl 5/0).\nConfirm cannulation by injecting 1 ml of PBS/AA. Use spring scissors to incise the aorta proximal and distal to the SMA so as to release the cannula.",
    "To avoid leakage of feces when dissecting out the large intestine, place one (Silk 5/0) suture knot on the proximal end of the ileocaecal junction and one at the distal end of the sigmoid colon. Then cut the terminal ileum and colon between the two knots and remove the large intestine.\nCut the intestine at the jejuno-duodenal junction and free the intestine from any connective tissue connections it might have with the abdomen.\nTransfer the small intestine in a Petri dish with PBS/AA. Cannulate the proximal section of the intestine with a plastic Pasteur pipette (LSL Laboratory Consumables) and secure it in place with sutures. Cut the pipette so it will fit the Luer-Lok of a 60 ml syringe (BD Plastipak). Flush the intestinal lumen 2x with 60 ml of PBS/AA to remove feces and debris.\n2. Decellularization Methodology\nConnect the vascular cannula to a three-way stopcock. This will ease handling, minimize tension on the vascular tree and allow removal of bubbles from the tubing. \nStart running deionized water (resistivity 18.2 MΩ/cm) through the Masterflex L/S variable speed roller pump at 0.6 ml/hr. Ensure no bubbles are present within tubing prior to connecting with the intestinal lumen stopcock. Some bubbles may be present within the lumen from step 1.9, which may impair the decellularization process. Vary the speed of the pump and handle the tissue with forceps carefully to ensure the bubbles exit from the distal end. Do not connect the vascular cannula until this process is finished since high speeds may damage the vascular tree.",
    "Transfer apparatus to the cold room, since the following step of decellularization is performed at 4 °C. The low temperature allows removal of cells whilst minimizing tissue decomposition. Place the Petri dish in a container that will collect the overflowing solution. Perfuse both the intestinal lumen and the vascular tree with deionized water (resistivity 18.2 MΩ/cm) for 24 hr at 0.6 ml/hr. For the first hour check the apparatus regularly to ensure all connections are secure, leakage is minimal and no bubbles are present within the intestine.\nAfter 24 hr of treatment with deionized water, move decellularization apparatus outside the cold room as the rest of the steps are carried out in room temperature (RT).\nWeigh sodium deoxycholate (Sigma, UK) to prepare 300 ml of a 4% solution in deionized water. Weigh sodium deoxycholate under a suction hood, as it is an oral and eye irritant. Mix using a vortex until the solution is clear. The solution may be maintained at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nChange the deionized solution to sodium deoxycholate, check the connections, remove any bubbles and perfuse at 0.6 ml/hr for 4 hr.\nFollowing the sodium deoxycholate step wash with PBS/AA for 30 min to avoid interaction between the sodium deoxycholate and DNase-I.\nWeigh out deoxyribonuclease-I (DNase-I, Sigma) and prepare 250 ml of a 2,000 kU solution in 1 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4. Mix using a vortex until the solution is clear. This solution must be prepared immediately before use and can't be stored.\nPerfuse with DNase-I for 3 hr at RT at a speed of 0.6 ml/hr.\nFollowing the DNase-I step, transfer the scaffold into a tissue culture hood and change plates and instruments. It is suggested to use aseptic technique.",
    "Wash with PBS/AA for 30 min to ensure all remnants of the decellularization solutions are removed. Place the scaffold in a new Petri dish and transfer to a UV Crosslinker (Spectroline, US). Run two sterilization cycles. Store in 5% PBS/AA and change the solution every 3 days."
