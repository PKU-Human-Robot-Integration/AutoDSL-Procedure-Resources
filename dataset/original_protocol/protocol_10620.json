    "1. Cell Culture Preparation\nStore NIH/3T3 cell stocks in liquid nitrogen until ready for use.\nPrepare complete media for NIH/3T3 cells using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin.\nThaw cells for 2-3 min in a shaking water bath at 37 °C.\nResuspend cells in 5 ml of complete media and centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 3 min.\nRemove the cell supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cells in 5 ml of media and count cells using a hemocytometer.\n\t\nRemove 10 μl of the cell suspension and place in a 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 10 μl of Trypan Blue to the cell suspension and stir with the tip of the pipette.\nPipette 10 μl of the stained cells into a hemocytometer chamber.\nCount cells in hemocytometer at 10x magnification.\n\t\t\nCount the live cells (small, white balls) for 4 of the 9 large squares. Only count the live cells that do not appear dark blue from the Trypan Blue stain.\nCalculate the average number of cells per large square, resulting in the number of cells x 104 cells/ml in the original cells suspension.\nSeed cells at a density of 1 x105 cells/ml with a total of 5 ml in each T25 flask.\nCulture cells to between 70% and 80% confluency before beginning experiments. Refresh media every 2-3 days or as needed.\n2. Printing Surface Preparation\nMark a rectangle with marker on the bottom of a tissue-culture-treated polystyrene (TCTPS) 12 well plate the size of the print head (7 mm x 19 mm).\nPipette 50 μl of fetal bovine serum into the rectangular area and spread it over the entire region with the tip.",
    "Leave the Petri dish in a sterile biosafety hood O/N to allow the serum spot to dry completely. These plates should be prepared no more than 2 days prior to use.\n3. Submerged Printing\nRinse the print head out with distilled water.\n\t\nFill a 60 mm Petri dish with distilled water and dock the print head onto the surface.\nFlow distilled water through each of the lines for 2 min at 150 μl/min using a pneumatic pump.\nDiscard the water from the Petri dish and fill it with clean water.\nMove the print head up and down in the water 3 times.\nDock the print head center over the serum-coated spot in the pre-prepared 12 well plate.\nPrime the print head with pre-warmed complete media, 300 μl per channel.\nPrint suspended cells at a concentration of 50,000 cells/ml onto the surface and 60 μl/min, 100 μl per channel.\nPlace the print head, left docked against the surface, and the manifold in a cell culture incubator set to 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 2 hr.\nAfter the 2 hr incubation, remove the print head and place the lid on the culture dish. The time at which the print head removed is considered the 0 hr time point.\n4. Standard Cell Culture\nAdd 1 ml of pre-warmed media to one of the serum-spotted TCTPS 12-well plate prepared in step 2.\nTake 1 ml of the remaining cell suspension from step 2 and pipette into a single well of a 12-well TCTPS plate. This will produce a culture containing 50,000 cells in the dish.\nPlace the cell culture plate in an incubator at 37 °C for 2 hr.\nAfter the 2 hr incubation begin timing; for consistency between printed and seeding samples, this is considered the 0 hr time point.",
    "5. Culture Visualization\nAfter 0, 2, 24, and 48 hr take cells from each of the two methods described above and image using a standard inverted microscope.\n\t\nStain the cells using propidium iodide, a red fluorescent stain that is only incorporated into the nucleus of dead cells.\n\t\t\nGently rinse the cells 3 times with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline with calcium and magnesium (PBS++) to remove any debris.\nAdd 1 ml of pre-warmed PBS++ to each culture vessel.\nAdd 1 μl of propidium iodide stock solution (1 mg/ml) to each culture vessel.\nIncubate the cells stained with propidium iodide at 37 °C for 10 min.\nImage the cells using an inverted microscope at 10x and 40x magnification.\nDiscard the cells in an appropriate biohazard container.\nSubscription Required.
