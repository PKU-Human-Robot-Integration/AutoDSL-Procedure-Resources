    "1. Make the PDMS Layer (Figure 1)\nVigorously mix PDMS and curing agent in a 10:1 ratio. To remove bubbles, degas the viscous mixture in a vacuum chamber for 1 hr at room temperature.\nOn a scale, pour the PDMS slowly over the aluminum mold. Pour from the center and keep the mold leveled. Make sure to leave the pins uncovered. Stop pouring once target weight is achieved.\nOur mold requires 4 g of PDMS and 0.4 g of curing reagent.\nLevel the mold inside an oven, and cure at 37 °C overnight.\nAlternative curing times are 2 hr at 60 °C or 1 hr at 90 °C.\nDissect the cured PDMS layer along the edge of the mold and carefully peel it off of the mold surface with a pair of forceps. Clean the mold surface with 70% ethanol and a Q-tip.\n2. Assemble the Flow Cell According to Figure 2\nStandard assembly of PDMS with glass slides is done through oxygen plasma treatment of both surfaces, which ensures leak-free bonding between the PDMS and microscope glass slide. In the presented protocol, the plasma treatment would destroy the chemical coating on the glass slide. Therefore the slide is pressure-sealed rather than plasma treated.\nPlace the glass window into the flow cell pocket.\nLay a coated glass slide over the glass window inside the pocket of the flow cell with the active side up, and place the PDMS layer with channels facing down on top of it. Place the PDMS slide in such a way that channel inputs align with the through-holes in the metal plate. Gently push the air out from between the layers.\nFlip the PDMS/glass slide assembly so that the PDMS faces the glass window. Overlap the PDMS channel inputs with the through-holes in the metal plate.",
    "Place the pressure plate on top and tighten the screws.\nPlace the assembled flow cell under the microscope. Set the microscope magnification to 60X and prealign the channel positions.\n3. Prepare Log Phase Bacteria\nDay before the experiment: Inoculate 50 ml of Mueller Hinton broth containing 2% NaCl (MH2) with a bacterial colony. Shake at 250 rpm overnight at 37 °C.\nOne or two bacterial strains can be studied in one experiment for the described set-up.\nPrior to experiment: Mix 50 µl of overnight bacteria culture into 50 ml of MH2 media. Shake at 250 rpm for 3 hr at 37 °C to ensure the bacteria are in log phase.\n4. Warm the Experimental Solution Components at Least 10 Minutes Before They are Needed\nThaw the fluorescent dye (5 mM stock) and lysostaphin (10 µg/ml stock) at room temperature.\nWarm the oxacillin powder to room temperature.\n5. Prepare and Load the Bacterial Suspension\nAfter the end of 3 hr subculture: Take 10 ml of bacteria culture and centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend bacteria in 1 ml of fresh MH2 media.\nAttach a short length of tubing to a 1 ml Luer lock syringe. Flush the syringe tubing with 1 ml of media. Leave a little bit of media in the tubing to avoid air bubbles when drawing in the bacterial suspension.\nLoad 0.7 ml of bacteria type 1 into the syringe. Fill two channels of the flow cell with bacteria type 1. Watch for the liquid to appear on the other side of the channel after ca. 150 µl.\nThe transparency of the channel changes as it is filled with bacteria.",
    "If experimenting with multiple bacteria types, repeat the loading procedure for bacteria type 2 into the two remaining channels of the flow cell.\nPlace the flow cell inside the incubator at 37 °C for 45 min to allow bacterial settling and attachment to the slide surface.\n6. Prepare and Load the Experimental Solutions\nPrepare 140 µl of 0.5 mM fluorescent dye solution by mixing 14 µl of fluorescent dye stock (5 mM) and 126 µl of MH2 media.\nDilute 10 mg of oxacillin in 40 ml of MH2 media to obtain a final concentration of 250 µg/ml oxacillin.\nPrepare 130 ml of control solution with final concentrations of 0.25 µM fluorescent dye and 0.7 ng/ml of lysostaphin. To do so, mix 65 µl of fluorescent dye (0.5 mM), 9.12 µl of lysostaphin stock (10 µg/ml) and 130 ml of MH2 media.\nPrepare 130 ml of antibiotic solution with final concentrations of 0.25 µM fluorescent dye, 0.7 ng/ml of lysostaphin, and 50 µg/ml oxacillin. To do so, mix 65 µl of fluorescent dye (0.5 mM), 9.12 µl of lysostaphin stock (10 µg/ml), 26 ml of oxacillin (250 µg/ml) and 104 ml of MH2 media.\nFill two 60 ml syringes with control solution and two 60 ml syringes with antibiotic solution. Keep solutions wrapped in aluminum foil to avoid light-induced degradation of the reagents.\nOverfill the syringes to account for loss due to flushing of the tubing.\nRemove air bubbles from the syringes by flicking. Attach and fill input tubing to the tip with the experimental solution.\nMount syringes onto the pump. Place the syringe with the smallest volume first, then lock the plunger position. Fit the rest of the syringes onto the pump, squeezing their plungers as necessary.",
    "Set the pump speed to 1 ml/min and the pump volume to 60 ml. Do a flush with the pump until a steady stream of liquid is seen from all syringes.\n7. Set Up the Flow Cell Under the Microscope\nRemove the flow cell from the centrifuge and mount it onto the microscope stage (Figure 3).\nConnect input/output tubing to each of the flow cell channels (one input/one output per channel).\nCollecting output into four different containers allows for the measurement of individual channel output volumes.\n8. Run the 60 Minute Experiment\nCheck the prealigned positions from step 2.5. If the microscope field-of-view is not centered on the channel and/or is out-of-focus, adjust the settings and save the new positions.\nPrecise focusing may not be possible before flow start due to the high density of loaded bacteria.\nSet the phase contrast acquisition time to 10 msec and the fluorescence acquisition time to 1,600 msec.\nObtain phase contrast and fluorescence images for each position before initiating the flow.\nThis gives a qualitative estimate of the loaded bacterial density.\nStart the liquid flow and immediately check that the microscope is focused on the bottom of the channels.\nTake phase contrast and fluorescence images of the target areas within the first minute of flow.\nAcquire images every 2 min after the first set of images until 60 min of flow has occurred. Refocus as necessary.\n9. Disinfect the Flow Cell\nMake a 10% bleach solution in a beaker (100 ml). Fill 4 x 20 ml syringes with 10 ml of the mixture. Debubble the syringes and attach them to the flow cell.\nIt will take ~1-2 min for the channels to be clear of bacteria.\nSet the pump speed to 1 ml/min and the pump volume to 3 ml. Run for 3 min.",
    "Fill 4 x 60 ml syringes with 60 ml of DI water. Debubble the syringes and attach them to the flow cell.\nSet the pump speed to 1 ml/min and the pump volume to 30 ml. Run for 30 min.\nMonitor the channel cleaning under the microscope.\nDisassemble the flow cell. Discard the used epoxy slide. Soak the flow cell components in DI water for 20 min. Air dry.\n10. Analyze Images and Generate Data\nCount the number of bacteria in each image.\nThe open access software, CellProfiler is used to perform batch image processing16. A high level outline of the CellProfiler routine is summarized in Table 1. The number of bacteria present in the phase contrast image (Np) gives the total bacterial count. The number of bacteria visible in the fluorescence image (Nf) gives the number of dead bacteria.\nCalculate the normalized bacterial cell death percentage as a function of time.\n\t\nImport Nf and Np for individual images into the data analysis software.\nCalculate the fraction of dead bacteria in each channel at a specific time point given by the fraction (Nf / Np) at t = T.\nSubtract the fraction of dead bacteria present at the outset of the experiment (t = 1 min) for both the control and the experimental channels.\nSubtract the fraction of dead bacteria present in the control channel from that present in the experimental channel at each time point with the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50828/Data_analysis_equation.png\nGraph DPnorm vs. t for the course of the experiment.\nNote that a sample with a cell death percentage greater than 1% is deemed susceptible, while less than 0.5% death is indicative of resistance. Percentages that fall between these two cut-offs are considered indeterminate and the sample must be tested again.",
