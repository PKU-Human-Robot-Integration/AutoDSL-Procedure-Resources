Covalent cross-linking stabilizes the connection between protein and RNA residues situated in close proximity inferring the interaction between them.\nGrow cells to full confluence in 15 cm tissue culture dishes. Prepare one 15 cm confluent plate per one dCLIP pull-down. We recommend using 2 plates per sample type since, as described below, we use two RNase concentrations per every clonal cell line.\nWash cells with 10 mL ice-cold PBS.\nIrradiate cells covered in 5 mL ice-cold PBS in opened lid dish using 254 nm wavelength.\nNote: Expose monolayer cells to 150 mJ/cm2 and ES cell colonies to 400 mJ/cm2\nAdd 5 mL of ice-cold PBS and scrape cells into 15 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge to pellet cells 5 min, 1,000 g at 4°C.

    "Critical: We strongly advise conducting a small-scale dCLIP experiment prior to entering a large-scale library preparation step (See Small-scale dCLIP protocol, (Rosenberg et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10])). The small-scale protocol is similar to the membrane elution protocol described below with the following modifications. The lysate from one cross-linked 15 cm plate is divided into four equal portions that are treated with No RNase, 100 u/mL, 10 u/mL, and 2u/mL RNase respectively. The washing steps are conducted with 500 μl volumes and the 3′-end dephosphorylation step is omitted. The volumes of DNase mix and PNK mix are downscaled 4-fold. Finally, only 32P-labeled ATP is utilized at the phosphorylation step. A successful small-scale experiment for Chromobox Protein Homolog 7 (CBX7) protein is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A. Notice the clear pattern of radiolabeled RNA fragments cross-linked to CBX7 protein in dCLIP-CBX7 ( Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) compared to extremely high background signal which masked the specific pattern of CBX7 cross-linked RNAs in conventional CLIP-CBX7 (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). Another important control for small-scale experiments is a No UV control, where a dCLIP protocol is conducted on cells not treated with UV, and thus are presumed to lack a radioactive signal emanating from cross-linked RNA fragments, shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D (Rosenberg et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). In Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], we provide an example of a small-scale dCLIP experiment for Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) protein that did not exhibit a detectable dCLIP signal (Rosenberg et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) despite being recognized as a potential RNA-binding protein in other studies (Long et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). For that reason, we did not proceed further to a large-scale dCLIP experiment with EED protein.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1018-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. dCLIP vs Conventional CLIP of Polycomb proteins in mouse ES cells",

Note the lack of EED-specific dCLIP signal in both panels.\nProtected protein-RNA “footprint” preparation by partial RNase digestion\nTiming: 1–1.5 h",
    "To determine the sequence of RNA binding sites in the RNA-protein complexes, RNA molecules covalently bound to the protein of interest are trimmed to a short size range to create a characteristic RNA ‘footprint’.\nCritical: RNA fragments shorter than 50 bp are difficult to align unambiguously to the genome; therefore, it is essential to prevent excessive RNase digestion. To create the appropriate ‘Footprint’ RNA size range we tested several RNase concentrations in a preceding small-scale experiment and determined that in order to achieve an optimal size distribution of cross-linked RNA fragments, two RNase concentrations, 10 U/mL and 2 U/mL should suffice. With two cell lysates per clonal cell line, each lysate was treated with 10 U/mL and 2 U/mL RNase respectively. The eluted RNA fragments from the same clonal line are later combined prior to the library construction as described below.\nPre-thaw 2 cell pellets per sample type at 4°C and resuspend each pellet in 1.25 mL of ice-cold PBS-lysis buffer supplemented with 1 tablet of Complete-mini EDTA-free tablet, 40 U/mL Protector RNase inhibitor, 1mM Dithiothreitol (DTT).\nRotate 25 min at 4°C.\nSpin down and add 25 μL TurboDNase 2 U/μL. Roughly estimate the sample volume.\nAdd RNase I 100 U/μL to a final concentration of 10 U/mL and 2 U/mL (See Critical note above)\nIncubate 15 min in a 37°C. Gently mix samples every 5 min.\nSpin down, add 48 U SUPERaseIN, and adjust the SDS concentration to a final 0.1% to terminate RNase I activity.\nNote: SUPERaseIN is used in this step for its ability to inhibit RNase I, compared to other common RNase inhibitors. 0.1% SDS is also intended to inactivate RNase I according to manufacturer instructions.",
    "Optional: We observed that pulling down proteins that are tightly bound to chromatin, such as EZH1 and JARID2 is facilitated by using a higher concentration of SDS.\nIn step 11, adjust the SDS concentration to 1% SDS instead of 0.1% and rotate samples for 5 min at 21°C–24°C.\nContinue with steps 12–15 at 21°C–24°C instead of 4°C.\nCentrifuge samples twice, 10 min, 21,130g at 4°C to remove residual cell debris.\nTransfer supernatant to new 2 mL tubes.\nNote: In the next steps magnetic Protein G Dynabeads (G-beads) are used for pre-clearing of the lysate from the proteins and nucleic acids binding non-specifically to magnetic beads whereas magnetic Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (C1-beads) are used for isolating the RNA-biotinylated protein complexes from cell lysates. Prior to use, thoroughly mix beads and aliquot the volume needed for the total number of samples. Prepare 80 μL beads per sample and use a magnetic separator to separate beads from the supernatant. All bead washes are done with ice-cold buffer at 21°C–24°C.\nPre-clearing of cell lysates.\nAliquot the volume G-beads needed for the total number of samples. Remove supernatant.\nWash G-beads twice with 1 mL of PBS-lysis buffer.\nResuspend G-beads in 150 μL PBS-lysis buffer per sample multiplied by the number of samples.\nTransfer 150 μL G-beads to 2 mL tubes. Remove supernatant.\nAdd cell lysates to pre-clearing beads. Mix well and rotate 1 h at 4°C.\nPull-down biotinylated proteins with C1-beads.\nWash C1-beads 3 times in 1 mL PBS-lysis buffer + 0.5% BSA.\nResuspend C1-beads in 150 μL PBS lysis buffer + 0.5% BSA per sample multiplied by the number of samples.\nTransfer 150 μL C1-beads to 2 mL tubes. Remove supernatant.\nCapture pre-clearing G-beads (step 14e) on the magnetic separator and transfer the supernatant to C1-beads tubes.",
    "Mix well and rotate for 2 h at 4°C.\nDenaturing stringent washes\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nUsing the biotin-streptavidin high interaction strength property (Kd=10−15 M, (Weber et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])), the dCLIP protocol was uniquely designed to enable extremely stringent washes. The washing step efficiently removes non-covalently bound RNA species and proteins thus significantly reducing the background signal commonly observed in conventional CLIP protocols that rely on antibody-antigen interactions ( Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: All wash steps are done in 1.2 mL volume rotating for 5 minutes. Use a magnetic separator to capture the beads and discard the supernatant. The wash buffers do not include RNase inhibitors and rely on the presence of 0.1% SDS (or higher concentration) which irreversibly inactivate RNase I (See manufacturer’s instructions, https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012009_RNase_I_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUk5hc2UgSQ==[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%253A%252F%252Fassets.thermofisher.com%252FTFS-Assets%252FLSG%252Fmanuals%252FMAN0012009_RNase_I_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUk5hc2UgSQ==]).\nWash samples twice in PBS-Urea wash buffer at 21°C–24°C.\nWash samples twice PBS-SDS wash buffer at 21°C–24°C.\nWash once in PBS high-salt wash buffer at 4°C.\nWash once in PBS low-salt wash buffer at 4°C.\nDNase treatment\nThe dCLIP protocol distinctively includes three DNase treatment steps. The first DNase treatment in step 8 promotes the dissociation of proteins tightly bound to chromatin such as CBX7 (El Messaoudi-Aubert et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The second DNase treatment, similar to conventional CLIP protocols, aims to remove all DNA linked to RNA-protein of interest complexes since the UV crosslinking step crosslinks nucleic acid residues, RNA and DNA alike, to associated proteins. In the third DNase treatment, added here, the naked RNA molecules at the end of the precipitation step are treated to remove any DNA contaminates immediately prior to library construction (Darnell, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nResuspend the beads in 800 μL 1xDNase buffer and transfer to 1.5 mL tubes.\nNote: This step aims to remove the remaining detergents used in previous wash steps that might inhibit the DNase activity.",
    "Rotate 5 min at 4°C. Capture C1-beads and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the C1-beads in 160 μL of DNase mix and rotate 30 min at 37°C.\nSpin down briefly to collect the liquid retained in the lid back to the main volume, capture C1-beads, and discard the supernatant.\nWash C1-beads once in PBS low-salt wash buffer. Rotate 5 min at 4°C.\n3′-end dephosphorylation, 5′-end phosphorylation, and RNA extraction\nTiming: 1.5–2.5 h\nTiming: 3–4 h for membrane RNA elution\nThe 3′-end dephosphorylation and 5′-phosphorylation (steps 25 and 26) prepare the RNA fragments for proper ligation of 5′ and 3′ adapters in the library construction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6] section.\nCritical: RNA extraction can be done directly from C1-beads or after running the samples on an SDS-PAGE gel. Direct RNA elution from C1-beads can be done on cell lines growing in monolayer such as HEK293, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and differentiating mouse ES cells. It is recommended to use the optional Membrane RNA elution step for undifferentiated mouse ES colonies grown on a feeder layer (McElroy and Reijo Pera, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nIn our experience, there’s a significantly higher background due to non-specific RNA binding when undifferentiated mouse ES colonies RNA is eluted directly from beads, as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1018-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Comparison between bead elution and membrane elution dCLIP methods",
    "dCLIP libraries for CBX7 were prepared in Day 0 undifferentiated ES cells growing in colonies on feeder layer (A) and differentiating Day 7 ES cells growing in monolayer (B). The libraries were sequenced, aligned to reference mouse genome and the RNA binding profiles for CBX7-expressing cells vs control cells were generated and visualized in Integrative Genomic Viewer. Dusp9 RNA dCLIP profile in Day 0 cells (A) and Day 7 cells (B) were examined to assess differences between two RNA extraction methods – elution directly from beads vs. SDS-PAGE purification, nitrocellulose membrane transfer, and elution of RNA from the membrane. Note that control cells exhibited a very high background signal after beads elution protocol had been applied in Day 0 cells but not in Day 7 cells. RING1 And YY1 Binding Protein (RYBP) protein served as a control for dCLIP specificity since, compared to CBX7, RYBP is predicted to possess low RNA binding activity (Tavares et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nNote: All washes are done for 5 min, rotating at 21°C–24°C.\n3′ end dephosphorylation\nWash C1-beads once in 1 mL Low pH PNK buffer.
