  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All of the procedures described here were reviewed and approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Biosafety Committee (protocol # 13-056) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol # 13-064).\n1. Preparation of Dye\nDilute 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue in PBS and filter sterilize using a 0.45 µM syringe filter.\n2. Preparation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Culture\n15 hrs before instillation, inoculate 3 ml of broth culture with a single bacterial colony.\nGrow the culture 15 hr at 37 °C on a shaker (200 rpm).\nCentrifuge 1 ml of culture in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube 12,000 x g for 30 sec.\nRemove the medium and resuspend the pellet in 1ml of PBS.\nDilute an aliquot of the bacterial stock suspension 1:10 in PBS and measure the OD600 of the diluted bacterial suspension to determine the bacterial concentration.\nDilute the bacterial stock suspension in PBS to the desired concentration of bacterial inoculum, using a delivery volume of 50 µl for IMIT inoculation.\n3. IMIT Instillation\nPlace a group of mice into isoflurane anesthesia induction chamber and anesthetize using a 2 - 3% isoflurane/oxygen mixture.\nAt the initial onset of sedation, scruff the mouse, holding the mouse upright, and administer 10 µl of a 2% lidocaine solution by gavage needle to the back of the throat and allow the solution to drain down to the epiglottis. Return the mouse to the anesthesia chamber.\n\t\nAllow a minimum of 5 min to permit the lidocaine to take full effect as a local anesthetic.\nWhen mice have achieved desired level of sedation (breathing rate of ~60 bpm), reduce the isoflurane to 2% to maintain sedation.\nPreload dye or bacterial inoculum into a 250 µl gas-tight precision syringe fit with a 22 G long blunt needle.",
    "First draw up 150 µl of air, measured by the Teflon plunger of the syringe. Next, draw up 50 µl of inoculum by advancing the Teflon plunger from the 150 µl mark to the 200 µl mark on the syringe body.\n\t\tNOTE: When the sample is ejected into an intubated mouse, the 50 µl suspension will be delivered first, followed by a 150 µl air cushion which will distribute the inoculum throughout the lung.\nRemove one mouse from the induction chamber and lay supine on an intubation platform. Secure the mouse to the platform by hooking its incisors with an O-ring attached to Velcro strip, and securing the Velcro to the platform. Raise the mouse to a 45° incline.\nUsing a micro cotton applicator, retract the tongue with a rolling motion, using the dominant hand.\nWith the nondominant hand, use an operating otoscope fit with an intubation specula to both maintain tongue retraction and visualize the glottis.\nWith the dominant hand, use a guide wire threaded through a 20 G catheter to intubate the mouse, seating the catheter to a 10 mm depth into the mouse trachea (catheter is fit with a silicon sleeve with 10 mm of exposed catheter). Remove the otoscope/specula.\nConfirm that the mouse has been correctly intubated by securing the catheter with the nondominant hand while briefly attaching a Luer connected length of 1/16” clear tubing containing a colored dye.\n\tNOTE: The dye will rapidly migrate back and forth in response to breathing.\nDo not proceed with subsequent steps if confirmation of intubation has not been established at this point. If the intubation attempted failed, reset the catheter and guide wire for one additional attempt at intubation.",
    "NOTE: It is unadvisable to attempt more than two intubations of a mouse in one session without causing trauma to the mouse.\nContinue to secure the catheter with the nondominant hand while inserting the precision syringe/blunt needle containing the liquid suspension/air cushion.\nDispense the liquid/air directly into the lung in a single fluid motion and immediately remove the needle/catheter from the mouse.\nReturn the mouse to a cage and allow recovery from anesthesia.\n4. Characterization of IMT Delivery\nAfter IMIT instillation, euthanize the mouse by CO2 asphyxia at an appropriate time post-inoculation.\nSecure the euthanized mouse on a dissection board and soak the chest and abdomen with 70% EtOH using a squirt bottle.\nIf evaluating distribution of an imaging agent throughout the lung, remove the lungs from the animal using sterile technique and display the lungs as appropriate for imaging.\n\tNOTE: Lungs may be prepared for additional histological staining techniques through appropriate fixation or cryopreservation.\nIf evaluating the bacterial burden of infected lung tissue, remove the lungs from the animal using sterile technique. Place lungs into a sterile, preweighed 1 oz sample bag. Weigh and record the weight of the sample bag + lungs.\n\t\nAdd 1 ml of sterile 1x PBS to each sample bag+ tissues. Reseal sample bag.\nHomogenize tissues by gentle rolling a 25 ml serological pipette over the sample bag + tissue.\nGenerate serial dilutions of the lung homogenate in sterile PBS and plate on agar plate (LB, or as appropriate to the bacterial species being studied):\n\t\t\nConduct a six fold serial dilution in a U-bottom 96 well plate by multichannel pipettor then plate triplicate samples by multichannel on the agar plate.\nIncubate agar plates overnight at 37 °C and enumerate colony forming units the next day."
