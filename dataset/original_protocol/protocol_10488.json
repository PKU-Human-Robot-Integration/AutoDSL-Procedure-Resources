    "The experiments for device fabrication, skin lamination, and characterization shown in Figures 1, 2, and 4 involved two volunteers, all performed in the Bio-interfaced NanoEngineering Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Richmond, VA, USA. This study was approved by the VCU Institutional Review Board (protocol number: HM20001454) and followed the research guidelines from the VCU Human Research. The device and clinical data shown in Figures 3 and 5 were acquired from the published article10 where the experiments on patients were conducted under the protocol (number: STU69718) approved by the Institutional Review Board, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.\n1. Device Fabrication  \nNOTE: Figure 2 presents schematic illustrations for the overall fabrication process.\nPrepare a carrier substrate\n\t\nCut a bare 3 in silicon (Si) wafer into the desired size of the electronics by using a diamond blade.\n\t\tNOTE: About half Si wafer gives an ideal size for the wound device.\nDegrease Si wafer with acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Rinse the wafer with deionized (DI) water and then dry with nitrogen and dehydrate on a hotplate at 110 °C for 3 min.\nPrepare 11 g of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixture with 10:1 volume ratio of base and curing agent and degas the mixture in a vacuum chamber for an hour.\n\t\tNOTE: PDMS is used for a dry pattern retrieval and transfer printing after the microfabrication, which is preferable to the wet chemical (acetone)-based approach from the previous study7.\nSpin coat 5 g of mixed PDMS solution on the wafer at 3,000 rpm for 1 min and fully cure on a hotplate at 150 °C for 30 min.\nDeposit materials and pattern electronics\n\t\nTreat the PDMS-coated wafer with ultraviolet (UV)/ozone by using a UV lamp (8.9 mW/cm2) for 3 min to make the surface hydrophilic.",
    "NOTE: The hydrophilic surface offers uniform coating of additional layers on the PDMS.\nSpincoat polyimide (PI; 2 ml) on the PDMS coated wafer, by pipetting, at 4,000 rpm for 1 min to form a 1.2-µm-thick layer, pre-bake on a hotplate at 150 °C for 5 min, and post-bake at 250 °C for 2 hr.\nDeposit chromium (Cr) to form a 20 nm-thick layer and then deposit copper (Cu) to form a 3 µm-thick layer by using electron-beam (e-beam) evaporation (base pressure: ~1×10-7 Torr, deposition pressure: ~1×10-6 Torr, deposition rate: 1 – 5 Å/s). Monitor the film thickness by the deposition controller interface embedded in the evaporator.\n\t\tNOTE: The thick layer of Cu provides enough levels of electrical conductivity on the microscale resistors of the device and thin Cr layer is used to promote adhesion between PI and Cu.\nSpincoat a photoresist (2 ml) with three steps at 900 rpm for 10 sec, 1,100 rpm for 60 sec, and 4,000 rpm for 20 sec and then cure it on a hotplate at 75 °C for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The sequential steps described above were used to deposit a thick (> 10 µm) photoresist.\nAlign Cu electronic patterns (sensors; fractal ‘Peano’ design with 35 µm in width and interconnects; serpentine open mesh design with 50 µm in width) at the center of the Si wafer by using a UV aligner (power: 10 mW/sec) with exposure time 25 s.\n\t\tNOTE: The fractal structures are used to provide superior mechanical stretchability, compared to merely meandering features14.\nDevelop the photoresist in a diluted base developer (1:2 ratio of developer and DI water) for a minute, rinse with DI water, and dry with nitrogen. Inspect the patterns (Cu fractals and interconnects) using a microscope to confirm the feature size and find any defects from particulates.",
    "NOTE: If there are any unwanted defects, then remove photoresist by rinsing with acetone/IPA/DI water. After drying with nitrogen, repeat the steps from 1.2.4 to 1.2.6.\nEtch the Cu layer on the Si wafer by immersing in a wet chemical etchant for ~6 min (10 ml; mixture of ammonium persulfate and water in ratio of 1:4; etch rate of 8 nm/sec in 40 °C), rinse with DI water, and dry with nitrogen. Inspect the patterns using a microscope for any over-etched patterns.\n\t\tNOTE: If the patterns are over-etched, it may cause unwanted sharp edges of the features, which could lead to mechanical fracture during device handling and washing process. The prior testing results showed that more than ~20% over-etching of the original patterns caused the aforementioned issues.\nEtch the Cr layer with reactive ion etching (RIE; pressure: 300 mTorr, power: 200 W, CF4 gas: 5 sccm, O2 gas: 10 sccm) for 5 min. Inspect the patterns.\n\t\tNOTE: For etching of the Cr layer, the RIE process is preferable to wet chemical etching that causes unfavorable reaction with the Cu layer.\nRemove the remained photoresist on the metal layers by immersing the wafer in acetone (10 ml), IPA (10 ml), and DI water (20 ml), respectively. Then, dry it with nitrogen.\nSpincoat PI (2 ml) on the metal deposited wafer, by pipetting, at 4000 rpm for 1 min to form a 1.2-µm-thick layer, pre-bake on a hotplate at 150 °C for 5 min, and post-bake at 250 °C for 2 hr.\nSpincoat a photoresist (2 ml) with three steps at 900 rpm for 10 sec, 1,100 rpm for 60 sec, and 4,000 rpm for 20 sec and then cure it on a hotplate at 75 °C for 30 min.",
    "Align PI patterns to encapsulate the Cu electronics (sensors; fractal ‘Peano’ design with 35 µm in width and interconnects; serpentine open mesh design with 250 µm in width) with the pre-defined Cu fractals and interconnects by using a UV aligner (power: 10 mW/sec) with exposure time 25 sec.\nDevelop the photoresist with a diluted developer (1:2 ratio of developer and DI water) for a minute, rinse with DI water, and dry with nitrogen. Inspect the patterns using a microscope to confirm the feature size and find any defects from particulates.\n\t\tNOTE: If there are any unwanted defects, then remove photoresist by rinsing with acetone/IPA/DI water. After drying with nitrogen, repeat the steps from 1.2.10 to 1.2.13.\nEtch the PI layer with RIE (pressure: 170 mTorr, power: 150 W, O2 gas: 20 sccm) for 25 min. Inspect the patterns.\nRemove the remained photoresist by immersing the wafer in acetone (10 ml), IPA (10 ml), and DI water (20 ml), respectively. Then, dry it with nitrogen.\nPrepare an elastomeric membrane\n\t\nPrepare a 10 g of encapsulating silicone mixture (1:1 volume ratio of base and curing agent) and add a black ink15 with one to one volume ratio, which is to facilitate control measurements of temperature variation on the skin using an infrared camera.\n\t\tNOTE: The utilized silicone (clear encapsulating rubber) provides unique characteristics of low viscosity, optical clarity, and electrical isolation/protection to the device16.\nSpincoat 8 g of the mixture in a petri dish at 150 rpm for 1 min to form a 500 µm thick elastomeric membrane and cure at RT for O/N.\n\t\tNOTE: The material needs to be placed on a flat surface for uniform thickness.",
    "Cut the membrane into the desired size of 70 mm x 30 mm by using a sharp razor blade and gently detach it from the petri dish.\nRetrieve and transfer electronics\n\t\nCut a water soluble tape (25 mm x 80 mm) and gently laminate onto the fabricated electronic patterns and place them on a hotplate at 130 °C for 3 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Temperature elevation expands the PDMS layer on the Si wafer to help dissociation of the electronic patterns from the surface.\nDetach the tape rapidly from the PDMS/Si wafer to retrieve the electronic patterns.\nDeposit a 20 nm thick Cr (for adhesion) followed by a 50 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) on retrieved patterns by e-beam evaporation.\nTreat UV/ozone by using UV lamp (365 nm, 8.9 mW/cm2) on the targeted silicone membrane for 2 min to activate the surface.\nTransfer the patterns to the silicone membrane by placing the retrieved patterns on the tape to the desired location and evenly adding pressure from top side of the patterns down to the substrate. Apply water to dissolve the tape for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The described process of materials transfer is facilitated by covalent bonding (Si-O-Si) between the deposited silicon dioxide and the UV-activated silicone substrate17.\nPeel off the tape, rinse with DI water, and dry on a hotplate at 90 °C for 1 min.\nEncapsulate the device using a silicone membrane\n\t\nPrepare an 10 g of encapsulating silicone mixture (1:1 volume ratio of base and curing agent).\nCover the cable contact pads with a rectangular PDMS piece (22 × 6 × 1 mm3) by van der Waals bonding with the bottom silicone membrane, to avoid silicone coating the pads.",

A typical hair straightener offers easy handling and bonding.\n\t\tNOTE: The micro-film cable is preferable to the conventional hard-wire soldering to avoid any mechanical fracture of the transferred metal membranes on a silicone.\nCheck the electrical connection using a digital multimeter. The resistance value is expected less than 1 Ohm between the sensor pad with one end and the other end of the film cable (distance: ~1 cm apart).\nBond the other end of the ribbon cable to a customized printed circuit board with the same strategy described in the step 1.6.2.\nCheck the electrical connection using a digital multimeter.\nConnect the device with the data acquisition hardware by soldering conventional wires on PCB.\n2. Clinical Testing  \nClean the device using a disinfectant solution\n\t\nPrepare 205 g of a diluted disinfectant solution (40:1 volume ratio of water and solution).\nSpray the solution (10 g) on the device and soak it for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The diluted disinfectant cleaner can be stored at RT.\nRinse with water three times and dry it with clean tissues.\nSet up a series of equipment for device testing\n\t\nPrepare and connect a lock-in amplifier with a current source, a multiplexer, and the custom software installed on a laptop computer for data recording.",
    "Place an infrared camera on a tripod and focus on a target object for thermography as a reference.\nSet up system parameters of a lock-in amplifier to measure thermal conductivity (frequency: 1 & 3 Hz; time constant: 3 and 1 sec; sensitivity: 1 mV; dynamic reserve: high reserve) and temperature (frequency: 997 Hz; time constant: 300 msec; sensitivity: 2 mV; dynamic reserve: low noise) with the applied constant current (2 mA).\nConnect two wound devices, prepared by microfabrication and transfer printing and mounted on wound and contralateral sites, to the multiplexer right before recording data from a patient.\nRecord temperature and thermal conductivity\n\tNOTE: The data acquisition software is custom-made, which can remote control the lock-in amplifier for real-time data monitoring and saving. In the temperature measurement, each data point is measured every 300 msec for 20 sec. The set of data for the first 10 sec and next 10 sec are used to calculate the average temperature value and standard deviation, respectively. The recorded data are then saved as a comma-separated value file, which is used to plot a graph for comparison with data from infrared thermography. In the measurement of thermal conductivity, the 3Ω signals are directly read from the hardware screen (amplifier), which is then utilized to calculate the thermal conductivity analytically.\n\t\nGently rub the device application sites on the skin using antiseptic alcohol wipes10.\n2.3.2) Laminate two devices on the desired skin locations by gently pressing the device to the skin with fingers to facilitate the soft bonding: one on the surgical wound site and the other on the contralateral location as a reference.\nMeasure the electrical voltage (3Ω), related to thermal conductivity, of the device by starting the data acquisition.",
    "Evaluate the obtained data to verify the conformal contact of the device to the skin; abnormal value (< 0.1 W/mK) shows bad contact of the device.\nMeasure the electrical resistance to determine temperature distribution and record data through the custom software.\nTake optical and IR images of two devices on the skin.\nCompare temperature values from the IR images with the data recorded from the wound device (2.3.5). Add both values to separate columns in a customized spreadsheet.\nAnalyze the recorded data\n\t\nExport the recorded data to the customized template to automatically calculate temperature and thermal conductivity from an array of sensors in the device.\nPlot the data (temperature and thermal conductivity according to the sensor location on a different time scale) for comparison over the course of one month (four sets of data on day 1, 3, 15, and 30).\nAnalyze the data by comparing a series of temperature and thermal conductivity data according to time; Values with sudden elevation or drop tell the change of wound healing phase and/or unexpected abnormality on wound sites.\nSubscription Required.
