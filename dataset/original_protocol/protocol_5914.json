Flowchart and summary of our approach Streak corresponding yeast cells from a frozen stock by using a sterile tip on a YPD agar plate and incubate at 30 °C for about 48 h or until individual colonies grow.Grow an overnight pre-culture by inoculating a single yeast colony from a YPD plate into 50 ml YPD liquid medium in an Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate at 200 rpm, 30 °C.Next morning dilute overnight pre-culture into 1.5 L fresh YPD medium in a 2,800 ml polycarbonate culture flask with a final OD600 0.05-0.1. Continue incubation at 200 rpm, 30 °C until OD600 reaches 0.5-0.8. Approximately 20-30 L culture is required per strain or treatment for low abundant RNPs such as P-bodies.If necessary, apply corresponding treatment to yeast culture. Crosslink cells with 37% formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% in a fume hood and incubate at room temperature for 2 min with gentle agitation on an orbital shaker.

Approximately 250-400 μl streptavidin agarose beads (bed volume) is used.Wash the beads 3-4 times each with 10 ml wash buffer followed by centrifugation at 800 x g at room temperature. Discard supernatant. During the last wash, transfer the beads into a 1.5 ml protein low LoBind tube, centrifuge at 800 x g at room temperature and discard supernatant.Wash the beads 3 times each with 1 ml PNK buffer (without DTT) by centrifugation at 800 x g at 4 °C.
