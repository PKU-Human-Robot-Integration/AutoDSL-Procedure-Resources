    "This project was performed under strict animal and human care guidelines. Animal ethics was granted by Western Sydney University (A12373). Additionally, a lab risk assessment and biosafety and radiation form were submitted and accepted by Western Sydney University to safely undertake this research (B12366).\nNOTE: Koala fur samples for this project were obtained from the Adelaide Koala and Wildlife Hospital, located at 282 Anzac Highway, Plympton South Australia. Fur was taken from one koala which had been admitted to the hospital and euthanized due to their severe injuries. The deceased koala had been stored in a freezer within a body bag soon after death. After removing the deceased koala from the body bag, 1.2 g of fur was shaved from the nape of the neck using standard animal clippers. The fur was shaved as close as possible to the skin, so as to ensure the skin was not cut. Once shaved, the deceased koala was put back into the body bag and placed in the freezer. The fur was then placed in a pouch made of aluminum foil and stored below -20 °C. In transit, the fur was kept at ambient temperature, and on arrival to the laboratory, the fur was stored at -80 °C.\n1. Koala fur cortisol extraction\nRemove the fur from storage at -80 °C and allow time to thaw.\nWeigh the fur on a laboratory analytical precision balance.\nPlace 60 mg of the fur into a pre-weighed and labelled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and repeat until 18 tubes are filled.\n\tNOTE: 18 fur sub-samples were used for this validation study.\nAdd 1 mL of 100% high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade isopropanol to each tube using a pipette.\nVortex samples for 30 s.",
    "Strain each sample using a 0.5 mm micro precision sieve so as to achieve separation of liquid and fur.\nDiscard the liquid into a waste container.\nPlace each fur sample into a labelled plastic weighing boat, then place into a vacuum desiccator, leave the fur to dry for 3 days.\nOnce completely dry, place each sample into a labelled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPlace each sample in a bead mill with 3 chrome steel beads (3.2 mm) and pulverize for 2 min at 30 shakes per second.\nPipette 1.5 mL of the first extraction technique (100% analytical grade ethanol) into 6 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing the fur sample.\nPerform the same for 100% analytical grade methanol and 100% analytical grade isopropanol until eighteen 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes are filled.\nCap each 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and incubate at room temperature (RT) with constant pulsating using a shaker for 3 h.\nRemove and strain samples using a 0.5 mm micro precision sieve.\nTransfer the liquid into a new, labelled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with a pipette while ensuring that the fur is discarded appropriately.\nCompletely dry solvent extract under a stream of N2 vapor under a fume-cupboard.\nReconstitute the dried sample extract using 400 µL of assay buffer (composition provided in the commercial cortisol kit; see Table of Materials) and 100 µL of 100% analytical grade ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Sample extracts can be stored at -80 .\n2. Internal controls\nTo make controls, make a pool of extracted samples with high hormone levels. To make this pool, select samples from animals with known exposure to stressor. For example, select samples from koalas that have been rescued from environmental trauma as they will generally display high cortisol hormone levels6.",
    "To make the extract pool, take 20 µL of extract from each sample (n = 10) until a total volume of 200 µL is obtained. The extract pool can be stored at -80 C until assays. Run the pool in each assay as low or high internal controls (see step 2.2).\nFor the assay, use the pool to make stocks for low and high controls that bind at 70% (C1) and 30% (C2), respectively. Obtain the dilution factor for the 30% and 70% binding points from the parallelism graph for the extract against the cortisol standard (Figure 1). Use the assay buffer for dilution of sample pool. For example, use 60 µL of the pool extract and 60 µL of assay buffer for 1:2 dilution.\n\tNOTE: For the methanol extract, the 30% binding point was at neat while 70% binding point was approximately 1:2 as per Figure 1. Thus, these provided the dilution factor for the internal controls (C1 and C2 respectively) for running within the assay.\n3. Cortisol analysis in koala fur extracts\nUse a commercial cortisol kit (Table of Materials) and set up the 96 well strip plate including the samples, controls, cortisol standards, non-specific binding wells, and maximum binding wells following the supplier’s instructions. Use the plate layout sheet provided in the kit booklet to list the positions of samples, controls, and standards on the plate map.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended that all samples, controls, and standards are run in duplicate to allow accuracy of results.\nPrepare samples. Follow the fur hormone extraction (section 1) to obtain 100% methanol extracted koala fur.\nPrepare reagents. Follow the procedure described in the commercial cortisol kit to prepare the reagents including (1) assay buffer, (2) wash Buffer, and (3) standards (compositions provided in the cortisol kit, Table of Materials).",
    "As per the instructions provided in the cortisol kit, pipet 50 µL of samples or standards into wells in the plate. Pipet 75 µL and 50 µL of assay buffer into the non-specific binding (NSB) wells and the maximum binding (B0 or zero standard) wells, respectively.\nAdd 25 µL of the cortisol conjugate to each well using a repeater pipet. Then pipet 25 µL of the cortisol antibody into each well, except the NSB wells. Gently tap the sides of the plate to ensure that the reagents are well mixed.\nCover the plate with the plate sealer and shake at room temperature for 1 h (at slow speed) using an orbital shaker.\nRemove the plate sealer and aspirate the well plate by washing each well with 300 µL of wash buffer 4 times.\nDry the plate by tapping the plate on clean absorbent towels.\nPipette 100 µL of tetramethylbenzadine (TMB) substrate (composition provided in the cortisol kit, Table of Materials) to each well.\nPlace the plate sealer on the well plate and incubate at RT for 30 min.\nPipette 50 µL of stop solution to each well.\nPlace the well plate in a plate reader capable of reading 450 nm.\nTo calculate the final hormone concentration, derive the final fur cortisol concentration in ng/mg of sample by multiplying the pg/mL hormone concentration with the final extract volume (0.5 mL) and dividing by the fur sample mass (60 mg).\nSubscription Required.
