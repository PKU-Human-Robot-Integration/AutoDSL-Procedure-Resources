    "The protocol and methods described here were approved and followed the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Minnesota. Described here is a reoperative hiatal hernia repair and takedown of a previous Nissen fundoplication in a 73-year-old woman. The patient presented to the clinic with a history of laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair and a fundoplication 5 years ago at an outside hospital for epigastric pain and fullness after meals. She also complained of significant reflux and dysphagia with solid food intake. Her symptoms had temporarily resolved after the first surgery but had now recurred. Of note, her body mass index (BMI) at the time of consultation was 40. No previous preoperative workup could be obtained prior to the consultation. The patient provided written informed consent before redo foregut surgery.\n1. Patient preparation and operative set-up\nPreoperative workup and testing\n\t\nDiscuss the possibility of reoperation and proceed with a thorough workup as mentioned:\n\t\t\nPerform an esophagram. The esophagram of this patient showed moderate to severe esophageal dysmotility (Figure 1).\nPerform endoscopy. For this patient, upper endoscopy showed no stenosis or strictures but demonstrated a portion of the stomach herniating upward through the diaphragm on a retroflexed view, which confirmed a hiatal hernia.\nPerform computed tomography of the abdomen. This test also confirmed a herniated wrap (Figure 2).\nPerform wireless esophageal pH testing. This showed a DeMeester score24,25 of 38.4 with borderline symptom association probability for acid reflux.\nPerform high-resolution manometry. In this patient, it showed a nonspecific motility disorder.\nPreoperative planning\n\t\nEnsure initial recommendations include weight loss and hence referral to a bariatric surgeon if needed.",
    "NOTE: The patient did well with the weight loss program and could bring down her weight to a BMI of 32. At this point, she continued to have symptoms, and her case was discussed at the multidisciplinary esophageal conference for operative planning. The consensus was that the manometric findings were likely due to reflux and hernia and that a reoperative hernia repair with a loose fundoplication would be appropriate.\nAnesthesia\n\t\nPerform anesthesia following institutional guidelines. Intubate the patient with a single lumen endotracheal tube with rapid sequence intubation because of the risk of aspiration from reflux and a hiatal hernia. She had an arterial line for hemodynamic monitoring.\nPositioning\n\t\nPosition the patient supine with her arms out and a footboard to facilitate steep reverse Trendelenburg positioning26. The chest and abdomen are always prepped into the field for foregut surgeries to have adequate access to the abdomen and chest if needed.\nPort placement and docking\n\t\nUse the open Hasson technique27 to enter the peritoneal cavity in the left supra-umbilical space. Insert the camera port here.\nInsert two more 8 mm ports in the left upper quadrant and one 8 mm port in the right upper quadrant. Place the ports about 10 cm above the umbilicus and ensure a handbreadth space between the ports.\nPlace the assistant port in the right lower quadrant. Insert the liver retractor (see Table of Materials) through a 5 mm port placed in the extreme lateral portion of the right upper quadrant.\n\t\tNOTE: It is the authors' preference to place a left-sided chest tube during surgery because the hernia sac tends to be tethered to the pleura, especially in reoperative surgeries.",
    "Perform this before starting the dissection to minimize the chances of having to undock and reposition during the operation if there are significant hemodynamic changes from a pneumothorax that develops acutely during dissection.\nDock the robot (see Table of Materials).\n2. Surgery procedure\nReducing hiatal hernia\n\t\nRemove the adhesions of the bowel to the abdominal wall and open the gastrohepatic ligament using a robotic bipolar surgical energy device.\nOpen the lesser sac by removing adhesions and additional short gastric artery branches.\nDissect the hernia sac circumferentially at the hiatus using a combination of blunt and electrocautery dissection with the robot.\nDissect the dense adhesions between the liver and stomach carefully with laparoscopic scissors (see Table of Materials).\nTakedown of previous fundoplications.\n\tNOTE: Some but not all sutures from the previous wrap were visible.\n\t\nPerform sharp dissection with laparoscopic scissors and undo the wrap to completely free the stomach.\nCarefully stay in the thin scar tissue to avoid damage to the stomach or esophagus.\nEsophageal mobilization\n\t\nMobilize the esophagus transhiatally in the mediastinum. Perform this with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection and minimize the use of energy close to the esophagus.\nNext, confirm at least 3 cm of intraabdominal esophagus length. Use endoscopy to locate the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and measure the esophagus from the hiatus to the GEJ to confirm the adequate length.\nLeak test\n\t\nPerform endoscopy and visualize the mucosa clearly to ensure no injuries. Fill the upper abdomen with warm water and insufflate the esophagus and stomach to ensure no air leakage.\nHiatal repair\n\t\nPerform crural repair using 0-silk sutures with two posterior crural stitches and one anterior crural stitch.",
    "Pass a 56 Fr bougie (see Table of Materials) into the esophagus, and with the bougie in place, pass a grasper comfortably into the hiatus. This is to ensure that the crural repair was not too tight.\nNissen fundoplication\n\t\nBring the fundus across the right side, posterior to the esophagus, and under the vagus nerve.\nPass a 58 Fr bougie (see Table of Materials) into the esophagus.\nPerform a loose fundoplication over the bougie with three 2-0 silk sutures.\n\t\tNOTE: Endoscopy confirmed a loose stack of coin-like appearance.\nGastropexy and G tube\n\t\nInsert a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube into the stomach to serve as a gastropexy and a venting tube.\n3. Follow-up procedure\nPostoperatively, administer antiemetics to minimize the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting as retching can disrupt the hernia repair or cause early recurrence.\nInitially, the gastric tube is left open to serve as a vent to prevent gastric distention. Eventually, clamp it on postoperative day 2 or 3 once the patient is tolerating liquids.\nProvide the patient with ice chips on the night of surgery. On postoperative day 1, ask the patient to start with sips of clear liquids with the gastric tube still open. On postoperative day 2, initiate a clear liquid diet and if the patient tolerates well, clamp the gastric tube.\n\tNOTE: If tolerating clear liquids while clamped, a full liquid diet is started.\nFinally, instruct the patient on the advancement to a soft diet after 1 week with plans for clinic follow-up in 4 weeks with an esophagram and plans for gastric tube removal if not requiring significant venting.\nSubscription Required.
