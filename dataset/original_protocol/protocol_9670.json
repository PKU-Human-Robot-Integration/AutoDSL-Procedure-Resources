    "All methods described in this protocol have been approved by the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the Regulations for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Guideline for Ethical Review of Animal (China, GB/T35892-2018).\n1. Preparation and characterization of PLGA nanoparticles\nPreparation of PLGA nanoparticles (PNPs)\n\t\nAdd 0.5 g of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to 120 mL of deionized water at 90 °C and stir until completely dissolved to prepare the PVA solution. Store the solution in the refrigerator (4 °C) after cooling to room temperature.\nAdd 100 mg of PLGA to 10 mL of acetone and ethanol mixture (ratio of 4:1) to serve as the oil phase.\nPlace 20 mL of PVA aqueous solution under the fume hood and magnetically stir at 400 rpm/min. Add 5 mL of the oil phase into the PVA solution drop by drop using a syringe pump. Then, stir the mixture in the fume hood until the organic solvents completely evaporate.\n\t\tNOTE: With the increase in the concentration of the particles in the oil phase, the water phase solution gradually turns into a clear and transparent light bluish-white or milky white.\nAfter the volatilization of organic solvents (2-3 h), centrifuge the mixture at 15,000 x g. Wash three or more times until the final washing water is clear and transparent.\n\t\t​NOTE: The purpose of this step is mainly to wash off the residual PVA on the particle surface to prevent it from affecting the Pickering emulsion preparation.\nRe-suspended the washed PNPs in 2 mL of deionized water and freeze the mixture at -80 °C for 24 h. Subsequently freeze-dry the particles in a lyophilizer for 48-72 h. The prepared PNPs are white flocky.\nCharacterization of PNPs",
    "To characterize the size and zeta potential of PNPs, add 10 µL of PNPs into 1 mL of deionized water to obtain diluent solution and transfer the diluent solution to a DTS1070 cell. Switch on the computer and dynamic light scattering analyzer (DLS), then place the DTS1070 cell in the DLS system.\nClick on the Zeta Size Software and create a new measurement file to set up the determination procedure. Then, Start the determination procedure to obtain the particle size and zeta potential distribution.\nTo observe the PNPs morphology, evenly spread the 0.1 mL PNPs solution (diluted 40 times) on a 5 cm x 5 cm tin foil sheet and let the water evaporate naturally in a well-vented fume hood overnight.\nCut out a small part of the tin foil and secure it on the sample table with conductive tape. Spray it with gold at a current of 10 mA for 120 s. Subsequently observe the surface morphology of the sample using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).\n2. Preparation and characterization of PNPE\nTo prepare PNPE, add freeze-dried PNPs to deionized water at a concentration of 4 mg/mL (the aqueous phase) and then add squalene as the oil phase.

The oil-water phase ratio is 1:9.\nCharacterization of the prepared PNPE\n\t\nOpen the Mastersizer 2000 software and the laser in sequence.

Dilute 20 µL of stored PNPE into 1 mL of deionized water (1:50) on day 0, 3, and 6. Then, measure the size and zeta potential of the PNPE stock solutions kept at different temperatures.\n\t\tNOTE: The different storage temperatures are set to compare the effect of different temperatures on the stability of PNPE, which can optimize the storage condition for high stability and long shelf life.\nPreparation of PLGA microparticles (PMPs)\n\t\nDissolve 500 mg of PLGA in 5 mL of dichloromethane as the oil phase, and then pour into 50 mL of external aqueous phase containing 1.5% PVA to obtain the oil/water mixture. Homogenize the mixture at 3000 rpm for 1 min using a homogenizer to obtain coarse-emulsions.",

To reduce background signal, add 1% bovine serum albumin to the FITC-conjugated phalloidin working solution. In addition, cover the lid of the small confocal laser dishes during incubation to prevent evaporation of the solution.\nWash the cells with PBS thre times for 5 min each. Re-stain the nuclei with 200 µL of DAPI solution (concentration: 100 nM) for around 30 s.\nImage analysis\n\t\nSwitch on the confocal microscope hardware in sequence, including the laser, confocal, microscope, and computer.
