    "FACS sort of antigen-specific T cellsIn the studies conducting this protocol, EBV and CMV-specific memory CD8+ T-cell populations were sorted using pMHC class I tetramers on a FACSAria III flow cytometer. A high fidelity staining strategy was used, comprising the specific T-cell markers CD3, CD8 and pMHC-tetramer, and the dump markers CD14 and CD19 to exclude any contamination during the sort from monocytes and B cells, respectively. In addition, a LIVE/DEAD Viability dye was included in the cell staining. For details on the specific staining, see Koning et al. (2013). Tetramer-positive populations usually comprised 0.1-1.0% of CD8+ T cells and in general 500-5,000 antigen-specific cells were isolated. Note: Although the specific fluorochromes noted here were used in Koning et al. (2013), we have performed a similar staining strategy using different fluorochromes in other studies. Similarly, although this protocol specifies the analysis of EBV and CMV-specific T cells, there are no restrictions for the analysis of T cells directed against other species/antigens.To obtain a complete and accurate view of the TCR composition of an antigen-specific T-cell population, make sure to sort a sufficient number of cells (at least 500-1,000 cells, ideally 5,000 cells or even more) at high purity (by including dump markers and a viability dye, as described above). Sort cells directly in RNAlater and store at -80 °C.mRNA isolationIsolate mRNA using the µMACS mRNA Isolation kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute with 30 µl preheated elution buffer.Store mRNA at -80 °C or proceed with cDNA synthesis.cDNA generation Incubate 5.5 µl mRNA and 0.5 µl Oligo d(T)25 (25 mM) at 2 min at 70 °C followed by 2 min at 42 °C.Note: Proceed as fast as possible after this step. Time can be won by preparing the mastermix below during the initial incubation.",

Prepare a PCR mastermix of all reagents except for the template. Prepare enough for a duplicate of each sample and one negative control (water instead of template). Small, artificial variations in clonotype composition can be caused by the PCR. Therefore, when a very accurate examination of the T-cell repertoire is desired (for example, in a longitudinal analysis), it is advised to perform a duplicate PCR that can be pooled after agarose gel electrophoresis (step 5).table:\n﻿0,1\nPer sample,\n5 µl,10x Advantage 2 SA PCR buffer\n10 µl,10x Universal Primer mix (forward primers)\n1 µl,\"MBC2 (25 µM, reverse primer)\"\n1 µl,dNTPs (10 mM)\n1 µl,50x Advantage 2 Polymerase mix\n12 µl,Purified cDNA\n20 µl,H2O\n50 µl,Total volume\nRun reactions in a thermocycler under the following conditions:table:\n﻿0,1,2\n1 cycle,95 °C,30 sec\n5 cycles:,95 °C,15 sec\n,72 °C,2 min\n5 cycles:,95 °C,15 sec\n,70 °C,30 sec",

Isolation of Vβ productsRun an electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, using a 1 kb DNA ladder to determine the size of the fragments. Leave an empty well between each sample to minimize the chance of cross-contamination. A band at 500-600 bp should be visible. Carefully excise the band of interest and transfer the gel to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Extract the amplified TCR products from the gel using the NucleoSpin Extract II Gel and PCR Clean Up kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Store samples at -20 °C. Note: Perform the extra wash steps described in the protocol and also use preheated (37 °C) wash buffer NT3. Elute in 20 µl buffer NE.
