    "All animal procedures followed the Paris Descartes University animal regulations.\n1. Device assembly\nNOTE: The device used in this protocol is a helmet-like structure fixed on mice skulls by means of an implanted headpost.\nUsing a 3D printer and white opaque poly (lactic acid) (PLA) plastic, print using the design and specification files provided here (see Table of Materials) for both the device and headpost.\n\tNOTE: The dimensions of the device are shown in Figure 1 and dimensions of the headpost shown in Figure 2.\nA striped as well as sham device are to be tested (Figure 2A11). To obtain the striped model, using black nail polish, draw 3 mm large vertical stripes on the external surface of the device. The sham condition does not require any modification to the printed device.\n2. Headpost implantation surgery\nAll the materials used in this protocol are detailed in the materials list in the supplementary information. Steps 2.7-2.9 use the biomaterials provided in the implantation kit (see Table of Materials). Ensure the use of sterile instruments and arrange surgery and recovery in different zones. Once mastered, the implantation procedure lasts about 30 min.\nFor analgesia, 30 min before the beginning of the surgery, subcutaneously inject buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) and put back the animal in its home cage.\n\tNOTE: Buprenorphine's analgesic effects last approximately 12 h, long after the end of the procedure. In our experience, mice do not show any signs of distress related to this intervention but a subsequent dose of 0.05mg/kg buprenorphine is recommended 24h after the surgery.",
    "Anesthetize the animal in a chamber with 2.5%-3% isoflurane gas. Wait 3 min and check if the mouse is properly anesthetized by observing respiration and lack of movement inside the chamber. Pass the mouse to a nose cone on a surgical table with a heating pad and, by interdigital pinching, verify that there is no withdrawal reflex and lower the isoflurane to 1.5%.\nShave the head of the mouse using an electric razor. To obtain a sterile environment, rub the shaved area with iodine solution and after with 70% alcohol. Repeat this procedure two more times.\nInject lidocaine hydrochloride (2%, 2 mg/kg) under the skin of the head for local anesthesia and wait 5 min for the effects to begin. To avoid eye damage due to dryness, cover the mouse's eyes with topical ophthalmic vet ointment.\nWith a pair of blunt forceps, grab the skin at the back of the head, and with a pair of blunt scissors (or scalpel), make a longitudinal incision of about 1.5 cm to expose the skull.\nWith the help of a scalpel, scratch the periosteum. Be careful not to scratch too hard, as the fixation of the headpost can be compromised if the skull starts to bleed slightly.\nApply a drop of the green activator on the middle of the skull. This will improve the fixation of the cement by increasing bone permeability.\nPrepare the cement: mix one spoon (provided in the implantation kit) of polymer with five drops of monomer and one drop of catalyzer. With the help of a brush, apply a generous amount of the cement mix between the lambda and bregma skull landmarks;",
    "Quickly place the headpost on the cement with a swiping motion going from lambda to bregma. After the headpost has been placed, reapply more cement around the inferior part to ensure that the headpost properly sticks to the skull. To guarantee proper fixation, make sure the cement is applied abundantly and that it dries before continuing to the next step.\n\tNOTE: With this fixation procedure, the headpost will not come off and allow for long-term, repeated tests; in our hands, headpost removal is <10%.\nPrepare the resin mix by applying a powder-to-liquid ratio that enables a smooth consistency of the mixture. Apply the resin where the cement was applied as well as around the headpost in order to protect its surface.\nWait 3 min for the resin to dry and close the skin at the back of the ears with monofilament suture. With a cotton swab, apply diluted (10%-20%) iodine solution to the operated area.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the skin does not get stuck to the resin.\nTurn off the anesthesia and place the animal under a red warm light to avoid hypothermia. Place moistened food and hydrogel or another water source based in gel in the cage's floor. Do not leave the mouse unattended until it regains consciousness. As soon as the animal fully recovers from the procedure (usually, 30 min to 1 h after), place it in a cage with groups of three or four to stimulate social interactions.\n3. Device fixation\n48 h following the surgery, secure the custom-built head device onto the headpost.",
    "Using a pair of 1.2 mm screws and a screwdriver (1.3 mm hex), align the holes in the striped device with the holes in the headpost, place the screws and secure them. To fix the sham condition, turn the device upside down and, with the back part (Figure 1A) of the device facing the rostral direction, align the holes in the device with the holes in the headpost.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended that this step be done by two operators, one holding the mouse with a one-handed mouse restraint, while the other securing the device to the headpost. If the fixation is done by a single operator, the device can be placed while the mouse is under gas anesthesia.\nCheck that the device is well-secured and cannot be removed by the animal and that the device does not apply pressure directly on the mouse's nose, which could potentially cause pain, difficulty to breath, or skin injury.\n\t\tNOTE: It is also important to ensure the device is symmetrically inserted on the mouse face, so that eyes are completely covered by the head device. Check that the animal does not show any signs of abnormal pain or distress.\nLeave the device on the mouse for 14 days.\n4. Animal care and surveillance\nOnce back in their cages, mice will exhibit certain abnormalities in behavior. At first, the animal may stay prostrated and try to remove the device using its forepaws, but this should stop after the first hour. During the next following hours, the animal will usually display difficulties orienting itself inside the cage and reaching for food and water. Therefore, during the 48 h following implantation, monitor the mice and provide easy access to water and food, by placing both directly on the cage floor, for example.",
    "Keep track of mice's weights during the duration of the protocol. Weigh the mice right after implantation and again every 24 h. Special attention should be given to animals wearing the striped device, as they normally experience body weight loss (1-2 g) during the first 48 h, but start gaining weight again at a normal pace following that initial period (see Figure 2B11).\nAfter 2 days, mice are expected to return to their regular faculties. Depending on the system used in animal facilities, the device might be preventing access to the food and water. Ensure the animal is at ease while eating and drinking or adapt the dispensing system accordingly.\n\tNOTE: The range of head movements produced by the animals after a few days with the device on is not modified by the device (see Figure 211) (i.e., the range of head movements produced remains similar to natural head movements).\nTo further ensure mice's well-being, ensure daily surveillance and apply the qualitative scale (Table 1) of well-being throughout the duration of the protocol.\nRemove a mouse from the ongoing protocol if one or more of the following criteria apply:\n\t\nMice that have a total score higher than 4 points on the aforementioned qualitative scale must immediately be excluded from the experiment (see Table 1). Regardless of the score, if the mouse does not regain its initial weight after 6 days, the procedure must be stopped.\nThe device is not correctly fixed to the headpost if, for instance, the headpost shakes when touched or a part starts to come off. This causes the headpost to come off the mouse's head and consequently interrupts the learning, which explains why daily surveillances are necessary.",
    "When a mouse has its headpost ripped off during any part of the protocol. Due to the skull bleeding associated to this detachment, the reimplantation surgery has a low success rate and is not worth attempting.\n5. Removal of the device\nAfter the learning period (in this protocol 14 days), remove the device following the same instructions as for its fixation (section 3). As soon as the device is removed, test the mice with experiments such as video-oculography tests, or, for instance, with in vitro electrophysiology as described previously11.\n\tNOTE: As soon as the device is taken off, mice are exposed back to the standard, visually unobstructed environment. Therefore, perform experiments that aim to test the learning effects of this device directly after its removal.\n6. Video-oculography sessions\nNOTE: Video-oculography experiments are performed to record the generated eye movements while the animal is being rotated in the dark (vestibulo-ocular reflex, VOR) or by rotating the animal's surroundings while the animal is still (optokinetic reflex, OKR). Each mouse was tested for both these reflexes before and after the adaptation protocol. For more details about the video-oculography set-up, see previously published reports12,13. In order to habituate the mice to the restrained recording conditions, the day before the beginning of the recording, place the animal on the tube at the center of the turntable for 10minutes without performing any test.\nSecure the mouse on the turntable by head-fixing it with the help of screws inserted into the headpost. Place a screen dome surrounding the animal and turn off all the lights in the room except for the optokinetic projector.",
    "NOTE: Video-oculography recordings require the animal to be still and with its eyes open. Interrupt the recording session and put the animal back on its cage in case the mouse does not voluntarily keep its eyes open, or if the appearance of the eye deteriorates during the recording session. Another attempt can be made following a resting period of at least 12h.\nStart the OKR full-field stimulation (white dot pattern projection) and record at several different velocities in both clockwise and counter clockwise directions. As soon as the recordings are over, remove the dome.\nTo be able to record the VOR in pitch dark, apply a drop of 2% pilocarpine to the eyes14. Wait at least 5 min for it to act and gently remove it with a cotton swab. The pilocarpine will keep the pupil constricted with a constant size throughout the measurements, allowing proper quantification of movements in the dark.\nTurn off all the lights in the room and add a box on top of the turntable to keep the animal in pitch dark. Start the horizontal VOR using sinusoidal angular rotations around a vertical axis with different frequencies and/or different velocities.\nOnce the recording session is finished, return the mouse to a cage properly illuminated with an infrared lamp. The heat will prevent hypothermia caused by the secondary vasodilator effects of pilocarpine on the body of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: Due to the animal being restrained, recording sessions can’t last more than 90 min. When additional test sessions are needed, let the animal rest for 24h between sessions."
