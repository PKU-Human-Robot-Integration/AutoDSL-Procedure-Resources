    "1. Preparation of the Patterned Master (Figure 1)\nCenter the silicon wafer on the spin-coater and rinse the wafer with acetone during the initial step of the two-cycle spin program in Table 1.  The acetone will evaporate during the second step of the spin program leaving a clean, dry wafer.\nApply approximately 1 mL AZ9245 photoresist/in (in diameter) to the wafer and spin-coat using the conditions described in Table 1.\nSoft-bake the photoresist-coated wafer at 110°C for 2 m using a high-uniformity hotplate.\nPhotopattern the substrate using either a direct-write photolithography system or a mask aligner system and appropriate mask.  Masks can be purchased from a number of commercial sources.  Additionally, transparencies printed with UV absorbent ink, taped to an optical flat, may be used to produce patterns with large features.\nDevelop the patterned wafer in 1:2 400K developer:semi-conductor grade deionized water for 1 m 45 s with gentle agitation.  Rinse thoroughly with semi-conductor grade deionized water and dry with a stream of nitrogen (N2) gas.  Pattern development can be checked using a microscope with a UV filter.  If the pattern is not fully developed, the wafer can be returned to the developing solution for additional time.\nNote: For best results, photopatterning should be carried out in a cleanroom environment.\n2. Preparation of PDMS Stamp (Figure 2)\nPrepare a 10:1 by weight resin:hardener mixture of Sylgard 182 (PDMS) and completely cover the master (photopatterned wafer) with the mixture in a disposable petri dish.\nDe-gas the PDMS-covered master in a vacuum dessicator until no bubbles are visible and allow the stamp to cure in an oven at 65°C for 1.5 h.  Prior to curing, it is important make sure the master is at the bottom of the dish as it may rise to the surface during the de-gassing step.",
    "Cut the PDMS stamp out of the master and trim to the appropriate size.  Store the stamp in a covered container (feature side up) to protect it from dust and debris.\n3. Preparation of the Patterned Gold Substrate (Figure 3)\nPrepare 25 mm no. 1 round glass coverslips for metal deposition by treating them with oxygen plasma for 10 m.  Rinse twice with 18.2 MΩ deionized water followed by twice with ethanol, drying with a stream of N2 gas between each step.\nUsing a multi-pocket electron-beam deposition system, deposit 50 Å titanium followed by 150 Å gold.  Do not vent the evaporator between deposition of the titanium layer and gold layer.  Alternatively, gold-coated coverslips may be purchased from a variety of suppliers, however, it is important that the metal layers are prepared by electron-beam evaporation and not thermal evaporation.  If purchased from an outside source, gold substrates may be cleaned by plasma oxidation or \"piranha\" (7:3 Conc. H2SO4:30% H2O2)11 prior to use.\nNote: \"Piranha\" solution is explosive in the presence of organic compounds.\nPrepare the stamping solution, 10 mM hexadecanethiol in absolute ethanol, and the backfilling solution, 1 mM glycol-terminated thiol in absolute ethanol.\nRinse the stamp with ethanol and dry thoroughly with N2 gas.  Apply stamping solution to the PDMS stamp dropwise until fully coated.  Dry the stamp thoroughly with N2 gas.  Proceed to 5a or 5b as appropriate based on the features of the PDMS stamp.\nGently press the stamp onto the gold substrate and allow the monolayer to form for 15 s.\nPlace the gold substrate into a petri dish containing 18.2 MΩ deionized water, ensuring the substrate is submerged. Gently press the stamp onto the gold substrate and allow the monolayer to form for 15 s.",
    "Rinse the stamped substrate twice with ethanol, drying with N2 gas after each rinse and place the substrate in a petri dish.\nCover the substrate with backfilling solution and seal the dish with parafilm to prevent evaporation.\nAllow the background monolayer to form in the dark for 12-14 h.\nRemove the patterned coverslip from the backfilling solution and rinse twice with ethanol, drying with N2 gas after each rinse.\n4. Applying Protein and Cells to the Patterned Substrate\nPlace the patterned coverslip in a small petri dish or cell culture chamber and cover with 500 μL to 1 mL of Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS).  The DPBS must completely cover the substrate during protein incubation to ensure even protein coverage.\nAdd a concentrated solution of protein to the DPBS and mix the solution by pipeting several times.  Incubate the protein mixture with the substrate at 37°C for 1 h.  Final concentrations for laminin and fibronectin are typically 12 μg/mL and 20 μg/mL, respectively.  Protein can be labeled with an amine reactive fluorescent dye to allow for easy pattern visualization. However, labeled protein should be mixed 1:1 with unlabeled protein as protein labeling can interfere with biological activity.\nAfter incubation, rinse the substrate thoroughly with DPBS (4-5x) to remove unbound protein, taking care not to dry the substrate or bring it through the air-water interface.  After the first three rinses, add approximately 500 μL of complete cell growth media to maintain a wet substrate.\nReplace the growth media used to rinse the substrate with fresh media.\nDissociate and count cells for plating onto the substrate.  Either dissociated primary cells, such as hippocampal neurons, or immortalized cell lines, such as CHO-K1 cells, can be utilized.\nPlate dissociated cells onto the substrate.  Typically 30 to 200 cells/mm2 are used.\n5. Representative Results:",

    "imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3164/3164fig8.jpgFigure 8.Submerged patterning can produce patterns with small features that are difficult to print by conventional microcontact printing in air.  Images (A) and (B) show different regions of the same pattern, printed with the same PDMS stamp in air (A) or deionized water (B). 10μm-wide support lines which surround the pattern (added to help prevent stamp collapse) are seen in (A), however, the smaller dot features as shown in (B) are not seen.  This demonstrates that printing in air works well for larger features, but printing in water may be necessary for patterns with smaller features. Scale bars are 20 μm.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nCycle,Acceleration Rate (rpm/s),Final Speed (rpm),Time (s)\n1,500,1000,5\n2,3800,3800,30\nTable 1.  Two-cycle spin program used to create a 4.5 μm thick coating of AZ9245 on a silicon wafer.\nTo prepare PDMS stamps for the formation of patterned substrates, a master in photoresist is first fabricated (Figures 1 and 4A).  The master is the inverse of the stamp and is created using either a direct-write lithography system or a mask aligner.  When a positive photoresist, such as AZ9245, is used for master production, the resist-coated wafer is exposed to light with the same pattern that will appear on the final substrate.  While it is not always possible, it has been reported that the ideal aspect ratio (feature size to resist thickness) for PDMS stamp masters is 1:2.13  We have found that aspect ratios of 1:40 are possible, depending on the nature of the pattern.  AZ9245 coated silicon wafers under the conditions described here give photoresist with a nominal thickness of 4.5 μm.  We have found that this thickness of AZ9245 can be used to produce PDMS masters with features ranging from >100 μm to 2 μm.",
    "PDMS stamps are cast from Sylgard 182 (or Sylgard 184) using the master fabricated from photoresist (Figure 2).  Photoresist masters can be used multiple times to create many copies of the same stamp.  After hardening the PDMS, stamps are removed from the master using a razor blade and the resulting stamp can be visualized under a microscope by placing stamp feature side down on a glass coverslip (Figure 4B)\nProper stamping results in a sharp, clear protein pattern that can be visualized by application of fluorescently labeled protein (Figures 3 and 5).  Alternatively, immunohistochemistry may be used to visualize the protein pattern after cell fixation (Figure 6).  Cell growth is well confined to the protein pattern for both immortalized cell lines and primary cells (Figures 5 and 6).\nWhile this technique is easily mastered, several common problems may arise.  The application of protein without sufficient mixing of the concentrated protein solution in the DPBS can lead to uneven protein patterns (Figure 7A).  Improper stamping can lead to partial pattern transfer or stamp collapse (Figure 7B-C).  In addition, exposing the patterned substrate containing adsorbed protein to air can disrupt the monolayer causing decreased resistance in the background (Figure 7D).  Patterns comprised of very small features (< 5 μm) and high aspect ratios often require the use of submerged microcontact printing.  In this procedure (3.5b) water is used as a barrier to prevent hexadecanethiol from depositing onto the substrate outside of the pattern (Figure 8).14Subscription Required.
