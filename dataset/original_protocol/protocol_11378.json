    "1. Protein Extraction\nPlate 5 x 106 cells on a 10 mm tissue culture plate (or flask) in a tissue culture hood. Count the cells at the time of plating with an automatic cell counter or hemocytometer. Alternatively, estimate the cell count.\nRinse the cells grown on the 10 mm plate (or flask) thoroughly 3x with 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4). Make sure to remove all PBS before adding the lysis buffer.\n\tNOTE: The lysis buffer is usually provided with the kit. If not, then use a radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) or any other cell lysis buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors.\nLyse 1 x 107 cells/mL of cells in the lysis buffer by adding the correct amount of buffer to the cells and scraping the cells with a cell scraper into the lysis buffer. (e.g., for HeLa cells and MiaPaCa-2, use 600 µL per 10 cm plate).\nPipette the lysate up and down (approximately 10x) and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nIncubate the lysates for 30 min at 4 °C, preferably on a rocker/shaker. Press the lysate through a syringe with a 27 G needle for 10x to ensure a proper disruption of the cell membrane(s). Alternatively, sonicate the lysate. Store the lysates at -20 °C or use them immediately.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 14,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min and transfer the supernatant to a clean 1.5 mL tube.\nQuantitate the amount of total protein by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA)20 or an equivalent such as Lowry or Bradford and continue with at least 50–400 μg. Use the proteins immediately or aliquot and freeze/store them at -70 °C (avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles).\n2. Human Phosphokinase Array",
    "Bring all reagents to room temperature before starting (for approximately 1 h).\n\tNOTE: All reagents and plastic wear are included in the kit.\nPrepare all the reagents fresh (array buffers) before starting the procedure following the manufacturer's instructions (depending on the choice of targets/arrays, the instructions might vary slightly).\nReconstitute the detection antibody cocktails in 100 μL of deionized water or follow the manufacturer's instructions should they differ for the 1.5 mL test tube provided.\nPrepare 1x wash buffer by diluting 40 mL of 25x wash buffer in 960 mL of deionized water and mix them by inverting.\n\tNOTE: Crystals dissolve at room temperature. The buffer may turn yellow over time but will still work.\nPipette 1 mL of array buffer 1 into each well of an 8-well multi-tray (or 2 mL in a 4-well multi-tray).\nWith flat-tip tweezers, remove the array membranes between the protective sheets and place them into the wells. Make sure the numbers on the membrane are facing upwards.\n\tNOTE: Upon submersion, the dye on the membrane will disappear.\nCover the tray with a lid and incubate it on a rocking platform shaker for 60 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: This is the membrane blocking step.\nDuring the incubation period, prepare the protein samples. Add 50–100 μg of total protein. Dilute the lysate, having a maximum volume of 334 μL, with lysis buffer to a final volume of 1 mL.\n\tNOTE: 50–100 μg of total protein usually suffices.\nAspirate array buffer 1 carefully and incubate the membranes with 1 mL of the samples overnight at 2–8 °C on a rocking platform shaker.\n\tNOTE: Do not touch/scratch the membranes.",
    "The next day, wash the array by carefully removing each array and placing it into individual plastic containers (approximately 8 x 11 cm2) with 20 mL of 1x wash buffer. Wash the membranes 3 x 10 min on a rocking platform in 1x washing buffer at room temperature.\nPipette 20 μL of the reconstituted antibody cocktail from step 2.3 to 1 mL of 1x array buffer 2. Add 1 mL of this solution to each 8-well to be used.\nCarefully remove the membranes from the wash trays. Blot the lower edge onto the paper towels to remove any excess wash buffer and transfer them back into the tray containing the antibody cocktails. Cover the tray with the lid and incubate it for 2 h at room temperature on a rocking platform. Thoroughly rinse the used trays with dH2O and dry them for later usage.\nCarefully remove each array and place them back into the clean individual plastic containers (approximately 8 x 11 cm2) with 20 mL of 1x wash buffer. Wash them 3 x 10 min with the wash buffer on a rocking platform at room temperature.\nDilute Streptavidin-HRP (provided with the kit) or streptavidin-fluorescent dye (for a more quantitative detection) 1:1,000 in 1x array buffer 2 in a 15 mL test tube.\nReturn the membranes into the 8-well dishes containing the HP solution and incubate them for 30 min at room temperature on a rocking platform (if using fluorescence, wrap the tray in aluminum foil to avoid any light exposure).",
    "Remove the excess buffer by placing the membrane in between 2 pieces of 5 mm of 3 M paper. For imaging with an X-ray film/chemiluminescent imager, incubate the dried membranes with an HRP detection solution (mix the two chemiluminescent solutions 1:1) for 3 min and place the membrane into a clear plastic sheet protector.\n\tNOTE: Dried membrane(s) may also be placed in a fluorescent imager to detect the fluorescent signal; minimize the light exposure to the membrane before imaging. For a quantification of the X-ray film or imager files, avoid overexposure. Most chemiluminescent/fluorescent imagers have a function to avoid a saturation of the signal.\n3. Data Analysis\nDownload ImageJ, an image processing program21, and install the software.\nOpen ImageJ by double-clicking on the 'ImageJ icon'. Select the image to be analyzed by clicking 'File' in the menu bar, then select 'Open' from the drop-down menu and browse the computer files for the image of interest. Click the file to open it.\nInvert the picture for the analysis (black spots on the white background to white spots on a black background) by clicking 'Edit' in the menu bar and selecting 'Invert' from the drop-down menu.\nSelect the 'oval icon' from the toolbar (the second option in the ImageJ toolbar). Draw a circle/oval by clicking on the picture (black cross) and moving the mouse. Adjust the size/shape of the circle/oval to encircle the dots on the dot blot.\nClick 'Analyze' in the menu bar and then select 'Measure' from the drop-down menu to automatically open a new window with the values of the selected area (area, mean, minimum, and maximum).",
    "Move the circular area by dragging the circle from the center (put the point of the arrow right in the middle) and place it around the next measurement (dot) area. Measure all spots of interest, the positive control, the negative control, and the background for the analysis.\n\tNOTE: The negative control is the PBS, the background is a part of the membrane without any spot (any part will do), and the positive control is a control provided by the manufacturer.\nSelect the PBS negative control spots and subtract the value from each spot. Average the intensity for each pair of duplicate spots representing each receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Each average intensity can be related to the control to calculate the fold change.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
