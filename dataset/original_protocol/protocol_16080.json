    "Embryonic limb bud-derived chondrifying micromass cell cultures are used as an in vitro experimental model for hyaline cartilage formation. The chondroprogenitor cells in micromass cultures first proliferate and then differentiate into matrix-producing chondroblasts during the first 3 days of culture, and a well detectable hyaline cartilage-specific ECM forms by the sixth day of culture. To set up the chondrifying cultures, the distal parts of the fore and hind limbs of early-stage (Hamburger–Hamilton stages 23–24; ∼4.5 day-old; Hamburger & Hamilton, 1951[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0009]) chicken embryos are dissected and pooled, the limb buds are dissociated using trypsin, the cell density is adjusted to 1.5 × 107, and micromass cultures of required size are established.\nMaterials\nFertilized eggs\n96% ethanol, diluted to 70% (v/v) (VWR, cat. no.

Place the desired number of eggs in the egg hatcher and adjust the temperature setting to 38.5°C.\nConsider using a programmable outlet timer and adjust settings so that the incubator starts (in our experience) exactly 104 hr (∼4.5 days) prior to the desired start of the experiment. The volume of cell suspension with the necessary density (1.5 × 107 cells/ml) that can be obtained from a batch of eggs strongly varies due to several factors that are not entirely within control of the researcher (even seasonal changes influence the yield from a batch). However, 100 eggs can generally be expected to yield a minimum of 6-7 ml of cell suspension with the required density (1.5 × 107 cells/ml).\nPay attention to maintaining appropriate humidity in the egg hatcher for the entire duration of the incubation.\nATTENTION: planning is advisable. Start the egg hatcher on a day so that the critical days of the experiment do not fall on a weekend. In our experience, the egg hatcher starts on a Friday at 2:00 am, and the rest of the procedure is carried out on the following Tuesday morning.",
    "2. After the 104 hr incubation time, switch off the hatcher and remove the eggs. Use 70% (v/v) ethanol to wipe clean the surface of the eggs. Immediately afterwards, in a dimly lit room, use the egg candling device to assess the presence and position of the embryo within the egg (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0003]; Video file 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0008]).\nA proportion (usually ∼10%) of eggs will not contain an embryo, and these should be discarded. A graphite pencil is suitable for marking the position of the well vascularized chorioallantois area around the embryo on the shell (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0003]). Some eggs will contain embryos that are not attached to the eggshell, this is typically the sign of reduced vitality, and we recommend against using these embryos.\nWe recommend putting the stereomicroscopes and dissecting tools (forceps, etc.) into the laminar hood which are required for further steps of the protocol.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6536c185-55ec-478e-8a7a-fba0eb558cab/cpz1835-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nMain steps of setting up micromass cultures from chicken embryonic limb buds.

(E) Embryos in a Petri dish placed under an operating stereomicroscope, and the microforceps for limb bud removal. (F) 4 embryos in a Petri dish containing prewarmed CMF–PBS.",
    "3. Use a pair of curved micro forceps to crack the eggshell immediately next to the circular marking that indicates the position of the embryo. Remove enough of the shell to access the embryo with a filter spoon (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0003]) and use it to remove the embryo (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0003]; Video file 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0009]).\nATTENTION: Try to avoid removing the egg yolk together with the embryo as the lipid content of the egg yolk may interfere with limb bud removal by making the solution turbid.\nEmbryos should be at Hamburger–Hamilton stage 23–24 (Hamburger & Hamilton, 1951[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0009]). Chondrogenesis has not yet commenced in the limb buds at this stage. The limb buds should appear round, without signs of future digits. See more details in the Critical Parameters and Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#support-information-section] sections.\n4. Immediately place the embryos (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0003]) into glass crystallizing dishes or 10-mm Petri dishes containing 10 ml prewarmed (37°C) CMF-PBS supplemented with gentamycin (0.2 mg/ml) and pool ∼10 embryos.\nThis is a wash step, which helps rid the embryos of unwanted egg components, such as egg white, egg yolk, and any membranes.\n5. Transfer the desired number of embryos (between 5 and 10) into separate Petri dishes containing 10 ml prewarmed (37°C) gentamycin-supplemented CMF-PBS and place the Petri dish under the stereomicroscope (Fig. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0003]-F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0003]; Video file 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0010]).\nThe number of embryos in each dish depends on how skilled the operator is. For a less experienced person, we recommend using fewer embryos.\n6. Use an operating microscope and two pairs of fine forceps (a straight and a curved set) to remove distal portions of all four limb buds from each embryo (Video file 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0011]). Collect removed limb buds in a crystallizing dish that also contains prewarmed (37°C) gentamycin-enriched CMF-PBS (∼5 ml).",
    "Hold the curved pair of fine forceps in the dominant, more dexterous hand, and the straight pair in the less dexterous hand as this pair of forceps is used to hold the embryo while dissecting limb buds. Turning the embryos over to collect limb buds from the other side may be problematic for unexperienced personnel; there is no recipe for this procedure other than personal experience. Nevertheless, we show a method for this procedure in the video (Video file 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0011]).\nAs an alternative option, it is possible to collect forelimbs and hindlimbs separately.\nATTENTION: This step is time sensitive, as cells in the embryos ex ovo start losing vitality. It is strongly recommended to finish this step of the protocol within 60 min. Planning is advisable (see above; Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0002]), as it is necessary to have experienced personnel—usually two persons—working simultaneously on this step to achieve a desirable pace. It is important to remove only the apical/distal portions of limb buds, as the cellular composition, developmental stage, and differentiation program of more basal parts is not ideal for micromass culturing.\nPlace operating microscopes in a laminar flow cabinet to prevent contamination.\n7. Once all limb buds from all embryos have been gathered, remove unwanted tissue debris (e.g., epithelial membranes, inappropriate parts of the embryo) from the Petri dish with the aid of a stereomicroscope. Remove the CMF-PBS by careful pipetting and transfer the limb buds to 15 ml trypsin-EDTA solution preincubated at 37°C in a 30-ml weighing bottle with a glass lid (Video file 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0012]). Incubate 55 min at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.\nIt is a good idea to gently mix the dissociating limb buds in the trypsin-EDTA solution by careful pipetting periodically or at least once approximately halfway through the incubation period (Video file 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0013]).",
    "Do not allow the digestion to proceed longer than 1 hr, even if the limb buds look intact. Excessive digestion will compromise the integrity of the cells and they will die.\n8. Carefully dissociate the limb buds using a 5-ml pipette by careful pipetting several times. Terminate the enzymatic dissociation of limb buds by adding an equal volume of fetal bovine serum (Video file 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0013]). Mix well and transfer the solution to a 50-ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuge 5 min at 150 × g, room temperature, to pellet the cells.\n9. Carefully remove supernatant with a vacuum aspirator and resuspend pellet in 30 ml Ham's F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS.\n10. Centrifuge cell solution 10 min at ∼150 × g, room temperature. Resuspend cells in an adequate volume of Ham's F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS.\n11. Filter the cell suspension through a 20-µm nylon net filter (Video file 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0014]).\nThis step is recommended to rid the cell suspension of larger clumps of tissue that failed to dissociate, and to generate a single-cell suspension for cell counting.\nSetting a low volume of medium for resuspension is a safer option but it might make cell counting unnecessarily difficult (this, depending on the method, also increases the likelihood of mistakes). On the other hand, a too high resuspended volume may result in over-dilution (cell density falls below 1.5 × 107 cells/ml), making an additional centrifugation step necessary.\n12. Determine the cell concentration of the suspension, preferably using an automated cell counter (Video file 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0015]) and adjust the final volume with the same medium to achieve the desired concentration of 1.5 × 107 cells/ml.\nIt is ideal to set a 10× dilution for faster and more precise counting. Using trypan blue to assess cell vitality is optional (but recommended).",
    "13. Inoculate droplets (of various size ranging from 15 µl to 100 µl) into 35-mm cell culturing dishes or 24-well plates that fit the purpose of the experiment (Video file 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0016]). Allow cells to attach to the surface for 2 hr in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2 and 90% humidity).\nAvoid air bubbles or irregularly shaped drops when plating cells, as this will interfere with micromass culture morphology and chondrogenesis. Make sure to handle the cell culture plates/plates with the inoculated droplets with extreme care. Inappropriate handling may result in misshapen cultures, which affects chondrogenic differentiation.\nDue to ongoing proliferation (during the early, less differentiated period of culturing in particular), higher total inoculation volumes (i.e., more micromass cultures) are needed for colonies that are to be harvested on early culture days, with a gradual decrease towards later time points. As concentration gradients of soluble factors play a cardinal role in chondrogenesis of micromasses, we strongly recommend using identical droplet sizes throughout different experimental groups within assays. In essence, a higher number of, but not larger, droplets are needed for groups harvested at early culturing stages.\n14. Flood cultures with medium (Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution) after the 2 hr attachment period. Make sure to add L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at 50 mg/L final concentration to the culture medium at this stage. Change the culture medium every other day for the duration of the experiment.",
    "Add medium to freshly established micromass cultures carefully. Let the culture medium run down the sides of the wells or Petri dishes so as not to disturb the cells. The cell attachments are very tenuous at this point and if the medium is introduced too quickly, the cells will wash off the plate and die, adversely affecting chondrogenesis.\nUse the following volumes to feed the cells: use 1.5 ml of medium per 35-mm Petri dish or per well of a 6-well plate; or 1 ml of medium/well for a 24-well plate.\nThe day of inoculation should be considered day 0; culture day 1 is the day after plating the micromass cultures. Allow a few additional hours for cultures that are planned to be harvested on day 0.",
    "High efficiency transfection of foreign nucleic acids into this model is particularly challenging. Transfections reagents that are gentle on limb bud cells (such as Lipofectamine 2000) usually result in low (∼25%) transfection efficacy, whereas other methods (such as Amaxa nucleofector technology) can achieve much higher efficiency (up to 97%) but at the same time can induce high rates of apoptosis (Bobick et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0002]). Due to the necessity of plating droplets at a high initial cell density, the best window of opportunity for this intervention is while cells are in suspension (following step 11 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0001]). Below, we describe a modified version of the method described by Bobick et al. (2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0002]). This method consists of square wave pulse electroporation of cells resuspended in a protective sucrose buffer containing siRNA. It results in a comparatively high transfection efficiency without significant harm on cell viability, and chondrogenic differentiation potential. Following electroporation, cells are pooled, resuspended in Ham's F12 culture medium, counted, and inoculated into cell culture dishes or plates that fit the purpose of the experiment.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0001])\nModified sucrose electroporation buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-rec-0006])\nPre- and/or custom-designed siRNAs, including controls (Silencer Select, Thermo Fisher Scientific)\n2.0-mm gap sterile electroporation cuvette (VWR, cat. no. 732-1136)\nSquare wave electroporation system (BTX model ECM 830)\nIce\n1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes\n1.

Each electroporation cuvette should contain 1 × 106 cells, which—following net loss—usually yields ∼5-6 × 105 cells (sufficient for ∼35-40 µl of cell suspension at 1.5 × 107 cells/ml seeding density).",
    "2. Take the required amount of cell suspension, centrifuge 5 min at 150 × g, room temperature, and remove supernatant with a vacuum aspirator.\n3. Resuspend cell pellet in cold (4°C) modified sucrose electroporation buffer.\nThe sucrose content of the medium provides a protective environment that increases the viability of cells during and after electroporation (Bobick et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0002]).\n4. Add 2 µg siRNA to every 250 µl of cell suspension, mix well by pipetting, and transfer the entire volume to a 2.0-mm gap sterile electroporation cuvette.\nRefrigerate the sterile electroporation cuvettes at 4°C overnight prior to use. Dilute and aliquot siRNA in advance according to the resuspension protocol recommended by the manufacturer, resulting in 100 µM final concentration (e.g., resuspension volume is 50 µl for 5 nmole siRNA, which consists of 10 µl 5 × siRNA buffer, and 40 µl nuclease-free H2O).\n5. Incubate cuvettes containing the solution at 4°C for 5 min then administer pulses with the electroporation system according to the following settings: three 400 V pulses, 150 s in length, at 100 ms intervals (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0004]-C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0004]).\nATTENTION: placing the electroporation cuvettes on ice immediately after pulsing is pivotal to the survival rate of transfected cells.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8639fd47-bc71-4366-ad9d-b0d405783b14/cpz1835-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nTransfection of cells with siRNA constructs using electroporation.

    "1,9-dimethyl methylene blue is a cationic dye which preferentially binds to negatively charged sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG). This staining technique is widely used in cartilage research (Templeton, 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0020]). The dye shows purple metachromasia in the presence of polyanionic sGAG. The pH must be kept at pH 1.5 to avoid erroneous estimation of sGAG content in newly produced cartilage ECM due to interference caused by polyanions such as hyaluronan, DNA, or RNA (Zheng & Levenston, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0022]).\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0001])\nChondrogenic cell suspension samples (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0001], step 13)\nPhosphate buffered saline (PBS) tablets (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., cat. no. 003002), or equivalent\nEthanol-formalin fixative (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-rec-0004])\n80%, 70%, and 50% (v/v) ethanol\n3% (v/v) acetic acid\n0.1% (w/v) DMMB solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-rec-0003])\nDistilled H2O\n12-mm microscope cover glasses, heat-sterilized for 60 min at 180°C before use (VWR, cat. no. 631-1577)\nChemical hood\nAquatex mounting medium (Merck, cat. no. 1.08562.0050)\nMicroscope slides, 76 × 26 mm (VWR, cat. no. 631-1553)\nPlastic Pasteur pipette (VWR, cat. no. 612-1684)\nHooked needle\nForceps with curved or flat tips\nWater absorbent paper strips\nComputer and software (see Internet Resources)\nNOTE: Each step is performed at room temperature in a 24-well plate.

    "CAUTION: Formaldehyde, the aqueous solution (40%) of which is formalin, is a known carcinogen. Formaldehyde is a sensitizing agent that can cause an immune response upon initial exposure. Subsequent exposure may cause severe allergic reactions of the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Long-term or repeated exposure to low levels in the air or on the skin can cause asthma-like respiratory problems and skin irritation. Acute exposure can be highly irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Because of the serious potential hazards, precautions must be taken to eliminate or reduce the potential risk for exposure, e.g., by wearing appropriate PPE, and adhering to safe use practices.\n1. Wash samples (established from 30-µl droplets of the chondrogenic cell suspension; see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0001], step 13) cultured on 12-mm cover glasses in a 24-well plate twice in PBS prepared from the tablets at room temperature.\nMicromass cultures should be at least 3-day-old for this protocol. Do not expect metachromatic cartilage matrix areas in cultures younger than 3 days. Intense metachromatic staining is to be expected in 6-day-old cultures.\n2. Fix samples in ethanol-formalin fixative solution for 30 min at room temperature.\nSterile hood is no longer needed after fixation. The next steps can be performed in a chemical hood.\n3. To rehydrate the samples, wash cultures 3 times, 10 min each in 80% (v/v) ethanol, then in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, then in 50% (v/v) ethanol for 2 min, and rinse in distilled H2O for 2 min.\nSamples can be stored in 70% (v/v) alcohol for 2-3 days at 4°C if the rest of the staining procedure cannot be performed immediately after fixing the samples. Longer storage is not recommended because GAG content can dissolve after several days.",
    "4. Wash cultures in 3% (v/v) acetic acid for 3 min to reduce the pH.\n5. Stain the samples in 0.1% (w/v) DMMB solution for 5 min\nFilter the DMMB solution before each use to remove undissolved dye particles. To avoid erroneous estimation of sGAG content due to interference caused by polyanions such as hyaluronan, DNA, or RNA, the pH should be kept at pH 1.5\n6. Aspirate the DMMB solution from the wells and add 3% (v/v) acetic acid to the samples to remove unbound/excess dye. Aspirate the acetic acid solution immediately.\n7. Wash cover glasses three times in distilled H2O. Keep the samples in distilled H2O until mounting.\nKeep soaking time to a minimum because extended period of soaking in distilled H2O may cause the dye to leak out from the cultures.\n8. Mount samples using a Pasteur pipette by placing one droplet of Aquatex mounting medium (∼50 µl) on a microscope slide, then carefully lower the cover glass onto the droplet with the stained cultures facing downward.\nWith the help of a hooked needle and a pair of forceps, carefully remove the cover glass from the bottom of the 24-well plate and blot excess water with absorbent paper strips from the edge of the cover glass before mounting. It is much easier to lift the cover glass from the well if the last round of distilled H2O is left in the well. When lowering the cover glass into the droplet of mounting medium, try to avoid bubbles getting between the microscope slide and the cover glass.\n9.

The application was written in MATLAB, and there are several options for running it on your system:\n         \nIf you have MATLAB installed on your computer, you can download it from one of the web pages provided (see Internet Resources). Start MATLAB and type metachromasiaIndex at the command prompt.\nIf you do not have MATLAB installed on your computer, you can download and install MATLAB Runtime from the webpage of Mathworks (see Internet Resources). Choose R2022a corresponding to your operating system and download the compressed folder containing the executable version of the program (see Internet Resources). After unzipping the file, double-click the metachromasiaIndex.exe file to start the program.\nWe have introduced three different indices for quantifying metachromasia based on the color of digital microscopic images. Since previous quantitative measures of metachromasia are based on comparison of optical densities at two different wavelengths (Hattori et al., 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0011]) or at two different polarization angles (Heuft & Bohm, 1978[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0012]; Romhanyi, 1963[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0016]), they are not easily applied under conditions available in ordinary cell biological laboratories. Since the novel indices are based on quantifying color, a brief introduction to the RGB color model is required. An arbitrary color can be defined by a number triplet with the first, second and third values specifying the intensity of the red, green, and blue colors, respectively. Color intensities are usually specified on a scale between 0-255. This color model, named RGB, can be represented by a cube in which the three spatial coordinates correspond to the intensity of either the red, green, or blue colors. Consequently, every different spatial position in the cube corresponds to a certain color (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0005]).\nThe first metachromasia index is described by the following equation:\n         formula:",
    "$$\\begin{equation*} inde{x}_1 = \\frac{{255{\\rm{\\ }}\\sqrt 3 - d}}{{255{\\rm{\\ }}\\sqrt 3 }} \\end{equation*}$$\nwhere d is the distance between the points representing the color of the most purple, most metachromatic area in an experiment and the pixel under investigation (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0005]). 255⋅√3 is the main diagonal in the RGB cube, i.e., the largest possible distance in the cube. The second metachromasia index is defined according to the following equation:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} inde{x}_2 = \\frac{{{d}_{max} - d}}{{{d}_{max}}} \\end{equation*}$$\nwhere dmax is the distance between the most purple, most metachromatic color and the color of the gray background in the RGB cube. In the third index, d1 is the distance between the projection of the color of the pixel under investigation on the line connecting the most purple and the gray colors in the RGB cube:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} inde{x}_3 = \\frac{{{d}_{max} - {d}_1}}{{{d}_{max}}} \\end{equation*}$$\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e841acdb-2182-42ec-923d-a2b6f98eaf09/cpz1835-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",
    "Quantitative evaluation of metachromasia. Images are analyzed by calculating metachromasia indices that characterize the color in the RGB space. (A) Colors in the RGB model can be represented by a number triplet describing how much red, green, and blue is present on a scale between 0 and 255. According to this model, colors can be represented in a cube in which the X, Y and Z axes represent the red, green, and blue intensities, respectively. (B) The metachromasia indices characterize how similar a certain pixel or area is to the purple shade of the most metachromatic area defined by the user. Explanation of the indices can be found in the main text. The indices can be calculated by the “metachromasiaIndex” program in MATLAB; its graphical user interface is shown in panel (C) Explanations corresponding to the numbers in the blue fields are in the main text. The user must circumscribe the area of interest in the microscopic image (D), and the metachromasia index is calculated for the selected area (E). One of the three images generated, corresponding to the three indices, is shown in the figure.\n11. Follow these steps to evaluate the images (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0005]):\n         \nClick on ‘Open image’ to import a photomicrograph of the entire micromass culture.",
    "Circumscribe the area you would like to evaluate (region of interest, ROI) by clicking on ‘Draw ROI.’ You can draw polygon regions by clicking on corners of the polygon and finishing by double-clicking. You can also draw square- or rectangle-shaped ROIs by holding down the SHIFT or CTRL keys, respectively, while dragging your mouse. You can delete an ROI by right clicking on one of its vertices. A vertex can be moved by left clicking and dragging. You can leave the ROI drawing cycle by a double click. If you draw multiple ROIs, their union constitutes the evaluated area. Such an ROI is shown in Figure 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-fig-0005].\nIdentify the most purple (most metachromatic) color, and the gray color (the background) by clicking on ‘Pick purple’ and ‘Pick gray,’ respectively. You can also manually specify these colors by entering values (0-255) in the text boxes under ‘Define RGB values of purple’ and ‘Define RGB values of gray’. The specified colors are displayed in the box on the right. When evaluating an experiment from a single batch of micromass cultures, it makes sense to define the RGB values of purple and gray globally, i.e., to use the same RGB values for every image in the experiment.",
    "Click on ‘Calculate’ to determine the three different metachromasia indices in the ROI on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This operation generates three images corresponding to the three indices. The means of these pixelwise values are displayed in the blue fields labeled ‘Pixelwise mean’ in the red box. The values under ‘Index from mean colors’ are the metachromasia indices calculated from the mean red, green and blue values in the ROI. A histogram of the pixelwise values of the metachromasia indices is also displayed. By default, the histogram has 100 class intervals, which can be modified by entering a different value into the field ‘# of bins’.\nThe mean values in the blue fields in the red box can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on ‘Copy to clipboard.’\nThe results can be saved by clicking on ‘Save results.’ The pixelwise values of the three indices can be saved in three images, either in TIFF or JPG format. The user must specify a base name that is appended by ‘_1,’ ‘_2’ and ‘_3.’ The three histograms are also saved in a single comma-delimited file.",
    "Alcian blue staining technique is an alternative method to detect the sulfated GAGs in the cartilage ECM. The stained tissue parts are cyan or greenish-blue, and this staining effect is called “Alcianophilia.” Alcian blue staining is pH sensitive; at pH 1.0 it stains sulfated GAGs only, but at pH 2.5 it also stains hyaluronan and sialomucins (Green & Pastewka, 1974[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0008]).\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0001]–3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0003])\n1% (w/v) Alcian blue solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-rec-0001])\nDEPEX mounting medium (Merck, cat. no. 1.00579.0500)\nNOTE: Each step is performed at room temperature in a 24-well plate.

    "The MTT assay is a colorimetric method suitable for the analysis of cell viability, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity. Living cells can reduce the yellow tetrazolium salt in the MTT reagent by mitochondrial oxidoreductase enzymes. This metabolic activity will lead to the formation of purple formazan crystals, which can be dissolved using a solubilization solution. At the end of the reaction, the absorbance of the purple-colored solution at a specific wavelength is measured by a spectrophotometer (van Meerloo et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-bib-0021]).\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0001]–3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.835#cpz1835-prot-0003])\nMTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; VWR, cat. no. 0793-1G), or equivalent\nIsopropanol (Merck, cat. no. 278475), or equivalent\nTriton X-100 (Reanal Labor, cat. no. 32190-0-98-64), or equivalent\nElectronic laboratory balance (Kern ABS 120-4), or equivalent\nWizard Advanced IR vortex mixer (VELP Scientifica), or equivalent\nMicrotiter plate shaker incubator (Stuart SI505), or equivalent\n96-well sterile plastic plate (Eppendorf, cat. no. 0030730119), or equivalent\nMultilabel detection platform (Chameleon microplate reader, Hidex), or equivalent\nMicrosoft Excel, or equivalent\n1.

On a designated day in culture (depending on the experimental setting), measure 5 mg of MTT reagent into sterile 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes on an electronic laboratory balance. Dissolve the MTT powder in sterile 1 × PBS. Final concentration of the MTT solution is 5 mg/ml. Vortex the solution until the powder is fully dissolved.",
    "MTT powder must be stored between 2°C and 8°C in a refrigerator. MTT reagent should be prepared on the day of the experiment when the assay is to be carried out. The MTT solution can be stored for maximum of 4 weeks at 4°C, in a refrigerator.\n3. Remove the 24-well plate containing live micromass cultures from the cell culture incubator and transfer into the laminar flow cabinet. Add 25 µl of MTT reagent (5 mg/ml) into each well containing 1 ml cell culture medium.\nAs the 24-well plate is going to be replaced into the cell culture incubator, care must be taken to adhere to the sterile workflow.\n4. Replace the 24-well plate into the CO2 incubator. Incubate cells for 2 hr.\n5. During the incubation time, prepare the stock solubilization solution: add 10 ml Triton X-100 to 90 ml isopropanol.\nSterile workflow is no longer necessary from this step. Prepare solution on benchtop. Solubilization solution can be stored at room temperature up to 6 months.\n6. At the end of the 2-hour-long incubation, remove the 24-well plate from the CO2 incubator and aspirate the medium from the wells.\nMake sure to completely remove the medium from the wells, as this would detrimentally affect the solubilizing ability of the solubilization solution.\n7. Add 500 µl of the solubilization solution to each well.\n8. Incubate the 24-well plate for ∼10 min at 37°C in a microtiter plate shaker incubator.\nCheck the solubilization after 10 min. If the purple formazan crystals have not completely dissolved, wait for a few more minutes until the crystals are fully solubilized at room temperature. Use an incubator combined with a shaker and shake the plate at 200 rpm if formazan production is visibly intense.",
    "Do not leave the plate in the incubator at 37°C for too long. The solubilization solution may evaporate and there will not be enough solution for the optical density measurements.\nToo vigorous shaking may lead to disintegration of the micromass cultures, resulting in turbid solubilizing solution, which interferes with the optical density readings.\n9. When formazan crystals are completely solubilized, pipette 100–100 µl of the solubilization solution from each well of the 24-well plate into a new 96-well plate (in triplicates; 100 µl/well). For a blank reading, use solubilization solution (use triplicate).\n10. Insert the 96-well plate into the microplate reader. Measure the optical density of the samples at 570 nm.\n11. Analyze the optical density readings with the help of Microsoft Excel or other data analysis software."
