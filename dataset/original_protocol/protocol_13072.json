    "1. Cultivation of worms until calcium imaging\nFour days before a calcium imaging experiment, transfer two adult ST12 worms to a new nematode growth medium (NGM) plate (Table of Materials) on which Escherichia coli OP50 are streaked in a square pattern (approximately 4 mm x 4 mm) using a cell spreader so that the worm spends most of the time in the bacteria during calcium imaging12.\nIncubate this NGM plate for 4 days at 20 °C in an incubator (Table of Materials).\n2. Hardware setup\nPrepare a microscope equipped with a piezoelectric device for stimulation13, a 2x objective lens, a high-speed sCMOS camera, image splitting optics, an x-y motorized stage, an LED light source for excitation, and a computer (Figure 1). Essential specifications of the sCMOS camera include 2560 x 2160 active pixels, 6.5 µm in size, with a 10-tap camera link as an interface option. Key specifications of the X-Y motorized stage include 110 mm x 75 mm travel range, 250 mm/s max velocity, 2,000 mm/s2 max acceleration, and 0.25 µm unidirectional repeatability.\nTurn on the computer and the x-y motorized stage controller.\nTurn on the amplifier and set the Volume adjuster to 10 and the Bass and Treble adjusters to 8.\nTo excite GCaMP and TagRFP, turn on the 488 nm and 560 nm lights of the LED light source. Set the gauges of 470 nm and 550 nm of the control pod in the light source to 5% so that the intensity of the LED light is suitable for imaging.\n\t​NOTE: At this LED intensity, photobleaching of GCaMP and TagRFP fluorescence does not occur during recording.\n3. Software setup for calcium imaging",
    "Download and install three software packages in Windows: mouse macro software, software for controlling vibration property, software for running tracking software, and software for data analysis (Table of Materials).\nDouble click on the tracking software file.\nPush the Run button and wait for 5 min to stabilize the software (Figure 2A).\nProvide the information on exposure time and binning. 0.033 s exposure time with 2 x 2 binning ensures smooth image acquisition (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: Only every 10th image acquired is displayed in order to reduce the memory load.\nProvide the information for image acquisition (Figure 2C). For example, when 500 images are recorded twice with an interval of 10 s, enter 1,000 in the Images Total box, 500 in the Images box, and 10 in the Interval (s) box.\nTurn on the Acquisition button (Figure 2D).\nSplit the fluorescence image using image splitting optics, and the two images (GCaMP channel, 500-525 nm (Figure 2E); TagRFP channel, 584-676 nm (Figure 2F)) are projected onto two halves of the sCMOS camera. Calibrate the coordinates of the GCaMP and TagRFP channels (Figure 2G). Save the software settings.\nSet the directory to output the data file (Figure 2H).\nTurn off the Acquisition button (Figure 2D).\nDouble click on mouse macro system software (Figure 3A) and set the vibration properties (Figure 3B). Read the Assay.txt file with the mouse macro system so that the mouse cursor is controlled based on the coordinates and the schedule in that file (Figure 3A). Set the coordinates of the mouse cursor (magenta squares in Figure 3A) and wait time until stimulation after starting the recording (magenta in Figure 3A). Set the frequency and the amplitude values in the software for vibration control (Figure 3B).\n4. Preparation of worms for calcium imaging",
    "Transfer a single worm expressing both GCaMP and TagRFP from the incubated plate to a new fresh NGM plate on which E. coli OP50 has been streaked.\nAttach the NGM plate to the piezoelectric acoustic transducer using transparent adhesive tape (Figure 4). Do not press the plate onto the actuator because this alters the vibration frequency.\n5. Calcium imaging under the control of specific vibration properties\nTurn on the Acquisition button (Figure 2D).\nFind the worm under bright light and excitation light (488 nm and 560 nm).\nSet the zoom value of microscopy to 2.5x. The field of view is 1.1 mm x 1.1 mm with a resolution of 2.6 µm/pixel.\nTurn off the bright light and turn on the Homing button (Figure 2I) to track the fluorescent spot of a worm. This homing button starts the movement of the X-Y stage to keep the maximum intensity region of the worm in the middle of the field of view in the TagRFP image.\n\tNOTE: In terms of the flp-18 promoter, the fluorescent intensity of the AVA neurons is strongest and those from other neurons are faint or not detected. Therefore, the low magnification system is not required for tracking and the stage moves throughout the recording.\nEnsure that the values of intensity bars in Figure 2E and 2F are approximately 1,000. If they are not, fine-tune the 470 nm and 550 nm gauges of the control pod in the light source.\nPress the Run button in the mouse macro system to allow mouse cursor control according to a schedule described in Figure 3A. This starts to record using the tracking software and stimulate by wave gene software while tracking the worm.\nCheck whether the output BMP file is appropriately created.\n6. Data analysis",
    "Create a folder on the desktop and name it CalciumImaging.\nCreate a folder inside the CalciumImaging folder and name it CIResult, for the output result files.\nDouble click on the DualViewImaging.nb file written in data analysis software for Windows.\nInsert the file path to the CIResult folder (e.g., DirectoryName[/Users/Sugi0911/Desktop/CalciumImaging/CIResult/test.rtf]) (Figure 5).\nInsert the file path to the folder including the BMP file (e.g., SetDirectory[/Users/Sugi0911/Desktop/XXX/]) (Figure 5), in which XXX denotes the folder name including BMP files.\nPush the Shift and Return keys simultaneously to start an automatic analysis. This analysis uses the value of a maximum intensity region of field of view in the TagRFP image (See the legend of Figure 6 for detailed calculation procedure in the program).\nCheck whether the following output files are appropriately created in the CIResult folder.\n\tXXX-GCaMP.tif (image file illustrating traces of GCaMP intensities for all images)\n\tXXX-GCaMP.xls (spreadsheet file listing GCaMP intensities in all images)\n\tXXX-TagRFP.tif (image file illustrating traces of intensities of TagRFP for all images)\n\tXXX-TagRFP.xls (spreadsheet file listing TagRFP intensities in all images)\n\tXXX-Ratio.tif (image file illustrating traces of the ratio value for all images)\n\tXXX-Ratio.xls (spreadsheet file listing the ratio value in all images)\nSubscription Required.
