    "1. Preparation of passive avoidance apparatus\nDrill a 4 mm hole perpendicular to the wall surface of the 14 mL polypropylene culture tube and 8 mm away from the tube bottom.\n\tNOTE: Use an electric drill and 5/32 drill bit for best results.\nUsing a steel utility knife, cut off the upper part of the 14 mL polypropylene culture tube to create a 45 mm long tube bottom fragment. The bottom fragment serves as the lower compartment.\nCut off the tip of 1,000 µL blue pipette tip using a single edge razor blade to make the opening wide enough for a passage of a single fly. Cut off the narrowing part of the blue tip to create a 12 mm fragment. Insert this fragment firmly into a 4 mm hole of the lower compartment. This is used as a loading dock for transferring the flies.\nCut a 15 mm piece of transparent vinyl tubing 5/8\" ID (see Table of Materials) to create a coupling. Insert upper and lower compartment into the coupling from opposite ends to securely attach the lower compartment to the upper compartment.\nUsing a 2-prong adjustable clamp, attach the assembly to a vertical stand. Orient the assembly vertically with the shock tube as an upper compartment.\nConnect the shock tube wires to an electrical stimulator (see Table of Materials) to deliver electric shocks. The duration of the training period is 1 min.\n\t​NOTE: To facilitate observation, position a piece of white paper behind the shock tube to serve as a white background of the apparatus. Put a lamp with a 75 W equivalent soft light bulb above the shock compartment. Place an adjustable arm magnifier lamp in front of the setup. A representation of the passive avoidance apparatus is shown in Figure 1.",
    "2. Preparation of the flies for the passive avoidance procedure\nImmobilize 3-4 day old D. melanogaster or D. simulans flies using ice-cold block and transfer them into individual vials with food 24 h before the experiment (1 fly per vial) following the procedure described previously19.\n\tNOTE: The experiments described here compared 3-4 day-old male vs. female flies in D. melanogaster and D. simulans.\nBefore the behavioral experiments, code all the vials. For this, assign each group a letter, for example, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc., and each fly a number. Reveal this code only after all data have been recorded and analyzed. Use at least 20 flies per genotype or treatment to counter individual variations.\n\t​NOTE: Performing the experiments and analyses \"blind\" allows excluding a bias in assessing the performance of the fly and data analysis.\n3. Performing the first trial\nUsing a fly mouth aspirator (see Table of Materials) described previously20, gently transfer a fly from the individual vial into the lower compartment via the loading dock. Gently suck one fly into the mouth aspirator by sucking air. Deposit the fly by lightly blowing into the loading dock.\n\tNOTE: Avoid stressing the animal during catching and loading.\nImmediately after the fly is loaded into the lower compartment, start a 1 min timer and stopwatch.\n\tNOTE: The stopwatch is used to measure latencies and tally counter to count the number of shocks.\nPress the stopwatch to record the first latency when the fly enters the shock tube by placing all paws on the grid. Turn on the stimulator to deliver an electric shock to the fly. The stimulation parameters are 120 volts, 1000 ms duration, 1 pulse/s (PPS), train duration 2000 ms.",
    "Deliver additional shocks if fly re-enters shock tube. Record the number of received shocks during a 1 min trial with a tally counter or an Arduino-based counter (see Table of Materials). If using the Arduino-based counter, please follow the steps below.\n\tNOTE: An optional Arduino-based device AKM-007 (see Table of Materials) can be used to measure time, latency, the number of shocks, and the frequency and duration of grooming bouts for each animal by pressing and releasing the corresponding buttons on the device. The buttons on the device are assigned to measure latency, administer and record the number of shocks, and measure the frequency and duration of grooming bouts.\n\t\nPress the Start button at step 3.2., and press the Shock button at step 3.3.\nTo record the duration of a grooming bout, press the Grooming button at the beginning of a grooming bout on the device and release this button at the end of the grooming bout.\n\t\tNOTE: The grooming bouts were measured throughout 1 min trial. Extensive grooming could be indicative of animal stress21,22. The Arduino-based device saves all data as CSV file to a memory card.\nAt the end of a 1 min trial, gently transfer the fly back to an individual vial. Write down the latency, the number of received shocks, and any notable changes in the behavior.\nClean the lower and shock compartment with 70% ethanol, wipe with a lint-free cleaning tissue (see Table of Materials), and dry with the hairdryer. Repeat the trial with the next fly.\nAfter the behavioral experiments, clean the lower compartment with water and odorless detergent. Wipe the lower compartment and the shock compartment with 70% ethanol, and air-dry overnight.\n4. Performing the second trial",
    "Perform the second trial by repeating the procedure described above (step 3) 24 h later. Test the flies in the same sequence as in the previous day.\n5. Analysis of the results\nCalculate the average latency, the average number of shocks, and duration of grooming bouts for trial 1 and trial 2 for each experimental group of animals. Perform student t-test for two-group comparison or ANOVA for multiple comparisons with post-hoc analyses using Tukey's test23.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
