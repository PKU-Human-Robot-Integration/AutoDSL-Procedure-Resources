    "Preparation for slice recording (1 day)High-glucose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) is used when incubating brain slices; standard aCSF is used for patch-clamp recordings. For both, prepare a 10x stock solutions (see Recipes section).Prepare Cesium-gluconate with QX-314 intracellular solution (see Recipes section) and aliquot. Making brain slices and patch-clamp recording (1 day)At 3-5 weeks post injection, anesthetize the mouse with ketamine (100 mg/kg) + xylazine (15 mg/kg).Open the skull along the sagittal suture with scissors, reflect the skull flaps, and remove the brain into ice-cold high-glucose aCSF (75 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 0.7 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM glucose; see Recipes section), saturated with carbogen.Make 300 μm thick slices for each area of interest. To establish the functional connectome of the VTA dopamine neurons, recordings were done in four different coronal sections containing the striatum, the amygdala, the hippocampal formation, or the anterior cortex.Preincubate slices in high-glucose aCSF saturated with carbogen for at least 1 h at room temperature for recovery.During the incubation time, pull patch pipettes with pipette resistance between 4 and 8 MΩ (tip diameter ~1 µm).Transfer one slice to the recording chamber (submerged, 500 μl volume) on the stage of the fluorescence microscope and secure the slice with the harp. The recording chamber should be continuously perfused (1.5 ml/min) with standard aCSF (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and 25 mM glucose; see Recipes section) saturated with carbogen, and maintained at 31-33 °C.Glutamatergic responses are isolated by blocking dopamine, GABA and acetylcholine actions with a cocktail of antagonists added to the perfusate: 10 μM SR95531, 3 μM CGP55345, 10 μM SCH23390, 10 μM (−)-sulpiride and 1 μM scopolamine.",
    "Focus on the area of interest using a 10x objective and then use the 60x and a camera to identify the cell to patch. All recordings should be done in areas with visible ChR2-EYFP axons.Voltage-clamp recordings are performed with a -75 mV holding potential with the sodium channel blocker (QX-314) in the intracellular solution to block active currents. Cell activity can be monitored in cell attached mode. Once whole-cell mode is achieved, neurons can only be identified based on cell body location, size, and shape, since cesium-based pipette solution including QX-314 blocks intrinsic activity. After locating a healthy cell, backfill the patch pipette with the filtered (by 0.2 µm pore syringe filter) cesium-gluconate intracellular solution using the non-metal syringe needle, and mount the pipette in the pipette holder on the micromanipulator. Before immersing the pipette tip in the bath, apply a gentle positive pressure to the glass pipette; this prevents dilution of the intracellular solution due to aspiration of bath solution and clogging of the pipette.Advance the pipette to the chosen cell with the micromanipulator. After touching the cell membrane with the tip of the pipette, gently advance to dimple the membrane. Release the positive pressure and confirm that the tip resistance increases, then apply gentle negative pressure to the pipette and apply negative holding potential to achieve a GΩ seal, wait 1-2 min for the seal to maximize. Apply further negative pressure to rupture the membrane at the tip of the pipette for whole cell recording, quickly releasing the negative pressure from the pipette after breaking through. To minimize baseline noise for better detection of small amplitude excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) series resistance is not compensated (see Notes).",
    "Data acquisition using Axograph X or pClamp commences 5 min after achieving whole-cell mode, to allow for diffusion of intracellular solution into recorded cells.Photostimulate with short flashes (5 msec at 0.1 Hz) of a high-power blue LED illumination every 10 sec (0.1 Hz) to evoke synaptic responses. To monitor series resistance, a 5 mV, 5 msec voltage pulse is applied 50 msec before each photostimulation. Record a minimum of 20 responses per cell.Glutamatergic responses should be confirmed by perfusion of 40 μM CNQX, allowing at least 5 min after drug application for full effect."
