    "Due to its versatility, efficiency, and precision, the CRISPR system has superseded previous tools to modify genomic information (Gaj, Sirk, Shui, & Liu, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0006]). The most common application is creating gene knock-outs through the introduction of double-strand breaks followed by repair through the NHEJ pathway. This protocol provides a basic outline of the considerations and steps necessary for the use of CHOPCHOP when targeting Cas9 to genes. For additional considerations, see Strategic Planning.\nMaterials\nComputer, tablet, or phone\nModern browser with javascript enabled (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)\nPerform search\n1. Go to https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no[href=https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no].\n2. Enter the gene of interest in the “Target” field.\nAs an example, we use the zebrafish gene elof1 (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0002]). To avoid possible confusion due to ambiguous nomenclature, we recommend using RefSeq or ENSEMBL gene ID and not gene names when possible.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a971e12d-8b4b-4b1b-a6da-0f0a492859d2/cpz146-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nHome screen of CHOPCHOP website. Top: Links for additional information on advanced options (“Instructions”), how gRNA ranking is performed (“Scoring”), and general information about the tool (“About,” “Updates”). Help and additional requests can be accessed through “Submission,” “Contact” or “FAQ”. Center: Main fields for gRNA design where one specifies the gene/transcript of interest (“Target”) and selects the genome (“In”) and the planned experiment (“Using”, “For”). Immediately below, additional options can be specified using the grey buttons. Bottom: To perform the search, press the black “Find Target Sites!” button.\n3. Choose the genome of interest in the “In” field.\nHere, we use the genome build Danio rerio (danRer11/GRCz11). The dropdown menu provides genomes from common model organisms as well as many others. Some organisms are supported with multiple genome versions. If your preferred organism is not present, click “Add new species” for a custom request.\n4. Choose “CRISPR/Cas9” in the “Using” field.\n5. Choose “knock-out” in the “For” field.",
    "6. Optional: Modify the default search based on needs using the “Options” button. For example:\n         \nSelect a specific gene feature to target (e.g., 5′-UTR or coding region) under “Options” → “General” → “Target specific region of gene”.\nSpecify a preferred set of restriction enzymes to validate mutations under “Options” → “General” → “Restriction enzymes”.\nSpecify preferences for primer design under “Options” → “Primers”.\nFor information about other important options, see Critical Parameters.\nTargeting effector proteins for chosen genetic loci follows the same ranking logic, but different “Options” for target locus definition (see Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0002]).\n7. Press “Find Target Sites!”.\nInterpret results\n8. In the genome locus view of the results (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0003], top), identify a gRNA that fits your purpose.\nOne can drag to navigate left and right along the genomic locus and scroll to zoom in on a specific genomic region.\nConsider your experimental needs. For example, choose a gRNA that targets splice sites, regions downstream of in-frame ATGs, or exons of important domains.\nConsider the number of off-targets based on color coding (green indicates almost no off-targets, orange indicates some off-targets, and red indicates many off-targets).\nThis may change with future updates, but is specifically described under the “Scoring” link.\nConsider the directionality of binding (indicated by black arrowheads).\nConsider placement of in-frame ATG start codons (green lines) to avoid re-initiation.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/18202245-8b2f-4d1f-9467-9e3800830ab8/cpz146-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "General results screen for gene knock-out using the gene elof1 in the Danio rerio genome danRer11 as an example. On the top is the genome view of the gene with identified gRNAs. This view can be toggled left/right and zoomed in/out. The gene model is drawn with the name of each isoform. Thick blue boxes represent exons, thin blue boxes represent untranslated regions, and green lines indicates in-frame start codons. gRNAs are displayed as arrows, with colors matching the scoring. Directionality is indicated by black arrowheads. Immediately below the genome view are options to download all identified gRNA targets (left) or view the results in the UCSC Genome Browser (right). On the bottom is a ranked list of all gRNA targets found, with all features necessary to make an informed decision. Clicking on a gRNA in the list or the graphical representation opens a detailed results view (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0004]).\n9. In the table view (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0003], bottom), sort by clicking the header of any column.\nThe default ranking is based on the score. The score is defined primarily by number of off-targets, with efficiency as the second-most important feature. Depending on your preferences, the results can be sorted based on efficiency only, ignoring possible off-target effects.\n10. Review all listed features of your preferred gRNAs. Make sure that the GC content fits your needs and that self-complementarity is not too high.\nSelf-complementarity represents 4-mer based complementary regions inside the gRNA and its scaffold which impede efficiency due to RNA folding. Low/high GC content is also known to lower gRNA efficiency. These features are supplementary and the efficiency score already accounts for these for many of the default models.",
    "11. Optional: Download the complete list of proposed targets by choosing a preferred format in the “Download results” box (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0003], top-left).

When a suitable candidate is found, click on the graphical representation or the table entry to open a detailed view.\nBy default, the detailed page will open in a new browser window, allowing detailed comparison of multiple candidates.\n14. Inspect the detailed view (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0004]) for important considerations.\nAs an example, we use the gRNA ranked no. 4. The top of the detailed view lists the target, rank, and sequence of the gRNA. The target is shown in black, with the expected genome edit site highlighted in light blue.\nConsider primer pairs that can be used for validation experiments (shown in violet).\nIn the table view, each primer pair is listed with coordinates, sequences, melting temperatures, and product size. This information can be downloaded in Genbank or .tsv format.\nConsider restriction sites (green and red) boxes.\nMoving the cursor over a restriction site will display the name of the enzyme. Before choosing a gRNA that modifies a restriction site, verify that the enzyme can be retrieved from your local source, and that it does not cut too often within the PCR product, making analysis impossible. To be used efficiently for experiment validation, the restriction site should be as close as possible to the expected mutation site.\nConsider off-targets.",
    "Any possible off-targets are listed at the bottom of the table view, with genomic location and possible off-target mismatches highlighted in red (there are no off-targets in this example).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e359bcb6-f378-4570-882c-861dc74b1eef/cpz146-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nDetailed results view for gRNA rank 4 from Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0003]. The top-left corner summarizes details about the specific gRNA hit. Below this is a genome view of the specific target site. This view can be toggled left/right and zoomed in/out. Proposed primer pairs for validation are shown at the top (violet). Immediately below is the gRNA location and directionality (black arrow) with precise dsDNA cut site (light blue). Restriction enzyme sites that can used for mutation validation are also shown (red, green). The genome view is followed by the list of proposed primer pairs with their features, and a list with possible genome off-targets, including location, sequence, and possible mismatches (highlighted in red). In this example, no off-targets were found.\n15. Once a preferred target has been found, copy the target sequence from the top left corner of the results page.\nBe aware that the displayed sequence includes the PAM sequence. The gRNA should NOT include the PAM, so the sequence must be modified before ordering. In our example in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0004], the target sequence is AGGGAACGGAGTCGAAATACCGG and the gRNA sequence is AGGGAACGGAGTCGAAATAC.",
    "The CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used not only for creating breaks in the genome, but also to recruit effectors to specific genomic locations by fusing effector domains to Cas9 (Adli, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0001]). The superior target specificity and the modular setup of the CRISPR system make it an ideal tool for fusion protein targeting. In these approaches, the Cas9 protein is mutated to be enzymatically inactive and not produce DNA breaks. This so-called dead Cas9 (dCas9) is fused with an effector domain targeted to a specific genomic location. These effectors can be transcription activators (Konermann et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0009]), repressors (Yeo et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0028]), fluorescent tags (Ye, Rong, & Lin, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0027]), or other proteins (Berckman & Chen, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0002]; Lei et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0012]; Xu et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0028a]; Ribeiro, Ribeiro, Barreto, & Ward, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0020]; Tsui et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0024]; Vora, Tuttle, Cheng, & Church, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0026]). Combining these Cas9 effectors with specific gRNAs will elicit the desired effect at the targeted genomic locus and not elsewhere.\n1. Follow steps 1-4 as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0001].\n2. Select “activation” or “repression” in the “For” field.\nFor effectors that do not fall into these categories, choose either of the two and adjust the options for target definition (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0001], step 6) according to your needs.\n3. Define a specific genomic range for recruiting the effector under “Options” → “General”.\nDefault for activation is 300 bp upstream and 0 bp downstream of the annotated TSS. Default for repression is 200 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream of the annotated TSS. These definitions can be adjusted based on your needs.\n4. Optional: Modify other advanced options under “Options” (see Strategic Planning).\n5. Press “Find Target Sites!” and proceed with interpretation as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0001].",
    "Although the results display and interpretation are similar to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0001], the considerations for selecting a good gRNA differ. Here, position is typically most important (e.g., adjacent to or overlapping the promoter). A thorough understanding of possible alternative promoters and surrounding chromatin features (including insulators) is essential to making the right choice. Additionally, it can be advantageous to choose an array of gRNAs that are spaced throughout the promoter to maximize the desired effect. Finally, one should be prepared to accept lower-ranked gRNAs, as promoters present smaller targets with more limited options. These features can complicate the design of a highly specific and efficient gRNA.",
    "In the specific cases of targeting transgenic sequences in living organisms or designing gRNAs against plasmids, the user provides the sequence to search for targets and the choice of genome only applies to the off-target search.\n1. Prepare the target sequence (plasmid or transgenic sequence) as a single FASTA file.\nCHOPCHOP considers only the first sequence for multi-FASTA files. Thus, a separate search is required for each sequence.\n2. Go to https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no[href=https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no].\n3. Press the “Paste Target” button (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0002]).\n4.

Adjust ranking by clicking on the “Efficiency” column twice to sort results by the highest predicted editing efficiency.\n6. Proceed as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0001] beginning with step 4.",
    "Design for RNA targeting with Cas13 (formerly C2C2) has proven useful for applications such as viral detection (Freije et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0005]; Gootenberg et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0007]) and temporary alteration of pathogenic mutations (Cox et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0003]). CHOPCHOP supports identification of optimal gRNAs for targeting RNA through its RNA knock-down mode. In this mode, off-targets are identified not on the genome, but rather the transcriptome. CHOPCHOP still optimizes for GC content, self-complementarity, and off-targets, but also optimizes for local RNA structure. In these cases, the PAM sequence is replaced by its RNA equivalent, the protospacer flanking sequence (PFS).\nPerform search\n1. Visit the website https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no[href=https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no].\n2. Enter the gene or transcript name or ID in the “Target” field.\nAs an example, we use the human gene ext1.

    "The constitutive column can have value 0 or 1, where 1 means the guide is targeting all isoforms of the gene. The columns IsoformsMM0 to IsoformsMM3 show which isoforms of the gene are being targeted by gRNA, with increasing number of mismatches. In our example, all three isoforms are targeted by the gRNA with 0 mismatch, indicated also by constitutive value 1.\nConsider the MM0, MM1, MM2, and MM3 columns.\nThese count how many isoforms of the gene are targeted by a gRNA with an increasing number of mismatches (from 0 to 3). These columns do not count off-targets that belong to the family of isoforms of the targeted gene; these can be found in the IsoformMM0-MM3 columns.\nConsider the local structure score.\nLocal structure influences on-target efficiency, as Cas13 binds preferentially to unstructured regions. The CHOPCHOP local structure score is computed using RNAfold from the ViennaRNA package. Accessibility in the RNA is calculated in windows of 70 nt and indicates the probability that a given nucleotide position in the transcript is unpaired and therefore accessible to a gRNA. For each target, we take the mean probability across each position. The smaller the value, the less likely there is secondary structure in the transcript at that gRNA target site.\n9. In the table view, sort the gRNAs by clicking on any column header.\nRank is defined primarily by number of off-targets, with local structure as the second-most important feature.

    "The CRISPR/Cas9 system is commonly used to insert new sequences into a locus of interest. CRISPR knock-in allows site-specific gene engineering via programmable nuclease-induced DNA DSBs and subsequent repair by cellular repair pathways (both HDR and NHEJ).

For knock-in experiments, the crucial parameters of homology arm length and cut site can be directly toggled and viewed on the results page. These parameters can be used to retrieve the homology arms of interest for your experiment.\n9.

Use the toggles (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0005]) to adjust the cut site respective to the PAM and the length of homology arms (20-800 bp).",
    "Cas9 cuts 3 bp from the PAM sequence, but this offset varies for each Cas protein. Users should confirm the offset for the Cas of choice.\nIf longer arms are desired (up to 2 kb), the size of the flanking sequence must be changed in the initial search (“Options” → “General” → “Displayed flanking sequence length in detailed view”).\nWhen choosing the HDR method and the length of homology arms, the following should be considered:\nHDR with single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs) is preferred for correction of one or a few mutations due to its low cost (thanks to the small size of sdODNs: 90-220 nt) and the relatively high associated editing efficacy. This uses homology arms of ∼100 bp. This strategy is easily applied at the cellular level, but not with in vivo corrections due to the lack of a delivery method.\nHDR for in vivo applications can be prepared as plasmids carrying the desired sequence flanked by long homology arms (typically 800 bp). This allows for precise insertion of large constructs at specific loci.\nHomology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) uses homology arms of ∼800 bp as well as CRISPR targets flanking the donor DNA, similar to those used for NHEJ (see Alternate Protocol 3). HMEJ allows target integration and has the highest reported efficiency among all existing strategies in cultured cells, animal embryos, and in vivo tissues. This new combination strategy allows repair to be mediated by either NHEJ or HDR, depending on the cell type.\n11. Once a preferred target has been found, copy the target sequence from the top left corner of the results page.",
    "Be aware that the displayed target sequence includes the PAM, which should not be included in the gRNA sequence when ordered. In Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0004], the target sequence is AGGGAACGGAGTCGAAATACCGG and the gRNA sequence is AGGGAACGGAGTCGAAATAC.",
    "NHEJ relies not on DNA sequence homology, but rather ligation of broken DNA ends (Cubbon, Ivancic-Bace, & Bolt, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0004]). This can be leveraged by introducing a plasmid containing a donor DNA construct to be integrated in the genomic DNA. In eukaryotes, NHEJ occurs predominantly in G1 phase and is inhibited during mitosis to prevent undesirable chromosome fusions at telomeres (Nami et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0016]; Rees & Liu, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0019]; Suzuki et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0022]). NHEJ is an error-prone pathway that often creates insertions or deletions of nucleotides (indels). Indels can cause frameshifts in protein coding regions, leading to truncation and inactivity after translation. This is the repair pathway used for knock-outs when no donor sequence is introduced.\nFor an NHEJ knock-in, the gRNA is designed as normal to target the site of interest. The donor DNA, however, is designed with flanking sites identical to the target so that Cas9 cleaves the genomic target sequence at one location and the donor plasmid at two locations (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0001]-G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0001]). This releases a donor sequence between the flanking sites that contains the desired insert. The sequence should also lack homology arms so that repair of the Cas9-induced genomic DSB cannot occur through the HDR pathway. Instead, cleavage generates blunt ends at the target site and at both ends of the donor sequence. The linearized donor DNA sequence can then be used for repair by the NHEJ pathway, allowing for its integration into the genomic target site. Once incorporated into the genome, the donor DNA disrupts the Cas9 target sequence and prevents further Cas9-induced DSBs. If the target DSB is rejoined by error-free NHEJ without donor DNA insertion, the Cas9 target sequence will remain intact and a second round of Cas9 cutting will ensue.\n1. Follow steps 1-9 as in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0005].",
    "2. Unless HMEJ or MMEJ is desired, design your template with your donor DNA without homology arms but with the same Cas9 target sequence. Remember to also include PAM sequences. We recommend following one the following for design of donor sequences:\n         \nFor homology-independent targeted insertion (HITI), flank the donor sequence by one (for circular donor) or two (for linear donors) gRNA target sites.\nA third identical sequence in the reverse orientation is in the target locus in which the donor DNA is to be pasted. This allows for knock-in in the correct orientation, as intact gRNA target sequence persists if inserted in the reverse orientation (Suzuki & Izpisua Belmonte, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0021]; Suzuki et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0022]).\nFor microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), flank the donor sequence by the two microhomology arms. To avoid promoter interference, ensure that integration is in the opposite orientation of the endogenous gene.\nMMEJ relies on 5-25 bp of sequence complementarity (microhomology) between DNA strands. It can occur in most of the cell cycle, which leads to higher knock-in efficiency than HDR knock-in (Nakamae et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0015]). The short arm lengths make it very easy to add in a single PCR without amplification from genomic DNA. MMEJ can perform seamless knock-in without carrying any of the target sequence from the gRNA. It requires three gRNAs, and the donor vector must include two different gRNA target sites.",
    "Whether using HDR or NHEJ, knock-in approaches relying on DSB repair can have adverse effects on off-target loci. To reduce the risk of off-target genome edits and increase the chance of specific knock-in sequence insertions, one approach is to introduce SSBs flanking the site of insertion. Single nicks are usually efficiently corrected through cellular repair mechanisms without the introduction of mutations; however, two nicks in close vicinity can activate DSB repair pathways that can be leveraged for HDR-mediated knock-in (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0005]; Mali et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0013]). This strategy can be implemented using Cas9 nickases (Trevino & Zhang, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0023]). Cas9 nickases have one of the nuclease domains inactivated. The Cas9 D10A mutant cuts the DNA strand complementary to the gRNA (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0001]), whereas the Cas9 N863A mutant cuts the opposite DNA strand. By using either of the nickases and designing a pair of gRNAs at optimal distance (Ran et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0018]), one can exploit HDR-driven knock-in insertion. This strategy has the advantage of only allowing knock-in if both gRNAs introduce nicks at the same time on the same DNA. Any single gRNA cut event (whether on- or off-target) is efficiently repaired, reducing the risk of off-target mutations. For additional considerations, see Strategic Planning.\n1. Follow steps 1-3 as in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0005].\n2. Choose “CRISPR/Cas9 nickase” in the “Using” field.\n3. Choose “knock-in” in the “For” field.\n4. Optional: Modify the default search based on your needs using the “Options” button. To modify the optimal distance between two gRNAs (and possible off-targets shown), go do “Options” → “Cas9 nickase” → “Distance between guides”.\nThis can be useful to restrict the results to only optimal matches or to allow possible suboptimal matches that fit closer to your desired genome locus. For details on optimal distance between guides, see Strategic Planning.",
    "5. Press “Find Target Sites!”.\n6. In the genome locus view (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0006]), identify a gRNA pair that fits your purposes.\nThe two gRNA targets are color-coded in blue and red (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-fig-0006]). CHOPCHOP only displays pairs with correct orientation and distance. CHOPCHOP only considers PAM-out configurations to be effective in HDR-driven knock-in experiments (Mali et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-bib-0013]). The most important consideration is having an optimal distance between the gRNA DNA lesions (how to change this is outlined in step 4). However, genomic locus restrictions might make it necessary to adjust the predefined distance offset.\nThe number of off-target hits for any single gRNA is less important in these experiments, as SSBs are expected to be efficiently repaired. This makes the on-target efficiency and gRNA pair distance the most important features for choosing the correct target pairs.\nFor additional details on choosing gRNAs, see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.46#cpz146-prot-0001]. The cut site offset from the PAM should only be adjusted when an enzyme other than Cas9 is used.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/32fd659a-cc27-4b32-b391-86b20503228c/cpz146-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nResults view for a Cas9 nickase knock-in experiment on zebrafish elof1.
