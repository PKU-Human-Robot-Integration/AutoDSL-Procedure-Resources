    "All animal interventions are performed in accordance with the European Convention for Animal Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. All experiments are approved by the local ethics committee. The procedure of ON injury in mice is described elsewhere9.\n1. Intravitreal Manganese Injection\nPerform the Mn2+ injection 24 hr prior to the MR scan with the help of an assistant. Anesthetize the animals by intraperitoneal injection of a 5% chloral hydrate solution (420-450 mg/kg body weight in sterile PBS). For additional topical anesthesia, apply one drop of liquid conjuncain (0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride) to the cornea prior to eye puncture. To inject 15 nmol Mn2+ per eye prepare a 7.5 mM MnCl2 solution, e.g., by diluting 1 L of 1 M MnCl2 stock solution in 132 L H2O. Load 5 µl of the final solution into a 5 µl Hamilton syringe connected to a 34 G small hub removable needle (RN needle).\nWhen starting with the right eye, position the mouse left-sided under a binocular microscope and gently open and fix the right eye between the thumb and forefinger of your left hand. Pick up the syringe with your right hand and take hold of the needle close to the tip. For atraumatic puncture of the eye bulb, carefully insert the needle into the vitreous body at the infero-temporal circumference approximately 1 mm distal to the limbus, thereby sparing scleral vessels.",
    "Next, the assistant slowly applies the total volume of 2 μl while controlling the scale of the Hamilton syringe. During this procedure, monitor optimal needle placement under the microscope and avoid puncture of the lens or spilling of the liquid. Keep the needle statically inserted for an additional 30 sec, then withdraw it slowly to minimize liquid leakage from the injection site.\nThroughout the procedure, special care should be taken to avoid pressure to the eye. Likewise, avoid harsh or numerous attempts to puncture the eye bulb. Since Mn2+ uptake into RGCs and transport along the ON is already saturated at 15 nmol MnCl2, this minimizes signal variations by slightly imprecise injection volumes. For bilateral signal enhancement of the visual projection, repeat the injection procedure for the left eye.\nApply ofloxacin-containing (3 mg/ml) eye drops and panthenol-containing ointment once after the procedure to prevent ocular infections and drying of the eye. Return the mice to their cages under normal housing conditions until the start of the MR scan.\n2. Animal Preparation for MRI\nAnesthetize the mouse by administration of a 2%/98% isoflurane/oxygen gas mixture. Mount the mouse on a mouse holder in an almost horizontal, untwisted position. Insert it into the MR coil, which is then adjusted inside the MR scanner. Monitor respiration and heart rate by appropriate systems. For technical details, see Herrmann et al20.",
    "During MRI, supply anesthesia by continuous insufflation of an initially 1.5%/98.5% isoflurane/oxygen gas mixture via an evaporator connected to the mouse head holder by an integrated tube. During the scan, adjust the deepness of anesthesia according to the recorded vital parameters (i.e. aim for a stable respiration rate of about 40 breaths per minute). Using a heating device keep the body surface temperature stable between 35 and 37 °C, as measured by a thermal sensor positioned at the abdominal site of the mouse. For technical details, see Herrmann et al17.\nAfter the scan, liberate the mouse from the holder and supply with pure oxygen to accelerate recovery from anesthesia. Additionally, keep the body temperature stable by using a red light heating source.\n3. MRI Protocol\nThe protocol is validated for a 3 Tesla scanner equipped with a dedicated, SNR-efficient, small animal coil (linearly polarized Litz coil) with an effective field of view of 35 mm × 38 mm diameter. Operate the coil in transmit-receive mode.\nWith the animal in its final position, adjust the tune and match of the coil with the aid of a frequency analyzer. Manually adjust the transmitter reference voltage and the shim currents to optimize image homogeneity and quality.",
    "Acquire T1 weighted 2D TSE images with a resolution of 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 2 mm in sagittal and transversal view for planning. Using the planning MR scans, acquire the MEMR images in coronal measurement direction, rotated to be parallel to the animal’s head with phase encoding along the left-right direction. To minimize acquisition time, use a rectangular field of view adjusted to the actual head dimensions. Employ a spoiled 3D FLASH sequence (VIBE 3D) using the following parameters: base matrix 256, field of view 54 mm × 50.65 mm × 14.08 mm, using 93.8% rectangular field of view in phase encode direction, and 128 slices of 0.11-mm slice thickness with slice resolution set to 61%.\nActivate the in-plane interpolation to create final images with 512 × 480 × 128, providing an effective resolution of 0.21 mm × 0.21 mm × 0.18 mm (0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.09 mm interpolated), echo time TE = 6.51 msec, repetition time TR = 16 msec, bandwidth = 160 Hz/px, flip angle = 22°. Apply two averages and three repetitions to achieve a total acquisition time (TA) of approximately 30 min.\n4. MRI Data Analysis\nAnalyze the data using the software syngo fastView. For quantitative signal enhancement, select defined regions of interest in 2D planar MRI recordings and determine signal intensities (SI) of the enhanced structure (SIMEMRI), tissue background (SIbackgr), and the standard deviation of the noise (SDN). Where necessary, use a mouse brain atlas to facilitate neuro-anatomical orientation for LGN and SC structures. Calculate the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) using the formula:\nCNR = (SIMEMRI– SIbackgr) / SDN\nQuantify three consecutive images for mean CNR calculation for each sample. In bilaterally injected animals, analyze each hemisphere independently.",
    "For depiction of horizontal, coronal and sagittal images, calculate multiplanar reconstructions from the original 3D MRI data set. These processed images are not recommended for quantitative analysis. To create animated 3D reconstructions (maximum intensity projections, MIPs) of the retino-tectal projection, use an angiography post-processing software module.\n5. Mn2+ Autometallography (TIMM Staining)\nFor TIMM staining of Mn2+ traced brain structures following MEMRI, inject a dosage of 15-150 nmol Mn2+ ivit 24 hr prior to imaging.\nAfter the MR scan, perfuse the animals with 30 ml ice-cold 0.325% Na2S in PBS (pH 7.4). Dissect retinae and freeze samples in Frozen section.\nCut sequential, equatorial sections of 15 µm thickness on a cryotome.\nPerform TIMM staining21 in the absence of fixative and cryoprotection according to Angenstein et al22.\n6. Statistical Analysis\nPerform statistical analyses using the Student’s t-test for single comparisons, followed by post hoc ANOVA. Data are presented as mean ± standard error. Individual N numbers are given separately for each experiment. Results reaching P ≤ 0.05 are considered statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05, *; P ≤ 0.01, **; P ≤ 0.001, ***).Subscription Required.
