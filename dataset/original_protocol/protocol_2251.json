    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDerivation of endoreduplicated trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) from trophoblast stem cells (TSCs)\nTSCs were a kind gift from Professor Janet Rossant, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Toronto, Canada were derived as described before (Tanaka et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). These cells are not commercially available.\nMurine TSCs have also been derived by Ohinata and Tsukiyama (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]. These cells are also not available commercially.\nTSC maintenance\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis section describes the thawing of cryopreserved TSCs, maintenance and the propagation steps.\nThawing.\nThaw a frozen vial of murine TSC in a 37°C water bath.\nTransfer the contents of the vial gently onto a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube containing 5 mL TS complete media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1859-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Trophoblast stem cell (TSC) culture\n(A) Preparation of TSC complete media and TSC maintenance media.\n(B) Schematic illustration of thawing and sub-culturing of TSCs. Scale: 30 μm.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the media to remove the DMSO containing freezing media completely.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL TSC maintenance media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and maintain the cells at 37°C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO2 for 48 h.\nCritical: To ensure maximum viability of TSCs, perform rapid cell thawing. Make sure to remove all DMSO present in the freezing media during the thawing procedure. Traces of residual DMSO might affect the viability of TSCs.\nSubculturing.\nPassage the cells at 60% confluence with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). For sub-culturing, wash the cell monolayer with sterile DPBS to remove traces of FBS, incubate TSCs with sufficient amount of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to cover the entire surface for 30 s at 37°C in an incubator and neutralize with double amount of TS complete media.",
    "Mix the cell suspension very gently and transfer to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in TSC maintenance media and subculture at 1:3 ratios.\nCritical: During preparation of TSC maintenance media, mix properly after the addition of mitogens such that FGF4 and heparin are distributed homogenously in the media. Do not allow the cells to grow at more than 65% confluence as this might result in spontaneous differentiation of the stem cells. Do not use till high passages for experimental purposes as this might result in a gradual loss of the stem cell population. Recommended, till passage 22. Do not perform trypsinization for more than five minutes as this might result in the loss of surface receptors.\nAt this point, cells can be cryopreserved as mentioned previously in MEF harvesting point 16.\nDifferentiation of TSCs into TGCs\nTiming: 8 days (TSCs cultured for 2 days and differentiation for 6 days).\nTSCs are induced to differentiate by withdrawal of mitogens.\nObtain a pellet of TSCs as mentioned in b.\nWash the cell pellet with 5 mL sterile DPBS to remove all the traces of mitogens present.\nResuspend the cells in TS complete media (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and plate at a density of 60,000 cells per T25 flask and maintain for 6 consecutive days.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1859-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Comparative experimental strategy for propagation of TSCs and in vitro differentiation of TSC to TGC\nScale: 30 μm.\nReplenish the media once in the first two days and daily from the third day till the fifth day. Harvest on the 6th day of differentiation, when the TSCs are fully differentiated to TGCs as per the experimental requirement mentioned in the next section (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nFunctional characterization of endoreduplicated trophoblast giant cells (TGCs)",
    "Timing: 8–10 days\nTGCs can be genotypically and phenotypically distinguished from TSCs using various indigenous methodologies as described.\nDetailed data example for functional characterization of endoreduplicated TGCs have been illustrated in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. TSCs have been used as the control sample in the experimental procedures detailed hereafter.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1859-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Mouse RPL7 has been used as endogenous control for normalization.\n(B) Left panel shows flow cytometry-based analysis of the ploidy state of trophoblast cells stained with Hoechst. Cells with DNA content >4n (TGCs) are represented on the right panel.\n(C) Hoechst and Phalloidin staining of TSCs and TGCs for quantification of the nuclear size. The nuclei have been stained using Hoechst (blue) and counterstaining of the cytosolic actin filaments has been done using DyLight™ 554 Phalloidin (red). Scale: 20 μm. Quantification of the nuclear size using ImageJ software has been shown below.\nMarker analysis by qPCR\nTrophoblast giant cells formed by differentiation of TSCs can be characterized by analysis of genetic markers specifying endoreduplicated TGCs like Prl2c2. TSC marker Cdx2 is used as control (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRNA isolation and cDNA preparation.\nFor isolating RNA from TSCs, aspirate the media and wash the cell monolayer with sterile DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA per T25 flask and incubate at 37°C in an incubator. Neutralize the action of trypsin with double the volume of TS complete media and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min and aspirate the trypsin containing media. Wash the cells with 2 mL sterile DPBS at 200 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and dissolve the pellet in 1 mL TRIzol. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nCritical: RNA isolation from TSCs must be carried out within 36 hours of seeding in stemness condition (doubling time of TSCs is 36 h) by gentle trypsinization and not cell scraping in order to avoid any chances of possible differentiated cell contamination which might happen if cells are scraped off. Although differentiation does not occur that fast, yet there remain chances of spontaneous cell differentiation. As a result, gentle trypsinization helps to obtain a pure stem cell population.\nFor isolating RNA from TGCs (differentiated till day 6), aspirate the media and wash the cell monolayer with sterile DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL TRIzol and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.

Staining of the nucleus using Hoechst can provide a potential method to characterize the endoreduplicated TGC state. Also, distinct filaments of F-actin support the cytoskeleton in TGCs in contrast to the weak F-actin filaments which are observed in TSCs.

Initialize the software to establish a relationship of the provided distance of the scale bar (in μm) with equivalent distance in pixels.\nStep 76 is mandatory if the nuclei appear very crowded and touching each other otherwise there are chances that two or more nuclei will be considered as a single nucleus. However, because only the size of the nuclei is measured, there is no requirement of background subtraction.\nGo to Process/Smooth for smoothing the image.\nSet the threshold of the image to an optimum value such that all the nuclei appear as an evenly highlighted region.",
    "Based on the threshold set, some areas might appear over-saturated and some areas under-saturated. Either remove or enhance the pixels from saturation, respectively.\nOutline the periphery/ boundary of individual nuclei by selecting the “overlay outlines”. Use the boundary markings and optimize the pixel size discrimination to such a value that all artifacts (which aren’t nuclei) are eliminated.\nAnalyze and calculate the area of the nuclei by Analyze/Analyze particles.\nThe results tab provides the area of each nuclei selected.\nExport this data to GraphPad Prism software to statistically analyze the changes in nuclear size (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).
