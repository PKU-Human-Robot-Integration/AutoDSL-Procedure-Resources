    "Note: This protocol was developed for infection with virulent Mtb; therefore, all work involving handling of Mtb should be performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory under a class II biosafety cabinet. However, the protocol has also been successfully applied by our group to class 1 (M. bovis BCG) or class 2 (Mtb H37Ra) organisms in a standard biosafety level 2 laboratory. Generation of Mtb-induced 3D granulomasResting of PBMCs prior to infectionThaw one or two vials of PBMCs yielding the adequate amount of cells anticipated for the design of the experiment (2.5 x 106 PBMCs/well) and transfer them into conical centrifugation tubes.Wash the cells by adding 10 ml (the first 3-5 ml dropwise) of pre-warmed (37 °C) thawing medium and mix gently. Centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g and discard the supernatant by pipetting.Repeat this washing step.Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) resting medium.Place the tube, with the lid loosened, into a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C and allow the cells to rest for at least 6 h up to overnight.Count the rested PBMCs and assess cell viability by trypan blue dye exclusion method.Note: Cell viability should be ≥ 95%. Lower cell viabilities can lead to Mtb-independent formation of cell aggregates. Transfer the required amount of PBMCs into a conical centrifuge tube. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant by pipetting.Resuspend the PBMCs at 107 cells/ml in complete medium. Place the cells, with the lid of the tube loosened, into a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C until use.Mtb infection of PBMCs and embedding (Figure 1A)Prepare the required volume of extracellular matrix (ECM) solution according to Recipe 4, except for the 1 N NaOH. Keep at 4 °C/on ice until use.",
    "Infect the PBMCs with the volume of Mtb single-cell suspension required to reach the aimed multiplicity of infection (MOI). Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 10-15 times in order to obtain a homogeneous suspension of PBMCs and Mtb.Note: Our experiments are routinely performed using a standard MOI of 1:200 (Mtb:PBMC). However, adjustments in the MOI may be required when using a new batch of single-cell suspension (or different mycobacterial strains or species). The optimal MOI can be experimentally assessed by monitoring the 3D granuloma formation in a dose-response setup (using various donors and uninfected PBMCs as a control). Distribute 250 μl per well of the Mtb-infected PBMCs in 24-well plates.Add the required amount of NaOH to the ECM solution (according to Recipe 4) and mix slowly and thoroughly by pipetting up and down 10-15 times.Note: A thorough homogenization of the ECM solution after addition of NaOH is critical to reach the correct pH and, consequently, a proper setting of the matrix. If the NaOH is homogeneously incorporated into the ECM solution, its mixture with PBMCs (Step A2e) should result in a pale, yellowish pink color. However, if the ECM components are not properly mixed, a color gradient from dark pink to light yellow may be observed across the wells due to pH variation. A too basic pH (dark pink) is detrimental for cell and bacterial viability and prevents the formation of granuloma-like structures. Add 250 μl of the ECM solution prepared in the previous step (1:1 ratio, v/v) to each well and mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times.Place the plate into a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C and allow the ECM to set for 45 min.Top up the set ECM with 500 μl per well of complete medium.",
    "Note: If the full plate is not going to be used, fill up the surrounding empty wells with sterile PBS or water to minimize evaporation. Place the plate back into the 5% CO2 incubator. Incubate at 37 °C for the desired time periods.Granuloma formation can be monitored using an inverted bright-field/phase-contrast microscope. Note: A marked donor-to-donor variability may be observed in terms of granuloma formation, in both number and size. This phenomenon has also been described in other in vitro granuloma models (Agrawal et al., 2016) .imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3820/bioprotoc-10-22-3820-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of the 3D in vitro granuloma model.  A. Mtb-infected PBMCs are embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM). Formation of granuloma-like structures can be observed after 7-8 days. B. PBMCs can be released from the ECM by collagenase digestion. C. Subsequent treatment with Triton X-100 allows the retrieval of Mtb.Release of PBMCs from the ECM (Figure 1B)At the selected time points, prepare the required volume of collagenase (1 mg/ml) according to Recipe 5.Remove the supernatant from the wells to be processed. Discard, or filter sterilize and store at -80 °C if analysis of soluble factors is envisaged.Add 250 μl per well of collagenase and incubate the plate in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 40-45 min. Every 15 min mix the liquid fraction by pipetting up and down to facilitate the digestion of the ECM.Once the ECM liquefied completely, transfer the content of the wells into microtubes.Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant by pipetting.Released cells can then be used to subsequently recover Mtb (according to Procedure C below), or to analyze host cell parameters, for example by flow cytometry (following standard staining procedures).",
    "Retrieval of Mtb (Figure 1C)Resuspend the cell pellet obtained in the previous section in 200 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 by vortexing for a few seconds or pipetting up and down a few times.Incubate for 20 min at room temperature to lyse the host cells.To retrieve the Mtb pellet, centrifuge for 5 min at 6,000 x g and discard the supernatant by pipetting.Various Mtb readouts can be obtained from the recovered bacilli as described in the Data analysis section."
