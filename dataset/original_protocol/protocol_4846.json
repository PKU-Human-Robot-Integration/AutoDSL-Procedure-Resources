    "The OIC protocol is performed during the light phase and consists of three phases: 1. The phase where the animals are habituated to the exploration box. 2. The training phase where they encounter the objects for the first time (two identical objects in a specific context and two other identical object in another context). 3. The testing phase where one of the identical objects in the context is replaced by the other object. The animals should be able to distinguish between the familiar object in the same context and the familiar object in the non-matching context. This would result in more exploratory behaviour towards the object that is replaced in the non-matching environment since this is the “new” scenario.Mice are tested on three subsequent days:Day 1. HabituationThe mouse is placed for 10 min in the context (with its face towards the wall) with no wall cues and without objects (Figure 2A). Day 2. TrainingOn day 2, the mouse is placed for 10 min in a box (context A) that has no cues on the walls but contained two identical objects, i.e., two blocks of Lego, placed in opposite corners (Figure 2B.1). Thereafter (approximately 1 min retention in the home cage), the mouse is placed for 10 min into another box (context B) with cues on the walls in the form of stripes and which contains two (new) identical objects, i.e., 2 small bottles, placed in opposite corners (Figure 2B.2). After training in context B, the mouse returns to its own home cage.Note: The duration (in sec) that mice spent to sniff the object (Figure 3).Day 3. TestingOn day 3, the mouse is placed for 10 min in context B containing one object which was present in context B on day 2 (i.e.",
    ", familiar object to context B), and one object which was present in context A on day 2 (i.e., unfamiliar object to context B, Figure 2C).We calculate the discrimination ratio (DR) on day 3 as a measure for object-in-context recognition memory. The DR is calculated as time spent with the novel object compared to the total exploration time of both objects on day 3 [tnovel/(tnovel + tfamiliar) (Figure 3); Dix and Aggleton, 1999; Kanasou et al., 2015a and 2015b].Note: It should be tested whether the DR is significantly higher against the chance level (50%) by using a one sample t-test. If not significant, then the animals are not considered to learn. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160829/20160829083055_3868.jpgFigure 2. Schematic representation indicating the setup of the object in-context recognition task (Kanatsou et al., 2015a; Kanatsou et al., 2015b). A. Mice are initially habituated in a context that had no object. B1. During training, mice are placed in the same context but with two identical objects and then placed in a novel context with two identical novel objects B2. C. Finally the mice are placed in the latter context but with one object being replaced by an object from the first context.AnalysisSniffing is scored as object-exploration behavior if the mouse displayed such behavior towards an object within a distance of 2 cm maximum from the object. Climbing on top of or “watching” the objects from a (close) distance is not considered as sniffing behavior. The exploration time mice are sniffing the objects, is recorded manually by two independent researchers. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160829/20160829083310_6390.jpgFigure 3. OIC memory in male mice. A. At day 2, mice showed no preference for the objects in context A, as they spent equal amounts of time (around 20 sec) exploring the two identical objects. B.",
    "At day 2, mice spent equal amounts of time (around 30 sec) exploring the two similar objects in context B. C. At day 3, mice spent more time sniffing the object O1 (new object; from context A) compared to the familiar object O2. D. At day 3, mice show higher preference (~60%) for the novel object in the new context [O1 from context A in the new context (context B)]. n = 4 animals, error bars represent standard error of the mean."
