    "All animal procedures must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or equivalent. If there is any uncertainty regarding the specific procedures described herein, do not proceed. Clarify with the institution's IACUC and a designated veterinary staff member.\n1. Ensuring Sterility of Cultured Cells and Follow Principles of Aseptic Techniques\nFollow the standard good laboratory practice in all cell culture procedures and IACUC requirements for cell testing and pathogen-free status confirmation prior to administering to mice9,10.\nFollow the NIH requirement for cell authentication to ensure reproducible outcome11.\nFollow established small animal surgery aseptic techniques outlined in this manuscript4.\n2. Preparation of Glioma Cells for In Vivo Experiment2,4\nCulture glioma cells (GBM43, GBM6, and U87MG) in serum-containing (10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium[DMEM]) or serum-free medium (Neurobasal medium with supplements B27, N2, heparin, epidermal growth factor [EGF], basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], antibiotics, and L-glutamine12), in a humidified CO2 cell culture incubator.\nTest all cell lines via the mouse clear panel run from commercial service providers.\nCollect adherent cells by removing culture medium. Incubate with 0.05% trypsin for 5 min at room temperature (1 mL of trypsin for T25 flask, 2 mL for T75 flask, scale accordingly for culture flasks with larger surface area) and then wash cells with Ca2+ and Mg2+ free phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nTap the flask to dislodge cells and immediately neutralize with an excess of serum-containing medium (8 - 9 mL). Then use serological pipettes to aspirate the cell suspension into centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 400 x g for 5 min. Wash the cell at least twice with 10 mL of PBS by repeated centrifugation.",
    "Collect glioma cells grown as tumor spheres in serum free medium via centrifugation (same speed and duration as above); dissociate the cell pellet by incubation in 1 - 2 mL of cell detachment solution at 37 °C for 5 min before washing twice with 10 mL of PBS by centrifugation (400 x g x 5 min).\nRe-suspend glioma in sterile saline at a concentration of 50,000 - 200,000 cells per 2.5 µL. Cell numbers used for injection into mouse brain depend on the established growth rate for each glioma cell line. Here, use 25,000 and 100,000 for GBM43 and GBM6 patient-derived tumor cells, respectively.\nPrepare double the amount of the necessary cell number for implantation to account for the loss of a fraction during procedure. Transfer the injectable cell suspension to a sterile microcentrifuge tube and place tube on ice. Keep cells on ice for 2 h maximum during surgeries, prepare new batch if extended surgeries are planned.\n3. Intracranial Implantation to Create Xenograft Mouse Models (Figure 1A)2,4,13\nPrior to the surgery day, sterilize all surgical tools in an autoclave, and prepare all pre- and post-surgical animal care material per IACUC approved protocol. Sterilize the stereotaxic frame and peripheral equipment to ensure intraoperative aseptic conditions, thus minimizing complications.\nOrganize the operation area to minimize clutter and possibility of contamination.\nDress in appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) per IACUC requirement.\nSet up appropriate post-operative recovery chamber. Ensure that anesthetics and analgesics are prepared fresh using unexpired reagents. Set up appropriate body heat maintenance instruments per IACUC approved protocol.\nTo establish human patient-derived glioma cell xenografts for the testing of intranasal delivery of human NSCs, use immunocompromised mouse species such as nu/nu athymic mouse of any gender at approximately 6 weeks of age.",
    "Anesthetize the animal based on body weight using the approved reagents, i.e. either via an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a mixture of ketamine (50-100 mg/kg; consult institutional IACUC for approved dose range) and xylazine (5-10 mg/kg; consult institutional IACUC for approved dose range) in 200-250 µL sterile saline, or via 4-5% isoflurane anesthesia using an inhalational device.\nEnsure the animal has reached the surgical anesthesia plane by toe pinching prior to the skin incision. Apply ample sterile ophthalmic gel to ensure the moist state of corneas of the animal.\nSterilize the skull using repeated and alternating circular wipes of betadine and isopropyl alcohol per Pritchett-Corning et al.14.\nSupply the pre-incision analgesia by s.c. injection of Buprenex (0.05 - 2 mg/kg) prior to incision using the surgical blade.\nUse sterilized cotton-tipped applicator to help hemostat while exposing the skull; use 3% hydrogen peroxide to facilitate the clearance of incidental bleeding.\nUse a battery-powered handheld electric ballpoint drill (less than 1 mm in width) to create a burr hole at 2 mm lateral, either left or right, to the midline, and 2 mm behind the Bregma (the position coordinates can be customized based on the tumor model intended for a particular study).\nMount the animal to the stereotaxic frame to the appropriate head posture, such that the inserted Hamilton micro syringe is perpendicular to the surface of the skull around the burr hole. Take care to ensure that the animal's anesthetic plane is in good standing by toe pinching. Observe the respiratory rate to make certain that the animal is not under pain stress during the following steps.\n\t* We do not emphasize in-ear bar placements because:\n\t\nWe have predrilled the burr hole to position the needle, and therefore, precise skull coordinates are unnecessary;",
    "Mouse ear canals are fragile, and the precise in-ear placement of ear bars requires more involved training that is not relevant to our purpose. The risks of damage to murine ear canals outweigh the benefits of a precise placement;\nCheek support is much easier to perform and capable of achieving the same levels of mouse head stability and balance during positioning. It is an added benefit for multiple time-sensitive surgeries to ensure timely completion with good cell viability.\nUse the stereotaxic frame knobs to position the flat tip micro syringe to the burr hole, then lower it slowly to 3 mm below the dura surface. Retract 0.5 mm to maintain the tip of the needle at 2.5 mm below the dura.\nInject 2.5 µL of preloaded glioma cells over the period of 1 min. Let the needle maintain its position for another 1-2 min before slowly, over the course of 1 min, withdrawing the needle out of the brain and taking care to minimize cell backflow. Apply sterile bone wax to avoid extracranial tumor outgrowth.\nClose the wound using stainless steel wound clips (7 mm). Deliver a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 1 mL of sterile lactated Ringer's solution (pre-warmed to 37 °C), and place the animal in a recovery chamber which is halfway on a heating pad.\nReturn the animals to the ventilated rack once they regain mobility, and follow routine post-op care to ensure smooth recovery.\n4. In Vivo Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI) of Tumor Growth (Figure 1B)15\nNOTE: The patient-derived glioma cells are modified to express firefly luciferase. This allows us to follow tumor progression after intracranial implantation.\nGive animals an i.p. injection of the D-luciferin, potassium salt (150 mg/kg) 10 min prior to the imaging session.",
    "Immediately place animals in an oxygenated isoflurane induction chamber approved by the IACUC.\nPlace animals inside the heated (37 °C) imaging chamber to capture the BLI signal using software settings (for details, see manufacturer instruction).\n5. Whole Brain Irradiation (Figure 1C)2,4,13\nNOTE: To enhance the migration of intranasally delivered hNSCs to brain tumors, whole brain irradiation of mice bearing intracranial tumor xenografts can be utilized 4.\nUse an i.p. injection of a ketamine and xylazine mixture (50-100 mg/kg and 5-10 mg/kg respectively; consult institutional IACUC for approved dose range) with sub-surgical anesthesia plane to moderately induce anesthesia for mice.\nUtilize a sample tray to position the mice inside the chamber between lead shielding blocks, allowing for head-only exposure to the radiation path (Figure 2).\nGive mice with positive BLI confirmation of tumor growth (normally at day 7-8 after glioma cells implantation) a daily dose of 2 Gy of irradiation for 5 consecutive days. Perform BLI assessment of tumor after the last irradiation dose.\n6. Genetic Modification of Human Neural Stem Cells (NSCs; Figure 3A)4\nMaintain human NSCs (clone HB1.F3.CD)6,7 in DMEM medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator under 95% room air and 5% CO2 (NNSCs).\nPerform genetic overexpression of chemotaxic receptors, such as the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), in hNSCs by transduction with lentivirus encoding for human CXCR4.\nWhen NSCs are near 75-80% confluency, add the CXCR4 lentivirus to the culture medium along with polybrene (8 µg/mL), and incubate for 8 h or overnight.\nReplace virus-containing medium with fresh medium containing blasticidin at 4 µg/mL for positive selection of transduced cells.",
    "Validate the level of CXCR4 expression in modified hNSCs (CXCR4NSCs) via flow cytometry using anti-CXCR4 antibody and matching isotype antibody and via quantitative RT-PCR using a pair of primers amplifying CXCR4 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs4.\nGenerate vector control NSCs (VCNSCs) using the same strategy, with RFP replacing the CXCR4 gene, and verify via microscopy or flow cytometry due to the presence of RFP fluorescence.\n7. Hypoxic Preconditioning of Human NSCs (Figure 3A)4\nPlate cultured NSCs in T75 culture flasks as described above until 90% confluency is reached.\nPlace cell culture flasks inside a humidified CO2 chamber/incubator with maintained 1% O2 levels for 24 h, via N2 gas supply controlled by an automated built-in flow meter. These cells are referred to as HNSCs. Control NNSCs are described in step 7.1.\n8. Loading of Human NSCs with Oncolytic Virus (Figure 3B-3H)5\n8.1.Infect NNSCs, HNSCs, VCNSCs, and CXCR4NSCs with 50 conditional replicative adenovirus (CRAd)-S-pk7 viral particles/cell4,16.\n8.2.After 2 h of incubation at room temperature with periodic tapping, wash cells three times with media to remove unbound viral particles and suspend cells in sterile saline for injection.\n\tCAUTION: Carry out all virus-related in vitro cell culture procedures in facilities with the appropriate biosafety level designation, such as BSL2. Appropriate personal protective equipment must be worn by researchers handling the oncolytic virus per institutional animal facility guidelines4,16.\n9. Loading Stem Cells with Micron-size Paramagnetic Iron Oxides (MPIOs) for In Vivo Tracking via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI; Figure 3B-3H)2\nTo label stem cells, add MPIOs to stem cell cultures at ~80% confluency, in the presence of transfection reagent for overnight incubation. The efficiency of stem cell labeling (NSCs4 or MSCs2) with MPIOs (flash red conjugated) is determined by flow cytometry.",
    "To visualize stem cell migration and distribution in the brains of glioma-bearing animals, acquire both multi-slice high resolution T2 weighted Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement spin echo images and multi-slice T1 weighted Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) gradient echo sequences to evaluate the structure via both coronal and axial planes of the mouse brain2.\n10. Intranasal Delivery of Therapeutic NSCs (Figures 1D and Figure 3D)2,4\nCulture and collect NSCs (NNSCs, HNSCs, VCNSCs, and CXCR4NSCs) according the protocol described in section 3.\n\tCAUTION: All animal procedures involving OV-loaded NSCs must be carried out in facilities with the appropriate biosafety level designation, such as BL2 or BSL2 facilities.\nAnesthetize mice via i.p. injection of a ketamine and xylazine mixture according to step 3.6.\nPlace mice on a clean drape facing up with a heating pad underneath to maintain body temperature. Adjust a padded pillow made of rolled up paper towels with tapes to ensure the upright angle of the nostrils when placed under the head of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: Hyaluronidase pre-treatment (total of 100 U as four repeated inoculations at 5-min intervals, 3 µL in each nostril) of the nasal epithelium was described previously2,17.\nUsing a micropipette, dispense 2 µL of NSC suspension to each nostril of the mouse. Visually confirm the aspiration of the droplet before moving to the next mouse. The total number of cells delivered can be determined by the user; use 62,500-125,000 cells/µL, such that 0.5-1 million cells can be delivered in 4 x 2 µL doses.\nUse a timer to ensure 5 min intervals between each cell suspension administration, up to 4 times.\nAllow animals to regain mobility in a recovery chamber, with the supine position maintained throughout.\n11. Survival Analysis (Figure 3E)",
    "Enter the survival duration data of animals in statistical software, and perform statistical comparisons using the log-rank test with the following significance designations: *p <0.05, **p <0.01, ***p <0.001.\n12. Tissue Collection and Histology/Immunocytochemistry Verification of Intranasal Stem Cell Brain Entry2,4\nAt the end point of the study, euthanize mice via the IACUC-approved protocols. A standard practice is using a flow rate-controlled CO2 chamber to sacrifice the animals as the primary euthanasia strategy followed by exsanguination by perfusion fixation.\nImmediately after being sacrificed, perform an intracardiac perfusion with PBS on the animal to ensure the elimination of blood residues from blood vessels and the preservation of tissues for subsequent histological analysis.\nPlace the CO2-euthanized animal on top of an absorbent pad in the supine position, proceed with a laparotomy to expose the diaphragm muscle, which is dissected along with the rib cage, to expose the heart.\nAfter making a nick on the right atrium using a pair of dissection scissors, accelerate the exsanguination with a 3-5 mL of PBS injection via the left ventricle at the apex. Inject ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) into circulation using a syringe; peripheral muscle spasms provide visual confirmation that there is no major blockage in the circulation that would prevent proper tissue fixation.\nSurgically remove the head of the carcass and preserve in a 50 mL centrifuge tube in 4% PFA at 4 °C overnight. Change the solution to 30% sucrose the following day prior to brain tissue dissection another 24 h later.\nEmbed the brain tissue in OCT compound and flash freeze on isopentane on dry ice. Perform cryosectioning of the resultant tissue block to generate 10-20 µm tissue sections for histology and immunocytochemistry applications.\nSubscription Required.
