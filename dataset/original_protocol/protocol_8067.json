    "This study was carried out in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care Guidelines of Nantong University. All the procedures including the animal subjects were ethically approved by the Administration Committee of Experimental Animals, Jiangsu Province, China.\n1. Isolation and culture of motor and sensory nerve fibroblasts and SCs\nUse seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n=4) provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Nantong University of China. Place the rats in a tank containing 5% isoflurane for 2-3 minutes, allow the animals to breath slowly and have no independent activity, and then sanitize using 75% ethanol prior to decapitation.\nUse scissors to cut the back skin for about 3 cm and remove the spinal column. Open the vertebral canal carefully to expose the spinal cord.\nMaintain the spinal cord in a 60 mm Petri dish with 2-3 mL of ice-cold D-Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS).\nBased on the anatomical structure, excise the ventral root (motor nerve) and then the dorsal root (sensory nerve) under a dissecting microscope. Next, place them in an ice-cold D-Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS).\nAfter removing the HBSS, slice the nerves into 3-5 mm pieces with scissors and digest with 1 mL of 0.25% (w/v) trypsin at 37 °C for 18-20 min. Next, supplement with 3-4 mL of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to stop the digestion.\nPipette the mixture up and down gently about 10 times and centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min. After that, discard the supernatant and suspend the precipitate in 2-3 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.",
    "Filter the cell suspension using a 400 mesh filter, and then inoculate the cells in 60 mm Petri dish and culture at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. After 4-5 days of culturing, isolate the passage 0 (p0) fibroblasts and SCs after reaching 90% confluence.\nIsolation and culture of SCs (Figure 1)\n\t\nWash the cells once using 1x PBS. Add 1 mL of 0.25% (w/v) trypsin (37 °C) per 60 mm Petri dish to digest the cells for 8-10 s at room temperature. After that, add 3 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to stop the digestion.\nGently blow the mixture to detach the SCs with a pipette. Then collect and centrifuge the SCs at 800 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and suspend the precipitate in 3 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 µM forskolin and 10 ng/mL HRG, and then inoculate the cells in uncoated 60 mm Petri dish. After culturing at 37 °C for 30-45 min, the fibroblasts (a few number of fibroblasts are digested with SCs) attach to the bottom of the dish.\nTransfer the supernatant (including the SCs) to another poly-L-lysine (PLL)-coated medium dish and culture at 37 °C for 2 days.\nIsolation and culture of fibroblasts (Figure 1)\n\t\nAfter removing the SCs (as shown in step 1.8), wash the remaining fibroblasts in the dishes with 1x PBS and then add 1 mL of 0.25% (w/v) trypsin to digest the fibroblasts for 2 min at 37 °C.\nAdd DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to end the digestion. Blow the fibroblasts using a pipette, and then collect and centrifuge them at 800 x g for 5 min.",
    "Discard the supernatant, suspend the precipitate with 2 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS, and then inoculate the cells in uncoated 60 mm Petri dish. The fibroblasts after culturing for 30-45 min at 37 °C attach to the bottom of the dish. Discard the supernatant (including a few numbers of SCs). Then add 3 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS into the fibroblasts dish and culture at 37 °C for 2 days.\nPassage the p1 cells until they reached 90% confluence. Then purify them by differential digestion and differential adherence again as described in sections 1.8 and 1.9.\nDigest the p2 fibroblasts and SCs after culturing for 2 days, and then collect the cells, count and inoculate in 1 x 105 numbers/well on PLL-coated slides for immunocytochemistry (ICC).\n2. ICC for identification of cell purity\nCulture the cells for 24 h at 37 °C and perform ICC staining after differential digestion and differential adherence of motor and sensory fibroblasts and SCs.\nWash the motor and sensory fibroblasts and SCs with 1x PBS and fix them in 200 µL/well of 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 18 min at room temperature.\nBlock the sample SCs with blocking buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.01 M PBS containing 5% goat serum) and block the sample fibroblasts with blocking buffer (0.01 M PBS containing 5% goat serum) for 45 min at 37 °C after washing them with PBS thrice.\nRemove the blocking buffer, and incubate with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-CD90 antibody (a specific marker for fibroblasts) (1:1000) for fibroblasts and mouse anti-S100 antibody (a specific marker for SCs) (1:400) for SCs at 4 °C overnight.",
    "Discard the primary antibodies, wash with PBS thrice, and incubate with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400) for fibroblasts and 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400) for SCs at room temperature for 1.5 h.\nWash the samples thrice with PBS, and stain the nuclei with 5 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 dye for 10 min at room temperature. Wash the sample with 1x PBS thrice and mount them using the mounting medium (20 µL/slide) on the glass slide.\nTake the cell photographs by confocal laser scanning microscope in three random fields for each well. Evaluate the total number of nuclei and CD90-positive cells, S100-positive cells and then calculate the percentage of CD90-positive cells and S100-positive cells, respectively. Perform the staining in triplicate.\n3. Flow cytometry analysis (FCA) for identification of cell purity\nEvaluate the purity of motor and sensory fibroblasts and SCs as described previously by FCA16. Briefly, digest the p2 motor and sensory fibroblasts and SCs with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin, resuspend the cell pellets and incubate them in fixation medium at room temperature for 15 min.\nIncubate the cells with permeabilization medium and probe using mouse monoclonal anti-CD90 antibody (0.1 µg/106 cells, 200 µL) for fibroblasts and mouse anti-S100 antibody (1:400, 200 µL) for SCs at room temperature for 30 min, respectively.\nIncubate the cells with 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. Use FACS caliber to perform flow cytometry, and analyze the data using Cell Quest software.\nIncubate the cells only with 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (fibroblasts Group) and mouse IgG1 kappa [MOPC-21] (FITC) - Isotype control (SCs group), which serves as negative control.\n4.
