    "Experimental setupExperimental space should be quiet and dimly lit (75 to 100 lux) to avoid distraction from sounds and increased anxiety level from bright lights. The experimental area is surrounded by a back curtain with the experimenter outside of the curtain to avoid distraction from movements. A digital recording camera is mounted overhead and connected to a computer for recording the experiment.The olfactory recognition experiment has two phases, a training phase and a recall phase. Long-term memory can be tested by delaying the recall phase for 24 h. Short-term memory can be tested by employing a short delay time between the two phases, such as one hour. Create the scent cup by drilling four or five small holes in the lid of the container. Place a piece of the filter paper inside the container and seal the container using low odor glue or epoxy, or tape.Olfactory recognitionTraining phasePlace the subject mouse into a clean cage, identical to the home cage, with the scent cup for 30 min prior to testing to allow the animal to habituate to the cage and the scent cup. Briefly remove the scent cup, place 0.10 ml of fruit juice on the filter paper inside the scent cup with a syringe or pipet and place the scent cup back into the cage. For guidance on placement within the cage see Figure 2.Allow the mouse to freely explore the scent, after 5 min, place the mouse back into its home cage.Recall phaseFor the recall phase, split the subject mice into two groups. One group will be paired with a novel fruit juice (this is the control group), the novel juice should be explored to a similar extent as the juice in the training phase.",
    "This control group demonstrates that the decrease in exploration is not due to fatiguing effects. The second group will be paired with the same fruit juice as in the training phase (this is the experimental group). Place the subject mouse into a clean mouse cage, containing a scent cup for 30 min prior to testing. Briefly remove the scent cup, place 0.10 ml of the appropriate fruit juice into the scent cup and return the scent cup back into the cage with the subject mouse for 5 min. For guidance on placement within the cage see Figure 2. After 5 min, the subject mouse is placed back into the home cage.Data analysisUsing a stopwatch, have a blind experimenter record the amount of time that the mouse spends investigating the scent. Investigation of the scent is defined as the mouse being within one centimeter of the scent cup with its head directed toward the scent cup (Figure 2, Video 1). Alternatively, there are several video tracking software systems that can be used (i.e., BIOBSERVE software), however if bedding is used in the testing cage, as in this protocol, the scent cup may move. If automated tracking software is used, it would be best to secure the scent cup to the cage floor.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160503/20160503022748_3022.jpgFigure 2.

Group the animals according to the genotype, sex, or treatment group.Average the exploration times and determine the standard error.Plot the data using the standard error measurements as the error bars.",
    "Differences between the training session and the recall session can be determined using a Studentâ€™s t-test. The animal is said to have formed a memory of the scent if there is a significant decrease in the amount of time spent investigating the familiar scent from the training session to the recall session. Differences among groups can be determined by an ANOVA."
