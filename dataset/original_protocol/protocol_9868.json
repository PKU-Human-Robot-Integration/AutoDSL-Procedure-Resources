    "Whole blood donations were collected from healthy donors following protocols approved by the institutional review board at the University of Louisville.\n1. Fabrication of acoustofluidic device\nObtain a photomask with a concentric spiral design containing channels with a diameter of 500 µm. A CAD file is provided in the supplemental files as an example. A custom photomask can be ordered from a commercial vendor or patterned using a mask writer.\nPrepare a mold of the concentric spiral design on a photoresist-coated silicon wafer using standard photolithography techniques.\n\t\nAdd approximately 2 Tbsp (~30 mL) of SU-8 2100 to a 100 mm silicon wafer.\nSpin-coat the wafer on a spinner at a speed of 150 rpm for 30 s to spread out the photoresist, then increase the speed to 1,200 rpm for 60 s to yield a thickness of 200 µm.\nCure the photoresist-coated wafer in a polyimide vacuum oven with a 30 min ramp up and 30 min dwell at 115 °C, then ramp down for 30 min.\nExpose the photoresist-coated wafer for 130 s using a mask aligner with the photomask from step 1.1.\nBake the wafer after exposure following the same process described in step 1.2.3.\nDevelop the photoresist in SU-8 developer solution for approximately 8 min.\n\t\tCAUTION: Only use developer solution in a well-ventilated chemical fume hood.\nSilanize the mold to make the surface more hydrophobic. Place the photoresist-coated wafer into a desiccator and add a 20 µL drop of chlorosilane (C8H4Cl3F13Si). Apply vacuum to the chamber for 30 s, then seal the chamber and leave overnight.\n\tCAUTION: Chlorosilane is very hazardous and flammable. Exposure causes severe burns and eye damage.",
    "Combine 54 g of polydimethsiloxane (PDMS) base and 6 g of curing agent in a cup and mix vigorously and thoroughly with a spatula for at least 1 min.\nPlace the cup containing the PDMS solution into a desiccator for approximately 30 min or until remnant air bubbles are removed from the solution.\nPlace photoresist-coated wafer with the patterns facing upward in a 150-mm Petri dish.\nPour the PDMS solution over the mold inside the 150-mm Petri dish.\nIf needed, place the 150-mm Petri dish inside a desiccator and apply vacuum until remnant air bubbles disappear.\nTransfer the 150-mm Petri dish into a lab oven and bake for 2 h at 60 °C to cure the PDMS.\nAfter curing, carefully remove the PDMS from the Petri dish by cutting around the edges of the wafer using a razor blade.\nCut out each individual device using a knife or razor blade.\nPunch holes through the inlet and outlet ports of each device using a 2.5-mm biopsy punch.\nPlace each PDMS device in a plasma asher with channels exposed (facing upward). Apply oxygen plasma treatment (100 W for 45 s, 500 mbar O2) then immediately place each PDMS device onto a clean soda lime glass microscope slide (75 mm x 25 mm x 1 mm) with channels facing the glass surface.\nLet devices bond overnight at room temperature.\nGently apply silicone to the surface of the 1-cm diameter piezo transducer at a thickness of ~1-2mm, then carefully align the transducer with the concentric spiral and gently press it onto the bottom of the glass microscope slide (opposite side from the PDMS device).\n2. Assembly and operation of acoustofluidic system\nConnect a microcontroller to a computer using a USB A to B cable. A green power LED indicator (labeled PWR) should illuminate.",
    "Use the associated program on the computer to upload a program which generates an 8 MHz signal. An example program is provided in the Supplemental Files. After uploading the program, it will be stored into microprocessor memory and will not need to be uploaded again.\nSolder a 1\" 22G wire to the end of each wire on the PZT transducer.\nConnect the negative (black) terminal wire of PZT transducer to a GND pin via the soldered wire.\nConnect the positive (red) terminal wire of PZT transducer to the output pin (#9 in the provided example program) via the soldered wire.\nOptionally, mount the acoustofluidic device and the microcontroller in a 3D-printed case. CAD files are provided in the Supplemental Files as examples. Additional wires can be connected to other microcontroller pins to control an external LED indicator and on/off push button if desired.\nCut 3-6\" sections of tygon PVC soft plastic tubing (1/16\" ID, 1/8\" OD) and push the tubing into the inlet and outlet ports. It may be necessary to rotate the tubing while applying pressure until it fits in the opening. Optionally, after inserting the tubing into each port, glue can be applied at the junction to bond the PDMS and tubing together.\nAssemble the microfluidic reservoir according to manufacturer's instructions.\nCut a 3-6\" section of tygon PVC soft plastic tubing (1/16\" ID, 1/8\" OD) and push the tubing over the 1/32\" ID tubing from the microfluidic reservoir output tubing. Optionally, wrap the junction with paraffin film to prevent leakage.\nFill a 60-mL syringe with ambient air (optionally, filter the air with a 0.2-µm filter) and connect it to tygon PVC tubing (1/16\" ID, 1/8\" OD) on the side of the microfluidic reservoir.",
    "Set the syringe pump to a rate of 200 mL/h to push the cell/ultrasound contrast agent solutions through the acoustofluidic device at a volumetric flow rate of 50 mL/h and collect the samples from the output of the acoustofluidic device into a 50mL centrifuge tube. Optionally, rinse channel prior to acoustofluidic treatment with 15 mL of 70% ethanol solution to increase sterility of fluidic channels. Additionally, channels can be rinsed with 15 mL of deionized water to remove residual ethanol in the device prior to pumping cells through the system.\n3. Preparation of ultrasound contrast agents\nNOTE: Ultrasound contrast agents significantly enhance acoustofluidic delivery of molecular compounds by transiently increasing permeabilization of nearby cellular membranes19. Molecular delivery is very limited without ultrasound contrast agents in this system.\nPrepare a phospholipid solution in a 20mL scintillation vial containing the following mixture:\n\t\nAdd 25 mg of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC).\nAdd 11.6 mg of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (DSEPC).\nAdd 0.26 mg of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG).\nAdd 0.88 mg of polyoxyethylene40 stearate.\nAdd chloroform until all phospholipids are dissolved (e.g., 3 mL of chloroform).\nEvaporate chloroform in a desiccator for 48 h to form a dry lipid film (evaporation under argon or with a rotary evaporator can be used to accelerate the drying process).\nRehydrate the lipid film with 10 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nSonicate the lipid solution for 3 min at 40% amplitude to form a cationic micellar solution.\nAfter sonication store the phospholipid solution at 2-6 °C for up to 1 month.\nTo prepare ultrasound contrast agents, add 200 µL of cationic micellar solution and 600 µL of sterile PBS to a 2 mL glass septum vial.\nSeal the vial by crimping the cap.\nUse a 1.5\" 20G needle to fill the vial head space with decafluorobutane gas for 30 s.",
    "Amalgamate the vial for 45 s at 4,350 cpm to form perfluorobutane gas-filled ultrasound contrast agents.\nAdd 25 µL of ultrasound contrast agent solution per 1 mL of cell solution immediately before pumping the combined contrast agent/cell mixture through the acoustofluidic device. The cell solution can be modified as desired by the user, but in our studies the cell solution consisted of primary T cells in step 4.21, and A549 lung cancer cells in step 5.7, respectively.\n4. Preparation of primary Tcells\nIsolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood solutions and store at -150 °C. Density gradient separation containing a substrate is commonly utilized to separate PBMCs from whole blood24,25,26.\nThaw frozen vial in 37 °C water bath.\nDilute thawed PBMCs 1:10 with PBS in a 15mL centrifuge tube. Each 1mL vial contains approximately 10 million PBMCs.\nCentrifuge diluted PBMCs at 580 x g for 11 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 13 mL of MACs running buffer to resuspend the cells.\nCount the PBMCs with an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the PBMCs again at 580 x g for 11 min at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 40 µL of chilled running buffer per 10 million PBMCs.\nTo isolate T cells, add 10 µL of Pan T-Cell Biotin Antibody Cocktail per 10 million PBMCs.\nGently agitate the PBMCs and store the solution at 4 °C for 5 min per 10 million cells.\nAdd 30 µL of running buffer and 20 µL of Pan T-Cell MicroBead Cocktail per 10 million PBMCs.\nMix the PBMCs and beads thoroughly and incubate for an additional 15 min at 4 °C.\nAdd running buffer to reach a total volume of 500 µL.",
    "Separate primary T cells with a commercially available benchtop magnetic sorting instrument using the \"depletes separation\" setting following manufacturer's protocol. This step should yield between 5-10 million T cells after cell sorting.\nCount T cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.\nDilute T cells in 10 mL of sterile PBS and centrifuge at 580 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend T cells in 1 mL of PBS.\nCount T cells using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer and aliquot 1 million/mL for experiments.\nPrepare a 1 mg/mL fluorescein solution in PBS.\nAdd 100 µL of 1 mg/mL fluorescein solution per 1 mL of T cell solution (final fluorescein concentration = 100 µg/mL) immediately prior to processing.\nAdd 25 µL of ultrasound contrast agent solution as previously described in step 3.11.\nProcess 1mL aliquots of cells using the acoustofluidic system (see steps 2.10-2.11). This step enhances delivery of fluorescein into primary T cells.\nImmediately after treatment, wash cells three times via centrifugation at 580 x g for 10 min with 500 µL of PBS to remove extracellular fluorescein. Cells should be washed within 10 min after adding fluorescein solution.\nAfter final washing step, resuspend cells in 250 µL of PBS and measure fluorescence on flow cytometer.\n5. Preparation of A549 lung cancer cells\nCulture A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial) cells in complete DMEM media (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a flat-bottom tissue culture flask.\nHarvest A549 cells when they reach 70-90% confluency. Aspirate media from the flask and wash the cells once with PBS to remove serum proteins.",
    "Add trypsin (0.25%) EDTA to the flask and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. Trypsin is a digestive enzyme which causes the cells to detach from the bottom surface of the tissue culture flask.\nTransfer trypsin solution to a 15mL centrifuge tube and neutralize it by adding complete DMEM media at a 1:3 ratio.\nPellet the cells via centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet at a concentration of 100,000/mL in PBS solution containing 200 mM trehalose in 15-mL conical vial.\nAdd 25 µL of ultrasound contrast agent solution as previously described in step 3.11.\nProcess 1mL aliquots of cells using the acoustofluidic system (see steps 2.10-2.11). This step enhances delivery of trehalose into A549 lung cancer cells.\nImmediately after treatment, wash cells three times via centrifugation with 500 µL of PBS to remove extracellular trehalose. Cells should be washed within 10 min after adding trehalose solution.\nAfter final washing step, resuspend cells in 100 µL of PBS.\nAdd 11 µL of 1% Triton X-100 solution to lyse cells and release intracellular trehalose.\nVortex for 15 s, then incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nVortex again for 15 s, then measure trehalose concentration using commercially available trehalose assay following manufacturer's recommendation.\nSubscription Required.
