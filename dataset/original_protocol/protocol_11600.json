    "Ethics statement: Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Comité d'Ethique en Expérimentation animale (CETEA) n°89 at the Institut Pasteur, Paris.\n1. Animal Preparation\nTo record pup isolation calls, obtain pregnant females from the mouse strain of interest. Note: Breed heterozygous males and females to obtain at least 10 litters including wild-type, heterozygous and knock-out pups to obtain robust control animals.\nObtain two categories of adult mice to record vocalizations during same-sex interactions.\n\t\nObtain at least 12 males or 12 females of each genotype as test mice from the strain of interest (to take into account inter-individual variability). Note: This protocol is well-adapted for adults, but it can be adjusted to juveniles, with reduced isolation time before the experiment9. This test works for males or females. However, avoid testing males from mouse strains that display a clear aggressive phenotype in the male-male social interaction test.\nTo maximize the amount of affiliative interactions, isolate the test animals before the experiments. House males individually for 3 weeks (to reduce aggressive interactions to a minimum14,17) and females for 3 days (E. Ey, unpublished data) to increase their social motivation.\nObtain males or females from strains representative of the genetic background of the test strain to use them as new-comers (e.g., as interacting mice, see 3.1.3). For instance, if the mutant strain being studied has been generated on the C57BL/6J background, use C57BL/6J mice as new-comers. Calculate the number of animals needed so that each of these mice is not used more than 2 times a day as new-comer. House them in groups.\nObtain two categories of adult mice to record male vocalizations in presence of an estrus female.",
    "Obtain at least 12 sexually mature males from each genotype of the strain of interest (to take into account inter-individual variability). Note: If the males have never had experience with females before, put them in individual cages and leave them spend one night with a female two days before the test to increase their motivation to emit ultrasonic vocalizations6.\nObtain sexually mature females from the background strain of the recorded males. For instance, if the mutant males being studied have been generated on the C57BL/6J background, use C57BL/6J females. Calculate the number of females needed so that each of these mice is not used more than 3 times a day. House them in groups.\n2. Pup Isolation Calls\nPup Identification\n\t\nThree days before the predicted day of birth, isolate the pregnant females.\nCheck the females for birth every morning and every evening. Note the day of birth as P0.\nIdentify the pups at P1 using long-lasting paw tattoos (subcutaneous injection of green tattoo paste with a 0.3 mm x 13 mm [30 G ½\"] needle). Create a code with one, two, three or four paws marked. Be as quick as possible, to minimally disturb the pups, and put them back in the nest as soon as possible.\nSet up the Cage to Record Pup Isolation Calls.\n\t\nUse either a self-made soundproof chamber (Figure 1A) or a simple Styrofoam box. Place a thermometer within the box to monitor the temperature for each recording. Make sure that the temperature remains between 18 °C and 22 °C.",
    "Place a microphone at the top (through a hole in the top of the box). Adjust the height of the microphone so that the membrane of the microphone is 12-15 cm above the bottom of the box where the pup will lie down. Connect the microphone to the sound card, and the sound card to the computer.\nTo adjust the gain of the sound card, conduct a recording trial with a pup that will not be used in the experiment. Put the pup in the same conditions as in the experiment (see 2.3.1). Close the door. Adjust the gain on the sound card, so that it is on the maximum value (to have the highest amplitude possible for the vocalizations) but without overloading (check on the live spectrogram display on the recording software).\n\t\tNote: A few calls might be overloaded if the amplitude of the majority of the calls is kept at the highest level possible.\nRegister the gain level for each recording session and do not change it between pups/litters/sessions. Variations in gain levels would lead to inaccurate call detection and acoustic variables measures with the same thresholds in the analyses using automatic detection and measurements (see 5.1 to 5.4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53871/53871fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Set up for recording isolation calls from mouse pups and spectrograms of ultrasonic vocalizations.

    "Conduct the recording of pup isolation calls every two days. Conduct recordings in the morning for pups born in the night, and in the afternoon for pups born during the day to avoid categorizing in the same age class pups with half a day of age difference. This is most noticeable for the very young stages P2 and P4.\n\t\nTake one pup in the litter. Place it as quickly and gently as possible in a plastic recipient washed with ethanol 10% and dried (diameter: 9 cm; height: 10 cm to prevent older pups from escaping from the area covered by the microphone). Put the recipient just under the microphone.\nClose the box as quickly and silently as possible. Start the recording of pup ultrasonic vocalizations in the recording software (16-bit format, 300 kHz sampling frequency to capture sound amplitude up to 150 kHz with a high quality).\nAfter the required time of recording has elapsed (up to 5 min), stop the recording. Take the pup out of the box. Write down the paw tattoos of the pup.\nTake the axillary temperature of the pup with a probe-thermometer. Mark the pup on its back with a tiny point with a smell-less pen (water ink), to recognize more easily the already recorded pups in the nest when the next one is chosen and to avoid manipulating all pups each time a new one is chosen. Put the pup back in the nest.\nWash the plastic recipient and the plastic covering its bottom with 10% ethanol and dry it well before putting the next pup inside.\nChoose the next pup in the litter and repeat 2.3.",
    "Check body weight, motor coordination, negative geotaxis, and developmental marks (for details of the reduced test battery please see the method sections in Schmeisser et al.18 and in Ey et al.19) after a period of rest of 1 hr to allow the pups to recover after the exhausting emission of ultrasonic vocalizations. Use another cohort of animals if the complete developmental test battery such as in Chadman et al.20 and Scattoni et al.21 is conducted.\nRepeat these recordings every two days between P2 and P12 to characterize pup vocal behavior and development throughout their first two weeks of life.\n3. Ultrasonic Vocalizations during Same-sex Social Interactions\nVocalization Recordings\n\t\nPrepare a test cage (50 x 25 cm x 30 cm3; Plexiglas, 100 lux [low intensity white light]) cleaned with soap water, dried and filled with 2 cm fresh bedding in the soundproof chamber.\n\t\t\nPlace the microphone so that vocalizations emitted from all corners of the cage can be recorded. Fix the microphone in a corner of the test cage (either on the cage or on a tripod) and adjust the angle microphone-cage bottom to cover the cage's entire surface.\n\t\t\tNote: Ultrasounds are very directional.\nPlace a video camera on the top of the soundproof chamber to capture the whole surface of the test cage.\n\t\t\tNote: Check that the microphone is not hiding a corner of the test cage on the video.\nBefore testing, adjust the gain of the soundcard with a spare male and a spare female that will not be used in the experiment later. Put these animals in the test cage in the recording chamber. Adjust the gain level on the sound card to maximize the amplitude of the recorded vocalizations but to minimize overloading as seen in the live spectrogram display on the recording software.",
    "Note: The gain depends on the distance between the microphone and the vocalizing animals.\nIntroduce the animal to be tested (male or female; it will be called the \"occupant\") in the test cage on fresh bedding. Leave it habituate to the test cage in the soundproof chamber for 20 min to maximize its interest for the unknown conspecific introduced in 3.1.3.\nAfter this habituation time, introduce the 2nd animal for the interaction (male or female, same sex as the occupant, but different ear marks / paw tattoo to identify them later; it will be called the \"new-comer\").\n\t\t\nStart recording the ultrasonic vocalizations (16-bit format, 300 kHz sampling frequency to capture sound amplitude up to 150 kHz with a high quality) and the video to capture the introduction of the new-comer in the test cage. Start recording the ultrasonic vocalizations during habituation (occupant alone) if a comparison between the baseline level of vocalization emission during cage exploration and the social interaction is needed.\nSynchronize manually/visually the audio and video recordings by pressing on the time watch (\"bip\" sound near the microphone) exactly when the hind paws of the new-comer mouse touch the ground.\nLeave the two animals interact for the desired time (for instance 4 min, a duration sufficient to collect enough ultrasonic vocalizations).\nPut the occupant and the new-comer back in their respective home cages. Empty the used bedding from the test cage, wash it with soap water and dry it with paper towels. Put fresh bedding and place it back in the soundproof chamber for the next test.\n4. Male Vocalizations During Interaction with an Estrus Female\nEarly in the morning the day of testing the males, take vaginal smears from each female to determine their sexual status within the estrus cycle.",
    "Hold the female by the tail and maintain her on the cage grid. Use a pipette to rinse the vagina several times with 20 µl PBS (i.e., inject and recollect the same 20 µl PBS several times). Recollect the 20 µl PBS with the same pipette tip. Use sterile PBS, to avoid any infection if females are to be tested for several consecutive days.\nSpread the PBS containing the suspension of vaginal cells on a slide. Put four samples on one slide (identify the individuals at the side of the slide with a pencil). Let the slides dry before conducting the staining.\nWork under the laboratory fume hood.\n\t\t\nPrepare one bath of pure May-Grünwald, one bath of phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M) and one bath of Giemsa R (1/20 in phosphate buffer solution).\nPut the slides in the bath of pure May-Grünwald for 3 min, then rinse them in the bath of phosphate buffer solution for 1 min and finally transfer them for 10 min in the bath of Giemsa R (1/20 in phosphate buffer solution).\nAfter that, rinse the slides again in the bath of phosphate buffer solution for 10 sec and let them dry.\nExamine the stained slides under the microscope. Females that can be used during the day are those whose samples present only large cornified epithelial cells (without nucleus, stained in blue; full estrus).\nPut the males in the test room at least 30 min before testing them.\nVocalization Recordings\n\t\nRepeat 3.1 if necessary.\nIntroduce the male to be tested (on fresh bedding). Leave him habituate to the test cage in the soundproof chamber for 10 min.\nAfter this habituation time, introduce a female in estrus (among the ones selected from the staining).",
    "Start recording the ultrasonic vocalizations and the video to capture the introduction of the female in the test cage. Start recording the ultrasonic vocalizations during habituation (male alone) if a comparison between the baseline level of vocalization emission during cage exploration and the social interaction is needed.\nSynchronize manually/visually the audio and video recordings by pressing on the time watch (\"bip\" sound near the microphone) exactly when the hind paws of the female mouse touch the ground.\nLeave the two animals interact for the desired time (for instance 4 min, a duration sufficient to collect enough ultrasonic vocalizations).\nPut the male and the female back in their respective home cages. Empty the used bedding from the test cage, wash it with soap water and dry it with paper towels. Put fresh bedding and place it back in the soundproof chamber for the next test.\n\t\tNote: It is optimal to use each estrus female only one time each day (but if necessary it can be used up to 3 times on the same day but not in a row).\n5. Variables to Be Extracted\nPrepare audio files for the analyses. Note: The procedure below is specific to Avisoft SASLab Pro and may change according to the software used.\n\t\nCut the files so that they start exactly at the \"bip\" of the time watch, and end after the desired duration (5 min for pup recordings, 4 min for adult recordings).\nFilter out the amplitude under 30 kHz by using a high-pass filter (Edit>Filter>FIR Time Domain Filter; High Pass with 30 kHz frequency cut off). Use batch processing to filter all files of interest (Actions>Batch Processing>FIR filter).\nIdentify each ultrasonic vocalization by labelling them with the software.",
    "Use automatic detection for pup recordings (Tools>Labels>Create section labels from waveform events). Adjust threshold, hold time and margin for the most accurate detection. Manually check the detection and adjust labels if necessary (recommended).\nUse visual detection (manual insertion of labels) for adult recordings with background noise (select the vocalizations, click right, and insert section label from marker).\nCreate the spectrogram. Activate automatic parameter measurements (Tools>Automatic Parameter Measurements>Automatic Parameter Measurements Set up).\nCheck the \"Enable automatic measurements\", the \"Compute parameters from entire spectrogram\", and the \"Automatic update\" boxes. Select \"Element separation\": interactively (section labels).\nCheck boxes to calculate the desired temporal parameters (Duration of element, Interval, Start/End time) and spectrum-based parameters (Peak frequency), and the location of measurements (Start of element, End of element, Mean, Max, Min).\nCopy the measurements and paste them in a spreadsheet.\n\t\tNote: For recordings conducted with adults, measurements of spectrum-based parameters might be impossible because of background noise. Use manual measurements of peak frequency by clicking on the different frequency values directly on the spectrogram and pasting the values manually in a table.\nDetermine call rate, i.e., number of calls per minute by first determining the number of vocalizations emitted (total number of labels). Then, calculate the call rate by dividing the total number of vocalizations recorded by the duration (in minutes) of the file.\nDetermine temporal organization, i.e., distribution of time intervals between calls to determine sequence organization.\n\t\nCalculate the time intervals between the end of the vocalization n and the start of the vocalization n+1 using the start/end time of each label.\nEstablish the distribution density of the time intervals between ultrasonic vocalizations.\nDetermine call repertoire, i.e., define the call types present in the recording. Use the example of classification presented in Table 1 and Figure 1B.",
    "When labeling each vocalization in 5.1.3, write the name of the call type in the label.\nCalculate the exact number and the proportion of each call type to build the vocal repertoire.\nDetermine acoustic characteristics for each vocalization, i.e., duration, peak frequency (i.e., frequency with the highest amplitude) at the beginning and the end of the call, maximum and minimum peak frequency, and mean frequency if automatic measurement is possible (Figure 1B).\n\t\nUse the automatic parameter measurements function in the software to measure automatically duration, peak frequency characteristics (e.g., start, end, mean, maximum, minimum) in pup recordings.\nUse the duration of the label as the duration of the vocalization for adult recordings. Measure manually on the spectrogram window the peak frequency characteristics (e.g., start, end, maximum, minimum).\nCouple ultrasonic vocalization data and social interaction data (MiceProfiler plugin from the ICY platform22).\n\t\nMake sure to synchronize as precisely as possible the audio and the video recordings as described in the protocol.\nEncode the video of the social interaction using the Mice Profiler Tracker plugin of the ICY platform as described in de Chaumont et al.22. Start the tracking exactly when the hind paws of the introduced animal touch the ground.\nUpload the encoded video file and its corresponding xml file (generated by Mice Profiler Tracker) in the Mice Profiler Video Label Maker plugin of the ICY platform as described in de Chaumont et al.22.\n\t\tNote: The Mice Profiler Video Label Maker plugin will automatically link the video file and the text file generated from the analysis of the audio file if they have the same name (see: http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/plugin/Mice_Profiler_Video_Label_Maker).",
    "After checking that the mouse scale is correct, click on \"Create USV stats\" for each file to obtain the number and the proportion of vocalizations emitted during each social event in a separated file.\n6. Uploading Files on the mouseTube Database\nMake sure the files are on a storage server which can be accessed from outside the institution.\n\tNote: Servers hosted in some institutions with high security levels will need a specific configuration to be accessible by people connecting from outside the institution.\nGo to the mouseTube website (http://mousetube.pasteur.fr). Log in (login and password are attributed to each user by the administrators).\nCheck whether the mouse strain recorded already exists in the mouseTube database by clicking on the \"Strains\" button. If not, ask the administrators to create it.\nCreate subjects using the \"Subjects>Create\" button. Enter the identification codes of the animals recorded. Gather them in groups to ease later retrieval of data.\nEnter the description of the protocol used to record ultrasonic vocalizations using the \"Protocols>Create\" button.\nCreate an experiment for each recording session using the \"Experiments>Create\" button. Specify the protocol, the group of individuals which has been recorded, the hardware and software used and their specificities.\n\tNote: The experiment gathers all the metadata corresponding to the vocalization files.\nCreate the link to the vocalization files using the \"Vocalisations>Create\" button. Select the experiment within the list. Copy and paste the url of the vocalization file (this link begins with http://…) into the corresponding field of the “Files to link” column. Validate the entries by clicking on the button “Create a link between mouseTube and the files”.\n\tNote: It is not required to fill each box for each file at the same time.",
    "If necessary, modify the links entered at any moment, and add details in the \"Notes\" section. Do not hesitate to write down notes to give more details. For instance, if a link toward a video file that was recorded simultaneously with the audio file has been entered, this can be specified in the \"Notes\"."
