    "1. System Set-up\nThe system consists of a holding and concentrating tank (HCT) fitted with a single stage mixer, an in-line high shear homogenizer, a roller pump to move fluid between the HCT and the homogenizer, and a heat-exchanger (Figure 1).\nPlace a sterilized, wide-mouthed 4 L glass collection vessel fitted with 2 base ports and 3 side ports beneath the single stage mixer. Lower the mixer head to the mouth of the vessel and ensure a gas-tight fitting using rubber seals or tape (in order to prevent ambient air from contaminating the head space).\nFit one of the base ports (Figure 1, port #1) of the HCT with sterile 3/8” (ID) clear tubing, approximately 10” long, fitted with a 3-way stopcock at the tip for collection of the concentrated emulsion.\nFit the second base port (Figure 1, port #2) with sterile 3/8” (ID) tubing, approximately 36” in length. Feed this tubing through a roller pump. Fit the inlet of the high shear homogenizer with a T-piece including two ports and connect as follows: connect tubing from port #2, through the roller pump and connect to the side port of the T-piece. Attach the other port to an oxygen tank using a low-flow oxygen gas flowmeter.\nConnect the outlet port of the high shear homogenizer to the inlet port of an in-line heat exchanger maintained at 4 °C. Connect the outlet port of the heat exchanger to the return port of the HCT (Figure 1, port #3), creating a closed loop system.\nAttach an oxygen tank (via a flowmeter) to the HCT (Figure 1, port #4). Attach a gas composition monitor that is open to atmosphere to the top port of the HCT (Figure 1, port #5).",
    "If sterility is desired, sterilize the glass and metal components before each use by autoclave. Sterilize the tubing components and plastic connectors by ethylene oxide before each use. This is especially important if the product is to be tested in vivo.\n2. LOM Manufacture\nPlace 20 g of GMP 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and 10 g of cholesterol in the base of the HCT. Add 1 L of Plasma-Lyte A to the HCT and hand stir for 1 min, integrating as much lipid as possible into aqueous phase.\nLower the single stage mixer into the aqueous phase, ensuring that the entire mixer head is covered by the aqueous phase. Ensure that the top of the HCT is gas tight (see Step 1.1 above) and that there are no open side ports. Turn on the gas source attached to port #4 and wait until the oxygen fraction of the HCT headspace reaches >95%. At 10 L/min (LPM), this should take ~10 min.\nUsing the single stage mixer, mix the precursor emulsion for 5 min at 5,000 rpm. The resulting mixture should appear pale white and contain no visible lipid clumps. Once mixed, unused lipid-water mixture can be stored at 4 ºC for up to 30 days before single use.\nPrime the entire closed loop system with the precursor emulsion by turning on the roller pump at 1.3 LPM. Once the system is primed, keep the pump on at 1.3 LPM.",
    "To begin manufacture of the LOMs, turn on the in-line high shear homogenizer to 7,500 rpm. Immediately thereafter, turn on oxygen flow to the inlet portion of the homogenizer at 0.5 LPM. Keep the single stage mixer (in the HCT) on at 3,500 rpm. LOMs are formed at the interface of rotor blades and the emulsor screens within the in-line homogenizer (Figure 2). Within minutes, fluid should become visibly more viscous. A more rigorous approach is to determine viscosity as a function of time, which can be done by removing aliquots from Port 1 during fabrication and analyzing with a viscometer.\n\tNote: If visible air bubbles are present in the tubing exiting the mixer, oxygen flow to the in-line homogenizer is too high. Titrate down gas flow until fluid is opaque and contains no visible gas bubbles.\nRun the system for 15 min, and then turn off the high shear homogenizer and the oxygen inlet to it. Continue to run the single stage mixer in the HCT until the emulsion is removed; this mitigates phase separation and keeps the product relatively uniform within the HCT.\n\tNote: The volume of the gas-filled emulsion should increase approximately 2-3x during the serial concentration phase. If it does not, check to ensure that oxygen is flowing into the high shear homogenizer and that lipid concentrations in the precursor emulsion are correct. Efficiency of production decreases as lipid concentration decreases.\n3. Collection, Concentration, Assessment, and Storage of LOMs\nAttach a sterile, modified 140 ml luer-lock syringe to the stopcock attached to base port #1 on the collection vessel. Draw up 100 ml of fluid. Tightly cap syringe and repeat until all fluid has been removed.",
    "Modify syringes by withdrawing 100 ml of air into the syringe and then sawing off the excess plunger and syringe material above the 140 ml mark. Fill and empty syringes using toothed forceps to draw up the plunger. This modification allows easier centrifugation.\nCentrifuge syringes with the capped end oriented downward in a refrigerated (4 ºC) bucket centrifuge at 225 x g for 10 min.\nThree layers of material will appear after centrifugation. Expel the bottom layer of excess cloudy aqueous phase and discard. The second layer is bright white and contains concentrated LOMs. Transfer concentrated foam to a gas-impermeable syringe using a three-way stopcock to prevent ambient gas contamination. Discard the final layer, which contains free oxygen gas from ruptured LOMs.\nFoam quality can be assessed by reaching ≥90% gas of concentrated foam. Calculate gas concentration as follows:\n\tVolume % gas = [(Foam weight/ Foam volume)- 1] x 100\n\t\nAs a second quality control, size microbubbles by light obscuration to determine if particle size is within the expected range. It should be noted that a change in homogenization time or formulation might alter bubble size.\nTightly cap the glass syringe with a luer-lock fitting. Concentrated LOMs can be diluted with Plasma-Lyte A at the time of use. Syringes can be stored at 22, 4, or -20 ºC; colder temperatures may provide enhanced shelf-life stability7.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
