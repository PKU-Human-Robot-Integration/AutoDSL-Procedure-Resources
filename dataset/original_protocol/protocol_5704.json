    "Construct designA single copy of RNA Mango is usually sufficient for the pull down analysis and can be inserted into pre-existing stem loops that do not interfere with the function of the RNA of interest (Figure 2 (Panchapakesan et al., 2017; Trachman III et al., 2017). If inserting into a pre-existing stem loop structure, the RNA Mango quadruplex core and GAAA tetraloop-like isolation domain then the Mango aptamer can be inserted within the stem structure using the following sequence: 5’-...NNN NNN GAA GGG ACG GUG CGG AGA GGA GAN’ N’N’N’ N’N’.., where the left arm of the arbitrary RNA helix is indicated by N residues. The right arm (being the reverse complement of the left) is indicated by N’ symbols. The GAAA tetraloop-like isolation motif (shown in italics) together with the TO1-Desthiobiotin binding quadruplex core (in bold) being inserted within the arbitrary helix. While GNRA tetraloops are common in nature, RNA Mango can also be inserted into the 3’ or 5’ end of an unstructured RNA of interest. In this case, RNA Mango (including the GAAA tetraloop-like motif) together with an arbitrary stem should be inserted. New Mango tags (Mango II, III and IV) can be inserted in a similar fashion (Autour et al., 2018).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180401/20180401205334_9406.jpgFigure 2. Design of biologically compatible Mango-I tags. A. A general GNRA tetraloop structure is shown, depicted using Leontis-Westhof nomenclature (Leontis and Westhof, 2001). B. Structure of Mango I (figure modified from Autour et al. (2018)). Mango can be incorporated into naturally occurring stem-loop structures by replacing the N-N’ stem highlighted in purple with the stem sequence of the RNA of interest.",
    "In Mango I, a GAAA tetraloop-like motif (blue) encloses the core G-quadruplex (3 tiers: T1, T2, T3) by flanking it such that the Mango I core fits into GAA/A, where ‘/’ is the point of the Mango core insertion. Thus, Mango I can be inserted into a pre-existing GNRA tetraloop structure in a similar manner, so long as Mango does not interfere with the tetraloop’s biological function. The Mango tagged RNA should be tested for the functionalities of the Mango tag as well as the RNA of interest. The functionality of the Mango tag can be tested by measuring the fluorescence of the Mango tagged RNA of interest and comparing it to in vitro transcribed RNA Mango (Panchapakesan et al., 2017). Typically, a 1 µM solution of RNA is made along with two-fold excess of TO1-Dtb ligand in 1x Binding buffer. After incubating at RT for 5 min, fluorescence assays can be performed using a fluorometer. For a SpectraMax M5 fluorometer, the following excitation and emission setup is optimal for analyzing RNA Mango mediated fluorescence: Excitation at 495 nm; Emission 535 nm PMT: Medium, Cut-off 515 nm–Bottom read. Using a SpectraMax M5 under the aforementioned settings, RNA Mango concentrations as low as 5 nM can be reliably detected. The user should optimize the excitation and emission wavelengths to minimize interference from the excitation light source of the specific fluorometer being used. Native extract preparationBacterial cells (E. coli) with RNA Mango tagged RNA of interest should be grown in appropriate growth conditions to maximize the formation of the RNP complex desired. We typically grew cells overnight in 1 L LB media. Cells are then pelleted at 3,800 x g (RCF) for 10 min in a refrigerated Sorvall RC6+ centrifuge, using a Sorvall SLA-1500 rotor.",
    "The resulting cell pellet is then re-suspended in 20 ml of pre-chilled BNE buffer in ice. Cells are lysed by passaging through a 4 °C French press twice at 1,000 psi. If a French press is unavailable, then alternative cell disruption techniques such as sonication or enzymatic methods such as lysozyme digestion can be used. This crude lysate is then cleared by centrifugation at 13,200 x g (RCF) for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate is flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until ready for use. For other organisms, including yeast, appropriate native extract preparation protocols should be used.Ensure the presence of KCl (90 to 150 mM), depending upon the stability of RNP complex of interest, as binding to TO1-Desthiobiotin requires KCl (Dolgosheina et al., 2014; Jeng et al., 2016; Panchapakesan et al., 2017). Handle all material in Steps B2 and B3 PROMPTLY on ice.TO1-Desthiobiotin streptavidin agarose bead preparationPrepare an appropriate amount of streptavidin agarose bead slurry. Using 7 ml of bacterial extract and 700 μl of streptavidin agarose bead slurry, derivatized with 42 nanomoles of TO1-Desthiobiotin, we obtained high quality results when overexpressing the 6S regulatory RNA (Dolgosheina et al., 2014; Panchapakesan et al., 2017). Scale the protocol below to suit experimental conditions.Carefully re-suspend streptavidin agarose bead slurry by gentle agitation.Take up 700 μl streptavidin agarose beads in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Wash twice at room temperature (RT) with 1 ml Buffer A, 2 min each, using a standard laboratory rotator. The tubes can be centrifuged briefly in a Picofuge to remove excess liquid from the beads. Wash beads three times using 1 ml HK buffer for 2 min each wash, again using a rotator.",
    "For every 100 μl streptavidin agarose beads incubate with 6 nanomoles of TO1-Desthiobiotin in 100 μl of HK buffer. Incubate at RT for 15 min on a rotator. Note the OD500 (ɛ500 = 63,000 M-1 cm-1) of the fluorophore solution before and after binding to the beads to estimate the amount of fluorophore bound using a NanoDrop. More than 90% of TO1-Desthiobiotin should be bound. The color of the beads will now turn orange because of the fluorophore binding. Different beads may have distinct binding capacities, which should be empirically determined if needed. Wash with 1 ml of HK buffer to remove residual unbound fluorophore.Binding of extract to prepared agarose beadsSince the final goal of this procedure is to purify RNP complexes in native conditions, care should be taken not to denature the complex in every step of the purification viz., bead binding, washing and elution. Since RNA Mango requires KCl for proper folding and binding to the TO1-Desthiobiotin ligand (Dolgosheina et al., 2014; Jeng et al., 2016; Trachman III et al., 2017), KCl should be included in all binding, washing and elution steps. Other components of the buffer can be modified according to experimental needs.Bind 7 ml of bacterial extract to beads at RT. Incubate at RT for 15 min on a rotator (in the case of yeast extract (Panchapakesan et al., 2017), binding is performed at 4 °C, to ensure stabilization of the RNP complex). The extract can be diluted, if required, by the addition of BNE or Binding buffer to the extract.Wash twice with 1 ml Binding buffer for 2 min each on a rotator. The number of washes selected depends on the anticipated stability of the RNP complex.",
    "Likewise, the temperature (4-37 °C) and time (2-15 min) of each wash can be significantly adjusted if optimization is required.Biotin-mediated native elutionElute using 20 mM Biotin elution buffer in 500 μl volume at 37 °C (Panchapakesan et al., 2017) for 20 min on a rotator as biotin effectively displaces desthiobiotin from streptavidin (Hirsch et al., 2002). It is desirable to perform downstream processing immediately following biotin-mediated native elution. If not, the sample should be aliquoted and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use. Downstream processing: Microtiter plate fluorescence assay and gel staining assaysLoad 200 μl of biotin eluate into a 96-well black wall, clear bottom microtiter plate and measure fluorescence emission. To estimate the purity, expression level and integrity of the RNA fraction of the Mango pulldown, phenol chloroform extract 20 μl of the biotin eluate, together with equivalent volumes of input, flow through and wash. Perform denaturing 5% PAGE with TBE as described elsewhere. If the RNA is well expressed, SYBR staining can be used to visualize both the RNA of interest and judge levels of RNA contamination. If the RNA expression levels are low, a Northern blot can be used to judge RNA integrity and expression levels.Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) of streptavidin-purified Mango complexAs the biotin-eluted RNP complex is highly fluorescent (while it is bound to TO1-Desthiobiotin), it can be further purified with secondary purification techniques such as SEC (Panchapakesan et al., 2017). For SEC purification, load onto a size exclusion column containing SEC resin appropriate for the expected molecular size of the RNP complex being purified. To purify the Mango-tagged 6S RNA in complex with bacterial RNAP, we used a Superdex 200 column (24 ml, 16 mm diameter) using HK buffer at 0.1 ml/min flow rate.",
    "In this example, 380 μl of the biotin extract was loaded onto the column. The column was run at 4 °C and 500 μl fractions were collected in silanized plastic tubes.Fraction analysis: 200 μl from each fraction was placed into a 96-well black wall, clear-bottom microtiter plate, and fluorescence measured using a SpectraMax M5 fluorescence plate reader (settings as previously described). Note that RNA Mango fluorescence is temperature sensitive, maximum fluorescence being obtained at lower temperatures (Jeng et al., 2016). Hence, if the signal to noise ratio is lower at RT, the signal can in principle be improved by measuring fluorescence at 4 °C provided that condensation can be avoided.Pool the fluorescent fractions of interest. The purified RNP complexes can be analyzed using a variety of techniques such as Mass Spec analysis, Western blot etc. We have used the University of British Columbia Proteomics Core Facility, where samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS after purification from SDS PAGE gel with success."
