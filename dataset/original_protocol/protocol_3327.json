This two-day procedure involves the preparation of a lentiviral vector backbone for gRNA cloning and the annealing of oligos, followed by ligation to create a functional construct. This detailed walkthrough will facilitate the precise design and assembly of gRNAs, a fundamental component of CRISPR-based experiments, allowing for targeted genomic modifications.\nDay 1\nPreparation of backbone for cloning gRNAs:\nDigest the lentiviral vector (Addgene #57822)7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] using the BsmB1 enzyme.\nAssemble the reaction mixture as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3093_1.csv\nIncubate at 55°C for 3 h to ensure complete digestion.\nPerform gel electrophoresis of the digested product on a 0.8% agarose gel.\nEnsure that the samples are run for at least 90 min to achieve sufficient separation.\nTo serve as a control for digestion, load the undigested plasmid in the adjacent well.\nCarefully excise the desired digested backbone (∼8000 bp) using a clean blade and purify it using the Zymo gel purification Kit[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4001t_d4001_d4002_d4007_d4008_zymoclean_gel_dna_recovery_kit.pdf] as per the manufacturer’s protocol.\nElute the purified product in 25 μL of nuclease-free water and adjust the concentration to 50 ng/μL.\nNote: The digestion and gel purification of 4 μg of plasmid will yield approximately 2000–2500 ng, which is adequate for cloning 40–50 gRNAs. It is essential to digest an adequate amount of plasmid, considering the total number of gRNAs to be cloned.\nDay 2\nAnnealing of gRNA oligos:\nReconstitute the lyophilized forward and reverse oligos to 100 pm concentration.\nAssemble the oligo annealing reaction as follow in a PCR tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3093_2.csv\nSet up the following reaction in a thermocycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3093_3.csv\nTake 1 μL of annealed product and dilute it (1:200) using sterile water. Store at 4°C until use.",
    "Note: The steps described are for a single gRNA. Perform similar reactions for all gRNAs.\nLigation:\nSet up the reaction as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3093_4.csv\nMix thoroughly and incubate at 16°C for 12–16 h, then store at 4°C until transformation.\nCloning and confirmation of clones\nTiming: 5 days\nThis protocol outlines the step-by-step process for cloning and validating the guide RNAs (gRNAs) for use in downstream editing experiments. The protocol spans five days and includes key procedures such as transformation, colony picking, glycerol stock preparation, colony PCR, Sanger sequencing, and plasmid isolation.

Representative Sanger sequencing data for successful cloning of gRNA into lentiviral backbone\nNote: If any clone yields a negative result, proceed to the sequencing stage for the subsequent clones.\nInoculation of positive clones:\nAfter confirming the clones, proceed to plasmid isolation by inoculating the positive clones.\nFor each gRNA, prepare 10 mL of LB broth (with ampicillin).\nUsing a sterile loop, transfer a small volume of the glycerol stock from the positive clone into the LB broth.\nKeep in a shaker incubator for 16 h at 37°C.",
    "Note: ensuring that the glycerol stock does not thaw completely during the process.\nDay 5\nIsolation of plasmid DNA from the inoculum:\nIsolate the plasmid using MN mini plasmid kit[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/PT4022/PT4022-1.pdf] as per the manufacturer’s protocol.\nSubsequently, dilute the isolated plasmids to achieve a final concentration of 500 ng/μL. Store the plasmid at −20°C until use.\nLenti-virus production for gRNA\nTiming: 4–5 days\nThis section outlines the steps involved in the production and collection of lentiviral particles packaged with gRNA. The focus here is to culture healthy and actively dividing HEK293T cells, followed by the transfection of gRNA plasmids along with lentiviral packaging vectors to generate lentivirus. The protocol spans 4–5 days and includes critical procedures such as cell seeding, transfection, verification of successful transfection through GFP expression, and virus collection. These steps are essential for obtaining high-quality viral particles.\nDay 1\nCulturing HEK293T cells:\nSeed healthy and actively dividing HEK293T cells in one well of 6 well plate so that it would reach 70–80% confluency in 24 h.\nIncrease the number of wells based on the number of gRNAs.\nDay 2\nTransfection:\nEnsure that HEK293T cells are approximately 80% confluent and healthy.\nBring the transfection reagent (FuGENE HD) to 25–30°C.\nPrepare the transfection mixture as given below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3093_7.csv\nIncubate the mixture in 25–30°C for 15–20 min.\nRemove the cell culture dish with HEK293T cells from the incubator and place it inside the biosafety cabinet.\nAdd the transfection reagent dropwise to the cells.\nGently swirl the dish to ensure even distribution of the mixture, then return the dishes and incubate for 48 h.\nDay 4\nConfirmation of transfection:\nBefore proceeding with virus collection ensure that the transfection was successful and gRNA plasmids are expressing GFP by using fluorescence microscopy.",

The protocol encompasses several key phases, starting with the preparation of endotoxin-free plasmids, followed by the production of lentivirus, and culminating in the creation of stable cell lines.",
    "In this protocol, we have used codon optimized ABE and CBE max constructs with puromycin selectable marker from Lucas Dow (pLenti-FNLS-P2A-Puro (Addgene #110841-CBE) and pLenti-ABERA-P2A-Puro (Addgene #112675-ABE)).8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] There are newer versions of base editors with increased processivity, modified PAMs, and editing windows, which can be obtained from plasmid repositories such as Addgene. To ensure consistent and reproducible results in downstream processes, we recommend using BE lentiviral constructs that incorporate antibiotic selection markers. These markers enable the isolation of pure transduced populations by conferring resistance to specific antibiotics, allowing the generation of stable cell lines with the desired characteristics. We have used second generation lentiviral packaging constructs in this study (Addgene #12259 and #12260), a gift from Didier Trono. Readers are directed to the review article by Anzalone et al. for a detailed comparison of various base editors available that would aid in choosing the BE for your application.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nDay 1\nEndotoxin free plasmid preparation:\nInoculate the bacterial stock in LB broth with appropriate antibiotic (Ampicillin 100 μg/mL) and culture for 16 h.\nHarvest the bacteria by centrifuging the inoculum at 2700 g for 10 min at 25–30°C in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully collect the pellet for plasmid isolation, and discard the supernatant.\nIsolate the plasmid using NucleoBond Xtra Midi EF[href=https://www.takarabio.com/a/112713] (Macherey-Nagel) kit.\nNote: Ensure that the final concentration of plasmid preparation is not below 500 ng/μL.\nDay 2–5\nLentivirus production:\nNote: The steps described here are for preparing lentivirus with one of the above-mentioned constructs.

After collecting the virus bleach and discard the HEK293T cells.\nComposition for preparation of PEG virus concentrator.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3093_9.csv\nCentrifuge the incubated mixture at 2700 g for 30 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the viral pellet in 200 μL of 1x PBS.\nMake two aliquots of 100 μL and store the virus at −80°C for the downstream process.\nNote: ensure that the lentivirus is transported and maintained on ice to prevent any drop in efficiency.\nDay 6–26\nTransduction of relevant cell line to prepare base editor stables:\nNote: This protocol describes the utilization of the HUDEP-2 cell line. However, it is important to note that the protocol can be readily customized and applied to different cell lines as needed.",
    "Day 6: Revive approximately 0.5 million cells (1 million cells are needed on the day of transduction).\nDay 8: Passage the cells and make sure they are healthy.\nDay 10: Transduction.\nSeed 0.5 million cells per well in 2 wells of a 6 well plate.\nTo each well add 20 μL of 1 M HEPES buffer and 2 μL of polybrene (6 mg/mL).\nCarefully thaw the stored virus (100 μL) and add it into one well.\nThe other well would serve as the non-transduced control.\nSpinfection is carried out by centrifugation of the plate at 800 g for 30 min.\nMake sure the acceleration and brake are low (5 and 5).\nKeep the plates back in the incubator.\nNote: Use parafilm to seal the plate during centrifugation to avoid any accidental spillage as the culture contains lentivirus.\nDay 12 & 14: Selection of the stables.\nMake sure that the transduced cells are viable.\nReseed the cells in a fresh 6 well plate.\nAdd 2 μL puromycin per mL of media (1 mg/mL) to both controls as well as the transduced samples.\nAfter two days check the cells under a microscope.\nAll cells in the control well must be dead and there would be ∼60%–80% cell death in the transduced well.\nPerform a media change and reseed the viable cells with the same concentration of puromycin.\nNote: If viable cells are persisting in the control well, increase the puromycin concentration until complete cell death is observed. Ensure that the same concentration is used for the transduced cells as well. Performing a literature search will provide insights into the suitable puromycin concentration for each specific cell line.\nDay 16–26: Stable cells maintenance and expansion.\nDo media change on alternate days and maintain the cells in puromycin.",
    "Ensure the cells are healthy and expand enough.\nAfter 10 days of puromycin selection, the cells are ready for gRNA transduction.\nFreeze cells in multiple vials as backup and store them in liquid nitrogen (−196°C).\nNote: Transcriptome profiling of the stable cells can be performed and compared with wild type cells to ensure that during stable preparation the intrinsic properties of the cells are not altered significantly.\nTransduction of gRNAs in base editor stables\nTiming: 10 days\nThis comprehensive 10-day protocol focuses on transducing a base editing stable cell line with lentivirus carrying gRNA. The primary objective is to confirm the transduction and the editing obtained in the stable cells. The protocol encompasses crucial steps like maintaining optimal cell density, conducting lentiviral transduction, and assessing transduction efficiency through GFP expression via flow cytometry. Precise execution of these steps is imperative to achieve a transduction efficiency exceeding 95%, maximizing the potential for base substitutions across most cells. The protocol culminates in DNA isolation, target region amplification, and the assessment of base editing efficiency using data obtained from Sanger sequencing or NGS with appropriate software.\nDay 1\nReviving stable cell line:\nRevive and expand the cryopreserved base editor stable cells by culturing them in a growth medium supplemented with puromycin prior.\nIt is crucial to have approximately 0.2 million cells per guide RNA (gRNA) to facilitate simultaneous screening of the gRNAs.\nTherefore, ensure an adequate quantity of cells to accommodate the screening of the gRNAs concurrently.\nTransduction:\nUpon reaching the desired cell quantity, carefully distribute 0.2 million cells per well in a 12-well plate, utilizing 1 mL of media for each well.\nTo each well, add 10 μL of 1 M HEPES buffer and 1 μL of polybrene (6 mg/mL).",

For other cell lines, the viral titer and polybrene concentration may need to be adjusted accordingly to achieve a transduction efficiency exceeding 95%.\nNote: Polybrene, HEPES buffer, and spinfection enhance lentivirus transduction efficiency by facilitating better viral entry, maintaining stable conditions, and increasing contact between viral particles and target cells, respectively.\nNote: Measuring MOI values for each gRNA in the screening would be time consuming and incur additional cost. This is the reason why we recommend optimizing the transduction protocol to achieve maximum transduction efficiency.\nDay 2\nEvaluation of transduction efficiency:\nUtilize approximately 150 μL of the cell culture for analysis.\nPrior to analysis, wash the cells with 1x PBS.\nEvaluate transduction efficiency using flow cytometry by measuring the percentage of GFP expression (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3093-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
