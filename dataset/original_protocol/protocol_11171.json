    "1. Cell preparation\nCell digestion and neutralization\n\t\nSeed tumor cells (such as MDA-MB-231 cells) in a 6 well plate, and culture them in a 37 °C incubator supplied with 5% CO2.\nHarvest cells when their density reaches about 90%. Aspirate the culture medium thoroughly and wash the cells 2x with 3 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\tNOTE: To examine the effects of signaling pathway inhibitors (e.g., FRA1 inhibitor), or activators (e.g., STAT3 activator) on stemness features of tumor cells, tumor cells are seeded in a 6 well plate and pretreated with inhibitors or activators for a certain amount of time before harvest.\nAdd 500 µL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to each well of the 6 well plate, place the plate in an incubator at 37 °C for 1–3 minutes (min), and gently tap the plate to detach the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Prolonged digestion will affect the SP profile due to changes in cell viability.\nAdd 3 mL of PBS supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to each well of the 6 well plate to terminate the digestion and gently pipette the cells up and down 3–5x to disperse the cell clumps.\nAdd 0.5 mL of cell suspension to one well of a new 6 well plate and examine it under a microscope. If cell clumps are observed, pass the cell suspension through a 70 µM cell strainer.\n\t\tNOTE: This is an optional step.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge cells at 200 x g for 5 min to pellet cells. Remove the supernatant and resuspend them in 3 mL of PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. Pipette the cells up and down 3–5x to mix thoroughly.\nCell counts",
    "Add 50 μL of the cell suspension into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and mix it with 50 μL trypan blue solution. Pipette 10 μL of the mixture to count the number of living cells using a standard method, such as a hemocytometer.\nDilute the cells in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS to a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL. Add 1 mL of the cell suspension to a 5 mL polystyrene round bottom test tube and prepare two sample tubes.\n2. Cell staining with Hoechst 33342\nAdd Hoechst 33342 to one tube to reach an appropriate final concentration.\n\tNOTE: For example, the appropriate concentration of Hoechst 33342 is 3 µg/mL for MDA-MB-231 cells.\nAdd a blocker (e.g., Fumitremorgin C, Verapamil, or Reserpine) to another tube to an appropriate final concentration and incubate the tube at 37 °C for 30 min before adding the same concentration of Hoechst 33342 as described in step 2.1.\n\tNOTE: For MDA-MB-231 cells, the appropriate blocker is Reserpine (40 µM). Reserpine is used as a blocking control to verify the absence of cells in the gated SP area.\nPrepare several tubes containing cells and add Hoechst 33342 to different concentration gradients. After a flow cytometry assay, choose the proper concentration according to the profile and proportion of SP.\n\tNOTE: This is an optional step used to define the proper concentration of Hoechst 33342.\nPrepare several tubes containing cells, add the blocker to different concentration gradients, incubate the tubes at 37 °C for 30 min, then add Hoechst 33342 to an appropriate concentration. After the flow cytometry assay, choose the proper concentration according to the absence of cells in the gated SP area.\n\tNOTE: This is an optional step used to define the proper concentration of blocker.",
    "Place the tubes in a 37 °C incubator and incubate them for 60 min, shaking the tubes every 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Shaking tubes thoroughly is important for staining, because it ensures complete contact between the cells and the dye for better staining results.\nAfter the incubation, centrifuge the cells at 200 x g, 4 °C for 5 min, and aspirate the supernatant carefully, because the cells form very loose and unstable pellets.\nResuspend cells of each tube in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and pipette the cells up and down 3–5x to mix thoroughly. Add 1 μL of 1 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI) to the suspension of each tube to identify dead cells.\n\tNOTE: All procedures in this step should be performed at 4 °C to inhibit the efflux of Hoechst 33342 from the tumor cells. The tubes should be protected from direct exposure to light.\n3. Analysis by flow cytometry\nNOTE: Instructions for use of the flow cytometer software (see Table of Materials) are described in this section and Supplementary Figures 1–10.\nIn the flow cytometer software, click the FOLDER button. Click the Experiment button, then click New Experiment (Supplementary Figure 1A,B).\nClick the OK button. “Experiment_001” will show up under the FOLDER (Supplementary Figure 2A,B).\nClick the Experiment_001 button to change the folder name to a specific name (e.g., \"20191118-SP\"). Click Enter. The new name (\"20191118-SP\") will show up under FOLDER (Supplementary Figure 3A,B).\nClick the New Specimen button to add a specimen to the new experiment folder (\"20191118-SP\"). Click the New Tube button to add a tube to the specimen. Click the Arrowhead button (Supplementary Figure 4A-C).\nClick the Parameters button and set up the parameters of the flow cytometer (Supplementary Figure 5).",
    "Use a 610 nm dichroic mirror short-pass (DMSP) to separate the emission wavelengths. Use a 450/20 nm BP filter to collect the blue fluorescence and a 675 nm EFLP to collect the red fluorescence.\n\t\tNOTE: Hoechst 33342 is excited with a UV laser at 355 nm and PI is excited at 488 nm.\nRun the cell samples on the flow cytometer.\n\tNOTE: SP cells can be sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) under sterile conditions. A total of 100,000–500,000 cells should be collected for the follow-up experiments.\n\t\nRun cells stained with Hoechst 33342 on the flow cytometer.\n\t\t\nPlace tubes containing cells stained with Hoechst 33342 on the cytometer.\nClick the Dot Plot button to display the dot plot, then click the X-axis and set it to “FSC-A”; click the Y-axis and set it to “PI-A”. Display the dot plot of forward scatter pulse area (FSC-A, X-axis set to linear mode) versus the PI fluorescence (Y-axis set to logarithmic scale). Adjust the voltages to show the living cells in the right side and the non-living cells, which are brightly stained with PI, in the upper left corner. Then, establish a polygon gate to exclude dead cells and cell debris (Figure 1A) by clicking the Polygon Gate button to gate the P1 subset, also known as FSC-A, PI-A subset (Supplementary Figure 6A,B).",
    "Click the Dot Plot button to display the dot plot, click the X-axis and set it to “FSC-A”; click the Y-axis and set it to “FSC-W”. Display the dot plot of FSC-A (X-axis) versus forward scatter pulse width (FSC-W, Y-axis). Right-click the dot plot, click the P1 button under the Show Populations button. Click the Rectangular Gate button to create a rectangular gate to gate the P2 subset (also known as FSC-A, FSC-W subset). This will exclude cells with large volumes (Supplementary Figure 7A-C and Figure 1A).\nClick the Dot Plot button to display the dot plot, click the X-axis and set it to “SSC-A”; click the Y-axis and set it to “SSC-W”. Display the dot plot of side scatter pulse area (SSC-A, X-axis) versus side scatter pulse width (SSC-W, Y-axis). Right-click the dot plot, and click the P2 button under Show Populations button. Then click the Rectangular Gate button to create a rectangular gate to gate the P3 subset (also known as SSC-A, SSC-W subset). This will obtain a cell population with uniform granularity (Supplementary Figure 8A-C and Figure 1A).\nClick the Dot Plot button to display the dot plot, click the X-axis and set it to “Hoechst Red-A”; click the Y-axis and set it to “Hoechst Blue-A”. Display the dot plot of Hoechst Red-A (X-axis) versus Hoechst Blue-A (Y-axis). Right-click the dot plot, click the P3 button under the Show Populations button. Click the Polygon Gate button to create a polygon gate to gate the P4 subset (also known as Hoechst Red-A, Hoechst Blue-A subset). Right-click the dot plot, click the Show Population Hierarchy button to show the population hierarchy.",
    "NOTE: The dot plot will show three different populations: 1) a G0-G1 phase population near the center of the graph; 2) a S-G2/M phase population near the upper right corner; 3) the SP. The SP is then gated for further analysis (Supplementary Figure 9A-D and Figure 1A). If the dot plot of Hoechst Red-A versus Hoechst Blue-A does not show a SP profile similar to that shown in Figure 1A, the voltages should be adjusted until a similar profile is seen. Meanwhile, adjust all of above gates accordingly.\nAfter determining the gate region of the SP cells, click Acquire Data to collect 20,000–100,000 events from each sample to analyze the percentage of SP cells (Supplementary Figure 10).\nRun the Hoechst 33342-stained cells treated with blocker on the flow cytometer.\n\t\t\nPlace tubes containing blocker on the cytometer and run cells using the same voltages and gates to further check whether the voltages and gates are selected appropriately.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Compared with Hoechst 33342 staining alone, only a very small proportion of cells, if any, should appear in the gated area of the SP (Figure 1B).\nCollect 20,000–100,000 events from each sample to analyze the percentage of SP cells.\n4. Data analysis\nNOTE: Instructions for the use of the flow cytometry analysis software (see Table of Materials) are described in this section and Supplementary Figures 11–16.\nCopy the files in fcs format to a computer, open the flow cytometry analysis software, and drag one sample file to the software (Supplementary Figure 11A,B).\nGate cells and obtain the percentage of SP cells.\n\t\nDouble click this sample file, click the X-axis and set it to “FSC-A”; click the Y-axis and set it to “PI-A”. Then, create a polygon gate and click the OK button to obtain the FSC-A, PI-A subset (Supplementary Figure 12A-E).",
    "Double click the FSC-A, PI-A subset file, click the X-axis and set it to “FSC-A”; click the Y-axis and set it to “FSC-W”. Then, create a rectangular gate and click the OK button to obtain the FSC-A, FSC-W subset (Supplementary Figure 13A-E).\nDouble click the FSC-A, FSC-W subset file, click the X-axis and set it to “SSC-A”; click the Y-axis and set it to “SSC-W”. Then, create a rectangular gate and click the OK button to obtain the SSC-A, SSC-W subset (Supplementary Figure 14A-E).\nDouble click the SSC-A, SSC-W subset file, click the X-axis and set it to “Hoechst Red-A”; click the Y-axis and set it to “Hoechst Blue-A”. Then, create a polygon gate and click the OK button to obtain the Hoechst Red-A, Hoechst Blue-A subset (Supplementary Figure 15A-E).\nOpen the Layout Editor by clicking the Open Layout Editor button. Drag the SSC-A, SSC-W subset file to Layout Editor, then click the Click to save layout window to file button to save the image results (Supplementary Figure 16A-C).\nSave the workspace to keep the gating information when closing the software.\nPerform t-test analyses with statistical analysis software to compare the difference between two groups. A value of P < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
