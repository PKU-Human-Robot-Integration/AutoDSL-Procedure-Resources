    "Pharos is the user interface to the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the IDG program, providing facile access to most data types collected by the KMC (Nguyen et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0041]; Sheils et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0050]). Given the complexity of the data surrounding any target, efficient and intuitive visualization has been a high priority for users to navigate and summarize search results and rapidly identify patterns. Underlying the interface is a GraphQL API that provides programmatic access to all KMC data, enabling the incorporation of IDG resources with other applications.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nSearch targets\n1. Navigate to Pharos (https://pharos.nih.gov[href=https://pharos.nih.gov]).\n2. To search for a target, click on the search box on the main page or in the top left corner of subsequent pages. Enter STAT3. Note that multiple search types are available in the drop-down menu. (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0001])\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b57277d-3c90-4ff6-b523-f9ffe75afefb/cpz1355-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nTypeahead search results for STAT3 scroll or arrow down to view more options.\n3. It is possible to search by pathway or view a list of diseases or ligands associated with a target. Additionally, pressing Enter or Return will allow a text-based search, which will return a list of results featuring ‘STAT3’ anywhere in the text.\n4. Press Enter or Return, or click the magnifying glass icon to search for the ‘STAT3’ text string.\n5. A list of 81 targets is returned, with ‘STAT3’ being at the top of the list. The rest of the targets will have the phrase ‘STAT3’ somewhere within the target details (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5ddd1f5a-28e1-4b89-818b-bb4c309b3c58/cpz1355-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSearch Targets for STAT3 search results page.",
    "6. Click on the STAT3 card to view the target details.\nView target details\n7. Follow the steps above, or alternatively, click on the STAT3 (Target) option from the search box auto-complete. This will navigate directly to the STAT3 target details page.\n8. The target details page is divided into several sections that highlight an area of knowledge about the target.\n9. Scroll down to the “Protein Summary” section. A brief description of the target, as well as several identifiers, are available. In addition, the central radar plot charts the relative knowledge of a target compared to the rest of TCRD on a 0 to 1 scale. This data is sourced from the Harmonizome, which will be discussed further (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b17686c0-f97d-4588-8179-4cb7afb187ab/cpz1355-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nTarget details page for STAT3; the radar chart in the center depicts data from Harmonizome.\n10. Scroll down to the next section, “IDG Development Level Summary.” Displayed here is the current development level . Each level has the criteria listed, as well as links to the data for each property (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/52d3cb79-73e6-4634-9b2f-e43420bba863/cpz1355-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nIDG development level summary section that shows the current development level, and criteria met.

On the left side panel, click on “Disease Associations by Source.” This will navigate within the page to a section displaying disease associations from a variety of sources.",
    "12. Scroll down to the “Disease Novelty (Tin-x)” section, just below Disease Associations. A scatterplot is visible that shows Tin-x data. This data is explained in Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-prot-0006]. Briefly, it is natural language processed PubMed abstracts that chart a target's importance to a disease, as well as the novelty of that target to the disease. A dense chart indicates a large amount of knowledge about a target and its disease associations, whereas a sparser chart would indicate that target is not frequently studied and has fewer disease associations (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e2e1504f-2a65-4869-8933-b8be0b84a7ad/cpz1355-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nScatterplot depicting TIN-X data for STAT3. Hovering over a data point opens up a tooltip, providing novelty and importance data for the disease.\n13. Scroll down to the next section “GWAS Traits.” Here a table of GWAS traits is displayed. This list focuses on scoring and ranking protein-coding genes associated with traits from genome-wide association studies. This allows the discovery of traits most associated with a target, but also less emphasized traits (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/54febf72-91fd-490f-b061-745b17d40e6f/cpz1355-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nGWAS traits, and the associated TIGA scatterplot.

From the STAT3 target details page, click on “Disease Associations by Source” on the left panel.\n15. Click on the “Find Similar Targets” button, directly under the panel header (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0007]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/688ce0eb-28ea-4055-8df1-3b2ec05ba043/cpz1355-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nAdditional functions available within Pharos are shown within blue buttons. Users can click to browse filtered lists for targets similar to the current target, or associated diseases or ligands.\n16. The targets list page is now shown, with a target similarity filter applied, showing 17,876 targets (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0008]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4873861a-0e42-44c1-8b12-aefdcbf2a4fe/cpz1355-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8",
    "List of targets that share associated diseases with STAT3. The Jaccard index is a numerical value of the ratio of overlap between the associated diseases of the target in relation to the original target (STAT3). The Venn diagram is a visual representation of the ratio with the TDL level color coded.\n17. To refine this list for targets of interest to the IDG program (mentioned in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-prot-0001]), click on the “Refined (2020)” checkbox in the IDG Target Lists filter panel on the left side of the page.

Click the Run Download Query Button. A file download dialog will open. Depending on the complexity of the target list and the fields selected, this may take some time.\n25. After the file is downloaded, this list of targets can be used as a starting point for many of the protocols listed below.\nGraphQL queries\n26. Click on API on the main Pharos header.\n27. A code “sandbox” is now visible, allowing testing of GraphQL queries to fetch complex data from Pharos. A distinct feature of GraphQL is the ability of the consumer to determine the exact fields returned from the query, as opposed to a SQL query, where the data returned is determined by the database developer.\n28. Click the “Edit & Run” button for one of the Sample Queries on the left panel, and then the “Play” button in the top center. This will execute the query on the server and display the JSON results in the right panel.\n29. Click on the “Docs” tab on the right side of the page.

These are the entity types supported by the Harmonizome API:\n         \nDATASET, GENE, GENE_SET, ATTRIBUTE, GENE_FAMILY, NAMING_AUTHORITY, PROTEIN, RESOURCE\nOpen a new or existing Python code file. Import the required Harmonizome API Python module at the top of the file:\n         \nfrom harmonizomeapi import Harmonizome, Entity\nThe Harmonizome object includes several methods to read, parse, and download data from the Harmonizome API. The Harmonizome object includes .get(), .next() and .download() methods. For example, to display the datasets available in Harmonizome, run the following code block:\n         \nentity_list = Harmonizome.get(Entity.DATASET)\nmore = Harmonizome.next(entity_list)\nIn order to minimize database queries and request times, the Harmonizome API uses a technique called \"cursoring\" to paginate large result sets. Therefore, the first line in the above code block returns the first 100 datasets, whereas the second line continues from where the previous entity list left off and retrieves the subsequent 14 datasets that are available in Harmonizome. The Harmonizome.get()and Harmonizome.next() methods can be used for all entity types supported by the Harmonizome API.",
    "16. To download datasets available in Harmonizome to a local directory, use the Harmonizome.download() generator function. Alternatively Harmonizome.download_df() can be used to download files and load them in directly as sparse (with an added sparse=True argument) or dense Pandas DataFrames (assumed). The function takes a list of datasets and downloadables as arguments. Leaving the datasets argument empty will download all datasets by default. Leaving the what argument empty will download all downloadables for each dataset by default. In the example code below, the gene_attribute_matrix.txt.gz downloadable from the “CTD Gene-Chemical Interactions” dataset is downloaded, decompressed, and saved to a local directory named after the dataset if it has not already been processed:\ndl, = Harmonizome.download(datasets=[ˈCTD Gene-Chemical Interactionsˈ],\nwhat=[ˈgene_attribute_matrix.txt.gzˈ])\nMore information regarding the Harmonizome API is available at https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/documentation[href=https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/documentation].",

FASTQ files from RNA-seq experiments deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were aligned using a cloud-based infrastructure. The ARCHS4 web interface facilitates the exploration of the processed data through querying tools, interactive visualizations, and single-gene landing pages that provide average expression of a specific gene across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed genes, and predicted biological functions and protein–protein interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined with co-expression.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nMost updated version of R (https://www.r-project.org/[href=https://www.r-project.org/]); R Studio (https://www.rstudio.com/[href=https://www.rstudio.com/]); rhdf5 library (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rhdf5.html[href=https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rhdf5.html])\nMetadata search\n1.

    "Geneshot is a search engine for querying biomedical terms to retrieve lists of genes most associated with the term from PubMed ID (PMID) co-mentions (Lachmann et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0031]). To convert search terms to genes, Geneshot uses one of two resources: GeneRIF and AutoRIF. Both GeneRIF and AutoRIF are text files documenting gene-PubMed ID associations. These associations are used to rank genes for a query term based on the number of co-mentions. Geneshot further prioritizes other related genes based on co-occurrence and co-expression matrices with the genes associated with the term from the literature. Additionally, Geneshot includes a gene function prediction feature that prioritizes novel gene set membership for a query gene based on co-occurrence or co-expression.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nText editor or development environment of choice, such as Visual Studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/[href=https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/]); most updated version of Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/[href=https://www.python.org/downloads/]); and Python requests library (https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install/[href=https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install/])\nPubMed query\n1.

    "TIN-X (Target Importance and Novelty eXplorer; Cannon et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0011]) is an informatics workflow, REST API, and web application used to identify, visualize, and explore protein-disease associations. TIN-X is based on text mining data processed from scientific literature. TIN-X visualizations plot information for protein-disease associations along two axes, specifically “novelty” and “importance.” Briefly, Novelty is used to estimate the scarcity of publications about a protein target, whereas Importance estimates the strength of the association between that protein and a specific disease.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nBrowse diseases\n1. Navigate to the TIN-X web app (https://www.newdrugtargets.org/[href=https://www.newdrugtargets.org/]).\n2. The default TIN-X mode, “Browse Diseases,” (upper-left) starts with the Disease Ontology (DO; Schriml et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0048]; see Internet Resources). The DO hierarchy can then be navigated using the left panel (Fig. 68[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0068]). Given this hierarchical nature, a larger number of target-disease associations can be text-mined from biomedical literature for higher-level terms (e.g., N = 13405 for “nervous system disease”), as opposed to child terms (e.g., N = 9733 for “neurodegenerative disease,” N = 4587 for “Synucleinopathy,” N = 4587 for “Parkinson's Disease”) or leaf terms (e.g., N = 227 for “Early Onset Parkinson's Disease”).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/90da5617-44f3-4712-bcc8-26dbd1dfa6e2/cpz1355-fig-0068-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 68\nThe TIN-X “Browse Disease” view (left side) with Parkinson's Disease selected. Targets associated with Parkinson's Disease (right side) are plotted on a log scale of Importance versus Novelty, with each data point colored according to its Target Development Level (TDL).",
    "3. Searching by disease name is also supported. Targets with stronger associations (higher Importance) are in the upper part of the plot, while targets with a higher number of publications (lower Novelty) are located on the left side of the plot. Points situated in the upper-right area of the plot (if any) are most likely to be of interest, as they are located at the Pareto frontier, i.e., targets for which a large number of published papers mentioning that target also mention the selected disease.\n4. Targets are colored by Target Development Levels, and can be filtered as such (Tclin/Tchem/Tbio/Tdark). They can also be filtered by protein superfamily (e.g., kinases). Upon selecting a protein, links to both Pharos and DrugCentral are provided for that protein (Fig. 69[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0069]); selecting the titles allows the user to navigate through abstracts or to examine the document of interest in PubMed (additional clicks are required).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/def6b893-e517-4251-8237-f242d3972cb0/cpz1355-fig-0069-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 69\nClicking a target point within the Parkinson's Disease example, “Synaptogyrin-3” (SYNGR3) displays details including the full name and family of the target, Target Development Level (TDL), links to Pharos and DrugCentral, and, importantly, links to the associated two research articles (bottom).\n5. Once the desired level of granularity for diseases is reached, the user can examine target-disease associations, which are plotted along the Novelty-Importance axes in log-log format. To reach “Parkinson's Disease,” one must click Disease of anatomical entity → Nervous System Disease → Neurodegenerative disease → Synucleinopathy → Parkinson's Disease.",
    "6. A highly-ranked gene associated with Parkinson's Disease is “Synaptogyrin-3” (SYNGR3) and is classified as Tdark (Fig. 69[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0069]). While the exact function of SYNGR3 is unknown, there is recently published evidence that SYNGR3 encodes for a synaptic vesicle protein that interacts with a dopamine transporter (Egaña et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0017]). The most novel association (lowest Importance) is for “Tripartite motif-containing protein 10” (TRIM10), which is supported by one genome-wide association study (Witoelar et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0063]) focused on the overlap between Parkinson's Disease and autoimmune diseases.\n7. Both the “Browse Diseases” and the “Browse Targets” exploratory modes support an interactive way to manipulate the number of points displayed on the scatter plot. To change the number of plotted points, simply go to the top right side of the panel, where a vertical bar is placed between a “+” and a “-” sign. Sliding this bar up or down increases or decreases the number of visible points within the plot. By default, 300 or fewer points are plotted. Thresholds are defined by non-dominated solution (NDS) ranking, a.k.a. Pareto frontier, meaning that all hidden points are inferior to those visible in one or both variables.\nBrowse targets\n8. From the upper left menu, “Browse Targets” can be selected. The Drug Target Ontology (Lin et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0034]) hierarchy becomes visible, and can be navigated from the left panel (Fig. 70[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0070]). For each protein, Diseases are plotted with log–log Importance–Novelty axes and color-coded according to the top hierarchical Disease Ontology term (e.g., diseases of anatomical entity, diseases of metabolism, etc.).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/58f5c6e9-340e-4928-bd1c-9d7b6d27539d/cpz1355-fig-0070-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 70\nStarting with the superfamily Kinase, the user can further refine the selection to Protein kinase → CAMK group → TRIO family → Kalirin by using the left navigation pane within Browse Targets.",
    "9. Searching by target name is supported. Diseases with stronger associations (higher Importance) are in the upper part of the plot, while diseases with a higher number of publications (lower Novelty) are on the left side of the plot. Diseases that are likely of most interest are plotted in the upper-right area of the plot (Fig. 71[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0071]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/213848b8-82c7-46c4-87df-6903f6a389eb/cpz1355-fig-0071-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 71\nWithin “Browse Targets,” diseases associated with Kalirin (KALRN) are plotted with log–log Importance–Novelty axes, and are colored according to the top hierarchical Disease Ontology term.\n10. The plot, however, remains target-centric. Upon clicking on a point, the disease name and protein name are displayed, with appropriate links to Pharos and DrugCentral (Fig. 72[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0072]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/eb77d038-cf86-4267-ba92-4c406a5bdb05/cpz1355-fig-0072-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 72\nFor the example target Kalirin (KALRN), the most novel association (lowest Importance) is for “X-linked nonsyndromic deafness.” This detailed view includes the full name and family of the target, links to Pharos and DrugCentral, and in this case, the one article responsible for this association between KALRN and X-linked nonsyndromic deafness.\n11. When selecting a target family (e.g., kinase), the user can drill down to the desired level of granularity before examining disease associations for a specific protein. Starting from Kinase, for example, the user must click Protein kinase → CAMK group → TRIO family → Kalirin, before diseases associated with Kalirin (KALRN) are displayed (Fig. 70[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0070]).",
    "12. The top disease (highest Importance, lowest Novelty) associated with KALRN is “disease by infectious agent,” followed by “psychotic disorder.” We recommend repeated scrolling before identifying a leaf term corresponding to the Disease Ontology (see Internet Resources). For example, next to “psychotic disorder” is “schizophrenia” (a child term); this association is supported by 26 publications, including Miller et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0039]). The most novel association (lowest Importance) is for “X-linked nonsyndromic deafness” (Fig. 72[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0072]), supported by Cai et al. (2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0010]). This association is genuine, as the gene name (KALRN) is mentioned in the abstract, in relation to the rs333332 SNP.\nSharing and downloading data\n13. Whether in “Browse Diseases” or “Browse Targets” mode, the user can share data in two ways. First, for any given plot, the specific URL (universal resource locator) for that visualization can be copied and shared with third-party users. This can be done by clicking on the “Share” button. Second, the data can be exported (in comma-separated value format), and thus archived or post-processed with third-party software. Exported data includes Novelty and Importance scores, in addition to Disease names and identifiers in the “Browse Targets” mode, as well as Target names and identifiers in the “Browse Diseases” mode, respectively.",
    "DrugCentral is an online compendium (Ursu et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0057]) centered on “active pharmaceutical ingredients” and their link to “pharmaceutical products.” DrugCentral distills relevant information from “pharmaceutical product” (or formulation) package inserts; while these are frequently referred to as “drugs” by patients and medical practitioners, herein we reserve the term “drugs” for “active pharmaceutical ingredients.” All data, including downloads, related to DrugCentral can be accessed at its designated web portal (https://drugcentral.org/[href=https://drugcentral.org/]).

DrugCentral is current (as of the date of the release) with regulatory approvals from the United States (US FDA), the European Union (EMA), Japan (PDMA) and, more recently, some drugs approved in China and Russia. Limited information on drugs that have been discontinued or withdrawn is available, particularly for drugs approved outside the U.S. when package inserts and relevant information are not in English.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a 100 Mbps or higher (fast) Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nQueries supported by DrugCentral\n1. Navigate to the DrugCentral portal (https://drugcentral.org/[href=https://drugcentral.org/]).\n2. The main DrugCentral search bar supports three types of queries: drug, target, and disease. Each of these will filter and prioritize results according to a four-level ranking system ordered from highest to lowest, as follows:\n         \nQuery term matching drug name (or synonyms) mechanism of action target, or drug indication (see below).",
    "Query term matching disease term in drug contraindications or off-label uses, targets listed in drug bioactivity profiles (not MoA targets), or pharmacologic action descriptions.\nQuery term matching the short drug description text.\nQuery term matching full text in the FDA drug labels processed from DailyMed (Fig. 73[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0073]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/50b941d8-f5be-4315-99fa-9ff5ce217bf8/cpz1355-fig-0073-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 73\nDrugCentral homepage. DrugCentral search bar supports three types of queries: drug, target, and disease.\n3. For example, drug query results are sorted to display active ingredients first (e.g., omeprazole), followed by related ingredients (e.g., esomeprazole) and by other active ingredients that are co-formulated with the queried substance into pharmaceutical products. A query by brand name (e.g., Prilosec) includes other antacids such as sodium bicarbonate, antibiotics such as amoxicillin and clarithromycin (co-prescribed with omeprazole to treat stomach ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori), as well as acetyl-salicylic acid, which is combined with omeprazole for the prevention of stroke. (Fig. 74[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0074])\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e071e781-de44-434f-9216-bb6561d361d3/cpz1355-fig-0074-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 74\nDrugCentral search results for “Omeprazole” first lists drugs indicated for “Omeprazole” (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) followed by drugs indicated in complications.\n4. Disease names are mappable to multiple terminologies such as Disease Ontology, MeSH, SNOMED-CT, and MedDRA. Disease term queries first retrieve indications, followed by off-label and contraindications, then other sections (e.g., side effects) that contain medical/disease terms. For example, the query “Parkinson's disease” (PD) first lists drugs indicated for PD (e.g., ropinirole), followed by drugs indicated in complications of PD (e.g., fludrocortisone is indicated for the PD-associated orthostatic hypotension), then by drugs that list PD as side-effect (e.g., dimenhydrinate) (Fig. 75[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0075]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/45b8e384-2337-4fbc-93c7-1ed2abb93cfb/cpz1355-fig-0075-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 75\nDrugcentral query result for “Parkinson's disease” (PD) first lists drugs indicated for PD (e.g., ropinirole), followed by drugs indicated in complications of PD (e.g., fludrocortisone is indicated for the PD-associated orthostatic hypotension), then by drugs that list PD as side-effect (e.g., dimenhydrinate).",
    "5. Target name queries support input as text (e.g., “muscarinic m1”), gene symbol (CHRM1), or UniProt (P11229) and SwissProt (ACM1_HUMAN) identifiers. It is recommended to use the exact target names adopted by UniProt, though gene/protein identifiers are preferred.\nQueries supported by DrugCentral: REDIAL\n6. Given its basic science focus, the machine-learning-based REDIAL-2020 platform (KC et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0024]), which is also part of DrugCentral, supports queries by drug name (e.g., omeprazole), by PubChem compound identifier (e.g., 4594), or by chemical structure in the SMILES (Weininger, 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0061]) format (e.g., COc1ccc2nc(S(=O)Cc3ncc(C)c(OC)c3C)[nH]c2c1). Regardless of format, all input queries for REDIAL-2020 are converted to SMILES format in order to predict anti-viral properties (Fig. 76[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0076]).\nAlso see Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-prot-0008].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e77e6bc0-2069-4b6b-973a-72ef6f863bc8/cpz1355-fig-0076-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 76\nDrugCentral REDIAL query result for Omeprazole. All input queries for REDIAL-2020 are converted to SMILES format in order to predict anti-viral properties.\nQueries supported by DrugCentral: L1000\n7. The other search interface available in DrugCentral, implemented in R-Shiny (https://shiny.rstudio.com/[href=https://shiny.rstudio.com/]), supports browsing and searching for drug names for which gene perturbation profiles were recorded across one more of the 81 cell lines collected during the LINCS (Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures) project. Based on the L1000 perturbation profiles for 1613 drugs, the L1000 DrugCentral app allows users to query (via drug names) which drugs have the most similar gene perturbation profiles, ranked by cell lines (Fig. 77[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0077]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7766546c-7c41-4f0f-898c-f06f9f939591/cpz1355-fig-0077-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 77\nThe L1000 search input home page. The L1000 DrugCentral app allows users to query (via drug names) which drugs have the most similar gene perturbation profiles, ranked by cell lines.\nDrugCentral Drugcards: A step-by-step content guide",
    "8. At its core, DrugCentral is a drug-centric resource. Thus, all queries are likely to provide information that is displayed in the form of “drug cards.” Data elements identified when searching a drug by name would be thus retrieved in a similar manner when searching by target or by disease, as both queries result in lists of drug cards.\n9. Each drug card can be directly accessed (linked out) by observing the following (specific) format:\nhttps://drugcentral.org/drugcard/<DrugcentralStruct.ID>\nwhere “DrugcentralStruct.ID” is the DrugCentral structure ID number. For example, DrugcentralStruct.ID=824 resolves to dexamethasone. This manner of mining drug cards is not intended for casual users. Rather, this format is intended for programmatic access to DrugCentral content (Fig. 78[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0078]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8154b846-deb4-4a1b-962a-ba3a09c7d642/cpz1355-fig-0078-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 78\nDrugCentral Accession “DrugcentralStruct.ID” for cross referencing DrugCentral drug cards.\n10. What follows is a “section by section” guide to drug card content, shown by section title. These are not intended as comprehensive explanations, but rather as brief illustrations of the diverse content available through DrugCentral.\n11. “Stem definition” displays International Nonproprietary Names (INN), which are associated with “pharmacologically related groups”; that section also displays Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) registry numbers, in addition to DrugCentral IDs.\n12. “Description” depicts the two-dimensional chemical structure (as well as three separate chemical structure file formats), a number of synonyms, and computed chemical descriptors such as Lipinski's “rule of 5” (Lipinski et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0035]). The intellectual property/regulatory status of the drug (if available) is also shown under “Status,” with one of three options—OFP: off patent; OFM: off market; and ONP; on patent—respectively (Avram, Curpan, Halip, Bora, & Oprea, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0004]).\n13. “Drug dosage” provides a sample (typically, the “maximum dose strength”) of the dosages available for oral/non-oral formulations of the drug.",
    "14. “ADMET Properties” (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) provides experimental ADMET values, when available. These properties are half-life, systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state and fraction unbound, all intravenous pharmacokinetic parameters (Lombardo, Berellini, & Obach, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0036]), the fraction excreted unchanged in urine (extent of metabolism), water solubility, and their composite parameter BDDCS (Biopharmaceutical Drug Disposition Classification System), as discussed elsewhere (Benet, Broccatelli, & Oprea, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0006]), and MRTD, Maximum Recommended Therapeutic Daily Dose (Contrera, Matthews, Kruhlak, & Benz, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0013]).\n15. “Approvals” shows the date of approval by regulatory agencies (if available).\n16. “FDA adverse event reporting system (Female),” followed by “FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (Male)” lists adverse events, separated by sex, in the decreasing order of the likelihood ratio (Huang, Zalkikar, & Tiwari, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0020]).\n17. “Pharmacologic action” highlights the drug annotations corresponding to (sometimes multiple) ATC (Anatomical, Therapeutic, and Chemical) classification system codes available at WHOCC (see Internet Resources); chemical ontology information from ChEBI (EBI Web Team; see Internet Resources); and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings; see Internet Resources) terms from the MeSH Browser.\n18. “Drug use” lists indications, off-label use, and contra-indications, mapped to SNOMED-CT (Bhattacharyya, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0008]) and DOID (Disease Ontology: Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland), where available. Drug indications and contra-indications are mined from package inserts (drug labels), whereas off-label uses are from literature.\n19. “Acid dissociation constants calculated using MoKa v3.0.0” shows calculated acid/base dissociation constants, as calculated with the MoKa software (Milletti et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0040]).\n20. “Orange Book patent data (new drug applications)” and “Orange Book exclusivity data (new drug applications)” complement DrugCentral information on marketed pharmaceutical formulations by adding FDA Orange Book (Orange Book: Approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations; see Internet Resources) for patents, as well as exclusivity data, for new drug applications.",
    "21. “Bioactivity Summary” distills information from multiple bioactivity databases, e.g., ChEMBL (Mendez et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0038]) and the IUPHAR Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0002]), in addition to scientific literature and information from drug labels. Numeric information is converted to the negative log molar of the effective drug concentration at measurement. Mechanism-of-action drug targets (Santos et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0047]) are marked separately.\n22. The “External reference” section contains drug identifiers used by other on-line resources. This section includes identifiers used in medical practice, such as the Veterans Health Administration (e.g., VHA unique identifier, VUID), the National Drug File reference terminology (NDFRT; see Internet Resources) and RxNorm (see Internet Resources), as well as identifiers used by PubChem, ChEBI, DrugBank, etc.\n23. Last but not least, the “Pharmaceutical products” section provides direct links to DailyMed (https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/[href=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/]), while incorporating simple meta-data descriptors such as “category” (e.g., prescription vs. over-the-counter), number of ingredients, administration route, etc. This section also includes a clickable container that captures the full text (no images) of the FDA approved package insert.\nDrugCentral Target Cards: A step-by-step content guide\n24. In Addition to DrugCentral's Drugcards, a set of Target Cards can be directly accessed by observing the following (URL) syntax:\n         \nhttps://drugcentral.org/target/≤UniprotAccession.ID>\n25. For example, https://drugcentral.org/target/P23975/[href=https://drugcentral.org/target/P23975/] resolves to Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter. This method of mining Target Cards is not intended for casual users. Rather, this format is intended for programmatic access to machine readable Target metadata (Fig. 79[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0079]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e8a10993-d25d-4f7e-be74-c71b9e0f91b3/cpz1355-fig-0079-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 79\nDrugCentral's Target Card.

    "There is currently an urgent need to find effective drugs for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DrugCentral REDIAL-2020 (KC et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0025]) is a suite of machine learning models that forecast activities for live viral infectivity, viral entry, and viral replication specifically for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in vitro infectivity, and human cell toxicity. This application serves the scientific community when prioritizing compounds for in vitro screening and may ultimately accelerate identifying novel drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment. REDIAL-2020 consists of eleven independently trained machine learning models using high-throughput screening data from the NCATS COVID19 portal (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/index.html[href=https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/index.html]) and includes a similarity search module that queries the underlying experimental dataset for similar compounds. These models were developed using experimental data generated by the following assays: the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (CPE) assay and its host cell cytotoxicity counterscreen; the Spike–ACE2 protein–protein interaction (AlphaLISA) assay and its TruHit counterscreen, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzymatic activity assay; the 3C-like (3CL) proteinase enzymatic activity assay; the SARS-CoV pseudotyped particle entry (CoV-PPE) assay and its counterscreen (CoV-PPE_cs); the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pseudotyped particle entry assay (MERS-PPE) and its counterscreen (MERS-PPE_cs); and the human fibroblast toxicity (hCYTOX) assay (Fig. 81[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0081]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/002b575c-3421-45c5-87f9-54f41b60d7fe/cpz1355-fig-0081-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 81\nREDIAL Home page with Search SMILES, drug names, and PubChem CIDs enabled.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a 100 Mbps or higher (fast) Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nREDIAL: A step-by-step content guide\n1.

The user interface provides a summary of the models, such as model type, which descriptor categories were used for training, and the evaluation scores.\n4. The user interface depicts the processes of cleaning the chemical structures (encoded as SMILES) before training the machine learning models (Fig. 82[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0082]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6d2dc644-c481-4b7b-af3a-87a0046cdb43/cpz1355-fig-0082-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 82\nREDIAL interface provides a summary of the models, such as model type, which descriptor categories were used for training, and the evaluation scores.

As an example, amodiaquine has been shown to have promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 behavior in several papers (Bocci et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0009]; Si et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0051]), but its mechanism of action has not been well established yet. When given as an input to REDIAL, the webapp opens a new window with the predicted activities.\n6. The prediction results table shows that amodiaquine is predicted to be active in cytopathic effect experiments, while there are no clues on its mechanism (inactive in AlphaLISA, ACE2, 3CL assays) (Fig. 83[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0083]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c5dc8103-4840-4ddd-b776-7a3265366416/cpz1355-fig-0083-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 83\nREDIAL prediction results table with example search term “amodiaquine.” Amodiaquine is predicted to be active in cytopathic effect experiments while there are no clues on its mechanism (inactive in AlphaLISA, ACE2, and 3CL assays).\n7.

    "Drugmonizome (Kropiwnicki et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0027]) serves processed data extracted from drug and small molecule databases available from a variety of online repositories and data portals. The processed data is provided in the form of drug set libraries which serve as the underlying database for drug set enrichment analysis. Drugmonizome enables users to submit lists of drugs and small molecules as the input query. These drug sets are compared against various drug set libraries that contain known associations between drugs and their attributes, for example, side effects, indications, targets, pathways, induced gene expression signatures, and other attributes. Additionally, Drugmonizome provides options for querying metadata associated with drug sets to find relevant drugs, small molecules, and drug sets for a given free-text query.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nMetadata search\n1.

    "A wealth of data from a multitude of sources is readily available for thousands of bioactive small molecules in Drugmonizome (Kropiwnicki et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0027]). The information in Drugmonizome can be harnessed to develop machine learning models that utilize such data to predict the properties of small molecules that are poorly annotated. The Drugmonizome database draws upon a variety of publicly available resources to label each small molecule by its associations with pathways, protein targets, induced gene expression profiles, chemical features, and other attributes. Drugmonizome-ML is an Appyter (Clarke et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0012]) that executes a machine learning pipeline as a Jupyter notebook using the data curated for creating Drugmonizome. Drugmonizome-ML can be used to make predictions for indications and other attributes such as drug targets or side effects for poorly annotated pre-clinical bioactive small molecules.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nInput dataset selection\n1. Navigate to the Drugmonizome-ML Appyter (https://appyters.maayanlab.cloud/Drugmonizome_ML/[href=https://appyters.maayanlab.cloud/Drugmonizome_ML/]). The input form is divided into three sections: input dataset selection, target label selection, and machine learning pipeline.\n2. Select datasets from Drugmonizome and SEP-L1000 (Kropiwnicki et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0027]; Wang, Clark, & Ma'ayan, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0060]) to populate the feature matrix that will be used for learning and classification. Each of the datasets’ contents are described using tooltips (Fig. 96[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0096]). For the demonstration, select the “LINCS Gene Expression Signatures” from the “Transcriptomic and Imaging Datasets” subfield and “Morgan Fingerprints” from the “Chemical Fingerprints Generated for Compounds from SEP-L1000” subfield.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6bf8a115-3720-426f-b6f1-88fdc84ec0d7/cpz1355-fig-0096-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 96\nInput dataset selection section of the Drugmonizome-ML Appyter. Each input dataset is annotated with tooltips.",
    "3. Additional options for pre-processing the feature matrix are available. If selecting features from various data sources, it is likely that not all compounds will be included across all feature sets; therefore, a toggleable option decides whether drugs with missing data are retained or dropped from the feature matrix. Additionally, because some of the available feature sets are binary association matrices, there is the option to apply TF-IDF normalization to account for frequency of common and rare features among the small molecules (Fig. 97[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0097]). In general, the default settings for these options are recommended.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/148822d4-d800-47e5-9166-ea1b56c03873/cpz1355-fig-0097-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 97\nToggleable options for deciding whether to retain or drop drugs with missing data and TF-IDF normalization.\nTarget label selection\n4. In this section, select the positive class label for a binary classification problem. There is the option to select an attribute from any of the Drugmonizome drug set libraries in an autocomplete field where relevant drug-set labels from Drugmonizome are offered as potential class labels (Fig. 98[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0098]). Type any characters into the autocomplete field and matching drug-set labels will be displayed. For the demonstration, type “neuropathy peripheral (from SIDER Side Effects)” into the autocomplete field.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b26f2b43-551d-422a-a3b1-ef2d0e81837a/cpz1355-fig-0098-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 98\nTarget label selection with “Attribute” selected. The autocomplete field can be populated with search terms that match to drug-set labels in Drugmonizome which will be used as the positive class to predict.\n5. Alternatively, upload a newline-separated .txt file of compounds to be used as positive examples of a class to predict by selecting the “List” option in the “Target Label Selection” section. Example .txt files are available for download to understand the structure of the file (Fig. 99[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0099]). Choose the drug identifier format (drug name or InChI key in which small molecules within the text file are described. InChI Keys are the recommended format.",
    "<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d2770c40-4ad4-4b31-8243-9174f4b4ee08/cpz1355-fig-0099-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 99\nTarget label selection with “List” selected. Newline-separated .txt files can be uploaded with small molecules that are part of a positive class to predict. The drug identifier format drop-down menu allows specification of how small molecules are cataloged within the uploaded file (names or InChI key).\n6. The “Include stereoisomers” option decides whether to match compounds from the feature matrix to the target vector using the first 14 characters of the InChIKey (which encodes chemical connectivity), thus including stereoisomers of a particular small molecule, or whether to consider only one form of a molecule and match by the whole InChIKey.\nMachine learning pipeline\n7. In this section, select data visualization options, machine learning classifiers, machine learning hyperparameters, and methods to evaluate the classifier (Fig. 100[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0100]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2b6f3de0-ca0f-4cd1-84ec-9ac50f8c9388/cpz1355-fig-0100-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 100\nMachine learning pipeline section with methods for data visualization, machine learning classifier selection, hyperparameter settings, and metrics to evaluate the classifier.\n8. Select your preferred data visualization method from the drop-down menu under the “Data Visualization Method” field. The default and recommended method is UMAP.\n9. If applicable, select a dimensionality-reduction algorithm from the drop-down menu under the “Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm” field.\n10. If applicable, select a feature-selection method from the drop-down menu under the “Machine Learning Feature Selection” field.\n11. The “Machine Learning Algorithm” section includes 9 distinct classifiers that can be chosen by clicking on the corresponding classifier name. Furthermore, each classifier has hyperparameter fields that can be modified. For example, select the “Extra Trees classifier”. Input “1250” in the “n_estimators” field. Select “entropy” in the “criterion” drop-down menu. Select “log2” in the “max_features” drop-down menu. All other hyperparameters can be kept as default.",
    "12. Select whether to calibrate algorithm predictions by selecting the appropriate choice in the “Calibrate algorithm predictions” field. This setting will calibrate the predictions output by the chosen model, eliminating model-imparted bias. It is recommended to keep this setting as default.\n13. Select a cross-validation method from the drop-down menu under the “Cross-Validation Algorithm” field. The recommended option is Repeated Stratified Group K-Fold because this cross-validation method will maintain class ratios across train and validation splits. Furthermore, choose the number of cross-validation folds and cross-validation repetitions in the subsequent fields. For the demonstration, input “10” into the “Number of Cross-Validation Folds” field and “3” into the “Number of Cross-Validated Repetitions” field.\n14. Choose the primary evaluation metric for assessing the performance of the model from the drop-down menu under the “Primary Evaluation Metric” field. The default and recommended metric is “roc_auc”.\n15. Choose any additional evaluation metrics from the drop-down menu under the “Evaluation Metrics” field, and these metrics will also be reported for the trained model.\n16. Click “Submit” at the bottom of the input form.\nNavigating the Drugmonizome-ML Appyter Notebook\n17. A Jupyter Notebook will begin executing in the cloud once the input form is submitted.

Using the processed data from Harmonizome, Harmonizome-ML enables interactive imputation of knowledge about the function and other properties of genes and proteins using machine learning. Combined with the user-friendly interface of an Appyter (Clarke et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0012])–a web-based software application enabling users to execute bioinformatics workflows without coding–the Harmonizome-ML Appyter can be used to build and evaluate machine learning pipelines with Harmonizome data in an accessible way. The Harmonizome-ML Appyter asks users to select or upload attributes for learning as well as specify a target vector to predict. Users also need to select from various machine learning algorithms and performance evaluation methods. Once these options are selected, the workflow is executed, and the results are presented as a Jupyter Notebook that is shareable and downloadable.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nNavigating the input page\n1.

Similarly, TIGA can score and rank traits with the same gene-trait association metrics. Rather than a comprehensive analysis of GWAS for all biological implications and insights, this focused application provides a rational method by which GWAS findings can be aggregated and filtered for applicable, actionable intelligence, with evidence usable by drug discovery scientists to enrich prioritization of target hypotheses. TIGA derives its GWAS summary and metadata solely from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog and study-associated publications.

To infer upstream kinases, KEA3 uses a collection of kinase-substrate libraries created from processing data from several online databases. Kinase enrichment analysis results are provided for each kinase-substrate library, as well as two integrated approaches to integrate all libraries: MeanRank and TopRank. The gene sets from the kinase-substrate libraries are compared to the user-inputted protein list, and Fisher's Exact Test is used to compute the significance of the overlap to prioritize kinases. The resulting ranked lists of kinases, as well as visualizations of the significant kinases as networks, are returned to the users as interactive and downloadable figures.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nNOTE: There is a tutorial on navigating KEA3 results (https://maayanlab.cloud/kea3/templates/tutorial.jsp[href=https://maayanlab.cloud/kea3/templates/tutorial.jsp]) from which some of the steps in this protocol have been paraphrased.\nSubmitting a gene set to KEA3\n1.

    "PubMed contains millions of publications that co-mention drugs with other biomedical terms such as genes or diseases. DrugShot is an Appyter (Clarke et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-bib-0012]) that enables users to enter any biomedical search term into an input form to receive ranked lists of drugs and small molecules based on their relevance to the search term. DrugShot then deploys a Jupyter Notebook in the cloud to display ranked lists of drugs. To achieve this, DrugShot cross-references returned PubMed IDs with DrugRIF, a curated resource of drug-PMID associations, to produce an associated compound list where each compound is ranked according to the total co-mentions with the search term from shared PubMed IDs. Additionally, lists of compounds predicted to be associated with the search term are generated based on drug-drug co-occurrence in the literature, and drug-drug co-expression correlations computed from L1000 drug-induced gene expression profiles. Through its search functionality and abstraction of drug sets from different sources, DrugShot facilitates hypothesis generation by suggesting small molecules related to any searched biomedical term.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDesktop or a laptop computer, or a mobile device, with a fast Internet connection\nSoftware\nAn up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/[href=https://www.google.com/chrome/]), Mozilla Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/[href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/]), Apple Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/[href=https://www.apple.com/safari/]), or Microsoft Edge (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge[href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge])\nQuery biomedical term\n1. Navigate to the DrugShot Appyter (https://appyters.maayanlab.cloud/DrugShot/[href=https://appyters.maayanlab.cloud/DrugShot/]). The Appyter input form includes options to query a biomedical term to retrieve a prioritized list of small molecules that is augmented using drug-drug similarity matrices, or to submit a list of small molecules to be augmented using drug-drug similarity matrices.",
    "2. Input a biomedical term into the “Biomedical Term” field. The default string used for this demonstration is “Lung Cancer.” Input an integer ranging from 20 to 200 in the “Associated Drug Set Size” field; this value is used to determine the size of the unweighted drug set that is used to predict related compounds. The larger the value selected, the broader the resulting predictions will be (Fig. 132[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0132]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/60c1c7c0-a6f9-4cae-acb4-ea9b15837569/cpz1355-fig-0132-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 132\nBiomedical Term input form with “Lung Cancer” input in the Biomedical Term field. The associated drug set size is 50; therefore, the unweighted drug set will include 50 small molecules.\n3. Click submit on the Appyter input form and a Jupyter Notebook with the input parameters will be launched in the cloud.\n4. The first output element of the notebook is a table of “Top Associated Compounds” (Fig. 133[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0133]). This table provides the top-ranked drug and compound names associated with the query term (Index Column), the count of PubMed publications associating each drug with the search term (Column 1), and the fraction of the publications associating the drug and search term divided by the total number of publications related to the drug regardless of search term (Column 2). Click on the hyperlinked filename below the table title to download a .csv file listing all the associated compounds. This file also includes a Score column containing values that are the product of the first two columns.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6cff2a89-28b8-4e76-a3d8-655fcb421b4d/cpz1355-fig-0133-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 133\nTable of Top 20 Associated Compounds.

    "5. The second output component of this notebook is a scatter plot (Fig. 134[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0134]) of the values from the table of “Top Associated Compounds.” The x axis displays the integer counts of Publications with Search Term, and the y axis shows the fraction of Publications with Search Term/Total Publications. Hover over any point on this plot to display the compound's name and its corresponding x and y values.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5a5b31c1-cccc-4edc-b2f3-a63ac345ee10/cpz1355-fig-0134-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 134\nScatter Plot of Drug Frequency in Literature. The x-axis displays the integer counts of Publications with Search Term, and the y-axis shows the fraction of Publications with Search Term/Total Publications. Hovering over any point on this plot displays the compound's name and its corresponding x and y values.\n6. An unweighted drug set is created through ranking small molecules from the association table by the product of the total associated publications and their normalized fraction.\nQuerying a list of small molecules\n7. Alternatively, submit a newline-separated .txt file of small molecule names using the input form, thereby omitting steps 2-6. The submitted small molecules will be used as the unweighted drug set that will be used in subsequent steps (Fig. 135[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0135]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6e8b8599-f9ef-4153-9d4b-95edfa249235/cpz1355-fig-0135-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 135\nList input form where newline-separated .txt files of small molecule names are uploaded for drug set augmentation.\nLiterature co-mentions predictions",
    "8. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that describes the ranking of associated compounds in the DrugRIF literature co-mentions matrix is output (Fig. 136[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355#cpz1355-fig-0136]). This plot shows the True Positive Rate on the y-axis and the False Positive Rate on the x-axis. The predicted compounds are computed using average co-mention counts of PubMed IDs between the unweighted drug set, and other drugs and small molecules within DrugRIF. The area under the curve (AUC) is shown to the right of the plot, and hovering over any point on the curve displays the associated x and y values.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ae57d331-c154-41a0-bb50-1d9b08e4dfcf/cpz1355-fig-0136-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 136\nReceiver operating characteristic curve for rankings of unweighted drug set in co-occurrence matrix.

This plot shows the True Positive Rate on the y-axis and the False Positive Rate on the x-axis. The predicted compounds are computed using average cosine similarity of drug-induced gene expression signatures between the unweighted drug set and other drugs and small molecules within the co-expression prediction matrix.
