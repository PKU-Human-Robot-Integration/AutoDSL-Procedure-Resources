    "1. Microscope Design and Assembly\nExcitation path\n\tNOTE: The excitation path includes lasers, differential interference contrast (DIC) components, the microscope body, and its illumination arm.\n\t\nPrepare a vibration-isolated optical table. For example, a structural damping table of 48 x 96 x 12’’ gives enough space for all the components.\n\t\tNOTE: Build the set-up in a room with temperature control (e.g., 21.4 ± 0.55 °C). Temperature stability is critical to maintaining the optical alignment.\nInstall a microscope body that is equipped with an illumination arm for optical fiber connection, a 100X oil-immersion TIRF objective lens, and DIC components.\nPlace four laser heads (647 nm, 561 nm, 488 nm, and 405 nm, encircled in Figure 1B) and their heat sinks on the optical table, and make sure the emitted laser beams have the same height and are as short as possible to ensure good stability (e.g., 3’’).\n\t\tNOTE: If a laser head sits at a shorter height than other lasers, put an aluminum plate with adequate thickness underneath it. Always ensure maximum contact between the heat sinks and the optical table for the best heat dissipation (Figure 1B). The lasers need to be powerful enough for SR imaging. See Table of Materials. It is recommended to have laser clean-up filters in front of diode lasers.\nInstall a data acquisition card through a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) interface in a workstation and connect lasers with this card. Control the lasers’ ON/OFF behaviors by transistor-transistor logic (TTL) output, and their power adjustment by the analog output of this card (Figure 1C). Install a proper microscopy imaging software (either commercial or homebuilt) to control the data acquisition card, as well as the microscope body.",
    "Mount the mirrors and dichroic beam splitters (590, 525, and 470 long pass filters) to their respective mounts. Use very stable mirror mounts for the mirrors. Use circular splitters with retaining rings to avoid any bending of the dichroic beam splitters (Figure 1D).\nPlace the mirrors and dichroic beam splitters on the optical table to combine the laser beams (Figure 1B). To achieve the most stable alignment, make the whole arrangement as compact as possible, and use 1’’-thickness optical posts. Arrange the lasers so that the shorter wavelength lasers are closer to the optical fiber coupling (Figure 1B) since short-wavelength lights dissipate more in the air.\nCombine laser beams into a single-mode optical fiber. To do so, build a fiber coupler in a cage system through the following steps:\n\t\t\nMount a fiber adapter plate in a z-axis translation mount (Figure 1E, leftmost panel).\nMount an achromatic doublet lens (focal length = 7.5 mm) in a cage plate (Figure 1E, second panel from the left).\nConnect the two parts above by extension rods to form a cage. Mount the cage on the optical table with mounting brackets on the 1’’-thick optical posts (Figure 1E, middle panel).\nAlign the 647-nm laser first with a single-mode optical fiber (FC/APC end to the coupler).\n\t\t\tNOTE: A rough alignment using a multi-mode optical fiber before using the single-mode optical fiber may help the alignment process. Adjust the angles of the mirrors and dichroic beam splitters (Figure 1D, by adjustment knobs), as well as the distance between the achromatic doublet lens and the fiber adapter plate (Figure 1E, by adjusting z-axis translation mount) to gain maximum laser power output through the fiber.",
    "Once the alignment of the first laser is done, temporarily install a pair of irises and align the rest of the lasers one by one (Figure 1F). Check the alignment efficiency with a power meter.\nLeave one iris in the front of the adapter plate to reduce the reflections of the lasers.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Strong back reflections can reduce the lifetime of laser sources. Optionally, an optical isolator can be installed in front of each laser head to remove the reflections completely.\nConnect the other end of the optical fiber to the illumination arm of the microscope (Figure 1H).\nDesign and install the “magnification lens (mag lens)” through the following steps:\n\t\tNOTE: The lasers can be used for epi-fluorescence imaging of the sample, but the narrow beam size of each laser limits the illuminated area of the sample to an area several times smaller than the actual size of the corresponding camera sensor, especially for the newer cameras (with 18.8 mm in diagonal length compared to the conventional 11.6-mm length). Thus, it is desirable to expand the beam to achieve a larger and flatter illumination of the sample.\n\t\t\nDesign the mag lens, which can fit into the illumination arm (Figure 1H).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The design of the mag lens depends on where it will be installed. Figure 1H shows an example of the installation in the illumination arm, but it can be installed in any spot after the laser beams are collimated (see Discussion). Design it with a computer-aided design and drafting software.",
    "Place two achromatic lenses, one concave (focal length = f1), and one convex (focal length = f2) in the home-made mag lens holder (Figure 2A and 2C), with the distance equal to the sum of their focal lengths, f1 + f2 = (-25) + 50 = 25 mm (Figure 2B).\n\t\t\tNOTE: With this choice of focal lengths, the mag lens expands the beam by f2/|f1| = 2 folds. The mag lens provides versatility. It can be removed to resume regular illumination without expanding the beams (Figure 2D) or inserted in the reverse direction to focus the laser beam to achieve a stronger excitation intensity.\n2. Emission path\nNOTE: The emission path is composed of a removable cylindrical lens, a barrier filter wheel, an emission splitter, and an EMCCD camera (Figure 1G). To attain the best point spread function (PSF) of single molecules, the DIC prism is put away from the objective lens.\nCustom-design the cylindrical lens (3-D lens) cassette, which can fit into the manual DIC analyzer insert slot in the microscope body (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: This design does not compromise the DIC analyzer since an analyzer block can be inserted in the filter turret.\nPlace the 3-D lens of 10 m of focal length in the cassette and insert it into the emission beam path to create the astigmatism effect necessary for extracting the z coordinate of every single molecule14.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, the 3-D lens cassette can be placed in or out of the emission path (Figure 3C).\nInstall a multi-band dichroic beam splitter in the filter turret inside of the microscope body.\nInstall emission filters.\n\tNOTE: The emission filters are chosen depending on the preferred fluorophores. Depending on the imaging module, emission filters placed in different locations are used as described below:",
    "For sequential multi-color epi-fluorescence imaging or SR imaging, use emission filters placed in the barrier filter wheel connected next to the microscope body to minimize the vibration in the microscope body during channel switch (Figure 1G).\nFor simultaneous multi-color detection (e.g., smFRET experiments), place another filter set in an emission splitter (check step 4 for details).\n\t\tNOTE: Usually, a commercial emission splitter has two switchable modes (i.e., “engaged” or “bypass” modes). To separate emission lights chromatically for simultaneous multi-color imaging (“engaged” mode), a filter cube holding two dichroic beam splitters and three emission filters is used (“triple cube,” Figure 4C and 4D). An empty slot in the barrier filter wheel is used in combination with the triple cube. On the other hand, for sequential multi-color imaging, the triple cube is replaced by a cube that just has a mirror inside (“bypass cube,” Figure 4A and 4D).\nInstall the EMCCD camera as the last part of the emission path. Utilize the USB-PCI connection to achieve a fast frame rate.\n\tNOTE: An EMCCD camera is recommended for the most sensitive single-molecule detection, but an advanced sCMOS camera can be an alternative.\n3. Diffraction-limited Imaging with Epi-excitation\nAdjust the excitation lasers’ incidental angle to epi-mode in the illumination arm.\nDisengage the 3-D lens if engaged (Figure 3C, right panel).\nInsert the bypass cube in the emission splitter (Figure 4A and 4E, bottom panel).\n(Optional) Insert the mag lens for a broadened illumination area (Figure 2D, left panel).\n\tNOTE: With the use of a mag lens and a 100X oil-immersion objective lens, about 91 x 91 µm2 can be illuminated evenly, eliminating the need to use a white light source and multiple filter cubes.\nUse a microscopy imaging software to take multi-channel, and/or Z-stack, and/or time-lapse images.",
    "NOTE: There are multiple programs available for microscopy imaging, not only from microscope manufacturers but also from third-party companies or open source developers.\n4. Multi-channel Single-molecule Imaging Including smFRET\nNOTE: Move to an “empty” position in the barrier filter wheel, so that all the emission with any wavelength can reach to the second set of filters/dichroic beam splitters in the emission splitter.\nTo set up multi-color single-molecule detection of surface-immobilized molecules15 using TIRF excitation, including smFRET measurement, adjust the excitation lasers’ incidental angle to the TIRF angle. Disengage the mag lens and the 3-D lens.\nEngage the three-channel mode in the emission splitter (Figure 1G) through the following steps:\n\t\nReplace the bypass cube with a “calibration cube” that allows light to go through all channels (Figure 4B and 4E).\nTurn on the camera under DIC (i.e., no emission filter in the barrier filter wheel) and adjust the aperture of the emission splitter until three fully separated channels appear on the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: Conduct this step with the room light lit, to visualize all the channels.\nTurn the vertical/horizontal adjustment control knobs on the emission splitter and roughly align the three channels (Figure 4E and 4F).\nTurn off the camera and replace the calibration cube with a triple cube (Figure 4C and 4E).\nPlace a sample with 100-nm multichannel beads on top of the 100X objective lens and focus on the sample.\nTurn on the camera and the 488-nm laser, zoom in on one of the bright beads, and finely align the three channels by turning the adjustment control knobs again (Figure 4E and 4G).\n\t\tNOTE: 100-nm multichannel beads emit different wavelengths of light upon 488-nm excitation, enabling the three-channel alignment.",
    "Turn on the camera and lasers, focus, and find a good position with a reasonable spot density. Adjust the laser power and exposure time to achieve acceptable signal-to-noise and photobleaching levels. Use the microscopy imaging software to take time-lapse images.\n5. SR Imaging\nNOTE: This is single-molecule detection-based SR microscopy.\nTo set up SR imaging, insert the 3-D lens and remove the mag lens. Set the exposure time of the camera in the appropriate laser channels (e.g., 5 - 60 ms). Determine and manually set the optimal excitation lasers’ incidental angle to be the TIRF angle.\nPlace the sample in SR imaging buffer16. Allow the buffer to equilibrate for at least 10 min before imaging.\n\tNOTE: SR imaging buffer expires after roughly 1 h, so make new SR imaging buffer accordingly.\nTake a DIC image before SR imaging. In order to find the proper objective height for SR, which optimizes the astigmatism effect, use DIC imaging to find the middle plane of the cells. Identify the plane by the height at which the cells transition from “light” to “dark” images and appear to become transparent (Figure 5A, 5B, and 5C). Once the desired focal plane is determined, engage the z-drift correction system (Figure 1A).\nConduct SR imaging. Change the 405-nm laser power to maintain a reasonable density of ‘blinking-on’ spots.\n\tNOTE: While it is possible to change the 405-nm laser manually, it is more convenient to run a programmed data acquisition code to maintain the density of “blinking-on” spots. Here is an example of how it is conducted automatically. The source code is available upon request (Figure 6).\n\t\nStart the imaging acquisition with 0 W/cm2 violet laser power.\nCount the number of blinking-on spots in a certain period.",
    "Modulate the violet laser power so that the number of blinking-on spots is kept above a user-defined “counting threshold” in the field of view. Increase the violet laser power when the number of blinking-on spots drops below the counting threshold.\nTerminate the acquisition when the number of blinking-on spots drops below the counting threshold using the maximum violet laser power.\n\t\tNOTE: The maximum can be set differently depending on the sample brightness, but no higher than 130 W/cm2. Depending on the actual goal of the SR imaging, this automatic acquisition code can be manually terminated at any desired point.\nCheck the blinking behavior and PSFs of the spots soon after beginning the acquisition.\n\tNOTE: If the blinking behavior is not ideal, change the excitation lasers’ incidental angle or replace the imaging buffer. Expect a sampling of “vertical”, “horizontal”, and “diamond” shapes of PSF, representing fluorophores from below, above, and within the focal plane, respectively (Figure 5D). If most spots show either vertical or horizontal PSFs, then the focal plane is off from the center of the cells, so terminate the experiment and adjust the focal plane again. A presence of air bubble in the immersion oil or other local factors can affect the PSFs’ quality, so it may be necessary to replace the oil or change to a different imaging area of the sample.\nFor the data analysis, use either open source (in NIH ImageJ plugins) or commercially available codes to detect centroids of each spot in each imaging frame and extract z-values of each spot from x- and y-widths14.\n\tNOTE: In this report, a source code originally developed in one of the earliest single-molecule detection-based SR8 was modified for 3-D detection16 and was used.",
    "In the case of two-color imaging, image the fluorophore with the longer excitation wavelength, followed by the one with the shorter excitation wavelength. Run the automated acquisition code similarly to the one described in step 5.4, but with a different imaging laser.\n\tNOTE: Chromatic aberration should be corrected between images with different fluorophores (e.g., red dye and yellow-green dye). Here are the steps.\n\t\nImmobilize multiple 100-nm multichannel beads on the glass coverslip, avoiding forming clusters.\nTake images of them in different excitation channels.\nExtract their (X, Y, Z) coordinates by software (step 5.6).\nPlot ΔXi = X1i - X2i and ΔYi = Y1i - Y2i (i is for different beads, and 1 and 2 are different color channels) separately and fit them with proper functions. Save the functions.\n\t\tNOTE: Linear functions are sufficient in most cases. Once these functions are determined, this measurement does not have to be repeated each time of imaging.\nIn the actual two-color SR imaging of a sample of interest, apply the functions to correct (X, Y) chromatic aberration. For z-directional chromatic aberration, conduct it by obtaining ΔZ = Z1 - Z2 for multichannel beads or known reference multichannel samples seeded together with the sample of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: Unlike (X, Y) chromatic aberration, z-directional chromatic aberration is not well-reproducible in each experiment, mainly due to incomplete z-directional focus maintenance upon channel switching. Thus, it is recommended to conduct the correction each time. ΔZ = Z1 - Z2 is mostly independent of (X, Y), so just a few beads or reference samples would be sufficient per each sample area of interest. Plot the constructed final two-color SR images in a 3-D visualization software and check ΔZ manually.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
