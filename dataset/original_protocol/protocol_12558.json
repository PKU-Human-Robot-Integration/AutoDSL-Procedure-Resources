    "This study was approved by the National Institute for Medical Research Development and the Research Ethics Review Committee, No. 958680. Lentiviruses are classified as BSL-2 organisms; hence, all laboratory culture procedures in this protocol were carried out using sterile laboratory practices and conducted under a laminar flow hood according to NIH guidelines. Figure 1 demonstrates a schematic presentation of the study protocol for the different E. granulosus stages.\n1. Collecting hydatid cysts\nCollect liver hydatid cysts from naturally infected sheep routinely slaughtered at an abattoir.\nCompletely sterilize the cyst surface using sterile gauze and 70% alcohol before aspirating the protoscoleces (PSCs).\nAspirate 20-50 mL of hydatid fluid out into sterile 50 mL conical tubes.\nAfter draining, blot out the cyst with a sharp blade, transfer the germinal layer into a sterile 50 mL conical tube, and shake it for a short period (~2 min) to increase the collection of PSCs. Transfer the germinal layer to a new 1.5 mL tube for molecular characterization.\nWash the PSCs 3-5x with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nObserve the PSCs in 0.1% eosin for 5 min to determine the PSC viability under a light microscope. Use PSCs with at least 95% viability for culture.\nTreat the PSC precipitate with 2 mL of pepsin (2 mg/mL, pH 2) for 15-20 min.\nTo isolate individual PSCs, resuspend the PSC sediment in PBS and pass it through two layers of sterile gauze into a new sterile 50 mL conical tube.\n\tNOTE: Calculate the average of three counts on 50 µL of PSC sediments using a light microscope. For subsequent trials, use the estimated value to determine PSCs/µL. Each hydatid cyst isolate should be characterized based on nucleotide polymorphisms by molecular methods, such as PCR-sequencing17 or high-resolution melting curve analysis18.",
    "2. Biphasic cultivation of PSCs of E. granulosus to obtain adult worms\nNOTE: Isolated PSCs should be cultured in sterile conditions under a laminar flow cabinet Class II. Prepare the solid and liquid phases of the biphasic culture medium separately before proceeding to the next steps19.\nPrepare the biphasic culture medium to consist of two phases.\n\t\nFor the solid phase, add 10 mL of bovine serum to a 25 mL flask and leave it to coagulate at 76 °C for 20-30 min.\nFor the liquid phase (modified CMRL), mix 100 mL of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 36 mL of 5% yeast extract, 5.6 mL of 30% glucose (in distilled water), 1.4 mL of 5% dog bile in PBS, 20 mM HEPES buffer, and 10 mM NaHCO3 in 260 mL of CMRL-1066 medium. Finally, add penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) to the mixture.\nAdd 10 mL of the liquid phase medium to each 25 cm2 culture flask.\nAdd ~5,000 PSCs to the culture flask and transfer the flask to the CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nAfter 24-48 h, transfer the PSCs to a new flask with the solid phase (bovine serum) and add 1 mL of the same fresh liquid phase medium per flask. Transfer the flasks into the CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nEvery 5-7 days, replace the medium with fresh liquid phase medium based on changes in the color of the culture medium and the estimated proportion of differentiated PSCs.\n\tNOTE: Protoscoleces respond quickly to environmental changes after being cultured, and most of them undergo differentiation within 2-3 weeks. Due to the consumption of nutrients and protoscoleces' growth and development, the pH of the culture medium changes, and its color shifts toward orange and yellow.\n3. Monophasic cultivation of PSCs of E. granulosus",
    "Ensure that monophasic cultivation is done 24-48 h before transduction.\n\t\nCulture ~5,000 PSCs in a 25 cm2 culture flask with RPMI and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nTransfer the flasks into the CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) until use.\n4. Cell culture for virus production and preparation\nNOTE: Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were obtained for vector production from the Pathology and Stem Cell Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences.\nTransfer 5 × 105 HEK293T cells to a 25 cm2 flask containing 5 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin.\nIncubate the HEK293T cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passage them in the complete culture medium every 48 h. Finally, use low-passage HEK293T cells for transduction20.\n5. Production and preparation of the virus with the third-generation lentiviral vectors\nNOTE: The lentivirus vector pCDH513b (transfer vector) and PLPII, PLPI, and PMD2G (helper vectors) were used to express the GFP reporter gene. See the Table of Materials and Supplemental Figure S1.\nDay 1:\n\t\nAfter trypsinizing the HEK293T cells21 in 6-well culture plates, seed 7 × 104 cells per well with fresh antibiotic-free DMEM containing 10% FBS.\nUse cells at 50%-60% confluency for transduction by the calcium phosphate method.\nDay 2:\n\t\nReplace the cell culture medium 2-3 h before the experiment with fresh antibiotic-free DMEM containing 2% FBS.\nIn a 1.5 mL tube, mix the third-generation lentiviral plasmids, including 7 µg/µL pCDH513b (transfer vector), 4 µg/µL PLPII, 4 µg/µL PLPI, and 2 µg/µL PMD2G (helper vectors).\nAdd HEPES buffer (0.28 M NaCl, 0.05 M HEPES, and 1.5 mM Na2HPO4; optimal pH range, 7.00-7.28) to the mixture to a volume of 422 µL.\nAdd 16 µL of 1% Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer to the mixture.",
    "Add 62 µL of 2.5 mM calcium chloride to the tubes and mix well.\nAdd 500 µL of 2x HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) to the mixture, drop by drop, within 1-2 min using a Pasteur pipette. Mix gently until a semi-opaque solution is obtained, and incubate the mixture for 20 min at room temperature.\nAdd the mixture to each plate slowly and distribute it with slow circular motions.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and replace the medium after 4-6 h with antibiotic-free DMEM containing 10% FBS.\nDay 3:\n\t\nConfirm successful transient transduction and cell viability using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\nDay 4:\n\t\nHarvest viruses from the culture medium by collecting each well's supernatant and store them at -70 °C until use.\n\t\tNOTE: Harvested lentiviruses could be concentrated and titrated for precise transfection22.\n6. Transient transduction of different stages of E. granulosus with the virus\nDay 1:\n\t\nUse a 12-well culture plate for gene transfer. Culture 5 × 103-5 × 104 HEK293T cells in triplicate, with complete DMEM medium as the internal reference.\nCulture 150 fresh PSCs in triplicate in RPMI and 10% FBS.\nCulture 30 strobilated worms in triplicate in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS.\n\t\tNOTE: All transduction media must be antibiotic-free. Keep three non-treated control wells for HEK293T cells, PSCs, and strobilated worms in the process.\nPrepare a mixture of 1 × 106 viruses with 4 µg/mL transfection reagent (see the Table of Materials) to transduce the HEK293T cells and different stages of the worm.\nAdd the mixture to each plate slowly and distribute it with slow circular motions. Incubate the plates for 4-6 h in a CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Replace the medium for each sample with the same complete culture medium to minimize the toxic effects of the transfection reagent.",
    "Day 2:\n\t\nRepeat steps 6.1.4-6.1.5 to increase the efficiency of transient transduction for the HEK293T cells, PSCs, and strobilated worms.\nIncubate all the plates for 24-48 h in a CO2 incubator with the same culture conditions based on the type of cell media.\nDay 3:\n\t\nCheck whether the transduction is successful by using fluorescence microscopy.\n\t\tNOTE: Consider using further confirmatory assays like PCR/qPCR20,23 or Western blotting24 techniques in the gene transfer procedure.\nSubscription Required.
