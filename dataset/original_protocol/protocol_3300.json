    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation: Islets and exocrine tissue\nTiming: 3 h\nThe first step is euthanasia of mice immediately followed by perfusion of the pancreas with a collagenase solution and then by excision of the pancreas. Afterward, tubes with perfused pancreata are incubated for half an hour in a 37°C water bath followed by filtration steps to separate islets from the exocrine pancreas.\nPreparation of Quenching Buffer and collagenase solution (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nPrepare material prior to euthanasia of the mouse (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3068-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolate islets and exocrine tissue\n(A) Surgical tools for pancreas perfusion: From left to right: Thread, medical clamp, scissors, anatomical forceps pointed and flat, 30 G needle with a 2 mL syringe.\n(B) One short cut using scissors to open the mouse’s abdomen.\n(C) Open the peritoneum using scissors.\n(D) Prepared common bile duct with forceps.\n(E) Knot surrounding the common bile duct (close to the liver).\n(F) Musculus sphincter of Oddi (1) – appears as a bright/whitish dot. Common bile duct (2): Pancreas before perfusion (3).\n(G) Inserted 30 G needle in the musculus sphincter of Oddi (1) and injected collagenase solution into the common bile duct (2). Well-perfused pancreas close to the spleen (3). (see also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n(H) Omentum - between spleen and stomach.\n(I) Perfused pancreas with spleen after removal from the gut and stomach.\n(J) 30 min incubation in the water bath. Metal blocks weigh down the tubes.\n(K) 500 μm strainer: run digested sample through it.\n(L) Unfiltered leftover on top of the strainer in a well-perfused pancreas.\n(M) Unfiltered leftover on top of the strainer in a poorly-perfused pancreas.\n(N) Prepared spacer with a hole in the middle and on the side.",
    "(O) Islets stay on while exocrine tissue is filtering through the 70 μm inverted strainer.\n(P) Submerged strainer in a tissue culture dish with 5 mL of media. Islets stuck to filter are physically liberated moving a pipette tip across the top side of the strainer.\n(Q) Exocrine tissue filtered through a 40 μm strainer and put in a 50 mL falcon tube.\n2 anatomical forceps (flat and pointed).\n1 syringe.\n1 medical clamp.\n30 G needle with an attached 2 mL syringe.\nThread.\nIcebox.\nTissue.\nPerfuse the pancreas with collagenase type IV solution (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1I).\nAdd 2 mL collagenase solution in a 50 mL conical tube. Put the tubes on ice, as well as collagenase solution for in situ perfusion. Prepare one tube for each mouse.\nEuthanize the mouse.\nSpray the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nOpen the mouse with a V-shape cut at the abdomen. Subtract the skin coat by hand. Open the peritoneum with scissors (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nReveal the heart; make a cut in the apex (ventricle - darker part). This step drains the blood out of circulation; soak all blood with tissue paper.\nUse a thread to make a knot surrounding the common bile duct, close to the liver, to avoid collagenase injection into the liver. Use the pointed forceps to free the common bile duct (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E).\nFrom now on, use a stereo zoom microscope to see the pancreatic structures.\nTo avoid collagenase injection into the stomach/intestine, clamp the duodenum on the right side of the musculus sphincter of Oddi located at the end of the bile duct. It appears as a bright/whitish dot in the duodenum. Use the weight of the clamp to spread the gut and pancreas to have a good view (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).",
    "Place the 30 G needle with a 2 mL syringe in the musculus sphincter of Oddi and inject 2 mL collagenase solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Pancreas perfusion\n    \nRemove the omentum, located between the spleen and stomach (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nBefore taking out the pancreas, separate it from the stomach and the gut. Afterward, remove the spleen from the pancreas (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).\nPlace it in the 50 mL conical tube prefilled with 2 mL collagenase solution.\nPut the tube on ice, if several pancreata are perfused.\nCritical: For exocrine tissue: Perfuse the pancreas, even though only exocrine tissue is used. The cell yield of the immune cell fraction is higher from a perfused pancreas compared to a non-perfused pancreas.\nCritical: For islets: Most islets are located close to the spleen. To harvest the highest possible number of islets from the pancreas (a typical yield in a 12-week-old C57BL/6N mouse is 200-300), it is important that the part close to the spleen is well perfused. For a successful perfusion, the 30 G needle has to be in the pancreatic duct via the musculus sphincter of Oddi (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], related to step 3i). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nIncubation of the pancreas – 30 min in a 37°C water bath, without shaking (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J).\nCritical: The time of the incubation depends on the pancreas tissue which is influenced by various factors such as age of the mouse, genetic background and research model studied. If the tissue is more fibrotic, it is recommended to prolong the incubation. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nStop collagenase activity.\nAfter incubation, shake the falcon tube 30–40 times to create a homogenous solution.",
    "Add ice-cold quenching buffer (QB) to stop the action of the collagenase. Invert the tube 3 times before putting it in the centrifuge.\nSpin down: 570 g, 2 min, 4°C.\nWash tissue with QB.\nAspirate the QB, but leave the pellet.\nAdd 35 mL QB, briefly vortex three times.\nSpin down: 570 g, 2 min, 4°C.\nClearance of undigested pancreas parts.\nAspirate supernatant and add 10 mL QB, pipet up down (five times) using a 10 mL serological pipette.\nPass the mixture through a 500 μm strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K–1M).\nWash the initial tube with an additional 10 mL QB to collect the remaining islets, and run it through the 500 μm strainer as well.\nNote: No need to be very gentle during pipetting the solution up and down (Step 7a).\nSeparate islets and exocrine pancreas.\nPrepare a 15 cm dish with a spacer. Put a 70 μm strainer on top of the spacer.\nAs a spacer, take a weighing boat and cut a hole on top and on the side (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]N).\nRun the solution containing the islets from the 50 mL falcon tube through the inverted 70 μm strainer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]O).\nWash again with an additional 10 mL QB in order to get the remaining islets, and run it through the 70 μm strainer as well.\nTransfer the islets from the strainer into a 6 cm tissue culture dish containing islet culture media by inverting the strainer and dipping it in the media (5 mL media). Liberate remaining islets potentially stuck to the bottom of the filter by moving a pipette tip across the top of the filter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]P).",
    "Put the islets in the dish into a cell culture incubator for at least 15 min to let them recover from the islet isolation.\nFilter the exocrine tissue, after previous filtering through the 70 μm strainer, again through a 40 μm strainer directly into a new falcon tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Q). Pellet the exocrine tissue by centrifugation: 350 g, 5 min, 4°C.\nNote: For islet culture in vitro, use non-treated culture dishes as cells should not attach. For example: Tissue culture dish 60, Suspension (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) (Step 8e).\nNote: To avoid too much junk from the exocrine tissue in the analysis later, an additional filtration step using a 40 μL strainer is added (Step 8f). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nDisperse islets and exocrine tissue into single cells\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes how to process the islets and exocrine tissue into single cells. The immune cells from exocrine tissue are enriched by density centrifugation. The islets need to be hand-picked before they can be dispersed with trypsin.\nNote: This step requires two people to proceed in parallel with the exocrine and endocrine pancreas, respectively. It takes approximately 20 min to pick islets from one pancreas. If there is only one person, we recommend starting with the immune cell isolation from the exocrine tissue and keeping the islets in the incubator in the meantime.\nExocrine tissue: Density gradient centrifugation with Percoll.\nPercoll preparation.\nStock Percoll: 90% pure Percoll + 10% 10x PBS.\n70% Percoll: 70% stock Percoll + 30% 1xPBS.\n40% Percoll: 40% stock Percoll + 60% 1x PBS.\nPipet 4 mL 40% Percoll in a 15 mL tube, add a glass pipette to the tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3068-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Density gradient centrifugation with Percoll\n(A) 15 mL tube with 4 mL of 40% Percoll and a glass pipette.",
    "(B) 70% Percoll with cells are filled slowly into the 15 mL tube through the glass pipette.\n(C) Percoll gradient with sample: From bottom to the top: 70% Percoll with cells, 70%/40% Percoll gradient and 40% Percoll.\n(D) Layer from top to bottom after centrifugation: Layer of fat and debris, lymphocytes (ring layer), erythrocytes.\nAfter centrifugation of the exocrine tissue (Step 8f above), aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 mL 70% Percoll using a 1000 μL pipette.\nAdd an additional 3 mL of 70% Percoll and mix.\nSlowly fill the 70% Percoll with the resuspended cells into the glass pipette. A 70%/40% Percoll gradient should appear (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nCarefully remove the glass pipette. Do not reinsert the glass pipette, after passing the 70%/40% Percoll gradient.\nCritical: Using a gradient increases the yield of immune cells from exocrine tissue, compared to samples processed without a Percoll gradient. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCentrifuge: 20 min, 600 g, 22°C, with minimal brake and acceleration.\nPrepare 10 mL flow cytometry staining buffer (FB) in a 15 mL tube.\nAspirate the first layer containing fat and debris and trash it (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nTake 3–4 mL from the ring layer (lymphocytes) and transfer it into the 15 mL tube containing 10 mL FB buffer.\nSpin down: 250 g, 5 min, 4°C.\nNote: If there is only one person to proceed with the experiment, continue with step 11. Otherwise, immune cells from exocrine pancreas will be lost. Return to step 10 when the samples from exocrine tissue are being acquired on the flow cytometer.\nIslets: Disperse islets with trypsin.\nHand-pick islets under a stereo microscope using a 10 μL pipette and transfer them into a new tissue culture dish containing 5 mL islet culture media (stereo microscope does not need to be sterile).",
    "Repick islets from the tissue culture dish into a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL PBS.\nSpin down: 350 g, 5 min, at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant using a pipette.\nAdd 800 μL of dissociation buffer.\nAdd 200 μL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (1x) (end concentration 0.01% Trypsin).\nUse 0.5% Trypsin-EDTA (10x).\nDilute 1:10 in PBS = 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (1x) (stock solution, store at -20°C).\nPut the tube in a 37°C water bath.\nPipet up and down 3 times with a 1000 μL pipette every 30 s up to 1 min 30 s (avoid foaming). Observe how the islets get dissociated.\nAfter 1 min 30 s, reduce trypsin activity by adding 10 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nKeep the cells on ice.\nSpin down 250 g, 5 min, 4°C.\nNote: Pick islets that are light brown in color (viable islets) and avoid islets containing dark brown centers as this is an indicator of hypoxic islets (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3068-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Healthy and hypoxic islets\n(A) Light brown-colored healthy islets (1); Islets with hypoxic cells (2) identifiable as dark brown center (arrows).\nNote: FB can also be used to reduce the trypsin activity. In this protocol, we stain the cells afterward with a fixable viability kit, where the manufacturer recommends washing the cells twice with PBS before staining the cells to avoid the presence of proteins in the staining buffer.",
    "Alternatives: Be aware that trypsin can disrupt cell surface proteins as it is an enzyme and cleaves proteins to dissociate cells. Possible alternative for trypsin is a chemical dissociation using a non-enzymatic solution (Cell dissociation solution non-enzymatic 1x; Ref: C5914, Sigma), where calcium chelators are used to separate cell-cell contact. This is known to be more gentle and avoid potentially damaging proteolytic effects on cell surface.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] For islets, both dissociation methods work; with trypsin yielding a slightly higher viability.\nImmune cell staining\nTiming: 1 h\nThis part of the protocol explains the fluorescent conjugated antibody staining of the immune cells from exocrine tissue and dispersed islet cells. Starting with live/dead staining, followed by Fc receptor blocking staining and cell surface staining.\nBeads for references control.\nVortex beads for 30 s and add one drop of beads in 200 μL of FB (beads solution).\nAliquot 50 μL of beads solution in 5 mL flow cytometry tubes.\nAdd one μL of each antibody into 50 μL beads solution.\nVortex flow cytometry tubes.\nIncubate for 20 min on ice in the dark.\nAdd 200 μL FB and mix the beads.\nSpin down: 600 g, 5 min, 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend beads in 200 μL FB for washing.\nSpin down: 600 g, 5 min, 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 200 μL FB.\nNote: Prepare beads always fresh and treat them the same way as the cells i.e., washing steps, duration of the staining, temperature, and light conditions (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCell counting (if needed).\nPass cells through 5 mL flow cytometry tubes with a 35 μm strainer.\nWash cells twice with PBS.\nIf you already reduce the trypsin activity with PBS, one wash is enough (Step 10i).\nIn between washes, take 20μL sample for cell counting.",
    "Count cells with a cell counter, to get the total number of cells per sample.\nLive/dead cell staining using Zombie NIR.\nAdd 50 μL PBS containing 1:2000 Zombie NIR to the pellet and pipet up and down. Leave some cells to serve as unstained control.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAdd 150 μL PBS and resuspend the cells.\nSpin down: 250 g, 5 min, 4°C.\nNote: Viability dyes should be titrated before usage. If there are only conventional cytometers available, please consider using other viability dyes i.e., Zombie violet or red (as Ly6G in APC-Cy7 is spectrally similar to Zombie NIR and can only be unmixed by spectral flow cytometry).\nAlternatives: Use DAPI (Cat # 422801, BioLegend) for live/dead staining. Add DAPI (1.38 μg/mL (3 μM)) immediately before acquiring samples to minimize the number of false-positive cells.\nCritical: Methodology and interpretation of live/dead staining is critical in islet cells. We observed an increased live cell fraction in Zombie NIR-stained cells compared to DAPI-stained cells. One potential reason for this finding is that Zombie NIR is added at the beginning of the staining process and later events occurring during the process are not stained. Another influence however is that the number of DAPI-positive β-cells increases shortly after the addition of DAPI, which results in a smaller live cell fraction. We assume that DAPI is taken up passively. If you are using DAPI, add it immediately before acquiring samples and note, if sample acquisition takes longer. If a real-time viability control is needed, check cells under the microscope.\nFc receptor blocking staining (CD16/CD32 antibody).\nAdd 50 μL FB containing 1:100 CD16/CD32 antibody.\nStain for 10 min on ice in the dark.",
    "Critical: This step is important to avoid CD16/CD32+ cells binding unspecifically to the antibodies. CD16/CD32 is primarily found on B-cells, monocytes, and granulocytes.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nCell surface immune cell staining.\nAdd 50 μL antibody mix directly to the sample (on top of the CD16/CD32 solution).\nStain for 20 min on ice in the dark. Staining duration may be increased depending on epitopes.\nAdd 100 μL FB and pipet up and down.\nSpin down: 250 g, 5 min, 4°C.\nNote: To get a clearer separation between negative and positive populations, longer staining with lower antibody concentrations may be advantageous.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nFluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls (for setup antibody panel).\nTreat sample as described above for the full stained sample.\nUse antibody mix minus selected antibody of interest.\nCritical: Autofluorescence of cells from exocrine pancreas have a high intensity in the UV channels. Therefore, we recommend analyzing the autofluorescence of unstained cells first, before creating cell surface antibody panels. During the antibody panel setup, FMO controls are useful to determine the gates of the different antibodies.\nWash cells once before acquiring.\nAdd 200 μL FB and resuspend the cells.\nSpin down: 250 g, 5 min, 4°C and discard supernatant.\nSample acquisition\nTiming: 1–2 h\nAcquiring samples using a 5-Laser Cytek Aurora and analyzing the data with FlowJo or equivalent software.\nResuspend the cells in 200 μL FB.\nFilter through flow cytometry tubes (with a 35 μm strainer cap) before acquiring.\nAcquire the samples using a Cytek Aurora.",
    "Note: Different types of flow analysis equipment will require adjustments of the staining panel. Here, we used the Cytek Aurora to have a full spectrum data analysis, which can help to define the sample autofluorescence compared to a conventional flow cytometer setup. Moreover, it allows the use of similar fluorochromes as spectral flow cytometry considers the whole fluorochrome emission spectra.\nCritical: In order to minimize the number of dead immune cells from the exocrine pancreas it is necessary to have the samples on ice throughout the whole process. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nAnalyze the samples with FlowJo or another software package to analyze flow cytometry data (e.g., FCS express or OMIQ)."
