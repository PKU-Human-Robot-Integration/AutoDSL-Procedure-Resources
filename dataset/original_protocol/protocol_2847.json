We use trypsin as the activating protease because it is known to activate several coronaviruses for cell entry,10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] and has a similar cleavage specificity to TMPRSS2.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Furimazine turnover is used to measure the HiBiT-LgBiT complementation that reads out VLP-EV fusion kinetics. Assay signals are interpreted relative to control conditions in which VLPs lack S proteins or EVs lack receptors.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2553-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Receptor and protease dependence in VLP-EV fusion assays\nSEC purified S15-LgBiT EVs (+/- ACE2) were pre-incubated with DrkBiT before adding substrate, VLP and either trypsin (50 ng/μL) or PBS. Readings were taken every 2 min in a 37°C luminometer. Background is defined as RLU generated by parallel fusion assays in which VLPs lacked S proteins. Backgrounds were subtracted from each condition and graphed. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM) and a line of best fit (LOWESS curve) was generated with GraphPad Prism software.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2553-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Trypsin sensitivities of VLP-EV fusion assays\nSEC purified ACE2 containing EVs were incubated with SARS-2 VLPs, substrate, and DrkBiT at 37°C for 1 h. After incubation, trypsin was added at indicated final concentrations. The reactions were read in a 37°C luminometer every 2 min. The data shown were taken from the 60 min-post trypsin time point. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).\nPlace a white walled 96 well plate on ice.\nCritical: Keep plate and all reagents on ice until fusion reaction is ready to start. The fusion reaction is temperature sensitive.\nObtain and thaw required reagents:\n1 mg/mL trypsin (TPCK treated, Sigma).\nNano-Glo HiBiT extracellular detection substrate (Promega).\nConcentrated VLPs (+/- S) prepared in earlier steps.",
    "Unconcentrated supernatant can be used but may require larger reaction volumes.\nConcentrated EVs prepared in earlier steps.\nUnconcentrated supernatant can be used but may require larger reaction volumes.\n1× PBS.\nOptional: Inhibit extravesicular LgBiT in EVs with DrkBiT peptide by mixing the DrkBiT peptide with an aliquot of EVs diluted in 25 µL PBS. (10 µM final DrkBiT concentration). Incubate EV/DrkBiT mix at 37°C for 1 hour.\nNote: DrkBiT is a small peptide competitive inhibitor of LgBiT. DrkBiT can be added to inhibit extravesicular LgBiT in fusion assays. This is typically not required if using sufficiently pure EVs. If using unpurified EVs, DrkBiT should be used to minimize background signals.\nDispense 25 μL diluted EVs in white walled 96 well plate.\nDilute in 1× PBS to 25 μL per well.\nAmount of EVs added depends on concentration; 1 μL of 100× concentrated EV per well is a good starting point.\nOn ice, prepare at least two parallel master mixes, one containing VLPs that contain spike and one containing VLPs that lack spike.\nNano-Glo extracellular detection substrate: 0.5 μL per well.\nVLP (amount added depends on concentration):\n1 μL of 40× concentrated VLP per well is a good starting point.\nTrypsin to a final concentration of 50 ng/μL.\nPBS up to 25 μL volume per well.\nDispense 25 μL of master mixes into the wells containing EVs (final volume 50 μL).\nBring the plate to 37°C.\nRead luminescence at frequent time intervals for 1–3 h.\nFusion is interpreted as signal above background (background defined as RLU from condition with VLPs lacking spike).\nUsing the VLP-EV fusion assay to measure activities of antiviral agents\nTiming:  ≈3 h",
    "VLP-EV fusion is inhibited by antibodies and other antiviral inhibitors. The VLP-EV fusion assay accurately measures serum neutralization titers from convalescent or vaccinated patients, matching those determined by plaque-reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) assays involving authentic SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious coronaviruses (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The VLP-EV fusion assay also accurately measures the activity of antiviral peptide fusion inhibitors as recently described in Marcink et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2553-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Comparison of antibody neutralization titers obtained by PRNT and VLP-EV fusion assays\nPRNT assay: Infectious SARS-CoV-2 viruses were incubated with COVID-19 convalescent patient sera in half-log dilutions at 37°C for 30 min, inoculated onto Vero cells, and plaques enumerated two days later. The sera dilution factors generating 50% reduction of enumerated plaques were stated as Plaque Reduction Neutralization Titer (PRNT) values. VLP-EV fusion assay: SARS-2 VLPs were incubated with COVID-19 convalescent patient sera in half-log dilutions at 37°C for 30 min. After incubation, a mix of ACE2-containing EVs, substrate, and trypsin (50 ng/μL) were added to each well. The reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min. The reactions were then brought to 37°C and readings were recorded with a luminometer. IC50 values were calculated in GraphPad prism using the 60 min timepoint values.\nPlace a white-walled 96 well plate on ice.\nObtain and thaw required reagents:\n1 mg/mL trypsin (TPCK treated, Sigma).\nNano-Glo HiBiT extracellular detection substrate (Promega).\nConcentrated +S and -S VLPs prepared in earlier steps.\nEVs prepared in earlier steps.\nPBS.\nPBS containing 0.5% BSA.\nSerum to be tested.\nSerially dilute sera samples in PBS containing 0.5% BSA per well.\nTypically, half-log or log dilutions.\nCritical: 0.5% BSA is added to keep protein concentrations similar across dilutions.\nDilute VLP (+/- S), into 5 μL PBS per well.",
    "Amount of VLP added may vary depending on yield. 1 μL of VLP per well may be a good starting point.\nAdd the 5 μL diluted VLPs per well of the cold white walled 96 well plate.\nParallel of spike and bald VLPs for each serum sample dilutions.\nAdd 5 μL of serum sample dilutions per well to VLP containing wells.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 30 min.\nBring plate back to ice.\nAdd a 40 μL master mix to each well composed of the following:\nNano-Glo HiBiT extracellular detection substrate: 0.5 μL per well.\nACE2 containing EV: amount added depends on yield.\nTrypsin: to 50 ng/ μL final concentration in the total 50 μL reaction per well.\nPBS: to 40 μL.\nIncubate 30 min on ice.\nShift to 37°C and read luminescence at frequent time intervals for 1–3 h.\nBroadening the VLP-EV fusion assay to several coronaviruses\nTiming:  ≈5 days\nThis VLP-EV fusion platform can be adapted to coronaviruses beyond SARS-CoV-2. We have used the assay format to evaluate mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) fusion with respective receptor-bearing EVs (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2553-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Expanding VLP-EV fusion assays to diverse coronaviruses\n(A and B) S15-LgBiT EVs containing either DPP4 (A) or CEACAM (B) were harvested and purified by SEC. 5 μL of each 0.5-mL fraction were complemented with HiBiT in presence of substrate and passive lysis buffer. The signals at fractions 7–9 include peak EV eluates. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).\n(C) MERS VLPs were mixed with SEC-purified DPP4 EVs.",
    "(D) MHV VLPs were mixed with SEC-purifed CEACAM EVs. VLPs and EVs were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Trypsin (50 ng/μL) and nanoluciferase substrate were then added, and luminescence readings were taken every 2 min in a 37°C luminometer. Background is defined as RLU generated by parallel fusion assays in which VLPs lacked S proteins. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).\nProduce VLPs using the designated protocols, with the following changes:\nReplace SARS-CoV-2 S, E, M, and HiBiT-N plasmids with plasmids encoding the S, E, M, and HiBiT-N proteins of the coronavirus of interest.\nProduce and purify EVs using the designated protocols, with the following changes:\nInstead of co-transfecting ACE2 and S15-LgBiT plasmids, swap ACE2 with the corresponding coronavirus receptor (hDPP4 for MERS-CoV; mCEACAM for MHV).\nPerform the VLP-EV fusion reactions using designated protocols, with the following changes:\nVolumes of EV and VLP required for each reaction may vary from the assays described for SARS-CoV-2."
