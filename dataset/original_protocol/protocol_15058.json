    "1. Preparation of Images for Analyses\nObtain murine or human echocardiographic B-mode images in the parasternal long-axis view. Adjust time-gain compensation settings and placement of the transmit focus to optimize visualization of the LV and other cardiac structures in the parasternal view, per usual practice. Ensure all images are saved in DICOM file format. Standardized image views place the inferolateral left ventricular wall at the base of the frame. Frames must display the entirety of the left ventricular myocardium and pericardium. Resolution must be high enough to demarcate the pericardial border, myocardial wall, and endocardial border of the left ventricle. Discard images with excess dropout or image artifacts.\nImport an image file for analysis into ImageJ software platform v1.46 as a DICOM file. Convert the file to an 8-bit image file.\nScroll through consecutive frames of the cardiac cycle until reaching an appropriate quality end-diastolic frame. Alternatively, select the end-diastolic frame in an echocardiographic viewing program and then export to a high-resolution .jpg file format for use in ImageJ. Identify the frames closest to end-diastole using the R wave of the ECG tracing, and then identify the single best frame that captures the LV with maximal internal dimension. Consider this single frame the end-diastolic frame.\nIt is suggested that users be blinded to subject identity when selecting regions of interest.\n2. ROI Sampling\nPericardial reference selection. When selecting the pericardial region of interest (ROI), aim to capture the heterogeneity of the pericardial tissue. Note that image brightness and contrast may be adjusted for ROI selection, as needed, without any effect on analysis results.\n\t\nUsing ImageJ's rectangle drawing tool, select a rectangle with length approximating the middle third of the basal inferolateral pericardial wall.\nResize the rectangular ROIÂ to span the width of the pericardium using the ROI sizing tool.",
    "Rotate the ROI to lie within the pericardial region using ImageJ's rotate tool.\nMake any necessary adjustments to the corners of the pericardial ROI. Capture a final pericardial region of interest that lies within the middle third of the pericardial wall, and includes the width of the pericardial wall without extending into the myocardial or extra-cardiac regions. Aim to capture the same relative location and percentage of total pericardial area for all measures made in a given study.\nApply the algorithm to the selection via ImageJ analysis tools (see section 3).\nMyocardial selection. Once again, aim to capture the heterogeneity of the myocardial tissue within the middle third of the basal inferolateral myocardial wall. Note that image brightness and contrast may be adjusted for ROI selection, as needed, without any effect on analysis results.\n\t\nSelect a rectangle that spans the width of the myocardial wall, excluding the endocardium and epicardium. Ensure that the myocardial selection lies adjacent to the pericardial selection and at the same theta angle. Do not include areas of papillary muscle within the selection area.\nRotate the myocardial ROI such that it lies parallel to the pericardial selection.\nMake any necessary adjustments to the corners of the myocardial ROI. Isolate a final myocardial region of interest that lies within the middle third of the myocardial wall, and captures the width of the wall without extending into the pericardial or intraluminal regions.\nApply the algorithm to the selection via an ImageJ macro.\n3. Data Analysis and Processing\nInstall the ImageJ macro called \"getHistogramValues.txt\".\nUse the ImageJ histogram analysis tool to preview the distribution of signal intensity values within the ROI (perform this step for the pericardial selection and for the myocardial selection).",
    "Use the ImageJ macro to record these signal density values for the ROI (perform this step for the pericardial selection and for the myocardial selection).\n\t\nAssign an intensity value from 0 (darkest) to 255 (brightest) units to each pixel within the selection.\nArrange the intensity values hierarchically, in order of increasing intensity, to produce a distribution of signal intensity.\nSelect and report the following percentile values for the distribution: 20th percentile, 50th percentile (median), and 80th percentile.\nNormalize myocardial intensities using the pericardial reference.\n\t\nNormalize by dividing the myocardial percentile values of intensity by the corresponding pericardial percentile values of intensity12, or by subtracting the myocardial percentile value of intensity from the pericardial percentile value of intensity13.\nReport values for the four analytic methods: normalized myocardial-to-pericardial values for the 20th percentile, 50th percentile (median), and 80th percentile values.\n4. Quantifying Cyclical Variability\nApply algorithm to myocardial selections through consecutive frames of the DICOM file, moving through the cardiac cycle. Compare differences in intensity distributions between frames, with attention to end-systolic and end-diastolic frames.\n\tAll the image analyses described above are performed offline on noninvasive echocardiographic images previously acquired and digitally stored in DICOM format. All study protocols were approved by the Brigham and Women's institutional review board and the Harvard Medical Area standing Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nSubscription Required.
