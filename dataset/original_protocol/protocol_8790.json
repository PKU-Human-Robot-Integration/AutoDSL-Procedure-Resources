    "All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Korea and were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23).\n1. Novel object location test (NL)\nPrepare epileptic C57BL/6 or transgenic mice 4–6 weeks after pilocarpine injection.\n\tNOTE: Acute seizures were induced by intraperitoneal (IP) pilocarpine injection, following the protocol detailed in our previous report14.\nTransfer the epileptic mice from the breeding room to the behavior room one day before the behavioral tests begin. Allow the mice to habituate for at least 12 h overnight.\nIn the behavior room, separate individual mice into new cages for single housing. Write the information for each animal on the cage card and keep the animals in the same cages throughout the behavioral testing. Multiple cages can be simultaneously transferred using a cart.\nOn the next day, begin 3 days of habituation sessions (H1–H3) in the early morning. Acclimate the animals to the low light in their home cages for at least 30 min.\nPrepare an open field box with outside dimensions of 44 x 44 x 31 cm and inside dimensions of 43 x 43 x 30.5 cm. On day 1 of the habituation (H1), place an illuminometer in the center of the open field box and adjust the illuminance to 60 lux.\nSpray the floor and walls of the open field box with 70% ethanol and wipe down with a clean paper towel to remove possible olfactory cues. Then wait for at least 1 min until the residual alcohol has dried completely.\nEvaluate the locomotor activity of each mouse by performing an open field test.",
    "To record and track the behavior of each experimental mouse, use animal behavior video tracking software (see Table of Materials).\nOnce the video tracking software is opened, calibrate the size of the open field box. Then, set the zone for tracking. Set 3 s of latency and 15 min of acquisition time to avoid tracking an experimenter’s hands. Insert the information about each experimental mouse (group, gender, age, etc.).\nThen, gently place an experimental mouse in the open field box facing the wall. Do this by placing it on the cage lid to minimize handling-associated stress and anxiety. Then, release the mouse near the wall of the open field box that is the farthest from where the objects will be during the familiarization session (step 1.9.3.).\n\t\tNOTE: Once the mouse is in the open field box, the mouse tracking software will automatically detect it and start recording. For optimal tracking of the exploration, the camera can be placed directly above the open field box.\nAfter 15 min of recording, return the animal to its home cage by placing it on the cage lid. Clean the open field box with 70% ethanol spray and wipe down with a clean paper towel between trials. Restore the bright light and measure the animal’s total distance moved using the video tracking software according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\t\t\nOpen the video tracking software and video clips. Then, click Analysis to calculate the total distance moved based on the calibration of the open field box size.\nOn day 2 and day 3, perform the habituation sessions (H2, H3) by repeating steps 1.3 to 1.7.\nOn day 4, perform the familiarization session (F1).",
    "In the dim light, place each mouse in the empty open field for 3 min. After that brief rehabituation, return the animal to its home cage.\nDuring the habituation, thoroughly clean the objects with 70% ethanol and wipe them down with a paper towel. Wait for at least 1 min for the residual alcohol to dry completely.\nPlace two identical objects (rubber dolls, object A) in the open field arena 5 cm away from the adjoining walls. Fix the objects with double-sided tape. Introduce the experimental mouse into the open field box, facing the wall farthest from the objects.\nAllow free exploration for 20 min and manually measure the time spent exploring both objects using two stopwatches. Once the mouse reaches the minimum exploration time (30 s) for both objects, stop the F1 session and transfer the animal to its home cage. If the mouse fails to explore the objects for 30 s within 20 min, remove the mouse from the open field box and exclude it from further sessions.\nAfter the animal is removed from the open field box, thoroughly clean the floor and walls of the box with 70% ethanol spray and wipe them down with a paper towel.\n\t\tNOTE: Measure the time when the mouse touches the objects with its whiskers, snout, or front paws. Do not quantify as exploratory time any behaviors in which the animal’s snout does not point toward the object, such as sitting on the object, passing by the object, or resting with its hind end pointing at the object.\nOn day 5, perform the NL testing session.\n\t\nTransfer the mouse from its home cage to the open field area for rehabituation for 3 min. Then return the animal to its home cage.",
    "During the habituation, thoroughly clean the objects with 70% ethanol and wipe them down with a paper towel. Wait for at least 1 min for the residual alcohol to dry completely.\nMove one object (rubber doll, object A) to the diagonal position, 5 cm away from the adjoining walls. Fix the object with double-sided tape. Transfer the experimental mouse on its cage lid to the open field area and place it facing the wall of the open field box.\n\t\tNOTE: Counterbalance the location of the object moved to reduce any potential innate preference for a certain direction. For example, change the location of the preferred object from the familiarization session for half of the experimental animals, and for the rest of the animals, move the less preferred object from the familiarization session.\nAllow 10 min of free exploration and record with a video tracking system. Measure the time spent exploring each object using two stopwatches and calculate the discrimination ratio as\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60751/60751equ01.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Measure the time when the mouse touches the objects with its whiskers, snout, or front paws. Do not quantify as exploratory time any behaviors in which the animal’s snout does not point toward the object, such as sitting on the object, passing by the object, or resting with its hind end pointing at the object.\nGrab the tail of the experimental mouse and place it on its cage lid for transfer to its home cage. For 3 days (days 6–8), let the mouse rest with free access to food and water.\nOnce the animal is removed from the open field box, thoroughly clean the floor and walls of the box with 70% ethanol spray and wipe down with a paper towel.\n2. Novel object recognition test (NO)",
    "On day 9, perform a 15 min habituation session by repeating steps 1.2–1.7.\nOn day 10, perform the familiarization session (F1).\n\t\nIn dim light, place the mouse in the empty open field for 3 min. After rehabituating the mouse to the open field area, temporarily return it to its home cage.\nDuring the habituation, thoroughly clean the objects with 70% ethanol and wipe down with a paper towel. Wait at least 1 min for the residual alcohol to dry completely.\nPlace two identical objects (50 mL plastic tubes filled with 40 mL of water, object B) in the open field 5 cm away from the adjoining walls. Fix the objects with double-sided tape. Introduce the experimental mouse into the open field box facing the wall farthest from the objects.\nAs the animal is exposed to the two different objects (50 mL plastic tube filled with 40 mL of water, object B; glass Coplin jar, object C) in the NO test, counterbalance the object during the F1 session. For example, present two identical objects (glass Coplin jars, object C) for half of the animals in the group.\nAllow free exploration for 20 min and manually measure the time spent exploring both objects using two stopwatches. Once the mouse reaches the minimum exploration time (30 s) for both objects, stop the F1 session and transfer the animal to its home cage. If the mouse fails to explore the objects for 30 s within 20 min, remove it from the open field box and exclude it from further sessions.\nAfter the animal is removed from the open field box, thoroughly clean the floor and walls of the box with 70% ethanol spray and wipe them down with a paper towel.",

Do not quantify as exploratory time any behaviors in which the animal’s snout does not point toward the object, such as sitting on the object, passing by the object, or resting with its hind end pointing at the object.\nOn the next day (day 11), perform the NO testing session.\n\t\nTransfer the mouse from its home cage to the open field for rehabituation for 3 min, and then return the animal to its home cage.\nDuring the habituation, thoroughly clean the objects with 70% ethanol and wipe down with a paper towel. Wait for at least 1 min for the residual alcohol to dry completely.\nReplace one object (50 mL plastic tube filled with 40 mL of water, object B) with another object (glass Coplin jar, object C) 5 cm away from the adjoining walls. Fix the objects with double-sided tape. Transfer the experimental mouse on the cage lid to the open field, and place it facing the wall. Counterbalance the objects presented together during the NO test. For example, replace one glass Coplin jar (object C) with a 50 mL plastic tube filled with 40 mL of water (object B) for the mice exposed to the two glass Coplin jars (object C) during the familiarization session.\n\t\tNOTE: Counterbalancing the location of the object replaced can be also performed to reduce the potential innate preference for a certain direction. For example, for each cohort of the animals exposed to the set of two objects (object B or object C), change the preferred object in the familiarization session for half of the experimental animals, and for the rest of the animals, replace the object less preferred in the familiarization session.",

Pattern separation test (PS)\nOn day 15, perform the first familiarization session (F1) for the PS test.\n\t\nTransfer the mouse from its home cage to the open field area for rehabituation for 3 min, and then return it to its home cage.\nDuring the habituation, thoroughly clean the objects and the gridded floor plate with 70% ethanol and wipe down with a paper towel. Wait for at least 1 min for the residual alcohol to dry completely.",
    "Place the floor plate (42.5 x 42.5 x 0.5 cm) with the wide grid (5.5 x 5.5 cm) in the open field box and place two identical objects (plastic T-flasks filled with 50 mL of water, object D) in the open field 5 cm away from the adjoining walls.

Cresyl violet staining\nAfter completing all the behavioral tests, anesthetize the animal by injecting a cocktail (4:0.5) of ketamine (50 mg/mL) and xylazine (23.3 mg/mL) dissolved in saline at a dose of 110 mL/kg body weight (IP; 1 mL syringe; 26 G needle). Check for the depth of anesthesia by the lack of a response to a toe pinch.\nOnce the animal is deeply anesthetized, perform transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the brain15.\nAfter the transcardial perfusion is finished, decapitate the animal with a pair of scissors15. Then, remove the skull using a pair of iris scissors to expose the brain. After the brain is isolated, postfix it in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, followed by cryoprotection in 30% sucrose in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline.\nMake coronal sections (30 μm) from the snap-frozen brain using a cryostat.\nMount the brain tissues on slides and perform a series of hydration steps from 100% ethanol to tap water by washing for 3 min sequentially in 100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70% ethanol.\nIncubate the tissue slides in 0.1% cresyl violet solution for 15 min.\nRemove excessive stain by immersing the tissue slides in 95% ethanol/0.1% glacial acetic acid, and then dehydrate the tissues with solutions of 100% ethanol, 50% ethanol/50% xylene, and 100% xylene.\nCoverslip the tissue slides using a commercially available xylene mounting medium.",
