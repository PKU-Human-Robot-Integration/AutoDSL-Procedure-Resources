    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue preparation\nTiming: ∼1 h hands on + 2 days unattended\nThis protocol has been established on perfusion-fixed SC tissue of adult C57BL/6J mice.\nCritical: Make sure to acquire approval for anesthesia and perfusion of mice and to comply with institutional guidelines on the care and use of animals in research.\nPerfuse the deeply anesthetized animal with PBS followed by 4% PFA in PBS and expose the SC by standard laminectomy or by hydraulic extrusion (Kennedy et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Postfix spinal tissue in 4% PFA in PBS on an orbital shaker for 2–12 h at 4°C.\nWash SC 3x (10 min each) in PBS on ice, remove dura and meninges, then transfer into a 15 mL tube filled with PBS containing 30% sucrose and incubate at 4°C for 1–2 days or until the tissue has sunk, for cryo-protection.\nSpinal cord embedding using SpineRacks\nTiming: 10–15 min hands on + 20–30 min unattended\nAfter fixation and isolation of the SC, the tissue is divided into nine short pieces that are embedded with precise upright orientation and in rostrocaudal (r-c) order within the SpineRack support scaffold. Placing tissue pieces in the same block, in order, ensures parallel cryosectioning that reduces whole SC sectioning time and preserves section identity.\nPrepare a ∼5 cm × 5 cm piece of Parafilm, and pour ∼5 mL OCT onto it. This pool of OCT will be used to wash and orient all tissue pieces prior to embedding.\nTransfer the SC together with the sucrose solution to a square petri dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Cut the SC into three equal parts (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C) using sharp spring scissors while viewing with a dissecting microscope.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1177-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(C) SC cut into 3 equal tissue pieces. Numbers 1–9 indicate r-c orientation and placement of next cuts. Ruler scale in mm.\n(D) SC cut into 9 equal pieces arranged according to position in SpineRack in OCT.\n(E) Submerging SpineRack in embedding mold filled with OCT.\n(F–I) Placement of tissue pieces 1–9 into SpineRack.\n(J) Vertical orientation of tissue pieces in the mold.\n(K and L) Incubation of SpineRack in OCT expands and softens the material for sectioning (K: before, L: after 20 min incubation).\n(M) Freezing the block.\nCritical: Make sure to cut perpendicular to the long axis of the SC (angled cuts produce incomplete cross sections that cannot be used for registration). Keep track of the identity and r-c orientation of the tissue pieces.\nCut each piece from step 4 into three equal sized pieces of 3–4 mm (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D). Starting with the most rostral segment, after each cut gently transfer the resulting tissue pieces 1–3 into the OCT puddle with their rostral end facing the top side of the Parafilm square, using forceps. Repeat with the other pieces and collect resulting tissue pieces 4–6 and 7–9 in OCT.\nCritical: Keeping track of the identity and orientation of each tissue piece is essential. For maximal efficiency of cryo-sectioning and subsequent imaging, all tissue pieces should be of equal length.\nFill a truncated embedding mold with OCT and mark one side for orientation (here marked “top”). Submerge a SpineRack into OCT and push all the way to the bottom of the mold using forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). Release any trapped air bubbles.",
    "Critical: After immersing the SpineRack into OCT, the PVA material will start to dissolve and will soften and expand in the process, and this may prevent positioning or placement of tissue pieces. Thus, tissue must be embedded immediately, within the first 15 min after immersing the SpineRack in OCT.\nTransfer one tissue piece at a time into the SpineRack, taking care to load the pieces into wells from top-left to bottom-right in r-c order (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F–1I). Using forceps, carefully push each tissue piece within a well to the bottom of the mold with its rostral end facing down and the dorsal side facing the marked (top) side of the mold (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J). Wide cervical segments 1–3 are rotated by ∼45° to fit the well.\nOptional: If interested only in a smaller sub-region of SC (e.g., L3-L6), SpineRacks can also be used to embed and section multiple samples in parallel.\nOptional: SpineRacks (with same or adjusted geometry) can also be used to embed other tissues or organisms that have a high length-to-width ratio (muscles, fish embryos) or that require parallel sectioning in a single orientation (eg. mouse eyes).\nAfter embedding all tissue pieces, leave mold containing SpineRack and tissue at room temperature for 20–30 min. This allows the PVA material to soften for ease of sectioning (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K and 1L).\nFreeze the block on dry ice in a slush of ethanol and crushed dry ice until the block is solid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]M).\nPause point: Use immediately OR, if the histology protocol in use for the tissue permits, store blocks at −80°C until use. For NeuroTrace or DAPI labelling, blocks can be stored for at least 6 months (longer has not been tested).\nSectioning and staining\nTiming: 2 h hands on + incubation time for immunohistochemistry (optional)",
    "Using SpineRacks, >1000 25μm sections comprising spinal segments C1-L6 can be produced within 1h and collected on as few as 16 slides. Cutting thicker sections can further reduce sectioning and processing time at the expense of r-c resolution.\nPlace the block into the cryostat chamber for 20–30 min to allow temperatures to equilibrate. We section at approximately −21°C using a Leica Cryostat CM3050S and Sakura Finetec microtome blade. For sectioning, remove the mold, keeping track of orientation, and mount the block on the block holder with the marked side up and set sectioning thickness to 25μm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1177-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sectioning, collecting and staining of block sections\n(A) Tissue block mounted in cryostat.\n(B) Schematic arrangement of 8 block sections on a slide in a left-and-up order. See also Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\n(C) Example csv. list of lost sections.\n(D) Slides washing in PBS.\n(E) Slide after staining and mounting.\nSection the block and collect all sections continuously on numbered slides. To permit automated imaging, collect eight block sections in two rows of four with equal spacing on each slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Keep note of the order and orientation of sections on each slide, as this information is crucial to maintain r-c order of images. Make notes of lost sections (slide # and position on slide; lost sections can be replaced with neighboring sections during image processing; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPause point: Unless user-specific antibody or histology procedure of choice does not support it, slides can now be stored at −80°C. For subsequent NeuroTrace or DAPI labelling slides can be stored for at least 3 months (longer has not been tested).",
    "Wash slides in a glass Wheaton dish filled with PBS for 5–10 min (gentle shaking at room temperature) to wash away SpineRack material and OCT (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Proceed with immunohistochemistry, or other staining methods, following standard protocols (Evilsizor et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) and mount slides under coverslips (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCritical: For subsequent image registration and atlas mapping, co-staining with NeuroTrace (preferred) or DAPI is required.\nPause point: Mounted slides can be stored at 4°C in the dark. Slides can be kept for at least 3 months after NeuroTrace or DAPI labelling. User specific antibodies or stains will dictate other storage times.\nImaging\nTiming: 10–15 min hands on + 3–5 h unattended\nImage slides on a slide scanning microscope.\nNote: Processing in SpinalJ requires either images of individual tissue sections or images of block sections (array of 9 tissue sections), and alphanumeric file naming that reflects section order. In this study, we used a motorized Nikon AZ100 Multizoom microscope equipped with an automated slide feeder and Andor Zyla sCMOS camera to acquire images of block sections. Any other automated or manual systems can be used to collect images, but may require additional manual intervention, depending on the capabilities of the individual system to identify, scan and save block sections on the slide automatically. For example, images taken on slide scanners that scan the whole slide have to be cropped to individual block section images. Block section images should be saved as .nd2 or .tif files with file naming “SlideXX_SectionYY” (e.g., Slide12_Section04.nd2). For non-motorized systems, images of individual sections have to be acquired and saved manually. Single section images should be saved as .tif files with file naming “SegmentXX_SlideYY_ImageZZ” (e.g., Segment06_Slide12_Image01.tif) if pre-processing in SpinalJ is desired.",
    "The workflow for automatic scanning of block sections using the Nikon system, running NIS-Elements JOBS software is described below (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]; JOBS file available for download):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1177-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Scan settings for imaging block sections using NIS-Elements JOBS\n(A) Load a pre-scan image of a slide and open pre-scan settings in JOBS file.\n(B) Check ‘rolling ball correction’.\n(C) Set lower and upper threshold to isolate pixel intensities within SC sections.\n(D) Apply size cutoff to filter out objects smaller and larger than SC sections.\n(E) Apply dilation factor to create a mask that connects all sections of a block section, but does not touch sections from neighboring block sections. Save settings and start scan.\nSetting up Nikon slide scanner for scanning block sections with NIS-Elements JOBS:\nLoad all slides in order into a slide magazine (1–16, bottom to top) and initialize the slide scanner using 4x objective, 2.1x zoom.\nOpen JOBS scan file for SC sections and pre-scan 1–2 slides using the autofocusing channel (DAPI or NT). To save the pre-scan, edit settings before scanning as follows (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A):\nUnder PreScanSlide set Save Image → always.\nDisable Region Loop.\nAfter pre-scanning, open the pre-scan image.\nOpen JOBS scan file and open scan parameters (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSet lower and upper intensity threshold to filter out background and unspecific signals (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nSet size cutoff to exclude objects that are not tissue sections (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nSet dilation factor to merge all sections (1-9) of a block section into a single object (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Avoid merging multiple block sections.\nSave settings, disable save pre-scan, enable Region Loop and start the scanning process.\nImage pre-processing in SpinalJ\nTiming: 0.5–1 h hands on + 1–2 h unattended",
    "SpinalJ provides a series of tools to pre-process SC section images for registration and analysis. These include segmentation of block section images, compensation for lost sections, r-c ordering of sections, cleaning out damaged sections, as well as re-orientation and horizontal alignment of sections. If preprocessing has already been performed without using SpinalJ, skip to step 19.\nAchieving r-c order of images critically depends on how sections were collected on the slide. SpinalJ supports a series of collection orders, as defined in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1177-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Run Plugins > SpinalJ > 1 Set Preprocessing Settings. In the GUI that appears, complete the fields below.\nImage Data - Specify location of the folder containing the raw sections.\nNote: Files in .nd2 format cannot exceed 2GB. If image resolution does not match 1micron/pixel, scale images using Fiji>Image>Scale or create custom segmentation masks (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7]).\nReference Channel - Select channel containing NeuroTrace or DAPI.",
    "Transform all Block Section Images - Select transformation option to flip images as necessary so that sections are oriented with their dorsal side up and array order as follows: Top row, left to right: 1, 2, 3. Middle row: 4, 5, 6. Bottom row: 7, 8, 9 (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nDetermine r-c File Order - Select method used to bring image files into r-c order (using stage coordinates or alphanumerical file names).\nOrder of Sections on Slide - Indicate order of sections on slide, see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A. Required only if choosing stage coordinate sorting.\nSegmentation Masks - Specify the location of the folder containing the segmentation masks .roi files. If using images with resolution other than 1micron\\pixel, see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nAutomatic Segmentation:\nMin. Object Size – Specify lower area cutoff for auto-detection of tissue sections. Default: 1e6.\nMax. Object Size – Specify upper area cutoff for auto-detection of tissue sections. Default: 5e6.\nMin. Circularity – Specify lower circularity cutoff for auto-detection of tissue sections. Default: 0.05.\nMax. Circularity – Specify upper circularity cutoff for auto-detection of tissue sections. Default: 1.\nReplace Lost Sections - Check ‘yes’ to compensate for lost sections during cryo-sectioning by duplicating neighboring sections. Requires a .csv list of lost sections (see below).\nLost Sections - Specify the location of the folder containing a .csv list of lost sections. Required only if choosing to replace lost sections. To create the list, enter pairs of values that specify the slide (column A) and the position (column B) on which the section was lost e.g., if the seventh section on the second slide was lost, enter 2, 7 (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). If several consecutive sections are lost, repeat the list entry. The first row contains the titles ‘Slide’ and ‘Section’, respectively. Save list as ‘_Lost_Sections.csv’.",
    "Horizontal Alignment Sampling Interval - Specify n. Total number of sections / n sections are randomly selected to determine the horizontal orientation for each tissue piece. Default: 10.\nMinimal Test Angle - Specify negative test angle extreme. Must be > −90°. Default: −50°.\nMaximal Test Angle - Specify positive test angle extreme. Must be < 90°. Default: 50°.\nTest Angle Increment - Specify interval between test angles. Default: 10.\nMasking Channel - Select channel for section segmentation. NeuroTrace or DAPI.\nThresholding Option for Masking - Choose automatic thresholding option. Empirically, we found ‘Percentile dark’ to work best for NT and ‘Min error’ for DAPI.",
    "Segmentation of block section images: Run Plugins > SpinalJ > 2 Block Section Segmentation to split block section images into individual tissue section images. Confirm path to the folder containing raw image data. Input files need to contain slide information as first part of the filename, e.g., “Slide4_Section3.nd2”. Images in.nd2 format will be automatically sorted rostrocaudally using stage coordinates when selecting the corresponding option in step 14. Images in other file formats have to be renamed manually to reflect r-c order. After ordering, block section images are automatically segmented. Images that contain less than 9 tissue sections cannot be automatically segmented and are saved to folder \\_Temp\\_0_Scaled\\ as a down-scaled version and displayed at the end of the script for manual segmentation. For these files, position the segmentation mask displayed on top of each image so that each tissue section falls within the appropriate outline of the section array mask, reflecting segment identity (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Click OK to proceed to the next section. If identification of segment identity is impossible because of missing sections, hold SHIFT + click OK to skip segmentation of the current image. Output files are saved to folder \\_Temp\\_I_Split\\ with names indicating tissue piece (segment) identity, e.g., “Segment05_Slide12_Image02.tif”.",
    "Segment Rotation: Run Plugins > SpinalJ > 3 Batch Rotation to re-orient section images from tissue pieces embedded upside down or rotated by 90° (e.g., piece 4 in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Confirm path to the folder containing raw image data. A preview montage of all sections will show the reference channel of all section images ordered in rows representing tissue pieces 1–9. Identify rows in which all sections are oriented at an angle ≥ 90° or ≤ −90° and select those rows for rotation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Set rotation value and click OK. Confirm proper orientation in the updated preview montage saved at \\_Temp\\_II_Preview_Split\\.\nSection Clean up: Run Plugins > SpinalJ > 4 Clean Stack to clean out compromised and empty sections and to obtain a continuous stack of intact tissue sections. Confirm path to the folder containing raw image data. A reference channel preview of the image stack of individual tissue sections will be displayed. Navigate through the stack and decide for each section whether to ‘keep’, ‘replace’, or ‘delete’ the current image by pressing the SPACE, CTRL or ALT key, respectively (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E–4M). To the left and right of the stack window, additional windows show the previous (left) and next (right) image in the stack. Use ‘replace’ only after at least one previous image has been selected for ‘keep’. Processed files are saved to folder \\_Temp\\_III_Clean\\ and a preview montage of the reference channel is saved to \\_Temp\\_IV_Preview_Clean\\ for validation.",
    "Horizontal alignment of section images: Run Plugins > SpinalJ > 5_Horizontal Alignment to align tissue sections horizontally in order to improve image registration performance. Confirm path to the folder containing raw image data. After automatic alignment is completed, a preview montage of the cleaned and aligned sections is created for validation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]N). In addition, pre-processed images are scaled to match the resolution of the atlas and saved to a new folder /_Output/ 1_Reformatted_Sections/ with subfolders for each image channel.\nNote: Data generated during image pre-processing will be saved to subfolder \\_Temp\\ and can be deleted after reformatted images have been created (step 18).\nImage registration, atlas mapping, and analysis in SpinalJ\nTiming: 5–30 min hands on + 1–8 h unattended\nAll subsequent steps assume a single folder containing intact, consecutive single section images of a sample with an alphanumerical name format that reflects r-c order.\nSetting Registration and Analysis Parameters for SpinalJ: SpinalJ is designed to batch process multiple samples, even when the experimental conditions or analysis settings are different. This step creates a parameter file containing analysis information for individual samples. Run Plugins > SpinalJ > 6 Set Analysis Settings. In the GUI that appears, complete the fields below:\nSelect folder - Specify the location of the folder containing the ordered tissue sections (/_Output/).\nFinal resolution of image output (μm/px) - Specify the resolution used by the rest of the analysis, default: 2μm/pixel.\nCounterstain channel (DAPI or NeuroTrace) – Select channel containing NeuroTrace, or DAPI.",
    "Background intensity of counterstain channel - this value should be slightly higher than the intensity of the background surrounding the tissue. To determine the background intensity: open a section image in Fiji and hover the cursor over the tissue and background to find a suitable intensity level for this setting. If set too low, the sections will not be adequately isolated, and if set too high, the sections will be patchy and over-cropped.\nBackground removal prior to segmentation (rolling ball radius in px, 0 if none) - Specify the radius of a rolling ball filter used to clean up images before cell detection and projection analysis. A value of 7 works well for the recommend image pixel size of 2μm/px.\nSection cut thickness - Indicate section cut thickness. If using a sub-series, multiply accordingly. E.g., every second section, cut at 20μm = 40μm.\nSpinal cord range (start segment, end segment) - Indicate the range of segments included in the dataset (e.g., C2-L5). To determine range, open preview stack of sections and determine the segment identity of the first and last section based on morphological landmarks and by comparing to neighboring sections.\nReference section - Specify the starting section used for initial section-to-section registration. This should be roughly in the middle of the dataset. e.g., section 500 in a 1000 section dataset.\nGenerate full resolution registered image of reference channel – Check only if attempting to perform cell or projection analysis on the reference channel.\nPerform a second pass section registration - This feature can be used to register badly damaged sections with the help of fiducial markers but is not required for normal use.\nMethod for cell detection:\nManual cell detection takes a list of cell locations created by manual cell counting – see step 20a.",
    "Find Maxima will locate the center of cells and is fast and effective for cells with clearly labeled soma – see step 20b.\nMachine learning segmentation with Ilastik can yield better results, especially when cells are difficult to discern from brightly labeled axons and dendrites. This will require training of an Ilastik Project for each channel – see step 20c.\nChannel selection - Select up to three channel/s for cell analysis. Set the first selector to the channel to analyze. If no remaining channels will be analyzed, set the remaining selectors to 0.\nMinimum intensity threshold: Specify the minimum threshold used for detecting cells when using Find Maxima – see step 20b.\nMinimum cell area: Specify the area used for cell detection (when using Ilastik for segmentation).\nMethod for projection detection:\nBinary Threshold: fluorescence above this threshold will be included in the density analysis. This is a fast and effective method, useful when it’s not necessary to remove cell bodies from the analysis.\nMachine learning segmentation with Ilastik can yield better results than binary thresholding, especially when it is necessary to differentiate between cells and projections. This will require training of an Ilastik Project for each channel – see 20c.\nChannel selection: Select up to three channel/s for projection analysis. Set the first selector to the channel to analyze. If no remaining channels will be analyzed, set the remaining selectors to 0.\nMinimum intensity threshold: Choose the minimum threshold used for detecting projections when using Binary Threshold – see 20b.\nIlastik location: Specify the directory where Ilastik is installed.\nElastix location: Specify the directory where Elastix is installed.\nAfter setting up the Registration and Analysis Parameter file, follow the steps below according to the selected option for cell detection (skip if interested only in intensity mapping, see step 21 i):",

    "Apply a rolling ball filter with the same diameter used within SpinalJ, then confirm the typical intensities of the cells you wish to detect using Find Maxima, and use this value in the analysis settings. For binary thresholding of axons/dendrites use the threshold tool (CTRL+SHIFT+T) to determine the minimum threshold value to be used.\nTraining Ilastik for machine learning based mesoscale mapping / cell detection (19 k.iii): We recommend using Ilastik for best results, especially when analyzing densely labeled neurons, although other cell detection methods are provided. Be aware that oversaturation of axons/dendrites may result in false positive cell detections when using automated analysis. If analyzing both cells and neuronal projections, it is important to ensure your images are free from oversaturated pixels. For best results in quantifying cell numbers, use a probe with nuclear localization, such as GFP fused to histone 2B.\nPrepare representative images for training the Ilastik project. Training Ilastik’s pixel classifier requires several representative images. A minimum of 5 (better 10–20) sections from different r-c positions of the SC is recommended. If training a project on multiple animals or if the label is highly variable between sections, additional training images may be required. Training images can come from the \\1_Reformated_Sections\\ or \\3_Registered_Sections\\ folders. During the SpinalJ pipeline, background subtraction is applied to all sections prior to running Ilastik. After providing a list of sections, images suitable for training will be created and saved to folder \\Ilastik_Training_Images\\.\nCritical: When adding images to the Ilastik project for training, ensure they also have this same background subtraction applied. You can do this by running Plugins > SpinalJ > Other Tools > Create Ilastik training images in Fiji.",
    "Open the provided Ilastik project file. An example project is provided as a template to build the projects for each of your channels containing all settings required to export the necessary probability images for use in SpinalJ.\nSelect the existing images in the project file. Right-click and choose ‘Reset’ - this clears out the existing training data, but keeps project file settings, allowing you to add new images for training.\nCopy in the images selected for training. We recommend saving these images into the project file for auditing and to avoid problems if further training is required. To do so, Right-click and select ‘Dataset Properties…’, in the window that appears, change ‘Storage’ to ‘Copy into project file’. Then save the project.\nTrain the project file. The Ilastik Project comes preconfigured with three labels: Cells (for soma/cell bodies), Projections (for axons/dendrites), and Background. If you are not detecting cells, you do not have to train the cells label (likewise for projections). For best results when training on 16-bit images, it can be helpful to adjust how the image is displayed in Ilastik. You can do this by right-clicking on ‘Raw Input’ in Group Visibility list (lower left-hand corner), then selecting ‘Adjust thresholds’. Uncheck the ‘automatic range’ option and reduce the ‘maximum value’ so that you can clearly visualize low intensity structures. For further advice on training an Ilastik project: https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/pixelclassification/pixelclassification[href=https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/pixelclassification/pixelclassification]\nSave the project file as: ‘Ilastik_Project_Channel_#’ (e.g.,‘Ilastik_Project_Channel_1’ for channel 1) in the \\Ilastik_Projects\\ folder.\nRepeat steps 20 c.i-vi to create an Ilastik project for each channel to be analyzed. These projects can be copied to other animals/datasets to be analyzed.",

Data is provided in the example dataset.\nSelect spinal cord atlas to be used - Specify the directory where the atlas files are located.",
    "1. Perform section registration? - Choose to perform initial rigid body registration of all tissue sections.\n2. Perform atlas registration? - Choose to perform affine and elastic registration for atlas mapping to experimental data.\n3. Perform cell detection and analysis? - Choose to perform cell detection using the method selected in the previous step. If performing manual cell counting, run both registration steps first, manually count cells, then rerun this step with this and the following options enabled. The cell analysis generates two tables for each channel used for cell detection. The Detected Cells table provides information on the coordinates of each cell, the region and segment it is contained in, and the measured mean intensity in each channel. The Detected Cells Summary table provides a total cell count for each region and segment.\nGenerate cell analysis images and heatmaps? - Choose to generate images showing cell locations in the atlas colored according to annotation ID.\n4. Perform mesoscale mapping projection analysis? - Choose to perform projection analysis. The mesoscale mapping analysis uses reverse mapping to generate output tables for each channel containing information on the density of axons/dendrites present in each atlas region, and on the relative density according to the volume of the entire labeled volume. Importantly, all density measurements are calculated using the region volume as represented in the dataset, allowing for accurate measurement even when a region is only partially represented in the experimental data.\nGenerate mesoscale mapping visualization images and heatmaps? - Choose to generate images showing the projections mapped to the atlas and density heatmaps.\n5. Measure mean intensities of annotated regions? - Choose to perform region specific intensity measurements. Mean intensities for each channel, atlas region and segment are saved to output tables.",
    "Generate intensity based atlas images? - Choose to generate an atlas image with regions colored with their measured mean intensity.\n6. Extract specific regions at full resolution (requires >128GB RAM)\nProvide annotation IDs for extraction (e.g., 4,10) - Specify location of a list (comma separated) with annotation regions for extraction.\nNote: After the analysis is complete, all output tables and graphs (e.g., cell density heatmaps, as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) can be found in folder \\5_Analysis_Output\\. In order to re-run analysis with different settings, delete this folder and repeat step 21."
