Anesthetize and shave the mice.\nAnesthetize the mice by injecting 5 μL/g of K/X solution. Wait minimum of 5 min before you proceed to the next step.\nRemove the hair from the dorsal part of the mice using electric clipper.\nSpray the area lightly with 70% ethanol (sterile water can also be used).\nWet shave the area using a sterile razor blade (single edge prep blade).\nNote: It is possible to perform intradermal injections without wet shaving the mice, but it requires more advanced skills and practice.\nNote: It is necessary to anesthetize mice for shaving. For this purpose, we prefer to use a combination of ketamine/xylazine, but as an alternative, isoflurane inhalation can also be applied. Animals can be overdosed with ketamine, so make sure you adjust the dose to weight and start slightly lower than the recommended dose.\nNote: We recommend shaving the mice the day before immunization. This allows the skin to “rebalance” before the injection and speeds up the process of inoculation. This is critical because the LNP/mRNA-LNP is temperature-sensitive, and even if kept on ice, has a short half-life. Thus, if you have a lot of mice to inoculate, shaving them a day before becomes a critical step. The downside of this is that the mice will have to be anesthetized again at the time of inoculation with the vaccine.\nNote: A video with the procedure is available upon request.\nIntradermal inoculation\nTiming: Varies based on skills and number of mice being handled\nThe mice will be intradermally injected.\nDay 0. Inoculate the mice intradermally.\nUsing a 28-gauge syringe aspirate the necessary volume (20 μL/spot).",
    "With two fingers, stretch the skin in the area to be inoculated, and at a very shallow angle with the bevel up, slowly penetrate the skin with the needle. Keep it parallel with the surface and make sure that the opening of the needle is at ∼2 mm into the skin before you inject. Successful intradermal injection of liquid will form a bubble that will stay visible for minutes, and no to minimal liquid will come out at the site of injection.\nLabel the site of injection with a fine permanent marker by drawing a small circle around it.\nRepeat step b, if multiple injections to be performed on the same mouse.\nNote: It is necessary to anesthetize the mice for successful intradermal inoculation. Please see our note above for details. As with any procedure, make sure to record any deviation from the protocol, such as partial inoculation, too deep, etc.\nNote: Do not exceed 20–25 μL/spot. The excess liquid causes physical damage to the tissue, so in general lower volumes are preferred.\nNote: Accurate volumes are critical to minimize variability. We suggest using a syringe with minimal dead space, and even then, make sure to account for the dead space (needle) by filling up that space before measuring the required volume. If you do not want to rely on the accuracy of the syringe, then use a calibrated pipettor to measure the necessary volume and then dispense it on a clean piece of parafilm, then slowly aspirate with the syringe.",
    "Note: The number of injected spots does not have to be 4. Our studies use this strategy to target several primary skin-draining lymph nodes (axillary, brachial, and inguinal). However, if you would like to limit the immune responses to a certain area, then inject there and leave the others undisturbed or for control purposes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (Ndeupen et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCritical: The mRNA-LNPs and the empty LNPs must be kept on ice and injected ∼30 min post-thawing. The leftovers should be discarded. Do not refreeze these reagents. Their efficacy decreases by ∼50% with every freeze and thaw cycle.\nNote: A video on intradermal inoculation is available upon request.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1658-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Depicts different areas to inject to target specific lymph nodes\nGreen: left brachial and axillary lymph nodes. Red: right brachial and axillary lymph nodes. Yellow: left inguinal lymph node. Blue: right inguinal lymph node.\nHarvesting skin samples and single-cell preparation\nTiming: Varies based on skills and number of mice being handled\nThe mice will be euthanized, and single-cell suspensions prepared from the skin samples.\nDay 1. Harvest the skin samples and generate single cell suspension.\nEuthanize the mice following IACUC regulations.\nUsing a ruler draw 1 cm2 around the injection site and cut it out using a sharp scissor.\nTransfer the harvested skin samples into 6-well plate containing 3 mL sterile PBS and keep them on ice until all the samples have been harvested.\nChop the skin samples in small pieces using a curved scissor or two razor blades on clean smooth surface, such as Petri-dish.\nTransfer the chopped skin pieces to a 6-well plate containing 1 mL CHD digestion media/ 1 cm2 (4 mL in total for 4 spots) skin using curved forceps and disperse the skin pieces.",
    "Incubate the plate in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 90 min under continuous shaking at 90 rpm.\nTo further break up the tissue, pipette the solution up and down forcefully using 5 mL serological pipette and filter through a 40 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube. You can use a syringe plunger to aid the filtration and tissue disruption.\nRinse the well and the strainer using 10 mL SM.\nSpin @ 600 g at 4°C for 7 min.\nDecant, resuspend in 1 mL of SM.\nCount the cells and proceed to stain for flow cytometry.\nNote: If you are using transgenic mice, save a small piece from the tail of each mouse and store them at −80°C. This step will help you to confirm the genotype if the results are unexpected.\nNote: The harvested skin samples can be snap frozen and used for genomic analyses, Luminex, histology, etc.\nNote: The cell suspensions can be further used for sorting, in vitro restimulation, and other downstream analyses.\nNote: Skin samples can be harvested at any time after injection. Robust inflammatory responses can be observed one day post inoculation that slowly resolves in 10–14 days.\nNote: A video with the skin harvesting and chopping is available upon request.\nStaining the cell suspension for flow cytometer\nTiming: Varies based on skills and number of samples being handled\nThe cells will be stained for flow cytometer.\nStaining for flow cytometry.\nDistribute 2 × 106 cells/well in round bottom 96-well plate.\nSpin @ 350 g at 4°C for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant using a multichannel pipettor.\nResuspend the cells in your antibody master mix (100 μL/well) and stain on ice in dark for 30–60 min.\nAdd 100 μL of SM and spin @ 350 g at 4°C for 3 min.",
    "Discard the supernatant and repeat the washing step.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL SM and transfer them into flow tubes and proceed to run them on flow cytometer. Please see corresponding flow cytometry staining panels here: (Ndeupen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: It is important to design flow panels adjusted to your flow machine.\nNote: The stained cells can be stored 12–24 h at 4°C in SM without significant signal loss, but for longer storage fixation is recommended.\nNote: Always save the leftover cells and store them at 4°C in SM. They can be stored for at least 24 h, and used to perform extra stains, troubleshooting, etc.\nNote: The number of cells used for staining is not set in stone and can be adjusted to your needs. The staining volume is also flexible. The titration of the antibodies is recommended for the best outcome and efficient use of the reagents.\nIntramuscular inoculation\nTiming: Varies based on skills and number of mice being handled\nThe mice will be intramuscularly injected.\nDay 0. Inoculate the mice intramuscularly.\nAnesthetize the mice.\nPull and stretch mouse lower limb (left or right).\nPosition the needle at approximately 20°C angle relative to the thigh (left or right).\nInsert the needle in the thigh using your dominant hand.\nPalpate the thigh with your other hand to ensure that the needle has been successfully inserted.\nInject 10 μg of mRNA-LNP in 30 μL per mouse.\nNote: Increase in muscle volume indicates successful inoculation.\nNote: As with intradermal inoculation we recommend anesthetizing the mice.\nNote: A video on intramuscular inoculation is available upon request.\nHarvesting muscle samples and single-cell preparation\nTiming: Varies based on skills and number of mice being handled\nThe mice will be euthanized, and single-cell suspensions prepared from the muscle samples.",
    "Day 1. Harvest the muscle samples and generate single cell suspension.\nEuthanize the mice following IACUC regulations.\nSpray the mouse with 70% alcohol and make a crosscut in the belly skin.\nPeel the skin to expose the muscle completely.\nDissect the muscles.\nCollect muscles in cold PBS until ready to proceed with all the samples.\nUsing a curved scissor or two razor blades carefully chop the muscles in small pieces.\nTransfer tissue to a 10 mL Petri dish filled with digestion solution (use 10 mL for 2 g of tissue. Adjust the volume based on tissue weight).\nIncubate in 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 45 min with continuous agitation (90 rpm).\nPipette up and down using a serological pipette and filter through a 40 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube.\nRinse the dish and the cell strainer with 10 mL of SM.\nCentrifuge @ 600 g at 4°C for 7 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of SM, count and proceed with downstream analyses.\nNote: Spraying the mice with ethanol or sterile water is optional but helps to keep the preparation clean and free of hair.\nIntranasal inoculation\nTiming: Varies based on skills and number of mice being handled\nThe mice will be intranasally inoculated.\nDay 0. Anesthetize and inoculate the mice intranasally.\nAnesthetize the mice.\nWith one hand hold the mice straight up.\nPipette 30 μL of reagent with 100 μL pipettor.\nSlowly inoculate the mice through one of their nostrils.\nKeep the mice in an upward position for a few seconds after inoculation and look for two contractions of the chest cavity.\nCheck for bubble formation or sign of distress (coughing or dysphagia).",
    "Note: To perform this technique, it is important to have a steady hand. Find a flat surface to use as support for your elbows.\nCritical: It is imperative to anesthetize mice before performing intranasal inoculation. If mice are not anesthetized, the inoculant will go through the esophagus rather than the respiratory route. The recommended inoculation time is about 8–10 min after injection with the anesthetic. It is also critical to keep the mice in upwards position: 1) the gravity will help the reagent to flow into the lungs; 2) it allows to observe the complete inhalation of the reagent by 2 contractions signs that happen a few seconds after inoculation (please see video for details).\nNote: A video on intranasal inoculation is available upon request.\nHarvesting lungs and single-cell preparation\nTiming: Varies based on skills and number of mice being handled\nThe mice will be euthanized, and single-cell suspensions prepared from the lungs.\nDay 1. Harvest the lungs and generate single cell suspension.\nInject the mice through tail vein with 1–2 μg of anti-CD45.2 or 1 (depends on congenic marker expressed) in 200–300 μL of sterile PBS.\nEuthanize the mice 5 min post injection.\nSpray the mouse with 70% alcohol and make a crosscut in the belly skin.\nPeel the skin to expose the chest area.\nOpen the chest cavity and harvest the lungs in 6-well plate in sterile, cold PBS and keep them on ice until all the lungs have been harvested.\nCut the lungs in small pieces using curved scissor or two razor blades.\nTransfer the samples into a 6-well plate containing 5 mL digestion media and incubate in 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 60 min with continuous agitation (90 rpm).",
    "Pipette up and down using a serological pipette and filter through a 40 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube. Use syringe plunger to help the filtration.\nRinse the dish and the cell strainer with 10 mL of SM.\nCentrifuge @ 600 g at 4°C for 7 min.\nDiscard the supernatant by aspirating carefully using a pipettor.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL ACK, quickly vortex and incubate at 20°C–23°C for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL of SM and centrifuge @ 600 g at 4°C for 7 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of SM, count the cells and proceed with the downstream analyses.\nCritical: If discrimination between blood contaminants and immune cells found in the lungs’ parenchyma is important, then injecting the mice intravenously with a fluorescently labeled common leukocyte marker a few minutes before euthanasia becomes a critical step (Anderson et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: The cell pellet prepared from lung is quite loose, so we recommend aspirating the supernatant instead of discarding it by flipping the tube.\nNote: Intranasal inoculation can also be used to study weight loss and distress caused by the exposure to the LNPs. LNP doses higher than 2.5 μg can cause significant distress to the mice and death.\nNote: A video on lung harvesting and processing is available upon request.\nHarvesting skin draining lymph nodes and generating single-cell suspension\nTiming: Varies based on skills and number of mice being handled\nSkin draining lymph nodes will be harvested and single-cell suspensions generated.\nHarvest skin draining lymph nodes.\nEuthanize the mice following IACUC regulations.\nSpray the mouse with 70% alcohol and make a crosscut in the belly skin.",
    "Pull the skin apart to expose the lymph nodes. Harvest axillary, branchial and inguinal LNs and place them in a 6-well plate with scratched bottom (please see note) containing 2 mL of collagenase D digestion medium.\nUsing the plunger of a 3 mL syringe to crush the lymph nodes against bottom of scratched well.\nIncubate in 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 30 min with continuous shaking at 90 RPM.\nPipette up and down using a serological pipette and filter through a 40 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube.\nRinse the well and the cell strainer with 10 mL of SM.\nCentrifuge @ 600 g at 4°C for 7 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL of SM and count the cells.\nProceed with staining.\nNote: Scratched bottom serves as a rough surface for mechanical grinding/disruption of the lymphoid organs. Scratching can be achieved using an ∼18-gauge needle. Even checkered pattern is preferred.\nNote: We suggest day 7 and day 14 post inoculation, respectively to observe effector T and B cell responses.\nNote: A video on preparing scratched surface, and harvesting skin draining lymph nodes are available upon request."
