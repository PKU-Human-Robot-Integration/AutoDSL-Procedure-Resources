    "Up to 24 h prior to the surgery, perform total body irradiation on the mice to be used with a dose of 2.7 Gy.Pour thymus pieces and medium from the flask into a 60 mm dish. Pour some PBS into another dish.Fill a 1 ml syringe (no needle) with PBS.Chill positive displacement pipette tips by putting them in open sterile tubes in ice. Keep on ice with the dried cell pellets and Matrigel. It is important to keep the Matrigel and any tubes or tips that will touch it cold at all times until the implant needle is loaded.Anesthetize mice: Weigh mice and inject them interperitoneally with 15 μl of Ketamine/Xylazine per gram of body weight.When the mice have become sluggish from the Ketamine/Xylazine, place an animal's nose in a 15 ml conical tube that is stuffed with gauze soaked in isoflurane until the animal loses consciousness, its breathing slows to about half the normal rate, and it no longer responds to a paw pinch. Keep this tube on hand during the surgery to administer more isoflurane if the breathing starts to become more rapid.Punch the animal's ears for numbering or use your own preferred identification method.Using the Oster clipper with No. 40 blade, shave the left side of each mouse from hip to shoulder between the center of the back and the belly.Subcutaneously inject 0.3 ml of the diluted Carprofen up by the animal's shoulder, then place the mouse on a sterile dressing on its right side, facing left.Flush the cannula of the 16 gauge implant needle with PBS.Using a pair of needle-tipped forceps, place a piece of thymus from the dish into the opening of the cannula with the trocar just inside the opening, then pull back on the trocar to aspirate the tissue into the cannula.",
    "Use a positive displacement pipette and a chilled tip to put 5 μl of cold Matrigel into one tube with a dried cell pellet and gently stir just enough to get the cells into suspension. Do not pipette up and down. Pipette the Matrigel/cell suspension into the opening of the cannula as you slowly pull back on the trocar to load the needle. This is much easier with a helper to pipette while you manipulate the implant needle.Swab the bare skin of the mouse with Betadine, then wipe down the area with an isopropanol wipe two times.Determine the darkest spot under the skin, which indicates the location of the spleen. The kidney is approximately 5 mm dorsal to the spleen.Lift up the skin with curved forceps and make an incision about 15 mm long in the skin over the kidney parallel to the spleen. Make a similar cut in the peritoneum layer below.In male mice, the kidney should be visible, and can be extruded simply by pressing on the abdomen. You can support the kidney with a hemostat.In female mice, the ovary blocks the kidney. Using a hemostat, pick up the ovary and drag out the kidney.Use the needle-tipped forceps to pluck a tiny hole (1-2 mm) at the posterior end of the kidney capsule.Slide the implant needle into this hole and along the kidney until the opening of the cannula is completely covered by the kidney capsule.Gently extrude the cells and tissue under the kidney capsule, and pull the needle back out. The thymus pieces can be sticky, so you can use your curved forceps to make sure the thymus piece does not come out with the needle.Lift up the peritoneum with the forceps and gently use the hemostat to push the kidney back into place.",
    "Tie one stitch in the peritoneum with a double knot.Use two autoclips to close the skin.Mix the transduced CD34+ cells saved for injection and suck 150 μl (0.5 x 106 cells) up into an insulin syringe. Inject these cells into the mouse through retroorbital vein injection.Place one drop of PBS onto each eye and lay the mouse on its side back in a cage.When all the mice have been implanted, confirm that the animals are regaining consciousness before leaving them.Post-operational care: The day after the surgery, subcutaneously inject 0.3 ml of diluted Carprofen and 1.2 ml of sterile saline separately into each mouse. On days 2 and 3 following surgery, subcutaneously inject 1.5 ml of sterile saline into each mouse. Monitor the mice and the incisions for 10 days following surgery. Remove the autoclips and weigh the mice after 10 days.After 8-10 weeks, check engraftment by bleeding the mice and performing FACS analysis on the peripheral blood, staining for markers such as CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, and any genes your vector should express. A typical flow cytometry profile, staining for human CD3 (T cell marker) and a transgenic, HIV specific TCR, is provided in Figure 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141021/20141021194314_8637.pngFigure 2. Sample of TCR + Cells in the Peripheral Blood For a visual reference on a similar type of transplantation procedure, please see Vatakis et al., 2012 in the Journal of Visualized Experiments(http://www.jove.com/video/4181/using-blt-humanized-mouse-as-stem-cell-based-gene-therapy-tumor[href=http://www.jove.com/video/4181/using-blt-humanized-mouse-as-stem-cell-based-gene-therapy-tumor])."
