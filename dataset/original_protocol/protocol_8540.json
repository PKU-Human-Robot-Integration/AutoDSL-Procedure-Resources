    "These studies were carried out under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Diego and were in compliance with the Association for Assessment of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines for animal use. All studies were performed in such a manner as to minimize group size and animal suffering.\n1. General Animal and Surgical Preparation\nBefore starting the surgical procedure, thaw the virus (AAV9-UBI-GFP; 5 µL aliquots)8. Prepare a 5% dextran (10,000 MW) solution by mixing dextran powder in distilled water. Mix the virus solution with 5% dextran solution 1:1 to a final dextran concentration of 2.5%.\nStore the virus solution on ice (4 °C).\nUse adult C57BL/6J mice (male and female, 20-30 g). Anesthetize the mice using 5% isoflurane (in O2, 1 L/min) and maintain them at 2-3% inhaled isoflurane (in O2, 1 L/min) by nose cone during surgery, depending on the breathing rate and paw pinch response.\nShave the back of the animals with shaving clippers and clean the skin with 2% chlorhexidine.\nIn chronic recovery studies follow a strict sterile technique.\nIf lumbar subpial injections are to be performed, cut the skin overlaying the Th8-L1 vertebrae with a scalpel and detach the paravertebral muscle from Th10-12 spinal vertebrae using scissors.\nMount the animal into a standard stereotaxic frame using mouse spinal clamps.\nShave the both sides of the lamina of the Th10-12 vertebrae using a dental drill (drill bit: 0.9 mm, speed: 20,000 rpm) until cracks appear.\nRemove cracked bone fragments with forceps and expose the dorsal surface of the lumbar spinal cord.\nCut open the dura about 1 cm using a 30 G stainless steel needle and forceps.",
    "If cervical subpial injections are to be performed, incise the dorsal neck skin 1.5-2 cm using scissors and expose the C1-C2 segments.\nRemove the atlanto-occipital membrane of the cisterna magna using a 23G stainless steel needle and forceps.\nClean the incision site of any tissue and bone debris using cotton swabs.\nCut open the dura about 2-3 mm using a 30 G stainless steel needle and forceps.\n2. Opening the Pial Membrane and Inserting the Subpial Needle for AAV9 Delivery\nMount the 34 G pia-penetrating needle into the Z-arm of an XYZ manipulator using a glass capillary holder (Figure 1A and B).\n\tNOTE: To manufacture the pia-penetrating needle, the original beveled tip of the 34G needle is sharpened using a glass capillary beveller with diamond abrasive plate - coarse (5.0 µm to 50 µm tip sizes) and grinding angle of 15 - 20°. The tip of the needle (1 mm length, measured from the tip) is then gently bent to about 90° (Figure 1B, left insert).\nUsing a surgical dissecting scope, set to 8-10 X magnification, penetrate the pia with the pia-penetrating needle by about 1 mm (Figure 1C) using the X-arm.\nKeep the angle of the penetrating needle to the tissue surface at 5-10°.\nAfter the pia opening, remove the pia-penetrating needle horizontally from the subpial space (Figure 1 D) using the X-arm.\n\tNOTE: Remember the penetrated site by a landmark, such as a blood vessel.\nLoad a blunt 36G injection needle with AAV9-UBI-GFP virus using a 50-µL microsyringe connected to the injection needle with PE-10 or PE-20 tubing.\nMount the needle into the Z-arm of a second XYZ manipulator (Figure 1A and B) using a glass capillary holder (Figure 1B, right insert).",
    "NOTE: To manufacture the subpial AAV9 injection needle, the blunt tip of a 36 G needle is polished using a glass capillary beveller with diamond abrasive plate - coarse (5.0 µm to 50 µm tip sizes) to remove the sharp edges. The tip of the needle (2-3 mm length, measured from the tip) is then gently bent to about 90°. The pia-penetrating and subpial injection needles are inserted into 1-2 cm-long 20G slave stainless steel tubing (10 mm from the end of the needle) and glued with epoxy. The use of 20 G (0.91 mm-diameter) tubing is required for a secure attachment to the glass capillary holder.\nBy manipulating the X, Y, and Z arms of the second manipulator, position the tip of the AAV9 injection needle into the pia-penetrated site and then advance it about 2-3 mm into the subpial space through the previous pial membrane opening using the X-arm ( Figure 1E and F).\n\tNOTE: 1) The AAV9-UBI-GFP is prepared according to previously reported protocols9,10, and the final titers are adjusted to 1.2 x 1013 genome copies per mL (gc/mL). 2) There is no need to mark the site of the pial opening because it is readily identifiable (Figure 1D).\nInject the AAV9-UBI-GFP (1.5, 3, or 5 µL) into the subpial space using a 50 µL microsyringe (see Table 1 for experimental groups).\nRemove the injection needle from the subpial space after the AAV9-UBI-GFP injection is complete.\nClose the muscle and skin using 4.0 monofilament suture and surgical clips.\n\tNOTE: There is no need to seal the open vertebra.\nAllow the animals to recover on a heating pad.\nFor pain control inject Buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg/sc  every 12 h for 2-3 days post-surgery.\n3. Perfusion-fixation, Tissue Cryoprotection, and Immunofluorescence Staining",
    "At a predetermined time point after the subpial AAV9 injections, deeply anesthetize the mice with euthanasia solution (see the Table of Materials, 0.3 mL) and transcardially perfuse them with 20 mL of heparinized saline followed by 20 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.\nDissect the spinal cords and brains using a bone rongeur and post-fix them in 4% formaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C.\nCryoprotect the spinal cords and brains with 30% sucrose in PBS for a minimum of 5-7 days.\nCut coronal, transverse, or longitudinal/horizontal frozen sections (30 µm-thick) on a cryostat and store them in PBS at 4 °C.\n4. Immunofluorescence Staining of Spinal Cord and Brain Sections (See the Table of Materials)\nIncubate free-floating sections in primary antibodies overnight.\nAfter incubation with primary antibodies, wash the sections three times in PBS and incubate with fluorescence-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, donkey anti-chicken, and donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies.\nMount the sections on microscopy slides, dry them at room temperature, and cover them with an anti-fade medium.\nCapture images using epifluorescence fluorescence microscope (objectives: 10X, NA-0.3; 20X, NA-0.8; and 63X, NA-1.4).\nSubscription Required.
