    "1. Preparation of Stock Reagents and Solutions\nPrepare gelling solution components.\n\tNOTE: Solution concentrations are given in g/mL (w/v percent).\n\t\nMake the following stock solutions: 38% (w/v) sodium acrylate (SA), 50% (w/v) acrylamide (AA), 2% (w/v) N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (Bis), and 29.2% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl). Dissolve the compounds in doubly deionized water (ddH2O). Use the amounts in Table 1 as a reference; prepared solutions can be scaled up or down in volume as needed. For example, to make 10 mL of a 38% (w/v) SA solution, add 1.9 g SA to a graduated 10 mL cylinder and add ddH2O to a volume of 5 mL.\nPrepare 9.4 mL of monomer solution at a 1.06x concentration as shown in Table 1.\nNOTE: This will result in a 1x concentration after addition of the initiator, accelerator, and inhibitor. The monomer stock can be stored at 4 °C for up to 3 months, or at -20 °C for long-term storage.\nPrepare the following stock solutions separately in ddH2O: 0.5% (w/v) of the inhibitor 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (4HT), which inhibits gelation to enable diffusion of the gelling solution into tissues, 10% (v/v) of the initiator tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), which accelerates radical generation by ammonium persulfate (APS), and 10% (w/v) APS which initiates the gelling process.\nNOTE: Stock solutions of 4HT and TEMED can be prepared in 1 mL aliquots and stored at -20 °C for at least 6 months. APS has been found to lose efficacy after long-term storage and is best prepared in small quantities (<0.1 mL) immediately before gelling.",
    "Prepare digestion buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% [w/v] nonionic surfactant, 0.8 M NaCl) by combining 25 mL of 1 M Tris pH 8 (3.03 g of Tris base in 25 mL of ddH2O), 25 mL of EDTA (0.5 M pH 8), 2.25 g of nonionic surfactant, and 23.38 g of NaCl. Add ddH2O for a total volume of 500 mL.\nNOTE: The solution can be scaled up or down as needed and be stored in at 4 °C. Proteinase K (ProK) will be added immediately before the digestion step.\nPrepare 20 mM sodium citrate solution by combining 2.941 g of sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate with 500 mL of ddH2O and adjusting pH to 8.0 at room temperature (RT). Scale the volume of stock as needed.\nPrepare a stock solution of 6-((acryloyl)amino)hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (acryloyl-X, SE; AcX), the anchoring compound. Dissolve AcX in 500 µL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for a final concentration of 10 mg/mL.\nNOTE: The solution can be stored in a desiccated environment at -20 °C in 20 µL aliquots.\nIf not using commercially available buffers for immunostaining, prepare blocking buffer. Use a blocking buffer of 5% (v/v) normal animal serum and 0.1% (w/v) nonionic surfactant in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and select the serum based on the host animal of the secondary antibodies. For example, to prepare 500 mL blocking buffer for antibodies raised in goat, combine 25 mL of goat serum, 0.45 g of nonionic surfactant, and 1x PBS to a volume of 500 mL.\n2. Preparation of Archived and Freshly Prepared Clinical Tissue Slides for ExPath",
    "Convert the tissue into an ExPath compatible format. Choose one of the four following steps (2.1.1−2.1.4) based on how the specimen was prepared: FFPE slides, stained FFPE slides, or unfixed or fixed frozen tissue slides in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) solution.\n\tNOTE: These are based on standard recovery steps for pathology samples and are not specific to the ExPath protocol.\n\t\nFFPE clinical samples\n\t\t\nPrepare 30 mL of 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and 50% ethanol. Measure out 30 mL of xylene, 100% ethanol, and ddH2O.\nPlace the slide with the sample in a 50 mL conical using forceps and add 15 mL of xylene. Cap the tube and place it horizontally on an orbital shaker at approximately 60 rpm and incubate at RT for 3 min for each solution. Repeat with the remaining 15 mL xylene.\nRepeat step 2.1.1.2 with 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and ddH2O in place of xylene.\nStained and mounted permanent slides\n\t\t\nPlace the slide in a 100 mm Petri dish and cover with xylene. Carefully remove the coverslip using a razor blade. If the coverslip is not easily removed, return the slide to the xylene until the coverslip loosens.\nProcess using the steps for FFPE samples (steps 2.1.1.1−2.1.1.3).\nNOTE: In the case of H&E stained slides, the stains are eliminated during the expansion process.\nUnfixed frozen tissue slides in OCT solution\n\t\t\nFix the tissue in acetone at -20 °C for 10 min.\nWash the samples with 1x PBS solution 3 times for 10 min each at RT.\nPreviously fixed, frozen clinical tissue slides\n\t\t\nIncubate the slides for 2 min at RT to melt the OCT solution.\nWash the sample with 1x PBS solution 3 times for 5 min each at RT.\nPerform heat treatment for antigen retrieval on all samples after format conversion.",
    "Add 20 mM citrate solution (pH 8 at RT) in a heat resistant container, such as a slide staining jar.\nNOTE: There should be enough solution to cover the tissue mounted on the slide (50 mL for a standard slide staining jar).\nHeat the citrate solution to 100 °C in the microwave and place the slide in the solution. Immediately transfer the container to an incubation chamber and incubate at 60 °C for 30 min.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Slides can be placed in Petri dishes and covered in 1x PBS and stored at 4 °C.\nStain the sample using standard immunofluorescence (IF)/immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining protocols.\n\tNOTE: Specific primary and secondary antibody concentrations and staining durations are dependent on the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer or by optimization for the specific experiment.\n\t\nUse a hydrophobic pen to draw a boundary around the tissue section(s) on the slide to minimize the volume of solution needed to cover the tissue. Place the slide in a dish large enough to fit the slide. For a standard 3-inch slide, use a 100 mm Petri dish.\nNOTE: The hydrophobic pen does not interfere with the polymerization of the sample nor the digestion process.\nIncubate the tissue with blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, 2 h at RT, or 4 °C overnight to reduce nonspecific binding.\nDilute primary antibodies to the desired concentration in the appropriate amount of prepared blocking buffer (or other preferred staining buffer). Incubate the tissues with the primary antibody solution for at least 3 h at RT or 37 °C, or overnight at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Samples should be placed in a humidified container (such as a Petri dish with a damp wipe) to prevent the tissue from drying out. Typically, antibodies have been diluted to 1:100−1:500 in 200−500 µL of buffer, depending on the tissue size and antibody used.\nWash the tissue with prepared blocking buffer (or other preferred washing buffer) 3 times for 10 min at RT.\nDilute secondary antibodies (and 300 nM 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI] if desired), in prepared blocking buffer (or other preferred staining buffer) to a concentration of approximately 10 µg/mL. Incubate the tissue in the secondary antibody solution for at least 1 h at RT or 37 °C.\nNOTE: Timing may be adjusted depending on the antibodies used and the thickness of the tissue. Secondary antibodies containing cyanine dyes (Cy3, Cy5, Alexa 647) are not compatible with the ExM protocol when applied pre-polymerization. Suggested dyes include Alexa 488 (green), Alexa 546 (orange/red), and Atto 647N or CF633 (far-red). DAPI must be reapplied after expansion, as it is washed away during the expansion process.\nWash the tissue with prepared blocking buffer (or other preferred washing buffer) 3 times for 10 min each at RT.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Slides can be placed in Petri dishes and covered in 1x PBS and stored at 4 °C.\nPerform fluorescent imaging using a conventional wide-field microscope, confocal microscope, or other imaging system of choice.\nNOTE: This step is required to determine biological length using the expansion factor by comparing pre- and post-expansion images. To facilitate post-expansion imaging, easily identifiable regions of interest should be selected and images at both low and high magnification should be collected.\n3. In Situ Polymerization of Specimens\nIncubate the specimen in anchoring solution.",
    "Prepare the anchoring solution (typically 250 µL is enough to cover the tissue section) by diluting the AcX stock solution in 1x PBS to a concentration of 0.03 mg/mL for samples fixed with non-aldehyde fixatives or 0.1 mg/mL for samples fixed with aldehyde fixatives, which have fewer free amines available to react with AcX.\nPlace the slide in a 100 mm Petri dish and pipette the anchoring solution over the tissue. Incubate for at least 3 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C.\nIncubate the samples in gelling solution.\nPrepare at least 100-fold excess volume of gelling solution. Per 200 µL, combine the following, in order: 188 µL of monomer solution, 4 µL of 0.5% 4HT stock solution (1:50 dilution, final concentration: 0.01%), 4 µL of 10% TEMED stock solution (1:50 dilution, final concentration 0.2%), and 4 µL of 10% APS stock solution (1:50 dilution, final concentration 0.2%).\nNOTE: Gelling solution should be made immediately before use. The solution should be kept at 4 °C and the APS solution should be added last, to prevent premature gelling.\nRemove excess solution from the tissue section and place the slide in a 100 mm Petri dish. Add fresh, cold gelling solution to the sample and incubate the mixture on the tissue for 30 min at 4 °C, to allow diffusion of solution into the tissue.\nConstruct a chamber on the slide around the sample (Figure 2A) without disturbing the gelling solution.\nMake spacers for the gelling chamber by thinly cutting pieces of cover glass using a diamond knife.",
    "NOTE: To facilitate imaging post expansion, the spacers should be close in thickness to the tissue specimen to reduce the amount of blank gel above the tissue. Number 1.5 glass can be used for standard clinical samples (5−10 µm). Cover glass pieces can be stacked for thicker samples.\nSecure the spacers on either side of the tissue using droplets of water (~10 µL).\nCarefully place a cover glass lid over the slide, making sure to avoid trapping air bubbles over the tissue (Figure 2B).\nIncubate the sample at 37 °C in a humidified environment (such as a closed Petri dish with a damp wipe) for 2 h.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. The slide chamber can be stored inside a sealed Petri dish at 4 °C.\n4. Sample Digestion\nRemove the lid of the gelling chamber by gently sliding a razor blade under the coverslip and slowly lifting the coverslip off the gel surface. Trim the blank gel around the tissue to minimize volume. Cut the gel asymmetrically to track the orientation of the gel after homogenization, since the sample will become transparent.\nDilute ProK by 1:200 in digestion buffer (final concentration 4 U/mL) before use. Prepare enough solution to completely submerge the gel; a single well of a four-well plastic cell culture plate requires at least 3 mL per well.\nIncubate the sample in a closed container containing the digestion buffer for 3 h at 60 °C. If the sample does not detach from the slide during digestion, use a razor blade to gently remove the sample.\nNOTE: The specimen should be completely submerged in digestion buffer to prevent the sample from drying out and placed in a covered container (small slide box, plastic well, Petri dish, etc.) that can be sealed with film.",
    "5. Sample Expansion and Imaging\nUse a soft paint brush to transfer the specimen into 1x PBS in a container compatible with the desired imaging system and large enough to accommodate the fully expanded gel. Make sure that the tissue is placed with the sample-side down if imaging on an inverted system or up if imaging on an upright system to minimize the distance from the imaging objective to the sample. Flip the gel using a soft paint brush if needed.\nNOTE: Side-illumination from an LED can be used to make them visible in liquid. A standard 6-well plate can accommodate samples that have a pre-expanded diameter less than 0.6 cm. A glass bottom well plate should be used for imaging on an inverted system.\nWash the samples in 1x PBS at RT for 10 min. If desired, re-stain the sample with 300 nM DAPI as the digestion process washes away the DAPI stain. Remove PBS and stain with 300 nM DAPI diluted in 1x PBS for 20 min at RT, followed by a 10 min wash with 1x PBS at RT.\nNOTE: The samples can be covered with 1x PBS and stored at 4 °C before proceeding to the next step.\nTo expand the samples, replace the PBS and wash with an excess volume of ddH2O (at least 10x the final gel volume) 3−5 times for 10 min each, at RT.\nNOTE: After the 3rd or 4th wash, the specimen’s expansion should begin to plateau. For storage, to prevent bacterial growth, the ddH2O can be supplemented with 0.002%−0.01% sodium azide (NaN3). In this case, the final expansion factor is reversibly reduced by 10%.\nPerform fluorescence imaging using a conventional wide-field microscope, confocal microscope, or other imaging system of choice.",
    "NOTE: To prevent gels from drifting, excess liquid can be removed from the well. Gels can also be immobilized with 1.5−2% low-melt agarose. Prepare 1.5−2%(w/v) low-melt agarose in water in a container 2−4 times the volume of solution. Warm the solution in a 40 °C water bath or in a microwave for 10−20 s to melt the solution. Pipette the melted agarose around the edges of the gel. After allowing the agarose to harden at RT or 4 °C, add water to the sample to prevent dehydration.\nSubscription Required.
