  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were in accordance with Brown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.\n1. Gait analysis apparatus\nPrepare the gait analysis walkway consisting of a clear plexiglass enclosed walkway (36” L x 3” W x 4.5” H) placed on a clear plexiglass floor (Figure 2A). Make the plexiglass floor semitransparent by covering it with a piece of 16 LB cotton fiber drafting vellum cut to the same width as the walkway. \n\tNOTE: There are other methods for making the floor semitransparent.\nPlace a camera with a frame rate of at least 30 frames per second (fps) directly below the walkway to capture the middle of the track (Figure 2B).\nSecure a strip of 12 V LED lights with 18 LEDs/foot approximately 2 inches away from and 1 inch above the floor of the walkway to illuminate the track.\n2. Animal preparation\nAllow the animals to acclimate to the vivarium for at least 1 week prior to handling. Handle the rats for at least 5 days prior to beginning experiment. This study used 8 male Long Evans rats approximately 3 months old.\nHabituate the animals to the testing room and gait walkway with the room lights turned off\nPlace the rat’s home cage at the surface level at the end of the gait walkway to serve as a goal box. Note that if the home cage is deep, aged or locomotor-impaired rats may benefit from a ramp or step to provide easier access to the home cage.\nAllow the rat to walk from the experimenter’s hand down the length of the walkway to reach its home cage.",
    "Rats will often stop at the end of the walkway to look around before jumping down into the home cage. If a rat takes longer than 1 min to exit the walkway, encourage it to enter its home cage with a gentle push.\nIf the rat turns around, use a small piece of plexiglass to block the “start” end of the walkway. Repeat for a total of 3 runs.\nHabituate for at least 2 days or until the rats are comfortable crossing the walkway at a steady pace without freezing.\n3. Gait testing procedure\nAdjust the settings on the webcam software to achieve the clearest picture of the paw prints. Turn off room lights for all gait testing.\nRecord each run separately and label appropriately for use with the automated analysis program.\nEnsure there are no spots or debris on the vellum. Begin recording a few seconds before the rat enters the walkway and stop once the rat exits the walkway and enters its home cage.\nContinue until either three acceptable runs are completed or 10 min has elapsed.\nWipe down the walkway with ethanol in between each rat and replace the vellum as needed.\n\tNOTE: An acceptable trial is defined as one in which the animal walks consistently and without pause for the first 4 steps of the run. If this is hard to achieve, adjust the criteria to include trials in which there are 4 consecutive steps at any point in the run that occur without pauses or abrupt acceleration.\n4. PrAnCER automated analysis\nPut all videos to be analyzed in a folder.\nLaunch PrAnCER by running the Python script PrAnCER. PrAnCER will analyze the videos based on the steps illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure 4.",
    "In the pop-up menu, select the specified folder by pressing the Choose a folder button. Select custom options for analysis if desired. Detailed descriptions of each parameter can be found by clicking the question mark next to them. Click Continue when finished.\nDefine a region of interest (ROI) on the image of the walkway that appears. To do this, left click to define a top edge and right click to define a bottom edge. If the box that appears is correct, press N to continue. If not, press Z to undo. Once N is pressed, the program will run automatically.\nAfter PrAnCER is complete, terminate the program by pressing Enter in the terminal.\nTo manually review the results output by PrAnCER, run the Python script GaitEditorGUI and select the appropriate .mp4 file for each video. If needed, correct any mis-identified or merged prints.\nTo extract spatial and temporal gait parameters, run the Python script ParameterAnalyzer. Choose the number of hind prints to analyze and the folder of videos to analyze, then click Continue. This will output a .csv file for each video containing a number of common gait parameters, which are described in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 5.\n\tNOTE: The full scripts, as well as instructions for reading and analyzing data, are available at the author’s GitHub (www.github.com/hayleybounds). We implemented this algorithm using the free, open-source Python library OpenCV21. Also included on the GitHub are instructions for building our gait analysis walkway."
