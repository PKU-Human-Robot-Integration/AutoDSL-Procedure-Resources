    "Ethics statement: Our physician-approved protocol meets the requirements of the Ethical Committee of the Department of Psychology at the University of Amsterdam for testing human participants.\n1. Attachment of the Fear Potentiated Startle and Shock Electrodes\nEnsure the experimental setting consists out of a sound-attenuated participants’ room and a separated experimenter room.\nUse two computers with four screens for recording and monitoring physiological responses as well as for presenting the experimental script to the participants.\nAttach the double-sided adhesive collars to the EMG electrodes.\nClean the participant’s skin below the right or left eye and on the forehead using an alcohol swab. Instruct the participants to keep their eyes closed to avoid potential eye irritation.\nFill the center of the EMG electrodes with highly conductive electrolyte gel using a syringe. Do not try to fill the electrodes by applying small amounts of gel successively as this increases the risk of air bubbles within the gel, which may affect the recordings negatively.\nAttach one of the EMG electrodes below the lower eyelid of the right or left eye in line with the pupil in forward gaze. Attach the second one approximately 1 - 2 cm lateral to the first following the curvature of the lower eyelid. Attach a ground reference on the forehead approximately 1 cm below the hairline. Optimal placement of the electrodes relative to the muscle may require individual adjustments.\nApply a drop of the conductive gel on the shock electrodes and attach them on the left upper wrist using nylon Velcro strap. Make sure the strap is not on too tight.\nAdjust the intensity of the 2-msec electric shock for each participant individually. Inform the participants that the shock should be “uncomfortable but not painful”.",
    "Manually trigger the shocks. Start at an intensity of 1 mA and continue triggering single shocks — gradually increasing the intensity in 2 or 3 mA increments — until the participant indicates that the shock is “uncomfortable but not painful”.\nWrite down the final shock level and maintain this level throughout the remainder of the experiment.\n2. Fear Acquisition - Day 1\nDuration about 45 min.\nInstruct the participants about the delivery of shocks and the possible administration of propranolol HCl. Further inform them that propranolol HCl is used to treat hypertension. Obtain written informed consent.\nScreen the participants regarding their health and any conditions that would contra-indicate taking a single dose of 40 mg of propranolol HCl: pregnancy, seizure disorder, respiratory disorder, cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular diseases in first-line relatives, diabetes, liver or kidney disorder, current use of an anti-depressant drug, or psychosis.\nObtain blood pressures and heart rate measurements using an electronic sphygmomanometer. Ask the participants to remove their arm from the sleeves and put the inflatable cuff securely on the upper arm. Instruct the participants to relax and sit with their arm slightly bent on the same level as their heart and resting comfortably on a table or other flat surface. BP should be above 90/60 mmHg and heart rate above 60 BPM for inclusion in the experiment.\nAdminister the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory42 and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index43 when a participant is medically cleared. Also administer the Spider Phobic Questionnaire44 when using pictures of spiders as the conditioned stimuli.\nPosition the participants in front of a computer screen and attach the EMG and shock electrodes (see section 1 \"Attachment of the Fear Potentiated Startle and Shock Electrodes\").",
    "Use two different learning procedures — see steps 2.6.1 and 2.6.2. Inform the participants about the two different pictures they will see on the computer screen. Instruct them to monitor the relationship between the pictures they are seeing and when a shock is received.\n\t\nNon-Asymptotic Learning: Inform the participants that one of the pictures will be followed by the electric shock in most cases whereas the other will never be followed by the shock.\nAsymptotic Learning: Inform the participants which of the two pictures will always be followed by the electric shock and which picture will never be followed by the shock (i.e., instructed fear learning).\nInform the participants about the loud noises they will hear through the headphones. Order them to pay no attention to the noises.\nInstruct the participants to report the expectancy of an electric shock during the presentation of all pictures by shifting a cursor on continuous rating scales by using a mouse and to push the left mouse button within 5 sec following stimulus onset in order to confirm their expectancy. Ensure scales consist of 11-points labeled from “certainly no electric shock” through “uncertain” to “certainly an electric shock”. Present the scales continuously at the bottom of the computer screen in order to support the participants to focus their attention on the pictures. When the pictures disappear the cursor should automatically return to the “uncertain” position.\nDirect the participants to keep their eyes on the screen and sit as still as possible with both arms placed in a relaxed position with wrists up on the desk in front of them. Put on the headphones. Dim the lights and shut the door. Start the experiment from the other room.",
    "During fear acquisition one of the two pictures co-terminates with the shock: CS1, whereas the other one is never followed by the shock: CS2. Make use of fear relevant stimuli in order to strengthen the fear association during acquisition. For instance pictures of spiders: IAPS numbers 1200 - 1201.\nPresent both the CS1 and CS2 for 8 sec. Loud noises or startle probes — 40 msec and 104 dB — are presented 7 sec after CS onset; and for the CS1, these are followed by the 2-msec electric shock 500 msec later.\nStart the actual fear learning by presenting ten baseline startle probes to diminish initial startle reactivity:\n\t\nNon-Asymptotic Learning: Present a total of 8 CS1 trials on a 75% reinforcement scheme: 6 CS1 trials are reinforced by a shock — the first and the fifth trial are unreinforced. Further present 8 CS2 trials as well as 8 NA trials during the inter-trial-intervals.\nAsymptotic Learning: Present a total of 3 CS1 trials on a 100% reinforcement scheme: all CS1 trials are reinforced by a shock. Further present 3 CS2 trials as well as 3 noise alone startle probes (NA) during the inter-trial-intervals.\nCounterbalance the assignment of the pictures as CS1 and CS2 across participants. Randomize the order of trial type within blocks of CS1 - CS2 - NA such that no trial-type repeats more than two times. Vary the inter-trial-intervals — during which participants view a black screen — between 15 sec 20 sec and 25 sec with a mean of 20 sec.\nAfter completion of the experiment detach the electrodes and let the participants clean off the gel.\nInstruct the participants to judge the pleasantness of the shock on 11-point rating scales ranging from minus 5 (i.e., unpleasant) to 5 (i.e., pleasant).",
    "Explicitly instruct the participants to remember what they had learned during fear acquisition in order to augment retention of the CS-US contingency the following days as well as to prevent them from erroneously expecting a different contingency scheme during subsequent testing. Furthermore, to facilitate the salivary samples the next day, instruct the participants to refrain from exercise caffeine and alcohol during the 12 hr and to avoid food and drinks other than water as well as smoking and tooth brushing during the 2 hr prior to the next session.\nClean the electrodes thoroughly with water after usage: get rid of all the gel without scratching any portion of the AgCl layer. After cleaning do not wipe off the water but use a different set of electrodes on the next participant and allow the other set to dry over time.\n3. Memory Reactivation - Day 2\nDuration about 105 min.\nRandomly assign the participants to either the propranolol HCl or placebo pill condition with the restriction that conditions are matched on STAI scores as close as possible given that trait anxiety determines the fear-reducing effects of disrupting reconsolidation45. Match the participants on SPQ scores as well when using pictures of spiders as the conditioned stimuli.\nObtain blood pressures and heart rate measurements as well as salivary samples: instruct the participants just to place the swab in their mouths for about 3 min. Keep the Salivettes at minus 25°C after removal.\nFor the propranolol no-reactivation condition go to step 4.8.1.\nPosition the participants in front of the computer screen and attach the EMG and shock electrodes (see section 1 \"Attachment of the Fear Potentiated Startle and Shock Electrodes\"). Report to the participants that the intensity of shock will remain the same.",
    "Inform the participants that the same two pictures will be presented on the computer screen and ask them to remember what they had learned the previous day — one of the pictures will again be followed by the electric shock in either most (i.e., non-asymptotic learning) or all (i.e., asymptotic learning) cases whereas the other will never be followed by the shock. Instruct the participants to report the expectancy of an electric shock during the presentation of all pictures. Put on the headphones and dim the lights. Shut the door and start the experiment from the other room.\nBegin the memory reactivation by presenting 10 baseline startle probes to diminish initial startle reactivity. Next present a single unreinforced CS1 trial followed by a single NA trial.\nDetach the participants from the experimental set-up and let them clean off the gel. Seat them behind the other table.\nAdminister “double-blind” an oral dose of placebo pill or 40 mg of propranolol HCl. Pills should be blinded by a pharmacy or colleague independent of the study. Further a physician on call with knowledge of the protocol is considered necessary after drug administration.\n\t\nAdminister “single-blind” an oral dose of 40 mg of propranolol HCl for the propranolol no-reactivation condition.\nInsert a resting period of about 90 min. Offer the participants magazines to read. Clean the electrodes in the meantime.\nAgain obtain BP and heart rate measurements as well as salivary samples.\n4. Test - Day 3\nDuration about 45 min.\nObtain BP and heart rate measurements.\nPosition the participants in front of the computer screen and attach the EMG and shock electrodes. Again report to the participants that the intensity of shock will remain the same.",
    "Instruct the participants that the same two pictures will be presented on the computer screen. Again instruct the participants to report the expectancy of an electric shock during the presentation of all pictures. Put on the headphones and dim the lights. Shut the door and start the experiment from the other room.\nStart the experiment by presenting 10 baseline startle probes. During extinction present about 12 unreinforced CS1 and CS2 trials as well as 12 NA trials. After extinction participants get three unsignaled USs: reinstatement. Again present the participants with about 4 unreinforced CS1 and CS2 trials as well as 4 NA trials following the unsignaled USs: reinstatement testing.\nDetach the electrodes and let participants clean off the gel. Pay the participants a small amount for their participation in the experiment. Clean the electrodes thoroughly with water."
