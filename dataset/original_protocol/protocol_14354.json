    "No ethical approval was required for this study.\n1. Subculture and inoculum preparation for Candida glabrata\nSelect a panel of C.glabrata isolates to be studied which should also include at least one C. glabrata American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) with known susceptibility pattern.\nSubculture an isolate by touching a single colony using a sterile disposable plastic loop and streaking onto a Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) plate8.\nIncubate the SDA plate for 24-48 h at 35 °C for pure culture of isolate with good growth.\n2. Determination of Antifungal Susceptibility\nUse a sterile disposable plastic loop to pick 4-5 colonies of approximately 1 mm diameter from a freshly subcultured C. glabrata isolate on SDA plate. Resuspend in 3 mL of sterile distilled water. Mix well by gentle pipetting to obtain uniform suspension.\nAdjust the cell density to 0.5 McFarland which is equivalent to 1 x 106 to 5 x 106 cells/mL using a densitometer 8.\nPerform susceptibility testing using commercial assay (see Table of Materials and Reagents) on all C. glabrata isolates following manufacturer's instructions. Interpret the susceptibility of isolates based on resultant MICs of antifungal drugs according to CLSI guidelines and prepare report (Table 1)8.\n3. Genomic DNA extraction for sequencing\nResuspend a loopful of colonies from a freshly grown SDA plate in 300 µL of 50 mM EDTA in a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 40 µL of zymolyase (10 mg/mL) to the suspension, and gently pipet 5 times until suspension is uniform.\nIncubate the sample at 37 °C for 1-2 h to digest the cell wall. Cool at room temperature for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 14,000 × g for 2 min and then carefully remove the supernatant.\nExtract genomic DNA following DNA extraction kit guidelines (see Table of Materials).",
    "Resuspend extracted DNA pellet in 50 µL of 10 mM Tris Buffer (pH 7.5-8.5) instead of the elution buffer provided in the kit.\nCheck the purity of DNA by measurement of optical density (O.D) at 260/280 nm25.\n4. Genomic DNA quantification\nPrepare a 1x Tris EDTA (TE) buffer provided in the assay kit based on manufacturer's guidelines for the fluorescence assay (see Table of Materials).\nDilute the DNA sample by adding 2 µL to 98 µL of 1x TE assay buffer (final volume of 100 µL, dilution factor 1:50) in a disposable 96 well plate. This dilution step can be performed either manually using a multichannel pipette or by automated liquid handling workstation.\nPrepare the range of standards by diluting the lambda DNA (100 µg/mL) provided in the fluorescence assay kit (Table 2) and include for measurement along with samples.\nAdd 100 µL of the fluorescent dye to 100 µL diluted DNA samples and standards for the reaction.

When the sample reaches 10 °C, proceed immediately to neutralize.\nAdd 5 µL of neutralization buffer to the plate to neutralize the amplicon reaction, and gently pipette mix. Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 15 µL of indexing PCR mastermix to the samples.\nUse a box of index primer tubes available for a setup of 96-well plate format so that each sample gets a unique combination of indices based on index template ( Table 3).\nArrange the index primer tubes in the index plate rack (Figure 1B) using the order provided in the template on Table 3 and record the position of the indices on the template.\nPlace the tagmentation plate with added PCR mastermix on the index plate rack with the index tubes in order.\nPut index primer 1 tubes in vertical arrangement, and index primer 2 tubes in horizontal arrangement on the index rack. Using a multichannel pipette, carefully add 5 µL of index primers to each sample.\nReplace old caps of index tubes with new caps to avoid cross-contamination between indices.\nSeal the plate using 96-well clear plate sealers and perform the second PCR as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 12 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 5 min.\nPCR Cleanup\nTransfer the PCR product for PCR-cleanup, from the tagmentation plate to a deep-well plate (see Table of Materials).",

Remove excess ethanol if any.\nRemove the plate from the magnetic stand and add 52.5 µL of resuspension buffer to the beads.\nShake the plate on a microplate shaker at 1800 rpm for 2 min and incubate at room temperature for 2 min without shaking.\nPlace the plate on the magnetic stand and allow the supernatant to clear.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, carefully transfer 50 µL of the supernatant from the cleanup plate to a new hard-shell plate.\nLibrary Normalization\nThaw library normalization reagents according to manufacturer's guidelines (see Table of Materials).\nTransfer 20 µL of the supernatant from the cleanup plate to a new deep-well plate.\nAdd 45 µL of magnetic bead suspension and seal the plate with a plate sealer.\nShake the plate on a microplate shaker at 1800 rpm for 30 min. This incubation time is critical and should not be exceeded.\nPlace the plate on a magnetic stand for 2 min and confirm that the supernatant has cleared (Figure 1B).",
    "Remove and discard the supernatant in an appropriate hazardous waste container with the plate still on the magnetic stand.\nRemove the plate from the magnetic stand and wash the beads with 45 µL wash buffer.\nShake the plate with wash buffer on a microplate shaker at 1800 rpm for 5 min.\nPlace plate on magnetic stand for 2 min and discard supernatant when it turns clear.\nRemove the plate from the magnetic stand and repeat the wash with wash buffer again.\nRemove the plate from the magnetic stand and add 30 µL of 0.1 N NaOH.\nShake the plate with 0.1 N NaOH on a microplate shaker at 1800 rpm for 5 min and place the plate on the magnetic stand for 2 min or until the liquid is clear.\nAdd 30 µL of elution buffer to each well of a new 96-well hard-shell thin wall final normalized library plate.\nTransfer 30 µL of supernatant from normalization plate to final normalized library plate to make final volume 60 µL. The libraries are now ready to be sequenced.\nDetermination of DNA Library Concentration by qPCR\nThaw the mastermix, primers and standards provided in the qPCR kit according to manufacturer's guidelines (see Table of Materials).\nCombine the PCR reagent mastermix and primer provided in the qPCR kit following manufacturer's instructions and aliquots can be stored at -20 °C.\nTo determine the DNA library concentration, make a 1/8000 dilution of the DNA libraries using 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8) by performing a 1:100 dilution (1.5 µL DNA library to 148.5 µL Tris buffer) followed by a 1:80 dilution (2 µL from 1:100 to 158 µL Tris buffer).\nShake the dilution plate at 700 rpm for at least 1 min and then centrifuge at 14000 × g for 1 min.",
    "Prepare 20 µL of final PCR reaction by mixing 4 µL of diluted DNA library or DNA standards and 16 µL of mastermix.\nPerform PCR following manufacturer's settings in thermocycler: 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 45 s, and final 65 °C to 95 °C for melt curve analysis.\nObtain the Ct values of the sample DNA libraries and standards from the qPCR thermocycler.\nGenerate a standard curve from the Ct value of the standards (Figure 2). Define the upper and lower QC range by ± 3 cycles from the mean. For example, if the mean Ct value is 13 cycles then the QC range is between 16 and 10 cycles.\nDetermine the individual and average library concentrations (ALC) from the standard curve and Ct values.\nDetermine volume of total pooled libraries (PAL) to be used based on calculation given below for final sequencing considering that target library concentration is between 1.4-1.8 pM.\nNote: Average library concentration obtained from qPCR= ALC; Total Pooled Libraries (PAL) = ALC / 2; Denatured PAL (DAL) = PAL * 0.666\n\t\tDepending on the volume of DAL that is mixed with buffer, is the concentration of library to be added to the flow cell. For example, if 65 µL of library is added to 835 µL of buffer, then from this dilution (Dil 1) 195 is added to a total volume of 1300 µL: (65/900) * dnPAL = Dil1\n\t\tDil1 * (195/1300) = Final Concentration (should be between 1.4-1.8 pM)\n6.
