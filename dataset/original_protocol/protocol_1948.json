    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreliminary analysis\nRppH treatment\nTiming: 4 h\nExhaustive pretreatment of the cellular RNA with RppH generates a control sample in which the 5′ end of the transcript of interest is fully monophosphorylated. In the preliminary stage of analysis, this allows the visualization of transcripts that are predominantly triphosphorylated or capped. Additionally, in the final, quantitative stage of analysis, this control enables the percentage of RNA 5′ ends that are monophosphorylated to be determined by making it possible to correct mathematically for transcript-dependent differences in ligation efficiency.\nAssemble the RppH reaction mixtures.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_3.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nAdd 130 μL of 3 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), extract with phenol/chloroform (pH 4.3), and ethanol precipitate the RNA.\nAdd an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (pH 4.3) and mix by shaking.\nCentrifuge at 15,000×g for 5 min at room temperature. Collect the aqueous (upper) layer and transfer it to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1/10th volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 3 volumes of ethanol. Vortex and incubate at −20°C for 15 min.\nPause point: At this point the samples can be stored indefinitely at −20°C.\nCentrifuge at 15,000×g for 30 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 800 μL of 70% ethanol and centrifuge at 15,000×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and air dry the RNA pellets until no liquid is visible.\nDissolve the RNA pellets in 10 μL of sterile water.\nPause point: At this point the samples can be stored indefinitely at −20°C.\nLigation of a chimeric oligonucleotide\nTiming: 4 h",
    "This step uses T4 RNA ligase 1 to ligate a chimeric oligonucleotide to the 5′ end of transcripts that are monophosphorylated (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Comprising 41 deoxyribonucleotides and three 3′-terminal ribonucleotides, this chimeric oligonucleotide is long enough to encompass the sequences of two nested forward primers (primers A and B) (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The three ribonucleotides at its 3′ end are required for T4 RNA ligase 1 to efficiently ligate the oligonucleotide to 5′-monophosphorylated RNA, while the inclusion of deoxyribonucleotides lowers the cost of synthesis.\nAssemble the ligation mixtures for the mock-treated and RppH-treated cellular RNA samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_4.csv\nIncubate at 65°C for 5 min and then transfer to ice for 1 min.\nAdd 14 μL of ligase master mix to each tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_6.csv\nMix thoroughly and incubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nAdd 125 μL of 3 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), extract with phenol/chloroform (pH 4.3), and ethanol precipitate as described in step 3. Dissolve the RNA pellets in 11.5 μL of sterile water.\nPause point: At this point the samples can be stored indefinitely at −20°C.\nReverse transcription\nTiming: 2 h\nReverse transcription with a transcript-specific primer generates cDNA complementary to a 5′-terminal segment of the RNA of interest and the chimeric oligonucleotide to which the RNA has been ligated (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_7.csv\nTransfer the ligated RNA sample to a 0.2-mL thin-walled PCR tube and mix with primer X and the dNTP mix. Incubate at 65°C for 5 min and transfer to ice for 1 min.\nPrepare a master mix containing reverse transcriptase buffer, DTT, RNasin, and reverse transcriptase, and combine it with the nucleic acid mixture.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_8.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_9.csv\nTransfer the tube to a thermocycler with a heated lid. Incubate at 55°C for 1 h and then at 70°C for 15 min.",
    "Pause point: At this point the samples can be stored indefinitely at −20°C.\nAmplification\nTiming: 6 h\nTwo rounds of PCR with nested primers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) allows the detection of low-abundance cellular RNAs while achieving a high level of transcript specificity.\nPerform the first round of PCR.\nAssemble the PCR mixtures.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_10.csv\nUse a thermocycler with a heated lid and programmed as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_11.csv\nRemove the primers for the first round by purifying the PCR reaction products with a Qiagen QiaQuick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=95f10677-aa29-453d-a222-0e19f01ebe17&lang=en] and eluting the DNA from the column with sterile water.\nPerform the second round of PCR.\nAssemble the PCR mixtures.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_12.csv\nUse the same thermal cycling conditions as for the first round PCR, as described in step 13.\nPause point: Samples can be stored indefinitely at −20°C after either of the PCR steps.\nElectrophoresis\nTiming: 5 h\nElectrophoresis on a non-denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel allows the PCR products to be separated even if derived from closely spaced transcription start sites or RNA cleavage sites (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCast a non-denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel.\nNote: We routinely use a V16 vertical gel system with a 19-well comb and a gel thickness of 1.5 mm.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_13.csv\nUse 1× TBE as the gel running buffer and pre-run the polyacrylamide gel for 30 min at 100 V.\nAdd 5 μL of non-denaturing sample buffer containing bromophenol blue to each PCR reaction product.\nLoad 40 μL of each sample onto the gel.

    "Visualize and photograph the PCR products with a UV transilluminator and excise the bands of interest for sequencing.\n5′ end mapping\nTiming: 2 days\nPCR is used to amplify the small amount of DNA extracted from the polyacrylamide gel and to lengthen the segment upstream of the junction between the ligated oligonucleotide and the RNA (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This allows sequencing of the RNA 5′ end that was ligated to the chimeric oligonucleotide, which otherwise would be too close to the end of the PCR product.\nExtract DNA from the excised polyacrylamide gel slice(s).\nPlace the excised gel slice into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube and crush the slice with a 1-mL pipette tip. Rolling the tip around the wall of the microcentrifuge tube breaks the polyacrylamide into small pieces.\nAdd 300 μL or more of 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) to the tube, enough to fully submerge the gel pieces. Vortex and incubate for 16 h at 4°C.\nPellet the gel fragments by centrifugation at 15,000×g at 4°C for 30 min. Use a pipette to carefully transfer the supernatant to another microcentrifuge tube. If the supernatant still contains small gel pieces, repeat the centrifugation and transfer.\nAdd an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (pH 7.6) to the supernatant and mix by shaking.\nCentrifuge at 15,000×g for 5 min at room temperature. Transfer the aqueous layer to another microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1/10th volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 3 volumes of ethanol.

Stain the gel with ethidium bromide, visualize the PCR products with a UV transilluminator, and excise the bands of interest.\nExtract the PCR products from the gel slices by using a Qiagen QiaQuick gel purification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=95f10677-aa29-453d-a222-0e19f01ebe17&lang=en].\nUsing primer D (key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), sequence the PCR products to identify the 5′ end of each of the original RNAs.\nPreparation of an internal standard\nTiming: 2 days\nDetermining the percentage of the 5′ ends of interest that are monophosphorylated requires quantitative comparison to a monophosphorylated internal standard that can be reverse transcribed and amplified with the same set of primers. The RT-PCR product of this cognate internal standard must be well resolved from the other RT-PCR products. Visualization of the products of the preliminary round of PABLO-QA on a polyacrylamide gel makes it possible to identify a clear zone on the gel above the RT-PCR products arising from cellular RNA. An internal standard whose 5′ terminus is located 10–50 nucleotides upstream of the 5′ end of the longest cellular transcript under investigation should generate an RT-PCR product that migrates there.\nUse PCR to generate a DNA template for synthesizing the internal standard by in vitro transcription (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1546-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Synthesis of a cognate internal standard",
    "A DNA template for RNA synthesis is generated by PCR amplification of the gene of interest (parallel black lines) with two transcript-specific primers: primer E (broad red and black arrow), which contains a T7 promoter (red segment) and anneals 10–50 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site (bent black arrow) of the cellular transcript under investigation, and primer X (broad white arrow), which anneals >100 nt downstream. The 10–50 nt extension added by primer E need not match the upstream region of the gene encoding the cellular transcript under investigation as long as the primer can anneal near the initiation site of that gene. In vitro transcription of the PCR product by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of a 30-fold molar excess of GMP over GTP generates a cognate internal standard (gray line) bearing a monophosphate (p) at its 5′ end.\nThe internal standard should be cognate to the cellular transcript under investigation, but with a 5′ extension.\nThe template for PCR can be a cell suspension or a cloned DNA fragment encoding the RNA of interest.\nThe forward PCR primer (primer E) should incorporate a T7 promoter (TAATACGACTCACTATAG, underlined) upstream of the intended transcription start site (boldface G). This promoter should be preceded by 5 nucleotides and followed by about 20 transcribed nucleotides complementary to the PCR template.\nUse primer X as the reverse PCR primer.\nAssemble the PCR mixture.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_15.csv\nUse a thermocycler with a heated lid and programmed as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_16.csv",
    "Resolve the PCR products by electrophoresis on a 1.2%–1.8% agarose gel in 1× TBE alongside an appropriate DNA size ladder. Stain the gel with ethidium bromide, visualize the PCR products with a UV transilluminator, and excise the band of interest. Extract the PCR product from the gel slice by using a Qiagen QiaQuick gel purification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=95f10677-aa29-453d-a222-0e19f01ebe17&lang=en].\nFor use as a template for in vitro transcription, the concentration of the purified PCR product should be >20 ng/μL. If necessary, its concentration can be increased by evaporation (e.g., on a SpeedVac concentrator).\nSynthesize the monophosphorylated internal standard by in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase in the presence of a 30-fold molar excess of GMP over GTP (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAssemble the reaction mixture.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_17.csv\nIncubate the reaction mixture at 37°C for 4–12 h.\nDegrade the DNA template by adding 11 μL of 10× Turbo DNase buffer and 4 μL (8 U) of Turbo DNase to the RNA synthesis reaction. Mix well and incubate at 37°C for 1–2 h.\nPurify the in vitro transcript on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.\nCast a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel.\nNote: We routinely use a V16 vertical gel system with a 19-well comb and a gel thickness of 1.5 mm.\nNote: This method of purification involves loading the products of in vitro transcription in two wells of unequal width. If a comb that creates a broad well for preparative electrophoresis is not available, then two or three narrower teeth of a regular comb can be taped together for that purpose.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_18.csv\nUse 1× TBE as the running buffer for electrophoresis and pre-run the polyacrylamide gel for 30 min at 100 V.",
    "Add 220 μL of formamide sample buffer to the in vitro transcription reaction, heat at 95°C for 5 min, and transfer to ice.\nWash the unpolymerized acrylamide and urea out of the wells of the gel and load the denatured RNA sample into two wells: 20 μL in a narrow well (the marker lane) and the remainder (∼315 μL) in a broad neighboring well (the preparative lane).\nRun the gel at 100 V for 15 min or until the dye has entered the gel, and then increase the voltage to 180 V. Stop electrophoresis when the bromophenol blue has reached the bottom of the gel.\nCut the gel vertically between the two lanes and stain the marker lane with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide in 1× TBE for 30 min with gentle agitation. Cover the remainder of the gel with plastic wrap or a plastic sheet protector to prevent it from drying out.\nPlace the stained part of the gel on a sheet of clear plastic such as a sheet protector. Visualize the RNA band with a UV transilluminator and use a pen to mark the upper and lower boundaries of the band on the sheet protector.\nPlace the unstained portion of the gel on the marked sheet protector so as to align it with the marker lane. Use the outline of the marker band as a guide for excising the RNA band from the unstained part of the gel. This method allows the RNA product to be gel purified without exposing it to ethidium bromide or UV light.\nExtract the RNA from the polyacrylamide gel slice by the method described in step 23, substituting phenol/chloroform (pH 4.3) for phenol/chloroform (pH 7.6).",
    "After ethanol precipitating and drying the RNA, dissolve it in 40 μL of sterile water and determine its concentration by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.\nFinal analysis\nTiming: 21 h\nUsing RT-PCR to measure the percentage of a cellular transcript that is monophosphorylated requires comparison to a cognate internal standard that itself is monophosphorylated and can be reverse transcribed and replicated with the same set of primers. To be informative, the internal standard must be added at a concentration that is comparable to that of the transcript(s) under investigation. This concentration is determined empirically by serially diluting the internal standard and spiking equal amounts (0.001–10 ng) into samples of cellular RNA (7.5 μg) that have or have not been treated with RppH. The resulting pairs of mixtures are then ligated to the chimeric oligonucleotide, reverse transcribed, PCR amplified, and examined by electrophoresis as described for the preliminary analysis.\nRppH treatment\nPerform as described for the preliminary analysis.\nLigation of a chimeric oligonucleotide\nPerform as described for the preliminary analysis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), but include the monophosphorylated internal standard.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_19.csv\nNote: An additional nucleic acid mixture should contain only the monophosphorylated internal standard and the chimeric oligonucleotide, with 7.5 μg of tRNA, poly(A), or total RNA from another species substituted for the cellular RNA listed above. Parallel analysis of this additional mixture enables the bands on the final polyacrylamide gel to be identified correctly.\nIncubate the nucleic acid mixture at 65°C for 5 min and then transfer it to ice for 1 min.\nAdd 9 μL of ligase master mix to each tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_20.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1546_21.csv\nMix thoroughly and incubate at 37°C for 2 h.",
    "Add 125 μL of 3 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), extract with phenol/chloroform (pH 4.3), and ethanol precipitate as described in step 3. Dissolve the RNA pellets in 11.5 μL of sterile water.\nReverse transcription, amplification, and electrophoresis\nPerform as described for the preliminary analysis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Quantify as described below.\nQuantitative analysis of PABLO-QA data\nThe final stage of PABLO-QA concludes with quantifying band intensities and calculating the percentage of 5′ ends that are monophosphorylated. The two gel lanes (±RppH, spiked with identical amounts of the internal standard) in which the intensity of the DNA band representing the monophosphorylated internal standard is most similar to that for the transcript(s) of interest are scanned and quantified with ImageJ or commercial software to determine the relative intensities of those bands. Because ethidium bromide staining can result in substantial fluorescence between DNA bands, background correction is essential. Finally, the percentage of each cellular transcript that is monophosphorylated is calculated by comparing the relative band intensities with or without prior treatment of the cellular RNA with excess RppH, as follows:\n  % monophosphorylated  =   100  ×     ( Transcript / Standard )   − RppH     ( Transcript / Standard )   + RppH     \nThe experiments (±RppH) with the optimal concentration of the internal standard should be performed in triplicate to allow mean values and standard deviations to be calculated."
