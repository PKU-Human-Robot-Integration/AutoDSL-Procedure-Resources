    "All animal procedures were performed under the guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cornell University (#2002-0095). 8-10 weeks old AcroSensE mice2 were used for the present study. Requests for information on the availability of the AcroSensE mice can be submitted to the corresponding author.\n1. Sperm collection and washing\nCollect cauda epididymal sperm (more details on this procedure are provided in11) from AcroSensE mice. Allow 15 min swim-out procedure in a 3.5 cm tissue-culture dish containing 0.5 mL of Modified Whitten's medium (MW) at 37 °C. Dish should be covered to reduce evaporation of the MW, and should be tilted so that the medium has enough depth to cover the cauda epididymides.\n\tNOTE: Modified Whitten's medium (MW) includes 22 mM HEPES, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1 mM pyruvic acid, 4.8 mM lactic acid hemi-Ca2+ salt, pH 7.35. Glucose (5.5 mM), NaHCO3 (10 mM), and 2-hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin (CD; 3 mM) are supplemented (see Table of Materials) as needed for induction of capacitation, and concentrations can be modified for specific experiments. In addition, alternative sterol acceptors could be used instead of CD (e.g., bovine serum albumin or high density lipoproteins).\nUsing fine forceps, remove any epididymal tissue from the swim-out collection dish. Transfer the medium containing the sperm into a 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge the suspension at 100 x g for 1 min in a swinging bucket rotor at room temperature. Using a plastic pipette, remove the MW supernatant containing the sperm from any gross tissue debris that will have pelleted at this step.",
    "Bring the MW supernatant containing the sperm to a total volume of 3 mL by adding MW at 37 °C. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 8 min (at room temperature) in a round-bottomed tube. Slowly remove the supernatant of MW from the loosely-pelleted sperm.\nIf viable, the sperm should appear as a \"fluffy\"-looking pellet. Gently resuspend the sperm via trituration with a large-bore transfer pipette or via gentle manual taps on the tube (\"finger flicking\"). Once resuspended evenly, transfer them into a new round-bottom tube. Use 10-20 µL of the sperm suspension to count and assess motility. Dilute sperm in MW for use.\n\tNOTE: For most experiments involving mouse sperm capacitation, a final concentration of 5-10 million sperm/mL MW is utilized. The imaging protocol described here does not require the capacitation of sperm, although it is necessary for sperm to acquire the ability to undergo physiologically-relevant acrosome exocytosis. One could study pathological exocytosis or exocytosis induced through reagents such as a calcium ionophore without capacitating the sperm. Additionally, one could explore potential changes in acrosomal calcium in non-capacitated cells in response to various stimuli.\nUse the sperm within 3-5 h from collection, keeping the time as short as possible and consistent among experimental trials.\nPerform all steps of collection and washing at 37 °C using MW medium, employing methods to minimize membrane damage. This includes the use of large-bore plastic transfer pipettes or large-orifice pipette tips, which are recommended for use during all stages of the procedure.\n2. Poly-D-lysine-coating of coverslip dishes for imaging\nNOTE: Poly-D-lysine (PDL) dishes should be prepared fresh before each experiment.\nDispense a 0.5 μL droplet of PDL (0.5 mg/mL, see Table of Materials) at the center of a coverslip dish.",
    "Using a 10 μL graduated tip, smear the PDL droplet across the coverslip (crisscross pattern as shown in Figure 1B).\nAllow to dry at 37 ˚C for 10 min. Keep PDL-coated dishes covered and at 37 ˚C until use.\n3. Capillary pulling, loading for puffing\nPull borosilicate glass capillaries (O.D, 2 mm, I.D, 1.56 mm, see Table of Materials) using settings as follows- Heat: 330, Pull: 250, Velocity: 250, and Time: 70. This step should be optimized for the specific puller in use.\nBefore each experiment, load a single capillary with the stimulating solution containing 3-5x the concentration of the stimulant (to account for the rapid diffusion of the solution upon puffing). Before filling, use fine tweezers to break open the capillary tip at approximately 1-2 mm from the end. This should produce a ∼5 µm opening diameter. Heat polishing is not required.\nUsing a thin plastic transfer pipette, slowly inject the stimulating solution into the capillary until three-fourths of its length is full.\nRemove any air bubbles formed during filling by gentle flicking of the capillary.\nMount filled capillary on the micromanipulator (see Table of Materials).\n4. Preparation of the delivery of stimulation for puffing\nNOTE: To minimize the risk of user injury, safety goggles should be worn during the operation of the puffing procedure.\nSet up the single-cell delivery system settings to provide a 10 s pulse at 5 psi.\nConnect the borosilicate capillary to the single-cell delivery system pipette holder. Ensure seals are tight.\nWhile observing the capillary tip, apply a short puff of 2 s at 20 psi to ensure that the solution is indeed dispensed through the tip's end (a small drop should be obvious at the end of the tip).\n5. Microscopy and image acquisition",
    "NOTE: Multiple brands of microscopes are available and can be used; however, a minimum frame rate of 3 frames/s is desirable. Regarding temperature and environmental control, please note that the actual temperature of the medium in the dish should be confirmed, for example, using a non-contact infrared thermometer.\nAdd 80 μL of diluted sperm to the center of a poly-D-lysine-coated 35 mm coverslip dish. For most experiments involving mouse sperm capacitation, a final concentration of 5-10 million sperm/mL is utilized.\nSlowly add to the sperm 3 mL of warm (37 ˚C) MW base media supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2.\n\tNOTE: One could perform experiments at room temperature to slow cellular processes, but it's important to note that because capacitation is mediated by lipid exchanges and the fluidity of micro- and macro-domains, one must keep in mind that physiologically-relevant capacitation and acrosome exocytosis are temperature-dependent processes.\nMount the dish with the sperm on the microscope (pre-heated to 37 ˚C).\nExcite the GCaMP3 using a 488 nm laser line and view with a 505-550 nm bandpass (BP) filter. Excite the mCherry using a 555 nm laser line and view with a 575-615 nm BP filter.\nUsing a micromanipulator (it is recommended to attach the manipulator to the air-table on which the microscope was set up.), position the tip of the capillary approximately 100 μm to the side and 5-10 μm above the plane of the cell of interest.\n\tNOTE: The stimulating solutions are made at 3-5x the normal concentration to compensate for the rapid diffusion occurring in the volume between the capillary and the cell.\nStart the imaging sequence on the microscope.\nImage sperm cells at a high frame rate, preferably >10 frames/s. Here, a resonant scanner was used that enables imaging at 33 ms/frame.",
    "Ten seconds after starting the image acquisition on the microscope, activate the single-cell delivery system to initiate the 10 s puff of stimulant.\nImage cells for a duration of 10-15 min.\nUsing the single-cell delivery system, image multiple cells from a single dish according to the locations provided in Figure 1B.\n\t​NOTE: Untreated/non-stimulated sperm under the microscope should appear mostly red, with a low intensity of the green signal. Sperm heads should be attached to the coverslip, and live sperm can be identified by their moving tails. In sperm that undergo AE, the GCaMP3 green signal will initially increase, and both the mCherry red signal and GCaMP3 green signal will disappear if AE is complete, as illustrated in Figure 2. The reduction of mCherry fluorescence provides a more specific indicator of the time when AE begins because changes in Ca2+ concentrations will continually cause changes in the GCaMP3 fluorescence intensity.\n6. Image and data analysis\nNOTE: Offline image analysis is conducted using ImageJ (see Table of Materials). Previously, several intermediate steps were reported in the process leading to AE, including acrosomal calcium rise (ACR), and full membrane fusion. The latter leads to the loss of mCherry fluorescence and therefore represents full AE. In some cells, signals akin to pre-spike foot events (PSF) are observed when using amperometric approaches in studies of exocytosis (for more details, please see2). Several optional methods are available for analyzing the AcroSensE raw data to quantify ACR, AE, and its intermediate steps. The following describes some of the basic analytical methods.\nDepending on the specific microscope system file extension, use the split channel tool (Image > Colors > Split Channels) to generate individual windows for the GCaMP3 and mCherry channels.\nSynchronize the individual windows using the \"Synchronize Window\" tool (Analyze > Tools > Synchronize Windows).",
    "Select a region of interest (ROI) around the sperm head in the red channel to include the acrosome region (Figure 3A,B). The synchronize tool allows the same area selection to be applied automatically on the green channel, in which the sperm are still too dim to be visible.\nChoose \"Z Profiler\" plugin (Plugins > Stacks > Z Profiler) or \"Time Series Analyzer\" (Plugins > Stacks > Time Series Analyzer) to plot the change in fluorescence intensity as a function of frames/time for each of the two channels.\nCopy data to a spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel) for plotting and further analysis.\n\tNOTE: Once the data are copied to a spreadsheet, multiple parameters can be extracted for analysis, including the following, as illustrated in Figure 4.\n\t\nFusion Pore (FP) start time: measure the time from timepoint 0 to the timepoint where the GCaMP3 signal starts to rise. This parameter indicates the delay between the stimulation and the sperm ACR response.\nAE start time: measure the time from timepoint 0 to the timepoint where the mCherry signal starts to decay. This parameter indicates the delay between the stimulation and the sperm AE response. This parameter could also be used to calculate the delay between FP formation and AE response.\nPeak FP amplitude: measure the fluorescence signal from the base to the peak of the GCaMP3 signal rise. This parameter indicates the total increase in ACR response.\nRate of loss of mCherry: determine this parameter by a linear or an exponential fit on the section of the mCherry signal loss (as indicated by \"slope\" in Figure 4B).",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, determine the decay rate by the residual (R) signal method at various time points (e.g., R60: duration time in seconds to a residual signal of 60% from the baseline of the mCherry signal). This parameter can be used to quantify the rate at which the acrosomal content is dispersed upon AE.\nSignal decrease for mCherry loss: determine the difference in amplitude between the baseline mCherry fluorescence intensity and the signal following AE. This parameter indicates the total amount of acrosomal content dispersed upon AE.\nPlot the changes in fluorescence (F) for both the red and green channels as raw data, or normalize them by the initial fluorescence (F0) and express them as ΔF/F0. The latter provides better visualization of the changes in both red and green on a single plot (e.g., see Figure 3D and Figure 3H).\n\t\tNOTE: Finally, the different measured parameters can be compared between different conditions to determine the relationship between changes in acrosomal calcium concentration and AE. For examples of various experimental condition comparisons, see reference2.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
