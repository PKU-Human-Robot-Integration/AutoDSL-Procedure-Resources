    "HepG2 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 2 x 105 cells per well and allowed to attach overnight. The volume of medium was 1.0 ml in each well.   After the overnight incubation, the media in each well was replaced with 1.0 ml of fresh media containing tested compounds and controls, and incubated for 10 more days. The media was replaced with fresh media and compounds every 3 to 4 days. The DMSO concentration was kept at 1.0% for all treatments including control samples (no drug, DMSO only).   Following the incubation, the cells were washed once with PBS and the total DNA was extracted from the cells using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.    Real-time PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan universal mastermix in an ABI Prism 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System.    Quantification of mtDNA was achieved by amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial specific cytochrome b gene using the primers and probe described in Table 1. Chromosomal DNA was quantified by the amplification of a fragment of the β-actin gene using a β-actin Assay-on-Demand kit.    Amplification reactions for the quantification of mitochondrial and chromosomal DNA were performed independently using approximately 25 ng of total DNA in a volume of 20 μl.   Table 1.

    "Data analysis   The relative amount of mtDNA in treated samples was determined using a relative quantification method based upon the 2-ΔΔCT formula (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).    The amount of mtDNA (% mtDNA) in compound treated samples relative to the DMSO treated controls was calculated based upon the following formula: % mtDNA = 100 x 2-ΔΔCT ΔΔCT = ΔCT, treated – ΔCT, control ΔCT, treated = (CT, cyt b – CT, β-actin) treated ΔCT, control = (CT, cyt b – CT, β-actin) control CT, cyt b and CT, β-actin represent the cycle threshold values for the amplification of cytochrome b and β-actin, respectively, as determined by the computational analysis of amplification curves using the ABI Prism software. The final results are presented as the mean % mtDNA ± SD from 3 independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.   The 2-ΔΔCT method was validated for cytochrome b and β-actin genes by determining the ΔCT values for amplification reactions containing various amounts of total cellular DNA. Minimal differences were observed in the ΔCT values in samples containing 5 to 40 ng of total cellular DNA; indicating that neither the amplification nor detection efficiencies of cytochrome b and β-actin were affected by the amount of DNA template within the dilution range relevant for the quantitative analysis performed in this study Table 2.   The effect of a positive control compound ddC (dideoxy cytidine) is shown in Table 3.   Table 2.
