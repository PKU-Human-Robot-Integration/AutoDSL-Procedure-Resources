    "1. Cell culture\nSupplement high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Minimum Essential Medium (H-DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% nonessential amino acid solution (NEAA), 1% penicillin G and streptomycin, and 1% Glutamine supplement as culture media for A549 cells.\nCulture A549 cells in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and with 5% CO2\nDissociate cells for subculture using trypsin at approximately 80% confluence.\n\t\nUse 3 mL of trypsin to treat the cells in the T75 culture flask at 37 °C for 3 min, and then add 6 mL of culture medium to stop the trypsinization.\nPipette the culture medium to harvest loosely adhered cells.\nCentrifuge at 72.5 x g for 3 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend with 3 mL of fresh medium.\nTransfer 1 mL of cell suspension to a new T75 culture flask containing 10 mL of fresh medium. Change the culture medium every 2 days.\n2. Preparation of nozzles\nLoad glass micropipettes onto the puller following the manufacturer's instructions. The outer diameter, inner diameter, and length of the micro-jet pipe are 1.5 mm, 1.1 mm, and 100 mm, respectively.\nSet the pulling parameters for the puller. Specifically, the values of HEAT, PULL, VELOCITY, TIME, and PRESSURE are set to 560, 255, 255, 150, and 500 by default, respectively. Pull off the nozzle under these parameters.\n\tCAUTION: The nozzle obtained after pulling off is very sharp, and careless operation may cause injuries.\nCut off the resulting nozzle (step 2.2) at the designated diameter by a micro-forge device following the manufacturer's instructions to obtain a specific tip diameter. Specifically, locate the specified diameter of the nozzle onto the heated platinum wire. Heat the wire up to 60 °C for about 5 s and pull the nozzle apart.",
    "Immerse the printhead of the nozzle in a hydrophobic agent for 30 min, followed by three cycles of rinsing with sterilized water.\nBefore printing, sterilize the nozzle in alcohol for 5 min and rinse it with sterilized water three times to remove the residual alcohol.\n3. Preparation of hydrogel bioink\nDissolve NaCl (0.45 g) into 50 mL of sterile water to obtain a 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution. Vibrate the solution to promote dissolution. After being completely dissolved, filter the solution through a 0.45 µm polyethylene terephthalate filter membrane.\nWeigh low-viscosity sodium alginate powder (1 g) and dissolve it in 25 mL of NaCl solution (step 3.1) at a high temperature of 60-80 °C overnight to obtain a 4% (w/v) sodium alginate stock solution. The stock solution can be stored at 4 °C for 1 month.\nSterilize the sodium alginate stock solution (step 3.2) by heating it three times in an oven (70 °C) for 30 min.\nDilute proper volume of sodium alginate stock solution (step 3.3) in 0.9% NaCl solution (step 3.1) at concentrations of 2%, 1.5%, and 0.5% (w/v).\n\tNOTE: In addition to heating in the oven, other preparation processes of sodium alginate solution should be carried out in the hood.\nDissolve 1 g of gelatin powder in 25 mL of NaCl solution (step 3.1) at a high temperature of 60-80 °C overnight to obtain a 4% (w/v) gelatin stock solution. The stock solution can be stored at 4 °C for 1 month.\nSterilize the gelatin stock solution (step 3.5) by heating it three times in an oven (70 °C) for 30 min.\nDilute the proper volume of gelatin stock solution (step 3.6) in 0.9% NaCl solution (step 3.1) at a concentration of 1.5% (w/v).",
    "NOTE: In addition to heating in the oven, other preparation processes of gelatin solution should be carried out in the hood.\nTo promote cell binding on the microcarriers, prepare the alginate-collagen solution by mixing the 2% (w/v) sodium alginate solution and the Type I collagen solution from rat tail (4 mg/mL) at a ratio of 3:1. Adjust the solution to pH 7.2 with 0.1 M NaOH solution and use immediately after preparation.\nDissolve the tyrosine-modified HA flocculent solid in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution at 60-80 °C overnight to obtain a 0.8% w/w tyrosine-modified hyaluronic acid PBS solution. The stock solution can be stored at 4 °C for 1 month.\nSterilize the tyrosine-modified HA PBS solution by heating it three times in an oven (70 °C) for 30 min.\nDissolve horseradish peroxidase powder (500 enzyme activity unit/mg) in PBS solution to obtain 8 enzyme activity unit/mg horseradish peroxidase PBS solution.\nDilute hydrogen peroxide solution (30%, w/w) by DI water to 4 mM.\nPrepare the modified HA-horseradish peroxidase solution by mixing tyrosine-modified hyaluronic acid PBS solution and horseradish peroxidase PBS solution at a ratio of 1:1.\n\t​NOTE: In addition to heating in the oven, other preparation processes of HA-horseradish peroxidase solution should be carried out in the hood.\n4. Microdroplets formation based on AVIFJ\nUse a home-established cell printing system as previously reported (Figure 1A)26. The electrical signal output by the waveform generator is first amplified and then drives piezoelectric ceramics to generate controllable deformation. The nozzle fixed on the piezoelectric ceramic thus produces controllable vibrations.\nSterilize the printing system by wiping with 75% (v/v) alcohol and ultraviolet (UV) exposure overnight.\nLoad 5 mL of bioink (step 3.1) into a disposable sterile syringe. Install the syringe on the syringe pump.",
    "Connect the syringe (step 4.3) and nozzle (step 2.5) with a silicone hose of 1 mm inner diameter.\nFix the nozzle (step 4.4) to be used for printing by adjusting the tightness of the clamping screw. Keep the tip of the nozzle away from the substrate during installation to avoid damage and contamination.\n\t​CAUTION: If the nozzle is broken during installation, please wear thicker gloves and carefully clean up glass fragments and residues.\nRapidly push the syringe pump and load the bioink (step 4.3) to the nozzle (step 4.5). Set the flow rate at 30 µL/min. Wipe off the excess material at the tip.\nSet signal generator parameters. Import self-designed waveform containing 500,000 sampling points. Set the sampling rate and peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) as 5 million samples/s and 10 V, respectively.\nClean slides or Petri dishes with deionized water. Place them under the nozzle as the printing substrate.\nPreset the motion path and trigger mode of vibration as drop-on-demand.\nPrint the droplets following the pre-designed patterns.\n5. Microcarriers formation based on AVIFJ\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.4, except change the bioink to 2% (w/v) alginate solution (step 3.4), alginate-collagen solution (step 3.8), or modified HA-horseradish peroxidase solution (step 3.13).\nDissolve 3 g of calcium chloride into 100 mL of sterile water to obtain 3% (w/v) calcium chloride solution. After being completely dissolved, filter the solution through a 0.45 µm polyethylene terephthalate filter membrane.\nAdd 5 mL of cross-linking solution (calcium chloride solution or hydrogen peroxide solution) into a Petri dish. Place the Petri dish under the nozzle to work as a substrate.\nAfter printing, cross-link the microcarriers for 3 min.\nCollect microcarrier suspension in a centrifuge tube, and enrich microcarriers by centrifugation at 29 x g for 3 min. Resuspend the microcarriers in culture media at approximately 600 microcarriers/mL.",
    "6. Inoculating cells on the surface of microcarriers\nStain A549 cells with Cell Tracker Green CMFDA to facilitate the observation of cells. Specifically, remove culture media, add 5 mL of serum-free medium containing 10 µM Cell Tracker dye, and incubate cells for 30 min in an incubator. Then, replace the dye solution with fresh medium.\nResuspend the A549 cell suspension at the density of 1.6 x 106 cells/mL.\nAdd 1 mL of alginate-collagen microcarrier suspension (step 5.3) and 1 mL of A549 cell suspension (step 6.1) into a low-adherent 6-well culture plate.\nPlace the plate onto a shaker at 30 rpm in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nTake the plate off the shaker and wait for 30 min to let the microcarriers settle down. Half change the culture medium every 2 days.\n7. Analysis of microdroplets/microcarriers formation\nObserve and measure the nozzle (step 2.2), the Petri dishes (step 4.10 and step 5.4), and cells with microcarriers (step 6.5) under a bright field microscope or confocal microscope. Specifically, the objective magnification is 4x, 10x, or 20x and the eyepiece magnification is 10x.\nMeasure the diameter of the microcarriers by ImageJ software. According to the scale bar that comes with the microscope when shooting in the picture, set the actual size of the scale in ImageJ, and draw 10 lines of the radius or semi-major axis of the microcarriers. ImageJ can get the average size and standard deviation of these line segments.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
