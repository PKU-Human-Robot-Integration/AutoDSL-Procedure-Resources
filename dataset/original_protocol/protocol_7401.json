    "The protocol described below is for sorting out fully senescent NHDFs from among NHDFs at the replicative senescence plateau. These cells are sorted as C12FDGhigh/FSChigh/SSChigh. We also used the same protocol to sort NHDFs induced into senescence by X-ray irradiation (Goy et al., 2022).Cell culture To be able to objectively delineate the sorting gates corresponding to senescent cells, it is mandatory to use a negative control and advisable to have a positive one. The best negative control is to use cells from the same cell culture at the earliest possible passage. There is no obvious positive control for replicative senescence. However, cells at replicative senescence can be used as a positive control for SIPS, OIS, or TIS. Of course, classical cytometry controls must also be included (i.e., unstained cells in our protocol) to take into consideration the level of autofluorescence. Note that this autofluorescence level can be higher in senescent cells than in proliferating ones because of autofluorescent oxidized component aggregates, like lipofuscin, that accumulate in senescent cells (Evangelou et al., 2017).NHDFs are primary cells. Cultivate them at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and at atmospheric O2 pressure, in fibroblast growth medium-2 (160 µL/cm2). Always proceed to subculturing before the cells reach 70% confluency. For this, rinse them with TE preheated at 37 °C, add fresh TE (40 µL/cm2), and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min in case of exponentially growing cells or 10 min for cells having reached the senescence plateau. Then, add the same volume of TN preheated at 37 °C. Collect the cells and pellet them by centrifugation at 90 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Replate at 3,500 cells/cm2 in case of exponentially growing cells, and at 2,000 cells/cm2 for cells at replicative senescence.",
    "Under these conditions, exponentially growing NHDFs will reach the replicative senescence growth plateau after 50–70 population doublings, i.e., in approximately five months (Figure 1A). At this plateau, senescent cells can be easily recognized by their increased sizes observable under a phase contrast microscope.Freeze early passage cells and put them again in culture a few days before the sorting to use them as a negative control.C12FDG staining The incubation time and concentration of C12FDG should be adapted to the cell type. For NHDFs, we incubate the cells with 33 µM C12FDG at 37 °C for 2 h. For NHEKs, we use a 16 µM C12FDG concentration and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 16 h. Mind that high concentrations of C12FDG or long incubation times may be toxic, depending on the cell type. The efficacy and non-toxicity of the C12FDG staining protocol can be checked under an inverted epifluorescence microscope.Dilute C12FDG from the stock solution in the culture medium preheated at 37 °C to obtain a 33 µM concentration. For unstained controls, dilute the same volume of DMSO (the C12FDG vehicle) in the culture medium preheated at 37 °C and put it on the cells at 100 µL/cm2.Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.Cell harvesting All the steps must be performed in the dark to avoid photobleaching of C12FDG.Remove the C12FDG- or DMSO-containing culture medium. Rinse the cells twice with 30 µL/cm2 of sterile DPBS at room temperature.Remove the DPBS and harvest the cells by incubating them at 37 °C with TE preheated at 37 °C (40 µL/cm2) until the cells are detached and separated from each other (check under an inverted phase contrast microscope). Note that the incubation time may be increased by approximately 50% for senescent cells compared with that for proliferating cells.",
    "Neutralize TE by adding TN preheated at 37 °C (a volume of TN for a volume of TE).Count the cells (to be able to resuspend them at the desired concentration afterwards).Centrifuge the cells at 90 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.Rinse the pellets with 500 µL of cold pre-sort buffer.Centrifuge the cells at 90 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the cells in cold pre-sort buffer to the concentration of 4 × 106 cells/mL.Keep the tubes on ice until sorting to protect the fluorescent SA-β-Gal product from degradation.Cell sorting We propose to sort senescent cells using the following three parameters: size, granularity, and SA-β-Gal activity. Four gates will have to be designed (Figure 2). The first one is used, as usually in flow cytometry sorting, to separate live cells from the debris (Figure 2A), the second to exclude doublets (Figure 2B), and the third to define the C12FDGhigh cells. This gate is delineated by comparing the dot-plot of C12FDG-stained senescent cells to those of both unstained senescent cells and C12FDG-stained non-senescent cells (Figure 2C). The fourth gate serves to delineate the largest and most granular cells within the C12FDGhigh population, using their FSC and SSC values (Figure 2D). The stringency of the two last gates can be adapted, depending on your objectives. Moreover, these two last gates can be subdivided to sort different senescent subpopulations featuring the three senescence markers to different extents. In that case, we recommend delineating the gates such that they are not strictly adjacent, in order to obtain sufficiently different subpopulations.Proceed to cell sorting as soon as possible after cell harvesting. Use a BD INFLUX V7 or an equivalent cell sorter, equipped with a 200 µm nozzle.",
    "Sorting parameters must be tuned adequately to the nozzle size, according to the cytometer’s manufacturer recommendations. Pre-sorting tubes and post-sorting collecting tubes must be in polypropylene and coated with heat-inactivated FBS to avoid cell adhesion to the tube walls. Moreover, we recommend regularly shaking the pre-sorting tubes gently during the sorting process to resuspend the cells that could have sedimented.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4612/bioprotoc-13-04-4612-g002.jpgFigure 2. Gating strategy for the sorting of senescent normal human dermal fibroblasts at the replicative senescence plateau. A. The first gate is set to eliminate debris using the forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) values. Note that large and granular cells are much more numerous in the population at the replicative senescence plateau than in the population of exponentially growing cells. B. The second gate serves to exclude doublets using the forward scatter–width (FSC-W) and forward scatter–area (FSC-A) values. C. The third gate is set to define the C12FDGhigh population. It is delineated by considering the autofluorescence level of unstained cells and the fluorescence level of C12FDG-stained exponentially growing cells. D. The fourth gate is used to delineate the FSChigh/SSChigh cells within the C12FDGhigh population that will be sorted.Prepare the pre-sorting polypropylene tubes and post-sorting polypropylene collecting tubes: fill the tubes with FBS previously inactivated by a 30 min incubation at 56 °C. Let the tubes be coated during 30 min at 37 °C.Prepare the cell sorter for acquisition of FSC, SSC, and C12FDG fluorescence [the 530/40 filter–5/6-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) equivalent, 488 nm laser], according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Cool the pre- and post-sorting tubes to 4 °C using the circulating water–cooling device.Analyze the FSC vs. SSC parameters of the unstained batches of NHDFs at early passages and those at the senescence plateau. Optimize the amplification parameters and scales to visualize the cells of all FSC and SSC values.",
    "Given very large sizes of senescent cells, instrument signal processing is particularly challenged and the linearity of the scale for FSC may be questionable. However, in contrast to the classical digital display on most cell sorters, the INFLUX V7 cell sorter displays analogic signals, theoretically ensuring that the linearity of the scales is preserved despite extreme parameters adjustments. Delineate the first gate to exclude debris (Figure 2A).Analyze the FSC-W vs. FSC-A parameters to delineate a singlet cell gate. The heterogeneity of cell sizes requires particular attention to delineate doublets’ exclusion on FSC-W/FSC-A parameters, with an unusual necessity to draw a large gate not to exclude the cells with high FSC-W values (Figure 2B). Indeed, these cells may be doublets, but also singlet large cells, i.e., senescent cells. In order to determine whether the cells with the highest FSC-W values were doublets or singlet large cells, we analyzed their C12FDG, FSC, and SSC values in comparison with those of cells with the lowest FSC-W values. Regarding exponentially growing cells, we found that those with the highest FSC-W values had a higher C12FDG signal than the cells with the lowest FSC-W values. A majority of these cells had low FSC and SSC values, indicating that these were indeed mainly doublets (Figure 3). Regarding cells at the senescence and deep senescence plateau, the cells with the highest FSC-W values had the same C12FDG signal than those with lower FSC-W values. Compared with exponentially growing cells, a higher proportion of them had high FSC and SSC values, suggesting that a portion of them were doublets of still small cells and the others were large singlet cells, i.e., senescent cells (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4612/bioprotoc-13-04-4612-g003.jpgFigure 3. Checking the accuracy of the doublet exclusion strategy. Cells were analyzed by their forward scatter–width (FSC-W) and forward scatter–area (FSC-A) values.",
    "Gates of assumed singlets (blue) and doublets (red) were delineated. Cells in these gates were further analyzed for their C12FDG, forward scatter (FSC), and side scatter (SSC) values.Analyze the green fluorescence of all stained and unstained batches in a Log scale histogram. Delineate the third gate of C12FDGhigh cells by comparing the fluorescence intensity of C12FDG-stained senescent cells to that of (i) unstained senescent cells (to evaluate autofluorescence) and (ii) C12FDG-stained early passage cells (Figure 2C).Then, analyze the FSC vs. SSC parameters of the C12FDGhigh cells only. Delineate the gate of FSChigh/SSChigh cells (Figure 2D).Sort the C12FDGhigh/FSChigh/SSChigh cells using the parameters indicated in Table 1, at 500–1,000 events/s (it is possible to go up to 2,000 events/s, but a lower sorting speed is better to avoid the deflection stream spreading). Begin by checking (using the unstained cells at the senescence plateau) that the deflection stream is stable and that cells are properly deflected to the collecting tube. To do that, cover the collecting tube with a cover slide and check that the drop falls at its center.Table 1. Sorting parameters table:",
