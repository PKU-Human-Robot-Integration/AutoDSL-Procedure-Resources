    "Procedures involving human subjects have been performed according to the National Guidelines of the Italian Radiological Society\n1. Patient preparation\nHelp patients to fill in a form which provides information on their history, current symptoms, treatments (either medical or surgical), and prior medical records, if any.\nObtain each patient's written consent before beginning the examination.\nClearly explain in advance the characteristics and purpose of the procedure, including the performance of various maneuvers such as squeezing, straining, and rectal emptying.\nGive information on the duration (average time: 25 min) of the procedure and the need for the insertion of a small catheter into the anal canal for contrast administration (acoustic gel).\nAsk the patients to empty their bladder in the toilet just before starting the examination.\n\tNOTE: On the basis of the patients' histories and presenting symptoms, tailor the procedure to each single case with regard to the amount of contrast administered and the number of scan planes and pulse sequences used.\n2. Diagnostic room and facilities\nKeep a trolley inside the area of the diagnostic room, equipped with all necessary instruments and supplies, including gloves, syringes, a catheter, lubricant jelly, acoustic gel, etc. (see Table of Materials).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58534/58534fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Supplies. This picture shows (A) a trolley with supplies for the MR examination and (B) the dilution of acoustic gel with water (50/30 mL per syringe) in the area adjacent to the diagnostic room before the administration.

    "Ask the patient to lay on the diagnostic table of the MR scanner in the left lateral position (Sims' position). Gently insert the catheter into the rectum and administer the contrast administration (acoustic coupling gel) until the patient experiences a characteristic desire to evacuate (the average amount is 250 mL). Turn the patient in the supine position afterward.\nAdjust the absorbent pad beneath the buttocks, and wrap around the patient's pelvis a surface phased-array coil for the image acquisition.\n\tNOTE: In case of anticipated sensation, urgency, discomfort, or involuntary leakage, interrupt the injection and register the total volume injected before the leakage, as well as the volume leaked.\n3. Technique and image acquisition\nAcquire a localizer scout scan in the coronal, axial, and sagittal planes (TFE T1 pulse sequence, TR of 8 ms, TE of 5 ms, flip angle (FA) of 25°, thickness of 15 mm, and the number of images: 5-11) to mark the boundaries of the region of interest (ROI).\nThen, obtain three subsequent dynamic series in the midsagittal plane (see Table 1, series 1: TR/TE of 2.7/1.3 ms; FA of 45°) centered over the anorectal junction, with the patient at rest, squeezing his/her anal sphincter, and straining (10 s each).\nThereafter, instruct the patient to start - at will - the movement of rectal emptying, and notice when it starts (by acoustic device) to allow the simulatenous acquisition of images over an entire time cycle of 58 s (see Table 1, series 1: TR/TE of 2.7/1.3 ms; FA of 45°; thickness of 35 mm; acquisition time of 58 s).\n\tNOTE: If necessary, repeat the series until obtaining an adequate stream of contrast.",
    "Repeat the latter sequence in the coronal plane (see Table 1, series 2: TR/TE of 2.8/1.3 ms; FA of 45°; thickness of 35 mm; acquisition time of 58 s) while the patient is expelling the residual rectal contrast.\nThen, instruct the patient to perform a steady-state Valsalva maneuver without interruption for 9 s.\nTaking the sagittal images acquired during the rectal emptying as a reference, select three horizontal planes in the axial plane (see Figure 3) to image the levator hiatus as follows: the first at the midsymphysis (level I), the second tangent to the inferior border of the symphysis (level II), and the third at the point of the maximal bulging of the anterior rectal wall (level III).\n\tNOTE: The reason for the above is to include most relevant anatomical areas inside and outside the hiatus boundaries of both sexes in the ROI: bladder base, urethra, vagina, cervix, perineal body, anorectal junction, endopelvic fascia, and fat recesses (female), or bladder base, retropubic space, prostate, seminal vesicles, Denonvilliers' fascia, anorectal junction, mesorectal fascia, and presacral space (male).\nAcquire a horizontal 1 cm-thick section in the axial plane (see Table 1, series 3: TR/TE of 3/1.5 ms; FA of 45°; thickness of 10 mm; acquisition time of 9 s) from each level during the Valsalva maneuver, leaving the patient a 60 s interval between two subsequent maneuvers to relax.\nFinally, acquire static T2-weighted images when at rest in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes (see Table 1, series 4, 5, and 6: TR/TE of 3649-4656/100; FA of 90°; thickness/gap of 4/0.4 mm; acquisition time of 3:00-3:44 min) to provide a complete evaluation of the pelvic anatomy.\n\tNOTE: Refer to Table 1 for the technical settings.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58534/58534table1v2.jpg",
    "Table 1: Technical settings for MR defecography, using a 1.5 T scanner and an external coil.\n4. Image analysis and measurements\nTo measure the position of the pelvic organs when at rest and while straining, from midsagittal dynamic MR images in the analysis software, go to the list of toolbar options positioned at the top of the screen and hover over Annotation Tools.\nThen, click on the arrow and select Ruler to obtain a linear measurement in millimeters of the vertical distance of the bladder neck, uterine cervix, prostate base, seminal vesicles, and rectal floor from two reference lines, as follows: express the distances by negative (proximal) or positive (distal) numbers relative to the hymen plane (female) or to a horizontal line drawn tangent to the inferior border of the symphysis pubis (male).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58534/58534fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Reference lines for pelvic organ descent on midsagittal MR images. (A) A 61-year-old woman with a rectal descent of >10 cm below the hymen plane (yellow line) and sigmoidocele. (B) A 42-year-old man with rectal intussusception and a descent of >3 cm below the lower border of the symphysis pubis (yellow line). bl = bladder; sp = symphysis pubis; ut = uterus; r = rectum; p = prostate.

    "To measure the hiatal area (in square centimeters) when at rest and during maximum strain, click again on Annotation Tools and choose Free-ROI to select a free-hand contour-tracing technique (see Figure 3).\nDepict the internal area of the levator ani muscle and express the differences between resting and straining measurements as absolute values and an increase in percentage from sections of the same level identified by the recognition of bony landmarks, namely the symphysis pubis and the ischial tuberosities (level 2).\n\tNOTE: Register any impingement of the organs within the levator ani hiatus and refer, for organ prolapse definition and grading, to the standards recommended by the international committee on pelvic organ prolapse14,15 and to the traditional \"HMO\" MRI classification system of pelvic organ prolapse described by Comiter et al.9.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58534/58534fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Method for levator ani hiatus imaging and area measurement. (A) A selection of three axial scan sections from a midsagittal image taken relative to the midsymphysis pubis (level 1), tangent to its lower border (level 2), and at the maximal bulging of the anterior rectal wall (level 3) during rectal emptying. (B) An example of an asymmetric area measured when at rest from level 2 with the free-hand contour-tracing method in a 52-year-old woman with a focal defect of the right pubococcygeus muscle (arrow). s = symphysis pubis; bl = bladder; r = rectum.The left panel = a sagittal view;the right panel = a coronal view.The area values are expressed in square centimeters.1 = first level; 2 = second level; 3 = third level.
