    "In vivo imaging Make two small fiducial marks indicating the anterior and medial directions of the cranial window respectively. Record vasculature structure image of the cranial window via a fluorescence or a brightfield image (using a green wavelength may give better image contrast of blood vessels). Name it image A. Generate in vivo retinotopic maps through the cranial window (i.e., intrinsic signal Juavinett et al., 2017 or fluorescence retinotopic map Zhuang et al., 2017). Name it image B. Image A and image B should be perfectly co-registered by nature given the imaging optical axis is perpendicular to the cranial window (Figure 2A/B).    Perfusion and cortex flattening (modified from Wang and Burkhalter, 2007)   Perform mouse cardiac perfusion under isoflurane anesthesia (5% isoflurane, Gage et al., 2012) with the following steps of perfusion fluids.   Saline wash 10 ml/min for 100 ml.   5 µg/ml DyLight 649 lectin 5 ml/min for 25 ml to label blood vessel.   Wait for 5 min for DyLight lectin to adsorb to tissue.   1% PFA (see Recipes) 5 ml/min for 90 ml.    With brain within the skull, acquire fluorescence image of cranial window (filter setting: 655/670 nm). The fiducial marks made in Procedure A should be visible. Name it image C (Figure 2C).   Collect brain tissue. Since the animal was perfused by 1% PFA, the brain tissue will be relatively soft for cortex flattening. Be careful not to make any damage.   Optional: Acquire bright field and fluorescence images (filter setting: 655/670 nm) of surface vasculature of the whole brain using a dissecting scope. The major surface blood vessels should be visible in the bright field image (can be registered with image A) and the DyLight labeled blood vessels should be visible in the fluorescence image (can be registered with image D).",
    "Isolate the cortical sheet of windowed hemisphere (the procedure can be done in a Petri dish sitting on ice). Carefully keep track of the orientation of cortical sheet. For video guidance, please see this EJN video protocol (made by Hoey Sarah, Universität Zürich): http://www.ejnnews.org/video-protocol-isolation-adult-mouse-hippocampi/[href=http://www.ejnnews.org/video-protocol-isolation-adult-mouse-hippocampi/].   Separate the two hemispheres of the brain with a razor blade. Keep the windowed hemisphere and discard the other hemisphere.   Cut off olfactory bulb with a razor blade.   Cut off brain tissue posterior to the neocortex (this include cerebellum, posterior midbrain and hind brain) with a razor blade.   From the medial side, gently pull out the thalamus, septum and striatum by using a spatula. Cut off these subcortical tissue.    Gently flip the hippocampal formation out and then separate it from cortex using a spatula.    Flatten the isolated cortical sheet on a slide glass with the pia surface against the glass. Cover the other side of the cortical sheet with a piece of sponge. Cover the sponge with another piece of the slide glass. Space the two slides with two coins (we used United State dimes with thickness of 1.35 mm). Clip the both sides of slides (Figure 1).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210191515_3988.jpg Figure 1. Sketch of the device used to flatten cortical sheet    Immerse the ‘sandwich’ made in Step B6 in 1% PFA overnight (in a Petri dish in 4 °C fridge). Make sure the whole ‘sandwich’ is fully submerged.   Remove 1% PFA and add 4% PFA (see Recipes) in the dish overnight.   Remove 4% PFA and add 20% sucrose in the dish overnight.   Remove the clips and remove the cortical sheet. Cut the outer edge of the sheet so that it is in an asymmetric shape and the orientation of the cortex (anterior, posterior, medial and lateral) is easy to identify.",
    "Take a fluorescence vasculature image (filter setting: 655/670 nm) of the flattened and cut cortex sheet before sectioning. Name it image D (Figure 2D).     Tangential sectioning of flattened cortical sheet Note: This is the crucial step and do it with extra caution.   Sufficiently cool the platform with dry ice before mounting (~10 min) the tissue and keep the platform frozen (dry ice always presented in the wells at the both end of the platform) for the whole sectioning process.   Embed flattened cortex sheet in OCT with cortical surface facing up on microtome platform.   Quickly put one glass slide on top of the cortex sheet before it freezes. Apply gentle pressure with fingers on the slides so that it flattens the tissue surface until it freezes.   Raise and adjust the platform against the dissecting blade, until the blade is perfectly aligned with the top surface of the glass slide. Lock the platform.   Lower the platform and warm the top glass slide with a finger to defrost the top surface. Remove top glass slide. Now the top surface of the cortical tissue should be perfectly parallel to the dissecting blade.   Slowly raise the platform until the frozen tissue touches the blade.   Check the alignment between frozen tissue surface and the blade carefully. Try very thin sections (~5 µm) to adjust alignment.   Cut the first section with 150 µm thickness. This is to make sure the first section is across the whole cortical surface and contains sufficient surface vasculature for later alignment.   Cut the remaining sections with 100 µm or 50 µm thickness through the whole cortex.   Soak the sections in 1x PBS in sequence in a 24-well plate.     CO staining (modified from Tootell et al., 1988)   Wash the sections with excess PBS (pH 7.",
    "4), 3 x 5 min, ~40 ml per wash.   Mount the sections on gelatin coated slides. Wait until completely dry.   Preincubate sections with pre-incubation solution (see Recipes) at room temperature for 10 min.   Rinse 4 x 5 min with rinse solution.   Incubate sections with incubation solution (see Recipes) for 1-6 h at 37-40 °C in the dark (or foil covered).   Check staining every 0.5-1 h until the reaction is sufficiently advanced and terminate the reaction by observing darkness of the tissue.    Rinse sections with rinse solution (3 x 3 min, see Recipes)   Rinse sections with dH2O (1 x 3 min)      Dry mount (all procedure should be performed under a fume hood)   Dry and defat through series of EtOH 50%, 70%, 90%, 3 min each.   Wash with 100% EtOH: 2 x 3 min.   Wash with xylene 1 x 5 min.   Coverslip with DPX right after xylene without drying the xylene.   Let the DPX solidify overnight.   Take brightfield images of the sections (image series E, for example of a section across layer 4 in this series see Figure 2E, showing architectonic labeling of primary sensory cortices and retrosplenial cortex)."
