    "1. Optional: Prepare Affi-gel Heparin Beads (Gel Beads) for FBM Attraction Assay\nNOTE: Prepare gel beads at least 1 day before starting the explant procedure.\nWash 100 μl gel heparin bead suspension with sterile PBS for 20 min on a roller at room temperature (RT).\nPellet beads in a table top centrifuge for 5 min at 13,000 x g. Add sterile PBS and repeat the washing procedure 4x.\nAfter the final wash, remove PBS and soak the beads in a small volume of a sterile solution containing the recombinant protein of choice, taking care to cover the beads with the solution. This protocol uses 100 ng/μl recombinant human VEGF165 in PBS to reproduce a previously published experiment16.\nIncubate the gel heparin beads with the recombinant protein solution for a minimum of 12 hr and a maximum of 1 week on a roller at 4 °C.\n2. Coating of Culture Inserts\nHindbrain explants are cultured on Corning culture inserts with an 8 μm pore size, or equivalent inserts. Culture inserts can be reused after completion of the protocol, provided they are washed with distilled water, sterilized with ethanol, and stored in 70% ethanol until needed.\nNOTE: The following steps should be carried out in a flow hood under sterile conditions.\nPrepare explant culture media consisting of Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (20 μl/ml), glucose (6 mg/ml) and penicillin/streptomycin (5 μg/μl).\nWash culture inserts with sterile PBS for 5 min and dry for 5-10 min under the flow hood.\nPlace one culture insert into each individual well of a 12well plate. Note: inserts may need a small push to fit tightly into the well.",
    "Cover the culture inserts with 10-20 μg/ml mouse laminin in Neurobasal medium and place them in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 1 hr. Note: Coating should be carried out on the day of explanting.\n3. Dissection of Hindbrains from E11.5 Mouse Embryos\nCull timed pregnant female mouse with an ethically approved procedure on embryonic day (E) 11.5 and place the uterus containing the embryos in a 100 mm plastic dish with ice-cold L15 medium.\n\tNOTE: All dissection steps must be performed in ice-cold L15.\nUsing a dissecting microscope and Dumont watchmaker forceps number 5, tear the uterine muscle wall to expose the embryos, release each embryo, sever the umbilical cord, and carefully remove the yolk sac.\nUsing a plastic Pasteur pipette with a wide-bore opening, transfer each embryo into a clean plastic dish with ice-cold L15.\nUsing Dumont forceps, decapitate the embryo just above the forelimbs. If the experiment requires genotyping of the embryos, collect tissue samples for genomic DNA isolation (e.g. a small piece of yolk sac or tail tip16,20).\nTurn the head dorsal side up and identify the 4th ventricle, which is covered by a thin tissue layer (Figure 2B). Carefully pierce the roofplate and begin to peel it away caudally along the midline over the posterior hindbrain and spinal cord, and rostrally over the midbrain. The hindbrain should now be exposed (Figure 2C).\nCarefully tease away the remaining head mesenchyme and any meninges that are attached to the pial side of the hindbrain (Figure 2D).\nRemove midbrain and spinal cord tissue so that the hindbrain unfurls and can lie flat in an open book preparation (Figure 2E).",
    "Using a wide-bore plastic Pasteur pipette, transfer each dissected hindbrain to a 12-well plate containing ice-cold L15 and store them on ice until all hindbrains have been dissected.\nUsing a wide-bore plastic Pasteur pipette, transfer a single hindbrain to an empty dish, keeping it an open book preparation, ventricular side up, in a droplet of approximate 100 μl L15.\nTransfer a few microliters of the incubated gel heparin beads to the same droplet. Note: Because the sizes of beads are variable, it is advisable to transfer around 10 beads and then choose an optimal size for transplantation into the hindbrain.\nMake a small tear in the hindbrain tissue and carefully insert 1-3 gel beads into the hindbrain tissue at the level of r5/6, about half way between the midline and the lateral edge of the hindbrain, lowering them into the tissue so that the bead is positioned just beneath the hindbrain surface.\n\tNOTE: The dissection procedure may take between 5-20 min/hindbrain, depending on experience, and may stretch over an extended period if litters are large; in any case, hindbrains should be in culture no longer than 3 hr post-mortem for good results.\n4. Hindbrain Explant Culture\nRemove the plate containing the culture inserts from the incubator, aspirate the laminin coating solution.\nPlace one culture insert into a separate culture dish filled with ice-cold L15 and, using a wide-bore plastic Pasteur pipette, transfer each hindbrain ventral side up onto the culture insert (Figure 2G). The hindbrain should lie completely flat on the insert membrane.",
    "Carefully lift the culture insert from the dish and dab it several times on clean tissue paper to remove excess liquid. This process ensures that the hindbrain adheres to the culture insert in a flat, open book preparation. If the hindbrain curls up, its tissue may irreversibly grow together.\nFill the original 12-well plate with 500 μl prewarmed culture media and place the insert back into this well. Carefully adjust the volume with another 400-600 μl of media to just cover the hindbrain, ensuring that the hindbrain does not float off the membrane. If it floats, return to step 4.4 and repeat until the hindbrain remains attached to the membrane.\nAt this stage, it is possible to add biological inhibitors of interest to the media to study their effect on the migration of FBM neurons. \n\tNOTE: If implanting beads or administering other treatments, it is recommended to maintain at least 2 control explants under normal growth conditions per experiment to ensure that the experiment has been set up successfully.\nIncubate explants for 24-30 hr in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\n5. Wholemount Immunofluorescent Staining of Hindbrain Explants\nAspirate the media from each well, rinse in PBS and fix for 2 hr at 4 °C with gentle agitation in ice-cold 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared or freshly thawed 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS). Note: Do not try to remove hindbrain from the culture insert before fixation is complete.\nRinse 3x with PBS. Carefully peel the hindbrains from the culture inserts using Dumont forceps. Some explants are difficult to peel off, but can usually be lifted by applying gentle pressure through repeatedly expelling PBS from a pipette.",
    "Transfer the hindbrains to 2.0 ml round-bottomed tubes for immunofluorescence labelling. Permeabilize hindbrains for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in PBS containing 0.1% TritonX-100 (PBT) with gentle rolling.\nIncubate for 1 hr at RT in PBT containing 10% heat-inactivated normal goat serum with gentle rolling.\nIncubate explants with gentle rolling at 4 °C for 5 days with primary antibody specific for ISL1, diluted 1:100 in PBT containing 1% heat-inactivated normal goat serum.\nWash the explants at RT 4x with PBT for 15 min each.\nIncubate explants with gentle rolling at RT for 3 hr with fluorophore-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (e.g. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti mouse, diluted 1:200) in PBT containing 1% heat-inactivated normal goat serum.\nWash the explants 4x at RT with PBT for 15 min each with gentle rolling.\nPostfix the explants in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at RT.\nCover a glass slide with 3 layers of black electrical tape and excise with a scalpel a small square of the layered tape to create a pocket for the explants; alternatively, use a depression glass slide.\nMount each hindbrain in SlowFade reagent into one pocket and cover with a glass coverslip, carefully avoiding to trap air bubbles and image using a laser scanning confocal microscope.\n\tNOTE: As an alternative to immunostaining, in situ hybridization with riboprobes that recognize FBMs (i.e. Isl1 or Phox2b) may be used to visualize FBM neurons16,21.\nSummary of steps and timing\nTimed mating to obtain E11.25 pregnancies: ~14 days\nOptional: Bead preparation (Protocol 1): ~2 hr, on the day before embryo isolation\nPrepare culture inserts and media (Protocol 2): ~30 min, before embryo isolation\nEmbryo isolation and hindbrain dissection (steps 3.1-3.4): ~10 min/embryo\nHindbrain dissection (steps 3.5-3.7): ~5-10 min/hindbrain\nExplant procedure (steps 3.8-3.9): ~5-10 min/hindbrain\nOptional: bead implantation (steps 3.10-3.11): ~5-10 min/hindbrain",
