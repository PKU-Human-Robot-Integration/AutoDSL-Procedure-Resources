    "All experiments presented in this work were conducted in agreement with the ethical standards defined by the German law for the protection of experimental animals. Experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\n1. Custom-made Multichannel Electrode Arrays for Microstimulation and Recording\nCustom-made microstimulation array\n\t\nFor delivering ICMS, prepare stimulation electrodes in the desired spatial design (here lateral array of 2 channels) using 3-cm long Teflon-insulated stainless steel wires (Ø with isolation = 50 µm). See Figure 2.\nCrimp one end of the wires to a male pin system (1.25 mm pitch).\nFor a 2-channel array with ~0.5 mm or ~0.7 mm electrode distance pass wires perpendicularly through two vertically aligned electron microscopy object-holder grids (distance of grids ~5 mm) guiding the wires (0.1654 mm pitch).\nGlue wires together with a small drop of dental acrylic about 4 mm above the endings of the wires that finally serve as electrode tips.\nPut male pins into the plug housing.\nPut the electrode in a dish with electrolytic solution (e.g., 0.9% sodium chloride) and measure the impedance of each channel with a respective impedance measuring device (e.g., FHC Impedance Conditioning Module). Aim at impedances in the 100 to 500 kΩ range.\n\t\t\nIf impedance is too high, deliver short electrical current (1 sec, 1 mA) through the channels to lower it. Check impedance again.\nCustom-made high resolution multichannel recording arrays\n\tNote: this protocol describes manufacturing of surface arrays for recording electrocorticogram (ECoG) data. However, designs can be tailored to meet the requirements of the respective research question (depth recordings, etc.). High resolution multichannel arrays are built by Teflon-insulated stainless steel wires (Ø with isolation = 50 µm) crimped to a male pin system (1.25 mm pitch).",
    "For surface electrode arrays, guide 18 wires through a 3 x 6 matrix of two prepared electron microscopy object-holder grids.\nEmbed the 6 x 3 arrangement of the wires between the grids with dental acrylic and put pins in the plug housing.\nGrind the dental acrylic into a rectangular block by using grinder attached to a hand held drill.\nCheck that impedance of all channels (see 1.1.6) is in the range between 100 – 500 kΩ.\nBefore implantation (see step 2) grind surface of the arrays to match the convexity of the cortical surface.\n2. Surgical Implantation of Arrays into Auditory Cortex in Anaesthetized Mongolian Herbils for Chronic Usage\nHold the official approval to execute all necessary experimental steps that are planned. Wear appropriate protective clothing (coat, sterile gloves, surgical mask, hood).\nUse adult male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) or any other rodent species.  Wear protective gloves and coat and always use sterilized and well identified surgical tools.\nIn case of gerbils, anaesthetize animals with an i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) diluted in 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution. Maintain by infusion of 0.6 ml/hr/kg of a mixture composing of ketamine:xylazine:sodium chloride (0.9%) in the ratio of 9:1:10.\nPlace animal on a heating plate for maintaining body temperature at 37 °C by a rectal probe feedback system (e.g., World Precision Instruments).\nShave fur covering interoccipital, parietal, and temporal bones. Aseptically prepare the incision site with an effective disinfectant (e.g., alternating Betadine or Nolvasan and 70% alcohol scrubs 3 times). Protect eyes against drying by eye ointment.\nCut the cranial skin covering the interoccipital, parietal, and frontal bones using a scalpel and remove periosteum by gently moving a drill over the bone surface.",
    "Drill small holes in the contralateral parietal and frontal bone as lateral as possible to not hinder the later head mount. Now screw two bone screws with a diameter of about 1 mm tightly into the holes. Ensure that the parietal screw has good contact to the dura, as it will be used as common reference and ground, as well as return electrode for electrical stimulation later on.\nGlue a small aluminum bar medially over the frontal bones and use it as head fixation during the implantation by a headholder.\nRemove skin covering the Musculus temporalis on one side using scissors.\nCut off the dorsal part of the temporal muscle to obtain admission to the temporal bone.\nExpose auditory cortex by craniotomy (~3 mm x 4 mm) of the temporal bone by using a dental drill. Identify location of the auditory cortex based on the typical blood-brain-vessel signature18,19.\nCarefully make an incision of the dura with a micro scalpel at the location where the stimulation electrode is implanted in the brain. Gently move along the surface till the dura tears to prohibit damage to the underlying neuropil.\nInsert stimulation array under micromanipulator control. Choose a tangential insertion angle to allow the epidural array to be placed over the region of interest. Depending on insertion angle and position and the aimed site of stimulation, carefully consider the insertion depth.\nPlace the epidural surface recording array with good contact to the brain surface covering the region of interest (here auditory cortex) by a second micromanipulator. Take care that the array matches the curvature of the cortex to not indent the dura.\nFixate both electrode arrays and their plug housings with dental acrylic to the skull.",
    "Cover exposed cortical surface with an antiseptic lubricant (e.g., KY-Jelly) and close craniotomy with dental acrylic (e.g., Paladur, Heraeus Ulzer). Keep in mind that polymerization may produce heat. Use sufficient lubricant between neuropil and dental acrylic to prevent any contact of the dental acrylic and the cortical surface, as this might cause tissue damage.\nNow allow the animals to recover before the start of any further procedure. Recovery times might differ between species (e.g., gerbils: ≥3 days, mice: ≥7 days). Monitor carefully the status of the animal and give analgesic treatment in the following days if applicable (e.g., Meloxicam; 1 mg/kg postsurgical and 24 hr after the surgery).\n3. Two-way Shuttle-box Designs Using ICMS as Conditioned Stimulus\nShuttle-box training\n\t\nPlace a shuttle-box (custom-build or any commercial product, e.g., E10–E15, Coulbourn Instruments) in an acoustically and electrically shielded chamber. The box contains two compartments separated by a hurdle. Consider the height of the hurdle as it influences the behavioral bias of go-responses. Use appropriate heights for specific species (e.g., ~2 cm for mice, ~3 cm for gerbils).\nTo apply the foot-shock (US), use a grid floor with a distance between the bars appropriate for the species under investigation12,15. Always take care that nothing electrically shortcuts the individual bars (feces, hairs, electrode cream).\nAfter a considerable recovery time of the animal (see 2.17), connect the subject to the recording and stimulation cable preferably without using any short-term anesthesia. Try to cover the animal with a towel and gently take the animal in hands. Uncover the head and connectors of the animal with the other hand and connect the cables.\nAllow animals to habituate to the training chamber for 3 min before start of each session.",
    "Per training session (1 - 2 daily) apply between 30 - 90 trials. Use trial durations of up to 15 sec, and inter-trial intervals that vary randomly between 25 - 30 sec.\nFor delivering ICMS for conditioned stimulation to the stimulation electrodes use a multichannel stimulator (e.g., MCS STG2000). To obtain behavioral effects without damaging the brain tissue, apply pulse trains (e.g., 300 ms length, 100 pps) of biphasic, charge-balanced pulses (cathodic first) with a 200 µs phase duration. Repeat trains with a pause of 700 ms for a duration of 4 sec (observation window).\nFor presenting auditory CS use an analog output PCI board (e.g., NI PCI-6733). Program these devices with Matlab to flexibly control and hardware-trigger the shuttle-box system via the digital output lines.\nRoute the analog output signal to the shuttle-box loudspeakers via an audio amplifier.\nConditionally deliver the foot-shock US through a grid floor. For optimal electrophysiological recording quality, generate the shock by a second high-end multichannel stimulator (MCS STG2000).\nTo apply detection training present only CS+ stimuli. Here, present blank trials without CS and US interspersed between the test trials (~10%) to correct for biased shuttle behavior (see 3.2). For a more demanding task, train animals to discriminate between CS+ and CS- stimuli presented in the same session in randomized order.\nClassify a compartment change after the CS+ onset within a critical time window of 4 sec (CR) as a hit response. In CS+ trials without CR in the critical time window (miss), immediately deliver a mild foot shock for 6 to 10 sec as unconditioned stimulus (US).\n\t\tNote: repetitive CS+ stimulation that overlaps with the US will reduce the learning effort for the animals and improve learning speed and performance ('delay' vs. 'trace' conditioning, see discussion).",
    "For CS- trials, classify a compartment change within the critical time window as false alarm response, and apply the US for up to 10 sec immediately after this inappropriate CR. Do not apply US after CS- when the animal stays in the compartment (no CR) during the critical time window, and classify this trial as correct rejection.\n\t\tNote: Importantly, the foot shock US is always turned off, when the animals changes compartment in response to it (escape). Use longer critical time windows for CS- trials, e.g., if repetitive conditioned stimulation are used, although this will impose a more conservative learning criterion as it affords higher effort by the animal to inhibit the CR.\nFor an effective association of CS and US adjust shock strength in a moderate range in order to be aversive but not painful. Optimal initial current strength differs between species (e.g., 50 µA for mice, 200 µA for gerbils). Therefore, please see the next two bullets for further technical details:\n\t\t\nIndividually adapt the shock strength in the first training session starting with mild amplitudes (~200 µA for gerbils). If foot shock strength it is too low, escape latencies jitter and association between CS and US is not optimal.\nAlways pay attention if animals start to vocalize and to freeze in response to the CS. In this case footshock strength is too high. This conditioned fear response interferes with avoidance learning.\nCarefully determine the escape latencies. Increase foot shock strength step-by-step if escape latencies are longer than 2 sec after the first 20 trials. Check after every training if the animal is under shock control, i.e., it shows escape latencies considerably below 2 sec.",
    "Note: However, avoid to increase foot shock strength too quickly, as the behavioral strategy of a highly stressed animal can fall back to pure escape responses. Therefore closely observe the behavior and particularly the response latencies while adjusting the amplitude of the US. For an example see Figure 3E.\nIf the animal shows the CR, stop presentation of the CS immediately. This is crucial for the reinforcement of the avoidance response.\nIf animals have acquired an avoidance strategy, i.e., show appropriate CR to all CS, vary parameters (ICMS amplitude, phase duration, repetition rate etc.) to perform psychometric analyses. Apply parametric CS variation in a blockwise fashion with US pairing, which however will induce learning and adaptation.\n\t\t\nTo avoid this, start with 15 to 30 trials of the original training, and then randomly intersperse the CS variations without US as test trials between the regular training trials with the original CS’s. Maximally use 25% of test trials.\nAfter the training remove the animal from the training chamber and carefully clean the complete box before training of the next animal. Try to avoid training different species at a time in the same box, as their natural smell might interfere with training performance.\nAnalysis of training data\n\t\nRecord all compartment changes in the habituation phase.\nRecord all compartment changes during the training and divide into hits and false alarms, escape responses (misses and back shuttles after a false alarm) and spontaneous intertrial shuttles (ITS).\nCalculate CR rates for CS+ and CS- as follows: hit rates = hits / number of CS+ trials; false alarm rates = false alarms / number of CS- trials.",
    "Obtain CR rates session-wise. However, to assess the learning dynamics at a higher temporal resolution, calculate CR rates from shorter blocks of the same number of CS+ and CS- trials (e.g., n = 10), respectively.\nPlot CR rates as a function of session or trial block for evaluating the training progress and learning dynamics.\nFor quantification of the behavioral sensitivity independent of experimental conditions biasing the response of the animal, derive d’ values based on signal detection theory8,9,17.\nFor d’ analysis use Z-scores of corresponding hit and false-alarm rates (discrimination learning) or hit rates and ITS (detection learning) derived from the inverses of a standardized normal distribution function and subtract these z-scores. Set a threshold criterion for stimulus detection of d’ = 1.0, which corresponds to a signal strength of one standard deviation above noise. See Figure 3 as example.\nAdditionally determine CR- and escape reaction times in response to different CS by measuring the time period between CS onset and behavioral response (complete compartment change).\nObtain a more detailed behavioral analysis from videotaping the shuttle-box behavior. Achieve temporal synchronization between video and recording systems by recording trigger pulses from the shuttle-box or stimulation system on the audio trace of the video. Video analysis allows to asses attention and orienting responses of the animal preceding the CR.\n4. In Vivo Electrophysiological Techniques in Learning Animals\nElectrophysiological recording during training\n\t\nDuring training, record electrophysiological signals (e.g., with the described ECoG-arrays) from multiple electrodes monopolarly against the common reference/ground electrode.\nFeed signals from all electrodes into a headstage amplifier either plugged directly or via a short adaptor into the head connectors.\nConnect the headstage to the main amplifier via a harness of thin, flexible cables wrapped by a metal mesh to protect it from damage by biting animals.",
    "Note: Mechanical stress in the cable harness can be relieved by a spring further permitting free movement and rotation of the animal in the box. Ideal is the usage of a turnable and motorized swivel. However, for auditory experiments place the swivel outside the soundproof chamber or sound shield it with foam to reduce the high frequency auditory noise produced by its motor.\nUse a preamplifier in the shielded box to increase signal-to-noise ratio and band-pass filter the signal in the desired frequency range.\nSample data at more than 1 kHz sampling frequency (for local field potential recordings) and at least 40 kHz (for action potential recordings) and store to the PC for offline analysis. Use suitable filter settings for both types (e.g. 2 - 300 Hz for local field potential; 300 - 4,000 Hz for action potentials).\nCarefully check quality of the recording before the start of training (no noise or movement artifacts). Apply an online FFT-filter to the signal to determine the amplitude of 50 Hz noise. If necessary double-check all connections between the head connector, the adaptors, the headstages, the cable harness, and the amplifiers.\nFor reduction of artifacts in the recorded data evoked by electrical stimulation use an interpolation procedure to reconstruct all data points affected by the artifact 1 ms before till ~5 ms after the onset of each pulse. For this, insert zeros between the unaffected data points, and apply a symmetric FIR-filter that minimizes the mean-square errors between the interpolated points and their ideal values (Matlab’s interp.m function). Apply this procedure to the raw signal, separately at each channel before further analysis9.\nTechnical details of parallel shuttle-box training, ICMS, and recording",
    "In general, ensure that animals feel comfortable in the box surrounding. Allow the animal to move freely and reach all corners of the box. Sufficient time to habituate a day before the first training (20 min) and before each session (3 min) is beneficial.\nAfter any surgical treatment, allow the animal sufficient time to recover including medication if necessary (see above 2.17) and start to train the animal only, if animals do not show any typical signs of suffer or pain (closed eyes, lethargic phenotype, scruffy fur20).\nEnsure proper electrical grounding of the grid floor. Ground loops between recording system, shuttle-box and the animal must be avoided. Ground the animal only via its common ground electrode, leaving the gridfloor at a floating voltage.\nConnect the multichannel stimulator (MCS STG2000) to the head connector of the implanted stimulation electrode array via separate lines of the motorized swivel.\nUse the common ground electrode of recording as the ground or return electrode for the ICMS, as well.\n5. Histological Analysis of Electrode Positions\nFollowing the complete training set, control for the stable position of the stimulation electrode array by histological analysis.\nAnaesthetize animals with an i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) diluted in 0.9 % sterile sodium-chloride. Then apply monopolar cathodic current (30 µA for 60 sec) delivered through all stimulation channels to obtain iron deposit in the tissue at the position of implantation8.\nFollowing this procedure, sacrifice the animal by an appropriate and approved method of euthanasia (e.g. intraperitoneal injection of an overdose of pentobarbital; 100 mg/kg).\nRemove the brain of the animal immediately and freeze it in 2-methylbutane cooled to -70 °C in liquid nitrogen.\nNow cut the region of interest on a cryostat microtome into 50 µm horizontal sections.",
    "Histology: Nissl and “Prussian Blue”-staining\n\t\nFor identification of cortical layers treat every second slice with Nissl-staining. First, bathe slices 5 min in 0.05 M sodium acetate trihydrate buffer (pH 4.0  -4.2).\nBathe slices for 5 - 10 min in 5% cresyl violet acetate. Rinse slices with distilled water.\nBathe slices for 2 min consecutively in 0.05 M sodium acetate trihydrate buffer (pH 4.0 - 4.2), and in solutions of 50%, 70% and 90% of ethanol, respectively.\nBathe slices twice in isopropanol : 96% ethanol (2:1) for 5 min each.\nFinally, bathe slices in Roticlear three times for 5 min.\nObtain location of the stimulation channels by “Prussian Blue”-staining of every other slice that makes the iron deposition evoked by long monophasic currents after the experiments visible.\nPrepare a fresh solution of 1% potassium hexacyanoferrat(II) trihydrate K4[Fe(CN)6] by mixing 2 g of K4[Fe(CN)6] in 200 ml of 1% HCl.\nAdd 800 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).\nBathe brain slices for 10 min with distilled water, and then for 10 min in the hexacyanoferrat solution.\nBathe slices twice for 10 min in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and finally for 5 min in distilled water.\nSubscription Required.
