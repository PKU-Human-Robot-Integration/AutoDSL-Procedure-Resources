    "1. Preparing DNA and protein samples to be imaged free of contaminants\nIsolate biomolecules to be imaged and place in a suitable aqueous buffer. Proteins to be imaged may be purified using liquid chromatography 6, immunoadsorption followed by removal of antibody and pellet 1,2, or Profinity eXact purification and tag removal 7 (Figure 2A). Isolate DNA molecules to be imaged by miniprep purification (Figure 2B).\nConfirm composition and purity of protein samples to be imaged using SDS-PAGE and western blotting. For DNA, confirm sequence and purity by completing a restriction digest and agarose gel electrophoresis.\nIncubate samples in an AFM adsorption buffer to promote adherence of the sample to mica. For protein samples, 10 mM HEPES buffer may be used. Additional low-ionic strength salts or other cofactors may be added as well. For DNA samples, include a divalent cation (e.g. Mg2+ or Ni2+) to promote adsorption to the mica substrate. A suitable Mg2+-containing buffer for DNA is 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 3. An alternative Ni2+ buffer is 10 mM HEPES, pH 6.8, 10 mM NiCl2.\nDilute the sample to a concentration of 5 μg/ml in adsorption buffer. Gently mix. Store on ice while the microscope is being prepared.\n2. Mounting AFM probe\nPlace the liquid cell probe holder onto the corresponding cantilever installation docking station.",
    "Locate the long, thick cantilever (referred to as the 'B' cantilever) of the sharp nitride lever (SNL) probe to be used for imaging. Carefully transfer it to the liquid cell probe holder, ensuring that the tip remains upright. Technical note: Extreme care must be paid while the probe is in transit, as dropping it from any height may damage or destroy the cantilever or tip. A microlever SNL (MSNL) probe may be used as an alternative to the SNL probe.\nRemove the probe holder from the docking station and examine the cantilever under a light microscope to ensure it is intact and properly seated in the liquid cell probe holder.\nCarefully remove the AFM head from the instrument dovetail assembly by tightening the knurled head clamp screw. Technical note: Extreme care must be paid while manipulating the AFM head, as dropping it from even a short distance (e.g. if not seated correctly in the dovetail assembly) may cause substantial damage.\nInvert the AFM head and firmly push the liquid cell probe holder onto the four pins at the base of the AFM head. Carefully return the AFM head into the instrument dovetail assembly. Release the knurled head clamp screw to fasten the AFM head into the instrument.\n3. Locating cantilever tip, aligning laser, and adjusting photodetector\nUsing the AFM instrument software, locate the cantilever tip by moving the knobs of the onboard light microscope. Adjust the illumination of the microscope if necessary to improve tip identification. Bring the end of the cantilever tip into close proximity of the crosshairs displayed on the instrument software. \nBring the cantilever tip into focus by adjusting the up and down arrows of the optics controller on the software. Use slow (S) or medium (M) speed while adjusting the optics.",
    "Align the laser to the cantilever tip using the laser adjustment knobs. Move the adjustment knobs until the red laser dot is inside the white illumination spot. Trace along the cantilever arm using a zig-zag pattern until the laser is positioned on the cantilever tip. When properly aligned, a strong reflection spot will appear in the front window of the AFM head.\nCenter the photodetector by adjusting the photodetector knobs on the AFM head. This will align the laser dot in the crosshairs of the photodetector display of the instrument software. The observed signal sum should be approximately 4-6.\n4. Positioning AFM head and tuning cantilever\nPlace a freshly cleaved sheet of mica attached to a metal AFM specimen disc on the magnetized sample holder atop the AFM holder plate. This setup will be used to position the AFM head prior to imaging the DNA or protein sample prepared in Step 1. \nTechnical note: The magnetized sample holder and liquid cell probe holder are thicker than other sample fastening mechanisms and probe holders. If there is currently insufficient clearance between the mica-sample holder assembly and AFM head, move the AFM head up by selecting the withdraw icon on the instrument software several times.\nRotate the AFM holder plate so the specimen disc is positioned for the initial imaging. Ensure the mica substrate is centered under the AFM head.",
    "Move the AFM head down toward the surface of the mica-specimen disc using the focus surface control of the instrument software. Select the medium (M) speed on the Z motor, and continue towards the surface until the AFM head is approximately 2 mm above the mica. At this time, switch to using the slow (S) Z motor speed in order to avoid abrupt contact between the probe and the surface (referred to as crashing the tip). \nProceed to move the probe closer to the mica substrate surface until distinct features on the mica surface or the tip reflection are in focus. Toggle between surface and tip reflection focal planes using the \"focus on:\" icon from the instrument software. \nSelect the tune icon from the instrument software and tune the cantilever. The resonance frequency of the recommended SNL and MSNL cantilever probes is 20-60 kHz. Select a 5% peak offset. Technical note: Adequate cantilever tuning is essential for adequate sample imaging.\n5. Imaging mica sample surface\nEngage the probe onto the mica surface. Set initial scan size to 10 μm and scan rate to 1 Hz. Integral gain and proportional gain can be initially set to 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. Adjust gains as needed in order to have trace and retrace scans roughly overlap. Decreasing the amplitude setpoint will increase the interaction between the probe and the mica and ensure engagement.\nCapture complete scan images of the 10 μm field. Decrease scan size to 5, 1, and 0.5 μm and capture complete images of each field. Adjust gains and scan rate as necessary. Capturing images of the mica surface provides a baseline for comparison to the DNA- and protein-containing samples.\nDisengage the probe with a single click on the disengage icon on the instrument software. \n6. Imaging biomolecules of interest",
    "Gently mix the DNA or protein sample prepared in Step 1 and prepare to load it onto the imaged  mica surface. Mix 5 μl of the prepared sample with 45 μl of fresh adsorption buffer (final sample concentration = 0.5 μg/ml).\nCarefully add 50 μl of the 0.5 μg/ml biomolecule-containing solution directly onto the mica surface. Do this without moving the probe or AFM head, and ensure the sample solution (but not pipet tip) makes contact with the probe. \nPause 5 minutes to allow the biomolecules in the sample to adhere to the mica surface. \nAt the conclusion of 5 minutes, pipet an additional 50-100 μl of adsorption buffer into the liquid cell probe holder being careful to not touch the probe, AFM head, or mica with the pipet tip. This will form a meniscus and allow for AFM tapping mode imaging in fluid. Figure 3 shows the final arrangement of the fluid cell, cantilever, sample, sample holder, and meniscus.\nReadjust the photodetector and realign the laser to the cantilever as necessary. Technical note: viewing the probe tip and laser alignment is complicated due to the diffraction pattern caused by adding sample buffer into the probe holder. Manually retune the cantilever, if needed.\nRe-engage the probe using the instrument software. Adjust vertical deflection, integral gain, and proportional gain as necessary. This will begin the process of re-imaging the section of mica scanned immediately prior to adding sample and capture images.\nIncrease scan size (500 nm-10 μm) to identify regions of interest. Zoom-in and reduce scan rate to 0.5 Hz to improve image resolution\nOnce imaging is complete, disengage the probe by selecting withdraw icon on the instrument software several times. Ensure sufficient clearance between the AFM head and specimen disc before disassembly of the liquid cell or specimen disc.",
    "Thoroughly rinse the liquid cell probe holder and specimen disc with distilled water to prevent salt crystals from forming as residual adsorption buffer evaporates. Dry with compressed air.\n7. Representative Results: \nExamples of AFM images are presented in Figure 4. Mica substrate (A) provides a molecularly flat surface onto which DNA and protein can adsorb. Imaging mica prior to biomolecule samples provides a negative control and assessment of imaging noise. It also provides a level of assurance that the cantilever is properly tuned and subsequent sample imaging will be successful. Double-stranded plasmid DNA (B, D), presumptively supercoiled, is readily identified by its asymmetric appearance and uniform depositing on the previously unremarkable mica substrate. Protein complexes of discreet particle sizes (C, E) are also uniquely distinguishable from the mica substrate. Particle size differences indicate sample heterogeneity, and can be useful to approximating protein complex stoichiometry or biochemical activity. The general diagonal shape and consistent orientation of the protein particles observed in Panel C is an imaging artifact, as proteins would expectedly be oriented on the mica substrate in a random fashion. Possible causes of the observed artifact is a physical tip abnormality or AFM imaging at too rapid of a scan rate. While tip convolution (illustrated in Figure 1B) prevents absolute length measurement calculations in the x and y axes, height measurement (z axis) and relative x and y measurements may be nonetheless useful for estimating biophysical properties of the imaged biomolecules.",
    "imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3061/3061fig1.jpgFigure 1: Schematic presentation of tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). A, the microscope. At the end of the cantilever is a sharp tip that oscillates up and down as it scans over the surface of a mica substrate to which biomolecular complexes adsorb. As the scanner moves in the x and y directions, a laser beam is reflected from the back of the cantilever onto a position-sensitive photodiode detector to map the vertical (z) distance the tip moves as it passes over the biomolecular complexes seated on the mica.  B. Distortion of the image in the x and y directions caused by tip convolution.  The nominal radius of a conventional silicon nitride tip is larger than the particles to be imaged, and the edge of the tip contacts the sample as it traverses the surface.  Tip convolution results in the imaged particles appearing larger in the x and y directions, but not the z direction.  This effect can be minimized by the use of tips with a smaller nominal tip radius.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3061/3061fig2.jpgFigure 2: Illustration of immunoadsorbed protein and DNA sample preparation. A, Release of immunoadsorbed GR•hsp70 protein complex from the monoclonal antibody (mAb)-protein A-Sepharose (PAS) pellet. Incubating the immunopellet with a peptide containing the mAb epitope will facilitate the release of the GR•hsp70 protein complex from the pellet, allowing the complex to be collected from the supernatant and visualized by AFM. B, Preparation of DNA for AFM imaging requires the use of a divalent cation adsorption buffer. The divalent cation increases the affinity of DNA for the mica substrate.",

Mica serves as a control image to compare with the visualizations of DNA and protein. GR•hsp70 protein complexes were prepared by immunoadsorption of GR primed with hsp70 and then released from the antibody-bead pellet using a mAb competing antibody (illustrated in Figure 2A). DNA was prepared by conventional plasmid miniprep. Panels A, B, and C are of an equivalent magnification (scale bars = 200 nm), as are Panels D and E (scale bars = 40 nm)."
