    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the institution's animal research ethics committee. All animal experiments were approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed under a 12-hour light-dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.\n1. Surgical Disruption of Mouse Tail Lymphatics\nUse eight week-old C57BL/6 mice of equal gender distribution.\nPlace a mouse under general anesthesia in an induction chamber with 3-4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen followed by maintenance sedation at 1-3% during the procedure.\nAdminister 0.5 mg/kg sustained-release (SR) buprenorphine subcutaneously for pain control.\n\tNOTE: Additional analgesic drugs administered post-op: Carprofen once every 24 h for at least 48 h and Bupivacaine once either after the incision was made or before closing the incision, applied by dripping onto skin edges (lasts up to 4 – 6 h).\nPosition the mouse dorsally and prep the tail with 70% isopropyl alcohol.\nMeasure the tail diameter prior to the procedure at 5 mm increments starting 20 mm from the base of the tail using a caliper. These measurements will be used to calculate volume using the truncated cone equation37.\nMark a 3 mm circumferential excision on the tail 20 mm from the base.\nPerform a meticulous 3 mm full-thickness skin excision with a sterile surgical blade (size 15), leaving all the underlying vasculature intact under surgical microscopic magnification. Incise the superior circumferential mark (20 mm from tail base) first through the dermis followed by a circumferential full thickness incision 3 mm distlal to the first incision.\n\t\nMake a perpendicular full thickness vertical incision to connect the two incisions. Use a toothed fine pickup to grasp a leading edge and use microscissors to carefully dissect deep within the avascular plane to the dermis and superficial to the vein adventitia.",
    "Inject 0.1 mL of isosulfan blue (1%) subcutaneously proximal to tip of the tail.\nIdentify the two lymphatic channels adjacent to the lateral tail veins under the surgical microscope. The lymphatics will appear blue because of isosulfan injection. Transect the lymphatics using straight microsurgical scissors. Use the scissors to carefully dissect a plane between the lateral vein and the lymphatic. Then pass the tip of one scissor blade between the lymphatic vessel and the lateral vein and close the blades to transect the lymphatic vessel.\nDress the tail wound with a sterile adherent clear dressing. Check post-op incisions daily to ensure that they are not infected or bleeding and provide wound care for 2 weeks. \nHouse the animals singly to prevent any further injury to the tail and to prevent the animals from biting each other, which would lead to surgical complications. \n2. Tail vascular assessment with laser speckle contrast imaging\nAnesthetize the mouse as in step 1.2.\nTo use laser speckle contrast imaging to visualize tail vascularity, set the width to 0.8 cm, height to 1.8 cm, point density to high, frame rate to 44 images/second, time to 30 seconds, and color photo to 1 per 10 seconds.\nEvaluate the venous and arterial perfusion for patency. Qualitatively, continuity of flow should be visualized.\n3. Functional lymphatic evaluation with near infrared laser angiography\nAnesthetize the animal as in step 1.2\nReconstitute indocyanine green (ICG) (25 mg/10 mL) and administer 0.1 mL subcutaneously into the distal mouse tail near the tip.\nDim the room lights. Place near-infrared laser angiography in buffering setting followed by live capture.\n4. Focal delivery of nucleic acid cargo to mouse tail using TNT\nAnesthetize the animal as in step 1.2.\nExfoliate the mouse tail using topical skin exfoliation cream.",
    "Immerse the mouse tail in collagenase solution (10 mg/mL) at 37 °C for 5 minutes.\nLoad DNA into the TNT2.0 chip reservoir35.\nPlace the TNT2.0 silicone chip device over the desired focal site of delivery on the tail with nanoneedles in contact with the tail.\nPlace a positive electrical probe in the reservoir. Attach the negative probe to a 30 G needle and insert the needle subcutaneously into the tail to the site of delivery.\nApply square wave pulse electric stimulation (10 x 10 ms pulses, 250 V, 10 mA).\nSubscription Required.
