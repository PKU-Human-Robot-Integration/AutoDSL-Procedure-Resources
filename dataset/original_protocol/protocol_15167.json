    "1. Methodology Overview\nThe proposed framework processes the brain CT images of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients to automatically calculate midline shift in pathological cases and use it as well as other extracted information to predict intracranial pressure (ICP). Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the entire framework. The automated midline shift measurement can be divided into three steps. First, the ideal midline of the brain, i.e. the midline before injury, is found via a hierarchical search based on skull symmetry and tissue features3. Secondly, the ventricular system is segmented for each brain CT image4. Thirdly, the actual midline is estimated from the segmented deformed ventricular system using a shape matching method5. The horizontal shift of the ventricular system is then estimated based on the estimation of the ideal midline and the actual midline. After the midline shift is successively estimated, features including midline shift, texture information of CT images, as well as other demographic information are used to predict ICP. Machine learning algorithms are used to model the relationship between the ICP and the extracted features6.\n2. Ideal Midline Estimation\nThis step detects the approximate ideal midline using symmetry of the skull. First, using grayscale thresholding, the skull needs to be segmented from the rest of the content in the CT image. After which, perform an exhaustive search to identify the rotation angles around the mass center of the skull. The optimal rotation angle is defined as the angle that maximizes the symmetry of the resulting halves of the skull. The approximate ideal midline is the line passing through the mass center point and has the optimal rotation angel with respect to the original vertical direction of the CT image.",
    "This step detects the posterior falx cerebri and anterior falx attachment to the margins of the sagittal sulcus. This step is performed to refine the identified approximate ideal midline. First define two searching rectangles centered at the two intersection points between the approximate ideal midline and the calvarium. Next, choose the sizes of the rectangles empirically so that they cover the anatomical features to be detected as explained below. The anterior falx attachment is detected as the peak point of the ridge on the calvarium and the falx cerebri is detected as the gray line in the posterior region3. \nThis step uses those features detected above to refine the ideal midline position. Once the peak point of the anterior falx attachment and the furthest point in the posterior falx cerebri from the calvarum are specified, the refined ideal midline is the line connecting the two points. \n3. Ventricle Segmentation\nFirst apply a low-level segmentation using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for each CT slice4,7. CT images can be divided into 4 types of tissue: bone/blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter and white matter.  For the initialization of the Gaussian Mixture Model, the parameters are estimated based on an iterative K-means segmentation result of the CT image. Then use the expectation-maximization (EM) method to optimize GMM iteratively to better represent the CT image. The hard segmentation result can be obtained by partitioning the CT image into regions based on the maximum probability of the membership that each pixel belongs to different region types.",
    "After the low-level segmentation of GMM, apply further constraints on the segmentation result in order to recognize ventricular regions. Only ventricular regions with size above a certain threshold are retained. Apply constraints on the location of ventricular regions as well using the brain bounding box and the set of ventricle templates. Extract the set of ventricle templates from a standard brain MR images and then enlarge it using the morphological dilation to accommodate variations among different subjects and pathological cases. \n4. Actual Midline Estimation\nSpecify the feature points on the ventricle templates extracted from MR.   \nDo the Multiple Regions Shape Matching5,8 between segmented ventricles and the MR template. \nEstimate the actual midline based on the identified feature points on the ventricle shapes using shape matching.  Then use the average of left side mean and right side mean of the x-coordinates of those feature points to define the x-coordinate of the midline. \n5. More Feature Extractions\nMeasure the intracranial hematoma/bleeding volume based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) segmentation results obtained from  the CT images. The segmented result may include small regions including venous sinus blood and falx cerebri, but they can usually be neglected in comparison to the regions of hematoma. Then count the number of pixels classified as blood for each slice and sum them up. The final sum quantifies the extravasated blood volume in the CT examination. \nExtract texture features.  First select six windows in each CT image which captures the gray and white matter but avoid the blood and ventricle structures in the CT image, see Figure 6. Then extract the corresponding texture features by using the following methods: Gray Level Run length9, Histogram analysis, Fourier analysis, Dual Tree Complex Wavelet analysis10. \nDemographic information and injury severity score are also collected.",
    "All extracted features of each CT image are aggregated to represent the entire CT examination. Specifically, min(f), max(f), median(f), mean(f), std(f) are calculated among all the selected features belonging to the particular CT examination, e.g. a feature Æ’ of the midline shift or a texture feature. For the intracranial hemorrhage amount feature, besides the 5 operators listed above, sum(f) is also added to record the total blood volume. \n6. ICP Estimation\n   The main idea of ICP estimation is to apply machine learning techniques to build a model based on a set of training samples. Then the built model is evaluated on the remaining test samples. Because of the high dimension of extracted features including those from the CT scans and demographic information, feature selection is important to remove unrelated features for a relatively simple thus stable model. Therefore there are two steps to be performed for ICP estimation/prediction. First, select the relative features which are informative in predicting ICPs. The second step is to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the learning algorithm to develop and evaluate the training model.  Software such as RapidMiner11  is ideal for this task because it is a very well developed tool for most of machine learning algorithms and provides very powerful interfaces to train and evaluate models.\nPerform the feature selection in two stages. First use the information gain ratio criterion in the first stage to select the top 50 features. In the second stage, use a genetic algorithm incorporating SVM to further optimize the feature selection. Then use the final set of selected features to build the model for ICP prediction in the following step.",
    "Perform ICP classification and evaluation through machine learning techniques. The top level diagram of the training and testing are shown in RapidMiner in Figure 8. Apply a 10 fold cross-validation scheme as the outmost layer for evaluation. In order to build a model with better generalization and avoid over-fitting to the training data, nest another layer of cross-validation inside each training fold. In these modules, first apply the feature selection process described above and then use a SVM for classification with its own parameter selection module6. \nSubscription Required.
