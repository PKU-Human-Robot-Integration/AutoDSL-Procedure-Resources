    "Ethics Statement: Zebrafish embryos were generated according to an approved IACUC protocol. These experiments were carried out in compliance with recommendations by the Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Organize Embryos for Injection and Create Stock Solutions\nGenerate requisite zebrafish larvae to assess cancer cell vascular invasion.\n\t\nSet up pair-wise or group in-cross mating with Tg(kdrl:grcfp)zn1;mitfab692;ednrb1b140 fish.\n\t\tNOTE: We generated Tg(kdrl:grcfp)zn1;mitfab692;ednrb1b140 zebrafish, by crossing Tg(kdrl:grcfp)zn125, which express green reef coral fluorescent protein in endothelial cells, with a line that lacks pigment cells, mitfab692;ednrb1b140, developed at the Zebrafish International Resource Center.\nCollect eggs, clean, and remove unfertilized or deformed embryos the next day22.\nIncubate embryos at 28.5 °C until ready for injection with cancer cells, to occur when the zebrafish embryos are 2-days post-fertilization (2 dpf).\nMake injection plates.\n\t\nMelt 25 ml of 1.5% agarose in dH2O for each plate.\nPour 12 ml of the agarose into a 100 mm x 15 mm petri dish and let it harden.\nRe-melt then pour the remaining agarose in the plate.\nImmediately position a cut glass mold (3 mm x 7.2 cm wide x 7.5 cm long) so that it is at a 30 degree angle to the agarose and positioned in the center of the plate.\n\t\tNOTE: This will create a steep 60° wall and a 30° sloped ramp.\nTape the glass mold in place and let the agarose harden.\nGently remove the glass mold and be careful not to tear the agarose.\n\t\tNOTE: Molds can be stored in dH2O at 4 °C.\nEquilibrate injection plate with fish water (0.3 g/L sea salt).\n\t\nRinse plate twice with distilled water.\nEquilibrate plate by adding 10 ml of fish water to the plate and place on shaker for 10 min.\nEquilibrate plate a second time with fish water.",
    "Split 2-day post-fertilization (dpf) embryos into injection groups by transferring them into dishes containing fish water22.\nPrepare recovery dishes for each group to utilize after injection. Ensure that the recovery dish contains 10 ml fish water, plus penicillin (25 µg/ml) and streptomycin (50 µg/ml).\nPrepare 2x tricaine solution by adding 4 ml of buffered tricaine stock (4 mg/ml,10 mM Tris, pH 7) to 50 ml of fish water plus penicillin and streptomycin.\nDissolve 15 mg low melting-point agarose in 10 ml of 2x tricaine solution to generate a mounting anesthetic medium that will immobilize live embryos for imaging.\n\tNOTE: Mounting medium consists of 1.5 % agarose.\nPull microinjection needles.\n\t\nPlace glass capillary tubing in a vertical pipette puller. Pull long tapered pipettes using 20 mAmp current and a 2-coil heating element.\n2. Labeling Cancer Cells with Lipophilic Fluorescent Dye\nMaintain cancer cells in their recommended culture conditions.\n\tNOTE: These lines were maintained in DMEM + 10% FBS: BT-474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and SK-BR-3. These lines were maintained in RPMI + 10% FBS: HCC 1806 and T-47D. All cell lines were maintained at 37 oC and 5% CO2 during incubation.\nGenerate a single-cell suspension by dissociating an adherent culture of cancer cells.\n\t\nWash cells first with PBS and then treat with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Trypsin exposure time will depend on the cell line.\nNeutralize the trypsin solution with serum-containing cell culture media after the cells detach.\nCentrifuge the trypsin-neutralized cell suspension for 5 min at 200 x g, then resuspend the cell pellet in fresh culture media for cell counting.\nCount the cell suspension using an automated counter and prepare 1 million cells in 200 µl of cell culture media.\n\t\nVerify cell viability with trypan blue dye exclusion before injection into zebrafish embryos.",
    "NOTE: Only viable cell populations should be injected into zebrafish embryos, as injection of dead cells will not reflect true vascular invasion.\nAdd 2 µl of red lipophilic dye to the cancer cell suspension for a 1:100 dilution, mix well, and then incubate the mixture at 37 °C for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Concentration of the dye and labeling time may need to be optimized for each cell line.\nFollowing the incubation, add 1 ml of fresh media to the tube and then centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g.\nWash away residual fluorescent dye from the cancer cells.\n\t\nAspirate the supernatant from the cell pellet, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of fresh culture media, and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g.\nRepeat the washing step a second time: aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of fresh media and then centrifuge again for 5 min at 200 x g.\nRepeat the washing step third time: aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of fresh media and then centrifuge again for 5 min at 200 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet containing 1 million labeled cancer cells in 500 µl of fresh media.\n\tNOTE: 0.5 mM EDTA can be added to the media to prevent cell clumping.\n3. Injecting Cancer Cells into the Pre-cardiac Sinus of Zebrafish Embryos\nAttach microinjection dispense system to a pressurized air source and turn on the microinjection dispense system power source.\n\t\nTest pressure by depressing the foot pedal. A brief pulse of air should emit from the needle holder.\nEquilibrate the injection plates twice with the 2x tricaine solution.\n\t\nFor each equilibration step, add 20 ml of 2x tricaine solution to the injection plate and place on shaker for 10 min.",
    "Use plastic pipette to transfer a group of embryos to a small dish containing the 2x tricaine solution.\nBackfill the microinjection injection needle with cancer cells using a gel-loading pipet tip.\n\t\nPlace the needle in an electrode storage jar with the pointed end facing down so cells settle near the tip.\nTransfer 20 - 30 anesthetized embryos to an injection plate by collecting the embryos with plenty of 2x tricaine in a plastic pipette.\n\t\nAllow embryos to settle in the tip of the pipette.\nGently expel embryos into the trough of the injection plate, spreading the embryos along the length of the trough.\nAlign embryos with heads facing up and bellies facing the steep wall of the trough.\n\t\tNOTE: Tricaine solution should cover both the trough length and the flat agarose surface, with embryos only residing in the trough. Embryos are now ready for injection.\nInject 50 - 100 cancer cells (2 - 5 nl) into the precardiac sinus of the zebrafish embryos using the microinjection dispense system.\n\t\nAttach the needle to the needle holder of a micromanipulator.\nPosition the injection plate under the stereoscope with the 60 degree wall to the left and focus on the top embryo at 25x magnification.\nPosition the micromanipulator so that, when extended, the needle will pierce the embryo.\nExtend the needle by eye until it is nearly touching the embryo.\nLooking under the microscope, align the needle so that it will pierce the embryo upon further extension.\nPierce the embryo through the yolk sac placing the tip just at, but not in, the pre-cardiac sinus.\nInject cells by depressing the foot pedal. The force of the injection expels the cells into the cardiac sinus. Retract the needle.",
    "Using the right hand, extend and retract the injection needle. With the left hand, make fine adjustments to position next embryo.\nReturn the needle to the electrode storage jar while setting up to inject another plate.\nTransfer the embryos to the recovery dish once the entire plate is injected.\n\t\nTilt the injection plate to pool the embryos at the bottom, washing any remaining embryos out of the trough, and collecting them with the plastic pipette.\nAllow the embryos to settle in the bottom of the pipette.\nTransfer the embryos to the recovery dish in a minimal volume of tricaine.\nIncubate recovery dish at 28 °C for 1 hr.\n\t\nSeparate viable zebrafish embryos from dead embryos and other debris.\nIncubate dish at 33 °C until ready for scoring, typically 24 - 96 hr.\n\tNOTE: This temperature is determined as a compromise between 37 °C, the ideal temperature for cancer cells, and 28.5 °C, the ideal temperature for zebrafish.\n4. Scoring Extravasation\nAnesthetize the batch of embryos to be scored by placing them in a dish with tricaine solution.\nPlace an anesthetized larvae on a depression microscopy slide in a drop of tricaine.\n\t\nOrient larvae laterally for optimal imaging of the caudal region.\nCount the number of cancer cells that have successfully invaded out of the vasculature by focusing up and down through the tail region to clearly discern intact cells.\n\tNOTE: It is best to have at least two individuals involved in this process, where the individual scoring the fish is blind to the experimental condition being assessed.\n\t\nScore larvae on a compound fluorescence microscope with the 10x objective lens. Use the 20x objective for any difficult calls.\n5. Mounting Embryos onto Slides and Subsequent Fluorescence Imaging\nMelt 1.5% agarose/tricaine solution and bring to 37 °C.",
    "Anesthetize the embryo to be imaged by placing it in tricaine solution.\nTransfer the embryo in a drop of tricaine solution to the imaging surface. Optionally use a glass-bottom dish or microscope slide.\nUse a glass pipette to remove the excess tricaine solution, retaining the embryo on the imaging surface.\nOverlay one drop of melted agarose solution over the embryo.\nQuickly, before the agarose polymerizes, use a delicate tool, like an eyelash brush, to orient the embryo laterally for imaging, giving extra care to ensure the embryo is flattened along the imaging surface.\nSubmerge the now polymerized agarose drop under tricaine solution.\nSubject the live zebrafish embryo to microscopic imaging.\n6. Modification: Injecting Cancer Cells Into the Yolk Sac of Zebrafish Embryos\nPrepare the microinjection dispense system and injection plates as previously described in section (3) of this protocol.\nLabel two cell populations with contrasting fluorescent dyes as previously described in section (2) of this protocol.\nInject 5 - 10 nl of 2 x 10^7 cells/ml into the yolk sac. Keep the injection volume constant to inject identical cell numbers (100 - 200 cancer cells) from each cell population\n\tNOTE: One may use transparent zebrafish embryos lacking fluorescent vasculature for this assay. Passive entry of particles into the vasculature can be controlled for by injecting fluorescent beads (< 10 µm) or, alternatively, a cell line that does not intravsate.\nRecover the injected embryos as previously described in section (3) of this protocol and then screen for successful injections.\n\t\nUse a stereoscope to screen and transfer viable embryos that were successfully injected to a new dish.\n\t\tNOTE: All embryos should have a consistently sized mass of cells located in the yolk. Embryos are discarded if the mass size differs or if any cells are located outside of the yolk.",
    "Transfer the viable embryos to a new dish if cancer cells are clearly seen in the yolk sac.\nIncubate dish at 33 °C until ready for scoring, typically 24 - 48 hr.\n\tNOTE: This temperature is determined as a compromise between 37 °C, the ideal temperature for cancer cells, and 28.5 °C, the ideal temperature for zebrafish.\nTo score intravasation, follow the guidelines described in section (4) of this protocol, but instead count the number of cancer cells that have successfully invaded into the vasculature of the caudal region.\nSubscription Required.
