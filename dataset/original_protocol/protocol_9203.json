    "1. Animal Subjects\n1.1. Treatment\nAll animal procedures should be performed with the approval of the local Institution's Animal Care and Ethics Committee and in accordance with the Use and Committee and National Institutes of Health guidelines, with measures taken to minimize pain and discomfort.\nOur mice were housed under temperature-controlled conditions on a 12-hour reverse light and dark cycle, while fed mouse chow and water ad libitum.\nFor studies of adult regeneration, mice should be at least 6 weeks of age when the sciatic nerve crush is performed. This age is beyond the time at which pruning of polyneural neuromuscular junctions take place.\nIn these experiments, we used 6-8 week old C57BL/6 mice acquired from Charles River. When comparing regeneration after sciatic nerve crush (i.e.: rate of axon growth) mouse strains should be the same, as differences in axonal regeneration have been noted between different inbred strains15,16. If genetically manipulated mice are to be used, littermate controls are most appropriate.\n1.2. Surgical Preparation\nAnimals are deeply anesthetized for surgery using a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Each animal also receives a subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (10 mg/kg) to minimize post-operative pain.\nBoth hindquarters are carefully shaved using a surgical clippers (Roboz, RC-5903) and depilation is completed with Nair hair removal cream (found at local pharmacy).\nSkin is cleansed using sterile cotton tipped applicators and betadine surgical scrub (Fisher Scientific, 19066452).\nOphthalmic ointment (Fisher Scientific, 19082795) is applied to the eyes using sterile cotton tipped applicators.\nThe mouse is placed on a clean stainless steel plate, under which has been placed a pre-heated homeothermic blanket system (Harvard Apparatus, 507222F). Animal temperature is maintained at 37°C.",
    "All limbs are taped down, with care taken to position the hind limbs symmetrically so that the knee joint makes a right angle with the body (Figure 1, panel A).\nThe surgical field is covered with a sterile drape. All instruments are sterilized by autoclave or hot bead sterilization (Fine Science Tools, 18000-45) and the surgeon wears a mask, gown, and sterile gloves.\n2. Reproducible Sciatic Nerve Crush\nAfter preparation, a semi-circular incision across midline (Figure 1) is made in the skin. The skin is gently dissected from the underlying musculature, and folded over to remain out of the way during the procedure. It is kept moist using applications of 0.1 mL sterile saline (Hospira, 0409-4888-20) during the procedure.\nOpening the fascial plane between the gluteus maximus and the anterior head of the biceps femoris reveals the sciatic nerve (Figure 1, panel A). For a surgical control, the contralateral sciatic nerve should be exposed and mobilized, but left intact. The gluteal musculature is then re-opposed and sutured using a 6-0 braided silk, non-absorbable sutures (Roboz, SUT-1073-11).\nThe experimental sciatic nerve is then exposed in the same fashion, with retractors in place to ease visualization (Figure 1, panel B). The retractors are sterilized prior to use.\nNote: although retractor systems are commercially available, they are often quite expensive. We were able to make a satisfactory retractor system using inexpensive hardware supplies and insect pins (see Materials section).\nThe sciatic nerve is then gently freed from the surrounding connective tissue using iridectomy scissors.",
    "Using a fine 5/45 (Fine Science Tools, 11251-35) forceps, the nerve is placed on the bottom jaw of a super-fine hemostatic forceps (Fine Science Tools, 13020-12). The three fascicles are sequentially aligned, not on top of each other (Figure 1, inset B). The hemostatic forceps have been engraved with a mark at 1.5 mm from their tip. The outermost portion of the sciatic is placed in line with this mark before crush. This ensures a crush of uniform width, and that the nerve does not extend beyond the jaws of the hemostatic forceps when flattened due to the crushing force. If the nerve extends beyond the forceps tip the nerve will only be partially crushed.\nThe crush is made perpendicular to the nerve at 45 mm from the third toe, as measured by a thread that approximates the path of the sciatic nerve. The nerve is crushed once for 15 seconds at 3 clicks of the hemostatic forceps. Care is taken not to stretch the nerve. When the hemostats are re-opened, the entire nerve should be translucent at the crush site.\nA second pair of hemostatic forceps (identical to the first) that has been pre-dipped in powdered carbon (Fisher Scientific, C272-500) is used to mark the crush site. The nerve is crushed at the same crush site for 15 seconds at 3 clicks. No carbon marking should extend beyond the boundary of the initial crush. This is particularly important if precise marking of the crush site is required. Prior to use, carbon powder is sterilized by exposure to UV light for two hours, and thereafter is handled using sterile technique.",
    "To pre-dip the forceps in carbon but preclude widespread carbon at the surgical site, the forceps are opened in powdered carbon, then gently closed (but not clicked) shut, and the carbon on the outside of the hemostats is wiped off using sterile gauze. The forceps are checked under at least 3x magnification to verify that the crushing surfaces are evenly coated in powdered carbon. If necessary, they are re-dipped and wiped.\nThe gluteal musculature is re-opposed and sutured in the same way as the contralateral side.\nFinally, the skin incision is closed using 9 mm reflex clips (World Precision Instruments, 500346; Applier: 500345). If 9 mm reflex clips are found to restrict movement, smaller reflex clips or 6-0 sutures (Roboz, SUT-1073-11) can be used instead.\n3. Post-Operative Care\nFollowing the procedure, animals are placed on a heating pad at 37°C until they show signs of movement.\nThey are then moved back to their home cage, where water and food are readily accessible on the floor in the form of Hydrogel and wetted food.\n4. Semi-Thin Preparation\nFollowing an overdose of pentobarbital (300 mg/kg) the leg musculature is removed to expose the sciatic nerve*. With the nerve remaining in situ, the hindquarter is immersed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer on ice for 30 minutes.\n*If completing whole mount muscle preparation, muscles are harvested before exposing the sciatic nerve. \nThe nerve is carefully removed, with care taken to only handle the proximal end. Then the nerve is post-fixed in the same fixative for three additional hours.\nAfter fixation the nerve is rinsed three times in 0.1 M phosphate buffer.\nThe nerve is immersed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for one hour.",
    "The nerve is then dehydrated by sequential immersion in increasingly concentrated ethanol (50%, 70%, 80%, 95%, 100%, 100%, 100%). Each immersion is 15 minutes.\nThe dehydrated nerve is incubated twice in propylene oxide for three minutes each.\nThen the nerve is immersed in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and Embed 812 for at least 6 hours (usually overnight).\nThen the nerve is immersed in a 2:1 mixture of propylene oxide and Embed 812 overnight.\nFinally, the nerve is immersed in pure Embed 812 for six hours, then embedded in the appropriate mold and baked at 60°C for 48 hours.\n1.0 μm sections are cut from the distal nerve stump at a set distance from the crush site using an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica) with a glass knife and stained with toluidine blue. Thin sections may also be produced for examination of ultrastructure by electron microscopy.\n5. Whole Mount Muscle Preparation\nFirst mice are sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital (300 mg/kg) and the hind limbs are removed at the knees.\nFour muscles in the hind limb are removed for analysis: the tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus, and peroneus longus.\nAll muscles are removed via careful dissection and pinned through their connective tissue to a black sylgard (Fisher Scientific, NC9492579) coated dish. They are rinsed in PBS, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes.\nThe TA is then rinsed in PBS, embedded in O.C.T (Fisher Scientific, 14-373-65), and quickly frozen in a bath of acetone and dry ice.\n\t\nIt is stored at -80 °C for thin sectioning in case whole mount preparation fails. In general, the TA is too thick for adequate whole mounts.",
    "The EDL, soleus, and peroneus longus are rinsed for 3 x 10 minutes in PBS, placed in 0.1 M glycine* (Fisher Scientific, AC12007-0010; diluted in PBS) for 30 minutes, and rinsed 3 x 10 minutes in PBS again. They are then quenched in ice cold 100% methanol for exactly 5 minutes at -20°C, rinsed 3 x 10 minutes in PBS, and bathed in fluorescently conjugated alpha-bungarotoxin (diluted 1:200 in PBS) for 30 minutes. The muscles are rinsed for 3 x 10 minutes in PBS, followed by a 1-hour block in 2 % BSA (KPL, 50-61-00) and 0.2 % Triton X-100 (Dot Scientific Incorporated, 9002-93-1) in PBS*, and incubated overnight while rocking at 4 °C in a cocktail of primary antibodies diluted in the same 2% BSA/0.2% Triton block.\n*Glycine and blocking solutions are made on the same day as muscle harvesting and stirred for 30-60 minutes at room temperature prior to use. \nTo mark axons and neuromuscular synapses, we use a combination of a mouse monoclonal neurofilament marker (Covance, SMI-312R; diluted 1:1000), a mouse monoclonal synaptic vesicle marker ( SV2 DSHB, diluted 1:1000), and rhodamine conjugated alpha-bungarotoxin (Sigma- Aldrich, diluted 1:200). To mark reactive Schwann cells we use rabbit anti-GAP-43 (Novus Biologicals, NB300-143, diluted 1/500). The primary antibodies are visualized with an IgG1 subtype specific fluorescein conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and DyLight 649 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch, diluted 1:200).\nThe following day, the muscles are rinsed in PBS for 3 x 10 minutes, and incubated in secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 (in 2% BSA/0.2% Triton blocking solution). They are then rinsed 2 x 10 minutes in PBS, followed by a 5-minute immersion in DAPI (Invitrogen, D3571; diluted to 300 nM in deionized water), and another 10-minute rinse in PBS.",
    "Each muscle is then dissected on a black sylgard (Fisher Scientific, NC9492579) coated petri dish. Initially the tendons are removed at their insertion points into the muscle, and then the muscles are thinned by peeling away interior muscle fibers (Figure 3, panels A-C). Care is taken to preserve exterior surface of the muscle, including the endplate bands (Figure 3, panels D-F). The resulting muscles are mounted on plus slides (Fisher Scientific, 12-550-15) with vectashield (Vector Laboratories, H-1000) and 22 x 40 mm glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific, 12-548-5C) sealed by clear nail polish on two sides. When properly mounted on the slide the endplate band contacts the coverslip.\n6. Measuring Regeneration\nRegeneration may be estimated in all three muscles (peroneus, EDL, and soleus). We often examine regeneration fourteen days after nerve crush, a time at which a substantial percentage of NMJs are re-innervated. Both earlier and later time points are also suitable, depending upon the scientific question being asked. In each muscle, re-innervation of the entire endplate band is examined. Only en face surface NMJs are scored. In this fashion, at least 200 NMJs per muscle may be quickly examined.\nTo score muscle re-innervation we determine a \"re-innervation ratio\". The denominator is the number of denervated neuromuscular junctions as labeled by α-bungarotoxin binding and Schwann cell GAP-43 immunoreactivity. The numerator is the number of re-innervated NMJs as labeled by neurofilament/SV2 immunoreactivity. If needed, NMJs may be classified as either partially (incomplete coverage of α-bungarotoxin by SV2) or fully (complete coverage of α-bungarotoxin by SV2) re-innervated. For examples of re-innervated and denervated NMJs see Figure 3, panels G and H.\n7. Representative Results\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3606/3606fig1.jpg",
