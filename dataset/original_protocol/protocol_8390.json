    "All experiments involving animals were approved by the Comité Institutionnel des Bonnes Pratiques avec les Animaux de Recherche (CIBPAR) at the CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center and were conducted in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care's guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals (Ed. 2).\nThe protocol described here was optimized for electroporation of embryos at embryonic day (e) 13.5, at a time when MGE-derived INs are actively generated, before the peak of CGE-derived INs production45,46. Furthermore, to bias the electroporation towards GABAergic INs, we use a promoter selectively expressed in INs (for instance the Dlx5/6 promoter with its minimal enhancer)47.\n1. Preparation of Solutions for Electroporation and Organotypic Slice Cultures\nPrepare 125 mL of sterile culture medium.\n\t\nMeasure 125 mL of regular neuron-specific culture medium (see Table of Materials for formulation) in a sterilized bottle in a previously UV-sterilized biosafety cabinet sprayed with 70% ethanol. Add 2.25 mL of 50x serum-free neuron-specific supplement, 1.75 mL of 200mM glutamine (final concentration of 0.5 mM) and 6.25 mL of heat-inactivated horse serum previously aliquoted under sterile conditions. Mix thoroughly, aliquot in 15 mL sterile conical tubes, and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepared culture medium can be stored for up to 3 weeks at 4 °C.\nDivide a 100X stock solution of Botteinstein's N-2 formulation48 into 150 µL aliquots under sterile conditions and freeze at -20°C until use.\nPrepare 1 L of sterile artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF).",
    "Measure 800 mL of distilled water in a 1 L beaker. Add 25.67 g of sucrose, 5.08 g of sodium chloride (NaCl), 2.18 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), 1.80 g of glucose, 0.19 g of potassium chloride (KCl), 0.15 g of monobasic anhydrous sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), 1 mL of 1M stock CaCl2.2H2O and 2 mL of 1M stock MgSO4.7H2O. Stir to dissolve at room temperature. Add distilled water to reach a total volume of 1 L.\nUsing a 0.22 µm filter, filter the solution into a sterile bottle in a sterilized biosafety cabinet and store at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nPrepare a fresh solution of 4% agarose in ACSF before each experiment.\n\t\nMeasure 25 mL of previously prepared ACSF in a 50-mL sterile conical tube and add 1 g of low-melting point agarose.\nHeat for 45 s in a microwave oven. To avoid spilling, interrupt heating every 3 - 4 s when boiling starts, open the tube to let the pressure out, close it again and agitate manually to mix the agarose. Repeat until the agarose solution is homogeneous. Keep the agarose solution at 42 °C during the remainder of the experiment to avoid solidification.\n\t\tNOTE: Higher temperatures will damage brain tissues.\n2. Preparation of Plasmids for Injection\nPull a glass microinjection pipette\n\t\nSet the micropipette puller with the proper parameters, secure the glass capillary in the provided space and make sure it is centered with the filament.\nPress the pull button.\nCarefully remove the newly made microinjection pipettes from the heat puller and place in a box or clean petri dish until further use to avoid damaging the tip.",
    "Set-up the biosafety cabinet with all the instruments needed for this experiment (see Figure 1A), generously spray all instruments in the biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol and sterilize the instruments and environment with UV light for 15 - 20 min.\nDuring the sterilization step, thaw plasmids on ice (4 °C).\nMeasure 10 µL of the plasmid from a stock solution (4 µg/µL) into a clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Add 0.01% of Fast Green FCF. Mix gently, spin briefly and keep on ice until use.\n\tNOTE: Maxi-prep DNA should be prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol using an endotoxin-free maxi-prep kit. DNA can be solubilized in TE buffer or nuclease-free H2O and the preparation of the plasmid with dye solution can, but does not need to be performed under sterile conditions. Plasmids from Maxi-prep should be aliquoted to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Aliquoted plasmids should be mixed with the dye no more that 2 h before use and should not be refrozen for further use.\nAfter sterilization, prepare the nano-injector as follows.\n\t\nChoose one of the previously prepared glass microinjection pipette stored in a clean box or petri dish and use small tweezers to cut the tip of the pipette in a beveled way to achieve an outer diameter of roughly 15 µm.\n\t\tNOTE: The outer diameter given here is an approximate measure to give the user an idea of what we use in our experiments and has been optimized in order to facilitate the piercing of the skull for plasmid injection without damaging the brain, while allowing for the fluid loading and release of the DNA. The outer diameter can be measured by looking at the cut tip of the glass microinjection pipette apposed to a micrometric scale bar under a bright field microscope.",
    "Use a syringe to fill the micropipette with mineral oil from its unpulled end (to expel all the air).\nInsert the filled glass micropipette in the nano-injector by following the manufacturer's instructions.\nEmpty 2/3rds of the glass micropipette (keeping enough oil to prevent air entry).\nCarefully insert the prepared micropipette in the tube containing the plasmid/dye solution and fill the glass micropipette with the plasmid/dye solution.\n3. Collection of Mouse Embryos from Pregnant Females\nMonitor breeding females daily to assess for vaginal plugging, preferably at the same time daily (early afternoon). Day e0.5 corresponds to the first day when a vaginal plug is observed.\n\tNOTE: The experiments described here can be conducted in wild-type mice. However, to facilitate the identification of the MGE and to label all GABAergic INs (or specific sub-sets such as MGE-derived INs), transgenic animals can be used (e.g.: GAD67EGFP; Dlx5/6Cre with a Cre-reporter allele, etc.47,49). In this situation, the experimental plasmid injected should express another fluorophore (for instance mCherry or TdTomato) to allow visualization of the transfected INs (yellow) that can be compared with non-transfected INs (green).\nSacrifice the female at embryonic day e13.5, by neck dislocation.\n\tNOTE: Anesthetic agents given at the time of sacrifice may impact IN migration and survival50,51 and should be avoided.\nCollect embryos by C-section as follows.\n\t\nGenerously spray the female abdomen with 70% ethanol. Pull the abdominal skin up with a pair of sterilized forceps and, with the other hand, use sterilized surgical scissors to cut the skin from the abdomen.\nWith a second pair of sterilized forceps and scissors, pull the abdominal fascia up and cut it while carefully avoiding the uterus.",
    "Using a third pair of sterilized forceps and scissors, pull the uterine horns and cut them out of the pelvic cavity. Place the dissected uterine horns in a sterile 60-mm petri dish filled with neural-based culture medium supplemented with amino acids, vitamins and inorganic salts (see Table of Materials for commercially available product).\nIn a sterile biosafety cabinet, use two pairs of fine tweezers (one in each hand) to dissect the embryos out of the placenta and isolate the heads by decapitation.\nBevel-cut the tip of a sterile 3 mL plastic transfer pipette, aspirate the heads and transfer them in a new sterile 60-mm petri dish layered with solidified black wax and filled with the same neural-based supplemented culture medium as above.\n\tNOTE: This step minimizes the transfer of contaminants (mouse hair, blood). The black wax is used to stabilize the head during dissection. Culture media do not need to be oxygenated during these procedures.\n4. Intraventricular Plasmid Injections and Ex Vivo Electroporation of the MGE\nNOTE: The following steps must be performed under sterile conditions in the previously prepared biosafety cabinet.\nPlace the 60-mm petri dish layered with black wax and containing the decapitated heads in neural-based supplemented culture medium under the binoculars in the biosafety cabinet.\nStabilize the head, the rostral part facing right, with fine tweezers with the left hand and use the nano-injector in the right hand to inject 1 - 2 µL of the plasmid/dye solution into the right lateral ventricle.\n\tNOTE: Co-expression experiments can be conducted by co-electroporating a rescue plasmid and a shRNA-expressing plasmid by mixing both plasmids at equimolar concentrations.\nElectroporate the injected brain.",
    "Place the head between the electrodes with the negative electrode positioned dorsally and parallel to the head and the positive electrode towards the ventral side of the head to target the MGE.\nOnce the electrodes are well positioned, deliver 4 square pulses of 40 V for 50 ms at 500 ms inter-pulse intervals.\nRemove any residual tissue from the electrodes using tweezers already placed in the biosafety cabinet.\n\t\tNOTE: These parameters have been optimized specifically for the electroporator used in our experiments. We recommend that the users perform optimizing tests beforehand if using a different type of electroporator.\nRepeat steps 4.1 to 4.3 for all remaining brains.\n\t\tNOTE: Although this protocol describes the manipulations required for one brain, it is possible to inject up to 4 brains sequentially before electroporating each brain, thus increasing the yield. This strategy is especially advantageous when 2 or more different plasmids are injected sequentially (e.g. control or experimental plasmid) during the same experiment (allowing for comparison between littermates). In addition, it is possible to inject and electroporate simultaneously both sides of the brain to increase the yield, by positioning the electrodes completely parallel to the brain surface.\n5. Brain Dissection and Organotypic Slice Cultures\nWhile still manipulating in the sterile environment of the biosafety cabinet, dissect the brain out of the skull.\n\t\nStabilize the head on the layer of black wax by inserting a needle into each eye while carefully avoiding the brain.\nUse a pair of fine tweezers to hold the left side of the neck and a second pair of fine tweezers to tear the skin from the skull, from back to front.",
    "While holding the head laterally with tweezers in one hand, use another pair of tweezers in the other hand to carefully cut the skull at the level of the brainstem and gently pull the skull up. With each tweezer, cut the skull in the sagittal plane (midline) towards the front, and then incise laterally to liberate the skull fragments.\nLift the brainstem and carefully cut the meninges and cranial nerves until the brain is completely out of the skull.\n\t\tNOTE: All steps described in 5.1 should be performed under stringent sterile conditions in a biosafety cabinet.\nEmbed the brain in 4% low-melting point agarose for sectioning.\n\t\nFill a 35-mm petri dish with the agarose solution prepared above (kept liquid at 42 °C).\nQuickly transfer an electroporated brain to the agarose-filled dish using the previously cut transfer pipette. Keep the dish at room temperature.\nStir the agarose with a metal stick to keep the brain in the middle of the well (to prevent sinking) and position the brain in a rostro-caudal plane parallel to the dish. Stop stirring when the agarose starts to solidify, to avoid any brain damage.\nUse a razor blade to cut the agarose surrounding the brain in order to form a rectangular block, leaving a margin of 1 - 2 millimeters around the brain. Ensure that the rostral part of the brain is perpendicular to the anterior limit of the block to facilitate orientation for the subsequent sectioning steps.\nRepeat for each brain.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to cut more than one brain at a time (maximum 3) by shaping separate agarose blocks while setting each brain at different heights.\nVibratome coronal sections and slice culture.",
    "Thaw one aliquot of 100X N-2 supplement (150 µL) on ice and add to 15 mL aliquoted culture medium under sterile conditions.\nTransfer 750 µL of culture medium (with 1X N2 supplement) to each well of a 6-well culture plate.\nWith curved tweezers, place one cell culture insert (30 mm diameter, 0.4 µm pore size, PTFE) in each medium-filled well.\nFill the vibratome bath with continuously oxygenated ACSF. Cool to 4 °C with ice surrounding the bath, or use a refrigerated vibratome.\nSet the vibratome speed to 0.150 mm/s and the frequency to 80 Hertz.\nGlue the agarose block on the vibratome platform, rostral edge facing down and ventral edge facing the user.\nCut the brain in coronal sections to obtain 250 µm-thick sections (at 4 °C).\nWith sterilized spatulas, collect 2 - 3 sections containing the MGE and place all brain sections from one animal on a single 30-mm membrane insert, while carefully avoiding overlap between sections. Place the insert in one well of a 6-well culture plate (containing 750 µL of supplemented culture medium, as described above). Alternatively, each section can be placed on a separate 13-mm diameter membrane in a 12-well culture plate filled with 500 µl supplemented culture medium. The amount of culture medium recommended for each well allows the brain sections to be nourished by the media without being submerged.",
    "NOTE: The steps described in 5.3.6 and 5.3.7 are not carried out under complete sterile conditions, unless the vibratome can be sterilized and used in a biosafety cabinet. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct these steps carefully to avoid any contamination. Appropriate protective equipment (clean mask, surgical gloves and lab coat) should be worn at all times and body parts, even covered, such as hair, face and hands, should never pass over culture plates (with or without culture medium). It is also recommended to spray 70% ethanol frequently on the gloves and spatulas used to collect the brain sections.\nPlace the culture plate in a ventilated sterile incubator at 37 °C with 60% humidity and 5% CO2 for 48 or 72 h.\n\t\tNOTE: These incubation times were optimized for time-lapse imaging of MGE-derived INs and confocal imaging of fixed slices, respectively. Optimal incubation times should be tested beforehand for each experimental design. In addition, if the chosen incubation is 72 h and under, there is no need to change the culture medium. For longer incubation times, the culture medium should be changed every 2 - 3 days.\nAfter the desired incubation time, transfer the sections of interest to an 8-chambered coverslip and add 3 - 5 µL of culture medium. Place the coverslip in an environmental chamber (37 °C, 60% humidity, 5% CO2) connected to an inverted spinning disk confocal equipped with a computer-assisted acquisition software to set-up the time-lapse imaging session.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, sections can be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature) and subsequently immunostained with different antibodies for visualization of the morphological features of electroporated INs under a confocal microscope. Although eGFP and mCherry can be visualized by confocal microscopy without any counter-staining procedure, we recommend performing immunohistochemistry against GFP and mCherry to enhance the signal since the fixation process can reduce fluorescence, reducing the detection of finer components of embryonic neurons, such as smaller branches in the leading or trailing processes.\nSubscription Required.
