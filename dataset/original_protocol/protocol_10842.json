    "1. Standard and Internal Standard Mixes\nBefore lipid extraction, one must prepare a standard mix (SM) and an internal standard mix (ISM). For the SM, aliquot the equivalent volume of 1 μg of each standard (25 total) listed in the reagent table below, using a calibrated syringe, into a 10 mL volumetric flask. Dry the standards under nitrogen and reconstitute in 10 mL of acetonitrile (ACN). The final concentration of the standard mix will be 100 pg/μL. Divide into 1 mL aliquots and store at -80°C until needed.\nFrom this standard mix, 6 standard dilutions can be made for a total of 7 calibration standards (1 pg/ μL, 2 pg/ μL, 5 pg/ μL, 10 pg/ μL, 20 pg/ μL, 50 pg/ μL, and 100 pg/ μL). These standards are to be run with each batch of samples prepared to develop the calibration curve used in quantitative analysis.\nFor the ISM, aliquot the equivalent volume of 1 μg of each IS (14 total) listed in the reagent table below into a 10 mL volumetric flask, using a calibrated syringe, and dry down under nitrogen. Reconstitute the ISM in 10 mL of ACN and divide into 1 mL aliquots. The final concentration of the ISM should be 100 pg/μL. There is enough ISM to process 1000 samples.\nStore the SM and ISM at -80°C.\n2. Collection of Media and Cell Lysate",
    "For each 10 cm plate of adherent cells (~ 1 X 107), collect 3 mL of media in a 10 mL glass centrifuge tube. Next, wash the cells 2 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Add 1 mL of PBS to the plate and scrape the cells off the plate and pipet into a second 10 mL glass centrifuge tube. At this point cells and media may be stored if the procedure will not be continued at this time. Store samples at -80°C for long term storage or at -20°C for less than one week.\n3. Extraction of Lipids from Media\nFree bioactive lipids are found in the cell media and these are easily extracted with a one-step l-l extraction procedure. To the collected media (2.1), add 10 μL of ISM. At this time, 8 additional 10 mL glass centrifuge tubes should be labeled #0-7 for the calibration standards. Add 3 mL of PBS to each of these tubes and then add 10 μL of the appropriate SM to tubes 1-7 (1-7 from 1.1).\nAllow the ISM to equilibrate in each calibration standard and sample for 10 minutes and then add 5 mL of diethyl ether. The samples and calibration standards are then placed in the shaker on low speed for 30 minutes at room temperature.\nAfter shaking, all calibration standards and samples are centrifuged at 1935 x g for 10 minutes. Next, using a Pasteur pipet, transfer the upper phase (organic) into a new 10 mL glass centrifuge tube and dry under nitrogen.\n4. Extraction of Lipids from Cell Lysate",
    "Spin down the cell samples in the glass centrifuge tubes at 1935 X g for 5 minutes. Dispose of the supernatant; add 2 mL of PBS to each tube, and vortex briefly. Remove 25 μL of sample for protein quantification. Total protein will be used for cell lysate normalization.\nNext, transfer half of the lysate/PBS mixture into a separate 10 mL glass centrifuge tube. Add an additional 2 mL of PBS along with 10 μL of ISM to each sample. Follow the l-l extraction process described for media in 3.2 and 3.3. This aliquot will be used to measure free lipids in the cells and avoid alkaline degradation of lipids, such as the prostaglandins. This aliquot will not undergo steps 4.3 and 4.4 described below.\nThe first step of the esterified lipid l-l extraction process requires the addition of 5 mL of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1) to each of the samples. Samples are set in a shaker on low speed for 30 minutes. After shaking, the samples are centrifuged at 1935 x g for 10 minutes. Next, using a Pasteur pipet, transfer the bottom (organic) layer of the l-l extraction into a new 10 mL glass centrifuge tube and dry the sample under nitrogen.\nEsterified lipids must be saponified before quantification. Once the samples are dry, add 0.5 mL of 0.4N KOH in 80% MeOH to each tube. The samples are then incubated at 60°C for 1 h. After the incubation, add 2 mL of PBS. Adjust the pH to 6 with concentrated HCl acid (~30 μL). Add 10 μL of ISM to each sample. The rest of the procedure is the same as lipid extraction from media and can be followed in 3.2 and 3.3.",
    "If these extractions are run simultaneously with the media samples the same calibration standards can be used to develop a calibration curve; however, if these samples are run at another time, calibration standards must also be processed as described in 3.1-3.3.\n5. Pentafluorylbenzylbromide (PFB) Derivatization\nTo the dried down samples and calibration standards, add 100 μL of anhydrous dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) followed by 100 μL of 20% (v/v) N,N-diisopropylethylamine in anhydrous CH2Cl2, and finally 100 μL of 20% (v/v) PFB in anhydrous CH2Cl2.\nAfter the addition of derivatization reagents, the samples are vortexed, incubated at 60°C for 1 h and dried under nitrogen. The samples and calibration standards may be stored at -80°C if they are not analyzed immediately or at -20°C for up to one week.\n6. Stable Isotope Dilution Chiral Liquid Chromatography Electron Capture Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SID-LC-ECAPCI-MS) Analysis\nThe dried down samples and calibration standards are reconstituted in 100 μL of hexane/ethanol (97:3). The entire sample can then be transferred to the HPLC vial with insert. Place the samples in the chilled autosampler (4°C) and create a sample list for analysis.\nNext, set up the HPLC and MS methods using the parameters described in Table 1 and Table 2 below. Table 3 contains specific compound information, including the MRM transition and collision energy (CE) for each lipid as well as the estimated retention time from the Waters 2695/Thermo Fisher TSQ Quantum Ultra analysis. The CE is determined by tuning each individual lipid during method development.",
    "A Chiralpak AD-H column (4.6 X 250 mm, 5 μ) heated to 30°C is used for the normal phase separation. The starting mobile phase is 98% hexane and 2% methanol/isopropanol (1:1). After the HPLC separation, methanol is added post-column (0.75 mL/min) to avoid deposition on the Corona needle that would cause a decrease in sensitivity. The MS is set in negative ion mode using the APCI source. If the source needs to be changed from ESI to APCI, be sure to insert a Corona needle.\nThe first sample that should be run is always a hexane blank. This will equilibrate the column and also reveal if there is any contamination on the column that may interfere with the calibration standard and sample analysis.\nThe next samples run should be the calibration standard samples in order of 0-7 (increasing SM concentration). These standards will be used to create a calibration curve containing the ratio of standard area/IS area on the y-axis and standard concentration or mass on the x-axis. From the y = mx + b equation derived from this plot, the ratio of sample area/IS area (y) can be used to determine sample (unknown) amount or concentration (x).\nThe amount of bioactive lipids found in the media can be normalized to the total volume of media and the amount of lipids found in the cell lysate can be normalized to either total number of cells/plate or the amount of total protein/plate. Measures should be taken during 4.1 of the protocol to ensure that cells are counted or that protein is quantified.\n7. Representative Results:",
    "The chromatograms in Figure 1 are representative of a targeted lipidomics profile. The first panel (Figure 1A) shows 13- and 9-HODE along with the corresponding 13- and 9-oxoODE, derived from linoleic acid. In addition, 15-oxoETE, the oxidized metabolite of 15-HETE is also shown in the second panel. The bottom two panels show 20-HETE and the 20-HETE-IS, [2H6]-20-HETE. Figure 1B shows the separation and unique transitions determined for the HETE stereoisomers that result from enzymatic oxidation of AA or by ROS. Figure 1C is a representation of PGs, isoPs, and LTB4. Some of the standards do not have a deuterated IS commercially available; therefore, an IS that is similar in retention time is used for quantification. For instance, [2H8]-12(S)-HETE is used to quantify 11-HETE and 8-HETE species in addition to 12(R)-HETE and 12(S)-HETE.\nFrom the representative chromatograms, it is evident that there is a small shift in the retention of the deuterated IS compared to the unlabeled standard. This shift to a later retention time is a result of the deuterium interaction with the normal phase column. Deuterium is more polar than hydrogen; therefore, there is a stronger interaction with the normal phase of the column. If this separation were taking place using a reversed phase column, the shift would be to an earlier retention time as a more polar moiety would have a weaker interaction with the reversed phase.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3399/3399fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. This figure is a representative example of a targeted lipidomics analysis.  Figure 1A shows the total ion chromatograms (TIC) for several LA and AA oxidized metabolites including 13-oxoODE and 9-oxoODE in the first panel, 15-oxoETE in the second panel, 13-HODE and 9-HODE (panels 3 & 5) and 20-HETE (panel 7).  The HODEs and 20-HETE have a corresponding deuterated IS in the panel below (4, 6, & 8). The TICs in Figure 2B show the separation and unique transitions of the HETE stereoisomers derived from AA.  Figure 2C is a representation of PGs, isoPs, and LTs.
