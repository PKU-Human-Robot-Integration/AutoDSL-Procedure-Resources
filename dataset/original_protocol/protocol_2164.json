For each reaction time point, a 20-μI aliquot is withdrawn from the reaction mixture and immediately quenched with equal volume of 2 × stop solution.

    "In this section, we set up a method for resolving RNA species by denaturing PAGE.\nIncubate the quenched samples at 95°C for 45 s.\nNote: If the quenched samples were stored at −20°C, thaw the samples on ice prior to 95°C incubation.\nCool the samples on ice.\nNote: A DNA completely complementary to the RNA template T33-1 at a molar ratio of 3:1 was added to the 20 μI quenched sample to help resolve the RNA product well. The mixture was heated at 95°C for 45 s and slowly cooled to r.t. (25°C for about 30 min) to facilitate the annealing of T33-1 template RNA and the complementary DNA.\nResolve the RNA products through 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel electrophoresis under constant voltage (200 V) at 25°C with 0.5 × TBE buffer in the upper chamber and 1 × TBE buffer in the lower chamber for about 120 min until bromophenol blue just migrates out of the vertical gel.\nCritical: It is strongly recommend to prerun the gel for about 30 min until the electric current was steady, and then rinse the wells with 0.5 × TBE thoroughly just before sample loading.\nRinse the gel twice with H2O.\nStain the gel with Stains-All solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min using a horizontal rotator.\nRinse the gel twice with H2O. Destain the gel in H2O for 15 min using a horizontal rotator.\nScan the gel using a scanner (Epson Perfection V850 Pro) under the following settings for preview.
