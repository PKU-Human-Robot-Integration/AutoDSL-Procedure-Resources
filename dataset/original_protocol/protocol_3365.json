    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of single-cycle vesicular stomatitis viruses (scVSVs)\nTiming: 6 days\nIn many cases, scVSVs allow to study Envs of pathogenic viruses, which require BSL-3 and BSL-4 environments, under BSL-2 practices. As an example, we describe the preparation of scVSVs that display the HIV-1AD8 Env and SARS-CoV-2 spike. The HIV Envs and SARS-CoV-2 spike have been the subject of intensive research investigations (Bar et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Flemming et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Harris et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Herschhorn et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Hoffmann et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; McLellan et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Pancera et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Parrish et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Riva et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Wrapp et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nDay 1: Detach BHK-21/WI-2 cells using StemPro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent and count viable cells using trypan blue exclusion dye.\nAdd 5 × 105 cells in 2 mL of DMEM medium to each well of 6-well plate and incubate the cells for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration in a tissue culture incubator.\nDay 2: One hour before transfection, change the medium of each well and add 2 mL of medium without FBS and antibiotic\nCritical: This time schedule ensures pH equilibration.\nTransfect the cells with 0.4 μg of Env-expressing plasmid (e.g., pCAGGS-2S-del18, or pCDNA-AD8-M-GCT) using Effectene according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/functional-and-cell-analysis/transfection/effectene-transfection-reagent/#orderinginformation[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/functional-and-cell-analysis/transfection/effectene-transfection-reagent/#orderinginformation]).\nAlternatives: Calcium phosphate transfection can be used instead of Effectene [The calcium phosphate transfection mix is prepared by mixing 2× HEPES Buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 12 mM Glucose, 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4; pH 7.2), 2 M CaCl2, and DNA as described in Ratnapriya et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]]. In our experience, Effectene was more efficient than calcium phosphate for transfection of BHK-21/WI-2 cells.",
    "Critical: We recommend incubating the transfected cells for two days before following the next step. There is no need to change the media as Effectene does not show any significant cytotoxic effects to BHK-21/WI-2 cells during incubation.\nDay 4: Infection the transfected cells with scVSV-G (ΔG-luciferase). Remove the media from attached transfected cells and wash 3 times with PBS to remove dead cells. The transfected cells are typically ∼90% confluent at the time of virus inoculation.\nAdd 500 μL medium without FBS to each well.\nAdd scVSV-G (ΔG-luciferase (G∗ΔG-luciferase) rVSV) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 to each well. The scVSV-G viruses display the VSV-G protein on their surface but carry VSV genome in which the vsv-g gene was deleted. Thus, new progeny scVSVs that are produced in the BHK-21/WI-2 cells will contain the deleted genome and display the heterogenous Env that is expressed from a separate Env-expressing plasmid.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h with a frequent gentle shake every 15 min.\nRemove the free scVSV-G (ΔG-luciferase (G∗ΔG-luciferase) rVSV) virus from the cells and wash once with PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of medium without FBS containing 1/1000 dilution of anti-VSV-G antibody (we usually use clone 8G5F11 from Millipore; catalog number MABF2337-100UG). The addition of antibody ensures that potential traces of VSV-G on the progeny scVSVs are not able to mediate viral entry.\nIncubate the infected cells for 24 h in the tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration. At this step infected cells will produce scVSVs displaying the Env that was transfected on day 2 (step 4). Transfer the scVSV-containing supernatant to a tube and centrifuge at 500 × g; collect the virus and store in aliquots at −80°C.",
    "Note: For days 5–6, titer the scVSVs on target cells based on their reporter gene. Target cells should express the receptor for the specific Envs that are displayed on the scVSVs. We typically use 293T-ACE2 and Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 cells for SARS-CoV-2 spike and HIV-1 Env scVSVs, respectively. VSV has a short life cycle and reporter protein expression can be measured between 6- and 24-h post infection.\nNote: It is recommended to test different time points to detect the kinetics and saturation of the assay.\nDay 5: Seed 2 × 104 cells/well target cells in 96-well white luminometer plate.\nDay 6: Serially dilute the scVSVs 10-fold in DMEM ranging from 10−1 to 10−8.\nAspirate the media of each well in the 96-well plate and add 100 μL of the diluted scVSVs to the wells in triplicate. Include a cell control group with no virus to calculate the background level in the luciferase assay. Incubate the infected cells in the tissue culture incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 concentration for 6 h.\nAspirate the media completely and add 31 μL of lysis buffer to each well.\nIncubate the plate for 20 min at 20°C–25°C and measure the firefly luciferase activity using a luminometer as described in Ratnapriya et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21].\nNote: We also prepare scVSVs that express GFP upon infection by using the same protocol but with scVSV.gfp (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Luciferase activity can be also detected in the supernatant of infected cells but the readout from lysed cells is usually higher than the readout from the supernatant.\nPreparation of plasmids for the rescue of replication-competent vesicular stomatitis viruses (rcVSVs)\nTiming: 4 days",
    "The production of rcVSVs is based on the pVSV eGFP dG plasmid (available from Addgene), which contains the complete VSV genome with a deletion of the vsv-g gene and a convenient multiple cloning site between the matrix (M) and polymerase (L) genes that includes the MluI and NotI restriction sites. A heterologous env gene can be introduced by standard cloning procedures or by Gibson assembly. Primers for Gibson assembly typically contain 20–25 bp overlapping end sequences that match the plasmid sequences at the point of assembly. To generate rcVSVs, the resulting plasmid, which contains the VSV genome and heterologous env, is co-transfected with an additional 5 plasmids encoding for viral proteins and the T7 RNA polymerase (Lawson et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Langlois et al. 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). rcVSVs are rescued from the transfected cells and can be used for a variety of applications (Bresk et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Case et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Liberatore et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nDay 1: Design the primers for Gibson assembly (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). These can be done by using online tools such as NEBuilder Assembly Tool or manually using any DNA editor program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_313_1.csv\naUnderlying sequences are homologous to sequences in the target plasmid used for Gibson assembly.\nDay 2 (day in which primers are available): Amplify the gene of interest by PCR using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase to reduce potential errors. We typically design primers with a melting temperature (Tm) of 60°C and use PfuUltra II Fusion High-fidelity DNA Polymerase (Agilent) according to the manufacturer`s instructions (https://[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/polymerase-chain-reaction-(pcr)/pcr-enzymes-reagents/high-fidelity-gc-rich-target-dna-polymerases-for-pcr/pfuultra-ii-fusion-high-fidelity-dna-polymerase-785916]www.agilent.com/en/product/polymerase-chain-reaction-(pcr[href=http://www.agilent.com/en/product/polymerase-chain-reaction-(pcr])/pcr-enzymes-reagents/high-fidelity-gc-rich-target-dna-polymerases-for-pcr/pfuultra-ii-fusion-high-fidelity-dna-polymerase-785916).",
    "Separate the PCR products on 0.8%–1.2% agarose gel and extract the DNA with the correct size using a commercial gel-extraction kit (e.g., Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System from Promega). This step is not necessary for Gibson assembly, but it allows to verify the correct size of the amplified DNA and, according to our experience, can increase the efficiency of the reaction.\nSet up the Gibson assembly reaction according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.neb.com/products/e2621-nebuilder-hifi-dna-assembly-master-mix#Product%20Information[href=https://www.neb.com/products/e2621-nebuilder-hifi-dna-assembly-master-mix#Product%20Information]). Incubate the reaction mixture at 50°C for 15 min, transform the reaction products into bacteria, and incubate 16–20 h at 30°C on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/mL of carbenicillin.\nDays 3–4: Select 2–3 well-isolated and round colonies, inoculate in 2 mL of LB broth containing 50 μg/mL of ampicillin and grow the bacteria 16–20 h at 30°C in a shaker incubator.\nThe next day extract the plasmids using commercial minipreps (e.g., Macherey-Nagel). Analyze the plasmids by restriction enzymes to verify the present of the env gene and sequence the gene. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows the resulting plasmid map after cloning.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/313-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. pVSV eGFP dG AD8-M plasmid map\nThe HIV-1AD8 env gene was introduced between VSV m and l genes in the original pVSV eGFP dG plasmid (available from Addgene). A similar plasmid was constructed by replacing the AD8-M gene with the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene to generate pVSV eGFP dG 2S-Del18.\nProduction of replication-competent vesicular stomatitis viruses (rcVSVs)\nTiming: 15 days\nDay 1: Seed 4 × 105 BHK-21/WI-2 cells in a 6-well plate.\nDay 2: Change the media (2 mL) 1 h before the transfection. Do not include fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics in the media.",
    "Prepare the VSV and supporting plasmids at the ratio specified below and transfect the cells using Effectene. To increase DNA transfection without cytotoxicity of reagents, we typically use a total of 0.85 μg DNA, 3.2 μL enhancer, and 10 μL Effectene.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_313_2.csv\napVSV eGFP dG-env, pVSV eGFP dG-AD8-M-GCT, or pVSV eGFP dG-2S-del18 plasmids.\nCritical: The transfected cells are transferred into a BSL2+ facility.\nIncubate the transfected cells for 4 days.\nCollect the supernatant and freeze-thaw cells 3 times to release all viruses from the cells. Freeze the combined fractions at −80°C freezer in aliquots.\nNote: Usually after 2–3 days, cells become rounded and detached due to virus replication and G protein expression in the cells. Cell syncytia can be also detected (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCritical: The transfected cells are transferred into a BSL2+ facility.\nIncubate the transfected cells for 4 days.\nCollect the supernatant and freeze-thaw cells 3 times to release all viruses from the cells.

Some infected cells form syncytia 24 h post inoculation. Both rounded cells and cell syncytia of infected cells can be detected.\n(C) Uninfected BHK-21/WI-2 control cells. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nDay 5: Seed 4 × 105 BHK-21/WI-2 cells in a 6-well plate.",
    "Day 6: Transfect the BHK-21/WI-2 cells with pCAGGS-G (0.4 μg/well) using Effectene according the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/functional-and-cell-analysis/transfection/effectene-transfection-reagent/#orderinginformation[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/functional-and-cell-analysis/transfection/effectene-transfection-reagent/#orderinginformation]). Cells that express the VSV-G from a separate plasmid support more efficient amplification of the rescued rcVSV in the subsequent step.\nDay 7: Add the collected rescue viruses to the transfected cells and incubate for 3 days.\nCritical: Add all rescued viruses from step 27 to the cells. Do not discard the viruses after 1-h adsorption. Instead, add 1 mL of media to the existing media and incubate for a total of 3 days. At this step, no obvious cytopathic effects (CPE) are typically observed. It is not recommended to incubate the cells longer than 72 h as this will lead to a decrease in viral titer.\nDay 9: Seed 4 × 105 target cells which express the receptor for the recombinant rcVSVs in a 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 12–16 h. For HIV-1 Env and SARS-CoV-2 Spike displaying viruses, we use Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 and 293T-ACE2 cells, respectively.\nDay 10: Collect the virus from step 30 by centrifugation of the supernatants at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nSerially dilute the collected viruses and add them to the 6-well plate containing the target cells that were prepared in step 31. Incubate for 2 h at 37°C to allow virus entry. Gently shake the plate every 15 min to evenly distribute the virus.\nDuring incubation, prepare 2% low melting agarose by heating in a microwave for 30–45 s. Keep at 42°C in a water bath. We typically use SeaPlaque Agarose for cell culture experiments.\nDiscard the media after the 2-h incubation (step 33) and wash the cells 3 times with PBS.",
    "Add equal volume of 2% low melting agarose, which was prepared in step 34, to 2× DMEM media and add 2 mL of the mixture to each well.\nIncubate for 10–20 min at 20°C–25°C to allow agarose solidification and incubate the infected cells at 37°C for 2 days.\nDay 12: Seed ∼3 × 105 target cells/well in a 6-well plate. Target cells for HIV-1 env and Spike protein-expressing rcVSVs are Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 and 293T-ACE2 cells, respectively.\nDays 13–15: Collect the well-isolated plaques in the lowest dilutions by puncturing the agarose using a blue pipet tip. Transfer the plaque to 200 μL of DMEM and freeze and thaw the viruses 3 times by placing the tube on dry ice-methanol and then transferring the tube to a 37°C water bath. Each step of freeze and thaw should take at least 5 min. Add viruses to the target cells of each well of the 6-well plate (from step 38). Incubate the infected cells for 2–3 days at 37°C and monitor CPE.\nViral passage\nTiming: 4 days\nPassage the viruses in the target cells for at least 3 times to increase the virus titer. Amplification efficiency can differ among Envs. For example, rcVSV-AD8-M titer significantly increased after 3 passages but rcVSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike, required 9 passages to reach a reasonable titer.\nDay 1: Seed 1 × 106 target cells expressing the receptor in T25 tissue culture flask.\nDays 2–4: Add collected rcVSVs from step 39 to the T25 flask and incubate for 1 h at 37°C. Remove the virus and wash once with PBS.\nAdd 3 mL of media to each T25 flask supplemented by penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics. Incubate for no more than 72 h and monitor daily for the presence of CPE. Collect the rcVSVs when approximately 70% of the cells exhibit CPE.",
    "Assays to verify recombinant rcVSVs growth\nAfter final passage and before proceeding to further experiments, it is necessary to verify that the VSV genome contains the heterologous env gene by reverse transcription-PCR (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) and sequencing. The level of Env expression in target cells can be also analyzed by western blot or immunofluorescence assays.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/313-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Assay to detect rcVSVs\nRT-PCR analysis of rcVSV-AD8M replication. Lane 1, DNA ladder; lane 2, rcVSV-AD8-M.\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nTiming: 1 day\nViral RNA is extracted from supernatant of infected cells or directly from infected cells by a commercial kit according to the manufacturer`s instruction. We typically use the NucleoSpin RNA Virus Kit (Macherey-Nagel; https://www.mn-net.com/us/nucleospin-rna-virus-mini-kit-for-viral-rna-from-cell-free-fluids-740956.50[href=https://www.mn-net.com/us/nucleospin-rna-virus-mini-kit-for-viral-rna-from-cell-free-fluids-740956.50]) but many other kits are available from commercial vendors. The isolated viral RNA is used as a template for RT-PCR. Either specific primers or random hexamer can be used for the cDNA synthesis of the viral RNA by a reverse transcriptase.\nSet up the following RT reaction by adding the materials in the order they are listed:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_313_3.csv\nNote: In our experience random hexamer worked better than specific primers for the RT-PCR reaction.\nHeat mixture to 65°C for 5 min and quickly place on ice. Collect the contents of the tube by brief centrifugation and add:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_313_4.csv\nincubate at 25°C for 12 min, add 1 μL (200 units) of SuperScript II RT and incubate at 42°C for 50 min. Inactivate the reaction by incubating at 70°C for 15 min.\nPCR protocol for rcVSVs amplification\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_313_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_313_6.csv\naElongation time depends on the DNA polymerase and insert length.\nNotes:\nPCR product can be directly sequenced, or it can be cloned into a plasmid and then single clones can be sequenced.\nApplication of rVSVs displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike\nTiming: 3–4 days",
    "As an example, for an application of rVSV, we describe the use of scVSV-2S-del18.luc for testing virus neutralization by serum of a mouse immunized with the soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike.\nDay 1: Blood is collected from a BALB/c mouse that was subcutaneously immunized three times (with a two weeks interval between immunizations), each with 25 μg of soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 50 μL PBS (ectodomain, described in Wrapp et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]) or from a BALB/c mouse immunized with PBS (naïve mouse). We mixed 50 μL of SARS-CoV-2 spike or PBS with 50 μL of AddaVax adjuvant (InvivoGen; cat# vac-adx-10) for all immunizations and all procedures are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Minnesota.\nThe serum is collected before each immunization and 2 or 3 weeks after the last immunization. The serum is separated from blood components by allowing the blood to clot for 30 min at 20°C–25°C and centrifugation at 1,000–2,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Transfer the top, clear fraction to a 1.5 mL tube.\nTiter the scVSV-2S-del18.luc as described in steps 13–16 and determine a working dilution that results in a readout in the linear range of the titration curve.\nSeed 2 × 104 cells/well of 293T-ACE2 target cells in 96-well white luminometer plate.\nDay 2: Make serial dilutions of the serum (e.g., 1:40, 1:200, 1:1,000, 1:5,000) in DMEM. Mix the diluted serum with equal volume of the scVSV-2S-del18.luc and incubated at 37°C for 1 h.\nAdd 100 μL of the serum-virus mixture to the 293T-ACE2 target cells, incubate the plate at 37°C for 6–20 h, and measure the luciferase activity as described in Ratnapriya et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/313-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Experimental procedures are described in the section Application of rVSVs displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Data are normalized to scVSV-2S-del18.luc control and are shown as mean ± SD of the readout from triplicate wells.
