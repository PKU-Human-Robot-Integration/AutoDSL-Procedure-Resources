  "procedures": [
    "1. Nematode Growth and Handling\nGrow C. elegans on standard Petri plates containing NGM spotted with OP50-1 Escherichia coli as food source1-3.\nKeep cultures in an incubator that maintains the desired temperature. C. elegans grows well from 15 to 25 °C, with 20 °C being the standard growth temperature.\n\tNOTE: Swimming is a robust phenotype, however swim vigor can be affected by environmental factors including contamination on plates and overheating of cultures and slides. Strong efforts to maintain stable conditions should be made.\nUse a homemade nematode pick made of a platinum wire flame-sealed into a glass rod to handle transfer of single animals4.\n2. Set up for Swim Analysis\nUse an integrated system consisting of a stereomicroscope, digital CCD camera, and digital video recording software. The CeleST software can be used on a separate computer.\n\t\nCover the microscope with a dark cloth (e.g., felt) to prevent glare in the swim drop area on the microscope slide and improve image quality.\nAdjust the microscope's working distance and magnification to full view of the swim area, and the base mirror to get sharp contrast of the animals against the background. Set the illumination to dark-field to visualize the bodies of the adults as white against the black background, which works very well for computational visualization and tracking with the swim analysis software.\nTake care to keep the work area, microscope slide, and swim drop very clean. Debris can interfere with the analysis by occluding the free swimming of adults, and thin threads of fiber can be detected as nonmoving animals during tracking.\n3. Animal Preparation for Analysis of Physical Fitness in Liquid",
    "Pipette 60 µL of 1x M9 buffer into a 10 mm ring preprinted on a microscope slide. Make sure the drop entirely covers the inside area of the ring. The software extracts more swimming information using this drop size contained on a slide than it would if utilizing multiwell plates.\nPick single adult nematodes and transfer them into the drop of 1x M9 buffer, minimizing the transport of bacteria that can cloud the liquid. Minimize bacteria by first placing the animals for transfer to a side of the plate that does not contain much bacterial lawn, letting them crawl, and then gently lifting them up.\n\t\nWhen transferring the nematodes into the drop, use a dissecting scope close to the analysis station to reduce the length of swim time, which can affect the behavior of the animals25.\nPlace only 4 adults in the drop if they move vigorously and cross paths often. As guidance to minimize overlapping swimmers (which confounds computational analysis), consider placing 4 animals per drop when they are as active as young, healthy WT adults and 5 animals per drop when they are older and show less vigor.\n\t\tNOTE: Healthy WT nematodes instinctively start swimming soon after being placed in liquid. With the aid of a nematode pick, gently separate the adults in the drop if they clump.\n4. Analysis of Physical Fitness in Liquid — Video Recording of Swimming",
    "Position the slide loaded with adults on the base of the microscope to record their swimming. 30 s videos capture details of an individual animal's behavior in liquid (Video 1), and sampling of large numbers of such records is easily accomplished when aided by CeleST software8,26; however, longer swim periods may be ideal for other specific behavioral studies25. Importantly, make sure to maintain the same magnification throughout all recordings since magnification differences affect swimming analysis and will bias comparison.\n\tNOTE: These steps are provided as guidance using the digital video recording software listed in the Table of Materials; VirtualDub open access software might substitute, although we have not tested this.\n\t\nUse the following settings as guidance for successful swim analysis: image size of 696 x 520 pixels, image resolution of 0.02 mm/pixel, and a rate of 18 frames/s. Higher resolution versions of these settings may facilitate tracking but will not affect the measures calculated by the program.\n\t\tNOTE: The swim zone provided by the 60 µL drop of 1x M9 buffer on the microscope slide does not have much depth, which minimizes upward and downward swimming motion.\nUnder Settings, go to 'Recording', set 'Limit Sequence Size' to '545 frames on disk'. Under the same heading, check the 'Use Recording Manager' box. Click the 'Edit current recording script...' button, and under 'Commands', select 'Grab Frame', and under 'Stop Conditions', enter 'Stop after 0:00:30.00'.\nTo record, select 'New Sequence in RAM' under the home heading, then press the red 'Record' button. The software will grab 545 frames over 30 s with the digital camera and hold them in RAM memory.\n5. Analysis of Physical Fitness in Liquid — Video Treatment",
    "Fragment the video into a sequence of image frames by clicking the home heading and selecting 'Export full sequence to…' in the video recording software.\n\tNOTE: The digital video recording software can save the frames as .bmp, .jpg, .tif, or .png, all of which can be read by the swim analysis program presented here. Note that .tif files use more storage space, but some formats such as .jpg may degrade image quality.\nLaunch the swim analysis program from MATLAB by clicking the run button.\nOn the home screen of the swim analysis program, use the 'Add one video' or 'Add multiple videos' buttons to upload sequences of image frames one at a time or in groups while attaching relevant labels such as genotype, date, trial and duration. The software creates a database of the labeled sequences.\nEnable simultaneous tracking of multiple animals in the uploaded sequences by clicking '1. Process videos'. In the new screen, select the desired videos in the left box and click, 'Add to the list'. For each video, click its name in the top right list to display the first image of the video in the bottom right. Demarcate the swim zone by selecting 3 points inside the ring, and initiate processing by clicking 'Process all the videos listed above'. View progress of the processing at the center bottom.\nOnce completed, 'Close' the video processing screen.\n6. Analysis of Physical Fitness in Liquid — Measurement\nClick on '2. Compute measures' to open a new screen where the processed videos can be uploaded, one at a time, to validate or reject the tracking of single animals. Videos that have been processed will appear in the list on the left where the video name can be clicked to upload that video.",
    "Use this manual step to focus on areas of missed tracking (red blocks) in contrast to successful tracking (green blocks).\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, one can rely on the automated output of valid tracking since the software has a robust tracking system (94.1% validity as observed in 2,020 animals from 404 videos8).\n\t\nFind the 'Validity of the segmented body' in the first color bar across the screen in the bottom half. The percentage of 'Valid frames' is in green, and the percentage of 'Rejected frames' is in red. ≥80% of valid frames imply that the tracking information used to compute measures comes from at least 432 frames out of 540 in a 30 s swim trial recorded at 18 frames/s.\nEasily navigate and modify blocks of valid/rejected frames utilizing the 'Next block', 'Switch validity', 'Split block', and 'Isolate frame' options. In the rare event that 2 animals crossed paths in an uncrowded swim zone, switch their identification numbers over a specific frame range with the 'Switch' button.\nView the bar graphs in the bottom half of the screen for additional information on tracking and overlapping performances. The length of the segmented body (animal's body length per frame) correlates with overlapping incidences.\nIf any bright spots on the video interfere with the analysis, adjust bright areas in the swim zone by selecting the 'Glare zones' function.\nClick on 'Save and Compute measures' to save the validity input before uploading another processed video. At this stage the software computes, in the background (not shown to the user), curvature maps of the swim performance of individual animals and the parameters indicated below (Video 2).",
    "NOTE: The parameters measured that are focused on here are described in Table 1. The Wave initiation rate, body wave number, asymmetry, stretch, and curling are calculated based on the curvature maps that the software computes for the animals; the Travel speed, Brush stroke, and Activity index parameters are not based on curvature maps.\nClick 'Close' to exit the 'Compute measures' screen.\n7. Analysis of Physical Fitness in Liquid — Output of Results\nNote: The software can report on multiple measures of the swim motion, which cover from overt to very subtle behavioral traits not readily scored by eye (Videos 3 and 4). Here the focus is on 8 parameters that typically show a good dynamic range: Wave initiation rate, Body wave number, Asymmetry, Stretch, Curling, Travel speed, Brush stroke, and Activity index.\nOn the home screen of the program, click on '3. Display results' to obtain the analysis output.\nCreate sample groups for statistical treatment by selecting the desired analyzed sequences of frames in the left box and moving them into a new or existing sample group by clicking the 'Add to the selected sample' or 'Add to new Sample' buttons.\nClick 'Show graphs for these samples' to go to a second screen that displays the graphs and key statistics of the samples for each of the 8 parameters by selection on the top of the screen.\n\t\nIf desired, adjust the representation of the bar graphs at the top left of the screen using the 'Colors', '# of histograms', and '# of worms' selectors.\nUse '2D histograms' to plot combinations of any two parameters via the 'Measure on the X axis' and 'Measure on the Y axis' drop down menus on the left of the screen. Click 'Close' to exit and return to the 'Display results' screen.",
    "Use the 'Export…' button on the top left of the screen to save detailed numerical data as .csv file to open and further manipulate in a spreadsheet program.\n'Close' the 'Display results' screen to go back to the home screen and click 'Quit' to ensure saving of the database containing the analyzed video sequences."
