    "This protocol is based on structural features on the skull surface (bregma and lambda) as reference points for determining the target position (Figure 5). Bregma and lambda are defined as the intersections of the sagittal suture with the coronal and lambdoid sutures, respectively. A mouse brain atlas (e.g., Paxinos and Franklin, 2001) allows the determination of the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and dorsal-ventral coordinates of the brain structures from measurement of these skull features.Anesthetize mouseAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection (20 µl/g of body weight) of a mixture of ketamine (7 mg/ml) and xylazine (0.44 mg/ml) dissolved in bacteriostatic saline. The animal should reach surgical anesthesia within 5-10 min. Shave the fur of the top of the skull after the mouse has reached full anesthesia.Note: Depth of anesthesia is assessed by the corneal blink and tail-pinch reflexes. Wait until the reflexes are disappeared, if the mouse is not well anesthetized. Anesthesia should persist for approximately 1 h.Mount mouse to a stereotaxic frame (Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Procedure of setting mouse to a stereotaxic frame. This video describes how to mount a mouse to a stereotaxic frame. The videoclip begins with insertion the auxiliary ear bar into the external auditory meatus.Before mounting the mouse to the stereotaxic frame, insert the auxiliary ear bar. Guide the tips of the auxiliary ear bar into the external auditory meatus and tighten the screw.Note: Small popping sounds are heard when the tips are properly inserted to the tympanic membranes. Make sure that the auxiliary ear bar and the midline of the mouse are vertically placed.Insert the ear bars of the stereotaxic frame into the auxiliary ear bar. Lock the ear bars tightly. When done correctly, the animal’s head should be centered by symmetrical adjustment of the ear bars.",
    "Slide the incisor bar into the mouth and place incisors into the hole. Apply downward pressure to the nose while sliding the incisor bar back until it stops. Tighten the nose clamp and incisor bar firmly (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170614/20170614021358_5249.jpgFigure 4. A mouse mounted in the stereotaxic frameSurgery (Video2)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Stereotaxic surgery. The video shows steps for the surgery. Note: To maintain body temperature, it is recommended to place the mouse on a heating pad (38 °C) during surgery. Disinfect the scalp with 70% ethanol and make an incision along the midline with a scalpel. Expose the skull and scrape away the pericranial tissues with a cotton swab.Fit the stereotaxic micromanipulator to the stereotaxic frame and attach the electrode.Perform dorsoventral measurements at bregma and lambda by lowering the tip of the electrode until it just touches the skull. Then, adjust the incisor bar to bring both bregma and lambda lines at the same horizontal level (Figure 5).Note: At this point, make sure that both of the bregma and the lambda are on the midline. If these are not on the midline, it is necessary to remount the mouse on the stereotaxic frame.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170614/20170614021534_0869.jpgFigure 5. Dorsal surface of the mouse skull. Bregma and lambda are defined as the points of intersections of the sagittal suture with the coronal and lambdoid sutures, respectively.Using a dissecting microscope, set zero at bregma. Set the electrode at the target coordinates: 0.2 mm caudal to bregma and 0.23 mm bilateral to the midline for an adult C57BL/6J mouse. Mark the targets with the pencil on the skull.Drill two small burr holes through the skull at the marked targets for the bilateral targets. Lower the electrode into the hole 5.9 mm below the skull surface for an adult C57BL/6J mouse.",
    "If bleeding is observed after drilling, stop bleeding by applying pressure to the whole by a cotton swab.Note: The correct target coordinates will vary depending on the age or strain of the mouse. Pilot surgeries may be necessary to refine the target coordinates.Setting lesion making deviceConnect the electrode to the binding post (+). Pinch the nose clamp with one of the clips of the plug connector cable and connect it to the binding post (-). Pinch the mouse tail with the other clip of the plug connector cables and connect to the binding post (G) (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170614/20170614021749_7299.jpgFigure 6. The connection of the lesion-making device to the mouseSCN-lesionDeliver an electric current of 0.8 mA for 3 sec using the lesion-making device. For the sham operation, use the same surgical procedure but do not deliver a current.Remove the electrode and suture the incision using surgical needle and thread (Video 3). Remove the mouse from the stereotaxic frame and auxiliary ear bars.Keep warm the mouse on a heating pad (38 °C) during recovery (approx. 30 min). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Suture of incision. This video provides a demonstration of suture of the incision in the end of surgery.Confirmation of SCN-lesionTo confirm arrhythmicity induced by the SCN-lesion, monitor the rhythm of free-moving activity in constant darkness using an area sensor with an infrared detector (Figure 7). The activity rhythm can be analyzed using ClockLab software. The SCN lesion can also be confirmed by Nissl staining of the SCN slices using cresyl violet solution (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170614/20170614021921_5274.jpgFigure 7. The schematic chart of the infrared detector setupimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170614/20170614021955_9967.jpgFigure 8. Confirmation of the SCN-lesion. Shown are the representative Nissl-stained coronal brain sections of a mouse 1 month after SCN-lesion (left panels) and the double-plotted actograms (right panels) of the SCN-lesioned mouse (upper panels) and sham-operated one (lower panels).",
    "In the Nissl-staining (left panels), the bilateral SCN is lost in the section of SCN-lesioned mouse (upper panel), while the SCN (arrows) in the section of sham-operated mouse is intact (lower panel). Electrolytic lesioning frequently results in formation of tissue debris (arrowhead). 3 V, third ventricle. OC, optic chiasm. Scale bar = 500 µm. When the activity is monitored under constant dark (DD) condition, the SCN-lesioned mouse shows arrhythmic locomotor behavior (upper panel), whilst the sham-operated mouse shows a normal circadian rhythm. Shaded areas on the actograms signify the dark period. (Data are cited from Shimizu et al., 2016)."
