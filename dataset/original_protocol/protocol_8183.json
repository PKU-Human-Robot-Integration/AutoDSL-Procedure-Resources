    "1. Preparation of snRNAs for Microinjection\nPrepare a DNA template containing the full-length or truncated/mutated version of snRNA by PCR using a following PCR setup: 98 °C for 60 s, 98 °C for 15 s, 68 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, 98 °C for 15 s for 35x, and 72 °C for 5 min.\nThe forward primer must contain a promoter sequence for in vitro transcription just upstream of the first transcribed nucleotide. Amplify U2 snRNA sequence using the forward primer containing the T7 promoter and the reverse primer, which ends with the last transcribed nucleotide (see Table of Materials for details).\nSynthesize snRNA using a kit for short RNA synthesis (see Table of Materials for details) containing T7 RNA polymerase. Add 1 mM ATP, 1 mM CTP, 1 mM GTP, 0.8 mM UTP, 0.2 mM UTP-Alexa488, 1.8 mM trimethylguanosine cap analogue (m32,2,7G(5’)ppp(5’)G), 1 μL of an RNA inhibitor and 500-700 ng of the DNA template to the reaction mixture and incubate at 37 ˚C overnight.\nAdd 1 µL (2U) of DNase into the reaction and incubate for additional 15 min at 37 ˚C.\nIsolate snRNA by acidic phenol/chloroform extraction. Remove the top water phase and add 1/10 of the original volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH = 5.2), 3 µL of glycogen for better pellet visualization and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. Incubate for 1 h at -80 ˚C, centrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 x g and 4 °C.\nWash the pellet with 70% ethanol and dissolve in 12 µL of nuclease-free water. The usual RNA yield was around 600 ng/μL. Store at -80 °C.\nMonitor the integrity of in vitro transcribed snRNAs by agarose gel electrophoreses.",
    "Before microinjection, dilute RNA to the final concentration 200 ng/μL in water containing 10 µg/µL dextran-TRITC 70 kDa.\n2. Cells\nBefore the use, treat the coverslips with 1 M HCl for 1 h, wash thoroughly in distilled water and store in 100% ethanol. Acidic treatment promotes cells adhesion to prevent cell peeling during or after injection. For easier identification of injected cells, use a coverslip with a grid.\nSeed HeLa or other adherent cells 1 day before microinjection on 12 mm coverslips (no. 1 or no. 1.5) to reach 50% confluency at the time of microinjection.\n3. Injection\nNOTE: HeLa cells were microinjected in the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM, 4.5 g/L D-glucose containing phenol red and antibiotics). Injection was carried out using an injector and a micromanipulator equipped with the sterile needle (see Table of Materials for details). The whole microscopic/micromanipulator system was pre-heated to 37 °C for at least 4 h to prevent fluctuation of individual parts of the microscope and the microinjector.\nPut the Petri dish (30 mm) containing 2 mL of culture media with the coverslip in the middle into the holder of the microscope. Load 3 µL of snRNA mixture into the needle using a microloader. Install the needle into the holder of the microinjector in 45° with respect to the surface of the Petri dish.\nTo find the needle, use a 10x long distance objective. First, set the speed COARSE on the injector and lower the needle until it touches the culture medium. Using the microscope binoculars, find the bright spot, which is the place where the needle touches the culture medium.",
    "Change the speed to FINE and further lower the needle while looking into the microscope until the tip of the needle is observed. Move the needle in the middle of visual field and switch to a 40x long distance objective.\nAfter changing the objective, select the cell and move the needle above this cell. Set the pressures and time for the cell contact (see Tips and troubleshooting in discussion).\nMove the needle down into the cell and then set the lower limit on the micromanipulator. Be careful not to move the needle below the cell.\nAfter setting the lower limit, move the needle back above the cell and press the injection button on the joystick of the injector. The needle moves automatically inside the cell to the place where the limit is set and injects the RNA mixture.\nTo finish, push the button MENU on the injector and remove the needle from the holder. Then disconnect the tube from the injector before switching off the injector and the micromanipulator.\n4. Cell Fixation and Staining\nAfter the microinjection, return the cells into a CO2 incubator and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nAfter the incubation, rinse the cells three times with phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) at room temperature, fix for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PIPES pH 6.9, and wash three times with room temperature PBS. If only snRNA localization is analyzed, briefly rinse the cells in water and mount in a mounting medium with DAPI.",
    "In case of additional protein localization, permeabilize the cells with 0.5% Triton-X100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After three rinses with PBS, incubate the cells with primary and secondary antibodies and after final washes in PBS and brief rinse in water, mount in a mounting medium with DAPI.\n5. Microscopy\nIf not imaged immediately after mounting, store the slides at 4 °C until imaging.\nAcquire images using a high-end fluorescence microscopic system equipped with an immersion objective (60X or 100x/1.4NA).\nOnce microinjected cells are identified, collect a stack of 20 z-sections with 200 nm z steps per sample and subject to mathematical deconvolution. Maximal projections or individual z stacks were then presented.\nTo quantify the fluorescent signal, draw Region of Interest (ROI) around a Cajal body identified by coilin immunostaining. Measure the intensity of the snRNA signal in the coilin-defined ROI. Next determine the intensity of snRNA fluorescence in ROI randomly placed in the nucleoplasm and calculate the ratio of RNA signal in the Cajal body and nucleoplasm.\nSubscription Required.
