This section also provides various methods to assure good quality of sgRNA prior to tranfection.\nIdentify your target genetic locus of interest (e.g., Fancm) in the mouse genome.\nWe design sgRNAs by identifying the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence ‘NGG’ (Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9), flanking the regions of Fancm to be deleted. We designed several mutants of Fancm including: Fancm Δ85/Δ frameshift mutants, Fancm MM1Δ/Δ, Fancm MM2Δ/Δ and Fancm DEAHΔ/Δ in-frame mutants (Panday et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nWe use online tools to design oligos compatible for in vitro transcription. https://cctop.cos.uni-heidelberg.de:8043/[href=https://cctop.cos.uni-heidelberg.de:8043/]\nCritical: Several other validated online portals could be used to design sgRNAs for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene deletion. For examples, https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public[href=https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public].\nBefore the oligos are ordered, we generate an oligo sequence using the tool mentioned below. This tool generates a sequence that contains the target gene sequence and also includes the T7 promoter sequence at the 5′ end and a 14-nt overlap sequence at the 3′ end. If there is no G at the 5′ end of the target gene sequence, the tool will add a G to the generated oligo. https://sgrna.neb.com/#!/sgrna[href=https://sgrna.neb.com/].\nCritical: To generate frame-shift mutations in the target gene, ensure that the two sgRNAs are designed to cut in different reading frames. Similarly, to engineer an in-frame mutation, it is critical to design sgRNAs that cut in the same reading frame (Panday et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nUse commercial in vitro transcription kit (NEB cat# E3322) to synthesize sgRNAs as per manufacturer’s instructions. https://www.neb.com/protocols/2016/05/11/engen-sqrna-synthesis-kit-s-pyogenes-protocol-e3322[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2016/05/11/engen-sqrna-synthesis-kit-s-pyogenes-protocol-e3322].",
    "Critical: Addition of DTT as per manufacturer’s instructions is essential and yields may be dramatically improved if samples incubated for 1–3 h vs the 30 min recommended time.\nFollowing sgRNA synthesis, degrade DNA by addition of DNAase for 15 min at 37°C.\nPurify newly synthesized sgRNA using commercially available RNA purification kit (Zymo Research cat# R1017). Elute sgRNA using 30 μL nuclease-free water.\nEstimate the concentration and purity of sgRNA using Thermo Scientific Nanodrop One and ensure the A260:280 ratio shows 2.0.\nTo further ensure the quality of the freshly synthesized sgRNA, we denature sgRNA using RNA sample buffer and heat at 70°C for 10 min.\nRun denatured sgRNA on a 10% TBE-Urea in 1× TBE running buffer. Use denatured RNA molecular weight ladder in parallel. Run the gel at 180 V for 60 min.\nRemove gel and stain in 2 μg/mL ethidium bromide in water for 20 min at 25°C with gentle shaking.\nImage gel. Typically, you will see one prominent band. Detection of multiple bands or light smearing indicates degradation of sgRNA.\nCritical: Always keep sgRNAs on ice. Store at −20°C for ∼ 1 week. Store at −80°C for long term storage.\nDelivery of sgRNA-Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by transfection\nTiming: 5 days\nUsing sgRNA-Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) transfection method, we can rapidly validate sgRNA pairs that cut the desired genomic loci most efficiently. This validation of sgRNAs narrows down the downstream efforts required to generate a mutant mES cell clone and provides a cost-effective method for parallel generation of clones of various mutant genotypes.\nExpand cell line 3 days before transfection to obtain approximately 80% confluency on the day of transfection.\nOne day prior to transfection, reseed mES cell culture(s) on a plate conditioned by previous ES cell culture, to minimize transfection stress.",
    "On the day of transfection, harvest cells by trypsinizing and re-suspend cells to a final concentration of 0.8 M cells/mL. Seed 0.2 mL (160,000 cells) per well of a gelatinized 24-well plate.\nPrepare two transfection mixes in separate tubes in the concentrations denoted below.\nIn tube 1, dilute commercially available Engen NLS-Cas9 (cat# E3322) to 3 μM (20 μM stock) in Opti-MEM at RT.\nIn the same tube, dilute each individual sgRNA to 3 μM in Opti-MEM at 25°C.\nAssemble RNP in concentrations depicted below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1930_1.csv\nIncubate the RNP mix at RT for 10 min.\nIn tube 2, mix lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM and incubate at RT for 10 min as depicted below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1930_2.csv\nAfter appropriate incubation, mix lipofectamine reaction mix with RNP reaction mix and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nPipette 66 μL into each well (step 12) and mix plate by shaking to ensure equal distribution of the transfection mixture into each well.\nIncubate these cells in a 37°C humidified incubator at 6% CO2 for 6 h.\nAt 6 h, feed cells with 1 mL of prewarmed ES cell medium and incubate cells for 18 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator at 6% CO2.\nAfter 18 h, aspirate transfection medium and refeed cells with fresh ES cell medium to minimize lipofectamine induced toxicity.\nGenomic DNA isolation and plating for retrieval of mutant clones\nTiming: 6–7 days\nThis section focuses on the technique used to isolate genomic DNA from mES cells. After DNA extraction, pure DNA is used to amplify the specific region of the genome targeted by CRISPR/Cas9. This allows us to identify the optimal sgRNA pairs before picking and isolating mutant clones.\nHarvest the cells 72 h after transfection for genomic DNA isolation to verify the sgRNA pairs that worked most efficiently in the pool.",
    "Use PCR to validate successful transfection and to detect the deleted mutant copy.\nFor small deletions (<150 bp), a stronger ‘dropout’ band amplified from the deleted product suggests a more efficient gene deletion.\nFor screening for hemizygotes in the pool, use primers outside of the deleted regions, allowing for amplification of the just the deleted segment (the wild-type allele cannot be amplified because of its large size). Run PCR product on a 1% TAE agarose gel.\nOnce sgRNA pairs have been successfully validated, repeat transfection using the above-mentioned protocol. 72 h after transfection, harvest cells and plate them in three 60 mm dishes containing a confluent layer of irradiated MEFs.\nTo ensure sufficient separation of individual mutant clones and to account for plating efficiency, plate 500, 1000 and 2000 cells/60 mm dish. PCR reactions to detect deleted DNA region following CRISPR/Cas9 treatment:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1930_3.csv\nNote: If the genomic deletion is <150 bp in size, run the PCR product in a 2% gel agarose gel for better resolution. If multiple sgRNA pairs are being validated, it is advised to transfect cells with varying combinations of sgRNA and use all the cells for genomic DNA isolation, PCR and validation of the deletion product. Then, repeat the transfection using a single validated sgRNA pair to plate for single cells and clone picking.\nPicking mES clones and validation of individual genotypes\nTiming: 20–25 days\nAfter RNP transfection, the mutant clones are ready to be retrieved. This section focuses on the methods involved in picking individual clones, isolation of genomic DNA, and the validation of the genotype of these clones.\n7–10 days after plating transfected cells on 60 mm dishes, the clones will be ready for picking.",
    "To pick clones, place the inverted tissue culture microscope in a tissue culture hood, so that the eyepiece is outside and the cell platform inside.\nSterilize the microscope platform with 70% ethanol wipe down.\nPrepare a sterile 96-well plate with 100 μL 0.25% trypsin per well (use trough and 8-multi-channel pipette to dispense the trypsin).\nReplace ES medium with 4 mL of 1× PBS in the 60 mm dish containing single clones.\nWith the plate under the microscope, use a P200 pipette with a barrier filter tip to suction an individual mES cell colony into the filter tip.\nSetup pipette to 50 μL, expel air from the tip and submerge tip into PBS.\nFind the end of the pipette tip in the field of view.\nTo loosen mES cell colony, nudge on the edge of the colony using the end of the pipette tip. Withdraw 50 μL of PBS/mES cell colony mix rapidly into the pipette tip.\nExpel the colony into a well of the 96 well-plate containing the trypsin, pipette 2–4 times to disaggregate the colony into single cells.\nTransfer disaggregated cells plus trypsin to a 24-well plate coated with a monolayer of irradiated MEFs and incubate cells for 18 h in a 37°C humidified incubator at 6% CO2.\nRefeed cells with ES cell medium after 18 h to remove the excess trypsin in the medium.\nAfter 6–7 days, trypsinize cells and reseed the entire well to itself to obtain increased cell numbers for expansion and freeze downs.\nThe day after reseeding, the cells will be ready for freezing and expanding.\nPrepare a 24 well plate containing freezing mix that contains 250 μL of 20% DMSO in mES grade FBS. Label lid of each well with unique clone number (e.g., 1–24, 25–48 etc).",
    "In parallel, prepare four 6 well plates gelatinized for 5 min. Label lids of each well of each 6-well plate to match the clone numbers of the 24-well freezing mix plate.\nAfter gelatinization is complete, replace gelatin with 2 mL mES prewarmed ES cell medium.\nHarvest clones from the previously reseeded 24 well plate by incubation with 2 drops of 0.25% trypsin in PBS for 1 min at 37°C, followed by quenching with 500 μL FBS.\nDisaggregate cells by trituration using a P1000 pipet with a filter barrier tip.\nTransfer 250 μL of trypsinized mES cell suspension to the prelabeled 24-well plate containing 250 μL of freezing mix (step 30a), mix well and store this aliquot of cells immediately at −80°C for future use.\nTransfer remaining 250 μL of trypsinized mES cell suspension to the previously gelatinized 6 well plate, taking care to match clone numbers between frozen aliquot and cultured aliquot. Incubate these cells in a 37°C humidified incubator at 6% CO2.\nAfter approximately 7 days, the 6-well plates will be ready for lysis and genomic (g) DNA preparation.\nUse this gDNA to genotype individual clones using the same primer pairs and PCR conditions used in step 21. Confirm genotypes of both wild-type and mutant clones by DNA sequencing of PCR products.\nNote: We also confirm loss of domain expression by using RTqPCR with primers flanking the deleted domain and validate the protein abundance (or absence of a protein in a mutant clone) using western blotting similar to (Panday et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nThawing and adaptation of single mES mutant clones\nTiming: 14 days",
    "In this section, we describe in detail the various steps involved in thawing mES cells on a monolayer of irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Following thawing, we describe the protocol to adapt these freshly thawed clones onto gelatin. These processes allow us to acclimatize mES cells to gelatin and prepare these cells for downstream functional and biochemical analyses.\nPlace frozen plate on dry ice to prepare cells for thawing.\nThe clones that are validated by PCR and sequencing are thawed by addition of 1 mL of prewarmed ES cell media, one well at a time. As the frozen mix thaws, transfer it to fresh labeled 15 mL tubes. Keep adding 1 mL medium until all the frozen mix has thawed and been transferred.\nCentrifuge these tubes containing thawed clones at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Carefully remove supernatant and transfer pellet to a 6-well plate containing a monolayer of irradiated MEFs.\nNote: The cell pellet will be very small and sometimes is invisible. Be careful while discarding the supernatant to ensure the pellet is not dislodged.\nAfter 5–6 days, colonies will be visible on the 6-well plate and cells must be reseeded onto the same well to provide further conditioning for the freshly thawed cells.\n2 days after reseeding, the cells are passaged (1:5) onto freshly gelatinized 6 well plates. This process will facilitate adaptation of the mES cells onto gelatin.\nThe remaining cells are centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 10%DMSO (in FBS) and freeze in −80°C for 24 h and then in liquid N2 indefinitely.\nOnce the cells are adapted to gelatin and there are no MEFs visible under the microscope, the mES cells are ready for transfection and further assays.",
    "Note: Typically, we thaw equal numbers of mutant clones and isogenic wild type clones that retained wild-type genotype following CRISPR/Cas9 treatment."
