    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPre-surgical analgesia\nTiming: 40 min\nIn this step, SSTCre/+ P1-P2 mouse pups are removed from their home cage and injected with analgesic treatment.\nNote: Pups can be genotyped for SST-Cre as described here: https://www.jax.org/Protocol?stockNumber=013044&protocolID=38270[href=https://www.jax.org/Protocol?stockNumber=013044&protocolID=38270]. However, when breeding a SSTCre/Cre mouse to a C57BL/6J wild-type mouse, all pups in the litter will be SSTCre/+ and no genotyping is needed. If other mouse lines are used, the respective genotyping protocol should be followed.\nNote: Analgesic treatments should be adjusted according to the relevant governmental regulations on animal experimentation.\nRemove the parents from the home cage and temporally place them in a separate clean cage.\nMove the P1-P2 pups to a small box with some of the bedding from the home cage.\nPlace the parents back in the home cage and bring the pups to a separate surgery room.\nPlace half of the box on the heating pad at 37°C to allow the pups to move away from the warmth.\nWeigh the animal and document the weight.\n30 min before the surgery, inject Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) (as analgesic) via subcutaneous (s.c.) injection in the neck with an insulin syringe (30G × 1/2″) by pulling up the skin to create space for the inserted needle.\nNeonatal pial-surface electroporation\nTiming: 15–20 min per pup\nIn this step, P1-P2 pups are anesthetized using isoflurane and then neonatal pial-surface electroporation is performed. The electroporation protocol is adapted from previously published protocols.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nLoad the micro-syringe with plasmid DNA solution.\nNote: To easily load the micro-syringe, put a drop of plasmid DNA solution on a piece of parafilm and tap it with the back of the micro-syringe; DNA solution will slowly enter by capillarity. Then, insert the plunger.\nAnesthetize and maintain the anesthesia as described below:",
    "Turn on the oxygen extractor and wait for the flow to stabilize (1–2 min).\nSet the oxygen flow to 1 L/min.\nPlace the pup into the induction chamber (oxygen 1 L/min, isoflurane 4%).\nAfter 3.5 min, test anesthesia with a gentle foot pinch. If the animal is not anesthetized (i.e., it retracts its paw), wait another 30 s and check it again. Wait for loss of motor response.\nOnce anesthetized, transfer the pup to the heating pad and place the snout into a 3D-printed whole-body mouse mold (we use a mold from a previously published protocol7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Keep the mouse under anesthesia (oxygen 1 L/min, isoflurane 4%).\nNote: A detailed description of the protocol for isoflurane-induced anesthesia in pups has been previously published by Ho and colleagues.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] Alternative anesthesia protocols, such as anesthesia by hypothermia4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] and analgesic treatments can be used according to the relevant governmental regulations.\nInject Meloxicam (5 mg/kg) (as additional analgesic) subcutaneously in the neck with an insulin syringe (30G × 1/2″).\nIf necessary, mark the pup by cutting toes or by other less invasive means, such as toe tattoo.\nWipe the skin over the skull with Chlorhexidine soap solution and apply Emla® cream 5% (Lidocaine/Prilocaine) generously.\nPut a drop of neurogel on both the positive and the negative electrodes (we used platinum tweezertrodes electrodes of 5 mm diameter from BTX, Cat#45-0489; the positive electrode is the one with the blue screw, as depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Use a 1–2 mm thick layer of neurogel covering the entire electrode surface.\nTwo minutes after the Emla® cream 5% application, use spring scissors and cut a small window (1.5 × 1.5 mm) into the skin covering the skull. Cut only three sides of the window, and use the forceps to flip the skin and expose the skull (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Deliver the plasmid DNA above the pia surface by using a previously prepared sharpened glass micropipette.\nHold the capillary between the thumb and the middle finger, keep it tilted at 30°–45° and puncture the skull without penetrating the brain.\nNote: The skull is very soft, in particular at the coronal suture. Since the dura covers the inner surface of the skull, this meningeal layer is easily penetrated when puncturing the skull.\nInject around 0.5 μL (the capillaries are graduated and have a tick every 1 μL) by pressing the plunger with your index finger.\nNote: Since the pia is tightly connected to the brain surface, if you do not puncture the brain you will be injecting right above the pia surface. When injecting above the cortical somatosensory area, you should be able to see the blue plasmid DNA solution spread evenly over a circular surface of around 2.5–3 mm in diameter. If you don’t see this, you are probably injecting too deep inside the brain and not in the meningeal space (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nOptional: Since the skin is quite thin and transparent, it is possible to directly puncture the skin and the skull together, without cutting a window first. We prefer this strategy as it is less invasive and reduces the stress on the parents. However, it is advisable to begin making a window to better understand the anatomy and get experienced injecting in the meningeal space.\nPlace the negative 5 mm electrode over the injection window (the positive electrode is on the opposite side, under the jaw) and apply two trains of ten 50 millisecond-long 99 V pulses, with a 950 millisecond-long interval using a standard electroporator (ECM399, BTX); wait 3 s between the two trains (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Note: Before performing neonatal pial-surface electroporation in the first pup, check once that the electrodes are working. To do so, make a bridge of neurogel between the electrodes and deliver a train of pulses; if you see bubbles forming, the electrodes are working correctly.\nCritical: Be sure to have a gentle, but firm, contact between the head, the neurogel and the electrodes. When delivering a train of pulses, you should be able to see some small bubbles popping inside the neurogel under the negative electrode.\nWipe the residues of neurogel off the head.\nFlip the skin back in position and seal with a small drop of tissue glue (e.g., Vetbond glue).\nPut the animal in a warm recovery cage (a small box with home cage bedding to ensure the pups smell like the home cage and are accepted back by their parents) which is half placed on the heating pad at 37°C (to allow the animals to move away from the heated side).\nRepeat with a new pup until the entire litter has been electroporated; then, return the pups to the parents.\nPlace the pups back in their home cage and observe if the parents correctly nest them.\nIf the mother does not take care of the pups after surgery, check the section troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nFollow up with analgesic treatment according to your local animal experimentation guidelines.\nBrain slicing and imaging\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, pups are perfusion-fixed. Then, the brain is extracted and sliced with a vibratome. Finally, the sections are imaged.\nPerfuse-fix the pups at the required age; in our protocol we tested both P10 and P15 (for a detailed protocol on adult animals, please see Wu et al., 20218[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]):\nTransfer the pups to a dedicated experimental room with a hood for fixative perfusion.",
    "Deeply anesthetize one pup by injecting a solution of Ketamine (65 mg/kg) and Xylazine (13 mg/kg) intraperitoneally using an insulin syringe (30G × 1/2″).\nTest anesthesia with a gentle foot pinch and wait for the loss of motor response.\nOpen the thorax and the diaphragm by using fine scissors.\nExpose the heart, place a small needle (26G) connected to a peristaltic pump (or equivalent pumping system) into the left ventricle and cut a small hole in the right atrium.\nInject 5 mL of PBS 1× to remove the circulating blood followed by 10 mL of Paraformaldehyde 4% in PBS 1× (PFA 4%).\nDissect the brain and postfix it in PFA 4% at 4°C overnight (12–16 h).\nMove the brain to PBS 1× and store at 4°C until slicing (within a few weeks).\nNote: While storing at 4°C, protect the brains from light to prevent fluorescence loss.\nSlice the brains with a vibratome (Leica). Check the vibratome manual for more details on best practices:\nTo cut coronal sections, trim the cerebellum with a sharp blade and glue the cut posterior side of the brain on a vibratome metal block using superglue, with the olfactory bulbs facing up.\nSubmerge the block and the brain in PBS 1×.\nCut 80 μm-thick coronal sections (speed = 0.3 mm/s, amplitude = 1 mm) and transfer them on microscope slides with a tape frame on the borders working as a spacer (if you electroporated the somatosensory area, collect sections matching images from position 153 to position 297 of the Allen Brain reference Atlas https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/thumbnails/100048576?image_type=atlas[href=https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/thumbnails/100048576?image_type=atlas]).\nAdd a few drops of Fluoromount-GTM mounting medium with DAPI, cover with a coverslip, and let the slides dry flat overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.",
    "On the following day, start imaging fluorescent cells using a confocal microscope. We used a Leica SP8 with an HC PL APO CS2 40× water immersion objective, Z-stacks of 0.5 μm, with a resolution of 1600 × 1600 pixels. Both synaptophysin::EGFP and tdTomato channels have to be imaged. An example of a labeled cell is reported in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D. If there appear to be no cells labeled, check the section troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nNote: It is advisable to immobilize the coverslip by sealing it with some nail polish on the sides. If imaging takes several days it is advisable to store slides vertically at 4°C to avoid the coverslip from slowly compressing the tissue.\nImage processing, manual tracing and presynaptic boutons counting\nTiming: 1.5–2 h per cell\nIn this step, tdTomato axons are traced and synaptophysin::EGFP boutons are counted through a custom-made MATLAB script. This script consists of 4 MATLAB files that have to be run sequentially (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2144-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Pipeline of the computational analysis\nextractConfocalData.m: this script uses the Bio-formats library provided by the Open Microscopy Environment consortium to read the confocal picture and converts it into a .mat file. You can check the list of supported formats here: https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.10.0/supported-formats.html[href=https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.10.0/supported-formats.html]. The output is a MATLAB format picture.\nfilterAndSegment.m: this script filters the synaptophysin::EGFP channel using a Wiener filter followed by a bilateral filter.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] Then, both synaptophysin::EGFP and tdTomato channels are thresholded using Otsu’s method.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Finally, synaptophysin::EGFP puncta are segmented using a watershed algorithm.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] The output is a MATLAB file that can be used for axon tracing.",
    "manualTracing.m: this script allows the user to trace cell axons by clicking some anchor points on the process of interest. The script uses these points to find the shortest path that goes through the tdTomato+ axon using the fast marching method.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] The path is computed both from source to sink and from sink to source to improve the centerline tracing. Then, the script calculates synaptophysin::EGFP puncta sizes by finding puncta profiles falling onto 3D centerline profiles (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Finally, the script computes the path distance. The output is a MATLAB table containing the length of the traced axons and the sizes of all detected boutons.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2144-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Presynaptic bouton quantification\nThe picture shows the sequential steps of the custom-made MATLAB script to quantify presynaptic boutons.\n(A) An example of a cell with some axons traced in red (scale bar = 100 μm).\n(A′) Magnification of the blue box in A, with an example of a traced axon (scale bar = 10 μm).\n(A″) Magnification of the orange box in (A′). Puncta along the traced axon are mapped and segmented (scale bar = 5 μm).\n(B) Fluorescent intensity profile of green puncta over axonal length. Puncta size is measured at half of the intensity.\nconvertMATtoTXT.m: this script converts the MATLAB tables into .txt tables ready to be analyzed through RStudio (see “quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]”).\nNote: Computing time depends on the size of the confocal picture and the computational power of your machine. In the following protocol, we report waiting times when processing pictures of 1.5 GB on a machine equipped with Intel® Xeon® Silver 4114 CPU @ 2.20 GHz 2.20 GHz (2 processors) and 512 GB of RAM.\nOpen a web browser and go to the website https://github.com/argunsah/punctaDensity[href=https://github.com/argunsah/punctaDensity] (or to https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6980507[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6980507]).",
    "Download the code (press “Code” and select “Download ZIP”), and extract the punctaDensity-main.zip folder.\nOpen MATLAB. Go to the Home tab > Preferences > General > MAT-Files and make sure that “MATLAB Version 7.3 or later (save -v7.3)” is selected.\nChange the current MATLAB folder to the punctaDensity-main folder; from now on, all newly generated files will be saved here.\nRun extractConfocalData.m file (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2144-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Each step is described in details in the section “image processing, manual tracing and presynaptic boutons counting[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4].”\nSelect the folder containing your confocal images.\nSelect the confocal images you want to analyze.\nPress “Add”.\nYour selected images will appear in the window on the right.\nPress “Done”.\nWait until all selected confocal files are converted into MATLAB format images (these files have the same names as the confocal picture, but .mat extension).\nNote: This could take up to 5 min per confocal picture.\nRun filterAndSegment.m file:\nSelect MATLAB format images from step 27f similarly to steps 27a–e.\nWait until all files are processed and new MATLAB files are created (these files end with “_info.mat”).\nNote: This could take up to 15–20 min per confocal image.\nNote: In case the script gives an error, check the section troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nRun manualTracing.m file:\nSelect files ending with “_info.mat” from step 28b similarly to steps 27a–e.\nWhen an image appears (it takes up to 2 min), adjust the image contrast using the “Adjust Contrast” window. Do not press “Adjust Data” when you are done. Just simply close the window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Note: The image is displayed as a grayscale max intensity projection of both channels merged; this is to facilitate the manual tracing. Nevertheless, only the green channel will be considered for presynaptic bouton counting.\nTo trace the axons, use two keyboard buttons (“z” for zooming in, “x” for zooming out) and two mouse buttons (“left click” to locate a point, “right click” to conclude the tracing).\nChoose an axon and left-click at the tip of a process. Keep clicking more points along the process. When you are done, right-click and wait for the red tracing to be shown on the image (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: The more left-clicked points, the longer it will take to trace the process.\nNote: If there are multiple tangled processes it is necessary to left-click several points along the axon you want to trace.\nIn the “Tracing Quality” window press “Yes” if the tracing of the axon looks fine. Press “No” to discard it and start again the tracing (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nPress “Done” when you have completed tracing all the processes you want to trace. A MATLAB table containing the length of the axons and the sizes of all detected boutons will be created (this file ends with “_infoNums_#date#.mat”). #data# suffix is added to help the user track when the analysis has been performed. A final image with all traced axons labeled in red will be saved for reference (this file ends with “_figure.png”) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nWait for the next image to be loaded and repeat the tracing procedure.\nRun convertMATtoTXT.m file:\nSelect files ending with “_infoNums_#date#.mat” from step 29f similarly to steps 27a–e.\nA .txt file will be created for further analysis using R language (these files end with “_infoNums_#date#_newFormat.txt”) (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2144_3.csv",
