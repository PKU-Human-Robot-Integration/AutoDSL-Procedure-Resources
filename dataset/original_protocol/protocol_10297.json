    "All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Washington University in St. Louis Animal Studies Committee.\n1. Animals\nObtain two strains of mice: 10-week old BALB/c (n = 6, BALB-M, BALB/cAnNTac) and 10-week old nuclear factor kappa-B-luciferase reporter animals (NF-κβ-luc) bred on a BALB/c background (n = 6, BALB/c-Tg(Rela-luc)31Xen).\nPrior to dissection, euthanize animals with CO2 overdose at a flow rate of 2.5-3 L/min for 5 min followed by an additional 2 min of dwelling time.\nDisinfect the outside region of the animal by bathing it in a 70% ethanol bath for 2 min before dissection.\n2. Dissection\nMake a longitudinal vertical cut on the dorsal surface of the mouse using small dissection scissors to expose the body cavity.\nMake two longitudinal vertical cuts on either side of the animal's spine starting from the first lumbar vertebrae (L1) to the caudal vertebrae (C8).\nUsing a scalpel, fine forceps, and fine dissection scissors, carefully remove the spine from L1-C8 from the animal's body cavity.\nCarefully remove excess soft tissues surrounding the spinal column, while ensuring to not scrape or injure the IVD on the ventral side.\nFurther dissect the spinal column into vertebrae-disc-vertebrae functional spinal units (FSUs) at the L1/L2, L3/L4, L5/L6, C3/C4, C5/C6, and C7/C8 discs.\nRinse the FSUs in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 2 min.\nRandomly assign the FSUs into three groups: uncultured and untreated FSUs (Fresh), cultured but untreated FSUs (Control), and cultured and stab treated FSUs (Stab).\nSnap freeze the Fresh FSU samples with liquid nitrogen immediately after dissection and store in a -20 °C freezer.\n3. Organ Culture Conditions\nPrepare 500 mL of sterile culture media of 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM:F12) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.",
    "Using 10 mL serological pipettes, pipette 2 mL of culture media into each well of a 24-well culture plate.\nFollowing dissection and rinse, place each FSU into an individual well in the media-filled 24-well plate.\nIncubate the samples in a sterile incubator that maintains 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2 and > 90% humidity.\nAfter an initial culture period of 24 h, mechanically injure the Stab group samples via needle puncture of the annulus fibrosus using a sterile 27-gauge needle as shown in Figure 1A.\nChange media every 48 h by preparing a new media-filled 24-well culture plate, and transfer samples from the old plate to the new using sterile tweezers. Aspirate the old media and dispose of the old culture plate in a biohazard waste bin.\nOn the final day of culture, incubate all samples in media containing 0.75 mg/mL nitro blue tetrazolium chloride for 24 h.\nAfterwards, freeze all the FSUs with liquid nitrogen and store in a -20 °C freezer until ready for mechanical testing or histology (Figure 1B).\n4. Longitudinal Measurements NF-κB\nImage the FSUs from NF-κβ-luciferase animals at 1, 5, 13, and 19 days to assess NF-κB expression.\nAdd 10 µL of 1 mg/mL luciferin solution to each well and incubate in a sterile incubator at 37 °C for 10 min.\nImage the samples for bioluminescence using the imaging system with a 1 min exposure time and bin setting of 2.\nConcurrently, use the machine to take a photograph and overlay it with the bioluminescence image to determine the anatomical location of luminescence in the IVD.\n5. Mechanical Assessment\nDetermine the mechanical behavior of the IVDs by using displacement-controlled dynamic compression9.",
    "Using a dissection microscope, scalpel, and tweezers, remove the bony vertebral bodies of the FSU from each sample while keeping the cartilaginous endplates intact and attached to the IVD.\nAttach the isolated IVDs to a 1 cm x 1 cm x 0.2 cm aluminum plate using cyanoacrylate glue.\nMeasure the disc height and width by taking an average of three measurements on the longitudinal axis of each disc using a laser micrometer. Calculate the disc height ratio by dividing the average disc height by the maximum disc width.\nUse the measured disc height to calculate the input strain values used in mechanical testing. Note that the average disc height was approximately 690 µm ± 39 µm.\nPlace the samples in a phosphate buffered saline bath under the compression machine and preload the disc to 0.02 N.\nCyclically compress the disc using a sinusoidal waveform at 1 Hz for 20 cycles at the 1% strain level and 5% strain level for 3 trials each and record the load and displacement values of the IVD. Allow 10 min of resting time between trials for the disc to relax and to prevent injury.\nCalculate the average stiffness from the loading phase of the last cycle, and calculate the loss tangent from the phase angle between load and displacement data.\n6. Proteoglycan and Collagen Quantification\nFollowing mechanical testing, measure the disc wet weight by placing the isolated IVD in a pre-tared centrifuge tube and measuring the weight using an analytical balance.\nDigest the isolated IVDs in 250 µL papain digestion solution (0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.01 M EDTA, 0.005 M cysteine HCl, pH 6.4) overnight at 65 °C using a block heater.\nCentrifuge samples for 10 min at 2,000 x g and collect the supernatant fluid.",
    "Measure the proteoglycan content of the IVD by using the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay with chondroitin sulfate standards.\nPrepare DMMB solution (21 mg DMMB, 5 mL absolute ethanol, 2 g sodium formate in 1 L ddH2O).\nPipette 30 µL of standards and samples in triplicate in a 96-well plate, along with 250 µL of DMMB solution in each well.\nRead the absorbance of the plate at 525 nm using a spectrophotometer.\nMeasure the collagen content using a hydroxyproline assay kit according to manufacturer instructions.\n7. Histology\nFix a subset of samples in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, de-calcify in 5% formic acid for 48 h, dehydrate with ethanol, and embed in paraffin.\nUsing a microtome, section the samples sagittally at 10 µm thickness and apply sections to glass slides. Stain the sections using Safranin-O/Fast Green and DAPI.\nUsing a light microscope, image slides at 10X magnification.\n8. Contrast-enhanced microComputed Tomography (microCT)\nScan a subset of samples at the 0, 2, 5, and 7-day time points using longitudinal Ioversol contrast-enhancement10, and terminal phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) contrast-enhancement at the 7 day time point.\n4 h prior to microCT scan time, add 300 µL of 350 mg/mL iodine Ioversol solution to the culture media for a final concentration of approximately 50 mg/mL iodine-containing Ioversol solution and incubate in a sterile incubator at 37 °C for 4 h.\nFollowing incubation, wrap the sample in sterile gauze and place in a 1 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPlace samples in the microCT system and scan at 45 keVp, 177 µA, 10.5 µm voxel size, and 300 ms integration.\nExport data from the microCT as DICOM files and visualize using software (e.g., OsiriX).",
    "At the 7-day time point, fix samples using a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 24 h, followed by 5% PMA solution for 3 days, and scan using the same settings as those used in step 8.4.\n9. Three Dimensional Finite Element Modeling\nSegment the DICOM files of the IVDs using software with manual thresholding (e.g., OsiriX).\nConvert the NP and AF volumes of the IVD into voxel-based finite element meshes using Meshlab.\nCombine the microstructures of the NP and AF to form a complete IVD and apply experimentally determined boundary conditions in the finite element software.\nSubscription Required.
