    "Mobilization of T3SS to A. tumefaciens through triparental mating Triparental mating is used to mobilize a large plasmid from E. coli to A. tumefaciens by using another E. coli carrying helper plasmid—in this case, HB101 (pRK2013).Streak out the recipient A. tumefaciens strain (e.g., GV2260) from the -80 °C freezer onto YEP agar plates containing antibiotic [rifampicin (Rif); 10 μg/mL] and allow it to grow in a 28 °C incubator for two days. Streak out donor (pLN18, TetR) and helper (pRK2013, KmR) plasmid-containing E. coli strains onto LB agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics [kanamycin (Km), 50 μg/mL; and tetracycline (Tet), 5 μg/mL] and allow them to grow in a 37 °C incubator for a day.The day before triparental mating, culture a single colony of A. tumefaciens in 5 mL of YEP medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics [rifampicin (10 μg/mL)] and leave overnight with shaking at 250 rpm and 28 °C. Culture a single colony of E. coli strains carrying donor and helper plasmids in 5 mL of LB liquid medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics, shaking at 250 rpm and 37 °C overnight.On the day of mating, from the overnight cultures, inoculate 300 μL of A. tumefaciens to 3 mL of YEP liquid medium with rifampicin (10 μg/mL) and grow for 3–5 h at 250 rpm and 28 °C; inoculate 30 μL of E. coli to 3 mL of LB liquid medium with appropriate antibiotics and grow for 3–5 h at 250 rpm and 37 °C. Grow all the cultures until A600 reaches 0.3–0.5.Triparental mating (Figure 1 and Figure 2) imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4726/bioprotoc-13-15-4726-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "5 mL microcentrifuge tube separately and spin at 9,391× g for 2 min at room temperature (RT). Discard the supernatants. Wash once by resuspending the pellets in 500 μL of 0.8% NaCl and spin again.Resuspend the pellet in 250 μL of 0.8% NaCl.Mix 50 μL each of the three cultures in a microcentrifuge tube and spot it on a plain LB plate; allow it to dry for a few minutes and incubate the plate at 28 °C for two days.Scrape off the mat-like growth (Figure 3) and resuspend in 500 μL of 0.8% NaCl in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Spread 10 and 50 μL and the rest of the suspension in three separate AB (Gelvin, 2006) plates with Rif and Tet and incubate the plates at 28 °C for 2–4 days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4726/bioprotoc-13-15-4726-g003.jpgFigure 3. Representative image showing mat-like growth on plain LB plate Isolate single colonies for glycerol stocks and colony PCR.Assays using A. tumefaciens expressing T3SS and T3Es Either electroporation or the freeze-thaw method is used to transform GV2260 (pLN18) with a broad host range plasmid containing T3E (e.g., pBBR1MCS5-AvrPto-PhiLOV). Western blot and microscopy can be used to demonstrate effector secretion and delivery, respectively. In this protocol, we use western blot hybridization to show that T3Es are expressed and delivered out of the cell.A. tumefaciens strains expressing T3SS and T3E are streaked onto YEP agar plates along with appropriate controls and incubated at 28 °C for two days. GV2260, GV2260 (pLN18), and GV2260 (pBBR1MCS5-AvrPto-PhiLOV) are used as controls.Inoculate two colonies into 20 mL of HDM medium (Huynh et al., 1989) in 50 mL screw-cap tubes and incubate at 28 °C for 16 h shaking at 220 rpm.Aliquot a small amount of culture (A600 = 0.25) in a 1.",
    "5 mL microfuge tube and centrifuge in a tabletop centrifuge at 9,391× g at RT for 2 min. Use the resulting pellet for pellet fraction analysis.Centrifuge remaining cultures at 3,220× g for 15 min at 21 °C.Using 25 mL pipettes, carefully remove the top 15 mL of the supernatant solutions without disturbing the pellet, by lowering the pipette slowly into the supernatant.Transfer the supernatant fraction to 50 mL tubes and filter using a 0.45 μm Durapore PVDF membrane Millipore filter with lab vacuum connection.Transfer 13 mL of the filtrate to Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters and concentrate using a swinging bucket rotor at 3,220× g for 30 min at 4 °C.Add the remaining 12 mL of the filtrate to the same Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter and concentrate at 4 °C for another 30 min at 3,220× g.Recover the concentrated filtrate from the bottom of the filter device and again concentrate to ~30 μL using Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filters at 14,000× g for 40–60 min at 4 °C.Recover the concentrated sample by keeping the filter device upside down in a new microcentrifuge tube and spin for 2 min at 1,000× g in a refrigerated centrifuge. Store the concentrated sample at -80 °C until analysis.Proteins from the pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to electrophoresis through an SDS-PAGE gel using standard protocols, and immunoblot analysis was carried out using PhiLOV-specific antibody (dilution 1:5,000) (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4726/bioprotoc-13-15-4726-g004.jpgFigure 4.
