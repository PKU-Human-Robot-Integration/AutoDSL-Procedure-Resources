    "1. Basic Set Up Before Proceeding to Cell Culture\nNeuroCult NSC Basal Medium and NeuroCult NSC Proliferation Supplements are mixed at a 9:1 ratio, respectively, to make complete NSC medium.\nA 37 °C water bath is used to warm up the medium.\nAppropriate amount of heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) is thawed.\nAppropriate amount of stock growth factor solutions including epidermal growth factor (EGF at 10 μg/ml), basic fibroblastic growth factor (b-FGF at 10 μg/ml) and 0.2% heparin solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) are thawed.\nTissue culture flasks (T25, T75 or &T175) are needed for NSC expansion and differentiation.\nTissue culture treated 96 and 24 well plates and glass coverslips are needed for plating sorted cells.\n2. Isolation, and Expansion (Passaging) of NSCs\nNeural stem and progenitors are isolated and expanded from mouse brain as described in separate protocols 1, 2 3.\nWhen the neurospheres (either primary or passaged neurospheres) are ready for subculture (150-200 μm in diameter), the medium containing spheres is transferred to an appropriate size sterile tissue culture tube, and centrifuged at 800 rpm (110 g) for 5 min at room temperature.\nThe supernatant medium is removed and the spheres are re-suspended in 1 ml of pre-warmed 0.05 % trypsin-EDTA.\nAfter incubation in a 37 °C water bath for 2-3 min, an equal volume of soybean trypsin inhibitor is added to the cell suspension to stop the trypsin activity.\nTo ensure that the trypsin has been completely inactivated, the cell suspension is gently pipetted up and down 3-5 times. \nAfter centrifugation at 800 rpm (110 g) for 5 min, the supernatant is removed and the cells are re-suspended in 1 ml of complete NSC medium. \n10μl of the cell suspension is mixed with 90 μl of trypan blue to perform a cell count.",
    "Note: Other appropriate cell dilutions can also be used.\nThe cells are then used for subculture 1, 2 or for differentiation as described below.\n3. Differentiation of Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells, The Neuroblast Assay (NBA)\nCells resulting from dissociated neurospheres are plated at a concentration of 2-3 x 105 cells/ml in the complete NSC medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF, 10 ng/ml bFGF, 1 μl/ml of 0.2% heparin and 5% heat inactivated FCS in an appropriate size tissue culture flask. 5 ml medium is used for T25, 20 ml for T75 and 40 ml for T175 flasks.  Note: FCS will cause the cells to firmly attach to the substrate and there is no need for coating the flasks for NBA culture.\nCulture flasks are then incubated in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 3-4 days. This period is called proliferation stage, during which NSC progeny attach to the substrate and proliferate as a monolayer of cells.\nWhen the culture becomes 90-95% confluent, the medium of each flask is switched to the complete NSC medium supplemented with 5% FCS without any growth factors.\nCulture flasks are again incubated in a 37 ° C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for another 3-4 days. This period is called differentiation stage, during which neuronal progenitors appear on top of an astrocytic monolayer and proliferate to make colonies of immature neuronal cells. On day 4-5 of differentiation stage, the culture is ready for isolation of the neuroblast cells using flow cytometry technology.\n4. Cell Preparation for Flow Cytometry\nTrypsinization\nThe culture of differentiating NSC progeny on day 4-5 of differentiation stage is washed once with an appropriate amount of PBS (2 ml for T25, 4 ml for T75 and 8 ml for T175 flask) to remove FCS from the culture.",
    "Note: FCS blocks Trypsin-EDTA activity.\nThen, a sufficient amount of pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (2 ml for T25, 4 ml for T75 and 8 ml for T175 flask) is added to each flask to cover the cell monolayer and incubated for 1-2 min in a 37 °C humidified incubator.\nThe flask is checked under the microscope to evaluate the effect of Trypsin-EDTA on the culture. The flask is then held with one hand and struck firmly with the other hand to dislodge the cells from the bottom of the flask.\nEqual volume of soybean trypsin inhibitor is added to the flask to quench trypsin activity. The cell suspension is gently pipetted up and down to ensure trypsin inactivation and to achieve a homogenous single cell suspension.\nNote: Alternatively, medium supplemented with 5% FCS could be used to quench trypsin activity.\nTo remove non-dissociated clumps, the cell suspension is passed through a 40-μm-size mesh filter.\nThe cell suspension is then centrifuged at 800 rpm (110g) for 5 min, the supernatant is removed and the cells are re-suspended in an appropriate volume of complete NSC medium. \nThe final volume of cell suspension is adjusted so that the cell density does not exceed 2-3x106-cells/ml. High cell density might cause stream blockage in the flow cytometry machine.\nIf you would like to isolate neuronal cells just based on their physical properties, now you can proceed to FACS sorting as described in part 4.\nBefore sorting, Propidium Iodide (PI, Sigma, 500 μg/ml in PBS) is added at a concentration of 1 μl/ ml of cell suspension to exclude dead cells.\nLive cell immunolabeling",
    "To achieve a higher purity of neuronal cells, harvested single cell from the NBA culture can be stained for PSA-NCAM (a marker of early immature neuronal progenitors) and then the positive cells from the neuronal population can be isolated using the FACS machine.\nAfter performing a cell count, the single cell suspension from the NBA culture is divided into four groups:\n  \nCells alone group, serves as a control to adjust parameters and gates (0.5-1 x 106 cells).\nCells plus PI, serves as a control to adjust parameters and gates (0.5-10 x 106 cells). PI negative cells from this group can also be sorted based on the cells physical characteristics.\nSecondary alone (Isotype control) group that also serves as a control to adjust parameters and gates (1-2 x 106cells).\nImmunolabeling group (8-10 x 106 cells) that is stained for PSA-NCAM to achieve further purification of the immature neuronal cells. To exclude dead cells upon sorting, PI is added to this group as well.\nTo start immunolabeling, cells are centrifuged at 800 rpm (110 g) for 5 min. The supernatant is removed and the cells are re-suspended in 100 μl of complete NSC medium.\nPhycoerythrin (PE) conjugated anti-PSA-NCAM antibody is added at a ratio of 10 μl / 5-10 x 106 cells to the cell suspension to be stained for PSA-NCAM. In the same way, a PE conjugated mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody is added to the isotype control cell suspension. Follow the instructions on the antibody specification sheet regarding the concentration of antibody to be used. The cell suspension is then mixed gently and incubated at room temperature for 10-15 min in dark.",
    "The cell suspensions (PSA-NCAM and Isotype control tubes) are then centrifuged at 800 rpm (110 g) for 5 min, the supernatant is removed and the cells are re-suspended in 1 ml of complete NSC medium.\nTo remove excess un-bounded antibodies from the samples, step 4 is repeated 2-3 times.\nAfter re-suspending cells in an appropriate volume of medium, Propidium Iodide (PI, Sigma, 500 μg/ml in PBS) is added at a concentration of 1 μl/ml of the cell suspensions (cells plus PI, isotype control and PSA-NCAM-stained samples) to exclude dead cells when analyzed by flow cytometry.\n15 ml sterile falcon tubes containing 1 ml of complete medium are prepared to collect sorted cells from different cell populations. \n5. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) of Immature Neurons\nThe FACS machine is set up based on its user manual instruction via the flow cytometry facility expert technician. \nPhosphate buffered saline (PBS) or any other appropriate solution depending on manufacturer instructions, could be used as the sheath fluid at 28 PSI through a 90 μm nozzle. \nDifferential pressure on the system is adjusted such that the sort trigger rate does not exceed 2500 events/second. \nThe cell suspension from the cells alone group is run through the FACS machine. \nFirst, the cells (events) are plotted based on their size (Forward Scatter (FSC) light) versus internal complexity (Side Scatter (SSC) light) to distinguish different cell populations. To do so, voltage parameters for FSC and SSC should be adjusted so that the cells can be seen in the flow cytometry plot.",
    "To exclude cell clumps and doublets, the cells are first plotted based on forward scatter area (FSC-A) versus forward scatter pulse width (FSC-W) and the single cell population is gated as population 1 (P1). Then the P1 cells are plotted based on side scatter area (SSC-A) versus side scatter pulse width (FSC-W) and this time the single cells are gated as population 2 (P2). Having established these two consecutive gates, clumps or doublets (high FSC pulse width and high SSC pulse width) are being excluded.\nTo exclude dead or damaged cells, the single cells (P2) are plotted based on PI reactivity versus FSC-A and the single live cell population is gated. \nSingle live cells are plotted based on FSC versus SSC to distinguish different cell populations based on cell size and internal granularity. At this stage two main cell populations are gated as FSClow SSClow (P3) and FSChigh SSChigh  (P4) cell populations. \nTo sort PSA-NCAM immuno-reactive immature neuronal cells from the FSClow SSClow population, first the FSClow SSClow population from control (cells plus PI and isotype control) groups is plotted based on PE immunoreactivity versus FSC-A and the negative cells are gated (P5), and then positive cells from PSA-NCAM stained group are gated as population 6 (P6). \nAfter adjusting all needed gates, cells of interests are sorted into 15 ml sterile tissue culture tubes containing 1ml NSC medium. \nSorted cells are then centrifuged at 1200 rpm (240 g) for 5 min.\nSupernatant is discarded and the pellet is re-suspended in an appropriate volume of medium (depending on the pellet size) and a cell count is performed.",
    "Cells are then plated in Poly-L- Ornithine coated 96-well plates at a density of 20-30 x 103 cells /well in 200-250 μl of complete NSC medium with 5% FCS and 20 ng/ml human recombinant BMP4 5.\nNote: to coat 96 wells, 100 μl of Poly-L- Ornithine working solution (1.5 ml Poly-O and 8.5 ml of sterile PBS) is added to each well and the plate is incubated in a 37 °C incubator for at least one hour. Then, the Poly-O is removed and each well is washed three times with sterile PBS (let the PBS remain in the well for 10 min each time). Use 500 μl of Poly-L- Ornithine working solution / well if 24-well plates are used. \nCells are then fixed at different time points after sort using cold 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for appropriate neuronal and glial cell markers to assess the phenotype of sorted cells from different cell populations.\n    \n6. Representative Results",
    "In the neuroblast assay (NBA) differentiation culture, plated cells attach to the tissue culture substrate and grow as a monolayer. Depending on initial cell plating density, the culture will turn into a 90-95% confluent culture after 3-4 days. At this stage, a monolayer of mainly astrocytic cells can be visualized underneath with small round neuronal progenitor cells on top4,5 (Figure 1).  After switching the medium to a growth factor free medium, neuronal progenitor cells start dividing rapidly and generate clusters of immature neuroblast cells on top of the astrocytic monolayer in 4-5 days (Figure 2). Flow cytometry analysis of dissociated NBA culture on day 4-5 of differentiation stage, shows two main cell populations; FSClow SSClow and FSChigh SSChigh based on cell size (FSC) and internal granularity (SSC) (Figure 3). Immuno-fluorescent analysis of the sorted cells shows that the neuronal cells are mainly located in the FSClow SSClow populations (with more than 75% of them expressing β-III tubulin), while sorted cells from the FSChigh SSChigh population are mostly GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes (Figure 4). Further purification of immature neuronal cells up to near homogeneity (97%) could be achieved with positive selection of PSA-NCAM IR cells from the FSClow SSClow population (Figure 3, 4). Enriched neuronal cells generated from the NSCs isolated from E14 mouse ganglionic eminences acquire a GABAergic phenotype and express DARPP-32, a marker of medium spiny neurons, upon differentiation (Figure 5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3712/3712fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
