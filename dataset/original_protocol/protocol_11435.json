    "All animal work was performed in accordance with WVU IACUC approved protocol.\n1. Probe Synthesis and Calibration\nParticulate pO2-sensitive LiNc-BuO probe\nNote: LiNc-BuO microcrystals are synthesized and prepared as described in reference13. They are very stable and can be kept at room temperature for years. The EPR linewidth of the LiNc-BuO particulate probe is a pO2-sensitive parameter. LiNc-BuO microcrystals demonstrate ideal linear dependence of the linewidth on oxygen concentration in the range from anoxic conditions up to 760 mmHg of pO2 partial pressure13, with the values of intrinsic linewidth in the absence of oxygen and the slope of the oxygen dependence (measured in mG/mmHg) slightly varying for different batches of the microcrystal preparation. Therefore, calibration is required for every particular batch.\n\t\nWeigh 60 mg of LiNc-BuO microcrystals.\nFor oxygen sensitivity calibration, suspend microcrystals in 3 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) medium (in a concentration of 20 mg/mL) and sonicate for 5 min on ice with a probe sonicator at 20 kHz using 7 W power in a 5-mL glass round-bottom tube.\nPlace 1 mL of the sonicated microcrystals in a glass tube in the surface coil resonator of the L-band (1.2 GHz) EPR spectrometer and acquire continuous waves (CW) EPR spectra at the physiological temperature of 37 °C and oxygen concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 20.9%. Maintain the oxygen concentration by bubbling the solution with gas mixture delivered from a gas controller and maintain the temperature using a water bath attached to a thermostat. Use the following EPR spectrometer acquisition parameters: modulation amplitude, 100 mG; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; sweep width, 5 G; sweep time, 60 s.",
    "To achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), use a modulation amplitude value of 60% of the linewidth (e.g., use a modulation amplitude 0.6 G for the linewidth of 1 G).\nAlternative simplified calibration procedure: Record the EPR spectra in air-bubbled and anoxic solutions14. In the latter case, maintain anoxia in the samples by the addition of 10 mM glucose and 100 U/mL glucose oxidase to 1 mL probe solutions according to reference14.\nFit the EPR spectra with the Lorentzian function to find the line width, LW. Evaluate the sensitivity of microcrystals to pO2 as a slope of the dependence of LW on pO2, namely as a value of (LWair−LWanoxia)/pO2air, where LWair and LWanoxia are spectra linewidth in air and anoxia conditions, respectively; pO2air = 152 mmHg.\nDual function pH and redox probe, NR\nNote: The NR probe is synthesized as described in reference11. It is stable at room temperature both as a solid and in aqueous solutions. The synthesized NR probe is kept at 4 °C. The nitrogen hyperfine splitting, aN, and the signal amplitude decay rate are the spectral parameters of the NR probe that are sensitive to pH (probe pKa = 6.6 at 37 °C, range of pH sensitivity from 5.6 to 7.6) and to the reducing capacity of the probe microenvironment, respectively.\n\t\nRemove the NR from the freezer and allow the container to warm to room temperature (10 - 15 min). Weigh out 6.34 mg of the NR, dissolve it in 1 mL of saline solution, and adjust the pH to 7.2 with small aliquots of HCl or NaOH using a pH meter. Use the prepared NR solution (10 mM) as a stock solution.",
    "Perform the pH calibration of the NR probe as follows (see reference11). First, add 0.1 mL of the NR stock solution to 0.9 mL of 2 mM Na-phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl. Titrate the obtained 1 mM NR solution with aliquots of HCl or NaOH to the required pH using a pH meter. Control the temperature using a water bath attached to a thermostat.\nRecord the EPR spectra of the samples in 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes using the L-band EPR spectrometer. Use the following EPR spectrometer acquisition parameters: modulation amplitude, 2.5 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; sweep width, 60 G; sweep time, 20 s.\nMeasure the hyperfine splitting constant (aN) as half of the distance between low- and high-field components of the EPR spectra and plot it versus pH, to provide the calibration curve for L-band EPR measurements of pH.\nGSH-sensitive RSSR probe",
    "Note: The RSSR probe is synthesized as described in reference15. Store the synthesized NR probe at 4 °C. The lipophilic RSSR disulfide biradical compound easily diffuses across the cell membrane to react with intracellular GSH and provide a reliable approach for determining GSH in vivo using EPR16,17. This method is based on the high reaction rates of the predominant intracellular pool of GSH thiols with the RSSR probe. The reaction of the RSSR biradical with GSH splits its disulfide bond (see Scheme 1) resulting in the cancellation of spin exchange between the two radical fragments and manifesting in a decrease of the biradical spectral components and corresponding increase of the monoradical components. For the biradical RSSR probe, the rate of the increase of the amplitude of the monoradical component is proportional to the GSH concentration and is a convenient GSH-sensitive EPR spectral parameter. To evaluate GSH concentration from the in vivo EPR measurements, the preceding calibration of the rate of the RSSR reaction with GSH at the corresponding temperature and pH has to be performed as follows.\n\t\nRemove the RSSR from the freezer and allow the container to warm to room temperature (10-15 min). Weigh out 4.05 mg of the NR and dissolve it in 1 mL of DMSO solution. Use the prepared RSSR solution (10 mM) as a stock solution.\nDetermine the value of the rate constant, kobs, of the reaction of RSSR with GSH at the desirable temperature and pH as follows.\nFirst, add 20 µL of the RSSR stock solution (10 mM) to 0.98 mL of 1 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, to obtain a 0.2 mM RSSR probe solution.",
    "Prepare solutions of 1, 2, and 5 mM concentrations of GSH in 0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. To accurately evaluate GSH concentration in the cells of the targeted organ from the in vivo measurements, the in vitro calibration has to be performed at a pH close to the value of the intracellular pH.\nMix equal volumes of 0.2 mM RSSR solution and one of the GSH solutions prepared in step 1.3.4. for a final concentration of the probe at 0.1 mM and of GSH at 0.5, 1, or 2.5 mM.\nImmediately after RSSR and GSH solution mixing, place the sample in the EPR resonator and record the EPR spectra every 12 seconds for 10 minutes. Then calculate the kinetics of the increase of the monoradical spectral amplitude. Use the following EPR spectrometer acquisition parameters: modulation amplitude, 1 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; sweep width, 60 G; sweep time, 10-60 s.\nFit the measured EPR kinetics to the monoexponents and calculate the time constant of the exponential kinetics, τ. The linear regression (1/τ = kobs × [GSH]) provides the observed rate constant value of the reaction between GSH and RSSR (e.g., at 34 °C and pH 7.2, kobs = 2.8 ± 0.2 M-1s-1)11.\nMultifunctional HOPE probe for pO2, pH, and Pi assessment",
    "Note: The monophosphonated trityl HOPE probe is synthesized as described in reference12 and is kept at 4 °C. The CW EPR spectra of HOPE at pH << pKa (A - acid form) and pH >> pKa (B - basic form) are represented by the doublets due to phosphorus hyperfine splitting, aP. The typical instrument settings are as follows: modulation amplitude, 37.5 mG; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; sweep width, 0.9 G; sweep time, 20-60 s. At intermediate pH (5 < pH < 8) the EPR spectrum of HOPE probe is characterized by a quartet when both A and B states are present. The individual EPR linewidth of the HOPE is a pO2 marker (accuracy, ≈ 1 mmHg; pO2 range, 1-100 mmHg). The fraction of protonated HOPE (A form) is a pH marker in the range from 6 to 8.0 (accuracy, ± 0.05). The value of the proton exchange rate (expressed in mG) with Pi extracted by spectra simulation is a Pi marker (accuracy, ± 0.1 mM, range, 0.1-20 mM). Calibration procedures are performed at physiological temperature (37 °C), solution ionic strength (NaCl, 150 mM), and HOPE probe concentration of 0.2 mM, as previously described in references12,18, and detailed below.\n\t\nRemove the HOPE probe from the freezer and allow the container to warm to room temperature (10-15 min).\nWeigh out 10.7 mg of the HOPE probe, dissolve it in 1 mL of saline solution, and adjust the pH to 7.4. Add 20 µL of the prepared stock solution of the HOPE (10 mM) to 0.98 mL of the saline solution to obtain a 0.2 mM HOPE probe solution.",
    "For probe calibration of the pH, titrate 0.2 mM of the HOPE probe solution by the addition of a small volume of NaOH or HCl, with the final dilution of sample less than 1%. Measure the pH with a pH electrode calibrated at 37 °C using the pH values for the reference solution recommended by National Bureau of Standards (U.S.). Use a jacketed reaction beaker attached to a circulator to carefully maintain temperature of the reference and titrated solutions during pH measurements. Maintain anoxic conditions by the addition of 10 mM glucose and 100 U/mL glucose oxidase to the probe solutions.\nAcquire the EPR spectra of the A and B forms at pH ≤ 5 and pH ≥ 8, respectively, in anoxic conditions in the absence of phosphate.\nUse the corresponding spectra to obtain intrinsic spectral parameters. Namely, simulate the spectral line as the convolution of the Lorentzian function with the Gaussian function that approximates the unresolved super hyperfine structure of the HOPE probe. The fitting of the calculated EPR spectra to the experimental spectra yields the values of aP and Lorentzian linewidth (ΔLpp), determined by the transverse relaxation rate, 1/T2 (where 1/T2 = (√3/2)Lpp for the measured derivative of the RF absorption line in CW EPR), and the linewidth of Gaussian distribution, G.\nNote: The following are the parameters obtained from the spectra measured at the conditions specified in step 1.4.2: aP(A) = 3.63 G, aP(B) = 3.37 G; 1/T2(A) = 23.6 mG; 1/T2(B) = 9 mG; G(A) = 40 mG; G(B) = 45 mG (see reference8).",
    "Acquire the EPR spectra of the HOPE at intermediate pH (5 < pH < 8). Simulate the high-filed component of the acquired EPR spectra using the theory of exchange between several sites in non-coupled or loosely coupled systems adapted from reference19 as previously described18. Use the intrinsic parameters obtained for A and B states (see step 1.4.5) to decrease the number of variables. Fit the calculated spectra to the experimental ones to find the values of the fraction A (pA), and plot the dependence of the pA value on pH. Use the dependence of pA on pH in further studies as a pH calibration curve.\nNote: Fitting the pH dependence of pA with a standard titration curve provides the value of the dissociation constant, pKa (HOPE) = 6.98. In in vivo studies, acquiring the full EPR spectra of the HOPE probe is impractical because of the additional time needed to acquire the gap between low- and high-field components of the phosphorus hyperfine splitting in the EPR spectrum. Therefore, in further exemplified studies only the high-filed component of the EPR spectrum has been measured and analyzed.\nFor probe calibration of pO2, acquire EPR spectra of the HOPE probe at various oxygen concentrations.\nControl the pO2 values of the solutions by bubbling with gas mixture delivered from a gas controller. Control the solution temperature (37 °C) using a water bath attached to a thermostat.\nSimulate the EPR spectra and fit them to the experimental ones as described in step 1.4.6 to determine the values of oxygen-induced relaxation rates.\nNote: The values of oxygen-induced relaxation rates were 0.49 mG/mmHg both for A and B forms of the HOPE probe as measured at 37 °C8.",
    "For probe calibration of [Pi], acquire EPR spectra of the HOPE probe at various phosphate concentrations. Use the HOPE radical solution with a pH value near pKa (pKa = 6.9 at 37 °C)18 and titrate it with various phosphate concentrations. Maintain the temperature and gas composition as described in above steps.\nSimulate the EPR spectra and fit them to the experimental ones as described in step 1.4.6 to determine the values of Pi-induced exchange rate.\nNote: The dependence of the Pi-induced exchange rate on [Pi] is used as calibration in further studies.\n2. Mouse Models of Breast Cancer\nMMTV-PyMT spontaneous tumor model\n\t\nUse 4-8 week-old female Friend virus B-type susceptibility/NIH (FVB/N) mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV) polyoma middle-T antigen (PyMT+) mice with spontaneously formed mammary tumors for in vivo EPR studies.\nFor comparison of tissue microenvironments of normal mammary glands and tumors, use age-matched littermate females deficient in the PyMT oncogene (PyMT−, \"wild type\")20.\nSubject the mice to L-band EPR spectroscopy once per week for four weeks during isoflurane anesthesia (see probe delivery below).\nAnesthetize the mouse using an air-isoflurane mixture (3% isoflurane), and place the mouse on an adjustable table in a right, lateral position with the tumor (mammary glands) close to the surface coil resonator.\nAfter mouse placement, administer the probe by intratissual (i.t.) injection, tune the EPR spectrometer, and acquire the EPR spectra for 5-10 min.\nMeasure 2-3 mammary tumors (from MMTV-PyMT+ mice) or non-tumor bearing mammary glands (from PyMT− mice) during the same EPR session.\nOrthotopic MET-1 tumor model",
    "Grow FVB/N background Met-1 murine breast cancer cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 µg/mL insulin, 5 ng/mL rhEGF, and 1% PSA (penicillin G sodium, streptomycin sulfate, and amphotericin B) to ~ 80% confluence in a T175 flask.\nAspirate the media and rinse the adherent cells with 10 mL PBS (1.54 mM KH2PO4, 155 mM NaCl, and 2.71 mM Na2HPO4-7H2O without calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, pH = 7.4).\nDetach the cells by adding 5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution and rocking the flask.

Probe Delivery for In Vivo Functional Measurements\nUse particulate LiNc-BuO probe (Protocol I) for pO2 measurements in orthotopic tumor models by implanting tumor cells with internalized LiNc-BuO microcrystals as previously described14,21 and detailed below.\n\t\nIn the case of the MET-1 tumor model, for internalization of LiNc-BuO microcrystals into MET-1 cells, suspend the LiNc-BuO microcrystals in DMEM at a concentration of 20 mg/mL and sonicate with a probe sonicator at 20 kHz using 7 W power in a 5-mL glass round-bottom tube for 5 min on ice.",
    "Add 100 µL (2 mg of LiNc-BuO) of the suspension to a T75 flask with 10 mL culture media containing MET-1 cells (approximately 30% confluent). All procedures take place in a biosafety cabinet and the media contains penicillin and streptomycin to minimize potential infection.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C for 72 h or until they reach ~ 80% confluency.\nAspirate the media.
