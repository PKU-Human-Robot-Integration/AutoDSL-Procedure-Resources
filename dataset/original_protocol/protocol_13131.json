    "1. Stress treatment of E. coli strains MG1655 and CFT073\nInoculate 5 mL of lysogeny broth (LB) medium with a single colony of commensal E. coli strain MG1655 and uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strain CFT073, respectively, and incubate for 14-16 h (overnight) at 37 °C and 300 rpm.\n\tNOTE: Escherichia coli CFT073 is a human pathogen. Handling of CFT073 must be performed with appropriate biosafety measures in a Biosafety Level-2 certified lab.\nDilute each strain into a 500 mL flask containing 70 mL of 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS)-glucose (MOPS-g) (Table 1) medium to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) value of 0.1. Incubate at 37 °C and 300 rpm until mid-log phase is reached (OD600 = 0.5-0.55).\nTransfer 20 mL of each culture into three prewarmed 125 mL flasks and incubate at 37 °C and 300 rpm for 2 min.\n\tNOTE: As timely processing of the samples is required, handle no more than 6 cultures at a time.\nPrepare an antimicrobial compound solution in MOPS-g medium at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Add the antimicrobial to each culture to reach the indicated concentrations. For the untreated control, add the required volume of MOPS-g medium.\n\tNOTE: Vortex the 2 mg/mL antimicrobial solution to allow an even distribution of the compound particles and avoid sedimentation.\nIncubate the cultures for 45 min at 37 °C and 300 rpm.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62628/62628fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Escherichia coli stress treatment. Bacterial cultures are grown in MOPS-g and treated with the indicated concentrations of the silver-ruthenium-containing antimicrobial when the mid-log phase is reached. Abbreviations: LB = lysogeny broth; Ag-Ru = silver-ruthenium; MOPS-g = 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS)-glucose.

    "After 45 min of stress treatment, determine the OD600 of each culture. For each sample, harvest cells equivalent to 4 mL of OD600 = 1 in 15 mL centrifuge tubes by centrifugation for 15 min at 3,000 × g and 4 °C.\nCompletely remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets in 50 µL of ice-cold lysis buffer (Table 1). Incubate the samples for 30 min on ice.\n\tNOTE: This lysis step degrades the peptidoglycan layer. Always use freshly prepared lysis buffer.\nTransfer the samples into 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Freeze at -80 °C until further use.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62628/62628fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Bacterial sample collection.

Extracting the insoluble protein aggregates\nThaw samples on ice.\n\tNOTE: The freeze-thaw cycle contributes to cell lysis.\nAdd 360 µL of ice-cold buffer A (Table 1) and mix gently by pipetting.\n\tNOTE: The osmotic shock will also contribute to cell lysis.\nTransfer the sample to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube containing ~200 µL of 0.5 mm glass beads. Incubate for 30 min at 8 °C in a thermomixer with shaking at 1,400 rpm.\n\tNOTE: This step results in the physical disruption of the cell. A protease inhibitor can be used to minimize protein degradation. The disruption can be performed at 4 °C. Note that the use of glass beads has been reported to induce aggregation of a small subset of proteins in yeast19.\nIncubate for 5 min on ice without shaking to settle the glass beads. Transfer 200 µL of the cell lysate into 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\tNOTE: Avoid the transfer of the glass beads.",
    "Centrifuge at 16,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. Collect the supernatant, which contains soluble proteins, and proceed to section 4.\nResuspend the pellet in 200 µL of ice-cold buffer A (Table 1) using the pipette. Centrifuge at 16,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. Carefully remove the supernatant altogether.\nAdd 200 µL of ice-cold buffer B (see Table 1 and the Table of Materials) and carefully resuspend the pellet by pipetting.\n\tNOTE: The non-ionic detergent solubilizes membrane protein.\nRepeat the centrifugation at 16,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 200 µL of cold buffer A (Table 1) by pipetting. Centrifuge at 16,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. Completely remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 µL of 1x reducing SDS sample buffer (Table 1) and boil for 5 min at 95 °C in a thermomixer.\nStore the sample at -20 °C to proceed later or immediately load on an SDS polyacrylamide gel for separation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62628/62628fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Extraction of insoluble protein aggregates. The extraction of protein aggregates involves a series of steps including cell disruption, the separation of protein aggregates from soluble proteins, the solubilization of membrane proteins, and washing.

Soluble protein sample preparation\nMix 1 volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) with 4 volumes of soluble protein sample from step 3.6.\n\tNOTE: Handling of TCA requires a fume hood and personal protective equipment and an approved waste disposal procedure.\nIncubate for 10 min at 4 °C to allow for protein precipitation.\n\tNOTE: White precipitate will appear very soon.",
    "Centrifuge to precipitate at 21,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 200 µL of ice-cold acetone to remove cellular debris. Centrifuge at 21,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat these actions in step 4.3 a total of three times.\nPlace the microcentrifuge tubes with open lids in a thermomixer at 37 °C to remove the remaining acetone from the pellet.\n\tNOTE: Incubation of more than 5 min may reduce the solubility of the protein pellet.\nAdd 100 µL of 1x reducing SDS buffer (Table 1) and completely dissolve the pellet. Boil the sample for 5 min at 95 °C.\nStore sample at -20 °C to proceed later or immediately load on an SDS polyacrylamide gel for separation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62628/62628fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Preparation of soluble proteins.

Separation and visualization of extracted protein aggregates using SDS-PAGE\nPrepare a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.\n\t\nFor two separating gels, pipette 5.1 mL of double-distilled water (ddH2O), 3.75 mL of Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 7.5 mL of 20% (w/v) SDS, 6 mL of 30% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1) solution, 75 mL of 10% w/v ammonium persulfate, and 10 mL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and mix gently without introducing air bubbles. Pour the gel using a 1 mL pipet within the glass plates, leaving the upper 2 cm free of the mixture. Add 70% ethanol on the top of the separating gel and allow an even interface between the two layers.",
    "After polymerization of the separating gel, prepare the stacking gel by pipetting 1.535 mL of ddH2O, 625 mL of Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 12.5 mL of 20% (w/v) SDS, 335 mL of 30% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1) solution, 12.5 mL of 10% w/v ammonium persulfate, and 2.5 mL of TEMED. Remove the ethanol from the separating gels and add the stacking gel solution. Insert a comb with the desired number of pockets without introducing air bubbles. Allow polymerization for 20-30 min.\nLoad 4 µL of each sample and protein ladder into separate wells and run the gel(s) in Tris-Glycine running buffer (Table 1) at 144 V for 45 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Stop the gel when the bromophenol band is about to migrate out of the gel.\nStain the gel(s) in a prewarmed Fairbanks solution A (Table 1) for 30 min on a rocker.\nDecolor the gel(s) in a prewarmed Fairbanks solution D (Table 1) until the desired background (e.g., overnight) on a rocker.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62628/62628fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Protein separation and visualization.
