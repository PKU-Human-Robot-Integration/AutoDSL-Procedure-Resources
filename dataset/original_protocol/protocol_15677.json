  "procedures": [
    "This experiment was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. All mice were kept in the animal laboratory of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. This protocol is divided into four parts. The first two parts introduce the method of building the electrode and the electric circuit using a slip ring to connect the electrodes and the EEG recording/stimulation equipment. The third part describes the operation method of electrode implantation, and the fourth part presents the EEG recording and stimulation parameters used for the amygdala epilepsy model.\n1. Fabrication of electrodes\nKeep the following previously prepared materials ready: two 3 cm long pieces of Teflon-coated tungsten wire (bare diameter: 76.2 µm), one piece of silver wire (bare diameter: 127 µm) of the same length, and one set of 2 x 2 gauged row pins.\nUse a lighter to burn one end of each tungsten wire to remove 5 mm of the insulation coating.\n\tNOTE: The tungsten wire with the insulation removed turns black; this part of the tungsten wire is referred to as the upper end.\nPeel a section of ultrafine multi-strand wire and wrap it from the bottom to the upper end where it starts to get dark, continuing to the top. Combine this superfine wire (has a soft texture) with the tungsten wire by pinching one end and gently twisting the other end, which enables the two materials to be easily entwined together.\nGently pull to ensure that they are tightly wrapped and cut off excess superfine wire. Try to keep the tungsten wire straight throughout the process.",
    "Fix the row pin to the clamp on the welding table with the longer side of the pins facing outward. Use the syringe needle to pick up some solder paste and apply it to the pins. Heat the welding torch to 320 °C; melt and smear some lead-free tin wire with the torch tip.\nOverlap the upper end of the tungsten wire with one needle of the row pins and use the solder on the torch to bond the tungsten wire to the pin.\n\tNOTE: It would be very difficult to weld the tungsten wire with the pins directly without the help of the superfine wire.\nWeld another tungsten wire and another silver wire to the row pin in the same way so that each wire corresponds to a needle (see Figure 1,i).\nCut two heat-shrinkable tubes slightly longer than the upper end of the tungsten wire. Put them on the solder joint of two tungsten wires, ensuring that the conductive part is fully covered in the tube so that the circuit of the two tungsten wires is not placed in series.\n\tNOTE: Although there are three wires, if two of them are insulated, the three wires will not be in series; a tube can also be added to the silver wire.\nRemove the electrode from the welding table clamp and hold the electrode gently with large pliers, as it is easy for electrodes to lose their shape when heating the shrinkable tube, using a good thermal conductivity clamp with slightly more force.\nTurn on the air duct and heat until a temperature of 320 °C is reached. Blow the heat-shrinkable tube for several seconds until it is tightened (see Figure 1,ii).",
    "If the needles separate from the plastic body during the welding process, splice the welding part and the plastic body with a hot melt adhesive (see Figure 1,iii). Be careful not to smear it on the interface as this would affect the interface insertion.\nHold the two tungsten wires and twist them together, keeping their ends apart (see Figure 1,iv). Trim the twisted tungsten wires to approximately 10 mm in length so that the separation at the ends does not exceed 0.5 mm.\n\t​NOTE: This step can also be performed before electrode implantation to allow flexible adjustment of electrode length.\nHeat the glue gun and apply the glue evenly around the electrode.\nCheck the electrodes with a multimeter: place one bar of the multimeter on the unwelded side of the row pins, and gently touch the end of tungsten wire or silver wire to the other bar, checking whether the circuit is smooth. Ensure that the lines are not placed in series.\n2. Slip ring connection and circuit description\nNOTE: When the electrodes on the mice are plugged into an EEG device via cables in a free-moving condition, the cables can become tangled as the mice move and turn around. This causes the cables to become shorter, eventually hindering the mice from moving or causing the cables to fall off their heads. In the method described here, a four-channel slip ring is introduced to prevent the cables from falling off. The four channels are represented in four colors in Figure 1B.\nPeel off 5 mm of the insulation skin at each end to expose the metal wire inside.\nAdd a section of heat-shrinkable tube to each stator wire.\nWeld each wire with the EEG device connector plug.\nShrink the heat-shrinkable tube with hot air.",
    "Add a section of heat-shrinkable tube to each rotor wire.\nScrew the conducting parts of the red and orange wires together and weld them to a joint in the header to fit the row pin.\nWeld the other two wires on the header to each joint.\n\t​NOTE: The brown channel that corresponds to the silver wire is connected to the EEG device for grounding. The red and orange channels receive signals from the same tungsten wire, and the orange channel serves as a reference for the EEG device. The signals in the red channel are meaningless, but they must coexist with the black channel to form a current stimulus. The signals in the black channel are the real electrical signals in the brain. Different circuits can be designed with multi-channel slip rings to suit different devices.\n3. Surgery for implantation\nAnimals\n\t\nUse 8-week-old C57BL/6 wild-type male mice, weighing 24-26 g, for surgeries.\nHouse them with a 12 h light-dark cycle (light time: 8:00-20:00) in a temperature-controlled environment (22 ± 1 °C) and provide water and feed ad libitum.\nUse an extra heat mat to keep the animals warm during the surgery.\nAfter the surgery, inject meloxicam subcutaneously (10 mg/kg) as the first administration of analgesics. Then, place the animals in separate cages to optimize recovery. Add meloxicam to the animal's diet for the first week after surgery.\nAfter the experiment, infuse the left ventricles of the mice with 4% paraformaldehyde under anesthesia, and collect the brain tissues for histological verification of the electrode target.\nWeigh the mouse and anesthetize it by intraperitoneal injection of 1% pentobarbital solution. Sterilize all the surgical instruments and consumables to be used, including drill bits, electrodes, dental cement, etc., by autoclaving.",
    "When the mouse is completely anesthetized, shave the hair from the eye to the ear area with a razor.\nFix the mouse on the stereotaxic frame. Put the front upper teeth into the incisor bar and insert both ear bars equally deeply into the ears. Apply erythromycin eye ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness and blindness caused by a bright light during surgery.\nDisinfect the surgical area with three alternating swabs of iodophor and 75% alcohol in a circular motion. Then, make a sagittal incision forward from the middle of this incision, and cut off the skin on either side of the incision to create a triangular window.\nRoll a small piece of cotton into a ball and wet it with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Remove the soft tissue attached to the skull by gently rubbing the exposed area with a small cotton ball until the anterior and posterior fontanelle are clearly seen.\nAdjust the anterior and posterior heights so that the anterior and posterior fontanelle is in the horizontal position. Consider the position of the anterior fontanelle to be the origin of the axes.\nFix a stainless-steel screw to the left cerebellar skull, using a drill to create a flat surface. Ensure that the screw protrudes halfway out of the skull.\nEnsure the coordinates for the amygdala kindling are −1.67 mm posterior, −2.7 mm lateral, and −4.9 mm ventral from the bregma. Adjust the stereotaxic device to locate this spot and mark it.\nDrill a hole on the marked spot with a 0.5 mm diameter skull drill.",
    "Fix the electrodes to the locating rod of the stereotaxic device, place the electrode vertically above the hole, and drop the position to −4.9 mm slowly. Wrap the silver wire around the screw three times, taking care not to shake the electrode body during operation.\nMix the dental cement and gently apply it to the electrode and skull surface. When the dental cement hardens, modify the outside until the cement that encloses the fixed electrode turns into a cone.\nWhen the cement has hardened, release the electrode from the stereotaxic device. Subcutaneously administer meloxicam 10mg/kg to relieve discomfort caused by pain in animals. Administer meloxicam to animal food for analgesic effect in the first week after surgery. Remove the mouse and place it back in the cage, keeping it separate from the other mice.\n4. Electrical kindling\nAllow the mice to rest for at least 1 week after surgery before kindling to allow for postoperative recovery and to allow the inflammation to subside.\n\tNOTE: In general, mice that have not recovered adequately do not respond well to kindling.\nPut the mouse in a customized box with slip-ring cables connecting the electrode on the mouse's head and the EEG device. Run the cable through a hole in the lid of the box, and adjust the length left in the box to allow the mouse to move freely.\nTurn on the EEG device and check whether it is working properly. Set the stimulator to deliver 1 ms monophasic square-wave pulses at 60 Hz for a 1 s train duration.",
    "Start with a current intensity of 50 µA for the first stimulation; monitor the EEG for after-discharge, which is characterized by high-frequency spikes. If no after-discharge is observed, add 25 µA to the next stimulus, and continue this process every 10 min until an after-discharge is observed and lasts 5 s.\n\tNOTE: If the experiment does not require a discharge, step 4.4 can be skipped; 300 µA is strong enough for kindling.\nStimulate the mouse with the current intensity determined in step 4.3 every 15 min, no more than 20 times a day.\nMonitor the behavioral responses to the stimulus.\n\tNOTE: The occurrence of three consecutive grade V episodes is considered full kindling, combined with Racine rank standard17.\nSubscription Required.
