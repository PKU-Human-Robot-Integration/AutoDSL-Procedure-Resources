    "1. Micropipette Production\nInjection micropipette\n\t\nPlace a borosilicate glass capillary (outer diameter (OD): 1.0 mm, inner diameter (ID): 0.75 mm) in a micropipette puller (in the center of the right and left capillary holders) and lock it.\nUse an appropriate program to pull the glass capillary so it results in a thin tip with a long tapper. (Example: Heat: 825; Pull: 30; Velocity: 120; Time: 200; Pressure: 500).\nCarefully remove the pulled pipettes from the device and place it on a microforge in a horizontal position.\nBring the pulled pipette and the microforge heater filament with its glass bead into focus. Use the eyepiece reticle to measure the desired thickness and move the pipette horizontally until the heater filament reaches the target inner diameter (5 µm).\nAdjust the heat to about 45% and gently bring the pipette down so it touches the filament. Activate the heater briefly. This will slightly melt the pipette so it adheres to the filament and upon cooling, the pipette will break at the contact point generating a straight cut.\n\t\tNote: Setting the appropriate temperature is key in this step since temperatures too high will make the pipette bend and thus a straight cut will not be possible and temperatures too low will not be sufficient to melt the pipette (Figure 1A).\nMake an approximate 30° angle near the pipette tip by positioning it about 10 µm away from the heater filament. Set the temperature to 60% and activate the heater.\n\t\tNote: This will bend the pipette over the filament. This angle is desired so the tip of the needle is parallel to the surface of the injection plate when mounted into the injector (Figure 1B).\nHandle microinjection pipettes with caution as they are extremely sharp and fragile. \nHolding micropipette",
    "Place a borosilicate glass capillary (OD: 1.0 mm, ID: 0.75 mm) in a micropipette puller (in the center of the right and left capillary holders) and lock it.\nUse an appropriate program to pull the glass capillary so it results in a thin tip with a long even taper and parallel walls (Example: Heat: 815; Pull: 20; Velocity: 140; Time: 175; Pressure: 200).\nCarefully remove the pulled pipette from the puller device and place it on the microforge holder in a horizontal position. Adjust the focus on the heater filament and pipette.\nUse the eyepiece reticle to measure the pipette diameter and move the pipette until its diameter over the filament reaches 180 µm.\nAt the indicated size, mark the glass capillary with a diamond tip pen, and then gently press on the pulled tip to break the glass. This should result in a straight cut (Figure 1C).\nMove the pipette to a vertical position with its tip close to the filament. Set the temperature of the microforge to 60%.\nFire-polish the tip of the pipette using standard techniques7 until it reaches an ID of 40 µm. Use the eyepiece reticle to check the ID (Figure 1D).\nMake an angle on the pipette.\n\t\t\nBring the pipette back to a horizontal position about 10 µm away from the filament and 5 mm away from its tip. Set the temperature to approximately 60% and activate the heater to bend the pipette over the filament. Continue heating until a desired angle (of about 30o) is reached. Check the angle visually (Figure 1E).",
    "Note: The pipette is usually mounted to the microinjector at an approximate angle of 60o with respect to the bottom of the injection dish. The tip of the pipette is bent so it is parallel to the bottom of the dish, which is necessary for the correct injection of the embryo at its middle plane.\n2. Micromanipulator Setup\nCheck that the microinjectors are fully loaded with oil and that there are no air bubbles in the system (bubbles in the microinjector prevent fine control of injection).\nCheck that the micromanipulators are in the center position. This will allow for a wide range of movement of the pipettes.\nInsert the holding pipette into the left micromanipulator holder and the injection pipette into the right micromanipulation holder.\nAllow oil to enter into the pipettes by capillarity and check that the system is working properly by moving oil up and down inside the pipette using the microinjector controls.\n\tNote: If there is no movement of oil inside the needles, there might be a clog. In this case, use a new needle.\nUse the micromanipulator controls to bring the pipettes into the center of the microscope's field of view. Using 4X magnification, check that the micropipette tips are in the correct angle (parallel to the bottom of the dish).\n\tNote: A correct setup of the needles is key for a successful injection and for results consistency.\nCalibrate the laser system following the manufacturer's calibration manual.\n3. Preparation of Injection Dish (Figure 2)",
    "Place a 50 µl drop of warmed (37 °C) SOF-HEPES (composition detailed in the materials section) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) on the center of the lid of a 100 mm petri dish. Place a 1 - 2 µl drop of the solution to be injected close to the injection drop. Ensure that the embryos do not cool down below RT.\n\tNote: In this protocol we will add the Dextran-Red dye to the injecting solution to be able to visualize the site of injection and track it later.\nCover the drops in the injection plate using approximately 10 ml of mineral oil.\nPlace the injection dish on the stage of the inverted microscope and bring the pipettes into the injection drop. Check that the needles are in focus inside the drop. Adjust their height as needed using the micromanipulator controls.\nUsing a microdispenser, load about 20 - 30 zygotes (17 - 20 hr post-fertilization (hpf)) in the upper side of the injection drop. Perform injection at room temperature so the number of embryos in the injection drop is determined by the speed at which the person can inject them. Do not load more embryos than the ones that can be injected in 30 min.\n\t\nTo load the embryos into the microdispenser, depress the plunger fully and immerse the tip into the solution containing the embryos. Touch the embryos to be picked up with the tip of the glass capillary (one at the time) and slowly release the plunger so each embryo enters into the capillary. Repeat this until all the embryos are picked up or the microdispenser capacity is full.\nTo release the loaded embryos, depress the plunger gently until the entire volume containing the embryos is released from the capillary.\n4. Microinjection",
    "Using the 4X objective, load the solution to be injected into the injection pipette by applying negative pressure (aspirating). Load sufficient solution to inject 2 - 3 zygotes. Then move to the injection drop.\nWithin the injection drop, move the holding pipette so the tip gets close to a zygote. Apply negative pressure (aspirate) with the holding microinjector so the zygote gets fixed to the holding pipette and change to a 20X objective.\nOnce the zygote is attached to the holding pipette, check its quality using the injecting pipette to gently move the embryo around without detaching it. A good quality zygote should have the two polar bodies (although sometimes only one is seen) and a homogeneous cytoplasm. Do not inject abnormal zygotes (Figure 3A).\nIf necessary, reposition the embryo for a proper injection location. A good positioning would be that in which there is some space between the ZP and the PM, so the PM does not get damaged by the laser.\nCheck that the injection pipette is positioned on the embryo's mid-plane by gently touching the zygote on the site of injection. If it is not on its mid-plane, the needle will tend to make the embryo rotate instead of puncture. Adjust the height of the injection pipette as needed.\nMake a hole in the ZP using a laser (Figure 3B).\n\t\nUsing the laser's software place the laser reticle in the ZP where the hole will be made (on the opposite side to where the embryo is attached to the holding pipette). Using the laser control window click on the fire button. Ensure that the size of the hole is large enough to create an opening in the ZP for the needle to pass through without damaging the PM (Example: 0.662 msec Pulse width/ 6.9 µm Hole size).",
    "Pass the injection needle through the hole in the ZP and make contact with the PM. Continue pushing the pipette forward until the needle is ¾ of the way into the embryo (Figure 3C).\nObserve the position of the meniscus at the solution-oil interphase, as this will be used to consistently control injection volume.\nApply negative pressure (aspirate) on the injection pipette, which will result in PM and cytoplasm being aspirated into the injection needle. Continue until the movement of cytoplasm into the needle accelerates or when cytoplasm content mixing up with injection solution can be seen. These will indicate breakage of the PM (Figure 3D).\nInject back the cytoplasmic content followed by the solution into the cytoplasm of the zygote by applying positive pressure (injecting), until the meniscus at the solution-oil interphase has advanced one zygote's diameter equivalent past the starting point.\n\tNote: Under our conditions, this represents approximately 7 pl of injected solution (Figure 3E).\nChange to a 4X objective and move the injected embryo/s to the lower side of the injection drop. Release the embryo by applying positive pressure on the holding microinjector. Keep the non-injected embryos on the upper side and the injected ones on the lower side of the drop to help keep track of the injected/non-injected embryos and work efficiently.\n5. Embryo Recovery and Injection Results\nMake 3 drops of approximately 200 µl in a new dish with pre-warmed SOF-HEPES. Collect the injected embryos using a microdispenser (as described above). Wash the injected embryos by moving them through the 3 SOF-HEPES drops.\nCount the embryos lysed during microinjection and discard them.",
    "Note: A lysed zygote can be easily distinguished from an intact one since the first one appears translucent, fill out the whole ZP, and it usually has cytoplasmic content leaking to the outside of the embryo.\nOptionally, check the microinjection efficiency using a fluorescent microscope. Be aware that UV light exposure can induce embryo damage that can affect subsequent development.\nCulture groups of 25 injected embryos in 50 µl drops of potassium simplex optimization medium (KSOM) supplemented with 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) under mineral oil at 38.5 °C, 5% CO2 in air, and humidity to saturation.\nSupplement the culture media with 5% FBS two days after injection.\nCheck blastocyst (BL) rates 7 days after injection. Calculate BL rates as total number of blastocyst embryos/total number of embryos cultured in that drop.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
