    "The experiments were performed in accordance with the German animal welfare law (TSchG) and Directive 2010/63/EU pertaining to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The official approval for this study was granted by the Governmental Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol No.: AZ 87-51.04.2010.A065; Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen, Recklinghausen, Germany). The study protocol complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Postoperative pain treatment is based on the recommendations of the German Society for Laboratory Animal Science (GV-SOLAS) as well as Initiative Veterinary Pain Therapy.\n1. Basic techniques and common procedures\nUse homozygous apoE-/- Sprague-Dawley rats. Identify the genotype of each animal by using standard methods17.\nKeep the animals under identical conditions (21 °C ± 2 °C, 60% ± 5% humidity, and a 12 h light/dark cycle) and ensure free access to water and food.\nCarry out all procedures under clean but nonsterile conditions.\nOnce the rat is anesthetized, perform all procedures under a surgical microscope at a magnification of 16x.\nUse cotton swabs for compression hemostasis. Gauze swabs (5 cm x 5 cm) soaked with lactated Ringer solution are helpful to keep the groin moist.\nFollow waste disposal regulations to dispose used materials.\n2. Preparations before surgery\nPrepare the veterinary drugs before starting the operation. Keep all solutions at room temperature, unless otherwise indicated.\nThirty minutes before the procedure, administer 0.03-0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously.\nAnesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg body weight (BW) (S)-ketamine and 8 mg/kg BW xylazine.\nAssess the rat’s weight using a weighing scale.",
    "Place the rat on a heating pad and fix the upper and lower limbs using medical tape. Position the rat with its left hind limb fully extended and as much in line with its spine as possible so as to create a straight line between femoral artery and aorta. This will facilitate advancing the balloon-mounted stent through the aortic bifurcation.\nMaintain anesthesia with inhalation of 1.5 vol% isoflurane in 97.5% oxygen at a flow rate of 2 L/min.\n\tNOTE: Allow the rat to breathe spontaneously, without intubation.\nApply eye ointment to prevent eye damage during unconsciousness.\nShave the fur from the groin and lower abdomen area of the rat and sterilize the corresponding skin with a povidone-iodine solution.\nBefore starting the surgery, verify adequate depth of anesthesia by pinching the tail tip and the interdigital tissue. \n3. Surgery\nMake a medial incision of ~0.5‒1 cm in the left groin to open the skin and the underlying fascia.\nBluntly dissect and probe in the depths until the pulsating left femoral artery can be identified.\nUsing very fine forceps, prepare the femoral artery by gently removing the surrounding connective tissue. Be careful to harm neither the femoral nerve nor the femoral vein, which is medial to the artery.\nPrepare about 1 cm of the femoral artery. Carefully put the tip of the forceps under the vessel to gently lift it.\nThread pieces of 4-0 silk suture under the distal and proximal parts of the artery and form slings. Clamp the ends of each of the two thread slings between the branches of a surgical clamp. Use the surgical clamps to control the artery. Gently stretch and lift the slings in order to temporarily interrupt blood flow.\n\tNOTE: Work fast to avoid a prolonged tourniquet which may lead to tissue damage.",
    "Using sharp micro scissors, perform an arteriotomy in the middle of the femoral artery.\nIntroduce a guide wire through the arteriotomy. When reaching the proximal thread sling, release the tension of the thread by moving the surgical clamp and advance the guide wire further towards the abdominal aorta.\n\tNOTE: Cut the guide wire using a wire cutter to facilitate handling.\nPlace the proximal end of the guide wire between the diaphragm and the renal arteries.\n\tNOTE: Advancing the guide wire too far bears the risk of aortic or cardiac injury. We recommend opening the abdomen to ensure adequate positioning of the guide wire and the stent at least for the first several animals.\nIntroduce a crimped and balloon-mounted coronary stent measuring 2.25 mm x 8 mm (max. 2.5 mm x 8 mm) over the guide wire into the femoral artery and advance it to the abdominal aorta.\nPlace the stent just above the aortic bifurcation but below the renal arteries. Deploy the stent by inflating the balloon catheter to 12 atm for 15 s by using an inflation syringe system.\nDeflate the balloon catheter and maintain negative pressure according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for the stent in use.\nSlowly withdraw the deflated catheter while leaving the stent in place.\nJust before taking out the catheter, create tension on the thread loop above the incision with the surgical clamp to interrupt blood flow again. Then remove the balloon catheter and directly ligate the vessel proximally.\nTie the proximal and the distal thread loops to ligate the femoral artery and confirm adequate hemostasis of the arteriotomy. Collateral arteries will ensure further perfusion to the limb.\nClose the muscle overlying the artery, as well as the skin incision by using 10-0 non-resorbable sutures.\n4. Animal care after stent implantation",
    "Immediately after the operation, allow the rat to recover for 60 min in a special intensive care unit cage with warmed air (30‒35 °C) and an oxygen supply.\nWatch the animals carefully until fully recovered. Afterwards, move the rats into a normal cage. Provide ad libitum access to water and food.\nAdminister postoperative analgesia every 6-12 hours with 0.03-0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine (s.c., in 500µl NaCl) for a total of 72 hours under clinical assessment.\nHave the food mixed with clopidogrel (15 mg/kg) to avoid thrombosis of the implanted stent.\nTo enhance hypercholesterolemic conditions and plaque formation, start western diet feeding at 6‒8 weeks after birth and continue until euthanasia. If desired, a cohort of animals fed normal rat chow can serve as control.\n5. Tissue collection and processing\nBefore starting the tissue explantation at the designated time point, euthanize the animal according to IACUC guidelines. Harvest the stented aorta for histological analysis at the end of the observation period.\nOpen the abdomen by a midline incision and remove the stented segment of the aorta as well as adjacent non-stented parts of the aorta, measuring 0.5 cm each.\nPlace the tissue into a solution of 4% buffered formalin for 24 h for fixation.\nEmbed the stented arterial tissue in plastic and perform histological and immunohistochemical staining according to standard protocols18,19.\n6. Histomorphometric analysis\nPerform histomorphometric analysis of sequential sections of the proximal, middle, and distal part of the stented aorta by means of a microscope linked to a computer with an appropriate image analysis software.\nTrace the contours of the external elastic lamina (EEL, between adventitia and media), internal elastic lamina (IEL, between media and neointima), and lumen with a graphic drawing tablet. From these values, calculate EEL area, IEL area, and lumen area with the software.",
