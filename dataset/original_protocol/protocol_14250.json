    "Animal studies were conducted with the consent of the Local Ethical Committee (28/ŁB29/2016) in accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 22, 2010, and institutional recommendations.\n1. TNBS-induced murine model of Crohn's disease\nNOTE: This protocol uses male BALB/C mice weighing 25-28 g. Animals are housed at a constant temperature (22-24 °C) and, relative humidity 55 ± 5%, and maintained in a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to standard chow pellets and tap water ad libitum.\nPlace the mouse into the induction chamber and close the lid tightly. Anesthetize the mouse briefly with isoflurane (25% O2 with O2 flow rate at 1.5-2 L/min).\n\tNOTE: Respiratory rate should remain rhythmic and slower than normal and should not change in response to a noxious stimulus.\nInstill 4 mg of TNBS in 0.1 mL of 30% ethanol in 0.9% NaCl or 0.1 mL of 30% ethanol in 0.9% NaCl as a vehicle control into the distal colon through a catheter.\n\tNOTE: The catheter should be carefully introduced approximately 3 cm into the anus.\nMonitor the mouse daily from day two to eight for clinical parameters including body weight, rectal bleeding, stool consistency and mortality.\nOn day eight, euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60813/60813fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Timeline for TNBS-induced murine model of Crohn's disease.

Separation and macroscopic evaluation of colon\nNOTE: One day before colon separation, dilute 100 µL of antibiotic in 1 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and leave at 4 °C overnight.\nClean the skin over the abdomen using 75% ethanol and sterile gauze.\nCut the abdominal wall from breastbone to anus using sterile scissors and tweezers.",
    "Cut off the colon as close as possible to the anus and cecum.\nPlace the colon on the Petri dish. Cut the colon along from the anus into the cecum end. Clean and wash the colon 2-4 times in cold antibiotic-PBS solution.\nPerform macroscopic evaluation using a caliper according to Table 1.\n\tNOTE: Tissue adhesion* and erythema/hemorrhage#, fecal blood# and diarrhea# are subject to visual assessment. *Tissue adhesion evaluate using a three-point scale (0: colon without tissue adhesion, 1: colon with moderate tissue adhesion, 2: colon with extensive tissue adhesion); #based on absence (0) or presence (1) of erythema/hemorrhage, fecal blood and diarrhea.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6\nAdhesion*,Erythema/ hemorrhage#,Fecal blood#,Diarrhea#,Length of ulcer,Colon thickness,Colon length\npoints (0 – 2),points (0 – 1),points (0 – 1),points (0 – 1),cm/points,mm/points,cm/points\n0 – absent,0 – absent,0 – absent,0 – absent,0.5 cm = 0.5 point,n mm = n points,0 – <10% shorter than the control\n1 – moderate,1 – present,1 – present,0.5 – slight/loose stool,0.5 cm = 0.5 point,n mm = n points,1 – from 10 to 20% shorter than the control\n2 – present,,,1 – present,0.5 cm = 0.5 point,n mm = n points,2 – over 20% shorter than the control\nTable 1: Macroscopic scoring of the intestine of mice with TNBS-induced model of Crohn's disease.\nConvert the length of the ulcer in centimeters to a point scale, i.e., every 0.5 cm of ulcer is counted as 0.5 point. Convert the thickness of the colon in millimeters to a point scale, i.e., every n mm corresponds to n points.",
    "Convert the length of the colon in centimeters on a three-point scale. The length of colon obtained from each mouse with TNBS-induced Crohn's disease is evaluated in relation to the average colon length for the control group (0: <10% shorter than the control, 1: from 10 to 20% shorter than the control, 2: over 20% shorter then the control).\nCalculate the total macroscopic score according to the equation: Total macroscopic score = adhesion (points) + erythema/hemorrhage (points) + fecal blood (points) + diarrhea (points) + length of ulcer (points) + colon thickness (points) + colon length (points).\n3. Colon sample preparation\nCut the colon into 1-2 cm fragments and place each on sponge in an appropriately labeled histological cassette.\n\tNOTE: Sponges for histological cassettes prevent colon folding during dehydration and incubation in liquid paraffin.\nPlace the colon fragment in 4% formaldehyde and incubate for at least 24 h at 4 °C.\nPrepare and program the tissue processor for 1 h of incubation in 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, 100% ethanol, xylene/100% ethanol (1:1; v/v), and xylene only, as well as for at least 3 h of incubation in liquid paraffin.\n\tNOTE: Dehydration must be performed in increasing concentrations of ethanol and xylene, but the concentration of ethanol can be modified. The xylene/ethanol mixture is recommended but not required.\nTransfer the colon fragment to a histological box and place in the pre-programmed tissue processor.\nRun the tissue processor.\nAfter incubation steps, place the colon fragment in a metal mold so that the two ends of the colon are in an upright position and fill one third of the mold with liquid paraffin.",
    "Place the mold in the cooling area (-5 °C) for a few seconds, and then move the mold to the warming area (70 °C). Place in the bottom part of the histological box and cover the entire colon fragment with liquid paraffin.\nLeave the metal mold with the colon fragment in paraffin for a few minutes in the cooling area. Remove the metal mold from the paraffin block and incubate for at least 24 h at 4 °C.\nRemove excess paraffin from the block and insert it into a fully automated rotary microtome.\n\tNOTE: The paraffin block may be stored at -20 °C for a few minutes before this step.\nCut the colon fragment into 5 µm sections.\nTransfer the colon section to a water bath preheated to 40 °C.\nUse the labeled glass slide to remove the colon section from the water bath.\n\tNOTE: The colon sections float on the water. Put the labeled glass slide in the water under the colon section and withdraw the glass slide carefully.\nLeave the glass slide for 24 h at room temperature. For long term storage, keep the glass slide at 4 °C after 24 h of incubation at room temperature.\n4. Immunohistochemistry with immunofluorescence staining\nNOTE: Do not allow the colon section to dry at any step during the procedure.\nRemove paraffin by incubating the glass slide in xylene for 5 min. Repeat this step three times.\nPlace the glass slide in xylene/100% ethanol (1:1; v/v) for 5 min. Repeat this step three times.\nRehydrate the colon section in a series of decreasing ethanol concentrations, i.e., 70%, 50%, 30% and 10% ethanol for 5 min. Repeat each step three times.\nRinse the glass slide under running water for 5 min.",
    "Preheat antigen retrieval buffer (10 mM sodium citrate; 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) to 95-98 °C and heat the glass slide in boiling antigen retrieval solution for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: The antigen retrieval step is optional but recommended. The unmasking solution should be optimized depending on the antibody used in the experiment.\nDraw a circle around the colon section using a hydrophobic pen.\n\tNOTE: This step is optional but recommended. The hydrophobic pen prevents waste of reagents by keeping the liquid pooled in a small volume inside marked the circle.\nIncubate the section in 3% water solution of hydrogen peroxidase for 10 min.\nWash in washing solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.05% Tween 20) for 5 min.\nIncubate in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.05% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: In the blocking solution, the normal serum must be from the same species as the secondary antibody. In stages where incubation is required, place the glass slide in a humidity chamber to prevent excessive evaporation.\nRemove the blocking solution and add 20-50 µL of primary antibody against ERα, ERβ or GPER diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100.\n\tNOTE: Recommended dilutions of primary antibodies are shown in Table 2.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5\nAntibody type,Antibody against,Clonality,Host species,Species reactivity,Dilution\nPrimary,ERα,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Human,1:100\nPrimary,ERα,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Mouse,1:100\nPrimary,ERα,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Turtle,1:100\nPrimary,ERα,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Capybara,1:100\nPrimary,ERβ,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Human,1:100\nPrimary,ERβ,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Monkey,1:100\nPrimary,ERβ,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Rat,1:100\nPrimary,ERβ,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Mouse,1:100\nPrimary,ERβ,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Sheep,1:100\nPrimary,ERβ,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Pig,1:100\nPrimary,GPER,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Human,1:100\nPrimary,GPER,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Rat,1:100\nPrimary,GPER,Polyclonal,Rabbit,Mouse,1:100\nSecondary,DyLight 650,Polyclonal,Goat,Rabbit,1:250\nTable 2: Characteristics of antibodies.\nIncubate with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in darkness.\nRemove the antibody solution and wash in washing solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.05% Tween 20) for 5 min.
