    "The main protocol for the induction of chronic inflammation and associated immune suppression by repetitive immunizations of mice with M.tb is presented below. Refer to Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0004] for detailed instructions for the preparation of the M.tb aliquots and use of those when preparing the M.tb emulsion for injections.\nMaterials\n4 to 6 male or female, 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, cat. no. 000664)\n1 mg/ml M.tb emulsion (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0004], steps 4 to 12)\n0.3 mg/ml buprenorphine (Bupaq Multidose)\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Dulbecco's PBS, without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Biological Industries, cat. no. 02-023-1A)\n2 mg/ml concentrated M.tb emulsion (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0004], steps 13 to 15)\nFlow vaporizer for isoflurane inhalational anesthesia (VetFlo isoflurane system), with induction chamber and rodent face-mask adaptor\nAlcohol wipes\n2.5-ml Luer syringes with 25-G needles (for M.tb emulsion injections)\nDigital weighing scale (suitable for mice)\n1-ml Luer syringes with 27-G needles (for buprenorphine injections)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for preparing 0.5 mg/ml M.tb solution (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0004], steps 16 to 19), for mouse euthanasia by CO2 asphyxiation or cervical dislocation, and for tissue harvesting\nCAUTION: Use of an isoflurane flow vaporizer to anesthetize the mice is considered safe when compared to use of ketamine in combination with xylazine, with very short recovery time, minimal stress to the animals, and lower morbidity rates (Woodward et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0034]). However, a high dose of isoflurane can be lethal. Use of isoflurane thus requires proper guidance.\nNOTE: The first M.tb emulsion injection, between the two scapulae, should be SC. Make sure you are experienced and trained in the method of injection ahead of time.\nAcclimate the animals",
    "1. Allow 4 to 6 male or female, 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice acclimate for ≥3 days under standard lighting and temperature conditions of the animal facility, with food and water ad libitum, to eliminate the effects of stress.\nDay 1: First injection\n2. Place a mouse into the induction chamber of the flow vaporizer for isoflurane inhalational anesthesia and allow it to inhale isoflurane until unconscious.\n3. Take mouse out of the chamber and transfer it to the rodent face-mask adaptor.\n4. Sterilize site of injection, between the two scapulae, using alcohol wipes.\n5. Inject 100 µl of 1 mg/ml M.tb emulsion (50 µg M.tb, prepared as in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0004], steps 4 to 12) SC using a 2.5-ml Luer syringe with a 25-G needle and then return animal to its cage.\nOne week after the first injection, local swelling should be visible at the injection site.\nDay 7: Second injection\n6. Prepare buprenorphine at a concentration of 0.015 mg/ml (15 µg/ml) by adding 50 µl of 0.3 mg/ml buprenorphine stock solution to 950 µl PBS.\n7. Place a mouse on digital weighing scale, document animal's weight, and then inject one of the side flanks with buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg (0.05 µg/g) per mouse SC using a 1-ml Luer syringe with a 27-G needle (i.e., for a mouse weight of 25 g, inject 80 µl, which is 1.25 µg buprenorphine). Upon completion, transfer mouse to the induction chamber and allow it to inhale isoflurane until unconscious.\n8. Take mouse out of the chamber and transfer it to mask adaptor.\nTo confirm that the mouse is unconscious, pinch its paw and make sure there is no response.\n9. Sterilize mouse's paw at site of injection using alcohol wipes.",
    "10. Inject 50 µl of 2 mg/ml concentrated M.tb emulsion (from Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0004], steps 13 to 15) IFP, in the mouse's paw (see picture in Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0001]), using a 2.5-ml Luer syringe with a 25-G needle and return animal to its cage.\n11. Continue to administer buprenorphine on a daily basis by repeating steps 6 to 7, omitting the anesthesia.\nAs the IFP injection induces discomfort in the mice, administer buprenorphine daily. The discomfort might also disrupt the mice from reaching the cage water and food, which are usually above the mice. Make sure to lower wet food into the cage every day.\nAfter injecting the buprenorphine daily, return the mouse to its cage as anesthesia is not necessary.\nDay 14: Third injection\n12. Prepare 0.5 mg/ml M.tb solution (60 µl of 10 mg/ml M.tb stock in 1140 µl PBS) as in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0004], steps 16 to 19.\n13. Take a mouse out of the chamber, inject 100 µl of 0.5 mg/ml M.tb solution IP using a 1-ml syringe with a 27-G needle, and return animal to its cage.\nThe third dose of the M.tb booster does not require anesthesia. As there is swelling at the site of the first injection, make sure not to hold the mice by the swollen site.\nSacrifice on day 16\n14. Euthanize mice using either CO2 asphyxiation (<20% displacement/min) or cervical dislocation.\n15. Harvest tissues.\nDifferent tissues, such as BM, blood, and spleen, can be collected for further analysis and/or experiments. Tissues should be harvested immediately or as soon as possible after euthanasia of mice, preferably under sterile conditions.\nFor spleen harvest and preparation of a single-cell suspension, see Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0007].",
    "Depending on the specific research question, different methodologies can be applied to the tissues. To further quantify cell subpopulations and characterize MDSC levels and phenotype, refer to the Current Protocols article by Reuven et al. (2022a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0040]). To further characterize suppressive features and functions, refer to the parallel Current Protocols article by Reuven et al. (2022b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0041]).",
    "The mouse model presented in the Basic Protocol is ideal when a strong systemic inflammatory immune response accompanied by large numbers of highly suppressive MDSCs is desired (see Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0002] and Understanding Results). However, for some studies, when assessing the effects of therapeutic modalities, the robust inflammation and elevated levels of MDSCs could mask differences in the in vivo phenotypes that would otherwise be measurable. With the purpose of reducing the immune response and the severity of the associated inflammation and immune suppression, it is possible to alter the third step within this model and thereby cause a milder inflammation.\nCarry out the Basic Protocol with the following change: Perform the second injection (step 10 in the Basic Protocol) SC in one of the side flanks of each mouse instead of IFP (see Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0003] for a timeline of the model). As in the Basic Protocol, inject 50 µl M.tb emulsion. Note that the side-flank injection does not require analgetic drug administration. Altering the site of injection from the footpad to the side flank induces lower splenic MDSC accumulation than that observed in the original model. The inflammation is accompanied by an increase in BM and spleen MDSC percentages (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0003] and 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0003], respectively), and although milder than the IFP model in the Basic Protocol, downregulated expression of T-cell CD247 is still observed (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0003]). This suggests that by changing the site of immunization, the level of immune suppression can be lowered as compared to the robust suppression found in the original model.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8ea639b9-4b7f-453c-80ed-12b6125ff28c/cpz1558-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

    "The in vivo immune-suppressive state of the mice (Basic Protocol) can be evaluated by introducing the immune system to a challenge and measuring the corresponding response. Such responses to challenges include cell-based immune reactions such as the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (Song et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0028]), in vivo killing (Sade-Feldman et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0023]; Vaknin et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0030]), recovery from viral infection (Bronstein-Sitton et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0005]), and proliferation of T cells in response to a known antigen (described herein).",
    "Assessment of T-cell proliferation in vivo in an antigen-specific manner is based on use of transgenic CD8+OT-I+ T cells expressing the Vα2 Vβ5 chains, comprising a T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes ovalbumin (OVA) peptide (OVA257-264) in the context of H2Kb (MHC class I) (Hogquist et al., 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0014]). Immunization with a viral vector coding for OVA is performed by an intradermal injection into the mouse ear pinnae, which is a highly efficient vaccination method (Lin, Smith, & Tscharke, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0016]). Such an immunization is designed to induce expression of the foreign OVA protein and in vivo presentation of the OVA peptide by infected cells. Whereas adoptive transfer of OT-I+ T cells into control-immunized recipient mice will result in these cells’ activation and proliferation, their transfer into chronically inflamed immunized mice will result in these cells’ suppression and an inability of these cells to proliferate. This will indicate that the in vivo immune-suppressive environment generated during chronic inflammation inhibits the activation and proliferation of the transplanted T cells, as shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0004]. Assessment of T-cell proliferation is carried out by a) labeling splenocytes with CFSE cell proliferation dye prior to the adoptive transfer and b) tracking proliferating cells after the adoptive transfer, as indicated by decay of their fluorescence intensity. A labeled cell that divides will give rise to two daughter cells that will have roughly half of the fluorescence of the original mother cell. Thus, the meaning of a sample with a high percentage of cells exhibiting low fluorescence compared to another sample with a lower percentage of cells displaying the same fluorescence intensity is that the first sample has higher proliferation rates.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/da394f87-eb5f-4fae-9430-321f48eb54cb/cpz1558-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

Prepare 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 60 µl of the sonicated M.tb and keep at −20°C.\nAs the powdery M.tb is not fully soluble, be sure to resuspend the M.tb while aliquoting into each of 4 to 5 tubes.\nEach aliquot is sufficient for injection into roughly 10 mice.\nPreparation of M.tb-IFA emulsion for the first injection\n4. Add 540 µl sterile PBS to a thawed aliquot from step 3. Vortex briefly.\nBy adding the 540 µl PBS to the 60 µl of stock solution (10 mg/ml), a concentration of 1 mg/ml is achieved.\nSteps 4 to 12 provide instructions for the preparation of M.tb-IFA emulsion for the first injection, as in the Basic Protocol, Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0002], and Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0003].

Briefly spin down sonicated M.tb tube.\n7. Aspirate the M.tb solution into a 2.5-ml syringe and discard air bubbles.\n8. Aspirate an equal amount of IFA into another 2.5-ml syringe and discard air bubbles.\n9. Connect M.tb solution syringe to the female-to-female Luer adaptor and gently press plunger to remove air from the adaptor. Then, connect IFA syringe to the other side.\n10. Making sure that the syringes are tightly connected to the adaptor, press down one of the plungers on the work surface to transfer the liquid to the other syringe. Repeat process 10 to 15 times, alternating between the syringes.\nThe liquids should mix and emulsify into a white compound.",
    "11. Disconnect syringe containing the emulsion and connect a 25-G needle. Dispense one drop of emulsion into a petri dish containing a small amount of PBS. If the drop retains its shape, proceed to using emulsion, which is stable and ready. If the drop disseminates into the PBS, reconnect syringe to the adaptor and repeat mixing solution as in step 10.\n12. Use emulsion immediately and make fresh for every use.\nEmulsification is a process that can be challenging at first. To achieve a homogenous and stable emulsion and eliminate person-to-person variations, we created a metal female-to-female Luer adaptor made from two metal needles soldered together (see Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0005]). If creating such an adaptor is not feasible, a four-way stopcock (e.g., Masterflex, Thermo, cat. no. 30600-04) can be used.\nPreparation of M.tb-IFA emulsion for the second injection\n13. Add 480 µl (not 540 µl) PBS to one thawed M.tb aliquot from step 3 for a total volume of 540 µl (not 600 µl).

As the instructions for the emulsion preparation below are for 2 mg/ml M.tb and the injected volume is 50 µl and not 100 µl as in the first injection, one frozen aliquot contains an M.tb amount that is sufficient for the injection of up to five mice. Note that the preparation instructions require two frozen aliquots.\n14. Add the 540 µl to another 60-µl thawed M.tb aliquot to reach a 2 mg/ml concentration, for a total volume of 600 µl. Vortex briefly.\n15. Sonicate and emulsify according to steps 5 to 12.\nPreparation of M.tb solution for the third injection",
    "16. Add 540 µl PBS to a thawed M.tb aliquot from step 3. Vortex briefly.\nBy adding the 540 µl of PBS to the 60 µl of the stock solution (10 mg/ml) from the freezer, a concentration of 1 mg/ml is achieved.\nSteps 16 to 19 are instructions for the preparation of soluble M.tb for the third injection as in the Basic Protocol, Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0002], and Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0003].

    "Lentiviral vectors for Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0003] are produced by HEK-293T cells co-transfected with the ovalbumin vector plasmid together with the packaging and envelope plasmids. The protocol below includes instructions for working with HEK-293T under cell culture conditions and for preparing lentiviral vectors by transfection of these cells. The transfection method for plasmid delivery is performed using the Mirus Bio Transfection Reagent following the manufacturer's instructions and is described briefly here.

    "1. Pre-warm two 15-ml tubes containing 10 ml complete RPMI growth medium in a 37°C water bath.\n2. Take a vial of frozen HEK-293T cells from liquid nitrogen and immediately partially thaw vial in the water bath. Decontaminate vial using 70% ethanol.\n3. Quickly transfer cells into the pre-warmed complete RPMI growth medium from step 1 with a sterile pipet.\nIf the cells are still frozen, to accelerate the thawing process, you may aspirate ∼300 µl warm medium from one of the 15-ml tubes, transfer it to the frozen vial, and then transfer the cells.\n4. Centrifuge 5 min at 400 × g at room temperature in a swinging-bucket centrifuge.\n5. Discard cells’ supernatant and resuspend cells in the other pre-warmed 10 ml complete RPMI growth medium.\n6. Transfer the 10 ml resuspended cells to a 10-cm tissue culture plate and incubate overnight in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nDay 2: Replace complete RPMI growth medium for HEK-293T cells\n7. Pre-warm a 15-ml tube containing 10 ml complete RPMI growth medium in a 37°C water bath.\n8. Examine HEK-293T cells from the previous day under a tissue culture inverted microscope.\nSome cells should be in suspension, whereas others should adhere to the plate surface.\n9. Aspirate and discard supernatant from the plate from step 6 and add the new pre-warmed complete RPMI growth medium from step 7.",
    "HEK-293T cells will easily detach from the surface of the growth plate in the case of any disturbance. For example, if the complete RPMI growth medium is added on top of the cells and/or if the temperature of the added media is lower than ∼30°C, this may occur. To avoid such disturbance when replacing the medium, use pre-warmed medium and tilt the plate to a 60° angle before adding the medium to the side of the tilted plate.\n10. Return plate to the incubator for overnight incubation.\nDay 3: Subculturing (or passaging) cells\n11. Examine HEK-293T cells from the previous day under a tissue culture inverted microscope.\nMost of the cells should now adhere to the plate surface. If the cells are more than 80% to 90% confluent, continue to the next steps. Otherwise, return the cells to the incubator and wait until the next day.\n12. Pre-warm a 15-ml tube containing 0.5 ml trypsin-EDTA solution and another two tubes each containing 10 ml complete RPMI growth medium in a 37°C water bath.\n13. Aspirate and discard cells’ supernatant and add the pre-warmed trypsin-EDTA. Tilt plate from side to side to enable equal distribution of the solution.\n14. Incubate for 5 min in the incubator.\n15. Set a 1-ml pipettor to 400 µl, tilt plate to a 60° angle, and wash cells down by aspirating the liquid from the bottom of the tilted plate and dispensing it at the top.\n16. Transfer a volume of 100 µl of suspended cells into each of the tubes with pre-warmed complete RPMI growth medium from step 12.\n17. Transfer the 10 ml from each of the two tubes to two new 10-cm tissue culture plates and return cells to the incubator.",
    "18. Continue to grow cells and split them when they reach 80% to 90% confluence.\nSubculturing of cells is a procedure that enables further work with a cell line by dividing the growing cells into new plates with fresh complete RPMI growth medium. After dividing the cells, one plate can be used for an experiment, whereas the other is used for continuation of the cells’ growth in culture.\nIt is advised not to keep passaging the cells for >1 month. We thus strongly recommend making a few aliquots of cells and keeping them in liquid nitrogen. This way, each experiment can begin with a fresh cell culture made from a frozen stock from the same stage. For more information about how to efficiently freeze cells, refer to the Current Protocols article by Sandell & Sakai (2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0026]).\nDay 5: Seeding of a HEK-293T plate for transfection\n19. Take one plate of HEK-293T cells out of incubator and detach cells using trypsin-EDTA solution as in steps 12 to 15.\n20. Bring cells to a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml in pre-warmed complete RPMI growth medium and seed 10 ml in a 10-cm tissue culture plate.\n21. Mark plate so as not to confuse it with other HEK-293T plates in the incubator and incubate plate overnight.\nDay 6: Transfection\n22. Pre-warm complete RPMI growth medium. Four hours before transfection, replace growth medium of the cells with 10 ml pre-warmed medium.\nFor optimal transfection, the cells should be 80% to 90% confluent and equally distributed in a monolayer on the growth plate surface. If the cells did not reach such conditions, it is better to wait another day.\n23. Take TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent out of the 4°C refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature.",
    "24. Create the following mixture of plasmids in a sterile 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube:\n1500 µl Opti-MEM\n6 µg vector plasmid (6 µl of 1 mg/ml DNA)\n3 µg env plasmid (3 µl of 1 mg/ml DNA)\n3 µg packaging plasmid (3 μl of 1 mg/ml DNA).\n25. Add 45 µl TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent to the plasmid/Opti-MEM mixture and pipet gently with a 1-ml pipettor to mix completely.\n26. Incubate mixture for 20 min at room temperature.\nThe transfection reagent mixture with plasmids is now ready.\n27. Gently aspirate and discard 1.5 ml growth medium from the cells from step 22. Add plasmid/TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent mixture prepared in steps 24 to 26 to the cultured cells in a dropwise manner.\nAvoid adding the mixture from high above, as this may form a crater-like pits in the cells’ monolayer and will disrupt the efficiency of transfection.\n28. Incubate plate for 48 hr.\nDay 8 (48 hr post-transfection): First collection of medium containing viral particles\n29. Take plate of transfected cells out of the incubator and transfer supernatant (which contains the viral particles) to a new sterile 15-ml tube. Filter through a 0.45-µm syringe filter. Store collected supernatant at 4°C until step 31.\n30. Add 10 ml pre-warmed complete RPMI growth medium to the cells and return plate to the incubator for an additional 24 hr.\nAs in previous steps, when adding the medium, pre-warm the medium to 37°C and tilt the plate to a 60° angle.\nDay 9 (72 hr post-transfection): Second collection of medium containing viral particles and concentration to a concentrated viral stock\n31. Collect growth medium from the cells and filter through a 0.45-µm syringe filter. Add it to supernatant from the previous day (see step 29).",
    "32. Transfer virus-containing supernatant to the upper part of a centrifugal filter unit and centrifuge for 10 min at 1000 × g, 4°C, in a microcentrifuge.\n33. Discard flow-through (from the bottom part of the tube) and top up upper part of the centrifugal filter unit with more supernatant.\n34. Repeat steps 31 to 33 until volume of the supernatant is 100 to 250 µl.\nEach centrifugation round may take longer as more supernatant is filtered.\nThe concentrated supernatant should become dense due to the high content of serum-derived proteins.\n35. Without touching the filter's membrane, aspirate the 100 to 250 µl of the concentrated supernatant that is above the filter and transfer it to a new sterile 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n36. Add 250 µl PBS to top part of the filter unit and gently pipet the PBS onto the filter. Transfer PBS and any leftover liquid to the sterile tube with concentrated supernatant from step 35.\n37. Mix concentrated medium with PBS well by pipetting until fully homogenized.\n38. Divide homogenized solution into 50-µl aliquots in sterile 0.2-ml PCR tubes. Keep aliquots in a –80°C freezer.\nTypically, from one 10-cm plate of transfected cells and a volume of collected medium of 20 ml (as the supernatant is collected twice, at days 8 and 9), we usually obtain 7 to 10 tubes of concentrated viral stock. We usually obtain 1–3 × 108 TU/ml, and therefore, each viral aliquot of 50 µl contains approximately 0.02–0.06 × 108 TU. The quantification of viral particles is detailed in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0006]. As lentiviral titer will decrease during freeze-thaw cycles, we recommend freezing all the aliquots and quantifying viral particles in thawed aliquots as instructed in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-prot-0006].

Trypan blue stains dead cells a faint blue, allowing one to distinguish between live and dead cells (Louis & Siegel, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-bib-0017]).\n2. In a new 15-ml tube, prepare CFSE mixture by diluting CFSE cell proliferation dye in PBS to a concentration of 5 × 10-6 M (5 μM).",
    "Our CFSE stock aliquots are dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 25 mM and kept in a −20°C freezer in 5-µl aliquots. To prepare the CFSE mixture, we recommend preparing a middle dilution. To do so, first dilute the CFSE stock solution by adding it to PBS at a 1:100 ratio (i.e., add 5 µl of 25 mM CFSE to 500 µl PBS). To achieve 5 × 10-6 M, add 200 µl of the 1:100-diluted CFSE to 9.8 ml PBS. We recommend not re-freezing the CFSE stock.\n3. Mix cells with the CFSE solution at a 1:1 ratio (i.e., 1 ml of cells with 1 ml of 5 μM CFSE) and incubate in a 37°C water bath for 10 min. Gently shake tube every 2 min to ensure homogeneity of the cell solution.\nBy mixing 1:1, the final concentration for CFSE labeling is 2.5 μM and the final cell concentration is 10 × 106 cells/ml.\nAfter labeling, do not expose cells to direct light.\n4. Add 1 volume of filtered HI-FBS to cells and incubate at room temperature for 1 min (i.e., if 1 ml cells was mixed with 1 ml CFSE, add 2 ml HI-FBS).\n5. Top up cells’ tube with PBS and centrifuge for 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C, in a swinging-bucket centrifuge. Discard supernatant.\n6. Resuspend cells in 10 ml PBS and count cells with trypan blue using a hemocytometer.\nCells are stained and ready for further use.\nAs CFSE labeling can be toxic for cells, it is expected that roughly 20% of the cells will be lost in the labeling process. Figure 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.558#cpz1558-fig-0004] demonstrates total spleen cells before and after CFSE staining."
