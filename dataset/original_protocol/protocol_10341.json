    "NOTE: This protocol describes the use of a back-pressure assisted robotic dispensing system (Figure 1A) as a surface etching (Figure 1B) and extrusion-based bioprinter (Figure 1C)10.\n1. Modification of a Polystyrene Surface\nUse 1 mm polystyrene sheets since polystyrene tissue culture plates tend to bow upwards in the center, ruining the height consistency of both etching and printing.\n\tNOTE: As the polystyrene sheets are not modified for cell adhesion, plasma treatment is performed.\nOxygen plasma treatment.\n\t\nFirst, select a pressure of 2 bar on the regulator of the oxygen cylinder connected to the plasma machine. Then switch the plasma machine on and input the following conditions into the machine's control panel: 150 W, 30 sscm of oxygen, 10 min (for power, gas flow and time respectively).\nPlace the polystyrene substrate into the plasma chamber, seal the door and press the start button on the control panel. Soak the oxygen plasma treated polystyrene substrate in fetal bovine serum and incubate at 37 °C for 2 hr before washing three times 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n2. Programming Print Patterns\nUse the Program to First Etch the Surface with a Stylus or Scalpel.\n\t\nWhen using a stylus, insert a 1.5 mm diameter textile needle (from the inside with great care) into the nozzle of a dispensing syringe (either 5 or 10 ml) until it becomes wedged and secured. If using a scalpel, choose a round handled scalpel so that it may be fastened into the clamp mechanism of the printing arm.\n\t\tNOTE: The stylus etches curved patterns better than the scalpel blade.\nWhen first attempting to create a bioprinted arrangement, sketch the desired pattern on graph paper with numbered axes to generate the X-Y coordinates. Then, input the coordinates of etched/bioprinted pattern into the spreadsheet software (Figure 2).",
    "NOTE: The \"desired pattern\" can be in many shapes such as linear, S-shaped, or circular. The choice depends on the experimental model required, such as parallel linear lines for the differentiation of MSCs to cardiomyocytes as demonstrated here. The scatter graph function allows the visualization of the proposed plot pattern.\nOpen the print/dispensing software. Select \"Program > Add Program\" followed by \"Edit > Add Point\" to set up the program. Export the x and y coordinate values obtained from the spreadsheet into the print/dispensing software using the \"Copy and Paste\" function.\nCalibrate the \"z\" height of the robot before each run in order to place the stylus/print nozzle onto the surface.\n\t\t\nIn the print/dispensing software, select the \"Robot\" option, click on \"Changing Mode\" and enable the \"Teaching mode\" option. Once selected, the software enables the \"Jog\" function of the robot.\nTo Jog, first initialize the robot to its default position by selecting the following commands from the menu bar; \"Robot > Meca Initialize\", then select \"Robot > Jog\". Input the numerical values (in mm) in the \"X and Y slots\" required to place the stylus exactly on the origin of the pattern.\nNext, input a numerical value (in mm) in the \"Z slot\" to place the stylus or printing nozzle in contact with the surface but not flex or indent the surface. This point is designated as \"Z\" starting value.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The depth of each groove can be varied easily using the Z-height of the system. Grooves of 40, 80, and 170 µm are demonstrated to cut into the surface of 1 mm thick polystyrene sheets (Figure 4 and Table 1).",
    "Select the print instruction for each of the coordinate points, i.e., \"Start of Line Dispense\" to define the first point and print initiation, \"Line Passing\" to designate the intermediate points and \"End of Line Dispense\" to signal to the robot to terminate the print run.\nCommunicate the program to the robot by selecting the follow commands from the top menu bar: \"Robot > Send C&T Data\".\nInitiate the etching/print run, by changing the robot to the \"Run\" mode. Do this by selecting \"Robot > Changing Mode > Switch Run Mode\" from the top menu bar.\nStart the printing procedure by pressing the green \"start button\" on the robot dispenser console.\n3. Preparation and Printing of Cell-containing Gelatin Bioink\nDissolve 2% gelatin in Minimum Essential Medium Alpha Medium (αMEM) (supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% antibiotic/antimycotic) at 60 °C for 2 hr to prepare the bioink solutions.\nPre-culture the Red Fluorescent Protein expressing Mesenchymal Stem Cells (RFP-MSCs) to 70% confluence in 10 cm tissue culture dishes using αMEM/10% FBS. Release the attached cells into suspension by removing the medium and coating with 1x trypsin-EDTA solution for 5 min at 37 °C.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 ml of 1x PBS and count the cell density using a hemocytometer.\nAfter allowing the bioink to cool to room temperature, gently mix in a sufficient volume to the suspension of RFP-MSCs in the bioink to achieve a final concentration of 5 x 106 cells ml−1.\nPour the cell bearing bioink into a printing syringe with the nozzle sealed. Chill the loaded syringe to 4 °C in order to attain a printable viscosity.",
    "Place the loaded syringe on the automated robotic dispensing system and attach the air pressure lines. Remove the syringe Luer seal and attach the print nozzle.\nExtrude the cellularized bioinks into thin lines using 0.05 MPa back pressure, at 5 mm/sec writing speed from a 10 ml syringe via a 27 G needle/nozzle (tapered recommended over cylindrical) onto a polystyrene film surface, following the pre-programmed deposition pattern described in Step 2.1 to place the cellularized bioink onto the pre-etched grooves.\nAfter 1 hr incubation at room temperature, add 10 ml growth media (supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics) and incubate the cells for 24 hr (to allow the cells to sense and react to the etched features) before viewing using an inverted fluorescence microscope at 10X magnification.\nSubscription Required.
