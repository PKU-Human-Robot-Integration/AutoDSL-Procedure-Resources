    "1. Expression and Purification of Cerulean\nNote: This is based on the protocol published by Lelimousin et al.21\nExpress His-tagged Cerulean in Escherichia coli BL21 cells grown at 37 °C in 4 L of auto inducible medium23 until OD600=1 and then incubate overnight at 27 °C.\nHarvest the bacterial cells at 5,000 x g and lyse the cells via sonication (40%, 5 min, 10 s pulse, 10 s pause) in 200 mL of buffer comprised of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 1x EDTA-free protease inhibitors.\nLoad the supernatant on a His-trap Ni-NTA column and elute Cerulean with 100 mM imidazole in the same buffer conditions.\nPool the bright yellow colored fractions. The protein is intrinsically colored, hence the Cerulean-containing fractions are easily distinguishable.\nPurify the protein (4 mL) on an S75 column in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0.\nPool the bright yellow fractions and concentrate the protein solution to 15 mg/mL.\n2. Crystallization\nUse the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique24 at 20 °C in Linbro plates. Fill the wells with 1 mL of a precipitant solution consisting of 100 mM HEPES at pH 6.75, 12% PEG8000 and 100 mM MgCl2. For the hanging drops, mix 1 µL of protein concentrated to 15 mg/mL with 1 µL of precipitant solution. Crystals should appear in 24 h.\nHarvest the crystals obtained and transfer them to 100 µL of a seeding buffer comprised of 0.1 M HEPES pH 6.75, 22% PEG 8000.\nGrind the crystals with a 0.1 mL tissue grinder and dilute in seeding buffer (ratio 1:100).\nDigest an aliquot of the protein stock solution (15 mg/mL) with trypsin (0.5 mg/mL in the same buffer) for 1 h (1:10 (v/v)).\nMix the digested protein solution with 10% of seed-containing buffer (v/v).",
    "Grow crystals (10*10*20 µm3) in 0.1 M HEPES pH 7, 14% PEG 8000, 0.1 MgCl2 in 1-1.5 μL hanging drops using the vapor diffusion method.\n3. Crystal Mounting\nUse a suitable loop, e.g., a mesh loop 700 square holes of 25 µm each mounted on a SPINE standard sample holder25. Transfer crystals from the crystallization drop (Step 2.6) into 1 µL of cryoprotectant solution (the well precipitant solution mixed with glycerol (20% v/v final)).\nMount the protein crystal slurry onto a mesh loop by moving the loop under the crystals and lifting them out of the drop. Ideally the crystals should be in the size range of 5 µm – 30 µm in maximum dimension with no overlap between crystals mounted in the loop.\nWick off excess liquid by touching the mount quickly with filter paper. Sediment the crystals so that they sit in the plane of the loop surrounded by as little bulk liquid as possible.\nPlunge the mount into a unipuck full of liquid nitrogen. Store the puck at 100 K in a suitable storage container until beam time is available.\n4. Offline preparation of the synchrotron experiment\nNote: Request synchrotron beam time as early as possible and follow the online guidelines for available access types and on how to submit an application for a given synchrotron. The ESRF guidelines can be found at http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/UserGuide/Applying. If a member of an ESRF Block Allocation Group (BAG), an application for each specific project is not required. In this case experimenters should approach their BAG Responsible concerning the scheduling of beam time.",
    "After the proposal is accepted and an invitation for the experiment is received, have all participants complete safety training. Fill in the “A-form” (via the ESRF user portal, http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/UserGuide/Preparing/new-a-form) with the required safety information on the samples. Contact the local contact person to discuss the experiment. Once your A-form is submitted and validated it will give you the experiment number and password.\nConnect to extended ISPyB26 (http://www.esrf.fr/) and choose MX.\nLog in with the experiment number and the password from the A-form.\nSelect Shipment | Add New and fill in the requested information.\nSelect Add Parcel and fill in the relevant data. Select Add Container, choose a unipuck and fill in the information required, including the positions of the sample holders in the puck.\n5. Loading of the Sample onto a Beamline\nIn the experimental hutch, load the puck into the sample changer (SC) dewar and note its position.\nInterlock the experimental cabin and enter the control hutch.\nLog in to the ISPyB (https://esrf.fr/). Select Prepare Experiment, find the shipment, select Next and indicate the beamline and the puck position in the SC.\nLog in into the beamline control software, here MXCuBE227,28 with the experimental number and password provided on the A-form.\n\t\nPress Sync to synchronize the beamline control software with the ISPyB database.\nUse the beamline control software, to mount the sample holder onto the goniometer. In MXCuBE2, right click a position in the sample changer area and select Mount Sample.\nTaking advantage of the MK3 mini-kappa goniometer29 installed at most of the ESRF MX beamlines, use MXCuBE2’s “visual realignment” workflow30 to align the plane of the sample holder with the rotation axis of the goniometer.",
    "Select the Centre button, then 3-click center on the middle of the edge of the tip of the loop. Save the centered position by selecting Save.\nClick again on the Centre button, then 3-click center the middle of the start of the stem of the loop. Save the second position as well by clicking on Save.\nSelect one of the saved centered positions by clicking on it.\nUnder Advanced, add the workflow Visual Reorientation to the MxCuBE2 data collection queue.\nLaunch the workflow by clicking on Collect Queue.\nAfter the workflow aligns the plane of the sample holder with the rotation axis of the goniometer, center the sample holder again, this time somewhere in the middle of the mesh.\nOrient the sample holder so that the face of the mesh is perpendicular to the X-ray beam direction by rotating the omega axis using MXCuBE2.\nIn MXCuBE2, select the beam size required for the scanning of the sample holder (only for beamlines with variable beam size).\n\t\nClick on the aperture drop down menu in the beamline control software and select a value, e.g., 10 µm.\nDefine a mesh for the mesh scan.\n\t\nClick on the mesh tool icon in MXCuBE2. The mesh tool window will appear.\nIn the sample view of MXCuBE2, draw the mesh by left clicking and dragging the mouse over the area containing crystals on the sample holder.\nTo save the mesh click on the Plus button in the mesh tool window (mesh becomes green).\n6. Prepare and Execute the MeshAndCollect Workflow\nIn the Resolution field of MXCuBE2, enter the resolution (dmin) at which diffraction images should be collected, e.g., here 1.8 Å.\nSelect MeshAndCollect in the Advanced data collection tab, add it to the queue and click Collect the Queue.",
    "In the parameter window which appears, use the beamline dependent default parameters. In the experiment described here defaults parameters are 0.037 s exposure time per mesh scan point, 100% transmission (leading in this case to 4 x 1011 ph/s), 1° oscillation per mesh scan line.\nClick Continue. The mesh scan runs and the diffraction images collected at each grid point are analyzed and ranked according to diffraction strength with the software DOZOR1. This process runs in the background.\nAfter the DOZOR analysis a heat map is generated and the order for subsequent partial data collections is assigned automatically based on diffraction strength (see Figure 1).\n\tNote: The results of this step can also be inspected in ISPyB. For the collection of partial data sets a new tab with settings pops up in the beamline control software, select suitable values for rotation range (i.e., 0.1°), number of images (i.e., 100), exposure time, resolution, transmission, inverse beam etc. Ideally the dose for each wedge to be collected should be below the Garman limit (30 MGy). The approximate exposure time per image is 0.037 s to 0.1 s in the described experimental conditions.\nClick Continue to launch the partial data collections.\n7. Data Processing\nNote: The partial data sets are integrated with a suitable program (XDS10). For this a Python script will be used that recognizes each individual data set, integrates it and makes sure that indexing between the different partial data sets is consistent.\nOpen the folder containing the images: /data/visitor/mxXXXX/beamline_name/date/RAW_DATA/Cerulean.\nMake a safety copy of the process subfolder that can be found in the folder where the partial data sets are collected.\n\t\nOn the Linux terminal, use the command cp –r process process_backup.\nNavigate into the process folder and launch the processing script.",
    "On the Linux terminal, type the command cd process and hit enter.\nType procMultiCrystalData and hit enter.\n\t\tNote: The script will ask for a space group and cell parameters (this information is optional), enter those according to the instructions. After a last user confirmation, the script will run automatically.\n8. Merging of Data Sets\nNote: After all partial data sets are integrated the best combination of them are merged to produce the final data set for use in structure determination and refinement. Different aims of this merging process can be to obtain full completeness (highly recommended), high multiplicity or the best data statistics (high <I/σ(I)>, low R-factors, etc.). The latter can sometimes be at the expense of completeness and/or multiplicity so this option should be chosen with care.\nMerge the partial data sets using the program ccCluster14. It uses Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) to determine possible combinations of isomorphous partial data sets ().\n\t\nType ccCluster in the Unix terminal to open its graphical user interface (GUI).\n\t\tNote: In the ccCluster GUI a dendrogram is drawn. This gives a suggestion as to which partial data sets might be best merged based on isomorphism between them.\nClick on a node that corresponds to a value of about 0.4 on the vertical axis. Generally, higher values will include more partial data sets but lead to worse merging statistics as partial data sets will be less isomorphous.",
    "Click on MERGE DATA. The selected cluster will be processed in the background and the estimated merging statistics will appear in a new tab in the GUI. This step can be repeated for different combinations of data sets. For a good combination of partial data sets the completeness should be close to 100%, the <I/σ(I)> values high (10 or higher in the lowest resolution shell) and the R-meas31 values low (around 5% in the low resolution shell).\nFor each combination selected use the generated input script to merge the partial data sets chosen into a single mtz file (i.e., pointless32).\nDefinitively scale and merge the intensity data in this file using a scaling program (i.e., aimless32) and, as with a file originating from a single crystal data collection, use the output for subsequent phasing and structure solution33."
