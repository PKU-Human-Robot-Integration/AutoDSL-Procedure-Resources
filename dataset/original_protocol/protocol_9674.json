    "For the present study, eNpHR2.0 transgenic line w[*]; P{y[+t7.7] w[+mC]=UAS-eNpHR-YFP}attP2, ReaChR transgenic line w[*];P{y[+t7.7] w[+mC]=UAS-ReaChR}su(Hw)attP5/CyO, and heart-specific GAL4 driver containing Hand gene regulatory fragment w[1118]; P{y[+t7.7] w[+mC]=GMR88D05-GAL4}attP2/TM3 Sb[1] (this driver stock will be indicated as Hand-GAL4) were used. y[*] w[*]; P{w[+mC]=UAS-2xEGFP}AH3 was used as the GFP reporter line. The mentioned Drosophila stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC, see Table of Materials) and maintained at room temperature or at 18 °C on standard cornmeal media. The Drosophila models developed in this study are available upon request for collaborative work.\n1. Drosophila genetic crosses and media preparation\nChange the 3rd chromosome balancer TM3 Sb[1] to TM6 Sb Tb,creating w[1118]; P{y[+t7.7] w[+mC]=GMR88D05-GAL4}attP2/TM6 Sb Tb (Hand-GAL4/TM6 Sb Tb). See Supplementary Figure 1 for the crossing scheme. Set crosses in vials with regular cornmeal media.\n\tNOTE: The presence of a Tb marker allows users to distinguish larvae and pupae containing opsin transgene and the GAL4 driver from animals containing opsin but no driver25.\nKeep the genetic crosses in a 25 °C, 70% humidity incubator on specially formulated all-trans retinaI (ATR)-containing media (see Table of Materials) in the dark for 5 days for larvae collection and 6 days for pupae collection.\nCombine five Hand-GAL4 /TM6 Sb Tb virgin females and two to three males from UAS-opsin stocks (eNpHR2.0, or ReaChR) per vial. See the cross diagram for eNpHR2.0 and ReaChR opsin in Figure 2A and Figure 2B, respectively.\nOn the next day, prepare ATR-containing media vials.\n\t\nPrepare Semi-Defined Food according to the instructions of BDSC26. Instead of sucrose and glucose, add only sucrose (5.14 g/100 mL). Cool to ~60 °C with constant stirring.\nPrepare narrow fly vials, and add 50 µL of 100 mM ATR-ethanol solution to each vial.",
    "Using a serological pipette, dispose of fly food to narrow fly vials, 5 mL per vial. Vortex at maximum speed for 10 s.\nPlug the vials, and wrap them in the dark fabric to protect them from light. Let vials dry for at least 12 h (overnight).\nThe next day, transfer the flies steadily laying eggs from Step 1.3. to the vials with ATR-containing food (Step 1.4.4.). Protect the racks with vials from light.\nAfter 24-48 h (depending on the number of eggs laid), discard the parents to prevent vial over-population.\nCollect non-Tb progeny and use them for heart imaging.\n\t​NOTE: The phenotypic differences at the larval and pupal stages are demonstrated in Figure 2C. The summary and the approximate timeline of the specimen preparation steps are shown in Figure 3.\n2. Optogenetic control of the Drosophila heart\nPick UAS-opsin/Hand-GAL4 larva/pupa from the vial (Step 1.7.), put on tissue, and gently wipe off the media from the body surface using a painting brush.\nPrepare the microscope slide and place a small piece of double-sided tape in the middle.\nUsing a brush or fine tweezers, gently place the larva/pupa on the tape surface with the dorsal side up and perpendicular to the long side of the slide. Apply gentle pressure to attach the larva/pupa to the tape surface.\nSet up the slide on the imaging stage, larva/pupa facing down.\nTurn on the OCT light source by laser control software (see Table of Materials). Open the custom-written SD-OCT control software, then click on the Preview window.\nSet the scan parameters in the SD-OCT software.",
    "NOTE: The goal is to align the sample for optimal imaging of the beating heart, so selecting the X range and Y range covers the heart's region. At this step, both the number of A-scans and B-scans are 400. The range in the x and y directions is ~490 µm and ~537 µm, showing the heart's two orthogonal cross-sections (xz and yz), respectively.\nUse micromanipulators to control the sample stage to bring the fly heart into focus. Adjust the focal position to minimize light reflection from the fly cuticle surface. Consider applying mineral oil on the larva/pupa surface to minimize reflection.\n\tNOTE: Oil may increase the risk of animal movement by compromising the tape adhesive properties.\nEnsure that the fly heart can be fully viewed in the image window without any distortions, being blocked out by tissue, and non-negligible shadows and reflections; otherwise, go back to Step 2.7.\nSet the scan parameters for M-mode OCT image acquisition.\n\tNOTE: The number of A-scans is reduced compared to Step 2.7. for the faster frame rate to capture the beating dynamics of the fly heart (several Hz). The number of B-scans denotes the number of repeated frames for M-mode imaging, which can be adjusted based on the recording time and available system memory. In this experiment, 128 A-scans can allow a speed of ~125 frames/s, and 4,000 repeated B-scans are recorded, providing a continuous recording of ~32 s.\nAcquire five sets of control data without red light stimulation pulses to calculate the resting heart rate (RHR).\nDesign the light pulse for the pacing stimulation in the custom OCT control software. In \"Settings\", add the designed light pulse sequences to control pulse frequency, pulse width, stimulation duration, and waiting time according to different stimulation protocols.",
    "NOTE: The RHR is measured from the control experiment without light illumination and used to calculate the frequency at which light should be pulsed for tachypacing and bradypacing experiments22.\nOpen the light controller software (see Table of Materials) to generate red light pulses. Choose the Pulse Mode in \"Mode Selection\". Double-click the figure for the \"Pulse Profile\" settings and choose Follower Mode. Keep the OFF intensity as 0, and set the ON intensity percentage upon calculating the actual power density.\n\tNOTE: Stimulation light pulses are triggered by a signal from the OCT control software according to the settings in Step 2.12.\nAcquire M-mode videos of the beating Drosophila heart with light stimulation by clicking on Acquire in the OCT control software. Repeat the measurements 5x.\n3. Image analysis\nOpen the custom-developed fly heart segmentation software.\nClick on Select File and then select the file to be analyzed in the GUI that appears.\nEnter both the vertical and horizontal boundaries of the heart region in pixels in the top text boxes. Click on Resize. Using the slider on the bottom, ensure that the entire heart region is visible and that it fills up the whole box for the entire collection. If it is not, repeat this process and adjust the boundaries.\nClick on Predict to predict the heart region. The program will now go through every slice in the collection and select the heart region, taking approximately 3 min.\nClick on HR Plot once the prediction is completed. This will open a new window displaying a plot of the heart area over time. Ensure the correct peak or valley areas are selected. Choose Pulse and then HR to generate a final figure, and the functional parameters will be saved in the .csv files simultaneously."
