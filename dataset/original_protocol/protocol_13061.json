    "1. Preparation of transverse rice section\nDe-husk dry, intact kernels as shown in Figure 1A.\n\t\nLoosen the husks and dehull rice kernels by grinding the kernels between two flat rubber stoppers. Remove the husked rice kernels from the panicle, if necessary.\nPlace a single kernel onto a flat rubber stopper on a work bench (Figure 1B). Ensure that this stopper remains stationary.\nUse a second flat rubber stopper (Figure 1C) to abrade the kernel by twisting it in against the first rubber stopper, using sufficient pressure (Figure 1D). Remove husks from the kernel, taking care not to shatter the endosperm. Remove any remaining husk using fine forceps. A de-husked kernel is shown in Figure 1E.\nUsing fine forceps, insert an individual husked kernel into a plastic pipette tip (250 µL size, one seed/tip) (Figure 1F). Ensure that the embryo end of the kernel is facing towards the (conical) end of the pipette tip (Figure 1G).\n\tNOTE: Inserting the kernel this way ensures that the kernel will fit as snugly as possible into the pipette tip as the kernel is narrower towards its proximal end.\nInsert a second 250 µL pipette tip to force the kernel into the pipette tip and to keep the kernel immobile during sectioning, taking care not to damage the kernel or bend the second pipette tip (Figure 1H). The proper ‘telescope’ assemblage is indicated in Figure 1I.\nLay the pipette tip assemblage flat on a work bench and hold in place by hand (Figure 1J). With the other hand, use a sharp scalpel blade (No. 20) to slice through the center of the kernel and cut the end of the pipette tip off (Figure 1K). Using the scalpel cut 1 mm thick sections of the rice kernel (Figure 1L).",
    "NOTE: The kernel section is tightly enclosed within an annulus of plastic (Figure 1M). Mean section thickness for three exemplar genotypes are found in Table 1. Sections significantly thinner than 1 mm will shatter or crumble. It is important to note from what part of the kernel each section originates if this experiment is being performed on several varieties of rice for comparison, as starch morphology does vary throughout the endosperm11.\n2. Reflected light microscopy of transverse rice sections\nUse fine forceps to place the transverse rice sections (prepared in section 1) on a black piece of heavy gauge black paper.\nObtain light images of transverse sections of Nipponbare using a stereomicroscope with mounted goosenecks for oblique illumination, as shown in Figure 1N-S.\nObserve endosperm morphology under at least 10x magnification.\n\tNOTE: Any epilight source is preferable to bright field microscopy as sections obtained using this technique are not thin enough for the light to pass through.\n3. Scanning electron microscopy of transverse rice sections\nPlace the samples onto a carbon disk stuck to an aluminum stub and place onto a charge reduction sample holder. Remove the plastic ring from the pipette tip mount using fine forceps to prevent the plastic from entering the vacuum apparatus of the SEM.\n\tNOTE: Images of endosperm cells, SGs, and subgranules are obtained using a desktop SEM machine that does not require samples to be sputter coated.\nObtain the images using a high sensitivity multi-mode backscatter electron (BSE) detector at 10 kV."
