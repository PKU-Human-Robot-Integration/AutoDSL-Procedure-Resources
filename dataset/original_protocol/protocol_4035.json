    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSection 1: Fixed imaging of individual mRNAs and translation sites\nThis section describes how to collect and fix embryos for detection of SunTag-hb mRNAs and their translation sites using a combination of smFISH and immunofluorescence (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Methods to calculate total mRNA number, the number of mRNAs that are translated, and ribosome number in the translation sites are also described.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/995-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overview of the protocols for visualizing translation sites\nThe steps associated with the detection and analysis of translation sites in fixed and live embryos are shown, with the relevant timings.\nSet up embryo collection cages\nTiming: 1–3 days\nIn this step, flies are crossed to allow the collection of embryos with maternally expressed scFv-mNG and zygotically expressed SunTag-hb.\nCollect virgin females homozygous for the nos-scFv-mNG transgene and males homozygous for the SunTag-hb transgene.\nNote: This cross will produce embryos that zygotically express one copy of SunTag-hb. If visualization of translation of the full complement of mRNAs from both alleles is required, balanced stocks can be generated to allow the collection of embryos that maternally express scFv-mNG and are homozygous for the SunTag-POI transgene/CRISPR modified locus.\nNote: Control embryos can also be collected from stocks carrying only the SunTag-POI or the scFv-FP transgene if required.\nNote: Fly lines maternally expressing scFv-sfGFP and scFv-mScarlet (Dufourt et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) are also available. There are also UASp-scFv-sfGFP (Lu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]) and UASp-scFv-GFP-NLS (Formicola et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) stocks that are compatible with the GAL4/UAS system, allowing translation to be imaged in a cell type specific manner at later developmental stages (Formicola et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nTransfer at least 100 females and 50 males to a collection cage with an apple juice agar plate and yeast paste.",
    "Note: Increasing the number of flies in the collection cage will increase the number of embryos collected.\nCollect and fix embryos\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this step, embryos are collected and fixed for use in smFISH and immunofluorescence to allow SunTag-hb translation sites to be visualized.\nChange the plate on the collection cage to a fresh apple juice agar plate with yeast and collect embryos at 25°C for the desired length of time. For collection of a range of nuclear cycle (nc) 12 – nc14 embryos, let the flies lay embryos for 3 h, then remove the plate and age the embryos for 1 h at 25°C.\nNote: We do not recommend shifting collection temperatures to change the speed of development, because translation is temperature sensitive.\nDechorionate the embryos by applying 50% domestic bleach to the plate and incubating for 2 min.\nTransfer the embryos to a sieve by washing them off the plate with water or embryo washing solution.\nWhen in the sieve, wash thoroughly with water or embryo washing solution until no bleach remains.\nTransfer embryos into a glass scintillation vial containing 3 mL fixing buffer.\nAdd 4 mL heptane and 1 mL formaldehyde and shake at 300 rpm for 20 min.\nRemove the liquid layer at the bottom of the vial with a plastic Pasteur pipette.\nNote: Take care not to lose any embryos while removing the liquid. It is better to retain embryos than to remove all of the liquid layer.\nDevitellinize the embryos.\nAdd 8 mL of methanol to the glass vial.\nShake the vial vigorously for 30 s and vortex for 30 s.\nRemove the liquid and repeat at least twice more until the liquid is clear and has no floating membrane.",
    "Critical: Ensure that the devitellinization step is complete so that the staining and imaging are optimal. Use more methanol washes and shaking if necessary.\nTransfer the embryos in methanol to a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. Remove as much methanol as possible and replace with fresh methanol. Embryos can then be used for smFISH and immunofluorescence or kept in methanol at −20°C.\nPause point: Embryos can be kept at −20°C for at least three months without a reduction in the quality of the smFISH and immunofluorescence staining.\nNote: Depending on the number of flies in the collection cage and the efficiency of laying, embryo collections may need to be carried out on multiple days to collect enough embryos for smFISH and immunofluorescence.\nsmFISH and immunofluorescence\nTiming: 3 days\nIn this step, embryos are stained with SunTag smFISH probes to recognize individual mRNAs and an anti-mNeonGreen antibody to identify the scFv-mNG signal (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Steps are performed at 20oC unless stated otherwise.\nDay 1:\nPrepare the SunTag smFISH probes (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_995_5.csv\nReconstitute the lyophilized probes in 400μL RNase-free TE and mix by pipetting. This will produce a probe stock with a concentration of 12.5μM.\nMake 20μL aliquots of the dissolved probes. Store at −20°C and protect from the light.\nTransfer the embryos to a glass V-Vial using a pipette with a cut tip. A volume of 50 μL of embryos per stain is optimal because some embryos are lost throughout the staining process.\nPerform washes with 500 μL of the following solutions.\nRock in 50:50 methanol:PBT (1 × PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) for 5 min.\nRock in PBT for 10 min. Repeat 3 more times.\nRock in 50% PBT, 50% Stellaris wash buffer for 10 min.\nRock twice in Stellaris wash buffer for 5 min.",
    "Add 500 μL Stellaris wash buffer and incubate for 2 h in a 37°C water bath.\nStain with SunTag smFISH probes.\nDilute the SunTag probes to a final concentration of 50 nM in 300 μL Stellaris hybridization buffer.\nIncubate the embryos in the probe mixture in a 37°C water bath for 12–18 h.\nCritical: Incubate the embryos in the probe mixture for at least 12 h. Keep the Stellaris wash and hybridization buffers at 4°C for the duration of the experiment; fresh Stellaris wash buffer should be made up for each experiment.\nCritical: After probe hybridization, embryos should be kept in the dark as far as possible. Cover the V-Vials with foil to maintain darkness.\nNote: Using SunTag probes has the advantage that they are generic for different SunTag-POI mRNAs. Moreover, detection is limited to mRNAs carrying SunTag sequences, excluding mRNAs transcribed from the endogenous/unmodified locus, which simplifies the analysis.\nAlternatives: SunTag smiFISH (single molecule inexpensive FISH) probes, which have specific sequences against the SunTag and a common flap sequence for the hybridization of fluorescently labelled probes (Tsanov et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]), may be used to reduce costs. In this case, incubate smiFISH probes with fluorescently tagged flap probes prior to dilution in Stellaris hybridization buffer (Calvo et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). We have not tested smiFISH probes against SunTag sequences, but have used them to detect other individual mRNAs (Hoppe et al, unpublished).\nDay 2:\nCritical: Maintain the embryos in darkness as much as possible on Day 2.\nPre-warm Stellaris hybridization and wash buffers to 37°C in a water bath.\nPerform washes to remove unbound probes with 500 μL of the following solutions.\nWash embryos in Stellaris hybridization buffer for 30 min in a 37°C water bath.\nRinse with Stellaris wash buffer.",
    "Wash embryos in Stellaris wash buffer for 15 min in a 37°C water bath. Repeat twice.\nRock in Stellaris wash buffer for 15 min.\nRock 3 times in PBT for 10 min.\nRock in PBT + 1 × Western Blocking Reagent (WBR) for 30 min.\nIncubate with the primary antibody.\nDilute anti-mNeonGreen antibody (Chromotek, RRID: AB_2827566) 1:250 in PBT + 1 × WBR.\nRock in the primary antibody solution at 4°C for 12–18 h.\nAlternatives: The primary antibody incubation can be shortened to 2 h at 20oC, allowing the protocol steps described for days 2 and 3 to be completed in a single day.\nNote: Not all antibodies are compatible with the smFISH protocol so new antibodies will have to be tested in combination with the smFISH protocol.\nDay 3:\nCritical: Keep the embryos in the dark where possible on Day 3.\nPerform washes to remove any unbound antibody with 500 μL of the following solutions.\nRinse the embryos with PBT twice.\nRock the embryos 4 times in PBT for 15 min.\nRock the embryos in PBT + 1 × WBR for 30 min.\nIncubate with the secondary antibody.\nDilute anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, RRID: AB_141607) at 1:250 in PBT + 1 × WBR.\nRock the embryos in the secondary antibody solution for 2 h at 20oC.\nPerform washes in 500 μL volumes.\nRinse the embryos twice with PBT.\nRock twice in PBT for 15 min.\nDilute 500 μg/mL DAPI at 1:1000 in PBT. Rock embryos in DAPI solution for 15 min.\nRock in PBT for 15 min.\nAlternatives: If using ProLong Diamond mountant with DAPI, omit the DAPI incubation step.\nMount embryos.\nRemove as much PBT as possible.\nAdd approximately 3 drops of ProLong Diamond to the embryos.",
    "Use a glass pipette to draw up the embryos and pipette them onto a glass slide.\nCarefully cover with a Nr 1, 24 mm × 50 mm coverslip by lowering onto the slide with tweezers.\nDry the slides for 12–18 h at 20oC in the dark. The slides can then be used for imaging or can be stored at −20°C.\nPause point: Slides can be stored at −20°C for at least 3 months without loss of staining, but we recommend imaging the embryos as soon as possible.\nImaging\nTiming: ∼1 h per image, dependent on image size\nIn this step, embryos are imaged using confocal microscopy. Images can be taken at the level of the expression domain, and the total numbers of mRNAs and translated mRNAs can be calculated. In addition, higher magnification images can be taken and used to calculate the number of ribosomes on each mRNA.\nImage the stained embryos using confocal microscopy. 3 channels will be required, for SunTag smFISH, mNeonGreen staining, and DAPI (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]). For analysis of translation along the anterior-posterior axis, align the axis diagonally to maximize the area of embryo imaged (see the example in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) and for compatibility with axis calculation in the spots assignment script used in Step 34.\nFor the example whole expression domain dataset, we used a Leica TCS SP8 AOBS inverted confocal microscope with 63×/1.40 HCX PL APO CS oil objective and 0.75× optical zoom, and white light laser set to 70%.",
    "Set the pinhole to 1 airy unit and scan speed to 400 Hz, with 2× line averaging and bit depth of 8. Acquire an image at 2048 x 2048 pixels, resulting in a pixel size of 0.12 μm x 0.12 μm, and z-step size of 300 nm, for 107 z-steps, giving an imaging depth of 31.8 μm. The z-depth should include the most apical to the most basal fluorescent signal in the SunTag smFISH and the scFv-mNG channels.\nCollect the DAPI channel with 405 nm excitation (2%), using a PMT detector with collection set from 415 – 470 nm.\nCollect the scFv-mNG (AlexaFluor 488) channel with 488 nm excitation (10%), using a hybrid detector with collection set from 500 – 540 nm.\nCollect the SunTag smFISH (Quasar 570) channel with 548 nm excitation (15%) using a hybrid detector with collection set from 558 – 640 nm.\nCritical: Make sure the sample slide reaches 20oC before imaging.\nAlternatives: The expression domain can be aligned along the x or y axis, allowing cellular outputto be analyzed using the x or y position of nuclei.\nNote: For whole embryo/expression domain imaging, use an objective with magnification sufficient to capture the whole expression domain. We use a laser power for the SunTag smFISH channel which overexposes the transcription sites allowing individual mRNAs to be reliably imaged and detected by the analysis software. If the number of mRNAs within the transcription site is to be analyzed, a lower laser power must be used to prevent overexposure.\nNote: Imaging at least three biological replicates (embryos) is recommended as there will be cell-to-cell and embryo-to-embryo variation, especially when analyzing mutant genotypes. Images taken with the example settings will provide ∼250 (nc12) – 1000 (nc14) nuclei per embryo.",
    "Image a high magnification region of a stained embryo for calculation of ribosome number.\nFor the example ribosome number imaging dataset, we used a Leica TCS SP8 AOBS inverted confocal microscope with 100×/1.40 HCX PL APO oil objective and 3× optical zoom, and white light laser set to 70%.\nSet the pinhole to 0.65 airy unit and scan speed to 400 Hz, with 4× line averaging and bit depth of 8. Acquire an image at 4096 x 4096 pixels, resulting in a pixel size of 0.009 μm x 0.009 μm, and z-step size of 200 nm. The example dataset contains 64 slices, resulting in a total imaging depth of 12.6 μm in the z direction.\nCollect the DAPI channel with 405 nm excitation (11%), using a PMT detector with collection set from 415 – 470 nm.\nCollect the scFv-mNG (AlexaFluor 488) channel with 488 nm excitation (12%), using a hybrid detector with collection set from 500 – 540 nm, and gating of 1–6 μs.\nCollect the SunTag smFISH (Quasar 570) channel with 548 nm excitation (20%) using a hybrid detector with collection set from 558 – 640 nm, and gating of 1–6 μs.\nCritical: To calculate the number of ribosomes, translation sites must not be overexposed in order to capture the total amount of fluorescence. Ensure there are no overexposed pixels in the scFv-mNG channel.\n(Optional) Deconvolve images using Huygens Professional Deconvolution Software (SVI).\nNote: We deconvolve the images to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. However, this is not essential if deconvolution is not preferred, and the raw fluorescence will be sufficient to analyze the datasets.\nAnalysis of the number of translated mRNAs\nTiming: ∼5 h per image, dependent on image size and the number of mRNAs, including the time for running the assignment script.",
    "In these steps, the whole expression domain images are analyzed using Imaris 9.2 and a custom python script is used to quantify the total mRNA number and the number that are translated (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/995-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Overview of the analysis of translation sites from fixed embryo images\n(A) The steps show how the mRNAs and scFv-mNG signals are detected, colocalized to identify translation sites, then assigned to the nearest nucleus.\n(B) The steps show how to analyze the high magnification images to calculate the number of ribosomes per mRNA.\nLoad the image into Imaris 9.2. Most common image formats can be opened in Imaris 9.2. If using a later version of Imaris, run the image through the Imaris File Converter to convert the image to .ims format.\nUsing the Imaris ‘spots’ function, create spots to identify the mRNAs based on the Suntag smFISH signals (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Step 1). Follow the steps in the ‘spots’ creation wizard.\nLeave the first screen as default settings.\nSelect the channel used for SunTag smFISH.\nEstimate the XY diameter by moving to ‘Slice’ view and measuring the diameter of individual mRNA foci. We find a diameter of 0.6 μm to be optimal but this will vary depending on the imaging settings.\nSelect ‘Model PSF-elongation along Z-axis’ and ‘Background Subtraction’.\nTo remove transcription sites from analysis, set the ‘Filter Type’ to ‘Intensity Sum Ch=X Img=1’ where Channel X is the channel used for SunTag smFISH that is currently being worked on. Select only spots which are low in fluorescence (the majority of the spots), removing the tail of spots with high fluorescence. This will remove any nascent transcription sites (brighter than individual mRNAs) from the analysis.\nAdd a filter with ‘Filter Type’ set to ‘Quality’. Drag the filter until all mRNA spots are selected.",
    "Complete the spots wizard.\nName the spots ‘SunTag mRNA spots’.\nCritical: It can be difficult to identify spots by eye when there is a large number of mRNAs in one area. We find it is simplest to change the quality filter while looking at a region with less mRNAs, for example the edge of an expression domain. Ensure that each mRNA molecule in this region is selected without any false positives (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Step 1). Check that no excess spots are selected by toggling on and off the ‘Spots’ view under ‘Scene’.\nUse the Imaris ‘spots’ function to identify the potential translation sites based on the scFv-mNG signal (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Step 1). Follow the steps in the ‘spots’ creation wizard.\nLeave the first screen as the default settings.\nSelect the channel used for scFv-mNG.\nEstimate the XY diameter by moving to ‘Slice’ view and measuring the diameter of individual scFv-mNG foci. We find a diameter of 0.5 μm to be optimal but this will vary depending on the imaging settings and the size of the scFv-mNG translation sites, which depends on translation efficiency. Note that the scFv-mNG foci will vary in size – use the diameter of the smaller spots to ensure all are captured.\nSelect ‘Model PSF-elongation along Z-axis’ and ‘Background Subtraction’.\nSet the ‘Filter Type’ to ‘Quality’. Move the filter until all scFv-mNG spots are captured.\nComplete the spots wizard.\nName the spots ‘scFv spots’.",
    "Critical: The amount of background in the scFv-mNG channel will increase as translation occurs, due to increased numbers of SunTag-test proteins that have been translated and released, still bound by scFv-mNG. This can make distinguishing scFv-mNG translation sites from background more difficult. In this case, we recommend capturing all the translation sites (identifiable visually by colocalization with mRNAs) as spots. While most background signals will be avoided, this threshold may cause Imaris to detect some background spots (for example, in the nucleus) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Step 1). However, as we call scFv-mNG signals as translation sites only if they have an overlapping smFISH signal, the colocalization step will eliminate scFv-mNG background spots that lack a colocalized mRNA (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nColocalize the SunTag mRNA and scFv spots to identify translation sites based on the presence of both an smFISH and scFv-mNG signal (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Step 2).\nIn the ‘X-tensions’ tab, select the ‘Co-localize spots’ X-tension.\nSelect the two spots masks to co-localize –‘SunTag mRNA spots’ and ‘scFv spots’.\nInput the threshold to call co-localization. We use a threshold of 0.3 (300 nm), which was chosen based on our data but is also consistent with the distance used in a previous SunTag study (Wu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]).\nUsing the Imaris ‘Surfaces’ function, create surfaces to identify nuclei. Nuclei will be used to remove nuclear mRNAs from the analysis (optional) and to assign mRNAs to their closest nucleus. Follow the steps in the ‘surfaces’ creation wizard (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Step 3).\nLeave the first screen as the default settings.\nSelect the channel used for the nuclear stain.\nSelect ‘Smooth’ and set ‘Surfaces Detail’ to 0.5 μm.\nEstimate the nuclear size by moving to ‘Slice’ view and measuring the diameter of individual nuclei.",
    "Select ‘Background Subtraction (Local Contrast)’ and set ‘Diameter of largest Sphere which fits into the Object’ as the value measured in step d.\nChange the Threshold (Background Subtraction) filter until all nuclei are covered.\nSelect ‘Enable’ to Split touching Objects. Set the ‘Seed Points Diameter’ to the value used for ‘Diameter of largest Sphere which fits into the Object’.\nSet the ‘Filter Type’ to ‘Quality’ and drag until all nuclei have an object.\nComplete the surfaces wizard.\nName the surfaces ‘nuclei’.\n(Optional) Identify mRNAs inside the nucleus and check if any translation sites have been assigned inside the nucleus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Step 4). This step is used to remove nuclear mRNAs so that the proportion of translated mRNAs is only calculated based on the total number of cytoplasmic mRNAs, which are accessible to the translation machinery. As there should be no translation sites identified in the nucleus, this step also functions as a control to check whether there are any false positive translation sites.\nSelect ‘Suntag mRNA spots’ and run the Imaris X-tension ‘Split spots into surface objects’.\nSelect ‘scFv spots co-located’ and run the Imaris X-tension ‘Split spots into surface objects’.\nExport the Imaris data.\nExport the ‘SunTag mRNA spots’ data from step 27. This represents the total mRNA data. If removal of nuclear mRNAs is required, also export the ‘Suntag mRNA spots inside Surfaces’ folder from step 31a.\nExport the ‘scFv spots co-located’ data, the translated mRNA data. If removal of any false positive translation sites is needed, also export the ‘scFv spots co-located inside Surfaces’ folder.\nExport the ‘nuclei’ data.",
    "Critical: Ensure that ‘Position’ and all files starting with ‘Intensity’ are included in the data exported for ‘Suntag mRNA spots’ and ‘scFv spots co-located’, and that ‘Position’ and all files starting with ‘Ellipsoid Axis’ are included in the data exported for ‘nuclei’.\n(Optional) If removal of nuclear mRNAs is required for the analysis, run the data through the remove_nuclear.py script (https://github.com/DaisyVinter/StarProtocols_Vinter_2021[href=https://github.com/DaisyVinter/StarProtocols_Vinter_2021]) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, Step 5).\nCreate a folder containing the ‘Suntag mRNA spots’ and ‘Suntag mRNA spots inside Surfaces’ data.\nIn Anaconda Prompt, type: python. Drag and drop the remove_nuclear.py script, and then drag and drop the folder created in step a.\nThe script will create two folders in the folder created in step a – ‘Suntag mRNA cytoplasmic spots’ and ‘Suntag mRNA nuclear spots’, containing the separate Imaris outputs for cytoplasmic and nuclear mRNAs. Use the ‘Suntag mRNA cytoplasmic spots’ folder in step 34a if only the cytoplasmic mRNA output is required.\nRepeat steps a to c for the ‘scFv spots co-located’ and ‘scFv spots co-located inside Surfaces’ data.\nRun the data through the spotME_EmbryoMid.py script (https://github.com/TMinchington/sass[href=https://github.com/TMinchington/sass]) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], Step 6). In this script, the total mRNAs and translated mRNAs are assigned to the nearest nuclei, to reveal the numbers in each of these virtual cell territories across the expression domain.\nCreate a folder containing the ‘SunTag mRNA spots’ data (or ‘Suntag mRNA cytoplasmic spots’ if step 33 is used) and ‘nuclei’ data.\nIn Anaconda Prompt, type: python. Drag and drop the spotME_EmbryoMid.py script and then drag and drop the folder created in step a.\nThe output required is the ‘all_data_with_distance.txt’ in the ‘time_data’ folder. This is the data output for all mRNAs.",
    "Repeat steps a to c with the ‘scFv spots co-located’ data instead of ‘SunTag mRNA spots’ data. This will give the data output for translated mRNAs only.\nThe ‘all_data_with_distance.txt’ file gives the number of mRNA or translation site spots assigned to each nearest nucleus, the x, y, and z position of each spot and nucleus, and the Imaris intensity data for each spot in each channel. In addition, the script calculates the anterior-posterior axis of embryos positioned as described in Step 23. The midline.png file shows the axis position (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). The ‘all_data_with_distance.txt’ file also shows the position of each nucleus along the anterior posterior axis, and the perpendicular distance from the axis. If the embryo axis has instead been lined up along the x or y axis, the x or y positions can be used as a measurement along the axis.\nAlternatives: Other free to access programs are available to recognize foci in fluorescence images, including Airlocalize (Trcek et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) and FISH-quant (Mueller et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). However, we find these are less able to cope with large datasets than Imaris.\nAnalysis of ribosome number\nTiming: ∼30 min per image\nIn this step, the number of ribosomes present in the translation sites are calculated, using the high magnification images collected. This quantification requires analysis of the sum fluorescence intensities of both single cytoplasmic proteins and active translation sites. Here, we use the freely available analysis software Airlocalize that uses a spot-detection algorithm (Lionnet et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Trcek et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). This algorithm subtracts the background fluorescence that surrounds individual mRNA spots and therefore provides robust measurements even in images containing high background.\nPrepare the high magnification images for analysis.\nOpen the saved Leica image file in Fiji.\nSave each channel collected separately as a .tif image.",
    "Name the Suntag smFISH channel as suntag.tif, and the mNeonGreen channel as ng.tif, for compatibility with later analysis scripts.\nAlternatives: To reduce the computational time in Airlocalize, a subset of the image can be used.\nIdentify and quantify the fluorescence of translation sites using Airlocalize.\nOpen the Airlocalize software. When prompted select the type of data to be analyzed, here a 3D single image.\nNavigate to and select the image that will be analyzed.\nSelect the mNeonGreen image channel only, named ng.tif.\nDetermine the general analysis parameters in the next window, ‘Quantification Parameters’.\nUse the default settings in the ‘PSF Width (pix)’ section. This will enable the user to manually select fluorescent spots that will be used to calculate the point spread function (PSF) (see Step d).\nSelect an output folder.\nEnable the option ‘output image of spots’. This option will output a tif image file with all the spots that were recorded during the analysis. To verify the analysis accuracy this spot file can be overlaid with the microscopy image.\nDetermine the PSF. Airlocalize visualizes the fluorescent profile along the x/y/z axis of a selected fluorescent spot and a Gaussian fit is applied to it (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, Step 1).\nSelect a translation site by hovering the cursor over the center of the fluorescent signal and left click verify selection. The x/y/z profiles of this spot will be displayed. Select ‘local gaussian fit’ to display the fit over the fluorescent profile. A good fit resembles a Gaussian distribution curve. Click ‘record fit result’ to provide training data for the algorithm. Repeat with ∼ 10 additional translation sites.\nAdvance to the next window by selecting ‘done’.",
    "Identify the translation sites using a detection threshold. Modify the threshold until all translation sites are recognized by a red signal overlay on the microscopy image but none of the single proteins are. Once the desired threshold is set, select ‘done’ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, Step 2).\nMultiple files will be generated in the output folder.\nThe spots.tif file contains all spots that were identified.\nThe .loc3 file contains the x/y/z position, fluorescence intensity and frame number (here 0) for each translation site.\nThe .par3 file contains all analysis parameters (including PSF in xy and z).\nThe .det file contains the results and parameters.\nMove the analysis files into a subfolder called ‘translation_sites’.\nIdentify and quantify the fluorescence of single proteins using Airlocalize (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, Step 3).\nTo identify single proteins, repeat steps 36a and b.\nTo identify single proteins there are two options:\nEither follow steps 36c and d as outlined above\nOr disable the option ‘set manually’ in the ‘PSF Width (pix)’ window. Instead modify the PSF values to the previously determined values in the translation site analysis. The PSF values are included in the .par3 text file. This option will skip step 36d and advance directly to step 36e.\nFollow steps 36e and f. Make sure that the threshold is set so that single proteins are recognized.\nMove analysis files into a subfolder called ‘single_proteins’.\nNote: By identifying single proteins we also by default record the translation sites again as their fluorescent intensity is greater than single proteins. However, the translation sites will later be removed from this dataset in step 39b.\nIdentify and quantify the fluorescence of mRNA molecules for colocalization analysis using Airlocalize (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, Step 4).\nFollow steps 36a-f as outlined above using the SunTag mRNA microscopy channel. The input file should be called suntag.tif.",
    "Move the output files into a subfolder called ‘mRNA’.\nPerform colocalization analysis and determine the number of ribosomes present in the translation sites.\nOpen Anaconda prompt. Type: python. Drag and drop the folder containing the ribosome_number.py script (https://github.com/DaisyVinter/StarProtocols_Vinter_2021[href=https://github.com/DaisyVinter/StarProtocols_Vinter_2021]) and then drag and drop the folder containing the subfolders with the analysis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, Step 5).\nThe script will identify translation sites by colocalization with mRNA spots, discarding any ‘translation sites’ that do not colocalize. The script will then take the single proteins and discard any included translation sites. Following this, the median fluorescence of the remaining single proteins is calculated, and the fluorescence of translation sites is divided by this number.\nThe output will be a file called num_ribo.csv containing the number of ribosomes per translation site.\nApply a correction factor to account for ribosomes that have only translated part of the Suntag mRNA sequence and so do not have the full binding of fluorophores.\nThe correction factor is calculated by (lengthSunTagCDS × 0.5 + lengthhbCDS)/lengthtotal. This assumes that ribosomes are uniformly distributed, so ribosomes that have only translated part of the Suntag sequence will on average have translated half of the sequence (Pichon et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nDivide the number of ribosomes given in the output file in c by the correction factor calculated (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, Step 6).\nNote: The Airlocalize algorithm is MATLAB based but does not require a full MATLAB license and can be run solely with the MCRInstaller.\nSection 2: Live imaging of translation sites\nHere we describe how to image live embryos to visualize translation sites across the expression domain and gain spatiotemporal information about their distribution. Separate steps are also included in the protocol describing how to monitor the translation of single mRNAs in live embryos, in order to capture their translation dynamics (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Prepare cover slips for live imaging\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, cover slips, coated thinly with heptane glue, are prepared for their use in live imaging experiments.\nNote: Prepare cover slips the day before or on the day of the live imaging experiment.\nMake a ball of unrolled sellotape and place it in a 50 mL bottle. Fill the bottle half full of heptane and soak the sellotape for at least 12 h so the glue will dissolve.\nNote: We use yellow double-sided plastic tape, 25 mm x 20 m (RS Components, Cat# 555-033) or packaging tape (Tesa, Cat# 4124). Other brands of sticky tape will need to be tested to ensure they are not toxic to Drosophila embryos.\nPause point: Heptane glue can be kept for many months at 20oC.\nTake Nr. 1, 18 x 18 mm coverslips and pipette approximately 60 μL of heptane glue onto the coverslip. Leave the heptane glue to dry as a thin coating on the slide.\nSet up the embryo collection cage\nTiming: 1–3 days\nIn this step, a collection cage is set up to produce embryos for live imaging (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Step 1).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/995-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Overview of embryo mounting for live imaging of translation sites\nThe key steps required for the collection and mounting of embryos are shown.\nCollect flies.\nFor whole expression domain live imaging (Step 50): Collect virgin females heterozygous for the scFv-mNG and His-RFP transgenes and males homozygous for the SunTag-hb transgene.\nFor single translation site live imaging (Step 51): Collect virgin females heterozygous for the scFv-mNG and tdMCP-2xmRuby3-CAAX transgenes and males homozygous for the SunTag-hb-128xMS2 transgene.\nNote: This cross will produce embryos with one copy, zygotically expressed, of the tagged gene of interest.",
    "Note: nos-MCP-EGFP (Garcia et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) and nos-tdMCP-RFP (Halstead et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) stocks are also available for detection of the mRNAs carrying MS2 sequences.\nTransfer at least 50 females and 25 males to a collection cage with an apple juice agar plate and yeast.\nNote: Including more flies in the collection cage will give more embryos for live imaging.\nCollect and mount embryos\nTiming: Embryo collection, ∼60 min; mounting, ∼10 min\nIn these steps, embryos are mounted for live imaging (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nChange the collection cage plate to a new apple juice agar plate with yeast. Let the flies lay for the desired amount of time and remove the plate for embryo collection (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Step 2).\nNote: For imaging SunTag-hb mRNAs, which are translated from nc11 – 14, we let flies lay for 1 h so that the embryos are sufficiently young to image the whole translation time.\nDechorionate the embryos by applying 50% domestic bleach to the plate and incubating for 2 min.\nTransfer the embryos to a sieve by washing them off the plate with water or embryo washing solution. When in the sieve, wash thoroughly with water or embryo washing solution until no bleach remains.\nBrush the embryos out of the sieve onto a fresh apple juice agar plate under a dissection microscope.\nArrange the embryos in one or more lines on the apple juice agar plate using a brush or tweezers (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Step 3).\nNote: Arrange the embryos so that the embryo area to be imaged is facing upwards. For example, the scFv-mNG; His-RFP/SunTag-hb embryos were arranged with the lateral side facing upwards.\nMount the embryos on a Lumox dish (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Step 4).",
    "Place two Nr. 0, 18 × 18 mm cover slips on the Lumox imaging dish, leaving a small gap of approximately 12 mm in between.\nFill the gap with 70 μL of halocarbon oil (7:1, halocarbon oil 700:halocarbon oil 27).\nUse tweezers to pick up a heptane glue cover slip and carefully lower the glue side onto the embryos.\nTransfer the coverslip with embryos onto a Lumox imaging dish, with embryos positioned in the imaging oil and the coverslip overlapping with the two coverslips placed on the imaging dish in step a.\nUse nail polish to secure the embryo coverslip to the other coverslips.\nNote: A movie of this mounting technique can be found in (Hoppe and Ashe, 2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nLive imaging of translation sites across the expression domain\nTiming: ∼ 2.5 h per video\nIn this step, SunTag-hb mRNA translation sites are imaged across the width of the expression domain in living embryos. For precise aging of embryos, the embryos are maternally expressing His-RFP, therefore we are visualizing translation sites without detecting the mRNAs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). However, this has the advantage that the mRNA is only modified by the addition of SunTag sequences and does not carry any MS2 loops, meaning there is less potential for endogenous regulation to be disrupted.\nCollect a time-lapse movie of a developing embryo for ∼2 h. We use a Zeiss LSM 880 upright microscope with Fast Airyscan for imaging (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nSet up the microscope with two channels for scFv-mNG and His-RFP, both collecting with the Fast Airyscan.",
    "For the example dataset, we used a 40×/1.30 EC Plan-Neofluar DIC M27 oil objective and 1.1× optical zoom, with a bit depth of 16. The image was acquired at 2996 x 788 pixels, resulting in a pixel size of 0.06 μm, and 25 slices with a z-step size of 850 nm.\nThe His-RFP channel was excited with the 561 nm laser (1.5%) and the scFv-mNG channel with the 488 nm laser (5%).\nLocate the embryos using brightfield illumination.\nUsing the His-RFP channel, find an embryo of ∼15 min prior to the desired age of imaging. For imaging translation beginning at nc11, as for the SunTag-hb embryos, find an embryo where nuclei are just beginning to migrate to the surface.\nSet up a z-stack including the whole nuclear depth and cytoplasm on either side of the nucleus.\nTake a time series with the minimum possible gap between z-stacks until translation has ceased. An example of a SunTag-hb time-lapse experiment is shown in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] (previously described in Vinter et al. 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]).",
    "Note: Speed, resolution, and z-depth of imaging must be balanced to achieve the optimal settings for the experiment. A high frame rate is important to capture the dynamics of translation, but may impact on the image quality. If raw image quality is low, image analysis and identification of translation sites above background may be more difficult. Time resolution can be improved by imaging a smaller region of the embryo, or by reducing the z-stack. The settings used allow us to see a narrow region of the embryo (∼9 nuclear widths at nuclear cycle 14) extending along ∼30% of the anterior posterior axis, with a time resolution of ∼40s and imaging depth of 20.4 μm. The resolution allows for the recognition of individual translation sites in Imaris. If using a different microscope or imaging a different sized section of the embryo, these settings will need to be optimized.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Maximum intensity projection of an embryo showing SunTag-hb translation sites (gray) and Histone-RFP (magenta) through nc11-14, related to step 50\nEmbryos zygotically expressing SunTag-hb are from females carrying single copies of thescFv-mNGandHis-RFPtransgenes. Imaged with 46 sec time resolution between frames, time stamp is in min:sec.\nLive imaging of mRNAs and single translation sites\nTiming: ∼30 min per video\nIn this step, SunTag-hb mRNAs and translation sites are imaged in a small region of the expression domain in live embryos. As mRNAs move very rapidly, we are using tdMCP-2xmRuby3-CAAX to tether them to the membrane, thereby facilitating their tracking and analysis over time (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCollect a high magnification time-lapse dataset of individual translation sites. We use a Zeiss LSM 880 upright microscope with Fast Airyscan for imaging (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).",
    "Set up the microscope with two channels for scFv-mNG and tdMCP-2xmRuby3-CAAX, both collecting with the Fast Airyscan.\nFor the example dataset, we used a 63×/1.40 PL Apo oil objective and 8× optical zoom, with a bit depth of 16. The image was acquired at 184 × 184 pixels, resulting in a pixel size of 0.09 × 0.09 μm.\nThe MCP-mRuby3 channel was excited with the 561 nm laser (15%) and the scFv-mNG channel with the 488 nm laser (15%).\nLocate the embryos using brightfield illumination.\nLocate the area where translation is occurring or expected to occur using the objective without zoom (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nZoom into the area so that only a few cells are visible.\nAdjust the focus so that the membrane (labeled with tdMCP-2xmRuby3-CAAX) is in focus, with individual translation sites in mNG if the mRNAs are already being translated (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nTo achieve the best possible time resolution, a time lapse dataset was acquired with a single z plane. An example time-lapse experiment imaging individual translation sites is shown in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nNote: Prior to nc14, membranes are only present apically in the embryo, then membrane invagination starts in nc14. Therefore, when imaging prior to nc14, it is necessary to focus on the top of the cells where the mRNAs and unbound tdMCP-mRuby3-CAAX proteins show the cell outline (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C). Once the membranes are located zoom in to image the translation sites.",
    "Note: To track single translation sites, speed, resolution, and z depth must be balanced. In the example data set, a single z plane and small region was used so that the image resolution was of the quality necessary to identify translation sites (pixel size 0.09 × 0.09μm), and the time resolution was ∼2s, which is fast enough to capture changes associated with translation initiation and elongation (Morisaki and Stasevich, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). When using a different microscope, settings will have to be adjusted to optimize for each individual experiment.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2.

Merged and single channel views are shown. Time resolution is 1.98 sec per frame, the scale bar is 5 μm.\nAnalysis of expression domain live imaging\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps describe how to analyze the expression domain level live imaging data to reveal the number, intensity, and distribution of translation sites over time (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/995-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Overview of the analysis of translation sites from the live imaging data\nThe analysis steps are shown for live imaging of (A) the expression domain and (B) anchored individual translation sites.\nUsing the Imaris ‘surface’ function, create surfaces to identify nuclei (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, Step 1).\nIn the first screen, enable ‘Track Surfaces (over Time)’.\nSelect the Channel used for His-RFP.\nSelect ‘Enable Smooth’ and set ‘Surfaces Detail’ to 1 μm, which will smooth the nuclear surface and aids object identification.\nIn the ‘Slice’ tab, measure the diameter of nuclei.",
    "Select ‘Background Subtraction’ under Thresholding. Set ‘Diameter of largest Sphere which fits into the Object’ to the value measured in step d.\nAdjust the threshold so that the nuclei are selected. Move between frames to check that nuclei are selected in all frames.\nSelect ‘Enable’ under ‘Split touching Objects (Region Growing)’. Set ‘Seed Points Diameter’ to the value measured in step d.\nFilter the seed points by ‘Quality’ so that only nuclei are selected.\nUse the ‘Number of Voxels Img=1’ filter to eliminate any small non-nuclear objects.\nIn the ‘Tracking’ screen, select the Algorithm as ‘Autoregressive Motion’, Max Distance as 5 μm, and Max Gap Size as 3. These settings work well to track nuclei (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, Step 2) from nc11 to the onset of gastrulation in nc14, where nuclei do not move more than 5 μm between consecutive frames. If analyzing datasets with longer time resolution, determine the maximum nuclear movement between two consecutive frames using the ‘Slice’ tab.\nComplete the surfaces wizard.\nUsing the Imaris ‘spots’ function, create spots to identify the translation sites (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, Step 3) (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nDeselect ‘Track Spots (over Time)’ in the first screen.\nSelect the Channel used for ‘scFv-mNG’.\nIn the ‘Slice’ tab, measure the size of the translation sites.\nEnter the value into ‘Estimated XY diameter’ and select ‘Model PSF-elongation along Z-axis’ and ‘Background Subtraction’.\nUse filters to select the scFv-mNG foci (translation sites). Useful filters include ‘Quality’, ‘Intensity Max’ and ‘Intensity Sum’. Move between frames to check foci are selected in all frames.\nComplete the spots wizard.\nExport the Imaris data (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, Step 4).\nExport the statistics in the ‘Statistics’ tab. Select the desired statistics in ‘Preferences’, which can include the scFv-mNG intensity of each spot and position of the spots in each time point.",
    "Analysis of single translation site live imaging\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this step, individual translation sites are tracked, and their fluorescence intensities quantified over time.\nUse the Imaris ‘Spots’ function for tracking of translation sites over time (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) (Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nIn the creation wizard select ‘Track spots over time’.\nIn the next window, select the scFv-mNG channel for analysis and estimate the xy diameter of the translation site. The full fluorescence of the translation site should be included within the spot object (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, Step 1).\nUsing filters, make sure that the translation sites are selected through time. The most useful filters here are ‘Quality’, ‘Intensity Sum’ and ‘Intensity Max’.\nFor the tracking parameters select ‘Autoregressive Motion’, a ‘Maximum Distance’ of 5 μm and a ‘Max Gap Size’ of 2 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, Step 2).\nAfter successful tracking, export the analysis files.\nIn the ‘Statistics’ tab, select ‘Export all Statistics to file’. The statistics that are exported can be defined by the user under settings and are dependent on the type of analysis required. These can include (but are not limited to) fluorescence intensity quantification, distance and speed of movement (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, Step 3).\nNote: For fluorescence intensity quantitation it is important to perform a background correction. This can be achieved by manually placing spot objects (of identical volume to the analysis spots) into different background regions and measuring the fluorescence value. An average background value can then be subtracted from the translation site fluorescence. Depending on the movie length this can be time consuming. For a semi-automated way to remove background fluorescence see (Hoppe and Ashe, 2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10])."
