    "Notes: Local animal ethics/protocol regarding animal housing and handling need to be followed.The electronic VF test measures the animal’s mechanical “pain” hypersensitivity, a parameter which can be influenced by stress/anxiety (Gamaro et al., 1998). Therefore, it is very important to minimize any environmental stimuli (visual or auditory) and allow rats to acclimate to the experimental room, the test and the experimenter. It should be stressed out that experiments need to be performed in a quiet room by a blinded experimenter using the method of equal blocks with randomisation of treatments to avoid any uncontrollable environmental influence that might induce a modification in the behavioural response.If rats have not been subjected to any other test, put their home-cages in the experimental room for at least one hour for a few days before the experiments. Meanwhile, habituate the animals to be gently held for a few seconds to avoid stress related to handling.  Days 1 and 2. HabituationRats are transported to the experimental room and stay at least 1 h in their home cages.Then the first batch of rats is placed on the apparatus for 30 min to acclimatize to the test. With our homemade apparatus, up to 6 rats can be tested simultaneously. Bigger batch can be used depending on study design. Place a heavy object on the boxes’ lids to prevent rats from escaping.Clean the boxes with water humidified paper and place the following batch of rats. This procedure is carried out for two days.Day 0. TestingSimilar to Days 1 and 2, rats are transported to the experimental room 1 h before testing.The first batch of rats is placed on the boxes for 15 min. Place a clean plastic tip on the probe and zero the read-out.",
    "Apply the tip of the force transducer on the middle of the rat hind paw (footpad center) from below (Figure 3). The testing area may depend on the pain model used.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160909/20160909011804_8378.jpgFigure 3. Application of the von Frey tip on the rat’s hind pawImportant step: Increase the pressure gradually (approximately 15 g/sec) and linearly until a clear withdrawal of the paw is observed.Note the pressure value that elicited the reaction.Assess the withdrawal threshold on the rat situated in the adjacent box (there is no need to replace the plastic tip between each animal). Repeat steps B4-7 until each rat has been submitted to the test. Then go back to the first rat and repeat until two close withdrawal thresholds are observed (less than 10% of difference). Stimulations on the same hind paw should be at least 3-5 min apart.Both hind paws can be assessed in the same animal, but in the case of a polyneuropathy (Ferrier et al., 2015), there is no need to test both of them. In the case of mononeuropathy [e.g., spinal nerve injury (Kim and Chung, 1992) or chronic constriction injury (Bennett and Xie, 1988)], the paw withdrawal threshold of the contralateral limb (unaffected) can serve as an intra-animal control."
