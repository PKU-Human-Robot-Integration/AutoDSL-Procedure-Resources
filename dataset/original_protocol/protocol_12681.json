    "Ethical approval was granted by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong―New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Reference Number: 2013.055)\n1. PCR amplification\nPrior to starting, remove PCR buffer mix, sample diluent and DNA samples (both test and reference DNA) (see the Table of Materials) from the -20 °C freezer and keep them at room temperature for 20–30 min to make sure all reagents and DNA are fully thawed. Vortex and briefly spin down before use.\nMeasure the concentration of the DNA samples using a spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials). The DNA concentration should be 25 ng/µL; dilute with sample diluent to the appropriate concentration if required.\nNOTE: The DNA should be extracted and purified to remove interfering substances, such as proteins and high salt concentrations. Non-degraded, high-quality DNA should be used for subsequent PCR amplification and analysis (A260/A280: 1.8–2.0 and A260/A230: >1.0).\nLabel wells of a PCR plate or 0.2 mL PCR tubes to identify reference and tested DNA samples.\nCalculate the number of PCR reactions required for the test samples, 2 reference samples and negative control sample. Prepare PCR Master Mix by adding 15 µL of PCR buffer mix, 2.6 µL of sample diluent and 0.4 µL of polymerase for each reaction.\nNOTE: A negative control using sample diluent is essential to monitor the PCR performance. Prepare the PCR master mix at room temperature, do NOT pipette on ice. The PCR buffer mix is viscous. Mix the tube and then briefly spin down prior to use.\nVortex the PCR master mix from step 1.4 for 10–20 s and spin down. Slowly dispense 18 µL of the mixture into each well or tube.",
    "Vortex and spin down the DNA samples. Pipette 2 µL of each DNA into the appropriate well or tube for a final PCR volume of 20 µL. Mix by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nNOTE: The total amount of DNA per reaction should be 50–100 ng. DNA amounts greater than 150 ng per 20 µL PCR reaction may result in a poor amplification of large repeat alleles. For lower concentrated DNAs, the amount of sample diluent in the PCR master mix can be replaced by DNA solution.\nSeal the plate with adhesive plate sealer, or with tube caps.\nPlace the sealed PCR plate or tubes in the thermal cycler with heated lid. Run the program with the following settings: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 98 °C for 35 s, annealing at 59 °C for 35 s, and extension at 72 °C for 4 min; a final step at 72 °C for 10 min. Hold the PCR products at 4 °C in the cycler until removal for further processing.\nAfter PCR amplification, purify and analyze the products immediately, or store at +2 to +8 °C overnight. Alternatively, the product can be stored for up to 30 days at -30 to -16 °C.\n2. Purification of the PCR Products\nPreheat the incubator shaker to 65 °C.\nFor each PCR reaction, add 80 µL of 1x TE buffer (see the Table of Materials) to the 20 µL of each PCR product from section 1.\nTransfer the sample mixture into a PCR clean-up plate (see Table of Materials) using a multichannel pipette.\nKeep the plate uncovered and place it into the incubator shaker, and incubate at 65 °C while shaking at 1,200 rpm for 10 min.",
    "After incubation, set the vacuum instrument at 250 mbar (or 25 kPa, 188 mmHg, 7.4 in Hg) and aspirate the solution through the filter for 15 min. Wells should have no liquid remaining.\nCool the incubator shaker down to 25 °C.\nAfter the first aspiration, turn off the vacuum and add 50 µL of 1x TE buffer to each well. Do not mix. Aspirate the solution for 10 min using the vacuum settings in step 2.5.\nDry the bottom of the filter plate by pressing it firmly on a stack of paper towels.\nAdd 20 µL of 1x TE buffer into the bottom center of each well. Place the plate in the incubator shaker and incubate at 25 °C while shaking at 1,200 rpm for 5 min.\nAfter incubation, transfer >15 µL of each purified PCR DNA from step 2.9 to a fresh 96-well PCR plate. The purified DNA can be analyzed directly, or alternatively can be stored at -30 to -16 °C until required.\n3. Fragment Sizing of PCR Products\nPrior to starting, allow DNA dye concentrate, DNA gel matrix, DNA marker, DNA ladder and purified DNA samples from step 2 to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min.\nSet up the priming station.\nReplace the syringe (see Table of Materials) when using a new batch of reagents.\nAdjust the base plate, and release the lever of the syringe clip and slide it up to the top position.\nStart the sizing software (see Table of Materials) and prepare the gel-dye mix.\nVortex dye concentrate for 10 s and spin down. Add 25 μL of the dye to a gel matrix vial. Vortex the mixed solution well and spin down.",
    "Transfer the gel-dye mix to a spin filter. Place the spin filter in a microcentrifuge and spin for 10 min at room temperature at 1,500 x g ± 20%.\nNOTE: Protect the solution with dye from light and store at 4 °C after use. The gel-dye mix can be used for about 15 chips once prepared. Allow the gel-dye mix to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min each time before use.\nLoad the gel-dye mix.\nInsert a new DNA chip on the priming station. Add 9 μL of gel-dye mix into the well marked with “G”. Please ensure the plunger is positioned at the 1 mL mark and then close the priming station.\nPress the syringe plunger down until it is held by the clip. Wait for exactly 30 s then release the clip. Wait for 5 s, and then slowly pull the plunger back to the 1 mL position.\nOpen the priming station and add 9 μL of gel-dye mix into the wells marked with “G”.\nAdd 5 μL of marker into the well marked with the ladder symbol and also add 5 μL of marker into each of the 12 sample wells. Do not leave any wells empty.\nAdd 1 µL of DNA ladder into the well marked with the ladder symbol. Add 1 µL of PCR product (used wells) from step 3.1 or 1 µL of ultrapure water (unused wells) into each of the 12 sample wells. Put the chip horizontally in the adapter of vortex mixer and vortex for 1 min at the indicated setting (2,400 rpm).\nInsert the chip in the bioanalyzer instrument and run the chip in the instrument within 5 min.\nAfter the assay is complete, immediately remove the used chip from the instrument.",
    "Slowly add 350 μL of deionized water into one of the wells of the electrode cleaner. Open the lid of the bioanalyzer and place the electrode cleaner into it. Close the lid and incubate for about 10 s. Open the lid and remove the electrode cleaner. Wait another 10 s to allow the water on the electrodes to evaporate and then close the lid.\n4. Analyze the Fragment Sizing Results\nNOTE: The reference samples should be amplified and analyzed by the same thermal cycler and bioanalyzer in the same batch with the unknown samples.\nAfter the bioanalyzer run completes, export the peak data from each run as a .csv table file for subsequent analysis.\nStart the analysis software and open the exported .csv peak table file from step 4.1.\nThrough the QC menu tab, review the regression line fitted to the four points (shown as blue diamonds on the plot) from the two reference samples. The R2 value of the regression line should be >0.98 (typical values exceed 0.999).\nThrough the Results menu tab, check the repeat size of each sample whose fragment length(s) is automatically plotted against the linear regression standard curve derived from the reference samples. The software also provides the classification of each sample according to different guidelines.\nThrough the Export menu tab, export the result report for each sample with the repeat numbers and diagnostic classification, as well as a summary of sample information and QC report for each run.\nNOTE: Analysis software allows the use of custom classification guidelines, such as American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) or Clinical Molecular Genetics Society/ European Society of Human Genetics (CMGS/ESHG) guidelines, as well as predefined classification criteria.\nSubscription Required.
