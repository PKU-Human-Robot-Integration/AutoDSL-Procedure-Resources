    "The study was approved by the Competent Ethics Committee of Northwestern Switzerland (EKNZ 2015-079) and informed written parental consent for the participant was obtained before the measurement.\n1. Preparation\nMake sure the baby is settled. It should be quiet and settled, without sucking motions during the recording because of movement artefacts. The baby can be asleep9.\nMeasure the neonate's head circumference with a measuring tape to define the size of the EEG cap.\nIdentify the active electrode position: Cz / vertex position by marking the middle point between nasion and inion and the middle point between the left and right preaurical point with a skin marker pencil. For positioning the electrodes see also Figure 1.\nIdentify the positions of the ground electrode: right forehead (Fp2), and the reference electrode: left mastoid (A1).\nClean the electrode sites (Cz, Fp2 and A1) with disinfectant using a cotton swab. In case of a lot of hair, separate the hair to visualize the scalp.\nGently scrub the electrode sites with EEG prepping paste, using a cotton swab, to lower the impedance.\nPlace the EEG cap with the electrodes attached on the neonate's head.\nInject conductive EEG gel into the electrodes using a syringe with a short plastic needle to optimize the contact between the electrodes and the scalp.\nAdjust the electrodes until the impedance is below 50 kΩ as described in the manufacturer's recommendations and in published guidelines12.\nPosition a camera to record the neonate's facial expressions.\nConnect the flat-tip probe to the contact trigger device, which is fixed to the EEG recording device. When the flat-tip probe reaches the nominal force on the skin, a trigger signal is generated by the contact trigger device. This signal is sent to the computer, tagging the EEG recording with a trigger mark.\n2. Measurement",
    "Select a study name to store the data.\nAdd online band pass filters:\nDisplay filters:\n\t\tLow cutoff filter: Frequency: 1 Hz\n\t\tHigh cutoff filter: Frequency: 70 Hz\n\t\tNotch filter: 50 Hz\n\t\tSampling rate: 2000 Hz\nStart the EEG and video recording.\nHold the neonate's right hand in a horizontal position. The stimulus can also be applied on a different site, e.g. the foot, which will result in longer latency than from hand, please see for details 3.7.\nFirst record background EEG activity. Whilst the neonate's hand is held, annotate the EEG recording manually to record periods where no stimuli are applied and the infant is resting.\nConduct the required amount of flat-tip probe stimuli according to the study design on the neonate's right hand. In our experimental design, set the the number of flat-tip probe stimuli at 50. Be careful to use the flat-tip probe perpendicularly to the neonate's hand so the tip does not bend and the correct force is applied. Perform the flat-tip probe stimuli using a minimum of a 2 to 3 s inter-stimulus interval (ISI)6 to avoid summation.\nStop all the recordings.\nDocument the experimental setting details.\n3. Data Analysis\nFilter the raw EEG data offline using a high pass filter at 1 Hz and a low pass filter at 30 Hz.\nSegment the data in epochs of 1,500 ms (500 ms before to 1,000 ms after stimulus onset).\nPerform a baseline correction to the pre-stimulus interval.\nManually reject the EEG epochs containing artefacts, such as movement artefacts and noise, after visual inspection. Please see also the tutorial outline: https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Chapter_01:_Rejecting_Artifacts\nAverage the EEG epochs (for the background and stimulus response separately).",
    "Woody filter the data with a maximum jitter of ± 50 ms in the time window 0 - 1,000 ms post stimulus onset. This allows for latency differences between the infants. Do this for the background and stimulus responses separately.\nProject a template of noxious-evoked brain activity, that was defined in an independent dataset and has been described in detail elsewhere11 on to the data to ascertain the magnitude of the noxious-evoked response within each individual trial. The template describes a characteristic waveform of the noxious-evoked response and the magnitude reflects the amount of this noxious-evoked response within the individual trial.\n\tNOTE: The time window on which to project the template is dependent on the age of the infant and the stimulus position. If stimuli are applied to the hand then the time window of interest is 200 - 500 ms post stimulus11. If the stimuli are applied to the foot then the time window of interest is 400 - 700 ms post stimulus11. Note that this template has only currently been validated for infants between 34 - 43 weeks' gestation. For detailed methods associated with using this template, and a discussion of the limitations, please see Hartley et al. 201711.\nCheck that the magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity calculated using the template is significantly higher following the stimulus, compared with in the background EEG.\nAnalyze the behavioral facial expression afterwards (camera is linked to the EEG recording) using the Neonatal Facial Coding System2,13.\nSubscription Required.
