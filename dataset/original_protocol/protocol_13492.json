    "NOTE: The University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board determined that our study did not constitute human subject research. The local IRB obtained ethical approval and waiver of informed consent. Complete anonymization of imaging data was done before analysis per the hospital de-identification protocol.\n1. Data\nObtain a CT scan capturing the anatomy of interest for the planned task trainer. Be careful to take into consideration the working volume limitations of the 3D printer used and required landmarks for procedural steps.\nIf the scan is obtained in a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format (DICOM), convert to a Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NiFTi)15 format (.nii).\n2. Segmentation\nUse 3D Slicer software (http://www.slicer.org) to segment the CT images. Import the NIfTi file from Step 1.2 into 3D Slicer.\nSelect the Segment Editor module to generate the segments needed to model the trainer.\n\t\nAdd one segment for the 1) Bone and 2) Tissue components of the task trainer.\n\t\tNOTE: Development of some trainers, such as those used to train chest tube insertion, may require additional segments.\nSelect segment 1) Bone. Using the Threshold Effect, change the intensity range until the defined \"window\" range identifies the Bone component of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: For bone segments the usual range is between 100 and 175 HU (Hounsfield Units) to the available maximum value and for tissue, which is typically -256 HU to the available maximum.\nUse the Threshold function to highlight the 1) Bone component and apply it to the scan using the Apply command.\nUse the Scissors function to remove any areas of the scan not needed to create the task trainer. Use care to ensure that the bone marrow space remains hollow for IO trainers.",
    "NOTE: This step is the first reduction of the segment of interest to the desired dimensions of the trainer. The build volume limitations of the 3D printer to be used should be considered here; however the segment may be further reduced in section 3.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1-2.2.4 for the 2) Tissue component.\nUsing the Segmentations module; export each component as an STL file.\n3. 3D Modeling\nUse AutoDesk Meshmixer to crop the 3D segments further and reduce the resolution of each segment, in terms of the number of geometric elements, for optimal performance within Fusion360.\n\t\nConfirm that imported STL files have the correct triangle normal orientation. Ensure the normals of each triangle point in the direction of the outer surface of the mesh. If the triangle orientation is incorrect, flip the triangle normal by performing the Select | Modify | Select All function and then the Select | Edit | Flip Normals function.\nEliminate unwanted structures (e.g., unwanted segments of tissue or vasculature captured by the CT due to the use of contrast) of the imported STL Segments, and refine the models needed to create the task trainer. To refine the model by removing unwanted structures within the segments that may have been inadvertently included within the threshold range of the exported segment, use the Select operation, select the triangles on the undesired structures, then Edit | Discard.",
    "Following 3.1.2, use the Edit | Plane Cut tool to crop the model to fit within the confines of the 3D printer build volume. To reduce the computational overhead incurred due to excessive geometric resolution, reduce the number of triangles used to define the model to allow for optimal performance in Fusion360. Click on Select, double-click anywhere on the mesh to select the entire mesh, then Edit | Reduce. For Reduce Target, reduce to a Triangle Budget of under approximately 10,000 faces.\n\t\tNOTE: The printer currently used by the authors has a maximum build volume of 250 x 210 x 210 mm; thus the model was cut to a maximum long-axis length of 220-230 mm to allow the mold to fit within the printer's build volume. The printer's build volume should dictate the long-axis length by making the model approximately 20-30 mm shorter. The geometry can easily be reduced to ~10K triangles without loss of clinically relevant detail to develop high-fidelity task trainers.\nEliminate or reduce holes and surface irregularities using the Select tool. Once the triangles of the mesh around the defect are selected, use the command Select | Edit| Erase&Fill to improve surface holes and irregularities.Export and save the finished models using the STL file type.\n\t\tNOTE: The outer surface of the target bone for the interosseous line task trainers requires complete closing; otherwise, the melted tissue media will enter the marrow space and degrade the task trainer performance.\nUse AutoDesk Fusion360, and import the bone and tissue models by adding the .STL files into the workspace as a mesh using the Insert | Insert Mesh command.",
    "Convert the imported meshes into BRep solids by disabling the Fusion360 timeline and reducing the number of triangles in the target mesh to <10,000.Select the imported Mesh Body and right-click. Choose the Mesh to BRep option. After the meshes have been converted to BReps solids, resume the Fusion360 timeline.\nModify the solid to create the Task Trainer's mold by splitting the rectangular solid along the long axis of the Tissue BRep.\n\t\tNOTE: The mold is created around the Tissue BRep by using the sketch feature to build a cube or rectangular solid that encompasses the Tissue solid. The mold size should be modified to meet the maximum build volume of the selected 3D printer. As the mold is split in two, the longest dimension printed may not be the final mold's largest dimension as they are joined.\nSelect 2-3 locations for support pins, and place the pre-designed assembly group components to fix the task trainer's bones. Make sure that the locations selected for the support pins have an ample support structure in the bone around the head of the pin.\n\t\tNOTE: The bone around the pin head selected does not need to be perfectly uniform as the assembly group also contains a solid cylindrical support structure, which will be fused with the bone. This structure adequately supports the head of the pin and preserves correct anatomic placement of the bones within the tissue media.\nImport and position a bone plug onto the open marrow space of the Bone BRep to prevent tissue media from entering the marrow space, and keep the simulated bone marrow from draining out.\nGenerate an opening (typically 4-6 cm in diameter) through the molds in the space represented by the Tissue BRep solid to permit pouring the liquid tissue media into the mold.",
    "Once the components of the pre-designed assembly groups are positioned to fix the bones in space, perform Boolean Combine functions to either add or cut the various assembly groups into the models.\n\t\t\nPerform a mirror of the objects before step 3.2.6 to make the task trainer for the ipsilateral side. Repeat steps 3.2.3-3.2.5 before 3.2.6.\nExport the final components for printing. Select the desired body within the workspace and generate an STL file via right-click | Save As STL.\n4. 3D Printing\nUsing Simplify 3D, position the STL file on the bed of the 3D printer so that the slicing program may generate the GCODE required to print the item. Print the components with Poly-lactic Acid (PLA) 3D printer media filament using a 0.4 mm nozzle at a hot end temperature of 210 °C. Make sure that the settings utilize 4 top and bottom layers and 3 perimeter shells.\nOrient the bones vertically to minimize the required support material within the marrow cavity. Print using a raft, 0.2 mm layer height, 20% infill, and full support material (from the print bed and within the print). When printing the tissue molds, orient the mold components with the tissue surface facing up. Print the tissue molds without a raft, 0.3 mm layer height, 15% infill, and full support material.\nArrange the support pins and other components to minimize support material-print all pin support parts with a raft, 0.2 mm layer height, and 20% infill. Print the threaded components without support material at a reduced speed, to maximize the fidelity of the thread structures.",
    "Once each component's parameters are selected, prepare and export the GCODE file generated by Simplify 3D to an SD card.Using a Prusa i3 MK3, select the saved GCODE file from the SD card and print with 1.75mm PLA 3D printer media filament.\n5. Assembly\nPrepare the tissue medium.\n\tNOTE: The trainee's current level of skill mastery may dictate whether opaque or transparent tissue medium is required. Transparent medium allows the trainee to visually track their progress during IO insertion and more easily identify bony landmarks, while opaque medium better simulates actual clinical experience.\n\t\nMeasure the following components to be used to create the tissue media, and set aside (these quantities may be scaled as needed) 260 g of unflavored gelatin; if required, 140 g of finely ground psyllium husk fiber, orange-flavored, sugar-free (omit this step to create a transparent medium); 42 g of 4% w/v chlorhexidine.\n\t\tNOTE: Psyllium husk fiber may be used to make an opaque medium. This component should be added immediately after the gelatin if an opaque medium is desired16.\nHeat 1000 mL of water (tap is acceptable) to 85 °C.Add the water to a mixing container several times larger than the volume of ingredients, such as an 18.9 L bucket.\n\t\t\nWhile vigorously mixing the tissue medium solution, add the gelatin, psyllium husk fiber, and chlorhexidine solution to the water, in order, and wait before adding the next ingredient after the previous one is incorporated.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not add psyllium husk fiber if making transparent medium.\nHeat the mixture in a 71 °C water bath for a minimum of 4 h to allow the bubbles to dissipate from the solution. Place the mixing container in the hot water bath directly, or transfer the mixture to a separate container, such as plastic storage bags.",
    "Prepare the tissue medium for pouring into the assembled mold. Ensure that the mixture is homogeneous and fluid. Maintain the temperature of the mixture at 46 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: If the tissue medium is not immediately needed, it may be stored at 4 °C or -20 °C within a storage container until needed.\nPrepare the simulated bone marrow solution.\n\tNOTE: The simulated bone marrow solution may be prepared in advance and stored in a covered container at room temperature until ready for use.\n\t\nMeasure and thoroughly mix 100 g of cool water (tap is fine); 100 g of ultrasound gel; and 5 mL of red food coloring (optional, used to improve simulation). Ensure that the final product is thick but fluid enough to transfer quickly.\nSecure the bone to the bottom of the mold, and assemble the mold.\n\t\nSpray each side of the mold's inner surfaces with a non-silicone-based releasing agent, such as non-stick cooking spray.Secure the bone using the support pins to maintain the correct position within the tissue space. Secure the bones/pins to the bottom of the mold.\nAlign the top of the mold to the bottom portion, and secure the two halves of the mold together. Verify the bone plug is in position to prevent tissue medium entering the marrow space during pouring.\nPosition the mold such that the opening is facing up, and pour the 46 °C tissue medium into the mold's cavity.Remedy any leakage of the tissue medium from the mold using an inverted air duster canister by directly spraying the warm tissue medium with the canister to cool it quickly.Transfer the filled mold to a 4 °C refrigerator for a minimum of 6 h, or until the tissue medium has set.",
    "Disassemble the mold, and remove the task trainer and the support pins.Remove the bone plug, fill the marrow space with simulated 'bone marrow' created in 5.2, and replace the bone plug. Place the task trainers in a plastic storage bag, and store the assembly at either 4 °C or -20 °C until needed for training.\n6. Task training\nRemove the task trainer from storage and allow it to reach room temperature. If not already in place, add simulated bone marrow material from step 5.2 per instruction in 5.5.\n\tNOTE: Allowing the trainer to warm to room temperature improves the simulation experience.\nPerform training on the task trainers. Instruct the trainees to place IO needles (Figure 2A), and aspirate simulated bone marrow (Figure 2B) as per the IO line placement's usual steps.\nFollowing training, disassemble the task trainers to reclaim tissue, the medium, and the bones.\n\tNOTE: After manipulation, the bones of the IO trainer will have holes created by insertion of the IO line canula. These holes may be either filled with PLA using a handheld 3D printer pen, or alternately the bones may be discarded.\nReassemble and reuse reclaimed materials for subsequent training as per section 5.Alternatively, melt the tissue medium down, reclaim per 5.1.4, and store at either 4 °C or -20 °C, if not immediately needed.\nSubscription Required.
