    "How to make the probeInoculate starter culture with the BAC clone (e.g. glycerol stock) in 2-5 ml LB medium, containing the appropriate selective antibiotic (chloramphenicol).Incubate over-night 25/30 °C, shaking at 200 rpm.Dilute 0.5 ml of the starter culture in 500 ml selective LB medium (1/500 to 1/1,000), containing the appropriate antibiotic (chloramphenicol).Incubate over-night with shaking (200 rpm).Isolate the BAC-DNA using the Large-Construct Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Verify BAC identity by sequencing using 1 μg of isolated DNA and 20 pmol of SP6, T7 primers, respectively.Digest ~1 μg BAC-DNA with AluI restriction enzyme according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Suspend the digested BAC-DNA in sterile water to a final volume of 21 μl (BioPrime array CGH kit).Add 20 μl of 2.5x Random primers solution (BioPrime array CGH kit) to each sample and incubate at 95 °C for 5 min.On ice, add 5 μl of 10x dUTP Nucleotide Mix (BioPrime array CGH kit).Add 3 μl of Cy3-dUTP.Add 1 μl of Exo-Klenow fragment (BioPrime array CGH kit).Mix gently and perform a quick spin down (5 sec) and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h.Add 5 μl of Stop Buffer to each tube and place on ice (BioPrime array CGH kit).table:\n﻿0,1\nLabeling mix,\nReagent Added per Sample,Volume Added per Sample\n2.5x Random primers solution (BioPrime array CGH kit) and incubate at 95 °C for 5 min,20 µl\n\"On ice, 10x dUTP Nucleotide Mix\",5 µl\nCy3-dUTP,3 µl\nExo-Klenow fragment,1 µl\nMix gently and perform a quick spin down (5 sec) then incubate at 37 °C for 2 h,\nStop Buffer to each tube and place on ice (long term storage at -20 °C),5 µl",
    "Label the Micron tubes on both the lid and the side with sample identifiers, as the lids tend to break. Also label the side of the filter with an identifier.Load the Micron filter into the 1.5 ml tubes provided with the kit, so that the filter is sifting on the ridges inside the tube.Pipette 450 μl of TE 1x into each filter.Load the samples into the filters.Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Check the filter (visual inspection by eyes) to make sure the Cy3-Dye labelled DNA has stuck to it.Add 500 μl of TE to the filter and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 10 min.Discard the flow through and place in a new 1.5 ml filter tube upside-down to elute.Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min.Check the filter to make sure the entire sample is eluted from the filter (store samples short-term at 4 °C. Store long-term at -20 °C).Add 20 μl of Human Cot-1 DNA.Add 5 μl of CEP 6.Add 35 μl of hybridization buffer (keep in ice or store at -20 °C).How to prepare the tissuePretreat FFPE tissue microarrays or FFPE whole tissue sections (7 μm thick) 10 min in the Xylene-1 min in 100% EtOH-1 min in 90% EtOH-1 min in 70% EtOH-1 min in H2O.Continue pretreating the tissue sections for 15 min in the pre-warmed paraffin pretreatment reagent VP2000 (80 °C).Immerse the tissue sections for 1 min in the H2O.Immerse the tissue sections for 2 h into the pre-warmed 37 °C protease buffer (Protease 1 - 250 mg in 500 ml Protease Buffer).Immerse the tissue sections for 1 min in the H2O. Immerse the tissue sections for 1 min in the 70% EtOH-1 min in the 90% EtoH-1 min in the 100% EtOH-1 min in the H2O.",
    "Let the tissue section air-dry at room temperature for approximately 10 min.HybridizationApply 10-20 μl of the probe on the tissue sections and cover it.Apply the rubber cement to prevent the probe from leaking.Leave the tissue sections for 20 min at 75 °C.Incubate the tissue sections over-night at 37 °C.Uncover the tissue sections.Wash the tissue sections in the wash buffer at room temperature 5 min.Wash the tissue sections in the wash buffer, pre-warmed at 48 °C between 2-5 min (when you have background wash longer and with higher temperature).Immerse the tissue sections 1 min in the H2O.Let the tissue sections dry protecting it from the light.Add 10-20 μl of DAPI solution (1,000 ng/ml) to the tissue sections.Cover the tissue sections with cover glass 24 x 50 mm.Place the tissue sections 15 min at 4 °C.Evaluate the tissue sections using a fluorescence microscope (63x objective).Count a minimum of 100 tumor nuclei signals in four separate regions of the tissue section independently."
