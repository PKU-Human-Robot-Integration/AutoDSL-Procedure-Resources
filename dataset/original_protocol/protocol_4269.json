    "Axenic culture of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Work under sterile conditions when handling S. sclerotiorum cultures.Prepare fungal stock plate:Cut 2 agar plugs (0.5 x 0.5 cm) from the initial S. sclerotiorum-containing culture tube using a lancet.Place agar plugs in a Petri dish on malt-peptone-agar. Seal the plate with paraffin film.Let the fungus grow for 3 days at room temperature (RT) in the dark (Figure 2).Note: The mycelium should cover almost the whole surface of the plate.Store plate at 15 °C in the dark and reuse it for up to 3 months.Prepare fungal liquid culture:Prepare 1 L culture flasks containing 400 ml malt-peptone medium (25 flasks for 10 L culture).Cut agar plugs (0.5 x 0.5 cm) of fresh mycelium from the stock plate and inoculate each flask with 2 of them.Let fungus grow without shaking for 2-3 weeks at RT in the dark until the liquid surface is completely covered with mycelium.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140901/20140901004844_6711.jpgFigure 2. S. sclerotiorum growing on a malt-peptone-agar plate Freeze-drying of S. sclerotiorum culture filtratePut a nylon mesh into a laboratory funnel. Filter the culture medium through the mesh and collect it.Discard the mycelium.Poor the culture filtrate into basins and freeze-dry it in a front-loading lyophilizer for 3 to 4 days.Store freeze-dried material at RT in a hermetically closed 1 L laboratory bottle. Add a silica gel bag to keep the material dry. Re-suspension of the culture filtrateRe-suspend freeze-dried culture filtrate (e.g. 15 g dry weight) in a minimal volume (approx. 6 ml/g) of ice-cold buffer A in a 50 ml Falcon conical centrifuge tube.Centrifuge sample for 20 min at 10,000 x g and 4 °C.Collect the supernatant and keep on ice.Repeat steps C9-10 if necessary to remove all insoluble particles.Keep an aliquot of culture filtrate for subsequent activity assays in plants.Re-suspended culture filtrate may be stored at -20 °C.",
    "Note: Frozen concentrated culture filtrate is stable for at least one year. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles do not damage the sample.  Isolation of SCFE1: Rough fractionation by cation exchange chromatographyFor the isolation of SCFE1 from re-suspended culture filtrate, work with the ÄKTA Explorer liquid chromatography system cooled at 4 °C (in a cold lab chamber or cold room).All solutions for the chromatography should be prepared with ultrapure H2O, filtered through a bottle-top filter into clean, dust-free bottles and cooled at 4 °C. Pack a XK16/20 chromatography column from GE Healthcare with Sepharose SP Fast Flow matrix from GE Healthcare for cation exchange chromatography to around 15 ml column volume (CV). Note: For a small-scale purification (less than 5 g dry weight), 1 or 5 ml pre-packed Sepharose SP Fast Flow columns from GE Healthcare may be used.Wash column with 5 CV ultrapure H2O at a flow rate of 3 ml/min.Equilibrate column with 5 CV buffer A at a flow rate of 3 ml/min.Load re-suspended culture filtrate via the P-960 sample pump at a flow rate of 3 ml/min.Register flow, pressure, pH, conductivity, OD280 nm and OD215 nm during the run.Collect flow-through once OD280 nm increases and until loading is completed.Wash column with buffer A until OD280 nm and OD215 nm are back to the base line and stable.Elute in one step with 100% buffer B.Collect eluate into a 50 ml Falcon conical centrifuge tube using rack A for the fraction collector. Start collecting once OD280 nm exceeds 300 ma.u. (milli-arbitrary units) and stop when the end of the elution peak is reached.Wash column subsequently with 5 CV 2 M KCl, 5 CV ultrapure H2O, then 2 CV 20% ethanol for storage.",
    "Before proceeding to the second purification step, test activity of culture filtrate (CF), flow-through (FT) and eluate (S1) with the ethylene assay in Arabidopsis (see step F).Note: S1 should have the highest activity and contain most of SCFE1.Store S1 at 4 °C until next day or at -20 °C for more than 1 year. The flow-through may be discarded if the activity is successfully recovered in S1. Isolation of SCFE1: Refined fractionation by cation exchange chromatographyDilute S1 10-fold with buffer A.Install a pre-packed Source 15S 4.6/100 PE column from GE Healthcare for cation exchange chromatography.Wash column with 5 CV ultrapure H2O at a flow rate of 1ml/min.Equilibrate column with 5 CV buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.Load total volume of diluted sample via the P-960 sample pump at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.Note: The pressure on the column increases with time. The flow rate may be reduced progressively. Register flow, pressure, pH, conductivity, OD280 nm and OD215 nm during the run.Collect flow-through once OD280 nm increases and until loading is completed.Wash column with buffer A until OD280 nm and OD215 nm are back to the base line and stable.Elute with a linear gradient from 0% to 60% buffer B in 40 CV at a flow rate of 0.5 to 1 ml/min (see Figure 1B for a typical elution profile). Collect 0.5 ml fractions in 1.5 ml reaction tubes using rack B for the fraction collector (approx. 100 fractions, labeled F1-F100). Create a program for automated fractionation with the method wizard of the Unicorn software.Note: SCFE1 should elute at a salt conductivity value between 8 and 16 mS/cm.Wash column with 5 CV 100% buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Note: A small elution peak may appear.",
    "It does not need to be collected, as it does not contain any activity.Wash column with 5 CV water, then 2 CV 20% ethanol for storage.Note: If the pressure on the column remains higher than initially, it means that it was slightly clogged during sample loading and requires additional washing before reuse. In this case, follow the cleaning-in-place (CIP) procedure for Source 15S columns as described by the manufacturer.Test activity of flow-through (FT) and elution fractions (F1-F100) with the ethylene assay in Arabidopsis (see step F). Note: It is sufficient to test 1 fraction out of 5 for those with low OD280 nm and 1 fraction out of 2 for those corresponding to the elution peak.Store active fractions containing semi-purified SCFE1 at 4 °C for maximum 1 day or at -20 °C for more than 1 year. The flow-through may be discarded if the activity is successfully recovered in the elution fractions. Ethylene assayGrow Arabidopsis Col-0 plants on soil (GS90/vermiculite mixture 3.5: 1) for 5 to 6 weeks in a growth chamber: 8 h light/16 h dark, 23 °C, 40–60% relative humidity, 100 µmol m-2 s-1 light intensity (short day conditions).Choose the biggest leaves from the plants. Cut each leaf into 6 rectangular pieces using paper scissors. Omit the edges, tip and stalk. Float leaf pieces on dH2O in a Petri dish (Figure 3).Note: Prepare the leaf pieces 12 to 20 h before elicitation. Leaf pieces left for a longer time will not respond well to elicitation anymore. Leave leaf pieces over night in the closed Petri dish at RT or in an air-conditioned room. Pipet 0.5 ml dH2O into glass test tubes. Use 2 or 3 tubes per sample to test (for duplicate or triplicate measurements).Put 3 leaf pieces into each test tube using a spatula.",
    "Note: Leaf pieces may rest for a few hours in the test tubes or may be elicited immediately.Add 5 to 15 µl of the samples to test (CF, FT, S1 and/or selected fractions of F1-F100). Include an untreated control and a positive control (5 µl of 50 µM flg22 = 0.5 µM final concentration). Close test tubes with rubber stopper and carefully shake tube rack to mix. Note: Leaves should stay in the water or on the surface but not stick to the glass.Incubate for 3 to 4 h at RT. Measure the ethylene content in each tube:Prick through the rubber stopper of a tube using a 1 ml syringe with a needle. Mix the air inside the tube by moving up and down several times.Withdraw 1 ml air and inject it into the gas chromatograph. Record retention time and peak area to determine the amount of ethylene in pmol/ml air (see Figure 1C for representative data sets). Note: For the untreated control, an average value of 0.60 +/- 0.21 pmol/ml air is expected. The mean values for buffer A and B are 0.81 +/- 0.23 and 0.81 +/- 0.23, respectively. With 1.30 +/- 0.20 pmol/ml, the ethylene production in the flg22 control is expected to be around 2x higher than in the non-treated and 1.5x higher than in the buffer controls. The values for culture filtrate (CF) can range from 2.5 to 15 pmol/ml. As culture filtrate yields a higher ethylene response than flg22, an active culture filtrate sample from a previous purification (stored at -20 °C) may be used as additional positive control.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140901/20140901004859_5536.jpgFigure 3.
