    "All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Northwestern University, and all procedures were performed under IACUC-approved protocols.\n1. Preparation of enzymatic tissue-dissociation solutions\nUse two different enzymatic solutions (Solution 1 and Solution 2), both made using a basal culture medium solution (BM).\nTo prepare BM, add serum and penicillin-streptomycin to minimum essential medium to final concentrations of 10% and 1% respectively (see Table of Materials for specific reagents). Then sterile filter the BM through a 0.22 μm filter. Before use with cells, pre-equilibrate sterile BM to a neutral pH by dispensing into a culture dish and placing within a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for a minimum of 1 h.\n\tNOTE: BM can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week, after which fresh BM should be made.\nTo prepare collagenase I stock solutions, first dissolve 100 mg of collagenase I into 1 mL of sterile embryo grade H2O (final concentration 10% m/v), invert or swirl to dissolve, and store 20 μL aliquots at -20 °C for later use. Aliquots should be thawed only once.\nTo prepare deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) stock solutions, add 20 mg of DNase I into 1 mL of sterile embryo grade H2O (final concentration 2% m/v), invert or swirl to dissolve (do not vortex), and store 20 μL aliquots at -20 °C for later use. Aliquots should be thawed only once.\nFor hyaluronidase stock solutions, add 30 mg into 1 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS; final concentration 3% m/v hyaluronidase in PBS containing Ca++/Mg++), invert or swirl to dissolve, and store 100 μL aliquots at -20 °C for later use. Aliquots can be thawed and re-frozen several times without loss of enzymatic activity.",
    "To prepare dissociation Solution 1, add 10 μL collagenase I and 10 μL DNase I into 1 mL of sterile, pre-equilibrated BM (Final concentrations: 1 mg/mL collagenase I and 5 μg/mL DNase I). Triturate gently with a pipette to mix the solution, and pre-warm to 37 °C before use with the tissue.\n\tNOTE: Solution 2 is prepared by adding 33 μL of hyaluronidase (prewarmed to 37 °C) per 1 mL of Solution 1, (to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL). This occurs mid-way through enzymatic dissociation of testis tissue at step 2.5 below.\n2. Testis tissue dissociation\nNOTE: All mice were housed within polypropylene cages and provided with food and water ad libitum. Animals were fed irradiated chow which does not contain phytoestrogens. Juvenile CD-1 mice, 5 days post-partum (dpp), were used for all experiments and anesthetized prior to euthanasia and tissue collection, within an anesthesia chamber attached to an isoflurane vaporizer (2.5 L/min in O2). Mice were confirmed for full anesthesia via the absence of a response to toe-prick, after which mice were euthanized via decapitation.\nAnesthetize mice in an isoflurane chamber, ensure anesthesia via a toe-prick, and then decapitate the mouse using a sharp scissor. Place the euthanized mouse supine on a dissection mat and sterilize the abdomen with 70% ethanol. Tent the skin of the lower abdomen with forceps and open the abdomen with scissors.\nLocate the testes in the lower left and right inguinal regions of the abdomen. Cut their connections to the vas deferens and any anchoring connective tissue, then lift the entire testis (with epididymis still attached) from the animal. Place testes in a Petri dish of pre-equilibrated BM.",
    "Under a dissection microscope and within a sterile field, make a small incision in the tunica albuginea on one end of each testis with either a small microdissection scissor or by tearing gently using two fine forceps.\n\t\nThen, while holding the testis from the opposite end of the incision, gently squeeze the testis with fine forceps and push in a gentle sweeping motion towards the hole in the tunica; this will release the testicular tissue as one cohesive piece.\nCut the testes into smaller pieces (≤ 2 mm3) and place them into 1 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) dissociation Solution 1.\n\t\nIncubate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nFor more than 10 testes, increase the total dissociation solution volume by 1 mL, ensuring a minimum of 1 mL of dissociation solution per 10 testes (e.g., 2 mL for 20 testes, 3 mL for 30 testes, etc.).\nGently triturate the testis pieces 50 times (50x) in solution 1 using a P1000 pipette. Ensure that the tubules separate from one another and from interstitial tissue at this point. If clumps remain, incubate for an additional 5 min and triturate once more (50x).\nAdd 33 μL of hyaluronidase stock solution (pre-warmed at 37 °C, from step 1.5) per 1 mL of solution 1 dissociation mixture (containing the partially dissociated testicular tissue and tubules). After adding hyaluronidase, this is called solution 2.\n\t\nTriturate (50x) using a P1000 and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nTriturate (50x) using a P200 pipette.\nEnsure that at this point no visible tubules or clumps of cells are present. If clumps persist, incubate for up to 5 more min, with further trituration using a P200 pipette (50x).",
    "Quench the dissociation enzymes by adding fetal bovine serum (FBS) to 10% of the total volume of solution 2. Triturate several times using a P200 pipette to ensure no clumps remain, and filter through a 40 μm cell strainer to produce a single-cell suspension.\nCentrifuge cells at 100 x g for 7 min, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in fresh BM.\nCount the total and viable cell concentrations using trypan blue exclusion on a hemocytometer. Add 10 μL of 1:1 diluted, cell suspension: trypan blue solution, into the hemocytometer cell counting chamber (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nRe-centrifuge cells at 100 x g for 7 min and resuspend in fresh BM.\n\t\tNOTE: Only use viable cells for calculating cell concentration and number. Only use cell suspensions of ≥ 80% viability for generating organoids.\nPrepare the single cell suspension into cell concentrations as described in order to aliquot 280,000 cells given the volumes used in the protocol specific steps below in section 3: 2D ECM-Free – 0.56 x 106 cells/mL, 2D ECM – 0.56 x 106 cells/mL , 3D ECM-Free – 4.66 x 106 cells/mL, 3D ECM – 2.8 x 106 cells/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: All culture experiments presented here start with 280,000 cells seeded per culture well. These numbers are matched to the representative data in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4.\n3. Preparation of organoid culture dishes and seeding of cells",
    "NOTE: To ensure a homogenous ECM, pre-thaw frozen aliquots of ECM overnight before experimentation. ECM aliquots should be submerged within a bucket of ice within a 4 °C refrigerator or cold room to guarantee a slow, gradual increase in temperature. All ECM is used at a 1:1 final dilution in BM for culture. Keep thawed ECM and 1:1 diluted ECM on ice until immediately before use, otherwise the ECM might polymerize prematurely.\nFor 2D ECM-free culture, no special preparation is necessary, plate single cell suspensions (500 μL of 0.56 x 106 cells/mL in BM) directly onto 4- well chamber slides, and place into a 35 °C incubator for culture.\n\tNOTE: Cells should adhere to the bottom of the culture dish within the first 24 h of culture and may exhibit some small 3D cell clusters within this same time.\nFor 2D ECM culture, dispense 100 μL of cold 1:1 diluted extracellular basement matrix medium into a 4 well chamber slide, ensuring the gel covers the entirety of the dish bottom.\n\t\nPlace the chamber slide in a 35 °C incubator for a minimum of 30 min to allow the ECM to polymerize into a gel.\nAdd the cell suspension (500 μL of 0.56 x 106 cells/mL in BM) directly on the top of the 2D gel once it has polymerized.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells should cluster together to form small 3D clusters within the first 24 h of culture.\nFor 3D ECM-free culture, prepare agarose 3D Petri dish inserts before starting the cell culture.\n\t\nFirst, autoclave 1.5 g agarose powder in a 100 mL beaker, then add 75 mL sterile, distilled water and microwave to produce molten 2% agarose for 3D Petri dish casting.",
    "Within a sterile workspace, dispense molten agarose into the 3D Petri dish mold until the meniscus is level with the sides of the mold.\nAllow the agarose to cool and solidify. When solid, turn the mold upside down and gently flex repeatedly until the agarose 3D Petri dish falls free from the mold.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, one can prepare many agarose 3D Petri dishes and store them in sterile H2O or DPBS at 4 °C for upwards of one month.\nPrior to culturing, place agarose 3D Petri dishes into a 24 well culture dish, and cover them with 1 mL of BM. Let the 3D Petri dishes equilibrate in BM for at least 30 min within a 37 °C culture incubator. Discard the BM, and repeat the equilibration once more with 1 mL fresh BM. After equilibration of 3D Petri dishes in BM, they will appear the same color as the BM (i.e., pink).\nTo prepare for cell seeding, remove all BM from the well and dispense 200 μL of fresh BM around, but not inside the center recess of the 3D Petri dish. Also, collect any remaining BM from inside the center cell-seeding recess of the microwell insert.\nDispense the single cell suspension (4.66 cells/mL in 60 μL of BM) into the center recess of the agarose 3D Petri dish. Gently triturate up and down to mix cells and guarantee a single cell suspension at the start of culture.\nPlace into in a humidified 35 °C incubator for culture. The following day, remove the 200 μL of BM from around the microwell insert, and replace with 1 mL of fresh BM. This will bring the liquid level above the plane of the insert, submerging the entire culture.",
    "Slowly and carefully remove/add media from outside of the agarose 3D Petri dish. The organoids should have compacted overnight, allowing them to rest at the bottom and enabling media changes to leave organoids undisturbed.\nFor 3D ECM culture, prepare a single cell suspension by combining, in equal parts, the cell suspension in BM with cold, pre-thawed ECM (final concentration = 2.8 x 106 cells/mL).\n\t\nImmediately dispense the cell-ECM mixture into a 4 well chamber slide, ensuring the mixture covers the entire bottom of the plate.\nPlace the chamber slides at 35 °C in an incubator and allow its contents to polymerize. This should take at least 30 min. After the polymerization, add 500 μL of BM on the top of the culture.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells should have clustered together to form small 3D aggregates within the first 24 h of culture.\n4. Organoid maintenance\nCulture all organoid model types at 35 °C. For All culture types exchange half of their media with fresh BM every 2 days. To ensure that organoids are not accidentally collected while exchanging medium, always collect media slowly from a corner of the chamber slide dish, and from an external point outside of agarose 3D Petri dishes. All media can be stored at -20 °C for use with immunoassays or other analyses later (i.e., quantification of secreted reproductive hormones or cytokines).\nAfter 7 days in culture, use BM containing follicle stimulating hormone (final concentration 20 mIU/mL) and human chorionic gonadotropin (final concentration 4.5 IU/mL). This applies to all organoid culture types.\nRoutinely image all organoid cultures (i.e., time-lapse imaging) for characterizing organoid formation and quantifying metrics of self-assembly, development, and growth over time.\n5. Organoid Collection",
    "NOTE: All organoids can be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for downstream immunolabeling and histological analyses. Fix for 2 h at room temperature with rotation, or overnight at 4 °C.\nFor 2D ECM-free cultures, first rinse the sample with fresh PBS, and then add fixative directly on top of the adhered constructs.\nFor ECM (2D and 3D) culture methods, rinse once with PBS, and then either add fixative directly on the top of the ECM-organoid sample (to fix the ECM gel and organoids together), or alternatively, gently pipette the organoids up and down to free them from the surrounding ECM, and transfer to a separate tube for fixation.\nFor 3D ECM-free culture, gently pipette the organoids up and down within the center recess of the agarose 3D Petri dish; this will flush the organoids out facilitating their easy collection with a pipette. Then transfer organoids to a separate tube for fixation.\nBefore processing into paraffin, embed many organoids (≥ 20) within a small volume (~ 30 μL) of tissue processing gel; this helps orient and concentrate organoids into a small area within paraffin blocks, facilitating easier observation when sectioning and easier visual identification within paraffin sections.\n\tNOTE: Organoids can be challenging to identify after paraffin embedding and sectioning upon a microtome.\nSubscription Required.
