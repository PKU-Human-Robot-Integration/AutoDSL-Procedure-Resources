    "Ethics Statement: The experimental procedures were approved by the animal ethics committee of Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology Laboratory Animal Center, National Science Council, Republic of China (Tainan, Taiwan).\n1. Constructing the Running Wheel Structure\nNOTE: All acrylic should be transparent. Wash the disassembled wheel with water, then use alcohol to wipe the rubber track and acrylic sheets after each use.  \nObtain an acrylic running wheel to be 55 cm in diameter and 15 cm in width.\n\tNOTE: This wheel is larger than a traditional running wheel (diameter = 35 cm; width = 12 cm) (Figure 1A).\nUsing a cutter, cut a quarter-circle opening into one side of the running wheel to act as an entrance and an exit as well for rats (Figure 1B). Place a layer of high-friction rubber track on the inside of the acrylic wheel (Figure 1B).\nPlace an iron rod with bearings to connect the running wheel (Figure 1B). Place two acrylic triangular columns on either side of the running wheel to act as the support frame (Figure 1B).\nAttach a 1 mm thick semicircular, transparent acrylic sheet to the external sides of the two triangular columns using screws. Use this sheet to deploy the infrared sensors. Ensure that the acrylic sheets are approximately 3 cm away from each side of the running wheel.\n2. Deploying the Infrared Sensors and Defining the Effective Exercise Area\nNOTE: Take into account the running wheel size and the rat length in the design of an infrared system. A rat only triggers a single sensor at a time. In this experiment, rats are between 20 and 23 cm long.",
    "Drill a hole in the acrylic sheets every 45° (arc interval = 21 cm), with the distance between two holes being roughly equivalent to the length of a test rat. Make the holes the same size as the infrared sensors (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: For traditional MRWs, drill a hole every 70° (arc interval = 21 cm, Figure 2B).\nDuring a PRW experiment, maintain the rats at a steady state of running between 0° to 135°.\n\tNOTE: Thus define this area as the effective exercise area, while view all the other sections as the ineffective exercise areas. For traditional MRWs, define the effective exercise area as the portion between 0° to 140° (Figure 2B).\n3. Driving the Running Wheel\nUse a brushless DC motor and a motor driver to drive the running wheel.\nMount a 10 cm diameter rubber disk on the motor’s central axis (Figure 1B).\nUsing the iron frame and springs to support the motor, connect the rubber disk from the motor’s central axis to the outer side of the running wheel.\n\tNOTE: The springs must cooperate with the screws to allow dynamic motor height adjustments and to prevent rubber disk from being disconnected to the running wheel track because of loose springs.\nOperate the motor to drive the 10 cm diameter rubber disk using a microcontroller, and observe the wheel rotate due to the friction between the rubber disk and the runway of wheel, creating a motorized running wheel platform.\nMount four infrared sensors sequentially between 0° to 135° (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: For traditional MRWs, mount sensors between 0° to 140° (Figure 2B).\nConnect four pairs of infrared sensors mounted in both acrylic sheets to the microcontroller’s general pins using single core cables, thereby forming a positioning running wheel system.\n4. Constructing an Adaptive Acceleration Curve",
    "Three days before the commencement of official 3 week exercise training, train rats by manually operating the running wheel.\n\tNOTE: The goal is to allow the rats to become familiar with the running environment, and is to test whether each rat can endure running at 20 m/min.\n\t\nDuring the manually operated training, gradually accelerate the running speed until a rat is unable to keep pace. When this occurs, decrease the speed until the rat regains a steady running pace, and then gradually increase the speed again until the rat reaches 20 m/min (dashed lines in Figure 3). The manual training involves seven rats to construct the training curves.\nUsing a numerical equation to fit the measured data on Day 3 of the manual testing, calculate the acceleration curves closest to the manual training (the curve with circles, Figure 3). Fit Equation 1 to raw data, where Cini = 8, Cfin = 20 and τ = 30 represent the initial velocity, the final velocity and the time constant, respectively).\n\tNOTE: This equation adapts to a rat’s body condition. Therefore, refer to the calculated curve as an adaptive acceleration-training model.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54354/54354eq1.jpg  (1)\nUse Equation 1 for Week 1 of the formal training.\nFor Weeks 2 and 3 of the training, adjust the parameters of Equation 1, that is to say, change A from 12 to 22, to allow the speed to reach 30 m/min.\n5. Controlling the Software Program\nNOTE: Exclusively develop a code for the microcontroller-based motor operation and for signal transmission from the infrared sensors to a computer for subsequent data analysis.\nUse C programming language to write a software control program containing one main program and two interrupt-service routines for the timer in the microcontroller18.",
    "Ensure that the main program initializes the microcontroller’s register and constructs an adaptive acceleration curve model in the microcontroller’s memory.\nUse the interrupt-service routine of Timer 0 to activate the adaptive acceleration curve and calculate the entire training duration.\nUse the interrupt-service routine of Timer 1 to extract the signal data from the infrared sensors and to transfer the data to the computer.\nUse the main program to record the position of 0o to adjust the speed of running wheel.\nOnce the receiving IR sensor at 0° is triggered, interpret it as a fall incidence, which is accumulated by the main program. The moment the occurrence times of fall incidences hits the 10% threshold of the number of the rat position detections, deaccelerate the running wheel automatically as a safety measure for trained rats. NOTE: The speed of running wheel is reduced until the rat can return to the safe zone (0o to 135o) and maintain a stable running state for the safety measure.\n6. Operating the Positioning Running Wheel System\nTurn on the microcontroller and wait for an operator to press the button to start each week’s training model.\n\t\nPress the “Start” button to begin the training model for Week 1.\n\t\tNOTE: The motor automatically accelerates based on the adaptive acceleration curve until it reaches 20 m/min, and automatically stops after 30 min.\nPress the “Start” button to begin the training model for Week 2.\n\t\tNOTE: The motor automatically accelerates based on the adaptive acceleration curve until it reaches 30 m/min, and automatically stops after 30 min.\nPress the “Start” button to begin the training model for Week 3.\n\t\tNOTE: The motor automatically accelerates based on the adaptive acceleration curve until it reaches 30 m/min, and automatically stops after 60 min.",
    "NOTE: Throughout the entire training process, transmit the signal data received from the infrared sensors to a computer wirelessly.\nUsing a computer, analyze the location data to obtain an effective exercise measure for the entire exercise process (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54354/54354eq2.jpg). See Equation 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54354/54354eq3.jpg  (2)\n\tNOTE: EEE, EED and IED represent the effective exercise measure, the effective and ineffective exercise durations, respectively.\n7. Training the Rats\nRandomly divide adult male Sprague-Dawley rats into five groups (n = 9 for each group): the sham, control, treadmill, MRW and PRW groups.\nConduct a 3 week exercise training for the three exercise groups, i.e. the treadmill, MRW and PRW groups, while do not for the sham and the control groups.\n\tNOTE: The 3 week exercise training for each exercise group is 20 m/min for 30 min during Week 1, 30 m/min for 30 min during Week 2 and 30 m/min for 60 min during Week 3.\n8. Animal and Stroke Model\nAs stated in Sec. 7.1, randomly divide all the involved adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing between 250-280 g, into 5 groups.\nWeigh all the animals to ensure accurate drug dosage calculations. Anesthetize the rats with sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and a mixture containing ketamine (4.4 mg/ kg, intramuscularly [i.m.]), atropine (0.02633 mg/kg, [i.m.]) and xylazine (6.77 mg/kg, [i.m.]).\n\t\nAssess the anesthetic depth by monitoring the breathing rate (normal 70-115 breaths/min), rhythm, depth of respiration, mucous membrane color and regular testing of reflexes, e.g. toe pinch, tail pinch, eyelid/eyelash and palpebral.\nInsert temperature probes into the rectum, and maintain the rectal temperatures between 37 to 37.5 °C using separate heating lamps.\nInduce focal ischemia, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by inserting a filament into the internal carotid artery to occlude the orifice of the middle cerebral artery via external carotid artery approach19.",
    "Perform the same operating procedures on the sham-operated animals, while do not insert a filament into the internal carotid artery. Maintain focal cerebral ischemia for 1 hr, remove the filament, close the incision, and then leave 1 cm of the nylon suture protruding, which could be withdrawn to allow reperfusion.\nAdminister subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of an analgesic (buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.)), into the animals for analgesia twice a day for 3 days.\n9. Assessing Neural Damage\nEvaluate neurological and motor functions, respectively, by the neurological severity score (mNSS)20 and an inclined plane test21.\n\tNOTE: mNSS is a composite of the motor (muscle status, abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile and proprioceptive) and reflex tests. Give one point for failure to perform a task. Rate neurological function on a scale of 0-18 (normal score = 0; maximal deficit score = 18).\nAssess all the rats in terms of behavioral performance the day before and daily over a time span of 7 days after the surgery.\nMeasure the hind limb grip strength of the rat using an inclined plane.\n\t\nPlace rats on the inclined climbing apparatus on a daily basis, and acclimatize the rats to the apparatus and the testing conditions 1 week before testing.\nPlace each rat on the apparatus and encourage the rat to climb the platform until the top of the apparatus during the acclimatization period.\nPlace the rat at the top of the apparatus with the head downward during testing. Ensure that the body axis of the rat stays along to a 20 x 20 cm2 rubber ribbed surface on the inclined plane starting at an angle of 25°.",
    "Increase the angle dynamically using a ball screw connected with a stepper motor to determine the maximal angle at which an animal could hold to the plane. Increase the angle of the inclined plane gradually until the mouse failed to hold on the inclined plane, and then detect a sliding down event. The baseline degree of inclined plane is 25° in the beginning.\nAsk two observers (unaware of what treatment the rats had been given), to independently examine and score all the behavioral tests, i.e. the mean of the left- and right-side maximal angles.\nSacriﬁce all the animals on day 7 after MCAo. Perfuse the hearts of the animals under deep anesthesia (sodium pentobarbital 100 mg/kg, i.p.) with saline22. Remove and then immerse the brain tissue in cold saline for 5 min, which is then sliced into 2.0 mm coronal sections using a tissue slicer22.\nSubmerge the fresh brain sections into 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 °C for 30 min, then transfer the slices to 5% formaldehyde solution for ﬁxation at 4 °C for 24 hr. Place the stained brain slices on a plexiglas holder.\nPhotograph the TTC-stained slices with a calibrated scale using a CCD camera linked to a personal computer loaded with image processing software. Use a semi-automated image analysis system as well to estimate the infarcted area (mm2) from each TTC-stained brain slice23.\nCalculate the total infarct volume for each slice by summation of infarcted areas of all brain slices. Mark the unstained area (ischemic brain) separately on each side of 2 mm thick slices, then calculate the infarct volume and the mean value.\nCalculate the corrected infarct volume (CIV) as\n\tCIV= {LT- (RT- RI)} imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54354/54354eq4.jpg d (3)",
