    "1. Tumor Model\nCulture  H460 cells (American Type Culture Collection) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented  with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Life  Technologies). It should be noted that the choices of cell lines, culture  mediums, locations of inoculation, number of xenografts per mouse, and other  considerations are all to be tailored to the goals of a particular study. Here  we will only present one specific project design to serve as an illustration.\nMaintain  cell lines in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and change  to fresh medium every other day.\nWhen  a 75% confluent monolayer of cells is formed, detach the monolayer with trypsin  and dissociate cells into a single-cell suspension for further cell culture.\nSuspend  approximately 1 × 106 H460 cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen)  and implant subcutaneously in both left and right shoulders of nude mice  (female athymic nude mice (nu/nu), 4  - 6 weeks old, Charles River Laboratories, Inc.). \nAllow  tumors to grow to 150 - 200 mm3. It takes approximately 2 weeks for  H460 tumor xenografts to grow to this size. Standard caliper measurement is  carried out to track tumor sizes.\nWhen  tumors reach the ideal size the tumor bearing mice are now ready for treatment  and in vivo imaging via both PET and  CLI.\n2. PET",
    "Perform the PET  studies according to this schedule or any variation of it depending on the  specific project (Figure 1)12. A number of factors could influence the design  of the schedule, including, but not limited to, choice of tumor xenograft cell  lines, anticancer drugs, and dosing regimens. Here we will only present one  specific imaging schedule. The CLI studies are to be performed according to the  same schedule as those of the PET studies, with CLI performed immediately after  the corresponding PET. It should be also noted here that the purpose of the PET  studies is mainly for validation of the CLI results. For common users who just  wish to use OI instruments for imaging radiolabeled probes, no PET is  necessary. However, if one does desire PET validation it should be stressed  that PET and CLI instruments must be located within very close proximity for the  validation to be successful because of the short half life of 18F  (109.77 min).\nDivide  mice into treatment and control groups (n ≥ 3 each). Treat mice in the treatment group with 2 injections of bevacizumab  of 20 mg/kg at days 0 and 2. Day 0 is defined by the first injection. Note that  at Day -1 a pre-scan should be performed via both PET and CLI.\nSmall-animal  PET of tumor-bearing mice is to be performed with an R4 rodent model scanner  (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.).\nAnesthetize  all mice with 2% isoflurane (Aerrane; Baxter) and inject with 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine  (18F-FLT; 7.3  - 8.0 MBq [198 - 215 μCi]) via the tail vein. The PET probe is to be diluted in  PBS before injection. \nAfter  1 hr, anesthetize mice again and place anesthetized mice prone and near the  center of the field of view of the small-animal PET scanner.",
    "Obtain  three-minute static scans and reconstruct the images by a 2-dimensional  ordered-subsets expectation maximum algorithm. Background correction is not  necessary.\nDraw  regions of interest (ROIs; 5 pixels for coronal and transaxial slices) over the  tumors on the decay-corrected whole-body coronal images. Obtain the maximum counts per pixel per minute from  the ROIs and convert to counts per milliliter per minute by use of a  calibration constant. With the assumption of a tissue density of 1 g/ml,  convert the ROIs to counts per gram per minute. Determine image ROI-derived  %ID/g values by dividing counts per gram per minute by injected dose. Attenuation  correction is not necessary.\n3. CLI\nCLI is to be  performed with an IVIS Spectrum system (Caliper Life Sciences). Acquisition and  analysis of images are to be carried out using Living Image 3.0 software  (Caliper Life Sciences). Wavelength-resolved spectral imaging is to be  performed using an 18-set narrow-band emission filter (490 - 850 nm). Again,  for each mouse, perform CLI immediately after PET to minimize the amount of  radioactive decay if the PET studies are included in the protocol.\nPlace animals in a  light-tight chamber under isoflurane anesthesia. Multiple mice can be placed  simultaneously to increase throughput.\nAcquire images using 3 min exposure time (f/stop=1, binning=4). Use the same illumination settings (lamp  voltage, filters, f/stop, fields of view, binning) to acquire all images. Use  the dorsal skin area to calculate the signal intensity of background tissue.  Normalize fluorescence emission to photons per second per centimeter squared  per steradian (p/s/cm2/sr).\n4. Representative Results",
    "Visual  comparison between CLI and PET images can be easily carried out. After unifying  the scale bar across images from the same modality and place CLI and PET images  side by side one can see in this representative panel (Figure 2A) that both CLI and PET revealed significantly decreased  signals from H460 xenografts in treated mice from pre-treatment to day 3, suggesting  significant therapeutic effect. As a comparison, moderately increased to  unchanged signals were observed in untreated mice during the same time period  (data not shown). By visual inspection alone one can observe that there is a good  consistence between tumor contrasts that are visualized from CLI and PET. In  fact, this visual correlation has sufficient resolution to show central  necrosis of the tumor secondary to the anticancer treatment regimen (please  compare the CLI and PET images from Day 3). To validate the imaging findings  quantifications and correlation analysis can be carried out.\nQuantifications  of CLI and PET images and a simple fitting via linear regression showed that  the two modalities indeed had an excellent correlation (Figure 2B, R2=0.9309  for 18F-FLT probed treatment group). Notably, in all of our CLI and  PET imaging studies with different tumor models and different anticancer drugs  the slopes of the fits are also remarkably close, thus suggesting an excellent  fit of linear regression even of all data are conglomerated (data not shown).  Both representative images are adapted from our previous publication12.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4341/4341fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic  of experimental design of PET and CLI studies. Tumors were implanted  bilaterally in shoulder region and allowed to grow to 150-200 mm3,  and tumor-bearing mice were subjected to in  vivo  imaging via PET and CLI at day -1, 1, and 3. Bevacizumab treatment was  performed by 2 injections of 20 mg/kg at days 0 and 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4341/4341fig2.jpg",
