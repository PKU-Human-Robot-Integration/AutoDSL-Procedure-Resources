    "All aspects of this protocol fall within our institutions ethical guidelines of the human research ethics committee\n1. Pre-operative planning\nEvaluate the patient pre-operatively.\n\tNOTE: Patients present generally with vague abdominal complains and will be diagnosed primarily by imaging studies. This patient is a 65 year old Caucasian female presented with vague abdominal pain and underwent several CT imaging studies, eventually resulting in a diagnosis of pancreatic mass involving the body of the pancreas and abutting the common hepatic and splenic arteries (Figure 1).\nPreoperative Imaging and Biopsy\n\t\nProceed initially with cross-sectional imaging to diagnose the mass and identify anatomical relationships, arterial/venous involvement, and any aberrant arterial and venous anatomy. Once identified, proceed with biopsy for tissue diagnosis, if the mass is accessible. This patient's lesion was biopsied during EUS and confirmed as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nCarefully note and consider any aberrant arterial anatomy or portosplenic confluence aberrancies and involvement of additional structure outside of the celiac axis prior to pursuing surgical resection.\nConsider preoperative therapy.\n\tNOTE: Many different preoperative treatment protocols are available for treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Patient tolerance and standards of practice at various institutions can guide therapy. In the case of our patient, she was initially started on FOLFIRINOX, but after significant intolerance requiring hospitalization, she was ultimately transitioned to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and completed 6 months of treatment.\nRepeat imaging and serum studies.",
    "Consider follow up imaging to evaluate treatment response prior to moving forward with resection. Serum studies, such as CA 19-9, will additionally help evaluate treatment response. In our patient, imaging demonstrated a promising treatment response as well as a 94% reduction in her serum CA 19-9 levels. However, she continued to have persistent soft tissue infiltration of her celiac axis on repeat imaging (Figure 2). As a result, she was scheduled for a robotic DP-CAR.\n2. Initial Operative Steps: Diagnostic Laparoscopy and Robot Docking\nBegin with a diagnostic laparoscopy to ensure no evidence of metastatic disease.\nOnce no metastatic disease is confirmed, place the remainder of the ports and dock the robot from the right side of the operating table.\n\tNOTE: Several variations of port placement have been successfully utilized. However, our approach utilizes 4 robotic ports across the upper abdomen, two assistant ports and a liver retractor. A skilled bedside assistant is critical to successful completion of the procedure, utilizing the two assistant ports for operating the bipolar vessel sealing device, suction, and endovascular stapler.\n3. Robot-Assisted Dissection\nOpen lesser sac and mobilize stomach along greater curve.\n\t\nFollowing robot docking, proceed with opening the lesser sac with electrocautery and bipolar vessel sealer.\nCompletely mobilize the greater curve of the stomach with care to avoid sacrificing the gastroepiploic vessels (Figure 3).\nCauterize the short gastric arteries with vessel sealing device to the level of the diaphragm. Then retract the stomach and liver edge cephalad to allow for dissection of the porta hepatis.\nIdentify hepatic arterial anatomy and assess for adequate retrograde flow into proper hepatic artery and liver through the gastroduodenal artery.\n\t\nAfter cephalad retraction of the stomach and liver, identify the porta hepatis. Dissect and isolate the hepatic artery node (Station 8a) for removal and permanent pathological evaluation.",
    "At this time, carefully dissect and identify the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). Evaluate for adequate retrograde flow through the GDA into the hepatic circulation with intra-operative Doppler ultrasound.\nIdentify pulsatile flow in the liver and GDA before and after clamping of the common hepatic artery (Figure 4).\nDissect the inferior border of the pancreas and create a retropancreatic tunnel.\n\t\nAfter identification of adequate retrograde flow through the GDA, dissect along the inferior border of the pancreas. Continue dissection with electrocautery and bipolar vessel sealer to identify the superior mesenteric vein.\nCreate a retropancreatic tunnel over the vein with a sufficient margin from the tumor (Figure 5).\nDivide the pancreas and continue the retropancreatic dissection to divide the splenic vein and coronary vein.\n\t\nDivide the pancreas with an endovascular stapler. Mobilize the inferior and posterior border of the pancreas laterally with electrocautery and bipolar assisted dissection.\nDivide the splenic vein and coronary vein to assist in visualization of arterial anatomy and retraction. Additionally, the inferior mesenteric vein may be ligated if it inserts into the splenic vein.\nDivide the hepatic artery and expose the superior mesenteric artery.\n\t\nTurn attention back to the hepatic artery and continue dissection to fully delineate the anatomy if required. Divide the hepatic artery proximal the gastroduodenal artery (Figure 6).\nOnce the hepatic artery is divided, retract the specimen laterally and continue to mobilize the pancreas to expose the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).\nIdentify and trace the superior mesenteric artery to its root on the aorta.\n\t\nOnce the SMA is identified, dissect cephalad along the superior border to trace it back to the origin on the aorta (Figure 7). Continue the dissection cephalad with electrocautery and bipolar cautery through dense connective tissue.",
    "Dissect cephalad from the root of the SMA through dense connective tissue, nerve bundles, and lymphatic tissue until muscle fibers from the diaphgramatic crura are identified.\n\t\nDuring this en bloc mobilization of the tissue overlying the superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis as well as the final lateral dissection, sample lymph node stations 14, 16 and 18.\nLigate the left gastric artery near its origin with an endovascular stapler to maximize collateral blood flow to the stomach.\nExpose and divide the celiac axis.\n\t\nContinue retracting the sample to the patient's left and dissect through the crural muscle fibers until the origin of the celiac axis is visualized (Figure 8). It is of utmost importance to maintain sufficient lateral retraction on the specimen to rotate the celiac axis to the left of the patient. This will facilitate ligation of the celiac trunk by providing a favorable angle for the endovascular stapling device.\nContinue retroperitoneal dissection laterally to fully mobilize pancreas and spleen and remove specimen.\n\t\nContinue the retroperitoneal dissection laterally with a combination of hook and bipolar cautery. Remove the specimen through the left lower quadrant incision, which can be extended if necessary. A detailed view of the final resection bed vascular anatomy is available in the supplementary figures (Figure 9).\nComplete a final intra-operative ultrasound of the proper hepatic artery continues to demonstrate pulsatile, triphasic flow in the artery and parenchyma of the liver. Evaluate the stomach for external signs of ischemia.\nOnce a final inspection is completed, undock the robot, and close the fascia and skin. The procedure is complete.\nSubscription Required.
