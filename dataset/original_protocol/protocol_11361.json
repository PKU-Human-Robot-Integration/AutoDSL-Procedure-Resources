    "1. Preparation of Plasmids for the Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay\nUse the following plasmids: pG5-Luc, pBIND-ERαEF, and pACT-ERαEF.\n\tNOTE: The plasmids are available from the authors upon request and are sent on filter paper. pG5-Luc is the reporter plasmid that contains five repeats of GAL4 responsive elements fused with the luciferase expression unit (Figure 1A). pBIND-ERαEF is the protein expression plasmid for GAL4DBD-fused ERα LBD proteins. pBIND-ERαEF contains a Renilla luciferase expression unit for normalizing the transfection efficiency (Figure 1B). pACT-ERαEF is the protein expression plasmid for the VP16AD-fused ERα LBD proteins (Figure 1C). The diagram of the expressed protein structure from the plasmids is shown in Figure 2.\nPrepare plasmid DNAs.\n\t\nCut out the plasmid-loaded area from the paper using clean scissors and put it into a 1.5 mL tube. Wear gloves and use clean tweezers to pick up the plasmid-loaded paper. Add 100 µL of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (pH 8.0) and vortex well.\nAdd 1 µL of the plasmid DNA solution from step 1.2.1 to competent Escherichia coli cells (see Table of Materials) and keep the tube on ice for 15 min.\nHeat-shock the plasmid-added competent cells; incubate the tube(s) in 42 °C water bath for 30 s and, then, keep them on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 250 µL of super optimal broth with catabolite repression (SOC) medium (room temperature) to the tube(s) and culture with shaking at 37 °C for 30 min.\nPlate 100 µL of the cultured E. coli onto a prewarmed Luria broth (LB) plate with 100 µg/mL ampicillin (10 cm-diameter dish) and culture at 37 °C overnight.\nPick one colony from the plate and add it into a 14 mL tube containing 2 mL of terrific broth (TB) with 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Culture with shaking at 37 °C until the medium is faintly clouded.",
    "Add 1 mL of the cultured medium from step 1.2.6 to an autoclaved 250 mL glass flask containing 50 mL of TB with 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Culture with shaking at 37 °C for 20 - 24 h.\nTransfer the cultured E. coli to a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 3,450 x g at room temperature for 30 min using the swing-bucket rotor. Discard the medium. Save the E. coli pellet at -80 °C.\nAdd 3 mL of cell resuspension solution (see Table of Materials) to the E. coli pellet and suspend it completely. Add 3 mL of cell lysis solution (see Table of Materials), mix the tube gently by inverting it 10x, and keep it on ice for 5 min (keep the time punctually). Add 6 mL of neutralization solution (see Table of Materials), mix the tube steadily with tapping, and then, keep it on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the tube at 3,450 x g at 4 ˚C for 30 min using the swing-bucket rotor. Transfer the DNA-containing solution to a new 50 mL conical tube and add 10 mL of DNA purification resin (see Table of Materials). Suspend the resin gently.\nCentrifuge the tube at 625 x g for 1 min using the swing-bucket rotor. Discard the solution and keep the resin at the bottom.\nAdd 15 mL of column wash solution (80 mM potassium acetate, 8.5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 40 µM EDTA, and 55% ethanol) to the 50 mL conical tube and shake it gently to suspend the resin. Repeat step 1.2.11.\n\t\tNOTE: The column wash solution must be prepared using diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water or nuclease-free water.",
    "Add 5 mL of column wash solution to the 50 mL conical tube and suspend the resin with a 5 mL pipet. Apply the resin to the column (see Table of Materials) that is set on the vacuum manifold. Vacuum the column until the resin dry. Add 6 mL of column wash solution to the column and vacuum.\nOnce the resin dries visually, detach the reservoir from the column. Transfer the bottom section of the column (resin) to a 1.5 mL tube. Centrifuge the column at maximum speed for 2 min using a microcentrifuge to dry the resin completely.\nTransfer the bottom section of the column (resin) to a new 1.5 mL tube. Add 300 µL of nuclease-free water to the column and wait until the whole resin is soaked.\nCentrifuge the column at maximum speed for 1 min to collect the plasmid DNA-containing solution (200 - 250 µL).\nTreat the DNA-containing solution with phenol-chloroform (1:1), then with chloroform as follows.\n\t\t\nAdd the same volume of phenol-chloroform (1:1) to the DNA-containing solution (200 - 250 µL), shake well, and centrifuge at maximum speed for 2 min using a microcentrifuge. Collect the upper layer (DNA-containing solution) and add it to a new 1.5 mL tube. Repeat this step 1x.\nAdd the same volume of chloroform to the DNA-containing solution (200 - 250 µL), shake well, and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Collect the upper layer (DNA-containing solution) and add it to a 1.5 mL tube.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) induces cellular signaling in some cells. To avoid such an unpredicted effect, step 1.2.17 is recommended, which can reduce endotoxin contamination.\nPrecipitate the plasmid DNA using the ethanol precipitation technique as follows.",
    "Add 1/9 of DNA mixture volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 20x of 3M sodium acetate volume of 100% ethanol to the DNA-containing solution. For example, add 27.8 µL of 3 M sodium acetate and 278 µL of 100% ethanol to 250 µL of the DNA solution (the final volume is 555.8 µL).\nKeep the solution at -80 °C for 20 min at least. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 20 min at 4 ˚C. Discard the solution and keep the pellet. Add 200 µL of 75% ethanol and rinse the inside of the tube. Centrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C, discard the solution, and keep the pellet. Dry the DNA pellet using a vacuum concentrator.\nAdd 100 - 250 µL of TE buffer (pH 8.0) to the tube. Dissolve the DNA pellet and check the DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 260 nm. Keep the DNA concentration around 0.5 mg/mL.\n2. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay\nMaintain the cells.\n\t\nCulture human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells in a 750 mL, 175 cm2 tissue culture flask with the phenol red-free minimum essential media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; heat-inactivated), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (antibiotics) for maintaining the cells.\nCulture the cells in a 5% CO2-supplemented, 37 °C incubator until the cells are approximately 90% confluent.\n\t\tNOTE: To reduce estrogenic background activity, phenol red-free medium should be used for all M2H experiments. This step should be performed inside a clean bench/biological safety cabinet. The cells should be maintained following the general mammalian cell culture protocol7.\nPrepare the cells for transfection.\n\tNOTE: The following procedural steps should be performed inside the clean bench/biological safety cabinet. The cells are cultured/incubated in a 5% CO2-supplemented, 37 °C incubator in this step every time.",
    "Replate the 90% confluent cells to the 24-well plates; rinse the cells 1x with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 7 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution to the culture flask and soak the cells for 1 - 2 min while keeping the culture flask in a clean bench at room temperature. Remove a part of the trypsin-EDTA solution and leave 1 - 2 mL of the solution in the culture flask. Incubate the culture flask in the incubator for 1 - 2 min.\nSmack the bottom of the flask to detach the cells and check the cells under the microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: If the cells are still attached to the flask, incubate for another 1 - 2 min and, then, repeat step 2.2.3.\nSuspend the cells in the phenol red-free MEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (heat-inactivated), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Charcoal-stripped FBS must be used to reduce the effect of serum-derived endogenous estrogen.\nCount the cell number and seed cells in a 24-well plate at a density of 1.2 x 105 cells/well. Assign three wells for each data point (triplicate).\nCulture the cells overnight. Continue to step 2.4.1.\nPrepare a DNA mixture for transfection.\n\tNOTE: The following plasmid DNAs are transfected in one well: 100 ng of pG5-Luc reporter plasmid, 50 ng of expression plasmids for GAL4DBD fusion proteins (pBIND), and 50 ng of expression plasmids for VP16AD fusion proteins (pACT).\n\t\nTo analyze the ligand-dependent ERα LBD dimerization activity, prepare the following combinations (Figure 3). Combination (i): pG5-Luc + pBIND-hERαEF + pACT, and pG5-Luc + pBIND-mERαEF + pACT. Combination (ii): pG5-Luc + pBIND-hERαEF + pACT-hERαEF, and pG5-Luc + pBIND-mERαEF + pACT-mERαEF. Combination (iii): pG5-Luc + pBIND + pACT-hERαEF, and pG5-Luc + pBIND + pACT-mERαEF.",
    "NOTE: Combination (i) represents the basal experimental level of human ERα LBD and mouse ERα LBD, respectively. If the result shows a remarkably high level with ligand alone, this method is unfeasible for use with that ligand (e.g., diethylstilbestrol [DES]). Combination (ii) represents the levels of dimerized human ERα LBD and dimerized mouse ERα LBD, respectively. Combination (iii) represents negative controls; use this set only when the experiment is performed for the first time to evaluate the background level of the system.\nBefore mixing, calculate the total DNA amount required based on the number of wells for transfection. For experiments conducted in triplicates and at five data points, mix the following plasmid DNAs in two 1.5 µL tubes for combinations (i) and (ii): pG5-Luc, 5 (data points) x 3 (wells) x 100 ng = 1,500 ng (15 µL); pBIND-mERαEF, 5 (data points) x 3 (wells) x 50 ng = 750 ng (7.5 µL); pACT (for combination i) or pACT-mERαEF (for combination ii), 5 (data points) x 3 (wells) x 50 ng = 750 ng (7.5 µL).\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of each plasmid DNA solution is 0.1 µg/µL.\nPrecipitate the DNA mixture using the ethanol precipitation technique. Add 1/9 of DNA mixture volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 20x of 3M sodium acetate volume of 100% ethanol to the DNA mixture. Then, vortex the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, add 3.4 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, and 34 µL of 100% ethanol to the 30 µL of plasmid DNA mixture exemplified in step 2.3.2. This step helps to keep an invariable transfection condition, and it is not necessary to perform this step in a biological safety cabinet.",
    "Keep the mixture overnight at -20 °C. Centrifuge it at maximum speed for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the solution (the pellet is invisible). Add 120 µL of 75% ethanol to the tube; then, rinse the inside of the tube. Centrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the solution and dry the DNA mixture using a vacuum concentrator for 30 min.\nPerform the transfection.\n\tNOTE: The following steps should be performed in a clean bench or a biological safety cabinet.\n\t\nThe following morning, rinse the cells seeded in a 24-well plate (from step 2.2.6) 2x with 0.5 mL of PBS (room temperature).\nAdd warm (37 °C) fresh phenol red-free MEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (heat-inactivated) and 2 mM L-glutamine without antibiotics to each well (0.5 mL medium/well). Keep the cells in a 5% CO2-supplemented, 37 °C incubator.\nSuspend the dried plasmid DNA mixture (from step 2.3.4) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (no serum, phenol red-free, without glutamine; 13 µL/well). Calculate the amounts of DMEM from the number of wells for transfection.\n\t\tNOTE: 15 wells for combination (i) x 13 µL = 195 µL, and 15 wells for combination (ii) x 13 µL = 195 µL.\nSuspend the transfection reagent (see Table of Materials; 1.5 µL/well) in DMEM (12.5 µL/well) in another 1.5 mL tube. Calculate the amounts of transfection reagent and DMEM from the number of wells for transfection.\n\t\tNOTE: 30 [15 wells for combination (i) and 15 wells for combination (ii)] x 1.5 µL of transfection reagent + 30 x 12.5 µL of DMEM = 420 µL.\nAdd an equal amount of the transfection reagent medium (from step 2.4.4) to each tube (from step 2.4.3). Incubate the tubes for 5 - 10 min at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: 200 µL of transfection reagent medium + 195 µL of combination (i) DNA mixture = 395 µL, and 200 µL of transfection reagent medium + 195 µL of combination (ii) DNA mixture = 395 µL. It is important to add an equal volume of transfection reagent medium to the tubes of combination (i) and (ii). It is not necessary to use up the medium in this step.\nAdd the combined mixture (from step 2.4.5) to each well (25 µL/well) of the 24-well plate (from step 2.4.2) and incubate the cells for 6 h in the 5% CO2-supplemented, 37 °C incubator.\nRemove the transfection medium from the 24-well plate. Add warm (37 °C) fresh phenol red-free MEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (heat-inactivated), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and ligand (suspended in ethanol) (0.5 mL medium/well). Culture the cells for 16 - 18 h in the 5% CO2-supplemented, 37 °C incubator.\nHarvest the samples.\n\t\nRinse the cells with 1 mL of PBS and, then, add 100 µL of 1x passive lysis buffer (see Table of Materials).\nVigorously shake the 24-well plates with a vortex mixer to detach the cells.\nFreeze the plates (cell lysates) 1x by liquid nitrogen or save them at -80 °C before analysis. Immediately before the assay, vigorously shake the plates on a shaker until they are at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: This process prevents irregularly appearing anomalous values of luciferase activity.\nPerform a dual-luciferase assay.\n\t\nPrepare the reagents for the dual-luciferase assay system (see Table of Materials).\n\t\t\nFor making the luciferase assay substrate (LAS) buffer, add all luciferase assay buffer into the luciferase assay substrate which is in a glass brown bottle. Save the LAS buffer at -20 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The LAS buffer should be warmed to room temperature before use.",
    "For making the Renilla luciferase substrate (RLS) buffer, mix Renilla luciferase substrate and Renilla luciferase buffer in a ratio of 1:50. Make fresh RLS buffer for every assay and use a black tube or a tube shaded by tinfoil. Calculate the amount of RLS buffer making a fresh buffer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The RLS buffer should be warmed to room temperature before use.\nSet the reagents in the microplate reader.\n\t\t\nWash the injection lines 2x with 70% ethanol; then, wash the lines 2x with water.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This is important to prevent disturbing the assay results.\nSet the LAS buffer to the P-injector line (first injection) and set the RLS buffer to the M-injector line (second injection). Do not mix these buffers. RLS buffer inhibits luciferase activity.\nApply 10 µL of harvested samples (from step 2.5.3) to the 96-well white plastic plate.\nApply the following settings to the microplate reader. For the P-injector, use a volume of 50 µL, a delay of 2 s, and a speed of 50 µL/s. For the M-injector, use a volume of 50 µL, a delay of 2 s, and a speed of 50 µL/s. Set an integration time of 15 s. Set the temperature to 25 °C.\nRun the microplate reader.\nRecord the values of the luciferase activity (IPValue) and the values of the Renilla luciferase activity (IMValue) using the data acquisition program (see Table of Materials).\nWash the injection lines after the data collection (see step 2.6.2.1).\nPerform data analysis.\n\t\nUse the normalized values (IPValue/IMValue) for data analysis.\nSet the normalized value of combination (i) [pG5-Luc + pBIND-ERαEF + pACT] with vehicle (0 nM ligand) as 1 for the calculation of the basal level and the homodimerized ERα LBD level. The levels are represented as \"Relative activity\".\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
