    "Quality control samplesEnsure that appropriate controls are in place prior to extracting the samples. Required controls include:Blank solution without internal standards.Blank solution with internal standards (see “Recipes” for internal standards).Pooled quality control samples (replicates) that can be monitored for variation across the analytic run. This can be a preparation of a whole cell lysate.Isolation of lipids This procedure was adapted from Weir et al. (2013). Prior to extraction, thaw internal standards to room temperature for an hour, sonicate in a sonicator bath for 15 min, then vortex.Dry samples down in Eppendorf tubes in a SpeedVac. This will take approximately 1 h per 100 µl of sample.Reconstitute samples with 10 μl of MilliQ H2O. Depending on the relative concentration of each fraction, these can be pooled. In general, between 5 µg to 50 µg of protein is desirable for good lipidomic signal. Add 10 μl of the premixed standards using a positive displacement pipette (prewet tips in standard mix prior to use). Do not add premixed standards to the blanks.Add to each sample 200 μl of chloroform and methanol extraction solvent using a positive displacement pipette. For extractions where volume is below 10 μl, adjust appropriately by adding 20x volume of 2:1 chloroform methanol mixture.Vortex samples and mix them on a rotary mixer for 15 min.Sonicate samples in a sonicator bath on high (100% power) setting for 30 min. Ensure temperature of bath stays below 28 °C. The samples should be submerged partially in the water bath to ensure proper contact.Rest samples at room temperature for 20 min. For logistical reasons, this can be extended up to 2 h without affecting the extraction efficiency.Centrifuge samples at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 20 °C, ensure protein has been pelleted.",
    "Note: If protein does not pellet, it’s likely that the water/chloroform/methanol ratio is incorrect. Salvage samples by aspiring as much of the sample as possible while avoiding any precipitated protein. Transfer supernatant to fresh Eppendorf tubes and dry under vacuum (SpeedVac).Reconstitute samples in 50 µl of water saturated butanol.Sonicate tubes in sonicator bath for 10 min.Add 50 µl of methanol containing 10 mM ammonium formate.Centrifuge tubes for 10 min at 13,000 x g at 20 °C.Transfer to 0.2 ml micro-inserts in 32 x 11.6 mm glass vials with Teflon insert caps and store at -80 °C until required.Note: It is very important to use caps that have a Teflon underlay as silica based caps leech and increase background signal.Settings for targeted comprehensive lipidomic analysisLipidomics is an advanced technique that requires a basic understanding of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Several online resources by vendors are available as a introductory guide to the concepts and techniques (view here[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/support/documents/a05296.pdf]).In lipidomics, liquid chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry is commonly used to screen hundreds of compounds in a single run. In particular, a technique using multiple reaction monitoring is widely used owing to their benefits to selectivity and sensitivity. However, the mass spectrometer can only perform a finite number of scans per given moment. Our lipidomics methodology uses liquid chorography to separate and elute lipids over a 15 min timeframe. By combining the known elution times of each lipid we can assign specific regions where a particular multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan would take place. Together this would reduce the amount of time spent scanning unnecessary transitions and maximize the breadth of our methodology. A figure describing this is shown in Figure 2. A brief schematic of the described approach (Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry) is presented in Figures 3 and 4.",
    "The protocol in Section D describes an approach that identifies the specific elution time of lipids without prior knowledge.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701015810_7521.jpgFigure 2. Utilizing scheduled MRMs to improve dwell time and reduce cycle time with reverse phase chromatography. Lipids elute at certain periods of the gradient prior to its ionization on the mass spectrometer (Figure 3). By capitalizing on this, certain scans only need to be carried out in particular time points when using schedule multiple reactions (Figure 4). This allows minimization of wasted scans where the lipid of interest does not elute. An example here is that at 15 min, only 2 scans are required (bottom) vs. 11 that is normally performed if unscheduled (top).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701015845_9087.jpgFigure 3. Separation of lipid species by reverse phase chromatography. Under reverse phase conditions, lipids are separated predominately based on its polarity. More polar compounds such as acylcarnitines elute into the mass spectrometer first with the more water insoluble compounds (cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols) eluting last as the proportion of solvent B increases (up to 100%).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701015922_7998.jpgFigure 4. Examining lipids using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. This particular workflow utilizes a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with MRM’s. MRM’s enable several experiments to take place at a given time. Each experiment has conditions that enable isolation of a particular mass at the first stage (precursor ion), followed by fragmentation (at a defined collision energy) and isolation and measurement of the fragment (product ion). Together, this enables some level of specificity when examining lipids of various sizes and classes and is the core of this particular protocol.Principle of Scheduled multiple reaction monitoring: Scheduled multiple reaction monitoringMultiple reaction monitoring settings:Precursor (Q1) and product ions (Q3) are systematically generated based on the lipid classes. A summary of the conditions used is provided in Table 1.",
    "The precursor transition for each lipid is developed by adding the mass of each lipid with its adduct mass, i.e., PC (34:1) is generated by adding its exact mass (759.5778) with its adduct (+H, so 1.0073).Targeted lipidomics analysis requires multiple reaction monitoring to maximize dwell time (the time allowed for the instrument to examine the precursor/product combination) while minimizing cycle time (the time it takes to perform all scans at a given time).A high dwell time is necessary for good signal reproducibility and sensitivity. In general, a minimum of 2 milliseconds is required per transition on the Agilent 6490. To achieve this, relatively small scan windows (20-60 s) are provided for each transition depending on peak shape (narrow peaks require smaller windows). However, with small scan windows, there is a risk of not scanning the compound of interest due to retention time shift (usually from column ageing or solvent composition changes with evaporation etc.) thus it is essential that accurate and appropriate scan windows are set for each lipid of interest.After column and solvent changeovers, a retention time-check is conducted, where the analysis is run with larger scan windows (thus reducing dwelling time but allowing visual alignment of each peak) and each transition is centered towards the MS peak of interest.Setting up correction factorsIn instances where an appropriate internal standard is not available for a lipid or lipid class, an estimation of lipid concentration can be determined by generating an appropriate response factor. Response factors are required as equal amount of two lipid species from different classes (and sometimes within classes) does not give equal signal on the mass spectrometer.This is done by running equal concentrations (i.e., 1 µM) of a standard of the lipid of interest alongside the most appropriate internal standard.",
    "The relative difference in signal is used as the response factor.Table 1.

(2019). Settings and conditions are reported for the Agilent 6490 QQQ mass spectrometer utilising MRM with scheduling, in conjunction with a 1290 Agilent HPLC system.Method can be adapted to other QQQ instruments but will need to be re-optimised. Additional background / more in depth description of key concepts and parameters behind triple quadrupole mass spectrometers can be found in vendor manuals (i.e., Agilent 6400 series[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/G3335-90135_QQQ_Concepts.pdf]).Set up Solvent A and B into the appropriate lines of the HPLC.Purge lines to ensure no air bubbles are present.Set column compartment to 60 °C and run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using starting conditions (90% Solvent A, 10% Solvent B) to ensure that there are no leaks.Note: The retention time index has to be generated in an instrument dependent manner. Due to differences in dead volume, accuracy of solvent make up and variances in the columns (even from the same manufacturer), the retention time for a single compound can vary by several seconds. Prepare a disposable quality control sample (i.e., pooled control cells) and extract lipids.The chromatographic solvent gradient used is presented in Table 2. As a general rule for lipids under reverse phase conditions. Increasing acyl chain length, i.e., PC(28:0) vs. PC(30:0), will increase retention resulting in a later elution time (i.e., 5.2 to 6.2 min), while increasing the level of unsaturation, i.e., PC(30:0) vs.",
    "PC(30:1), would reduce retention resulting in an earlier elution time (i.e., 6.2 to 5.3 min). An example of this is depicted in Figure 5.Table 2. HPLC gradient used in the lipidomic analysis imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701021341_0711.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701021432_5983.jpgFigure 5. Identification of compounds to determine retention time for method generation. Example of the retention differences between PC(34:1) and PC(34:2). Due the prevalence of 13C in nature, approximately 1% of the signal will carry over to higher masses (i.e., 758.6 into 759.6) and eventually overlap with the monoisotopic transition of other species. Isotopes need to be accounted for and avoided (names in red) when integrating and assigning retention times for each compound. PC–Phosphatidylcholine, SM–Sphingomyelin.Run the eluents of quality control sample as unscheduled (no retention time windows) on the mass spectrometer under the described chromatographic conditions. This will be used to determine the retention time (the time where a particular lipid elutes) for each lipid species. This retention time is used to assign a period where the mass spec performs a MRM experiment for the lipid of interest in conjunction with the known individual transitions (set of conditions with precursor ion mass, product ion mass and collision energy which are given in Table 1). The procedure is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. This will help in scheduling lipid-specific transitions in the mass spec in the final method for the sample run (Section E of the procedure).Combine retention time data from the unscheduled runs of control quality sample for different lipid classes of interest into a single method. Assign retention windows dependent on peak width (as a rough guide, a 0.2 min chromatogram peak should have a window of about 0.7 min). This converts the unscheduled (time unrestricted) scans into scheduled (time dependent) scans. Figure 3 depicts an example of this.",
    "Run each unscheduled method using the same gradient conditions. This is then used to assign a scan window for every given lipid of interest. For example, in Figure 5, PC(34:2) (top panel) would be assigned the retention time of 6.36. The final method would then have the transitions for PC(34:2) and a retention time specified. This is a separate run for each lipid class of interest. If everything was performed in into a single unscheduled run, we would be limited to 200 measurements. We opt here to run each class unscheduled, assign retention times and scan windows, and then merge them into a single method in the end for the true samples. This requires multiple injections of a single sample in the first instance.Note: Ensure that isotopic peaks are avoided. Isotopic peaks arise due to the existence of carbon-13 in nature at approximately 1.1% abundance. Lipids comprise of mostly carbon-12 with different species differing in masses of 1 to 2 Da. In certain situations, an extremely abundant lipid can appear over several mass ranges that overlap with the monoisotopic mass of other species. An example of PC(34:2) overlapping with PC(34:1) is shown in Figure 5. Chromatography allows for the separation of overlapping isotopic compounds. In the method, ensure divert valve is diverting the solvent front (typically the first 1.2 min, dependent on dead volume). Due to the large amount of iodixanol and non-volatile compounds in the final extract, failure to divert will lead to large signal variation over periods where multiple samples are run due to accumulation of these molecules on the mass spectrometer source.Settings: Agilent 1290 HPLC settingsAutosampler set at 25 °C Column compartment set to 60 °CHPLC column used ZORBAX eclipse plus C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm 1.8 μm, Agilent)Flow rate set to 0.",

Typically a 5 µl injection is done on each sample, which maximizes sensitivity while not affecting chromatographic peak shape.Data integration and analysisData can be integrated (calculating the area of the peak) using any vendor (MassHunter) or open source (Skyline) software. This provides a value for each compound and is the end point of the lipidomics work.Each peak area is integrated, ensuring no isotopic peak is accidently integrated.To determine the concentration of each lipid, the area of each lipid of interest is divided by the area of the relevant internal standard. Any appropriate correction factor is then applied (see Step C2 “Setting up correction factors”).Data can be further normalized to measures of raft abundance (e.g., abundance of flotillin-1 or cholesterol), protein or total phosphatidylcholine.An example extracted ion chromatogram (all results overlayed) and a pull out of 1 lipid species is provided in Figure 6.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701021509_2603.jpgFigure 6.
