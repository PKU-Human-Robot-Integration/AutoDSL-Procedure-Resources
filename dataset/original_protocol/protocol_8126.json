    "All steps follow the guidelines of the Ethical Committee of the University of Pisa.\n1. Participant Recruitment\nRecruit a subject population according to the specific goal of the study (i.e., normal subjects and/or patients, males and/or females, young people and/or elders).\n2. Material Preparation\nPrepare a soft pellet; use commercially available chewing gum (Table of Materials; initial hardness = 20 Shore OO).\nPrepare a hard pellet; use silicon rubber pellets (Table of Materials; constant hardness = 60 Shore OO)30.\nPrepare an anti-stress ball for a handgrip task. Use a polyurethane foam-made ball (Table of Materials; constant hardness = 30 Shore OO)30.\nPrepare a tangram puzzle (Table of Materials; number of pieces = seven) for performing the haptic task.\n3. Flowchart of the Experiment\nFlowchart of protocol 1\n\t\nEvaluate baseline performance (see section 4.1) in the cognitive (matrices) test (T0, control).\nEvaluate pupil size (see section 4.2) at rest (no activity requested from the subject) (T0, control).\nEvaluate pupil size during a haptic task based on tangram (T0, control).\n\t\t\nRemove one of the pieces from the puzzle and place it in the subject's hand.\nAsk the subject to put the piece back into the puzzle, without looking at the puzzle.\nAsk each subject to perform three specific activities for 2 min or to rest for 2 min, according to steps 3.1.4.1–3.1.4.4. Ask the subjects to perform these activities in separate sessions occurring on different days (2–3 days between sessions).\n\t\t\nAsk the subject to chew a self-administered soft pellet for 2 min, letting him/her spontaneously choose both the rate of chewing and side of the mouth on which to chew. After 1 min of chewing, ask him/her to change the chewing side (and the pellet).",
    "Ask the subject to chew a self-administered hard pellet for 2 min. After 1 min, ask him/her to change the chewing side (but not the pellet).\nAsk the subject to perform a rhythmic squeezing of an anti-stress ball (handgrip exercise) for 2 min at the rate and on the hand of their choosing. After 1 min, ask the subject to switch hands.\nAsk the subject to rest (no activity) for 2 min.\nJust after the end of each step (3.1.4.1–3.1.4.4), evaluate performance in the matrices test and pupil size at rest and during the haptic task (T7).\nNOTE: The term \"at rest\" means that the subject during the pupil size measurement is relaxing. The term \"during haptic task\" means that the subject during the pupil size measurement is performing the task based on tangram.\nThirty minutes following the end of each step (3.1.4.1–3.1.4.4), evaluate performance and pupil size at rest and during the haptic task (T37).\nFlowchart of protocol 2\n\t\nEvaluate pupil size while the subject is resting (T0, control; see section 4.3).\nEvaluate baseline performance in the cognitive (matrices) test while simultaneously testing pupil size (T0, control).\nAsk each subject to perform three specific activities for 2 min or to rest for 2 min, according to steps 3.2.3.1–3.2.3.4. Ask the subjects to perform these activities in separate sessions occurring on different days (2–3 days between sessions).\n\t\t\nAsk the subject to chew a self-administered soft pellet for 2 min, letting him/her spontaneously choose both the rate of chewing and side of the mouth on which to chew. After 1 min of chewing, ask him/her to change the chewing side (and the pellet).\nAsk the subject to chew a self-administered hard pellet for 2 min. After 1 min, ask him/her to change the chewing side (but not the pellet).",
    "Ask the subject to perform a rhythmic squeezing of an anti-stress ball (handgrip exercise) for 2 min at the rate and on the side of their choosing. After 1 min, ask the subject to switch hands.\nAsk the subject to relax (no activity) for 2 min.\nJust after the end of each step (steps 3.2.3.1–3.2.3.4), evaluate pupil size at rest and both performance and pupil size in the matrices test (T7).\nThirty minutes following the end of each step (steps 3.2.3.1–3.2.3.4), evaluate pupil size at rest and both performance and pupil size in the matrices test (T37).\n4. Measured Variables in Protocols 1 and 2\nCognitive performance\nNOTE: In both protocols 1 and 2, measure cognitive performance using a test based on a modified version of the Spinnler-Tognoni numeric matrices test29.\n\t\nDisplay three numerical matrices (10 x 10) printed on paper to the subject. Then, ask the subject to sequentially scan the matrix lines, while ticking with a pencil as many of the target numbers as possible (60 targets out of 300 total displayed numbers) indicated above each matrix (Figure 1) within 15 s.\nUtilize matrices with different positions of target numbers at T0, T7, and T37 to avoid the introduction of confounders related to learning processes.\nEvaluate offline the performance index (PI), scanning rate (SR), and error rate (ER) as follows: PI = (target numbers underlined in 15 s)/15; SR = (target + non-target numbers scanned in 15 s)/15; ER = (target numbers missed + non-target numbers underlined in 15 s)/15.\nPupil size in protocol 1\n\t\nPrepare the subject for the pupil size measurement with a corneal topographer-pupillographer (Table of Materials), which prevents vision of the environment, using one of the following two acquisition procedures.",
    "Record a single camera shot of the pupil (Figure 2A,B) with a constant illumination level of 40 lux, pressing the specific button on the corneal topographer-pupillographer. Maintain an optimal working distance of 56 mm between the camera and pupil.\nNOTE: A single measurement is sufficient, due to the low level of variability of pupil size measured at constant illumination.\nPerform a continuous recording of the pupil (sampling rate = 5 Hz; Figure 2C,D) in the continuous acquisition modality. Discard the first 20–50 measurements (4–10 s), since during this lapse of time, the pupil diameter is growing (the acquisition starts by switching off pupil illumination at 40 lux). Average the remaining measurements.\nRecord pupil size of the left and right eyes separately at rest (steps 3.1.2, 3.1.5, and 3.1.6).\nRecord pupil size during the haptic task (steps 3.1.3, 3.1.5 and 3.1.6; left and right separately). When using the single shot modality (step 4.2.1.1), acquire the photo during the second of two task repetitions, at the beginning of puzzle surface exploration. In the continuous mode of recording (step 4.2.1.2), start the acquisition when the piece of the puzzle has been placed in the hand of the subject.\nEvaluate offline left and right pupil size at rest and during the haptic task by direct acquisition of the values (in mm) displayed by the software. Calculate the task-related mydriasis by subtracting the pupil size at rest from pupil size during the haptic task, and obtain all average left-right values.\nPupil size in protocol 2\n\t\nPrepare the subject for the pupil size measurement using a wearable pupillometer/eye tracker (Figure 3A), endowed with a 3D-printed glass frame structure, using the following procedure.",
    "Have the subject wear the wearable pupillometer. Adjust the position of the two infrared cameras (Figure 3A-2,3) mounted on bars stemming from the frame (Table of Materials), so that the eyes are within the field of view of the cameras and in focus.\nAcquire images of the pupils (sampling rate = 120 Hz), which are processed online by the software supplied with the wearable pupilometer and provides pupillary diameter (in mm) using a geometrical model of the \"average\" human ocular. Disregard blink artifacts.\nRecord continuously the environmental illumination level using a calibrated logarithmic light sensor mounted on the wearable pupillometer frame. Use a frontal RGB camera mounted on the wearable pupillometer (Figure 3A-1) to record the subject field of view (sampling rate = 30 Hz) useful to study gaze behaviour.\nRecord simultaneously the size of the two pupils at rest for 20 s (Figure 3B).\nRecord the size of the pupils while the subject performs the Spinnler-Tognoni test, so to have pupil size and cognitive performance simultaneously recorded (steps 3.2.2, 3.2.4, and 3.2.5).\nEvaluate offline left and right pupil size at rest and during the Spinnler-Tognoni test, by averaging acquired values (n = 2,400) for each pupil. Calculate the task-related mydriasis by subtracting the pupil size at rest from the pupil size during the matrices test, then all the average left-right values.\nGaze position\nNOTE: Reconstruct online the fixation point using the images of the two pupils obtained from section 4.3. Process the acquired frames in real-time and estimate the gaze fixation point using a previously calculated transfer function31 specific for each subject wearing the eye tracker.",
    "If necessary, when performing protocol 2, reconstruct gaze position from the pupil images. To do this, add four computer detectable vision markers (ArUco or AprilTag libraries of the instrument software) to four corners of the matrices sheet used in section 4.1.\nAllow the calibration system (embedded in the eye tracker software as for the pupil headset used) to acquire the data, and evaluate the parameters of the transfer function that map the fixation point, starting from images of the two pupils. As an example, ask the subject to gaze at a predefined sequence of points that are shown in his/her field of view (i.e., the four corners of the matrices sheet and at the center of the sheet itself), which are recorded simultaneously by the additional RGB camera mounted on the frame and facing the field of view.\nRecord pupil size during the matrices test.\nCalculate offline gaze position that appears as a mark on every frame of the subject's field of view. Use the four markers to track gaze position over the matrices across frames.\n5. Statistical Analysis\nAnalyze pupil size at rest and during the task, task-induced mydriasis, PI, SR, and ER under four conditions (no activity, handgrip, soft pellet, hard pellet) for three times (T0, T7, T37) using repeated measures ANOVA and statistics software package.\nAnalyze changes in variables with respect to baseline values (T0) under four conditions, (no activity, handgrip, soft pellet, hard pellet) for two times (T7, T37) using repeated measures ANOVA.\nWhen running ANOVA, if the software indicates that the data distribution is not spherical, take the p-value corresponding to the Greenhouse-Geisser ε correction from the outputted statistic table.\nCorrelate the changes in performance (PI, SR, ER) at T7 and T37 with those observed in task-related mydriasis by linear regression analysis.",
