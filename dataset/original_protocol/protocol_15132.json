    "Methods\nThe protocol has been approved by the Bichat-Debré Ethic committee (N° 2012-15/698-0074).\nThe elastase perfusion model has been  first  described by Anidjar in 19901: abdominal aortic aneurysm is induced by elastase perfusion in male Wistar rats, aged 8 to 9 weeks, 250-300 g. Two to 4 weeks later, a re-laparotomy is performed, and a 3 mm diameter covered coronary stentgraft is used to exclude the aneurysm. The graft, inserted through a distal aortotomy, is deployed under magnified vision. Two weeks later, stentgraft patency is confirmed with an aortography by the left common carotid artery before sacrifice. The whole stented aorta and surrounding tissues are then harvested and conditioned for analysis.\nProtocol\n1. Step 1 : Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Induction (Day 0)\nAnesthetize the animal with isoflurane, and perform an intra peritoneal penthobarbital injection. 0.1 ml/100 g of penthobarbitol is diluted in 0.1 ml of saline/100 g of animal weight. Anesthesia is adequate for the procedure.\nShave the abdomen, and clean the skin with alcohol. \nMake Xypho pubic skin incision with a blade. Abdominal muscles layer then peritoneum, avoiding internal organs, are open with scissors. Place the spreaders and wrap the intestines in a wet compress on the left side of the animal.\nOpen the posterior peritoneum directly above the aorta, without tearing it. The goal is to prevent future bowel adhesions by economic dissection. \nLigate all collaterals from the left renal vein to the iliac bifurcation with only one ligature, at the origin of the aorta. If the aorta is stuck to the bowels or the vena cava, there's a high risk of bleeding during the second intervention; this is often fatal for the rat.",
    "Pass a 4-0 silk twice around the aorta, 15 mm below the left renal vein. It's important to entirely dissect the aorta, approx. 15 mm below the left renal vein and just proximal to the iliac bifurcation to allow insertion of the Gilbert approximator clamps.  \nAfter clamping the aorta proximally just below the left renal vein, and distally just above the iliac bifurcation, remove the adventitia, and perform a small aortotomy as proximal as possible to the distal clamp. The aorta has to be carefully flushed with saline and an angulated canula and all remaining blood washed to avoid clot embolization when declamping.\nIntroduce heat-tapered polyethylene tubing (PE 10) smoothly inside the aorta, and pass the 4-0 silk around the aorta (at step 1.6) and tie up to secure the tube and avoid pressure expulsion. \nInject elastase into a 10 to 13 mm length of aorta (from the proximal clamp to the silk). \nInfuse 725 μl of the elastase solution is d at constant speed-rate in 30 min. It is important to carefully survey the injection: during infusion, the aorta should expand by 140-150% of its normal diameter.  \nAt the end of the infusion, remove the catheter, flush the elastase with saline, cut the silk and close the aortotomy with about 3 stitches of 10-0 Prolene. Remove the clamps: distal then proximal. Care has to be taken to avoid trans-aortic suture. With a few practice and considering the small length of the aortotomy, aorta thrombosis is extremely rare. \nClose abdominal wall with a continuous absorbable suture, and the skin with interrupted non absorbable sutures. Inject a 5 mg/kg dose of Carprofen subcutaneously to prevent pain. Return the rats to their cage and give the standard rat laboratory chow and water ad libidum.",
    "2. Step 2 : Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Exclusion with a Coronary PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) Covered Stentgraft (Day 15-30)\nPrior to the operation, dilute Aspirin 1,000 mg in 1 L of water. Daily water intake was estimated of 10-12 ml/100 g/ of body weight a day. \nAfter anesthesia as previously described, perform a re-laparotomy, carefully avoiding potential internal organs adherent to the abdominal wall. Aneurysm was defined by an increase of 50% at least of the aorta compared to proximal aorta diameter measured under direct vision. Based on our experience, the success rate is 90%, including early deaths, mostly due to aorta burst (unpublished data) \nDissect the aorta at the aortic bifurcation and also at the proximal neck. The aneurysm should arise a few millimeters below the left renal vein; this allows a satisfactory length between the distal neck and the distal clamp to insert the catheter, and suture the aorta.\n    Stentgraft length depends on the aneurysm size. Both proximal and distal necks should be covered by at least 2 millimeters. \nWrap a double loop silk around the proximal neck. Clamp the proximal aorta above the aneurysm and below the left renal artery, and distally above the aortic bifurcation.",
    "Perform a large aortotomy just above the previous aortotomy to avoid tearing the aortic wall when introducing the stentgraft. Do not rinse the aorta to preserve integrity of the thrombus. Push the stentgraft towards the proximal clamp. Remove the clamp is and control the tension of the silk to allow graft progression. Adapt the tension around the delivering catheter to allow stentgraft progression until the proximal edge of the stentgraft reaches the proximal neck, but also this will prevent massive hemorrhage after proximal clamp removal. The balloon and the proximal end of the delivering catheter may cover the renal arteries, but not the stentgraft which has to be deployed below the renal arteries. \nDeploy the stentgraft  under direct visual control using an inflator syringe at 8 atm pressure. Deflate the balloon whilst tightening the silk and remove the balloon shaft. \nWash the stentgraft with saline. Place a clamp just below the distal part of the aneurysm, and close aorta with interrupted 10-0 Prolene sutures. \nClose the wound, inject Carprofen subcutaneously and let the animals return to their cage. Give the standard laboratory chow and water ad libidum. \n3. Step 3 : Control of Stentgraft Patency (Day 30)\n15 days after stentgraft insertion, perform an arteriography to control graft patency \nAfter anesthesia, perform a transverse elbow to elbow incision.  The left common carotid artery is located beneath the submandibular and sublingual glands and beneath the sternomastoid muscle. 2 cm length exposure is recommended.",
    "Ligate the artery distally with a silk 4-0. After proximal clamping, insert an 18G catheter retrogradely and secure with a silk 4-0 passed twice around the carotid artery and tied. A sufficient length allows insertion and securing  the catheter before proximal clamp is removed. If it's hard to expose 2cm of artery, the tube, clamped after filled with saline can be pushed proximally whilst removing the proximal clamp.\nInject contrast through the catheter under direct fluoroscopy. Perform a stentgraft angiographic control to both confirm the absence of endoleak which could result of an inappropriate deployment of the stentgraft, and confirm stentgraft patency. This step is important because the high numbers of collaterals vessels allow adequate leg perfusion even with a thrombosed stentgraft. We didn't try to perform Duplex ultrasonography: we postulate that stentgraft steel structure prevents correct assessment of stentgraft patency and endoleaks.  \nSacrifice the rat by exsanguination according to the recommendations18, and the aneurysm, stentgraft, thrombus and aortic wall are harvested for histological or biochemical studies. \nSubscription Required.
