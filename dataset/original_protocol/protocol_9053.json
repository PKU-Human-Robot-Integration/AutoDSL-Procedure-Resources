    "1. Make Required Solutions\n1 M  Phosphate buffer:  Weigh  out 109.4 g Na2HPO4 and 32 g NaH2PO4.H20,  mix and dissolve in water to total volume of 1 liter.\nPhosphate  Buffered Saline (PBS):  Prepare 0.1 M Phosphate buffer, 0.15 M NaCl. 100 ml of  PBS should suffice for the processing of slices from 10 embryos.\nAgarose:  Heat PBS solution to around 70 °C  and add solid low melting temperature agarose slowly whilst stirring continuously.  Make the solution to a final concentration of 4% (w/v) agarose. Make a stock of  50 ml of this solution. Leave this solution in a waterbath kept at 48 °C  until required. Any agarose solution unused after the experiment can be stored  at 4 °C for several weeks.\nAntibody  block solution:  Add foetal calf serum and triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% (v/v)  foetal calf serum, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. 10 ml of block solution will  suffice for the immunostaining of 5 slides of cryostat sections.\nFixative:  Prepare 0.75 mm  NaOH, 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (CAUTION). To prepare fixative heat required  amount of water to 70 °C, add concentrated NaOH to required final  concentration, add solid paraformaldehyde and mix until dissolved. Cool on ice  to 4 °C. 10 ml of this solution will suffice for 20 wells of embryo  slices.\nSucrose  Solution:   Prepare 10 ml of a 30% (w/v) sucrose solution  containing 0.1 M Phosphate buffer. 10 ml of this solution will suffice for 10  wells of embryo slices.\n70% (v/v) Ethanol.  Dilute 70 ml of absolute ethanol  with 30 ml of water.",
    "Culture Medium:  Prepare a solution of 1% chicken embryo extract, 1%  Penicillin/ Streptomycin, 0.35% L-Glutamine, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% chicken  serum, 2% B27 supplement and 100 ng/ml ciliaryneurotrophic growth factor (CNTF)  all diluted in neurobasal medium; prepared on ice and used the same day. 10 ml  of culture medium is required for 20 wells of embryo slices.\n2. Chick Embryo Preparation\nPlace fertilized hens eggs with the longest side horizontally in a forced draft  incubator at 38 °C until they develop to stage15 24. This  usually requires approximately 4 days of incubation.\nOn  the second day of incubation, sterilize the egg shell by wiping with a tissue  paper soaked in 70% ethanol. Carefully pierce the flat end of the egg shell  using a 21 gauge needle attached to a 5 ml syringe and remove 5 ml of albumin.  This lowers the embryo away from the shell so the embryo is not damaged when  the shell is opened. Return the eggs to the incubator and incubate them for a  further 2 days.\nUsing  blunted dumont #5 forceps carefully pierce the top middle of the shell and  remove around 9 cm2 of shell. Cut around the embryo and carefully  lift out the embryo and place in HBSS during dissection. The embryos should be staged according to  Hamburger and Hamilton (1992)15.  All embryos used should be at close to stage 24. Any embryos that show any signs of  abnormality should be discarded.",
    "Remove  the amnion membrane, chorio-allantoic membrane, the head, and allantois using  two dumont #5 forceps. Eviscerate the  embryo to remove all internal organs. To do this, cut open the ventral midline  of the embryo with micro dissecting scissors, hold the embryo around the  rostral trunk region with one pair of forceps, grab the rostral part of the gut  and the heart and pull caudally. It is important that this is done cleanly. You  should be able to see the embryo somites clearly. Cut the embryo in half,  transversely between the upper and lower limb buds.Now trim the thoracic body  wall using microdissection scissors.\n3. Embryo Slice Preparation\nRemove  the agarose solution from the water bath.  Cut 5 cm from the bottom of a disposable 3 ml plastic Pasteur pipette.\nGently  remove the lumbar half of the dissected embryo using two forceps to cradle the  embryo out of the dissection solution and place in a dry Petri dish. Using the  Pasteur pipette, remove around 2 ml of agarose, pipette approximately 0.5 ml on  top of the embryo and then suck up the embryo slice into the pipette. Transfer  the embryo and agarose to a peel away plastic mould take care not to introduce any bubbles in the agarose. Gently lower the embryo to the bottom of the agarose in the plastic mould with the thoracic section facing downwards. The embryo should be positioned to be straight using a 21 gauge needle. The slices  will also contain part of the developing limb and it is important that the orientation of the embryo in the agarose will allow this. Place the boat on ice to set the agarose. Take care that the embryo does not change orientation during this period (around 2 min).",
    "The  Leica VT1000S vibratome (Speed 3, Frequency 4, 400 μm thick slices) should be  set up with the slicing chamber filled with HBSS and surrounded by ice-cold water. The agarose block is then stuck to the  vibratome platform with super glue. The  agarose block is trimmed with a razor blade to leave the embryo piece with  1-3 mm of agarose surrounding it. The  slices that include limb bud sections with a clear apical ectodermal rigde are  selected and these slices are then placed in HBSS. Generally, there are only one to two suitable  slices per embryo. Gently remove the agarose around the tissue slices using two  needles. It is essential that this is  done thoroughly and carefully.\n4. Culturing Embryo Slices\nAdd  500 ml of  culture solution (outlined above) to the required number of wells of a 24-well  ultra low attachment treated tissue culture plate. Transfer the slices carefully from the HBSS  solution into the well. In general, we  try to have two to three slices in each well. Place the 24-well plate in the  tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 hr.\n5. Sectioning the Slices for Immunostaining\nFollowing  the culture period, add 500 μl of unbuffered fix to  each well of embryo slices and leave on ice for 20 min. The total solution is then removed carefully  and three PBS washes are carried out, with 5-min intervals. The slices are then left in sucrose solution  at 4 °C, until the slices sink, around 6 hr but can be left for  longer (e.g. overnight).",
    "Remove the slices and dab off extra sucrose solution and  equilibrate in around 1 ml O.C.T for around 5 min at 20 °C. Mount  each slice flat in an O.C.T.-filled peel away plastic mold. After mounting, place the molds vertically on  dry ice to solidify.\nMount  the O.C.T. blocks into the cryostat and equilibrate the blocks at -24 °C  for around 20 min. Cut each slice  with 15 mm  sections mounted on Superfrost-Plus slides.  Slides can be stored at -80 °C until they are needed.\n6. Immunofluorescence\nPipette  1-2 ml of PBS on the horizontal slides held in a humidified chamber with the  slides raised from the bottom of the chamber (we use 1 or 2 ml plastic pipettes  fixed with autoclave tape). Incubate the sections in PBS for 5 min at 20 °C to remove  excess O.C.T. Remove the PBS solution  from the slide and add 500 ml of block solution over the  sections, incubate for 30 min at 20 °C. Remove the block solution and immediately add  500 ml of  diluted primary antibody added to the slides, incubate at 4 °C for  18-22 hr.\nRemove primary antibody solution and immediately wash the slides with 1 ml of PBS for 5 min, three times at 20 °C to remove excess primary antibody solution. Add 500 ml of diluted secondary antibody  over the sections. The slides are then  left at 20 °C for 30 min.  The secondary antibody solution is then removed and the slide washed 3  times 5 min in PBS at 20 °C.",
    "Following  these washes, remove the final PBS wash, dab the edge of the slide to remove excess PBS, add two drops of vectashield on the slides and gently lay a glass coverslip over the sections, avoiding bubble formation. Remove excess Vectashield by blotting from the edge of the slides before imaging.\n7. Imaging\nImage  the immunostained sections. We use a Nikon Eclipse  E80i fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamammatsu ORCA ER digital camera  and 10 X, 20X and 40 X objective lenses."
