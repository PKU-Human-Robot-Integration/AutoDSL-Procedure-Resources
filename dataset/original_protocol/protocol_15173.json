  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The following protocol for enrichment of LDL particles from chicken egg yolk is derived from Moussa et al. 200233.\n1. Preparation of chicken egg yolk for enrichment of LDL particles\nSanitize two large chicken eggs by washing the shells with 70% ethanol solution and allow to air dry.\nSanitize the egg separator using 70% ethanol solution and allow to air dry. Attach the egg separator onto the lip of a medium sized beaker.\nCrack each egg individually into the egg separator and allow the albumen to flow into the beaker. The intact egg yolk will be retained by the separator.\nWash the egg yolk twice with 30 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove residual albumen.\nGently place the egg yolk onto filter paper.\nPuncture the vitelline membrane with a sterile pipette tip and drain the contents of the membrane into a sterile 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. Discard the membrane and filter paper.\n2. Fractionation of LDL-containing plasma from chicken egg yolk\nAdd approximately two volumes of 0.17 M NaCl at pH 7.0 to the egg yolk and mix vigorously. Then mix this solution at 4 °C for 60 min.\nCentrifuge the egg yolk dilution at 10 °C at 10,000 x g for 45 min. Remove the plasma fraction (supernatant) from the granular fraction (pellet) into a sterile 50 mL conical tube.\nRepeat step 2.2.\n3. Isolation of LDL particles from plasma\nMix the plasma fraction with 40% ammonium sulfate (w/v) at 4 °C for 60 min.\nAdjust the pH of the plasma fraction with a 420 mM NaOH solution to 8.7.",
    "Centrifuge the egg yolk dilution at 4 °C at 10,000 x g for a duration of 45 min. Remove the upper semisolid yellow fraction into 7 kDa pore size dialysis tubing. Provide room in the tubing to allow for it to swell.\nDialyze overnight at 4 °C in 3 L of ultrapure water to remove the ammonium sulfate. Gently agitate the water using a stir bar.\nTransfer dialyzed solution into a sterile 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the solution at 4 °C at 10,000 x g for a duration of 45 min. Carefully remove the upper semisolid yellow fraction to a sterile tube and store at 4 °C.\n4. Assessment of chicken LDLs as a source of fatty acids\nSubculture S. aureus cells into 5 mL of fatty acid-free 1% tryptone broth and incubate overnight at 37 °C with shaking (225 rpm). For fatty acid auxotrophs, supplement cultures with a source of fatty acids.\nDilute overnight cultures to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.1 in 1% tryptone broth. Pipette 50 μL of the cell suspension into each well of a round-bottom 96-well plate.\n\tNOTE: When working with fatty acid auxotrophs, wash the overnight cultures in two volumes of tryptone broth and resuspend in 5 mL of tryptone broth to limit carryover of fatty acids before determining the OD of the culture.\nFor the wells containing untreated controls, add 50 µL of 1% tryptone broth per well.\nTo the wells containing the experimental cell suspensions, add 50 µL of 1% tryptone broth supplemented with 10% egg yolk-derived LDL, 2 μM triclosan, or a mixture of 10% egg yolk-derived LDL and 2 μM triclosan.",
    "NOTE: At this point, each well will contain 100 μL and the final concentration of egg yolk-derived LDL and triclosan per well will be 5% and 1 µM, respectively.\nMeasure OD600 over time, using a microplate reader set at 37 °C with continuous, linear shaking to monitor growth.\n5. Incubation of S. aureus with LDLs for membrane lipid analysis.\nCulture an isolated colony into 5 mL of fatty acid-free 1% tryptone broth and incubate overnight at 37 °C with shaking (225 rpm).\nDilute overnight cultures 1:100 into a sterile 250 mL baffled flask containing 50 mL of 1% tryptone broth. Incubate to mid-log phase (approximately 4 h) at 37 °C with shaking.\nTransfer 25 mL of culture to a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube and pellet the cells. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 750 µL of 1% tryptone broth.\nCombine the resuspended cells and aliquot 300 µL of the cell suspension into a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd LDLs to the desired final concentration and incubate at 37 °C with shaking (225 rpm) for 4 h.\nCentrifuge the cultures at 4 °C at 16,000 x g for a duration of 2 min and wash the cell pellets in two volumes of sterile PBS then repeat.\nRecord the weight of each wet cell pellet. Snap-freeze the cell pellets on dry ice or in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C or proceed directly to section 6.\n6. Extraction of S. aureus membrane lipids\nPlace frozen S. aureus cell pellets on dry ice. Add 0.5 mm zirconium oxide beads on top of each cell pellet, using a volume of beads approximately equal to the volume of the cell pellet.",
    "NOTE: As an alternative to this method of lipid extraction, researchers can use the well-established Bligh and Dyer or Folch methods for exacting lipids from bacterial cells34.\nAdd 740 µL of 75% methanol (HPLC grade) chilled to -80 °C directly to the cell pellets.\nAdd 2 μL of 50 µM dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (prepared in methanol) per 1 mg of cells as an internal standard. Close the test tube and place the 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes containing each sample into an available port in a Bullet Blender tissue homogenizer. Homogenize the samples on low speed, setting 2-3, for 3 min.\nVisually inspect the samples for homogeneity. If clumps of cells are visible, continue homogenization in the Bullet Blender in 2 min increments.\nRemove the samples from Bullet Blender and transfer to a chemical fume hood.\nAdd 270 µL of chloroform to each sample tube. Vortex the samples vigorously for 30 min.\n\tCAUTION: Chloroform is a possible carcinogen.\nCentrifuge the samples in a benchtop centrifuge for up to 30 min at a minimum 2,000 x g. Faster speeds may be used with compatible centrifuge tubes and the duration of centrifugation may be shortened to 10 min.\nIn a chemical fume hood, collect the monophasic supernatant and transfer to a new test tube, while carefully avoiding the protein pellet at the bottom of the extraction tube.\nAdd 740 µL of 75% methanol (HPLC grade) and 270 µL of chloroform to the protein pellet, and re-extract each sample as described in steps 6.6-6.8 above. Combine the supernatant from the second extraction with the previously collected supernatant for each sample.\nEvaporate the extraction solvents under a stream of inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, or under vacuum using a centrifuge concentrator (Table of Materials).",
    "Wash dried lipid extracts three times with 1.0 mL of aqueous 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution and re-dry the samples as in step 6.10.\nResuspend the dried lipid extracts in a suitable nonpolar solvent such as isopropanol. Resuspend samples using 20 µL per 1 mg of fresh cell weight determined in step 5.7 Alternatively, if the weight of the cell pellets is unknown, resuspend the samples in 200 µL of isopropanol and proceed to Section 7.\n7. Analysis of S. aureus lipid profiles using high resolution/accurate mass spectrometry\nPrior to conducting a full lipid analysis, select representative test samples from the experimental group(s) and analyze them over a range of sample dilution factors to determine sample dilution ranges in which the total lipid concentrations fall within the linear range of detector response for the mass spectrometer, as previously described35.\nEvaporate aliquots of each sample lipid extract to be subjected to lipid analysis, by drying the aliquots under inert gas or under vacuum in a centrifuge concentrator (Table of Materials).\nResuspend each dried lipid extract in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) grade isopropanol:methanol (2:1, v:v) containing 20 mM ammonium formate, using volumes equivalent to an optimal sample dilution factor as determined in step 7.1.\nFor an untargeted lipid analysis, samples may be introduced directly to the high resolution/accurate mass spectrometry platform without the use of chromatography by flow injection or direct infusion of extracts35,36. Transfer the diluted lipid extracts prepared in step 7.3 to an appropriate autosampler vial or 96-well plate.\nFor flow injection-based analysis, place the autosampler vials into a temperature-controlled (15 °C) autosampler of an HPLC system capable of capillary/low flow applications, such as a HPLC (Table of Materials) equipped with an electronic flow proportioning and flow monitoring system.",
    "Fill the HPLC solvent reservoirs with LC-MS grade isopropanol:methanol (2:1, v:v) containing 20 mM ammonium formate.\nUsing Agilent Chemstation software, program the HPLC autosampler to perform 5 µL sample injections. From the Instrument menu, select Set Up Injector, and type 5.0 in the Injection Volume field. The units are given as microliters. Ensure that the HPLC is set to isocratic flow at 1 µL per min of 2:1 (v:v) isopropanol:methanol containing 20 mM ammonium formate.\nFrom the Chemstation Instrument menu, select Set Up Pump… and then select the Micro Flow mode toggle switch.\nIn the Timetable fields, enter: Time 0.00, 100% B, Flow 1.0. Hit Enter and create a second row in the Timetable by entering Time 10.0, 100% B, Flow 1.0. Select the OK button at the bottom of the Set Up Pump menu. These settings will enable 10 analytical runs at a flow rate of 1.0 µL per minute.\nIntroduce eluate from the HPLC transfer line to the mass spectrometer using an electrospray ionization source fitted with a low-flow (34 G) metal needle.\nUsing Thermo Tune Plus instrument control software, select the Setup menu and select Heated ESI Source. Set the ionization voltage to 4000 V and sheath gas to 5 (arbitrary units) by typing these values into the corresponding fields of the dialogue box. Similarly, set the Capillary Temp to 150 °C and the S-lens to 50%.\n\tNOTE: These values need to be optimized for each mass spectrometry platform.\nFor untargeted lipid analysis, use a high resolution/accurate mass MS platform (Table of Materials) as the detector.",
    "Using Thermo Tune Plus software, click the Define Scan button, and in the Analyzer menu select FTMS. Set the Mass Range field to Normal and in the Resolution field select 100,000. Ensure that Scan Type is set to Full. Under the Scan Ranges menu, enter 200 in the First Mass (m/z) field, and enter 2000 in the Last Mass (m/z) field.\nEnsure that negative polarity is utilized to detect the most abundant S. aureus lipids.\nRepeat the sample analysis using ion mapping tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation of all lipid ions within a spectral region of interest in order to confirm lipid structures and fatty acid constituents. Alternatively, selected lipid ions of interest may be subjected to MS/MS analysis after initial lipid identifications have been assigned in Section 8.\n8. Database searching to identify endogenous S. aureus and exogenous LDL-derived lipids\nUse Thermo Xcalibur software to further refine observed mass accuracy. In Xcalibur, under the Tools menu, select the Recalibrate Offline. After the Recalibrate Offline window opens, load the mass spectrum file to be recalibrated by selecting the File menu and selecting the Open option.\nOpen the file of interest, toggle the Insert Row button at the top of the view window, to view the total ion chromatogram for the MS run.
