    "This study uses human cardiac ATDPCs from patient samples. Their use has been approved by the local ethics committee, and all patients gave informed consent. The study protocol conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Preparations\nAutoclave two tweezers, 12 platinum PTFE electrodes for electrical stimulation, and some paper towels, at 121 °C for 20 min.\nSterilize 12 PDMS custom-made constructs (Figure 1A).\nWash each construct with 5 mL of sterile, distilled water with magnetic agitation at room temperature for 15 min.\nWash 1x with 5 mL of 70% ethanol with magnetic agitation at room temperature for 5 min.\nWash 5x with 5 mL of sterile, distilled water with magnetic agitation at room temperature for 10 min per wash, to remove alcoholic residues.\nDry the constructs on sterile paper towels inside the flow cabinet overnight.\nStore them in sterile 50 mL centrifuge tubes until use.\n2. Cell Seeding (Day -1)\nBefore cell seeding, transfer the cleaned PDMS constructs to sterile plates and expose them to ultraviolet light for 5 min to ensure complete sterilization.\nTransfer each construct to a 35 mm cell culture plate, or 6-well plate, for immediate cell seeding.\nTrypsinize a confluent T75 flask of cardiac ATDPCs.\nWash the T75 flask with 5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min to detach the cells.\nAdd 5 mL of complete medium to inactivate the trypsin-EDTA.\nCollect all cells in a 15 mL tube and wash the flask 2x with 5 mL of PBS to collect any remaining cells.\nCentrifuge at 230 x g for 5 min at 22 °C, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 2 mL of complete medium to count them with the hemocytometer chamber.",
    "Seed 200 µL of cardiac ATDPCs (2.5 x 105 cells/mL) into the cell pool of the 12 PDMS constructs (Figure 1A,B) to have ~80% of the seeding surface covered by cells the day after, and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nNOTE: After 2–4 h, the cells should be attached. Cell inoculum is prepared according to the cell size and growth. For smaller cells, the seeding density should be increased.\nGently add 2 mL of prewarmed complete medium (α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) per plate.\nIncubate the constructs at culture conditions (usually 37 °C and 5% CO2) overnight.\n3. Electromechanical Stimulation Setup (Day 0)\nBefore starting the procedure, take six constructs for electromechanical stimulation and six as nonstimulated controls. With fewer than six plates per stimulation, use empty constructs with the same medium volume to ensure proper electric field stimulation.\nClean the stimulation unit with 70% ethanol and place it in the flow cabinet.\nBring the sterile electrodes and tweezers inside the flow cabinet.\nRemove 90% of the media from the culture plate to easily manipulate the electrodes and constructs. First, place the PDMS constructs in the right position to ensure magnetic attraction (PDMS displacement within the culture plate toward the magnet) between both fixed and mobile magnets. Next, connect the platinum wire to the electrode connectors and the PTFE part in its designated space in the PDMS construct.\nAdd 2.5 mL of fresh prewarmed complete medium to each construct.\nNOTE: Maintain the sterility throughout the procedure and operate on one construct at a time. Maintain the rest of the constructs in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until use.",
    "Once all PDMS constructs are placed and electrically connected to the platform, bring the platform back into the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nConnect the electrical and mechanical source.\nConfigure the stimulation program. Specify electrical and mechanical stimulation regimes through the user interfaces of the electrical stimulator and the application, which controls the mechanical stimulation. Set the synchronism as follows.\nSwitch on the electrical stimulator. Wait for the main menu to appear in the display.\n\t\t\nThen, select Option 2: Edit sequence + Enter.\nEdit the sequence Menu as follows.\n\t\t\t\nUse the Mode tab to select either voltage or current. Select current by clicking + and press Enter.\nFor the Amplitude tab, select 1 (mA) with +/- and press Enter.\nFor the Period (T), select 1000 (ms) with +/- and press Enter.\nSet the Pulse duration (Tw) to 2 (ms) with +/- and press Enter.\nFor the Trigger mode tab, select External by software and press Enter.\nBack in the main menu, select Option 4: Generate sequence and press Enter.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: The electrical stimulator rests in the standby until it receives a trigger command from the mechanical stimulator application through the serial port.\nPerform the following steps in the mechanical stimulation section of the control application panel (Figure 2C).\n\t\t\nWrite 1,000 (ms) in the Pulse Period text control.\nWrite 500 (ms) in the ON time (Tw) text control to set the mechanical pulse duration.\nWrite 2,000 (AU) in the Excursion text control to deliver a 10% construct elongation. This is the number of steps in the linear control motor.",
    "NOTE: The stimulation protocol applied here consists of alternating-current 2 ms monophasic square-wave pulses of 50 mV/cm at 1 Hz and 10% stretching for 7 days. The rise and fall times of the mechanical pulse are set at 100 ms, to roughly imitate the shape of the hearth pressure pulse. Also, the repetition mode is set to Continuous and there is a counter displaying the number of pulses.\nChange the media 2x a week (Monday and Thursday afternoon). First, remove the old media; next, add the warm media on the sides of the PDMS support, never directly on the cell pool.\nNOTE: If the cells have a high growth rate, the media should be changed 3x a week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). It is necessary to disconnect and reconnect all cables, but there is no need to remove the culture plates and electrodes from their place.\nCollect the samples after the experimentation is performed.\n4. Sample Collection at the End of the Experimentation (Day 7)\nFor RNA analyses\nWash the construct 2x with 3 mL of 1x PBS for 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd 3 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to each plate (enough to cover the whole construct) and wait for 5 min at 37 °C.\nAfter the cells are detached, add 2 mL of complete medium to inactivate the trypsin-EDTA.\nCollect all cells in a 15 mL tube and wash the construct 2x with 3 mL of PBS to collect any remaining cells.\nCentrifuge at 230 x g for 5 min at 22 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of PBS.\nTransfer the cell solution to a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge at 230 x g for 5 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and store the pellet at -80 °C in 700 µL of lysis reagent for further RNA isolation.\nIsolate RNA using a commercial kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nReverse-transcribe the isolated RNA using the kit and random hexamers, according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nFor small RNA concentrations, preamplify and, then, dilute 1:5 with RNase-free water before subsequent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is performed. Continue with the standard protocol for real-time RT-PCR and check main cardiac markers.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical cardiac markers comprise early and late markers from different categories, such as cardiac transcription factors (myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2A [MEF2A], GATA-binding protein 4 [GATA-4]) and structural (cardiac troponin I [cTnI], cardiac troponin T [cTnT], α-actinin) and calcium regulation (Connexin43 [Cx43], sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase [SERCA2])30. Protein isolation can also be performed if needed. Simultaneous RNA and protein isolation can be performed with the same sample, using commercially available reagents and kits (Table of Materials) if the sample quantity is less.\nFor immunostainings\nNOTE: This is performed directly on the cells attached to the cell pool of the PDMS construct. Therefore, we recommend placing, every time, 1 cm x 1 cm of paraffin film on the top of the cell pool, apart from the plate lid, to minimize the evaporation of the incubation solutions.\n\t\nWash the construct 2x with 3 mL of PBS for 5 min at room temperature.\nFix the cells attached to the construct with 2 mL of 10% formalin for 15 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells 3x with 3 mL of PBS for 5 min at room temperature. For long-term storage, leave the samples in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide at 4 °C.\nPermeabilize the cells with 3 mL of PBS + 0.5% detergent (3x, each time 5–10 min, at room temperature).",
    "Incubate the cells with 100 µL of PBS + 10% horse serum + 0.2% detergent + 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h, to block nonspecific antibody binding.\nIncubate the cells with 100 µL of PBS + 10% horse serum + 0.2% detergent + 1% bovine serum albumin + primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. For example, primary antibodies against Cx43 (1:100), sarcomeric α-actinin (1:100), GATA-4 (1:50), MEF2 (1:25), and SERCA2 (1:50).\nWash 3x with 3 mL of PBS at room temperature for 5 min.\nIncubate the cells with 100 µL of PBS + secondary antibody at room temperature in the dark for 1 h.\nNOTE: Secondary antibodies conjugated with different fluorophores and a counterstaining agent were used.\nWash them 3x with 3 mL of PBS at room temperature in the dark for 5 min.\nIncubate the cells with 100 µL of nuclear staining (0.1 µg/mL) in PBS at room temperature in the dark for 15 min.\nWash them 3x with 3 mL of PBS at room temperature in the dark for 5 min.\nStore the samples in 3 mL of PBS with 0.1% sodium azide at 4 °C until the acquisition.\nNOTE: Microscope acquisition is possible on inverted fluorescent and confocal microscopes with long-working distance objectives because the construct thickness is about 0.5 mm.\nSubscription Required.
