    "1. Construction of GFP Tagged EGL-4 Expressing Animals\nClone the translational fusion GFP::EGL-4 under the promoter for the odr-3 gene (use 2678 bp directly upstream of the start codon): (p)odr-3::GFP::EGL-4. The odr-3 promoter drives expression in the amphid neuron pairs: AWA; AWB; AWC; and weakly in ASH.\nInject the plasmid (p)odr-3::GFP::EGL-4 into wildtype (N2) animals at 50 ng/μl with the co-injection markers using standard germ-line transformation techniques8: (p)ofm-1::GFP9 (25 ng/μl), and (p)odr-1::dsRed10 (25 ng/μl). The odr-1 promoter drives expression in the AWC and AWB amphid neuron pairs, and the ofm-1 promoter drives expression in the coelomocytes.\nSubject the transgenic animals expressing the extrachromosomal arrays detailed in Step 1.2 to the Ultra Violet (UV)/trimethylpsoralen (TMP) integration protocol11.\nBleach synchronize the animals12 and cultivate them on Nematode Growth Media (NGM) plates containing OP50 E. coli to the L4 stage. Wash L4 animals off NGM plates with M9 buffer to remove OP50 E. coli bacteria.\nRemove M9 buffer and add 50-100 μl of 30 μg/ml TMP working solution onto the worm pellet in the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Wrap the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube in foil to block ambient light, and agitate gently on a rotator for 15 min in the foil-wrapped 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Transfer the worms in the TMP/worm solution to a large unseeded NGM plate.\nExpose the worms on the NGM plate to UV 350 μJ(X100) using a Stratalinker 2400. Then add worms to an OP50 containing NGM plate and incubate in the dark for 5 hr.\nPick 50 transgenic worms to approximately 10 seeded plates (2-5 worms each plate). Transfer P0's to new plates every 24 hr for 3 days.",
    "Pick 250 clonal F1 animals (1 animal per plate). Clone out 2-4 F2 animals from each F1 plate. Check F3 animals to look for a 100% transmission line by looking at (p)ofm-1::GFP expression pattern under a dissecting fluorescent microscope.\nOutcross the final integrated line(s) with wildtype N2 animals 5 times. We will refer to the final integrated line as pyIs500, and the GFP-tagged EGL-4 molecule as GFP::EGL-4.\n2. Cultivation and Maintenance of Animals for Nuclear Translocation Assays\nCultivate the pyIs500 animals at 25 °C on standard 10 cm NGM plates (see below for recipe) seeded with OP50 E. coli bacteria13 (Figure 1).\nOn Day 1, pick four to five L4 pyIs500 animals from plates cultivated at 25 °C onto five separate 10 cm OP50 E. coli seeded plates and incubate at 25 °C (that is, 4-5 L4 animals per plate).\nOn Day 4, wash adult populations of pyIs500 animals off the large NGM plates using S-Basal buffer (see below for recipe). Use disposable glass pipettes to transfer animals, as they will stick to the side of plastic pipette tips.\n3. Long-term Odor Induced Nuclear Translocation Assays\nWash the pyIs500 animals 3 times in S-Basal to remove bacteria. Do not centrifuge animals between washes; rather allow the animals to settle by gravity in a stationary 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. It is critical to ensure all bacteria is removed, and that NGM pates are free from contamination, as residual bacteria will negatively affect the outcome of the translocation assay. Also, we have found that autoclaving the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes produces a \"sticky\" property on the interior walls of the tube that causes animals to stick to the sides, and so use non-autoclaved 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "While animals are settling between washes, make up the adaptation solution. Add 100 ml of S-Basal buffer to a 100 ml graduating cylinder. Add adapting odor to the S-Basal and seal the cylinder using a strip of Parafilm. If performing benzaldehyde adaptation add 7.5 μl of benzaldehyde to 100 ml of S-Basal, for butanone adaptation add 11 μl of 2-butaone to 100 ml of S-Basal. Gently invert (do not shake) the graduating cylinder containing S-Basal and odor 30 times to create a uniform emulsion.\nAfter the final wash in S-Basal, allow the animals to settle and remove all liquid. Label one tube \"+ve\" or \"adapt\" and the other tube \"-ve\" or \"unadapt\". Then add 1 ml of the adaptation mix to the adaptation microcentrifuge tube (+ve), and add 1 ml of S-Basal to the unadapted control microcentrifuge tube (-ve). Try to keep numbers of animals between 100 and 200 in each tube. With some practice, it is possible to estimate the approximate number of animals in a pellet by eye.\nPlace a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube cap protector to each tube (prevents lids from popping open) and place the tubes on a rotator for 80 min. We have found that odor exposure between 60 min and 80 min yields similar results (both result in long-term adaptation responses). However, 80 min exposure provides more consistent results in our hands. Thus all our long-term adaptation assays are standardized by using an 80 min odor exposure (Figure 2).\nAfter 80 min, wash animals 3 times in S-Basal. Allow animals to settle by gravity between each wash.\n4. Short-term Odor-induced Nuclear Translocation Assays",
    "In the case of short-term odor adaptation, use the same protocol as per long-term odor-induced translocation assays (Steps 3.1-3.4), however instead of incubating the pyIs500 animals in adapting odor for 80 min, use a 30 min exposure. The quantification of odor-induced nuclear translocation assays outlined below (Step 5) is the same for long-term and short-term exposures.\n5. Scoring the Odor-induced Nuclear Translocation Event\nMake 2% agarose pads containing 5 mM sodium azide (NaN3) by dissolving gel electrophoresis agarose in dH20. Place a single drop of molten agarose containing NaN3 on a glass microscope slide. Immediately place another glass microscope slide on the first slide to flatten the drop of molten agarose. Leave for 30 sec, and then gently tease apart the microscope slides leaving one microscope slide with a flat agarose pad of ~1 mm.\nAfter the final wash in S-Basal, allow the worms to settle in the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and remove all liquid. Then add the animals drop-wise onto the agarose pads of several microscope slides. It's important to keep the numbers of animals per slide to between 50 and 100. Too many animals per slide will complicate scoring and often create a scattering glow after blue-light excitation. Excess liquid may be wicked from the agarose pad by using a small Kim-wipe. Place a 0.5 mm glass cover-slip onto the pad and let stand for 2 min to allow for the NaN3 to immobilize the animals. Note, animals can be recovered from the slides after scoring. The animals will recover from the NaN3 anesthetic after ~1 hr if transferred to a seeded NGM plate into a drop of M9 Buffer.",
    "At this point it is imperative that each experimenter devise a key to track which slide is the experimental (+ve) slide and which slide is the control (-ve) slide, and pass the slides to another person that will blindly score the GFP:EGL-4 localization pattern. This will control for any experimenter bias.\nScore between 50 and 100 animals per slide using an upright fluorescent microscope with 10X, 40X and 63X magnification objectives and GFP/RFP filters. Firstly, locate animals under 10X magnification using bright-field illumination. Secondly, locate the AWC neuron by turning off the bright-field illumination and using the RFP filter. The (p)odr-1::dsRed drives expression in AWB and AWC neurons. The AWC neurons have distinctive oval shaped cell bodies as compared with AWB cell bodies which are smaller and circular in shape (Figure 2).\nOnce the AWC cell body has been located, switch to the GFP filter and record the localization of GFP:EGL-4 as nuclear or cytoplasmic. Using a counter allows the experimenter to keep looking into the eyepiece while scoring the slide. Note: Steps 5.1-5.5 are repeated at least 3 times on separate days to produce statistically significant data (Figures 1-2).\n6. Monitoring GFP-tagged EGL-4 during the Recovery from Long-term Odor Adaptation\nAfter Step 3.5, divide the populations of pyIs500 animals into multiple aliquots and score for nuclear versus cytoplasmic GFP::EGL-4 in the AWC at time point zero (that is, after 80 min exposure) and multiple subsequent time points (Figure 3).\nTransfer both the control (-ve) and experimental (+ve) animals using disposable glass pipettes onto NGM plates.\nAllow animals to recover for various lengths of time and re-examine the localization of GFP::EGL-4in AWC at each time point as in Steps 5.1 to 5.5.\n7.
