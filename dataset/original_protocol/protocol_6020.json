    "PDL-coating of dishesPut 1 ml PDL (1 mg∙ml-1 dissolved in MilliQ-water) per 35 mm dish and incubate it for 20 min at room temperature.Rinse the dish twice with sterile MilliQ-water.Store dried dishes at 4 °C (recommended storage duration: ≤ 5 months).Note: PDL-coating is required for the cells to stay attached during rapid solution exchange in the experiment.  Cell cultureCulture Tet-on HEK293 cells, stably transfected with the GFP-SERT-pcDNA4-TO plasmid (Hilber et al., 2005), in maintenance medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Use 5 ml for a 25 cm2 dish. Split cells, at 80% confluency. Detach them with PBS/EDTA and spin them down at 80 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the pellet in a small volume of maintenance medium (e.g., 200 μl for a 25 cm2 dish).Induce the expression of GFP-SERT in Tet-on HEK293 cells with tetracycline, twenty-four hours prior to the experiment. Plate cells at low density (2,000-4,000 cells ml-1) onto PDL-coated 35 mm dishes containing 2 ml maintenance medium supplied with 1 μg∙ml-1 tetracycline.Cleaning of the perfusion system and positioning of the perfusion manifold tipClean the Octaflow perfusion system and manifold using 1% tergazyme (10 g tergazyme dissolved in 1 L MilliQ-water; prewarmed to 37 °C, incubation time 30 min) followed by 7-10 wash steps with MilliQ-water. Fill the Octaflow tanks with extracellular solution and connect them with the manifold tubing. Ensure that no air bubbles are trapped within the tubing. For the positioning of the manifold tip, immerse the manifold tip into deionized water and start applying extracellular solution using a pressure of 400 mmHg. Note: Due to the different refractive indexes of the deionized water and the extracellular solution, the liquid flow is traceable.  Position the manifold tip at a 45° angle. Ensure uniform, rapid application of solution to the cell (Figures 1A and 1B).",
    "Check the application speed of each tank by the application flow angle that should be in the range of 10°-20°. At larger angles the solution exchange rate drops below 10 s-1. Increase the application pressure if required (Figure 1C). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190101/20190101222929_4502.jpgFigure 1. Scheme depicting the position of the manifold-tip with respect to the recorded cell. A. Overview. Dashed box indicates magnified region depicted in B and C. B. Front view: The manifold-tip is positioned in a 45° angle above the cell. C. Top view (60x magnification): The flow angle has to be in the range between 10° and 20°. The application pressure must be increased, if flow angles greater than 20° are observed. Fabrication of patch pipettesPull patch pipettes from borosilicate glass (Rae and Lewis, 2004; Oesterle, 2018). The desirable range of resistances is between 2 and 5 MΩ when using the intracellular solution specified in the recipe section. For measurements of the pipette resistance, see DeFelice, 1997. Coat the tip of a patch pipette with Sylgard to reduce the stray capacitance (CS) of the pipette and fluctuations thereof (Figure 2). We applied Sylgard onto the patch pipette tip, utilizing a standard 200 μl plastic pipette tip. To accelerate hardening of Slygard, we used a hot-air gun. Fluctuations of CS will interfere with the measurements by introducing artifacts in amplitude changes in membrane capacitance (CM). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190101/20190101222948_1184.jpgFigure 2.

Voltage protocol for recording the membrane parametersNote: The time constant of the transient current elicited by a square pulse depends on the cell size. Set the duration of the voltage pulse such that the pulse is sufficiently long to charge the cell membrane completely (i.e., 5 times Tau). This is 2-5 ms for most HEK293 cells. Note also that the resolution of CM can be improved by increasing the amplitude of the stimulating voltage pulse (UStim).  Measuring the impulse response function of the recording apparatusThe impulse response must be re-recorded, if changes to the apparatus are made that affect the signal path, the sampling frequency or the corner frequency of the low-pass filter (i.e., replacement of the amplifier, digitizer (Digidata 1440) (BNC-cables etc.). Mount a 10 MΩ resistor between the signal input and the ground input of the head-stage. Run the protocol to measure the impulse response function (Step E1, Figure 6A).",
    "Record the stray capacitance of the 10 MΩ resistor. For this, disconnect the 10 MΩ resistor from the ground input while keeping the resistor connected to the signal input of the head-stage and rerun the protocol to measure the impulse response function (Step E1, Figure 6B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190101/20190101223138_3543.jpgFigure 6. Illustration of how to record the impulse response function  Patch clamp recordings (for a detailed description see DeFelice, 1997) Fill the patch pipette with intracellular solution and mount it onto the electrode holder. Immerse the patch electrode into the bath solution while applying positive pressure to the electrode holder. We apply pressure to the electrode holder by using a 1 ml plastic syringe, which is connected to the electrode holder via a silicone tube. The positive pressure produced by attaching the 1 ml syringe to the closed tubing system is sufficient to cause liquid outflow from the pipette tip. This prevents clogging of the pipette tip. Remove the pipette voltage offset by using the pipette offset potentiometer on the patch-clamp amplifier. Formation of giga-seal: Lower the pipette onto the cell until the pipette resistance increases by 10%. Apply negative pressure to the electrode holder. Proceed with the next step when the seal resistance is > 1 GΩ. Cancel the pipette capacitance by utilizing the fast capacitance compensation circuitry of the patch-clamp amplifier. Note: Once adjusted, do not change it during the experiment. In most cases, it is not possible to fully compensate the stray capacitance with the compensation circuitry. We therefore recommend recording the remaining stray capacitance of the pipette and the membrane patch beneath it, using the protocol described in Step E2. The recorded currents can later be subtracted from the membrane currents obtained with the protocol to measure the membrane capacitance of the whole cell (Step E3).",
    "Open the cell by applying a short pulse of negative pressure to the electrode holder. Wait two minutes after establishing the whole-cell configuration to allow for the equilibration of the cytosolic solution with the pipette solution. Record the currents elicited by the protocol to measure whole cell membrane capacitance (Step E3). Apply the ligand with the perfusion device. Loop the recording protocol if the experiment exceeds the duration of 50 s."
