The human MYCN-amplified NB cell line, IMR-5-luc-eGFP, is used.\nPreparation of IMR-5-luc-eGFP cells\nSeed IMR5-5-luc-eGFP cells at low passages (4–10) in T175 flasks at approximately 30% confluency in RPMI-1640 complete medium.\nAt approximately 80%–90% confluency, trypsinize and collect cells in conical tubes.\nCentrifuge cells for 5 min at 300 × g.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend cell pellet at a density of 2.5 × 107/mL (for the injection of 5.0 × 106 cells per mouse) in PBS. Prepare an excess of 20% of cells.\nTo ensure single cell suspension, filter resuspended cells through a 40 μm cell strainer before counting cells is recommended.\nKeep cells on ice until inoculation.\nCritical: A single-cell suspension is crucial for avoiding cell emboli and vessel occlusion in mice (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nPerform intravenous injection\nUse NSG female mice at the age of 5–7 weeks.\nMix the cell suspension and intravenously inject 0.2 mL of the suspension (5.0 × 106 cells) into the tail vein of each mouse.\nDetection of tumor growth in mice 10 days after tumor inoculation.\nInject 0.2 mL of the D-luciferin solution (15 mg/mL) into the peritoneal cavity of each mouse.\nPlace the mice inside of an anesthetic induction chamber to sedate them with isoflurane gas (2.5% at a flow rate of 2 L/min for approximately 2–3 min).\nAt ten minutes after D-luciferin injection, place the anesthetized mice into the IVIS imaging chamber.\nAcquire images for 1 min.\nRecord the total photon flux in the region of interest to monitor tumor growth.",
    "Critical: The proper imaging time needs to be optimized for each cell line in each mouse model.\nMetastatic tumors form 3–4 weeks post inoculation and are found in clinically relevant sites such as the femur, spine, brain and abdominal cavity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Mice are randomized based on their bioluminescence signal strength and grouped for CAR T cell treatment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1165-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Metastatic IMR-5 NB cells in mice\nThe metastases are found in femur, abdomen, liver, spine and other sites. The white circled areas indicate tumors. The eGFP signal was detected by using the Nightsea fluorescence viewing system. Scale bar, 1 cm.\nNote: Although NSG mice are used in this section, IMR-5-luc-eGFP cells also form metastatic tumors in athymic nude mice (Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nEstablishment of an orthotopic neuroblastoma mouse model\nTiming: ≈3–4 weeks\nThis protocol is adapted from (Khanna et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) and describes how to establish the orthotopic NB xenograft mouse model and monitor tumor growth in vivo.\nPreparation of IMR-5-luc-eGFP cells: Prepare a single-cell suspension of IMR-5 to accommodate the injection of 0.25 × 106/mL cells per mouse (plus an excess of 20%). The cells are then resuspended in ice-cold Matrigel matrix equaling 30 μL per injection and kept on ice.\nCritical: An accurate cell count is critical for a successful experiment. If too many cells are injected, the animals will develop too large a tumor burden that may not be amenable to CAR T-cell therapy.\nPreparation of mice: shave the left flank of 5 to 7-week-old female NSG mice to expose a 1 cm × 1 cm area overlaying the spleen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1165-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Orthotopic implantation of NB cells\n(A) Mice are shaved in preparation for surgery.\n(B) A transverse cut is made and dissected down to visualize the spleen.",
    "(C and D) (C) The adrenal gland is visualized (black arrow) and (D) tumor cells are injected into the periadrenal fat pad. Images (C1) pre- and (D1) post-injection demonstrate swelling of the fat pad after cells are injected. The star indicates the tip of the injection needle.\n(E) The peritoneum is closed with one basic surgical knot.\n(F) The skin is closed with clips. Scale bar, 1 cm.\nOrthotopic implantation of IMR-5-luc-eGFP cells (approximately 15 min/mouse):\nPlace mice under anesthesia with isoflurane and positioned in a lateral right recumbent position.\nMake a 1.0 cm transverse cutaneous incision at the height of the spleen and carefully dissect down.\nUpon penetration of the peritoneum, lift the spleen cranially to visualize the left adrenal gland (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nUsing a 29-gauge non-hub needle, inject 30 μL of the tumor cell suspension into the periadrenal fat pad (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, 3C1, 3D, and 3D1). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nClose the peritoneum with vicryl sutures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) and the skin with clips (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nInject 30 μL buprenorphine extended-release subcutaneously for analgesia. For supportive care, inject 0.5 mL of 0.9% normal saline subcutaneously. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nMonitor post-operative animals for the occurrence of pain, bleeding, or other complications.\nRemove clips 14 days after surgery.\nNote: The timing of clips removal may vary as different institutions have own animal care committee requirements.\nDetection of tumor growth in mice\nInject 0.2 mL of the 15 mg/mL D-luciferin solution into each mouse.\nPlace the mice inside an anesthetic induction chamber. The mice are sedated with isoflurane gas (2.5% at a flow rate of 2 L/min) approximately 2–3 min after D-luciferin injection.\nPlace the mice into the IVIS imaging chamber.\nAcquire images five minutes after D-luciferin injection for a total acquisition time of 60 s.",
    "The total photon flux in the region of interest is determined and used to monitor tumor growth.\nTumors grow orthotopically within 3–4 weeks from the implantation date. In addition to the primary adrenal tumor, spontaneous distant metastasis can be found in orthotopic NB mouse models (Khanna et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). NB tumor cells are also detected in bone marrow. Different NB tumor cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) can be utilized but tumor growth timelines need to be rigorously established to ensure reproducibility.\nRandomize and group mice for CAR T cell treatment based on their bioluminescence signal strength.\nCritical: The use of young animals is important because older mice will develop involution of their fat pad. Smaller fat pads will increase the risk of fatality due to puncturing the aorta, which is located immediately medial and dorsal to the fat pad.\nLentivirus production\nTiming: ≈5–7 days\nThe second-generation of lentivirus production system is used in this protocol. Three plasmids include the CAR-expressing transfer vector (pMH303), envelope vector (pMD2.G), and packaging vector (psPAX2). Users need to follow the standard operating procedure for safe handling of lentivirus at own institution.\nLentivirus production\nSeed Lenti-X™ 293T cells at low passages (4–10) at a density of 20 × 106 cells per Poly-D-lysine–coated 15 cm dish.\nThe following day, transfect Lenti-X™ 293T cells with the CT3 CAR plasmid (pMH303), envelope (pMD2.G) and packaging (psPAX2) plasmids at a ratio of 4:1:3. Use lipofectamine 2000 as the transfection reagent.\nRemove medium, replace with fresh DMEM complete medium 6–12 h after transfection.\nHarvest the lentivirus-containing supernatants 48–72 h post-transfection. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min and then filter through a sterile 0.45 μm filter.\nTo concentrate lentivirus, combine 1 volume of Lenti-XTM Concentrator with 3 volumes of clarified supernatant.",
    "Incubate mixture at 4°C for 30 min to overnight (12–24 h). Centrifuge sample at 1,500 × g for 45 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove supernatant, gently resuspend the pellet in 1/20th to 1/100th of the original volume using AIM-V complete medium.\nImmediately titrate lentivirus or store at –80°C in single-use aliquots.\nNote: Though we use Lenti-X™ 293T cells, standard 293T cells can also be used for lentivirus production. In addition to lipofectamine 2000, other transfection reagents including Calfectin (SignaGen Laboratories) and Polyethylenimine are also highly efficient in producing lentivirus.\nLentivirus titration\nSeed Lenti-X™ 293T cells at a density of 1×105 cells in 12-well cell culture plate.\nThe following day, use one well to count cells. It should be between 1–3 × 105 cells/well.\nPrepare dilution of concentrated lentivirus as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Remove medium, and transduce cells with 1 μL, 10−1 μL, and 10−2 μL of lentivirus in 1 mL of fresh DMEM complete medium. Keep one well as non-transduced control.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1165-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Graphical example of lentivirus titration in a 12-well plate format\nOne well of cells is used for counting the cell number. One well of non-lentiviral transduced cells is included as control (ctrl). Three dilutions of concentrated lentivirus are used in this protocol.\nAfter 48–72 h of transduction, trypsinize and collect cells in microcentrifuge tubes.\nResuspend the pellet in FACS buffer containing 1 μg/mL cetuximab. The non-infected cells also need to be stained with cetuximab as Lenti-X™ 293T cells also express hEGFRt. Keep cells at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 20 min. Wash cells once with PBS.\nResuspend the pellet in FACS buffer containing the RPE F(ab’)2 goat anti-human IgG antibody (1:200 dilution). Stain cells for 12 min at room temperature in the dark, and wash them once with PBS.",
    "Fix lentiviral-transduced cells in 1% formaldehyde in PBS and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Wash cells once with PBS.\nResuspend the pellet in FACS buffer and analyze cells for CAR expression using a flow cytometer.\nCalculate titer using the following equation: Titer (transduction unit/mL, TU/mL)= (F×Cn/V) × DF; F= % of hEGFRt positive cells/100; Cn=number of cells; V= volume of supernatant in (mL); DF= dilution fold. Chose dilutions yielding 1%–10% hEGFRt positives for titer calculations. The expected viral titer is ≥5×107 TU/mL. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nNote: This protocol measures the functional lentiviral titer by flow cytometry. Other titration methods including measurement of p24 antigen by ELISA and quantification of the number of integrated DNA lentiviral copies by real-time PCR are frequently used. Different methods may result in titer difference.\nCAR T cell production\nTiming: ≈9–11 days\nWe use non-transduced T cells (mock T) as the control T cells in this protocol. For tumors lacking the expression of CD19, the CD19-targeted CAR in the same vector backbone (pMH376) is highly recommended as an irrelevant control.\nT cell activation (Day 1)\nIsolate T cells from PBMCs using the EasySep™ Human T Cell Enrichment Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.stemcell.com/easysep-human-t-cell-enrichment-kit.html[href=https://www.stemcell.com/easysep-human-t-cell-enrichment-kit.html]).\nThaw T cells and seed 1 × 106 cells per well in a 24-well cell culture plate in 1 mL AIM-V CST complete medium supplemented with 40 IU/mL human IL-2.\nWash Dynabeads human T-activator CD3/CD28 once with PBS and then resuspend beads in complete medium.\nAdd Dynabeads human T-activator CD3/CD28 (4 × 107 beads/mL) to T cells at a bead-to-cell ratio of 2:1. Cells are activated 24 h before transduction.\nNote: In addition to purified T cells, PBMCs can be used to produce CAR T cells.\nLentiviral transduction of T cells (Day 2–3)",
    "Add protamine sulfate into each well to maintain a final concentration of 10 μg/mL and replenish the medium with 100 IU/mL of IL-2.\nAdd CAR-expressing lentivirus with a titer above 5×107 TU/mL into activated T cells at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. Calculate the volume of desired lentivirus using the following equation: Multiplicity of Infection (MOI)= Titer (TU/mL) × Volume (mL) / Cell Number\nCentrifuge the cells at 1000 x g for 120 min.\nMaintain the culture in 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h (Day 2).\nRepeat the transduction in 24 h (Day 3).\nCritical: High-quality CAR-expressing lentiviruses are necessary to achieve good transduction efficiency.\nCAR T cell expansion (Day 4–11)\nOn Day 4, collect the T cells in a 15 mL conical tube.\nRemove Dynabeads from cells with DynaMag magnet.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min and discard supernatant.\nResuspend CAR T cells in complete T cell medium supplemented with 100 IU/mL of IL-2 at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/mL in a 6-well cell culture plate.\nAssess CAR T cell growth every other day with fresh medium/IL-2 added as required. CAR T cells are usually expanded into a T75 flask from Day 6–7. 10 to 50-fold of T cell expansion is expected at the end of culture (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1165-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Proliferation of CT3 CAR T cells from eight healthy donors\nCritical: Excessive T cell density decreases cell viability.\nAssessment of transduction efficiency by detecting either GPC2 binding or hEGFRt expression.\nResuspend 1 × 106 T cells in FACS buffer containing 1 μg/mL human GPC2-Fc protein or 1 μg/mL anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab. Stain cells for 20 min at room temperature and then washed once with PBS.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in FACS buffer containing the RPE F(ab’)2 goat anti-human IgG antibody (1:200 dilution) to detect GPC2-Fc binding or hEGFRt expression together with other fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to mark CD3, CD8, and CD4.\nAfter incubating the samples for 12 min at room temperature in the dark, wash cells once and analyze them using a flow cytometer. Add DAPI right before the analysis to stain dead cells.\nDraw the live cell gate, then draw the gate of CD3+ T cells, subsequently plot a histogram for CAR expression. Among the transduced cells, typically >50% have CAR expression (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1165-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Measurement of transduction efficiency by flow cytometry\nFrom the live cell gates, gates are drawn on CD3+ T cells and populations plotted for CAR expression. The CAR expression can be detected by its binding to GPC2 or hEGFRt expression (detected by cetuximab). Of the transduced T cells, nearly 65% are CAR-positive.\nContinue to assess CAR T cell growth until the expected cell number is reached.\nNote: The CAR transduction efficiency varies significantly among T cell donors. Therefore, it is recommended to test the efficiency in a small-scale experiment first before committing to a donor for in vivo experiments.\nRandomization tumor-bearing mice and administration of experimental molecules\nWhen bioluminescence signals reach the enrollment threshold (usually >107 photons/seconds), tumor-bearing mice are randomized into different groups with comparable tumor sizes as defined by total photon flux and used for experimental testing (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). For example, small molecules, antibodies, recombinant immunotoxins, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies, or CAR T cells can be tested. In this protocol, CAR T cells are used as an example.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1165-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Experimental schematic of the IMR-5 metastatic and orthotopic mouse models",
    "IMR-5 metastatic and orthotopic tumors are established 3–4 weeks prior to CAR T cell injection. Both models can be used to test various experimental therapies for NB. The treatment schedules vary based on the therapy type. Upon therapy initiation, mice are monitored for tumor growth, weight loss, and other symptoms of clinical change for at least 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, tissues are harvested for further correlative studies.\nPreparation of T cell product for injection\nTiming: ≈2 days\nThe day before CAR T cell infusion, randomize mice into the different experimental groups based on the bioluminescence signal of their tumors. These signals are also used as the baseline measurement.\nThe following day, count mock and CAR T cells. Each mouse receives 5–10 × 106 CAR T cells. This is to say the total T cell number is adjusted to encompass the respective CAR T cell number. The number of mock T cells used for the injections corresponds to the total T cell number. E.g., the measured transduction efficiency is 65%. Thus, 7.7 × 106 total T cells contain 5 × 106 CAR T cells. Accordingly, 7.7 × 106 Mock T cells are injected into control animals.\nResuspend T cells in a volume to accommodate an injection volume of 0.2 mL per mouse. Injections are administered via the tail vein.\nMonitoring of animals\nTiming: ≈4–7 weeks\nMice are monitored bi-weekly for the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD can manifest as weight loss, scruffy appearance, decreased activity, and/or hair loss (Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]). The tumor growth is tracked longitudinally with weekly bioluminescence imaging.\nMonitor animals by weekly bioluminescence imaging as shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]. As part of their clinical assessment, weekly weights are obtained.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1165-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Weekly bioluminescence imaging of IMR-5-Luc-eGFP-bearing mice",
    "(A) In the experimental metastasis model, CAR T cells regressed tumors in 100% of the mice and bioluminescence signal was undetectable, whereas the signal increased over time in the untreated group.\n(B) Bioluminescence images of therapy cohorts using the orthotopic with spontaneous metastasis model. During week 4, there is one mouse in the untreated control cohort that lacks a signal, which was attributed to poor clinical status and decreased cardiac output, resulting in hypo-circulation of the D-luciferin. The signal intensity in the untreated cohort increased over time, while there were 3 animals in the therapy group that responded to therapy and showed almost undetectable levels of bioluminescence signal.\n(C) The size of tumors in mice corresponding to Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B. Scale bar, 1 cm.\nEnd-of-study evaluations\nTiming: ≈4 days\nAt the end of the experiments, correlative studies are conducted. For example, flow cytometry is used to assess T cell persistence in various organs. T cells can be retrieved from mouse tissues and used for T cell functional analysis. Tumors can be evaluated for their histologic appearance and topographic distribution of T cells in topographic relation to tumor cells (Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nTissue isolation and preservation:\nEuthanize the animals, and dissect their tumors, spleen, and femurs.\nWeigh and photograph the tumors (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).\nFor both spleen and tumor tissues, cut the tissue into three pieces. Fix one piece (no greater than 1.5 cm) in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and use it for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis; snap-freeze one for downstream genomic or proteomic applications; and dissociate the last one into a single cell suspension for T cell isolation via fluorescence-activated cell sorting or magnetic bead isolation.\nFix one femur in 4% PFA, while flush the other one with PBS. Count the produced cells and use them for flow cytometry applications.\nFlow cytometry analysis:",
    "Count the single cells from mouse tissues and use 1 × 106 cells per flow cytometric test.\nAnalyze the cells isolated from tumor, spleen, and the bone marrow by flow cytometry for residual human mock or CAR T cells. We use anti-CD3, CD8, CD4, and GPC2-hFc detected by an anti-human Fc antibody to quantify GPC2-targeting CAR T cells. The cell counts can be normalized to the number of tumor cells and tumor weight.\nQuantify the antigen persistence in isolated tumor cells. We use CT3 antibody and a secondary anti-mouse antibody to detect GPC2 on the tumor cells.\nGenomic/proteomic analysis:\nHomogenize the frozen tissues from step 24 using the Bullet Blender tissue homogenizer. Extract RNA, protein, and genomic DNA. T cells retrieved from mouse tissues (step 24) are similarly processed as the frozen tissues.\nUse RNA and protein for analysis of gene enrichment and identification of CAR interaction partners, etc.\nUse genomic DNA to analyze CAR integration sites and quantify CAR copy numbers in tissues.\nImmunohistochemistry analysis:\nStain paraffin-embedded tumor sections from step 24 for T cell markers (e.g., CD3) as shown in Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1165-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.
