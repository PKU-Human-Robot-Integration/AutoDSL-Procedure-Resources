    "This protocol follows the animal care guidelines of the German and Berlin state law; zebrafish handling was monitored by the local authority for animal protection (LaGeSo, Berlin-Brandenburg).\n1. Obtaining Zebrafish Embryos for Heart Extraction\nCross cardiac reporter zebrafish such as the Tg(myl7:EGFP)twu34 transgenic line9 in order to obtain embryos with heart-specific GFP expression.\nMaintain the embryos in egg water at 28.5 °C until the desired embryonic stage10,11. Ensure that the collected embryo population is homogeneous both genetically and by developmental stage to limit variations in gene expression.\nDechorionate the embryos manually.\n2. Dissecting Zebrafish Embryonic Hearts\nNOTE: Keep all the solutions on ice. If possible, do teamwork: one person dissects the hearts from the embryos while another person sorts the hearts under the fluorescence stereomicroscope. This allows the processing of several hundreds of embryos in a few hours.\nTransfer about 100 embryos into a 1.5 ml centrifugation tube. Anesthetize the embryos with tricaine (0.16 mg/ml in E3 medium). Proceed once the embryos are clearly anesthetized (they do not swim and sediment to the bottom of the tube, but their hearts are still beating).\nRemove the tricaine/E3 solution and wash the embryos once with 1 ml L-15/10% FBS medium and maintain on ice.\n\tNOTE: The L-15/10% FBS medium is important to keep organs and cells alive during the entire dissection procedure until the hearts have been transferred into RNAlater or Trizol.\nAdd 1 ml L-15/10% FBS medium to the embryos and pipette up and down 5-8 times with a Round Gel Loading Tip until the yolk is completely disrupted. Pipette the embryos drop-wise onto the surface of the solution, so that the drop will burst and the embryos are gently disrupted.",
    "NOTE: How vigorously and how often the embryos have to be pipetted up and down depends on the developmental stage of the embryos, i.e. more pipetting is needed at late stages (e.g. at 56 hpf).\nFor the first batch of dissected embryos, assess the integrity of the embryos and the proportion of dissected hearts under a stereomicroscope, since some hearts may remain attached to the embryos if too gently pipetted. Adjust the manner of pipetting for the next rounds of dissection accordingly.\n\tNOTE: Use low retention pipette tips and microcentrifuge tubes to minimize hearts sticking to the plastic.\nApply the sample onto a 100 μm filter placed on a 50 ml centrifugation tube; rinse the 1.5 ml tube with 1 ml L-15/10% FBS medium and then apply this to the filter in order to minimize loss of the sample (some hearts might be sticking to the walls of the tube). Wash the filter twice with 1 ml L-15/10% FBS. In this step the hearts pass through the filter and are collected in the 50 ml tube.\nApply the flow-through onto a 30 μm filter placed onto a 15 ml centrifugation tube and rinse the filter once with 1 ml L-15/10% FBS medium. In this second filtration step, the hearts are retained in the filter and smaller debris is washed off.\nTurn the filter upside down and flush the hearts out of the filter into a 1% agarose-coated petri dish by applying three consecutive washes with 1 ml L-15/10% FBS.\nManually separate GFP-positive hearts from the nonfluorescent embryonic debris (e.g. eye lenses) with a pair of forceps under a fluorescence stereomicroscope and concentrate them in the center of the dish. Collect them according to step 3.",
    "NOTE: If the embryos are older than 24 hpf, the hearts should be beating, indicating that the tissues are still physiologically normal.\n3. Isolating mRNA from Dissected Hearts\nCollect the hearts in the smallest possible volume (e.g. 10 µl) and pipette into a 1.5 ml tube containing 0.75 ml RNAlater (on ice). Verify that no hearts remain in the pipette tip by viewing it under a fluorescence stereomicroscope.\nAlternatively, if a chemical hood is available in the immediate vicinity of the fluorescence microscope, transfer the collected hearts into Trizol (CAUTION) under the chemical hood. This circumvents the possible loss of hearts sticking in the pipette tip and also during centrifugation of the hearts (steps 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7). Pool the hearts from several rounds of isolation into the same tube with Trizol and go directly to step 3.8; the final volume should not exceed 10% of the original Trizol volume.\n\tNOTE: Read the Trizol Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) before use. Handle Trizol reagent under a hood and wear recommended Personal Protective Equipment. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Remove all sources of ignition.\nPool the hearts from several rounds of isolation into the same tube with RNAlater (on ice), as the efficiency of RNA isolation improves with the amount of tissue collected. If the total sample volume exceeds 10% of the original RNAlater volume, use an additional tube with 0.75 ml RNAlater for storage (on ice).\nCentrifuge the samples at 15,700 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to sediment the hearts.",
    "Under a fluorescence stereomicroscope, collect carefully as much supernatant as possible into a 1% agarose-coated petri dish containing 3 ml L-15/10% FBS medium, but do not disturb the sedimented hearts in the bottom of the centrifugation tube. Since up to 15% of the hearts can remain in the supernatant due to the high viscosity of RNAlater, retrieve them as described in step 3.7.\nUnder a chemical hood, add 0.5 ml Trizol to the tube containing the sedimented hearts and keep on ice.\nUnder the fluorescent microscope, transfer the hearts (from step 3.5) from the 1% agarose-coated dish containing the RNAlater/L-15/10% FBS solution into another 1% agarose-coated dish with 3 ml L-15/ 10% FBS to dilute out the RNAlater. Collect the hearts in the center of the petri dish and transfer them in a small volume into the tube of sedimented hearts in Trizol under a chemical hood.\nVortex the 1.5 ml tube containing the hearts in Trizol to disrupt the hearts and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nUnder a chemical hood, add 100 µl chloroform (CAUTION), mix thoroughly and transfer the Trizol/chloroform solution into a 1.5 ml pre-spun PLG tube (centrifuge 30 sec at maximum speed before use). Incubate for 3 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Read the chloroform MSDS before use. Handle chloroform reagent under a hood and wear recommended Personal Protective Equipment. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Keep away from incompatibles such as metals, alkalis.\nCentrifuge the sample at 15,700 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and transfer the aqueous phase into a new 1.5 ml tube.\nAdd 5-10 µg glycogen and 250 µl precooled (at -20 °C) isopropanol; mix well and incubate over night at -20 °C.",
    "Centrifuge the sample at 15,700 x g for 30 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\nWash the pellet with 1 ml 75% ethanol, centrifuge at 15,700 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\nLet the ethanol evaporate by drying the pellet at room temperature until it becomes white (e.g. for 10-15 min).\nAdd 20 µl RNase-free ddH2O to the pellet and incubate for 10-15 min at 55 °C to dissolve the RNA; then keep on ice.\nAssess the RNA concentration and purity by absorbance measurement. Assess the RNA integrity by running the sample on a 1% agarose gel.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
