    "SsoMCM Protein labelling with APBIn the dark, dissolve APB in 100% DMF at a concentration of 40 mM.Notes:Dark conditions can be provided by using LightSafe micro centrifuge tubes, covering Eppendorf tubes in foil or turning off the lights.Use LightSafe micro centrifuge tubes when preparing APB solutions.Use clear micro centrifuge tubes covered in foil in subsequent reactions for easy visualization of a pellet and/or to achieve complete discarding of a supernatant. When measuring APB, quantities as small as ~2 mg can be measured under dark conditions.Use freshly resuspended APB for each new experiment. Discard the unused APB. Dilute the APB to 4 mM in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 10% DMF.Add the diluted APB to a sample of the protein (~10 µM monomer) containing a single reduced cysteine (in 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 75 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol), to achieve a final concentration of 0.4 mM APB and 1% DMF.Note: Cysteines must be reduced before conjugation with APB, followed by gel filtration or dialysis to remove the reducing agent. Alternatively, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) can be used without subsequent removal. Proceed labelling for 2-3 h at room temperature.Preparing silanized coversliDilute poly-L-lysine solution with distilled water for 1:10.Place the coverslips (~15) in a Petri dish.Pour the solution (~20 ml) on the coverslips (make sure the coverslips sink in).Leave it in the solution for 15-30 min.Rinse the coverslips with water three times at Room Temperature (RT).Air dry the coverslips placing a kimwipe on top of the Petri dish (avoid touching the coverslips).Coverslips can be prepared ahead of time and can be stored at RT for several weeks.Preparing annealed fork DNAPrepare stock solutions (100 μM) of each complementary DNA strand in water (DNA 165-3 and DNA 171).",
    "Mix the DNA in equal 1:1 (5 μM) concentration in water or annealing buffer.Note: EDTA (chelates divalent metal ions) and salt in the annealing buffer facilitate duplex stability. But annealing DNA in water has also yielded in a complete duplex. Heat at 95 °C for 5 min and cool at a rate of 1 °C/min to room temperature in a PCR instrument.Preparing the crosslinked protein-DNA complexIncubate APB labelled SsoMCM with fluorescent (Cy3) fork DNA (150 nM) for 10-20 min in 1x CB buffer in 50 µl volumes (maintaining stochiometric ~1:1 MCM6:DNA ratio).Note: Fluorescently labelled DNA is used here, but 32P labelled DNA can also be utilized. Transfer the sample into silanized coverslips. Pipette 50 µl of the sample into the middle of the coverslip.UV irradiate for 15 s (302 nm UV-B).Transfer the sample into an Eppendorf tube.Add 150 µl of post irradiation buffer.Vortex at RT and place at 70 °C for 20 min.Separate the crosslinked protein-DNA complexNext, add 1 µl of 10 mg/ ml Salmon sperm DNA, 30 µl of 3.0 M NaOAc, 750 µl of ice cold 100% ethanol, vortex, and leave on ice for 1-2 h at -80 °C.Spin down the samples in microfuge at 4 °C, 16,000 x g for 30 min.Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with ice cold 70% ethanol.Note: In most of the steps, the DNA pellets are invisible. Discard the supernatant completely and resuspend in the subsequent buffer. Spin down the samples in microfuge at 4 °C, 16,000 x g for 30 min.Remove ethanol and air dry the pellets by inverting on bench for 1 h.Resuspend the pellet in 100 µl: 20 mM NH4OAc, 2% SDS, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 by vortexing.Spin down the samples in microfuge at room temperature, 16,000 x g for 10 min.",
    "Transfer the supernatant into fresh tubes and place in heat block at 90 °C for 2 min.Then, add 1 µl of 2 M NaOH, vortex briefly, and incubate at 90 °C for 20 min.After incubation, pulse spin the samples, add 101 µl 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 µl of 2 M HCl, 1 µl of 2 M MgCl2, 480 µl 100% ethanol, vortex, and place at -80 °C for 1-2 h.Pellet the samples in microfuge at 4 °C at 16,000 x g for 30 min, wash two times with ice cold 70% ethanol, and air dry on bench for 1 h.Resuspend the DNA pellet with 5 µl of 40% glycerol loading buffer containing Orange G dye for gel loading.Electrophorese the samples on a 20% TBE-PAGE (native PAGE) in 1x TBE (Tris base, Boric acid, EDTA) at constant 30 mA for 45 min, and visualize on a Typhoon FLA 9000 imager (GE Healthsciences)."
