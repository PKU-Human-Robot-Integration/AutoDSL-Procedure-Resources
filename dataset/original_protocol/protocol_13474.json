    "The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College (Shantou, China).\n1. Preparations\nApply strict exclusion criteria to select patients and obtain signed informed consent forms12 (Table 1).\nApply the following admission criteria:\n\t\nSelect patients who voluntarily received the two-step PTCSL treatment.\nSelect those patients who were confirmed to have hepatic and extrahepatic bile duct stones by adjuvant examination.\nSelect patients who had undergone previous complicated abdominal surgery, such as partial gastrectomy combined with biliary-intestinal anastomosis or Billroth II reconstruction, or who had anatomical abnormalities and were unable to undergo an endoscopic retrograde cholangiao pancreatography (ERCP) examination.\nSelect patients with liver function preoperatively assessed as Child-Pugh A or B grades.\nSelect patients with normal function of the heart, lung, and other organs.\nEnsure the availability of the laparoscopic imaging system, images of the pneumoperitoneum, Wolf nephroscope, adjustable pressure pump, and hydroelectric lithotripter.\n2. Procedure\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD)\n\t\nInsert an indwelling 8F biliary drainage tube 1 week before the operation to drain and reduce the swelling of bile duct.\nWait for the sinus tract to become stable at 1 week after PTCD.\n\t\tâ€‹NOTE: The puncture methodology must be chosen according to the particular area of bile conduit calculi when operating. For example, the left hepatic duct approach is performed under the xiphoid process and abdominal wall of the lower edge of the right costal arch.\n3. Percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopic lithotomy (PTCSL)\nBefore administering general anesthesia, instruct the patient to lie flat on the operating table. Following general anesthesia, disinfect the surgical site 3x with iodophor.\nInject 20 mL of saline into the bile duct along the drainage tube; pull the PTCD tube out after a guide wire is inserted into it.",
    "For placement of the fascia dilator and sheath, expand the sinus using a 16F expander and join a 16F belt dilator so that the 16F sheath can reach the bile duct where the stone might have been placed.\nAfter locating the stones, use clamping forceps to both break and remove the stones. For hard stones, use a hydraulic lithotripter to break the stone. Wash out small stones and powdered stones using an adjustable pressure pump. At the end of the procedure, leave a drainage tube inside the patient for 1 week (Figure 1).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
