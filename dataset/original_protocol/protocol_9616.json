  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board for conducting human research at The Pennsylvania State University and were consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Set-up\nDisplay all monofilaments with target points between 0.008g (lowest factory setting) and 15 g (a priori ceiling determined during pilot testing).\n\t\nSet out the monofilaments with target forces of 0.008, 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, and 15.0 g.\nSet the monofilaments out on the table so each target level can be easily read by the experimenter.\nSeat the participant in a comfortable chair with a glass of water within arm's reach.\nInstruct the participant that when it is time, they will be asked to close their eyes and stick out their tongue.\n\t\nIdentify the approximate testing location at midline tongue. The testing location should be approximately 10 mm posterior to the tongue tip.\nEncourage the participant to stop regularly and take a sip of water approximately every 5-10 trials or after the first incorrect response for either testing protocol, detection or discrimination.\n\t\tCAUTION: The tongue should gently protrude from mouth such that the tongue tip meets the inferior edge of the lower lip. The participant should not be straining to stick their tongue out as far as possible or it will fatigue quickly and could alter testing results.\n2. Detection threshold estimates",
    "Instruct participant, \"For this test, you will hear me say 'Trial 1' and 'Trial 2'. You will feel a point of pressure in one of these trials. If you think you feel a point of pressure in trial 1, put up 1 finger. If you think you feel a point of pressure in trial 2, put up 2 fingers. If you're not sure, make your best guess. Pressure will always be applied in one of the two trials.\"\nIdentify the starting point for testing: Determine the starting point for all participants for the detection threshold estimates. Published protocol begins at 1.0 g. Researchers strongly suggest the experimenter begins at a suprathreshold level to be sure that the majority of participants can easily identify the first target force.\nTell participant to close their eyes and start the trials\n\t\nSay Trial 1 and pause. Say Trial 2 and pause. Be sure to deliver the pressure in one of these trials such that the monofilament is pressed to the tongue surface until the monofilament buckles. Hold for a second and release.\n\t\t\nUse a random number generator to create a series of 1 or 2. Follow this series to randomly present the stimulus in Trial 1 or Trial 2 (See Supplementary Files 3 & 4). Do not follow a pattern.\nBe deliberate and intentional when applying the pressure such that the stimulus is always clearly delivered in Trial 1 or Trial 2 with a 1-s pause before and after when the Trial is said and when the stimulus is delivered.\nRecord the participant's response (See Supplementary Files 1-4 for examples).\nContinue testing using a 3-down/1-up decision rule to select the next stimulus.\n\t\nMove up to the next monofilament in the series after any incorrect or \"missed\" response.",
    "Ensure that the participant gets three correct responses in a row for the experimenter to move down to the next monofilament in the series.\nStopping point\n\t\nStop testing when a participant has reached his/her stopping point. This is defined as the point when a participant has crossed over or received the test stimulus from the same target monofilament a total of five times.\nIf the participant reaches the lowest available testing target (0.008g), continue delivering this target for 5 consecutive sets before stopping.\nIf the participant reaches the highest testing target (15 g) and cannot correctly identify the target trial, discontinue testing.\nEstimate approximately 5-10 min to complete testing to determine a detection threshold estimate for midline tongue.\n\tNOTE: Stopping points apply regardless of whether the participant gets that last trial correct or incorrect.\n3. Discrimination Threshold Estimates\nTo complete discrimination threshold testing, follow a similar protocol to detection threshold testing.\nInstruct participant, \"For this test, you will still hear me say 'Trial 1' and 'Trial 2' but this time you will feel a point of pressure in both trials. I want you to identify which trial contained the stronger or harder point of pressure. If you think the harder/stronger pressure was in trial 1, put up 1 finger. If you think you the harder/stronger pressure was in trial 2, put up 2 fingers. If you're not sure, make your best guess.\"\nIdentify a starting point\n\t\nBegin test at three monofilament levels above the stopping point for their estimated detection threshold. Use the target stimulus and the monofilament immediately below it in force as the two discrimination stimuli.",
    "Follow this example: If the participant reached a stopping point of 0.008 g, start his/her discrimination testing at 0.07g as the target stimulus and the monofilament directly below it (0.04 g) as the second stimulus delivered.\nTell the participant to close their eyes and start the trials.\n\t\nDeliver the two stimuli after clearly stating Trial 1 or Trial 2. Again, this should be randomized, to avoid a pattern.\nRecord the participant's response (See Supplementary Files 1-4 for examples).\nContinue testing using the same 3-down/1-up and stopping point as used in the protocol for Detection Thresholds.\n\t\nContinue testing with 0.008g with no stimulus delivered in the second trial if the participant reaches 0.008 g during discrimination testing (lowest manufactured level).\nOffer the participant a drink of water if they miss two target stimuli in a row.\nEstimate approximately 5-10 min to complete a discrimination threshold estimate for midline tongue.\n4. Scoring\nRecord all target stimuli and participant response data from threshold estimate testing.\n\t\nRecord the stopping point for each individual for both detection and discrimination\nRecord the number of trials it took for the participant to successfully complete testing\nRecord the participant's threshold average by finding the first time the participant was given the eventual stopping point stimulus. Add all the target stimuli delivered between the first instance of the stopping point target force and the last and divide by the total number of trials. This gives a threshold estimate average that takes in to account the variability within a participant.",
    "Set up data recording sheets using one of the two suggested options. Find examples of completed sheets using the same values can be found in the Supplementary Materials. The first option (Supplementary Files 1 & 2) provides a data sheet and completed example in which the participant's responses and threshold estimate can be easily visualized and recorded on one sheet. The second option (Supplementary Files 3 & 4) provides a data sheet with randomized order for presenting the test stimuli. A separate sheet is needed for each test - detection or discrimination.\n5. Cleaning equipment\nDo not close the monofilaments during testing or immediately following testing until they are cleaned.\nPlace the nylon end of the monofilament between an alcohol prep pad (70% alcohol) and gently squeeze the alcohol pad together while pulling the monofilament through.\nLeave the monofilament in the open position, repeat the cleaning process on each monofilament used.\nAllow the monofilaments to air dry in the open position.\nClose the monofilaments and store them in a clean and dry environment, away from direct sunlight, as described in the manufacturer's directions."
