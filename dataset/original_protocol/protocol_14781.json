    "All patients signed an informed consent form after all typical complications of an ablation procedure such as pericardial effusion, vascular complications at the access site, stroke/TIA, and esophago-atrial fistula, were explained. This fulfilled the requirements of the local ethics committee. No patient subgroup had to be excluded (e.g., patients with pacemakers or ICD); only general contraindications for AF ablation procedures (e.g., contraindication for anticoagulation, hyperthyreosis, valvular AF, etc.) had to be addressed.\n1. Patient Setup\nOn the day of hospital admission, perform a routine physical exam including resting ECG, blood analysis, transesophageal echo and a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the heart on the patient. International normalized ratio (INR) should be between 2 and 3.\nIf novel anticoagulants are used, skip either 1 dose (rivaroxaban) or 2 doses (dabigatran and apixaban) before the procedure.\n2. Ablation Procedure\nPlace the 3D EAMS patches on the patient per manufacturer’s instructions on the thorax (front and back; left and right), neck, and belly. Monitor oxygen saturation using a finger clip, as well as the non-invasive blood pressure. Perform disinfection of the groin region.\nAdminister midazolam (2-3 mg, i.v.) and fentanyl (0.025 mg, i.v.) as premedication to slightly sedate the patient and to provide some analgesics during the puncture of the femoral vessels.\nStart the procedure with the injection of 40 ml of 1% Mepivacain to the left and right groin areas.\nPerform punctures of the femoral vessels. Start the puncture for venous access 1 cm medial to the femoral artery, 1 cm below the connection between symphysis and crista iliaca anterior superior. Perform the arterial puncture 1 cm superior to the venous access sites.",
    "Perform two 7F punctures in the left femoral vein for placing two diagnostic catheters: 1 steerable decapolar catheter for the coronary sinus (CS) and 1 steerable decapolar catheter for the right ventricular apex. After a successful puncture of the vessels, advance a guidewire, remove the puncture needle and place the sheath over the wire per the Seldinger technique.\nNext, perform 2 punctures on the right side: a 4F puncture in the right femoral artery for invasive blood pressure measurements, and an 11F one in the right femoral vein for the transseptal sheath. Before inserting the 11F sheath, control the intravasal position of the wire using fluoroscopy and then place the sheath.\nAdminister heparin (100 IU/kg, i.v.) for anticoagulation.\nCheck the activated clotting time (ACT) every 20 min; the target for the anticoagulation is an ACT between 250 and 350 sec. If necessary, administer boluses of heparin according to ACT measurements.\nDuring the procedure, maintain the patient in a deep analgosedation using midazolam (2-5 mg), fentanyl (0.05-0.1 mg) and propofol (bolus 0.5 mg/kg and constant basal rate of 0.5 mg/kg/h).\nAcquire 2 live fluoroscopy or cine loops using the X-Ray fluoroscopy system in a right anterior oblique projection (RAO 15°) and a left anterior oblique projection (LAO 50°), each approximately 3 sec long (Figure 3 and Video 1)7,14,15.\n\tNOTE: The NFCV projects the catheter tips on these pre-recorded cine loops allowing a non-fluoroscopic placement of the diagnostic catheters.\nPlace one of the diagnostic catheters in the CS by first advancing the catheter tip to the superior vena cava (SVC), then pulling it back slowly and deflecting it to bring it close to the bundle of His.",
    "Deflect the catheter to its maximum allowable curve and perform a clockwise rotation to bring the tip to the CS ostium. Advance the catheter as deep as possible in the CS to achieve a stable position. Then, place a landmark on the catheter tip using the NFCV system to mark the location.\nUse the other diagnostic catheter to place landmarks for superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC) and fossa ovalis (see Figure 1).\nPerform a trans-atrial septal puncture using a long steerable sheath8.\n\t\nInsert a long guidewire to the SVC and verify the position with fluoroscopy. Advance the steerable sheath over the wire to the junction between the SVC and the right atrium (RA). Insert a long needle into the dilator, pull back the sheath until it “jumps” into the fossa ovalis.\nPerform the puncture by advancing the needle and injecting contrast dye (15 ml of Ultravist 300) to verify the correct position of the sheath in the left atrium (LA).\nOnce the needle tip is in the LA, advance the dilator to LA, disconnect it from the sheath and advance the sheath over the dilator into the LA. Deflect the sheath and slowly remove the needle and dilator from the sheath.\nAspire 10 ml of blood from the sheath and carefully flush the sheath with heparinized saline. Flush the sheath with heparinized saline constantly at a flow rate of 2 ml/hr.\n\t\tNOTE: The diagnostic catheter is used for electroanatomical reconstruction of the LA and pulmonary venous anatomy. Coronary sinus catheter remains in place and serves as the reference catheter for the 3D mapping system.",
    "Insert the long sheath in the superior pulmonary veins and perform 2 new fluoroscopy or cine loops in RAO 15° (right PV) and LAO 50° (left PV) during injection of 15 ml of contrast dye (Ultravist 300)7,14,15.\nPerform fusion of the electroanatomical map with 3D reconstructed CT anatomy. Map anatomical landmarks in the LA carefully and use for this co-registration process.\n\t\nFor example, use the junction of the left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) to the LA body. Take at least 10 - 15 points for the fusion process and then double-check and optimize the co-registration process with the roving catheter. Upon completion, the segmented CT model is positioned at an anatomically correct position in 3D space.\nPlace a temperature probe with 3 thermocouples trans-orally to measure the intra-luminal intra-esophageal temperature at the level of the LA.\nInsert the ablation catheter via the transseptal sheath.\nPerform ablation around the ipsilateral pulmonary veins by using power settings of 35 W (anterior) and 25 W (posterior) at an irrigation rate of 17 ml/min.\nIf the intra-luminal temperature exceeds 39 °C, immediately stop the ablation and adjust the power settings, lowering the minimum power to be 20 W. In case of temperature rise despite reduction of energy settings, consider modifying the lesion setting to go more antral if it is too close to the esophagus.\n\t\nIf the temperature still exceeds 41 °C, perform an esophagoscopy the day after the ablation to exclude mucosal thermal damage which could develop to an esophago-atrial fistula10.",
    "Check the completeness of the pulmonary vein isolation using a decapolar circular catheter by pacing maneuvers at maximum power (usually 10 mA/msec) from all bipoles of the spiral catheter. Make sure that the stimulus does not capture the LA by checking signals on the CS catheter. Verify that there is no LA capture in any of the pulmonary veins.\n\t\nIf necessary, detect and close “gaps” in the lesion set: move the ablation catheter around the circumferential lesions and stimulate with maximum output from the tip of the ablation catheter. If the atrium is captured, start ablation until the local capture disappears16. Use this “pace-and-ablate”-technique around all pulmonary veins.\nOnce the isolation line around the pulmonary veins is completed, perform a voltage map of the left atrium to determine a healthy atrium (shown in purple) or a fibrotic atrium (shown in blue, yellow, and grey) [see Figure 1 and 2]17. Use the cut-off values 0.5 mV for normal tissue and 0.2 mV for scar tissue17.\n\t\nUse the ablation catheter or the diagnostic catheter and start in the pulmonary vein antrum. Make sure that there is sufficient contact with the catheter tip and register the local signal amplitude to the 3D mapping system. For a normal sized LA, take points covering the entire LA body and PV antrum (100-150 points).\nPerform a test for inducibility with 20 sec burst-pacing from the coronary sinus with cycle lengths of 300 msec, 250 msec and 200 msec or to atrial refractory time. If a stable atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter is induced, map and ablate accordingly.\nIf atrial fibrillation is induced, perform an electrical cardioversion (with 200 J biphasic shock) and terminate the procedure.\nRemove the transseptal sheath and catheters.\nAntagonize heparin by injecting protaminsulfat (10,000 IU, i.v.) and remove the sheaths from the groin.",
    "3. Post-procedural Management\nPerform 10 min of manual femoral compression. After removal of the sheaths manually, compress the puncture sites on both sides. Check if there is still active bleeding after 5 min. If not, continue compression for at least an additional 5 min and place the pressure bandage for 6 hr.\nSubject the patient to 6 hr of bed rest before the patient is remobilized.\nAfter removal of the pressure bandage and checking the femoral vessels clinically (palpation and auscultation), deliver the next dose of anticoagulant drugs (warfarin or novel anticoagulants)."
