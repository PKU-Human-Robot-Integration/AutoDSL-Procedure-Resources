A few days after transformation, the colonies (containing the expression plasmid coding for the inserted cleavage site of interest) will show visible fluorescence with or even without using a DRBT.\nPrepare glycerol stock from the depicted colonies.\n\t\nWash a discrete colony into a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 5 µL of LB medium containing ampicillin (at a final concentration of 100 µg/mL).\nIncubate it at 37 °C for 8 h while continuously shaking at 220 rpm; then, harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nGently suspend the cells in 1 mL of 80% glycerol solution (diluted with distilled water) and add 500 µL of 10 mM MgCl2 solution to the suspension.",
    "Transfer the suspension to a freezing tube and store the stocks at -70 °C.\nVerify the sequence of the generated plasmid by DNA sequencing.\n\t\nAdd 10 µL of the glycerol stock (prepared in step 1.7) to 5 mL of LB medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nIncubate the suspension at 37 °C for 16 h while continuously shaking at 220 rpm; then, harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nIsolate the expression plasmid from the cell pellet by a plasmid miniprep kit (see Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and use the purified plasmid for DNA sequencing.\n\t\tNOTE: For sequencing, 5'-GATGAAGCCCTGAAAGACGCGCAG-3' (forward) and 5'-GCAAGGCGATTAAGTTGGGTAACGC-3' (reverse) oligonucleotide primers may be used.\n2. Expression of the fluorescent substrates\nPrepare the starter culture.\n\t\nAdd 10 µL of the glycerol stock (prepared in step 1.7) to 5 mL of LB medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nIncubate the suspension at 37 °C for 15 h while continuously shaking at 220 rpm.\nTransfer the bacterial culture (5 mL) to 50 mL of fresh LB medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin in a 500 mL sterile Erlenmeyer flask.\nGrow the cells at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.6-0.8 at a 600 nm wavelength, while continuously shaking at 220 rpm.\n\tNOTE: If a tetracycline treatment is to be applied at step 2.5, it is not recommended to grow the cells to an absorbance of more than 0.6 at 600 nm.\nAdd isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the 1 mM final concentration to induce protein expression.",
    "If a tetracycline treatment is NOT applied, incubate the culture for 3 h at 37 °C while continuously shaking at 220 rpm and continue the protocol with step 2.6. If a tetracycline treatment is applied, continue the protocol with steps 2.5.1-2.5.3.\n\tNOTE: Some FPs produced by E. coli cells may have a longer maturation time (see previous work)16,17; in these cases, the protein translation can be optionally arrested by the tetracycline treatment, in order to increase the fluorescent yield of the substrate solution.\n\t\nIncubate the cell suspension for 2 h at 37 °C while continuously shaking at 220 rpm; then, add a tetracycline solution (at a final concentration of 200 µg/mL).\nIncubate the cell culture according to the maturation time of the fluorescent protein of choice at 37 °C, while continuously shaking at 220 rpm.\nTransfer 2 x 25 mL of the culture to clean 50 mL centrifuge tubes and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and store the bacterial cell pellets at -70 °C for at least 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Cells containing the expressed fluorescent substrates show visible fluorescence with or even without using a DRBT.\n3. Cell disruption\nPlace the frozen cell pellet on ice and let it thaw for 15 min.\nAdd 2 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8) to the pellet and suspend the cells.\nAdd 10 µL of freshly prepared phenylmethanesulfonyl-fluoride (PMSF) protease inhibitor solution (8.7 mg/mL, dissolved in ethanol) to the suspension.\nAdd 2 mg of lysozyme and 20 units of DNase to the suspension and suspend it.\nIncubate the suspension on ice for 15 min, and vortex it occasionally.",
    "Transfer 2 x 1 mL of the suspension to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and sonicate the suspensions for 3 min, in rounds of 10 s of sonication and 5 s of resting.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 10,000 x g for 20 min at room temperature; then, remove the fluorescent supernatant (cleared bacterial cell lysate) carefully from each tube and transfer it to new microcentrifuge tubes.\n\tNOTE: Cleared lysates containing the fluorescent substrate show visible fluorescence with or even without using a DRBT and can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. Do NOT freeze it. Cleared lysates can be utilized directly for sample preparation in the protease assay (see section 4.1) or also can be used for substrate purification (see step 4.5.1).\n4. Ni-NTA magnetic-bead-based protease assay\nNOTE: Due to the flexibility of the assay platform, it can be optimized to many different types of studies. For this reason and due to the difference in the activity rate of the enzymes of choice, some of the assay parameters (where it is denoted) cannot be explicitly described but need to be optimized to the individual aims and experimental design. As a guidance, parameters of some types of studies are denoted at the particular steps.\nSample preparation\nGeneration of substrate-attached magnetic beads\nPlace a closed 2 mL low-protein-binding (see Table of Materials) microcentrifuge tube containing new or recycled (see section 4.7) Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads in a magnetic particle concentrator (MPC).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The amount of the applied bead suspension is to be set based on the experimental design. We used 1 mL of magnetic bead solution (5%, v/v) at each experiment.",

    "NOTE: For the washing procedure, see step 4.1.1.4. The cleavage buffer may be changed according to the experimental needs, but it is recommended to check the manual of the Ni-NTA magnetic beads to determine compatibility.\nPreparation of the SAMB stock solution\nAdd a cleavage buffer to the washed SAMBs to create a SAMB stock solution.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After the addition of the buffer, DO NOT shake or turn the tube upside-down. The volume of the cleavage buffer depends on the individual experimental design and must be calculated based on the number of magnetic beads (see step 4.1.1.1) and on the volumes to be used in step 4.1.4.2. For 2 mL tubes, the applied volume is up to 1,900 µL (see Table 1).

For the use of nondenaturing or denaturing conditions, follow step 5.1.3.1 or 5.1.3.2, respectively.\n\t\t\nPrepare a nondenatured sample: mix 30 µL of the sample with 6 µL of 6x nondenaturing sample-loading buffer (300 mM Tris, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8).",
    "Prepare a denatured sample: mix 30 µL of the sample with 6 µL of 6x denaturing sample-loading buffer (300 mM Tris, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 12% SDS, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), and heat the samples at 95 °C for 10 min.\nSDS-PAGE analysis\n\tNOTE: Optionally, if only nondenatured (prepared in step 5.1.3.1) samples are to be analyzed, a native PAGE can also be performed. In this case, skip section 5.3.\n\t\nPrepare an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (use 14% separating and 4% stacking gel) and fill the tank with electrophoresis buffer (2.5 mM Tris, 19.2 mM glycine, 0.01% SDS).\nAdd the samples (prepared in step 5.1.3.1 or 5.1.3.2) to the wells of a polyacrylamide gel and perform electrophoresis at 120 V voltage.\nRemove the gel cassette from the running module and place the gel into a washing tank.\n\t\tNOTE: Nondenatured samples are already visible in the gel, even by the naked eye or with a DRBT.\nIn-gel renaturation and detection of fluorescent proteins\n\tNOTE: To detect the fluorescent proteins in denatured samples (prepared in step 5.1.3.2) on the DRBT, SDS needs to be washed out from the gel, to partially renature the proteins.\n\t\nAdd ~100 mL of distilled water to the gel and rinse the gel at least for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: To improve the SDS removal, replace the water every 10 min, or rinse up to 60 min.\nVisualize the fluorescent proteins by using a DRBT, or by UV imaging.\nConventional Coomassie staining of the gel\nStain the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye to visualize nonfluorescent proteins."
