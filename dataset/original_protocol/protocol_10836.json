    "1. Manufacture of solid-state nanopores in silicon nitride membranes\nBring the FEI Tecnai F20 S/TEM to an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. If using a different S/TEM, the acceleration voltage should be greater than or equal to 200 kV 9\nLoad a 20 nm thick SPI silicon nitride window grid into the TEM sample holder and clean with Oxygen plasma for 30 seconds to remove any contaminants from the holder.\nLoad the sample into the S/TEM and allow for the vacuum to pump down. Once the S/TEM has pumped down to vacuum, find the nitride window in bright-field TEM mode by looking for a bright square on the Ronchigram. Make sure the TEM is aligned properly, then align and focus the sample.\nSwitch the S/TEM into STEM mode. Use the HAADF (or equivalent) detector to image the sample and make sure it is properly aligned.\nSet the Monochromator to a low value. A lower value of the Monochromator allows for a higher current of electrons available for drilling. If the S/TEM does not have a Monochromator, ignore this step.\nSelect an appropriate spot size for drilling the nanopore. This corresponds to the diameter of the electron probe. A 3 nm probe works well for drilling 5 nm diameter pores. A larger probe (5 nm) will drill more quickly and create a larger pore. A smaller probe (1 nm) will take longer to drill and create a smaller pore.\nAdjust the STEM alignments, if necessary.\nFocus the nitride membrane and bring it to a magnification of x1.3M. Fine focusing should be done by monitoring the Ronchigram.\nIf there is any movement of the sample, then wait for the sample to stabilize. This can take up to an hour. Blank the electron beam while waiting so as not to damage the nitride.",
    "Place the electron probe on the sample and begin drilling.\nPeriodically check the sample by scanning with the HAADF detector, both to make sure the nanopore is being drilled (it will look like a dark spot) and to check that there is no movement of the sample. If the sample drifts slightly, adjust the position of the electron probe to be over the nanopore.\nWatch the Ronchigram to identify when the pore has formed. When in focus, the nitride film has a shimmering appearance. This will disappear when the nanopore forms. Putting the Ronchigram slightly out of focus allows one to see a Fresnel fringe associated with the nanopore.\nTake an image of the nanopore with the HAADF.\nDo an intensity profile of the nanopore image. The diameter of the nanopore can be estimated by the darkest region of the profile.\nEnlargement of the nanopore may be performed by moving the electron probe along the edges of the pore.\nOnce the nanopore is of the desired diameter, put the S/TEM into TEM mode.\nBring the Monochromator to its standard setting and image the nanopore using bright-field TEM to confirm the size (Fig. 1).\n2. Wetting of the solid-state nanopore\nDe-gas de-ionized water containing 1 M KCl, 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. This can be done by putting the solutions under vacuum and placing them in a bath sonicator for 20 minutes.\nPlace the nanopore containing silicon nitride chip into a 10 ml Pyrex beaker. Take care not to break the nitride window as it is very delicate. Place the beaker on a hotplate in a fume hood and set to 100°C.",
    "Clean the nanopore chip with piranha solution using great care. First add 3 ml sulfuric acid to the container using a glass pipette. Next, carefully add 1 ml hydrogen peroxide to the sulfuric acid to make piranha solution14. Please take all precautions.\nAllow the nanopore chip to soak in piranha solution for 10 minutes.\nRemove the piranha solution from the beaker using a glass pipette. Place it into a proper storage receptacle.\nFill the beaker with the de-gassed, de-ionized water using a clean glass pipette. Empty beaker of water and repeat at least 5 times.\nRemove the nanopore chip with clean tweezers and dry it by light suction\nImmediately, seal the nanopore chip into the chamber (Fig. 2a, 2b). The chip may be secured in the chamber by O-rings or silicone sealant.\nFill the chamber with KCl solution\nConnect the Ag/AgCl electrodes to the chamber (Fig. 2b). Electrodes may be made by soaking silver wire in bleach overnight.\nApply a transmembrane potential across the electrodes and monitor the current response using an Axon 200B patch-clamp amplifier in the voltage-clamp mode.\nConstruct an I/V (current-voltage) curve from the measurements. The I/V curve should be highly linear when using 1 M KCl (Fig. 3). The conductance of the nanopore should correspond to its diameter. If the nanopore does not display a linear I/V curve, the conductance is too low, or the open current of the nanopore is not stable (Fig. 4a), it means that the nanopore is not properly wetted and piranha washing should be repeated.\n3. Monitoring protein adsorption",
    "It is critically important to perform control experiments with a single-nanopore membrane or parallel array of nanopores (see below) to monitor the current with the buffer conditions lacking the protein sample. We recommend the following two steps: (i) the use of a high purity-level buffer (purity > 99.9%; chromatography-grade level), and (ii) the use of a buffer whose interaction with the solid-state nanopore does not produce single-channel events. In addition, we recommend obtaining a high-purity protein sample using standard protein chemistry procedures. The purity of the protein sample should be checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gel analysis and high-resolution mass spectrometry 15.\nAdd a purified sample of the protein to be studied into the grounded bath of the chamber. Allow time for the sample to diffuse throughout the bath. Typical concentrations of protein that can be measured are in the tens of nM to μM range 7,15-21.\nApply a transmembrane potential voltage bias with polarity opposite to that of the total charge of the protein being studied. For example, BSA has an effective net negative charge at pH 7.4, and therefore a positive voltage bias should be applied. The applied voltage creates potential gradient within the nanopore interior and proteins of opposite charges will be driven by opposite forces. Only voltage polarities that drive the proteins into the nanopore will create measurable signals.\nAn applied potential of magnitude of 200 mV should be large enough to observe most protein analytes. Events will appear as transient current deflections from the baseline (Fig. 4b). If no signal is observed, increase the concentration of the protein in the chamber. Higher voltages improve the signal to noise ratio. Nitride nanopores can withstand several volts.\nProtein adsorptions will appear as long-lived changes in the baseline current of the nanopore (Fig. 4c).",
    "4. Possibilities for functionalization of the nanopores\nThere exist several methods for applying functional groups to silicon nitride 22,23. Most nitride films have a thin oxide layer on the outside and exposure to ozone can create an additional oxide layer, if necessary. Different organosilanes can be used and self-assembled onto such layers. Of particular interest is aminosilane, which self-assembles and can be modified further (i.e., carboxylic acid and aldehydes), allowing for the inspection of a range of organic surfaces. After a nanopore has been washed with piranha and secured in the chamber, amine can be added directly to the chamber bath with a supporting electrolyte of 0.5 M TBACl (tetrabutylammonium) and anhydrous MeOH (methanol) used as a solvent. Monolayer formation can be monitored by the application of a 400 mV voltage bias and the measurement of the current drop 23.\n5. Determination of the apparent first-order reaction rate constant and the Langmuir adsorption constant using parallel nanopore arrays\n5.1 The apparent first-order reaction rate constants for absorption and desorption",
    "We emphasize that the positive aspect of this methodology is its ability to observe individual adsorptions at the single-molecule level. The single-molecule measurements of protein adsorption onto an inorganic surface can be scaled up by employing parallel arrays of solid-state nanopores. The parallel array of nanopores is necessary because of the need to assay many pores to get reliable statistics. To this end, the use of a nanopore array would allow the monitoring of individual adsorptions as well as the measurement of multiple events for further analysis. An array of nanopores in silicon nitride may be formed by the above protocol simply by drilling multiple holes in the sample. Each nanopore should be of similar size. Arrays of nanopores of 6x6 or 7x7 should be adequate. Upon addition of protein analyte in the chamber, the current will decay in an exponential manner with a following expression:\nIt = I∞ - (I∞ - I0)exp(-k't)\nHere, It, denotes the current at an experimental time t. I0 is the original current passing through the nanopore array. I∞ indicates the current at saturation level (i.e., infinity). k' is the apparent first-order reaction rate constant, which can be determined from the fit of the experimental curve. A greater k' can be interpreted as a faster adsorption rate. The ratio I∞/I0, also called the normalized saturation current, is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1. This parameter is a measure of the occupancy by the adsorbed protein analytes. Therefore, each distinct experimental condition should be associated with two specific output parameters I∞/I0 and k'.",
    "It should be noted that the apparent first-order adsorption rate constants and normalized currents are impacted by the effective time spent by proteins within the nanopores. This time is dependent on the concentration of protein analytes in bulk aqueous phase 24. Therefore, additional correction of these numbers needs to be implemented based upon the effective time spent by the proteins within the nanopore interior. We suggest measuring the frequency of fast (translocation) events and multiplying it by the average dwell time of such events. This will give the average time of proteins spent within the nanopore interior per unit time.\nThe rate constant of desorption can be determined using a parallel array of nanopores as well. As soon as the current level reaches saturation (I∞), the voltage should be reversed, so no more proteins are trapped into the nanopores. Desorption of individual proteins will be accompanied by the alteration of the recorded current towards greater values. The rate constant will be then extracted from the rise in the current level.\n5.2 The Langmuir adsorption constant\nThe absorption of protein analytes onto the inorganic surfaces of the nanopores is dependent on the protein concentration in aqueous phase. This phenomenon has already been observed at the single-molecule level 13. If θ represents the normalized saturation current (I∞ / I0), then a typical Langmuir isotherm equation is given by the following expression:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3560/3560fig5_2.jpg",
    "where C is the protein concentration in the aqueous phase. α is the Langmuir adsorption constant. This constant increases with an increase in the binding energy of adsorption and with a decrease in temperature. The collection of the θ data points will employ measurements with parallel arrays carried out at various protein concentrations in aqueous phase. Data should be analyzed in combination with other techniques to verify the magnitude of the fitted Langmuir adsorption constant. In addition, full-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations 25,26 might be also used to help the interpretations of the obtained experimental data.\n6. Representative Results\nTypical results for solid-state nanopores will be as follows. The open pore current should be highly stable, as seen in Fig. 4a. The I/V characteristics of the nanopore should be highly linear in 1 M KCl, 10 potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, as seen in Fig. 2. The slope of a linear fit to the I/V curve will provide the unitary conductance of the nanopore. The conductance has a direct relationship to the nanopore diameter and should match the equation: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3560/3560figeqn.jpg, where G is the conductance of the nanopore, d is its diameter, l is its length, and σ is the conductivity of the solution in the chamber 14. This value should match to within 30%. If it is too small, your pore is likely not wetted. With addition of protein, rapid events should ensue, as seen in Fig. 4b. Protein adsorption is a long-lived current drop as displayed in Fig. 4c. Some proteins are highly labile and undergo structural transformation within the pore interior. In this case, the long-lived voltage drop will be accompanied by rapid fluctuations.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3560/3560fig1.jpg",
