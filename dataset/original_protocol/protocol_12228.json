    "Ethics Statement: This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of The Catholic University of Korea (KC12TISI0861).\n1. Synoviocyte Isolation and Expansion\nSynoviocyte Isolation\n\t\nSterilize two pairs of surgical scissors and one pair of forceps.\nTransfer the synovial tissue to a 100 mm dish and wash with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nCut off the yellowish fat tissue and bone residues. Transfer the trimmed tissue to a well of a 6-well plate and add 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 20% Fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nChop the tissues with the scissors until the pieces are small enough to penetrate a disposable pipette.\nTransfer the tissue-containing media to a 50 ml conical tube. Harvest the remaining material by adding 5 ml of DMEM with 20% FBS to the 6-well plate and then transfer to the tube.\nThaw collagenase on ice. Add collagenase to a final concentration of 0.01% and seal the tube with parafilm. Incubate in a water bath at 37 °C with shaking for 4 hr.\nAfter incubation, fill the tube with DMEM with 20% FBS, until the total volume is 50 ml and centrifuge at 300 x g, RT for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and add 40 ml of media to resuspend the pellet.\nRepeat steps 1.1.10-1.1.11.\nResuspend the pellet in 25 ml of DMEM with 20% FBS and wait for the large clumps of tissue to sink to the bottom.\nTransfer the supernatant to a 100 mm dish and incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 14 day.\nSynoviocyte Maintenance and Expansion\n\t\nDiscard the used media from the plate and wash the cells with 5 ml of PBS.",
    "Add 1 ml PBS/1 mM EDTA and incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 min.\nTap the dish gently and transfer the cells to a 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge the cells at 250 x g, RT for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and resuspend the pellet in 30 ml of DMEM with 20% FBS.\nTransfer the cells to 3 x 100 mm dishes, without leaving any visible leftover material.\nReplace the media with fresh media every 3 d. Split the cells at 80% confluency using 1 ml PBS/1 mM EDTA. Maintain until passage 3 before use. Divide each dish of cells into 3 dishes in every split.\n\t\tNOTE: After reaching passage 3, cells that are not going to be used immediately can be frozen.\n2. Reprogramming FLSs Using Lentiviruses-encoding Yamanaka Factors\nTransduction (D0)\n\t\nSeed 3 × 104 cells per well of a 6-well plate in growth media (500 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Incubate the cells O/N at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nThe following day, remove one vial of lentivirus containing 4 Yamanaka factors: Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc from the freezer and thaw at 4 °C. Note: Lentivirus was produced by the procedure described in our previous study11.\nWhile thawing the virus, change the media to FLS growth media (20% FBS plus antibiotics in DMEM) containing 10 µg/ml hexadimethrine bromide and 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid.\nAfter changing the media, add 30 µl of lentivirus to the cells and mix gently. To improve infection, centrifuge the plate at 680 x g, 35 °C for 30 min.\nAfter centrifugation, incubate the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nMaintenance Until Reprogramming is Visible",
    "For 3 day, replace the media daily with FLS growth media containing 0.1 mM sodium butyrate and 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid.\nThe next day, replace the media with a mixture of FLS growth media and iPSC media (1:1 ratio) containing 0.1 mM sodium butyrate and 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid.\n\t\tNote: The components of the iPSC media is given in the materials/equipment list.\nSplitting Cells for Colony Formation\n\t\nPrepare a vitronectin-coated 6-well plate.\n\t\t\nAdd 60 µl vitronectin to 6 ml PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Put 2 ml of mixture into each wells and incubate in RT for at least 1 hr. Note: The working concentration of vitronectin is 5 µg/mL.\nOn D5, wash the cells with PBS.\nAdd 1 ml PBS/1 mM EDTA to detach the cells and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 min.\nHarvest the cells and centrifuge at 250 x g, RT for 2 min.\nSplit the cells at 3 different ratios (1:3, 1:6, and 1:9) to achieve different confluencies. Add 900 µl of media to the cell pellet and resuspend. Add 300, 150, and 100 µl of the cell mixture per well of a 6-well plate to achieve a ratio of 1:3, 1:6, and 1:9, respectively.\nReplace the media daily with iPSC media until colonies appear. Colonies will appear after about D18. Note: At this stage, iPSC colonies co-exist with the non-reprogrammed FLSs.\nColony picking\n\t\nPrepare a 48-well vitronectin-coated plate by adding 500 µl vitronectin to the wells, and incubate at RT for at least 1 hr.\nPlace the microscope on a clean bench, and remove the 6-well plate from the incubator.\nRemove the vitronectin solution from the 48-well plate and add 500 µl iPSC media supplemented with 10mM Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor.",
    "Using a 10p pipette tip, cut around the colony. Transfer the picked colony to one well of the 48-well plate.\nAfter picking several colonies, incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nMaintain the cells until the colonies are big enough for transfer. Note: We usually spilt the cells when the colony gets out of the visible field of the microscope, when viewed at 100X magnification.\n3. Immunofluorescence Staining\nCell Preparation\n\t\nPlace a sterile 18 mm cover glass into a 12-well plate.\nAdd 1 ml of PBS to cool and rinse the cover glass.\nReplace with 1 ml of a 10 µg/ml vitronectin solution.\nIncubate the plate at RT for at least 1 hr.\nDiscard the vitronectin solution and plate iPSCs in the vitronectin-coated 12-well plate and culture for 7 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2, changing the media daily.\nCell Staining\n\t\nDiscard the culture media and wash the cells with PBS once.\nFix the cells in 0.4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at RT.\nPermeabilize the cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the permeabilization solution and block with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at RT.\nDilute the antibodies in PBS containing 2% BSA according to Table 1. Incubate the cells with the primary antibodies for 2 hr at RT.\nAdd the secondary antibody (diluted 1:200) and incubate the cells for 1 hr at RT, avoiding light.\nTreat the cells with 1 µl/mL DAPI for 10 min.\nPlace the cover glass on top of the slide glass with antifade reagent and incubate at RT for 24 hr, avoiding light.\nVerify expression with a fluorescence microscope.\n4. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)\nExtract mRNA from the cell pellet using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method11.",
    "Amplify cDNA from 2 µg of total mRNA using reverse transcription11.\nMix the components required for PCR using 2 µl of cDNA template11.\nPerform RT-PCR and verify the results by gel electrophoresis11.\n5. Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) Staining\nCulture iPSCs for 5-7 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2 prior to staining.\nAspirate the media and fix the cells with 4% PFA for 1 min.\nDiscard the fixative and rinse the cells with 1X rinse buffer.\nPrepare the reagents for AP staining. Mix the reagents in the following ratio: Fast Red Violet : Naphthol AS-BI phosphate solution : water = 2:1:1.\nIncubate the cells with the staining solution at RT for 15 min, avoiding light.\nDiscard the staining solution and rinse the cells with rinse buffer.\nCover the cells with PBS to prevent drying and verify expression using a bright-field microscope.\nSubscription Required.
