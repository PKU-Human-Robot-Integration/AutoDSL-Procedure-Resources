    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolate macrophages and cancer cells from mouse primary mammary carcinomas – Day 1\nTiming: 6–7 h\nMMTV-PyMT is well established breast cancer mouse model9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] and the immune profile of these tumors has been identified and compared with other breast cancer models.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] The primary tumors of MMTV-PyMT mice (on C57BL/6 background) are mechanically dissociated and digested with the collagenase/hyaluronidase solution containing DNase I at 37°C for 45 min. After pulse centrifugation (450 × g), the supernatant (immune cells and single cancer cells) and cell pellet (cancer cell aggregates) are separated and collected. CD11b MicroBeads are used to enrich CD11b+ cells from the supernatant, and macrophages are obtained by allowing the CD11b+ cells to adhere to fibronectin-coated glass bottom plate for 1 h (non-adherent cells are removed by washing with PBS after 1 h). Cancer cells are isolated from the tumor cell pellets by dissociating the cell aggregates into single cancer cells with TrypLE Express Enzyme containing DNase I at 37°C for 10 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: The tumor can be any size (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). Choose the size of the tumor according to your purpose, such as an early-stage tumor (tumor size <5 mm) or an advanced-stage tumor (tumor size >12 mm). This protocol uses 1.0 g tumor (two tumors, ∼10 mm in diameter, each tumor weighing ∼0.5 g) per 10 mL dissociation buffer in a 50 mL tube and per 5 mL TrypLE Express Enzyme in a 15 mL tube. If more tumors are needed, scale up all reagent volumes and tube numbers (e.g., for 2.0 g tumors, use two 50 mL tubes with 10 mL of dissociation buffer in each tube, and two 15 mL tubes with 5 mL of TrypLE Express Enzyme in each tube).",
    "Note: Pulse centrifugation is used to separate single cells (including immune cells, cancer cells and other cell types) from cell aggregates by difference in masses/sedimentation rates. Centrifugation (with acceleration/deceleration set at 9/9) is set to 450 × g and stopped immediately (in 5 s) when the speed reaches 450 × g. The longer the centrifugation time at 450 × g, the more single cells will move from the supernatant to the pellet with cell aggregates, and the yield of macrophages isolated from the supernatant may therefore decrease. The yield of macrophages from the supernatant after pulse centrifugation and from the whole tumor (centrifugation at 450 × g for 10 min to collect all the cells) are approximately the same. We can obtain more than enough cancer cells from the cell aggregates in the pellet. With pulse centrifugation, we can simultaneously isolate immune and cancer cells from the same tumors, isolating a large amount of immune cells from the supernatant and more than sufficient cancer cells from pellet.\nHarvest the primary tumors. Before harvesting the tumors, thaw 10× collagenase/hyaluronidase (stored at −20°C) and warm up 1% BSA solution to 20°C–25°C in a tissue culture room.\nPut one 10 cm Petri dish with cold PBS on ice. Place surgery tools (tweezers and scissors) on the surgery table and turn on the dry glass bead sterilizer.\nDisinfect the open bench for the tumor harvest.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nWipe down the dissection station with 70% ethanol.\nClean all surgical supplies, a dissection board (a Styrofoam board covered with a sterile, new blue pad), and pins with 70% ethanol.\nDisinfect the surgery tools by heat in the glass bead sterilizer at 280°C for 1 min. Cool the tools on the blue pad.\nEuthanize the mouse in a CO2-saturated chamber, followed by cervical dislocation.",
    "With the carcass on its back, pin it to the dissection board. Then spray with 70% ethanol until the fur is soaking wet.\nPinch a small piece of the skin with a tweezer, and make a small incision on the abdominal skin with sharp scissors, then extend the cut along the ventral midline up to the neck. Be careful to cut only the skin and not the peritoneum underneath.\nExtend the cuts laterally towards the forelimbs and hind limbs. Use the tweezer and a cotton swab to release the skin from the peritoneum. Pull the skin away and stretch it tight before pinning it down (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCollect and pool the primary tumors in the Petri dish.\nCritical: To obtain an optimal tumor-associated macrophage purity and yield, avoid collecting the lymph nodes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and necrotic tumors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) and remove the fat and vessels around the tumor (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G). This is done because macrophages from lymph nodes may contaminate TAMs; necrotic tumors contain a high percentage of neutrophils; vessels with excess amount of erythrocytes demand increased ACK lysis time in step 4c, which in turn cause damage to the cells.\nBring the dissected tumors to a tissue culture hood.\nDigest the tumors with dissociation buffer.\nNote: For this step, the pipettes should be pre-coated with 1% BSA to increase cellular yield, as tumor tissues easily stick to the un-coated pipette and are hard to be removed. To coat the inner surface of the pipettes, pipette BSA solution up and down once before use. A short coating with BSA is sufficient.\nPrepare the dissociation buffer (refer to “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”) and turn on the 37°C shaker. You will need 10 mL of buffer in a 50 mL tube for 1.0 g tumor.",
    "Critical: Collagenase/hyaluronidase 10× solution should be freshly diluted with RPMI 1640+5% FBS to a 1× solution, and DNase I (final concentration 4 U/mL) is added to the 1× solution. DNase I will digest the viscous genomic DNA leaking out from the dead cells during digestion and will thus make the solution clearer and less sticky and increase the cellular yield.\nRinse the tumors with PBS and transfer them to a new 10 cm Petri dish. Add 1 mL of dissociation buffer to the tumors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2139-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Repeat pulse centrifugation until the supernatant is clear (right), and then collect the pellet for cancer cell isolation.\nCritical: Do not mince the tumors without the buffer.\nCut the tumors into small pieces with a razor blade, and mince them until they are paste-like (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Cut one tumor into 2–4 pieces, and let the cross section touch the dish to prevent the tumor from sliding around.\nCritical: Do not use scissors which may damage the cells by squeezing the tumor.",
    "Transfer the minced tissue into the 50 mL tube with a BSA-coated 10 mL pipette (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). Place the tube horizontally in a 37°C shaker to ensure even mixing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). Shake for 45 min at a speed of 20 cycles/min.\nNote: A longer incubation time will not increase the yield of macrophages and will digest the cell surface antigens.\nNote: While waiting for digestion, warm up the wash buffer (refer to “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”) and the TrypLE Express Enzyme to 20°C–25°C.\nAfter digestion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F), pipette the cell suspension up and down about 30 times using a BSA-coated 5 mL pipette. Add 10 mL of wash buffer to each 50 mL tube.\nNote: It is very important to resuspend the cells completely, as erythrocytes tend to attach to myeloid cells.\nSpin down cells at 450 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G). Resuspend the pellet with 10 mL of wash buffer. Transfer the suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nPulse to 450 × g. Stop immediately when the speed reaches 450 × g. Collect the supernatant for macrophage isolation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of wash buffer.\nRepeat wash/pulse spins (steps 2h and 2i) 3–5 times until the supernatant is clear (not red/pink, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H). Pool all the non-clear supernatants in one 50 mL tube for macrophage isolation (step 4 below). When the supernatant is clear, use the pellet for tumor cell isolation.\nNote: The supernatant contains immune cells and single cancer cells. The pellet contains cancer cell aggregates.\nNote: Place the 50 mL tube with the pooled, non-clear supernatants on ice.\nIsolate cancer cells from the pellet.",
    "Wash the pellet with 10 mL of PBS to remove residual FBS from the wash buffer (steps 2i and 2j). Spin down cells at 450 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Residual FBS inhibits TrypLE Express Enzyme activity.\nResuspend the pellet in 5 mL of TrypLE Express Enzyme, and add 2 μL DNase I (final concentration 4 U/mL).\nPlace the 15 mL tube horizontally in the 37°C shaker (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Incubate the tube for 10 min with constant low agitation (20 cycles/min).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2139-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Spin down the cells at 450 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Wash the pellet with 10 mL of wash buffer. Spin down cells at 450 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Do not touch the pellet when removing the supernatant, as the loose pellet is easily removed together with the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in wash buffer and transfer to a 50 mL falcon tube. Adjust the volume to 20–30 mL with additional wash buffer.",
    "Filter the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer to a new 50 mL tube.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer to a new 50 mL tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCount the cells. Usually, we can obtain 4.5 ± 0.9 × 107 viable cancer cells (∼90% viability, based on n=12 isolations) from 1.0 g tumor, and the purity of EpCAM+ cells is >90% (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nOptional: Take 1–2 × 106 cells and stain with APC anti-mouse CD326 (EpCAM) antibody for purity analysis by flow cytometry.\nNote: Tumors of different sizes have different numbers of cancer cells. This predicted cancer cell number is from two ∼10 mm MMTV-PyMT tumors (C57BL/6 background).\nSpin down 5 × 106 cancer cells at 450 × g for 5 min and plate them onto one 10 cm tissue culture dish.\nAdd 12 mL of cancer cell culture medium, and culture the cells for 12–16 h in the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F). The morphology of the cancer cells is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G.\nNote: After TrypLE digestion, it is no longer necessary to coat the pipettes with BSA solution.\nIsolate CD11b+ cells from the supernatant.\nNote: Some macrophages have low F4/80 expression, therefore we do not use F4/80 magnetic separation, but rather, the CD11b separation and adherence method. In the mouse, the CD11b antigen is expressed on monocytes/macrophages, and to a lower extent, on granulocytes, NK cells and a subset of dendritic cells.\nSample preparation:\nPlace ACK lysis buffer and MACS buffer (refer to “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”) on ice.\nSpin down the collected, pooled supernatant at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Critical: Do not centrifuge higher than 300 × g when working with immune cells, or the viability of immune cells will be decreased. Keep the cells cold.\nDiscard the supernatant (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Resuspend the cell pellet in 5–10 mL of cold ACK lysis buffer to lyse erythrocytes. Keep on ice for 5–10 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2139-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

If lysis is incomplete, as evidenced by pink or red color of the pellet, repeat steps 4c and 4d.",
    "Note: Usually we do not need to repeat ACK lysis when we follow the step 1g carefully.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 20–30 mL of MACS buffer.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer to a new 50 mL tube.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 30 μm pre-separation filter to a new 50 mL tube (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCritical: For optimal performance, it is important to obtain a single cell suspension before magnetic separation. Pass cells through a 30 μm pre-separation filter to remove cell clumps that may clog the column.\nNote: To increase the speed of pre-separation filtering, use a 40 μm cell strainer first to remove larger clumps.\nDetermine the cell number. Usually, we can obtain 4.8 ± 1.0 × 107 viable pre-CD11b cells (∼88% viability, based on n=15 isolations) from 1.0 g tumor.\nOptional: Take 1–2 × 106 cells and stain with BV785™ anti-mouse CD45 antibody and APC anti-mouse/human CD11b antibody for flow cytometry (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: Tumors of different sizes have different percentages of immune cells and different numbers of pre-CD11b cells. This predicted pre-CD11b cell number is from two ∼10 mm tumors.\nMagnetic labeling (positive selection of CD11b+ cells, following the manufacturer’s instructions https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001265.PDF[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001265.PDF]):\nCritical: For the following magnetic labeling steps, work fast, keep the cells cold, and use pre-cooled solutions. This approach will reduce the unspecific binding of antibodies on the cell surface.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Pipette off the supernatant completely.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 90 μL of MACS buffer per 107 total cells.\nNote: When working with higher cell numbers, scale up all reagent volumes and total volumes accordingly (e.g., for 2 × 107 total cells, use twice the volume of all indicated reagent volumes and total volumes).",
    "Add 10 μL of CD11b MicroBeads per 107 total cells.\nCritical: Vortex the MicroBeads thoroughly before use (e.g., pulse vortex multiple times).\nMix well (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E) and incubate for 15 min at 4–8°C (in a refrigerator).\nNote: Working on ice may require increased incubation times. Higher temperatures and/or longer incubation times lead to non-specific cell labeling.\nWash cells by adding 1–2 mL of buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Pipette off the supernatant completely.\nResuspend up to 108 cells in 500 μL of MACS buffer.\nNote: For higher cell numbers, scale up the buffer volume accordingly.\nMagnetic separation:\nCritical: The maximum number of loaded cells for each LS column is 108. If you load more than 108 cells, use more LS columns, or the column will be clogged and unlabeled cells may not be washed away.\nPlace the LS column in the magnetic field of the MACS separator (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nRinse the LS column with 3 mL of MACS buffer.\nNote: Steps 4p and 4q can be done during centrifugation in step 4n.\nLoad the cell suspension onto the column.\nWash the column three times with MACS buffer (3 × 3 mL, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nCritical: Add buffer each time the column reservoir is empty.\nNote: Unlabeled cells will pass through to the 15 mL tube.\nRemove the column from the separator and place it partially in a new 15 mL collection tube.\nPipette 5 mL of MACS buffer onto the column. Immediately flush out the fraction with the magnetically labeled cells by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).",
    "Count the cells. Usually, we can obtain 6.7 ± 1.7 × 106 viable CD11b+ cells (>90% viability, based on n=12 isolations) from 1.0 g tumor (two ∼10 mm tumors), and the purity of CD11b+ cells is >90% (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nOptional: Take 1–2 × 106 cells and stain with BV785™ anti-mouse CD45 antibody and APC anti-mouse/human CD11b antibody for flow cytometry to determine purity.\nSeparate the macrophages from CD11b+ cells using the adherence method.\nNote: Pre-coat a 24-well glass bottom plate with fibronectin during centrifugation in step 4j. Dilute the fibronectin with PBS to 10 μg/mL. Add 300 μL of diluted fibronectin to each well. Incubate for 45 min–1 h at 37°C. The plate can also be pre-coated for 12–16 h at 4°C. Fibronectin coated plates can be stored for 2–4 weeks at 4°C in a closed sterile container or sterile sealable bags.\nNote: Vortexing or excessive agitation of fibronectin solutions should be avoided.\nNote: Warm up the macrophage culture medium to 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: Add fresh 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration: 55 μM) and M-CSF (final concentration: 10 ng/mL) to the macrophage culture medium (refer to “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”). 2-mercaptoethanol is a reducing agent to prevent toxic levels of oxygen radicals. M-CSF plays an important role in enhancing the effector functions of macrophages.\nCentrifuge the CD11b+ cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Pipette off the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of macrophage culture medium per 6 × 105 cells.\nCarefully aspirate the remaining fibronectin solution from the plate.\nCritical: Work fast and do not let the wells completely dry before moving to next step, as over-drying affects the attachment of cells.\nRinse the plate once with PBS.\nCritical: Work fast and do not let the wells completely dry before moving to next step.",
    "Culture CD11b+ cells in the incubator (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I) at 37°C with 5% CO2 (6 × 105 CD11b+ cells per well).\nAfter 1 h of attachment,13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] remove the unattached cells (granulocytes, NK cells and dendritic cells) by pipetting out the supernatant (medium) of the wells.\nWash the attached cells 3 times with PBS to remove any remaining leukocytes.\nNote: Depending on the percentage of macrophages out of the CD11b+ cells (∼40% for MMTV-PyMT tumors) and the loss of cells in these steps, we can obtain ∼1.5 × 105 macrophages from 6 × 105 CD11b+ cells per well. The purity of macrophages is >90% (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J).\nOptional: Detach the adherent cells with Trysin+0.5 M EDTA at 37°C until the cells become round (∼10 min) and scrape the round cells (macrophages) gently with a cell lifter. Take 1–2 × 106 cells and stain with BV785™ anti-mouse CD45 antibody and Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-mouse F4/80 antibody for flow cytometry.\nCulture the macrophages for 12–16 h in the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.

    "Note: To test the effects of macrophage activating drugs, add e.g., MPLA or IFNγ alone or in combination to the 1 mL of macrophage medium so that the final concentration (in 2 mL) is 100 ng/mL of MPLA and/or 33 ng/mL of IFNγ. Mixing at this step is not necessary.\nLive cell imaging – Day 2\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThe tumoricidal activity of macrophages is monitored by time-lapse imaging. The 24-well glass bottom plate, with the macrophage and cancer cell co-cultures, is placed on the stage of the spinning disk confocal microscope and incubated within the LiveCellTM Stage Top Incubation System. Turn on the 488 nm laser (for CMFDA Dye) and the 647 nm laser (for Deep Red Dye), and pick 5 fields of view for each condition. When the incubation system is ready (37°C, 5% CO2, 75%–85% relative humidity), start imaging: take images every 20 min for 60 h in total. Images can be analyzed using Imaris and ImageJ software.\nSet up the LiveCellTM Stage Top Incubation System.\nNote: Place the co-cultured 24-well plate in the stage and turn on the LiveCellTM Incubation System. Wait until the system is stabilized (∼2 h, 37°C, 5% CO2, 75%–85% relative humidity).\nCritical: Use other detectors, such as a thermometer to measure the temperature and make sure that the temperature is not higher than 38°C or the cells will die.\nCritical: Check CO2 tank and make sure that there is sufficient CO2 for 3 days imaging.\nOperate the Yokogawa spinning disk confocal microscope.\nNote: While waiting for the incubation system to stabilize in step 9, pick 5 fields of view (top, middle, bottom, left, and right) for each well.\nPerform time-lapse imaging.\nWhen the incubation system is ready, go through all the fields and refocus them.",
    "Start imaging: take images every 20 min for 60 h, yielding 180 images in total.\nNote: We recommend to refocus every 12 h.\nAnalyze the images using Imaris and ImageJ software.\nNote: Export videos using Imaris software.\nNote: Analyze images at specific time points with ImageJ software."
