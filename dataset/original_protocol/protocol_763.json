  "procedures": [
    "1. Harvest cell culture medium from 80% confluent cells grown in serum-free medium.\n  2. Optional: Spin media at 500-1,000 x g for 10 min.\n  3. Pre-clear medium by centrifuging at 2000 x g for 10 min then filter using a 0.22 µm PES Steriflip membrane and freeze at -80°C until needed.\n  4. Thaw 4 mL of cell culture supernatant on ice.\n  5. Transfer 4 mL of cell culture supernatant to a 15 mL tube and add 4 mL of XBP buffer.\n  6. Mix by inverting 5 times.\n  7. Add the sample/XBP mix to the exoEasy maxi spin column.\n  8. Centrifuge for 1 – 3 min at 500 x g at room temperature and discard flow-through.\n  9. Add 10 mL of XWP to the spin column and centrifuge for 5 min at 5,000 x g<sup>1</sup> at room temperature.\n  10. Transfer the spin column to a fresh collection tube.\n  11. Add 700 µL of Qiazol to the spin column and centrifuge for 5 min at 5,000 x g.<sup>1</sup>\n  12. Spin PLG tubes for 30 s at 16,000 x g.\n  13. Add flow-through from spin column in step 11 to PLG tube, and vortex for 5 s.<sup>2</sup>\n  14. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\n  15. Add 90 µL of chloroform, then shake \\(do not vortex) vigorously for 15 s.\n  16. Incubate for 2 – 3 min at room temperature.\n  17. Centrifuge samples for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4°C and transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new microcentrifuge tube.\n  18. Measure the aqueous phase and add 2 volumes 100% ethanol.\n  19. Mix gently and thoroughly by pipetting up and down.\n  20. Immediately add up to 700 µL of the mix from step 19, including any precipitate, onto the MinElute spin column.",
    "21. Centrifuge for 15 s at 1,000 x g at room temperature and discard the flow-through.<sup>3</sup>\n  22. Repeat steps 20-21 until all the sample has been added.\n  23. Make sure ethanol has been added to the RWT and RPE buffers as recommended by the manufacturer.\n  24. Add 700 µL of Buffer RWT to the spin column and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8,000 x g at room temperature to wash the column and discard the flow-through.<sup>4</sup>\n  25. Add 500 µL of Buffer RPE onto the column and centrifuge for 15 s at ≥8,000 x g at room temperature and discard the flow-through.\n  26. Add 500 µL of Buffer RPE onto the column and centrifuge for 2 min at ≥8,000 x g at room temperature and discard the flow-through.\n  27. Transfer the spin column to a new 2 mL collection tube.\n  28. Open the lid of the column and centrifuge at full speed for 5 min to dry the membrane.<sup>5</sup>\n  29. Discard the collection tube and flow-through.\n  30. Transfer the spin column to a new 1.5 mL collection tube, add 14 µL or 30 µL of RNase-free water directly to the center of the spin column.<sup>6</sup>\n  31. Centrifuge for 1 min at 100 x g.<sup>7</sup>\n  32. Centrifuge for 1 min at full speed to elute RNA."
