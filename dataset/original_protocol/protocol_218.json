    "**A. Sperm sample washing and slide preparation**\n**Before starting**\n1. Prepare fresh Carnoy’s fixative and put in the freezer \\(at -18ºC to -20ºC) for at least 2-3 hours. Keep the fixative in the freezer throughout the handling of the sample.\n  \n**Procedure:**\n1. Centrifuge native sperm sample of \\(ideally) 200 × 10<sup>6</sup> spermatozoa at 400 g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\n  2. Add 8 mL of Carnoy’s fixative, re-suspend the pellet by vortex and then centrifuge at 400 g for 10 minutes. If there is a smaller number of cells \\(50 to 100 × 10<sup>6</sup>) then use only 4 mL of Carnoy’s fixative.\n  3. Remove supernatant, suspend again in fixative and centrifuge. Repeat these washing steps 3-4 times \\(or more).\n  4. Keep sperm in fixative in the freezer \\(at -18ºC to -20ºC) until used for slides. Prepare slides on the day the FISH is being done.\n  5. Prepare the slides – make sure they are clean and properly marked on the frosted end.\n  6. Vortex the sample before use.\n  7. With a disposable plastic pipette drop \\(from about 10 cm above the slide) one drop of suspended semen on each slide and air-dry them horizontally.\n  8. Mark the area of the drop on the backside of the slide with diamond pen.\n  \n**B. Slide treatment \\(bloating, aging, denaturation, hybridization)**\n**Before starting**\n1. Thaw one 2-mL Eppendorf of 0.1 M Tris solution and one 20-µL tube of DTT solution for every 4-5 slides.\n  2. Thaw 100 µL of 70% formamid solution for each slide.\n  3. Put about 120 mL of 2× SSC solution in a Coplin jar at room temperature.\n  4. Put about 120 mL of distilled water inside a Coplin jar in the refrigerator at 4ºC.",
    "5. Thaw hybridisation mix. For each slide mix about 4 μL of hybridisation mix with 0.5 µL of each of the X and Y chromosome-specific probes. Make sure to vortex the probes before taking the needed volume. Keep in ice in the dark or in the freezer \\(at -18ºC to -20ºC) until just before use. Vortex before use.\n  \n**Procedure:**\n1. Mix well the DTT with the 0.1 M Tris solution \\(one Eppendorf of each), resulting in 10 mM DTT solution. Make sure to take all the DTT by washing the DTT tube several times with 0.1 M Tris solution taken from the other tube.\n  2. Put 0.4 to 0.5 mL of the 10 mM DTT solution on each slide, spread it evenly, cover with parafilm and leave at room temperature for 15 min.\n  3. Remove parafilm, discard access of liquid and then wash for 2 min in 2× SSC solution at room temperature.\n  4. Air dry the slides.\n  5. Put 100 µL of 70% formamid solution on each slide, cover with large \\(24 × 50 mm) cover slip while making sure the liquid spreads all over the slide \\(with no air bubbles).\n  6. Pre-heat the ThermoBrite to 80ºC, load the slides and incubate for 10 min. If do not fill all slots on the ThermoBrite with samples then put empty slides in the empty slots.\n  7. Remove the slides from the ThermoBrite, remove the cover slips, discard of excess liquids and then wash in the cold distilled water for two minutes.\n  8. Air dry the slides.\n  9. Dehydrate the slides in the ethanol solutions - 1 min in each concentration going from 70% to 90% to 100% and then air-dry the slides.\n   Make sure the slides are absolutely dry before going to next step\\!\\!",
    "10. Put on each 20 × 20 mm cover slip, at its center, 5 μL of probes with hybridization mix. Put the slide over the cover slip \\(face down) so the marked area aligns with the cover slip and let it stand for about one minute to let the hybridization and probes mix spread evenly. Make sure the entire area is covered and that no air bubbles are left. If needed, apply light pressure to spread the mix all the way to the edges of the cover slip.\n  11. Seal around with rubber cement.\n  12. Put in the ThermoBrite with some distilled water for humidity and run the following program: 10 minutes at 65ºC for denaturation and then at 37ºC over night for hybridization.\n  \n**C. Washing and counter staining**\n**Before starting**\n1. Heat water bath to 75ºC and put 120 mL of 0.4× SSC solution in a Coplin jar in it for at least two hours.\n  2. Put 120 mL of 2× SSC / 0.1% NP-40 solution in a Coplin jar at room temperature.\n  \n**Procedure:**\n1. Remove rubber cement and cover slip.\n  2. Put for 1 minute in 0.4 SSC at 75ºC.\n  3. Drip excess solution and then put for 1 min in 2× SSC / 0.1% NP-40 at room temperature.\n  4. Air dry the slides in the dark.\n  5. Put a drop of DAPI with antifade \\(about 22 µL per slide) and cover with a 24 × 32 mm cover slip.\n  6. If intended for prolonged storage, seal around the edges of the cover slip with nail polish and then air dry it. Slides should be stored in the freezer \\(at -18ºC to -20ºC).",
    "7. View under fluorescence microscope at ×100 magnification with oil. The microscope should have a three-way filter – One for DAPI \\(blue), one for Cy3 \\(red) and one for FITC \\(green).\n  8. IF successful, all cells will be stained blue, X-chromosome bearing spermatozoa should have red/pink spot on them and Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa should have a green/yellow spot on them."
