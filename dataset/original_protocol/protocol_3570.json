Users may refer to the eMouseAtlas (https://www.emouseatlas.org[href=https://www.emouseatlas.org]) for assistance.\nExcise hearts from embryos, remove the outflow tract (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and pericardium (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), and transfer directly into pre-cooled C-tubes containing cold PBS. Hearts from embryos with R26tdTom;Wt1CreERT2/+ genotype may be separated from Cre- littermates by inspecting hearts under the red fluorescence channel.",
    "Critical: If lineage tracing is desired, ensure reporter-labeled hearts are separated from unlabeled hearts. Regardless of whether unlabeled hearts are used in downstream staining, ensure some are taken and dissociated for single-color compensation (where cells are stained for just one of the markers, repeat for each color) and fluorescence minus one (FMO) (where one of the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies/RNA probes used in the staining combination is left out, repeat for each color). This study describes a multiparameter staining protocol, and it is standard practice to prepare FMO controls to accurately determine gating of positively stained populations. Users may refer to Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] for further details on the importance and preparation of FMO controls.\nNote: C-tubes containing hearts are kept on ice (+4°C) throughout harvest. If multiple litters are to be harvested and users anticipate hearts needing to be on ice for longer than 20 min, we recommend C-tubes contain PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. Time on ice should not exceed 1 h but instead stagger litter harvests to ensure hearts are processed as quickly as possible.\nNote: If mice carry other mutant alleles relevant to the experiment, take embryonic tail samples for genotyping.\nNote: During harvest remove Neonatal Heart Dissociation Kit enzymes to thaw on ice.\nProcessing embryonic hearts: day 1\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nEnzymatic dissociation of embryonic hearts and preparation of single-cell suspensions.\nEmbryonic heart digestion\nPrepare enzyme mix as per manufacturer’s instructions (Neonatal Heart Dissociation Kit protocol). 2.5 mL enzyme mix is required per digestion.\nNote: Keep embryonic hearts intact (atria + ventricles) and refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for estimated number of cells per heart at each embryonic stage. Pooling of tissue is required for E11.5 and E13.5, and should be carried out before digestion, assuming identical embryonic genotypes can be ensured.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_492_1.csv",
    "As per manufacturer’s instructions, remove supernatant (PBS) carefully from C-tubes containing embryonic hearts using a fine tip plastic Pasteur pipette.\nAdd 2.5 mL of enzyme mix to each C-tube, invert tubes ensuring all hearts are submerged in solution and attach onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nRun program 37C_mr_NHDK_1. The duration of this program is 60 min.\nNote: If in possession of the gentleMACS dissociator (without heaters), follow the manufacturer’s alternative instructions. Enzymatic reactions may also take place on heated racks/incubator at 37°C, with gentle mechanical agitation using a (regular tip) plastic Pasteur pipette for 30 s; agitate every 15 min, for a total of 2 agitations during the 45 min digestion.\nAfter the dissociator program is complete, detach C-tubes and add 7.5 mL of cold culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) to terminate enzymatic reaction.\nCentrifuge C-tubes briefly at 100 × g for 1 min to collect solution from C-tube caps, and maximize sample transfer.\nResuspend sample with a plastic Pasteur pipette and immediately transfer to a 50 mL tube fitted with a 70 μm strainer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nWash C-tubes and strainers with 3 mL of cold cell culture medium to maximize sample transfer. Use the thumb press end of a 2 mL syringe plunger rod as a pestle to push any remaining tissue clumps through the strainer. Use a pipette to collect everything from the underside of the strainer before discarding.\nDiscard strainers and centrifuge cell suspension at 600 × g for 5 min at +10°C.\nRemove supernatant completely and resuspend cell pellet in 500 μL of cold PEB buffer.",
    "Transfer the 500 μL cell suspension to 15 mL tubes. Wash 50 mL tubes with another 500 μL of cold PEB and transfer to corresponding tube to maximize sample transfer. Each cell suspension will make up a total volume of 1 mL. Immediately proceed to the next step.\nRed blood cell lysis (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G)\nPrepare 1× red blood cell lysis solution (Miltenyi Biotec) with ultrapure DNase/RNase-free distilled water.\nAdd 10 mL of 1× red blood cell lysis solution to each sample.\nIncubate for 2 min at 20°C–24°C.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at +10°C. In the meantime, prepare Enzyme A solution in PBS.\nRemove supernatant and gently resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL Enzyme A solution, by resuspending twice with a pipette. After all samples are resuspended, make up to 10 mL volume by adding 9 mL Enzyme A solution to each sample.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at +10°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 500 μL cold cell staining buffer (BioLegend). Keep samples on ice (+2°C to +4°C).\nTake a sample of cells to perform manual cell counts using a hemocytometer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H; advised ratio of cell suspension to 0.4% trypan blue solution, 1:1). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nNote: Automated cell counters may be used if users are confident that dead cells, debris, and any remaining erythrocytes are excluded from the final count. Users must ensure automated counters count all viable cells that vary in size and shape, for example more mature cardiomyocytes will display reduced circularity and may be falsely identified as debris. Optimize counter settings to match manual counts before adopting for regular use. Normally, this protocol results in >94% viable cells.",
    "Note: Users will need to set a maximum number of cells to stain to match cell numbers between samples. We advise setting a cell number maximum, to allow for control during staining and data acquisition. For example, if the total cell number in sample A = 260,000, sample B = 400,000 and sample C = 300,000, one can set a maximum of 100,000 cells per target probe panel. Thus, the sum of excess cells from sample A, B, and C (=360,000) can be removed and allocated to controls, i.e., FMOs and compensation. This example is suitable for 2 staining panels. Late embryonic stages will yield more cells, thus the user may raise the maximum number of cells per target probe panel.\nCritical: No fewer than 100,000 cells should be allocated per target probe panel for each experimental/biological sample.\nStaining cells: day 1\nTiming: 3.5 h\nStaining cells for viability, and antibody staining of cell surface and intracellular antigens.\nFixable viability dye staining\nAdd 10 mL PBS to each sample, invert to mix, and centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at +4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 300 μL diluted Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Dye solution (1:1,000 in PBS).\nTransfer samples to 1.5 mL tubes and incubate for 30 min at 20°C–24°C, protected from light.\nAdd 1 mL of cold cell staining buffer, centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at +4°C, and discard supernatant. Proceed to cell surface antibody staining procedure.",
    "Critical: Before staining for viability take some cells from your allocated control samples to generate compensation controls for the live/dead dye and fluorescent reporter protein (e.g., tdTomato). Users may take cells from several embryonic stages to create unstained, Aqua dye, and tdTomato single-color compensation controls. Ensure unstained and Aqua dye controls are taken from reporter negative samples. Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] summarizes the advised minimum number of cells required for each control.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_492_2.csv\nNote: To generate the Aqua positive single-color compensation control, add 200 μL 70% ethanol to the 100 μL cell suspension. Vortex samples twice in 5 s pulses and incubate for 2 min at 20°C–24°C. Add 500 μL of PBS and centrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min at +4°C. Discard supernatant and resuspend in 100 μL residual volume, and repeat PBS wash. Discard as much supernatant as possible without disrupting the white and “fluffy” cell pellet/smear. Stain with Aqua fixable viability dye, wash and fix sample in IC fixation buffer (add 100 μL IC fixation buffer to 100 μL stained cell suspension). All single-color compensation controls should be fixed before storing at 2°C–8°C, protected from light.\nAntibody staining for the cell surface marker CD31/PECAM-1, to stain coronary and lymphatic endothelial cells and endocardium.\nResuspend cell pellet in 100 μL diluted BV421 anti-CD31 antibody (1:50 in cell staining buffer). Incubate for 30 min on ice (+2°C to +4°C), protected from light.\nAdd 1 mL of cold cell staining buffer, centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at +4°C, and discard supernatant, keeping 100 μL residual volume.\nResuspend cells in residual volume. Proceed to cell fixation and permeabilization for staining of intracellular antigens.\nNote: If cells exceed 5 × 106, adjust staining volume to 200 μL.",
    "Critical: Before staining for surface markers, take some cells from your allocated control samples to generate FMOs.\nNote: Coronary endothelial cells (CECs) express Wt1 from E11.5, and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) express Sema3d (Lupu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Despite utilizing a protocol for epicardial lineage tracing, with tamoxifen induction at E9.5 for highest epicardium-labeling efficiency and specificity in Wt1CreERT2 mice, approximately 3.4% CECs are directly labeled in E17.5 hearts. Thus, it is important to distinguish (i.e., exclude) endothelial populations during analysis of the epicardium and EPDC populations.\nFixation, permeabilization, and antibody staining for the intracellular marker cTnT, to stain cardiomyocytes.\nAdd 1 mL of PrimeFlow RNA fixation buffer 1, invert to mix and incubate for 30 min on ice (+2°C to +4°C), protected from light.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min at +4°C and discard supernatant, keeping 100 μL residual volume. Resuspend cells in residual volume by vortexing.\nAdd 1 mL of PrimeFlow RNA permeabilization buffer supplemented with RNase inhibitors, invert to mix and centrifuge at 800 × g for 7 min at +4°C. Discard supernatant, keeping 100 μL residual volume. Resuspend cells in residual volume by vortexing.\nRepeat wash as in step c.\nAdd 100 μL diluted BV421 anti-cTnT antibody (1:100 in PrimeFlow RNA permeabilization buffer + RNase inhibitors) to 100 μL cell suspension (final Ab dilution 1:200). Incubate for 30 min on ice (+2°C to +4°C), protected from light.\nRepeat Perm wash as in step c.\nAdd 1 mL of PrimeFlow RNA fixation buffer 2, invert to mix, and incubate for 12–20 h at 2°C–8°C, protected from light.\nNote: Fixation and permeabilization steps are consistent with the manufacturer’s instructions (PrimeFlow RNA Assay kit) with minor adjustments to centrifugation time to accommodate low cell numbers.",
    "Note: Users may include Alexa Fluor 488 anti-WT1 antibody at step e to stain for WT1 protein (Final Ab dilution 1:100). This allows comparison between transcript and protein level of Wt1 in samples, as previously executed in (Lupu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: Before staining for intracellular markers, take some cells from your allocated control samples to generate FMOs.\nCritical: It is critical to use PrimeFlow RNA Tubes and/or PrimeFlow 96-well plate, when carrying out the PrimeFlow RNA assay.\nTarget probe hybridization and signal amplification: day 2\nTiming: 8.5 h\nStaining cells for epicardial gene transcripts (mRNA) using a commercially available in situ hybridization assay for flow cytometry.\nHybridization of Wt1, Sema3d, Tbx18, Tcf21, and Scx probes. Multiplexed target probe combinations (staining panels) are exemplified in Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4], to aid division of cell suspensions to control (FMO) and experimental samples/wells.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_492_3.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_492_4.csv\nFollowing fixation, centrifuge samples at 800 × g for 7 min at 20°C–24°C. Discard supernatant, keeping 100 μL residual volume. Resuspend cells in residual volume by vortexing.\nAdd 1 mL of PrimeFlow RNA wash buffer, invert to mix and centrifuge samples at 800 × g for 7 min at 20°C–24°C. Discard supernatant, keeping 100 μL residual volume. Resuspend cells in residual volume by vortexing.\nRepeat wash as in step b.\nIf users aim to stain 100,000 cells per target probe panel, adjust total volume for each sample using PrimeFlow RNA wash buffer to achieve cell concentration of 500,000 cells/mL. Divide sample into staining panels by transferring 200 μL of cell suspension into the corresponding well of a PrimeFlow 96-well plate. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]",
    "Centrifuge plate at 1,000 × g for 7 min at 20°C–24°C (use an adhesive plate film to cover). Discard supernatant by inverting the plate in a single motion with sufficient force, then blot plate by gently placing it on a paper towel. Briefly vortex to resuspend cells in the ~10 μL residual volume.\nAdd 50 μL of PrimeFlow wash buffer to each well, then add 50 μL diluted target probes (1:20 in Target Probe Diluent) to their corresponding wells (refer to Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] for advice on panels and Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] for 96-well template), and pipet to mix.\nIncubate plate with the lid on for 2 h at 40°C. If using the HybEZ oven, place plate into the center of the humidity control tray.\nContinue protocol as per manufacturer’s instructions in Appendix 7 from step 26 (PrimeFlow RNA assay), however users should modify the centrifugation time to 7 min and add 50 μL of PrimeFlow RNA PreAmp Mix, PrimeFlow RNA Amp Mix, and PrimeFlow RNA Label Probes, respectively, to 50 μL cell suspension.\nFollowing signal amplification and washes, store samples in IC fixation buffer (100 μL cell suspension in PrimeFlow RNA storage buffer + 100 μL IC fixation buffer). Samples should be stored at 2°C–8°C, kept dark, and using an adhesive plate film. We advise acquiring data within 3 days.\nCritical: Allocate wells for corresponding target probe FMOs and divide control sample accordingly. Ensure no fewer than 50,000 cells are used per target probe FMO control sample. FMO controls are treated the same way as experimental samples and should be prepared in parallel (Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).",
    "Critical: While unstained, Aqua dye, and tdTomato single-color compensation controls are prepared on day 1 using cells; BV421, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 647, and Alexa Fluor 750 single-color controls are typically prepared on day 2 using appropriate compensation beads. Bead-based compensation controls are prepared as per manufacturer’s instructions (PrimeFlow RNA assay): (a) add fluorochrome-conjugated antibody (dilution equivalent to sample staining) or 5 μL PrimeFlow Compensation Control to 100 μL compensation bead suspension and incubate for 15–30 min, on ice (+2°C to +4°C), protected from light. (b) Add 1 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at +4°C. (c) Discard supernatant and resuspend beads in 100 μL residual volume. (d) Add 100 μL IC Fixation buffer to the 100 μL stained bead suspension. All single-color compensation controls should be fixed before storing at +4°C, protected from light.\nNote: We advise staining cells in bulk numbers (1.5 mL tubes) during antibody staining of cell surface and intracellular antigens, however if staining panels are more complex and users are working with a considerable number of samples, they may choose to transfer their samples earlier into PrimeFlow 96-well plates. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nNote: If samples ≥1 × 106 cells per well, we advise following the manufacturer’s instructions on volumes (e.g., diluted target probes) and centrifugation time.",
    "Note: If litters are to be harvested over several days, and users wish to compare/quantify gene target levels between samples, we advise limiting tissue collection to 3 consecutive days and carrying out the target probe hybridization for all samples concurrently. To achieve this, samples may be stored in PrimeFlow RNA wash buffer with RNase inhibitors at 2°C–8°C, in the dark, after step 8c (washing of immunostained fixed samples). Samples may be stored for a maximum of 2 days. However, it is important to note that fluorochrome-conjugated antibody brightness will dim with time and should be considered during analysis.\nData collection: day 3\nTiming: 2–6 h\nData collection using BD LSRFortessa X-20 flow cytometer: fitted with UV 355 nm, violet 405 nm, blue 488 nm, yellow-green 561 nm, and red 640 nm lasers and plate-based acquisition (HTS).\nBefore accessing the flow cytometer:\nWash compensation controls with cell staining buffer and resuspend in 300 μL cell staining buffer. Transfer to 5 mL flow cytometry tubes.\nCentrifuge PrimeFlow 96-well plate containing samples and FMOs at 1,000 × g for 7 min at +4°C, and discard supernatant. Resuspend cells in 220 μL cell staining buffer per well, and transfer to V-bottom 96-well polypropylene plates for data collection. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nPlace tubes and plate on ice (+2°C to +4°C) and protect from light.\nSet up PMT voltages for forward-scatter, side-scatter (FSC/SSC) and fluorescence channels.\nRefer to example in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] for cytometer laser/filter configuration.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_492_5.csv\nTo set up FSC/SSC, use an unstained cell sample that has undergone the PrimeFlow assay. This protocol tends to increase autofluorescence and FSC/SSC properties will differ from traditional immunostaining protocols. Ensure that you are collecting all cells of interest on scale and eliminating debris from acquisition.",
    "Ensure that fluorescence channel signals are on scale and adjust PMT voltages accordingly. Use unstained, single-color stained, and full panel samples specifically prepared to help adjust PMT voltages.\nSet compensation.\nFor Aqua dye compensation, acquire and record at least 1,000 positively single-color stained cells. Remove sample, then replace with unstained cell sample and append recording. This will result in 2 signals, a positive and a negative peak fluorescence signal, in the same fluorescence channel recording. Repeat this for tdTomato single-color control. The remaining compensation samples should be acquired as usual.\nCheck compensation settings and proceed to plate-based acquisition (HTS).\nCollect and analyze samples.\nSet up plate-based acquisition, ensure the V-bottom setting is selected. The throughput mode should be set to “Standard.” It is important to keep sample flow rate and sample volume acquired (e.g., 200 μL) consistent between wells. Set number of mixes and wash volume to maximum. There is no need to set a maximum number of events to record in the analysis tab; acquire and record all possible events in your total cells gate (P1). The number of events recorded will be similar between samples as users: (a) stain a set number of cells per sample, (b) resuspend samples in a set volume of buffer (220 μL) prior data collection, and (c) acquire a set volume (200 μL) during data collection.\nCells may have settled to the bottom of the well, resuspend with a multichannel before loading plate. Start collection and analysis of FMOs and samples.\nCritical: If users intend on quantifying and comparing transcript levels between samples, they must collect and analyze samples during the same flow cytometry session.\nCritical: We advise to prepare and acquire FMOs for each developmental stage, and for each independent experiment."
