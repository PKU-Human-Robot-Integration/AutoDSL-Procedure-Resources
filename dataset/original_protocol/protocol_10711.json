    "1. Deep Reflection Mode Photoacoustic Cystography (PAC) System\nSystem configuration17, 18\nA Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (SLII-10; Continuum; 532 nm) pumps a wavelength-tunable laser (Surelite OPO PLUS; Continuum; wavelength tuning range: 680 to 2,500 nm).\nThe pulse duration of each laser shot is ~5 nsec, and the laser repetition rate is 10 Hz.\nThe wavelength depends on the optical absorption peak of the used contrast agent. If methylene blue serves as the contrast agent, an optical wavelength of 667 nm is used, where the peak absorption is. Plasmonic gold nanostructures can have tunable localized surface plasmon resonance at the NIR spectral region, based on their physical and chemical properties. Further, the broad absorption spectrum of single walled carbon nanotubes can provide a wide option for wavelength selection.\nLight coming out of the tunable laser is delivered to a spherical conical lens through right angle prisms (PS908, Thorlabs).\nA donut-shaped light beam pattern is generated after the light passes through the spherical conical lens. The home-made conical lens is made from a BK7 lens and the cone angle is 152°. The diameter of the lens is 2.5 cm.\nThe diverging donut-shaped light beam is redirected via an optical condenser, made of a transparent acrylic sheet. The diameters of the top and bottom surfaces are 6.1 and 4.8 cm, respectively. The thickness of the condenser is 2.5 cm. The redirected ring-shaped light beam forms a donut-shaped with a dark center on the tissue surface.\nUtilize a small water container to boost acoustic coupling. The water container has a bottom opening wrapped with a clear thin polyethylene film which is optically and acoustically transparent. Small animals are positioned under the water container.",
    "The generated PA waves are detected by a spherically focused ultrasound transducer (V308; Olympus NDT; 5 MHz central frequency), which is mounted in the middle of the optical condenser. The element diameter and focal length of the transducer are 1.9 and 2.5 cm, respectively. Thus, the f-number of the transducer is ~1.3.\nThe transverse and axial resolutions are 590 and 144 μm, respectively.\nThe detected PA waves are first amplified by a broadband ultrasonic pulser/receiver (5072PR; Olympus NDT; 35 MHz bandwidth and 59 dB rf gain), and then acquired by an oscilloscope (TDS5054; Tektronix).\nObtain one-dimensional time-resolved images (called as A-line) by measuring the times of arrival of the PA waves. Currently, the speed of PA waves is assumed to be at 1,480 m/sec over the entire image acquisition. Two- (called as B-scans) and three-dimensional PA images can be acquired by mechanically moving the linear raster scanning stage (XY6060; Danaher Dover).\nThe imaging time is ~25 min for one volumetric single-wavelength PA image with a field of view (FOV) of 2.5 x 2.4x 1.5 cm3 in the x-y-z planes. We acquired 125 samples along the x direction with a step size of 0.2 mm, 60 samples along the y direction with a step size of 0.4 mm. 500 data points with a 50-MHz sampling rate were obtained along the z direction. The mechanical scanning is controlled by a home-made NI LabVIEW software system.\nThe volumetric data is represented by maximum amplitude projection (MAP) using a MathWorks MATLAB software system.\nSystem alignment\n\t\nAfter the spherical conical lens, make sure that the beam pattern is a perfect ring shape. If the donut-shaped beam pattern is not properly generated, the PA signals originated from the skin surface are dominant. Thus, it is difficult to achieve deep tissue imaging.",
    "The line-shaped light focus in water should be coaxially aligned with the ultrasound focal zone. If those are not coaxially aligned, the system suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio.\nThe irradiated laser pulse energy on the skin surface is varied from ~1 - 2 mJ/cm2 when the wavelength is tuned from 680 to 1,000 nm, respectively. These laser pulse energies are much lower than the American National Standards Institute safety limit, varying from 20 to 80 mJ/cm2 over the spectral region, respectively.\n2. In vivo and Ex vivo Imaging Procedures\nAnimal preparation\n\t\nUse female Spraque-Dawley rats with a weight of 200 - 250 g in all PA imaging experiments.\nTo begin with, anesthetize the rat by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (85 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (15 mg/kg).\nDepilate the hairs in the abdominal area.\nPosition the rat atop of a custom-made animal holder.\nCoat a 22-gauge catheter with lubricant to improve the catheter insertion.\nHold the catheter vertically over the urethral opening. Next, insert the distal end of the catheter, horizontally, into the urethra until the hub of the catheter finally reaches the opening.\nUrine in the bladder will void via the catheter.\nIn vivo PAC imaging\n\t\nPosition the rat, located on top of the animal holder, below the water container in the PAC system.\nApply ultrasound gel (Sonotech) between the animal skin surface and plastic membrane to improve acoustic coupling.\nFully anesthetize the rat using vaporized isoflurane (1 L/min of oxygen and 0.75% isoflurane) during the in vivo PA imaging experiments.\nObtain a control PA image prior to injection of contrast agents.",
    "Introduce an aqueous solution of methylene blue (0.8 μl/g body weight with a concentration of 30 mM), gold nanocages (1.2 μl/g body weight with a concentration of 2 nM), or single walled carbon nanotubes (0.8 μl/g body weight with a concentration of 0.3 μM) to the bladder via the catheter. Use a 1-ml-syringe with a 22-gauge catheter.\nAcquire a series of PA images.\nEx vivo PAC imaging\n\t\nSacrifice the rat after in vivo PAC imaging, by injecting an overdose of pentobarbital.\nRemove the two major organs, bladders and kidneys, to investigate biodistribution, and on a glass plate.\nPosition the glass plate below the water container in the PAC system.\nApply ultrasound gel (Sonotech) between the excised organs and plastic membrane to improve acoustic coupling.\nAcquire PA images.\nPhotoacoustically image the organs removed from a healthy rat as a control.\nSubscription Required.
