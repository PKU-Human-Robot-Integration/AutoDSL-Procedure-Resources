    "All methods described here have been approved by the Swiss Cantonal Veterinary Office under license number ZH246/15.\n1. Preparation of the Step Catheters\nPreparation of a fused silica tubing for the step of the catheter\nCut the fused silica capillary with inner diameter of 0.1 mm and wall thickness of 0.0325 mm tubing to a length of 30 mm.\nExamine the tubing for cracks and heat polish the ends using a microforge to ensure the tubing openings have a smooth surface.\nFixation of the inner tube in a metal needle\nMount a 27 G needle on a 10 μL syringe and place the syringe in a stereotactic robot.\nUsing the robot, move the syringe over a hard surface and touch it with the needle tip. This position should be noted or saved in the software because it will serve as a reference surface for setting the length of the catheter step.\nElevate the needle to enable placing of the fused silica capillary inside of the needle\nPlace the fused silica capillary in the needle such that 20 mm of the capillary is protruding from the needle.\nUsing a pipette, evenly spread 2 μL of high viscosity cyanoacrylate adhesive over the capillary, starting from the metal needle and finishing 10 mm above the lower end of the capillary, as depicted in Figure 2.\nUsing the stereotactic robot, lower the needle until the tip of the metal needle is 1 mm over the reference surface. This way the fused silica capillary will be fixed in the metal needle and will form a 1 mm step from the tip of the metal needle. Remove any excess of glue forming at the end of the metal needle to avoid blunting the step.",
    "Wait 15 min for the glue to harden and remove the syringe with the catheter from the stereotactic robot. Confirm that at the step all excess glue has been removed by checking the tip of the catheter under a microscope.\nTesting the step catheter using a block of agarose\nPrepare 0.6% agarose solution in PBS in a conventional gel tray and wait until it polymerizes. Cut the agarose in approximately 20 mm x 20 mm blocks. Until use, keep the blocks immersed in PBS.\nManually fill the step catheter syringe with 10 μL of 0.4% solution of filtered trypan blue.\nUsing the stereotactic robot, dispense 1 μL at 0.2 μL/min in order to assess sealing of the step of the catheter during the fixation procedure. Trypan blue solution should be visible solely on the tip of the catheter. Wipe it off with a paper tissue.\nPlace the agarose block in the stereotactic robot and calibrate the robot so the tip of the catheter is referenced against the surface of the agarose block.\nProgram the injection parameters for CED.\n\t\t\nFor the injection volume of 5 µL, use the following steps: 1 µL at 0.2 µL/min, then 2 µL at 0.5 µL/min and 2 µL at 0.8 µL/min. Adjust the final injection volume according to the specific experimental plan by proportionally changing the duration of each of the steps.\nIn order to inject the solution into murine caudate putamen (striatum), perform such injection in a position 1 mm frontal and 1.5–2 mm lateral from bregma at the depth of 3.5 mm.\nAfter the injection, leave the catheter in place for 2 min and then retract at 1 mm/min to ensure proper dispersion of the fluid in the brain and sealing of the injection tract during catheter removal.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the specific stereotactic robot used, all the parameters can be programmed into a single script. An example script is available as Supplementary Material.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59675/CED_5_ul_striatum.txt].\nStart the CED procedure and inject 5 μL of trypan blue solution into the agarose block.\nAssess the shape of cloud of trypan blue in the agarose and potential leakage along the catheter tract. Trypan blue should form an ellipsoid or a round cloud with the center around the catheter tip and a diameter of at least 1 mm. No major backflow over the tip of the metal needle should be visible.\nPlace a new agarose block and start a second injection of 1 µL at 0.2 µL/min in order to assess clogging of the catheter with the agarose. Trypan blue should again start forming a cloud from the tip of the catheter immediately after the start of the injection.\nAssess whether the leftover volume in the syringe corresponds to 3 µL. Any variations might point towards a leakage of fluid through the catheter mounting or syringe plunger.\nIf all the test injections are successful, the catheter is well sealed, straight and no trypan blue solution is observed from other spots than the catheter tip, wash the catheter with deionized H2O (dH2O) until no traces of trypan blue are visible and then wash ten times as follows: 70% ethanol and 100% ethanol followed by flushing again with 70% ethanol and clean deionized water.\nStore the catheter under dry conditions.\n2. Convection-enhanced Delivery of Antibody Solution into the Murine Brain",
    "NOTE: Depending on local animal welfare regulations, various types of anesthetics, analgesics and antibiotics can be implemented for this procedure. This protocol describes the use of injection anesthesia. Inhalation anesthetics such as isoflurane can also be used by mounting a nose mask on the stereotactic frame. In addition, we recommend adding antibiotics to the drinking water for infection prophylaxis.\nSurgical setup\nPrepare anesthetics and antidote solutions. Mice can be safely anesthetized using a three-component anesthesia containing fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg) diluted in sterile dH2O. We perform a two-step wake up procedure using two antidote solutions, one containing flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) in sterile dH2O (first antidote solution). The second one contains atipamezole (2.5 mg/kg) in sterile dH2O (second antidote solution).\nPrepare analgesia solution containing carprofen (5.667 mg/kg) diluted with sterile dH2O.\nClean the stereotactic frame, heating pad and elements of the stereotactic robot. Bear in mind that not all the parts of the robot can be cleaned without risk of damage. Refer to the manual of the robot for details on cleaning and preparing for usage.\nAssemble the syringe with the step catheter and flush it multiple times with dH2O, 70% ethanol and 100% ethanol followed by flushing again with 70% ethanol and dH2O. Finally, flush the syringe with PBS or other buffers to be used for preparation of the solution for intracranial injection, e.g. artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The plunger of the syringe should move smoothly and freely during the whole procedure.\nCalibrate the stereotactic robot software with the stereotactic frame.",
    "Test the stereotactic robot software by ensuring that the robot arms move freely and that the injection pump is properly connected and can perform the CED procedure without any disturbances. This includes testing robot movement, ramping injection, checking the 2 min waiting step and the speed of catheter retraction. All the parameters should fit the preprogrammed CED procedure described in point 1.3.5.\nInsert the drill bit in the drill. It is recommended to sterilize the drill bits before use.\nPrepare antibody solution using PBS or other buffer solutions such as aCSF. 1 to 20 µg of antibody in 5 µL can be injected in a single CED procedure. Other volumes and protein amounts should be tested prior to performing the experiment. Be aware that using high viscosity solutions might lead to catheter clogging.\nManually load the syringe with the diluted antibody.\nAntibody injection by CED into striatum\nWeigh the mouse and inject the three-component anesthesia solution into the peritoneum according to the body weight. Note the injection time. Transfer the mouse to a separate cage heated with a heating pad.\nObserve the mouse to determine when the sedation starts. As soon as the mouse stops moving, apply ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to protect the cornea from drying out during the surgery. Full sedation usually starts 10–15 min from the injection of the three-component anesthesia solution.\nCheck pain reactions using the pinch-reflex test to ensure full anesthesia of the animal.\nShave the head using a hair trimmer.\nDisinfect the skin with cotton swabs soaked in iodine solution. Scrub the skin three times in circular motion.\nUsing a scalpel, make a 10 mm skin incision along the cranial midline finishing on the eye level.",
    "Fix the mouse in the stereotactic frame using the nose clamp and ear bars. Ensure that the skull surface is horizontal and tightly secured. Apart from correct anatomical navigation this is also crucial to avoid tilting of the skull during the drilling and the CED procedure.\nPlace the syringe in the stereotactic robot.\nSynchronize the drill bit with the tip of the catheter on a reference point. It is crucial that the relation between the position of the drill and the syringe is precisely determined in the software, so the injection can be performed in the desired anatomical region of the brain.\nRetract the skin using forceps and localize bregma on the skull surface.\nReference bregma in the software using the tip of the drill bit.\nMove the drill to a position 1 mm frontal and 2 mm lateral from bregma and drill a burr hole. Be careful not to damage the dura mater.\nMove the syringe over the burr hole.\nDispense 0.5–1 μL from the syringe to ensure that no air bubbles are left in the catheter.\nStart the CED program described in point 1.3.5. Observe the skull surface for any traces of fluid backflow from the injection spot. Monitor the breathing rate of the animal.\nOnce the CED program is over and the catheter is withdrawn from the brain, start the injection pump at 0.2 µL/min in order to check for catheter clogging during the CED. If no clogging occurred, you should immediately see a droplet of injection mix coming from the catheter tip.\nPrior to reusing or storing the catheter, visually examine the catheter step for any signs of damage or wear under a microscope and clean it as in step 1.3.10.\nWaking up procedure\nGently remove the mouse from the stereotactic frame.",
    "Wash the surgery site with sterile saline solution.\nUsing forceps, fill the burr hole with bone wax.\nClose the skin with thin-tipped forceps and apply surgical glue with a 10 µL pipette over the cut. Wait 15–30 s for the glue to polymerize.\nApply analgesia solution by subcutaneous injection. Note the time of injection.\nApply the first antidote solution. Note the time of injection.\nTransfer the mouse to a separate cage with a heating pad and monitor the animal for startle reflexes.\nIf mouse has not gained full consciousness 15 min after administration of the first antidote solution, apply the second antidote solution by subcutaneous injection.\nMonitor animals during recovery phase.\nCheck 1–2 h later as well as the next day for post-operative complications. If necessary, re-apply the analgesia.\nFor infection prophylaxis, add sulfadoxin (final concentration 0.08% w/v) and trimethoprim (final concentration 0.016% w/v) to drinking water to which the animals have access ad libitum for 1 week after the surgery.\nSubscription Required.
