    "1. Ventral Laparotomy\n Anesthetize a dam whose embryos are at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5; noon on the day a vaginal plug is detected is day 0.5 of embryonic development) by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital anesthetic solution (7.5 μL per gram body weight). Working anesthetic solution: 180 μL of 50 mg/mL pentobarbital sodium solution; 100 μL of absolute ethanol; 320 μL of 65 mg/mL aqueous magnesium sulfate (modulates uterine tone); and 400 μL of propylene glycol (vehicle miscible with aqueous and organic components).    \n Assess completeness of anesthesia by conducting noxious stimuli tests: paw squeeze; tail pinch; and blink response to cheek and vibrissae touch. Apply sterile ophthalmic ointment to the corneas. \n Shave the abdominal fur from the suprapubic area to the rib cage with shears and a fine blade (Oster #40 blade). Disinfect the abdomen with 70% ethanol, 10% povidone iodine (Betadine), and 70% ethanol, sequentially. Place mouse abdomen-side down on a sterile drape and then set on a heating pad or warm plate (37 °C) for 2-5 mins. \n Incise the abdominal skin in the ventral midline with ball-tipped scissors. Extend the incision for 10-14 mm. Identify the linea alba, an avascular, white connective tissue band along the ventral midline of the abdominal wall. Incise the linea alba with ball tipped scissors and extend the incision 10-14 mm. Immediately irrigate the abdomen with prewarmed (37 °C) lactated Ringer's solution. \n Externalize the two horns of the uterus with ring forceps without applying excessive pressure on the implantation sites. Irrigate the externalized uterine horns with prewarmed, lactated Ringer's solution. \n2. Transuterine Microinjection",
    "Fabricate a thick-walled, borosilicate glass capillary microinjection pipette with the following characteristics: 12-16 μm outer diameter and a 20 degree bevel. On a Sutter P-97 pipette puller with small box filament, use the following program: heat = ramp test plus 3 units; pressure = 200; pull = 0; velocity = 46; time = 100). With the Sutter BV-10 beveler, use the 104C (gold) abrasive disk for large diameter pipettes. Resuspend expression plasmid at 3-4 μg/μL in calcium free phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2-7.4). Add crystalline fast green to the concentrated DNA, vortex gently for 30 seconds, and spin at 10,000 g for 10 seconds. The minimum amount of fast green required to visually track the efficacy of the injection is determined empirically. Backfill the beveled pipette with the DNA/fast green solution. Connect the loaded microinjection pipette to the pipette holder of the pressure injector (Picospritzer using >99% pure nitrogen as source gas).    \n Transilluminate the uterus with low intensity, halogen light to visualize the embryo within its implantation site. Identify the beating heart, brain vesicles, limb buds, nascent 4th ventricle of the hindbrain, and eye. Irrigate the uterus every 2 minutes with prewarmed, lactated Ringer's solution to maintain hydration. Apply gentle pressure on the uterus to reorient the embryo and identify the anatomical landmarks noted above. \n Orient the embryo to identify the primary head vein whose anterior and posterior branches flank the mesenchymal territory in which the otocyst resides. The otocyst proper cannot be seen by transillumination of the uterus. The otocyst is located midway between the anterior and posterior branches of the primary head vein which, along with the main trunk of the vein, form the shape of the uprights or goalposts on an American football field. The otocyst is midway between the uprights.",
    "Insert the injection pipette through the uterus in a trajectory in line with the presumptive location of the otocyst. Pulse the microinjector once after passing through the uterus to visualize the tracer dye and the approximate the location of the pipette tip. Advance the pipette under micrometer control and pulse again to assess depth. Further advance the pipette into the lateral head mesenchyme and pulse repeatedly. Successful otocyst targeting will reveal the tapered shape of the endolymphatic duct dorsally and the scallop shell-shape of the vestibule. Release pressure on the uterus, remove the pipette from the embryo/uterus in one motion, and immediately irrigate the uterus with prewarmed, lactated Ringer's solution. \n3. In vivo Electroporation\n Irrigate the uterus with lactated Ringer's solution. Freshly applied lactated Ringer's solution is necessary to electrically couple the paddle-style electrodes to the uterus. Moisten the tungsten surfaces of the electrodes with lactated Ringer's. Center the injected otocyst in the path of the electrodes. Gently compress the uterus with the electroporation paddles. The cathode is in contact with the uterine wall lateral to the injected otocyst and the anode is in contact with the uterine wall adjacent to the uninjected otocyst. Trigger a square wave pulse train with the foot pedal switch on the electroporator. Electroporation parameters are: 5, 50 msec pulses at 43 volts per pulse and a 950 msec interpulse delay. Immediately irrigate the uterus after the pulse train is delivered. Record the current delivered to the tissue: 60-100 mAmps is sufficient to transfect otic epithelial progenitors. Inject and electroporate 4-6, E11.5 embryos per dam.",
    "Perform a second, independent transuterine microinjection of aqueous fluorescent dextran (Alexa Fluor 488 if the expression plasmid encodes a red fluorescent protein or Alex Fluor 594 if the expression plasmid encodes a green fluorescent protein) into the 4th ventricle of those embryos whose inner ears are accurately injected and at least 60 mAmps of current per pulse was delivered during electroporation. The fluorescent dextran will be detectable at birth in the hindbrain and enable selection of pups whose inner ears were manipulated during embryogenesis (see 3.5). \n Irrigate the uterine horns with lactated Ringer's. Reinsert the uterine horns into the abdominal cavity. Flush the uterine cavity with 2-4 mL of prewarmed, lactated Ringer's solution and allow the overflow to drain out of the incision site onto the sterile drape. Replace the draping with dry, sterile material. Suture the abdominal wall with a non-cutting needle and a 6-0 resorbable suture. We prefer a running stitch, locking every other stitch, for both the abdominal wall and skin. \n Dry the dams' fur and administer a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as Meloxicam by subcutaneous injection. Return the dam to the prewarmed recovery cage on a sterile drape. Monitor and record the dams' respirations, incision site patency, and vagina for bloody discharge. Bleeding is rare but if present and unabated, euthanize the dam while she is still under anesthesia. Note the time she regains consciousness and attempts to ambulate. Return the dam to the mouse colony when she shows signs of eating and drinking and has begun to nest build. Typically, this occurs within 12 hrs.",
    "At birth (postnatal day 0), flash the hindbrain region of each pup in the litter to detect the fluorescent dextran using a stereofluorescence dissecting microscope with a GFP or Texas Red filter set as appropriate. Return to the lactating dam only those pups that display hindbrain labeling. \n4. Representative Results\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3653/3653fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Electroporation-mediated gene transfer to the developing cochlea.  The E11.5 otocyst was injected with an expression plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and electroporated (pulse train parameters: five, 43 volt pulses at 50 msec/pulse and 950 msec interpulse delay). A) A representative inner ear from a postnatal day 6 (P6) pup whose otocyst was injected and electroporated at E11.5 demonstrating EGFP expression from the base through the middle turn of the cochlea. The lateral wall of the cochlea was removed from the middle turn and apex only. E11.5 progenitors that give rise to the apex were not transfected. B) Whole mount immunostaining of the cochlea in (A) with the hair cell marker, myosin 7a (Myo7a), indicates that EGFP expression follows the trajectory of the organ of Corti and is grossly localized to the hair cell-bearing sensory epithelium. C) A representative inner ear from an E18.5 embryo whose otocyst was injected and electroporated at E11.5. The laser confocal projection demonstrates EGFP expression in Myo7a-positive sensory hair cells. D) Laser confocal projection of the cochlear sensory epithelium from the E18.5 organ of Corti indicating EGFP expression in the inner hair cells (ihc), outer hair cells (ohc), inner phalangial cells (ipc), pillar cells (pc), and Deiters' cells (dc). The scale bar in (B) applies to (A).Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
