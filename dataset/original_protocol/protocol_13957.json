    "1. Preparation of Culture Medium for NK Cells and Hepatic Tumor Cells\nUse human natural killer cells (e.g., NK92MI) and human liver cancer cell line (e.g., SK-HEP-1).\nPrepare NK cell culture medium for NK92MI human NK cells by adding the following components to 500 mL of minimum essential medium Eagle alpha without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides to the indicated final concentrations: 0.02 mM folic acid (100 µL of 100 mM folic acid), 0.2 mM myoinositol (500 µL of 200 mM myoinositol), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (3.5 µL of 14.3 M β-mercaptoethanol), 2 mM L-glutamine (5 mL of 200 mM L-glutamine), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (5 mL of 100x penicillin/streptomycin), 12.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 12.5% horse serum. Mix and filter sterilize using a 0.22 µm sterile filtration unit, and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare culture medium for hepatic tumor cell line SK-HEP-1 by adding 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 2 mM L-glutamine.\n2. Colorimetric LDH Measurement-based NK Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity Assay\nGrow SK-HEP-1 cells to 70−80% confluency in a 100 mm cell culture Petri dish in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Generate a single-cell suspension by first washing cells with 5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by incubation with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator until a single cell suspension is generated.\n\tNOTE: NK cell activity can be induced by stressed cancer cells due to changes in expression of NK cell-activating ligand in cancer cells. Therefore, healthy and sub-confluent cancer cells should be used for accurate results. It is also important to note that NK cell receptors and ligands can be sensitive to trypsinization26,27. Therefore, the trypsinization protocol should be carefully optimized and excessive trypsinization should be avoided.",
    "After trypsinization, add 10 mL of SK-HEP-1 culture medium and centrifuge at 160 x g for 3 min in a 15 mL sterile conical centrifuge tube. Wash the cell pellet with 5 mL of 1x PBS and resuspend in 5 mL of culture medium.\nIn parallel, centrifuge the NK92MI cells at 160 x g for 3 min in a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube. Wash the cell pellet with 5 mL of 1x PBS and resuspend in 5 mL of NK92MI cell culture medium.\n\tNOTE: NK92MI cells are grown in NK cell culture medium and obtained similarly as described in step 2.1.\nCount the SK-HEP-1 and NK92MI cells using a hemocytometer or any available automated cell counter.\nAdd SK-HEP-1 cells (target cells) (1 x 104/100 µL/well) and NK92MI cells (effector cells) (1 x 105/100 µL/well) in the ratio of 1:10 target:effector and seed in triplicate wells in a 96 well plate.\nIncubate the 96 well plate at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 3 h. After incubation, centrifuge plate at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nWithout disturbing the cell pellet, collect 100 µL of supernatant from each well and transfer to a well in a new 96 well plate.\nAdd 50 µL of LDH substrate, mix well, and incubate the plate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark.\nStop the reaction by adding 50 µL of stop solution (50% dimethylformamide and 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate at pH 4.7). Immediately measure the absorbance of the plate at 490 nm and 680 nm using a plate reader.\nSubtract the absorbance at 680 nm from the absorbance at 490 nm. Calculate the percent (%) NK cell cytotoxicity using the formula below.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60714/60714eq1.jpg",
    "where LDH experimental (effector + target cells) is the absorbance of NK92MI cells and SK-HEP-1 cells, LDH effector cells is the absorbance of NK92MI cells alone, LDH spontaneous is the absorbance of SK-HEP-1 cells alone, and LDH maximal is the absorbance of SK-HEP-1 cells with lysis buffer.\n\tNOTE: To reduce serum interference, always use the following controls: target cells alone (SK-HEP-1), effector cells alone (NK92MI), target cells with lysis buffer as a complete lysis control, target cell medium, NK92MI medium, as well as target cell medium and NK92MI medium in a 1:1 ratio.\n3. Calcein AM Staining-based Microscopic Method for Measuring NK Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity\nCulture SK-HEP-1 cells to 70−80% confluency. Generate a single-cell suspension by first washing cells with 5 mL of 1x PBS followed by incubation with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA.\nCentrifuge SK-HEP-1 cells in a 1 mL sterile centrifuge tube at 160 x g for 3 min. Resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of serum-free DMEM.\nAdd 1.5 µL of calcein AM solution (10 mM) to SK-HEP-1 cells and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Centrifuge calcein AM-labeled SK-HEP-1 cells at 160 x g for 3 min in a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube.\nWash cells twice with 5 mL of 1x PBS to remove excess calcein AM dye.\nIn parallel, centrifuge NK92MI cells at 160 x g for 3 min in a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube. Wash the cell pellet once with 5 mL of 1x PBS and resuspend in 5 mL of NK92MI cell medium.\nCount calcein AM-labeled SK-HEP-1 cells and NK92MI cells using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\nResuspend SK-HEP-1 cells in culture medium at 1 x 105 cells/mL and NK92MI cells at 1 x 106 cells/mL in NK cell medium.",
    "Plate calcein AM-labeled SK-HEP-1 cells (target cells) (1 x 104/100 µL/well) with NK92MI cells (effector cells) (1 x 105/100 µL/well) (1:10 target:effector ratio) per well in triplicate wells in a 96 well plate.\nIncubate the 96 well plate at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 4 h. After incubation, capture fluorescence images of the calcein AM-labeled cells using a fluorescence microscope at 10x magnification. Capture at least 10 different fields of each replicate for each treatment condition.\nRandomly select 10 images for each replicate and count calcein AM-positive labeled target cells incubated with or without NK92MI cells. Calculate % cytotoxicity using the formula below.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60714/60714eq2.jpg\n\tNOTE: As controls, use target cells without NK92MI cells and completely lysed target cells as complete lysis control. For complete lysis, incubate the cells in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h (20 µL of 5% Triton X-100 in 200 µL of culture media).\n4. NK Cell Migration Assay\nGrow NK92MI cells and centrifuge cells at 160 x g for 3 min in a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube.\nWash the cell pellet twice with 5 mL of 1x PBS and resuspend the cells in 3 mL of serum-free NK92MI cell medium. Count NK92MI cells using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\nPlate NK92MI cells (2.5 x 105 cells/100 µL/well) in the upper compartment of transwell permeable chamber (6.5 mm diameter insert and 5 µm pore size).\nIn the bottom chamber add 0.6 mL of serum-free medium containing material to be tested for NK cell chemoattractant properties (e.g., conditioned medium, chemokines, cytokines).\n\tNOTE: When preparing conditioned medium, use reduced-serum medium without added serum to eliminate interference from serum proteins in the migration assay.",
    "Incubate the 24 well permeable chambers at 37 °C for 4 h. After 4 h, collect the non-adherent and migrated NK92MI cells from the bottom chamber and transfer them to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tubes for further analysis.\n\tNOTE: The time of culture may vary depending on the type of target cells, as well as the amount and kinetics of chemokines produced by the target cells. Therefore, this time should be empirically determined for each cell type, chemokine, and experiment.\nAdd predetermined number of counting beads for flow cytometry in a volume of 50 µL to each tube containing migrated NK cells. Evaluate the volume of 300 µL/well cell suspension using any flow cytometer capable of automated FACS-based cell counting.\n\tNOTE: Mix or vortex-mix the counting beads for flow cytometry thoroughly each time before use to ensure that a constant number of beads is used to minimize experimental variability. Reverse pipetting is recommended with count beads to maintain accuracy. Use only NK cells and counting beads for flow cytometry as FACS analysis controls. The authors recommend reading at least 10,000 beads + NK cells combined, an amount that has worked well. However, this number may vary depending upon the experimental conditions. Therefore, the combined number of beads + NK cells should be empirically determined for each type of experiment. Additionally, it is important to perform experiments using biological triplicates to achieve statistically significant results and to account for variability between different cell counts.\nCalculate absolute number of migrated NK92MI cells using this formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60714/60714eq3.jpg\n\twhere A = number of cells, B = number of beads, C = assigned bead count of the lot (number of counting beads for flow cytometry/50 µL; in this example 49,500), and D = volume of sample (µL).",
    "NOTE: If 300 µL of sample volume (migrated cells) is used for FACS analysis with 50 µL of counting beads for flow cytometry, the absolute number of migrated cells = 1,700 cells /3,300 bead events x 49,500 beads/300 µL = 84.975 cells/µL. The calculation should be corrected if the sample is diluted or if a different volume of FACS counting beads are used."
