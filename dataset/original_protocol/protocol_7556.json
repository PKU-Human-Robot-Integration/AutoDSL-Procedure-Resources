    "Creating colonies You will be creating pairs of colonies (one control and one experimental) from the same source colony to ensure that each pair of colonies has the same genetic background.Control and experimental colonies should have very similar levels of food stores.It is important that all bees (control and experimental) experience the same incubator conditions to account for the potential effects of incubation on bee development and behavior.Each observation hive consists of two combs (43.5 cm × 23 cm)—one frame of brood and one frame of honey and pollen—and is connected by a 2.2 cm inner diameter and 25 cm long tube through the wall to the outside.Creating the experimental colony:Remove combs with late-stage pupae from haphazardly selected large, healthy colonies.Place the combs inside a nuc box (standard honey bee nucleus box) inside an incubator for 24 h.Maintain the incubator in a dark environment with a temperature of 34 and a relative humidity of 75%.Transfer 2,800 one-day-old bees that emerge to a two-frame observation hive with a new egg-laying queen.Mark 200 of the one-day-old bees with a paint pen. You will track these bees in the experiment.Ensure that the experimental colonies contain no eggs or brood but only the queen, 2,800 newly emerged bees (of which 200 are marked), and approximately a half comb of pollen and a half comb of honey.Creating the control colony:Take the source colony and place one comb with late-stage pupae into a nuc box in the same incubator for 24 h.Maintain the incubator in a dark environment with a temperature of 34 and a relative humidity of 75%.Mark 200 of the one-day-old bees that emerge with a paint pen. You will track these bees in the experiment.",
    "At the same time, take 2,600 bees of all ages and, likewise, place them on combs in a nuc box in the same incubator for 24 h under the same conditions.Transfer the 2,800 one-day-old bees to a two-frame observation hive with a new egg-laying queen.Repeat as needed to create five experimental colonies and five control colonies that derive from five original source colonies.These videos illustrate the waggle dances of control bees (Video 1) that exhibit normal levels of error and the waggle dances of experimental bees that did not have the opportunity to follow other dancers before they first danced and therefore show higher levels of error (Video 2).

First waggle dance of a bee from an experimental colony that was never able to follow another waggle dancer before performing its first waggle dance (green and purple paint on thorax) Monitoring first waggle dances with no prior experience Observe all colonies every day during daylight hours until the first bees fly out to forage.Train these foragers to a 55% (w/v) sucrose feeder placed 150 m from the colony.Choose locations such that a direct flight path from the colony to the feeder results in bees from each colony experiencing similar levels of optic flow (see this example of our field site: https://map.bmcx.com/ciba__map/[href=https://map.bmcx.com/ciba__map/]).Ensure that feeders are placed on a grass field with similar local landmarks (similar buildings and trees) at each feeder site.",
    "Create feeders consisting of a 70 mL vial (8 cm high) inverted over a circular plastic disk with 18 feeding grooves through which the sucrose can flow.Fill the vial with sucrose solution, then invert on the plastic disk and place over a piece of colored paper to help bees return to the feeder once they have learned its location (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4789/bioprotoc-13-16-4789-g001.jpgFigure 1. Honey bees foraging for 55% (w/v) sucrose solution on a grooved plate feeder Ensure that no more than 30 foragers visit the feeder at a time and remove bees with an aspirator as needed to reduce crowding.To train bees, place a glass vial at the entrance of the nest to trap the bees flying out and bring them to a feeder 150 m away, where they are released and begin to imbibe sucrose.Individually mark the bees with different paint pen colors.Allow bees to visit the feeder a few times until they waggle dance.Continuously observe all visits of every bee to the feeder.Record the first five waggle dance performances of five different bees per colony using a high-definition video camera (HDR-PJ790, Sony).Illuminate observation colonies with natural light from a window.Measure the time it takes for foragers to fly back from the feeder to the nest immediately before they waggle dance (defined as return times, with measurements coordinated with the hive and feeder observers via two-way radios).Revisiting waggle dancing after 20 d of experience Twenty days later, retrain the marked foragers whose first dances were observed to the same 150 m feeder locations and record their waggle dances to determine if their dancing has changed. At this point, the workers should be, on average, 29 and 30 days old in experimental and control colonies, respectively. See Table 1 for a detailed description of bee type names.Table 1.",

    "Video-record these waggle dancers and measure their return times (see above).Hypothesize that E2Older Dancers dances, due to experience, have increased precision and orderliness above that of E1First Dances naive dances.In the 20 days between E1First Dances naive and E2Older Dancers dances, the feeder is not available.Note that E2Older Dancers can only follow other dancers of the same age with similar experience levels. C2Older Dancers can follow dancers of different ages with different experience levels.Measuring the waggle dance To analyze the waggle dance, use Tracker software (V4.91).Exclude the first waggle run for each dance of every bee and analyze the subsequent six waggle runs (Couvillon et al., 2012).Define a dance as a series of consecutive waggle runs and return phases during one visit of a forager inside the nest.For each dance (Figure 2), measure:The waggle run angle relative to gravity.The waggle dance divergence angle (the maximum difference between waggle angles during six waggle runs).The waggle run duration, defined from when the bee begins to turn and starts to waggle her abdomen to when she stops waggling her abdomen and moves into another turn.The waggle duration error (the duration difference between longest and shortest waggle run within a dance).Waggle duration variance (coefficient of variance of the waggle durations).The number of waggles per waggle run (each waggle is defined as one complete movement of the abdominal tip from right to left to right).Variance in the number of waggles per waggle run (coefficient of variance of the number of waggles per waggle run per dance).Return phase duration.Return phase duration variance (coefficient of variance).Total number of waggle runs within a dance.The number of dance followers (each follower defined as a bee following a waggle dancer for ≥ 5 s) per waggle dance performance.",
    "To measure the start and stop of a waggle run, respectively define them by measuring the start and stop of dancer wing oscillations from the video (recorded at 60 fps).Measure the rate of return phase non-alternations (dance disorder) and define it as the number of non-alternating return phases (Tan et al., 2012).i. Count the pattern of consecutive return phases and calculate the disorder proportion by dividing the total number of return phase non-alternations by the total number of waggle runs within a dance.ii. After a dancer makes a waggle phase, she can make a return phase by turning either to her left (L) or her right (R). Dancers often alternate these return phases (i.e., L-R-L-R). A non-alternation return phase occurs when she makes two consecutive return phases in the same direction. For example, the pattern L-L-L-L would be counted as three return phase non-alternations, since we compare each return phase direction with the prior one.For additional details on how to measure waggle dances, we recommend these excellent papers: Griffin et al., 2012; Preece and Beekman, 2014; Wario et al., 2015; Schürch et al., 2019.Please see Video 1 and Video 2 for examples of waggle dances that show different levels of error.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4789/bioprotoc-13-16-4789-g002.jpgFigure 2. Diagram illustrating waggle dance measurements. The diagram on the left shows the location of the food source relative to the sun and the nest. This arrangement results in the waggle dance diagram shown in the center. In this diagram, the angle (α) of the waggle run is the angle between the waggle direction and the vertical dashed blue line (defined by gravity on a vertical comb). This waggle angle communicates the direction of the food source from the colony relative to the sun’s azimuth at the time of the dance.",
    "For example, if a food source is in the direction of the sun, the waggle run points straight up. If a food source is in the direction opposite the sun, the waggle run points straight down. In this example, α = 45° to the left of the vertical line, and thus the food source is located 45° to the left of the sun’s azimuth. The waggle run consists of waggling motions of the abdomen, made as the bee traverses a line crossing three points: A, B, and C. The waggle duration is measured from point A to point C. Each waggle is defined by the abdominal tip moving from points a-b-c. (one peak-to-peak cycle). The return phase duration is measured as the time it takes a bee to return from a completed waggle run, and is shown by the curve C-D-A or the curve C-E-A. In a fully ordered waggle dance, the dancer typically turns in the opposite direction on each repetition. For example, if the dancer traverses C-D-A, on the next return phase it will likely follow the path C-E-A. A photo of a waggle dancing bee (w) surrounded by dance followers (f) is shown for context on the right."
