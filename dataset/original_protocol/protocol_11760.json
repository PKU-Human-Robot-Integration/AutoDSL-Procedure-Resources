    "1. Sample Preparation: fixation, dehydration, and LR-White embedding\nFixation and dehydration\n\tNOTE: The fixation process is critical to preserve the sample; by crosslinking molecules the cellular metabolism is stopped, ensuring cellular integrity and preventing molecular diffusion. Fixative agents and the concentration used must be adjusted to that purpose, leaving the antigens sufficiently exposed to interact with the antibodies. The following protocol combines the mild fixative capability of paraformaldehyde, with the stronger effect of glutaraldehyde. Their proportions were optimized for AGPs and cell wall components, but it is suitable for other proteins and cell structures. The subsequent dehydration process will prepare the samples for LR-White embedding. Plant tissues from several plant species were used in this experiment. Quercus suber samples were collected from trees grown in the field. Trithuria submersa samples were kindly shared with us by Paula Rudall (Kew Gardens, London, UK).\n\t\nSow all Arabidopsis plants directly on soil and grow in an indoor growth facility with 60% relative humidity and a day/night cycle of 16 h light at 21 °C and 8 h darkness at 18 °C. Select the plant tissues to be analyzed, and trim samples to be no more than 16 mm2 in size.\nImmediately transfer the sample to a glass vial previously filled with enough cold fixative solution (2% formaldehyde (w/v), 2.5% glutaraldehyde (w/v), 25 mM PIPES pH 7 and 0.001% Tween-20 (v/v)) to completely submerge the samples (Figure 1A).\n\t\tCAUTION: Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are both fixative agents that can be harmful by inhalation and contact. Perform the fixation step on a fume hood and wear adequate protective clothing and nitrile gloves. All solutions from this step onwards, including alcohol series until 70%, should be stored for later decontamination by specialized staff.\nAfter gathering all the samples, refresh the fixative.",
    "Transfer the vials to a vacuum chamber, and slowly apply vacuum. Upon reaching -60 kPa, the floating material will start to sink to the bottom of the vial (Figure 1B).\nKeep under a vacuum of no more than -80 kPa for 2 h at room temperature.\nSlowly release the vacuum, seal the glass vial and place overnight at 4 °C.\nDiscard any samples that did not sink during the overnight fixation. Wash the remaining samples with 25 mM PBS pH 7 for 10 min, followed by a 20 min wash in 25 mM PIPES buffer pH 7.2.\nDehydrate the samples in an ethanol series (25%, 35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 3x 100% ethanol) for 20 min each. Immediately transfer the dehydrated samples to labeled glass vials for embedding (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: The dehydration process can be paused at the 70% ethanol step.\nLR-White resin embedding\n\tNOTE: LR-white is a non-hydrophobic acrylic resin with low viscosity, making it ideal for penetrating tissues with many thick cell walls layers. LR-White also comes in several hardness grades compatible for cutting most plant samples. Please do make sure that the used resin is already supplied with the proper catalyst mixed in, or follow the supplier instructions to prepare the resin. The following embedding process is slow but the results justify greatly the means.\n\t\nPerfuse the samples by incubating with the LR-White resin in a series of crescent concentration of resin (1:3, 2:3, 1:1, 3:2, 3:1, 1:0) in ethanol, incubating for 24 h at 4 °C in each step.\n\t\tCAUTION: LR-White resin is a low toxicity acrylic resin; however, it may be an irritant to the skin by contact and inhalation. Working in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood with appropriate protective wear and nitrile gloves is highly recommended.",
    "Refresh the LR-white resin and incubate for an additional 12 h at 4 °C.\nPrepare appropriate size embedding gelatin capsules (size 1 (0.5 mL) for samples up to 3 mm, 2 x 0.37 mL for samples up to 5 mm or 3 x 0.3 mL for samples up to 8 mm, and paper tags (Figure 1D).\n\t\tNOTE: Select the capsule size to be slightly larger than the sample, so that the specimen can be completely enclosed in the resin. Also, remember to label the tags with a pencil, because pen or printed inks will contaminate the resin, ruining the sample.\nApply one drop of fresh LR-white resin to the bottom of each capsule.\nPlace a sample in each gelatin capsule and fill to maximum capacity with fresh resin. Place the capsule cap and press gently to form a hermetic seal (Figure 1E).\nPolymerize the resin for 24 to 48 h at 58 °C, or until fully hardened.\nStore samples at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Post polymerization LR-white resin is inert.\n2. Slide preparation\nNOTE: Glass slides must be clean, free of any dust, grease or any other contaminants. Even new slides must be cleaned as some suppliers use oils and detergents to prevent the slides from sticking together. Any grease or detergent will interfere with the section adhesion to the slide, even if treated with poly-L-lysine. Lint and dust will affect the specimen’s observations and very possibly ruin the experiment. Teflon coated slides with reaction wells are perfect for this task. They are affordable, reusable and drastically reduce the amount of antibody solution needed. With proper cleaning, excellent quality fluorescent immunolocalization can be performed at a very affordable cost.\nSlide washing",
    "Place the slides in a staining rack and cover with cleaning solution (0.1% SDS (w/v), 1% acetic acid (v/v), 10% ethanol (v/v)).\nMaintain a mild agitation for 20 min.\nTransfer the staining racks to a ddH2O bath with mild agitation for 10 min. Repeat 4 times.\nCarefully drain the racks before dipping briefly in 100% ethanol and let the slides dry in a dust-free environment.\nStore until use.\nPoly-L-lysine coating (optional)\n\tNOTE: Small sections usually stick very well to clean glass slides. This step is only recommendable for larger sections (>2 mm2). Larger sections tend to fold and wrinkle, and are not advisable. Nevertheless, if needed use reaction slides with larger holes. Clean them as above and proceed as follows.\n\t\nPlace clean slides in a square Petri dish. Pipette 0.001% poly-L-lysine solution (w/v) to cover the holes of the slides, without overflowing.\nLet the slides dry overnight at 40 °C in closed Petri dishes.\n\t\tNOTE: The coated slides are ready for immediate use and can be stored in a dust free environment at room temperature, for several months.\n3. Sample trimming and sectioning\nSample trimming\nWith a sharp razor blade, trim the LR-White blocks under a stereomicroscope to form a pyramid shaped structure where the apex is perpendicular to the area of interest of the sample (Supplemental Figure 1A).\n\t\tNOTE: The ultra-microtome specimen holder is an excellent tool to secure the block. If the device does not have a universal specimen holder, use the one most fit for round blocks.\nTrim the pyramidal structure by removing fine slices of the excess resin perpendicularly to the pyramid major axis.\nProceed until the sample is reached forming the cutting surface. Within the cutting surface, the target sample should ideally be enclosed in a trapezoid shape.",
    "NOTE: The resin block can be further trimmed at a slit angle to reduce the section surface area with a sharp blade (Figure 1F).\nSemi-thin sectioning\n\tNOTE: A microtome with glass knives will be used. The ability of the antibody to bind to the epitope will condition the immunolabeling reaction success. The hydrophilic nature of the LR-White resin will allow for good contact of the antibodies with the sample sections. Thinner sections will present fainter Calcofluor coloration that will be used to help locate the sections and assist with the imaging process. The same holds true for other stains that may later be applied. Also excessive thickness will affect image acquisition quality. A good compromise for section thickness can be found between 200 and 700 nm, depending on the tissue characteristics. Mount the blocks tightly on the specimen holder of the ultra-microtome.\n\t\nWith an ultra-microtome, make sections with a thickness between 200 and 700 nm (Figure 1G).\nCheck the section area by transferring some sections to a ddH2O drop on a glass slide. Place the slide on a 50 °C hot plate until water evaporates. Stain placing a drop of 1% Toluidine Blue O (w/v) in 1% boric acid solution (w/v) over the sections for 30 s. Rinse and observe under the microscope.\nUpon finding the desired structure, transfer one or two sections to each drop of ddH2O previously placed on each well of a clean reaction slide.\nPlace each slide in a closed clean 10 cm square petri dish and let it dry at 50 °C.\nStore slides in a clean archive box until use.\n4. Immunolocalization",
    "NOTE: The fluorescent immunolocalization procedure relies on sequential use of two antibodies. The primary antibody is raised against a specific target antigen. The secondary antibody is raised specifically against the primary antibody and for fluorescent techniques is conjugated to a fluorophore (FITC in this specific protocol). The primary antibody will be used to detect the target antigen in the sample, and the secondary antibody will be used to mark the location where the primary antibody connected to the sample after washing off the excess of primary antibody. Controls are an important part of this assay and must always be performed to insure the accuracy of the observations. One well on the slide should be reserved for use as a negative control, where the primary antibody treatment will be skipped, and therefore no signal should be observed at the end of the experiment. A positive control must be included in the experiment by treating one well with an antibody which labelling is already known and certain. The positive control is used to confirm the secondary antibody labelling effectiveness and reaction conditions while the negative control tests the secondary antibody specificity.\nPrepare an incubation chamber by placing some damped paper towels at the bottom of a pipette tips box and wrapping it with tin foil (Supplemental Figure 1B-1E). Place the slides in the incubation chamber.\nPipette a 50 μL drop per 8 mm well of blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in 1 M PBS) and incubate for 10 min. Remove the blocking solution and wash all wells twice with PBS for 10 min.\nPrepare the primary antibody solutions (see Supplemental Table 1), 1:5 (v/v) antibody in blocking solution; make an estimate of about 40 μL per 8 mm well.",
    "NOTE: The concentration of the antibody must be adjusted according to the manufacture’s protocol.\nPerform a final wash with ddH2O for 5 min, never let the wells dry completely.\nPipette the primary antibody solution to the reaction wells. Pipette blocking solution to the control wells.\nClose the incubation chamber and let stand for 2 h at room temperature followed by overnight at 4 °C. Prepare the secondary antibody solution, 1% in blocking solution (v/v) about 40 μL per well. Keep it covered with tin foil.\nWash all wells twice with PBS for 10 min, followed by 10 additional minutes with ddH2O. Make sure that no trace of the blocking solution or deposits is visible on the wells.\nPipette the secondary antibody solution to all wells. From now on, protect the slides from light.\nIncubate for 3–4 h in the dark at room temperature.\nWash all wells twice for 10 min with PBS followed by another wash of 10 min with ddH2O.\nApply a drop of calcofluor (1:10,000 (w/v) fluorescent brighter 28 in PBS) to each well. Without washing, apply a drop of mounting medium (see Table of Materials) to each well and place a coverslip (Figure 1H).\nObserve with a fluorescence microscope, equipped with 10x/0.45, 20x/0.75, 40x/0.95 and 100x/1.40 lens, use UV (for calcofluor stain) and FITC filters, to detect cell wall and immunolocalization respectively (Figure 1I). Use the following wavelengths: excitation/emission (nm) 358/461 for UV and 485/530 for FITC.\nFor a better visualization of the results overlap both images with ImageJ or similar.\nSubscription Required.
