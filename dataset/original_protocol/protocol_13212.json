    "The in vivo experiments were done in accordance with the guidelines and protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of SingHealth (IACUC) and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the use of animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.\n1. Preparation of Day 32 hESC-derived photoreceptor progenitors after cryopreservation\nPre-warm photoreceptor differentiation medium (PRDM) in a 37 °C water bath.\nRetrieve a cryovial containing day 32 hESC-derived photoreceptor progenitor cells from liquid nitrogen. Keep on dry ice.\nThaw the cryovial at 37 °C in a water bath for 3-5 min. Resuspend the day 32 cells in 1 mL of PRDM and centrifuge at 130 x g for 4 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL of PRDM.\nRemove 10 µL of the mixture for cell counting. Mix cells using 0.2% trypan blue according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pipette cell mixture into the cell counting chamber slide. Determine cell number and viability by automated cell counter.\nProceed to the next step when the cell viability is above 70%. Centrifuge the remaining cell suspension at 130 x g for 4 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in PRDM at the concentration of 3 x 105 cells/µL for transplantation.\nObserve for visible cell clumps. Resuspend cell clumps repeatedly using a 10 µL pipette tip in the microfuge tube until no visible cell clump is observed. Load into the 33G injection syringe to observe for extrusion of cell solution through the needle.\n2. Sub-retinal delivery of the hESCs in rd10 mice\nPreparation of the animals\n\t\nAnaesthetize the mouse (P20, male/female, 3-6 g) using a combination of ketamine (20 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (2 mg/kg body weight) in a 1 mL tuberculin syringe attached to a 27G needle by intraperitoneal approach.",
    "After administering the anesthesia, instill a drop each of 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine for pupil dilation. Apply an ophthalmic gel to the cornea to prevent the eye from dryness and anesthesia-related cataract.\nPlace the mouse in a warm empty cage until fully anesthetized. Assess the proper anesthetic level by pinching the paw pad and confirm if the animal does not react to the hard pinch.\nSub-retinal delivery of the cells\n\t\nTo use a 1-port trans-vitreal pars plana approach, as done here, perform sub-retinal injection in a sterile environment. Use an upright operating microscope with a direct light path to perform the injection.\nPrepare the 10 µL glass syringe by removing the needle hub. Mount the 33G blunt needle onto the glass syringe. Take the metal hub cover and carefully secure the needle on the syringe.\nFlush with distilled water to check for any signs of leakage and patency of the needle. Empty the syringe and put it at the side carefully.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on a pillow, with the treatment eye looking up straight to the objective of the microscope. Apply the 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride and wait for 15 s. Apply 150 µL of ophthalmic gel on the eye and place a round cover slip on it.\nPerform a rough examination of the eye by observing the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, and conjunctiva. Through the pupil, visualize the fundus of the mouse eye by adjusting the focal plane. Adjust the head until the optic head is positioned at the center of the pupil and minimize the movement of the head by proper positioning on the pillow.",
    "Gently tap the base of the tube with the hESCs multiple times to get a uniform cell suspension. By using the 10 µL glass microliter syringe with a 33G blunt needle, withdraw 2 µL of cells/media. Withdraw the cells right before the injection to avoid cell settlement/clumping in the syringe.\nUsing a 30G disposable needle, make a sclerectomy wound 2 mm behind the limbus. Keep the angle of the needle at ~45° to avoid touching the lens. Once the tip of the needle is visualized in the eye, gently withdraw the needle. Discard the needle into the sharp bin after use to avoid needle prick injury.\nTake the glass syringe and insert the blunt needle into the sclerectomy wound. Without touching the lens, advance the blunt needle until it reaches the opposite retina of the entry wound. Ensure the injection area is clear of major retinal blood vessels to avoid bleeding.\nGently penetrate the retina until a pressure branch on the sclera is seen. Keep the blunt end of the needle parallel to the sclera to avoid leaking of the cells into the vitreous space.\nSlowly inject 2 µL of cell suspension or PRDM media (control) into the sub-retinal space while gentle pressure is maintained on the syringe. With a successful injection, a visible bleb (i.e., raised retina with the cell suspension/media in it) should be formed at the injection site.\n\t\tNOTE: Only gentle pressure should be used during injection to avoid retina tearing and blockage of the cells at the needle tip.\nAfter confirming the bleb, wait for 10 s to let the cells settle down. Gently retract the needle from the eye.\nIntraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning of the bleb (optional)",
    "Position the mouse eye to visualize the bleb under the microscope by slowly moving the head. Secure the position by gently holding the head. No additional pupil dilation is necessary. Do not remove the cover slip and the gel on the eye. It gives a clear optical media to visualize the bleb.\nPerform the intra-operative OCT using the built-in iOCT function of the operating microscope.\nPress the Cube option on the OCT screen and position the scanning area on the bleb by pressing the Arrow buttons. Adjust the OCT by sliding Centering and Focus for the best OCT quality. Press Capture/Scan to acquire the OCT scan of the bleb area. Review the images to check the quality of the scans.\nRecovery\n\t\nRemove the cover slip and clean the gel from the eye with gauze. Apply antibiotic ointment one time after the injection to prevent infection.\nAllow the animal to recover from anesthesia under a warm light until they regain sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency and return to the home cage. Monitor the animal for at least 3 days post-injection for signs of inflammation, infection, and distress.\nIf the animal is in pain, administer a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg). If inflammation or infection of the eye is observed, apply tobramycin or tobramycin/dexamethasone ointment 3x a day for 5 days.\nCleaning and sterilization of the instruments\n\t\nFlush the 10 µL glass microliter syringe and the 33G blunt needle with 100% ethanol 10x. Wash away the ethanol by flashing the syringe with distilled water.\nDissemble the glass syringe and the needle. Dry the syringe for storage.\nSubscription Required.
