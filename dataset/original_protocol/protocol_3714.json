    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1: Cell fixation\nTiming: approximately 4–6 h\nThe subsequent steps describe a general overview of the growth and fixation of bacterial and archaeal cultures.\nGrow bacterial or archaeal culture in an appropriate medium and at the required temperature until you have a total of ~1 × 108 cells growing in the exponential growth phase.\nNote: For E. coli, Hbt. salinarum, H. volcanii, and T. kodakarensis we usean OD600nm of ~0.2 – 0.25, but this can be adjusted for other growth phases, whilst maintaining of ~1 × 108 cells. Note that trial and error will be needed for species requiring specific growth conditions. For instance, for hyperthermophile archaea crosslinking cannot be performed at high temperatures, and those cells will have to be cooled down immediately prior to fixation (see Cockram et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Takemata et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). We recommend paying attention to this step, as it is a crucial one with respect to the quality of the resulting data.\nCrosslink protein-DNA interactions by adding fresh formaldehyde (3% final concentration)\nIncubate for 30 min at 19°C–23°C on an orbital shaker (50–100 rpm).\nCritical: Always use fresh formaldehyde for crosslinking.\nOptional: Crosslinking can also be performed using a magnetic stirrer.\nCritical: When crosslinking thermophilic organisms, such as the Euryarchaeota T. kodakarensis, we recommend mixing 20 mL of the cell culture with 80 mL of room temperature formaldehyde (19°C–23°C) diluted in 1 X PBS (4% final concentration, Cockram et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) see also (Takemata et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nQuench formaldehyde by adding glycine (0.5 M final concentration).\nIncubate for 20 min at 19°C–23°C on an orbital shaker (50–100 rpm).",
    "Critical: When working with halophilic organisms, such as the Euryarchaeota H. volcanii, which are very sensitive to salt concentrations, we recommend preparing 2.5M glycine in 18% (w/v) saltwater solution (Cockram et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nTransfer culture to a sterile centrifuge tube and collect cells by centrifugation (4000.× g, 10 min, at 19°C–23°C).\nDecant supernatant.\nCritical: Depending on the bacterial or archaeal species, pellets can be unstable and the supernatant may need to be removed by careful pipetting.\nCarefully resuspend the cell pellet in 25 mL of 1× PBS by gentle pipetting and transfer to a 50 mL conical tube.\nCollect cells by centrifugation (4000×g, 10 min at 19°C–23°C).\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 1× PBS by gentle pipetting. Transfer to a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge again (4000 × g, 5 min at 19°C–23°C).\nCarefully remove the supernatant using a pipette, so that the pellet is as dry as possible.\nStore the cell pellet at −80°C.\nPause Point: Pellets can be stored for at least 2 years at −80°C with no impact on the quality of the subsequent Hi-C library.\nDay 2: Hi-C library construction\nTiming: approximately 7 h\nRemove the cell pellet from the −80°C freezer and place on ice until completely thawed.\nGently resuspend the pellet by pipetting in 1.2 mL of 1× TE containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail.\nTransfer to a 2 mL VK05 Precellys tube.\nLyse cells using the Precellys Evolution tissue homogenizer (V7500: 5 × 30 s, 20 s pause).\nNote: For Precellys machines without the Cryolys cooling attachment, the program is: V6700: 9 × 20s, (30s pause). Tubes should be removed every 3 cycles and placed on ice for 5 min to prevent sample degradation from overheating.",
    "Critical: For Gram-negative species, such as E. coli, lysis can also be performed by incubating the cells with lysozyme (0.4 μg/mL final concentration) for 30 min at 37°C. This will produce similar results to mechanical disruption. However, formaldehyde-crosslinked Gram-positive bacteria, such as B. subtilis, can be difficult to lyse with lysozyme and the enzyme is inactive on archaea, since they do not contain peptidoglycan in their cell walls. In such cases, we recommend either disrupting cells with glass beads or a French Press (Marbouty et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nTransfer the lysate (~1 mL in volume) to a 5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Take care not to transfer any of the glass beads.\nAdd 50 μL of 10% SDS solution (0.5% final concentration) and incubate for 10 min at 19°C–23°C.\nPrepare the Digestion Mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_640_13.csv\nNote: If processing multiple samples, we recommend preparing a master mix.\nAdd the Digestion Mix to the tube containing the lysate and mix well by pipetting.\nRemove 400 μL of the sample and transfer it to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: This is the non-digested (ND) control to check for sample degradation and should be stored on ice until required (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/640-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Expected results from each step of the Hi-C and sequencing library preparation",
    "Representative image from the preparation of an E. coli Hi-C bank and subsequent sequencing library. The non-digested (ND) sample is a control for degradation during the cell lysis and restriction digest steps of the Hi-C library preparation. Following digestion, an aliquot is taken (D) to check for efficient cutting of genomic DNA by the restriction enzyme (D). The DNA is then subject to end-filling with a biotinylated nucleotide and blunt-end ligation, the efficiency of these steps can be determined by the checking that the DNA smear seen in the digested control has shifted higher molecular weight in the Ligation (L) control. Following reverse crosslinking and DNA purification, the DNA is sonicated to yield an average fragment size of 300 bp (S). The Hi-C library is then prepared for Illumina sequencing, with the size and quality of final library (FL) then checked before paired-end sequencing.\nAdd 1000U of restriction enzyme to the remaining sample and incubate at 37°C for 3 h in a shaking incubator (~180 rpm).\nFollowing digestion, remove 400 μL of the sample and transfer it to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: This is the digested (D) control to check for efficient cutting of the genomic DNA. Store on ice until required (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPellet the insoluble fraction by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min at 19°C–23°C).\nNote: This pellet contains protein-DNA complexes of interest\nDecant the supernatant.\nCarefully resuspend the pellet in 400 μL of dH2O by pipetting.\nNote: Depending on the species, this pellet can be quite difficult to resuspend. Ensure it is fully resuspended before continuing.\nPrepare the Biotinylation mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_640_14.csv\nNote: If processing multiple samples, we recommend preparing a master mix.",
    "Note: If using MluCI for the digestion, exchange Biotin-14-dCTP for Biotin-14-dATP and replace the 10 mM dAGTTP mix with 10 mM dCGTTP mix.\nAdd the Biotinylation mix to the resuspended pellet and mix by pipetting\nIncubate at 37°C for 45 min in a shaking incubator (~180 rpm).\nPrepare the ligation mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_640_15.csv\nNote: If processing multiple samples, we recommend preparing a master mix.\nAdd ligation mix to the reaction and mix by pipetting.\nIncubate with gentle agitation for 3 h at 19°C–23°C.\nFollowing ligation, add 20 μL 500 mM EDTA, 80 μL 10% SDS, and 100 μL 20 mg/mL proteinase K to the Hi-C library.\nRemove the ND and D controls from ice and add 20 μL 500 mM EDTA, 20 μL 10% SDS, and 10 μL 20 mg/mL proteinase K.\nIncubate the Hi-C library, ND and D controls overnight (10–12 h) at 65°C to reverse formaldehyde-mediated protein-DNA crosslinks.\nNote: we processed indiscriminately bacteria and archaea cells at this step, regardless of their normal growth condition.\nDay 3: DNA purification and sequencing library preparation\nTiming: approximately 6 h\nPurification of DNA by phenol extraction\nTiming: approximately 1 h\nAdd an equal volume (~1.2 mL) of Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol to the Hi-C sample and vortex for 30 s.\nCritical: Always handle phenol under the hood, as it causes severe burns and eye damage and is toxic if inhaled or ingested.\nCentrifuge (12,000 × g, 5 min at 19°C–23°C).\nCarefully remove the upper aqueous phase (~1.2 mL) and transfer to a new 5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nPrecipitate DNA by adding 2.5× volume (~3 mL) of ice-cold 100% EtOH and 1/10 volume (~ 120 μL) of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.0).",
    "Precipitate DNA of ND and D controls by adding 2.5× volume (~1 mL) of ice-cold 100% EtOH and 1/10 volume (~ 40 μL) of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.0).\nNote: to reduce the amount of phenol chloroform used, we proceed straight to ethanol precipitation for the ND and D controls.\nIncubate all samples at −80°C for 30 min.\nPellet DNA by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C).\nCarefully remove supernatant using a pipette\nWash pellets with 500 μL of ice-cold 70% EtOH.\nPellet DNA by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C).\nRemove EtOH and dry pellets on a 37°C heat block for 5–10 min.\nNote: Briefly centrifuge (~10 sec) after removing the ethanol to collect any residual EtOH on the side of the tube.\nAdd 140 μL 1× TE buffer containing 1 mg/mL RNase to pellets and incubate for 15–30 min at 37°C in a shaking incubator (~180 rpm).\nSample 10 μL for the ligation (L) control (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nRun 10 μL of the Hi-C library and 10 μL of the ND, D and L controls on a 1% agarose gel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCritical: These controls are important for determining that the Hi-C library construction was successful.\nDiscard ND and D controls.\nPause Point: Hi-C library can be stored at −20°C.\nSonication and size-selection of DNA\nTiming: approximately 45 min\nTransfer 130 μL of DNA to a Covaris microtube.",
    "Note: We recommend a maximum of 5 μg of DNA is used for sonication (as determined by Qubit analysis). Samples that have less DNA are OK, but if the Hi-C library exceeds 5 μg, then an aliquot should be taken and the remaining DNA stored at −20°C, as a backup. Once the correct quantity of DNA is obtained, the sample volume should be adjusted to 130 μL using 1× TE buffer.\nSonicate DNA using a Covaris S220 machine and the following parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_640_16.csv\nNote: These parameters will generate a fragment size of ~300 bp.\nTransfer sheared DNA to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd an equal volume of AMPure XP beads.\nMix sample 10× by gentle pipetting.\nIncubate for 5 min at 19°C–23°C to allow DNA fragments to bind to the magnetic beads.\nTransfer tube to a magnetic rack to allow the beads to separate to the side of the tube (~ 1 min).\nCarefully remove the supernatant and wash with 70% EtOH, keeping the tube on the magnet and ensuring that the beads are not disturbed.\nRepeat step h.\nRemove the EtOH, and airdry the pellet for 2 min to remove residual EtOH.\nCritical: do not allow the pellet to over-dry as this will reduce the elution efficiency.\nRemove beads from the magnet and resuspend in 320 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).\nMix sample 10× by gentle pipetting.\nIncubate for 5 min at 19°C–23°C and then place back onto the magnetic rack for 1 min.\nCarefully remove supernatant and transfer to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCheck sonication and size-selection by running 18 μL of the DNA on a 1% agarose gel (sonication control (S), troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nThe remaining 300 μL is used to prepare the sequencing library.",
