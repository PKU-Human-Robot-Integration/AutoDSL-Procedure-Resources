    "1. Preparation of Reagents\nDissolve the synthetic progestagen promegestone (R5020) and 17-β-estradiol (E2) in ethanol to make 10-3 M stock solutions. Dissolve prolactin in distilled deionized water to make a 1 mg/ml stock solution. Dissolve the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 in DMSO to make a 10-2M stock solution. Store these solutions at -20 ° C for up to 6 months.\nCharcoal dextran (CD) stripped serum and CDFBS medium:\n\t\nHeat-inactivate fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 57 °C water bath for 30 min.\n\t\tNote: Use only acid-washed glassware for the remainder of this protocol.\nCalculate the amount of charcoal needed. Using 10% more volume than the amount of serum to compensate for the displacement caused by the charcoal, weigh 5% wt/vol activated powdered charcoal.\nWash charcoal twice with cold deionized distilled water using the same volume as the amount of serum. For each wash centrifuge at 50 x g for 2 min to pellet the charcoal. Remove the water between washes. Add 0.5% wt/vol Dextran T-70 to the last charcoal pellet. Re-suspend with distilled, deionized water and centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the water.\nAdd the appropriate volume of serum to the pellet and re-suspend the charcoal dextran pellet into the serum. Incubate, while rolling (6 RPM), at 37 ºC for 60 min. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 20 min. If supernatant appears cloudy, repeat centrifugation; however, serum may not be completely clear at this time but will be cleared during filtration.\nFilter through a 0.80 micron filter and then again through a 0.45 micron filter to remove larger particulate matter. Finally, filter-sterilize with a 0.20 micron filter. Store filtered CDFBS in glass tubes or T-25 culture flasks at -20 ºC.",
    "Charcoal Dextran Stripped Fetal Bovine-containing media (CDFBS media): mix 375 ml of phenol red-free DMEM and 125 ml of DMEM/F-12. Remove 37.5 ml and replace it with the same volume of Charcoal Dextran Stripped Fetal Bovine serum. Add 106 U/ml penicillin and L-glutamine to a 2 mM final concentration. The resulting media is 75% DMEM, 25% DMEM/F-12, 7.5% Charcoal dextran stripped-FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, and 106 U/ml penicillin.\nPrepare 10X PBS, 1N NaOH and distilled deionized water. Prepare enough volume of each according to the volume of collagen solution needed. Sterilize all solutions by filtering. Store the 10x PBS and sterile distilled deionized water at 4 ° C for up to 1 month. Do not store the 1N NaOH solution.\nPrepare collagen solution at a 1 mg/ml final concentration according to the protocol for \"Alternate Gelation Procedure for Collagen I, Rat tail\" provided by the manufacturer. Each gel is made of 1.5 ml of collagen solution. For example, prepare 18.5 ml (0.5 ml to account for loss during pipetting) of collagen solution to prepare 12 gels. Use the collagen solution immediately or hold on ice for up to 2-3 hr.\nCarmine Alum dye:\n\t\nCombine 1 g Carmine and 2.5 g Aluminum potassium sulfate in 500 ml distilled water. Boil while stirring for 20 min. Watch carefully to avoid boiling over. Adjust final volume back to 500 ml with additional distilled water.\nAdd a crystal of thymol for antimicrobial activity and cover bottle with aluminum foil to protect from light. Filter through a laboratory grade paper filter before each use. Reuse the carmine solution for up to three months. Store at RT, protected from light.\nCollagenase solution: dissolve the collagenase in DMEM/F12 medium at a concentration of 0.125% w/v. Do not store this solution.",
    "2. 3D Culture of T47D Cells in Rat Tail Collagen Type 1 Gels and Hormone Treatment\nNote: keep sterile serological pipettes and pipette tips at 4 °C.\nPrepare a single-cell suspension and perform a cell count. Split T47D cell cultures before they reach 70% confluence. Centrifuge the volume that contains the amount of cells needed. Consider that one gel should contain about 75,000 T47D cells.\nUsing a cold-pipette, re-suspend the cell pellet in the appropriate volume of collagen. Consider that each gel is made up of 1.5 ml of collagen. Mix the cells and the collagen gently to avoid introducing bubbles.\nTo prevent the effect of static electricity on cell distribution, brush the borders, top and bottom of the 12-well plate with a static-reducing brush after unwrapping the plate. To avoid static charge buildup during contact with the working surface of the hood, place this plate on top of another 12-well plate (blank plate) that has also been brushed with the static-reducing brush.Gently, pour 1.5 ml of the mix into each well of the 12-well plate.\nPlace the plate in an incubator at 37 °C for 30 min. Remove the plate from the incubator and place it back in the hood.\nUsing a p200 sterile tip, carefully detach the gel in a gentle circular motion from the border of the well. The gel should also detach from the bottom of the well.",
    "Dilute hormones in CDFBS media to be added to the wells. Use E2 and R5020 at a 10 -10 M final concentration and prolactin at a at 10-7 M final concentration. As control, use CDFBS media without hormones added but still containing the highest volume of DMSO equal to the hormone stocks used. Ensure that each well contains 1.5 ml of media. Place the 3D cultures inside a 37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% humidity tissue culture incubator. Maintain the cultures for 1 or 2 weeks, changing the media every 2 days.\n3. Gel Processing for Whole Mounts\nRemove culture media and add 1.5 ml of PBS to each well.\nTransfer the gel to a slide. Cut the gel in half using a curved surgical blade. Continue processing with one half and save the other half for histological analysis.\nTransfer the half gel for whole mount to a slide. Let gel dry for 5 min and then transfer the slide to a coplin jar containing 10% formalin.\n\tNote: all incubations should be done at RT.\nFix gels in a coplin jar on a shaker O/N.\nWash slides twice with PBS for 10 min each on shaker. Transfer slides to 70% EtOH; incubate for 1 hr on shaker. Transfer slides to Carmine Alum O/N.\nThe next day, dehydrate slides on shaker in 70% EtOH, 95% EtOH and 100% EtOH for 1 hr each. Transfer slides to xylene twice for 1 hr each and keep on shaker. Use toluene-based mounting medium to mount the gels and 1.5 mm thick coverslips.\nExamine whole mounts under regular light (microscope or stereoscope). For a more detailed analysis of shape and lumen use confocal microscopy and visualize Carmine dye with HeNE 633 nm laser.\n4. Gel Processing for Processing for Histology Analysis",
    "Transfer the remaining half of the gel to a 20 ml glass vial containing 10% formalin and fix on shaker O/N.\nWash gels twice with PBS for 10 min each on shaker. Place gels into processing cassettes for paraffin embedding.\nTransfer gels to 70% EtOH, incubate for 1 hr and follow with 95% EtOH for 1 hr, change to fresh 95% EtOH for 1 hr, 100% EtOH for 1 hr, and change to fresh 100% EtOH for 1 hr. At this point, gels may be stored in 100% EtOH O/N at RT or incubated with xylene for 1 hr and then again in fresh xylene for 1 hr.\nTransfer cassettes to paraffin for 1 hr at 60 °C in vacuum incubator, repeat with fresh paraffin twice more.\nFill plastic molds with clean paraffin. Open the cassette, remove the gel and place it in the plastic mold containing paraffin. Fill up with paraffin and add top of cassette containing the label on top and let block cool.\nRemove the plastic mold and section the block using a microtome. Obtain 5 um thick sections for H-E staining and immunocytochemistry.\n5. Extraction of Cells from Cells from Gels Using Collagenase Treatment\nRemove gel from the well and transfer it to a petri dish containing PBS. Rinse gel briefly.\nTransfer the gel to a 15 ml tube containing 2 ml of 0.125% collagenase. Pipette up and down 4-5 times in order to break the gel into small pieces.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 25 min (until gel has dissolved and cells are in suspension)\nAdd 2 ml of serum supplemented culture medium. Collect cells by centrifugation (1,000 x g, 5 min), discard supernatant, re-suspend cells and count.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
