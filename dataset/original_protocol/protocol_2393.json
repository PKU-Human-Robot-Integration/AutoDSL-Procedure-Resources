Tissue quality control process\n(A) For each frozen melanoma sample, a section is used to establish the RNA quality by defining it’s RIN number.\n(B) Samples with satisfactory RNA quality are then screened based on their tissue integrity and structure with H&E staining and whole tissue imaging.\n(C) For selected samples, we established a “GPS” slide. Mapping the CD14+ and CD3+ infiltrate in the tissue. The GPS slide is then used to guide the LCM harvest allowing to identify most suitable region of interest quickly and efficiently for the harvest.

    "Note: The sample quality control is not mandatory to perform the LCM harvest per se but we found that screening samples and selecting only the ones with high RNA quality and no necrotic areas greatly increases the chances of getting high quality RNA sequencing from LCM harvested cells. The “GPS” slide, which consist of whole section scan after immunofluorescence staining plays several important roles. It helps selecting samples with sufficient numbers of specific cell types to be harvested (here intra tumoral CD14+ cells and stromal CD14+ cells). It also allowed to remove samples which were early melanoma metastasis to the lymph node and present only a minimal invasion by cancer cells. Finally, the “GPS” slide helps to guide the LCM operator during the harvest. The GPS slide can be displayed next to the LCM monitor and help the operator to quickly position the CapSure cap on best area of the tissue to harvest from, instead of browsing the entire slide, saving precious time, fluorescence signal and RNA quality in the process.\nLaser capture microdissection\nTiming: 65 min\nPerform IF staining under RNA preserving conditions and LCM harvest of three different populations.\nPower system on.\nPower Arcturus XT on.\nOpen Arcuturs software.\nPower Lumencor SPECTRA on.\nOpen LLE 7ch controller Lumencor software.\nPrepare stage for harvest.\nIn Arcturus select “present stage”.\nInstall the tray on LCM Cap sure.\nIndicate number of Cap present in tray, in the software.\nPerform IF staining for LCM.\nPlace sample in cryostat.\nLet sample reach chamber temperature for 10 min.\nCut a 5 μm section.\nTransfer immediately onto clean frosted supercharged glass slide.\nFix 2 min in cold acetone.\nAir dry 2 min.\nBack circle tissue with sharpie.\nPlace on cold block.\nPerform IF staining.\nWash 2 min with PBS + Superase in.",

    "Note: Due to RNA instability at 23C, the LCM harvest should be performed immediately after the IF staining and should not last longer than 30 min. The total number of cells that can be harvested during this time greatly depends on their abundance in the tissue, but it is routinely feasible to harvest around 50 cells per population (or per cap), with 3 different populations per harvest. In some cases, where the cells of interest are very abundant (cancer cells in a tumor or immune cells in tonsil) it is possible to harvest up to 200 cells per cap. Additionally, as stained tissues undergo dehydration step, it is important to select fluorochromes able to withstand incubations in ethanol and xylene. Here we used DAPI, AF488 and AF594 which have shown good stability. In addition, we found that DAPI can be replaced with an AF405 conjugated antibody, adding an extra marker to guide the LCM harvest instead of nuclear staining. In the absence of mounting media, photobleaching will occur much faster compared to conventional IF image acquisition.\nPause point: Material harvested by LCM is stable at -80C, once lysed. We recommend harvesting all cell types of interest across multiple tissue and store the lysates in the freezer to extract RNA and prepare libraries in batches.\nRNA purification and library preparation\nRNA purification.\nRNA extraction was following the manufacturer’s instructions of the PicoPure RNA isolation kit:\nhttps://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F1268200.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F1268200.pdf].\nDNase I treatment at 23C was included to remove contamination of genomic DNA.
