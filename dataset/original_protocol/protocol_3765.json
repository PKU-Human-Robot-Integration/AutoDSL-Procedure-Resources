A schematic of the protocol step by step\nIsolation of genomic DNA from FFPE sections\nTiming: 3–4 h\nA protocol modification of Qiagen QIAamp® DNA FFPE Tissue Kit is used to isolate genomic DNA from FFPE sections (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=67ecad65-5f6c-4559-ae24-b614180bfc4b&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=67ecad65-5f6c-4559-ae24-b614180bfc4b&lang=en]). This method provides a reproducible and consistent genomic DNA yield.\nNote: As starting material, we recommend using freshly cut FFPE sections with a minimum of paraffin around the samples. We recommend starting with 3-8 sections per sample, each with a thickness of 5 μm. As a maximum limit for one preparation do not exceed 8 sections with a thickness of 10 μm each and a surface area of 250 mm2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/688-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Isolation of genomic DNA from FFPE sections\nExample of FFPE sections used in the DNA extraction, and representative correlations between FFPE slice surface area and DNA yield obtained.\nNote: To preserve the C-circle telomeric DNA after genomic isolation, the samples should be stored at −80°C or in a −20°C freezer without a defrost cycle. Avoid multiple freeze/thaws or extended storage. During the processing, keep the samples on ice. Always use sterile disposable material and DNase-RNase free microtubes.\nDe-paraffinization of FFPE sections (all steps are performed at 20°C–25°C).\nPre-heat two thermomixer devices to 37°C and 56°C.\nReconstitute Buffer AW1 by adding 25 mL of ethanol (96%–100%) to the bottle containing 19 mL Buffer AW1 concentrate. Reconstitute Buffer AW2 by adding 30 mL of ethanol (96%–100%) to the bottle containing 13 mL Buffer AW2 concentrate. Mix reconstituted Buffer AW1 and AW2 by shaking. Equilibrate all the buffers at 20°C–23°C (∼15 min) and check for the presence of precipitate.",
    "Critical: Do not exceed the time samples are left in xylene as required by the protocol. If needed, perform sequential DNA isolation, and process a few samples at a time.\nAdd 1 mL of xylene to the 1.5 mL microtube containing the 3–8 FFPE sections (see section: before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]). Close the lid and vortex vigorously for 30 s.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000× g; 14,000 rpm) for 2.50 min at 20°C–23°C .\nCarefully remove the supernatant by pipetting without removing any of the pellets.\nAdd 1 mL of ethanol (96%–100%) to the pellet, and mix by vortexing for 30 s.\nNote: This step is essential to remove residual xylene from the sample.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000× g; 14,000 rpm) for 3 min at 20°C–23°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and any residual ethanol by pipetting, without removing any of the pellets.\nTo remove the residual ethanol, open the tube and incubate at 20°C–23°C or up to 37°C until residual ethanol has evaporated (∼10 min). Do not overdry the samples.\nWhen ethanol has evaporated, remove the samples and pre-heat the thermomixer devices to 90°C.\nLysis under denaturing conditions with proteinase K.\nResuspend the pellet in 180 μL Buffer ATL. Add 20 μL proteinase K, and mix by vortexing.\nIncubate at 56°C using a mixing frequency of 1400 rpm for 1 h until the sample has been completely lysed.\nFormalin crosslink reversal.\nIncubate at 90°C for 1 h.",
    "Note: The incubation step at elevated temperature after proteinase K digestion allows to partially remove formalin crosslinking of the released DNA and improve DNA yields. Do not exceed the recommended temperature and incubation time. The degree of DNA fragmentation depends on the type and age of the sample and the conditions used for fixation. As reported before, we recommend to use a fixation time of 16–24 h, and discard sections that are exposed to air.\nRNase treatment.\nSpin-down the 1.5 mL microtube for few s.\nAllow the sample to cool to 20°C–23°C (∼1–2 min) and add 2 μL of RNase A (100 mg/mL) and incubate for 2 min at 20°C–23°C.\nBinding of DNA to membrane.\nPremix in a 15 mL conical tube N ∗ 200 μL of Buffer AL and N ∗ 200 μL of ethanol (96%–100%), being N the number of samples.\nAdd 400 μL of Buffer AL+ethanol (96%–100%) mixture to the sample, and mix thoroughly by vortexing. A white precipitate may form on the addition of mixture Buffer AL and ethanol. The precipitate does not interefere with DNA extraction.\nSpin-down the 1.5 mL microtube for few seconds.\nCarefully transfer the entire lysate to the QIAamp MinElute column (in a 2 mL collection tube) without wetting the rim.\nCentrifuge at 6000× g (8000 rpm) for 1 min.\nNote: Take care when removing the QIAamp MinElute column and collection tube from the centrifuge, to avoid contact between QIAamp MinElute column and flow-through.\nPlace the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2 mL collection tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through. Check if the lysate has completely passed through the membrane after centrifugation, otherwise, centrifuge again until the QIAamp MinElute column is empty.\nAdd 500 μL of Buffer AW1 without wetting the rim.",
    "Centrifuge at 6000× g (8000 rpm) for 1 min.\nCarefully, place the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2 mL collection tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through.\nAdd 500 μL Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim.\nCentrifuge at 6000× g (8000 rpm) for 1 min.\nCarefully, place the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2 mL collection tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000× g; 14,000 rpm) for 3 min to completely dry the membrane and remove residual ethanol.\nDNA elution.\nPlace the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 1.5 mL microtube.\nAdd 23 μL of 10 mM Tris pH 7.6 (equilibrated at 20°C–23°C) to the center of the membrane to ensure complete elution of bound DNA.\nNote: Extracted DNA should be stored in a buffer, such as 10 mM Tris pH 7.6, to avoid acid hydrolysis. Purified water has a low buffering capacity and can significantly decrease the C-Circle template. The volume of elution buffer is according to the amount of starting material and the requirements of the downstream application.\nIncubate at 20°C–23°C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000× g; 14,000 rpm) for 1 min.\nTo increae DNA yield, repeat step ‘b-d’ using the eluate from step ‘d’. Reuse the collection tube from step ‘a’.\nTransfer the samples to ice before DNA quantification.\nQuantification of genomic DNA\nTiming: 1 h (for 20 samples)\nTo quantify DNA isolated from FFPE sections we use Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (https://www.thermofisher.Acom/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUXViaXQgZHNETkEgSFMgQXNzYXkgS2l0cw==[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUXViaXQgZHNETkEgSFMgQXNzYXkgS2l0cw==]).\nThe CCA signal is usually reported relative to the corresponding amount of genomic DNA. This method provides an accurate and reproducible DNA sample concentration from 10 pg/μL to 100 ng/μL. The assay is performed at 20°C–23°C, and the signal is stable for 3 h.",
    "Critical: DNA quantification should be performed at the same time for all the samples, this includes: Tumour and Normal FFPE tissue samples, ALT+ and ALT- control FFPE cells samples. Pipetting accuracy and significant temperature fluctuations within the laboratory can impair DNA quantification outcome. For this reason, we recommend performing a new calibration each time the instrument is used.\nNote: Optimal performance with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay can be obtained when all the solutions are equilibrated at 22–28˚C, as temperature fluctuations can influence the accuracy of the assay. We suggest not to hold the assay tubes in your hand before reading.\nPrepare Qubit working solution and assay tubes.\nSet up 1× 0.5 mL Qubit assay tubes per sample and 2× 0.5 mL Qubit assay tubes for standards.\nNote: Label only the lid of the tubes and not the side of the tube, as this could interfere with the sample reading.\nPrepare the Qubit working solution by diluting the Qubit dsDNA HS Reagent 1:200 in Qubit dsDNA HS Buffer in a plastic conical tube. To calculate the total volume of working solution, consider (N + 1) ∗ 200 μL, being N the number of samples, and 400 μL corresponding to standards.\nNote: Do not mix the working solution in a glass container. The final volume in each tube must be 200 μL. Each standard tube requires 190 μL of Qubit working solution plus 10 μL of each Qubit standard, and each sample tube requires from 180–199 μL of Qubit working solution plus 1–20 μL of sample.\nAdd 190 μL of Qubit® working solution to each of the tubes used for standards.\nAdd 10 μL of each Qubit standard to the appropriate tube (Standard # 1: 0 ng/μL; Standard # 2: 10 ng/μL) mix by vortexing 2–3 s without creating bubbles.",
    "Note: Carefully pipet exactly 10 μL of each Qubit standard.\nAdd 197 μL of Qubit working solution to individual assay tubes.\nAdd 3 μL of each sample to the assay tubes containing the volume of Qubit working solution, then mix by vortexing 2–3 s.\nIncubate the tubes at 20°C–23°C for 2 min.\nProceed to Qubit Fluorometers.\nOn the Home screen press “DNA”, select “dsDNA High Sensitivity”, select “Read standards”, select “Reading new standards”, press to proceed.\nInsert the tube containing Standard #1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, and then press “Read standard”. When the reading is complete, remove Standard #1.\nInsert the tube containing Standard #2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, and then press “Read standard”. When the reading is complete, remove Standard #2.\nThe instrument displays the results on the Read standard screen.\nProceed with samples reading, press “Run samples”.\nOn the assay screen, select the sample volume: 3 μL.\nSelect the units for the output sample concentration (ng/μL).\nInsert a sample tube into the sample chamber, close the lid, and then press “Read tube”. When the reading is complete, remove the sample tube.\nThe instrument displays the results; the top value is the concentration of the original sample (ng/μL). The bottom value is the dilution concentration. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nRepeat step ‘h’ until all samples have been read.\nPause Point: DNA could be stored at −80°C or in a −20°C freezer without a defrost cycle.\nRolling circle amplification\nTiming: 12 h",
    "The rolling circle amplification (RCA) step is an isothermal enzymatic process where the processive phi29 DNA polymerase uses partially single-stranded telomeric (CCCTAA)n DNA circles (C-circles) as a template and amplifies them to form a long single stranded DNA concatemers containing hundreds of tandem repeats that are complementary to the circular template. RCA followed by detection by telomere specific probes has been established as a linear quantitation of ALT activity (Henson et al 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The protocol described here has been adapted from (Henson et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: Starting material for RCA reactions can be as low as 20 ng, and we recommend no higher than 120 ng. To obtain reliable results, the same amount of genomic DNA/sample should be used. If you have no information about the nature of your starting material, start with 30 – 40 ng. If required, add a DNA pre-dilution step with 10 mM Tris pH 7.6 to obtain the desired DNA amount.\nCritical: Since tumour and normal tissue specimens can contain significant background signal, we recommend to include the following controls in each set of reactions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Specific background controls: run an RCA reaction in parallel to all the samples without phi29 polymerase. When insufficient tumor sample is available to allow two reactions/sample, this control can be omitted and the evaluation of C-circles level must be corrected for CCA loading control (refer to the section: Quantification and Statistical Analysis). Global background control: run a single RCA reaction where DNA is omitted. ALT positive and ALT negative controls: positive (U2OS) and negative (HeLa) controls should be included in each set of reactions (i.e., 30 ng).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/688-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative layout of a slot-blot",
    "Representative layout showing an example of how to load the samples on the slot blot. An internal reference of known ALT positive and ALT negative controls is included, as well as specific background controls, where RCA reaction without phi29 polymerase is loaded in parallel to all the samples, and a single global background control, where DNA is omitted from RCA reaction.\nNote: RCA preparation should be done on ice.\nPrepare RCA reaction.\nThaw Rolling Circle Master Mix (RCMM) and genomic DNA samples on ice.\nDilute desired concentration of genomic DNA (i.e., 30 ng) in a total volume of 10 μL with 10 mM Tris pH 7.6. Prepare two 0.2 mL PCR tubes per each sample.\nWhere N is number of samples:\nprepare RCMM without phi29 polymerase: aliquot N ∗ 10 μL ∗ 1.2 RCMM\nPrepare RCMM with phi29 polymerase: aliquot N ∗ 9.25 μL ∗ 1.2 RCMM, add N ∗ 0.75 μL ∗ 1.2 of phi29 polymerase.\nPipet 10 μL of RCMM (without phi29) to the first tube containing 10 μL genomic DNA sample.\nPipet 10 μL of RCMM (with phi29) to the second tube containing 10 μL genomic DNA sample.\nMix the resulting 20 μL RCA reactions by vortexing 5 s at 1800 rpm twice.\nMicrocentrifuge tubes for 10 s.\nIncubate RCA reactions in a thermocycler using the following incubation settings:\n30°C for 8 h\n70°C for 20 min\n10°C infinite hold\nPause Point: RCA reactions can be stored at −20°C for later use.\nTransfer of RCA products to the membrane\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step transfers RCA products to a membrane using a dot or slot-blot apparatus.",
    "Critical: Samples that will be directly compared (i.e., samples with and without phi29 polymerase, positive and negative controls) should be blotted in the same membrane (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). When we want to compare a cohort of samples larger than the ones a slot-blot membrane can fit, positive (U2OS) and negative (HeLa) controls should be included in each membrane so the signal of each specimen can be normalized relative to that of U2OS.\nNote: Manage the membrane with clean tweezers, do not touch with gloved hands.\nNote: Samples should be transferred for a native slot-blot, so RCA products can be detected. No denaturation step is needed, do not boil these samples before transferring to the membrane.\nTransfer RCA to Nylon positively charged membrane.\nPrepare a Nylon positively charged membrane and two sheets of Whatman 3 MM chromatography paper, cut so it fits the slot-blotting apparatus.\nSoak membrane in 2× SSC buffer for 5 min.\nWet Whatmann paper in 2× SSC buffer.\nIf RCA reactions were stored frozen, thaw on ice.\nAdd 150 μL 2× SSC to 20 μL RCA reactions.\nMix the resulting 170 μL RCA reactions by vortexing 5 s.\nMicrocentrifuge tubes for 10 s.\nAssemble slot-blot with two Whatman papers and membrane on top.\nNote: Ensure there are no air bubbles (can use a roller to remove bubbles). Do not allow the membrane to dry.\nScrew slot-blot apparatus tight and apply vacuum.\nWash membrane with 200 μL 2× SSC buffer per well and let run until wells empty.\nApply samples and let run until wells empty.\nWash membrane with 200 μL 2× SSC buffer per well and let run until wells empty.\nStop applying vacuum.\nDisassemble slot-blot apparatus. Place membrane, with DNA side facing upwards, onto a dry clean sheet of Whatman paper. Dry membrane for 5 min.",
    "Place the membrane in a 254 nm UV cross-linker. Cross-link DNA onto the membrane at a setting of 120 mJ/cm2. Flip the membrane (DNA side facing down) and repeat.\nPause Point: Membrane may be stored for later use. Protect the membrane in between 2 sheets of dry Whatman paper and store at 20°C–23°C.\nNon-radioactive detection of C-circle blotted products\nTiming: 48–72 h\nThe CCA products are detected by native slot-blot with DIG-labeled telomere probes and corrected for CCA loading control with a DIG-labeled probe for repetitive Alu elements (Batzer and Deininger 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). After hybridization, C-circles are detected with an anti-DIG-AP antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase which catalyzes the chemiluminescent reaction. Chemiluminescent alkaline phosphatase substrate (CDP-STAR) is used to detect the DIG signal in the slot-blot. The protocol described here has been adapted from (Kimura et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: The volume of solutions reported in the protocol are considered for a membrane sheet of approximately 11.9 × 7.8 cm. Scale the volumes accordingly to process membranes of different sizes.\nTo label the telomere and Alu oligonucleotides we use the DIG oligonucleotide 3’-end labeling kit, 2nd generation (Roche) (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Roche/Bulletin/1/03353575910bul.pdf[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Roche/Bulletin/1/03353575910bul.pdf]). This kit uses terminal transferase to enzymatically label oligonucleotides at their 3’ ends by incorporation of a single DIG-labeled dideoxyuridine-triphosphate (DIG-ddUTP).\nNote: After the labelling procedure, we recommend determining the labelling efficiency of the probe. This step is essential to calculate the correct amount of probe needed for the hybridization step (12.d).\nCritical: The kit (vial 1) contains potassium cacodylate that is toxic by inhalation and if swallowed. Use gloves when handling and discard according to regulation for toxic waste.\nLabeling of telomere and Alu probe and determination of labeling efficiency.\nAdd 100 pmol oligonucleotides in a DNase-RNase free PCR tube.",
    "Note: we suggest preparing 4 PCR tubes for each oligonucleotide and process in parallel so probe can be stored for later use.\nIn each PCR tube, add DNase-RNase free water to make a final volume of 10 μL.\nPlace the PCR tubes on ice and sequentially add: 4 μL of Reaction Buffer 5× (Vial 1). 4 μL of CoCl2 solution (Vial 2). 1 μL of DIG-ddUTP solution (Vial 3). 1 μL of Terminal transferase (400 U,Vial 4).\nMix with pipetting up and down and spin down.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min in a thermocycler, then keep on ice.\nAdd 2 μL of 0.2 M EDTA (pH 8) to stop the reaction.\nAdd 18 μL of DNase-RNase free water to dilute the labeled oligonucleotides to a concentration of 2.5 pmol/μL.\nPrepare serial dilution of labeled probes and labeled control oligonucleotides from the kit (Oligonucleotide, DIG-ddUTP labeled; Vial 6) from 1:1 to 1:1000.\nSpot 1 μL of each serial dilution/probe along serial dilution of control oligonucleotide DIG-ddUTP labeled on a Hybond N+ positively charged nylon membrane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/688-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Determination of probe labeling efficiency\n(A and B) (A) The 3’ DIG-labeled telomere (Telo) and Alu probes were synthesized from 100 pmol of template. Serial diluitions of each probe, were spotted on a Hybond N+ positively charged nylon membrane, besides the corresponding diluition of DIG-labeled control DNA (Co-oligo), used as a reference. The membrane was analyzed by direct detection procedure (B) followed by analysis of the relative intensities to calculate the amount of DIG labeled oligonucleotide in the sample probe preparation. Data are represented as mean +/- SD.",

Chemiluminescence detection, to develop the membrane and determine the probe efficiency.\nCompare the intensity of the probe spots to the intensity of control Oligonucleotide DIG-ddUTP labeled spots to determine the reach of full sensitivity (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Use the relative intensities to calculate the amount of DIG labeled oligonucleotide in the sample probe preparation needed for the hybridization step (12.d).\nStore labeled probes in 20 μL working aliquots at −20°C.\nHybridization of C-circle slot-blot membrane.\nPrepare 50 mL of prehybridization buffer and place it in a hybridization oven at 65°C to equilibrate.\nPlace the cross-linked membrane onto a nylon mesh and carefully place it in a hybridization tube with the DNA side inward.\nAdd 25 mL of prehybridization buffer and place in a rotating hybridization oven for 2 h at 65°C.\nNote: The optimal hybridization temperature is related to the GC content of the probe, homology of the probe to the target and hybridization buffer composition. If the alternative DIG Easy Hyb (Roche) or Standard Buffer containing 50% formamide are used, consider calculating an optimal hybridization temperature.\nPrepare hybridization solution by combining 25 mL of fresh pre-hybridization buffer with 20 μL of telomere DIG-3’end labeled probe (from a stock where probe efficiency was calculated as 2.5 pmol/μL).",
    "Equilibrate the hybridization solution in the hybridization oven at 65°C.\nNote: Concentration of 3’end labeled oligonucleotide probe in hybridization buffer is recommended between 1 – 10 pmol/mL, with a hybridization time between 6 h up to 18 h.\nDiscard prehybridization solution and add 25 mL of pre-equilibrated hybridization solution, place the tube with the membrane in a rotating hybridization oven, incubate ∼ 18–20 h at 65°C.\nChemiluminescence detection\nBefore you start, prepare 100 mL of blocking solution and allow to cool down to 20°C–23°C (∼15 min) before use.\nTransfer the membrane to a membrane-staining box and wash three times with 200 mL of Wash buffer 1 on a rotational shaker for 15 min.\nCarefully remove Wash buffer 1 and wash the membrane with 200 mL of 2× SSC for 20 min.\nPlace the membrane in a clean heat-sealable bag and add 60 mL of blocking buffer (20°C–23°C).

Acetate sheet or transparent film is preferable. During detection do not leave an excess of CDP-Star, as this can increase the background.\nNote: If the signal and the quality of images is low, the membrane can be re-incubated with CDP-Star solution for 1–2 h. The signal is stable for up to 24 h. Pay attention to completely cover the membrane with the CDP-Star substrate solution, a thin layer is enough.\nNote: Membranes should never be allowed to dry before stripping.\nPause Point: The membrane can be stored in AP buffer, at +4°C for 12–24 h before proceeding with membrane stripping and re-probing.\nMembrane stripping and re-probing.\nRinse membrane thoroughly twice in autoclaved ddH2O for 1 min.\nIncubate the membrane in 50 mM NaOH stripping buffer for 30 min at 45°C.\nDiscard stripping buffer and follow to neutralization by incubating in stripping neutralization buffer for 15 min.\nRinse the membrane in 2× SSC.",
