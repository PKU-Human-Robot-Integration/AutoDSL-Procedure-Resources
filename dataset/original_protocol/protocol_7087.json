    "Note: Steps 1 through 6 describe general approaches for properly working with lipids in preparation for production of unilamellar bilayer vesicles using a bicelle lipid mixture dilution. Lipids (received from Avanti Polar Lipids, shipped on dry-ice) are stored at -85°C until use.Note: The -85°C temperature is best for long-term storage to avoid oxidation of lipids containing unsaturation. For day-to-day short term use, -20°C storage is sufficient. Transfer the total lipid contents (typically 25 or 100 mg) from the Avanti glass ampule into Kimble glass screw-thread sample vials, which have been previously rinsed with hexane/isopropanol (7:3), or chloroform/methanol (2:1), and then dried under a stream of N2. Notes:  Solvents for working with lipids should be HPLC grade quality. Non-chlorinated solvent mixtures such as hexane/isopropanol/water (7:3:0.25) are preferred for dissolving lipids for health and safety reasons.  The use of plastic storage vessels (e.g., plastic serum tubes; Eppendorf tubes®, etc.) for lipid solutions in solvents is not advisable because, over time, the organic solvents can extract materials from the plastics and contaminate the lipids. To avoid such problems, lipids dissolved in organic solvents should be stored in clean glass screw-type vials with the screw-threads sealed with PTFE tape and the screw caps containing PTFE-liners, or better yet, sealed with MininertTM syringe valves (see below).  Evaporate the solvent from the glass screw-thread vials in a chemical exhaust fume hood using a gentle stream of N2.Place a lab support stand (8.3” × 5.5”) containing a metal rod (19.7”) and two 3-prong finger-style clamps (secured by lab-stand clamp holders) in the exhaust hood.Clamp the vial so that its lower half is submerged into a 100 ml beaker containing room temperature water.Clamp a disposable glass Pasteur pipette above the screw-cap vial containing lipid + solvent.",
    "Connect the disposable glass Pasteur pipette to the N2 tank with Tygon® tubing. Align the Pasteur pipette above the screw-cap vial and then lower it so that the pipette tip remains above the solvent containing the dissolved lipid.Evaporate the solvent by purging the sample with a gentle stream of N2 gas. Submerging the lower half of the screw-cap vial into the beaker containing room temperature water is not essential, but will reduce the solvent evaporation time by counteracting the evaporative cooling effect of the solvent removal from the glass vial.To remove all traces of any remaining solvent, place the vial containing the lipid in a heavy duty desiccator jar and subject to vacuum for 2 h.Add the desired amount of solvent mix (hexane/isopropanol/water [7:3:0.25]) to the vial containing the dried lipid using clean Hamilton syringes.Notes:  A typical working stock lipid solution (~10 mg/ml) will require a 25 mg aliquot of dried lipid that is then dissolved in 2.5 ml of solvent mix.  Adding a trace of H2O to the hexane/isopropanol solvent helps ensure solubility of polar lipids such as phosphoglycerides and glycosphingolipids  Seal the vials using PTFE-lined screw caps to avoid potential contaminants present in rubber-lined caps. Better yet, seal with MininertTM syringe valves that enable easy access via a Hamilton syringe, to avoid solvent evaporation that will alter the lipid stock concentration. Note: Do not use Pipetman®-style pipetters with plastic tips to aliquot the lipids dissolved in organic solvents. The dispensed volumes are calibrated based on the surface tension of water and leached plastics can contaminate the lipid sample.  Determine the lipid concentrations in the stock vials in one of two ways:Using a Hamilton gastight syringe, deposit aliquots of the stock solutions on dry, pre-weighed aluminum microbalance weigh pans (Cahn Style, 25 mm).",
    "Completely dry by warming to 60°C for 15-30 min and/or placing under vacuum, and weigh triplicate samples immediately using an analytical microbalance (Ali et al., 1991). A variation of this method is that of         Tejera-Garcia et al. (2012)        .Alternatively, quantify the stock concentrations of phosphoglycerides by chemical assay for phosphate (Bartlett, 1959). Associated issues are discussed in         Tejera-Garcia et al. (2012)        .Notes:  PCs with short saturated chains (e.g., DHPC) are hygroscopic. To avoid solvent evaporation that will alter lipid concentration during cold storage, vials containing lipid stocks can be further sealed by wrapping the cap/vial threaded joint with PTFE-tape and then overwrapping the cap-glass vial joint with a Parafilm strip. When stored in the freezers in organic solvents, most lipids will tend to precipitate from solution. However, when brought back to room temperature, the lipids will dissolve again upon vortexing and/or brief bath sonication in 30-40°C water. Prepare POPC unilamellar bilayer vesicles from 0.5 q-value POPC/DHPC stock bicelle mixtures as follows:Combine POPC (0.4 µmol) and DHPC (0.8 µmol) in a clear glass conical V-bottom vial.Evaporate the solvent under a gentle stream of N2 gas.Subject to vacuum as described in step 3.Hydrate the lipid mixture by adding 200 µl of buffer at room temperature, to yield a concentration of 6 mM total phospholipid (equals 0.3335 wt% [w/v]).Vortex vigorously for 5 min to achieve optical clarity and incubate overnight at room temperature.For 5× POPC vesicle concentrations, combine POPC (2 µmol) and DHPC (4 µmol) in a clear glass conical V-bottom vial.Perform steps b-d.Hydrate the lipid mixture by adding 200 µl of buffer at room temperature to yield a concentration of 30 mM total lipid (equals 1.6675 wt% [w/v]).Vortex vigorously for 5 min to achieve optical clarity and incubate overnight at room temperature.",
    "Notes:   The buffer used here is phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2) at physiological ionic strength (145 mM NaCl). Other extreme conditions such as high ionic strength (e.g., 1.5 M NaCl), which can affect the critical micelle concentration of certain amphiphiles (e.g., Chattopadhyay and Harikumar, 1996; Palladino and Ragone, 2011), have not yet been analyzed.  After vortexing, if needed briefly bath sonicate to achieve clarity. Figure 2 depicts the structural transition that occurs in response to the dilute conditions encountered by 0.5 q-value POPC/DHPC bicelle lipid mixtures. For simplicity, transitional intermediate structures (e.g., larger bicelle discs formed by coalescence and cup-shaped hemi-vesicle intermediates that form prior to rim closure) are not shown.   Cryo-EM analyses confirm the spontaneous formation of POPC unilamellar vesicle from the highly diluted (<125-fold) 0.5 qvalue POPC/DHPC bicelle mixtures (see Data analysis, Figure 3).   The best results for measuring protein-mediated lipid intermembrane transfer, tracked by Förster resonance energy transfer using fluorescent lipids (Gao et al., 2020) were observed using the POPC unilamellar bilayer vesicles formed from highly diluted 0.5 q-value POPC/DHPC bicelle mixtures compared to 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 q-value POPC/DHPC mixtures diluted similarly.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4271/bioprotoc-11-24-4271-g003.jpgFigure 3.

The bar graph shows vesicle size distribution. B.

The bar graph depicts the distribution of vesicle size (adapted from          Gao et al., 2020).",
    "If more dilute concentrations of POPC unilamellar bilayer vesicles formed from highly diluted 0.5 q-value POPC/DHPC bicelle mixtures are needed, simply add and mix the desired amount of aqueous buffer at room temperature (Gao et al., 2020).Note: As documented by Gao et al. (2020), the ‘shelf-life’ of the bicelle mix dilution vesicles is exceptionally good with respect to stability and storage capacity. In intervesicular lipid transfer assays, bicelle mix dilution vesicles, which were subjected to freeze-thawing, or kept up to 6 days at room temperature, showed no negative effects on lipid transfer kinetics."
