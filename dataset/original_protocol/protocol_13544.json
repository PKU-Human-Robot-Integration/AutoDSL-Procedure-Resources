    "All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Boston Children's Hospital for the generation of light microscopy and EM images (Figure 3). Protocols for the in vivo studies can be obtained from Wang et al.24. All experiments involving human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at Boston Children's Hospital.\n1. Preparation of Reagents\nSolution for coating tissue culture dish: Prepare 0.1% gelatin solution by dissolving 1 mL of gelatin stock solution (40%-50%) in 500 mL of sterile tissue culture grade 1x PBS (pH = 7.4). Filter the solution through a 0.22 µm filter. Store 0.1% gelatin solution at 2-8°C. It can be stored at the said temperature for an indefinite time in a sterile condition.\nGrowth medium: Prepare 500 mL of endothelial cell growth complete medium (EGM) by dissolving EGM supplements into the endothelial cell growth basal medium (EBM) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Table of Materials). Aliquot growth medium into 50 mL tubes and store the tubes at 4 °C. The shelf life of the growth medium is 12 months at 4 °C.\nTrypsin solution: For 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, aliquot from the stock vial into 50 mL tubes and store at 4 °C (up to 2 weeks) or −20 °C (up to 24 months).\n2. Culturing HRMECs\nInitial cell culture\n\t\nCoat cell culture Petri dishes (100 mm diameter x 20 mm height) with 5 mL of 0.1% gelatin solution under a laminar flow hood and keep them undisturbed in the hood for 30 min at room temperature (RT) for uniform coating.\n\t\tNOTE: Gelatin coating of dishes enhances cell attachment. Alternatively, gelatin-coated T75 culture flasks can also be used.",
    "Before seeding the cells, aspirate the gelatin solution using a vacuum pump. The vacuum pressure of the aspirator used was up to 724 mmHg.\n\t\tNOTE: Aspiration must be done immediately before seeding cells to prevent drying out of the coating solution.\nThaw a frozen vial of HRMECs (from storage in liquid nitrogen) either by using a water bath at 37 °C or by adding a warm growth medium into the vial. Once thawed, transfer the cell suspension to 9 mL of growth medium (assuming thawed vial of HRMECs is 1 mL).\n\t\tNOTE: The HRMECs were commercially obtained (Table of Materials). The growth medium added to the cells should always be prewarmed to 37 °C before use.\nSpin the cells at 200 x g for 5 min at RT and carefully aspirate the supernatant to avoid removing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of growth medium and transfer the resultant suspension onto a gelatin-coated Petri dish. Keep the cells in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Typically, HRMECs are 70%-80% confluent after 72 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The growth medium is changed every other day.\nSubculture of HRMECs on permeable membrane inserts\n\t\nPrepare cell culture filter inserts (6.5 mm inserts with 0.4 µm pore size polycarbonate membrane, placed in a 24-well plate) for seeding HRMECs by coating each insert (apical chamber) with 200 µL of 0.1% gelatin solution for 30 min under a laminar flow hood. Ensure the solution covers the entire bottom surface of the filter insert.\n\t\tNOTE: Each well has an apical and basolateral chamber separated by a porous membrane.",
    "Take out the Petri dish with cultured HRMECs (step 2.1.5.) from the incubator and aspirate the growth media. Gently rinse the cells 2x with 10 mL of 1x PBS under a laminar flow hood to get rid of potential floating/dead cells.\nDissociate the cells with 0.5-1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and place the Petri dish in the incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) for 5 min.\nQuench the trypsin activity by adding 4.5-9 mL of growth media and transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL tube using a 10 mL pipette.\nSpin the cells at 200 x g for 5 min at RT, carefully remove the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of growth media.\nCount the number of cells using a manual hemocytometer or an automated cell counter and seed at a density of 4 x 104 cells per filter insert (i.e., 1.25 x 105 cells/cm2). The volume of cell suspension for each insert is 250 µL.\nAspirate the coating solution from the wells containing permeable inserts and transfer 250 µL of the cell suspension per insert (apical chamber). Add only medium (i.e., without cells) to one of the inserts, which will be used as a \"blank control\" for TEER measurement. Simultaneously, also add 750 µL of medium per well, in the basolateral chambers.\nKeep the 24-well plate with permeable inserts in the incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) for 7-12 days until the cultured cells become fully confluent and the desired TEER value of ~20 Ω·cm2 is achieved.\nChange the growth medium every other day. During media change, carefully aspirate the media to minimize disruption of the cell monolayer and add 250 µL and 750 µL of fresh media per well to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively.",
    "​NOTE: Growth medium is changed for both the apical and basolateral chambers of the wells.\n3. TEER measurements (Figure 4)\nOn day 14 post cell seeding (step 2.2.9.), measure the TEER for HRMECs using an epithelial volt-ohm meter (EVOM) electrical resistance (ER) system (Table of Materials) as follows.\nPre-charge the ER system and check the meter functionality using the STX04 test electrode. Calibrate, if required.\nConnect the electrode to the meter and equilibrate the electrode by first soaking it in 70% ethanol for 15-20 min and then immersing it briefly in the cell culture EGM growth medium.\nIn the meantime, keep the cell-containing 24-well plate in the laminar flow hood at RT for 15-20 min for temperature equilibration.\n\tNOTE: TEER measurements are affected by temperature, so the equilibration step is essential.\nFor TEER measurement, add fresh growth medium to both the apical (250 µL) and basolateral (750 µL) chambers of the wells.\nPerform TEER measurement by carefully immersing the electrode such that the shorter tip is in the insert and the longer tip touches the bottom of the well. Measure the resistance across the blank control first. For each insert, measure TEER in triplicates.\n\tNOTE: For rinsing the electrode in between the measurements, culture media is used. Ensure the electrode is held at a 90° angle to the bottom of the insert for stable readings.\nCalculate electrical resistance (in Ω·cm2) across the monolayer using the formula, TEER = net resistance (Ω) x surface area of filter insert (cm2); here, net resistance is the difference between the resistance of each well (growth medium with cells) and the blank well (only growth medium).",
    "Carry out further treatment of the cells only after the TEER value reaches ~20 Ω·cm2. If the desired TEER level is not reached, keep the plate in the incubator and measure the TEER the following day.\n\t​NOTE: HRMEC confluency can also be validated by morphological examination of cell shape (under a microscope) with typical cobblestone morphology and/or by the presence of cell junction proteins with immunohistochemistry staining separately.\n4. Transcytosis assay\nClathrin-mediated in vitro transcytosis assay using Cy3-tagged transferrin (Figure 5)\n\t\nUpon reaching confluency with TEER values around 20 Ω·cm2, serum deprive the cells for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using 0.5% FBS in EBM (serum-reduced medium) in both chambers (apical chamber: 250 µL and basolateral chamber: 750 µL) prior to treatment with the ligand. Serum-reduced EBM was used throughout the assay.\nIncubate the cells (using the serum-reduced medium in step 4.1.1.) in the apical chamber with fluorescent (cyanine 3)-tagged transferrin ligand (Cy3-Tf) (final concentration of 40 µg/mL) for 60 min at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Plates containing Cy3-Tf should be protected from light to avoid photobleaching of Cy3-Tf by wrapping in them aluminum foil and performing the experiment in a cell culture hood with the lights turned off.\nAfter 1 h, place the plate on ice and wash the monolayer apically and basolaterally 4x (3-5 min per wash) with the serum-reduced medium at RT to remove the free unbound Cy3-Tf.\n\t\tNOTE: Washing is essential to remove free tracer molecules and allow accurate reading of transcytosis without potential leakage from the paracellular route.\nAdd fresh serum-reduced medium (as in step 4.1.1.) to the thoroughly washed filter inserts containing cells and transfer the inserts to fresh wells of the 24-well plate containing pre-warmed serum-reduced medium.",
    "Incubate the cells for another 90 min in the incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2), and then collect the medium from the basolateral chamber.\nRecord the fluorescence intensity of the solution from the basolateral chamber using a fluorescence detector. The levels of fluorescence intensity, measured as relative fluorescent units (RFU), indicate the amount of Cy3-Tf complex transcytosed across the HRMEC monolayer via clathrin-dependent transcytosis.\nCaveolae-mediated in vitro transcytosis assay using HRP (Figure 6)\n\t\nUpon reaching full confluency with TEER values around 20 Ω·cm2, serum deprive the cells for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using 0.5% FBS-containing EBM medium (serum-reduced medium) before treatment (as in step 4.1.1.). Serum-reduced EBM medium was used throughout the entire assay.\nTreat the cells in the apical chamber with the desired treatments and vehicle controls.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, we have used Wnt modulators as an example to demonstrate the regulation of caveolae-mediated transcytosis by the Wnt signaling pathway in HRMECs: human recombinant Norrin and Wnt inhibitor XAV939. In a typical experiment, cells were treated for 24 h in an incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) with the following concentrations: Norrin (125 ng/mL), Norrin (125 ng/mL) + XAV939 (10 µM), and vehicle control solution. In addition, Wnt3a-conditioned medium (produced from L Wnt-3A cells) was also used.\nIncubate the cells in the apical chamber with HRP (5 mg/mL) for 15 min at 37 °C.\nAfterward, place the 24-well plate on ice and wash the apical and basolateral chambers intensively 6x with P buffer (10 mM HEPES pH = 7.4, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM glucose, 3 mM CaCl2, 145 mM NaCl) in order to remove the free extracellular HRP.\n\t\tNOTE: Washing is essential to remove free tracer molecules and allow accurate reading of transcytosis without potential leakage from the paracellular route.",
    "Add fresh serum-reduced medium (as in step 4.1.1.) to the apical chamber and transfer the inserts to a fresh well containing pre-warmed media.\nIncubate the monolayer for an additional 90 min in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before collecting the medium from the basolateral chamber.\nTo the collected medium, add 100 µL of HRP fluorogenic peroxidase substrate (Table of Materials) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and incubate at RT for 10 min before stopping the reaction with 100 µL of Stop solution.\nDetect the levels of HRP substrate reaction product in the media using a fluorescence plate reader. Measure the fluorescence intensity at 420 nm emission wavelength (with 325 nm excitation) and as relative fluorescent units (RFU). The values indicate the level of HRP transcytosed across the HRMEC layer through caveolae-mediated transcytosis.\n\t\tNOTE: The fluorescent product used here (Table of Materials) does not photobleach. Light protection against photobleaching is not needed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
