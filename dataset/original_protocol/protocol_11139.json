    "1. Description of the minimal setup to perform FLIM\nTo perform this experiment, ensure the required setup is available: an inverted confocal microscope, a pulsed laser, typically a ps or fs, with the synchronization signal, a fast photon counting detector (time response 150 ps) and photon counting electronics, available output and input ports for the detector and the laser, respectively, on the microscope, the scan clock pulses from the microscope scan controller, the scan head of the microscope with the laser beam combiners and the main dichroic beam splitters suitable for the wavelength of the laser used for FLIM.\nIf two-photon excitation is used for FLIM, ensure the microscope contains the NDD port.\nFor mammalian cell studies, especially for long-term experiments, ensure having a CO2 incubator maintained at the desired temperature.\n\t​NOTE: For the system used in this experiment, see Table of Materials.\n2. Preparation of cells for microscopy\nGrow the cells routinely in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and a humid atmosphere.\nFor microscopy, prepare the cell suspension in a complete culture medium at the concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: The cell concentrations and media conditions are cell dependent. The number of cells used for seeding and the incubation time should be adapted to obtain 70%-80% confluence in the microscopic dish.\nSeed the cells on glass-bottom 35 mm cell culture dishes (1 x 105 cells in 100 µL per dish) using a 200 µL automatic pipette.\n\tNOTE: Use gridded glass-bottom dishes for the cells seeding to monitor cells in the same microscopic fields of view in dynamics.\n\t\nDuring the manual seeding, ensure that the pipette tip does not scratch the bottom or the sides of the dish to avoid damaging the bottom.",
    "Place the dish in the CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, humid atmosphere) and incubate the cells for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, remove the dish from the incubator and check the cells' morphology and confluence under the light microscope. If the cells did not reach about 80% confluency, incubate for an additional 24 h.\nGently remove the old medium from the dish using a 1,000 µL automatic pipette and add 2 mL of DMEM medium without phenol red (e.g., DMEM Life or FluoroBrite).\n\t​NOTE: Different culture media can be used for imaging. Avoid phenol red in the medium when using cells for microscopy.\nPlace the dish in the incubator for 60-120 min to allow for the adaptation of cells.\n3. FLIM of metabolic cofactors\nPlace the glass-bottom dish with the cells (from step 2.7) on the microscope stage.\nClick on the Locate tab in the laser scanning microscope software (e.g., ZEN - ZEISS Efficient Navigation), and then click on Transmission Light (TL) to switch the light on.\nFind the focal plane of the sample by viewing through the eyepiece on the central slice level of the cells, where a square is maximally occupied by cells (at magnification 40x).\nClick on the OFF button to switch the light off.\nOpen the Acquisition tab. To obtain transmission and autofluorescence intensity images of endogenous NAD(P)H, enter the following settings: Excitation wavelength: two-photon mode 750 nm, Registration range: 450-490 nm, Laser power: 5% (~6 mW), Image size: 1024 x 1024 pixels.\n\tNOTE: The choice of the excitation wavelength and registration range is based on the spectral characteristics (maximum excitation and maximum emission) of NAD(P)H17.\n\t\nUse an oil immersion objective lens С Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.3 NA for the image acquisition.\nPress the Snap button and save the image in ZEN format.",
    "To obtain the transmission and autofluorescence intensity images of FAD, change the Excitation Wavelength to 900 nm. Set the Registration Range: 500-550 nm, Laser power: 9% (~6 mW), and Image Size: 1024 x 1024 pixels.\n\tNOTE: The choice of the excitation wavelength and registration range is based on the spectral characteristics (maximum excitation and maximum emission) of FAD18.\n\t\nUse an oil immersion objective lens С Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.3 NA for image acquisition.\nPress the Snap button and save the image in ZEN format.\nFor NAD(P)H, set the parameters as described in step 3.5 in the laser scanning microscope software. Change the Image Size to 256 x 256 pixels.\nEnter the following parameters in the menu of SPCM (Single Photon Counting Modules) Operating software of FLIM module: Collection Time: 60 s; TAC Range: 5.00E-8; CFD Limit Low: -29.41; ADC Resolution: 256, Image Size: 256 x 256 pixels.\nScan the sample for 60 s, stop scanning and save the obtained FLIM image of NAD(P)H.\nCheck the obtained FLIM data. For this, Open the raw data in the image software, select a pixel in the cell's cytoplasm by placing the cursor over it and analyze the fluorescence decay in this pixel. Pixel intensities should be ≥3,000 photons per decay curve at binning 1.\n\tNOTE: If the number of photons is below 3,000, increase the laser power or image collection time, while controlling the morphology of cells and photon-counting rate.Typically, if the drop in the count rate exceeds 10% of the initial value, photobleaching takes place.\nFor FAD, set the parameters as described in step 3.7 in the laser scanning microscope's software. Change the image size to 256 x 256 pixels.",
    "Enter the following parameters in the menu of SPCM (Single Photon Counting Modules) Operating software of FLIM module: Collection time: 60 s; TAC Range: 5.00E-8; CFD Limit Low: -29.41; ADC Resolution: 256, Image Size: 256 x 256 pixels.\nScan the sample for 60 s. Stop scanning and save the obtained FLIM image of FAD.\n\t​NOTE: The parameters indicated in steps 3.10 and 3.15 are specific for the electronics and the detector used.\nCheck the obtained data as described in step 3.12.\nRepeat steps 3.5-3.16 to record FLIM images from different fields of view.\n4. Staining of cells with the fluorescent molecular rotor\nNOTE: The cells are imaged in the fluorescent molecular rotor solution without washing at room temperature (~20 °C) to slow down the internalization of the rotor. Membrane viscosity is temperature dependent, as demonstrated in our previous works19,20. The temperature-controlled stage of the microscope should be switched off in advance, i.e., before the rotor is added to the cells. For our setup, cooling of the stage takes about 10 min.\nPrepare a general stock solution of the fluorescent molecular rotor BODIPY 2 (Stock 1, 25.7 mM).\n\t\nOpen BODIPY 2 in a sterile environment and weigh approximately 2 mg, using an accurate balance. Carefully place it in a microcentrifuge tube.\nUse an automatic 20 µL pipette to add a 3 µL of a suitable solvent (e.g., DMSO).\nOnce the sample dissolves completely in DMSO, add 297 µL of sterile PBS and mix thoroughly using an automatic 200 µL pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: Store the stock solution in the refrigerator at +4 °C in dark packaging. Once resuspended, it can be stored in the refrigerator for several months.",
    "Prepare a Stock 2 (8.9 mM) by adding 25 µL of the general stock solution (Stock 1) to a microcentrifuge tube, followed by 48 µL of sterile PBS. Mix gently using an automatic 200 µL pipette.\n\tNOTE: Use stock 2 to prepare the final staining stock, which is applied for cell staining since micromolar concentration is required.\nGently replace the culture media in the dish (from step 3.1) with ice-cold Hank's solution without Ca2+/Mg2+ and incubate cells at +4 °C for 3 min.\n\tNOTE: The use of ice-cold solution and incubation at +4 °C slows down the internalization of the molecular rotor, and local staining of the membrane persists for 20-30 min.\nPrepare the final staining solution containing 4.5 µM of BODIPY 2 by adding 1 µL of the Stock 2 to 999 µL ice-cold Hank's solution or PBS.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of BODIPY 2 in the final staining solution can be increased to ~10 µM without any toxic effects on cells, which result in a more efficient staining and greater number of collected photons. At higher concentrations, overloading of FLIM detector may occur.\nAspirate out the Hank's solution from the cell culture dish and replace with ice-cold 4.5 µM solution of BODIPY 2. The cells are imaged in BODIPY 2 solution without washing.\n5. FLIM of the fluorescent molecular rotor in cells\nNOTE: Always perform FLIM of the fluorescent molecular rotor after FLIM of metabolic cofactors because fluorescence spectrum of BODIPY 2 is overlapped with the emission of endogenous cofactors NAD(Р)H and FAD12,17,18.\nTransfer the dish with the stained cells to the microscope stage (~20 °C) for imaging.",
    "Set the following parameters for one-photon mode in the laser scanning microscope's software: Excitation at the wavelength of 488 nm with an argon ion laser, Laser power 1%-2%, Registration Range 500-550 nm wavelength.\nUse an oil immersion objective lens С Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.3 NA for image acquisition.\nPress the Live button. Start scanning and using the XY and Z positioning by an integrated motorized stage, adjust the focus and obtain a transmission and fluorescence intensity images of cells in a preview window. Save the obtained images, if required.\nCheck on the overlapped transmission and fluorescence image to see whether the fluorescence of the rotor is coming from the expected location (plasma membrane of cell).\nEnter the following parameters in the menu of SPCM software of FLIM module: Collection time: 60 s; TAC Range: 5.00E-8; CFD Limit Low: -29.41; ADC Resolution: 256, Image Size: 256 x 256 pixels.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the system configuration and detectors used for FLIM, the parameters of image acquisition may vary.\nAdjust the Ti:Sapphire laser of the microscope to a wavelength of 850 nm and the Laser Power to 1%-2% for two-photon FLIM.\nSelect the Continuous tab in the laser scanning microscope software, and then press Start in the SPCM software. Scan the sample for 60 s, stop scanning, and save the obtained FLIM image.\nCheck the obtained FLIM data. For this, load the raw data in the FLIM data analysis SPCImage software, select a pixel in the cell's membrane by placing the cursor over it and analyze the fluorescence decay in this pixel. Pixel intensities should be ≥5,000 per decay (possibly including binning) at a reasonable collection time (60-120 s).\nRepeat steps 5.4-5.8 to record FLIM images of cells from different fields of view.",
    "​NOTE: FLIM measurements of live cells stained with BODIPY 2 should be limited to ~30 min after adding BODIPY 2.\n6. Data analysis\nFluorescence intensity analysis: redox ratio\n\t\nOpen images of fluorescence intensity of NAD(P)H and FAD using ImageJ.\nHighlight a cell-free area in the NAD(P)H image using a circle or a square option. Click on Measure, and then click on Subtract (select Process on the main panel, and then Math and Subtract) to subtract the obtained value of the background signal.\nRepeat step 6.1.2 for FAD image.\nObtain the image of the redox ratio by dividing the FAD fluorescence intensity by NAD(P)H fluorescence intensity. Do this by selecting Process on the main panel, and then select Image Calculator and Divide; check the box Create new window, and then press OK.\nSave the image in TIFF format.\nTo calculate the redox ratio, select the region of the cytoplasm in the specific cell on the TIFF image and press the M key. Repeat for all cells of interest.\nImport the measurement to a spreadsheet document.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, fluorescence intensities of NAD(P)H and FAD in cells can be measured using standard software of the microscope and the redox ratio can be obtained by dividing these values in the spreadsheet software.\nFLIM data analysis: metabolism\n\t\nImport FLIM image of NAD(P)H into SPCImage software.\nApply a bi-exponential decay fit to the image by putting 2 in the Components section.\nFix the Offset parameter by checking the corresponding box in the SPCImage software.\nGo to Options and select Model. Use Incomplete Multiexponential fitting model and Fit Method MLE.\nAdjust binning to achieve pixel intensities of ≥5000 photons per decay curve.\nCheck χ2 value. The χ2≤ 1.20 indicates that the model used provides a reasonable fit.",
    "Calculate the histogram of fluorescent lifetime in each image by clicking on the top menu Calculate, and then on Decay Matrix.\nSelect the area in the cytoplasm of the specific cell as a region of interest.\nAnalyze the short and long lifetime components (τ1 and τ2, respectively) and the relative amplitudes of the lifetime components (a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = 100%) by using the Color option.\nExport the measurements to a spreadsheet software.\nRepeat steps 6.2.8-6.2.10 for each cell of interest.\nRepeat steps 6.2.1-6.2.11 for FAD image.\nFLIM data analysis: viscosity\n\t\nImport FLIM image into FLIM data analysis SPCImage software.\nRemove the mark in the Scatter box.\nPut 1 in the Components section, since the rotor fluorescence decay should fit to a monoexponential model.\nAdjust binning to achieve a pixel intensity of ≥5000 photons per decay curve.\nCheck the χ2 value in the plasma membrane. A value of χ2≤ 1.20 indicates that the model used provides a reasonable fit. In the case of χ2≥ 1.20, monoexponential approximation is not applicable, such data can indicate the dye aggregation and should be discarded. Aggregation makes it impossible to use the calibration curves and leads in incorrect viscosity estimates.\n\t\tNOTE: Bi-exponential decays may be indicative of aggregation. On a microscope with FLIM module with variable filters, this can be detected by testing monomer and aggregate-specific emission wavelength ranges, 500-550 nm and 580-650 nm, as described in reference21.\nGenerate the histogram of the fluorescence lifetime τ for each image by clicking on the top menu Calculate, and then on Decay Matrix.\nSelect the region of plasma membrane of individual cell with monoexponential decay, χ2≤ 1.20, using ROI option.\nExport the value of fluorescence lifetime to a spreadsheet software.\nRepeat steps 6.3.7-6.3.8 for each cell of interest.",
    "Convert experimentally measured lifetimes of BODIPY 2 (in ns) to viscosity values (in cP) using the following equation (previously obtained on the basis of the calibration plot of BODIPY in methanol/glycerol mixtures):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62708/62708eq01.jpg\n\t\twhere x - viscosity (in cP), y - fluorescence lifetime τ (in ns).\n\t\tNOTE: IRF (Instrument Response Function) is an important part of FLIM fitting. In SPCImage IRF is automatically calculated from the rising edge of the fluorescence decay curves. Meanwhile, IRF can be recorded using non-fluorescent sample, e.g., ceramics, or a sample that produces SHG (Second Harmonic Generation) signal, e.g., collagen, urea crystals, or sugar. The use of the recorded IRFs is not recommended if there is an option to calculate it in the software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
