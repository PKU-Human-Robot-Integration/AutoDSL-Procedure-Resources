    "1. Cell culture and transfection\nMake HEK cell media with DMEM, 1x (Dulbecco's Modification of Eagle's Medium) supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, L-glutamine & sodium pyruvate and 10% FBS. Sterile filter.\nPredetermine suitable ligands and receptors for aggregation assay.\n\tNOTE: Neurexin3α SS4+/- and one of its known ligands, LRRTM2, were used in this study. Ligands and receptors of interest were expressed from cDNAs in pcDNA3.1. A Gibson assembly was used to insert Neurexin3α into pcDNA3.112. Neurexin3α F/R: TTTAAACTTAAGCTTGGTACCGAGCTCGGATCCGCCACCATGAGCTTTACCCTCCACTC/\n\tGAGCGGCCGCCACTGTGCTGGATATCTGCAGAATTCTTACACATAATACTCCTTGTCCTT.\nPrepare HEK293T cells.\n\t\nGrow HEK293T cells to confluency in one T-75 flask.\nOnce confluent, use 2 mL of trypsin and place in 37 °C incubator for 2 min. Add 6 mL of HEK media to the flask to resuspend cells and transfer all 8 mL to a 15 mL conical tube.\nPellet at 500 x g for 5 min and resuspend in HEK cell media for a total of 8 mL.\nCount cells and add 735,000 cells into each well of a 6-well plate. Adjust final volume to 2 mL for each well using HEK cell media.\nPlace in 37 °C incubator and allow cells to grow overnight or until they reach 50-60% confluency.\nTransfect HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate method13.\n\t\nTransfect well-1 with 3 µg of the protein of interest and co-transfect with 1 µg of fluorescent protein (3 µg of pcDNA3.1-Neurexin3αWT SS4- and 1 µg of mCherry).\nTransfect well-2 as in step 1.4.1. but with the mutated protein of interest (pcDNA3.1-Neurexin3αA687T SS4-).\nTransfect well-3 with 3 µg of the ligand of interest and co-transfect with 1 µg of another fluorescent protein (3 µg of pcDNA3.1 LRRTM2 and 1 µg of GFP).\nTransfect well-4 and well-5 to serve as negative controls: well-4 with 1 µg of GFP and well-5 with 1 µg of mCherry.",
    "Prepare another plate (as in step 1.4.1-1.4.4) if requiring additional conditions or controls (Neurexin3αWT/A687T SS4+).\n\t\tNOTE: Transfection efficiency is analyzed 24 h after transfection under an epifluorescence microscope and quantified as the number of cells expressing the fluorescent protein they were transfected with. A more streamlined approach would include the transfection of HEK cells with a bicistronic vector coding for a fluorescent protein and the ligand of interest and is highly recommended above co-transfection. In the case of this study, alpha Neurexins are ~4.3 kb and low fluorescence intensity was observed using a bicistronic system necessitating co-transfection.\n48 hours after transfection, harvest cells for aggregation.\n\t\nWash each well twice with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of 10 mM EDTA in PBS into each well to gently dissociate cell-to-cell interactions and incubate plate at 37 °C for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Trypsin is not recommended for step 1.5.2 due to potential proteolytic cleavage of adhesion molecules in study. Additionally, after EDTA addition the protocol may not be stopped until completion as cells will now be exposed to ambient conditions.\nGently tap plate to detach the cells, and harvest each well into separate 15 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge conical tubes at 500 x g and room temperature for 5 min.\nWhile cells are pelleting, prepare 6 incubation tubes by labeling the top of each microcentrifuge tube with each condition.\n\tNOTE: Each permutation of GFP and mCherry conditions should be used to encompass all experimental conditions and proper controls. For example: 1. GFP/mCherry, 2. mCherry/LRRTM2-GFP 3. GFP/Neurexin3αWT SS4-—mCherry, 4. GFP/Neurexin3αA687T SS4- –mCherry, 5. Neurexin3αWT SS4-—mCherry/LRRTM2—GFP, 6. Neurexin3αA687T SS4- –mCherry/LRRTM2—GFP. Make additional tubes to accommodate further conditions and controls.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 500 µL of HEK media with 10 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM MgCl2 warmed to 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: The addition of CaCl2 and MgCl2 allows adhesion molecules to reestablish binding and is only required if the transcellular interaction partners in question require divalent cations for adhesion.\nCount the cells in each 15 mL conical tube using a hemocytometer and aliquot 200,000 cells of each condition into appropriate tube from step 1.6.1 for a 1:1 mix in a total volume of 500 µL.\n\tNOTE: It should only take 5 min per condition to count and aliquot amounts.\nIncubate tubes at room temperature in a slow tube rotator.\n2. Image acquisition\nOptimize microscope acquisition parameters for specific samples. In this example, images were taken on a wide-field microscope. Use a 5x air objective (NA: 0.15; WD: 20000 μm) to get a large enough field for analysis.\nAssess baseline aggregation immediately after mixing the two conditions of HEK cells in step 1.8. These are now the ‘time zero’ images.\n\t\nPipette 40 µL of each sample mixture onto a charged microscope slide and image under fluorescence in both the 488 and 561 channels.\nAcquire three different fields of view at one focus plane per sample drop.\nAcquire final images at 60 min as the ‘time 60’ image.\n\t\nTo obtain the ‘time 60’ image of the mixture after a 60 min incubation, take another 40 µL sample of each condition from rotating tubes and pipette each sample onto a charged slide. Image as in step 2.2.2.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell aggregation should be checked every 15 min until saturation occurs. Timing of aggregation will depend on the proteins being tested.\n3. ImageJ/Fiji Analysis\nTo quantify the extent of aggregation using Fiji/ImageJ, save analysis files.\n\t\nSave the provided Supplemental coding files into the imageJ macros folder on the computer.\nInstall the aggregation macro provided (Plugins, Macros, Install, and select the “AggregationAssay.txt” file).\nDetermine thresholds.",
    "Load a ‘time zero’ .tif file into imageJ and split the channels (Image | Color | Split Channels).\n\t\tNOTE: The ‘time zero’ image is used to determine the thresholding and smallest puncta size for the whole experiment.\nMask each channel (Plugins | Macros | AggregationAssay_MakeMask). Make Mask From Image window will appear. Check boxes next to Determine Threshold for Image and Determine Cluster Params from Histogram and click OK.\nDetermine the threshold of the image using the slide bar, record the number to the right of the slide bar and click OK.\nA Histogram of Cluster Size will appear. Select a cluster size from the histogram that suits the experiment, type this number in the Min Cluster Size: box, and click OK. Clusters below this size will not be analyzed.\nRun the analysis.\n\t\nOpen the ‘time 60’ image of condition 1 in imageJ and split the channels as in step 3.2.1.\nMask each channel (Plugins, Macros, AggregationAssay_MakeMask). Use the same threshold and size determined in step 3.2.3 and step 3.2.4. Unselect the boxes next to Determine Threshold for Image and Determine Cluster Params from Histogram and manually type the size and thresholds into the appropriate fields then click OK.\nCalculate the aggregation index (Plugins | Macros | AggregationAssay_CalculateOverlap). Select the masked channels to be compared and directory into which the resulting files will save.\nRepeat steps 3.3.1–3.3.3 for every ‘time 60’ image in every condition.\n\t\tNOTE: The aggregation index is defined as the total overlap area divided by the sum of the two channel areas minus the overlap area multiplied by 100 (Aggregation index = overlap area/[area of channel 1 + area of channel 2 – overlap area] x 100). This normalization is an ‘OR’ operation between the two masked channels representing the total pixels in either mask.",
