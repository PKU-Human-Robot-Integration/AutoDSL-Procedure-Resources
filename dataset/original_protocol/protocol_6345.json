    "Saccharomyces cerevisiae standard culture conditionsSaccharomyces cerevisiae can be grown in yeast complete medium (YPD) (Recipe 3a) or in Synthetic dropout medium (SD) (Recipe 3b) supplemented with strain-specific requirements.Inoculate 150 ml of culture medium (containers of 500 ml) with S. cerevisiae cells from a 5 ml preculture growing exponentially, and incubate them at 30 °C (or at the required temperature). Cultures must be shaken at 180-200 rpm on an orbital shaker.Let cultures grow until an OD600 ~0.7-0.8 is reached.Transfer cultures to 50 ml centrifuge tubes (x3) and harvest them by centrifugation (2,500 x g for 2 min at 4 °C). Discard the supernatant.In this step, pellets can be stored at -80 °C or can be used to continue the procedure.Chromatin purification protocolAll the subsequent steps are performed at 4 °C.Wash cells with 5 ml of sterile MilliQ H2O, centrifuge (2,500 x g for 2 min) and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of MilliQ H2O.Transfer to 1.5 ml microtubes and centrifuge them at 2,500 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 200 µl of Buffer 1 (Recipe 1 Table 1) and add 200 µl of glass beads (size: 425-600 µm).Lyse cells by continuous vigorous vortexing for 4 min at maximal speed using a Genie 2 vortex with a TurboMix Attachment (a multisample device) at 4 °C.Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min to spin down the glass beads and intact cells. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microtube. Be careful to not take anything from the pellet to efficiently reduce cytoplasmic contamination during subsequent steps.Centrifuge the supernatant at 500 x g for 5 min to discard the residual intact cells. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microtube.",
    "The pellet’s contamination in this step leads to cytoplasmic contaminants in the final purified chromatin fraction.Keep 5-10 µl of supernatant as the input control.Centrifuge the rest of the supernatant at high speed (20,000 x g) for 20 min.Discard the supernatant using a pipette and resuspend the visible pellet (P1) in 200 µl of Buffer 1 (Table 1).Centrifuge at high speed (20,000 x g) for 20 min.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the visible pellet (P2) in 200 µl of Buffer 2 (Recipe 1 Table 2).Centrifuge at high speed (20,000 x g) for 20 min.Discard the supernatant. The visible final pellet (P3) constitutes the chromatin-enriched fraction.For SDS-PAGE and Western blots, resuspend P3 in 20 µl of 1x Tris-Glycine SDS Sample Buffer (Recipe 2) and incubate it for 10 min at 100 °C. After boiling, spin down at 30,000 x g for 1 min. Use the supernatant for gel electrophoresis.For the mass spectrometry analysis, gently resuspend the chromatin-enriched fractions (P3) in 20 µl of Tris-HCl 50 mM, pH 7.5, at room temperature. It can be frozen at -20 or -80 °C for further analyses.Scale-up conditionsTo scale up the protocol, 600 ml of S. cerevisiae cultures at OD600 ~0.7-0.8, must be used and the complete protocol must be performed at 4 °C.Harvest the culture into three centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 2,500 x g for 2 min. Under these conditions, each tube contains a cell pellet corresponding to 200 ml of the culture cells.Wash each cell’s pellet with 5 ml of sterile MilliQ H2O, centrifuge at 2,500 x g for 2 min and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml of MilliQ H2O.Transfer to 1.5 ml microtubes and centrifuge at 2,500 x g for 1 min. Discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend each pellet in 200 µl of Buffer 1 (Table 1) and add 200 µl of glass beads (425-600 µm).Lyse cells by vigorous continuous vortexing for 4 min (Genie 2 with the TurboMix Attachment, a multisample device, at maximal speed).Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min to spin down the glass beads and intact cells. Transfer the three supernatants corresponding to the same cell culture to a new single 1.5 ml microtube.Subsequent steps are similar to the standard protocol. In Steps B10 and B12 of the standard protocol, scale up buffers to 600 µl.For SDS-PAGE and Western blots, resuspend P3 in 60 µl of 1x Tris-Glycine SDS Sample Buffer (Recipe 2; Table 3) and incubate the desired amount for 10 min at 100 °C. After boiling, spin down at 30,000 x g for 1 min. Use the supernatant for gel electrophoresis.For the mass spectrometry analysis, gently resuspend the chromatin-enriched fractions (P3) in 20 µl (or that required) of Tris-HCl 50 mM, pH 7.5, at room temperature. It can be frozen at -20 or -80 °C for further analyses.Scale-down conditionsTo scale down the protocol, 50 ml of S. cerevisiae cultures at OD600 ~0.7-0.8, are used and all the protocol must be performed at 4 °C.When scaling down the protocol, the solution volumes used for the standard procedures (200 μl) are maintained to easily manipulate samples.For SDS-PAGE and Western blots, resuspend P3 in 20 µl of 1x Tris-Glycine SDS Sample Buffer (Recipe 2; Table 3) and incubate the desired amount for 10 min at 100 °C. After boiling, spin down at 30,000 x g for 1 min. Use the supernatant for gel electrophoresis."
