    "Notes:     Pre-warm KRBHA buffer and ATEM (see Recipes) to 37 °C prior to the experiment   This protocol was performed in sterile conditions under a laminar flow hood.        Adipose tissue explant preparation (Figure1)   Cut adipose tissue into pieces of around 1-2 cm3 and put it in a 50 ml conical tubes (Figure 1A). Do not exceed 25 ml of AT explant for each 50 ml conical tube (this amount is sufficient to perform 4-5 x Clinicell AT explant)   Cut with scissors for 2 min (Figure 1B).   Add 20 ml of KRBHA, close the tube, and mix gently by inverting the tube 3-4 times.   Centrifuge the tube at 100 x g for 2 min (Figure 1C).   Remove the infranatant by using a 14 G stainless cannula and a 20 ml syringe (Figures H-I).   Repeat Steps A2-A6 until AT explant is able to be pipetted with a 5 ml plastic pipet.   When AT explants are sufficiently cut, replace the KRBHA by 20 ml of ATEM (see Recipes).   Close the tube, mix gently by inverting the tube and leave it for 15 min at 37 °C in the benchtop dry bath.   Remove the infranatant by using the 14 G stainless cannula and a 20 ml syringe (Figures G-I).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131213548_8091.jpg Figure 1.

    "Clinicell filling (Figure 2)   Under the hood, take a 150 mm sterile Petri dish and use the lower part.   Prepare 10 ml of pre-warmed ATEM in a 50 ml conical tube for each Clinicell. For lipolysis with isoproterenol and ANP, the final concentrations used are typically 1 and 0.5 µM respectively. Taking into account that the volume of explant represents 1/3 of the total cassette volume, the real concentration of the lipolytic drug in the ATEM should be then 1.33 and 0.667 µM for isoproterenol and ANP respectively.    Fill a 10 ml syringe connected with a 21 G needle.    Open the Clinicell by one side (be cautious to keep the cap sterile) and open a half turn the cap of the other side in order to fill the Clinicell with AT explants (Figure 2B).   Take the AT explant under the hood and aspirate the ATEM with the14 G stainless cannula and a 20 ml syringe.   Pipette 3.5 ml of AT explant with a 5 ml pipette connected to a pipettor (Figure 2B).   Completely fill the Clinicell with the ATEM using the 10 ml syringe connected to the 21 G needle by one side and by tilting it lightly (Figures 2E-2F). When the level of media is nearly to the top of the other side (Figure 2G), close this side and completely fill the cassette and close the second side (Figure 2H).    Gently mix AT explant and media by tilting the Clinicell by rotating movement and lay it horizontally in the 150 mm Petri dish (Figure 2I).   Put all the system in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) and leave it for the time you need. Typically 4 h incubation time is sufficient to study short term lipolysis.",
    "The incubation time could be extended to 48 h for studying long term effect on adipose tissue stroma cells.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131213709_6512.jpg Figure 2.

Complete filling of the Clinicell with ATEM with a 10 ml syringe connected to a 21 G needle; I. Disposition of the Clinicell in the Petri dish before incubation in the incubator.     Explant and media recovery (Figure 3)   Prepare a 15 ml conical tube, a 10 ml syringe and the stainless cannula.   Take the Clinicell out of the incubator and transfer under the laminar flow hood. After tilting vigorously (Figure 3B) open one side, put it vertically above the 15 ml conical tube, then open the second side and let the explant and the media pour out (Figures 3C-3E).   Centrifuge the tube at 100 x g for 2 min.   Recover the conditioned media by using the 10 ml syringe connected to the stainless steel cannula (Figure 3F). When done, vertically return the syringe and cannula, aspirate 1 ml of air, discard the cannula, connect a 0.22 µm filter to the syringe and filtrate the conditioned media Figure 3G).   Make aliquots of the conditioned media and freeze it at -20 °C or -80 °C for long-term storage. Keep an aliquot of 300 to 500 µl at -20 °C to perform metabolite determination subsequently.   The AT explants could either be dissociated using collagenase digestion to isolate the stroma-vascular fraction and the mature adipocytes or aliquoted by 0.5 ml and frozen and stored at -80 °C in 0.5 ml RNA lysis buffer.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131213813_3626.jpg Figure 3.

Representative photography of the explants and the medium after filtration through a 0.22 µm filter.      Lipolysis and metabolites determinations (Figure 4) Glycerol and free fatty acid determination could be performed using the commercial kits described in the materials and reagents in 96-well microplates and a microplate spectrophotometer. Typically 20 µl of media is sufficient for glycerol and NEFA determination and 5 to 10 µl for glucose and lactate. The standard curves are performed in ATEM medium except for the glucose one which is done in PBS (the glucose concentration in the ATEM medium, which is around 5.5 mM, should be measured in order to be able to calculate the glucose consumption [difference between glucose concentration in ATEM and in AT explants conditioned medium]). Examples of data obtained are presented in Figure 4.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131213910_6598.jpg Figure 4.
