    "All the protocol steps described below follow the animal care guidelines of our institutions.\n1. Zebrafish Culture\nBreed and maintain adult zebrafish under standard conditions.\n\tNOTE: AB and TL wild type embryos were used for this study.\nCollect embryos and grow them at 28.5 °C in E3 embryo medium24. Stage them according to morphology as previously described19.\n2. Atomic Force Microscopy\nManually dechorionate staged zebrafish embryos (of different ages according to individual interests). Remove chorions with two thin and sharp forceps (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nGrip the chorion using one forceps and make a tear in it with the other forceps. Then, holding the chorion in a region opposite to that of the tear, push the embryo gently through the opening.\nPerform the dechorionation under a dissecting stereomicroscope with an adjustable range of magnification between 8X and 50X.\nMount the embryos for AFM\nPrepare a solution of 2% agarose in embryo medium and fill a 35-mm Petri dish with this. Let it solidify. Make small holes of 1.5 mm of diameter (twice the embryo size) and approximately 350 µm depth (half the embryo size) with thin forceps in the agarose bed.\nPlace the embryos in the pokes made in the agarose layer and assure they are in place by spreading around a solution of 0.5% low melting agarose in embryo medium. Pour this solution around just the embryos to secure them in the holes.\nBefore the low melting point agarose solidifies at room temperature, rotate the embryos in such a way that the region of interest to be probed by AFM will face upwards (Figure 1A).\nExamine the embryos by AFM",
    "Locate and image the embryos in the petri dish employing a 20X objective in an Inverted Atomic Force Microscope (see Table of Materials25) at room temperature (23 - 24 °C).\n\t\tNOTE: The embryos are kept alive immersed in embryo medium and attached to the agarose bed.\nProbe the yolk cell surface of casted embryos employing spherical polystyrene beads of 4.5 µm in diameter attached to a cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 0.01 N/m. Set the peak-to-peak amplitude of cantilever oscillation to 5 µm and its frequency to 1 Hz.\nCollect data for each region to be tested in different positions and in several embryos, as a routine, for data averaging.\n\t\tNOTE: A good starting point is to probe five positions located in the middle and at the corners of a 10 µm x 10 µm square by controlling the cantilever position with the XY piezo-actuators of the AFM microscope. Imaging and data collection took around 20 min per embryo. Recording data in different regions of the embryo yolk cell surface, e.g., the vegetal pole or different regions close to the EVL cells margin (Figure 1B and 1C), can only be done by employing distinct specimens oriented differently.\nCalculate forces\nMeasure the vertical displacement of the AFM cantilever (z) with strain gauge sensors coupled to piezo-actuators, and its deflection (d) using a quadrant photodiode by the optical lever method with the microscope control software (see Table of Materials25).\nUse the slope of a d-z curve obtained from data collected from a bare region of a glass coverslip to calibrate the correlation between the photodiode signal and the cantilever deflection (d).\n\t\tNOTE: The measured vertical displacement equals the cantilever deflection and the slope represents the deflection sensitivity of the optical lever26.",
    "Infer the cantilever spring constant (k) from the thermal fluctuations as previously described27.\nCompute the indentation of the sample (h) as:\nh = (z - zc) - (d - doff)          (1)\n\t\tNOTE: Here zc is the position of the contact point and doff is the offset of the photodiode.\nCalculate the force (F) on the cantilever as:\nF = k · d          (2)\nCalculate the tension of the cortex in terms of a liquid-balloon model consisting of an elastic layer of cortical tension Tc enclosing a viscous liquid. In this model, for small indentations (in comparison to the size of the embryo), force increases proportionally4,28 as:\nF = 4π Tc [(Rb / Re) +1)] h          (3)\n\tNOTE: Here Rb is the radius of the bead and Re is the radius of the embryo. For the zebrafish embryo, as the radius of the embryo (400 µm) is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the bead (2.25 µm), this equation can be approximated as:\nF = 4π Tc h          (4)\n\t\nCalculate the tension force-indentation (F-h) curves in each embryo yolk cell region for five different point measurements.\nCompute the Tc for each F-h curve by non-linear least-squares fitting. For statistical analysis, the cortical tension Tc computed must be averaged from the different F-h curves.\nMeasure the viscoelastic properties (rheology) of the cortex by applying low amplitude (100 nm) multifrequency oscillations during AFM composed of sinusoidal waves of different frequencies25.\nCompute an effective complex modulus g*(ƒ) in the frequency domain from the force indentation curves as:\ng*(f) = [F(f) / h(f)] - ifb          (5)",
    "here i is the imaginary unit and F(f) and h(f) are the frequency (f) spectra of force and indentation. b is the correction for the viscous drag on the cantilever extracted from the oscillations applied on the surface.\nSeparate g*(ƒ) into real and imaginary parts as:\ng*(ƒ) = g'(f) + ig''(f)          (6)\n\t\tem>g'(f) is the elastic modulus and is a measure of the elastic energy stored and recovered per cycle of oscillation. g''(f) is the viscous modulus that accounts for the dissipated energy.\nCalculate the loss tangent, which provides an index of the solid-like (<1) or liquid-like (>1) behavior of the material, as:\ng''(f) / g'(f)          (7)\n\t\tNOTE: With this type of measurement, it is possible to extract parameters indicating how viscous and how elastic is the probed material. Although b slightly depends on the distance of the end of the cantilever to the surface, given the very low values of g´´ exhibited by the yolk cell (see Figure 2D below), small variations in b have a negligible impact in the measurements29.\n3. Particle Tracking Microrheology\nPerform particle microinjection into the yolk cell\nFabricate tailored microneedles using a horizontal micropipette puller and borosilicate capillary glass (see Table of Materials).\n\t\t\nPrepare microneedles that have an outer diameter of 1.00 mm, an inner diameter of 0.58 mm and a length of 10 cm using puller settings: Pressure: 500; Heat: 510; Pull: 65; Velocity: 25; Time: 50.\nPrepare an injection petri dish plate by creating straight indentation lanes in a 1% agarose in embryo medium bed employing custom made molds (see Table of Materials).",
    "Turn the molds upside down and place them on top of the liquid agarose gel and remove the molds once the gel has solidified. Pipette the embryos into the grooves made by the mold in the agarose under a dissecting stereomicroscope at 1.2X magnification.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The width and design of the molds enable the embryos to self-align.\nBefore injection, almost completely remove the medium to facilitate injection (the surface tension prevents the embryo/chorion from sticking to the needle when removing it after injection).\nMicroinject fluorescent nanoparticles (radius a = 100 nm, see Table of Materials) diluted in water (1:1,000) in the vegetal part of the embryo yolk cell (Figure 3A).\nAdjust the micropipette with precision micromanipulators and inject the beads with an automatic microinjector with time and pressure controls (see Table of Materials). Set the pressure between 10 and 20 psi.\nBefore injecting the bead solution, calibrate the volume to inject (0.5 nL) by measuring the droplet size delivered by the microinjector with a 1x 0.01 mm stage micrometer (see the Table of Materials).\nEmploy a magnification of 1.6X in the dissecting stereomicroscope to visualize the embryos during the injections, which are performed at room temperature.\nAssess the viscoelastic behavior of the yolk by recording thermal fluctuations\nDechorionate the microinjected embryos as in step 2.1 and embed them in a 0.5% low melting point agarose in embryo medium solution at 30 °C. Afterwards, transfer them to glass bottom plates (see Table of Materials) and orient and push them towards the coverslip when the agarose is still liquid.\n\t\tNOTE: When the agarose solidifies at room temperature, the embryos are ready to be imaged.",
    "Place the embryos mounted in the glass bottom plates on the stage of a confocal inverted microscope 2 h after microinjection. Capture images of the nanoparticles for 26 s at a sampling rate of 25 Hz with a 63X objective at room temperature in an inverted confocal microscope employing the standard commercial microscope software (pixel size = 166 nm, images captured every 40 ms).\nCompute the position of the particles' centroids and define their trajectories over time with the TrackMate plugin of the open source ImageJ software (Figure 3B).\nCalculate the two-dimensional Mean Square Displacement (MSD) of each particle with custom-made software6,30 as:\n\t\t<Δr2 (τ)> = <[x(t + τ) - x(t)]2 + [y(t + τ) - y(t)]2>          (8)\n\t\tNOTE: Here t is the elapsed time and the time lag. In a pure viscous liquid, the MSD increases inversely with viscosity (ν) according to the Stokes-Einstein relationship:\n\t\t<Δr2 (τ)> = 4kB Tτ/ 6πνa,          (9)\n\t\twhere T is the absolute temperature.\nSubscription Required.
