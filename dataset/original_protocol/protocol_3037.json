This feeding assay method does not involve flies to undergo starvation to measure feeding. Our method utilizes micro-tips to measure feeding unlike the classical capillary tubes. The assay is performed at ZT 01, i.e., 1 h post lights on condition. Flies feed the highest post lights on condition and thus this time was used.\nTransfer age matched flies into the CAFE assay tubes without anaesthetizing them (as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: We used 16, two-day old male flies in each assay tube, this is to avoid overcrowding of the assay tube. The number, sex and age of the fly can be adjusted according to the experimental needs.\nEnsure to cover all the holes of the assay tube with uncut tips as described (This is to ensure no fly escapes from the tube).\nSet up 3–5 technical replicates for each feeding assay.\nOnce all the tubes are setup with flies, remove one of the uncut 200 μL tip and introduce 10 μL (XL) tip containing 10 μL of liquid food with 0.1M sucrose solution.\nSet up an empty tube with only food as the evaporation control for each experiment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2784-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The evaporation loss was calculated and is given in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A. Volume dissipated was accounted to be on an average ≥ 0.008 μL, with an SD of 0.012).\nCarefully place the assay tubes inside a 25°C incubator for 3 h under 60% relative humidity for the feeding to be recorded.\nAfter 3h (at ZT 04) using a Vernier caliper measure the height of the remaining food from the base.\nNote: Ensure the tips are held straight while measuring the height.\nMeasure the height for all the tubes.\nCalculate the volume consumed by using the height measured as described below.\nFreeze the tubes at −20°C for 1 h to count the number of flies.",
    "Count the number of flies in each tube and note it along with the height corresponding to that particular assay tube.\nNote: As the flies are transferred without anaesthetizing at the start of the assay and thus one or two flies could escape at times and step 8–9 are followed to account for this error.\nDivide the volume calculated by the number of flies to obtain average volume fed by each fly.\nThe flies post the assay can also be used to measure feeding through dye tracer methods8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] as mentioned in the introduction, by homogenizing the flies. Thus, this assay provides us volume as well as color intensity.\nCritical: The accuracy of the results is critically based on the volume introduced. Therefore, it is important to pipette out exact volumes. It is advisable to have an internal evaporation control for all experiments.\nVolume calculation using deduction method\nMicro-tip is an open-ended cone unlike the cylindrical capillary tube. Volume of an open-ended cone is given by the formula\nV\n=\n(\n1\n3\n)\nπ\n{\n(\nr\n1\n)\n2\n+\n(\nr\n1\nr\n2\n)\n+\n(\nr\n2\n)\n2\n}\n×\nh\nwhere r1 and r2 are the two radii of the cone and h is the height of the cone.\nTo calculate the volume from an open-ended cone, one requires both the radii as described above. That meant cutting the tips post each experiment to measure the volume. This is a very tedious process and introduces large errors. To overcome this we deduced a method using 2-point line equation to calculate the unknown radius.\nCalculating the slope of the line (l).",
    "Note: The 2-point line equation is given by the formula   y −  y 1  = m  (  x −  x 1   )   w h e r e  m =    y 2  −  y 1     x 2  −  x 1     a n d  x  a n d  y  a r e  t h e  c o − o r d i n a t e s  \nAccording to the equation the x, y coordinates are the radius and the height respectively (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nTo calculate the radius, measure the inner diameter (id) at h1 (y1) and h2 (y2) using an optical microscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).\nMeasure the variance using multiple tips and further to account for the manufacturer’s variability measure the radius from different lots/bags (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H).\nMeasure the height h2 (at 10 μL mark) of multiple tips using Vernier caliper (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Height h1, being at the base of the tip is always going to be zero.\nCalculate the mean radii and height to be used for slope calculations.\nWith the available information, we are now able to calculate the slope of the equation, which is given by\nm\n=\nh\n2\nr\n2\n−\nr\n1\nThe mean values of radii and height from our calculations is given below\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2784_2.csv\nCalculate the slope of the line (l) using the calculated radii and height. Using the above values, we calculated the slope of the line (l) to be 30.1989.\nNote: We used this value in all our experiments.\nUsing this slope of the line, any point on the line (l) can be calculated from the 2-point line equation.\nCalculate the unknown radius (r3) after feeding by using the height measured at the end of the experiment.",
    "Critical: The above slope calculations used throughout the assay are specific to the Tarsons company Ltd. micro-tips used by us. Alternatively tip from any brand can be used after determining the radii and the height.\nCalculating the new radius of the tip post feeding:\nThe equation of the line (l) with radius r1 and r3 and h1 and h3 with slope m, is represented as follows\nh\n3\n−\nh\n1\n=\nm\n(\nr\n3\n−\nr\n1\n)\n,\nw\nh\ne\nr\ne\nh\n3\n=\nh\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\no\nf\nt\nh\ne\nt\ni\np\na\nf\nt\ne\nr\nf\ne\ne\nd\ni\nn\ng\n,\nh\n1\n=\nh\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\na\nt\nt\nh\ne\nb\na\ns\ne\n,\nr\n3\n=\nr\na\nd\ni\nu\ns\na\nt\nt\nh\ne\np\no\ni\nn\nt\no\nf\nv\no\nl\nu\nm\ne\nr\ne\nm\na\ni\nn\ni\nn\ng\ni\nn\nt\nh\ne\nt\ni\np\nr\n1\n=\nr\na\nd\ni\nu\ns\na\nt\nt\nh\ne\nb\na\ns\ne\nWe know that h1 = 0, and the unknown radius (r3) is thus\nr\n3\n=\n(\nh\n3\nm\n)\n+\nr\n1\nCalculate radius r3 using the above equation.\nCalculate the volume of the new cone (leftover food) using the given formula.\nV\n1\n=\n(\n1\n3\n)\nπ\n{\n(\nr\n1\n)\n2\n+\n(\nr\n1\nr\n3\n)\n+\n(\nr\n3\n)\n2\n}\n×\nh\nTo calculate the fed volume (V2) subtract V1 from the initial volume i.e., 10 μL and to account for evaporation, subtract the evaporated volume from V2.\nV\n2\n=",

This was found to be 10.70 μL. The difference is assumed to be experimental error caused from variance in calculations. The total volume introduced at the start of the assay is thus taken as 10.70 μL and not 10 μL in our experiments.\nCAFE assay setup for feeding rhythm\nTiming: setup, 20 min; assay time, 12 h\nCulture flies in corn-meal dextrose medium before the start of the experiment.\nFollow steps 1–10 from 3h feeding setup starting from ZT 01.\nTo assess the feeding rhythm, measure food intake at every 3-h intervals. We recommend using a new set of flies for every 3h time interval as the food available during the experiment is only sucrose and overtime this could affect the metabolism and thus food intake.\nCAFE assay for 2-choice feeding:\nTiming: setup, 20 min; assay time, 12 h\n2-choice feeding assay is conducted to determine the innate preference for food in flies. In the previous studies, 2-choice feeding assays were conducted on pre-starved flies.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] In our method, flies without any pre-conditioning are used. To test 2-choice feeding assay we used alcohol laced food along with sucrose. Although, alcohol was used here, the assay is malleable for other choices of food based on experimental needs.",
    "Introduce two different sources of 10μL of liquid food associated with different colors (red and green into the CAFE assay tubes.\nFollow steps 1–10 from 3h feeding protocol to calculate the fed volume.\nPost measuring the volume, further quantify the choice made by analyzing the abdomen color of the flies under the microscope. Based on the percentage of flies chosen under each color the choice preference is calculated."
