    "This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Fukuoka University, Japan (IRB No. 2017M017). Prior to participation, all patients provided written informed consent.\n1. Preparation of the fNIRS experiment\nNOTE: A multi-channel continuous-wave laser-based NIRS system for this experiment was used. The wavelengths of the near-infrared light were 780 nm, 805 nm, and 830 nm, and the sampling rate was set at 7.8 Hz. The time and spatial resolution (distances between the light emitter and detector probe) were 0.13 s and 3.0 cm, respectively.\nSet the fNIRS device in a dark noiseless place. Conduct experiments at room temperature. Start the fNIRS instrument 30 min before the experiment.\n\tNOTE: fNIRS systems are used under controlled temperature and humidity conditions to ensure stable operation of the equipment26.\nUse a whole head caps for fNIRS recording and attach the head cap on the subject's head such that the position corresponding to the central (Cz) of international 10-20 system is located at the holder No. 245 of the head cap. (Figure 1).\nAttach the marking sticker to reference locational points: the nasion (Nz), right external auditory meatus (AR), and left external auditory meatus (AL).\n\tNOTE: Because the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates are read around the positions of the Nz, AR, AL marking sticker and Cz holder, it is necessary to attach the marking sticker before taking a picture.\nAfter the calibration of a high-resolution digital camera for spatial registration, take pictures of the subject's head with the probe location while showing the reference points (Cz, Nz, AR, and LR) from 15 perspectives.",
    "NOTE: Please take a picture before placing the probe. If a picture is taken after placing the probe, the marker landmark may be hidden by the probe and wiring cord. As recommended by the manufacturer, after taking 12 pictures 30° diagonally forward to the right of the subject, take three or more pictures slightly above so that the Cz (holder No. 245) appears in the picture. This is because it is easy to make it three-dimensional when capturing a total of 15 or more shots.\nCarefully separate the subject's hair that interferes with the optode using a light-emitting diode (LED)-lit plastic rod to attach the probe. Arrange the probe so that the optodes are attached at a minimal distance from the scalp surface and in contact with the scalp.\n\tNOTE: Check carefully whether there is any pressure or discomfort for the patient due to the attachment of the optodes, because of increasing strength of the systemic confounders associated with autonomic nervous system activation23.\nArrange the 48-channel system with 32 optodes (16 light sources and 16 detectors; 4 x 4 array for each hemisphere) to a head cap bilaterally over the frontal and parietal areas as regions of interest (Figure 2).\nStart and use the 3D-digitizer software to determine the spatial registration.\nAfter scanning the picture data of an entire head, determine the spatial coordinate of each patient by auto-measuring and save as the Origin and the Others file (*CSV file).\n\t​NOTE: If the coordinate points could not be detected from the images using the automatic measurement, input the adjustment manually.\n2. Run the experiment",
    "Select a block design for the experiment, and the task can be any movement of interest for the study such as hand opening/closing, finger tapping, etc. In our previous study, the task was the robot-assisted elbow movements15.\n\tNOTE: Each cycle is made of three blocks (15 s of rest - 15 s of task - 15 s of rest), and each patient completes seven cycles in each session.\nMake the participant wait in a comfortable position until the starting signal. Instruct the subject to close their eyes during the rest and the task.\nGive start and stop cues (i.e., \"Repeat flexion and extension of the elbow\", \"Stop and relax\").\n\tNOTE: Do not speak during measurements. Carefully check for artifacts on the monitor screen during measurements.\nPerform the block design task in the same posture. Upright posture with standing or sitting position is desirable not to distort the headset.\n\tNOTE: If the patient feels uncomfortable after wearing the head holder for an extended period of time, remove or loosen the probe during robot-assisted exercise.\nAfter completing the NIRS measurement, remove the head holder and marking sticker to end the experiment.\n\t​NOTE: Carefully check for skin damage to the scalp due to prolonged wearing.\n3. Qualitative GLM analysis using NIRS-SPM software\nStart the NIRS-SPM on the MATLAB software. Convert the data file related to the change in HbO2 and HHb concentration acquired from the NIRS device to the file format for NIRS-SPM analysis.\nChoose the using NIRS system option from the pop-up menu. Select the load button and choose the convert HbO2 and HHb concentration change options.\nDetect the spatial registration of NIRS channel location. Select the Stand-alone checkbox and then select the With 3D Digitizer checkbox.",
    "Within From Real Coordinates to MNI Space, use the dialog box to choose _origin.CSV referring to the coordinate reference point file, and _others. CSV referring to the coordinate probes/channels file.\nSelect the Registration button. Choose the points to proceed to spatial estimation, and click on the OK button. Click on the Project MNI coordinate to Rendered Brain button.\n\tNOTE: The spatial position of the NIRS channel locations is estimated on the basis of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain template.\nSelect the Dorsal View option, and click on the Save button.\nIn the Specify the 1st Level section, select the NIRS data filename and SPM directory. Select the hemoglobin checkbox; HbO2 or HHb. Highlight the Specify design' option and select the Sec option. Highlight the Number of Condition/Trials options and enter the number 7.\nHighlight the Vector of Onset and Duration[s] options and enter a vector of onset multiplied by the duration of the experimental conditions as follows.\n\tNOTE: In this case, the vector of onset times should be specified as [15:45:285] or [15 60 105 150 195 240 285]. The vector of duration should be specified as [15* ones(7,1)] or [15 15 15 15 15 15 15].\nFor detrending, select the Wavelet-MDL button. Use the precoloring method: low-pass filter and select the hrf button, and correct for serial correlation, then select the none button.\nIn estimating the temporal correlations, check the Individual Analysis.\n\tNOTE: Save the spatial localization of fNIRS channel positions in the individual MNI coordinate systems as a text file. Similarly, save the map based on the individual Brodmann area (BA) as a text file.\nIn estimating the temporal correlations, check the Group Analysis. The NIRS-SPM aligned the mean optode positions of the number of participants according to the MNI standardized brain coordinate system.",
    "Compute the activation map based on the changes in hemoglobin level for the standardized brain. HbO2 and HHb levels were considered significant at an uncorrected threshold of p < 0.01.\n\t​NOTE: Left/right information was flipped in the right-affected sides for group analysis.\n4. Multi-channel comparative analysis based on hierarchical mixed model\nStart the SAS software. Convert the text document (.TXT) of concentration changes of HbO2 and HHb in the NIRS data file processed with a low pass filter (cut-off frequency was set at 0.1 Hz) to the spreadsheet software comma separated values file (.CSV).\nCreate the Import SAS data (.sas7bdat) using the program.\nOutput the Import file with the following command, libname out \"Import file\"\nOutput the pre- vs. post-intervention file for each subject, run the following commands in the Analysis SAS. (Figure 3) During the creation of the import file, give a name such that can identify the subject information and pre- vs. post-intervention (e.g., id1 pre, id1 post…)\nRun the pre- and post-intervention data command for each channel (ch1-48; HbO2 and HHb) as follows (Figure 4).\nBased on the data obtained from the output results, input the pre- vs. post-intervention differences in change (difference at on-task and rest), rest, and on-task values (estimated values, upper limits, and lower limits) of each channel in the spreadsheet workbook file (.xlsx).\nSimilarly, input the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom, F value, and P value of the interact item of the fixed-effect Type 3 test to the spreadsheet workbook file (.xlsx).\nTo control the false discovery rate (FDR) in multi-channel testing, use the Benjamin and Hochberg methods27 and control the FDR at a p-value < 0.01.\nSubscription Required.
