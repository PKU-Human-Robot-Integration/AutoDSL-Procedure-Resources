    "Firstly, a sterile coverslip was placed in the bottom of the culture dish (forceps may be helpful) where cells stuck from the very beginning. Macrophages were then carefully seeded in 1 ml of supplemented Locke's solution at a density of 300,000- 500,000 cells per 35 mm culture dish. Since they are non-dividing cells they were used in the following two or three days after seeded (likely, after this lapse time, macrophages will be completely adhered to coverslips). Extensive washing with 500 μl PBS 1X (three-four replicates) was used to ensure that cells were very adherent and alive. The percentage of apoptotic/necrotic cells after 3 days in culture was below 5% (determined by using the common Trypan Blue staining, see Notes).Note: Cell attaching to the coverslip is a critical step in order to perform the microfluorimetric analysis. If your plastic or glass interferes with the adherence of the macrophages, allow the support to dry with FCS (fetal calf serum) under the cabin to improve adherence. Avoid a high density cell culture. A 50-75% subconfluent culture with some cells interacting is desirable.Incubate macrophages in 1 ml supplemented Locke's solution loaded with 5-7 μM Fura-2-AM (dissolved in DMSO, following the datasheet instructions) for 45 min approximately at 37 °C. Incubation does NOT involve either shaking or agitation, just a short and slightly balancing.Wash thoroughly the culture monolayer with fresh 500 μl Locke's solution (serum also contains esterases that may degrade Fura-2-AM) and place the coverslip in a small superfusion chamber (34 μl volume). Junctions between the coverslip and the chamber are sealed with vacuum grease. Figure 1 depicts the superfusion chamber apparatus.Note: Locke’s media or products perfused to the chamber are regulated using a valve system that works by gravity.",
    "The perfusion solutions are maintained in a water bath at 37 °C and the flow rate is kept constant at 1.5 ml/min. The vacuum pump aspires continuously the perfusion media after arriving to the chamber to prevent the accumulation of the hydrolysis products.Figure 2 shows the experimental setup described here. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131205/20131205025837_7692.jpgFigure 1. The superfusion chamber system. In the upper side of the figure, we can appreciate the superfusion chamber and the microscope stage. Immediately below these two pictures, both pieces are already assembled. The coverslip should be placed in the circular hollow remaining in the center.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131205/20131205211328_1898.jpgFigure 2. Experimental equipment for Fura-2-AM registers. The temperature and the valve controllers, the fluorescence microscope (including its optical filter changer) and the necessary equipment to record the fluorescence images (the camera and its controller) are depicted above.Images of both control and treated cells are visualized using the Plan Fluor x20/0.5 objective of the microscope. In this regard, Fura-2-AM has entered the cell and intracellular esterases have hydrolyzed the compound providing free Fura-2 that senses Ca2+ with a high affinity. Fluorescence emission occurs in a broad range around 430 nm when the cells are excited at 340 nm.Note: In our study (Traves et al., 2013), macrophages were preincubated with different prostanoids for at least 10 min and then stimulated for 30 s with a variety of purinergic receptor agonists at near-maximal effective concentrations: 100 μM ATP, 100 μM UTP, 10 μM UDP, 10 μM 2MeSADP, 1,000 μM α,β-meATP or 300 μM BzATP.Excite cells for 300 ms at 340/380 nm (< 5 ms wavelength change) and select the emitted light using the dichroic mirror (430 nm) and a 510-nm band-pass filter.Note: The selection of these wavelengths matches with the maximum fluorescence registers for Fura-2 calcium-saturated solutions (340 nm) and calcium-free Fura-2 solutions (380 nm).",
    "Fluorescence images are acquired with the camera every 1.5 seconds and controlled by the software. Sampling frequency is 2 Hz."
