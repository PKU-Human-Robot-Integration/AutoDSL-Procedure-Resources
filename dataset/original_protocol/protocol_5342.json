    "SOP for bioelectrospray pre-infectionNote: This is the optimized protocol for encapsulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after overnight infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. If the organism of interest is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the reader should assume that the experiment is done under Class I/III biosafety cabinet in a standard biosafety level 3 lab under approved institutional standards of practice. If the work requires being undertaken in a standard biosafety level 2 lab, one can fumigate the whole machine according to the respective laboratory SOP before taking out from the BSL3 laboratory. The bioelectrospray technique is always performed in a Class I/III biosafety cabinet, with the doors of the bioelectrosprayer kept closed during microsphere generation as an extra level of containment. A Class II biosafety cabinet is inherently not safe to do the procedure. Once the microspheres are formed, they can be transferred for the subsequent steps either to Class II biosafety cabinet or continue in Class I/III biosafety cabinet. The protocol spans three days. Modification for other infections or other biological modelling is possible.Day-1Sterilize the following items in plastic beakers and dry them in an oven.Five 150 ml Borosilicate glass beakers with spout Magnetic stirrers (1 cm length) (5 pieces)Female Luer Thread Style Connectors Scissors Forceps (different sizes)Tissue paper Sterile silicon tubes with connector attached at the end (3 pieces, 45 cm in length)Prepare alginate suspension. Alginate is a natural product and there is variability on the product depending on the species of alginate and environmental conditions. In all studies our group have conducted so far, all the procedures were done with medium viscosity G dominant alginate with viscosity above 250 mPas. Prepare 3% alginate in HBSS without Ca/Mg, with phenol red under sterile conditions and mix it with the buffers to form alginate mix.",
    "Day-2Prepare the alginate-collagen matrix as in Recipe 2 (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170719/20170719232101_4947.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of cells for encapsulation. Cells are recovered from a 75 cm2 flask and pelleted in a Falcon by centrifugation, and then mixed with alginate-collagen matrix in a 7 ml bijou container (usually 25 million cells/5ml of matrix mix). Also see Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Mixing alginate with PBMCs prior to bioelectrospraying Extract PBMCs according to standard protocol for separating PBMCs from blood by density centrifugation. One can use either the buffy coat cells which are commercially available or whole blood isolated PBMCs. Before the final wash, re-suspend the cells in 50 ml of HBSS without Ca/Mg and take 15 µl of cell suspension for cell counting (dilute 10x further if working with leukocyte cones isolated from 500 ml blood). Place the re-suspended cells in the fridge until use. Count the cells, and calculate the total cells required for final concentration of 5 x 106 cells/ml once re-suspended in cell-alginate-mix. Pipette off appropriate number of isolated PBMCs and then pellet by spinning at 320 x g, 8 min, 4 °C, in a 50 ml Falcon tube. Discard supernatant and add 30 ml of complete RPMI medium (ampicillin, glutamine) to the PBMC pellet and re-suspend.Infect PBMCs with appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of Mtb (our experimental standard is MOI 0.1).Transfer the infected PBMCs into a 75 cm2 flask.Leave overnight in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.Day-3Preparation of cells for encapsulationNext day, take out the flask from the incubator; carefully transfer the contents of the flask (30 ml) to a 50 ml Falcon tube. Add 5 ml of 5 mM EDTA (or Versene, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the flask and incubate for 8-10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.",
    "After that time, add 5 ml of HBSS without Ca, Mg (or complete RPMI medium) to the flask to dilute the effect of the detachment solution.Scrape the bottom surface of the flask with a scraper carefully and lightly to re-suspend all remaining cells.Transfer the 10 ml contents to the same 50 ml Falcon tube, already containing the medium (total of 40 ml). Finally rinse flask with 10 ml of HBSS without Ca, Mg (or complete RPMI medium) and add to the Falcon.Pellet cells in the Falcon by centrifugation at 320 x g, 8 min.Carefully, take the Falcon tube out of centrifuge and decant supernatant. Re-suspend the pelleted cells: e.g., 50 µl per 5 x 106 cells.Prepare 5 ml alginate-collagen mix in a 7 ml bijou container. You can prepare alginate-collagen mix up to a week prior to the experiment (Video 1).Mix well your cells with the alginate-collagen mix accordingly in a 7 ml bijou container (Usually 25 million cells/5 ml of alginate).Keep at 4 °C on ice/in the fridge until bioelectrospraying the cell-alginate suspension.Bioelectrospray (Figures 2, 3 and 4)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170719/20170719232131_0875.jpgFigure 2.

Setting up the bioelectrospray system <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Bioelectrospray system in operation with microspheres being formed Adjust the syringe driver speed according to the diameter of the syringe (e.g., appropriate rate for 5 ml syringe to give 10 ml/h). The adjustment of the speed varies dependent on the syringe brand. Prepare the Borosilicate glass beaker by placing magnetic stirrer inside.Open the sterile silicon tubes and the nozzles and connect them to the bioelectrospray needle held in the arm of encapsulator.",
    "Run 50 ml HBSS without Ca/Mg through the tubing using a 20 ml syringe slowly into empty Borosilicate glass beaker. This will wash the system and check the connection of the needle in the encapsulator arm.Dry the arm with sterile tissue. Aspirate the cell-matrix mixture into a 5 ml syringe slowly. Alginate is very viscous and so this must be performed with patience. Avoid creating bubbles. The air enclosed will be ultimately end inside the microspheres, causing them to float.Connect the 5 ml syringe to the tube, and inject it slowly until it nears the bioelectrospray needle at the end.Pour 100 mM CaCl2 in HBSS (without Ca/Mg) into one of the beakers until it is half-full. Put beaker under the arm of encapsulator. Place the syringe in the syringe driver and ensure driving screw abuts end of syringe. Close the doors of the bioelectrosprayer fully.Start bioelectrospraying by turning on the voltage and stirrer of the encapsulator, and initiating the syringe pump at 10 ml/h. Alginate-collagen mix will be ejected through the needle and the spheroids will be collected in the gelling bath. We use 7 kV voltage and 70% stirring speed. The voltage, stirring speed, affects the diameter of the microspheres and alginate type and nozzle size and further information can be found in the work of Workman and colleagues (Workman et al., 2014).Safety Note: The electrostatic bead generator has an electric charge. Therefore, do not touch any parts when the generator is on to prevent exposure to high voltage (low current) electricity. Once the syringe contents have been fully expelled by syringe driver, it is necessary to drive alginate mix from tubing dead space through the bioelectrosprayer needle or continue with second batch of the cell-matrix suspension.",
    "Stop the bioelectrosprayer, replace the syringe with one containing 5 ml HBSS (without Ca/Mg), and recommence bioelectrosprayer and driver at 10 ml/h until all collagen-alginate mix is expelled and HBSS reaches the needle. This will be clear from colour and microspheres no longer form in gelling bath.Once all alginate is bioelectrosprayed, decant microspheres to 50 ml tubes by pouring. Allow them to settle and then remove as much supernatant CaCl2 solution from the Falcon as possible to the waste bottle with a 5 ml pipette. Microspheres take about 2 min to settle and so centrifugation is not required, and may damage the spheres (Figure 5).Add HBSS with Ca, Mg to the microspheres to total volume 50 ml. Stand Falcons in racks. Wash the microspheres 2 x by removing HBSS with Ca, Mg with a pipette and then adding again (Video 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170719/20170719232156_2934.jpgFigure 5. Microspheres in HBSS with Ca/Mg after transferred from the gelling bath. Also see Video 4.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Decanting microspheres after generation Aliquot microspheres to the appropriate tissue culture plate or sterile Eppendorf tubes. Aliquoting is performed using a 1 ml pipette with the end cut off with sterile scissors, to give an orifice sufficiently large to pipette up microspheres. Keep the Falcon with microspheres agitated during pipetting to keep a constant concentration within the media and avoid settling during aliquoting.Pipette off HBSS from wells/Eppendorfs to leave microspheres only.Add RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% AB serum, and incubate at 37 °C for the duration of the experiments. Each microsphere has ~600 µm diameter and the viability of the cells after a complete procedure is 95%. If setting up a second experimental condition (e.g., uninfected cells, different cell augmentation), then replace silicone tube and repeat steps as above.",
    "A maximum of 8 experimental conditions can be readily undertaken in one day. One should plan 1 h per 5 ml matrix, giving a total of up to 10 h for the final generation of microspheres.De-capsulation of cellsAspirate the microspheres into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and allow them to settle at the bottom of the tube. Then discard the supernatant carefully.Wash the microspheres with HBSS without Ca/Mg twice. Let the microspheres settle at the bottom of the tube, then remove the supernatant.Add 10 ml de-capsulating solution to the capsules. Mix the suspension thoroughly prior to incubation at room temperature up to 15 min. Shake the microspheres intermittently.When the microspheres are completely de-capsulated, their absence is visible with the naked eye. Fill the remaining tube with HBSS without Ca/Mg (or complete RPMI) at room temperature.Centrifuge the de-capsulated cells to pellet them at 320 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.Wash the cell pellet by re-suspending in HBSS followed by centrifugation. Further use of collagenase is usually not necessary. The de-capsulated cells can be further cultured as a monolayer or used for downstream analysis."
