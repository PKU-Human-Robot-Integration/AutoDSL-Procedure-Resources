  "procedures": [
    "1. Supply Preparation (not in video)\nPrepare a fresh 1X dilution of Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep) in 1X PBS. No more than 50 mL is necessary. Filter with a 0.22 μm syringe filter.\nPrepare injection constructs by combining desired plasmid constructs. We put all constructs in the pCAG-Flag vector with appropriate stoichiometry to a final volume of ~10 μL. Also, pCAG-GFP14 or pCAG-mCherry should be added for tracking electroporation efficiency and electroporated cells. We use pCAG-mCherry for this experiment. Lastly, add 0.22 μm-filtered Fast Green dye into the plasmid DNA mixture at a final concentration of 0.05% to visualize the injection efficiency into embryonic chick midbrains.\n2. Egg Preparation (in video)\nIn order to acquire HH stage 11 embryos, eggs need to be incubated at 100 °F (37.8 °C) for about 41 hours after fertilization with 25-40% humidity. Place eggs on their side and mark the top of each with a pencil dash. Place trays in a pre-warmed, humidified incubator. Slowly rock eggs by setting the turning function of incubator platforms to \"Automatic.\" Check the humidity and water level every 24 hours.\nRight before starting the experiment, remove eggs from the incubator and leave at room temperature. This will help to slow down the development and prevent over development.\nClean the surface of each egg with 70% ethanol and wipe down with a Kimwipe.\nTake two 4 cm pieces of scotch tape and stick them side-by-side on the egg to make a large rectangle over the pencil dash. Smooth the tape against the egg. This is where the window will be made. The tape will prevent small pieces of eggshell from falling off when the window is cut open.",
    "Use a 10 mL syringe and 18½ gauge needle to draw 5 mL of albumin out of the egg. After piercing the shell, angle the needle away from the yolk as to not disturb or damage the embryo while removing albumin. Clean the needle with 70% ethanol between eggs, but be sure the needle is dry before piercing the next egg.\n3. Glass Injection Needle Preparation (in video)\nInjection needles are made using the following settings on a Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instrument Model P-97): Heat 670, Pull 120, Vel 40, Time 165. World Precision Instruments (API) 4 inch 1.0 mm thin wall capillary glass (API TW100F-4) is used to make needles.\nLoad a pulled glass needle using a P10 pipette and the long-tip capillary loading pipette tip (Eppendorf 5242956.003). Load 5-10 μL, depending on how many eggs are to be injected. Fill the glass needle slowly, creating a continuous column of plasmid solution absent of air bubbles.\nPlace the loaded needle in the needle holder attached to the micromanipulator (Narishige MM3) and the Picospritzer III microinjector. View the needle under a dissection microscope and trim the needle at the point where the green fluid stops. It helps to use a dark background to better visualize the needle. Proper needle trimming comes with practice.\n4. Midbrain/Neural Tube Injection (in video)\nUse spring scissors to cut a 2-2.5 cm diameter window in the egg. Start the window from the previous needle hole made when drawing albumin, and rotate the egg in your hand as you cut. Be sure to clean off the scissors with a Kimwipe saturated in 70% ethanol between eggs.",
    "View chick embryos under a dissection microscope. It may be necessary to train the eyes. It may help to visualize the embryo by injecting 0.22 μm-filtered 20% India ink in PBS under the chick embryo. However, we have found that this step should be avoided if possible, as it tends to decrease survival.\nInjection works best if the embryo is positioned in parallel to the path of the needle, with the head away from the needle. Slowly pierce the neural tube at a 45 degree angle to the midbrain-hindbrain junction. It is very critical to only fill the neural vesicle representing the midbrain with plasmid DNA and Fast Green dye, without significant diffusion into the forebrain and hindbrain regions. Start injecting with the Picospritzer microinjector's duration set at 25 ms; this may need to be changed depending on needle trimming. In general, use between 10-50 ms.\n5. Electroporation (in video)\nRetrieve the injection needle. Place 3 drops of 1X Pen/Strep in PBS solution in the egg on the embryo.\nCheck the settings of the BTX EMC830 electroporator:\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nVOLTAGE:,20 V\nPULSE LENGTH:,25 ms\n#PULSES:,3\nINTERVAL:,500 ms\nPOLARITY:,UNIPOLAR",
    "Place the 2 mm long L-shaped platinum electrodes at the same horizontal level as the bottom of the neural tube, with the embryonic midbrain sitting in the middle between two 3 mm apart electrodes. Aligning the electrodes with the bottom of the neural tube is critical for efficient electroporation of the ventral midbrain. To achieve midbrain-specific electroporation, we replaced the original BTX electrodes with two custom-made platinum L-shaped electrodes with short 2 mm long tips. These platinum electrodes are made of 0.5mm diameter platinum wires (Alfa Aesar). These platinum electrodes are just long enough to cover the midbrain of a stage 11 chick embryo, which is about 0.9 mm long, without targeting much of the forebrain or the hindbrain regions. Press the BTX footswitch once. Air bubbles should be generated around the electrodes with each successful electroporation. Carefully remove the electrodes from the egg and wipe the electrodes off with a 70% ethanol-covered Kimwipe. Place another 3 drops of 1X Pen/Strep solution in the egg, on the embryo.\nCover the window with a 5 cm x 5 cm piece of clear packaging tape. Be sure to seal the egg well and that the egg contents do not come in contact with the tape.\n6. Incubate and Harvest\nPlace the eggs back into the incubator. Make sure the turning of incubator platforms is OFF. Incubate eggs until the desired HH stage 23 is achieved.\nHarvest living embryos and place them into common PBS-filled Petri dishes for each condition. Screen harvested embryos under a fluorescent dissection microscope, keeping only embryos with mCherry expression.\nTransfer embryos into individual wells of a 24-well dish. Fill each well with 1 mL of freshly made 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and allow to fix 2-3 hours at 4 °C.",
    "Wash fixed embryos three times for 10 minutes each in PBS. Place embryos sequentially in 15% and 30% sucrose until equilibrated. Embryos will initially float in sucrose, but will sink upon equilibration.\nCheck embryos under a fluorescent dissection microscope, taking notes on the mCherry expression pattern and level for each embryo. Embed each embryo in OCT. It is very critical to orient embryos properly to generate optimal midbrain cross sections for subsequent analyses (Figure 1).\nPrepare 18 μm thick midbrain sections using a Leica CM3050S cryostat. Analyze midbrain development and dopaminergic neuron differentiation by immunostaining with appropriate cell type markers.\n7. Representative Results\nA diagrammatic representation of electroporating and analyzing embryonic chick midbrain is shown in Figure 1. In successfully injected and electroporated chick embryos, mCherry expression should be visible in the midbrain region after further development (Figure 2A, B, C). Assuming that mCherry correlates with the expression of other co-electroporated genes, embryos exhibiting proper mCherry expression can then be fixed and embedded to prepare midbrain cryosections for further study (Figure 2D). Generally, about 50% of ventral midbrain neural progenitors can be efficiently transfected with the above protocol. The specification of dopaminergic fate in electroporated neural progenitors can be examined by the co-localization of mCherry, Flag-tagged gene, with dopaminergic neuron markers such as Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) (Figure 3). The patterning of progenitor domains in ventral midbrain can be investigated by co-immnostaining cryosections with different progenitor domain markers.\nInsufficient mCherry expression suggests that ectopic genes are likely not efficiently expressed. Embryos under this condition should not be used for further studies. Similarly, embryos that did not survive to the end of the experimental procedure can't be used for data collection and analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4017/4017fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1.  Illustration of the embryonic chick midbrain in ovo electroporation assay. HH stage 11 embryonic chick embryos are injected with pCAG-mCherry together with genes of interest mixed with fast green to visualize the injection process (A). After filled with DNA constructs, midbrains are electroporated with a square wave electroporator. Embryos are further incubated until desired HH stage 23 is reached. Then mCherry-positive embryos are harvested, fixed, and embedded (B). Midbrain cryosections are prepared with cutting planes indicated by the white line in Figure 1B, and analyzed by immunostaining with midbrain markers such as Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) (C).
