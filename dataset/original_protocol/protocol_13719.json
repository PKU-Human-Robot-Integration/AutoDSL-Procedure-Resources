    "1. Pellets preparation\nPrepare the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) molds by performing circular-shaped holes of known dimensions in PVC plates.\n\tNOTE: PVC moldings can be made of different sizes. Calculate the contact surface of PVC molds, using the formula A= h(2πr)+2πr2 (r: radius of the cylinder; h: height of the cylinder).\nPrepare the biomaterial to be tested according to the manufacturer's instructions and as close as possible to the beginning of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: For the preparation of paste/paste formulation biomaterials, an adequate amount of base paste and catalyst are mixed manually with a mixing spatula. For other materials based on liquid and powder formulations, manual spatulation or mechanical mixing with vibration should be performed, following the manufacturer's instructions or the adequate for new materials. For liquid materials, this step is not necessary. Start the protocol in step 2.\nPlace the biomaterial on the molds with a spatula and let them set for the appropriate time.\n\tNOTE: The setting time and setting conditions of the biomaterials must follow the manufacturer's instructions or the adequate for new materials.\nAfter setting, remove the biomaterial’ pellets from the PVC molds and place them in a container (a 6 well plate or a Petri dish can be used).\nSterilize the pellets by placing them under an ultraviolet light (UV) lamp for 20 minutes for each side.\n2. Obtaining the biomaterials' extracts\nNOTE: All procedures should be performed under strict sterile conditions.\nDetermine the necessary number of pellets by calculating the pellet surface area based on the formula described in 1.1.\n\tNOTE: As a reference value, the contact surface area of 250 mm2/mL11,15 is achieved by adding 9 pellets (r 3 mm x h 1.5 mm) per mL of the medium.\nPrepare the soluble extracts (extract enriched with the biomaterial).",
    "Place the pellets in a 50 mL tube and add the corresponding of the cell culture medium. Place the tubes for 24 hours in the incubator at 37°, in constant rotation.\n\t\tNOTE: Use the cell culture medium appropriate for the cell cultures.\nAfter 24 hours, remove the tubes from the incubator. At this point, the extracts correspond to a concentration of 1/1 or 100%.\nMake dilutions of the extract by sequential addition of equal volumes of conditioned medium to cell culture medium.\n\t\tNOTE: No pH adjustment should be made to the media.\n\t\t\nAdd 1 mL of culture media to 1 mL of 100% extract to obtain a 50% extract. Add 1 mL of culture media to 1 mL of 50% extract to obtain a 25% extract, and so on (Figure 1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use the concentrations found relevant for each compound.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61512/61512fig1v2.jpg\nFigure 1: Scheme of the preparation and dilutions of soluble extracts.

As a reference value for seeding density, consider 5 – 20 x 105 cells/cm2.\n\t\tNOTE: The appropriated number of cells must be calculated according to the cell type and cell characteristics, namely cell doubling time.\nIncubate the cells for 24 hours to allow cell adhesion.\nAfter this period, administer the soluble extracts into the culture plates.\n\t\nAspirate the cell culture medium.\nAdd the biomaterials’ extracts to each well, according to the sequence of concentrations, as described previously. Add fresh cell culture medium to the control wells.\nIncubate the plates for 24 h or longer.\n\t\tNOTE: Negative controls must be performed in each assay, corresponding to untreated cells, maintained in the culture medium. The incubation times can be selected accordingly to the study goals.\n4.
