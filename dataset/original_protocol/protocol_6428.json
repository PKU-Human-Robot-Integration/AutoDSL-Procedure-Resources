    "By using an ion exchange protocol (basically installed in AKTA start as “IEX exchange”), wash the column loaded with IEX-A buffer, and elute proteins by gradient mixing of IEX-A and IEX-B buffer.Determine the peak fractions of MinE-mCherry-His by SDS-PAGE, and use the peak fractions further.To exchange the buffer with Storage buffer, transfer the eluted solution to AmiconUltra-15 10k filters.Add 8 ml of storage buffer.Centrifuge the device at 4,000 x g at 4 °C. Concentrate the solution less than 2 ml (generally, 30 min-60 min continuous centrifugation is needed).Repeat Steps A3m-A3n (total 5-6 times).Transfer the concentrated solution to AmiconUltra-0.5 10k filters.Centrifuge the device at 14,000 x g at 4 °C to concentrate the solution less than 0.1 ml (generally, it takes 30 min).Estimate protein purity and concentrations by CBB staining after separating by SDS-PAGE (see quantification by CBB staining) and BCA assay (according to the manufacturer’s procedure).Adjust protein concentration of the purified protein at 100 μM by the storage buffer and store the protein at -80 °C before usage (Note 4).Washing BSATake 100~200 mg BSA in 15 ml centrifuge tubes.Add the 10 ml of MQ water to the tube and dissolve BSA by vortexing.Transfer the BSA solution to AmiconUltra-15 50k filters.Centrifuge the device at 4,000 x g at 4 °C to concentrate the solution less than 2 ml (generally, it takes 30-60 min).Add 8 ml of RE buffer.Repeat Steps A4d-A4e (total 5-6 times).Concentrate the solution less than 2 ml by centrifugation at 4,000 x g at 4 °C.Transfer concentrated solution to AmiconUltra-0.5 50k filters.Centrifuge the device at 14,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min to further concentrate the solution less than 0.3 ml.Estimate protein concentrations by BCA assay (according to the manufacturer’s procedure).Store the BSA solution in the storage buffer at RT before usage (typically 300-400 mg/ml.",
    "BSA solution should renew once in a month.Protein quantification by CBB stainingLoad samples and dilution series of BSA (200, 400, 600, 800, 1,000 ng) on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels (by 12.5% or 15% acrylamide with 1/37.5 of N,N'-Methylenebisacrylamide for His-sfGFP-MinD or MinE-mCherry-His, respectively).Run SDS-PAGE (typically, 20 mA, 60 min).Stain the gels by CBB solution at room temperature for 30 min.Remove redundant dye by immersing the gels in water at room temperature for 30 minTake the image of CBB stained gels by ChemDoc touch MP.Measure band intensities of BSA by Fiji software to construct a standard curve (Note 6).Quantify the amount of the sample loaded by measuring band intensity and using the standard curve (Note 6).Convert the amount to the concentration of proteins.Self-organization assay inside lipid dropletsPreparation of lipid oilThe general protocol for microdroplets preparation was followed according to a previous report (Fujiwara and Yanagisawa, 2014). Add 20 µl of 25 mg/ml E. coli polar lipid extract (dissolved in chloroform and stored at -30 °C, total 1 mg) into a round glass microtube (Maruemu Glass microtube No.2) (Figure 1A, Note 7).Dry up the lipid solution under gentle argon gas flow (Figures 1B-1D, Notes 7-9).Add 1 ml mineral oil to the dried lipid film to be 1 mg/ml (Note 7).Seal the glass tubes by DuraSeal.Sonicate the lipid tube to dissolve lipids with the mineral oil for 90 min at 60 °C by using Bransonic.Vortex the sonicated lipid oil for 1 min at room temperature.Store the lipid oil at room temperature and must use in the day. Do not chill on ice or storage in refrigerators.Microdroplets preparationMake the reaction mixture consisted of 1 µM (0.58 mg/ml) His-sfGFP-MinD, 1 µM (0.38 mg/ml) MinE-mCherry-His, 2.5 mM ATP, 100 mg/ml washed BSA in RE buffer in a 0.2 ml tube.",
    "Add 100 μl of lipid oil into a 0.6 ml tube and pour 2 μl of the reaction mixture to the lipid oil (Figure 2A).Gently tapping the tube about 10 times for emulsification (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316021822_4015.jpgFigure 1.

After emulsification.Observation of self-organization of Min proteins inside the microdropletsPrepare two cover glasses (we use 25 mm x 36 mm and 18 mm x 18 mm) to make a coverslip chamber by using a double-sided tape (about 90 µm thickness) as spacers (Figure 3).Gently place a portion of the emulsion (15 μl) into the coverslip chamber (Note 10).Observe self-organization of Min proteins inside the droplets by fluorescent microscope by 5-20 s intervals for 5 min or more at room temperature (ca. 25 °C). Generally, the exposure time was set to 500 ms for both GFP and mCherry. Generally, Min waves are very stable and continue at least 10 h. Thus, we can observe Min waves in many different (at least 10) positions with one coverslip chamber. A representative result is shown in Video 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316022019_6123.jpgFigure 3.
