    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section provides detailed steps to acquire porcine vitreous samples and analyze alterations in the gel-liquid ratio after enzyme activity. The dissection is performed to maintain the vitreous structure without other attached tissues (e.g., iris or retina), thus reducing sample contamination and enzyme cross-effect. A transwell-plate system is used to separate the liquid from the gel, minimizing sample loss to obtain accurate measurements of liquefaction changes.\nPorcine eye dissection\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe described protocol is key to obtaining viable vitreous samples with proper scalability and reaching eight samples with approximately 370 μL each (standard deviation about 65 μL). Keep the porcine eyes that are not being dissected at 4°C (or on ice) to minimize tissue damage. Prepare and organize the surgical tools prior to the procedure (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). For self-protection, the researcher should follow the following safety recommendations. Use appropriate personal protective equipment, such as gloves and a closed lab coat during the experiment. To minimize exposure to potential biological hazards, the ocular surface should be decontaminated with antiseptics, such as povidone-iodine, followed by washing with DPBS. In addition, we highlight the step of the first incision using the scalpel because there is high risk for injury if the eyeball is not held securely. The steps of the dissection are demonstrated in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2058-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dissection of vitreous samples from porcine eyes\n(A) Instruments needed for dissection.\n(B) Remove remaining conjunctival and muscle tissue in the area between the limbus and 5–6 mm posterior to the limbus.",
    "(C) Make the first incision 3–4 mm posterior to the limbus using a surgical scalpel with blade size 11. Use the wall of the dish and a tweezer to stabilize the eyeball and make sure that the force you apply with the scalpel points to the center of the eye to prevent it from rotating.\n(D) Insert a scissor into the incision and cut 360 degrees at 3–4 mm parallel to the limbus to separate the anterior from the posterior part of the eye. Use a tweezer to hold the opened edge of the anterior segment to facilitate separation.\n(E) Next, hold the anterior and posterior parts with one tweezer each and gently pull them apart. During this process, the vitreous should adhere to the anterior part and detach from the retina.\n(F) Hold up the anterior part with the vitreous using a tweezer and use a second tweezer to carefully separate the vitreous from the structures of the anterior segment. The iris, ciliary body and lens should remain with the anterior segment.\n(G and H) Cut the vitreous in eight equally sized parts using a razor blade. If this does not completely divide the vitreous, a small tweezer can be used to carefully move the vitreous relative to the blade.\n(I) Transfer each vitreous sample in a labeled tube using a tweezer. Store the samples on ice.\nTo decontaminate the ocular surface:\nPlace the porcine eye in a 50 mL falcon tube containing povidone-iodine for 3 min.\nTransfer it to a tube with DPBS to wash off remaining antiseptics.\nTransfer the porcine eye to a 100 mm × 15 mm petri dish plate.",
    "With clean forceps, hold the eye at the sclera or adjacent conjunctival tissue, and wash the eye from the cornea towards the posterior part of the globe 3 times with 1,000 μL DPBS using a 1,000 μL pipette.\nNote: This step removes remaining external contaminants (e.g., dust, dirt, or non-ocular tissue debris from enucleation).\nTransfer the eye to a fresh plate. Using scissors, remove conjunctival and muscle tissue in the area between the limbus and 5–6 mm posterior to the limbus to facilitate access to the sclera (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Avoid damaging the sclera while cutting the conjunctiva.\nUsing a clean surgical scalpel with a new, sharp blade (size 11), make the first incision 3–4 mm posterior of the limbus (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2058-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Performing the incision in the porcine eye\n(A) The incision must be performed between 3 to 4 mm from the limbus. Frontal view of the eye.\n(B) Coronal section of the eye.\nNote: Use the wall of the dish and a tweezer to stabilize the eyeball. Make sure that the force you apply with the scalpel points to the center of the eye to prevent it from rotating (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCritical: The sclera is thick and rigid, making it hard to penetrate with the scalpel blade. There is a high chance for injury if the eyeball is not held securely.\nCritical: The location of the first incision site is critical for the clean separation of the vitreous from the other ocular tissues. The location closer to the limbus may result in the vitreous staying intact with the posterior segments (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]). The location farther from the limbus has a higher chance of fragmenting the vitreous tissues into small pieces.",
    "Insert scissors into the incision and cut 360 degrees in the sclera at 3–4 mm parallel to the limbus (see blue dotted line in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) to separate the anterior from the posterior segment of the eye.\nNote: Use forceps to hold the opened edge of the anterior segment to facilitate separation.\nNote: Always having one of the instruments inside the eye can help to facilitate dissection; when the tweezer is not holding the sclera, the tip of the scissors should keep the incision open (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nHold each anterior and posterior part with forceps and gently pull them apart. During this process, the vitreous should adhere to the anterior part and detach from the retina (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nNote: Retina tissue detached from the posterior segment may cover the vitreous tissues (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]). Gently remove the attached retinal tissue to minimize contamination.\nUse forceps to lift and hold the anterior segment with the vitreous, and use a second pair of tweezers to carefully separate the vitreous from the structures of the anterior segment.\nNote: Rotating the anterior segment and utilizing natural gravity pull-down can facilitate the separation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nNote: The iris, ciliary body and lens should remain with the anterior segment with a proper incision made in steps 3 and 4. However, it is possible that fragmented iris tissue may follow the vitreous tissue (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nWith a razor blade, cut the vitreous into four to eight equally sized parts.\nNote: If this does not completely divide the vitreous, small forceps can be used to carefully move the vitreous relative to the blade (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H).\nTransfer each vitreous sample to the labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using forceps.\nCritical: Use tubes from the same batch to avoid large weight differences in the next steps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).",

Porcine eye dissection, related to porcine eye dissection, steps 1–10\nQuantification of vitreous liquefaction\nTiming: 6–7 h\nThis part of the protocol describes the process of enzyme incubation and gel-liquid separation. A transwell-plate based system was used to induce vitreous syneresis and precisely measure the relative enzymatic changes in the gel and liquid with scalability and minimal sample loss. Note that the inter-pig eye variability in control samples is slightly higher than the intra-pig eye variability: the standard deviation of each comparison group was ∼6.9% and ∼1.5%, respectively. Therefore, we recommend distributing the samples from one eye across all experimental conditions to minimize overall variability and using at least 10 replicates per condition. Both inter- and intra-pig eye variability may increase in enzyme-treated testing groups compared to control groups. For example, our collagenase-treated samples had standard deviation of ∼13.9% for inter-pig eye comparisons and ∼8.1% deviation for intra-pig eye comparisons. These changes in variability may depend on specific assay conditions and enzymes being tested, thus we recommend investigating the inter- and intra-pig eye variabilities for each different enzyme before interpreting the results.\nWith a pipette, inject 100 μL of enzyme solution in the center of each vitreous sample in the microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: We used each following enzymes in ten replicates: collagenase (0.5 mg/mL), trypsin (2.0 mg/mL), hyaluronidase (1.0 mg/mL), or your target enzyme. Use DPBS as a control.",
    "Note: Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for optimal and maximum storage conditions of each enzyme. As suggested by the manufacture, the enzymes used in this protocol should be stored under the following conditions: collagenase: −20°C for up to one year, trypsin −20°C for up to one year, hyaluronidase: −20°C (maximum storage time unspecified).\nIncubate the samples in closed microcentrifuge tubes at 37°C for 3 h.\nNote: 37°C is the optimal temperature for the selected enzymes’ activity (information provided in the products’ description).\nWeigh each sample in the tube using a laboratory milligram scale with a windshield.\nBriefly centrifuge the tubes for 1–2 s using the table minicentrifuge to precipitate condensed fluid from the top of the tubes.\nIn case you use more than one transwell plate, label the plate with a number and prepare a table indicating which enzyme is in each well.\nTransfer the samples from the tube to the inlet (apical side) of the transwell using a 1,000 μL pipette (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2058-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Using the transwell-plate system\n(A) Upload the vitreous sample in the inlet and centrifuge the transwell. Insert the pipette tip in one of lateral openings of the inlet to reach the collection well and remove the fluid part. When there is no more fluid in the collection well, remove the gel part using a cut pipette tip.\n(B) Empty inlet.\n(C) Standard pipette tip.\n(D) Pipette tip diagonally cut for gel transference.\n(E) Bend the transwell system and remove the liquid part in the collection system using one of the holes in the inlet.\nNote: Cut 3 mm of the tip of the pipette diagonally to increase tip diameter and allow easier transfer of the gel (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).",
    "Alternatives: Centrifugation filter tubes (e.g., Corning centrifuge tube filters #8163) might also be used for gel-liquid separation (comparable pore size and membrane material). However, the maximum volume which can be transferred to the centrifugation tubes is 500 μL. Since some samples (+100 μL enzyme) will have a larger volume (with 8 samples per eye), the tubes can only be an alternative for samples with a total volume below 500 μL. In addition, the centrifugation parameter may need to be modified.\nBriefly centrifuge the tubes using the benchtop centrifuge and use a 200 μL pipette tip to transfer the residual sample to the inlet.\nNote: The residual fluid has a low viscosity and can be transferred easily using the 200 μL pipette tip.\nCritical: To reduce the total loss in the system, it is important to transfer as much fluid as possible from the tube to the inlet.\nCentrifuge the transwell plate at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the fluid from the collection well using a 1,000 μL pipette without removing the inlet from the well and transfer the fluid to a new labeled tube.\nNote: The pipette tip can reach the collection well through one of the lateral openings in the inlet. During this process, hold the transwell plate at 20° to accumulate the liquid on one site of the collection well (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nCritical: To reduce the total loss in the system, transfer as much fluid as possible.\nCentrifuge the transwell plate again at 300 × g for 5 min to separate the remaining liquid from the gel vitreous.",
    "Note: Our experiments revealed that the above-mentioned centrifugation parameters (300 × g for 5 min) demonstrated clear differences between control and enzyme treated samples without a significant disruption of the vitreous gel structure in control samples. Researchers might consider changing centrifugation parameters (e.g., other tissues or other enzymes with a weaker effect on liquefaction) (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nFor a second time, remove the fluid from the collection well as described in step 19, and transfer it to the same labeled tube.\nTransfer the gel from the inlets to a new labeled tube using a pipette with a diagonally cut 1,000 μL tip (opening diameter should be around 3 mm; Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, 4C, and 4D).\nNote: If the vitreous cannot be sucked into the tip, try to increase the diameter of the tip’s opening.\nCritical: The inlet membrane is fragile; do not apply force towards it, otherwise the membrane will be perforated, increasing sample loss (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nCritical: It is critical that as much gel as possible is transferred from the inlet to the labeled tube.\nWeigh the tubes to determine gel and liquid weight separately for each sample.\nUse the sample immediately for analysis (e.g., analysis of cleavage products, or structural analysis).\nOptional: If the same vitreous is being used for further experiments, store the tubes at −80°C."
