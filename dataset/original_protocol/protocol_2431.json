All the experiments including animals were conducted under the approved protocol.\nTake the neonatal heart dissociation kit and prepare the enzyme mixture and enzyme mixture 2 as shown below and place both mixtures immediately on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2066_1.csv\nNote: After preparing the solutions of lyophilized powders supplied, prepare aliquots of 20 mL to avoid repeated freeze-thaw-cycles and then store aliquots at –20°C. This will let solutions stable for 6 months after reconstitution.\nAdd sterile PBS in a 50 mL Falcon tube and place it on ice in the eskie.\nAdd sterile complete DMEM in a 50 mL Falcon tube and place it on ice.\nHarvest the hearts from neonatal mice (up to 10).\nTake a mouse and cut its head with sterile sharp scissor.\nMake an incision from neck to upside down.\nCut the heart and put in ice-cold PBS Falcon tube. Do this for all mice.\nClose the Falcon tube and gently vortex the tube to remove blood.\nNote: To avoid the contamination of hearts use sterilized scissors and spray well the surrounding benchtop with 70% ethanol.\nAt this point, take the enzyme mixture 1 and incubate it at 37°C for 5 min in a 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator.\nThen, spray well eskie with ethanol and place it under Biosafety cabinet (BSC).\nNow, remove hearts from PBS with a plastic pipette and place them in a petri dish.\nThen, quickly remove fat tissues from the hearts and chop them with a sharp blade into 1–2 mm3 pieces.\nThen transfer chopped hearts into the gentleMACS C Tube.",
    "Note: C tubes can be leaky if not sealed properly and can lead to contamination around the cap, therefore, the tube must be perfectly clean and tightly closed for proper functionality of the seal. In order to avoid sticking of the chopped heart pieces in C tube, invert the C tube and then tap it down a few times to bring all the content below.\nRemove enzyme mixture 1 from the incubator and mix 2362.5 μL of the solution with 137.5 μL of enzyme mixture 2 to make 2.5 mL of total enzyme solution.\nAdd 2.5 mL of enzyme solution to the C Tube and close it tightly.\nInvert the C tube and incubate it for 15 min in the 5% CO2 cell culture incubator at 37°C.\nAfter 15 min, attach C Tube onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS dissociator and run the gentleMACS program mr_neoheart_01.\nNote: mr_neoheart_01 is a standard program of 37 s set up by the manufacturer for neonatal murine hearts which is critical for enzymatic digestion.\nThen, repeat steps 12 and 13 three more times to complete 4 cycles each of 15 min incubation and 37 s gentleMACS dissociation.\nAfter the program finishes, detach C Tube from the gentleMACS dissociator and add 7.5 mL of complete DMEM to resuspend the chopped hearts.\nStrain the cell suspension with a 70 μm strainer by placing it on a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nWash the strainer in the same tube with 3 mL of complete DMEM.\nThen, centrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant completely and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL complete DMEM.",
    "Count the total number of cells including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells by mixing trypan blue and cell suspension (in 1:1 ratio) under the Olympus microscope using a hemocytometer.\nThen adjust the volume of cell suspension with complete DMEM to plate 15 μL of 30,000 mice cardiac cells per well in a 384 well HDC plate (Sharma et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPipette 15 μL of cell suspension into each well of the 384 well HDC plate either manually or by using a robotic multichannel pipette for automated liquid handling (Sharma and Gentile, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPipette 1.5 mL of sterile PBS in each side of the channel around the Hanging Drop. (See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nReplace the media every 2–3 days until mouse CSs are formed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2066-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Cardiac spheroid formation from mouse and human cells\n(A and B) Formation of CSs (A) Brightfield image of mCS on Day 6 and (B) Brightfield Image of hCS on Day 10. Scale Bar: 100 μM.\nNote: The volume of enzyme mixtures 1 and 2 remains the same for the number of mice up to 10.\nCritical: The number of mice is directly proportional to the number of cardiac cells. Therefore, to have a high yield of cardiac cells it is critical to use the number of mice closer to the upper range. Ideally, 5 mice of 2–3 days old produce a good yield of cells to generate CSs.\nGeneration of human CSs\nTiming: 10 days\nFor a complete procedure on generation of Human CSs including plating, collection of iCMs, HCFs, and HCAECs please refer to (Sharma and Gentile, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nTo plate HCFs and HCAECs, thaw commercially available cryovials 37°C.\nThen, transfer cell suspensions from the cryovials to separate T25 culture flasks.",
    "Note: For maximum collection of cells, rinse cryovials twice with 1 mL of culture medium from the same 15 mL tube.\nAdd 7 mL of each HCFG and HMECG media to HCFs and HCAECs respectively. Incubate cells at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAfter 18 h, rinse cells with sterile PBS to remove freezing the medium and dead cells.\nThen, replace PBS with 8 mL of appropriate culture medium in each culture flask and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nExamine cellular expansion and viability regularly and replace media every other day until cells reach 80%–90% confluency.\nThen, collect one iCMs cryovial and place it in a water bath at 37°C for 4 min.\nThen, transfer the iCMs from the cryovial to a 50 mL centrifuge tube using a 1 mL pipette tip.\nRinse the empty iCMs cryovial with 1 mL of room temperature plating medium to recover residual cells. Transfer this 1 mL suspension drop-wise over 90 s to the 50 mL centrifuge tube containing the iCMs cell suspension.\nNote: Gently swirl the tube while adding the medium to mix the solution completely and to decrease the osmotic shock on the thawed cells.\nNow, slowly add 8 mL of room temperature Plating Medium to the 50 mL centrifuge tube. Add the first 1 mL dropwise over 30–60 s. Then, add the remaining volume over the next 30 s.\nNote: Gently swirl the centrifuge tube while adding the Plating Medium. Gently mix the contents of the 50 mL centrifuge tube by inverting 2–3 times (avoiding vigorous shaking or vortexing).\nThen, count the cells immediately with a hemocytometer and check the viable cell density (cells/mL).\nThen, take the fibronectin pre-coated T25 flasks and aspirate the solution without letting the flasks dry.",
    "Then, transfer seeding volume of iCMs (1.6 × 106 viable iCMs in 8 mL room temperature Plating Medium) in the fibronectin pre-coated T25 flasks.\nPlace iCMs in the incubator for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\n2 days later, wash off dead iCMs by gently pipetting the Plating Medium up and down 5 times.\nAspirate the Plating Medium and replace with the 8 mL of pre-warmed Maintenance Medium.\nPlace the flasks back in the 5% CO2 incubator.\nReplace the Maintenance Medium every other day until 80%–80% confluency is reached.\nOnce ready, collect the confluent HCAECs, HCFs and iCMs. First collect HCAECs and HCFs and then iCMs. (See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nCritical: All the 3 cell types need to be ready at the same time, therefore plate iCMs a few days prior to HCFs and HCAECs using the seeding density mentioned above. The HCAECs and HCFs should be used according to numbers iCMs collected. The left over HCAECs and HCFs were either plated again or freezed again. With the seeding volume of iCMs used in the study, approximately 200 CSs made of 30,000 cardiac cells can be successfully generated.\nRemove culture medium from HCFs and HCAECs tissue flasks and rinse them with 3 mL PBS for T25 flask.\nThen remove PBS and add 3 mL of 0.25% trypsin EDTA solution to each T25 flask.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNeutralize the trypsin EDTA solution with 5 mL of culture medium immediately.\nTransfer cell suspensions to a 15 mL Falcon tube and centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 4 min.\nNow remove the supernatant carefully from each tube and add 1 mL HCS medium to each cell pellet and resuspend them.\nKeep the cell suspension on ice and count cells as done in step 20.",
    "Now take the iCMs tissue flaks and remove Maintenance Medium from them.\nRinse with 3 mL of PBS and add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin EDTA solution to each T25 flask.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNote: Check iCMs every minute until they detach from the flask.\nThen, immediately neutralize the trypsin EDTA solution with 4 mL of HCS medium. Then, transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL Falcon tube and centrifuge them at 300 × g for 5 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant from each tube and add 1 mL of HCS medium to the cell pellet.\nResuspend and place it on ice.\nCount the cells following step 20.\nMix iCMs, HCFs and HCAECs in 2:1:1 ratio by plating 10,000 iCMs, 5,000 HCFs and 5,000 HCAECs per HDC containing 20 μL of HCS medium. Adjust to the final volume for the total number of CSs.\nThen, follow steps 22–24 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Mouse CSs are easily and rapidly formed compared to human CSs where all cell types have to be plated individually first and mixed together to form CSs. Also, being made from neonatal cardiac cells mouse CSs have high reproducibility. In order to obtain a good ratio of CSs (whether human or mouse) all the steps should be strictly followed. A regular check on formation of CSs is must.\nEstablishing and imaging ischemia reperfusion (I/R) in 3D human and mice CSs using EVOS™ microscope system\nTiming: 3 days",
    "In vitro modeling of the I/R injury was achieved by culturing CSs at varying oxygen concentrations while visualizing changes in intracellular oxygen concentrations in EVOS™ Microscope system using Image-iT (a reversible hypoxic fluorescent dye sensible to changes in intracellular oxygen levels (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Both EVOS™ FL Auto and M7000 microscope systems can be used for time lapse operations. EVOS™ M7000 is an upgraded version of EVOS™ FL Auto system, and the look of screen and naming of tabs is bit different. Here we have mentioned names and steps according to EVOS M7000 software.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2066-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

For detailed video on collection of spheroids please refer to (Sharma and Gentile, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) (See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nRemove the supernatant from the tube containing CSs and resuspend the CSs pellet with 1.99 mL suitable medium (complete DMEM for mCSs and HCS medium for hCSs).\nNote: The pellet obtained must be kept on ice until use.\nTake two 96 well plates and mark one as control and other as test.\nAdd 250 μL of CS suspension (approximately 10 CSs/ well) into 4 wells of control plate and cover it. Place the plate in the 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator.\nNote: In order to have same number of CSs in each well, exact number of CSs should be collected in separate Falcon tubes and centrifuged.\nAdd 10 μL of 10 μM Image-iT solution to the left-over 0.99 mL CS suspension. Then, add 2 drops of Nucblue (Hoechst) stain to it.",
