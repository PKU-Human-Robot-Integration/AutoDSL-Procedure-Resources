    "All procedures involving animals followed the ethical principles of the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA) and the Arouca Law (Law 11.794/2008) and were approved by the local ethics committee (CEUA-FFCLRP/USP (18.5.35.59.5).\n1. Preparation of drugs\nAnesthesia with Ketamine/Xylazine\n\tNOTE: The dose of ketamine used is 70 mg/kg, and the dose of xylazine is 10 mg/kg.\n\t\nTo prepare 1 mL of anesthetic using ketamine 100 mg/mL solution and xylazine 20 mg/mL solution, combine 0.35 mL of ketamine solution, 0.25 mL of xylazine solution, and 0.4 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution. Administer the anesthetic solution at a final volume of 2 mL/kg.\n\t\tNOTE: Ketamine along with xylazine can produce sedation for 60-80 min. If the animal still has reflexes (e.g., hind leg pitching and/or blinking reflex), administer an additional 10% of the individual dose.\nImipramine\n\tNOTE: The individual dose of imipramine used is 20 mg/kg.\n\t\nTo prepare 1 mL of imipramine 20 mg/mL solution, combine 20 mg of imipramine and 1 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution. Administer the imipramine solution at a final volume of 1 mL/kg.\nMeloxicam\n\tNOTE: The individual dose of meloxicam used is 1 mg/kg.\n\t\nTo prepare 1 mL of meloxicam 1 mg/mL solution, combine 0.05 mL of meloxicam 2% and 0.95 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution. Administer the meloxicam solution at a final volume of 1 mL/kg once a day for two days.\nAscorbic acid 0.1%\n\t\nTo prepare 1 mL of 0.1% ascorbic acid, combine 1 mg of ascorbic acid and 1 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution.\n6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)",
    "NOTE: 6-OHDA is a neurotoxin used to selectively destroy dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons in the brain. Avoid direct contact with skin and mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. When handling 6-OHDA, wear double nitrile gloves, lab coat, disposable gown, eye protection, and surgical mask or face shield. The total infusion volume of the toxin is 4 μL/animal, and the individual amount is 10 μg of 6-OHDA/animal.\n\t\nTo prepare 1 mL of 6-OHDA at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL, mix 2.5 mg of 6-OHDA and 1 mL of 0.9% saline solution containing 0.1% ascorbic acid (described above).\n\t\tNOTE: 6-OHDA is light-sensitive and degrades faster when exposed to bright light. It must be properly handled and stored in an environment protected from light. If the color of the solution is reddish, discard it.\nLidocaine hydrochloride (2%)\n\t\nPrepare 2% lidocaine solution for local application to the animal.\n\t\tNOTE: The maximum dose that can be applied is 7 mg/kg.\nPoly-antibiotic suspension\n\tNOTE: The poly-antibiotic suspension with streptomycins and penicillins (see the Table of Materials) must be prepared at the time of application with the entire volume of diluent, whose ampoule accompanies the vial with the powder.\n\t\nRemove the metallic disc on the rubber stopper. Disinfect the rubber stopper with alcohol.\nUsing a syringe with a needle of 23 G, inject the diluent into the vial. Remove the needle and shake the vial vigorously until the suspension is entirely homogenized. Inject a little air into the vial and withdraw the desired volume of suspension.\nAdminister a deep intramuscular injection, pulling the plunger before injecting the drug to ensure that no blood vessel is reached.\n\t\t​NOTE: The final volume of suspension to be applied is 0.5 mL/kg.\n2. Preparation of materials",
    "NOTE: Always follow instructions provided with the material safety data sheet when handling chemicals.\nStereotaxic apparatus\n\t\nPlace the stereotaxic device on a stable and clean bench with proper illumination to perform the surgery. Disinfect the apparatus with 70% ethanol.\nCheck if the ear and incisor bars of the device are correctly aligned. Place a thermal blanket where the animal will be placed during surgery to stay warm during the procedure. Monitor the animal's temperature with an accurate rectal probe.\n\t\tNOTE: The thermal blanket should be at 37.5 °C so that the animal maintains a body temperature of 37 °C body.\nMicroinfusion system\n\t\nFill (70-80%) a Hamilton syringe (50 μL or as desired) attached to a medical-grade polyethylene microtubing and a needle with double distilled water (ddH2O) and check for leaks through the system.\nPull air through the system so that a single air bubble separates the ddH2O in the syringe from the 6-OHDA solution in the microtube.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure avoids contaminating the Hamilton syringe with 6-OHDA and allows the use of several rats on the same experimental day.\nPosition the Hamilton syringe on the infusion pump so that it is firmly attached and the plunger of the syringe is parallel to the frame that will move to push it. Set the infusion pump to a speed of 0.5 μL/min so that the total application of 4 μL of 6-OHDA lasts for 8 min. Test the infusion system by confirming that there are no leaks and that the infusion occurs according to the previously set time and volume.\nAttach the needle of infusion attached to the microtube to the apparatus at the end of the stereotaxic arm and check that the needle is positioned at a 180° angle to the surface. Ensure that the needle is straight and not bent.",
    "NOTE: Check all the described procedures carefully because if any of the items in the infusion system do not work correctly, it may jeopardize the success of the surgery.\nSuture\n\t\nUse a sterile nylon non-absorbable suture with a 3/8 circle needle to suture the incision after surgery.\nPostsurgical recovery site\n\t\nPlace a clean and sterilized housing box where animals can be monitored until fully recovered (responsive to touch and manipulation). Put a thermal blanket in the box for thermoregulation.\n\t\t​NOTE: As thermoregulation is important, include a supplemental heat source to maintain body temperature if necessary.\n3. Surgical procedure\nNOTE: In this protocol, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were kept under controlled conditions of temperature (22 ± 2 °C), air exchange (15-20 exchanges/hour), and light-dark cycles (12 h/12 h), grouped in boxes with 3 or 4 animals, with free access to food and water.\nWeigh the animals to monitor weight changes in the days following the surgery. Calculate the dose of drugs to be administered.\nAdminister imipramine intraperitoneally 30 min before surgery (~10-15 min before administering anesthesia), using a 27 G needle and a 1 mL syringe.\n\tNOTE: The imipramine will block the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) and prevent 6-OHDA uptake by noradrenergic neurons, making the lesion more selective to the dopaminergic neurons40.\nAfter 10-15 min of the administration of imipramine, administer the intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine anesthesia using a 27 G needle and a 1 mL syringe. Wait until the animal is completely anesthetized. Verify that the animal is under deep anesthesia when the animal does not respond to hind leg pinching and does not show a blink reflex.\nShave the rat's fur in the region of the head where the incision will occur.\nPosition the rat in the stereotaxic apparatus.",
    "Position the head over the incisor bar and fix the bar 3.3 mm below the interaural line.\nPosition the ear bars, one side at a time. Position the incisor bar and the ear bars so that the top of the skull is straight and parallel to the surface.\nAdjust the nose clamp and test that the head is firm and does not move to either side.\nApply sterile ophthalmic ointment to the rat eyes to prevent corneas from drying out.\nApply povidone-iodine to the area to be incised to disinfect the site.\nApply local lidocaine for analgesia of the incision region; do not exceed 7 mg/kg.\nAdminister the meloxicam subcutaneously using a 27 G needle and a 1 mL syringe.\n\tNOTE: Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic that will help the animal recover post surgery.\nAdminister the poly-antibiotic suspension intramuscularly using a 23 G needle and a 1 mL syringe.\n\tNOTE: The poly-antibiotic suspension is administered as a prophylactic treatment to avoid possible bacterial infections in the postsurgery recovery.\nCheck that the animal is in a state of deep anesthesia by checking for blink reflexes or hind limb reflexes by pinching the hind paw with tweezers.\nWith a scalpel, make an incision of ~1.5 cm in the region where the microinjection will occur.\n\tNOTE: Sterile techniques are applied from this point until the wound closure.\nClean the skull region with cotton swabs and cotton buds until the Bregma and Lambda can be seen. Mark the Bregma and the Lambda with a sterilized fine pen.\nCheck that the dorsal-ventral (DV) coordinates of Bregma and Lambda are similar. If they are different, readjust the rat in the stereotaxic apparatus as the rat's head is not correctly positioned.\nNote down the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) coordinates of the Bregma.",
    "Move to the AP and ML coordinates of the right MFB according to 41: AP: -4.3 mm, ML: 1.6 mm from Bregma.\nMark the region of the trepanation with a sterilized fine pen.\nWith a sterilized drill, slowly pierce the animal's skull, taking care not to injure the dura mater.\nPosition the microinjection needle on the dura mater and note the DV coordinates. Take a thin needle and gently rupture the dura mater. Insert the needle to the DV coordinate (8.3 mm ventral) of the MFB, where the microinjection will take place.\nOperate the microinjection pump to release the 6-OHDA solution into the MFB. When the microinjection is finished, check the Hamilton syringe to see if 4 μL of 6-OHDA has been injected.\n\tNOTE: The microinjection should last 8 min.\nAfter administration of the 6-OHDA, wait for 10 min before removing the needle to avoid backflow of the drug. Remove the microinjection needle slowly from the animal's brain.\nDisinfect the incision region again with povidone-iodine.\nSuture the incision area with ~3-4 surgical knots.\n\tNOTE: The knot should not be too strong or too loose.\nRemove the rat from the stereotaxic apparatus and place it in a clean box for recovery on the thermal blanket until the animal has fully recovered from anesthesia. Observe the animal every 15 min until it is fully awake from anesthesia.\n4. Postoperative procedures\nMonitor the weight of the animals over the next four days after surgery. Treat them with meloxicam subcutaneously once a day for two days after surgery, adjusting the dose for each day's weight.\n\tNOTE: All animals should be assessed for the need for analgesics on the third day after the surgery.",
    "Check the incisions daily for at least four days to ensure they are not infected. Look for heat, swelling, pain, discharge, and redness until the incisions heal.\nCheck the appetite and water consumption by monitoring the animal's body weight. Give wet feed to encourage the animals to eat. Observe the general body condition, attitude, and mobility daily for at least four days after surgery. Remove the sutures 7-10 days after surgery.\n\t​NOTE: Animals should be euthanized if the endpoints defined in the ethical procedures are reached.\n5. Stepping test\nTraining\n\tNOTE: The animals should be trained for three days before the test. According to the protocol described below, training should occur twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, or with an interval of at least 2 h between sessions. Track the time using a timer.\n\t\nDay 1\n\t\t\nIn the first session, handle the rat by holding it in gloves for ~1-2 min to allow the rat to familiarize itself with the handler/experimenter.\nIn the second session, alternate between holding the rat for 20 s and placing it on the protocol table for 20 s. Repeat this training step for 3 min to familiarize the rat with the experimental setup for the stepping test.\nDay 2\n\t\t\nIn the first session, place both forepaws of the rat on the protocol table by holding its hind paws and back with one hand. Tilt the rat downwards headfirst at an angle of 45° to the flat surface of the protocol table. Move horizontally on the table from end to end, allowing the rat to step on the table with both paws (cover 90 cm in 4 s). Hold the rat in gloves for 10 s, allowing it to rest; repeat this pattern for 3 min.",
    "In the second session, place one forepaw of the rat on the protocol table by holding the other forepaw back with one hand and hold the rat's back and hind paws with the other hand (see step 5.1.2.1). Move horizontally on the table from end to end in 4 s, allowing the rat to step with its free paw. Hold the rat in gloves for 10 s, allowing it to rest, and repeat with another forepaw, followed by the rest period. Repeat this pattern, alternating between the two forepaws, and rest for 3 min.\nRepeat the training step 3 times for 1 min each.\nDay 3\n\t\t\nIn the first session, follow the procedure described in step 5.1.2.2 for one forepaw. Repeat with another forepaw, followed by the rest period. Repeat this pattern, alternating between the two forepaws, and rest for 3 min.\nIn the second session, follow the procedure described in step 5.1.2.2.\nTest\n\tNOTE: The stepping test is performed before surgery, 2 and 4 weeks after stereotaxic surgery, to evaluate the akinesia of the contralateral forelimb and the possible injury caused by 6-OHDA.\n\t\nHold the rat at an angle of 45° to the surface, immobilizing its hind limbs and allowing only one of the forelimbs to rest on the platform, as explained above, for day 3 of training.\nDrag the rat forward over a distance of 90 cm in 4 s, with the right or left paw resting on the surface.\nTake notes and quantify the number of forehand-adjusting steps taken with each paw in each direction.\nSubscription Required.
