    "4% Trypan blue solution, a hemocytometer chamber and an optic microscope.Resuspend PKH26-labeled lymphocytes at 2 million/ml (up to 50 million in 25 ml) in RPMI1640 media without FBS in a T25 vented tissue culture flask. Induce apoptosis by exposing lymphocytes to γ-irradiation (10 Gy). Incubate lymphocytes overnight 5% CO2, 37 °C in either complete media (for early apoptotic cells) RPMI without serum for late apoptotic cells at 2 million/ml. Isolation and culture of monocytesAfter recovering monocytes from elutriation chamber, wash in HBSS, count, and resuspend at 0.5 million/ml in complete media (Day 0).Add 10 ml per 100 mm petri dish. Add recombinant human M-CSF to a final concentration of 25 ng/ml.Place at 37 °C, 5% CO2.After 3-4 days, add 5 ml fresh complete media (containing 25 ng/ml M-CSF) per plate. On day 6-8, discard media from plates and wash adherent cells twice with 5 ml HBSS. Discard last HBSS wash and add 5 ml CellStripper to the plates, incubate 20-30 min RT.Pipet up and down to detach the cells and transfer to 50 ml conical tube containing 25 ml prewarmed complete media (one tube = 5 plates, final volume 50 ml).Centrifuge cell suspension 1,200 rpm (300 x g), 5 min RT.Wash cell pellet twice with 10 ml HBSS, centrifuge cell suspension 5 min 1,200 rpm (300 x g).Count viable cell number using 0.4% Trypan blue solution, a hemocytometer chamber and an optic microscope.Plate human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDM) at 0.25 million/ml in complete media, 500 cells/mm2. For immunocytochemistry (ICC), plate cells in 24-well plates containing 12 mm coverslips (0.5 ml).Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. C1q binding to apoptotic lymphocytesTransfer apoptotic lymphocytes to conical tube. Assess apoptosis by flow cytometry using the apoptosis detection kit from Biovision.Centrifuge cell suspension 5 min 1,200 rpm (300 x g).",
    "Discard supernatant and carefully resuspend lymphocytes in 10 ml prewarmed HBSS. Count ALL cells (viable and permeable) using 0.4% Trypan blue solution, a hemocytometer chamber and an optic microscope. Centrifuge cell suspension 5 min, 1,200 rpm (300 x g).Resuspend cell pellet at 5 x 106 cells/ml in HBSS/1%HSA in sterile 12 x 75 mm round bottom tube.Depending on the number of C1q coated apoptotic cells desired, add human purified C1q to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml. Pipet gently up and down or invert to mix.Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C, gently shake tubes every 15 min.Add 2 ml HBSS per tube and centrifuge cell suspension 5 min, 1,200 rpm (300 x g).Discard supernatant, add 2 ml HBSS per tube and centrifuge cell suspension 5 min, 1,200 rpm (300 x g).Resuspend cell pellet at desired concentration in phagocytosis buffer for uptake assay. Set aside 2 x 105 apoptotic lymphocytes +/- C1q to assess C1q binding efficiency as described below.C1q binding efficiencyResuspend 2 x 105 apoptotic lymphocytes +/- C1q in 100 μl FACS buffer. Add 1-2 μl murine anti-human C1q and incubate for 30 min on ice.Add 2 ml FACS buffer, centrifuge cell suspension 5 min 1,200 rpm (300 x g), 4 °C. Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 100 μl FACS buffer. Add 1 μl FITC conjugated anti-mouse IgG and incubate for 30 min on ice in the dark.Add 2 ml FACS buffer, centrifuge cell suspension 5 min 1,200 rpm (300 x g), 4 °C.Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 200 μl FACS buffer.Analyze by flow cytometry to determine C1q binding efficiency to apoptotic lymphocytes. Percentage of apoptotic cells binding C1q should be greater than 50%. Uptake assayRecover human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDMs) plate from Section C.

    "Recover apoptotic lymphocytes from step IV-10. Add apoptotic lymphocytes +/- C1q at a 5:1 ratio (for example 5 x 105 apoptotic lymphocytes for 1 x 105 HMDMs in phagocytosis buffer in a final total volume of 2 ml per a 6-well plate well). Centrifuge the plate 3 min at 700 rpm (100 x g).Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.To assess uptake by flow cytometry: Discard media and wash adherent cells twice with HBSS.Add 0.5 ml 0.05% trypsin and incubate 2 min 37 °C. Pipet cells up and down and transfer into 12 x 75 mm tubes (microscopically check that all macrophages have been recovered).
