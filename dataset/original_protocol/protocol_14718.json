    "All mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed under pathogen free conditions at the University of Colorado Denver, Barbara Davis Center Animal Facility according to NIH Guidelines and with approval of the University of Colorado Denver IACUC.\n1. Donor Kidney Harvest\nSterilize all instruments, wear sterile gloves throughout the procedure and maintain a sterile field. Perform all surgeries with the use of an operating microscope.\nSurgically remove mouse donor kidneys from pentobarbital-anesthetized (60mg/kg IP) donors. Ascertain depth of anesthesia by toe-pinch, and observe the respiratory rate.\nClip the fur then immobilize the mouse by 4-way restraints. Prepare the skin with povidone-iodine and drape the mouse in a sterile fashion.\nMake a 2 cm midline vertical abdominal incision and enter the abdominal cavity. Retract the bowel superiorly and externalize it on to the chest. Keep the bowel wrapped in sterile moist gauze throughout the procedure.\nIdentify the great abdominal vessels and mobilize them, identify any lumbar branches and either cauterize or ligate them with 10/0 nylon suture.\nImmediately distal to the left renal vessels tease the inferior vena cava (IVC) and abdominal aorta (AA) apart by blunt dissection over approximately 2mm. Ligate with 10/0 nylon and divide small arterial and venous branches from the renal vessels.\nNow separate the renal vein from the renal artery carefully by blunt dissection of these structures. This allows for the accurate creation of a Carrel patch at the proximal end of the renal vein, which will be used to form an end-to-side anastomosis to the recipients IVC.\nIdentify, ligate and divide the left adrenal vessels. This permits access to the suprarenal aorta and a 6-0 silk suture is placed around the aorta in preparation for ligation, but not tied at this time.",
    "Mobilize the kidney, vessels and ureter from the surrounding facia. Rotate the kidney to the right and ligate/divide any posterior branches. Then return the kidney to the left.\nNow direct attention to the ureter. Without disturbing the renal hilum free the ureter from the surrounding facia taking care to preserve the ureteric vessels. Divide the ureter at the level of the ductus deferens. The kidney is now ready for recovering.\nSlowly inject 300 units of heparin into the distal IVC thereby heparinizing the donor. Tie down the 6-0 silk suture placed around the suprarenal AA and perfuse the left kidney via the distal abdominal aorta with 0.8ml of heparin saline solution (100 U/ml).\nOnce the perfusion has ceased create a venous Carrel patch immediately to eliminate backflow into the kidney. Retract the renal vein toward the kidney revealing the AA and renal artery beneath.\nDivide the aorta adjacent to the renal artery creating a heel and toe cuff as shown in Figure 1. Remove the kidney, vessels and ureter from the donor.\nRemove the kidney directly to a pre-prepared recipient (0 min cold ischemia time) or stored at 4 oC in a solution of choice for a pre-determined time until time of implantation. Euthanized the donors by exsanguanation and cervical dislocation. Total time to recover donor kidney is approx. 15-20 min.\n2. Kidney Implant Technique\nAnesthetize the recipient mouse with pentobarbital (60mg/kg IP initial dose, 25mg/kg IP supplemental dose if required). Ascertain depth of anesthesia by toe-pinch, and observe the respiratory rate. Clip the fur then immobilize the mouse by 4-way restraints and apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes. Prepare the skin with povidone-iodine and drape the mouse in a sterile fashion.",
    "Make a 2 cm midline vertical abdominal incision and enter the abdominal cavity. Retract the bowel superiorly and externalize on to the chest. Keep the bowel wrapped in sterile moist gauze throughout the procedure.\nAt this time perform a right nephrectomy. Ligate the renal artery and vein with 6-0 silk sutures. Excise the kidney distal to the sutures. Ligate the ureter with 6-0 silk and then divide proximal to the kidney.\nIsolate the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) below the renal vessels. Place 4-0 cotton ties around the aorta and IVC superior then inferior to the anastomosis site. Identify and ligate any lumbar vessels within the field with 10-0 nylon suture.\nKnot the cotton ties, first the inferior followed by the superior. In this way some blood is retained in the aorta making the aortotomy easier.\nForm the aortotomy with a 30G needle to enter the lumen of the aorta. Extend the incision with fine micro scissors to a length of approximately 2mm.\nMake an end to side anastomosis of the donor aortic heel-and-toe cuff to the recipient aorta in the following fashion. Place a 10-0 nylon suture stay stitch in the donor aorta and to the inferior angle of the incision in the recipient aorta and tie.\nPlace a second 10-0 nylon opposite the first in the donor aorta and the superior corner of the incision in the abdominal aorta and tie. Make a running suture line from superior to inferior in the lateral wall of the aorta and tie against the previously placed stay stitch. Then suture the medial wall in a running fashion and tie.",
    "Make an end to side anastomosis of the donor renal vein to the recipient IVC in the following fashion. Puncture the IVC with a 30G needle and extend the incision with fine micro scissors. Tie the donor renal vein to the inferior corner of the incision in the IVC with 10-0 nylon. Make a running suture line between the renal vein and the IVC and tie.\n\tNOTE: It is also vitally important that full thickness passes of the suture needle including the vascular adventitia and the intima are achieved. Eversion of the edges also ensures that there is intima-to-intima contact, which aids in sealing and healing of the anastomoses. While a hemostatic clotting agent can be useful for reducing leaks, we recommend that a surgeon instead rely on good technique.\nEnsure that the anastomoses are “clean”. That is, that the opposing walls are not caught when placing stitches. This will cause a significant constriction to flow that will result in a failed graft and in extreme cases to hind limb paralysis.\n\tNOTE: Another vitally important factor is ensuring that the tension of the anastomotic suture lines is also optimal. Too loose and there will be irreversible leaking, too tight and stricture to flow will result. If on the arterial side this will result in poor perfusion of the graft, if on the venous side a congested kidney will result.\nRelease the distal 4-0 cotton tie re-establishing venous flow. Once hemostasis of the venous anastomosis has been observed gradually loosen the proximal 4-0 cotton tie and observe the arterial anastomosis for hemostasis.\nRemove the cotton ties from the mouse once both anastomoses are considered secure. Pierce the bladder with a 20 G needle creating two holes.",
    "Pass the tips of curved forceps through the holes and pull the donor ureter through the bladder with the forceps with the proximal end of the ureter being anchored to the bladder wall with two 10-0 nylon sutures. Trim the excess length of ureter protruding from the second hole allowing the ureter to retract within the bladder and close the hole with two 10-0 nylon sutures.\nReturn the bowel to the abdomen. Close the abdominal wall in two layers using 5-0 Silk suture in a running fashion.\nAdminister a 1.0 ml bolus of sterile, warm normal saline into the abdomen as fluid resuscitation upon closing, and inject 0.8 ml of normal saline subcutaneously post-operatively. No other supportive measures are required during the surgery.\nRecover the animal on a warming blanket. Total implant time is approx. 35-45 min. Administer analgesics such as buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg, SC, 0.1-0.2 ml at the beginning of the procedure and every 6-12 hr for 72 hr post-op.\n3. Contralateral Nephrectomy\nDepending on the protocol requirements, several days after the implant procedure, perform a contralateral nephrectomy under isoflurane anesthesia (5% inhaled isoflurane for induction, 1.5-2.0% for maintenance).\nEnter the abdominal cavity and gently retract the bowel to the animal’s right. Expose the left kidney and blunt dissect from the surrounding fascia.\nLigate the renal artery, vein and ureter with 6-0 silk sutures and then excise the kidney above the sutures and remove the kidney. Total operative time is approx. 10 min.\n4. Graft Assessment\nMeasure serum creatinine using the alkaline picrate method (Jaffe reaction).\nSubscription Required.
