The protocol can also be used to introduce insertions and deletions in any type of plasmid DNA (Römer et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Briant et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The main procedures are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1500-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic workflow of site-directed mutagenesis of target plasmid\nPCR to amplify the target plasmid using the above-mentioned primers (Primer design).\nPrepare the mix below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1500_10.csv\nUse the following thermocycler parameters for the PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1500_11.csv\nDigest the PCR product with the enzyme DpnI to digest the Dam-methylated plasmid DNA template.\nAdd 1 μL of FastDigest DpnI enzyme (included in kit) to the PCR product. Mix thoroughly by pipetting.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nPrepare 10 μL ligation reaction mix.\nPrepare the mix below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1500_12.csv\nCentrifuge briefly and incubate at 25°C for 30 min, then chill on ice.\nPerform transformation reaction.\n5 μL of the product from the ligation reaction is used to transform Trans1-T1 Escherichia coli competent cells.\nCultivate the transformants on Ampicillin (working concentration 50 μg/mL) LB agar plates at 37°C for 12–14 h.\nIn the next day, 3–5 individual colonies are cultured in 500 μL of liquid Ampicillin (working concentration 50 μg/mL) LB medium at 37°C for 4–6 h with shaking at 220 rpm. The cultured medium containing each colony is sent to sequence to check for the right mutations.\nPreparation of cRNA\nTiming: 1 day\nThe protocol is performed using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/AM1340[href=https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/AM1340]).",
    "Culture the colonies of wild type HvirOR6 and its mutant, HvirOR6-L321V, in liquid Ampicillin LB at 37°C for 14 h in an incubator with shaking at 220 rpm.\nExtract the plasmid DNA using a Plasmid DNA extraction kit (TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit).\nPlasmid DNA is linearized with restriction enzyme SmaI and then purified with Phenol: Chloroform: Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and resuspended in 7 μL nuclease-free water.\nThe quantity and integrity of linearized plasmid DNA are determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nano-Drop products, Wilmington, USA) and gel electrophoresis analysis.\nCritical: The plasmid DNA must be completely digested before the transcription reaction, because even a small amount of circular template can adversely affect the transcription output.\nPrepare 20 μL in vitro transcription reaction mix.\nPrepare the mix below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1500_13.csv\nPipette the mixture gently, and briefly centrifuge. Incubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nStop the reaction and precipitate the RNA by adding 30 μL nuclease-free water and 30 μL LiCl Precipitation Solution (included in kit). Chill for 1 h at −20°C.\nCentrifuge at 13,523 g at 4°C for 30 min to pellet the RNA.\nWash the RNA twice with 1 mL 70% ethanol. The synthesized cRNA is diluted into nuclease-free water to final concentration of 2 μg/μL and stored in 1 μL aliquots at −70°C until use.\nOocytes microinjection\nTiming: 3 h\nChoose mature and healthy oocytes (stage V-VII) under a stereomicroscope and transfer them into a new 60 mm Petri dishes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1500-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The main steps of oocytes microinjection and TEVC recording\n(A) Select mature and healthy oocytes.\n(B) Microinject oocytes under a stereomicroscope.\n(C) Culture injected oocytes into 24-well plates in an incubator at 18°C.\n(D) Perform TEVC recording experiment.",
    "Mix 1 μL cRNA of HvirOR6 or 1 μL cRNA of its mutant, HvirOR6-L321V with 1 μL cRNA of Orco (HvirOrco), respectively.\nPrepare injection needles by pulling glass capillaries with a micropipette puller. The tip of a needle is cut with a blade to a 20 μm opening in diameter.\nFill the glass needle with mineral oil and install it onto the dispenser of a microinjector.\nTransfer the 2 μL cRNA of each mixture onto a piece of parafilm and draw it into the glass needle under the control of the microinjector manipulator.\nCritical: Make sure no air has been drawn into the glass needle, which will greatly affect the injection of oocytes.\nInject 27.6 nL cRNA mixture into each oocyte under a stereomicroscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Oocytes microinjected with 27.6 nL RNase-free water are used as the negative control. After injection, transfer the injected oocytes into 24-well plates (2–3 oocytes in each well) filled with incubation medium. Keep the oocytes in the incubator for 3–5 days for heterologous expression at 18°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nElectrophysiological recording with TEVC\nTiming: 2 days\nThe TEVC experiment is performed with the equipment shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D. The main operation steps are as follows:\nPrepare working solutions of Z9-14:Ald and Z9-16:Ald.\nDilute 5 μL of 1 M Z9-14:Ald or Z9-16:Ald stock solution into 50 mL working solution in a 50 mL tube to prepare working solutions of 10-4 M for each chemical. And 3 × 10-4 M working solution of each chemical can be prepared by adding 15 μL of 1 M chemical working solution into 50 mL working solution.",
    "10-5 M and 3 × 10-5 M working solutions of each chemical are prepared by adding 5 mL of 10-4 M and 3 × 10-4 M chemical working solution into 45 mL working solution, respectively. Similarly, chemical solutions of other concentrations including 10-6 M, 10-7 M and 3 × 10-6 M are prepared.\nCritical: The chemical working solutions should be freshly prepared.\nPrepare silver wires for recording. The silver wires used in voltage electrode, current electrode and bath probe electrodes must be chlorinated prior to assembly and use. Briefly polish silver wires with sandpaper, and then immerse them in NaClO solution to half length, until the immersed part becomes uniformly black.\nLoad the working solution and chemical working solutions in each perfusion tubes, and adjust the height of tubes to keep the flow rate at about 5 mL/min.\nPrepare glass electrodes. Pull glass capillaries to a fine taper using a micropipette puller with proper parameters.\nCritical: The parameters are set according to the RAMP value for each batch of glass capillaries. Test the RAMP value of one glass capillary each time a new batch of glass capillaries is to be used.\nFill 3 M KCl into two glass electrodes (about 2/3 volume of the glass electrode). Insert an oxidized silver wire and a glass electrode into each holder, and then install the holder on micromanipulators.\nMeasure the resistance of the electrodes.\nTurn on OC-725C Oocyte Clamp Amplifier and Digidata 1440A Data Acquisition System, and open the Clampex 10.2 software.\nMove the electrodes into bath solution with the micromanipulators and turn “Vm OFFSET” and “Ve OFFSET” to zero.\nPress buttons “Vm Electrode Test” and “Ve Electrode Test” respectively to display the resistance of each electrode. The electrode resistance should be in the range of 0.1–1 MΩ.",
    "Transfer an oocyte expressing the target gene into the hole at the middle of bath chamber with a pipette.\nMove the voltage electrode to gently impale the oocyte by operating the micromanipulator, and then the current electrode. Generally, the resting membrane potential of the oocyte is displayed in the range of −10 to −50 mV.\nTurn the buttons “CLAMP” to “SLOW” and “GAIN” to “MAX” on the Digidata 1440A Data Acquisition System, and click the button “Record” on the interface of Clampex 10.2 software to start recording.\nCritical: Chemical-induced currents are recorded with the TEVC at holding potential of -80 mV. Signals are amplified using an OC-725C amplifier with lowpass filtered at 50 Hz and digitized at 1 kHz. Data acquisition is carried out with Digidata 1440A Data Acquisition System and pCLAMP 10.2 software.\nStimulate oocytes with different concentrations of chemical solutions for desired purposes.\nFor the purpose to identify ligands of HvirOR6 and its mutant. In this experiment, the oocytes expressing HvirOR6 or its mutant are challenged with 10-4 M of Z9-14:Ald and Z9-16:Ald.\nFor the purpose to study the response sensitivity of HvirOR6 or its mutant to chemicals. In this stage, the oocytes expressing HvirOR6 or its mutant are treated with increasing concentrations (3 × 10-4 M to 10-7 M) of chemical solutions.\nCritical: During the recording, chemical solutions are supplied for about 15 s at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. After each stimulus, the oocytes are washed with working solution until the current returns to the baseline.\nStop the recording. After challenged with all stimuli, click the button “Stop” to end the recording, and then turn the “GAIN” to “0”, and “CLAMP” to “OFF” in turn.",
    "Withdraw the two electrodes carefully and remove the tested oocyte. Put another oocyte in the chamber and start a new recording as described above.\nFinish the recording. Close the Clampex 10.2 software, and turn off the machines. Empty the remaining salt solutions in the perfusion system by washing with clean water."
