    "Note: Perform all cell manipulations in aseptic conditions using a HEPA-filtered class II biological safety cabinet and sterilize all solutions by filtering them through a 0.2 µm filter. Perform tissue construction and function testing in either the same aseptic conditions or a laminar flow hood.\n1. Seeding of H7 hESCs in Preparation for Cardiac Differentiation\n(Day 1) Preparing the Basement Membrane Matrix\n\t\nThaw 150 µl aliquot of hESC qualified basement membrane matrix on ice overnight at 4 °C.\n(Day 0-4) Plating of hESCs on Coated Plates\n\t\nDilute the thawed matrix into 12 ml of ice-cold DMEM/F12 and mix well.\nTransfer 1 ml of the DMEM/F12-matrix solution into each well of a 6-well tissue culture treated dish. Each aliquot of matrix can coat two 6-well plates.\nIncubate the coated plates at room temperature for at least 1 hr.\n\t\tNote: In our experience, coated dishes sealed with paraffin can be stored in matrix solution at 4 °C for up to 10 days before use.\nAt approximately 75% confluence, dissociate the H7 hESCs from the 10 cm dish using 6 ml of the non-enzymatic dissociation reagent. After 5 min, gently scrape the cells from the culture surface using a disposable cell scraper and transfer the cell suspension to a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube.\nRemove 0.5 ml of the dissociation solution with the cells from the 15 ml tube and transfer to a new sterile 15 ml tube (leaving 5.5 ml of the dissociation reagent to further dissociate the hESCs) for stem cell line propagation.",
    "Pellet the 0.5 ml of cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 20 °C. Remove the supernatant and gently resuspend in 8 ml of pluripotent stem cell media containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin then transfer to a new, coated, 10 cm tissue culture dish and maintain 37 °C and 5% CO2 to maintain the stem cell line.\n\t\tNote: Keep pluripotent stem cell media on ice during media changes.\nMeanwhile, add 5.5 µl of 10 mM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to the remaining 5.5 ml of dissociation solution and continue to incubate at room temperature for another 5-10 min. Gently mix the cells with a 5 ml serological pipet. Continue to incubate until a single cell suspension is achieved, then pellet the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the cells in 5 ml of pluripotent stem cell media and perform a cell count using a hemocytometer.\nSeed each well of the 6-well dish at a density of 140,000 cells per well. Seed two 6-well plates to create a total of six defined tissues. Dispose of any remaining cells after plating.\nFill the well to 1 ml with pluripotent stem cell media and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours later, remove the media and add 2 ml of fresh pluripotent stem cell media to each well (Figure 1A).\nCheck the confluence of the plates each day and begin the differentiation once the cells reach approximately 75% confluence (Figure 1B-D).\n2. (Day 4-24) Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells to Cardiomyocytes30,31\n(Day 4-7, Differentiation Day 0-3) Mesoderm Induction",
    "Prepare RPMI differentiation media I (Table 1) by combining 500 ml RPMI 1640 with 10 ml B27 supplement (without insulin) and 5 ml of penicillin-streptomycin stock solution (10,000 IU/ml penicillin; 10,000 µg/ml streptomycin). Aliquot, on ice, into 50 ml tubes and store at 4 °C.\n(Day 4, Differentiation Day 0) Prepare mesoderm induction media by adding 2.4 µl of the small molecule GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 (10 mM stock, 6 µM final concentration) to 12 ml of RPMI differentiation media I. Remove pluripotent stem cell media from each well and replace with 2 ml of the mesoderm induction media per well. Return the plate to the incubator.\n\t\tNote: Significant cell death typically occurs with the addition of CHIR99021 (Figure 1E). The monolayer will recover, but it is important to rinse the dead cells away with the DMEM/F12 rinse.\n(Day 5, Differentiation Day 1) Prepare fresh mesoderm induction media as described above. Remove the old media from each well and rinse once with 1 ml of DMEM/F12 per well. Add 2 ml of fresh mesoderm induction media to each well.\n\t\tNote: Rinsing each day from Day 0-10 greatly increases yield and purity of the cardiac myocytes.\n(Day 6, Differentiation Day 2) Remove the cardiac induction media and rinse once with 1 ml DMEM/F12 per well. Replace the rinse with 2 ml RPMI differentiation media I (no small molecules added but still with the B27 (without insulin) supplement) and return to the incubator.\n(Day 7-13, Differentiation Day 3-10) Cardiac Mesoderm Induction\n\t\n(Day 7, Differentiation Day 3) Prepare cardiac mesoderm induction media by adding 6 µl of the small molecule Wnt inhibitor IWR-1 (10 mM stock, 5 µM final) to 12 ml of RPMI differentiation media I.",
    "Remove the media from each well, rinse once with 1 ml DMEM/F12 per well and replace with 2 ml of cardiac mesoderm induction media per well.\n(Day 8, Differentiation Day 4) Prepare an additional 12 ml of cardiac mesoderm induction media as described above. Remove the media added the day prior, rinse once with 1 ml DMEM/F12 per well and replace with 2 ml of fresh cardiac mesoderm differentiation media per well and return to the incubator.\n(Day 9-10, Differentiation Day 5-6) On both days, remove the cardiac mesoderm induction media and rinse each well with 1 ml of DMEM/F12.\nAdd 2 ml of fresh RPMI differentiation media I (no small molecules added but still with the B27 (without insulin) supplement) to each well and return the plate to the incubator.\n(Day 11-24, Differentiation Day 7-20) hES-derived Cardiac Myocyte Organization/Maturation\n\t\nPrepare the RPMI differentiation media II (Table 1) by combining 500 ml RPMI 1640 with 10 ml B27 supplement (with insulin) and 5 ml of penicillin-streptomycin stock solution. Aliquot, on ice, into 50 ml tubes and store at 4 °C.\n(Day 11, Differentiation Day 7) Remove RPMI differentiation media (without insulin) from each well and rinse with 1 ml DMEM/F12. Replace with 2 ml of the new RPMI differentiation media II (with insulin) to each well and return to the incubator.\n\t\tNote: Spontaneous beating should first be observed between days 7 and 10. If beating is not observed during this time, it typically indicates poor differentiation efficiency. The protocol can be continued until day 15 in an effort to observe beating, but if no beating is observed by day 15 it is best to start a new differentiation.",
    "(Day 12-24, Differentiation Day 8-20) Every day, remove the old differentiation media and replace with 2 ml of fresh RPMI differentiation media II per well to permit cell maturation and organization of the beating monolayer (Figure 1F, Video Figure 1).\n\t\tNote: Depending on the residual cell death, it may be necessary to rinse with 1 ml of DMEM/F12 through differentiation day 10.\n3. (Day 24, Differentiation Day 20) Isolation of Cardiac Myocytes and Fibroblast-like Cells\nDissociate Cells from the Monolayer\n\t\nRemove differentiation media and rinse once with 1 ml PBS.\nDissociate the monolayers with 1 ml of the enzymatic dissociation solution (0.04% Trypsin/0.03% EDTA) to each well.\nMove plate into incubator for 10 min. Meanwhile, add 12 µl of ROCK inhibitor to 6 ml of trypsin neutralization solution.\nGently add 1 ml of the trypsin neutralization solution containing the ROCK inhibitor to each well of the plate to neutralize the trypsin solution.\nUsing a sterile transfer pipet, gently mix each well to break apart the cell clusters.\nTransfer all 12 ml from the 6-well plate to a 15 ml centrifuge tube.\n\t\tNote: Since two 6-well plates are used in this protocol, two 15-ml tubes will be needed.\nTransfer 3 ml of PBS to one well of the plate, and then sequentially transfer the same 3 ml to each subsequent well to collect any residual cells on the dish. Transfer the remaining 3 ml from the final well into the same 15 ml centrifuge tube containing the cells.\nPellet at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nPrepare Cells for Live Cell Sorting by FACS\n\t\nPrepare the staining buffer by adding 5 ml of Fetal Bovine Serum to 45 ml of PBS on ice with 50 µl of ROCK inhibitor.",
    "Remove the supernatant from the cell pellet (in 3.1.8) and resuspend in 1.2 ml of staining buffer.\nTransfer 200 µl of the cell suspension to a new, pre-chilled, 50 ml centrifuge tube on ice. This will be the negative staining control.\nTransfer the remaining 1 ml of cell suspension to a new, pre-chilled, 50 ml centrifuge tube on ice and add 2 µl SIRPα-PE/Cy7 (1:500 dilution) and 4 µl of CD90-FITC (1:250 dilution). Gently mix the cell suspension with a transfer pipet and return to the ice.\nIncubate both the negative control and sample, on a rocker shaker, on ice, at 4 °C for 1 hr.\nPrepare sample collection tubes by adding 3 ml of RPMI media (with insulin) to two 15 ml centrifuge tubes. Add 3 µl of ROCK inhibitor to each tube and store on ice.\nPellet the stained cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and rinse twice with at least 10 ml of ice-cold PBS per rinse.\nAdd 1 µl of DAPI (1 µg/ml) to 5 ml of staining buffer. Gently resuspend the sample pellet with 1-3 ml of the DAPI-containing staining buffer using a transfer pipet.\nAdd 500 µl of staining buffer (with no DAPI added) to the negative control.\nGently filter both the negative control and sample through a 40 µm cell strainer to remove clumps of cells and transfer to polystyrene FACS tubes on ice. Immediately bring samples to the cell sorter.\nSimilar to established live cell sorting methods18, use the negative control to set the gates, select for live cells (DAPI negative) and collect both the FITC+ (i.e., CD90+ fibroblasts) and PE/Cy7+ (i.e., SIRPα+ cardiomyocytes) populations independently at 20 psi (Figure 2).",
    "Note: After setting the gates, the negative control can be fixed in 4% PFA to determine differentiation efficiency by staining for cardiac troponin-T.\n\t\tNote: Some researchers prefer to use an isotype control rather than unstained control to set the gates in order to compensate for non-specific antibody binding. A so-called fluorescence minus one (FMO) control is another possibility. Due to the clear bimodal distribution of the FITC, DAPI and PE-Cy7 signals, we gated from the positive population, conservatively aiming far into the positive gate, which possibly excludes some true positives but helps to minimize any false positives.\nCell Reaggregation in Preparation for Tissue Engineering\n\t\nAfter the cell sort, pellet both collection tubes and resuspend in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% Neonatal Bovine Serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 0.2% Amphotericin B (“NBS media”).\nRecombine the SIRPα+ and CD90+ cells in a 3:1 ratio and plate the combined cells in a non-tissue culture treated petri dish at a density of 2 million cells per 60 cm2 (10 cm dish). Add 10 ml of NBS media and 10 µl of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.\nPlace cell suspension in the tissue culture incubator for 48 hours to allow cell reaggregation into small clusters.\n4. Human Cardiac Tissue Engineering\nFabricate the Multi-tissue Bioreactor\n\tNote: To supplement the illustrations in Figure 3A, CAD files with detailed bioreactor design schematics are available upon request from the authors.\n\t\nMachine the PDMS master mold by drilling six evenly spaced holes of 0.5 mm diameter into a 9 x 33 x 3.25 mm cuboid of polytetrafluoroethylene.\nUsing an endmill, machine a frame from polysulfone measuring 25 x 35 x 11 mm3. The purpose of the frame is to hold the PDMS posts (constructed from the cast made above) in alignment with the wells in the baseplate.",
    "Using a 1-mm endmill, machine 6 wells (6 x 1 x 1 mm3), 4 mm apart into a 20 x 40 x 5 mm3 piece of black polytetrafluoroethylene to form the baseplate.\nMix the elastomeric base and curing agent for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in a 10:1 w/w ratio and add to the custom polytetrafluoroethylene mold (step 4.1.1) to create two rows of six force-sensing posts, and incubate overnight and under vacuum at 80 °C. After curing, gently remove the PDMS from the master mold and carefully mark the tops of each post with a black permanent marker for enhanced contrast and automated real-time post deflection tracking.\n\t\tNote: Polytetrafluorethylene is fairly soft and can be damaged easily. Use care when cleaning the master mold prior to PDMS casting to ensure longevity of the system and consistent PDMS post geometry. A 0.5 mm wire can be used to clean the holes for the posts after each use, but take care to not scrape the inside of the holes.\n\t\tNote: An alternative is to degas the PDMS under vacuum for several hours at room temperature, then let the mixture cure at ambient pressure. This may lead to fewer residual gas bubbles forming in the PDMS during the curing process.\nSterilize all Components in a Steam Autoclave.\n\t\tNote: The PDMS master mold (step 4.1.1) and polysulfone frame (step 4.1.2) are both reusable. The PDMS posts created from the cast (step 4.1.4) is also reusable but only for approximately 10 uses. However, more PDMS posts can be created as needed using the master mold.\nCollect Reaggregated Cardiac Cells\n\t\nRemove the reaggregated cells from the incubator and transfer all 10 ml of the reaggregation media to a 50 ml centrifuge tube.",
    "Rinse the plate with 3 ml of PBS and transfer the rinse to the same 50 ml centrifuge tube containing the reaggregation media.\nAdd 3 ml of 0.04% Trypsin/0.03% EDTA to the 10 cm dish and return to the incubator for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, examine the plate with an inverted compound microscope at 10X magnification to ensure complete cell dissociation from the dish. If some residual clusters are still attached, gently agitate the plate to detach the clumps. If the clusters remain attached, return to the incubator for another 2-3 min. Do not incubate longer than ten minutes or significant cell death may occur.\nOnce all cells are detached, add 3 ml of trypsin neutralization solution. Gently mix the neutralization solution with the trypsin-cell solution and transfer to the 50 ml centrifuge tube containing the reaggregation media and rinse once with PBS.\nRinse the entire dish with 5 ml of PBS and transfer to the same 50 ml tube containing the cells.\nPellet the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of NBS media, then transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nPellet at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant. The cardiac cells (CD90+ stromal cells and SIRPα+ myocytes) are now ready for tissue construction.\n(Optional) Collect Supplemental Cells of Interest\n\tNote: In addition to the defined tissues containing only SIRPα+ cardiomyocytes and CD90+ fibroblast-like cells, it is possible to add additional cells of interest to interrogate their effect on tissue function. For example rat MSCs have been shown to enhance the function of rat engineered cardiac tissues1. The following optional step describes the collection of supplemental cells for the defined system.",
    "Collect the supplemental cell type of interest (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells) using 0.25% trypsin/0.1% EDTA.\nPellet the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature then resuspend in 5 ml of appropriate cell culture media for the cell type of interest. For instance, for MSCs, use DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 0.2% amphotericin-B to culture the cells.\nPerform a cell count using a hemocytometer, then pellet the cells again at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend in 1 ml of cell culture media and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant. The supplemental cells are now ready for tissue construction.\n\t\tNote: if the supplemental cells are added at a concentration of 10% of the total cell number in the tissue, then for the defined tissues, this will require 50,000 supplemental cells per tissue as each tissue contains 500,000 cardiac cells (both CD90+ stromal cells and SIRPα+ myocytes).\nCreate the Human Engineered Cardiac Tissues\n\tNote: Store all solutions on ice and the cells at room temperature. All volumes listed below are per tissue. Typically, approximately six tissues can be constructed from two 6-well plates of cardiac differentiations.\n\t\nDilute 60.0 µl of the 5 mg/ml collagen stock to 3.125 mg/ml with 1.5 µl of 1 M NaOH, 9.6 µl of 10x PBS and 24.9 µl of sterile ultrapure deionized water.\n\t\tCritical step: Avoid the introduction of air bubbles to each solution during preparation as air bubbles will disrupt proper tissue formation.",
    "Add 12.0 µl of both 10x MEM and 0.2 N HEPES pH 9 to the dilute collagen mixture to create the collagen mix. Add both solutions down the side of the 15 ml centrifuge tube in order to avoid the introduction of air bubbles into the collagen mix.\nAdd the basement membrane matrix to a final concentration of 0.9 mg/ml to the collagen mix and store on ice to create the final tissue mix. The final concentration of collagen should be 2 mg/ml.\nAdd 500,000 of the reaggregated cells to the tissue mix (myocyte + fibroblast concentration is 20 million/ml) and fill to a final volume of 25 µl per tissue with either cell-free NBS media or 50,000 cells of the supplemental cell type of interest (e.g., hMSCs) and mix well to form an even cell suspension.\n\t\tNote: The number of supplemented cells will vary from for different applications. Here 10% supplementation is used.\nWith care, pipet 25 µl of the cell suspension into each of the six wells in the bioreactor baseplate, without introducing air bubbles into the well.\nPush two rows of the PDMS force sensors onto either side of the polysulfone frame, forming 6 pairs of opposing posts, then invert the frame on top of the baseplate so that one pair of posts enters each well containing the cell suspension.\n\t\tNote: The polysulfone frame includes tabs to aid in alignment of the PDMS.\nCarefully place the bioreactor, baseplate down, into a 60 mm dish, then place the dish without its cover inside of a 10 cm dish, place the 10 cm cover on top, and move the entire bioreactor assembly into the tissue culture incubator, waiting two hours for the tissue to gel.",
    "After 2 hr, remove the bioreactor from the incubator and add 14 ml of NBS media to the entire assembly, enough to cover the baseplate. Return to the incubator, and change half of the media every day.\nForty-eight hr later, carefully remove the baseplate by gently moving each side of the baseplate off the frame a few millimeters at a time, change the media, then return the bioreactor, tissues facing down, to the media.\nContinue changing half of the NBS culture media every day.\n\t\tNote: Spontaneous contractions of the tissue can be observed as early as 3 days after tissue construction, generating measureable twitch forces as early as day 5 to 7.\nSubscription Required.
