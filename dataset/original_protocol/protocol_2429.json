    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue homogenization\nTiming: 5–10 min per sample\nBefore DNA extraction, we need to prepare the environmental background control and tissue homogenates, which is critical for DNA extraction (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2064-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Workflow of DNA extraction\nSet up environmental background control (EBC) by adding 200 μL PBS to glass homogenizer. After douncing, transfer PBS to EP tube.\nNote: As contaminants in the reagents are not easy to eliminate, it is essential to set up proper negative controls. We set up an environmental background control (EBC), using PBS as a tissue surrogate to undergo the same procedures as tissue samples. This control sample will help to determine the contamination landscape.\nPreparation of tissue homogenates.\nCut a small piece of tissue and weigh it in the 1.5 mL EP tube.\nUse a dissection scissor to mince the tissue into smaller pieces.\nAdd 1 mL sterile ice-cold PBS into the tube.\nNote: The optimal tissue size is about 200 mg. Overweight tissue (>200 mg) would significantly decrease the efficiency of genome extraction due to the limited binding capacity of the spin column.\nTransfer the tissue with PBS using wide-orifice tips to the glass homogenizer.\nNote: The glass homogenizer needs to be pre-chilled on ice, and the homogenization should be performed on ice. The wide-orifice tips can be prepared by cutting the tip with scissors.\nHomogenize the tissue until the tissue are fully disassembled.\nNote: Usually more than 10 dounces and around 1–3 min. The douncing times depend on tissue type, grinding force and grinding frequency. For example, human tissue is grinded harder than mouse tissue. Normal breast tissue is grinded harder than tumor tissue. Homogenize the tissue until the tissue are fully disassembled and become homogenate, and there is only some white connective tissue.",
    "Transfer the tissue slurry back to the 1.5 mL EP tube.\nCentrifuge the tissue homogenate with the table-top centrifuge at 4°C for 10 min.\nNote: The centrifuge should be turned on in advance and pre-chilled to 4°C. The minimum speed is 16,000 g.\nDiscard the supernatant and save the pellet for further DNA extraction.\nNote: For the PBS control samples, leave no more than 0.1 mL in the tube. At this step, tissue pellets can be stored at −80°C for future DNA extraction.\nCritical: Tumor dissection and processing should be strictly carried out in the clean and sterile biosafety cabinet with autoclaved dissection tools.\nCritical: All samples, reagents and homogenizer should be on ice all the time.\nDNA extraction from tissue\nTiming: 1–2 h\nSee Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nIn this step, tissue-resident bacterial DNA is extracted following the QIAamp® PowerFecal® Pro DNA Kit Handbook (QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA Kit qiagen.com[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-powerfecal-pro-dna-kit/]). The QIAamp PowerFecal (pro) procedure comprises four steps including lysis, binding, washing and elution. We optimized the procedure as indicated italicizing in tissue homogenization and below (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nSample lysis:\nTransfer the tissue and lysis buffer to PowerBead Pro Tube.\nSpin the PowerBead Pro Tube to ensure that the beads have settled at the bottom.\nTransfer 200 mg of tissue pellet and 800 μL of Solution CD1 to PowerBead Pro Tube and vortex to mix.\nNote: If samples are not freshly made, thaw the tissue pellets from step 2c on ice from −80°C.\nPerform the beads shearing for the samples in the PowerBead Pro Tubes with a TissueLyser II for 10 min at 30 Hz.\nNote: Adapters of TissueLyser II should be pre-chilled to −20°C.",
    "Note: Shaking is critical for complete shearing and cell lysis. Microbes are lysed by a combination of chemical agents in Solution CD1 and mechanical forces from beads. Vigorous shaking causes the collision between microbial cells and the beads, facilitating the microbes to be broken apart, which is essential for Gram+ bacteria DNA extraction.\nCentrifuge the PowerBead Pro Tube at 15,000 × g for 1 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a clean 2 mL Microcentrifuge Tube (kit provided).\nPreparation of binding suspension.\nAdd 200 μL of Solution CD2 to the supernatant and vortex for 5 s.\nNote: Solution CD2 contains Inhibitor Removal Technology (IRT), which can precipitate non-DNA organic and inorganic material including polysaccharides, cell debris and proteins. It is important to remove contaminating organic and inorganic substances that may reduce DNA purity and influence downstream DNA applications.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 1 min.\nTransfer up to 700 μL of supernatant to a clean 2 mL Microcentrifuge Tube (provided) and discard the pellet.\nNote: Expect 500–600 μL of the supernatant.\nNote: The pellet at this point contains non-DNA organic and inorganic material including polysaccharides, cell debris and proteins. For the best DNA yields and quality, avoid transferring any of the pellet.\nAdd 600 μL of Solution CD3 to the supernatant and vortex for 5 s.\nLoad 650 μL of the supernatant onto an MB Spin Column.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 1 min and discard the flow-through.\nLoad the rest of the supernatant onto an MB Spin Column and centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 1 min. Discard the flow-through.\nPreparation of washing.\nCarefully place the MB Spin Column into a clean 2 mL Collection Tube (provided).\nNote: Avoid splashing any flow-through onto the MB Spin Column.",
    "Add 500 μL of Solution EA to the MB Spin Column. Centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 1 min.\nDiscard the flow-through and place the MB Spin Column back into the same 2 mL Collection Tube.\nAdd 500 μL of Solution C5 to the MB Spin Column. Centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 1 min.\nDiscard the flow-through and place the MB Spin Column into a new 2 mL Collection Tube (provided).\nPreparation of elution.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 2 min. Carefully place the MB Spin Column into a new 1.5 mL Elution Tube (provided).\nAdd 100 μL of Solution C6 to the center of the white filter membrane, incubate at around 25°C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 1 min. Discard the MB Spin Column. The DNA is now ready for downstream applications.\nNote: We recommend storing the DNA frozen (–20°C or –80°C) as Solution C6 does not contain EDTA.\nNote: The final DNA concentration from 200 mg tissue is usually around 400–600 ng/μL.\nqPCR quantification\nTiming: 3–4 h\nTo quantify the total bacteria, the primer 1369F and 1492R, which cross V9 region is regarded as best and universal primer set for bacterial SSU rDNA quantification and is chosen. 1369 Forward 5′-CGGTGAATACGTTCYCGG-3′, 1492 Reverse 5′-GGWTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3ʹ, and Probe 5′-CTTGTACACACCGCCCGTC-3ʹ (5′ FAM and 3′ TAMRA) (Suzuki et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). Use the validated qPCR kit in ‘before you begin’ session. Change tips for each sample well and the experiment should be done in the RNA operation hood.\nPreparation for qPCR assay. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3].\nIrradiate the RNA operation hood including all tools and consumables to be used with UV light for 30 min.\nThaw Premix Ex Taq on ice. Mix, and centrifuge each component before use.",
    "Note: Set up metal bath at 4°C in advance and put them on 4°C metal bath.\nPrepare the qPCR primer pool as following and mix gently:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2064_1.csv\nNote: The probe has fluorophores, so it’s better to wrap the primer pool in aluminum foil to protect it from light.\nSet up the following reaction of Premix Ex Taq (probe qPCR) mix and primer pool.\nCalculate the number of samples including the standard curve, NTC, EBC and tissue samples.\nNote: Each sample need at least 2 replicates. Given the pipetting error, the total number of samples should be more than required.\nCombine the following reagents according to the sample size.\nMix gently, but thoroughly and centrifuge the reaction mix.\nAliquot evenly into 8-strip PCR tube (Nest# 404001).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2064_2.csv\nUse multichannel pipette to dispense 18 μL reaction mix accurately into the wells. For instance, the 96-well plate can be filled as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2064_3.csv\nNote: The 96-well plate contains the sample in triplicate. You can choose 8-strip qPCR tube (NEST#403012), 96 well-plate (Bio-Rad# HSP9655), or 384 plate (Axygen#PCR-384M2-C) for various numbers of samples.\nCritical: It is important to use fresh ddH2O aliquot (Invitrogen# 10977015) every time.\nAdd 2 μL of sample DNA, standards of E. coli and ddH2O as NTC, EBC to each corresponding qPCR plate well.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2064_4.csv\nNote: It is important to pipet accurately for qPCR accuracy. Be carefully to pipet and check the volume during all PCR set up.\nCritical: Due to the low biomass of tissue-resident bacteria, it is critical to set up controls including NTC and EBC and use filter tips for qPCR to minimize contamination.\nSeal the plate (Axygen# PCR-384M2-C) with plate sealing film (Bio-Rad #MSB1001), mix by gentle vortex, and spin down.",
    "Note: It’s better to choose transparent or semi-transparent plate. After spin down, double check the PCR volume, mark the suspicious wells.\nCritical: Seal carefully to avoid cross-contamination and smudging the surface of the film.\nQuantify by qPCR.\nLoad the plate to the qPCR machine (Jena# Qtower3G or qTOWEP384/G) and run the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2064_5.csv\nAnalyze the qPCR data.\nCheck the NTC, EBC wells for any amplification. Check the samples for good amplification and remove any low-quality replicates.\nGenerate the standard curve from E. coli genomic DNA by plotting the Ct values over the log (E. coli CFU) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAnalyze the PCR efficiency and R2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The acceptable efficiency of PCR is 90%–110% (equal to -3.58 to -3.1 of the slope) and the R2 >0.9.\nNote: The slope of the standard curve was calculated by linear regression analysis, which can represent PCR amplification efficiencies (E = (10−1/slope) – 1). A reaction with 100% efficiency will generate a slope of −3.32. PCR efficiency of 95%–105% is recommended. R2 of linear regression, which represents the variation of the data, should be more than 0.99. No Template Control (NTC) represents bacterial DNA contamination of qPCR reagents. The Ct value of NTC should be higher than standards (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nCalculate the equivalent bacteria of tissue samples according to a bacterial standard curve produced with E. coli DNA.\nNote: The abundance of bacteria is calculated by the following equation:\nAsample= Qsample/Vsample∗VTotal/Wsample. Asample: equivalent bacteria quantity per gram tissue (CFU/gram). Qsample: equivalent bacteria quantity according to standard curve (CFU). Vsample: Volume of genome sample used for qPCR (μL). Vtotal: Volume of total sample elution (μL). Wsample: Weight of sample for DNA extraction (g).\n16S library preparation and purification\nTiming: 10–12 h\nSee Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].",
    "To profile the bacteria community, in this step, we refer to the paper of Caporaso et al. and choose the hypervariable region 4 (V4 region) to prepare the library. The PCR primers F515/R806 developed against the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, are determined to yield most diverse bacteria (Caporaso et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The sequencing libraries of the extracted bacterial DNA from tissue are constructed according to the Illumina 16S metagenomics protocol (Part #15042322). The procedure is optimized by adding a biotin enrichment step due to the low biomass of tissue resident bacteria (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). To avoid contamination, prepare the sequencing libraries in an RNA hood and change tips between samples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2064-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
