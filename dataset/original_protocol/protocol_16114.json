    "This protocol is used to characterize genetic resources of the INCREASE project during SSD and subsequent seed increase cycles under controlled conditions. It can also be adopted by genebanks and research institutions to characterize seeds. The protocol will be used at the beginning of each primary and/or secondary seed increase cycle, and as soon as possible upon arrival of the seed, before using seeds for any experiment. The protocol includes a list of descriptors to be scored on lentil seeds.\nMaterials\nLentil seeds\nRuler\nAnalytical balance\nTemplate (spreadsheets) for data collection\n1. Record the following traits to be categorized based on the UPOV guidelines for lentil (UPOV, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0065]):\n         \nSeed: shape in longitudinal section\nSeed: pattern of secondary color\nSeed: cotyledon color (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-fig-0003] for reference)\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fa345cc6-0172-4a7a-9474-3659ab159a7e/cpz1134-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nHulled lentils in the three different colors.

Record and measure the following traits:\n         \nSeed: main color (primary color) based on visual observation and evaluation, and using the following categories (Vandenberg & Slinkard, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0138]; Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-fig-0004]): brown, tan, grey, green, black, clear (zero tannin), or other (describe).\nSeed: width (mm) based on measurement of ventral dimension, average of 5 seeds\nSeed: weight (g) measured on at least two samples of 100 intact seeds\nIf this number is not possible, seed weight should be measured on three samples of ten seeds.

    "This protocol describes the steps used to acquire image-based data from lentil seeds with the aim of providing a visual quality control of the propagation result and reference images for seed shape, color, and size. A comprehensive paper on digitization of collections based on Nelson, Paul, Riccardi, & Mast (2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0154]) is given in de la Hidalga, van Walsun, Rosin, Sun, & Wijers (2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0150]). Accordingly, the following requirements have to be fulfilled as the best practice standard.\nTwo imaging protocols are used for phenotyping lentil seed. One will be implemented for all four crops included in the INCREASE project (lentil, common bean, lupin, and chickpea) and is fully described in a common bean review included in this series of articles (Cortinovis et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0022]).\nThe second protocol is for high-throughput seed phenotyping and was developed and tested in lentil at the University of Saskatchewan (Halcro et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0055]). The imaging system captures top- and side-view images of single seeds as they pass underneath integrated RGB cameras. The images are processed and analyzed using the open-source, batch-based software phenoSEED (Halcro et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0055]), which returns data for seed size, shape, and color. The incorporation of three-dimensional shape analysis provides information about plumpness and symmetry.\nThe use of any imaging system for phenotyping eliminates potential operator biases and increases the rate of data acquisition. Operators of BELT were able to achieve 50 batches of seeds per hour, each batch containing around 200 seeds. That represents a significant improvement compared to manual dimensional measurement, which can be slow and imprecise (Halcro et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0055]).\nMaterials\nLentil seeds\nBELT imaging instrument (Halcro et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0055])\nSeed imaging station\nPython script phenoSEED (Halcro et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0055])\nComputer with at least 2.2 GHz CPU and 64 GB RAM\nServer for permanent storage of image files",
    "1. If the seed envelope has a barcode, allow the machine to scan it by placing the empty envelope under the collection funnel.\nThis will link the accession information to the image data acquired.\n2. Place lentil seeds in the feeder of the imaging system.\n3. If the barcode was scanned properly, start processing the seeds by clicking the touchscreen. If the barcode was not scanned properly or if there is no barcode, manually enter the accession information.\nTwo rows of individual seeds will be formed automatically on the conveyor and moved to the imaging dome.\n4. Allow time for acquisition of images of individual seeds inside the imaging dome.\nA typical sample size of 200 seeds is processed in 1.5 min. Two 5-MP cameras are utilized: one takes top-down images and the other uses a right-angle prism mirror to take side-view images.\n5. Following image acquisition, images are stored locally and named automatically according to sample ID (from barcode or information entered in step 3). Images are also displayed automatically, so the operator can quickly check them.\nAs each image occupies more than 6 MB of storage space, files should be moved manually by the operator to a permanent location each day. Saving on a server is recommended.\n6. Run the Python script phenoSEED to extract information about seed size, shape, color, pattern type, and intensity.\nA .csv file is generated containing the phenotypic data of the seed samples. The resulting data set can be used for downstream analyses.",

Fill 2.7-L pots with a soilless, peat-based potting mix that has been watered well.\nFor SSD purposes, the pot size can be reduced to speed up the growth cycle since only a few pods are required.\n2. Label each pot with identifying information.\n3. Sow 2-3 seeds per pot.\n4. Insert one irrigation pick into each pot.\nPlants are watered as required to keep pots from drying out. Watering may need to be increased post-flowering to ensure high seed yield. As soon as the plants start to turn yellow, watering should be reduced to encourage maturation.\n5. Set growing conditions for a 17-hr daylength with supplemental lighting as required.\nThe more real sunlight the better.\n6. Set temperature at 22°C day/18°C night.\n7. Thin to 1 plant per pot at the seedling stage.\n8. Water with 20-20-20 and 15-30-15 fertilizer solutions for vegetative and reproductive growth stages, respectively. Apply first fertilizer ∼10-15 days after planting at a concentration of 1 g/L and volume of 500 ml per 2.7-L pot. Gradually increase the volume as the plants grow.\n9. During the vegetative growth stage, insert a stake in each pot and attach to the plant with a twist/bubble tie or place a small cage in the pot to contain the plants (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-fig-0005]). Contain wild lentil plants in a mesh bag to catch the seeds before the pods shatter.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0647fa43-2633-4844-a6e0-4d36d880fba8/cpz1134-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nLentil seed increase under controlled conditions.

    "This protocol describes how to characterize lentil genetic resources of the INCREASE project during seed increase cycles under controlled conditions. It includes a list of phenotyping descriptors to be scored during the growth stages on each lentil genotype of the INCREASE Intelligent Collections (R-CORE, T-CORE, and H-CORE). The descriptors have been developed starting from IPGRI lentil descriptors (IBPGR, 1985[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0064]) and based on the UPOV guidelines (UPOV, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-bib-0065]), and have been modified specifically for purposes related to these SSD development activities.

Record the number of days after planting when plants have seeds in any single pod on nodes 10-13 of the basal primary branch and seeds that have swollen to their maximum size (physiological maturity) and fill more than half of the pod area (R5, Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.134#cpz1134-fig-0006]).",
    "At this stage, the seed coat is formed and there is a color change in the cotyledons. Genotypic variation in seed size and pod structure will require the use of discretion by the data recorder, as not all genotypes fill the pod cavity in the same way.\n17.

Pods that are considered mature will have changed color and be dry to the touch. Also, pod maturity is not always accompanied by yellowing of the pod. Some pods turn white, and some are pigmented and may have patterns.\n18. Record the presence/absence of pod pigmentation.\n19.
