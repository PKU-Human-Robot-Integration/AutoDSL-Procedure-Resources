    "Fly samples were obtained using traps and not on infested animals. A SISBIO license (67867-1) was issued to collect and keep flies of the Calliphoridae family in captivity in laboratory conditions. Insect samples are exempt from ethical evaluation in research in Brazil. Bovine meat and blood were obtained commercially, and no ethical clearance was required.\n1. Larval feeding preference\nPreparation of the Petri dishes containing 2% agar\n\t\nPrepare four Petri dishes with 2% agar. To do so, add 6 g of bacteriological agar to 300 mL of water and melt this mix in a microwave. Then, divide the volume evenly into four glass Petri dishes (150 x 20 mm), using around 70 mL in each dish.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare Petri dishes equal to the number of experimental replicates desired. In this study, 36 replicates were used.\nOnce the agar has solidified, use a 50 mL conical tube (3 cm diameter) to punch four holes in the agar, two on each side of the Petri dish, following the cutting pattern provided (Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: This setup is similar to previously described protocols by Fouche et al. (2021)40 and Boulay et al. (2016)42.\nPreparation of substrates\n\t\nTo prepare the fresh meat with blood, add 12 mL of diluted bovine blood to 200 g of fresh bovine ground meat. Mix thoroughly. Be sure to use different graduated cylinders and spoons for each type of meat to avoid cross-contamination between substrates.\n\t\tNOTE: The diluted blood is made up of 50% pure blood mixed with an anticoagulant (3.8% sodium citrate) and 50% filtered water.\nTo prepare the rotten substrate, add 12 mL of filtered water to 200 g of 5-day-old rotten bovine ground meat and mix it well.",
    "NOTE: Rotten meat was obtained by incubating fresh ground meat for five days at 25 °C in non-hermetic plastic pots (mix of aerobic and non-aerobic decomposition). Each pot contained 200 g of fresh ground meat. It was then frozen until use.\nFill two holes in each Petri dish with the fresh meat and blood mixture and the remaining two holes with the rotten meat and water mixture.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid position biases, vary the placement of the different meat types in the Petri dishes. For example, some Petri dishes should have the same type of meat facing each other, while in other dishes, the meat type should be crossed, as shown in Figure 2.\nExperimental setup\n\t\nAt a room temperature (RT) of 25 °C, position the heating pad directly below a light source to evenly illuminate the experimental area and avoid any behavior bias towards or against the light. Place paperboard pads around the heating pad to ensure that the experimental setup remains leveled.\n\t\tNOTE: The light source used was white low heating emitting light, such as a neon tube. The heating pad was positioned on a table right below the ceiling light bulbs (Figure 3).\nCover the heating pad and leveling paperboard pads with black cardboard and switch the heating pad on.\n\t\tNOTE: The black cardboard cover should be used to avoid visual cues that may bias the behavior assay.\nPlace six Petri dishes with agar and meat substrate over the black cardboard with two substrates, one of each type, on the heating pad and the other two off the surface of the heating pad (Figure 2). Let the substrates heat for approximately 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Condensation may form on the lid of the Petri dishes.\nLarval test",
    "Check the temperature of the substrates (cold side: 25 ± 2 °C; hot side: 33 ± 2 °C) with an infrared thermometer.\n\t\tNOTE: The heating pad stays on during the whole length of the experiment. Temperature measurements were made at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. Although the temperature did fluctuate by ± 2 °C, there was still at least an 8 °C temperature difference between the hot and cold conditions.\nAfter reaching the desired temperature, place five third-instar larvae in the center of each Petri dish using tweezers (Figure 2) and cover the Petri dishes with the lids. Let the choice experiment run for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Some larvae may crawl around the edges and on the lid of the Petri dishes. If any larva escapes, use a tweezer to place it back to the center of the Petri dish.\nAfter 10 min, get all the Petri dishes off of the heating pad and place them on a different surface to avoid continuing heating the substrates. Then, count the number of larvae in each substrate, as well as those that did not choose any substrate.\n\t\t​NOTE: Lucilia cuprina larvae stay in their chosen substrate, as observed in this experiment.\n2. Female oviposition site preference\nExperimental setup\n\t\nUse a regular shelf previously covered up with black cardboard and evenly illuminated with white LED light strips.\n\t\tNOTE: The black cardboard covers should be used to avoid visual cues that may bias the behavior assay. The white LED strips are secured lengthwise in the middle of the shelf right above the experiment. The shelves used in the setup were placed 45 cm apart.",
    "At RT (25 °C), place a heating pad in the center of the shelf. Use paperboard pads around the heating pad as a support to ensure that the experimental setup is leveled.\nCover the heating pad and leveling paperboard pads with a black cardboard to keep the same visual pattern below all the substrates.\nPlace two cross-shaped-glass containers on one shelf, each should have two arms over the black cardboard and heating pad. Switch on the white LED light strips and the heating pads prior to the start of the experiment.\nUse 70% ethanol to clean the crosses (inside the cross and the lid) to avoid odor contamination.\nPreparation of substrates\n\t\nPrepare four Petri dishes (60 mm x 15 mm) per cross with 5 g of 5-day-old rotten or fresh meat (two of each type of substrate).\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare Petri dishes equal to the number of experimental replicates desired times four. In this study 30 replicates were used, totaling 120 prepared Petri dishes.\nAdd 1 mL of diluted bovine blood (50% pure blood with anticoagulant and 50% filtered water) onto the fresh meat and 1 mL of filtered water onto the rotten meat. Thoroughly mix the meat (fresh or rotten) with the liquid (blood or water) using a different spoon for each type of meat.\n\t\tNOTE: The preparation of the meat for the female assay is very similar to the larval assay, although the quantities are different because the female test will be running for longer than the larval test. Remember to use different pipette tips and spoons for each type of meat to avoid any odor cross-contamination between substrates.",
    "Check if the alcohol has completely evaporated from the crosses. Then, place four Petri dishes (one of each type of meat on the heating pad and the other two off the heating pad's surface) at the extremity of each arm of the cross (Figure 4). Close the crosses with their lids and allow the substrates to heat for approximately 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: In addition, to avoid position biases, vary the placement of the different meat types in the crosses. For example, some crosses should have the same type of meat on adjacent arms, while in other crosses, the same meat type should be across from one another, as shown in Figure 4.\nFemale test\n\t\nCollect gravid females in the fly cage and isolate them into individual tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: Gravid females are characterized by having an enlarged and whitish-yellow abdomen in contrast to non-gravid females (Figure 5). Gravid females were collected between 10 and 16 days after emergence for the experiments.\nCheck the temperature of the substrates in the crosses (cold side: 25 ± 2 °C; hot side: 33 ± 2 °C) using an infrared thermometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Just like in the larval test, the heating pad stays on during the whole length of the experiment. Temperature measurements were made at the beginning and end of the experiment. Although the temperature did fluctuate by ± 2 °C, there was still at least an 8 °C temperature difference between the hot and cold conditions.",
    "Place the tube upside down containing one gravid female in the opening in the center of each cross. After the female enters the cross, remove the tube and close the opening with its small lid. After closing all the crosses, place a black cardboard in the front of the shelf to enclose the experimental setup. Let the experiment run for 4 h.\nAfter that, remove the female, by carefully catching it with a tube, and check if there were any eggs on the substrates.\nIdentify the lid of each Petri dish with substrate type from each cross. Use 70% ethanol to clean the crosses (inside the cross and the lid) from any odor from the test.\n\t\tNOTE: In case the eggs cannot be counted right after the experiment, the Petri dishes with substrates can be stored at -20 °C.\nEgg count\n\tNOTE: If the substrates in the Petri dishes were frozen, thaw them prior to counting.\n\t\nUse a stereomicroscope to count the number of eggs laid in each substrate. Use a brush and water to help separate the eggs to count them.\n3. Data analysis and statistics\nPreference indexes calculation\n\t\nFor each replicate of larval (n = 36) and female (n = 30) tests, calculate the Preference Index for meat (designated as PImeat) by determining the ratio of larvae or eggs present on Fresh substrates (Fresh hot and Fresh cold) to the total count of larvae or eggs on all substrates (fresh hot + fresh cold + rotten hot + rotten cold).\n\t\tPImeat = (# larvae or eggs on Fresh substrates) / # Total larvae or eggs\n\t\t​NOTE: The terms \"Hot\" and \"Cold\" are indicative of temperature conditions of 33 ± 2 °C and 25 ± 2 °C, respectively.",
    "Likewise, calculate the Preference Index for temperature (PItemp) for each replicate of larval and female tests as the number of larvae or eggs present on Hot substrates (fresh Hot and rotten Hot) divided by the total number of larvae or eggs on all substrates (fresh hot + fresh cold + rotten hot + rotten cold).\n\t\tPItemp = (# larvae or eggs on Hot substrates) / # Total larvae or eggs\n\t\t​NOTE: Values close to 1 reflect a preference for Fresh or Hot substrates and values close to zero indicate a preference for Rotten or Cold substrates. The PIs can be calculated manually or using the code provided (Supplemental Files S1 and Supplemental Files S2).\nComparison of the observed preference to simulated random data\n\t\nRun the provided code (Supplementary File S1 and Supplementary File S1) to generate the simulated data and to compare it with the observed data.",
    "NOTE: This code generates 1000 simulated random dataset for larvae and females and calculates the Preference Indexes (PIs) for each replicate of the simulated, and the observed data of L. cuprina. The simulations assume that both larvae and females exhibit no substrate preference and make random choices. The simulations incorporate key behavioral aspects of the animals, encompassing various scenarios such as: the probability of larvae not selecting any substrate, and adult females concentrating their egg-laying on a single substrate or distributing their eggs either uniformly or not among different substrates. Generalized Linear Models (GLM, family: quasibinomial; link: logit) were used to compare the observed data from the behavior assays with the simulated random data. The employed GLM was well-suited for this analysis due to the bounded nature of the Preference Index (PI), ranging between 0 and 1. GLMs are adept at handling non-normally distributed response variables and allow for robust statistical comparisons. This choice facilitated meaningful insights by enabling to effectively compare observed data from behavior assays with complex patterns generated by simulated random data. Minor adjustments to the code may be needed for other structured datasets.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
