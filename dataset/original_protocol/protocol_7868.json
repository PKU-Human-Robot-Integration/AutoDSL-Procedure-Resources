    "Note: We routinely produce RNA probes by in vitro transcription using a linearized pGEM clone that contains the DNA corresponding to RNA of interest. pGEM vector has T7 and SP6 promoters. Depending on the orientation of insert DNA either T7 polymerase or SP6 polymerase is used in in vitro transcription to generate RNA probe.    Preparation of RNA using in vitro transcription system   Prepare the following reaction in a 1.5 ml of microcentrifuge tube. 1 μl DNA template (~ 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA), 1 μl 10x RNA polymerase buffer, 1 μl rNTPs (5 mM ATP, CTP, 0.5 mM GTP, UTP), 1 μl cap analog (5 mM), 4.5 μl (45 μCi): a-32P-UTP (800 Ci/mmol; 10 mCi/ml), 0.5 μl RNase Inhibitor, and 1 μl SP6 polymerase a total of 10 μl of reaction.   Incubate 37 °C, for 3 to 6 hours (Note 1).    Add 90 μl dH2O to 10 μl total 100 μl.   Add equal volume of (100 μl) of phenol/chloroform, mix by vortexing.   Spin at 16,000 x g for 5 min.   Transfer upper layer into a new Eppendorf (~100 μl).   Add 33 μl 10 M ammonium acetate and 250 μl 100% ethanol to the 100 μl.   Incubate at -80 °C for 10 min.   Spin at 16,000 x g for 10 min.   Wash the pellet with 500 μl of 80% ethanol.   Air dry the pellet; resuspend in 10 μl RNA loading dye.   Heat 1 min at 90 °C.   Load on 5% denaturing acrylamide gel and run for one to two hours depending on the size of RNA (Note 2).   Disassemble the gel chamber and dismantle the gel, leaving it mounted on one plate. To facilitate the alignment of the gel to the X-ray film in stepA16 below, cut one corner of the gel.",
    "Wrap the gel with Saran wrap to avoid contamination.   Expose the gel to an X-ray film for 2-5 min and develop the film to visualize radioactive bands.   Align the gel on top of the X-ray film and locate the region in the gel corresponding to the radioactive band on the film.    Excise the gel corresponding to the band on the X-ray film (see Figure 1 and Notes 3 & 4).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131118/20131118194328_7006.jpg Figure 1. In vitro transcribed RNA used in Figure 2a and 2b. After exposing the gel to an X-ray film, identified the right size of RNA product, excised the gel corresponding to the band and used to extract RNA.    Transfer the excised band to 400 μl of TNS solution in an Eppendorf tube and incubate overnight at room temperature.   Next day, take out TNS solution, which contains radiolabelled RNA and add equal volume of phenol/chloroform, mix by vortexing.   Spin at 16,000 x g for 10 min.   Wash the pellet with 500 μl of 80% ethanol.   Dry the pellet; resuspend the RNA pellet in 20 μl H2O.   Measure radioactivity in1 μl of RNA using liquid scintillation counter and use this number to calculate concentration of labeled “U” residues in RNA probe (Note 5).   Dilute RNA probe with RNase free water to 50 to100 K cpm/μl for use in EMSA assays.      Preparation and purification of recombinant protein  For EMSA analysis apart from RNA a purified protein of interest is needed. One can generate this protein by cloning the cDNA into a bacterial expression vector. Here we expressed SR45 in E.coli as an S.tag fusion and purified it using S-protein agarose beads.   Grow E. coli BL21 (DE3)-pLysS host cells harboring SR45 cDNA in LB medium containing ampicillin at 37 °C for overnight.",
    "Next day inoculate 1 ml of overnight culture into 100 ml of LB medium containing appropriate antibiotic, then grow culture until OD600 reaches ~0.6 (it will take approximately 2 h).   Induce expression of recombinant protein by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and allow the bacterial culture to grow for an additional 4 h at 30 °C.    Harvest bacterial cells by centrifugation at 2,350 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.   Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1/10 culture volume (5 ml) of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA.   Add lysozyme to a concentration of 100 μg/ml; use a 10 mg/ml stock freshly prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA. Then add 1/10 volume (0.5 ml) of 1% Triton X-100. Incubate at 30 °C for 15 min.   Place the tube in an ice bath and sonicate 4 times (at 3.5 setting) for 15 sec/each time.    Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant contains soluble proteins.   Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 micron membrane.   Add 100 μl of binding/wash buffer to 100 μl of S-protein Agarose slurry in an Eppendorf tube and mix it gently, then add 1 ml of soluble proteins from step 8 (Note 6).    Mix and incubate at room temperature on an orbital shaker for 30 min. (Do not shake vigorously as this may denature protein).   Centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and carefully decant supernatant and wash the beads with five times, 1 ml each time, with binding/wash buffer.   Resuspend the washed beads containing the bound protein in 150 μl of the 0.2 M citrate buffer, pH 2.   Incubate for 10 min at room temperature, mix gently every few minutes.",
    "Neutralized by adding 8 μl 2 M Tris-base (pH 10.4).    The eluted proteins were dialyzed against phosphate buffer (Note 7).      Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) Before setting up the reaction, prepare 5% non-denaturing (native) gel, and pre-run the gel at 200 V using 1x TBE buffer for 10 to 15 minutes.   Prepare the following reaction mixture (final volume 14 μl) in a 1.5 ml of microcentrifuge tube. 1.5 μl of 1 mM spermidine (100 mM), 3 μl of 5x gel shift buffer, 0.5 μl of RNase Inhibitor, 1 μl of radiolabel RNA (50-100 K cpm), x μl lysis buffer (depending on protein volume) and x μl of protein of interest (Note 8).   Incubate at 30 °C for 5 min.   Add 1 μl of Heparin Sulfate (50 mg/ml) (Note 9).   Transfer the reactions to ice for 5 min.   Add 3 μl 6x urea free loading buffer.   Load the reaction products on 5% non-denaturing gel and run at 200 V for 2 to 3 h or as long as necessary for good separation (normally we will run 2 h for RNA probe that is about 200 nt) (Note 10).    Transfer the gel to Whatman filter paper, cover with Saran wrap, and dry with a gel-drying apparatus.   The dried gel should be exposed to the phosphorimaging screen for 2 h to overnight.   Free RNA and RNA – Protein complex(es) are visualized by using phosphorimager (see Figure 2a and 2b).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131118/20131118193734_9700.jpg Figure 2. RNA EMSA. A. EMSA with an RNA probe using a purified recombinant protein. Lane 1, free probe; lanes 2-5, increasing concentration of recombinant protein. B. Binding of recombinant protein to RNA probe is competed by cold RNA. Lane 1, free probe; lane 2, probe + recombinant protein; lanes 3-7, as lane 2, with increasing concentration of cold RNA.",
    "Arrows indicate free probe, and the RNA-protein complex is indicated by arrowheads.      Competition with unlabeled RNA After confirming the binding of a protein with a specific RNA target using EMSA, the specificity of interaction can be tested by competition studies in the presence of excess amount of same RNA that is not labeled. Increasing amount of competitor RNA (up to 100x of labeled RNA) is added to the binding reaction mixture and the ability of the cold competitor RNA to disrupt the complex is determined as above using native gel electrophoresis (see Figure 2b). Unlabeled competitor RNAs is generated in the same manner as above (see A section), except that the amount of cold UTP is increased to 5 mM and the amount of radioactive UTP is reduced to 0.045 μCi."
