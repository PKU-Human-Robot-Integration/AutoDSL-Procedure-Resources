    "GIST-T1 cell culture, seeding, and plasmid transfections Seed GIST-T1 cells in 5 mL of Fluorobrite media at a density of 33% (~400,000–600,000 cells) in a T25 tissue culture flask.Note: Fluorobrite media avoids fluorescence from phenol red. Culture cells for ~1–2 days up to a density of 75%–80% in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Split cells by aspirating media from the flask in a cell culture hood and washing cells with 37 °C PBS twice.After removing PBS, add 0.5 mL of phenol-red free trypsin EDTA to the flask and make sure the entire surface area of the flask is covered.Then, place flask in incubator for 2–3 min to allow cells to lift from flask. Verify that cells have lifted.Add 2 mL of Fluorobrite media to trypsinized cells to neutralize trypsin and add cells at density mentioned in step A1 with 5 mL of Fluorobrite media or proceed with step A6.Seed 50 μL of trypsinized cells in 8-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/mL two days prior to imaging. Add 400 μL of media to each well after plating cells, and culture as in step A1.Note: Cell concentration was measured using a hemocytometer, and Fluorobrite media was used to dilute cells to find appropriate concentration. Approximately 15–17 h before imaging, mix 200 ng of telomere 2xMS2 gRNA plasmid to generate gRNA along with 50 ng of MCP-HaloTag and 50 ng of dCas9-GFP plasmids with 10 μL of Opti-MEM, 1 μL of Lipofectamine 3000 reagent, and 0.5 μL of p300 reagent in a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube and incubate the DNA/lipid mixture for 15 min at room temperature in a sterile cell culture environment.",
    "During incubation of step A7, aspirate media from GIST-T1 cells in a well plate and wash cells twice with 300 μL of Fluorobrite media heated to 37 °C. Then, add 100 μL of Fluorobrite media supplemented with 4 mM L-Glutamine, 1% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 200 μL of Opti-MEM. Then, place cells in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 15 min.After 15 min of incubation in step A8, remove cells from incubator, place in cell culture hood, and add all of the DNA/lipid mixture from the Eppendorf tube to cells in each well already supplemented with serum-diluted media by pipetting dropwise. If too much force is used, DNA/lipid complex may disassociate.Place wells with transfecting cells in the incubator as in step A2 for 15–17 h.Remove media from wells and wash cells twice with serum-diluted Fluorobrite media. Add 300 μL of serum-diluted Fluorobrite media with 100 nM of PA-JF646 dye and incubate for 15 min in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.Note: PA-JF646 is a far-red fluorescent dye that is photoactivated by 405 nm light and contains a ligand that attaches to HaloTag [20,21]. This dye has a higher photon budget and longer on-times compared to other photoswitchable proteins, which results in improved detection, localization precision, and longer single molecule trajectories. This improves trace mobility analysis and diffusion coefficient estimation. This dye isn’t fluorogenic and does fluoresce when not bound to HaloTag, which is why multiple rounds of washing are required before imaging. After incubation, wash cells three times with Fluorobrite media and place in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for an additional 30 min.Repeat step A12 three additional times prior to imaging to remove unbound PA-JF646 dye that is still able to fluoresce.",
    "Keep samples in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until imaging.Calibration and imaging experiments Note: All experiments presented here were performed with a custom-built microscope, as recently described [22]; however, our protocol is applicable to data recorded with any microscope capable of simultaneous PALM and conventional fluorescence imaging in the respective channels. In short, a Nikon inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti-E) is equipped with a perfect focus system and an Andor iXon 897 Ultra DU-897U electron multiplying charge coupled detector (EMCCD), cooled to -70 °C and set to an amplifying gain of 30. The four 100 mW excitation lasers (405, 488, 561, and 640 nm OBIS-CW, Coherent Optics) are aligned, expanded, and focused into the back focal plane of the objective (Nikon CFI 100× 1.49 NA oil immersion) using various dichroic mirrors, beam expanders, and lenses. A quad band dichoric mirror (ZT405/488/561/640rpc; Chroma) separates fluorescence emission from excitation light. Fluorescence emission is further split into the far red and green signal using a dichroic long pass beam splitter (FF652-Di01; Semrock) and band pass filters FF731/137 (Semrock) for the far-red channel and ET525/50 (Chroma) for the green channel. Laser intensity modulation and shutter sequences are synchronized with the camera and controlled digitally with a NI-DAQ board. Mount microscope No. 1 cover glass or 8-well plates with 10 μL of TetraSpeck microspheres diluted 1:100 in DI water on microscope stage.Excite microspheres separately using 640 and 488 nm excitation with approximately 1.75 mW power (power density ~100 W/cm2 in sample plane). Record a 100-frame movie with approximately 10 sparsely distributed microspheres over the entire field of view without moving the sample and use the first 50 frames to record 640 nm excited microspheres and the last 50 frames to record 488 nm excited microspheres.",
    "Move the same microspheres to different positions in the camera to sample the entire field of view and repeat steps B2 and B3 at least five times. You can also image different microspheres placed in different regions across the field of view.Note: The number of microspheres used depends on the field of view of the camera. Our field of view was 256 × 256 pixels with a pixel size of 160 nm. You need at least 50 microspheres to create an accurate transformation with sub 20 nm registration error (see Figure 1). More microspheres or more images with microspheres shifted to different locations are necessary if your field of view is larger. Microsphere imaging can also be done after cellular imaging but should be done either before or after every imaging session, since registration parameters can change from session to session. This data will be used later to transform localizations from 640 nm channel to the 488 nm channel. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4850/bioprotoc-13-20-4850-g001.jpgFigure 1. Example microsphere localization rendering.

(A) Microspheres imaged in each channel to calculate the transformation matrix. (B) The transformation matrix is applied to transform bead localizations from the Jf646 channel to the GFP channel. This transformation matrix is then applied to single molecule localizations. Scale bars: 5 µm.Remove microsphere sample and mount 8-well plate with transfected cells on microscope stage. Make sure the stage is heated to 37 °C and the CO2 incubator on microscope stage reads 5%.",
    "Using the Storm Control Software (or equivalent for a different microscope system), set up a 10-frame laser shutter sequence at 20 Hz with the first frame having 488 nm excitation for GFP imaging, the second having brightfield LED and 405 nm photoactivation, and frames 3–10 having 640 nm excitation for PALM imaging.Note: The diffusion coefficient distributions of MCP-HaloTag with and without telomere gRNA taken at 20 Hz are statistically similar to the ones obtained at 60 Hz. While faster PALM imaging speeds in principle reduce motion blurring, the required higher excitation power reduces the length of single molecule traces, and thus lowers the precision for characterizing their motion. In our experience, a 20 Hz frame rate has been a good compromise between imaging speed, localization precision in each frame, and single molecule trace lengths. Set the 488 nm laser power to 1.75 mW (power density ~100 W/cm2 at sample plane) and the 640 nm to 17.5 mW (~1 kW/cm2). The 405 nm intensity will be adjusted to 1–251 μW (power density of ~0.06–15 W/cm2) during the experiment for constant photoactivation rates.Turn on the 488 nm laser to visually identify cells with telomere puncta in cell nucleus prior to single molecule imaging. Keep 488 nm exposure to a minimum to reduce bleaching. Image telomere puncta conventionally using the 488 nm laser for at least 200 frames at 20 Hz for interpolation error analysis.Note: Cells transfected with all three plasmids should show clear telomere puncta. Since cells are transiently transfected, some cells express all transfected plasmids while others do not. Look at cells that do not have gRNA but have MCP-HaloTag+PA-JF646 dye and dCas9-GFP expressed, and cells stained with only PA-JF646 dye and no transfected plasmids to characterize single molecule and conventional fluorescence background (see Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4850/bioprotoc-13-20-4850-g002.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Examples of fluorescence images from transfected cells suitable and unsuitable for experiments. (A) Example of cellular autofluorescence. (B) and (C) Examples of cells expressing dCas9-GFP at various levels but without distinct telomere puncta due to the lack of gRNA. This can also occur with gRNA added. (D) and (E) Examples of telomere puncta at various expression levels suitable for imaging and analysis. Nuclei are marked with red line. Scale bars: 5 μm.Once cells with telomere puncta are identified, begin 10-frame shutter and acquisition sequence. Start with 405 nm laser power of 1 μW (power density of ~0.06 W/cm2) and slowly increase at a rate of 5–10 μW every 1,000 frames until approximately 250 μW (power density of ~0.015 W/cm2) to ensure a sparse and consistent photoactivation rate (see Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4850/bioprotoc-13-20-4850-g003.jpgFigure 3. Optimal photoactivation density. (A) Single frame of an optimal photoactivation density for single molecule tracking with low false linking rate. Yellow boxes are identified localizations from single-molecule emission events. (B) Example images of the maximal allowable localization density for single molecule tracking with acceptable false linking. (C) Examples of images with high-localization density that would result in a high false linking rate. False linking rates for example images are quantified in Figure 5. Scale bar: 5 μm.Record data for 15,000–30,000 frames and stop sequence when cells start to change morphology indicating a decline of cell health (see Figure 4).Note: Healthy GIST-T1 cells never change their morphology up to 15,000 frames. Only analyze and use frames up to 5,000 frames before morphology changes are detected, to exclude potential phototoxic effects prior to morphological changes. If cells start to change morphology sooner, cells are not healthy enough to begin with for imaging experiments (see Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4850/bioprotoc-13-20-4850-g004.jpgFigure 4. Cell morphology and health.",
    "LED + 405 nm photoactivation frames of healthy GIST-T1 cells (top) typically show retained morphology and size for at least 15,000 frames and show minimal autofluorescence upon 405 nm activation. Unhealthy cells (bottom) change morphology and become round within several thousand frames and show significant autofluorescence in response to 405 nm activation. Healthy cells also show much less contrast in the LED frame due to a more homogenous refractive index. Scale bars: 5 μm.Repeat steps B5–B9 to obtain more statistics from different cells. Typically, a number on the order of 10 cells is considered satisfactory."
