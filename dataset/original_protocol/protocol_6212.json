    "Design of sgRNASingle guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with high efficiency and specificity can be designed by using gRNA design webtools. We recommend CHOPCHOP (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no[href=http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/]) because of its user-friendly interface (Labun et al., 2016). Also, you may find the guide design resources on the website of Feng Zhang’s lab (https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources[href=https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources]). The sgRNA should target early exons (near transcriptional start site) or essential exons of gene function. We usually choose 4 to 6 target sites on early exons which do not have the start codon because frameshift mutations near the start codon can lead to translation from other in-frame ATGs, resulting in the expression of a functional protein. If the target sequence is 5’-CGCAGGACCAGACCCCATAATGG-3’ [Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is labeled in blue], synthesize 5’-caccgCGCAGGACCAGACCCCATAA-3’ (sense) and 5’-aaacTTATGGGGTCTGGTCCTGCGc-3’ (anti-sense) to clone the guide sequence into pX458 (Ran et al., 2013) sgRNA scaffold (Figure 3A). cacc (lower case) in the first oligo and aaac (lower case) in the second oligo are overhangs for cloning into BbsI-site in pX458. We also add “g” between cacc and the target sequence in the first oligo because the human U6 promoter prefers “g” at the transcription start site for strong expression. Also, you may design primers using CHOPCHOP to amplify the target site for further evaluation of sgRNAs using the T7 endonuclease I assay (see Procedure C).Cloning of sgRNAs into the spCas9 expressing plasmid (pX458)Digestion of pX458 with BbsI:table:\n﻿0,1\nX μl,pX458 (10 μg)\n5 μl,10x NEB cut smart\n1 μl,BbsI-HF\n24 - X μl,MilliQ water\n30 μl,in total\nIncubate at 37 °C overnight.Gel purify the plasmid using QIAquick Gel extraction kit.

Note: 60-70% of colonies have a correct insertion in our experience.  Purify the plasmid from 1 ml of the overnight culture using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit.Elute the plasmid with 50 μl of buffer EB and determine the concentrationVerify the plasmid by sequencing with a primer (5’-gactatcatatgcttaccgt-3’).(Optional) Evaluation of sgRNA by T7 endonuclease I assayPlate NIH3T3 cells at the density of 2.5 x 104 cells (500 μl/well, DMEM/10% FBS/1% Penicillin /1% Streptomycin) onto a well of 24-well plate.Incubate in a 37 °C CO2 incubator overnight.TransfectionAdd 1.5 μl of FuGENE6 reagent to 50 μl of serum-free DMEM in a 1 ml plastic tube and mix by vortexing.Incubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature.Add 0.5 μg of pX458-sgRNA or control vector to the mixture and mix by vortexing.Incubate the mixture for 30 min at room temperature.Add the mixture to each well of a 24-well plate containing cells.Incubate in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 24 h.Replace the cell culture media with fresh one (DMEM/10% FBS/1% Penicillin /1% Streptomycin).Repeat Steps C3d-C3e. Note: Repeated transfection is essential for high expression of Cas9 and sgRNA to edit the target gene in NIH3T3 cells. Incubate in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 48 h.Remove the supernatant of cells by pipetting and wash cells with 500 μl of 1x PBS.",

Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Run on 2% agarose gel and verify bands in sgRNA transfected-wells compared with control wells (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190815/20190815210726_7577.jpgFigure 2. Agarose gel electrophoresis of T7 endonuclease I-digested PCR products derived from NIH3T3 cells transfected with sgRNA and Cas9. The target exon was PCR-amplified and gel purified. After the denaturation and annealing, the PCR product was digested by T7 endonuclease I and run on 2% agarose gel. The asterisk indicates cleaved DNA fragment. In this experiment, we found only one shorter fragment. However, you may find bands of two different sizes after the cleavage if you carefully design the primers. It can be useful to design PCR primers such that the indel resulting from genome editing is not in the middle of the amplicon, ultimately resulting in two cleaved bands of different sizes.You can quantify the efficiency of gene modification based on the result of T7 endonuclease I assay. The percentage of cleavage on a gel could be converted to the percentage of gene modification by using an equation below.",
    "% gene modification = 100 x (1 - (1 - fraction cleaved)1/2 )(Guschin et al., 2010) Also, you may evaluate the efficiency of gene editing by a webtool called Synthego’s ICE (https://ice.synthego.com/#/[href=https://ice.synthego.com/#/]). Target exons from edited or unedited (control) cells are PCR-amplified and Sanger sequenced. You may submit the results of sequencing to the webtool and ICE compares these sequence traces to give a detailed analysis of gene editing. Tandem cloning of two sgRNAs into pAAV EF1α DIO mCherryIn Procedure A, you clone several sgRNAs targeting the same gene. For the efficient gene disruption, you tandemly clone two different sgRNAs driven by independent human U6 promoters into an AAV vector (Figures 3B and 3C) using the Gibson Assembly method. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190815/20190815210809_5388.jpgFigure 3. Construction strategy of a dual sgRNA viral vector. A. Cloning of guide oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides with 20-nt guide sequence and overhangs for cloning into BbsI site in pX458 were annealed and cloned into BbsI-digested pX458. B. Cloning of U6 promoter-driven sgRNAs. U6 promoter followed by sgRNA1 or sgRNA2 were PCR amplified, respectively, by using primers with overhangs for Gibson Assembly. C. Gibson Assembly of the dual sgRNA virus vector.
