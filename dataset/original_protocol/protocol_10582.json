    "Human plasma and urine was collected from healthy volunteer donors, with written informed consent, following George Mason University Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Donors were equally distributed between Caucasian males and females between the ages of 25 and 42. Samples were analyzed individually and were not pooled.\n1. Nanoparticle Processing of Serum or Plasma Samples\nPotential low abundant biomarkers in plasma are captured, in solution, with hydrogel nanoparticles. The particles are added to the plasma, incubated, separated by centrifugation, washed, and the captured proteins are eluted. The eluted proteins are dried under nitrogen flow for downstream mass spectrometry sequencing and identification.\nDilute 500 µl of serum 1:2 with 50 mM TrisHCl pH 7 (500 µl serum + 500 µl TrisHCl) in a microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 500 µL of poly(NIPAm/AAc) core nanoparticles. Incubate for 15 min at RT.\nSpin the sample at 16,100 x g, 25 °C for 10 min in a centrifuge equipped with a fixed-angle rotor. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 500 µl sodium thiocyanate (25 mM) to the pellet. Resuspend the nanoparticles by vigorously pipetting up and down multiple times.\nSpin the sample at 16,100 x g, 25 °C for 10 min in a centrifuge with a fixed angle rotor. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 500 µl of MilliQ water to the nanoparticle pellet. Resuspend the nanoparticles by vigorously pipetting up and down multiple times.\nSpin the sample at 16,100 x g, 25 °C for 10 min in a centrifuge with a fixed angle rotor. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nPrepare fresh elution buffer: Add 700 µl acetonitrile to 300 µl ammonium hydroxide in a clean tube. Caution: Ammonium hydroxide is corrosive. Use with appropriate ventilation. Note: The elution buffer must be prepared immediately before use. Do not store the elution buffer.",
    "Add 300 µl of elution buffer to the nanoparticle pellet. Resuspend the nanoparticles by vigorously pipetting up and down multiple times. Incubate for 15 min at RT.\nSpin the sample at 16,100 x g, 25 °C for 10 min in a centrifuge with a fixed angle rotor. Remove and save the eluate in a clean, labeled microcentrifuge tube.\nRepeat steps 1.9 – 1.10. Combine the two eluates into one microcentrifuge tube.\nDry the eluates under nitrogen flow in a nitrogen evaporator manifold at 42.1 °C, with air flow set to 8 (Figure 2F).\nStore the dried eluate at RT for O/N storage, or at -20 °C for long term storage, prior to mass spectrometry, western blotting, or ELISA assays (optional).\n2. Nanoparticle Processing of Urine Samples\nNormal urine contains less than 30 mg/dl protein and less than 1+ blood. However, many diseases/conditions may alter the normal levels of urine protein and blood. To aid in determining the optimal volume of nanoparticles to add to the urine sample, a urinalysis is performed prior to nanoparticle harvesting. Urine biomarkers may exist in extremely low concentrations, which may require optimizing the ratio of nanoparticles to urine volume. This procedure describes nanoparticle harvesting of urine samples for downstream western blot analysis.\nCollect urine samples in a clean, dry plastic cup. A 22 ml minimum volume is required. Store urine specimens at -80 °C until ready to analyze.\nThaw the frozen urine at RT or at 4 °C O/N. Mix briefly on a vortex mixer. Pour at least 22 ml of urine into a 50 ml conical bottom polypropylene tube.",
    "Spin the urine in a centrifuge with a swing-out rotor at 3,700 x g for 15 min. Decant the urine, without disturbing the pellet, into a clean 50 ml conical bottom polypropylene tube. Discard the pellet.\nPerform urinalysis using a multi-analyte “urine dipstick” reagent strip. Note: store the reagent strips in a tightly closed container away from direct sunlight and humidity17, 18.\n\t\nLay the reagent strip, face-up, on a clean, dry paper towel.\nUse a disposable pipette to aspirate 1 ml of the urine prepared in step 2.3.\nSet a timer for 2 min but do not start it. Quickly dispense 1 - 2 drops of urine on each test pad of the reagent strip. Immediately start the timer. Note: Do not submerge the reagent strip directly in the urine container. The dye/chemical indicators in the reagent strip can potentially leach out of the reagent strip into the urine container.",
    "At the time indicated on the reagent strip container, record the qualitative results for the various analytes on the reagent strip by comparing the color of the individual reagent strips to the corresponding color-coded indicators on the reagent container. Typical normal urine results are: (normal or negative) for blood, protein, leukocytes, nitrite, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, and urobilinogen; Urine pH (5.5 - 7.0); specific gravity (1.001 - 1.020). Note: High protein levels in a urine specimen may compete with the protein of interest for binding sites on the nanoparticles. To maximize protein harvesting with nanoparticles, the nanoparticle volume/urine volume ratio can be adjusted to either limit competition from high abundance proteins, or can be optimized to harvest proteins that exist in very low concentrations. If the urine protein value is 1+ or greater, add 2x volumes of nanoparticles in step 2.5 below. If the analyte of interest is a very low abundant protein, it may be necessary to increase the volume of nanoparticles up to 2 ml (Figure 3).\nTransfer 20 ml of the clarified urine from step 2.3 into a clean 50 ml conical bottom polypropylene tube. Do not disturb any debris/pellet that may be in the bottom of the urine tube. Add 200 µl of nanoparticles to the 20 ml urine sample. Mix briefly on a vortex mixer. Note: If the urine protein value is 1+ or greater, add 400 µl of nanoparticles to 20 ml urine.\nIncubate the urine/nanoparticle mixture for 30 min at RT, without rocking/mixing.\nSpin the urine/nanoparticle suspension in a centrifuge equipped with a swing-out rotor at 3,700 x g for 10 min. Note: If a pellet is not visible following centrifugation, spin the samples for an additional 2 – 7 min.",
    "Remove and discard the supernatant. Add 500 µl MilliQ water to the nanoparticle pellet.\nResuspend the nanoparticles by vigorously pipetting up and down multiple times. Transfer the nanoparticle solution to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin the nanoparticles in a centrifuge equipped with a fixed-angle rotor at 16,100 x g for 10 min. Note: If a pellet is not visible following centrifugation, spin the samples for an additional 2 – 7 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 2.8 and 2.11 (twice) with 200 µl 18 MilliQ water to wash the nanoparticles.\nPrepare fresh elution buffer: Add 970 µl acetonitrile to 30 µl ammonium hydroxide in a clean tube. Caution: Ammonium hydroxide is corrosive. Use with appropriate ventilation. Note: The elution buffer must be prepared immediately before use. Do not store the elution buffer.\nAdd 20 μl elution buffer to the nanoparticle pellet. Resuspend the nanoparticles by vigorously pipetting up and down multiple times. Incubate for 15 min at RT.\nSpin the nanoparticle samples at 16,100 x g for 10 min. Remove and save the supernatant in a clean, 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Do not disrupt the nanoparticle pellet. Discard the pellet in the biohazard trash.\nPlace the samples in a rack in a chemical fume hood. Open the caps and incubate at RT for 30 min. Alternatively, place the samples under nitrogen flow at 40 °C until dry (1 - 2 hr).\nAdd 15 µl Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (2x) to the samples. Heat at 100 °C in a dry heat block for 5 min with the caps open or until the volume left in the tube is no more than 20 µl. Note: do not use a boiling water bath. The humidity from the water bath will prevent evaporation of the buffer.",
    "Place the cap on the tubes. Remove the tubes from the heat block. The sample can be stored at -80 °C or used immediately for downstream western blot analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
