    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nNOTE: This procedure is performed on mice with an open craniotomy, as a modified version of the protocol by Mostany and Portera-Cailliau19 wherein the bone tissue that is surgically removed is discarded, leaving the brain accessible for establishment and eventual resection of GBM tumors. Following craniotomy, tumors are established via stereotactic implantation as described in Ozawa and James20. We implant 1 x 105 U87 mCh-Fl cells at the following stereotactic coordinates (in mm from bregma): (2.5, 0, -0.5).\n1. Cell Culture and Scaffold Preparation\nNOTE: Scaffolds should be prepared 48 h prior to implantation in mice. The following volumes are provided on a per-scaffold basis. Multiply quantities as needed for additional scaffolds.\nCut PLA scaffolds into resection cavity-sized (approximately 2 mm x 2 mm) pieces. Scaffolds can be cut by hand using scissors or using a hole punch for repeatability.\nSterilize by immersing in 70% ethanol for 15 min followed by immersing in PBS. Place scaffold in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin while preparing cells for seeding.\nLift cultured MSCs using 0.05% trypsin (3-5 mL for a T75 flask). Incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Ensure that the cells have lifted, then add 7-10 mL DMEM to the flask to inactivate trypsin.\nTransfer flask contents to a 15-mL centrifuge tube. Count cells using a hemocytometer. Pellet 5 x 105 MSCs for each scaffold via centrifugation at 100 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate off supernatant and resuspend MSCs in 5 µL DMEM per 5 x 105 cells.\nPrepare the scaffolds for seeding by patting them dry.",
    "Remove a scaffold from DMEM immersion with forceps and temporarily place it on the lid of the 6-well plate. Lift the scaffold off the lid, leaving behind a droplet of excess DMEM.\nPlace the scaffold back on the lid again in a new, dry location. Repeat 3-5 times, then place the partially dried scaffold in a new 6-well plate for seeding. Repeat for each scaffold.\n\t\tNOTE: A partially dried scaffold provides optimal cell seeding results. If the scaffold is too wet, cells will slide off the scaffold and adhere to the well plate below. If the scaffold is too dry, the droplet will not spread over the entire scaffold, resulting in poor initial cell distribution.\nUsing a pipette, gently mix the vial of stem cells to homogenize the suspension as some cells may have settled to the bottom.\nSlowly pipette 2.5 µL freshly mixed MSC suspension directly on the scaffold, creating a small droplet over the top of the scaffold.\nAdd 300 µL DMEM to edges of each well. This will prevent rapid evaporation of the cell droplet. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min, allowing the cells to attach to the scaffold.\nWith forceps, gently flip the scaffolds over in the well plate. Seed 2.5 µL freshly mixed MSC suspension (this results in a total of 5 x 105 cells seeded per scaffold). Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min, allowing the cells to attach to the scaffold.\nCover the scaffolds in DMEM by adding 2 mL to each well of the 6-well plate. Gently lift the scaffolds to allow media to flow underneath them. Incubate at 37 °C in this state for 48 h prior to implantation surgery.",
    "Check the scaffolds after 24 h and add/change media if excess evaporation or discolored media due to pH imbalance is observed.\n2. Fluorescence-guided Resection and Scaffold Implantation\nNOTE: Sterilize all tools prior to initializing surgery. Administer prophylactic analgesia as outlined in your institutional IACUC protocol.\nPlace the stereotaxic frame on the stage of a fluorescence dissecting stereomicroscope.\nAnesthetize the mouse under inhaled isoflurane in an induction chamber. Once anesthetized, secure the mouse in the stereotaxic frame with continuous inhaled anesthesia supply via an isoflurane nose cone adapter. Maintain body temperature with a heating pad and/or probe.\n\tNOTE: 4-5% isoflurane is suitable for induction and 2-3% is suitable for maintenance, but this must be adapted and monitored for each mouse.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent drying of the cornea. Sterilize the incision site of the scalp with a series of three alcohol and three betadine wipes.\nPerform toe pinch reflex test on each limb and confirm negative response to ensure proper anesthetization. Ensure a steady respiratory rate at approximately 55-65 breaths/min.\nUsing forceps, pinch and gently lift the scalp. Make a midline linear rostral-caudal incision with surgical scissors. Irrigate the incision site with PBS and remove subdermal fat with a cotton tip applicator in a circular brushing motion. Arrange the skin such that the previously-established cranial window is fully visible.\nGently puncture the dura just interior to the borders of the cranial window using an 18-G needle. Repeat until the incision fully traces the interior of the window.\nRemove the dura by peeling it away using fine forceps, revealing the underlying parenchyma and tumor.",
    "Locate the U87 mCh-Fl tumor by turning room lights off and turning the stereomicroscope fluorescence-mode on. Prepare for resection by loading a 1-200 µL pipette tip into the end of the tubing of a vacuum pump.\nTurn the vacuum pump on. Resect the tumor by gently aspirating fluorescent tissue until no signal remains. Turn the vacuum pump off and discard the pipette tip. Turn the fluorescence off and the room lights back on.\n\tNOTE: To control bleeding, irrigate with cold PBS and apply steady pressure with a cotton tip applicator. In more severe cases, the resection cavity can also be temporarily packed with a hemostatic agent as long as it is removed after the bleeding has stopped followed by another PBS irrigation.\nImmediately prior to implantation, slowly dip an MSC-seeded PLA scaffold in PBS to remove unwanted media and associated components. Implant the scaffold into the resection cavity. If needed, add 1 µL fibrinogen (67-106 mg/mL) followed by 1 µL thrombin (400-625 U/mL) to secure the scaffold in place.\nWith the dura removed and the bone flap from the cranial window already discarded, seal the wound simply by closing the skin and applying surgical glue. Remove the animal from inhaled anesthetic and allow to recover on a heated surface.\nOnce ambulatory, return mouse to cage. Administer analgesic on IACUC-approved schedule. Repeat procedure for each mouse.\n3. Post-Operative Imaging\nUsing the 28-G insulin syringe, inject mice with D-luciferin (150 mg/kg intraperitoneal).\nWait 10 min. This will allow the luciferin to circulate throughout the body and react with the luciferase-expressing cancer cells in the brain to obtain peak expression.\nUnder isoflurane anesthesia (as mentioned previously), image mice in a bioluminescence imaging (BLI) system to visualize the tumors. Vary exposure times as needed (seconds to minutes) depending on tumor size.",
    "Repeat imaging procedure as needed to determine tumor growth kinetics. Continue to monitor animal health.\n\tNOTE: The therapeutic MSCs will constitutively express TRAIL, killing cancer cells and suppressing overall tumor growth. Imaging every 2-5 days provides sufficient frequency for this purpose.\nWhen predetermined endpoints outlined in the IACUC protocol have been met, sacrifice mice by transcardial perfusion and collect tissues for analysis.\nSubscription Required.
