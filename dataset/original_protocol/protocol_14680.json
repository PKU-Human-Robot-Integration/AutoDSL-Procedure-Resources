    "All procedures described must be performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations for the use of vertebrate animals, including prior approval by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Generation of Lung Metastases for Ex vivo Live Imaging (Transgenic or Tail Vein Injection)\nNOTE: Lung metastases can be generated by utilizing genetically engineered mouse models or by intravenous (i.v) injection of cancer cells.\nGenerate lung metastases for imaging by crossing a genetically engineered tumor mouse model into a transgenic reporter mouse, e.g., cross the breast cancer mouse model, mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-polyoma middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT)11 into ACTB-ECFP mouse model12.\nNOTE: The ACTB-ECFP model expresses enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) under the β-actin promoter such that all cells fluoresce in the blue, CFP channel. However, cancer cells are by far the most prominent and appear as a bulk of ECFP-positive cells under the microscope. The MMTV-PyMT mouse model develops a progressive disease, in which mammary tumor growth is associated with the dissemination of cancer cells to the periphery, especially to the lungs. In MMTV-PyMT mice on the FVB/n background, micrometastases can be observed around 10-11 weeks of age. Generally, these progress to macrometastases at around 14 weeks of age13. \n\tOR\nGenerate experimental metastases using primary cells or syngeneic cell lines. Use in vitro manipulated primary tumor cells or cell lines (e.g., transduction) followed by i.v. injection14.\n\t\nBriefly, in this protocol, inject a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing (+) MMTV-PyMT cell line into fluorescent reporter mice (ACTB-ECFP) or wildtype mice. Then, visualize these cells referred to as VO-PyMT cells15 using the green, GFP channel.\nNOTE: The original VO-PyMT cell line was derived at the Vanderbilt Orthopaedics in Nashville, TN. VO stands for Vanderbilt Orthopaedics.",
    "Following the injection of 106 cells (in 200 µl), observe cancer cell extravasation immediately and up to a few hours after injection; observe micrometastases between 1-3 weeks after injection and detect macrometastases 3 weeks after injection15.\nNOTE: Fewer cells can be injected to prolong the time from injection to metastatic growth.\n2. Labeling of Components of Interest in the Metastatic Microenvironment (Transgenic and/or Injectables)\nNOTE: Labeling can be achieved by transgenic mice and/or by various injectables. Make sure to use different fluorescent colors for the labeling of various cell types.\nLabel components of the metastatic microenvironment using transgenic mice. Cross the previously mentioned mouse tumor model (e.g., MMTV-PyMT x ACTB-ECFP) into a transgenic mouse model in which the stromal cells of interest are labeled by a fluorescent protein which is not ECFP, e.g., c-fms-EGFP4,16.\nNOTE: In addition to visualization of cancer cells in the CFP channel, this enables visualization of myeloid cells in the GFP channel4.\n\tAND/OR\nLabel various components of the metastatic microenvironment using injectables into transgenic fluorescent reporter mice or (non-fluorescent) wildtype mice.\nNOTE: Several compounds can be injected to label various components of the metastatic microenvironment, e.g., an AF647-conjugated Gr-1 antibody is used here to label neutrophils and some monocytes13 and different molecular weight dextrans are used to label lung capillaries. For preparation of these injectables see step 4. \n3. Preparation of Materials Before Dissection\n2% Agarose\n\t\nWeigh 0.2 g of agarose and add to 10 ml 1 x PBS. Heat the solution to dissolve the agarose. Agarose will solidify at RT, so maintain it in a 37 °C water bath until used for inflation.\nCO2 and temperature controller",
    "Check ddH2O in the humidification chamber. Refill when needed. Insert configuration plate into temperature stage plate holder (climate chamber). Turn on the CO2 controller and set CO2 at 5%. Make sure the airflow rate is set at 0.4 Nl/min.\nOpen the air and CO2 valves. Turn on the temperature controller. Make sure the temperature of the climate chamber and the lid are set at 37 °C.\nRelease air pressure on CO2 meter. Check CO2 increasing, equilibration can take up to 30 min.\nSpinning disk confocal microscope\nNOTE: Details of the microscope set-up have been previously described4,17. \nTurn on the lasers (the argon laser for 488 nm excitation and the solid-state 405 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm lasers). Turn on the microscope, the camera, the spinning disk control unit, the AOTF, the laser control unit and the camera controller.\nOpen the microscope shutter, turn on the computer running the microscope and open the software.\nPreparation of the tools and dissection platform.\n\t\nTurn on the hot bead sterilizer and let it reach 250 °C. Clean 2 pairs of surgical scissors and forceps with water and soap. Sterilize the tools for at least 30 sec. Let the tools cool off. Use a polystyrene lid as dissection platform. Cover it with a piece of lab soaker.\n4. Preparation of Injections\nNOTE: Depending on the half-life and the preferred response, inject fluorescently labeled antibodies and/or fluorescent molecules either immediately prior to animal sacrifice or a couple of hours to days before.\nTo image Gr1-positive neutrophils and monocytes, prepare a syringe with 7 µl of stock AF647-conjugated Gr-1 antibody (1 mg/ml) into 100 µl of sterile PBS under the hood. Place a 27 G ½ needle on the syringe.",
    "To image lung capillaries, prepare a second and third syringe with 100 µl of either 70 kD rhodamine-conjugated dextran (4 mg/ml) or 10 kD AF647-conjugated dextran (4 mg/ml). Place a 27 G ½ needle on the syringes.\nInject the AF647-conjugated antibody solution i.v. 5 hr prior to lungs’ excision.\nInject one or both dextran solutions i.v. immediately prior to lungs’ excision.\n5. Preparation of Lungs for Ex vivo Live Imaging\nNOTE: Try to work as sterile and careful as possible to avoid unnecessary challenges of the immune cells within the lungs.\nInject the mouse intraperitoneal (i.p.) with a lethal overdose of an anesthetic permitted by the animal protocol approved by IACUC, e.g., 1 ml of 2.5% Avertin. Wait for the mouse to stop breathing and be completely non-responsive to noxious stimuli (hind paw pinch).\nNOTE: Cervical dislocation and carbon dioxide euthanasia should be avoided as it can detrimentally affect lung cell viability.\nImmobilize the mouse on a dissection board and sterilize the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nUse surgical scissors to first make a transverse epigastric incision through the skin, followed by a similar incision through the peritoneum. Hold the dissection board in a vertical position and cut the descending aorta, so that blood pools down in the abdomen and not in the chest cavity.\nSnip a small opening in the diaphragm to release vacuum. Cut along the 10th and 12th rib to excise the diaphragm and get visual access to the lungs.\nUse surgical scissors to cut the skin up to the trachea over the ribcage but leave the ribcage intact. Separate the skin from the ribcage. Expose the trachea by removing the surrounding connective tissue, being careful not to damage the trachea itself (Figure 1A).",
    "Snip a small opening approximately 1 mm in diameter in the exposed trachea parallel to the cartilaginous rings, as close to the larynx as possible (Figure 1B). Be careful not to cut completely through the trachea.\nTake a 20 G needle and gently insert the needle 4-5 mm into the trachea without any counter force (Figure 1D). The end of the needle should be visible through the trachea (Figure 1C). Use forceps to stabilize the needle in the trachea. Alternatively, a suture may be tied around the trachea to hold the needle in place.\nNOTE: By inserting too deep, the carina may be traumatized or only one side of the lungs might be inflated.\nFill a syringe with 400 µl of 37 °C 2% low-melting-temperature agarose (taken directly from a constant temperature bath). Make sure the dissection board is standing up and slowly instill the warm agarose through the needle into the lungs, use ~400 µl to inflate the lungs.\nNOTE: Watch the lungs inflating inside the ribcage. Do not over-inflate the lung as it will rupture.\nOnce the lungs are inflated, filling ~⅔ of the rib cage, detach the syringe and keep the needle inside the trachea to prevent any agarose from leaking.\nPour approximately 50 ml of 20 °C PBS over the inflated lungs to allow the agarose inside the lungs to set and solidify. Slowly remove the needle and close the trachea with forceps to prevent any non-solidified agarose from leaking.",
    "Expose the lungs by performing a sternotomy and subsequently excise the lungs. For excision of the lungs, hold on to the trachea while cutting through the trachea completely. Gently pull the trachea up, cut away the connective tissue and esophagus while pulling the lungs out of the chest cavity until the lungs is separated from the mouse (Figure 1E).\nImmerse the lungs in warm RPMI-1640 to wash off excessive blood and gently separate the lobes by using scissors and forceps to cut the lobes’ main stem bronchus at hilum (Figure 1F).\nPlace the lobes, with the flat surface down to maximize imaging surface, in a well of a 24-well imaging plate (Figure 1G). Add 100 µl of 37 °C RPMI-1640 on top of the lobes. Place several 15 mm circular microscope cover slides on top of the lobes to prevent it from floating.\nPour warm PBS into the surrounding wells to prevent the RPMI-1640 media from evaporating. Insert the 24-well plate into the equilibrated climate chamber and maintain the lung lobes at 37 °C with air and 5% CO2. Insert the climate chamber on the stage of the confocal microscope.\nNOTE: Other gas mixtures (e.g., 5% O2, 5% CO2 in N2 to examine cell behavior under conditions of hypoxia/lower oxygen) could also be considered. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53741/53741fig1.jpg",

Acquisition and Analysis of Images\nNOTE: Images can be acquired with a variety of spinning disk confocal microscopes supported by various software programs. In this protocol, either µManager with a custom-made spinning disk confocal microscope or Zen with a commercially-available spinning disk confocal microscope is used for image acquisition, while Imaris is used for movie editing and analysis.\nAcquire images using µManager. A detailed step by step protocol for the acquisition of images using µManager software is previously described18.\n\tOR\nAcquire images using image analysis software such as Zen (see Figure S1).\n\t\nClick on the ‘Locate’ tab, and choose objective (10x or 20x) in the ‘Light Path’ tool (Figure S1A, red box). Subsequently, click on ‘Eyes – DAPI’ to look at the CFP channel through the eyepiece (Figure S1A, blue box). Localize the sample manually using the microscope. Click ‘All Off’after the tissue is center of the field of view.\nClick on the ‘Acquisition’ tab to set all the parameters for image acquisition.\nIn the ‘Channels’ tool, click the ‘+’ button (Figure S1B, red box). A pop-up menu appears and search for the dye(s) present in the sample in the ‘Dye Database’ (Figure S1B). Select the dye and click ‘Add’.",
    "NOTE: The program will set all filters to be optimized. A dye can be deleted by selecting it followed by clicking the trash can button (Figure S1B, yellow box).\nIn the ‘Acquisition Mode’ menu, set ‘Binning’ to 5x5. Double click on ECFP in the channels menu to select it. Lower the laser power to 20% so the sample will not be bleached while setting up the parameters for image acquisition.\nCheck the ‘Tiles’ box in the ‘Experiment Manager’ section and the tiles tool appears in the ‘Multidimensional Acquisition’ tool group (Figure S1C). Click on ‘Advanced Setup’ button to view the live image from the camera. Click on the ‘Add’ button in the ‘Positions’ section to add 4 to 6 positions to the experiment. To delete a position, select that position and click on the trash can button.\nIn the ‘Acquisition Parameter’ tool group, open the ‘Focus Strategy’ tool, and select ‘Absolute Fixed Z-position’ from the dropdown list.\nCheck the Z-Stack box in the ‘Experiment Manager’ section and the Z-Stack tool appears in the ‘Multidimensional Acquisition’ tool group (Figure S1D). Double click on one of the positions in the ‘Positions’ section and press ‘Live’. Manually set first and set last position of the imaging field. Set the interval at 4 µm.\nNOTE: The program will determine the number of slices for the chosen range and interval. Ideally, 5-7 slices are convenient to allow sufficient visualization and rapid image acquisition.\nCheck the ‘Time Series’ box in the ‘Experiment Manager’ section. Set desired ‘Duration’ and ‘Interval’ times in the ‘Time Series’ tool that appeared in the ‘Multidimensional Acquisition’ tool group (Figure S1E).",
    "In the ‘Acquisition Mode’ menu, set ‘Binning’ to 2x2. Double click on a fluorophore in the channels menu to select it and increase the laser power to 100%. Press ‘Live’ and adjust the ‘Exposure Time’. Repeat this for every fluorophore.\nCheck the ‘Enable Auto Save’ box. Select a folder and type in the name of the file. All the acquired images will be automatically saved in this folder.\nClick on ‘Start Experiment’ in the ‘Experiment Manager’ section to start image acquisition.\nAfter image acquisition, compile the raw data in Imaris software. Convert images to .ims files and adjustments can be made. A detailed step by step protocol for conversion of files, making adjustments and saving movies using Imaris is previously described18.\nWhen saving the movie, set the ‘Frame Rate’ to 5 frames per second (fps).\nSubscription Required.
