    "Prior to the first test day, set up the behavioral testing room.Ensure that the red light illumination provides appropriate contrast for video recording.If testing more than one pair of animals at a time, arrange all testing arenas such that they can be adequately recorded by the available recording equipment. Using a smart phone camera, we are able to record 4 arenas simultaneously with sufficient detail and resolution. See Figure 2B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191225/20191225235101_1986.jpgFigure 2. Testing arena and set up. A. Image of a single behavior testing arena. B. Image of four testing arenas arranged in front of a tripod for video recording.Fill each testing arena with enough TEK-fresh bedding to cover the bottom of the arena (approximately 2-3 cm deep).Plan play pairs and the order of behavioral testing. The order of testing needs to be changed each day to counterbalance the time of testing for each group across all test days.On the day of testing, move the animals (in their home cage) from the colony room into the behavioral testing room to allow them to habituate to the experimental environment (approx. 20 min prior to testing and at least 1 h after the start of the dark cycle). Testing during the dark phase (the active phase for the rat) is essential for proper behavioral analysis.Mark one of the animals in each play pair either with a fur-marking pen (on the head or back) or by striping the tail with a permanent marker. This facilitates behavioral analysis as it is easier to attribute specific behaviors to the marked or unmarked animal.Once the animals have habituated, place an animal pair into the testing arena and allow the animals to acclimate to the arena for 2 min.After acclimation, record behavior for 10 min.Once the test has concluded, stop the recording.",
    "Remove the animals from the testing arena and place them back in their home cage.Repeat Steps 4-6 as many times as needed until all animals have been tested.On subsequent days, repeat Steps 2-7. We typically perform the test for 4 continuous days (P27-30) to capture the peak sex difference in play behavior; however, the test can be repeated each day throughout the entire juvenile period (approximately P26-35).Notes: During the test, the experimenter should remain behind a curtain or out of sight of the testing arenas. Additionally, maintain quiet in the room as external noises may disrupt behavior. It is not necessary to clean the testing arena or change the bedding between trials. At the conclusion of each test day, the arena should be cleaned (using a cleaner of the experimenterâ€™s choosing) and bedding replaced in preparation for the next day. Be sure to keep the red light intensity to a minimum to avoid creating an artificially stressful testing environment. The lighting for our behavior testing is typically < 50 lux. Additionally, red light should be used for Sprague Dawley rats as they are albino and their inability to see red light keeps the testing environment as close to a natural dark phase as possible for optimal behavior testing. While rats do emit ultrasonic vocalizations during play, this does not impact the expression of play (Kisko et al., 2015), and does not confound testing more than 1 pair of animals at a time."
