    "Preparation of a working cell stockYeast cells are grown in a culture tube containing 5 ml of minimal medium supplemented with proline as the nitrogen (N) source (MP) and compounds to satisfy the auxotrophic requirements (MP+ broth, see Recipes below) at 30 °C overnight in a rotator until a turbid culture is obtained. The minimal medium described in this protocol is designed for the W303 strain. Proline is added as a poor N source in order to induce the synthesis of the peptide uptake system of S. cerevisiae. Other minimal media can be used for strains of S. cerevisiae with different auxotrophic requirements.1 ml of the above overnight culture is seeded into a 250 ml flask containing 50 ml of fresh MP+ broth and grown to log phase, corresponding to a density of approximately 5 x 106 cells/ml, taking about 4 h.Log phase cells are harvested by centrifugation (1,000 x g) and washed three times with a solution of 2% glucose to remove culture medium residue and maintain the cells in an energized state.Adjustment of the cell numberThe cell pellet is resuspended in 0.5 ml 2% glucose and the suspended cells are counted on a hemocytometer. Based on the hemocytometer results, a cell suspension is prepared at a final concentration of 1 x 108 cells/ml in 2% glucose. Setting-up the cell uptake The 2x uptake medium is warmed to 30 °C. 60 μl of cell suspension is dispensed into each of ten, 1.5 ml microfuge tubes. The tubes are transferred into a 30 °C dry bath block and incubated for 5 min. To begin the assay, 60 μl of pre-warmed, 2x uptake medium are added to the pre-warmed 60 μl yeast cell suspensions and the suspension carefully mixed by pipetting. The tubes are incubated for various time intervals.",
    "Generally, times should range from a minimum of 10 sec to a maximum of 10 min. For each uptake time, triplicate determinations are made. To control for non-specific association of the radiolabeled peptide with the cells, a negative control in which no peptide should be transported must be completed. This can be done by repeating the entire uptake procedure at 0 °C, when cells are not metabolically active. Alternatively, completing the uptake assay at 30 °C using an isogenic strain known to be lacking the transporter of interest can also serve as a negative control.Stopping the uptakeUpon completion of the uptake interval, cells are harvested and washed by filtration on any manifold system such as the Manifold Vacuum Filtration Cell Harvester (see Equipment list). A membrane filter pre-wet in water (one filter is needed for each of the ten samples) is placed onto the filtration apparatus, the apparatus is assembled and the vacuum is turned on. To stop the uptake, 100 μl of the uptake/cell suspension mixtures are pipetted onto the center of the filter. Each filter is then washed 4 times with 1 ml of ice-cold water. Notes: The HAWP membrane filters needed to complete the assay are placed into a Petri dish with water to pre-wet. Filters are removed as needed and placed onto the filtration apparatus just prior to stopping the uptake assay.It is important to avoid loading the cell suspension near the rim of the filter as this could result in loss of cells if the filtration apparatus does not seal tightly around the filter.Radioactivity measurement Turn off the vacuum to the filtration device and disassemble to access the filters. Remove the filters with the retained yeast cells using filter forceps and place each into a separate liquid scintillation vial.",
    "One milliliter of scintillation fluid is added to each vial, which is capped and then shaken by hand to ensure that the filter is completely submerged in the cocktail. The vials are allowed to sit at room temperature for a minimum of one hour to allow for equilibration with the scintillation fluid and radioactivity is measured using a Liquid Scintillation Counter, per manufacturer’s instructions."
