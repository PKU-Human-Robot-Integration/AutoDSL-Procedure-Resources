    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. IACUC2018-0040) at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.\n1. Equipment and reagent setup for the preparation of testicular cell suspension\nPrepare each enzyme stock in 1x Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and store at -20 °C. (Table1).\n\tNOTE: Prepare any time before the experiment.\nOne day before the experiment: Coat collecting tubes (1.5 mL tubes) with Fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 4 °C overnight.\nOn the day of the experiment: Set the water bath to 37 °C.\nPre-warm Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) at 37 °C and prepare 2 mL of 1x dissociation buffer for each sample right before use (Table 1) in 15 mL centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: 2 mL dissociation buffer is prepared for two testes. For the dissociation buffer recipe, please refer to Table 1.\n2. Animal dissection and preparation of testicular cell suspension\nSacrifice an 8-week-old male mouse by leaving in a carbon dioxide chamber for at least 10 min.\nRemove both testes and place on a 60 mm Petri dish containing 2 mL of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nRemove the tunica albuginea from the testes. Slightly disperse the seminiferous tubules by gently separating with forceps.\nTransfer the seminiferous tubules to a 100 mm Petri dish with a new drop of ice-cold PBS and untangle seminiferous tubules gently with forceps. Repeat this wash 3 times to remove interstitial cells as much as possible.\nIncubate untangled seminiferous tubules in a 15 mL tube containing 2 mL of dissociation buffer at 37 °C for 20 min.\nGently pipette the tubules 20 times using a 1000 µL micropipette.\nIncubate for 6 min. Repeat gentle pipetting 20 times.\nIncubate for 3 min. Repeat gentle pipetting 10 times until no visible chunks remain.",
    "Add 10 mL of FACS buffer to the suspension. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 2.9 twice to remove the spermatozoa and as much debris as possible.\n3. Cell staining\nResuspend the cell pellet with 3 mL of FACS buffer (Table 1) and filter the cell suspension through a 70 µm nylon cell strainer into a 50 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: The expected cell yield is approximately 100 million cells per two testicles (from an 8-week-old B6 wild-type mouse).\nCount the cell number and split 10% of the cells into a new tube as the unstained negative control and leave on ice.\nAdd 6 µL of DCV stain (the original concentration is 5 mM) to the remaining cell suspension and mix well. The final concentration is 10 µM, and the capacity is approximately 100 million cells.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Gently shake the cell suspension every 10 min.\nAfter incubation, without a wash step, directly add 5 µL of DNase I (the stock concentration is 10 mg/mL) to the cell suspension and filter the cells into a 5 mL FACS tube through the 35 µm nylon mesh cap. Keep the samples on ice until sorting.\n4. Flow cytometry and experimental gates\nPrepare the FACS cell sorter. Ensure that FACS cell sorter is equipped with Excitation optics: Violet (405-nm) laser; Detection optics: ﬁlter combination of 450/50 bandpass [same filter set of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for DCV-blue detection] and 665/30 bandpass [same filter set of Allophycocyanin (APC) for DCV-red detection]. Here we use Sony SH800S cell sorter as an example.",
    "Create a new experiment and set up the following working plots displaying parameters to be optimized: Click “New Density” on the “Worksheet Tools” menu bar to create a forward scatter - area (FSC-A) vs. back scatter – area (BSC-A) density plot on a linear scale. Click “New Histogram” to create a DCV-blue histogram plot on logarithmic scale.\nBriefly vortex the unstained negative control (from step 3.2) and load the sample.\nClick “Start” and “Record” to begin processing the unstained sample. While the sample is running, click “Detector & Threshold Settings” to optimize FSC and BSC voltages by adjusting both the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages up or down to place the unstained cells on the scale of the FSC/BSC plot.\nAdjust the PMT voltage up and down on “FL1: DAPI” while the sample is running to locate the position of the DCV-negative population in the ﬁrst decade of the DCV-blue histogram logarithmic plot (Figure 2A). After completing the PMT voltage adjustment, click “Stop” to unload the unstained sample.\nBriefly vortex the sample (from step 3.5) and load the sample.\nClick “Next Tube” to create a new worksheet for the DCV-stained sample; and click “Start” and “Record” to acquire the DCV-stained sample, record ≥ 1 x 106 events. Add the following working plots: Click “New Density” on the “Worksheet Tools” menu bar to create an FSC-H (height) vs. FSC-W (width) density plot on a linear scale; Click “New Density” to create a DCV-blue vs. DCV-red density plot on a linear scale. After recording ≥ 1 x 106 events, click “Stop” and unload the sample.",
    "On the FSC-A vs. BSC-A density plot, click “Polygon” on the “Plot Tools” menu bar to draw a big gate “Cells” to include most cells and exclude small debris (Figure 2B). Apply the gate “Cells” to FSC-H vs. FSC-W density plot. Click “Rectangle” to draw a “Single Cells” gate to exclude non-single cells (Figure 2C).\nApply “Single Cells” gate to DCV-blue vs. DCV-red density plot and adjust the scale to capture an extended profile as shown in Figure 2D. Click “Polygon” on the “Plot Tools” menu bar to draw a “DCV” gate to exclude the unstained cells and side population (Figure 2D).\nApply “DCV” gate to DCV-blue histogram plot on a linear scale. The three major peaks refer to different DNA content: 1C, 2C, and 4C (Figure 2E).\nClick “New Density” to create a DCV-blue vs. DCV-red density plot on a linear scale and apply “DCV” gate to perform back gating from Figure 2E to locate the 1C and 4C populations (Figure 2F). Click “Ellipse” to draw a gate on the 1C population, which is within a condensed area (gate 1C). Click “Polygon” to draw a gate on the 4C population which is a continuous curve (gate 4C).\nClick “New Density” to create a DCV-blue vs. DCV-red density plot on a linear scale and apply “4C” gate; adjust the scale to zoom in and click “Polygon” to draw a “4C_1” gate for more precise selection (Figure 2G).\nClick “New Density” to create a new FSC-A vs. BSC-A density plot on a linear scale and apply “4C_1” gate; there will be three enriched populations separated by size corresponding to leptotene (L) /zygotene (Z), pachytene (P) and diplotene (D) spermatocytes. Click “Polygon” or “Ellipse” to draw 3 gates: “L/Z”, “P”, and “D” based on the growing size (Figure 2H).",
    "Click “New Dot Plot” to create a DCV-blue vs. DCV-red color dot plot on a linear scale to apply gate and ensure the three populations are in a continuous order within the “4C_1” gate (Figure 2I).\nSimilarly, for the 1C population, click “New Density” to create a new FSC-A vs. BSC-A density plot on a linear scale and apply “1C” gate, select the unified size of cells as pure round spermatid population, and click “Ellipse” to draw an “RS” gate (Figure 2J).\n5. Sort male germ cell subpopulations\nPrepare 1.5 mL tubes containing 500 μL 50% FBS for cell collection and load the collection tube into the collector and click “Load Collection”.\nClick “Next Tube”, “Start”, “Record” and “Sort Start”. For using a two-way system that allows two populations of interest to be sorted at the same time into the collection device, follow pairwise combinations: leptotene (L) /zygotene (Z) and pachytene (P) spermatocytes based on L/Z and P back-gates; Round spermatids (RS) and diplotene (D) spermatocytes based on RS and D back-gates.\nWhile the sample is running, adjust the flow rate to ~3000 events/s to get the most efficient sorting.\n6. Purity analysis of sorted cells\nCollect ≥ 10,000 cells/each population. Perform cell immunostaining to confirm the substage.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and carefully discard the supernatant, keeping around 110 µL of the liquid in the bottom of the tube.\nTake a 10 µL drop of cell suspension to observe under microscope and evaluate the overview cell morphology and number.\nApply 100 µL of cell suspension to each of the sample chamber slides (see Table of Materials), and load the chambers to the Cytospin.",
    "Spin the samples at 30 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Draw a circle around the cell with a hydrophobic pen. Dry slides on lab bench for a few minutes at room temperature.\nDrop 50 µL of PBS in the circle of the slide and tap off.\nAdd primary antibody solution (Dilute primary antibodies with 5% Donkey Serum in PBS with 0.02% Polysorbate 20) in the circle of the slide and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: To judge the substage of meiotic spermatocytes, SYCP3 was detected, which is a marker of meiotic chromosome axes, and γH2AX, which is a marker of DNA damage response. (For the antibody working concentration, please refer to the Table of Materials).\nTap off the primary antibody solution from the slides.\nDrop 50 µL of PBS in the circle of the slide and tap off. Repeat one time.\nAdd secondary antibody solution (dilute secondary antibodies in PBS with 0.02% Polysorbate 20) in the circle of the slide and incubate at room temperature for 1 h in dark.\nDrop 50 µL of PBS in the circle of the slide and tap off. Repeat one time.\nAdd 50 µL of DAPI (stock concentration is 0.1 μg/mL) stain for 5 min and tap off.\nAdd 1-2 drops of mounting media on the slides. Carefully cover the mounting media with a cover glass and gently press the cover glass to remove extra mounting media and air bubble. The slides are ready for microscopy evaluation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
