    "NOTE: All experiments are performed following protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at SingHealth.\n1. Harvesting Early Postnatal Mouse Brains\nBefore dissection, prepare the hippocampal tissue digestion solution: 10 µl papain per 1 ml 1x Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) (+ 1% HEPES) with Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) (250 U/ml) and Dispase II (1 U/ml). Make approximately 2.5 ml of the tissue digestion solution and filter it using a 0.20 µm filter unit. Keep the solution warm at 37 °C until use.\nAnesthetize the postnatal day 5 (P5) mice pups by putting them in ice for 5 min. Remove from ice and test for pain reflex via toe or tail pinch. Spray the pups with 70% ethanol. Decapitate the pups and place the heads in a petri dish over ice.\nMake an incision in the skin along the midline, from the base of the skull to the nose, with a pair of small scissors or fine dissecting forceps. Peel open the skin and make a similar incision through the skull. Make two additional horizontal cuts on each side of the skull, one rostral (at the bregma) and one caudal (at the lambda).\nPeel open the skull along the incised lines to expose the underlying brain. Use a pair of forceps to remove the skull overlying the olfactory bulbs, and any midline bone between them. Do this while holding the head stable with a pair of forceps in the non-dissecting hand.",
    "Ease the flat part of a spatula between the ventral part of the brain and the base of the skull at the caudal end. Keeping the spatula parallel to the base of the skull under the brain, move it towards the rostral end of the skull to sever any adhesions between the brain and the base of the skull.\n\t\nScoop the brain out with the spatula and place it in a Petri dish containing ice-cold 1x EBSS (+ 1% HEPES). Keep tissues submerged at all times.\nFor all micro-dissection steps, work under a dissecting microscope and use a pair of fine dissecting forceps in each hand, one for cutting tissue, and the other for holding the tissue stable.\nMake a cut just posterior to the cerebral cortex to separate it from the hindbrain. Cut along the midline to separate the cerebral cortex into its two hemispheres. Remove the meninges from the cerebral hemispheres.\nPlace a hemisphere medial side up and insert the forceps into the lateral ventricle underneath the hippocampus. Cut away the midbrain.\n\t\nMake cuts at the superior and inferior ends of the hippocampus, and near the dentate/entorhinal cortex junction to isolate the hippocampus from the cortex. Collect the hippocampi in a dish containing ice-cold 1x EBSS (+ 1% HEPES).\n2. Hippocampal Tissue Dissociation\nTransfer the hippocampi to a dish containing the pre-warmed hippocampal tissue digestion solution.

Gently pipette up and down 5-10 times to ensure cell pellet is broken up into single cells.\nTransfer medium containing cells into pre-coated Matrigel plates and add epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) (both 20 ng/ml) in heparin (5 mg/ml). Incubate plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n3. Maintenance of Adherent Mouse Hippocampal NPCs\nPrepare the coated plates/flasks at least an hour prior to passaging mouse hippocampal NPCs. Add enough Matrigel to cover the surface area of each plate or flask and incubate at room temperature for 1 hr.\nRemove media from 90% confluent mouse NPC cultures and wash once with 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) then aspirate PBS off.\nAdd enough cell detachment solution to cover all wells/flasks and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nEnsure that all cells have detached by looking under an inverted bright field microscope at 10X magnification. If there are still cells attached, incubate culture vessel for a further 1-2 min and check cells again. Add twice the amount of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Ham’s F-12 Nutrient Mixture (DMEM/F-12) as that of cell detachment solution to the wells/flasks once all cells have detached.\nTransfer DMEM/F-12 containing cells into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 5 ml of mouse NPC maintenance medium (Table 1). Gently pipette up and down to break up cell pellet into single cells.",
    "Plate a third of total cells into new culture wells/flasks and top up sufficient culture medium supplemented with EGF and FGF2. Incubate culture vessels at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Replenish medium every second day and split cells 1:3 every 3 to 4 days. Avoid overgrowth of mouse NPC cultures to prevent aggregation and detachment.\n4. Differentiation of Mouse NPCs into Astrocytes\nPrepare poly-L-Lysine (PLL)/laminin coated 12 mm cover glasses at least a day in advance before initiating differentiation of mouse NPCs into astrocytes. Add coverslips into a 24-well plate and cover entire surface area of wells with enough PLL (1 mg/ml in borate buffer).\n\t\nIncubate the plate overnight at 4 °C. The following day, remove PLL and wash once with 1x PBS.\nAdd laminin (1 mg/ml in ice cold DMEM/F-12), again covering the entire surface area of each well, then incubate for at least 4 hr at 37 °C.\nRemove media from mouse NPC cultures and wash once with 1x PBS then aspirate PBS off.\nAdd enough cell detachment solution to cover all wells/flasks and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nEnsure that all cells have detached then add twice the amount of DMEM/F-12 as that of cell detachment solution to the wells/flasks.\nTransfer DMEM/F-12 containing cells into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 ml astrocyte differentiation medium (Table 1).

    "Plate cells at 5 x 104 cells/cm2 in 500 µl of medium for each well of a 24-well plate. Incubate plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Replace half of the medium with fresh medium every second day. Mouse NPCs rapidly differentiate into astrocytes within 2 days and are differentiated for a week before commencing further experiments.\n5. Harvesting Embryonic Rat Brains and Cortical Tissue Dissociation\nRemove astrocyte differentiation medium (Table 1) from astrocyte cultures and replace with primary neuron medium (Table 1) at least 4 hr prior to commencing harvest of embryonic rat brains.\nBefore dissection, prepare the cortical tissue digestion solution: 10 µl papain per 1 ml 1x EBSS (+ 1% HEPES) with 12.1 mg/ml L-cysteine. Make approximately 2.5 ml of the tissue digestion solution and filter it using a 0.20 µm filter unit. Keep the solution warm at 37 °C until use.\nEuthanize the pregnant dam by carbon dioxide asphyxiation using compressed gas. Test for pain reflex via toe or tail pinch.\nLay the animal ventral side up on an absorbent pad and soak its abdominal area with 70% ethanol. Pinch the skin with a pair of forceps and make a lateral incision with a pair of surgical scissors, wide enough to expose the abdomen. Grasp the peritoneum with the forceps and cut open the abdominal cavity.\nLift up the uterine horn with the forceps and cut it free along the mesometrium. Place the dissected uterus in a Petri dish over ice. Separate each embryo by cutting the uterine tissue between them.\n\t\nMake an incision in the embryonic sac. Gently shell the fetus out through the opening. Decapitate the fetus and place the head in a Petri dish over ice.\nTo harvest embryonic rat brains, follow the description from steps 1.3 to 1.5.",

Mince the cortical tissues to as fine as possible and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nTransfer the cortical tissues from the tissue digestion solution to a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing 10 ml pre-warmed primary neuron medium (Table 1). Dissociate the cortical tissues by repeatedly pipetting them up and down in a serological pipette, until a homogenous solution with no tissue pieces is obtained.\nPass the tissue solution through a 70 µm cell strainer to filter out remaining tissue clumps. Aliquot the tissue solution into 15 ml centrifuge tubes, adding approximately 3 ml in each tube.\nAdd 800 µl 7.5% BSA in 1x PBS to the bottom of each tube, forming two layers with the tissue solution on top and BSA at the bottom.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant, aspirating from the interface of the two layers. Avoid disturbing the cell pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 1 ml primary neuron medium (Table 1) and combine them in a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Determine the cell density using a hemocytometer.\n6. Electroporation and Plating of Primary Cortical Neurons\nNOTE: Gene transfer can be achieved using several methods, including electroporation, calcium phosphate transfection and viral transduction. In this protocol, we describe electroporation to deliver ChR2 construct into primary cortical neurons.",
    "Centrifuge 6 x 106 rat cortical neurons at 200 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.
