    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Investigating histone inheritance pattern in live cells\nTiming: ∼ 3 months (for step 1)\nDual-color fluorophore switchable genetic tool to study histone inheritance:\nDual color tagged histone transgenic flies, UASp-FRT-Histone-EGFP-PolyA-FRT-Histone-mCherry, and hs-FLP; nanos-Gal4 flies were made. Dual color-tagged histone transgenic flies were used to distinguish between old and new histone. The nanos-Gal4 driver was used to drive expression of histone in the early germline cells. The hs-FLP was used to flip the histone tag.\nUse a dual color fluorescence tagged transgenic histone flies, for example, UASp-FRT-Histone-EGFP-PolyA-FRT-Histone-mCherry (Tran et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Wooten et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Ranjan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nUse a heat shock-induced genetic switch system, for example, the hs-FLP transgene allows flippase expression upon heat shock (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nUse a tissue and cell type-specific driver (cell/tissue of interest), for example, nanos-Gal4 for expressing transgenes in GSCs and early-stage germ cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCritical: Histone-EGFP followed by PolyA ensure Histone-EGFP expression in the absence of flippase. Histone-EGFP-PolyA flanked by two FRT sequences followed by Histone-mCherry-PolyA ensure cleavage of Histone-EGFP-PolyA and expression of Histone-mCherry in the presence of flippase. This facilitates a temporal control of tag switching upon heat shock (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Since this tag switching happens at the genetic level, it is an irreversible process.\nFly crosses\nTiming: ∼ 4–5 weeks (for step 4)\nDual color tagged histone transgenic flies were crossed with the hs-FLP; nanos-Gal4 flies to get progeny expressing both the UASp-FRT-H3-EGFP-PolyA-FRT-H3-mCherry and the hs-FLP; nanos-Gal4. The F1 progeny were used to heat shock to flip the histone tag (EGFP to mCherry) to distinguish old vs. new histones. Live cell imaging was performed to capture mitotic GSCs and SGs to determine old and new histones inheritance patterns in telophase.",
    "Cross the UASp-FRT-Histone-EGFP-PolyA-FRT-Histone-mCherry male flies with the hs-FLP; nanos-Gal4 female flies (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: It is important to use dual-color histone switchable system which can switch the expression of different tagged histones. Start separate crosses for different histone transgenes, e.g., H3, H4, and H2A.\nMaintain fly crosses at 18°C incubator throughout development (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Once the cross starts, do not take the flies outside the 18°C incubator, which could result in pre-flipping of the FRT-flanking histone tag.\nCollect 1–3-day old adult F1 male progenies in a new vial (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nSubmerge the vial underneath water up to the plug in a circulating 37°C water bath for 90 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Make sure to put the vial properly in the water bath; the water level should be reaching at least the cotton plug to ensure a uniform temperature inside the vial. A water bath gives a more stable temperature and highly reproducible results compared to the air incubator.\nTransfer heat-shocked flies into a new vial and recover them in a 29°C incubator for 22–25 h before dissection for imaging experiments (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nIf performing live-cell imaging, dissect flies in a live imaging medium, clean and wash the testes with live imaging medium. Mount testes in the glass bottom dish, add 100–150μL of live imaging medium and cover the lid. Place the sample under the spinning disk confocal microscope [for details please check our previous method paper (Ranjan and Chen, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12])].\nImaging: For live-cell imaging, use a high-resolution Spinning Disk Confocal microscope or high spatial resolution microscope [for detail check (Ranjan and Chen, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12])].\nAcquire high spatial and temporal resolution images (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2120-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Tracking old and new histone dynamics and their inheritance in live tissue during ACD",
    "(A and B) A dual color histone tag, UASp-FRT-H3-EGFP-PolyA-FRT-H3-mCherry, was used to investigate histone dynamics in mitosis. (A) Representative image showing overlapping old and new histone H3 during SG’s mitosis. The line plot shows overlapping peaks for old and new histone regions in the genome in SG. (B) Representative image showing non-overlapping old and new histone H3 during GSC’s mitosis. The line plot shows mutually exclusive peaks in the genome in GSC.\n(C and D) A tag swapped version of dual color histone, UASp-FRT-H3-mCherry -PolyA-FRT-H3-EGFP, was used to investigate histone inheritance in telophase. (C) Representative image showing asymmetric old histone H3 (mCherry tag, red) segregation in telophase in GSC. (D) Representative image showing symmetric old histone H3 (mCherry tag, red) segregation in telophase in SG. Scale bar = 5 μm; Asterisks = niche (hub region).\nAnalyze histone incorporation pattern in mitosis using line plot.\nNote: Non-overlapping old and new histones would indicate biased incorporation of histone on sister-chromatids during S phase (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nNext, perform quantification (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) of old and new histones in anaphase or telophase GSCs (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).",
    "Critical: The recovery time depends upon cell cycle length for the cell types of your interest. It is critical to ensure that a complete S phase occurs during the recovery, when new histones are synthesized and incorporated, before visualizing old and new histone patterns in the subsequent mitosis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Since Drosophila male GSCs has a prolonged G2 phase (9–12 h out of the 12–16-h cell cycle) (Lenhart and DiNardo, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) (Gadre et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), most GSCs are heat shocked during G2 phase. Therefore, 22–25 h are considered sufficient for the GSCs to go through a complete cell cycle (M-G1-S phases), before entering the subsequent M phase. Therefore, we standardize this as the right time point to investigate histone inheritance patterns in male GSCs, as described in the schematic diagram (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nVoxel quantification assay for histone inheritance\nTiming: ∼ one week (for step 14)\nTo understand the old and new histone inheritance pattern during asymmetric stem cell division, perform 3D quantification of old and new histone inheritance in telophase.\nSave raw images (as 2D Z-stacks) from live-cell imaging.\nOpen them on FIJI (ImageJ) software and draw the largest freehand circle that fits within the GSC or the SG to define histone-occupied chromatin region to include all fluorescent histone signals associated with the chromatin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nProcess the image to get the gray value of each pixel by using \"display_pixel_values\" plugins using FIJI (ImageJ) software.\nDetermine the sum of the gray values of all pixels in each Z-stack (‘‘RawIntDen’’).\nDetermine the sum of the gray values of background pixels in each Z-stack (‘‘RawIntDen’’).",
    "Note: Use the same freehand circle to determine the foreground fluorescence signal and the background signal to ensure the same area was used (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). For background signal, use the hub region (niche) or any negative region in the tissue where fluorescence tagged protein is not expressed.\nCalculate the actual gray values of the histone fluorescent signal pixels for each Z stack (Foreground Signal, Fs) by subtracting the gray values of the background signal pixels (Background Signal, Bs) from the gray values of the raw signal pixels (Raw Signal, Rs).\n  Fs  =  Rs  -  Bs.  \nNext, calculate the total amount of the histone fluorescent signals in the cell (Voxel) by adding the gray values of the fluorescence signal from all Z-stacks (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nThe total amount of the fluorescence signal (Fs) in the nuclei with ‘n’ Z-stacks (Z1+…+Zn). Fs (Z1+…+Zn) = [(Rs-Bs)1+…+(Rs-Bs) n].\nUse 15–25 pairs to determine the actual amount of histone in voxel in GSC-GB pairs and SG1-SG2 pairs in telophase.\nNote: The total amount of gray value would represent the total amount of histone protein in the cell (Voxel=quantification in the volume of the cell).\nAnalysis of histone inheritance\nCalculate the old histone ratio, GSC to GB, and new histone ratio, GSC to GB. For control, calculate the old histone ratio, SG1 to SG2, and the new histone ratio, SG1 to SG2.\nPlot the dot plot for all the datasets, determine the mean value and standard error of the mean (SEM), and calculate the statistical significance.\nDetermination of asymmetry: We define asymmetric inheritance of histone if mean value in GSCs is > mean + 1∗STD in control SGs. We define symmetric inheritance of histone if mean value in GSCs is < mean + 1∗STD in control SGs (Wooten et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Ranjan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).",
    "Note: Individual GSC-GB pairs and SG pairs can be assigned as symmetric or asymmetric using these criteria to determine the overall percentage of symmetric or asymmetric pairs to present in a histogram.\nCritical: To determine the histone inheritance pattern, old histone would be more reliable because no old histone synthesis and incorporation happens once the encoding sequences have been flipped out. To know the accurate difference in histone inheritance pattern, it is crucial to quantify the total amount of histone (without the tag switch) in a voxel (as described below in section 3).\nPart 2: Investigating sister chromatids condensation in mitosis (in live-cell and fixed cell)\nImaging old and new histone-enriched sister-chromatids\nTiming: ∼ 3–5 weeks (for step 25)\nDual color tagged histone transgenic flies were crossed with the hs-FLP; nanos-Gal4 flies to get progeny expressing both the UASp-FRT-H3-EGFP-PolyA-FRT-H3-mCherry and the hs-FLP; nanos-Gal4. The F1 progeny were used to heat shock to flip the histone tag (EGFP to mCherry) to distinguish old vs. new histones. Live cell imaging was performed to capture mitotic GSCs and SGs to distinguish chromatids enriched with old and new histones.\nUse dual-color tagged histone H3 transgene line [as described above (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A)] to study sister chromatids condensation dynamics during mitosis.\nCross the UASp-FRT-H3-EGFP-PolyA-FRT-H3-mCherry male flies with hs-FLP; nanos-GAL4 female flies, and maintain the cross at 18°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCollect 1–3 day-old adult male flies (F1 progeny) and heat shock them in a 37°C water bath for 90 min. Recover them for 22–25 h at 29°C before dissecting them for experiments (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nImage GSCs and SGs for old histone H3-enriched chromatids and new histones H3-enriched chromatids using live-cell imaging (Ranjan and Chen, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) or fixed cell imaging (Wooten et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Ranjan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).",
    "Collect all mitotic (late prophase to prometaphase) cells and perform the condensation assays (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B–3E).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2120-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Quantification of sister-chromatids condensation in germline stem cells\n(A) Diagrammatic representation of quantification of sister-chromatids condensation in mitosis.

The panel also shows individual channels before and after the threshold. Scale bar = 5 μm.\nOld and new histone-enriched chromatin condensation assay\nTiming: ∼ 1–2 weeks (for step 30)\nCondensation assay was performed to evaluate the condensation dynamics of old and new histone-enriched chromatin during mitosis.\nGenerate a maximum intensity projection for each GSCs and SGs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nDraw a largest freehand circle that fits within the GSC or the SG to define histone-occupied chromatin area in the nucleus for analysis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: (i) For live cell imaging, use histone signal to define chromatin region. (ii) For fix cells, use histone signal or Hoechst (DNA dye) to define chromatin region.\nDetermine the gray value of each pixel of the image by using \"display_pixel_values\" plugins using FIJI (ImageJ) software.",
    "Individually scale the images of each GSC or SG nucleus, setting the minimum intensity to 0 and the maximum to 65,535 (for 16-bit range) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nUse the below formula to scale the image on excel sheet:\nX′ = X-Min/(Max – Min)∗65535.\nWhere, X′ = scaled value, X = raw value, Min = minimum raw value in the region of interest (ROI), Max = maximum raw value in the ROI, ∗ = multiplication, 65535 = maximum gray value of a 16-bit camera.\nQuantify the fluorescence intensity distribution by monitoring the flux of pixels at a threshold of 35% of the maximum intensity of the image (scaled intensity: 22,937) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B–3E).\nNote: Before condensation, the signal is relatively homogeneous. As the chromosomes condense in mitosis, the histone fluorescence concentrates to a smaller area within the nucleus. Thus, the smaller area occupied by the chromatin could indicate compacted chromosomes.\nDetermine the condensation parameter for old histone H3-enriched regions and new histone H3-enriched regions by calculating the number of pixels above 35% threshold intensity (the condensation parameter).\nNote: The number of pixels represents the area occupied by the pixels above 35% threshold intensity in the nucleus (region of interest), and hence represents the area occupied by the chromatin.\nMeasure the relative condensation of old histone H3-enriched regions by calculating the ratio of condensation parameters of new histone H3-enriched regions to old histone H3-enriched regions in prometaphase for GSCs and SGs (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3E).\nCompaction factor = number of pixels of new histone H3-enriched chromatin / number of pixels of old histone H3-enriched chromatin.\nCritical: Individual scaling of the image ensures that the fluorescence intensity distribution is independent of fluctuations due to photobleaching, changes in illumination intensity, or variations among samples.\nAnalysis of old and new histone-enriched chromatin condensation",
    "Use 15–25 GSCs and SGs, and determine the relative condensation of old histone H3-enriched regions compared to the new histone H3-enriched regions.\nGenerate a dot plot for all datasets and determine the mean value and standard error of the mean (SEM), and calculate statistical significance.\nDefining condensation statuses between sister chromatids: Differential sister chromatids condensation: if mean value of compaction factor in GSCs is > mean + 1∗STD in control SGs. Equal sister chromatids condensation: if mean value of compaction factor in GSCs is < mean + 1∗STD in control SGs (Ranjan et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nNote: Individual GSCs or SGs can be assigned differential or equal condensation to determine the percentage of asymmetric or symmetric cells (Ranjan et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nCritical: Averaging 15–25 GSCs or SGs for quantification of compaction factors is essential to normalize signal intensity variations that could arise from differences among cell and tissue types and the microscope settings. Importantly, averaging minimizes the contribution of spatial fluctuations and emphasizes the global changes in sister chromatid structure.\nPart 3: Quantification of nucleosome density on sister chromatids\nLive imaging of histones for quantification of nucleosome density\nTiming: ∼ 15–20 days (for step 40)\nDual color tagged histone transgenic flies were crossed with the nanos-Gal4, tubulin-GFP flies to get progeny expressing single color histone (H3-mCherry) and α-tubulin-GFP. The F1 progeny do not need to heat shock as we need to quantify the total amount of histone. Live cell imaging was performed to capture mitotic GSCs and SGs.\nCross mCherry tagged histones (H3, H4 or H2A) fly line: UASp-Histone-mCherry with nanos-GAL4, α-tubulin-GFP fly line and grow them at 25°C.\nNote: α-tubulin-GFP was used to track mitotic cells in live imaging. One can use dual color tagged histone, UASp-FRT-H3-mCherry-PolyA-FRT-H3-EGFP, flies without flipping histone tag using heat shock treatment.",
    "Collect 1–3 day old adult male flies for live cell imaging.\nAcquire high spatial and temporal resolution time-lapse movies of GSCs and SGs and use telophase cells for quantifications (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C) (Ranjan et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2120-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Analysis of nucleosome density on sister-chromatids in germline stem cells\n(A) Diagrammatic representation of quantification of nucleosome density of sister-chromatids in telophase. Steps showing how to process images for 3D nucleosome density quantification. Also shows a formula to calculate the relative nucleosome density of the sister chromatids.\n(B) Representative image of GSC-GB pair showing asymmetric nucleosome density on sister-chromatids in telophase.\n(C) Representative image of SG1-SG2 pair showing symmetric nucleosome density on sister-chromatids in telophase. Scale bar = 5 μm; Asterisks = Niche (hub).\nNote: High spatial and temporal resolution images would give the most accurate nucleosome density profile.\nQuantification of total histone fluorescence signal (voxel quantification)\nTiming: ∼ 1–2 weeks (for step 43)\nQuantify the total amount of histone in telophase to determine nucleosome density on sister chromatids segregated into the stem daughter cell and differentiating daughter cell.\nSave raw images (as 2D Z-stacks) as TIF images from live cell imaging.\nOpen the image on FIJI (ImageJ) software and draw the largest freehand circle that fits within GSCs or SGs to define histone occupied chromatin region to ensure all fluorescence signals associated with the chromatin were measured (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nNote: Use histone fluorescence signal to mark chromatin region.\nProcess the image to get the gray value of each pixel by using \"display_pixel_values\" plugins using FIJI (ImageJ) software.\nDetermined the sum of the gray values of the fluorescence signal of each pixel in each Z-stack in the image (‘‘RawIntDen’’).\nDetermined the sum of the gray values of background pixels in each Z-stack in the image (‘‘RawIntDen’’).",
    "Note: Use the same freehand circle to determine the foreground fluorescence signal and the background signal to ensure the same area was used. For background signal, use the hub region (niche) or any negative region in the tissue where fluorescence tag protein is not expressed.\nCalculate the actual gray values of the fluorescence signal pixels for each Z stack (Foreground Signal, Fs) by subtracting the gray values of the background signal pixels (Background Signal, Bs) from the gray values of the raw signal pixels (Raw Signal, Rs).\nFs = Rs - Bs.\nNext, calculate the total amount of the fluorescence signal in the nuclei by adding the gray values of the fluorescence signal from all Z-stacks (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The total amount of the fluorescence signal (Fs) in the nuclei with ‘n’ Z-stacks (Z1+…+Zn).\nFs (Z1+…+Zn) = [(Rs-Bs)1+…+(Rs-Bs) n].\nNote: The total amount of gray value would represent actual amount of histone protein in the nucleus [quantification in volume (Voxel)].\nUse the below formulas for the calculation:\nNumber of nucleosomes in the genome = ½ amount of histone.\nAverage nucleosome density = Number of nucleosome / the genome length.\nNote: Two copies of each core histones (2× H3, 2× H4, 2× H2A, and 2× H2B) are present in the nucleosome. Thus, the amount of nucleosomes would be half the amount of histones.\nDetermine the ratio of nucleosome density between sister chromatids segregated toward the stem daughter cells (GSC side) and differentiating daughter cells (GB side) in telophase (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nNucleosome density ratio (GSC/GB) telophase = (Nucleosome number / length of DNA)GSC side / (Nucleosome number / length of DNA)GB side\n= (Nucleosome number)GSC side / (Nucleosome number)GB side\n= (½ total amount of histones)GSC side / length of DNA / (½ total amount of histones)GB side / length of DNA",
    "= (total amount of histones)GSC side / (total amount of histones)GB side.\nNote: Ratio of total amount of histone in telophase would reflect relative nucleosome density between segregated sister chromatids (Ranjan et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nFor control, determine the ratio of nucleosome density between the sister chromatids segregated in telophase SGs.\nNucleosome density (SG1/SG2) telophase = (total amount of histones)SG1 side / (total amount of histones)SG2 side.\nNote: Orient SG toward the fusome structure (SG1=towards fusome and SG2 = away from fusome).\nCritical: The length of DNA for both sets of sister chromatids should be equal; therefore, the amount of histone would be directly correlated to genome-wide average nucleosome density.\nAnalysis of nucleosome density\nUse 10–15 GSC-GB pairs and 10–15 SG1-SG2 pairs to calculate the nucleosome density.\nGenerate the dot plot for all the datasets and determine the mean value and standard error of the mean (SEM) and calculate statistical significance.\nDefining nucleosome density status of the sister chromatids in telophase: we define asymmetric nucleosome density: if the mean value in GSC-GB pairs is > mean + 1∗STD in control (SG1-SG2 pairs). We define symmetric nucleosome density: if the mean value in GSC-GB pairs is < mean + 1∗STD in control (SG1-SG2 pairs) (Ranjan et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nCritical: In telophase, sister chromatids segregate to the opposite pole and are easy to quantify. Thus, the quantification of nucleosome density at this stage would reflect the average nucleosome density on each set of the sister chromatids."
