    "1. Cell culture and fluid shear stress exposure\nNOTE: Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were used as an example to study SS induced interaction of SMADs. The protocol described below can be applied to every SS responsive cell type.\nCoat 6-channel slide with 0.1% porcine skin gelatin in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C.\nSeed HUVECs in pre-coated 6-channel slides at a density of 2.5 x 106 cells per mL in 30 µL of M199 full medium.\n\tNOTE: For further information on how to seed cells in the flow slide, see reference24.\nLet cells adhere for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator.\nAdd 60 µL of pre-warmed M199 full medium to each of the reservoirs.\nCulture for 2 days, with a gentle medium exchange once a day, at 37 °C in a humidified incubator.\n\t\nAspirate the reservoirs completely, add 120 µL of pre-warmed M199 full medium in one of the reservoirs, and aspirate from the other side.\nAdd 60 µL of pre-warmed M199 full medium to both reservoirs.\nAssemble and start the flow set-up as detailed in the reference25.\n\t\nMount tubing on fluidic units. Here, silicone tubing with a diameter of 0.8 mm and 1.6 mm are used to apply shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 and 30 dyn/cm2, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: The material and tubing length should remain constant, as changes could influence the resulting shear stress. In general, other combinations of pump systems and tubing can be used, as long as the resulting shear stress is known, and the pump creates a steady laminar flow.\nFill the reservoirs with an appropriate amount of pre-warmed M199 full medium (minimum 10 mL).\nConnect fluidic units with the tubing to the pump system and perform a pre-run without cells to equilibrate the medium and to remove any remaining air25.",
    "Serially connect the single channels on the 6-channel slide to one another by using serial connection tubing. The first and the last channel on the slide will be connected to the tubing assembled in 1.6.1 (see Figure 1A for a scheme). Be careful not to introduce any air into the system as this could severely harm the cells. Further information on the serial connection can be found in reference26.\nFor the exposure of cells to high levels of shear stress (>20 dyn/cm2), use a ramp phase, i.e., increase the shear stress stepwise with adaptation phases. Steps can be set in increments of 5 dyn/cm2 per 30 min.\n2. Fixation\nDetach slides from the pumps after the fluid SS exposure. Use clamps on the tubing when detaching, to avoid the medium spill in the incubator.\nImmediately transfer flow slides on ice, while the remaining tubing is detached sequentially. When removing the tubing from reservoirs, the reservoir on the other side should be kept closed with a finger to avoid trapping air bubbles in the channel. This might interfere with fixation steps.\nKeeping the cells on ice, aspirate the medium carefully from the reservoirs but not from the channel where the cells reside. Subsequently, wash samples with cold sterile PBS (4 °C) with three times the channel volume (90 µL). Add PBS in one reservoir and aspirate carefully from the other reservoir. Repeat this step in each of the 6 channels per slide.",
    "NOTE: For all washing and incubation steps the respective solution is added in one of the reservoirs which leads to an exchange of solutions in the channel. To allow for complete substitution of solutions in the channel, the excess solution is then aspirated from the other reservoir. Solution on the top of the cells in the channel is not removed. Cells should not dry at any time. Therefore, it is important to wash carefully without any air bubble insertion into the slides.\nFix the cells by adding 90 µL of buffered 4% PFA solution in the same reservoir where the PBS was added beforehand and similarly aspirate the liquid from the other reservoir. Repeat this step in each channel in each slide. After the addition of PFA solution, transfer the samples from ice to room temperature (RT) and incubate for 20 min.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic and should be handled carefully. Use gloves and work under a fume hood.\nWash cells 3x with PBS (RT) by adding it in one reservoir and aspirating carefully from the other reservoir. Empty just the reservoirs, ensuring not to dry out the channel. Repeat this step for each of the 6 channels per slide.\nQuench the PFA-fixation by adding 90 µL of ambient 50 mM ammonium chloride in PBS in one of the reservoirs. Aspirate excess solution from the other reservoir. Repeat for each channel in the slide. Incubate the samples for 10 min at RT.\nWash as described in step 2.5.\n\t​NOTE: At this point, the samples may be stored at 4 °C overnight, or the protocol can be immediately continued with blocking and primary antibody incubation (see step 3).\n3. Blocking and primary antibody incubation",
    "To permeabilize the cells, add 90 µL of 0.3% Triton-X-100 in PBS in an emptied reservoir, and aspirate from the other reservoir for each channel. Incubate for 10 min at RT.\nWash as described in step 2.5.\nAdd 90 µL of sterile PLA blocking solution in one reservoir of a channel and aspirate from the other side. Repeat this step for each channel. Block for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber.\n\t\nTo make a humidified chamber, use a 10 cm dish with wet tissue sealed with wax film and place the dish in the incubator. Alternatively, other humidity chamber formats can be used that supply a humid atmosphere.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, self-made blocking solution can be used (e.g., 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS, sterile filtered).\nPrepare primary antibodies (1:100) in PLA antibody diluent. Prepare 30 µL of the solution per channel. Add both primary antibodies simultaneously and vortex.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, self-made antibody diluent can be used (e.g., 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS). Antibodies used here are combinations of SMAD1-SMAD2/3, SMAD2/3-SMAD4 and phospho-SMAD1/5-SMAD4. Detailed information can be found in the Table of Materials.\nBefore the application of primary antibodies, aspirate the blocking solution from the reservoirs and, also, carefully from the channel. Pipette 30 µL of the primary antibody solution immediately into the empty channel by tilting the channel while adding the solution.\n\tNOTE: Perform the removal of the blocking solution and addition of the antibody solution channel-by-channel to ensure cells do not dry out in between.\nIncubate samples with the primary antibodies overnight in humidified chambers at 4 °C.\n\t​NOTE: The incubation can also be performed for 1 h at room temperature, if interested in continuing with the following steps on the same day.\n4. PLA probe incubation",
    "NOTE: For all steps in section 4.1-7.3, the washing buffers A and B are stored at 4 °C and need to be warmed to RT prior to the use.\nDilute PLA-probes (+)-mouse and (-)-rabbit to 1:5 in PLA antibody diluent (or 1% BSA) solution. Prepare 30 µL per channel.\nWash samples 2x for 5 min using 90 µL of the wash buffer A at RT by adding it in one of the reservoirs and aspirating carefully from the other reservoir. Repeat this step for each of the 6 channels per slide.\nAspirate the wash buffer A carefully and add 30 µL of PLA probe solution (prepared in step 4.1), similar to the addition of primary antibodies in step 3.5.\nIncubate samples for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber.\n5. Ligation\nWash samples 2x for 5 min using 90 µL of the wash buffer A at RT, as described in 4.2.\nPrepare a 1:5 dilution of the ligation buffer in deionized water. Use this buffer to dilute the ligase enzyme to 1:40 (on ice). Use 30 µL per channel.\nAspirate the wash buffer A completely and add the ligation solution as described in 3.5.\nIncubate samples for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber.\n6. Amplification\nWash samples 2x for 2 min using 90 µL of wash buffer A at RT, as described in 4.2.\nPrepare the amplification buffer by diluting it 1:5 in deionized water and use it to dilute the polymerase enzyme to 1:80 (on ice). Protect from light. Prepare 30 µL per channel.\nAspirate the wash buffer A completely and immediately add the prepared amplification solution into the empty channel, as described in 3.5. Incubate samples for 100 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber.\n7. Mounting",
    "Wash samples 2x for 10 min using 90 µL of Wash Buffer B at RT as described in 4.2. Add DAPI (1:500) from 1 mg/mL stock solution (in deionized water) in the first wash to stain nuclei. Do not dry the channel.\nDilute the wash buffer B in deionized water (1:10) and wash 1x with 90 µL of 0.1x buffer B solution as described in 4.2.\nAspirate the wash buffer B completely and immediately add 2-3 drops of the liquid mounting medium into one reservoir. Distribute it in the channel by tilting the slide. Store samples at 4 °C in a humidified environment until imaging.\n8. Image acquisition\nAcquire images using a fluorescence microscope. Ensure that the respective filters fitting the fluorescent PLA probes are available.\n\tNOTE: It is beneficial to make use of a confocal microscope, if possible, as obtained PLA spots are more defined. This also supports further image processing and data analysis.\n9. Image analysis and quantification using ImageJ/FIJI\nProcess exported images (.tiff) with an image processing program, such as ImageJ27.\n\tNOTE: All scripts used within this study and that are necessary for the automatic counting of cellular, nuclear, and all PLA events (per cell) can be found in a GitHub repository: https://github.com/Habacef/Proximity-Ligation-Assay-analysis. Perform statistical analysis using any suitable program or tool.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
