    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nViral injections\nTiming: 30–45 min\nViral injections allow for delivery of a viral tracer that is directionally transported from the injection site. Based on duration from injection to animal sacrifice, the approximate number of synapses traversed can be determined (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Brain areas expressing virus outside of the injection site suggest transsynaptic connectivity with the area of injection. Transsynaptic tracing methodology is heavily dependent on the tracer used, injection target and model organism. Here we describe murine cerebellar injections of herpes simplex virus-H129 VC22 (HSV-H129; Pisano et al. [2021][href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). For HSV-H129 or PRV injections, this procedure should be done in a dedicated biosafety level 2 area with appropriate personal protective equipment by trained personnel.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Application of Kwik-Sil to post-injection craniotomy\n(A) Punched-out craniotomy over the vermis cerebellum.\n(B) Kwik-Sil two-chamber syringe next to the weigh boat.\n(C) Kwik-Sil is put into the weigh boat.\n(D) Kwik-Sil being mixed. Kwik-Sil is a binary product, and must be sufficiently mixed to ensure that it will cure.\n(E) Application of Kwik-Sil over the craniotomy site. Having a dry skull around the craniotomy helps the product adhere. Take care only to apply the product to the craniotomy site and surrounding skull.\n(F) View of craniotomy after application of Kwik-Sil. Scale bars 2.5 mm (A and F).\nPlease adjust injection protocols according to local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as well as Environmental Health and Biological safety requirements. In our case, all experimental procedures were approved by Princeton’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol numbers 1943-19 and 1023-15A1/2).\nEnsure the surgical area has been cleaned, tools sterilized and all supplies gathered.\nMix injection solution.",
    "Mix 18 microliters of viral solution with 2 microliters of 0.5% CTB-555. Ensure proper mixing through gentle pipetting, do not vortex. Place this mixture back on wet ice.\nNote: We prefer a 9:1 ratio of viral solution to 0.5% CTB-555 as described given the viral solution titers used in our studies. Transsynaptic tracing injection doses (plaque-forming units delivered in a single injection) should just be above the infectivity threshold (Saleeba et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Ugolini, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). Consequently, this ratio should be adjusted based on viral stock titer and desired injection volume.\nAnesthetize and mount mouse on the stereotaxic apparatus.\nTurn on oxygen flow to the isoflurane induction chamber.\nPlace the mouse into the induction chamber and then turn on flow of isoflurane to 5%. Wait for the mouse to become sedated. We find that the mouse will initially breathe rapidly. Breathing normalization is indicative of sufficient dose of anesthetic.\nAdjust flow from induction chamber to stereotax and decrease from 5% to 4% isoflurane.\nTake the mouse out of chamber and mount on stereotax using ear bars and bite bar.\nSlide nose cone over mouse’s nose, then decrease the isoflurane to 2.5%.\nNote: Adjust level of anesthesia delivered based on mouse breathing rate and level of sedation. Faster breathing may require incremental increases in anesthesia and should be adjusted accordingly throughout the experimental procedure.\nPlace ophthalmic ointment on mouse eyes using sterile swab.\nProvide the mouse with a subcutaneous injection of mannitol and rimadyl by pinching the skin between the shoulders and injecting directly underneath, without touching muscle.\nNote: Mannitol has been shown to increase viral transduction efficiency and viral spread leading to a net increase in expression in neural tissue (Burger et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Mastakov et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).",
    "Insert rectal temperature probe for real-time temperature readings and adjust mouse warmer accordingly. The mouse body temperature should remain between 33° and 36°C throughout the surgical procedure.\nExpose cranium.\nGently shave the fur from the mouse head. We prefer to use a #10 scalpel blade with warm soapy water.\nSterilize the scalp using 70% ethanol using a cotton swab.\nUsing a scalpel, make a single vertical incision at the midline starting from just posterior to eyes to the occipital bone.\nSplay each layer of tissue open until the skull and posterior neck muscles are exposed. Flush with saline if needed.\nUsing tweezers and microscissors remove each layer of neck muscles from their attachment site on the skull.\nNote: We typically do this in 6 cuts (3 layers for each side). While removing muscle, try to identify and cut around vasculature to prevent unnecessary bleeding. When bleeding occurs, place a saline soaked piece of surgifoam on the site. Then touch a dry swab to the SURGIFOAM sponge to remove additional moisture. Let the sponge remain in place for several minutes to allow for hemocoagulation.\nThen use a cotton swab with 70% ethanol to polish the exposed interparietal and occipital bones. This cleans off any muscle still attached while temporarily making the skull transparent to allow for visualization of cerebellar vasculature (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nPerform craniotomy.\nDetermine injection location. For cerebellar injections, injection location is determined through visual identification of vasculature to identify cerebellar lobules.\nWe found success with two different approaches listed below.\nPunch-out method: using micro-drill slowly drill a single bore hole through the skull using small circular movements.",
    "Note: This method is fast and causes less damage to the skull. However, there is a high risk for overheating the brain tissue deep to the borehole and a risk for drilling into brain tissue. Saline flushes on site and drill tip can help with overheating. A slow deliberate pace can prevent drilling into tissue. Usually CSF can be seen leaking into drill site just before the drill is through the skull.\nTraditional craniotomy method (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E): using a micro-drill burr, drill out a circular trench through the skull. This creates a circular piece of skull that can be gently lifted off with #55 forceps.\nNote: This method has a high success rates, especially when starting. However, it is time-consuming and produces occasional adhesion of dura/brain tissue when removing the inner circular piece of skull. This can be avoided through gently flooding the area with saline to help prevent any suction effects while removing the skull.\nCover exposed brain with saline soaked surgifoam.\nLoad injection pipette (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUsing a pipette, pull up 2 microliters of viral solution while working under a fume hood.\nBackfill the glass pipette by slowly dispensing the viral solution into the back of the syringe.\nFor safety, wipe the back outside of the pipette with a Kimwipe wetted with 70% ethanol. This ensures that any viral solution that may have gotten on the edge and outside of pipette during loading has been inactivated and removed.\nNow place the injection tubing onto the back of the glass pipette and mount the glass pipette onto the injection apparatus.\nMove the pipette roughly into position and using the stereoscope focus onto the tip of the pipette.",
    "Ensure that the injection pipette is functional and not clogged. Hold a Kimwipe that has been wetted with 70% ethanol just under the tip of the injection pipette. Slowly apply pressure to the syringe, watching to ensure the cylinder of injection solution moves to the tip of the glass injection pipette. Continue to apply pressure until you see a bead of liquid exit the tip.\nUsing the Kimwipe, gently wipe away the bead of the injection solution and discharge into BSL-2 waste.\nInject viral solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nRemove the sponge that was covering the brain. During this time while the brain is exposed, we recommend occasionally wetting the brain surface using saline to prevent it from drying.\nWhile visualizing the tip under the stereoscope, move the tip of the injection pipette to the brain’s surface. As you gently advance you should see the brain dimpling, confirming you are indeed at the surface of the brain.\nWithdraw the pipette so that dimpling no longer occurs so that it is at the surface again and zero stereotaxic z coordinate.\nQuickly lower injection pipette to 200 microns perpendicular to the brain surface. We find that rapid movement of the needle helps pierce the brain.\nNote: If there is significant brain dimpling, this usually means the injection pipette was not advanced rapidly enough. This can be overcome by moving the pipette back and forth slowly to advance the pipette through the dimpled surface.\nMove the stereoscope so the meniscus is visualized. Deliver the desired volume by measuring the distance traversed by the meniscus.\nNote: We have found that 80–240 nanoliters provides reproducible infections for our viral titers. We prefer to deliver volume no faster than 100 nL/min.",
    "Do not withdraw the pipette right after injection. Wait at least 1 min to allow the injection solution to spread locally into tissue. During this time, move the stereoscope to focus on the injection site.\nNote: Because our injection solution was pink in color, we were usually able to visualize it in local tissue, further confirming a successful injection.\nSlowly withdraw the injection pipette and dispose of it in an appropriate sharps container.\nNote: For injections targeting deeper regions stereotactically, after piercing the brain surface we recommend slow deliberate descent and eventual ascent of the injection needle. For injections of higher volumes, we recommend keeping the injection pipette in target location for several minutes after injection solution delivery.\nCover injection site.\nGently wet the brain surface with saline.\nApply Kwik-Sil to the brain surface using an applicator after mixing Kwik-Sil using disposable tips or separately on sterile surface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Ensure Kwik-Sil covering touches the bone around the entire craniotomy to form a protective barrier over the brain.\nNote: Allowing the exposed bony surface around the craniotomy to dry slightly at this step has helped keep the Kwik-Sil elastomer plug in place. We prefer to use a sterile swab to gently dry the surrounding cranium for this reason. It is also important to wait for Kwik-Sil to dry before proceeding to the next step, this can be assessed using the wooden back end of a swab to gently touch the Kwik-Sil and ensure it is tacky/rubbery.\nOptional: Once dry, dental cement can be added on top of Kwik-Sil plug and bone. Since injections were never extended past 80 h post injection, we never had problems with Kwik-Sil plugs falling off.\nClose scalp.\nUsing tweezers, pull together two halves of the scalp.",
    "Note: Skin can sometimes adhere to the underlying tissue, if this is the case, gently flush saline onto tissue.\nMoving in a rostral to caudal fashion, pinch scalp together and slowly apply glue to the incision.\nNote: The goal is to seal the skin. Take care to not allow glue to penetrate through to the cranium which could lead to adhesion of scalp to cranium. Alternatively, sutures can be used for this step. Stop anesthesia, release ear bars, pull back nose cone and remove the mouse from the sterotax. Turn off all oxygen and isoflurane flow.\nPlace mouse into new cage.\nAfter glue has dried, remove ear bars and place the mouse into a singly-housed cage (or as protocol requires) with water and food.\nOptional: Have a warming light placed in part of the cage to ensure mouse body temperature remains appropriate during recovery.\nOptional: If protocol allows, a small injection of normal saline (for example 10 mL/kg subcutaneous injection) can be given for post-surgical fluid resuscitation.\nClean up the surgical area, disinfect and dispose of BSL-2 material appropriately.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Modified neuroinvasive viruses can be used to determine neuron connectivity\n(A) Directionality of spread of transsynaptic viral tracers. Schematic of anterograde spread of herpes simplex virus 1 H129 (HSV-H129), and retrograde spread of the Bartha strain of pseudorabies virus (PRV-Bartha) and the N2c strain of rabies which is glycoprotein deleted (Rb N2c ΔG). H129 and PRV-Bartha spread continuously across a chain of synaptically connected neurons, while spread of Rb N2c ΔG requires the trans-complementation of the missing glycoprotein in each cell. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) usually does not spread transsynaptically and is shown for comparison.",
    "(B) Various viral expression levels across a network of connected cells, including local interneurons. Viral expression levels vary continuously along synaptically-connected neurons. The continuous distribution requires consideration of the amount of fluorescence that constitutes a positively infected cell.\nNote: After viral injection protocol has been standardized, we strongly recommend performing an empirical time series to benchmark viral spread characteristics, identifying ideal timepoints for targeted number of synapses spread (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]; see problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]). For discussion regarding time point determination of transsynaptic viral tracers, see Pisano et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]: Methods, In Vivo Virus injections, Transsynaptic time point determination and Discussion, Study limitations.\niDISCO+: immunofixation and clearing\nTiming: 4 weeks\nAlthough many clearing techniques have been developed, we found that the iDISCO+ methodology (Renier et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) generates reproducible high signal to noise, which can be difficult to attain with transsynaptic viral tracing relatively to other viral-driven techniques such as AAV (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). It is first important to identify methanol-compatible antibodies (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]; see https://idisco.info/idisco-protocol/[href=https://idisco.info/idisco-protocol/] for antibody validation protocol) In our experience the most challenging feature of clearing optimization is determining appropriate antibody concentration for each experiment (see problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]). We recommend initially clearing several samples, each with different antibody concentrations. Despite clearing taking several weeks, it is not labor intensive and can be efficient because many samples can be cleared in parallel. To further increase efficiency, we also recommend preparing stocks of solutions (except for primary and secondary antibody solutions) beforehand. This also allows all stocks to be at room temperature (20°C–22°C) before use (see problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for consequences of rapid temperature changes during clearing). For stocks not containing alcohol we optionally recommend adding 1 g/L of sodium azide to prevent microbial growth. Appropriate safety precautions are important as many clearing regents are caustic to skin/eyes.",

Dako antiHSV-1 antibody worked well with methanol-fixed tissues, while V2 antibody was less reactive and V1 was almost completely inactive.\n(B) Antibody detection of viral proteins greatly increased the identification of virus-infected neurons. Scale bars: 250 μm (A) and 20 μm (B).\nNote: Please see accompanying worksheet sheet for clearing. To prevent errors and facilitate communication amongst lab members, we recommend printing one worksheet for each batch of cleared brains and keeping it in a lab clearing binder for members to document when each step was performed.\nNote: Concentrations and timing of incubation steps have been optimized for mouse cerebellar injections of HSV-H129 and PRV at timepoints used in (Pisano et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). We strongly recommend optimizing parameters related to antibody concentration as well as primary and secondary antibody incubation times before full experimental cohorts. Larger chunks of tissue (e.g., rat brain) will require longer duration for most steps in this protocol.\nFix tissue (please refer to Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Mmc1.pdf]- supplementary clearing worksheet for step-by-step instructions and further details).\nAfter tissue extraction, fix tissue for at least 4 h in 4% PFA/PBS.\nNote: We prefer transcardial perfusion before tissue extraction, comparable to Gage et al. (2012)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]. It is important that this step should be performed per local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol to ensure humane treatment.\nNote: We have had best results using transcardial perfusions with initial PBS flushes with 10 μg/mL heparin. This helps prevent spurious signals in cleared tissue secondary to unremoved blood in vasculature.",
    "Note: It is important to be careful not to damage the brain tissue from sharp skull edges or any tools used during the extraction process.\nNote: We recommend fixing tissue overnight on a rocking table, using a 50 mL Eppendorf tube.\nDehydrate tissue.\nTransfer brains to 5 mL Eppendorf tubes and wash with 1× PBS for 30 min, three times rocking at room temperature (R@RT; 20°C–22°C).\nNote: We prefer printing labels, rather than using a marker to write on the tube, as the many wash steps over the 4-week course tends to remove any markings, increasing risk for sample misidentification.\nFor 1 h R@RT, serially dehydrate brains by placing in increasing concentrations of methanol (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 100% methanol).\nPause point: Samples can be stored long term in 100% methanol at 4°C (wrapped in foil, without rocking). Timing works the best to start hydrogen peroxide permeabilization (step 13c) on a Tuesday evening.\nPermeabilize brains in 5% H2O2/methanol overnight R@RT.\nRehydrate brains.\nFor 1 h R@RT, serially rehydrate brains by placing in decreasing concentrations of methanol (100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% methanol).\nWash in 1× PBS for 1 h R@RT.\nWash in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h R@RT, two times.\nWash in 20% DMSO/0.3 M glycine/0.2% Triton X-100/PBS at rocking at 37°C for 2 days.\nBlock brains to reduce non-specific antibody binding.\nRemove samples from the 37°C incubator and allow samples to reach room temperature (20°C–22°C; approximately 1.5 h). Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] depicts consequences of rapid temperature changes during clearing.\nNote: We have found rapid changes in temperature of tissue leads to tissue tears. An alternative approach to these steps is to store the 10%DMSO/6% donkey serum/0.2% Triton X-100/PBS in a 37°C incubator. Then quickly change solutions into this pre-warmed solution, placing them back into the incubator at 37°C.",
    "Block in 10%DMSO/6% donkey serum/0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 2–3 days rocking at 37°C for 2 days.\nPrimary immunostaining.\nRemove samples from the 37°C incubator and allow samples to reach room temperature (20°C–22°C; approximately 1.5 h).\nWhile samples are adjusting to room temperature (20°C–22°C), mix primary antibody solution:\nSpin down antibody at 4°C for 10 min at 17–18 g (∼14,000 rpm). We find this helps remove antibody aggregates that can lead to false positive signal in superficial brain tissue (problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nAdd antibodies in appropriate concentration (See Table S3 in Pisano et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) to 5% DMSO/3% donkey serum/PTwH.\nWash in PBS + 0.2% Tween-20 + 10 μg/mL heparin (PTwH) R@RT for 1 h, two times.\nImmunostain in primary antibody solution rocking at 37°C for 7 days.\nNote: Ideal primary and secondary antibody concentrations depend on experimental parameters including the properties of the virus and primary and secondary antibodies, injection location and size, and hours post-injection. Too much antibody can lead to nonspecific staining, and too little antibody will produce insufficient signal to detect neurons using convolutional neural networks. Optimize antibody concentrations for the specific experimental paradigm before running a full experimental cohort.\nPrimary wash day.\nRemove samples from the 37°C incubator and allow samples to reach room temperature (20°C–22°C; approximately 1.5 h).\nWash in PTwH R@RT for 10 min, then 15 min, then 30 min, then 1 h, then 2 h. Then wash once more in PTwH and leave until the next day.\nNote: These are the minimum number of washes. Adding several extra washes can help decrease false positive signals.\nSecondary immunostaining.\nMix secondary antibody solution:\nSpin down antibodies at 4°C for 10 min at 17–18 g (∼14K RPM) before using.\nAdd secondary antibody to 3% donkey serum/PTwH.",
    "Immunostain samples in secondary antibody solution rocking at 37°C for 7 days.\nNote: Secondary antibody is light-sensitive and should be covered in foil or light-protected to prevent degradation of signal.\nSecondary wash day.\nRemove samples from the 37°C incubator and allow samples to reach room temperature (20°C–22°C; approximately 1.5 h).\nWash in PTwH R@RT for 10 min, then 15 min, then 30 min, then 1 h, then 2 h. Then wash once more in PTwH and leave until the next day.\nNote: This is the minimum number of washes. Adding several extra washes can help decrease false positive signal.\nDehydration and clearing.\nSerially dehydrate brains by placing in increasing concentrations of methanol (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 100% methanol). Each dehydration step should be at least one hour and samples should R@RT.\nPlace tissue in 67% dichloromethane (DCM)/33% methanol R@RT.\nNote: when working with DCM it is important to wear two layers of nitrile gloves and work under a fume hood or snorkel.\nPlace into 100% DCM R@RT for 15 min, two times.\nPlace into 100% dibenzyl ether (DBE) for 1 h, without rocking, but initially invert tube several times.\nPlace into the final solution of 100% DBE and be sure to protect brains from light.\nNote: Brains will rapidly clear in DBE solution (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]); however, we suggest waiting 2–3 days before imaging as brains will continue to clear further with time. Brain should appear as a light amber color; see problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] for troubleshooting brains that remain a dark amber.\nNote: DBE can be cleaned off the outside of the tube with 70% ethanol.",
    "Note: Both primary and secondary antibodies must be compatible with iDISCO+ (they must not be sensitive to methanol fixation). We suggest using the validation method described here for new untested antibodies: https://idisco.info/idisco-protocol/[href=https://idisco.info/idisco-protocol/]. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] shows an example of methanol testing of anti-HSV-1 antibodies (see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nCritical: Appropriate safety precautions are important as many clearing regents are caustic to skin/eyes. Please work in fume hood when appropriate.\nCritical: Dichloromethane (DCM) is toxic and challenging to work with. It must be used in a fume hood or area with appropriate ventilation. For this reason, we suggest preparing the day of use. Certain plastics are not resistant to DCM, thus alway test different plastic containers before their use.\nLight-sheet microscopy\nTiming: 3–6 h\nLight-sheet microscopy takes advantage of refractive index matching of immersion media with cleared tissue to decrease light scattering. iDISCO+ utilizes dibenzyl ether (DBE) for imaging (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C contrasts brain with and without index matching). DBE can dissolve certain plastics. It is important that all microscope hardware that is exposed to solvent be DBE-compatible. Appropriate safety precautions are again important. For this project we used the LaVision Ultramicroscope II in conjunction with custom printed holders that enable gluing of the ventral brainstem for sample mounting. Regardless of light-sheet microscope used, it is essential to ensure the microscope is calibrated and that all light paths/sheets are appropriately aligned per microscope manufacturer recommendations.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The red arrows indicate brain edges. Scale bars 0.5 cm.",
    "Typically, light-sheet microscopy is limited by the working distance of the objective. Because of this, it should be placed along the shortest axis of the brain (dorsal-ventral) to define the detection axis (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B). Optimal illumination by the light sheet is achieved when the light-sheet plane enters from the medial-lateral direction, the next smallest dimension. For imaging at cellular resolution, we have had success with a 4× objective providing 1.63 μm/pixel resolution (1× magnification, 4× objective, 0.28 NA, 5.6–6.0 mm working distance, 3.5 mm × 4.1 mm field of view, LVMI-FLuor 4×, LaVision BioTec; Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). With this objective, we find that 3 × 3 tiling (with typically 10% overlap) per horizontal plane (see problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]). Separate left- and right-sided illumination images were taken every 7.5 micrometers step size using an excitation-sheet with a numerical aperture of 0.008. Light diffracts as the light-sheet passes through tissue causing tissue further away (in X) from the light-sheet source to be less in-focus. Thus, ipsilateral regions will be better illuminated by an ipsilateral light-sheet than a contralateral light-sheet. Towards this goal, BrainPipe automatically utilizes a computational stitching approach (Bria and Iannello, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) to separately stitch together the same z-plane acquired during left-sided illumination (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A) and during right sided-illumination. To utilize the fact that ipsilateral areas will be more in-focus from the ipsilateral sheet, the two stitched images are blended together, using midline sigmoidal-blending of the two planes (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D). This approach helps to reduce light-diffraction imaging artifacts.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Horizontal imaging planes in light-sheet microscopy for cleared mouse brains\n(A) The light-sheet microscopy excitation plane (blue) is orthogonal to the detection-path axis from specimen to objective.

    "(B) The mouse brain is shortest in the dorsal ventral direction and should be oriented with this direction parallel to the detection axis. The mediolateral dimension is next shortest, and the light sheet should enter from this direction.\n(C) Rendering of custom-designed holders to mount mouse brains for whole-brain imaging. The “backstop” (marked by a red asterisk) of the holder provides a surface to glue the caudal and ventral brainstem and prevents glue from obscuring more anterior and ventral surfaces. The ramp (marked by a blue asterisk) provides a positive pitch allowing for complete imaging through the dorsal ventral surface given the working distance of the objective.\n(D) Example of cleared mouse brain after mounting on the custom holder.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Light-sheet imaging parameters for cellular imaging across the entire mouse brain\n(A) Scan configuration for the fastest acquisition. Typically, a 3 × 3 tile scan, using 10% overlap, covers a large enough field of view to encompass the mouse brain. Empirically the left/right illumination, z, channel, x, y acquisition order was found to be the fastest.\n(B) The tradeoff between focus depth and waist curvature of the light-sheet. LaVision’s approach to adjusting the sheet width is by effectively adjusting the excitation numerical aperture (NA). A higher NA gives a thinner horizontal focus but with steeper curvature; this gives better center focus, but focus decays rapidly with increasing distance from the center, increasing risk for photobleaching of tissue.\n(C) Computational stitching between tiles reduces seam artifacts. The red arrows point to seams in images without (top) and with (bottom) computational stitching.\n(D) Sigmoidal blending between stitched left- and right- sided illumination images to produce the final image.

    "Clean a 3D-printed mounting puck and clean with ethanol to remove dust and/or residual glue from any prior imaging. Make sure that the mounting puck is dry.\nRemove a cleared brain from DBE vial and place onto paper towel ventral-side up.\nUse a Kimwipe to gently dry the ventral surface of the brain.\nOptional: Occasionally remaining pieces of dura can be seen on the brain surface. Gently sweep a Kimwipe across these areas to remove unwanted dura mater. Alternatively, use tweezers to gently pull off any remaining dura.\nPut a small drop of glue on the mounting puck where the dorsal brainstem will be placed.\nNote: We find this orientation and gluing scheme is optional for whole-brain imaging excluding the most caudal brainstem. Depending on project goals orientation and gluing location might change. Gluing can cause light scattering, so use the smallest amount possible that prevents brain movement.\nUsing either DBE-compatible tweezers or gloved fingers, gently place the brain into location on the mounting puck. Wait at least 90 s for glue to dry.\nNote: We find less glue is typically better and occasionally smearing the glue before placing the brain hastens the drying process and prevents excess glue from attaching to brain decreasing imaging artifacts.\nNote: Keep in mind there is a balance between allowing the glue to dry for sufficient timing and increased risk of generating bubbles in ventricles (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A and 8B).\nGently turn the brain upside down to ensure glue is dry. Place it into imaging cradle.\nPlace the imaging cradle with brain into the microscope imaging chamber.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

(B) Brain with large ventricular air bubbles causing significant shadow artifacts between two lateral ventricles as well centrally in the third ventricle.\n(C and D) Example corresponding pair of autofluorescent (C) and H129 signal (D) Images after the complete stitching process. Images acquired using 4× objective with 1.63 μm/pixel resolution. Full-resolution images are 6050 × 7160 pixels (XY). 1 mm scale bars.\nTurn on microscope, initialize software and begin acquisition.\nTurn on applicable lasers, camera, stage controller and then initialize software.\nBegin setting up scanning parameters to experimental needs. We find that for most murine brains 3 × 3 tiling with 10% overlap is sufficient to image the entire brain (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A; see problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nNote: it is important to ensure that when setting the inferior (ventral) limit of the scan that the objective does not contact the superior (dorsal) brain surface.\nNote: Imaging time can be minimized by imaging one set of tiles at a specific x-y location at all levels of z and again in the second channel, then moving to a different x-y location for the next set of tiles (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nNote: While initializing scans, inspect ventricles for air bubbles (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A and 8B). If air bubbles are present, we recommend placing the brain back into DBE vial, inverting several times and attempting to reimage it several days later, after the air bubble has had a chance to escape the ventricle.",
    "Removing brain from mounting puck.\nUsing DBE-compatible tweezers or spatula, apply downward pressure to the puck and gently scrape towards the brainstem to separate the brain from the puck.\nNote: We typically find only a small amount of residual glue remains on the brainstem that can either be removed by gently passing Kimwipes across the brainstem surface or using DBE-compatible tweezers to lightly pull off glue.\nPlace the brain back into DBE and protect the brain from light.\nWe have had success reimaging brains several times over the course of several years.\nAnalysis: registration and cell-counting\nTiming: 1–12 h to run analysis script (based on computational power)\nTiming: 1–3 weeks to generate training annotations and train CNN.\nBrainPipe is an automated transsynaptic tracing and labeling analysis pipeline (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). Generally BrainPipe workflow consists of three steps: registration to a common atlas, cell detection and injection site recovery. Registration requires three things: 1) atlas volume, 2) corresponding annotation volume and file, and 3) elastix registration parameter files. BrainPipe includes elastix registration parameter files that work well with the Princeton Mouse Atlas (Pisano et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). BrainPipe is compatible with other atlases, only possibly requiring adjustment of some of the elastix parameter files (see problem 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Methodological comparison of traditional anatomical assignment with automated anatomical assignment\n(A and B) Traditional manual-based tissue-section registration and subregional anatomical assignment example.

    "(C and D) Automated registration and subregional assignment. The blue star illustrates how a point (cell center) can be transformed into different space for eventual anatomical assignment. (C) Volumetric registration transforms light-sheet volumes into atlas space. Automated mapping between the pre-transformed volume and the atlas is established. Deformation fields illustrate two-dimensional plane deformation. (D) Anatomical assignment is automated after volumetric registration to atlas space. The pixel value in annotation space of voxel-coordinates is an identity lookup table and can be used to determine region identity. Scale bars are 500 μm (A), 250 μm (B), 1 mm (C and D). Abbreviations: DRD, dorsomedial raphe nucleus; DRL, dorsolateral raphe nucleus, DRV, ventromedial raphe nucleus.\nTo automate cell detection, BrainPipe utilizes a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). We found that CNNs for our task required about 3,600 human-annotated cell centers (see Figure 1E and Table 2 of Pisano et al. [2021][href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Cell centers from the reconstructed volumes were obtained by thresholding that was established during training evaluation (see Figure 1F of Pisano et al. [2021][href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] and Methods, Automated detection of virally labeled cells, evaluation of CNN). For maximum detection accuracy, cell detection is performed on unregistered full-sized volumes. Then detected cells are transformed to atlas space. The final output consisted of a comma-separated-value file that included the xyz coordinates as well as measures of perimeter, sphericity, and number of voxels in the z-dimension for each detected cell in the brain volume.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1571-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Examples of poorly cleared and torn tissue\n(A) A well-cleared brain in dibenzyl ether (DBE).\n(B) A poorly cleared tissue in DBE. Note the darker amber color.",
    "(C and D) Two horizontal z-planes showing examples of torn tissue resulting from rapid temperature shifts during the clearing process (red arrows) and tears that occur during brain-from-skull extraction process (yellow arrows). (D) There are also two large tears in tissue, one in the cerebellum and the on the right side of the brain. This often occurs when the brain gets damaged during the tissue extraction process. Scale bars: 2 mm (A and B), 1 mm (C and D).\nNote: As a starting point we pre-trained CNNs for both H129 and PRV detection are available at https://lightsheetatlas.pni.princeton.edu/public/brainpipe_demo_datasets/CNN_pretrained_models.tar.gz. Although we found high accuracy both in registration and cell-detection, BrainPipe’s performance is highly dependent on the input data (see problems 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15] and 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]; problem 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17] includes a discussion on CNN’s use in cell detection). Before starting CNN-training, we strongly suggest ensuring previous steps in this protocol (viral injection, antibody clearing and light-sheet imaging) optimization be performed. Pre-trained networks are often a good point to start for troubleshooting or transfer learning but better likely performance can be obtained by training CNNs to each experimenters’ datasets.\nNote: Before analysis, it is important to manually curate the dataset. For our study, we screened each brain (1) clearing quality (ensuring each brain is sufficiently transparent; see problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]), (2) significant tissue deformation from extraction process (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C and 10D, see problem 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]), (3) viral spread from injection site (see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]), (4) antibody penetration (see problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]), (5) blending artifacts related to microscope misalignment, (6) injection site within target location, (7) successful registration (see problem 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]), and (8) convolutional neural network (CNN) overlay of detected cells with brain volume in signal channel (see problem 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]).\nDownload and install BrainPipe: github.com/PrincetonUniversity/BrainPipe.\nInstructions for installation can be found under README.md.",
    "To work through basic use cases of BrainPipe, we recommend going through the EXAMPLES.md file.\nDemonstration datasets to ensure proper usage of BrainPipe can be found at: https://lightsheetatlas.pni.princeton.edu/public/brainpipe_demo_datasets/[href=https://lightsheetatlas.pni.princeton.edu/public/brainpipe_demo_datasets/].\nFor a deeper dive into the BrainPipe pipeline, please see IMPORTANT_FILES.md for details.\nWhen starting to use your own data, BrainPipe expects certain formatting of images. Please see FILE-FORMATTING.md for details.\nFinally the folder tutorials has several Jupyter notebooks to analyze injection sites, generating a CNN (3D U-Net) training set, scaling the CNN, and mapping regions of interest (ROIs) to an atlas.\nWe recommend starting with the BrainPipe information and tutorials listed on Github; however, please see below for some further details to Train and Evaluate a CNN (see problem 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]).\nGenerate annotated training volumes by randomly selecting volumes of at least 200 × 200 × 50 pixels (XYZ) from full-sized cell channel volumes (BrainPipe.tools.conv_net.utils.training).\nNote: To ensure training data is representative of the animal variability across the whole-brain, training volumes should be selective from different anatomical regions in different brains with various amounts of labeling.\nNote: We recommend having several users annotate similar training volumes - this allows for a human-human F1 score which can be used to compare with a CNN-human F1 score. If these two scores are approximately the same, then it indicates that the CNN approaches human-human performance.\nAnnotations were recorded by marking cell centers using ImageJ and imported into Python (BrainPipe.tools.conv_net.utils.training.make_training_inputs).\nGenerate labeled volumes using Otsu’s thresholding method (skimage.filters.threshold_otsu, Scikit-Image; 30 × 30 × 8 voxels, XYZ) around each center to label somas.\nUsing annotated volumes, trained CNN (BrainPipe.tools.conv_net.pytorchutils.run_exp). Select the CNN window, stride, and training-validation-testing split in the run_exp.py module based on project needs and computational power available.\nParams[\"in_spec\"] = dict(input=(1,20,192,192))\nParams[\"output_spec\"] =\ncollections.OrderedDict(cleft=(1,20,192,192))\nParams[\"width\"] = [32, 40, 80]\nparams[\"patchsz\"] = (20,192,192)",
    "Note: We used 192 × 192 × 20 CNN window size with 0.75 strides. Our training dataset was split into a 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% testing subset.\nNote: We suggest stopping training when the loss value, a measure of CNN learning, stabilizes (in our case around 295,000 training iterations). This helps prevent overfitting, i.e., the possibility that the neural network learns particular training examples rather than learning the category.\nTo determine CNN performance on H129 data, calculate an F1 score to compare CNN output with ground truth annotations by quantifying true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP) (BrainPipe.tools.conv_net.training.sweep).\nConnected-component analysis first (scipy.ndimage.label) groups islands of nonzero voxels to identify each island as a putative cell.\nNext calculate pairwise Euclidean distances (scipy.spatial.distance.euclidean) between CNN-predicted cell centers and human-annotated ground truth centers.\nUsing bipartite matching, serially pair closest predicted and ground truth centers and remove each from unpaired pools. Unmatched predicted or ground truth centers should be considered as FPs or FNs, respectively. In our case prediction-ground truth center pairs with a Euclidean distance greater than 30 voxels (∼49 μm) were likely inaccurate and not paired.\nNote: Training the CNN is an interactive process. It is important to not just look at learning statistics but to visualize what the CNN has learned, as well as false negatives and false positives. This way the training dataset can be enriched to facilitate generalized learning applicable to project needs."
