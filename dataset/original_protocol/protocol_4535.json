    "Isolation of B cells   Set the centrifuge temperature to 4 °C.   Put one petri dish per spleen on top of ice in an ice bucket with 5 ml of complete media per dish.    Euthanize mice.    Take dead mice to sterile hood to dissect.    Remove spleens. Place the spleen in the petri dish of complete media on ice.   Grind the spleen between the frosted surfaces of the slides until the mixture is fairly uniform. (Alternatives included crushing spleens using the tip of a syringe or using other methods). Rinse the slides with complete media and transfer the remaining liquid through a filter into a 15 ml conical tube. Keep on ice while collecting other spleens.   Centrifuge the cells at 4 °C, 400 RCF, for 10 min.  Note: This can vary between 8-15 min, depending on the centrifuge, available time, and concern for loss of cells.   Remove tubes from centrifuge. Decant into a container with one swift motion (in the hood, to retain sterility). Resuspend pellet in remaining media after decanting by tapping.   Add ACK (4 ml per spleen) to lyse the red blood cells. Incubate at RT for 4 min. During this incubation, remove connective tissue and membranes of lysed cells, which clump together and look like white filaments or “ghosts”, using a Pasteur pipette.   Fill the conical tube to the top with complete media, invert to mix and centrifuge again at 4 °C, 400 RCF for 10 min.   Vacuum up liquid (under sterile conditions) and resuspend the pellet in remaining media after decanting by tapping. Combine all spleens (keep genders separate).   Count each sample in a hemocytometer. Collect 10 µl aliquot, make a dilution with Trypan blue 1:10 in PBS. Calculate volume needed for 100 x 106 cells/ml.",
    "(live cells) (dilution) (104) = cells/ml; (cells/ml) (volume) = total cells [Total cells]/[100x106 cells/ml] = volume needed for 108 cells/ml   Resuspend to the correct volume in 95% EasySep medium and 5% rat serum at 108 cells/ml.      EasySep B cell enrichment  Note: Follow manufacturer’s indications, which can change. For processing 500 μl-8.0 ml of sample (< 8.0 x 108 cells)   Save an aliquot of cells pre-depletion for FACS.   Prepare cell suspension at 1 x 108 cells/ml in medium with 5% normal rat serum. Place cells in a 14 ml (17 x 100 mm) polystyrene tube.    Add Negative Selection Mouse B cell Enrichment Cocktail at 50 μl/ml. Mix well and incubate on ice for 15 min.   Add Biotin Selection Cocktail at 100 μl/ml. Mix well and incubate on ice for 15 min.    Mix Magnetic Particles to ensure that they are in a uniform suspension by pipetting vigorously 5 times or vortexing quickly. Add the Magnetic Particles at 100 μl/ml. Mix well and incubate on ice for 5 min.   Bring the cell suspension to a total volume of 5 ml (for < 4 x 108 cells) or 10 ml (for 4-8.5 x 108 cells) by adding medium without rat serum. Mix the cells in the tube by pipetting gently 2-3 times.    Place the tube (without cap) into the magnet. Set aside for 5 min at room temperature.   Pick up the magnet and in one continuous motion invert the magnet and tube, pouring off the desired fraction into a new 14 ml tube. Leave the magnet and tube in inverted position for 2-3 sec, and then return to the upright position. Do not shake or blot off any drops that may remain hanging from the mouth of the tube.   Count cells using a hemocytometer.   Check purity and antigen specific cell percentage by flow cytometry.",
    "Save at least 2 x 106 cells for staining.   Place in 96-well plate for staining.   Centrifuge at 280 RCF, 4 °C for 4 min.   Prepare antibody cocktail assuming 50 μl for each sample, antibody mix: NP-APC, CD19-Pacific Blue, CD4-FITC.   Decant residual volume in sink with a quick inversion.   Resuspend pelleted cells in 50 μl of staining media.   Add 50 μl of antibody cocktail to each well.    Mix well with pipette up and down.   Incubate for 20 min on ice, covered with aluminum foil.   Add 100 μl of staining media.   Centrifuge at 280 RCF, 4 °C for 4 min.   Decant residual volume in sink with a quick inversion.    Resuspend pelleted cells in ~175 μl of staining media.   Centrifuge at 280 RCF, 4 °C for 4 min.   Decant residual volume in sink with a quick inversion.   Resuspend pellet in 175 μl of PBS.    Transfer samples from 96-well plate into test tubes immediately before going to the flow cytometry facility.   Add 0.02 μl of EMA per sample right before running on flow cytometer.        Mouse Injection Determine number of cells needed. We would transfer 1 million antigen-specific cells per mouse. We would determine the percentage of antigen-specific B cells in a sample by flow cytometry and then transfer the total number of cells accordingly. We also determined the percentage purity of B cells by flow cytometry. The purity of B cells was typically 90%. Inject 1 million NP+ B viable cells suspended in transfer buffer per mouse intravenously in 0.2 ml volume."
