    "1. Cell Preparation (Day -2 to 0)\nSplit HEK293 cells 1:5 using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate in Growth Media at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until 60 - 80% confluent (2 - 3 days). For each condition, culture cells in 2 x 100 mm dishes.\n2. Cell Transfection (Day 1)\nTransfect HEK293 cells with plasmid encoding Fc-fusion using a transfection reagent such as Lipofectamine. Alternative methods that result in comparable transfection efficiencies may also be used.\nReturn transfected cells to incubator for 24 hr.\n3. Cell Propagation (Day 2)\nPreheat Growth Media without Fetal Bovine Serum (-FBS) to 37 °C.\nRinse dishes 2x with 10 ml Growth Media -FBS, and return the dishes to the 37 °C incubator for 1 hr.\nRinse the cultures dishes one more time with 10 ml Growth Media -FBS, for a total of 3 washes.\nIncubate the transfected HEK293 cells at 37 °C for another 48 hr without FBS before collecting media.\n4. Bead Aggregation (Day 4)\nTo collect media from culture dishes, transfer media from each pair of dishes to 50 ml conical tubes and spin at 500 x g for 5 min to pellet cellular debris.\nFilter media from 50 ml conical tube into a centrifugal filter using a 30 ml syringe and 0.45 µm syringe filter.\nSpin centrifugal filters at 4,000 x g and 4 °C until volume of concentrated culture media is approximately 500 µl (approximately 15 min). Repeat until all culture media has been added and concentrated.\nAdd 1.5 µl of Protein G magnetic beads to 1 ml of ice cold Binding Buffer in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for each sample, place on a magnet and remove buffer. Immediately add the concentrated culture media to the Protein G magnetic beads.\nRotate tubes at 4 °C for 2 hr.",
    "Place tubes on a magnet and remove media. Quickly wash beads twice with ice cold 1 ml Binding Buffer, and then resuspend beads in 300 µl Binding Buffer.\nSplit resuspended beads into 2 tubes, 150 µl into each tube, and then add 1.5 µl of 200 mM CaCl2  or 200 mM EDTA for the “calcium” and “no calcium” conditions, respectively.\nTransfer 100 µl from each condition to a depression well slide and collect micrographs using a transmitted light microscope (Figure 2). Collect images from 5 fields of view for each experiment at each desired time point.\n5. Data Analysis\nUsing ImageJ, or comparable image analysis software, open one of the five image datasets using the Import/Image Sequence… from the File pulldown menu. These will be opened as an image stack.\nIn the Image/Properties… dialog box, change the image units to pixels and set Pixel Width and Pixel Height to 1.0.\nConvert the images to binary using the Adjust/Threshold… command in the Image pulldown menu. Set the threshold to include pixels that contribute to beads or bead aggregates, but that exclude background and small particles. Apply to all images in the stack.\nIn the Set Measurements dialog box, check the Area and Stack Position boxes.\nRun Analyze Particles… in the Analyze pulldown menu. This will generate a list of identified particles, including their size (area) and the image in which they were identified.\nRepeat this process for which experiment and experimental condition.\nSubscription Required.
