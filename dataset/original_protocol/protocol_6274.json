    "Staining FFPE tissue samplesNotes:  Tissue sections should be sliced at 5 to 10 μm thickness. Sectioning the tissue too thin can result in loss of cell volume and false negative detection of centrosomes. The optimal thickness should be determined according to the specific tissue samples used.For each section, we recommend the use of an H&E stained section as a guide slide to identify regions of interest. Tissue preparation. Timing: ~1 h. Bake tissues 1 h or overnight at 65 °C in a hot air oven. Note: This can vary according to the experiments based on tissue thickness. Deparaffinization. Timing: ~25 min.Immerse tissue slides in a Coplin jar containing 100% fresh Xylene for 7 min at room temperature in a fume hood. Repeat Step 2a twice, 3 times total.Rehydration. Timing: ~45 min.Incubate slides in a Coplin jar containing 100% Isopropanol for 7 min at room temperature in a fume hood twice.Incubate slides in a Coplin jar containing 70% Isopropanol for 7 min at room temperature in a fume hood. Incubate slides in a Coplin jar containing 50% Isopropanol for 7 min at room temperature in a fume hood. Incubate slides in a Coplin jar containing ddH2O for 7 min at room temperature twice.Note: The slides can be kept at room temperature in ddH2O overnight before proceeding. Antigen retrieval. Timing: ~1 h. Note: This can vary depending on the device used.  Add 500 ml deionized or filtered water into a decloaking chamber or a pressure cooker.Add 200 ml freshly prepared antigen retrieval buffer into a slide staining dish and immerse the slides into antigen retrieval buffer. Balance the decloaking chamber using another slide staining dish with 200 ml ddH2O in it.Close the lid of the decloaking chamber and rotate it to make sure the decloaking chamber is appropriately sealed.",
    "Turn on the decloaking chamber to incubate the slides for 20 min at its full pressure. For Decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical, DC0228), it is set to approximately 103 kPa/15 psi, and it will achieve a temperature of approximately 120 °C at full pressure. Open the decloaking chamber after the pressure is completely released and the decloaking chamber is cooled down.Transfer slides to a humidified chamber and incubate slides in washing buffer by placing a droplet of washing buffer on top of each slide to cover the tissue for 5 min at room temperature.Notes:Declocking chamber at full pressure is dangerous. The pressure must be completely released before opening. From this step on, it is very important that the slides do not dry out. Make sure to perform all the following steps in a humidified chamber. Blocking. Timing: ~30 minGently tap the slides by holding the slides horizontally with label facing the investigator and tap on the bottom edge to remove excess liquid. Cover the tissue section with 100 μl of blocking buffer. Gently place a piece of coverslip on top of the tissue to evenly spread the liquid and incubate slides for 30 min at room temperature.Note: The slides can be kept in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight before proceeding. Primary antibody incubation. Timing: Overnight. Note: This can vary according to the experiment. Remove coverslips and gently tap the slides to remove excess liquid. Cover the tissue section with 100 μl of diluted antibodies in blocking buffer. Gently place a piece of coverslip on top of the tissue to evenly spread the liquid and incubate slides overnight at 4 °C. Alternatively, tissue slides can be incubated in primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Note: The dilutions for primary antibodies can vary depending on the targets.",
    "Optimal antibody concentrations should be determined on a case-by-case basis. We have successfully stained different centrosomal markers. The primary antibodies and dilutions can be found in Materials and Reagents. To quantify centrosome numbers per cell, investigators should choose centrosomal markers and cell border markers accordingly. To simultaneously stain different targets, investigators should choose the antibodies that are raised in different species. For example, we have successfully co-stained CEP135 (rabbit) to mark centrioles and E-Cadherin (mouse) to mark epithelial cell borders in different tissue types (Figure 1A). Secondary antibody incubation. Timing: 45 min to 1 h.Remove coverslips and wash slides three times in washing buffer by placing a droplet of washing buffer on top of each slide to cover the tissue, 5 min each at room temperature.Dilute secondary antibodies in the blocking buffer. For each tissue slide, 100 μl blocking buffer is recommended. Remove coverslips and gently tap the slides to remove excess liquid.Cover the tissue section with 100 μl of diluted antibodies in blocking buffer. Gently place a piece of coverslip on top of the tissue to evenly spread the liquid and incubate for 30 min to1 h at room temperature.Note: For co-staining different markers, investigators should choose the secondary antibodies conjugated to different fluorophores according to the primary antibodies used and the filter sets on the microscope available. For example, image E-Cadherin (mouse), CEP135 (rabbit) and DNA together using a microscope equipped with FITC, TRITC, and DAPI filter sets. We used Alexa-488 Goat anti-mouse for E-Cadherin (mouse), and Alexa-568 Goat anti-rabbit for CEP135 (rabbit). The dilutions for secondary antibodies can vary. We have successfully used AlexaTM conjugated, highly cross-absorbed secondary antibodies from Invitrogen used at a 1:200 dilution. Samples stained with secondary antibodies only can be used as negative controls to increase the robustness of the analysis. Counterstain.",
    "Timing: ~30 min.Remove coverslip and wash slides three times in washing buffer, 5 min each at room temperature.Counterstain with Hoechst (1:1,000; 10 µg/ml) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Wash slides twice in washing buffer by placing a droplet of washing buffer on top of each slide to cover the tissue, 5 min each at room temperature.Mount. Timing: 24 h.Mount tissue sections using ProLong® Diamond Antifade Mountant and store in the dark at room temperature overnight for mountant to cure. Note: Avoid bubbles in the tissue area. You can add a drop of mountant on coverslips and invert the coverslip to cover the tissue section.  Seal with nail polish after cure. Note: Image the sample next day after the mountant has cured, or store at -20 °C for future analysis. Protect the samples from light. The samples can be stored at -20 °C, protected from light for more than a year. ImagingUse low magnification objective (e.g., 10x, N.A 0.7) to find the region of interest.Use high magnification objective (e.g., 60x, N.A 1.42 oil) to image the region of interest defined from Step B1 by Z-sections. Use a cell-cell junction marker (e.g., E-Cadherin) to find the whole cell volume and set the Z-section thick enough to cover the whole tissue section. We have successfully separated centrosomes at different focal planes using Z-sectioning with a 0.2 μm interval on DeltaVision Core system with a 60x objective, NA 1.42. Export images to .tiff format before performing proceeding to dara analysis.Note: High resolution microscope systems like confocal or deconvolution microscopy can be used to image the region of interest. Note that a confocal microscope uses a pinhole to block out-of-focus light in the z-plane while deconvolution microscope uses computational methods to remove the out-of -focus light after capturing the image.",
    "Since each deconvolution method should be generated specifically for each objective on the imaging system, we only used deconvolution files generated on the DeltaVision core system using softWoRx.Representative graphs using the protocol to display the quantification of centrosome numbers in tissue was recently published (Wang et al., 2019a, Wang et al., 2019b). They can be found in figure 2 in our published paper (Wang et al., 2019b)."
