    "Blood collection and plasma preparationParticipants in the study were assigned a unique QR code to be used for sample submission.Blood collection kits included capillary blood collection containers, labeled with a unique 1D barcode generated by COVIDTrack.Participants self-collected 100-150 µL of fingertip blood specimens in a barcoded capillary blood collection container and stored it at 4°C for <24 h before submission.Submitted sample containers were inspected for leaks and required minimum volume (as indicated by marked lines on capillary) then wiped with ethanol.Barcodes from each sample container were scanned and assigned to a Biobank tube and a 96-well position.A 2D barcode on a 0.3 mL Biobank tube is scanned to assign the blood sample to a storage tube and placed in a matching well coordinate of a Biobank plate frame.Sample containers were centrifuged at 2,600 × g for 5 min at 4°C in a swing bucket rotor prior to carefully transferring 15-80 μl of plasma to the assigned 0.3 mL Biobank tube and 96-well position. Typically, up to 80 μl of plasma can be collected from the blood sample after centrifugation. A minimum of 15 μl of sample is required for the semi-automated sample dilution described in this protocol.The Biobank plate frame barcode is scanned, and the well location recorded.Once all tubes have been scanned and designated as Accepted or Rejected, the scanned data is imported in COVIDTrack to update the location and status of samples. Samples are rejected due to low collection volume, leakage of the blood outside the internal reservoir of the collection tube, or formation of a blood clot.Plasma was stored at 4°C until assayed and then frozen at -70°C for long-term storage.To support deidentified sample processing, the Tube ID is converted to a Specimen ID following the sample check-in import.",

Serology Assay. Video of the robotic workstation running the assay.Spike protein production and purificationThe plasmid containing the sequence for the modified spike protein was a gift from the Florian Krammer lab (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NYC) (Amanat et al., 2020). Modifications to remove furin cleavage sites and add cleavable purification tags (including 8× His) are as previously described (Robbiani et al., 2020).The SARS-CoV2 modified spike protein cDNA was subcloned into a qQCXIH vector with a 10× His tag at the carboxy terminus. A stably expressing Expi293F cell line was established using an ectopic retrovirus system, as previously described by         Tsai et al. (2014)        .Cells were cultured in suspension in Expi293 media on an orbital shaker at 125 rpm in an 8% CO2 tissue culture incubator.Clarified supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min followed by 0.22 μm filtration.After adjusting the pH to 7.4, cleared supernatant was applied to the HisTrapTM Excel column via the AKTA start system.The column was washed with 50 column volumes of HisTrap wash buffer (containing 20 mM imidazole) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail.Elution was performed with 10 column volumes of HisTrap elution buffer (that contains 500 mM imidazole). Peak fractions were collected as a pool.Buffer was exchanged to PBS with an Amicon Ultra column, and yield was 1-2 mg per liter of culture.Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 ELISA platesThe ELISA workstation (Figure 1) was used to coat 384w ELISA plates with 20 µL of SARS-CoV2 Spike antigen, diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 2 µg/mL in columns 3-12 and 15-24. The antigen can easily be added to the 384w plate manually using a multi-channel pipettor.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4301/bioprotoc-12-02-4301-g001.jpgFigure 1.",

(A) Side and B) top views of the workstation consisting of (a) Plate hotels, (b) suction cup delidder, (c) G3 Janus liquid handler, (d) washer/dispenser, (e) Nivo plate reader, and (f) robotic arm.Columns 1, 2, 13, and 14 were coated with BSA to test reactivity of samples on a non-specific antigen, by adding 20 µL of blocking buffer to these wells.Plates were sealed with a plastic plate seal and placed at 4°C overnight.The following day, seals were removed from the coated plates and the plates returned to the workstation to be washed with wash buffer (4 × 80 µL).Non-specific binding to the ELISA plates was blocked by adding 40 µL of blocking solution to each well for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed with wash buffer (4 × 80 µL).After washing, ELISA plates should be used within 1 h to avoid overdrying of the antigen coating.Plasma Dilution (Figure 3)To collect the diluted samples at the bottom of the tubes, the biobank tubes in frames were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature using a table centrifuge with plate carriers and locking lids.In a biosafety cabinet (see Figure 2A), all samples (participant plasma, positive controls, and negative controls) in 0.3 mL biobank tubes were decapped and were diluted 1:5 with plasma dilution buffer in separate 0.3 mL biobank tubes by using a Viaflo 96 well automated pipetting instrument with low retention tips. Tubes containing a volume of less than 20 µL were diluted manually.Tubes were recapped using the decapper (Figure 2A), and then centrifuged briefly at room temperature, to ensure the diluted plasma was collected at the bottom of the tube.Diluted plasma samples were then arrayed into columns 1 and 7 of each 96w source plate frame.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4301/bioprotoc-12-02-4301-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "A. Sample dilution setup. B. ELISA setup.Serial Dilution (Figure 3)In a biosafety cabinet (dilution hood, Figure 2A), the Viaflo 96 pipettor with low retention tips on columns 1 and 7 was used to dispense 30 µL of blocking buffer to columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 of a 96w PCR plate, and 95 µL was added to columns 2 and 8, as the diluent for the serial dilution.The 1:5 diluted plasma sample tubes were decapped and used as the source for the serial dilution. The Viaflo 96 pipettor was configured with low retention tips on the columns 1 and 7, to add 5 µL of diluted samples from the source plate frame into columns 2 and 8 of the PCR serial dilution plate (final conc 1:100), followed by slow mixing (3 × 80 µL).A volume of 30 µL of the 1:100 dilution was transferred from columns 2 and 8 to columns 1 and 7. The source tubes were recapped and set aside, while the Viaflo 96 pipettor program continued to generate a 5-point 1:4 serial dilution, by transferring 10 µL of diluted samples from columns 2 and 8 into columns 3 and 9 followed by mixing (3 × 30 µL).The process was repeated advancing the samples one column until a volume of 10 µL was dispensed into columns 6 and 12 and mixed.Finally, 10 µL of diluted sample was removed from columns 6 and 12 and discarded. The final dilution concentrations in the series were 1:100, 1:400, 1:1,600, 1:6,400 and 1:25,600. Figure 3D shows the positions of the wells and final dilution achieved by this procedure.PCR plates were covered with lids and transferred to the ELISA hood (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4301/bioprotoc-12-02-4301-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Well numbers are denoted on the plate and the labels below the plate indicate dilution level in that column.ELISA 384 Well AssayIn a biosafety cabinet (Figure 2B, ELISA hood), samples in 4-96w serial diluted PCR plates were assayed in each previously coated and blocked 384w ELISA plate, by transferring 17.5 µL of each sample from the 96w serial dilution PCR plates into one of the four-well quadrants of the 384w ELISA plate (Figure 4), using a Viaflo 96/384 automated pipettor with regular tips.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4301/bioprotoc-12-02-4301-g004.jpgFigure 4. Addition of serial diluted plasma to quadrants of a 384 well ELISA plate as illustrated by blue dye. Inside the biosafety cabinet, lids were place on ELISA plates containing diluted samples and incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and then washed (4 × 80 µL) with wash buffer.After washing, the ELISA plates with lids were moved to the ELISA workstation, placed in the stationary plate hotels, and the program executed.Briefly, each plate in the run cycles through each of the steps in the ELISA workflow in a timed sequence (Video 1).The process started with the first delidded plate moving to the Janus deck, where 20 µL of HRP solution was added to each well. Then, the plate was lidded and incubated for one hour at room temperature in the plate hotel.Each plate was moved to the washer and washed (4 × 80 µL) with wash buffer.To remove the residual Tween-20 in the wash buffer, 80 µL of PBS was dispensed into the plate by the washer using the peri-pump followed by the washer removing the PBS from each well.",
    "The robotic arm transferred the plate from the washer to the Janus deck to dispense 25 µL of Turbo TMB-ELISA substrate solution, and returned the plate to the plate hotel for a 30 min incubation at room temperature.The Janus system discarded the used tips into the tip box, which was upstacked into the PlateStak; while a fresh box of tips was downstacked to be loaded on the I30 MDT head.To develop the assay, the plate was again moved to the Janus deck using the robotic arm and 25 µL of stop solution was dispensed into each well.Plates were transferred to the Victor Nivo reader and the absorbance of each sample read at 450 nm.The robotic arm moved the plate to the washer to remove the stopped HRP reaction solution, prior to returning the plate to the plate hotel for disposal.Assay ValidationThe 5-point ELISA assay was tested using a SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody, AM1414, at increasing concentrations (2.5 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, and 20 ng/mL) compared to the Accurun 810 negative serum (ARN) that the antibody was diluted in.The AM1414 monoclonal antibody showed a dose dependent increase in signal (Figure 5A).The Community Center Blood Center negative plasma (BB26, BB27, and BB29) had very little reactivity using the Spike antigen or BSA antigen (Figure 5B-5C).All PFM COVID-19 positive samples from active or recovered individuals show significantly higher absorbance values than the positive AM1414 control (Figure 5D-5E)All PFM COVID-19 negative samples showed significantly lower absorbance than the positive AM1414 control (Figure 5F), but higher absorbance values than blood bank samples (Figure 5B).Most samples showed no reactivity towards BSA coated plates, with the exception of PFM-R5 and PFM-N2 (Figure 5G).",
    "Those samples were clearly distinguished as positive and negative, respectively, in the dilution assay, indicating that non-specific reactivity is not a major limitation in our assay.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4301/bioprotoc-12-02-4301-g005.jpgFigure 5.

(C) and (G) show control, blood bank, and PFM control sample absorbance, upon binding to wells coated in BSA.Alternative 96-Well ProcedureThe 384w assay was miniaturized from the initial 96w assay that was developed.The ELISA workstation was configured for 96w assays, by using the 96w I200 MDT head with P235 filtered disposable tips (PerkinElmer; catalog number: 6001289) on the Janus platform and the 96-pin head on the washer.The basic workflow is the same; however, the serial dilutions, volumes, and timing are different.The protocol is described briefly here. The 96w Immulon 2 HB ELISA plates (ThermoFisher Scientific, catalog number: 3455) were coated with 50 µL of Spike antigen in blocking buffer.The coating was washed with wash buffer (3 × 250 µL) prior to the addition of 100 µL of blocking buffer, which was washed with wash buffer after 1 h incubation at room temperature.The 1:5 plasma dilution was performed as described in the 384w assay.The serial dilution was performed in low volume, by adding diluent to the PCR plate (14 µL to columns 2 and 8, and 12 µL to columns 3-6 and 9-12).A volume of 14 µL of plasma dilution buffer was added to columns 2 and 8 and mixed before 12 µL of the sample was transferred to columns 1 and 7.",
    "A serial dilution was performed by transferring 4 µL of samples from columns 2 and 8 to columns 3 and 9, then mixing.The process was repeated moving 4 µL of sample to complete the dilution, and subsequently, removing 4 µL from columns 6 and 12 to be discarded.A total of 108 µL of plasma dilution buffer was added to each well in the PCR plate and the plate transferred to the ELISA hood (Figure 2B).A volume of 100 µL of the diluted samples was transferred from the PCR plate to the coated and blocked ELISA plate, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before washing (3 × 250 µL).The ELISA plates were transferred to the ELISA workstation for the same workflow as the 384w plates with increased volumes of HRP solution (50 µL), wash buffer (3 × 250 µL), PBS rinse (250 µL), Turbo TMB-ELISA substrate (100 µL), and Stop solution (100 µL).Plates were transferred to the Victor Nivo reader and the absorbance of each sample read at 450 nm."
