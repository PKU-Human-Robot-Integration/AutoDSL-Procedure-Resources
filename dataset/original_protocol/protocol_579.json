    "1. Dilute 20X TE \\(Component B) 1:20 in RNase-free water to make 1X TE Buffer.\n  \n2. Make standards in microfuge tubes using the 100  μg/mL rRNA standard included in the Quant-It RiboGreen Assay Kit. These can be stored for future use.\n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/4061/original/SOP_Ribogreen_simplified_qPCR_machine_v2_concentration_standards.png?1447076904\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n3. Based on the expected concentrations of the samples, make the appropriate dilution of the RiboGreen reagent \\(Component A) in 1X TE \\(1:400 for samples between 2-100 ng/μL, 1:4,000 for samples between 0.05-1 ng/μL). You will need 20 μL of the diluted reagent for each sample and each standard.\n  \n4. Based on the expected concentrations of the samples, set up the assay plate with 1 μL each of the appropriate standards.\n  \n5. In each well, mix 1 μL of sample/standard with 19 μL of the appropriate dilution of the RiboGreen reagent. Pipet up and down to mix.\n  \n6. Read in a qPCR machine \\(use FAM/SYBR channel). Export raw fluorescence values. Draw the standard curve, and use the linear trend line to generate the formula to calculate the concentration for each sample."
