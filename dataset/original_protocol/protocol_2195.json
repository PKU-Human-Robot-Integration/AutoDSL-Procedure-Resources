Careful dissection of these fat depots is critical for the procedure. Follow Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1E for detailed identification of the fat pads.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1803-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Adipose tissue dissection from adult mice\n(A) Schematic of adipose tissue dissection in C57BL/6J mice (8–9 weeks old). Mouse is positioned ventral side up, with major white adipose tissue located caudal to the rib cage (R: rostral, C: caudal). White dotted lines represent the dissection scheme.\n(B) Subcutaneous adipose tissue depots (iWAT) are exposed after making skin incision and are bilaterally positioned beside the skeletal muscle (outlined by white dotted line).\n(B′) Closer view of iWAT with base of the major artery connecting the adipose tissue labeled to show where to make superficial cut into tissue.\n(C) Schematic of dissection of peritoneal layer of C57BL/6J mouse for eWAT extraction. White dotted lines represent the dissection scheme.\n(D) eWAT of male C57BL/6J mouse with gonads labeled for reference of location.\n(E) eWAT of female C57BL/6J mouse with uterus labeled for reference of location.\n(F) Isolated iWAT and eWAT from an adult male C57BL/6J mouse. Scale bar, 0.5 mm.\nEuthanize mouse – Follow general CO2 euthanasia procedure in accordance with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nExcise subcutaneous white adipose tissue depot.\nPlace 8–9 week-old C57BL/6J mouse (male or female) ventral side up and spray with 70% ethanol.\nMake a longitudinal midline incision from the base of the tail to top of the sternum, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nCritical: Be careful not to dissect the underlying peritoneal cavity at this point.",
    "Make a lateral incision to either side of the midline at the top of the sternum and use anatomical forceps or thumb to pull the skin apart.\nOnce the adipose tissue is exposed as shown in the Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, pin the skin to the dissection base.\nNote: Subcutaneous adipose tissue is bilaterally positioned around the skeletal muscle as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bʹ.\nUse a pair of anatomical forceps to hold the edge of the depot (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Bʹ). Make a superficial cut at the base of the large vessel that joins the tissue, and cut along the tissue boundaries, gently pulling the tissue away from the skin.\nOnce the tissue is completely detached from the skin, tap it on a Kimwipe to drain any interstitial fluid. Weigh the fat depot using a precision scale (0.2–3 grams range).\nExcise visceral white adipose tissue depot.\nMake a midline Y-shaped incision in the peritoneal cavity to expose the visceral organs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: The perigonadal adipose tissue is located just below the rostral starting point of the inguinal adipose tissue and can be visualized once the peritoneal cavity is cut open. For male mice, it is around the gonadal sac (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D); for female mice, it is around the uterus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCritical: Pay attention not to dissect parts of the uterus or gonads.\nUsing a pair of anatomical forceps, hold and cut the tissue along the anterior edge of the gonads or uterus. After dissection, repeat step 2f. Following dissection, adipose tissue should appear as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F.\nSetting up plate for glycerol and fatty acid estimation\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Following tissue dissections, set up the assay plate for glycerol and fatty acid release (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation is known to activate adipose tissue lipolysis (Greenberg et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Thus, we used the β3-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol to stimulate lipolysis in adipose tissue explants.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1803-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Plate layout for lipolysis assay and protein extraction\n(A) 24-well plate layout containing dissected iWAT (n=4 biological replicates) and eWAT (n=4 biological replicates) for glycerol and fatty acid estimation. Each well contains 50 mg of either iWAT or eWAT.\n(B) Before and after homogenization of 50 mg of adipose tissue in Lysing Matrix D tubes (2 mL) containing 1.4 mm diameter zirconium beads and 300 μL of adipose-lysis buffer.\n(C) Distribution of the fat layer, aqueous layer (lysate), and pellet in 1.5-mL tube after centrifugation of homogenized adipose tissue.\nTissue transfers.\nImmediately after dissection and weighing, transfer whole iWAT (∼350–500 mg) or eWAT (∼150–400 mg) adipose tissue into 15-mL centrifuge tubes containing 5 mL of pre-warmed KRBH buffer (w/o 2% BSA), pH 7.4.\nIncubate the tube in a laboratory oven or CO2 incubator as described in step 1 of ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’.\nRepeat steps 1–3 for each biological replicate.\nAfter dissecting the last animal, the next step is tissue trimming and setting up a 24-well plate for the assay.\nPlate set up and time course for glycerol and fatty acid release.\nTransfer the content of the 15 mL tube (step 4) into a sterile 15 cm tissue culture plate. Using a sterile scissor, cut 50 mg (approximately 0.5 mm3) of adipose tissue, and place it into one well of a 24-well plate containing 1 mL of pre-warmed KRBH buffer with 2% fatty acid free BSA (KRBH-BSA buffer).\nWhile trimming adipose tissue replicates, incubate the plate in laboratory oven (37°C).",
    "Following plate set up, aspirate medium from each well of the plate and replenish with KRBH-BSA buffer containing either vehicle (CTR) or isoproterenol (10 μM) (representative plate layout in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAfter 5 min of setting up the plate, collect 100 μL of medium (i.e., KRBH-BSA buffer) as a baseline. Replenish with 100 μL of the respective medium (with vehicle or isoproterenol). Incubate for 2 h at 37°C and collect 1 mL aliquot of the incubation medium.\nIncubate baseline and 2 h media aliquots at 65°C for 10 min to overcome residual enzymatic action in the released media.\nNote: It is recommended to set up the reaction plate close to the incubator or oven to minimize time loss during the dissection and incubation.\nWash the tissue chunks in the 24-well plate using 1 mL of 1× PBS, and store the tissue at −80°C after discarding PBS.\nPause point: Samples can be assayed for glycerol and fatty acid right away or later. In the case of assaying later, samples should be stored at −80°C.\nGlycerol estimation\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nGlycerol released in the media is estimated using a glycerol assay kit (Abcam) by a colorimetric method[href=https://www.abcam.com/ps/products/133/ab133130/documents/ab133130%20Glycerol%20Assay%20Kit%20(Cell-Based)%20v3a%20(website).pdf].\nAlternatives: Free glycerol reagent (Sigma, Cat #F6428) or free glycerol assay kit (Abcam, Cat #ab174092) can be used for colorimetric or fluorometric detection, respectively.\nCritical: Assay reagents may be hazardous (may cause eye irritation and asthma if inhaled). Refer to the safety data sheet for use. Wear protective eyewear and gloves at all times while handling the reagents.\nThaw samples stored at −80°C and glycerol reagent stored at −20°C at 20°C–25°C for 30 min protected from light.\nPrepare a range of glycerol standards (e.g., 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.6, 7.81, 3.90, 1.95 and 0 μg/mL) in distilled (d)H2O.",
    "Note: Glycerol standards can be prepared in either PBS or dH2O. Before testing all the samples, run a trial assay to determine if the glycerol levels in the media are within the standard range of the assay. Adjust the standard range if required.\nIn a clear 96-well plate, add 50 μL of either sample or standard plus 100 μL of the glycerol reagent in duplicates. Mix well by shaking on a horizontal shaker for 15 s. Cover the plate using aluminum foil.\nIncubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCollect absorbance at 540 nm using a standard UV-visible spectrophotometric plate reader capable of end-point absorbance analysis.\nNote: It is highly recommended to continue with the fatty acid estimation after this to avoid freeze-thaw cycles of the glycerol-fatty acid sample. If a break is unavoidable, samples should be stored at 4°C protected from light, and fatty acids can be assayed the following day.\nFree fatty acids estimation\nTiming: 2 h\nReleased free fatty acids in the media are estimated using a free fatty acid kit (Sigma) by a fluorescence-based method[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/128/465/mak044bul.pdf].\nAlternatives: WAKO-NEFA-HR(2) free fatty acid kit (Fujifilm, Cat# 999-34691 and 999-34891) can be used for colorimetric detection.\nCritical: Assay reagents may be hazardous (may cause eye irritation and asthma if inhaled). Please refer the safety data sheet for use. Wear protective eyewear and gloves at all times while handling the reagents.\nSample and standard preparation.\nThaw samples following step 6.\nPrepare a range of standards. Prepare a 0.1 nmol/μL palmitic acid standard solution by diluting the stock solution to 10 times using the assay buffer provided in the kit in a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube. In a black solid bottom 96-well plate add 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 μL of the diluted standard solution generating a 0.2–1 nmol/well concentration.",
    "Critical: Wrap the tube using aluminum foil to protect it from light at all times.\nDilute samples 1:1 using the assay buffer (e.g., 50 μL sample + 50 μL assay buffer). Add 5 μL of the diluted sample to the plate.\nFor standards, add 50, 48, 46, 44, 42 and 40 μL of assay buffer; for samples, add 45 μL of assay buffer to bring the final volume to 50 μL.\nAdd 2 μL of ACS reagent (Acetyl CoA Synthetase enzyme mix) to each well of sample and standard solutions and incubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nMix well by shaking on a horizontal shaker for 15 s. Cover the plate using aluminum foil.\nAssay.\nMaster reaction mix composition is provided below for each reaction (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Calculate the amount of master mix required based on sample number and technical replicates and prepare it accordingly.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1803_3.csv\nTo 50 μL of either sample or standard, add 50 μL of the master mix in duplicate. Cover the plate using aluminum foil to prevent light exposure. Mix well by shaking on a horizontal rocker for 15 s.\nCritical: It is critical to use black plates with a solid bottom for this assay if using a microplate reader that has top detection capability. Otherwise, use black plates with a clear bottom.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nMeasure fluorescence intensity at an excitation maximum of 535 nm and an emission maximum of 590 nm using a multimode plate reader that can measure fluorescence intensity under standard conditions.\nProtein extraction and estimation from adipose tissue\nTiming: 2.5–3 h\nTissue homogenization.\nThaw 24-well plate containing adipose tissue samples on ice for 30 min.\nAdd tissue samples into labeled and pre-chilled DNAse-RNAse free Lysing Matrix D tubes (2-mL) that contain zirconium beads of 1.4 mm diameter.",
    "Alternatives: Safe-Lock tubes (2.0 mL, Eppendorf, Cat #022363352; 1.5 mL, Eppendorf, Cat #022363204), Stainless Steel Beads, 5 mm (Qiagen, Cat #69989). If using the Qiagen beads, one 5 mm bead/2-mL tube is sufficient (An et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nAdd six volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (e.g., for 100 mg of tissue, add 600 μL of lysis buffer), supplemented with protease and phosphate inhibitor for each sample. Lysis buffer can be stored up to 12 months at −20°C in aliquots of 10 mL.\nHomogenize the samples in a bullet blender homogenizer for 5 min at maximum speed.\nNote: The sample will appear milky at the end of homogenization (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTransfer the tissue homogenate to clean pre-chilled 1.5-mL tubes.\nCentrifuge the samples at 13,523 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nAfter centrifugation three different layers are observed, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C.\nLysis and separation.\nUsing a 23-gauge needle or a gel-loading fine tip, carefully penetrate the fat layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C), collect the aqueous supernatant, and transfer into clean pre-chilled 1.5-mL tubes.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min and sonicate for 10 s using a hand-held sonicator set at 80% amplitude.\nCentrifuge at 13,523 g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the aqueous supernatant into clean pre-chilled 1.5-mL tubes.\nRepeat steps 16c and 16d two more times to maximize extraction of the lipid content.\nStore the samples at −80°C until protein estimation.\nProtein estimation.\nThaw samples on ice for 20 min.\nDilute samples to 10 times using dH2O.\nAdd 5 μL of samples and 200 μL of BCA reagent mix prepared freshly (1 part of Reagent A: 50 parts of Reagent B, e.g., to 5-mL of Reagent A, add 100 μL of Reagent B; mix well by vortex before use).\nIncubate the samples at 37°C for 30 min.",
    "Measure absorbance at 562 nm.\nCalculate the appropriate concentration of protein in the lysate against a BSA standard (0–2 mg/mL).\nGlycerol and fatty acid quantitation and normalization\nFor glycerol (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, 3E, and 3F):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1803-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Multiply it by two (dilution factor, as the sample was originally diluted to half).\nDivide the value by five (5 μL is sample volume/well.).\nNormalize the value in step 20c to the respective protein concentration of the sample estimated earlier.\nFree fatty acid levels will be expressed as nmol/mg protein.\nAlternatives: Glycerol and fatty acids can also be normalized using the dry weight of the sample or by total lipid content of the sample (Girousse et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).",
    "Critical: We recommend to confirm functional viability of the adipose tissue under the experimental conditions described above. To do so, treat additional iWAT (50 mg) or eWAT with vehicle (CTR) or insulin (100 nM) in a 24-well plate containing KRBH-BSA buffer while running steps 5a–e and incubate at 37°C for 2 h. At the end of the incubation period, collect the adipose tissue and homogenize it as described in steps 15 and 16. Fractionate a portion of the lysate (e.g., 20 μg total protein) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transfer (300 mAmp for 3 h) the separated proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad). To confirm equal loading and transfer of the samples, stain the membrane with Ponceau S (MilliporeSigma). After blocking at 20°C–25°C with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) in TBST for 1 h, probe the membrane with a rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) (1:1000). Depending on the phospho-antibody manufacturer recommendations, 5% (w/v) BSA in TBST may be used as an alternative blocking solution. Insulin activates the Akt pathway in a biochemically active adipose tissue as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Use a rabbit monoclonal anti-Akt (pan) (1:1000) for protein-loading control. Densitometry analysis can be performed using ImageJ (National Institute of Health). After subtracting the background, measure the intensity of phospho-Akt bands at 60 kDa and normalize it to the loading control (e.g., total-Akt). We recommend using three to four biological replicates for each experimental condition.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1803-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
