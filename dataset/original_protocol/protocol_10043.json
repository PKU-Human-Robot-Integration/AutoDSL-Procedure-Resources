    "1. Setting up the microscope, lasers and alignment tools\nBefore building the microscope, prepare all the necessary components including optics, optomechanics and electronics as listed in Table of Materials.\nPrepare a microscope body mainly composed of two parts: an objective holder with an RMS-threaded port and a piezo-stage mounted on an aluminum block (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: The custom-made microscope body is used for the convenience and flexibility of instrumentation12. Any commercially available microscope body can be used for HIST microscopy.\nCombining multiple laser lines and coupling them to a single mode fiber\n\t\nInstall 405, 561, 638 nm lasers onto the optical table and combine the beams through a polarizing beam splitter and a long-pass dichroic mirror as shown in Figure 1B. Make sure that all laser beams pass through pinholes on the alignment tool. Insert half wave plates for power adjustment.\n\t\tNOTE: Wear safety goggles for eye protection and use beam-blocks to absorb unwanted laser beams.\nInstall a fiber coupling lens (f = 4.5 mm) and a fiber adapter held in z-axis translator with a cage system.\nConnect a multimode fiber (MMF, Ø 62.5 µm) to the fiber adapter. Adjust each pair of the steering mirror and the z-translator until the coupling efficiency of each laser is higher than 95%. The output beam has a near Gaussian-shaped profile with speckle patterns.\nTake away the multimode fiber and connect a single mode fiber (SMF). Similar to MMF, fine-tune and maximize the coupling efficiency of three lasers.",
    "Assemble a collimated light source that will be used for beam alignment in the excitation and detection paths. This device is composed of a temporally coherent light source (561 nm) connected to SMF, fiber adapter, achromatic lens (f = 60 mm), iris and Ø1\" tube spacer in a cage system (Figure 1C). Adjust the distance between the fiber adapter and the lens using a shearing interferometer to ensure the collimation.\nPrepare a beam alignment tool (Figure 1D). This is a pair of aluminum posts with pinholes at 2\" height from the surface of optical table, which allows for quick and precise beam alignment.\nAssemble a double pinhole system which consists of two Ø1\" ground glass alignment disks at each end and two Ø1\" lens tubes (the bottom one is slotted) as shown in Figure 1E.\n2. Setting up the detection path\nTake out the objective and install the collimated light source. Adjust the knobs of the mirror (M1) beneath the objective holder so that the output beam from the microscope is roughly parallel to the optical table in height and aligned with threaded holes on the table. Refer to Figure 2 for detailed positions of each optical component.\nInsert a multiband dichroic mirror (DM) and reflect the beam by 90 degrees. Use the maximum size of the iris and make sure that the beam passes through the center of the dichroic mirror without clipping.\nUse the leaky beam passing through the dichroic mirror to guide the alignment of detection path. Place an sCMOS camera into the beam and make sure that the beam hits the center of the camera chip by using two mirrors (M2 and M3).\nInsert a tube lens (TL; f = 300 mm) approximately 300 mm away from the camera.",
    "Remove the collimated light source and adjust the relative distance between the tube lens and the camera until a pattern on the ceiling is clearly resolved by the camera.\nInsert a multi-band pass filter (BF) before the tube lens for multi-color fluorescence imaging.\n3. Setting up the excitation path\nReinstall the collimated light source on the objective holder. Place a fold-mirror (M4) to redirect the beam output from the microscope by 90 degrees. Adjust the knobs of the dichroic mirror and the fold-mirror iteratively until the beam passes through pinholes in the beam alignment tool.\nDetach the collimated light source and install it on the table, in which the beam points towards the microscope body. Align the beam using a beam alignment tool and a double pinhole system.\nInsert a lens L4 (f = 400 mm; Ø = 2\") to the optical path approximately 400 mm away from the objective holder. Install the objective lens and adjust the position of L4 along the optical axis until a perfect Airy disk pattern is formed on the ceiling.\n\tNOTE: When inserting the lens, the beam position passing through the lens should be kept unchanged. The lens L4 has a SM2 thread that allows it to be attached/detached from the 60 mm SM2-threaded cage plate easily.\nUnscrew the objective and reinstall the collimated light source with an open iris. Trace down the beam output from the microscope with a business card. Mount a mirror M5 at the place where the size of beam is the smallest and approximately 400 mm away from L4, which is a conjugated image plane (cIP).\nInstall a mirror M6 and reflect the beam by 90 degrees. Adjust M5 and M6 iteratively with the beam alignment tool.",
    "Insert a lens L3 (f = 150 mm) roughly 150 mm away from M5. Use a shearing interferometer to ensure the collimation of the output beam.\nTemporarily take away L4 and trace down the beam to find the focal position of L3. Put a single axis galvo mirror at this point, which is a conjugated back focal plane (cBFP). Supply 0 volts to the galvo mirror and rotate the holder of the galvo mirror so that it reflects the beam by 90 degrees.\nPlace a fold-mirror M7. Properly place L2 (f = 100 mm) the same way as step 3.6.\nRemove the collimated light source from the object holder. Install a collimation lens L1 (f = 100 mm), fiber adapter and iris. Connect a single mode fiber to the adapter and send the beam through the imaging system.\nReinsert L4 and fine tune the system until a perfect Airy disk pattern appears on the ceiling.\n4. Setting up the cylindrical lenses\nInsert a cylindrical lens (CL1, f = 400 mm) after L1 and make sure that the cylindrical lens focuses the beam along the x-axis.\nInsert another cylindrical lens (CL2, f = 50 mm) to the beam path. Use a shearing interferometer to ensure the output beam is collimated.\n\tNOTE: The distance between the two cylindrical lenses is 450 mm. The output beam has a compression ratio of 8 and an elongated oval shaped Airy disk pattern is formed on the ceiling.\n5. Testing tile imaging",
    "Prepare 3D hydrogel sample. Mix 20 nm Crimson beads with a hydrogel solution, which consists of 12% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1), 0.2% (v/v) TEMED and 0.2% (w/v) ammonium persulfate in 0.75x TAE buffer. Inject 50 µL of the mixed solution into a flow chamber as described elsewhere11. After 10 min, the 3D hydrogel sample is ready to for imaging.\nPut the sample onto the sample holder. Turn on 638 nm laser and adjust the power to <1 mW for sample excitation.\nRun the camera control software. In the camera acquisition-setting panel, select Internal in trigger mode and then click Take video for free running mode.\nSlightly adjust the position of the camera so that the image is located at the center of the camera when 0 volts is applied to the galvo mirror.\nRotate the horizontal knob of the mirror M5 to achieve a highly inclined illumination.\n\tNOTE: With the increase of the illumination angle, the hydrogel image becomes clearer than that of the Epi image as the beam gets thinner. However, the image keeps almost the same position.\nRecord the tile image. Calculate the effective illumination width11. For example, Figure 3 shows the effective illumination width of 12 µm.\n6. HIST imaging\nPrepare a data acquisition board connected with a terminal block. Connect USER 1 BNC connector with P0.0 through an electrical wire. Use USER 1 as a digital output for the external triggering of sCMOS camera. Connect an analog output AO0 to a galvo mirror driver.\nGenerate TTL pulse trains from P0.0 using a custom-made program (Figure 4A) and set the period time = 400 ms and t_ON = 2 ms. Check the generated pulses from USER 1 BNC terminal by a digital oscilloscope and then connect the BNC cable to the camera external trigger port.",
    "NOTE: The control software used in this paper is available upon request. When imaging at different camera frame rates, the period time should be adjusted accordingly.\nStart sweeping a galvo mirror via the custom-made program. Adjust Vmin to -500 mV and Vmax to 500 mV for full FOV imaging. Note that under this operation, 3D hydrogel samples still show high background similar to Epi illumination.\nChanging the camera acquisition setting.\n\t\nSelect External in trigger mode and Down (Sequential) in LightScan Plus drop-down menu as shown in Figure 4B.\n\t\tNOTE: In this setting, the camera does not take images unless a trigger signal is turned on.\nClick Scan Speed Control for window height and line exposure time control and set the values to be 180 rows and 28 ms, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: When a tile width (Weff) is 180 rows (12 µm) and an integration time per line (Tint) is 28 ms, a delay time between lines (TD) is determined as TD = Tint/Weff = 0.156 ms. For imaging 2,048 x 2,048 pixels, the total acquisition time is 2,048 x TD + Tint = 346 ms, corresponding to ~2.9 fps.\nSlightly adjust Vmax and Vmin to obtain clearer images.\nObtain 3D stack images using the custom-made program by switching on 3D stack ON and specifying the number of stacks and the step size."
