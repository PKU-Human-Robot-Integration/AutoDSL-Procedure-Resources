    "All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Chancellor's Animal Research Committee at the University of California, Los Angeles. All mice were housed with food and water available ad libitum in a 12 h light-dark environment. All animals were healthy with no obvious behavioral changes, were not involved in previous studies, and were sacrificed during the light cycle. Data for experiments were collected from adult mice (6-8 weeks old for all experiments).\n1. Preparation of K+ selective microelectrodes\nSilanization of borosilicate glass\n\t\nRemove sufficient glass capillaries from packaging and place into a 50 mL conical tube. Fill conical tube to top with 1 M HCl. Wash electrodes with gentle agitation in HCl overnight or for a minimum of 6 hours.\nBriefly rinse capillaries with 70% ethanol and then dry completely at 100-120 °C for 6-8 hours. Store washed capillaries in containers with anhydrous calcium sulfate desiccant for up to 4 weeks before further use.\nPrior to silanization, pull capillaries to a fine tip using a microelectrode puller. The microelectrodes that we use are approximately 2-5 microns in diameter. Always handle washed capillaries with gloves, as oils from skin can interfere with silanization.\nPlace microelectrodes into a glass container so that the electrodes are elevated from the bottom to prevent tip breakage. Fix the microelectrodes to the container using autoclavable tape or similar adhesive tape.\nRemove approximately 0.5 mL of 5% dichlorodimethylsilane (DDS) silanization solution from its container using the nitrogen replacement method (see Figure 2). Fill a balloon with nitrogen gas and attach a syringe or tube and needle to the balloon. Insert the needle into the DDS container while drawing up DDS into a separate syringe via a longer needle.",
    "Apply the silanization solution dropwise to the tips of the pipettes and immediately cover. Place the container holding the microelectrodes with silanization solution into a pre-warmed (170-180 °C) laboratory oven for 10-12 hours or at 200-220 °C for 30 minutes\nAfter the incubation, turn off the oven and then remove the plate from the oven. Be careful when removing the plate from the incubator, as it is extremely hot. Place the plate on a bench at room temperature for 10-15 minutes to allow the glassware to cool.\nRemove the microelectrodes from the plate (using a razor blade or scalpel blade to cut the tape) and place them into a desiccant filled airtight container. Silanized microelectrodes kept free of moisture can be used for up to 1 week following silanization.\nPriming the electrodes\n\t\nPrepare a stock solution of K+ ionophore cocktail: 5% w/v valinomycin, 93% v/v 1,2-dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene, 2% w/v potassium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate11. This solution is a faint yellow color. Keep in an airtight, opaque container at room temperature. If properly stored this solution can last many months.\nPrepare a stock solution of 10 mM HEPES buffered 300 mM NaCl at pH 7.4. Fix the electrode into a clamp and backfill with the buffered NaCl using a 28G microfil tip connected to a syringe. Observe that the saline solution has reached the end of the microelectrode tip. Confirm that the microelectrode is free of large bubbles that could interfere with the flow of current.\nBreak the tip of the electrode to approximately 10-20 µm wide, using the blunt side of a scalpel or razor blade.",
    "Using a micropipette, apply a small droplet (~0.1 µl) of the K+ ionophore near the tip of the microelectrode. If the electrode has been properly silanized the droplet will be absorbed into the broken tip. Fill the electrode to 1-2 mm with the K+ ionophore, and remove excess using tissue paper.\n2. Calibration of K+ Selective Microelectrodes\nPreparation of calibration solutions\n\t\nPrepare solutions of various concentrations of KCl in equal osmolarity artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) by replacing NaCl with KCl. We used 0.1, 1, 4.5, 10 and 100 mM K+ ACSF, for calibration of the electrodes. The recipes for these calibration solutions are listed in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\nChemical,MW,final mM,0.1 mM [K+],1 mM [K+],4.5 mM [K+],10 mM [K+],100 mM [K+]\nChemical,(g / mol),final mM,0.1 mM [K+],1 mM [K+],4.5 mM [K+],10 mM [K+],100 mM [K+]\nNaCl,58.44,varies,1.51 g,1.50 g,1.44 g,1.4 g,0.345 g\nKCl,1 M stock,varies,20 µl,200 µl,900 µl,2 ml,20 ml\nCaCl2,1 M stock,2,400 µl,400 µl,400 µl,400 µl,400 µl\nMgCl2,1 M stock,1,200 µl,200 µl,200 µl,200 µl,200 µl\nNaH2PO4,119.98,1.2,0.29 g,0.29 g,0.29 g,0.29 g,0.29 g\nNaHCO3,84.01,26,0.437 g,0.437 g,0.437 g,0.437 g,0.437 g\nD-Glucose,180.16,10,0.360 g,0.360 g,0.360 g,0.360 g,0.360 g\nWater,q.s. 200 ml,q.s. 200 ml,q.s. 200 ml,q.s. 200 ml,q.s. 200 ml,q.s. 200 ml,q.s. 200 ml\nTable 1. Potassium calibration solutions\nMicroelectrode calibration\n\t\nBubble all solutions with 95% O2/5% CO2 for at least 20 minutes before beginning the experiment. Begin perfusing the bath with 4.5 mM [K+] ACSF at a rate of 3 mL per minute. Place the K+ selective electrode into electrode holder attached to the electrode headstage on the manipulator. This headstage is connected to an appropriate amplifier. Insert the tip of the electrode into the bath perfusate.",
    "Ensure the Ag/AgCl ground electrode is bathed in the same solution and that the flow is steady. Apply calibration solutions in a stepwise fashion and record the potential changes in mV across the electrode tip. Wait for the potential at the electrode tip to reach a stable value before switching to the next solution\nMeasure the steady state voltage change in response to the application of the calibration solutions to the electrode tip. Confirm that the slope of the electrode response is at least 52 and no greater than 58 mV per log change in [K+].\n3. Preparation of Acute Hippocampal Brain Slices\nPreparation of slice solutions\n\t\nPrepare 500 mL sucrose cutting solution composed of: 194 mM sucrose, 30 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 10 mM D-glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, and 26 mM NaHCO3, 290-300 mOsm, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\nPrepare 1-2 liters of recording solution (ACSF) composed of: 124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, and 26 mM NaHCO3; pH 7.3 - 7.4 (after bubbling), 290 - 300 mOsm, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Fill a beaker containing a brain slice holder chamber with recording solution and keep it at 32-34 °C. Fill the vibratome chamber with ice-water slush.\nAcute slice preparation\n\t\nDeeply anesthetize a mouse by placing it in a bell jar precharged with 2-3 mL isoflurane. Check for toe pinch reflex, and if non-responsive, rapidly decapitate it using a pair of sharp shears or guillotine as your animal protocol requires.",
    "Make a 2-3 cm incision using shears from the caudal portion of the skull to cut the scalp along the midline. While manually retracting the scalp, make two 1 cm horizontal incisions from the foramen magnum along the sides of the skull. Then, using fine shears, cut an incision the length of the skull, along the midline from the back of the skull to the nose.\nUsing fine forceps inserted near the midline, retract the incised skull in two portions. Extract the mouse brain from the skull and use a blade to remove the cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, which are respectively located at the caudal and rostral portions of the brain. These can be identified by the large fissures, which separate them from the cortex.\nMount the brain block onto the vibratome tray using super glue. Fill the vibratome tray with ice cold cutting solution.\nCut tissue sections on the coronal plane at 300 µm thickness. Usually 6 coronal hippocampal slices can be collected.\nAfter each section is cut, immediately transfer the slices to the slice holding beaker warmed to 32-34°C. Keep the sections at this temperature for 20 min before removing the beaker containing the sections and place this at room temperature for at least 20-30 minutes prior to recording.\n4. Measurement of Electrically Evoked K+ Dynamics\nSetting up the slice preparation\n\t\nGently place the brain slice in the bath using a Pasteur pipette and gently hold it in place with a platinum harp with nylon strings.",
    "Ensure the tips of the bipolar stimulating electrode are parallel to one another and are level with the plane of the slice. Slowly, over the course of 6-7 seconds, insert the electrodes into CA3 stratum radiatum approximately 40-50 µm deep to stimulate Schaffer collaterals. In coronal sections, CA3 can be approximately identified as the portion of the hippocampus proper lateral to the granule cell layer at the hippocampal genu, with the stratum radiatum falling medial and ventral to the pyramidal cell layer.\nCarefully insert the K+-selective electrode into CA1 stratum radiatum approximately 50 µm deep, by slowly lowering the electrode over approximately 3-4 seconds. Allow the potential to stabilize across the electrode before applying stimulations to the slice: this usually takes 5 to 10 minutes. If the slice exhibits spontaneous changes in extracellular K+ then discard and repeat this process with a new slice.\nMeasure evoked K+ release\n\t\nApply trains of electrical stimulation (8 pulses) by manually depressing the trigger on the stimulator while digitally recording responses. Apply stimulation at 10 Hz and 1 ms pulse width, starting at 10 µA stimulus amplitude.\nApply increasing stimulation amplitudes by a factor of 2 until a maximum K+ response amplitude is detected. If you do not see any response, move the position of the K+ electrode closer to the stimulation site in 100 µm in increments\nDetermine the stimulus amplitude that produces the half maximal response. In our experience, this is between 40-160 µA, depending upon the preparation quality, age of the animal, and the distance between stimulation electrodes and K+ selective electrode.",
    "In the same slice, using a stimulus amplitude at one step lower than the amplitude that produces the half maximal response (e.g. if 80 µA produces a half-maximal response, use 40 µA) apply stimulus trains of increasing number of pulses. Initially, we have used trains of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 pulses.\nTo confirm that K+ signals are mediated by action potential firing of the electrically stimulated Schaffer collaterals bath, apply 0.5 µM TTX in ACSF for 10 minutes and repeat the stimulation protocol. No evoked responses should be observed.\nAfter finishing the slice experiment, confirm the electrode has maintained its responsivity by re-calibrating the electrode in the calibration solutions and ensuring the response has not deviated by more than 10% from the initial calibration\nSubscription Required.
