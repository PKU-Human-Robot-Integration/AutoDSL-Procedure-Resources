Loosen the cap on the Falcon tube to ensure proper aeration during growth.\nIncubate in an orbital shaker with rotation at 200 rpm at 30°C for 7–8 h.\nIn the evening of the same day, measure the OD600 of the preculture. It should be mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.1–0.3).\nPrepare liquid culture for mCAD.\nCalculate the amount of the pre-culture needed to generate a mid-log phase culture (∼0.5–1 × 107 cells/mL, or OD600 = 0.1–0.3) after propagation overnight (8–16 h). For SC media, the doubling time is roughly 2 h. The volume (V) of pre-preculture is calculated by the formula listed below:\nFinal \nO\nD\n600\n×\n25\n ml\n=\nPreculture \nO\nD\n600\n×\n2\ng\nr\no\nw\nt\nh\nt\ni\nm\ne\n/\nd\no\nu\nb\nl\ni\nn\ng\nt\ni\nm\ne\n×\nV\nInoculate 25 mL of SC medium in a 100 mL sterile shake flask with the appropriate amount of the pre-culture.",
    "Note: The doubling time of wild-type yeast cells in SC liquid media is typically 2 h. To obtain 25 mL mid-log phase culture (OD600 = 0.2) after a 16-h (overnight) incubation, add 65 μL of a pre-culture (OD600 = 0.3) to 25 mL SC.\nF\ni\nn\na\nl\n0.2\nO\nD\n600\n×\n25\nm\nl\n=\n0.3\nO\nD\n600\n×\n2\n8\n×\nV\no\nl\nu\nm\ne\nGrow at 30°C with orbital shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h.\nBiotinylation of mid-log phase progenitor cells\nTiming: 10 h\nBelow, we describe a protocol to biotinylate the cell wall of mother cells and their associated buds from the mid-log phase culture prepared as described above. Daughter cells generated from biotinylated yeast will not have biotin on their surface. Biotinylated progenitor cells are isolated using streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads.\nAllow EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin, which is stored at −20°C, to come to 20°C–22°C.\nWeigh 2 mg of Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin and dissolve it in 0.5 mL of PBS in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Rotate the tube at 20°C–22°C until the biotin is fully dissolved (5–10 min).\nNote: Adjust the amount of Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin based on the OD600 of cells. For >4 OD600 of cells, use 0.5 mg Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin per 1 OD600 of cells.\nNote: Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin is moisture-sensitive. Seal the cap of the jar containing the Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin with parafilm and store it in a sealed container with desiccant at −20°C. Keep the Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin container sealed and within the dessicant-containing storage container when it is brought to 20°C–22°C to reduce moisture condensation.\nCritical: Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin does not readily dissolve in aqueous solution. Thus, cells should be transferred to the tube containing biotin-PBS solution to allow any residual undissolved Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin to dissolve during sample biotinylation.",
    "Measure the OD600 of the overnight pre-culture. Calculate the volume of culture corresponding to 4 OD600-mL (e.g., if the OD600 is 0.2, use 4/0.2 = 20 mL of culture). Transfer 4 OD600 of cells to a fresh 50 mL Falcon tube or a sterile SS34 centrifuge tube.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g in a Sorvall ST 16 centrifuge (or equivalent) for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Remove supernatant carefully with a P1000 pipet.\nWash cells twice with 5 mL of 1× PBS containing 0.25% PEG3350.\nAdd 5 mL 1× PBS containing 0.25% PEG3350 to the Falcon tube and resuspend cells thoroughly.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation and remove supernatant as in step 9.\nRepeat steps 10a–b.\nResuspend final cell pellet in 0.5 mL of 1× PBS.\nAdd resuspended cells to biotin solution from step 7.\nRotate the biotin-cell mixture in an orbital mixer for 30 min at 20°C–22°C.\nConcentrate biotin-treated cells by centrifugation at 3,600 × g in a microcentrifuge for 1 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nWash cells once with 1 mL of 1× PBS containing 100 mM glycine. The glycine quenches any residual Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin.\nAdd 1 mL of 1× PBS containing 100 mM glycine to the cell pellet obtained in step 14.\nRepeat steps 13–14.\nWash cells twice with 1 mL of 1× PBS containing 0.25% PEG3350 as described in step 15.\nResuspend biotin-labeled cells in 1 mL of growth media (SC).\nTransfer resuspended cells to 500 mL of SC media in a 2-L sterile shake flask.\nGrow cells at 30°C with orbital shaking at 200 rpm for 8–14 h. Cells should be in the mid-log phase and the culture should not exceed OD600 = 0.3.",
    "Note: Calculate how much time is required to propagate biotin-labeled cells to the desired density in step 19. We typically use 4 OD600-mL of cells for biotinylation, and obtain 50–100 OD600-mL of cells after propagating biotinylated cells in 500 mL SC for ∼10 h.\nHarvest biotin-labeled cells:\nSterilize surroundings and gloves with 70% ethanol. Use a Bunsen burner to maintain a sterile environment.\nTransfer the 500 mL of liquid culture to 10 50-mL Falcon tubes or the appropriate number of sterilized reusable centrifuge tubes/bottles.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g in a Sorvall ST 16 centrifuge (or equivalent) for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCarefully decant supernatant.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 2 mL of SC and pool all cell suspensions in a 50-mL Falcon tube. The total volume of the pooled cells should be 20 mL.\nCritical: When handling yeast cell culture, use sterile techniques (step 20a).\nIsolation of biotinylated progenitor cells using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads\nTiming: 2 h\nWash Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 3 times with growth media (SC).\nTransfer 108 μL of Streptavidin Dynabeads to a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 1 mL of SC and vortex for >30 s.\nPlace the tube in a magnetic test tube rack (e.g., DynaMag-2) for 1 min to immobilize magnetic beads.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 21b–d 2 times.\nNote: According to the manufacturer’s instructions, 0.9 μL of beads are used per 106 labeled cells. We typically start with 4 OD600-mL cells (1.2 × 108 cells) and use 108 μL of beads.",
    "Note: Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 auto-fluorescence upon illumination under conditions that excite GFP, which may interfere with weak green fluorophores. We did not encounter this issue in the budding polarity assay. However, to reduce interference by autofluorescence, the dynabeads can be photobleached before binding to yeast cells (Roth et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nCritical: Take steps to ensure that the area around the mCAD is sterile (steps 22–28).\nResuspend the washed Streptavidin Dynabeads in 0.5 mL of SC.\nTransfer resuspended beads to the biotinylated cell suspension in the 50-mL Falcon tube (step 20, “Biotinylation of mid-log phase yeast”).\nIncubate the 50 mL Falcon tube in a rotary mixer for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nPlace ring magnets between the middle and top tiers of a poxygrid rack suitable for 50 mL Falcon tubes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nTransfer cells to a sterile mCAD glass vessel. Place the vessel within ring magnets in the poxygrid tube rack and let stand for 5–10 min to ensure that magnetic streptavidin beads and their associated cells are immobilized.\nNote: The ring magnet and poxygrid test tube rack can be substituted with a magnetic test tube rack that holds 50-mL Falcon tube and has a magnet of sufficient strength for this application (e.g., DynaMag-50, Invitrogen).\nNote: To promote binding of the magnetic beads to the ring magnet, gently tap and rotate the glass vessel.\nCarefully remove all material that is not bound to the ring magnet using a 10-mL pipet.\nWash immobilized cells twice with SC.\nRemove the glass vessel from the ring magnets and add 40 mL of SC to the glass vessel.\nPlace the glass vessel back into the ring magnets. Let stand for 5–10 min and then carefully remove media from the glass vessel using a 10-mL pipet.\nRepeat steps 28a–b.",
    "Resuspend cells in 1–2 mL of SC media.\nNote: Association of biotinylated cells with magnetic streptavidin beads can be monitored by light microscopy (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] or 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1864-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The length of a mother cell is measured by straight line tool labeled with pink outline.\n(B) Screenshots of step 67 (c). A maximum projected view of the cell in (A).\nSetting up the mCAD\nTiming: 30 min for setting up; 3–4 days for running a typical aging study\nHere, we describe assembly of the mCAD and test running the assembled mCAD before inoculating beaded progenitor cells to check for leaks. The mCAD should be assembled and filled with media before the progenitor cells are incubated with streptavidin-dynabeads and dynabead-bound cells are isolated. Dynabead-bound cells should be introduced into the mCAD immediately after isolation.\nNote: We operate the mCAD in at room temperature (20°C–22°C) in a temperature-controlled room. Since strong magnets are used in the mCAD, do not use heat blocks for temperature control.\nAssemble the mCAD (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nThe mCAD should be assembled on laboratory bench (ca 2.5 × 2.5 ft) that has a shelf above the bench for the air pump/pressure gauge assembly (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nWear gloves. Sterilize gloves and the bench with 70% ethanol. Use a Bunsen burner to maintain a sterile environment.\nPlace ring magnets between the middle and top tiers of a poxygrid tube rack suitable for 50 mL Falcon tubes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nRemove all aluminum foil and autoclave tape from sterilized mCAD components (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).",
    "Carefully open the sterile 2-L media bottle and add 2 L of sterile SC media. Place the GL45 cap and its associated tubing on the media bottle and tighten it.\nTighten the Teflon cap on the mCAD vessel and place the sterilized mCAD vessel into the ring magnets in the poxygrid rack. The ring magnets should be 1–2 cm below the top of the media level in the mCAD vessel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPlace the 2 L waste flask on a surface at least 1 ft (30.5 cm) below the bench to ensure that effluent media from the mCAD vessel flows into the waste flask. Insert the free end of the effluent tubing from the mCAD vessel into the waste flask and secure the tubing to the flask with tape.\nConnect the air filter on the 16″ tubing of media/air tubing on the mCAD vessel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) to the free end of the 10″ tubing on the air pump and gauge assembly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nConnect the female luer on the free end of the peristaltic pump tubing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) to the 2–10″ connector tubing on the media bottle (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nInsert the peristaltic pump tubing into the peristaltic pump such that media flows from the media bottle through the peristaltic pump into the mCAD vessel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nTighten the caps on the media bottle and mCAD vessel.\nTest the mCAD system.\nTurn on the peristaltic pump (∼250 mL/h, speed 7, flow rate x10 for a GE Healthcare peristaltic pump P-1) and air pump. Media should flow from the media bottle through the peristaltic pump to the mCAD vessel. After the mCAD vessel fills with ca 40 mL of media, media should flow from the mCAD vessel out the effluent port into the waste flask.",
    "After the mCAD is filled, set the flow rate to ∼ 25 mL/h (speed 7, flow rate x1.).\nCritical: Make sure that there are no leaks at connections or caps and that there is consistent positive pressure within the mCAD. If not, there will be no effluent and excess SC will leak from other parts of the set-up. When the system is set up correctly, the total volume of media in the mCAD vessel should be 40 mL.\nPrepare the mCAD for cell transfer.\nTurn off the air and peristaltic pumps. Clamp the effluent tubing with a tubing clamp.\nTransfer the mCAD vessel from the ring magnets in the poxygrid rack to a magnet-free location in the poxygrid rack.\nRemove the cap from the loading port on the mCAD vessel.\nUse a 1-mL syringe to transfer streptavidin beads and their associated biotinylated cells from the 50-mL Falcon tube (step 29) to the loading port. After the transfer, flush some air into the loading port using a sterile syringe to ensure that all cells are in the medium within the mCAD vessel.\nPlace the cap on the loading port.\nPlace the mCAD vessel into the ring magnets and let stand for 5–10 min to immobilize the magnetic beads and their associated biotinylated progenitor yeast cells.\nNote: Occasionally tapping and rotating the glass vessel or turning on the air pump at its lowest setting promotes circulation and binding of magnetic beads and their associated cells to the ring magnets in the mCAD vessel.\nRemove the clamp from the effluent tubing and ensure that the caps on the media bottle and mCAD vessel are tight closed.\nTurn on the air and peristaltic pumps.\nThe air pump should be set to its highest pressure (0.7–0.8 PSI).",
    "Set the flow rate on the peristaltic pump to ∼ 25 mL/h (For a GE Healthcare-peristaltic pump P-1: speed 7, flow rate x1.).\nLet the system run for 24–56 h. Check the system daily for leaks and ensure that there is sufficient media in the media bottle.\nNote: With a flow rate of 25 mL/hr, ∼600 mL of media is used each day. Thus, 2–2.5 L SC media is needed for a 3-day experiment.\nHarvest desired populations of yeast cells\nTiming: 1 h\nHarvesting daughter cells\nWhen harvesting the daughter cells, use a fresh 50-mL Falcon tube to collect young cells from the effluent tubing.\nHarvesting an aliquot of biotinylated mother cells from the mCAD\nTurn off both pumps. Clamp the effluent port with a tubing clamp.\nRemove the mCAD vessel from the ring magnet and swirl to resuspend cells in the media.\nRemove the cap from the loading port and tilt the vessel to submerge the needle tip of the loading port into the media. Use a 5- or 10-mL Luer-lock syringe to withdraw cells from the mCAD vessel.\nNote: The amount of culture drawn from mCAD depends on how many time points are needed in a time-course experiment. For a 3-day-long experiment, we recommend collecting 13 mL of cells on the first day, 20 mL on the second day, and 40 mL on the last day.\nTransfer harvested cells to a fresh sterile glass vessel. Insert the vessel into the ring magnets and allow the system to stand for 5–10 min.\nCarefully remove all material that is not bound to the ring magnet using a 10 mL transfer pipet.\nWash immobilized cells twice with 40 mL of SC.",
    "Remove the glass vessel from the ring magnets. Wash the walls of the glass vessel and resuspend cells in 1–2 mL of SC media.\nHarvesting all biotinylated cells from the mCAD\nCarefully remove the Teflon cap, tubing, and bubble cage from the mCAD glass vessel without disturbing cells that are immobilized within the vessel.\nRemove media from the mCAD glass vessel using a 10 mL pipet.\nRemove the ring magnets and resuspend cells in the glass vessel with 30 mL of SC media.\nPlace the glass vessel in the ring magnets and let stand for 5–10 min to immobilize biotinylated mother cells.\nRepeat steps 48–50 at least 4 times.\nResuspend washed cells in 1 mL of SC media.\nNote: The purity of the biotinylated mother cells can be monitored by staining with AlexaFluor-conjugated WGA and light microscopy (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). When the purity of the biotinylated mother cells is high, the majority (50%–70%) of cells recovered should be old cells.\nBud scar staining with AlexaFluor-conjugated WGA\nTiming: 3 h",
    "Budding yeast undergoes asymmetric cell division to produce progeny (mother and daughter cells) which are not identical. During this process, a bud site is selected on the surface of a mother cell, and the cytoskeleton is polarized to that site to ensure the transfer of all cellular constituents from the mother cell to the developing daughter cells. Bud site selection is one hallmark of cell symmetry breaking during polarity establishment in asymmetric cell division. In haploid yeast cells, which undergo axial or unipolar budding, new bud sites form adjacent to the bud site from the previous round of cell division (Chant and Pringle, 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The bud scar, a chitinous ring on the cell wall of the mother cell that forms where buds separate from mother cells, is both a landmark of bud site selection during polarity establishment in asymmetric cell division and a marker for the number of times a mother cell divides (i.e., replicative age). Here, we describe a method to determine the polarity of bud site selection during the yeast aging process by staining bud scars generated during consecutive rounds of cell division with two colors of AlexaFluor-conjugated WGA. This method is inspired by the TrackScar labeling technique (Maxwell and Magwene, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nTo monitor age-associated changes in cell polarity during asymmetric cell division, we monitor bud site selection in cells of defined replicative age isolated using the mCAD. Cells are initially stained with AlexaFluor 488-WGA to label all bud scars. They are then propagated for 1 round of cell division (2 h) and stained with AlexaFluor 594-WGA to label the 2 newest bud scars. For haploid cells, bud site selection is scored as polarized if the 2 newest bud scars are adjacent to each other, and random if those bud scars are not adjacent.",
    "Transfer 0.5–1 OD600-mL of isolated yeast cells in 1 mL of SC medium to a fresh 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd AlexaFluor 488-WGA (2 μL of 1.09 mM stock in 1 mL), mix and stain cells for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation at 3,600 × g in a microcentrifuge for 1 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nWash cell pellet 3 times with SC media.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of SC.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation at 3,600 × g in a microcentrifuge for 1 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nRepeat steps a-c 2 times.\nResuspend the washed cell pellet in 1 mL of SC.\nTransfer cells to a 50 mL Falcon tube and dilute cells to a final volume of 5 mL.\nGrow cells at 30°C with orbital shaking at 200 rpm for 2 h.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g in a Sorvall ST 16 centrifuge (or equivalent) for 5 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL SC.\nStain cells with AlexaFluor 594-WGA for 15 min, wash, and resuspend as for step 57.\nNote: Bud scars can be stained by blue-emission WGA-AlexaFlour 350 or far-red-emission WGA-AlexaFlour 647. However, WGA conjugated with different colors of AlexaFlour must be used for sequential staining. If replicative age is the only desired factor to measure, bud scars can be stained with calcofluor white (Pringle, 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nLive-cell imaging\nTiming: 3–4 h\nConcentrate stained cells by centrifugation at 3,600 × g for 1 min at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove supernatant, leaving 10–20 μL supernatant in the tube.\nResuspend the pellet in the residual medium.\nTransfer 1.8 μL of the cell suspension to a microscope slide, and cover with a #1.5 coverslip.",
    "Critical: For optimal imaging, cells must be resuspended in the appropriate volume of supernatant to ensure that cell density is low enough to distinguish individual budding yeast cells and high enough to capture 10–15 cells per image during image acquisition (ca 0.2–0.4 OD600 per mL or 3,000–6,000 cells per μL). Please refer to (Liao et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) for an illustration of the appropriate liquid: pellet ratio.\nCritical: Each slide should be imaged for 10 min or less. In the method described, cells are suspended in a small volume of medium (1.8 μL) for imaging; therefore, the preparation may dry out or nutrients may be exhausted by cells within a short period of time (∼10 min). For long-term imaging, cells can be mounted in a culture dish and covered by an agar pad, as described in (Liao et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nTo image bud scars, locate a field of cells and acquire a z-series using the following settings and excitation/emission filters:\nWGA-AlexaFluor 488: excitation/emission 470/507 nm, 50% power, typical exposure time: 300 ms.\nWGA-AlexaFluor 594: excitation/emission 561/610 nm, 50% power, typical exposure time: 300 ms.\n1 × 1 binning (If the camera chip has sufficient pixels, 2 × 2 binning may be used. Final pixel dimensions should be < 0.1 μm.).\n21–27 z sections with 0.3 μm spacing (a total depth of 6–8 μm should be sufficient to capture the entire cell for young yeast cells. Since yeast cells increase in size with age, the number of optical sections per z-series should be increased for older cells.).\nAcquire AlexaFluor 594 and AlexaFluor 488 z-stacks sequentially for greater speed and stability.\nNote: Power settings and exposure times need to be adjusted based on signal intensity. We typically acquire 2–3 images per slide, and 5–6 slides per sample to image 100 cells.",
