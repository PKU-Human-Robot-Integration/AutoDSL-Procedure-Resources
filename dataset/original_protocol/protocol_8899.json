    "1. Preparation of Materials Required to Explant Third Instar Larval Brains\nPrepare tools required for microdissection.\n\t\nForge two dissecting tools (a scalpel and a hook) by first placing a single dissecting pin into each pin holder. Secure the pins tightly by hand or with pliers (Figure 1C).\nUse a pair of old forceps to bend one dissecting pin to an approximately 120° angle. Do this under a dissecting microscope to ensure that the top half of the pin lies flat when the pin holder is held in hand. This tool will be used as a scalpel to hold down or slice through tissue.\nUse a pair of old forceps to bend the second pin into a hook that will be used to hold and scrape away tissue.\nCover each dissecting tool with a pipette tip to protect the tools from damage. With care, well-formed tools may be used for dissection indefinitely. Replace damaged or deformed pins as necessary.\nPrepare dissecting medium.\n\t\nIn a tissue culture hood, dilute the antibiotic-antimycotic supplement into the Schneider’s culturing medium. Swirl the media to incorporate the supplement.\nPrepare several 5 ml aliquots of the supplemented media. Store all media at 4 °C until ready for use.\nWarm a 5 ml aliquot of supplemented medium to room temperature. Draw the medium into a sterile 5 ml syringe and screw on a sterile 0.2 µm syringe filter.\nSelect larvae for dissection. Use a dissecting probe to select crawling third instar larvae as the brain will be easiest to dissect. Optional: deposit larvae on a grape agar plate.\n\tNote: Do not use overly crowded vials or bottles with “wet food,” as these tend to force second or first instar larvae to crawl out prematurely.",
    "Note: Some genetic backgrounds will necessitate using younger larvae. This does not affect the protocol, but does make the dissection more difficult.\n2. Dissection of the Central Nervous System\nOn a single glass slide, create two 50 ml pools of warm dissecting media separated by about 3 cm. One pool will be used for gross dissection and other used for fine dissection (Figure 1C).\nTransfer several larvae to one of the media drops.\nMove the coverslip with larvae to a dissecting microscope. Zoom into the pool containing the larvae such that the anterior and posterior ends of the larvae are discernible.\nUse a pairs of forceps to grasp the mid-region of a single larva. Take a second pair of forceps in the other hand and grasp the larva close to the same region. Pull the two pairs of forceps apart to gently tear the larva in half. Repeat the above two steps for all larvae on the coverslip.\nDispose of the posterior halves of the larval body by transferring them to a tissue.\nZoom into a larva so that the anterior mouthhooks are clearly visible. Use both pairs of forceps to create a small incision, or notch, on opposite sides of the larval mouthhooks between the third thoracic and first anterior denticle bands.\nGrasp the mouthhooks with the forceps in the non-dominant hand. Use the forceps in the other hand to gently peel away cuticle in an anterior-to-posterior direction. Continue to slowly peel away cuticle until the central nervous system is exposed.\nIsolate the central nervous system from the rest of the larva by tearing tissues with the forceps. Use caution not to disturb the central nervous system.",
    "Critical step: Do not tug on the central nervous system! Discard damaged samples with a torn ventral nerve cord (Figure 2A) or distorted optic lobes (Figures 2B and 2B’).\nRepeat the above two steps for all larvae on the coverslip. Transfer the healthy explanted tissue to the second (clean) pool of medium on the coverslip for the fine dissection stage.\nUse the dissecting pin tools to clear away the peripheral tissues (e.g., eye, wing, and leg discs) from the brain. Slide the scalpel between the wanted (brain) and the unwanted tissue, pinning the connective tissue to the coverglass. Use the hook to gently tease away the undesired tissue while simultaneously pressing the scalpel to the coverslip in saw-like movements.\nCritical step: Work slowly and deliberately to remove all discs from each brain. Use caution not to disturb the brain morphology. A healthy brain will have an intact ventral nerve cord and symmetric, round optic lobes (Figure 2C).\n3. Mounting Explanted Brains for Live Imaging\nInvert a 50 mm gas-permeable culture dish with the clear film facing up (Figure 2D). Depress the syringe to deposit a small drop (about 30 µl) of medium onto the center of the dish.\nTransfer the isolated brains, one at a time, to the drop of medium on the dish. Use the hook tool to scoop up a brain underneath the optic lobes. Alternatively, use forceps to grasp axons projecting from the ventral nerve cord.\nCollect 5-10 brains in the drop of medium. Submerge the brains by using the dissecting pin tools to push individual brains to the bottom of the drop of medium as many of them will be trapped at the meniscus (Figure 2E).",
    "Orient the brains using the dissecting pin tools to align brains depending on the NBs to be imaged (Figure 3A). To image the dorsal NBs, place the ventral nerve cord facing down (along the membrane). To image the anterio-ventral NBs, place the brains with the ventral nerve cord facing upward (away from membrane). Align the brains such that all the ventral nerve cords point in the same direction within the x-y plane.\nUse a syringe or plastic transfer pipette to place 4 halocarbon (HC) oil drops (about 30 µl each) onto the gas permeable membrane. The volume of each drop of oil should be equivalent to each other and to the drop of medium. Space the drops of oil to correspond to the four corners of a coverslip centered around the drop of culturing medium. Once complete, the five drops (four drops of oil and one drop of medium in the center) will resemble the five facets on Western-style dice (Figure 3B).\nLower a #1.5 22 mm coverslip on the assembly such that it hits all 5 drops at the same time. Maintaining an even pressure across the samples reduces the likelihood that they will be disrupted. Wait about 3 min as the oil and medium disperse under the weight of the coverslip. A cross-like shape of media will form (Figures 3C and 3D).\nCritical step: Lower the coverslip onto the surface of the brains by removing excess media using a tissue paper wick (Figure 3C). Do this while watching the sample under the dissecting scope. As media is removed, the coverslip will lower. Stop once the coverslip touches the brains. Do not over-wick as this will cause tissue distortion or brain explosions.",
    "If imaging dorsal NBs (Figure 3E), move to step 3.9. If imaging anterio-ventral NBs, the coverslip must be slightly moved (by gently nudging it with forceps) in the direction of the ventral nerve cord tips. This causes the brain to rotate, which brings the brain lobes in direct contact with the coverslip to facilitate imaging (Figure 3F).\nSeal the chamber by encircling the coverslip with small amounts of halocarbon oil (Figure 3D). Excess oil oozing from the coverslip should be minimized and blotted away with a tissue.\n4. Live Imaging of Central Brain Neuroblasts\nNote: For this work, a Nikon Eclipse Ti spinning-disk confocal microscope (inverted microscope) was used for live imaging; details of our setup have been previously published31. Alternatively, the sample can be imaged using an upright system.\nAdd a drop of immersion oil to the coverslip just above the mounted brains. This will help center the objective directly above the sample.\nCritical step: Maintain brains at a constant temperature of 25 °C with a stage incubator. Gently position the mounted sample into the stage incubator and cover the chamber with its lid.\nLocate central brain NBs using transmitted light by focusing on the large, round cells that reside in the central and medial areas of the optic lobes; do not use epi-fluorescence. This becomes easier with practice. It is very important to expose the sample to the least amount of light as possible. Do not waste time imaging brains that are damaged.\nOnce in place, take quick exposures using the confocal to determine proper location and depth. Limit depth to the first 10-15 µm. Adjust as needed, and take another test image.",
    "Optional step: Collect a test movie of the ventral nerve cord to ensure there is no x-y drift. If drift is detected, wait 15-30 min for the sample to settle. If the drift does not settle in 30 min, prepare a new sample. Major drift can usually be traced back to the addition of excess oil, or the unequal size of oil drops during mounting.\nTo eliminate axial drift (z-drift) use a continuous automatic focusing device that uses an infrared LED. Alternatively, manually correct the focal plane.\nOnce a NB of interest is identified, proceed with imaging regimen. As with all live cell imaging, the amount of laser light, exposure time, camera binning, objective magnification, time and/or z-step interval must all be empirically optimized for a particular experiment to answer the question at hand. The goal is to minimize light damage while still collecting useful data. See discussion for additional guidance.\n\t\nImage the entire volume of the NB by collecting 12-14 images spaced by 1 µm in the z-axis. Adjust the time resolution to capture single or multiple cell cycles of the same NB. As a general guideline, use 10-30 sec intervals for single cell cycle imaging and 1-3 min intervals for multiple cell cycles.\nCritical step: Confirm that the sample is healthy by monitoring the duration of mitosis. If mitosis takes more than 15 min, move on to another brain. A healthy brain will show many NBs within the same field of view undergoing several rounds of mitosis. Note that each cell cycle is slightly longer than the previous one due to light damage.\nOnce imaging is complete, disassemble the incubation chamber, and discard everything but the gas-permeable culturing dishes. Rinse the culture dish surface with 95% ethanol and wipe well with a tissue. Repeat two more times.",
    "5. Preparation of Brains for Immunofluorescence\nCollect 20 or more explanted brains into a 1.5 ml tube containing approximately 0.2 ml of supplemented medium.\nRemove medium from the tube and rinse brains once with 0.5 ml PBSTx (Phosphate Buffered Saline, PBS, with 0.3% Triton X-100). Let brains settle to the bottom of the tube between all exchanges of liquid. The Triton X-100 detergent is used to permeabilize the tissue. Rinsing typically takes less than 30 sec; simply remove the PBSTx once brains have settled to the bottom of the tube.\nReplace the solution with 0.5 ml of 9% electron microscopy grade paraformaldehyde diluted in PBSTx. Incubate with nutation for 15 min at room temperature.\nDispose of fixative according to hazardous waste regulations.\nWash the samples with 0.5 ml PBSTx for 15 min. Repeat the wash step with fresh PBSTx two more times.\nReplace the solution with 0.5 ml PBT (PBS,1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), and 0.1% Tween-20). Incubate with nutation for 1 hr at room temperature. This step blocks the nonspecific binding of antibody to the tissue.\nReplace the solution with 0.5 ml primary antibody diluted in PBT supplemented with 4% normal goat serum (NGS). Incubate with nutation overnight at 4 °C.\nDiscard or save the diluted primary antibody.\nWash the samples with 0.5 ml PBT for 15 min. Repeat the wash step with fresh PBT two more times.\nReplace the solution with 0.5 ml of modified PBT (PBS, 2% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, and 4% NGS). Incubate with nutation for 1 hr at room temperature.\nReplace the solution with 0.5 ml secondary antibody diluted into modified PBT. Incubate with nutation for 2 hr at room temperature.",
    "Replace the solution with 0.5 ml PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20). Incubate with nutation for 15 min at room temperature. Repeat the wash step with fresh PBST two more times.\n6. Mounting Samples for Immunofluorescence\nCarefully transfer the samples as a drop on a glass slide, restricting the drop towards the left of the center of slide.\nAdd a large drop (about 2 cm in diameter) of mounting medium (for example, Aqua-Poly/Mount) to the center of the slide. Avoid the pool of PBST that is toward the left.\nUse forceps to transfer the brains from the pool of PBST to the pool of mounting medium. Adding mounting medium directly on top of the brains may disrupt their orientation and should be avoided.\nUnder a light microscope, arrange the samples in the mounting medium with the side that will be imaged facing up.\nWith the slide under the light microscope, slowly lower a #1.5 glass coverslip on top of the samples. Optional step: Dislodge minor air bubbles by lightly pushing on the coverslip.\nAllow the mounting medium to polymerize for several hours, or overnight, by lying slides flat, light-protected, at room temperature.\nSlides may be imaged the next day, or stored prior to imaging.\nSubscription Required.
