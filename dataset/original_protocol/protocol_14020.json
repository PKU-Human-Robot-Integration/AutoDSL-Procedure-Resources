  "procedures": [
    "1. Synthesis of Colored Azos\nIn a 25 mL round bottom flask (RBF), dissolve aniline (0.1 mmol) and primaquine bisphosphate (45.5 mg, 0.1 mmol) into 10 mL of H3PO4 solution (5% v/v). Put the RBF on an ice bath, add a stir bar with the proper size into the solution, and put the RBF on a stir plate.\nNOTE: For the synthesis of azo 3g (Figure 2), use 0.2 mmol of primaquine bisphosphate.\nDissolve NaNO2 (6.9 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 1 mL of cooled water and then add into the reaction mixture dropwise. Remove the ice bath, and keep the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature.\nMonitor the reaction with a silica gel coated thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate. Use a dichloromethane (DCM)/methanol (MeOH) mixture (vol/vol = 5:1) as the eluent for TLC. The azo product exhibits colored spots on the TLC plate, which is easy to distinguish by naked eyes. Stop the reaction when the PMQ spots disappear on TLC.\nAdjust the reaction mixture to pH >10 by NaOH (2 M) on an ice bath. Use a 50 mL separation funnel to extract the mixture 3 times with 20 mL of ethyl acetate for each, combine and concentrate the organic phase under vacuum using a rotary evaporator.\nNOTE: Before extraction, adjust the pH value of reaction solutions over 10. This can maintain the primary amine as its non-ionized form, thus facilitating extraction.\nPurify the residues by flash chromatography with reverse-phase silica gel under normal pressure, using MeOH/H2O as the eluent. Dry the product solution through lyophilization to give desired azo products.\nNOTE: The same reaction can also be performed in diluted HCl solutions (0.2 M).\n2. UV-Vis Measurements and Theoretical Calculation",
    "Dissolve pure azo (50 μM) in distilled water or in 5% H3PO4 solution (pH 1.1), respectively. Record UV-vis absorption spectra (250-700 nm) on a spectrophotometer at room temperature (25 °C). Export the data as .xls/.xlsx files for further analysis.\nPerform all theoretical calculations for PMQ itself and azo products using the Gaussian 16 program. Use time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with a 6-31G basis set. Include solvent effects by polarizable continuum model (PCM) formalism using water.\nUse software (e.g., Chemdraw Office) to draw the structures and then save the structure as a Gaussian input file (.gif).\nOpen the gif file with Gauss View and click the button Calculate. Select Gaussian Calculation Setup, Opt+Freq, and ground state-DFT-B3LYP-6-31G; then click Submit. The geometry optimization will generate a .log file.\nFollowing the procedure above, use Gauss View to open this log file. Click Calculate-Gaussian Calculation Setup and select energy and TD-SCF-DFT-B3LYP-6-31G-Singlet only. Then Submit. The energy calculation will generate another log file and a cube file.\nUse Gauss View to open the log file from the energy calculation. Click Results-UV/Vis to see the predicted absorption.\nUse Gauss View to open the cube file. Click Results and select surface and contours-surface actions and new surface to see the orbits.\nCompare the results from both experimental measurement and Gaussian calculation. Calculate the percent error between the calculated and measured values, according to the following equation.\n              Error = | (Wmax cal.-Wmaxexper.)/ Wmaxexper. | × 100%\n\twhere Wmax cal. represents the maximum absorbance wavelength from theoretical calculation and Wmax exper. represents the wavelength from experimental result.\n3. PMQ Determination\nPMQ measurement using a 96-well plate (Figure 5)",
    "Dissolve 4-methoxyaniline in 0.2 M HCl for a 200 mM aniline solution, R1. Dissolve sodium nitrite in distilled water to obtain a 5 mM solution, R2. Keep all the solutions in the fridge at 4 °C before use.\nAdd 100 µL of R1 into a 96-well plate, and add 50 µL of PMQ containing sample into the plate to mix with R1. Then, add 50 µL of R2 into the plate. Mix the solutions by repeated pipetting.\nKeep the plate at room temperature for 15 min, and then record the UV-vis absorbance at 504 nm. Repeat 3x for each test.  The azo product is stable with room light exposure; it not necessary to keep the plate under dark.\nExport the data as .xls/.xlsx files for further analysis.\nCalibration curve for direct PMQ measurement in a urine sample\nPrepare PMQ solutions using synthetic urine with PMQ concentrations at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 μM, respectively.\nAdd 100 µL of R1 into a 96-well plate, and add 50 µL of PMQ urine solution to mix with R1. Then, add 50 µL of R2 to the above mixture. Mix the solutions by repeated pipetting. Keep the plate at room temperature for 15 min, and then record the UV-vis absorbance at 504 nm.\nGenerate a calibration curve based on the absorbance I504 and PMQ concentrations. Use the values from the wells without PMQ as a blank, and subtract the blank values from all tests before data processing.\nPerform a linear fit to generate the linear equations as Y = aX+b, where Y is the absorbance intensity at 504 nm, X is the concentration of PMQ, a is the slope, and b is the y-intercept of the linear line.\nCalibration curve for direct PMQ measurement in a human serum sample",
    "Prepare PMQ solutions using human serum with PMQ concentrations at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, μM respectively.\nAdd 100 µL of R1 into a 96-well plate and add 50 µL of PMQ serum solution to mix with R1. Add 50 µL of R2 to the above mixture and mix the solutions by repeated pipetting. Keep the plate at room temperature for 15 min and then record the UV-vis absorbance at 504 nm. Export the data as .xls/.xlsx file for further analysis.\nGenerate a calibration curve based on the absorbance I504 and PMQ concentrations. Use the values from the wells without PMQ as a blank, and subtract the blank values from all tests before data processing.\nPerform a linear fit to generate the linear equations as Y = aX+b, where Y is the absorbance intensity at 504 nm, X is the concentration of PMQ, a is the slope, and b is the y-intercept of the linear line.\nPMQ extraction from serum\nAdd a certain amount of PMQ into human serum to simulate PMQ-containing serum. For PMQ extraction, add 6 mL of mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane (7:1 v/v) into 2 mL of PMQ-containing serum in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 100 µL of sodium hydroxide (2 M) solution to the extraction system. Violently shake the tube using a vortex mixer for 30 s. Collect the organic layer and concentrate it using a rotary evaporator under vacuum.\nRedissolve the residue with 200 µL of distilled water and remove insoluble lipid components by filtration through a disk-shaped membrane with 220 nm pore size. Use the final solution for test.\nDetermine PMQ from the serum with extraction",
    "Follow steps 3.2 or 3.3 to generate the calibration curve for PMQ in distilled water. Extract PMQ from PMQ-containing serums according to step 3.4.\nAdd 100 µL of R1 and 50 µL of PMQ solution into a 96-well plate. Add 50 µL of R2 to above mixture, and mix the solutions by repeated pipetting.\nKeep the plate at room temperature for 15 min and record the UV-vis absorbance at 504 nm. Use the wells with R1 and R2 but without PMQ as controls. Export the data as .xls/.xlsx files for further analysis.\nSubtract the control values from the absorbance values I504 for each test, and then use the result for concentration calculations according to the liner equation from the calibration curve.\nNOTE: The limit of detection (LOD) for PMQ in all cases can be calculated according to a standard method22. Calculation was based on the calibration function: LOD = 3.3 × SD/b, where SD is the standard deviation of the blank and b is the slope of the regression line\nSubscription Required.
