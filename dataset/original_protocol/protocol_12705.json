    "NOTE: AMO1 plasmacytoma cells were used for this cell surface proteome experiment. The same protocol could be used for other cell types as well, including a wide array of suspension and adherent cell lines9, as well as various types of primary samples10. However, cell numbers (starting material for the experiment) typically have to be optimized for equivalent proteome coverage. For details related to materials and equipment, see the Table of Materials. For details related to buffers and reagent solutions and their composition, see Table 1.\n1. Cell surface labeling with biotin\nCount the cultured cells and pellet approximately 3.5 × 107 live cells by centrifugation (5 min at 500 × g, 24 °C).\n\tNOTE: The AMO1 plasmacytoma cells were passaged with fresh media every 3 days prior to harvesting.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet by adding 1 mL of cold (4 °C) Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) (no calcium, no magnesium), and gently pipetting up and down.\nPellet the cells again (as in step 1.1) and repeat the wash step (step 1.2) once more (two washes in total).\nAfter the second wash, pellet the cells (as in step 1.1) and resuspend them in 990 µL of cold D-PBS by gently pipetting.\nPrepare a stock solution of 160 mM sodium metaperiodate (NaIO4) beforehand. Split into 50 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C for up to 6 months. Add 10 µL of 160 mM sodium metaperiodate solution to the cell suspension in step 1.4, mix thoroughly, and incubate on an end-to-end rotor for 20 min at 4 °C.",
    "After the incubation is complete, pellet the cells (as in step 1.1), decant the supernatant, and resuspend in 1 mL of cold D-PBS. Repeat this wash step twice (three washes in total). After the third wash, resuspend the cells in 989 µL of D-PBS.\nPrepare a stock solution of 100 mM biocytin hydrazide beforehand. Split into 50 µL aliquots, and store at -20 °C for up to 6 months. Add 1 µL of aniline and 10 µL of 100 mM biocytin hydrazide to the cell suspension in step 1.6, mix thoroughly, and incubate on an end-to-end rotor for 60 min at 4 °C.\nAfter the incubation is complete, pellet the cells (as in step 1.1), decant the supernatant, and resuspend in 1 mL of cold D-PBS. Repeat this wash step twice (three washes in total).\nAfter the third wash, aspirate the supernatant carefully with a pipet, and snap-freeze the cell pellet by placing the tube in liquid N2. Place the frozen pellet at -80 °C, until ready to proceed with lysis and pulldown.\n2. Cell lysis and biotin pulldown\nThaw the frozen cell pellet on ice.\nAdd 500 µL of 2x lysis buffer to the pellet, mix thoroughly, and vortex for 30 s.\n\tNOTE: Vigorous pipetting and vortexing may be required to fully lyse the pellet. Some insoluble debris (i.e., DNA) is acceptable, as it is removed in the subsequent sonication step.\nSonicate the cell lysate on ice (three bursts, 20 s each, 60% duty cycle).\nCentrifuge the lysate to pellet any remaining debris (10 min at 17,200 × g at 4 °C).",
    "While the lysate is centrifuging, add 100 µL of neutravidin agarose resin beads to a filtration column. Attach the column to a vacuum manifold, apply a gentle vacuum, and wash the beads by flowing 3 mL of wash buffer 1 over them.\nRemove the filtration column from the vacuum manifold, cap the bottom, and add the clarified cell lysate to the column with the beads. Cap the top of the column, and incubate the lysate with the beads on an end-to-end rotor for 120 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: When capping the top of the column, firmly hold the bottom cap in place, otherwise it may get dislodged and the cell lysate may leak during incubation.\nPrepare wash buffers 1, 2, and 3 (approximately 5 mL of each wash buffer per sample, refer to Table 1), and place them in a 42 °C water bath\nAfter the lysate has finished incubation, place the filtration column back onto the vacuum manifold, apply a gentle vacuum, and wash the beads by flowing 5 mL of wash buffer 1 over them.\n\tNOTE: More than 5 mL of the wash buffers can be used for washing; extra washing may reduce background, non-specific binding onto the beads.\nRepeat the wash step with 5 mL of wash buffer 2.\nRepeat the wash step with 5 mL of wash buffer 3.\nOnce the final wash buffer has flowed entirely through the beads, remove the column from the manifold. Add 100 µL of \"Lyse\" solution to the beads and transfer them to a 1.7 mL low-protein-binding microcentrifuge tube with a pipet. Briefly spin the tube to settle the beads, and remove 50 µL of the solution without disturbing the settled beads.",
    "NOTE: The reagents in this step and all subsequent steps use a commercially available proteomics sample preparation kit. The kit provides an optimized, simplified sample preparation workflow. However, these steps can also be performed independent of the kit, using a traditional proteomics workflow as described in Verma et al.9. If the beads remain stuck to the side or bottom of the column, allow the beads that have been transferred to the tube to settle, and use extra \"Lyse\" solution in the tube to transfer the remaining beads.\nPlace the tube on a heat block/shaker at 65 °C, and shake at 1,000 rpm for 10 min.\n\t​NOTE: This step is required for the reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues prior to digestion.\n3. Protein digestion\nResuspend the dried trypsin (\"Digest\" tube in the kit, stored at -20 °C) by adding 210 µL of the \"Resuspend\" solution. Pipet the solution up and down several times to ensure all the dried trypsin is resuspended.\nAfter the incubation is complete, add 50 µL of the resuspended trypsin solution to the beads. Incubate the tube at 37 °C, shaking at 500 rpm for at least 90 min to digest the protein.\nOnce the digestion is complete, transfer the solution containing the beads to a spin column, and insert the column into a 1.7 mL low-protein-binding microcentrifuge tube. Spin the tube (500 × g for 5 min at room temperature [RT]) to separate the digested peptide solution from the beads.",
    "NOTE: At this stage, PNGase treatment can be performed on the beads once they are separated from the peptide solution, to elute biotinylated peptide fragments from the streptavidin beads. This peptide sample can then be carried forward through the remainder of the workflow as a separate, secondary peptide sample that can be analyzed and compared with the primary sample from on-bead trypsinization. The PNGase approach is likely to provide complementary data to on-bead trypsinization, given the additional specificity for captured N-glycosylated asparagines based on MS-detectable side chain modification12. However, the drawback of this sequential elution approach is the requirement of twice the mass spectrometer instrument time per sample analysis.\nAdd 100 µL of the \"Stop\" solution to stop the digestion reaction and acidify the peptide solution.\n4. Peptide desalting\nUsing a tube adapter, place a desalting column in a 1.7 mL low-protein-binding microcentrifuge tube. Add the entire acidified peptide solution to the column. Spin the column (3,800 × g for 3 min) so that the solution flows through the column. The peptides are now bound to the column; discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 200 µL of \"Wash 1\" solution to the column and spin (3,800 × g for 3 min, RT). Discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 200 µL of \"Wash 2\" solution to the column and spin (3,800 × g for 3 min, RT). Discard the flowthrough.\nTransfer the column to a new, labeled 1.7 mL low-protein-binding microcentrifuge tube. Add 100 µL of \"Elute\" solution to the column and spin (3,800 × g for 3 min, RT). Add another 100 µL of \"Elute\" solution to the column and spin (3,800 × g for 3 min, RT). The peptides are now eluted off the column into the tube.",
    "Place the peptide solution in a vacuum centrifuge and allow it to dry overnight. Place the dried-down peptides at -80 °C until ready to quantify, and analyze on the mass spectrometer.\n5. Peptide resuspension and quantification\nResuspend the dried down peptides in 20 µL of solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile).\nCentrifuge the resuspended peptides (17,200 × g for 10 min) to pellet any insoluble debris.\nPrepare peptide standards for the colorimetric peptide quantification assay.\n\t\nPlace 5 µL of 1,000 mg/mL peptide stock solution in one well of a 96-well plate.\nPerform a seven-step serial dilution in the plate with deionized (DI) water, as follows, with 5 µL of each standard per well: 1,000 mg/mL, 500 mg/mL, 250 mg/mL, 125 mg/mL, 62.5 mg/mL, 31.25 mg/mL, and 15.625 mg/mL. Place 5 µL of DI water in an eighth well for the blank.\nPlace 4 µL of DI water in three separate wells of the 96-well plate. Add 1 µL of the resuspended peptide solution to each well, for a total volume of 5 µL.\n\tNOTE: When pipetting the peptide solution for quantification, carefully pipet from the top of the solution to prevent disturbing any settled debris.\nCalculate how much working reagent is needed (45 µL required per well). Prepare the required volume of the colorimetric assay working reagent; vortex the working reagent to ensure proper mixing of the components.\nAdd 45 µL of the working reagent to each of the standard and sample wells.\n\tNOTE: Make the standards in duplicate, and use a multichannel pipet to ensure a minimal difference in the timing of when the reagent is added to the wells.\nCover the plate in aluminum foil and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.",
    "Analyze the plate on an automated plate reader. Use the absorbance values recorded for the standard samples to generate a linear standard curve. Determine the equation of the standard curve and R2 value. If the R2 value is reasonable (≥0.95), use the standard curve to determine the concentration of resuspended peptides, accounting for the fivefold dilution in the colorimetric assay plate.\n6. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the digested peptides\nAdjust the concentration of the peptide samples to 0.2 µg/µL by adding solvent A, and transfer 10 µL into a 0.6 mL low-protein-binding tube.\nPlace the tube in the LC autosampler.\nSet the LC and MS/MS parameters, according to Figure 2 and Figure 3.\nInject 5 µL (1 µg) of the peptide sample into the LC-MS/MS setup for analysis.\n\tNOTE: The LC-MS/MS settings shown here are only representative for the illustrations. Depending upon the LC and MS instrument availability, users can modify the settings for the LC gradient and MS/MS parameters to obtain deep proteome coverage. For this paper, the MS data analysis was performed using MaxQuant https://www.maxquant.org/, secondary data analysis was performed using Perseus https://maxquant.net/perseus/, and pathway analysis using https://reactome.org/.\nSubscription Required.
