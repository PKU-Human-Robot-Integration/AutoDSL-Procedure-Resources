One 6-well plate (at 80% confluency, about 1 million cells per well) is sufficient to start the differentiation.\nThaw Matrigel Matrix at 4°C. Make smaller aliquots using refrigerated pipette tips. Aliquots can be stored at −80°C for long term storage.\nNote: Matrigel is sensitive to temperature. When aliquoting Matrigel, place Matrigel and microcentrifuge tubes on ice within the biosafety cabinet. We suggest diluting Matrigel in DMEM-F12 (1:1) to prevent gelling during long term storage.\nDilute Matrigel at 1:100 in cold DMEM-F12 medium. For example, add 100 μL Matrigel in 10 mL DMEM-F12 media.\nNote: If hiPSCs colonies show enhanced differentiation and low adherence, higher concentration of Matrigel (1:50) could be used for coating plates to facilitate cell attachment.\nAdd 1 mL diluted Matrigel matrix to each well of the 6-well plate. Make sure to let Matrigel cover the entire surface of the well and incubate the plate at 37°C for minimum of 1 h.\nAspirate Matrigel just before seeding cells.\nNote: Avoid air dry of Matrigel-coated wells before seeding cells.\nRapidly thaw a hiPSC cryovial by gently swirling the vial in a 37°C water bath until there is just a small bit of ice left in the vial. In a laminar flow hood, transfer cells to a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of pre-warmed iPSC culture medium mTesR1 containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.\nSpin cells at 200×g for 3 min.",
    "Remove supernatant and resuspend the cell suspension in mTesR1 medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor and transfer 2 mL of the cell suspension into each well of the Matrigel-coated 6-well plate.\nNote: Resuspend cell pellet in a proper volume of culture medium depending on the cell numbers in the frozen stock. We recommend seeding cells ranging from 1 × 104 to 2 × 104 cells/cm2.\nChange medium every day. Cells will be ready for the first passage in 2–4 days according to the growth of the hiPSC line.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1490-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Images of healthy and differentiated hiPSC colonies\n(A) Typical morphology of a healthy hiPSC colony with smooth edges.\n(B) Differentiated hiPSC colonies usually appear as clusters of scattered and flat cells (arrowheads). Scale bars, 200 μm.\nNote: At this point, the healthy hiPSC colonies will appear as tight colonies with smooth edges and are separated from each other (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nOnce cells reach about 70% confluency, start the first cell passage by preparing another Matrigel-coated 6-well plate. This 6-well plate could be directly used for the iPSC induction.\nCells are passaged at 1:3 ratio. This way, two wells of the first 6-well plate (starting culture plate) can be passaged into a freshly prepared Matrigel-coated 6-well plate for iPSC induction.\nRemove medium and wash wells with DPBS once.\nAdd 1 mL Versene to each well and incubate at 37°C for 6–7 min. The optimized incubation time varies from different hiPSC lines. For example, some hiPSC lines require 5 min while the genetically modified or patient derived hiPSC lines requires variable minutes.",
    "Aspirate Versene from the wells. Add 2 mL mTesR1 medium to the wells and gently pipette up and down to dislodge the cells. Large aggregates of stem cell colonies should be seen floating in the medium. Gently triturate 2–3 times with a 5 mL pipette to break colonies into smaller pieces.\nNote: Versene is an EDTA solution to be used as a gentle non-enzymatic cell dissociation reagent and hence can be used for clump passaging. Typically, the cells remain attached at the bottom of the culture plate before adding neutralized medium.\nCritical: Avoid generating a single-cell suspension because it will result in differentiation and poor cell survival.\nCollect medium containing the cell colonies in a 15 mL tube and add extra mTesR1 medium up to 12 mL.\nGently mix by pipetting up and down 2 or 3 times. Transfer 2 mL cell suspension to each well of the newly Matrigel-coated 6-well plate.\nPlace 6-well plate in incubator and change iPSC culture medium daily.\nThe newly passaged 6-well plate should reach 80%–90% confluency in 3–5 days and can be used to start the iPSC induction.\nNote: We recommend using hiPSCs culture within 2–4 passages from a frozen stock for this differentiation protocol.\nCritical: Make sure there are no differentiated colonies in these expanding cultures. These colonies show the loss of boundary intactness and can be identified by the apparent scattered morphology of cells (arrowheads in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). If the differentiated cells only occupy a small fraction (<10%), remove them by scratching with a sterile pipette tip or careful aspiration with pipette tip attached to vacuum. If substantial differentiated cells are noticed, repeat the hiPSCs culture.\nPart 2: iPSC induction\nTiming: 7 days",
    "The next step is to direct hiPSCs toward a neuroectodermal fate, which can be assessed by the generation of NESTIN+/ PAX6+ neural progenitors.\nPrepare iPSC induction medium containing 10 μM RA and 0.5 mM VPA. Warm up to room temperature before use.\nAspirate hiPSCs culture medium from the 6-well plate and add 2 mL of iPSC induction medium to each well.\nEvery day, replace the medium completely with fresh medium for seven days.\nNote: As cells are growing over time, more medium can be used to maintain the pH value (e.g., 3 mL per well of 6-well plate).\nCells should appear as a monolayer and grow together tightly at the end of day 7 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). High & tight confluency is optimal for resuspension growth in the next step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1490-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bars, 100 μm.\nPart 3: Embryoid body (EB) formation\nTiming: 4 days\nThis stage requires ultra-low attachment 10 cm Petri Dishes which prevent cells from attaching to the bottom.\nNote: Ultra-low attachment plates have a specialized surface coated with a hydrophobic hydrogel which inhibits cell attachment and forces them to remain in the suspension.\nPrepare resuspension growth medium/KOSR medium with 10 μM Rock inhibitor.\nNote: ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 has been shown to significantly inhibit apoptosis and enhance cell survival (Pettinato et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). The ROCK inhibitor could be added throughout the process for cell lines with poor growth.",
    "Warm up resuspension growth medium/KOSR medium at room temperature.\nRemove iPSC induction medium and wash wells once with DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL Versene to each well and incubate at 37°C for 6–7 min.\nRemove Versene and add 1 mL of KOSR medium (resuspension medium) to each well. Gently shake the plates to dissociate cells. Scrape cells by using a 5 mL pipette if necessary.\nTransfer cell suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nNote: Triturate the cell suspension 1–2 times using a pipette to break apart the larger cell clusters into smaller aggregates.\nAdd 1 mL KOSR medium to rinse the well and pool together to the 15 mL tube.\nNote: For 3 wells of 6-well plate, the total cell suspension volume is ∼6 mL.\nAdd ∼9 mL of KOSR medium to a low attachment Petridish. Transfer 6 mL cell suspension to the Petridish and gently mix.\nNote: Check under microscope and most cells should be in aggregates. To let aggregates fully suspended, the total volume should be ∼15 mL in each Petridish.\nChange resuspension growth medium/KOSR medium every 2 days and culture cell aggregates for 4 days to form embryoid body (EB) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nChange medium during suspension growth.\nGently swirl the plate and transfer cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube (if more than 15 mL, split into two tubes).\nAllow the cell aggregates to settle to the bottom of the tube (it will take about 10 min).\nRemove supernatant (leaving ∼1 mL) and add ∼14 mL of fresh KOSR medium.\nCarefully transfer cell suspension to the Ultra-low attachment Petridish.\nGently shake the petri dish to aid uniform distribution of the aggregates and place it back to the incubator.\nPart 4: Neurosphere (NSP) formation\nTiming: 7 days\nPrepare Neurosphere (NSP) medium and warm it up at room temperature.",
    "Transfer cell suspension (embryoid body at 4 days in step 22) to a 15 mL tube (if more than 15 mL, split into two tubes) and let aggregates settle down to the bottom of the tube.\nRemove supernatant (leaving ∼1 mL liquid) and add ∼14 mL NSP Medium.\nCarefully transfer cell suspension to the Ultra-low attachment Petridish.\nReplace with fresh NSP medium every two days as describe in step 22 (∼15 mL NSP medium/10 cm Petridish).\nCells are cultured in NSP Medium for 7 days to form neurospheres (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPart 5: Generation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs)\nTiming: 4–7 days\nIn this stage, neurospheres will be digested into singular cells and expanded to generate NPCs.\nPrepare Matrigel-coated 10 cm culture plates as described in step 1.\nTransfer NSP aggregates to a 15 mL tube and let aggregates sit down to the bottom (∼10 min).\nRemove supernatant (leaving∼1 mL liquid) and add 5 mL of DPBS to wash the aggregates.\nLet aggregates sit down to the bottom (∼10 min). Remove the supernatant and add 8 mL Accutase to NSP aggregates.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min. Gently pipetting 5 strokes with a 5 mL pipette in the middle (at ∼7 min) to break the large aggregates.\nAdd ∼3 mL NPC medium to neutralize the digestion.\nGently pipette up and down several times to break most of aggregates into singular cells.\nSpin cells at 200×g for 3 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet into appropriate volume of NPC medium.\nSeed NPCs onto Matrigel coated 10 cm culture plates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Neurospheres from one plate can give rise to 2–4 million cells and can be seeded onto four 10 cm plates.\nMix well and culture cells in incubator.",
    "Change NPC medium every two days until cells are close to full confluency and then prepare NPC frozen stocks in the following stage.\nPreparation of NPC frozen stocks\nTiming: 1–2 h\nWhen NPCs reach ∼90% confluency, prepare for frozen stocks. At this stage, some small aggregates could be noticed in the culture plate. Remove these aggregates (white spots) by a filter pipette tip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nGently shake the medium and remove the supernatant. Wash once with DPBS.\nAdd 3 mL Accutase to each 10 cm plate and incubate at 37°C for 2–3 min. Gently shake the plate and most cells should be dissociated from the plate.\nAdd 3 mL NPC medium with rock inhibitor to neutralize the digestion. Pipette gently to dissociate cells from the plate.\nTransfer cell suspension to a 15 mL tube. Spin down at 200×g for 3 min.\nNote: To estimate the yield, an aliquot (∼20 μL) could be taken from cell suspension for cell counting by a hemocytometer.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cell pellets into desired volume of precold (4°C) NPC freeing medium and aliquot quickly into cryovials.\nTransfer cryovials into a freezing container and place it into a −80°C freezer. On the next day, transfer cryovials to a cryogenic storage container with liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nNote: It is recommended to freeze NPC at a concentration of 1 × 106/mL/vial. The yield of one 10 cm plate is about 4 × 106 NPCs.\nPart 6: Lentivirus preparation for motor neuron (MNs) generation",
    "This part describes the preparation of lentiviruses expressing transcription factors, which are necessary and sufficient to induce NPCs to MNs. To ensure high induction efficiency, it is critical to prepare high-quality supercoiled plasmids and make lentiviruses with good titers. For detailed information about lentivirus preparation and the applications, please see our previous studies (Ding et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Ding and Kilpatrick, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In this protocol, we used three lentiviral vectors, pCSC-NGN2-IRES-GFP-T2A-Sox11 (Plasmid 1), pCSC-ISL1-T2A-LHX3 (plasmid 2), and pCSC-Ngn2-IRES-ISL1-T2A-LHX3 (plasmid 3) (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nCulture and expansion of HEK293T cells\nTiming: 3–4 days\nQuickly thaw a frozen stock of HEK293T cells in a 37°C water bath.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL tube with 5 mL DMEM medium and centrifuge at 200×g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and re-suspend the cells in 10 mL fresh HEK Cell Culture medium.\nSeed HEK293T cells into a 10 cm tissue culture plate. Grow cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a standard tissue culture incubator.\nNote: It is recommended to use low passage number (<20) HEK cells in the preparation of lentiviruses.\nOnce cells reach about 90% confluency, split cells for expansion.\nAspirate media from culture plate and wash once with 1× PBS.\nIncubate cells with 0.5 mL of 0.05% Trypsin (0.25% Trypsin diluted with 1× PBS) for 2–4 min until cells have been fully detached.\nAdd 3 mL of HEK cell culture medium to inactivate the dissociation reagent.\nTriturate the cells to create single cell suspension, collect the cells into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge the cells at 200×g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet into proper volume of HEK culture medium. Split cells in 10 cm plates at the ratio of 1:3 to 1:5.\nTransfection and lentivirus preparation\nTiming: ∼4 days",
    "The day before transfection, the HEK293T cells must be seeded at a proper cell density. Lentiviral plasmid DNA is delivered by the Polyethylenimine (PEI)-mediated transfection method.\nDay 0: Seed about 8 × 106 HEK293T cells into each 10 cm culture plate for lentivirus production. Next day, HEK cells should be about 80% confluency for transfection.\nCritical: It is recommended to perform transfection (Day 1) in the late afternoon and replace the media in the following morning (Day 2). The longer exposure (>16 h) to transfection mixture may influence cell viability.\nDay 1 (transfection):\nAdd the lentiviral plasmid and the packaging vectors to DMEM (no serum) as described in the recipe below. Scale up based on how many plates to be transfected.\nMix well by pipetting up and down for a few times.\nAdd desired amount of PEI into plasmid mixture and immediately mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down for 10 times or rigorously vortex for 15 s.\nIncubate the mixture at room temperature (∼25°C) for 15 min.\nAdd the mixture (1 mL/ 10 cm plate) dropwise to each plate with gentle rocking.\nGently mix by shaking up and down, and then left and right for a few times before putting the plate back into incubator.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1490_14.csv\nNote: The ratio of PEI to the total amount of DNA is 1:3. For example, the total amount of DNA is 7.5 μg for a 10 cm plate, add 22.5 μg (22.5 μL of 1 μg/μL) PEI into the plasmid mixture in 1 mL DMEM.\nDay 2: After overnight (∼16 h) incubation, gently replace medium with 10 mL HEK cell culture medium for each plate.\nNote: It is recommended to warm up HEK cell culture medium to room temperature and carefully replace the medium to avoid cell detachment.",
    "Day 3: Collect viral supernatants at about 48 h post-transfection (first collection). Add back 10 mL fresh HEK cell culture medium for each plate and incubate. Store the viral supernatant at 4°C.\nDay 4: Collect viral supernatants at about 72 h post-transfection (second collection). Discard the plates in a biohazard bag and trash it after autoclave.\nPool two collections of the same lentivirus together and filter the viral supernatants with 0.45 μm vacuum filters. Store lentivirus at 4°C till use (within two weeks), or freeze at −80°C for longer term storage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1490-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Transfection efficiency of plasmid with GFP reporter\n(A) Micrograph of HEK cells (phase contrast) at virus collection.\n(B) Micrograph of HEK cells (GFP) at virus collection (72 h post-transfection). Almost all HEK cells are transfected positive (plasmid #1 with co-expressed GFP). Scale bars, 100 μm.\nNote: Transfection efficiency can be examined under a fluorescence microscope if the lentiviral vector contains GFP reporter (e.g., plasmid #1). At lentivirus collection, most HEK cells (>90%) should be GFP (+) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nLentivirus titration\nTiming: 4 days\nBefore transduction, we recommend to titer the virus to verify the quality. The virus can be titrated based on GFP reporter (plasmid#1) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B) or immunocytochemistry (ICC) of lentivirus expressed factors (plasmid#2 and #3) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4F) as previously reported (Ding and Kilpatrick, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Sepehrimanesh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1490-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale bar, 25 μm.\nSeed HEK cells in a 24 well plate at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well/0.5 mL medium. Cells will reach ∼70% confluency the next day at the time of titration.\nMake a serial dilution (e.g., 1:10, 1:100 etc.) of viral supernatant with HEK culture medium.\nAdd 50 μL of undiluted and diluted lentivirus to desired wells. Set one well as a negative control without transduction.\nChange the medium after 8 h or overnight (∼16 h) exposure to lentivirus.\nCheck the percentage of positive cells after 48–72 h.\nNote: For lentivirus expressing GFP reporter, examine GFP (+) cells directly under a fluorescence microscope in living cells. For lentivirus that does not express fluorescent reporters, cells need to be fixed and perform ICC to examine lentivirus-expressed factors.\nTransduced positive cells should be more than 90% in undiluted wells and more than 30% in 10-fold diluted wells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: A good titer of lentiviral supernatants should be no less than 1 × 106 IFU/mL. (IFU, Infectious Unit).\nPart 7: Lentiviral transduction of NPCs to generate MNs\nTiming: 2–4 weeks",
    "This part directs NPCs toward MNs by lentiviral delivery of transcription factors. This part can be done in two different ways. One approach is to deliver four transcription factors N-S-I-L (NEUROG2, SOX11, ISL1, and LHX3) with two lentiviruses. Another approach is to use a single lentivirus co-expressing three factors N-I-L (NEUROG2, ISL1, and LHX3). Both approaches can generate mature functional MNs. The second approach tends to generate MNs with higher purity and yield (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). These two approaches have been systematically examined and compared in our previous study (Sepehrimanesh and Ding, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nPrepare Matrigel-coated 6-well culture plate as described in step 1.\nRapidly thaw NPC frozen cryovials by gently swirling the vial in a 37°C water bath until there is just a small bit of ice left in the vial. Transfer cells to a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of pre-warmed NPC culture medium in a laminar flow cabinet.\nSpin down cells at 200×g for 3 min.\nGently resuspend cell pellets into proper volume of NPC medium and seed NPCs onto Matrigel-coated plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2.\nNote: One frozen vial with 1 × 106 NPCs is enough to seed 3 wells of a 6-well plate.\nNext day, the NPC confluency is expected to be about 60%. Add about 300 μL lentiviral supernatant to each well.\nNote: At lentivirus transduction, the proper NPC density (50%–60% confluence) is critical to obtain higher yield of MNs. If two lentiviruses are used for transduction, add 300 μL of each lentiviruses at MOI ∼2.\nNPCs are exposed to lentiviruses for around 6 h to overnight (∼16 h). Then replace the culture medium with Neuronal Maturation Medium.\nHalf change the medium every other day till analysis or replating.",
    "Note: The age of iPSC-MNs is counted from the lentiviral transduction as dpi (days post-viral infection). Neuron-like morphology can be noticed after 3 dpi.\nPreparation of coverslips with monolayer of astrocyte cells\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nMouse astrocytes were isolated from postnatal day 1 (P1) pups and cultured in DMEM with 15% FBS as reported (Schildge et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). The Animal Procedure Statement in this study was approved by institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) at University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

    "Timing: 1–2 h\nAt 5 dpi, MNs can be replated and seeded onto coverslips with a mono-layer of astrocytes for long-term culture (more than 14 dpi) and further analysis.\nDissociate MNs from culture plates.\nAspirate media from the cell culture plate and wash once with 1× PBS.\nFor each well of 6 well plate, incubate cells with 1 mL of dissociation reagent (e.g., accutase) for 2–4 min until most of cells are detached.\nNote: This step is critical for neuronal survival. Excess of accutase or longer incubation can be detrimental to neurons.\nAdd 2 mL of DMEM: F12 medium to neutralize the dissociation reagent.\nCollect the cells into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 200×g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells gently in an appropriate volume of neuronal maturation medium.\nSeed at a density of 1 × 103 cells/cm2 dissociated MNs onto coverslips with astrocytes (0.5 mL/well).\nChange half volume of Neuronal Maturation Medium (1:1) every other day till analysis.\nExamination of MN identity\nTiming: 2–3 days\nMN identity can be verified by immunostaining of specific markers at different developmental stages. The survival, purity and yield can be calculated as our previous reports (Ding et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Sepehrimanesh and Ding, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nNeuronal morphology is examined under inverted microscopy directly in living cultures. Within 7 dpi, neurites will rapidly grow out from the soma displaying neuronal phenotype. At 14 dpi, coverslips are fixed and immunostained with neuron specific markers, such as TUBB3, MAP2, and neurofilament protein (SMI-32) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1490-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Adapted with permission from (Sepehrimanesh and Ding, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nTo verify MN identity, immunostaining for HB9 and/or ChAT (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) are performed at different maturation stages. HB9 is an early MN marker and highly expressed at 10–20 dpi. ChAT is a mature MN marker gradually increase the expression at 14 dpi or later.\nICC MN markers:\nTake coverslips from 24-well plates at desired time points (7 dpi, 14 dpi, etc.)\nFix cultured cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH 7.4) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nWash twice with PBS.\nIncubate fixed cells in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA) for 1 h for permeabilization and blocking.\nIncubate fixed cells with primary antibodies in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA) at 4°C overnight (∼16 h).\nNote: The antibodies include anti-TUBB3 and anti-MAP2 as neuronal markers, anti-HB9 as an early MN marker, anti-CHAT as a late MN marker.\nAfter removal of primary antibodies, wash coverslips with PBS for 10 min × 3.\nIncubate fixed cells with corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies in dark, at room temperature for 2 h.",
