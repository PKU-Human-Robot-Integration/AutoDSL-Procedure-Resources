  "title": "Detachment Procedure of Bacteria from Atmospheric Particles for Flow-cytometry Counting",
  "procedures": [
    "This procedure detaches bacteria and viruses from aerosol (dust and organic aggregates) particles for flow-cytometry counting (Reche et al., 2018). It is similar to the procedure used for benthic bacteria attached to streambed sediments by Amalfitano and Fazi (2008). After this detachment procedure, bacteria are unattached, dispersed in sterile MilliQ-water and they, then, can be easily counted by flow cytometry representing the total of bacteria associated to atmospheric particles. The atmospheric samples come from dry and wet collectors. We take 3 ml-samples into 5 ml-criovials, fix them with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde (10% + 0.05% final concentration) in the field, freeze them in liquid nitrogen, and keep them at -80 °C until analysis. Dry deposition is recovered from the collector using sterile Milli-Q water. More details on dry and wet collectors can be found in Reche et al. (2018).   Here, we mainly expose the steps for the bacterial counting (Gasol and Del Giorgio, 2000), but the previous steps on the retrieve of the microbial layer are also common for viruses.Bacteria detachment procedureTake 718 μl of atmospheric deposition samples in 1.5 ml-microcentrifuge tubes. This aliquot contains both free and attached to particles bacteria.Add 56.4 μl of the working solution (see Recipes) of the chelating agent sodium pyrophosphate (ca. 0.1% final concentration), and 7.5 μl of the detergent Tween 20 (0.5% final concentration) to reduce the adhesion of bacteria to the mineral and organic particles of the aerosol (Figure 1A). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617183312_1722.jpgFigure 1.

    "Select the microbial layer and suspend it in sterilized Milli-Q water up to the initial sample volume in a cryovial.Shake the samples for 30 min at ~720 rpm in a vortex (Figure 1B), and place them in an ultrasonic bath for 1 min to disperse the attached bacteria into the liquid phase. It is important not to place the samples in the ultrasonic bath for more than 1 min to prevent cellular damages during the detachment procedure.Place carefully approx. 718 μl of Nycodenz beneath of treated sample using a needle long enough to reach the bottom of a 1.5 ml-microcentrifuge tube (Figure 1C). The syringe with the Nycodenz should not disturb the content of the microcentrifuge tube or has air bubbles. This is important to form properly the density gradient.Centrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes at 14,000 x g for 90 min at 4 °C (Figure 1D) in a density gradient using Nycodenz as medium to separate four density layers (top-down): supernatant, microbial layer, Nycodenz and pellet (Figure 1E). The pellet is not always visible. The observation of the pellet depends on particle loading in the atmospheric deposition and it is mainly observed when atmospheric deposition contains Saharan dust.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617183338_2081.jpgFigure 2. Backlight picture of a microcentrifuge tube after microcentrifugation (after the Step 5). After the Step 5, the microcentrifuge is with four layers (top-down): supernatant, microbial layer, Nycodenz and dust pellet.Identify the microbial layer with a backlight (Figure 2, Video 1) and carefully aspire completely this layer using a tip with the pipette (Figure 1E, Video 2). Place the microbial layer (200 μl) into cryovial tubes and suspend it in 518 μl of sterilized Milli-Q water to reach the initial volume (718 μl) (Figure 1F). Then, fix the sample again with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde (final concentration 1% + 0.",
    "05%) and store it at -80 °C until the flow cytometry analysis.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

Backlight video to show the procedure to retrieve the microbial layer Bacterial counting by flow cytometryOnce the cytometer is clean, calibrate the flow of the cytometer each working day. First, weigh a tube containing Milli-Q water, this value is the initial weight (Winitial) in mg (= μl), then run this Milli-Q water sample for 10 min at low flow in the cytometer, and re-weigh the tube again, this value is the final weight (Wfinal) in mg (= μl). Second, estimate the working flow using the next equation. This working flow usually ranges from 33.6 μl min-1 to 42.2 μl min-1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617183904_5597.jpgSet the flow cytometer with excitation at 448 nm, the fluorescence Side Scatter (SSC) and Forward Scatter (FSC) parameters in logarithmic scale, the threshold on green fluorescence (FL1-H) and then run a Milli-Q water sample. Keep the events at very low level (no green fluorescence must be detected).Defrost the samples and prepare 500 μl-aliquots by triplicate in flow cytometer tubes, add 5 μl of SYBR Green I (1:1,000) to stain the bacteria, vortex the cytometer tubes and incubate them in the dark for 10 min at 25 °C, add 10 μl of the suspension of fluorescent latex beads (concentration 1 x 105) as an internal reference, and then, run the samples at low flow rate. First, run a Milli-Q water sample as negative control and, then, the experimental samples until around 10000 events were acquired. Events have to range between 200 and 800 per second to avoid coincidence. The samples have to be diluted when events are higher than 800 per second.",
