    "NOTE: All animal procedures were handled at the Charité or University Clinic Jena in accord with German Animal Care laws avoiding any undue suffering of animals.\n1. Preparing Solutions and Dissection Workplace\nSolutions\n\tNOTE: Prepare the following solutions before starting dissection of the epithelium.\n\t\nSolutions for the dissection procedure:\n\t\t\nPrepare Ringer’s solution (pH 7.4) with concentrations of 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM glucose.\nPrepare a PBS-/- solution (pH 7.4) with concentrations of 2.68 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 136 mM NaCl, and 8.1 mM Na2HPO4.\nPrepare a fixative solution (pH 7.2) with concentrations of 1x PBS-/-, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 4% sucrose, and 4% paraformaldehyde. Sucrose in the fixative solution improves cryosectioning and pick-up of cryosections. Store at -20 °C.\nSolutions for the staining procedure\n\t\t\nPrepare a PBS+/+ solution with concentrations of 1x PBS-/-, 0.48 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM CaCl2.\nPrepare a PBST+/+ solution with concentrations of 1x PBS+/+ and 0.1% Triton X-100.\nPrepare a blocking solution with concentrations of 1x PBST+/+ and 1% gelatine.\nWorkplace\n\t\nFor the dissection workplace, use a dissecting microscope with bright illumination, as well as a liquid-blocker pen.\nPrepare a petri dish, filled with Ringer’s solution, and adhesive glass slides.\nObtain the following surgical instruments: a pair of surgical scissors with one sharp and one blunt tip, a pair of spring scissors with straight tip shape, two forceps with fine curved tip shape and a razor blade (Figure 1A).\n2. Preparation of the Nasal Septum\nHouse animals in approved cages with regular access to food and water and appropriate day/night cycle.",
    "Perform anesthesia in a closed receptacle containing gauze soaked with 100% isoflurane and monitor analgesia by testing rear foot reflexes. Since cervical dislocation can cause blood in nasal cavities, directly decapitate anesthetized mice.\nRemove the skin to expose the bone of the entire skull and nose, and wipe away the remaining blood and tissue thoroughly using a paper towel. Remove the lower jaw and the front teeth.\nIncise the dorsal bone of the nose bilaterally in 1-2 mm distance parallel to the suture line to separate one side of the septum (medially) from the maxilla (laterally). Split the nose with a single cut. If bone remnants and turbinates are still attached to the septum, remove these carefully to expose the septum completely without touching it.\nRemove the dorsal nasal bone by sliding the fine curved tip of a forceps along the dorsal side of the septum, between septum and nasal bone. Apply slight pressure on the bone, push it up and remove it.\nTo provide access to the two septal tissues, one from each cavity, carefully remove the maxilla of the other side of the head. When preparing older animals (P > 28), remove the tip of the frontal bone covering the olfactory bulbs.\nIdentify the olfactory epithelium by its slightly yellow color (Figure 1B). The bordering respiratory epithelium is white and shows movement of motile cilia that can be seen under the dissecting microscope. Cut along the border between olfactory and respiratory epithelium with a pair of fine spring scissors.",
    "Extend the cut and separate the septum from the ventral connection to the vomer bone. Then cut along the border between the septum and the lamina cribrosa of the Os ethmoidale. The septum is now completely isolated from all connections to the head. Use the cutting positions shown in Figure 1C.\n3. Isolation of the Olfactory Epithelium for Immunostaining\nPlace an adhesive glass slide in the petri dish filled with Ringer’s solution. Place it onto the edge of the petri dish, so that one half of the glass lies in the Ringer’s solution (Figure 1A).\nUse a forceps to carefully transfer the ethmoid bone with the olfactory epithelium to the petri dish. Lift it without grabbing it with the forceps tips.\nGrab the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone with one forceps and use a second one to carefully remove the epithelium from one side of the septum. Slide the curved tip between the perpendicular plate and epithelium to peel the epithelium off.\nBe always sure to identify the ciliary side, in case the epithelium flips in the Ringer’s solution. If the epithelium flips, it is hardly possible to identify the ciliary side afterwards. Mostly, the epithelium rolls up with the ciliary surface inside.\nCompare the enrolled tissue shape with the cutting positions shown in Figure 1C. Grab the epithelium at a position at the border and pull it onto the glass slide. Do not touch the ciliary side with the forceps to avoid lesions of the tissue.\nTurn the septum and repeat the procedure with the epithelium from the other side.\nDry the glass slide around both pieces of olfactory epithelium with a paper towel and encircle the tissue with a liquid-blocker pen.",
    "Fix the tissue with 150 µl fixative solution for 10 min at RT. Concerning cilia stability and integrity, use short fixation times for a variety of tested antibodies. Within these 10 min cilia are fixed, but probably not the whole epithelium tissue. Thus, immediate visualize with the microscope subsequent to the staining procedure. However, fixative times might vary for individual antibodies.\n4. Staining Protocol\nNOTE: Handle the tissue very carefully to preserve ciliary structures of the olfactory sensory neurons. Remove solutions by pipetting. Do not drop any solutions directly onto the epithelium, as mechanical forces could disrupt the fine cilia. Perform all steps at RT if not stated otherwise.\nRemove the fixative solution and wash 2 times with PBS+/+.\nIncubate the epithelium for at least 1 hr with blocking solution.\nPrepare primary antibody solution by dissolving the antibody in blocking solution (1:200 for the antibodies used in this study) and centrifuge for 5 min at full speed to remove any precipitates.\nIncubate the epithelium with antibody solution in a humid chamber at 4 °C O/N.\nWash epithelium with PBS+/+ for 5 min at least 3 times.\nPrepare secondary antibody solution by dissolving the antibody in blocking solution (1:500) and centrifuge for 5 min at full speed.\nIncubate the epithelium with secondary antibody solution for 1 hr in a dark chamber.\nWash epithelium with PBS+/+ for 5 min at least 3 times.\nRemove the liquid-blocker with a razor blade or paper towel. Wash the epithelium with distilled water for 5 s.\nPreserve the tissue in antifade mounting reagent.",
    "NOTE: Background fluorescence increases rapidly within days; microscopical analysis not later than 2 days after embedding in mounting medium is therefore recommended. Special care has to be taken not to squeeze the tissue when searching the correct focal plane, since it can severely damage the preparation. Due to out-of-focus fluorescence, further investigation with confocal microscopy is recommended.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
