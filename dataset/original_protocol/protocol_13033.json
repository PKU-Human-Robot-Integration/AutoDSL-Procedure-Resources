    "1. MMP expression\nCloning and transformation of pET-3a-Hisx6-pro-MMP-3cd into R2DP cells\n\t\nDigest the pET-3a plasmid (see the Table of Materials) with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes in Digest Buffer (see the Table of Materials). In a total reaction volume of 40 µL, add 4 µL of Digest Buffer, 33 µL of 100 ng/µL plasmid, and 1.5 µL of each restriction enzyme and allow the reaction to proceed for ~2 h until completion at 37 °C.\nPerform a PCR reaction on the MMP-3cd sequence to insert an N-terminal His-tag. Use 25 µL of PCR Mix (see the Table of Materials), 2.5 µL of 10 µM primers (Supplemental Figure S1), and 1.25 µL of the 100 ng/µL insert sequence. Add sterile water to a final reaction volume of 50 µL.\nRun the PCR product and digested vector on a 1% agarose gel. Purify the gel bands using a Gel Recovery Kit (see the Table of Materials) per the manufacturer's protocol.\nClone the amplified PCR product into the digested vector between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites using DNA Assembly Mix (see the Table of Materials). Use online tools to determine the required volume of the insert and cut vector for a total reaction volume of 15 µL.\nThaw a 50 µL aliquot of high-transformation efficiency cells (see the Table of Materials) on ice until thawed. Prewarm SOC Growth Medium (see the Table of Materials) to 37 °C and LB-ampicillin (LB Amp) plates (see the Table of Materials).\nAdd 1-2 µL of the pET-3a-Hisx6-pro-MMP-3cd assembly reaction to the 50 µL aliquot. Incubate on ice for 30 min.\nHeat-shock the cells by incubating at 42 °C for 30 s. Incubate on ice for 2 min.",
    "Add 950 µL of SOC growth medium to each transformant mixture. Shake for 1 h at 250 rpm and 37 °C.\nPlate 100 µL of the transformants on LB Amp plates and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nInoculate each isolated colony in 10 mL of LB Amp medium. Shake overnight at 250 rpm and 37 °C.\nExtract plasmid DNA per manufacturer's protocol for the miniprep kit (see the Table of Materials). Confirm the sequence of the construct using T7 forward and reverse primers (Supplemental Figure S1).\n\t\tNOTE: The pET-3a-Hisx6-pro-MMP-3cd construct DNA can be stored at -20 °C. When ready, proceed with transformation into R2DP cells.\nThaw one 20 µL aliquot of R2DP cells (see the Table of Materials) on ice for 2-5 min. Prewarm SOC growth medium to room temperature and LB Amp CamR plates to 37 °C (see the Table of Materials).\nAdd 1 µL of 100 ng/µL sequence-confirmed pET-3a-Hisx6-pro-MMP-3cd to the 50 µL aliquot. Stir gently to mix and return the tube to ice.\nIncubate the tube on ice for 5 min.\nHeat-shock the cells by incubating at 42 °C for exactly 30 s. Do not shake.\nPlace the cells on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 80 µL of room-temperature SOC medium to the transformant mixture. Shake for 1 h at 250 rpm and 37 °C.\nPlate the transformants on LB Amp CamR plates and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nGrowth and induction\n\t\nInoculate a single, isolated colony of R2DP pET-3a-Hisx6-pro-MMP-3cd transformant from an LB Amp CamR plate in 10 mL of LB Amp CamR media at 37 °C. Shake at 250 rpm overnight (~16 h). Save aliquots from each culture and prepare 40% (v/v) glycerol (see the Table of Materials) stocks if desired.",
    "Per overnight culture, inoculate a 1 L flask containing 500 mL of LB Amp CamR medium to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.05-0.1.\n\t\tNOTE: This should return the cells to logarithmic growth.\nMeasure the OD600 at several time points, typically for 3-4 h, until it falls between 0.4 and 0.6.\nBefore induction, aliquot a fraction of culture into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube (see the Table of Materials) and label it Un-induced Fraction. Store it at -80 °C for gel analysis. If not running an SDS-PAGE gel, skip this step and proceed to step 1.2.5.\nInduce the cultures to a final concentration of 1 mM using 1 M isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) stock (see the Table of Materials). Continue to incubate in the 37 °C shaker for an additional 3-4 h.\n\t\tNOTE: During expression, the reader should determine the optimal OD600 at the time of induction and the IPTG concentration. If the yield drops substantially after purification, the imidazole concentration in purification buffers may require adjustment, or the cell pellet may need to be sonicated further.\nBefore centrifuging the cultures, aliquot a fraction of culture into a second 1.5 mL microfuge tube and label it Induced Fraction. Store it at -80 °C for gel analysis. If not running an SDS-PAGE gel, skip this step and proceed to step 1.2.7.\nCentrifuge the cell culture in 250 mL conical bottles (see the Table of Materials) at maximum speed and 4 °C for 10 min.\nRepeat step 1.2.7 until the cultures are completely pelleted.\n\t\tNOTE: PAUSE: Cell pellets can be frozen at -80 °C and thawed later for further processing. Otherwise, skip this step and proceed to step 1.3.1.\nInclusion body extraction and solubilization",
    "NOTE: Prepare fresh 10 M urea, preferably no earlier than one day in advance, stirring thoroughly until dissolved completely. Do not heat or autoclave urea; store it at room temperature.\n\t\nResuspend the pellet (from step 1.2.8) in lysis buffer (see the Table of Materials). Per gram of pellet, add 3 mL of lysis buffer and resuspend by vortexing or pipetting. Shake overnight at 4 °C.\nAdd 1.25 mL of 10% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate (see the Table of Materials) per 1 L of culture. Shake at room temperature for 30 min at 150 rpm.\nAdd 10 µL of DNase I (see the Table of Materials) per 1 L of culture. Shake at room temperature for 30 min at 150 rpm.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C.\nSet aside a fraction of Lysed MMP for gel analysis. Store it at -80 °C. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to step 1.3.6.\n\t\tNOTE: After centrifugation, the pellet may be stringy and not compactly packed, making it risky to discard the supernatant. If this is the case, then skip step 1.3.6 and proceed to step 1.3.7.\nDiscard the supernatant from the centrifuged samples.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused at this point and the cell pellets frozen at -80 °C and thawed later. Otherwise, skip this step and proceed to step 1.3.7.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 mL/L culture of Inclusion Body Buffer (see the Table of Materials) by pipetting up and down.\nDuring sonication, keep the samples on ice to prevent overheating. Sonicate each sample for 6 cycles of 15 s, output 5, and 50% pulse. Allow 15 s rest periods for cooling between cycles.",
    "NOTE: If necessary, transfer the samples into 50 mL conical tubes for further centrifugation (see the Table of Materials). Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C.\nSet aside a fraction of Sonicated MMP for gel analysis. Store it at -80 °C. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to step 1.3.11.\nCheck the pellet. If stringy, repeat steps 1.3.8-1.3.10. If the pellet is compact, discard the supernatant and proceed to step 1.3.12.\n\t\tNOTE: Sonication in Inclusion Body Buffer can be repeated to recover more protein from the lysed cell debris. However, too much sonication can cause shearing, which harms MMP yield. The protocol can be paused at this stage, and the cell pellets can be frozen at -80 °C and thawed later.\nResuspend each pellet from a 1 L culture in 5 mL of Solubilization Buffer (see the Table of Materials) by pipetting. Incubate for at least 30 min on ice to allow the proteins to solubilize.\nSet aside a fraction of Solubilized MMP for gel analysis. Store it at -80 °C. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to step 1.3.14.\nCentrifuge the cells for 10 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C. DO NOT DISCARD THE SUPERNATANT.\nIf a pellet forms/remains after centrifugation, pour the supernatant into a separate 50 mL conical tube. Resuspend the pellet in another 5 mL of Solubilization Buffer (per 1 L of culture) by pipetting up and down.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C. DO NOT DISCARD THE SUPERNATANT.\nRepeat steps 1.3.13 and 1.3.14 until a little to no pellet forms after centrifugation or only gray precipitate remains. Pool the supernatants. Discard or store the pellet at -80 °C for additional sonication.\n2. MMP purification and refolding\nHis-tag (HT) affinity purification",
    "Per the manufacturer's protocol, fill a gravity-flow column (see the Table of Materials) with well-mixed Ni-NTA resin (see the Table of Materials). Allow the resin to settle and separate from the storage buffer such that a distinct line forms between the two layers.\n\t\tNOTE: Never allow the resin to dry, as air will penetrate the resin and harm protein yield. In between uses, perform the resin regeneration procedure described in section 2.2.\nAllow the storage buffer to drain. Fill the column with two resin-bed volumes of HT Equilibration Buffer.\nDrain the HT Equilibration Buffer and discard. As the column is draining, centrifuge the protein extract at 13,000 × g for 1 min and filter-sterilize using a 0.22 µm filter (see the Table of Materials).\nSwap the waste container for a 50 mL conical tube labeled HT Flowthrough. Add the prepared protein extract to the column.\nReapply the flowthrough to maximize binding.\nSet aside a fraction of Flowthrough Fraction for gel analysis. Store it at -80 °C. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to step 2.1.7.\nImmediately wash the resin with 15 mL of HT Wash Buffer (see the Table of Materials). Collect the flowthrough in 15 mL conical tubes (see the Table of Materials) labeled HT Wash.\n\t\tNOTE: Absorbance values at 280 nm (A280) were obtained via spectrophotometry and used along with molecular weight and extinction coefficient, ε, to estimate protein concentrations. For denatured Hisx6-pro-MMP-3cd, the molecular weight is 29.86 kDa, and ε is 34.38 M-1 cm-1.\nBlanking against HT Wash Buffer, measure and record the A280. Repeat steps 2.1.7 and 2.1.8 with additional wash fractions. Once the A280 approaches baseline and impurities have been minimized, proceed to step 2.1.9.",
    "Set aside a fraction of Wash Fraction for gel analysis. Repeat for multiple wash fractions. Store the fractions at -80 °C. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to step 2.1.10.\nImmediately elute His-tagged proteins by adding 5 mL of HT Elution Buffer (see the Table of Materials). Collect the flowthrough as 0.5-1 mL fractions in microfuge tubes labeled HT Elution.\nSet aside a fraction of Elution Fraction for gel analysis. Repeat for multiple elution fractions. Store the fractions at -80 °C. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to step 2.1.12.\nIf the A280 is >0.3 mg/mL, dilute the fraction with HT Equilibration Buffer (see the Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: The eluted fraction must be diluted to an A280 of 0.3 mg/mL or less to prevent precipitation during dialysis. The protocol can be paused here and the pooled fractions frozen at -80 °C and thawed later. Otherwise, skip this step and proceed to step 2.2.1.\nResin regeneration\n\t\nWash the resin with ten resin-bed volumes of HT Regeneration Buffer (see the Table of Materials) and ten resin-bed volumes of sterile water.\nStore the resin as a 50% slurry in 20% (v/v) ethanol in water.\n3. Protein refolding\nNOTE: For smaller volumes, dialysis cassettes can be used at a lower risk of sample loss. Dialysis tubing is required if larger volumes are used (see the Table of Materials).\nDialysis\n\tNOTE: The optimum protein concentration for dialysis is ~0.3 mg/mL. If significant precipitation occurs during dialysis, reduce the urea concentration gradient between each dialysis using a stepwise dialysis method and add more intermediate steps (e.g., from 6 M to 5 M, and then 5 M to 4 M, rather than skipping the 5 M stage). As freeze-thaw cycles damage the cellular and protein structure, it is vital to minimize pauses in the protocol.",
    "Per the manufacturer's protocol, use the appropriate amount of dialysis tubing according to the volume of Elution Fraction samples.\nSubmerge the eluted MMP fractions in dialysis tubing in 1 L of Dialysis Buffer 1 (see the Table of Materials). Stir the tubing and its contents on a magnetic stirrer for no less than 8 h at 4 °C.\nTransfer to 1 L of Dialysis Buffer 2 (see the Table of Materials). Stir the tubing and its contents on a magnetic stirrer for no less than 8 h at 4 °C.\nTransfer to 1 L of Dialysis Buffer 3 (see the Table of Materials). Stir the tubing and its contents on a magnetic stirrer for no less than 8 h at 4 °C.\nTransfer the sample into new 50 mL conical tubes and label them as Dialyzed MMP.\nExamine the tube for any precipitate. If precipitate has formed, centrifuge the sample for 1 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant into new 15 mL conical tubes and label them as Refolded MMP.\nSet aside a fraction for gel analysis and label it as Refolded MMP. Store it at -80 °C. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to step 3.1.9.\n\t\tNOTE: If yields are low, the precipitate can be dissolved in HT Equilibration Buffer and steps in section 3.1 repeated with dialysis tubing. If gel analysis is not to be performed or if the protocol must be paused here, freeze the samples at -80 °C and thaw them later. If yields are in the desired range, proceed to step 3.2.1.\nReconcentration\n\tNOTE: The extinction coefficients for refolded and denatured Hisx6-pro-MMP-3cd are expected to be the same; hence, A280 calculations are not affected.",
    "Reconcentrate the sample up to 0.5 mg/mL. Use a 400 mL stirred cell (see the Table of Materials) to concentrate the sample to 15 mL. To prevent foaming, use a 50 mL reconcentration tube to concentrate further if needed.\n\t\tNOTE: If a precipitate forms, it can be pelleted and dissolved in HT Equilibration Buffer. Then, repeat sections 3.1 and step 3.2.1. Otherwise, continue to step 3.2.2.\nSet aside a fraction for gel analysis and label it as Concentrated MMP.\n\t\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here and the samples frozen at -80 °C and thawed later.\n4. Activation\n4-Aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) activation\n\tNOTE: APMA is highly toxic. Make a fresh stock solution of 20 mM APMA before activation, and always work under a fume hood when using APMA. Discard the APMA waste into its container.\n\t\nPer 1 mL aliquot of MMP (1 mg/mL), add 50 µL of 20 mM APMA (see the Table of Materials) to reach a final APMA concentration of 1 mM. Incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nIf a precipitate forms, centrifuge it at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C. Store the supernatant in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube labeled Activated MMP. Discard the precipitate into a container marked for APMA waste.\nSet aside a fraction for gel analysis and label it Activated MMP.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here and the samples frozen at -80 °C and thawed later. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to step 4.2.1. After activation, the molecular weight and extinction coefficient of MMP-3cd are 19.40 kDa and 28.42 M-1 cm-1, respectively.\nDesalting\n\t\nRemove APMA from the activated MMP-3cd sample with a 2 mL desalting column (see the Table of Materials), following the manufacturer's protocol.",
    "Set aside a fraction for gel analysis and label it Desalted MMP. Store it at -80 °C. If not performing gel analysis, proceed to section 4.3 with the remaining samples.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here and the samples frozen at -80 °C and thawed later.\nRunning the SDS-PAGE gels\n\t\nRun all protein fractions on SDS-PAGE gels: Un-induced Fraction, Induced Fraction, Lysed MMP, Sonicated MMP, Solubilized MMP, Flowthrough Fraction, Wash Fraction, Elution Fraction, Refolded MMP, Concentrated MMP, Activated MMP, and Desalted MMP.\nLong-term storage of MMP-3\n\t\nAdd 0.05% (v/v) nonionic surfactant (see the Table of Materials) to the desalted MMP-3cd samples and store them at -80 °C.\nSubscription Required.
