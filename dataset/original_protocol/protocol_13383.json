    "1. General preparation of TEM grids pre-support transfer\nUsing a pair of clean, fine tweezers, lift and submerge TEM grids sequentially in double-distilled water (ddH2O) or ultrapure water for 10-15 s, followed by ethyl acetate, for 10-15 s.\n\tNOTE: Here, negative-action, oblique-tip tweezers were used.\nPlace the tweezers, with grid still in grip, to one side to air-dry for ~5 min.\nPlasma-clean the grids to strip the surface of any contaminants accrued through the air or washing steps.\n\tNOTE: Here, plasma-cleaning was done for 10-15 s in air with a radiofrequency power of 25 W.\n2. General preparation of reagent solutions\nUranyl acetate (UAc) solution (2% w/v)\n\t\nWrap a 50 mL tube in foil, fill with 50 mL of ultrapure water, and add 1 g of UAc powder.\n\t\tNOTE: UAc is light-sensitive and precipitates over time when exposed. As UAc is radioactive and toxic, maintain a high level of cleanliness. With the most serious hazard arising from inhalation or ingestion, extra care should be taken to prevent any possibility of inhaling fine particles. Gloves must always be worn when handling or weighing out the uranium salts. Masks and goggles highly recommended. Uranium salts must be disposed of according to the legal requirements set out for radioactive hazards within the state.\nLeave the solution stirring for 1 h to allow for all the UAc to dissolve. Store at 4°C.\nBefore use, filter 1 mL of the stain solution into a small vial using 0.22 µm filter to remove any remaining acetate crystals.\nGraphene oxide (GrOx) suspension\n\t\nPipette 2.5 µL of GrOx into a 1.5 mL tube (1% final concentration). Pipette 2.5 µL of 10% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) detergent into the GrOx, and gently mix (0.1% (w/v) final concentration).",
    "Add 245 µL of ultrapure water to the GrOx-DDM mix, and immediately vortex vigorously for 5 min. Use GrOx suspension within 1 h of preparation, vortex vigorously for at least 1 min before immediate use.\nIron(III) chloride (FeCl3) solution (10% w/v)\n\t\nCarefully weigh 5 g of FeCl3 in a weighing boat. Transfer to a 100 mL measuring cylinder containing 35 mL of ddH2O and a magnetic stir bar.\nPlace on a magnetic stirring plate, and dissolve FeCl3, adding ddH2O to a final volume of 50 mL. Filter the FeCl3 solution through a 0.8 µm syringe filter into a clean bottle for storage.\n\t\tNOTE: FeCl3 is corrosive and an irritant; wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving work. Provide good ventilation in process area to prevent formation of vapor. Do not breathe mist, vapors, spray. Gloves must always be worn when handling or weighing out the salt. Masks and goggles highly recommended whenever in use.\n3. Buffer exchange for carbon support films on mica to prepare negatively stained samples using the support floatation block\nWash and plasma-clean TEM grids.\n\tNOTE: Here, 300 mesh holey-carbon copper grids were used as outlined above in section 1.\nPipette 10-12 µL of sample into the buffer exchange well (with the small channels) of the floatation block and 10-12 µL of 2% UAc solution (see section 2.1) for negative staining into the adjacent non-buffer exchange well.\n\tNOTE: The well has a volume of 10 µL; however, adjust the sample volume so that a convex meniscus is formed at the surface of the liquid to allow proper film floatation. A low volume of sample may cause film breakage.",
    "Carefully cut two small pieces of mica with predeposited carbon film on top. Ensure that the mica fragments are wide enough to fit into the well (3.4 mm width) and longer than the well length (3.45 mm), such that the fragment will sit on the well while carbon is floating, and there is enough space to handle the fragment with the tweezers.\n\tNOTE: To handle the carbon, use flat negative-action long-tip tweezers. When cutting the mica fragments, cut using single movements to maintain the integrity of the carbon film.\nImmerse the mica into the well with an approximate angle of 45° until the mica sits on the ramp of the well and a layer of carbon is observed at the surface of the liquid sample.\nAfter the initial incubation on sample (typically 20 s to 20 min depending on the sample adherence; optimize this period based on experimental needs), withdraw the mica sheet very slowly to recover the carbon film and minimize residual viscous sample retention.\nCarefully blot the mica by tapping the lower surface (non-carbon side) with filter paper to remove excess liquid, and subsequently exchange the carbon bearing the sample into negative stain by application to the opposing well (i.e., immerse the mica as in step 3.4) containing the 2% UAc solution.\n\tNOTE: A carbon layer should be observed floating on top of the stain solution at this point.\nRecover the floating carbon layer with the holey carbon-covered side of a washed and plasma-cleaned EM grid. Leave the grids to air-dry until imaging on a TEM. Ideally, cover the grids during the drying process to avoid airborne contamination.\n4. Application of the support floatation block to prepare graphene oxide-coated TEM grids\nWash and plasma-clean TEM grids using 300 mesh holey-carbon copper grids as outlined above (section 1).",
    "Pipette 10-12 µL of GrOx suspension (see section 2.2) into the 4 non-buffer exchange wells along the floatation block. Pipette 10-12 µL ddH2O or ultrapure water into the remaining 4 buffer exchange wells of the block.\n\tNOTE: This volume of water should be sufficient to form a slight convex meniscus rising above the height of the block.\nDrop 4 grids gently onto the GrOx suspension of each well for 1 min, ensuring that the holey carbon-covered side makes contact with the solution. After 1 min, recover each grid carefully by sliding the tweezers into the tweezer groove of each non-buffer exchange well.\nVery gently and briefly touch the copper, non-carbon-covered side of each grid to the ddH2O in the adjacent well. Then, carefully and gently hold the grid, water droplet-side down, against a piece of filter paper.\n\tNOTE: Blotting off the water will draw the GrOx suspension through the grid by capillary action. It is crucial to avoid submerging the grid in the ddH2O, so contact should be very brief. When the grid is lifted, a droplet of water should hold to the underside of the grid. Take care not to move the grid on the filter paper as this could upset the settling of the GrOx flakes.\nLeave the grids in the tweezers to air-dry until preparation with sample. Ideally, cover the grids during the drying process to avoid airborne contamination.\n5. Application of the support floatation block for the preparation of samples on monolayer-graphene films\nWash the TEM grids as outlined above (section 1), but omitting plasma-cleaning.\n\tNOTE: Here, 300 mesh holey-carbon gold grids were used, but other non-copper grids or copper alloy grids are also practicable.\nTo deposit grids with graphene, directly transfer from graphene grown on copper (Cu-graphene) substrates to cryo-EM grids, as described previously25.",
    "Place four washed grids on top of a Cu-graphene sheet (10 mm × 10 mm) deposited onto a glass slide, and cover each grid with a drop of isopropanol (5-10 µL) to allow intimate contact between the monolayer graphene and the grid.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure to place the holey carbon-covered side of the grids in contact with the graphene sheet.\nWhen the isopropanol is completely evaporated (typically 2 h), float the Cu-graphene sheet with grids onto 10% (w/v) FeCl3 solution (see section 2.3) in a glass Petri dish, and leave to etch at room temperature overnight. Cover the dish to avoid airborne contamination.\n\t\tNOTE: After etching is complete, only the graphene monolayer will remain floating on the FeCl3 solution-this should be visible by eye with suitable lighting.\nUse a loop with diameter larger than the TEM grid size to fish the grids floating on the graphene monolayer, and carefully transfer to a glass Petri dish containing ddH2O to wash.\n\t\tNOTE: Be extremely cautious when fishing the grids to avoid hitting the walls of the Petri dish, which may cause graphene film breakage or bending.\nWash two more times in water by fishing grids and transferring to a clean Petri dish containing ddH2O to remove all residual FeCl3. Finally, transfer grids into a Petri dish containing sample buffer until sample preparation and plunge-freezing.\n\t\t​NOTE: The graphene-covered side of the grids must be kept wetted at all times to avoid their exposure to airborne contaminants.\nPipette the sample (10-12 µL) into a non-buffer exchange well of the floatation block. When the sample is ready in the block, pick a graphene-coated grid from the buffer solution using a pair of clean tweezers, and place onto the surface of the sample-containing well.",
    "After an appropriate incubation period (1-5 min depending on the sample; optimize according to experimental needs), pick the grid with a pair of clean freezing tweezers, and proceed with blotting and vitrification."
