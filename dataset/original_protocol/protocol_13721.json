  "procedures": [
    "All experimental procedures described here have been carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Southern Methodist University.\n1. Coating the multielectrode array (MEA) for recording\nMake 25 mM borate buffer.\n\t\nDissolve 0.953 g of Na2B4O7·10 H2O in 80 mL of distilled water.\nAdjust the pH to 8.4 with HCl and then add distilled water to a final volume of 100 mL.\nMake a 0.1% stock solution of polyethyleneimine (PEI).\n\t\nAdd 100 µL of 50% (w/v) PEI to 4.9 mL of distilled water to make a 1% PEI solution.\nDilute the 1% PEI solution to 0.1% in borate buffer by adding 1 mL of the 1% PEI solution to 9 mL of the 25 mM borate buffer.\nPipette ~1 mL of the 0.1% PEI solution into the microelectrode array (MEA) dish so that the electrodes are completely covered (Figure 1A and 1B).\n\tNOTE: The microelectrodes of the MEA are typically composed of platinum black or carbon nanotube and insulated with polyimide (or acrylic); both materials are hydrophobic. By coating the MEA with a cationic polymer such as PEI, the hydrophobic MEA surface is made more hydrophilic, allowing tissue samples to make better contact with the MEA surface (Figure 1A1).\nCover the MEA dish with thermoplastic film to reduce evaporation and leave the MEA overnight at room temperature (Figure 1C).\nAspirate the PEI solution from the MEA dish using a pipette, being careful not to touch the electrode grid which can damage the electrodes, and then rinse ≥4 times with distilled water (Figure 1D).",
    "Store the PEI-coated MEA under 1-2 mL of ultrapure water and sealed with thermoplastic film at 4 °C until needed. Alternatively, store the coated MEA by submerging it in a beaker filled with ultrapure water (Figure 1E).\n\tNOTE: The PEI coating process only needs to be performed once for the MEA before its first use, and after each recording session, the MEA should be stored submerged in ultrapure water.\n2. Preparing complete Tyrode's solution for tissue dissection\nMake 1,000 mL of complete Tyrode's solution for dissection; first, add 8.1816 g of NaCl to 800 mL of ultrapure water.\nAdd the following amount of chemicals to the solution: 0.4025 g of KCl; 0.1633 g of KH2PO4; 1.1915 g of HEPES; 0.9999 g of glucose; 0.0952 g of MgCl2; 0.2646 g of CaCl2·2H2O.\nAdjust the pH to 7.4 with NaOH and then add ultrapure water until the total volume is 1,000 mL.\n\tNOTE: The final composition of the Complete Tyrode's solution will be the following (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 5 HEPES, 5.55 glucose, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2.\n3. Preparing oxygenated Tyrode's solution for recording\nMake 500 mL of Tyrode's solution; add 4.003 g of NaCl to 400 mL of ultrapure water.\nAdd the following amounts of chemicals to the solution: 0.651 g of NaHCO3; 0.042 g of NaH2PO4; 0.132 g of CaCl2·2H2O; 0.149 g of KCl; 0.0476 g of MgCl2; 0.999 g of glucose.\nAdjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl and then add ultrapure water until the total volume is 500 mL.\nOxygenate the solution with carbogen for at least 30 min at room temperature before starting the recording.",
    "​NOTE: The final composition of the Tyrode's solution will be the following (in mM): 137 NaCl, 15.5 NaHCO3, 0.7 NaH2PO4, 1.8 CaCl2, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 11.1 glucose. This Tyrode's solution has a slightly different composition from the Complete Tyrode's solution used for dissection.\n4. Preparing 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) solution for pharmacological modulation\nMake a 1 mM working solution of 4-AP; add 18.82 mg of 4-AP to 200 mL of the Tyrode's solution from step 3.\nOxygenate the 4-AP solution for at least 30 min before the experiment.\n5. Preparing the Petri dish for dissection\nMix silicone elastomer components in a 10:1 ratio (by weight) of the base to curing agent.\nPour ~15 mL of silicone elastomer mixture into a 60 mm diameter Petri dish.\nAllow elastomer to cure at room temperature for 48 h before use.\n\t​NOTE: The siliconized Petri dish can be reused for future dissections.\n6. Dissecting the sinoatrial node (SAN)\nPrepare heparinized Complete Tyrode's solution for SAN dissection.\n\t\nAdd 400 µL of heparin (1,000 USP/mL) to 40 mL of Complete Tyrode's solution and warm in a 37 °C water bath.\nInject the mouse intraperitoneally with 200-300 μL of heparin (1000 USP/mL) and allow the animal to sit for 10 min.\nEuthanize the heparinized mouse by isoflurane overdose.\n\t\nPlace the mouse in a small glass chamber that contains isoflurane vapors generated by adding 200-300 μL of liquid isoflurane to a filter paper inside a perforated plastic tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Because isoflurane can cause skin irritation and can also be absorbed through the skin, the liquid should not contact the mouse directly. Therefore, the isoflurane-soaked wipe is placed in a perforated tube for administration.",
    "Verify death by cessation of movement and breathing effort and by the absence of a toe pinch reflex. Death usually takes about 1-2 min following placement into the chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: Death is usually accompanied by urination.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on a dissection board with paws outstretched and fix the paws to the board using 1 inch long, 23-gauge syringe needles. Then remove the fur in the vicinity of the bottom of the rib cage by using surgical scissors and cutting the fur at the roots.\n\tNOTE: For a dissection board, polystyrene cooler lids can be used.\nWhile holding the skin with a hemostat, use surgical scissors to make a transverse incision in the skin just beneath the bottom of the rib cage from about the left costal arch to the right costal arch (Figure 3A).\nCut open the peritoneum with surgical scissors and carefully separate the liver from the diaphragm, being careful not to nick the liver, which will cause excessive bleeding (Figure 3B). Incise the diaphragm along the thorax to expose the thoracic cavity (Figure 3C-D).\nUsing surgical scissors, cut the lateral walls of the rib cage from the edges of the costal arches up to the clavicles to expose the heart, being careful to avoid damaging the heart (Figure 3D). Then use a 23-gauge syringe needle to pin the rib cage over the shoulder, holding it in place and out of the way of the surgical field.\nUse a transfer pipette to drip warm (37 °C) heparinized Complete Tyrode's solution onto the heart to keep it moist.\n\tNOTE: Do not allow the heart to dry out.\nRemove the lungs by holding them with extra fine Graefe forceps and severing the trachea with surgical scissors (Figure 3E).",
    "Hold the apex of the heart with extra fine Graefe forceps and remove it by cutting the aorta and venae cavae with surgical scissors. Transfer the heart to a Petri dish containing cured silicone elastomer (Figure 4A) and use a transfer pipette to bathe the heart with 2-3 mL of warm (37 °C) heparinized Complete Tyrode's solution.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to damage the delicate posterior wall of the right atria, which contains the SAN, and the connected right atrial veins. Bathing the heart with Complete Tyrode's solution keeps the heart from drying out but do not fully submerge the heart in solution as it will impair visibility during dissection.\nOrient the heart with the right atrium on the experimenter's right and the left atrium on the experimenter's left.\n\tNOTE: Dissection of the SAN tissue should be done quickly in order to prevent ischemia-related injury.\nAttach the apex of the heart to the dish with a dissection pin. Then, while holding the inferior vena cava with Dumont #2 laminectomy forceps, insert a 22 G syringe needle through the inferior and superior vena cava to locate their position in the right atrium, which also identifies the approximate position of the SAN (located in the patch of tissue between the inferior and superior vena cava (Figure 4B).\nUsing small dissection pins, pin the left and right atrial appendages to the dish.\n\t\nWhile holding the left atrial appendage with Dumont #2 laminectomy forceps, put a dissection pin through the left atrial appendage to hold it in place.\nWhile holding the right atrial appendage with Dumont #55 forceps, put a dissection pin through the right atrial appendage to hold it in place.\n\t\tNOTE: The same type of forceps can be used to hold the left and right atrial appendages if desired.",
    "Remove the syringe needle that spans the venae cavae.\nTo release blood from the heart, use Castroviejo scissors to remove the apex of the heart (i.e., the bottom half) by making a transverse incision across the ventricles (Figure 4C). Then, wash the heart by adding warm (37 °C) heparinized Complete Tyrode's solution with a transfer pipette.\nUse Castroviejo scissors to cut along the atrioventricular septum keeping the incision closer to the ventricle than the atria. Continue cutting along the atrioventricular septum until the atria are separated from the ventricles.\nCut along the interatrial septum to remove the left atrium.\nPlace dissection pins in the periphery of the right atrium to make it lay flat (Figure 4D). Remove any remaining fat, vessels, or tissue from the atrium using the Castroviejo scissors.\nLocate the SAN in the right atrium, which in this orientation is approximately bordered by the superior vena cava (on the top), inferior vena cava (on the bottom), and cristae terminalis (on the left) (Figure 4D).\n\t​NOTE: The crista terminalis appears as a dark muscular ridge between the right atrial appendage and the SAN. Often the SAN artery can also be seen coursing through the SAN (Figure 4D).\n7. Preparing the MEA system for recording\nAdd Tyrode's solution (from step 3) to the input solution bottle (Figure 5C) and oxygenate it by turning on the flow of carbogen gas (Figure 5A) to the system.\n\tNOTE: The Tyrode's solution used for the recording is slightly different in composition from the Complete Tyrode's solution used for the dissection.\nVerify the flow of carbogen by observing bubbles in the conical flask, which is used to humidify the gas (Figure 5B), and the input solution bottle (Figure 5C) .",
    "Insert the peristaltic pump inflow tubing (Figure 5D) into the Tyrode's recording solution (Figure 5C). Then, insert the peristaltic pump outflow tubing into the collection bottle (Figure 5I).\nSet the peristaltic pump to 25 rpm, which gives a flow rate of 2 mL/min and start the pump. Check the system for any buffer leakage or overflow.\nSet the temperature controller to 37 °C, the physiological temperature of mice (Figure 5E).\n8. Placing the heart tissue on the MEA grid\nTransfer the dissected SAN tissue with the help of a paint brush (Figure 6A) from the dissecting Petri dish onto the MEA grid (Figure 1A1).\n\t\nWhile looking under an inverted microscope, gently position the tissue with a soft paint brush so that the SAN region overlays the electrode grid.\nRe-position the tissue as necessary to ensure it lays flat on the electrode grid, making good contact with the electrodes.\n\t\tNOTE: A soft paint brush is required for moving the tissue to avoid damaging the electrode grid.\nOnce the tissue is correctly positioned, use bone forceps (or any curved forceps) to place the mesh over the tissue (Figure 6A) . Then use the bone forceps to place the harp anchor (Figure 6A) on the mesh to hold everything in place (Figure 6B).\nTake a picture of the positioning of the tissue on the MEA so that the activity of individual electrodes can be correlated with their anatomical location during the recording. This can be done by holding a smartphone up to the inverted microscope objective or by using an attached microscope camera.\n\tNOTE: If the orientation of the MEA is not changed after taking the picture, the top left electrode will appear as the first channel (Ch1) during recording.",
    "Place the MEA dish on the connector plate (Figure 5F and 6C) and carefully place the perfusion cap (Figure 6C) on the MEA dish without disturbing the harp slice anchor. The perfusion cap can be further secured using a piece of lab tape (Figure 6C).\n\tNOTE: In addition to having adjustable solution inflow and outflow pipes, the cap also has a port for the delivery of gas (Figure 6C). In addition, the reference electrode ring runs through the cap (Figure 6C).\nAllow the tissue to recover from handling and to acclimate to the chamber for 15-20 min prior to recording.\n9. Setting the data acquisition protocol for recording\nNOTE: The following steps describe opening the software protocol for spontaneous beat recording and defining the recording conditions. The specifics of these steps may vary depending on the specific software being used, but the general outline should remain the same.\nTurn on the amplifier (Figure 5G), and set up a workflow for the recording in the software on the computer (Figure 5H).\n\t\nOpen the software and click on the Workflow.\nSelect Open New Folder.\nOpen the From Templates folder.\nSelect 64MD1-1920X1080 (depending on the resolution of your desktop).\nOpen the QT folder.\nOpen the Spontaneous recording folder.\nSelect Beat_recording.moflo template and open it (Figure 7A).\nSet the recording parameters to specify the number of traces, trace duration, trace interval, input voltage, sampling rate, etc., according to the desired recording conditions (Figure 7B).\n\tNOTE: For beat frequency and interspike data acquisition, typically use an input range voltage of 2.9 mV, a 1-Hz high pass filter, a 1000-Hz low pass filter, and a sampling rate of 20 kHz.",
    "To mark different phases or conditions of the experiment, such as before and after drug administration, click on the Annotations tab to add the desired notations (Figure 7C).\nTo specify the file destination for the data to be collected, select the Enable Storage box and enter the desired file name in the File name modifier box.\n10. Performing the recording and collecting data\nClick the Record and Play button on the topmost menu bar of the acquisition software to start the recording. Acquire data for 10 traces of 1 min duration with intervals of 2 min between traces.\nFrom these initial traces, verify that the recorded waveforms are consistent with a healthy and high-quality tissue preparation by confirming that the majority of the recording channels exhibit signal amplitudes of ≥ 0.5 mV and identical inter-spike intervals (Figure 8).\n\tNOTE: An initial assessment of the activity and waveforms of the individual microelectrodes corresponding to their anatomical locations can be performed by referencing the picture acquired after positioning the tissue on the MEA.\nTo measure the effects of drugs on the tissue, pause the recording after acquiring initial baseline data by clicking the pause button on the topmost menu bar.\n\tNOTE: The drug response phase of the experiment can be notated in the recording by clicking on the Annotations tab and adding the desired notation as described above (Figure 7C).\nPause the pump and switch the pump inflow tubing from the normal recording solution to Tyrode's solution containing the desired drug of choice.\n\tNOTE: In the example experiment, Tyrode's solution was used with 1 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP).\nRestart the pump and un-pause the recording to begin collecting data again.\nOnce the drug-infused Tyrode's solution has reached the tissue, record 10 traces in the same manner as done previously for the baseline recordings.",
    "NOTE: The traces will take some time to stabilize as the drug infuses into the recording chamber. The mechanism of action of the drug may also affect recording stability. For drugs that have reversible mechanisms of action, a washout period should also be recorded to confirm restoration of activity to baseline levels, which is an indicator of healthy tissue.\nClick Stop to conclude the recordings.\nTake a final picture of the positioning of the tissue on the MEA under the microscope in case the tissue has shifted following the initial recording setup procedure.\n11. Cleaning the setup after the recording\nClean the MEA.\n\t\nAfter finishing recording, gently remove the recording solution from the MEA dish using a 1 mL micropipette.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to contact the MEA electrodes which can damage them.\nRemove the mesh and harp anchor with bone forceps (or any curved forceps). Then use a paint brush to dislodge the tissue from the MEA surface always being careful not to touch the individual microelectrodes.\nUsing a wash bottle, gently rinse the MEA dish with ultrapure water about 3 to 4 times.\nStore the cleaned MEA immersed in ultrapure water at 4 °C.\nRinse the system tubing by running ultrapure water through it for at least 5 min using the maximum speed setting on the peristaltic pump.\n\t​NOTE: To prevent fungal growth, no water or buffer solution should be left inside the tubing after cleaning.\n12. Analyzing the MEA recordings to measure SAN beat frequency\nOpen the saved recorded data file in the \"Beat_frequency_analysis\" template of the analysis software (Figure 9) .\nClick on the Play button and allow the entire recording to run to visualize the data set and assign appropriate analysis parameters.",
    "Select the binning window for the desired display format of the data, whether it is displayed as an average per trace or average per time (Figure 10A).\nSelect the channels to be included in the analysis and set the desired amplitude maxima or amplitude minima threshold values for automated waveform peak identification (Figure 10B).\n\t\tNOTE: An individual channel, a combination of channels, or all 64 channels can be selected for analysis at this step (Figure 9). If the threshold values selected are too close to the waveform's maxima and minima values, some waveform peaks may not be identified by the analysis software.\nSet the amount of pre-spike and post-spike time to be included in the analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Settings of 50 ms pre-spike and 100 ms post-spike usually work well (Figure 10B).\nAfter setting the analysis conditions, click on the Play button again to rerun the data set and confirm that the analysis parameters are appropriate for spike extraction.\nFor analysis, identify the three most stable consecutive traces that exhibit stable beating rate for each trace across the majority of channels both during the baseline period of the experiment and another three consecutive stable traces during the drug exposure period (Figure 10A).\nSpecify the start and end traces for analysis and enter the time duration of each trace to be analyzed (Figure 9).\nBefore starting the analysis, select the enable boxes for both Save beat per minute and Save interspike interval (Figure 10B).\nEnter the desired file name in the File name modifier box (Figure 10B). The analyzed data for beat frequency and interspike interval will be saved in the form of ASCII (text) format.\n\tNOTE: To analyze different conditions (such as baseline and drug response), analysis must be run separately for each condition.",
    "Click the Play and Record button on the top tab bar to start the analysis.\nTo export the data for other applications, select the boxes for Save beat per minute and Save interspike interval (Figure 10B). Enter the desired file name in the File name modifier box (Figure 10B) and click Save to save the analyzed data in ASCII text format in the selected folder.\nSubscription Required.
