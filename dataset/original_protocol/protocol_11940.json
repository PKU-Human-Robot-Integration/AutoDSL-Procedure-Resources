    "All procedures on animal subjects have been approved by the institutional animal ethics committees of the federal states of Hamburg and Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany.  Use sterile instruments, protective gloves and aseptic coats throughout the entire surgical procedure.\n1. In Utero Transduction\nPrepare adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV1) coding for the desired target (4 x 1011 viral particles/µL of AAV1) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. Add 0.1 mg/µL Fast Green and keep the AAV1-Fast-Green mixture at 37 °C.\nPrepare a thin capillary tip with the desired shape (8 mm in length, with an outside diameter of 80 µm and an inside diameter of 50 µm), using a micropipette puller (settings: pressure = 500, heat = 700, pull = 0, velocity = 80, time = 200, see the Table of Materials). Break the tip of the capillary so that it is 4-5 mm.\nAssemble an aspirator tube (44 cm x 0.7 cm) with the capillary tip and aspirate 15 µL of the AAV1-Fast-Green mixture into the capillary.\nKeep the animal subjects at a constant physiological body temperature of 37 °C throughout the entire procedure.\nPlace a pregnant C57Bl/6 mouse (embryonic day 14.5) into the preincubation chamber and anesthetize the mouse with gaseous 4% isoflurane (with a volumetric airflow rate of 0.6-0.8 L/min).\nSubcutaneously, inject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg of body weight).\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on the prewarmed surgical plate (37 °C).\nCover the eyes with a lubricant.\nFit the mouse with the anesthesia mask (gaseous 1.5 % isoflurane at a volumetric airflow rate of 0.6-0.8 L/min)on the surgical plate and shave the abdominal skin region. Wipe the shaved region with 3X 75% ethanol and then with betadine solution.",
    "NOTE: Monitor the breathing behavior of the anesthetized mouse continuously. Adjust the concentration of the isoflurane gas according to the inhalation-exhalation pattern of the mouse.\nCheck for the absence of the plantar reflex by squeezing the hind paw phalanges of the mouse.\nOpen the abdominal cavity by gripping the skin with curved serrated iris forceps (10 cm) and cutting the skin along the linea mediana with straight tungsten carbide scissors (10 cm), and then, by gripping the peritoneal wall with straight Dumont tweezers (12 cm, 0.2 mm x 0.12 mm) and cutting the wall along the linea alba with straight Vanna's scissors (8 cm).\nPlace a piece of fenestrated paraffin film on the abdominal opening and fix the film on both ends with micro-mosquito hemostatic forceps (12.5 cm, curved).\nExpose the uterine horns with a spoon-like device to avoid damage to the embryos inside the uterine horns. Drip a few drops of PBS (37 °C) on the uterine horns and inspect the embryos for damages or malformations inside the uterine sac.\nDocument the order and position of the embryos in the uterine horns. Turn the embryos carefully inside the uterine sac until the desired position for injection is reached.\nInject 1-2 µL of the AAV1-Fast-Green mixture by visually inspecting the injection site (e.g., brain ventricles) and the dye penetration under a stereomicroscope.\nDocument the injected embryos and place the uterine horns with the injected embryos back into the abdominal cavity.\nDrip a few drops of PBS (37 °C) into the abdominal cavity. Close the cavity by suturing the peritoneal wall (use polyamide 6-0-sized sutures) and the skin (use polyamide 3-0-sized sutures), using Halsted's mosquito hemostatic forceps (12.5 cm, curved). Alternatively, use a simple interrupted pattern or stainless-steel suture/staples to close the abdominal cavity and the skin.",
    "2. Telemacrophotography of Isolated Tissues\nPreparation of buffers\nPrepare Sörensen's buffer (1 L) by dissolving 14.95 g of Na2HPO4 and 2.18 g of KH2PO4 in 1 L of distilled water under stirring at 200 rpm. For perfusion of late gestation pups and/or pups in the post-natal time periods, use an appropriate size of needles for abdominal or intragastric injection and make sure that the concentration of the terminal sodium pentobarbital anesthesia does not exceed 180 mg/kg of body weigh.\nPrepare Mugnaini's fixation solution (5 L) by heating 500 mL of distilled water to 75 °C and adding 50 g of paraformaldehyde powder under stirring at 200 rpm, adding 200 µL of 5 N NaOH, adding 1,500 mL of Sörensen's buffer, 1,750 mL of distilled water, and 500 mL of 25% glutaraldehyde. Fill up to 5,000 mL with distilled water. Use this final buffer for perfusion.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare Mugnaini's fixation solution under the hood, wear protective glasses, and avoid fumes. Add methylene blue (0.05 g/L) for a better visualization of the perfusion.\nMouse perfusion and tissue isolation\nTranscardially perfuse the pregnant mice that carry the transduced embryos (in the case of embryo studies) or the born transduced pubs at the desired age (e.g., postnatal day 24) according to standard procedures6,7,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, using intraperitoneal terminal sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (200 mg/kg of body weight).\nInject the mice transcardially with heparin solution (500 U) using a 26 G, 1 in needle and, before fixation, infuse the mice transcardially with 10 mL of PBS to flush out the blood from the body, and perfuse them transcardially with 30 mL of 40 °C prewarmed Mugnaini's fixation solution.\nNOTE: For adult mice, perform an alternative retrograde perfusion via the abdominal aorta14.",
    "Isolate the perfused tissue of interest (e.g., whole brain or spinal cord) and postfix the tissue in at least 10 mL of Mugnaini's fixation solution for another 24 h at 4 °C.\nWash the tissue in 10 mL of PBS for 3 h at room temperature.\nEmbedding in agarose, plus documentation and sectioning\nAdjust the isolated tissue (e.g., whole brain) in a special frame with a reproducible sectioning angle8,9,10. Alternatively, use a vibratome with an adjustable cutting thickness.\nPlace the nervous tissue in the frame, adjust the tissue for telemacrography, and document the coordinates.\nPrepare 3% low-melting agarose-embedding medium: add 3 g of agarose in 100 mL of Sörensen's buffer and heat the mixture in a water bath to 90 °C.\nPour 3% agarose (30 °C) in the frame that contains the tissue. Cover the frame with a warm metal block and wait until it is hardening. During hardening, use telemacrographic devices to image the embedded tissue and its coordinates within the frame.\nTransfer the agarose-embedded tissue into a frame with cutting gaps corresponding to the coordinates of the first frame.\nCut the embedded tissue into sections of desired thickness (e.g., 1.5 mm) with a device with a thin and vibrating razor blade (see Table of Materials).\nNOTE: To improve the gliding of the razor blade, drip a few drops of glycerin onto the embedded tissue.\nImage each tissue section in PBS and collect the images into a folder.\n3. Preparation of the Isolated Tissue for Transmission Electron Microscopy\nNOTE: Perform all further steps of incubation in glass dishes with tightly closable lids on a shaking platform under the hood.\nWash the tissue sections for 2x 30 min in PBS. Incubate the sections in 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide solution (OsO4) for 2 h at room temperature.",
    "CAUTION: Osmium tetroxide is toxic and may be harmful when it comes in contact with skin.\nWash the osmicated sections for 2x 30 min in PBS.\nIncubate the sections in 30%, 50%, and 70% ethanol at room temperature for 10-15 min (optional: incubate in 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight).\nImage the osmicated specimens in 70% ethanol under LED RGB light8,9,10 (2x 15 W) applied to the sample from the left and right side at an angle of 45°. Use black dishes and a dull black background to minimize scattering and the reflection of the light during illumination.\nCAUTION: Do not allow the section to dry out during imaging.\nCreate an atlas of the section images with coordinates by collecting images in series in a folder.\nIncubate the specimens in 100% ethanol (2x for 30 min) and 100% propylene oxide (2x for 30 min) at room temperature.\nCAUTION: Do not allow the sections to dry out while changing solutions.\nMix 260 mL of resin with 240 mL of dodecenylsuccinic anhydride in a glass vessel while gently stirring with a glass bar. Periodically check for inhomogeneity, bubbles, and smears. Very gently, stir by hand for at least 45 min.\nPrepare resin/propylene oxide in a ratio of 1:2 and 1:1 and add 3% accelerator (2,4,6-Tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol).\nIncubate the tissue in the 1:2 embedding solution from step 3.8 for 2 h and then in the 1:1 embedding solution from step 3.8 for 2 h at room temperature on a rotating wheel.\nPlace the tissue in flat polypropylene dishes, cover the tissue with fresh resin containing 3% accelerator, and cure the embedded tissue at 65-85 °C for 12-24 h.\nCool down the embedded tissue to room temperature and remove the resin-embedded specimens from the polypropylene dishes.\n4. Selection of Ultrastructural Neuroplasticity Parameters for Quantitative Analysis",
    "Mapping the area of interest\nChoose an area of interest (e.g., hippocampus or cerebellum) and localize the area in the section atlas by choosing the image from the atlas (step 3.5) that contains this area.\nSketch the borders of the area of interest onto the section image and find/superimpose these region borders onto the resin specimen.\nScratch-mark the borders of the area of interest (e.g., hippocampus or cerebellum) on the resin specimen, using a fine needle gauge (26 G, 1 in).\nHeat the resin specimen to 85 °C in an oven to soften the resin for trimming or, alternatively, use a trimming device, a thin blade, or sandpaper.\nExcise the area of interest from the resin specimen with a razor blade (see Table of Materials). Mount the specimen on holding bars of acrylic glass of the required caliber (e.g., with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of 1 cm) with glue. Trim the mounted specimen for semi- and ultrathin sectioning.\nPrepare semithin (0.75 µm) and ultrathin (70 nm) sections of the trimmed area using an ultramicrotome: set it at 1.5 mm/s for 0.75 µm thickness and at 0.7 mm/s for 70 nm thickness.\nCollect the semithin sections on glass carriers and stain the sections with 1% toluidine blue in PBS (for 4 min).\nWash the sections several times in deionized water. Examine the stained sections under the light microscope using 4x (NA of 0.1 ∞/-), 10x (NA of 0.22 ∞/0.17), 40x (NA of 0.65 ∞/0.17), and 100x (NA of 1.25 ∞/0.17) objectives.\nCollect ultrathin sections on nickel grids. Subject the grids to TEM at 180 kV and at 3,200x, 6,000x, and/or 8,000x magnification.\nTEM Analysis",
    "Choose the ultrastructural parameters of interest for quantitative TEM analysis (e.g., boutons with vesicles and mitochondria or myelinated and nonmyelinated axons) and take TEM images of these parameters under 3,500x, 6,000x and/or 8,000x magnification.\nSubscription Required.
