    "All methods described here have been approved by ethics committee of Beijing Hospital. Indications for surgery are according to the European Association of Urology guidelines for nonneurogenic male LUTS. Contraindications include suspected prostate cancer or detrusor dysfunction.\n1. Instruments for operation\nEnsure the availability of diode laser (980 nm) equipment with a power including continuous mode (80-100 W).\nEmploy a laser fiber and 0.9% saline solution for intraoperative bladder irrigation.\nUse a 26 F laser resectoscope to acquire good visualization and enhance efficiency.\n2. Preparation for operation\nPerform skin preparation on the day of the operation.\nProvide an intravenous antibiotic preoperatively to all patients10.\n\tNOTE: Cefuroxime sodium (1.5 g in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride) is provided 30 min before the operation.\nBefore anesthesia, make the patient lay down on the operating table.\n\tNOTE: General anesthesia is effective and appropriate for this operation. The anesthetists should determine the mode of anesthesia depending on the patient's general condition.\nDrape the patient in a sterile fashion in the dorsal lithotomy position.\n3. Procedure steps\nObservation\n\t\nDirectly observe the urethra, verumontanum, bladder neck, ureteral orifices, bladder mucosa, and trabecular hyperplasia by resectoscope (15-30Â°).\nDesign the range of enucleation (Cupid's arrow).\n\t\nCircularly incise (depth to gland, width about 3-4 mm) the bladder neck mucosa with a laser (Figure 1).\nCircularly incise (depth to gland, width about 3-4 mm) the prostatic urethra mucosa at the proximal end of the verumontanum with a laser (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: Confirm anatomical mark before incision in order to avoid injury of the bladder neck mucosa and sphincter urethrae. Use a laser power of 80-100 W during the operation except for hemostasis.\nConnect the concentric circles of the bladder neck and the apex of the prostate in the posterior urethra at a 12 o'clock position.",
    "Incise the left lobe and right lobe with the laser (Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: Once the 12 o'clock position of the posterior urethra is pre-incised, retain the distal mucosa. The concentric circles formed at the neck of the bladder and the apex of the prostate are called Cupid's arrows.\nMaking a channel\n\t\nFind the surgical capsule at the 5 and 7 o'clock positions of the apex of the prostate.\nFind the surgical capsule at the 5 and 7 o'clock surgical capsule positions.\nConnect the 5 and 7 o'clock surgical capsule positions with a laser (Figure 4).\nAt the 6 o'clock position of the apex of the prostate, separate the median lobe from the surgical capsule from the apex of the prostate to the bladder neck with a laser (Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: If the volume of the prostate is >80 mL, the median and lateral lobes will be completely separated at the 5 and 7 o'clock positions of the apex of the prostate.\nEnucleation of the left and right lobes\n\t\nIn a counterclockwise direction, enucleate the right lobe at 6 and 12 o'clock from the apex of the prostate to the bladder neck with a resectoscope (Figure 6).\nIn a clockwise direction, enucleate the left lobe at 6 and 12 o'clock from the apex of the prostate to the bladder neck (Figure 7).\nPush all the glands into the bladder after enucleation.\n\t\tNOTE: If the volume of the prostate is >80 mL, enucleate the median and lateral lobes in the proper sequence; then, push into the bladder.\nHemostasis\n\t\nUse a lower laser power (50 W) to stop bleeding around the surgical site. Maintain an appropriate distance (i.e., 1-3 mm).\nMorcellate the prostate tissue.",
    "Morcellate the enucleated prostatic tissue into small pieces (as small as possible) with a morcellator and then remove the tissue from the bladder (Figure 8).\nCatheterization\n\t\nRemove the morcellator from the urethra.\nGently place a 22 F Foley catheter through the urethral orifice into the bladder cavity with 30 mL of water in the balloon after sufficiently lubricating the urethra with lidocaine gel.\nPostoperative care10\nLet the patient lay down on the bed for approximately 3 h postoperatively in the care unit until they completely wake up from anesthesia. Make sure that patient monitors and medical oxygen are available during this time.\nOnce the patient has completely woken up, return the patient to the ward. Let the patient begin to drink some water and eat some food. Record any urine output and pay attention to the color of the urine.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
