    "All procedures must be performed in accordance with institutional animal use and care guidelines. The procedure was developed for the analysis of murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCs and HPs), but can be adapted for the analysis of other cell populations.\n1. Flow Cytometry Isolation of Murine HSCs and HPs\nHarvest murine bone marrow cells as described in the literature6.\n\tNOTE: In data presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2, bone marrow was harvested from C57BL/6J mice.\nPerform lineage depletion of bone marrow cells using a mouse lineage depletion kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nIncubate the cells with antibodies against the cell surface markers of interest as described7. In the experiments shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, antibodies to Sca-1, Kit, Flt3, and lineage (Lin) markers Mac1, Gr1, CD3e, B220, and Ter119 are used.\nSort 2,000 - 20,000 Lin- Sca1+Kit+ Flt3- cells (HSCs) or Lin-Sca1-Kit+ cells (HPs) into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 0.1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\n\tNOTE: For the data shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, cells were sorted using a Flow Cytometer with a 70 µM nozzle. The maximum collection volume is 1.4 mL.\n2. Sample Preparation\nNOTE: This step is critical. Process the sample very carefully. When removing the supernatant, be very careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nCentrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes containing sorted cells in a swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C, 500 x g, for 5 min. Remove all but approximately 100 µL of the supernatant from the cell pellet very gently using a pipette and a 20 µL pipet tip. Do not disturb the pellet.",
    "If the sample contains fewer than 5,000 cells, and the total volume of the sorted sample is less than 0.2 mL, transfer the cells first to low binding 0.2 mL PCR tubes before centrifugation.\nIf sample contains fewer than 5,000 cells and volume is more than 0.2 mL, spin the cells down with a centrifuge at 4 °C, 500 x g, for 5 min, and remove all but 200 µL of the supernatant. Re-suspend the pelleted cells in the remaining 200 µL of supernatant, then transfer the cells to the 0.2 mL PCR tubes and spin down again. Remove all but 20 - 30 µL from the pellet after the second spin and re-suspend cells.\nResuspend the cells in the supernatant left in the tube. If necessary,add additional PBS in 2% FBS/PBS (you can also use 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS, or PBS alone) to obtain a concentration 5 x104 to 5 x 105 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: Use the cell counts collected by cytometry to estimate the volume used to suspend cells.\nUse 2 - 5 µL of the re-suspended cells to determine an accurate cell concentration using an automated cell counter (following the manufacturer's instructions) or a hemocytometer9.\nTransfer a volume of re-suspended cells containing the desired number of cells to new 1.5 mL tubes. For the experiment in Figure 1, 2,000, 1,000, or 500 HSCs or HPs were transferred. The desired number of cells depends on the strength of the signal obtained by Western blot, and is determined empirically. Perform the transfer using a 20 µL or 100 µL Eppendorf pipette tip.\nCentrifuge the cells in a swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C, 500 x g, for 5 min.\nTo generate 100x stock solutions, dissolve proteasome and phosphatase inhibitors in DMSO according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Prepare 2x Laemmli sample buffer by diluting the 4x Laemmli sample buffer provided by the manufacturer with an equivalent amount of distilled water. Add an appropriate amount of the 100x stock of proteasome and phosphatase inhibitors to obtain a final concentration of 2x inhibitors in 2x Laemmli sample buffer.\n\tNOTE: The 2x Laemmli sample buffer can be made in advance, but the proteasome and phosphatase inhibitors should be added immediately before adding the 2x Laemmli sample buffer (plus inhibitors) to the cell pellet to lyse the cells, as described in the following step.\nCarefully remove a portion of the supernatant from the cell pellet, and to the supernatant remaining in the tube with the cell pellet, add an equal volume of 2x Laemmli sample buffer plus proteasome and phosphatase inhibitors to achieve a final concentration of 500 cells/µL in 1x Laemmli sample buffer.\n\tNOTE: For example, if you transfer 2,000 cells in a total volume of 20 µL to a tube in Step 2.5, after centrifuging the cells (Step 2.6) you should remove 18 µL of the supernatant from the pellet, and to the 2 µL of supernatant that is remaining add an equal volume (2 µL) of 2x Laemmli sample buffer to achieve a final concentration of 500 cells/µL in 1x Laemmli sample buffer.\nResuspend the pellet to generate the lysate as soon as possible. At this point, the samples can be immediately electrophoresed through SDS-PAGE gels, or can be snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C for future use.\n3. Electrophoresis\nHeat the lysates in a heat block at 95 °C or in boiling water for 5 min.\nElectrophorese 1 - 40 µL of the lysates (containing from 500 up to 20,000 cell equivalents) through SDS-PAGE gels at 100V using standard protocols10.",
    "NOTE: The volume of lysate loaded into the gel is determined by the number of cells needed to generate the desirable signal, and will depend on the abundance of the protein of interest, and the quality of the antibody. The data in Figure 1 were obtained with 2,000, 1,000, and 500 cell equivalents of lysate. The width of the well should be in the range of 3 mm to 1.5 mm. 1.5 mm teeth can be cut from a commercially available comb with wider teeth using scissors.\n4. Transfer and Block\nNOTE: Perform a Western blot following standard protocols11. The steps are briefly outlined here:\nPretreat a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane with methanol for 10 s, then wash the membrane briefly with distilled water.\nTransfer the protein from the SDS-PAGE gel to the membrane following the instructions in the manual provided by the manufacturer of the transfer apparatus.\nFollowing transfer, block the membrane with 2 mL of 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween) overnight at 4 °C following standard protocols11.\n5. Antibody Labeling\nIncubate the membrane with antibodies on a shaker overnight at 4 °C using antibody dilutions recommended by the vendor.\n\tNOTE: In the Table of Materials, antibodies, which we have validated for HSCs and HPs and the corresponding antibody dilutions, are shown. Perform the antibody labeling using standard procedures8.\n6. Detection\nWash the membrane 3 times, 5 min for each wash in PBST at room temperature.\nIncubate the membrane with 2 mL of enhanced chemiluminescence buffer for 1 min at room temperature. Detect the signals using an imaging system following the manufacturer's instructions, or autoradiography film and film processor.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
