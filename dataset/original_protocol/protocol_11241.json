    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), designated as UCLA Chancellor's Animal Research Committee (ARC) (ARC 2002-049-53 and ARC 2017-102-01A). The 2002-049-53 protocol is optimized for the implantation of ccRCC tumor cells into the kidney capsule of Nude or BALB/c mice. Tumor implantation experiments in fertilized chicken eggs prior to hatching does not require IACUC approval. To extend the time for establishment of lung metastasis, the embryos with CAM tumor are allowed to hatch and grow into chickens. The 2017-102-01A protocol covers these animal experiments.\n1. Orthotopic tumor studies in mice\nNOTE: The timeline for this experiment is shown in Figure 1A. These procedures were adapted from previous publications11,12.\nPreparing single cell suspension for grafting\n\t\nDetach the RENCA VHL-WT and VHL-KO cells from the culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer and resuspend in a precooled 1:1 mixture of PBS and extracellular matrix solution at a concentration of 1 x 105 cells/µL.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a 1:4 ratio of VHL-WT:VHL-KO cells for heterogeneous implants and VHL-WT alone for homogeneous implants.\nTransfer the resuspended cells into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and keep on ice until implantation.\nImplantation to renal capsule\n\t\nAnesthesia: Preheat a warm pad to 37 °C and cover it with a piece of thick sterile drape. Anesthetize the mouse by either isoflurane inhalation via an induction chamber or intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 1% pentobarbital sodium at the dosage of 10 mL/kg.\nShave the hair from the surgical site. This step can be skipped for nude mice.",
    "Disinfection and surgical draping: Disinfect the back of the mouse entirely with povidone-iodine 3x followed by 70% ethanol 1x and wipe it dry with sterile cotton swabs. Then apply three sterile medical dressings sequentially, covering the whole back in order to create a surgical field as well as to immobilize the mouse.\nIncision and kidney exteriorization: Before the operation, disinfect the operator's fingers with povidone-iodine or use a pair of sterile gloves. Place the mouse in the prone position and use the fingers to locate the left kidney right under the left flank. Use a pair of blunt forceps and scissors to cut the skin open and the muscle layer under the specified location. Use sterile cotton swabs and forceps to partially exteriorize the left kidney out of the abdomen.\nTumor cell implantation: Load the cell suspension prepared in step 1.1 in either insulin syringes or customized Hamilton syringes (see Table of Materials for specifications). Inject 20 µL of resuspended cells under the kidney capsule.\n\t\tNOTE: Successful injection is determined by the formation of a translucent bulge on the surface of the kidney. Accidental injection into the renal parenchyma results in bleeding and a post-operative mortality rate as high as 90% due to fatal hemorrhage at the injection site.\nSlowly pull out the needle in order to allow the extracellular matrix solution to solidify and prevent hemorrhage or tumor cell leakage. Then, using a sterile cotton swab, push the kidney back into the abdomen.\nWound stitching: Use a 5-0 coated VICTRYL suture to stitch the muscle layer. Disinfect the skin with povidone-iodine once and close the skin with wound autoclips.",
    "Recovery: Place the mouse on the warm pad until it wakes up. If the mouse was anesthetized by inhalation, withdraw the isoflurane and keep the mouse on the warm pad until it is awake.\nBioluminescence imaging (BLI) and tissue collection\n\t\nSix weeks after tumor implantation, take firefly-luciferase-based BLI images. Then euthanize mice with isoflurane inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\nCollect blood for circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection by flow cytometry.\nHarvest tumor and organs of interest (kidneys, lungs, liver, intestines, and spleen) using a sterile tissue harvesting technique22. Fix them in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight for paraffin-wax embedding.\n2. CAM tumor xenograft model\nNOTE: These procedures were adapted and modified from previously published protocols23,24. The timeline for this procedure is shown in Figure 1B. This article presents only the streamlined protocol. For detailed protocols, please refer to another JoVE article published by our group25.\nPreincubation: Incubate freshly laid, fertilized chicken eggs in a rotating egg incubator at 37 °C and 55-65% humidity for 7 days.\nDrop the CAM and open window (developmental day 7):\n\t\nLocate and mark the air sac and veins.\n\t\tNOTE: Usually 10-15% of the eggs are removed because they are either unfertilized or die within 7 days of fertilization.\nCreate a new air sac on top of a marked vein.\nDelineate the new air sac, apply packing tape, and put the eggs back to the incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: The procedure can be paused here. It is recommended to resume the procedures within the same day because the air sac may move.\nOpen a window: Using a pair of curved microdissecting scissors and a pair of needle-nose forceps, cut a 1.5 x 1.5 cm circular window in the shell.\n\t\tNOTE: Disruption of CAM is indicated by the blood and a piece of CAM present on the cut shell piece.",
    "Seal the hole with transparent medical dressing and place the eggs in a stationary incubator at 37 °C and 55%-65% humidity.\n\t\tNOTE: Use the same egg incubator as in step 2.1. Turn off the rotator to make it stationary.\nHealth check (developmental day 9): Remove dead eggs and then randomly group the rest of the eggs for tumor cell implantation.\n\tNOTE: Ideally, the survival rate at this point is approximately 80% of developmental day 0.\nGrafting the tumor cells onto the newly exposed CAM (developmental day 10)\n\t\nDilute the extracellular matrix solution in double the volume of precooled RPMI 1640 (with L-glutamine). Detach the RENCA cells and resuspend in the above solution to reach a concentration of 2 x 104 cells/µL.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a 1:1 ratio of VHL-WT:VHL-KO cells for heterogeneous implants and VHL-WT alone for homogeneous implantation.\nTo presolidify the cell suspension, fill 100 µL of each cell mix in 200 µL pipette tips and place them in a cell incubator for 15 mins.\nImplant 100 µL of cell suspension for each egg on the CAM surface through the window.\n\t\tNOTE: Some protocols require scratching the CAM before implantation23. This is not necessary for RENCA cells, because they grow very quickly.\nGrow cells on the CAM for 10 days and photograph every 2 days.\nEuthanize and harvest the tumor, blood, and organs.\n\t\nOn developmental day 20 (tumor day 10), collect blood via the chorioallantoic vein with a heparinized 10 mL syringe.\nEuthanize the embryos by putting them on ice for 15 min.\nHarvest and weigh tumors. Dissect lungs and livers using a sterile tissue harvesting technique similar to that used for mice22.",
    "NOTE: Chickens livers have two lobes, which are the first organs seen in the abdominal cavity. Do not confuse these with the lungs. The chicken lungs are located under the heart and septum26. The successful collection of the lungs can be confirmed by exposed ribs.\nFix the tumors and the dissected organs in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight for paraffin-wax embedding.\nHatch the chickens.\n\t\nTo allow an extended period of tumor growth, continue the incubation through day 21 and let the chickens hatch at 37 °C and at least 60% humidity.\n\t\tNOTE: Chickens naturally hatch after day 21 over a 24 h time period but occasionally have trouble hatching by themselves. In this case, cracking the eggshells some helps. It is important for chickens to complete the hatching process within 24 h because they will die from lack of nutrients after then.\nGrow the chickens in an animal facility (2017-102-01A) for 2 weeks.\nOn developmental day 34 (tumor day 24), euthanize the chicks with isoflurane inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\nDissect the lungs using a sterile tissue harvesting technique similar to those used for mice22. Then, fix them in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight for paraffin-wax embedding.\n3. Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: All tissue sectioning and H&E staining was done by the Translational Pathology Core Laboratory (TPCL) at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nBake slides at 65 °C for 20 min and deparaffinize 3x using xylene and rehydrate serially from 100% ethanol to water.\nRetrieve the antigens in a citrate buffer boiled in a vegetable steamer for 25 min.\nApply 1% BSA for blocking. Then apply the primary antibodies (anti-VHL, anti-HA, anti-flag) prepared at a 1:200 dilution ratio in PBS. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.",
    "After washing 3x with TBST (7 min each), incubate slides with the secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution. Wash 3x with TBST (7 min each) and apply DAB reagents followed by hematoxylin counterstaining.\n4. Flow Cytometry\nProcess the mouse or chicken blood with red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\tNOTE: Sufficient RBC lysis is especially important when analyzing CAM blood because chicken RBCs are nucleated and cannot be easily distinguished in flow cytometry using the forward and side scatter.\nRun flow cytometry on the blood lysate and analyze the data for mStrawberry and EGFP expression.\nSet the primary gates based on the forward and side scatter excluding debris, dead cells, and unlysed RBCs.\nSet the fluorescence gates based on the unstained samples and single stained controls. Use blood lysate primed with VHL-WT, VHL-KO, or unlabeled RENCA cells as the single stained controls and unstained controls, respectively.\nSubscription Required.
