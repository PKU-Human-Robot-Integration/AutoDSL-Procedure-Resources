    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol has five main sections (see below). Sections 1 and 2 are specific to this protocol while sections 3–5 are generic and depend on user preferences.\nSection 1: Isolation of myeloid cells from tumor-bearing brain tissue with Percoll.\nSection 2: Further enrichment of myeloid cells using CD11b+ magnetic beads.\nSection 3: Generation of Single Cell RNA library using the 10× chromium platform.\nSection 4: Sequencing.\nSection 5: Analyses of sequencing data.\nSection 1: Isolation of myeloid cells from tumor-bearing brain tissue with Percoll\nTiming: 4 h\nMyeloid cells are isolated from brain tumors using a fixed gradient Percoll separation.\nHomogenize brain tumor\n(Perform at room temperature)\nResect brain tumor (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1183-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Resection of the mouse brain cerebellum with tumor\n(A) Peeling the skin away from the skull.\n(B) One arm of the scissors is inserted into the foramen magna where the brainstem runs through.\n(C) Cutting skull along the sagittal suture.\n(D) Removal of skull.\n(E) Removal of the brain starting at the frontal lobe.\n(F) Disconnecting nerve fibers from the brainstem.\n(G) On the left is a normal brain. On the right is a brain with tumor. This mouse was symptomatic and had hydrocephalus resulting in a larger brain volume above the tentorium as well. Folia of the cerebellum are no longer discernible.\n(H) Removal of the cerebellum away from the brainstem (white).\n(I) Disconnecting the nerve fibers from the brainstem to the cerebellum.\n(J) Cerebellum with tumor is fully removed.\nAfter euthanizing the mouse, remove the head of the mouse using a pair of scissors.\nCut away the skin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and excess neck muscle until the brain stem can be seen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Starting from the brain stem, cut upward along the sagittal suture applying as little pressure as possible to the brain itself (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPeel each hemisphere of the skull away from the brain to the side (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nWith a spatula or foreceps, remove the brain from the base of the skull and cut long nerve fibers to detach the brain (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nFor removal of the cerebellum, gently push the cerebellum with tumor away from the brainstem and detach the nerve fibers (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H and 1I). We used the entire cerebellum containing bilateral medulloblastomas.\nNote: For tumors that are highly vascularized and intravascular immune cells are predicted to be high, perfuse mouse with 10 mL ice-cold PBS through the left ventricle prior to resection. For a detailed protocol on perfusing rodent, refer to Gage et al. (2012)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]. Alternatively, immune cells from peripheral blood can be identified during the analysis of the single-cell data using published data sets obtained from cells of peripheral blood (Dang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAdd 5 mL RPMI solution and tumor into a 10 mL glass homogenizer and homogenize tissue.\nPlace a 70 μm cell filter on a 50 mL conical tube and pipet onto it the homogenate to filter out cell clumps. Transfer the flow through into a 15 mL conical tube.\nPercoll gradient-based isolation of myeloid cells\n(Perform at room temperature at the bench. Sterile conditions are not needed.)\nTo cell suspension, add RPMI solution to make a total of 7 mL. Then add 3 mL SIP to cell suspension and mix by pipetting to create 10 mL cell suspension in 30% Percoll.",
    "Take up 5 mL of 70% Percoll solution in a 5 mL syringe attached to a spinal needle. Insert the needle into the cell suspension until the bevel reaches the bottom of the conical tube. Gently and slowly, eject 70% Percoll layer below the 30% Percoll cell suspension layer.\nCritical: To minimize turbulence to make a sharp, demarcating line between the two layers, make sure that no air bubbles are in the needle or syringe. Withdraw the needle with a slow, smooth motion while keeping the needle parallel to the side of the tube.\nNote: If spinal needles are not available, perform the layering in the reverse order. First, pipette 5 mL of 70% Percoll solution into a 15 mL tube and slowly pipette onto it the 10 mL of cell suspension in 30% Percoll with a P1000 pipet. This should be performed gently to ensure a sharp, demarcating line between the two layers.\nNote: If two layers are not clearly seen, recheck original concentration of 30% Percoll cell suspension and 70% Percoll to make sure the correct percentage of Percoll was made for each.\nCarefully and gently, carry the tubes to a centrifuge set at room temperature. Set the centrifuge acceleration to maximal speed and deceleration to 0 to eliminate turbulence which causes unwanted mixing of the two layers disrupting the gradient. Spin the gradient mixture at 500 × g for 30 min. This spin will take 35–40 min because of the slow deceleration.\nNote: Percoll separation is optimized when the solution is at room temperature and the spinning is done in a centrifuge set at room temperature.\nCritical: Set the centrifuge acceleration to maximal speed and deceleration to 0 to eliminate turbulence during deceleration which can cause unwanted mixing of the two layers.",
    "Optional: If you wish to isolate a broader collection of immune cells including lymphocytes, use a 40/80 Percoll gradient, a spin speed of 325 × g for 30 minutes, and CD45 microbeads in section 2. Use the following steps.\nPrepare the following stock solution:\nStock Isotonic Percoll SIP 100% (SIP100), volume per sample (9.3/sample [8.4 mL+ ∼10% extra])\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1183_4.csv\n80% Percoll, volume per sample (5.5 mL/sample [5 mL+10% extra])\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1183_5.csv\nHomogenize tissue as described above. Bring cell suspension volume up to 6 mL and add 4 mL of SIP to make 10 mL of 40% Percoll cell suspension. Layer 80% Percoll beneath the 40% Percoll layer using method described above. Spin at 325 × g for 30 min.\nGently remove the tube from the centrifuge. A white, thin layer of myelin will be seen at the top of the tube. Additionally, a cloudy interface layer of several millimeters thick containing myeloid cells will be seen at the interface between the two Percoll layers.\nAspirate and discard the top white layer that contains myelin fragments.\nUsing a spinal needle attached to a 5 mL syringe, insert the needle into the gradient until the tip hits the interface layer and gently aspirate into the syringe the interface layer (∼2–3 mL depending on the number of cells that determines the thickness of the layer) and gently transfer to a fresh 15 mL conical tube.\nTo wash cells and remove Percoll, add ice-cold 12 mL MACS buffer. Mix with gentle pipetting. Reset centrifuge deceleration back to maximum and temperature to 4°C. Spin cell suspension 300 × g for 7 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of cold MACs buffer and transfer to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin at 300 × g speed for 1 min.",
    "Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 90 μL of MACs buffer (per 107 total cells).\nNote: The number of cells in this sample is dependent on the density of myeloid cells in tumor and size of tissue that was homogenized. Quantification can be performed with a cell counter or hemocytometer. Flow cytometry with common myeloid markers can be performed to confirm the quality of myeloid enrichment. Percoll purified cells in mouse medulloblastoma that occupy the majority of the cerebellum is generally less than 107 in quantity.\nSection 2: Further enrichment of myeloid cells using CD11b+ magnetic beads\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: The detailed protocol is described in the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd11b-microbeads-human-and-mouse.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd11b-microbeads-human-and-mouse.html#gref]; click “Data sheet”). Below are the major steps and conditions used in Dang et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nIncubate cell suspension with CD11b MicroBeadsTM by adding 10 μL of microbeads to every 90 μL of cell suspension and incubate for 15 min on ice.\nOptional: CD45 MicroBeadsTM can be used with cells collected from a 40/80 Percoll gradient to capture lymphocytes and myeloid cells.\nTo wash cells, resuspend in 1 mL of MACs buffer and spin at 300 × g for 10 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend in 500 μL of cold MACs buffer and mix with gentle pipetting.\nWhile cells are being prepared in step 14, set up an LS column in the MidiMACS separator mounted to a MACS Multistand (following manufacturer’s recommendation in protocol listed above) over a 15 mL conical tube to collect flow through and wash with 3 mL of cold MACS buffer.\nApply the cell suspension onto the column and wait for the solution to run through the column.\nThen wash the column 3× with 3 mL cold MACS buffer.",
    "Remove the column from the separator and place it on a new 15 mL conical tube.\nPipette 5 mL of cold MACS buffer onto the column and immediately flush out magnetically labeled cells by applying and pushing the plunger supplied with the column.\nSpin at 300 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant. Since it can be difficult to remove all supernatant from a 15 mL conical tube without disrupting a small cell pellet, remove as much supernatant as possible. Then add 1 mL cold MACS buffer. Mix with gentle pipetting and transfer cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Spin at 500 × g for 1 min to pellet the cell. Remove as much supernatant as possible. Save the supernatant in case not all cells are pelleted.\nResuspend cells in desired volume and buffer appropriate for the scRNA-sequencing platform. For 10× Genomics, we recommend using 1×PBS (calcium and magnesium free) containing 0.04% weight/volume BSA (400 μg/mL). BSA is added to minimize cell losses and aggregation.\nNote: If the desired volume is uncertain, we recommend resuspending cells in about 50–100 μL of buffer, which will allow for enough volume for cell counting and a cell concentration that may be approximately appropriate for loading for cDNA preparation. Adjustment to volume (either more concentrated or dilute) can be made after the cell count.\nCritical: Buffer should not contain excessive amounts of EDTA (>0.1 mM) or magnesium (>3 mM) because those components will inhibit the reverse transcription reaction.\nCritical: To minimize physical damage to cells it is important to pipette gently and slowly during cell resuspension steps. Use wide-bore pipette tips to minimize cell damage.",
    "Using trypan blue and a hemocytometer, count the number of viable cells to determine quantity of sample to be used for library preparation. For detailed instructions on counting cells, refer to the following online protocol by Moore (2012)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] (https://www.protocols.io/view/counting-cells-with-hemocytometer-nxsdfne[href=https://www.protocols.io/view/counting-cells-with-hemocytometer-nxsdfne]).\nNote: Cell suspensions should also be checked visually for debris or cell aggregates because these can clog microfluidic channels. If observed, additional pipetting or filtering may be required to obtain optimal performance. Pipetting should be done gently and carefully to avoid lysing or damaging cells. Alternatively, filter cell suspension with one of the following cell strainers: Flowmi™ Cell Strainer (40 micron, Fisher Scientific 14-100-150) or MACS SmartStrainer (30 micron, Miltenyi 130-098-458)\nNote: If cell concentration is much lower than expected, check the concentration of saved supernatants and re-pellet the supernatant at a higher centrifugation speed. Cells may not have been efficiently pelleted at the initial speed or were lost in the cell strainer.\nDilute or concentrate the solution to obtain cell suspension concentration between 700 and 1200 cells/μL for optimal chip loading.\nNote: To the determine the optimal suspension volume to achieve target cell recovery, refer to the Cell Suspension Volume Calculator Table on page 30 of the Chromium Next GEM Automated Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3.1 User Guide (CG000286) (https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/5qIua7LwDKxoNEvHJnYqcB/c778731aa23ca5e51e1aa5d1c8941828/CG000286_ChromiumSingleCell3-_v3.1_Automation_UG_RevB.pdf[href=https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/5qIua7LwDKxoNEvHJnYqcB/c778731aa23ca5e51e1aa5d1c8941828/CG000286_ChromiumSingleCell3-_v3.1_Automation_UG_RevB.pdf]).\nCritical: Once the target cell concentration is obtained, place the cells on ice immediately. Cell suspension should be loaded onto the chip for library preparation as soon as possible, ideally within 30 min.\nSection 3: Generation of Single Cell RNA library using the 10× chromium platform\nTiming: ∼20 h",
    "Note: The experiments in Dang et al. used Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 Chemistry, and libraries sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. The v2 chemistry kits are no longer commercially available from the manufacturer. Therefore, the methodology described below is for the 3′ kit. More detailed instructions are provided on the manufacturer’s website (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index]). Here we describe the major steps.\nNote: Next GEM (Gel Bead-In EMulsions) is a technology that is built on a new chip architecture, the Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3.1 and Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kits allow for a high number of detected genes, minimizes the number of barcodes that can be interpreted to come from more than one cell, 65% capture rate, and is compatible with both whole cells and nuclei. The kit contains Poly(dT) primer that enables the production of barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mDNA. This kit also allows add-on features such as cell surface protein, CRISPR screening, and cell multiplexing.\nPrepare a Chromium Next GEM Chip G in a Chromium Next GEM Secondary Holder and dispense 50% glycerol into all unused wells.\nPrepare the barcode master mix using RT Reagent B, Template Switch Oligo, Reducing Agent B, and RT Enzyme C. Add the cell suspension to the master mix (with/without water depending on the stock concentration) and mix by pipetting.\nCritical: Do not add nuclease-free water directly to single-cell suspension. Add nuclease-free water to the Master Mix if needed.\nLoad the 70 μL final mixture into row 1 of the chip. Load 50 μL of vortexed gel beads into row 2 and 45 μL of partitioning oil in row 3.\nCritical: Wait 30 s after adding the gel beads into the chip.",
    "Place a gasket over the chip and attach it to the Secondary Holder. Load the chip into a Chromium Single Cell Controller instrument for GEM (Gel Bead-In EMulsions) generation. This process takes about 18 min.\nPerform GEM-RT step in a thermal cycler. We used a C1000 Touch thermal cycler (BIO-RAD). The thermal cycler protocol is the following: 45 min at 53°C, 5 min at 85°C, and hold at 4°C.\nNote: cDNA generated at this stage can be stored at −20°C for up to a week.\nPerform post-GEM clean up\nAdd Recovery Agent and invert to mix. Biphasic mixture will separate with the partitioning oil in pink on the bottle.\nNote: GEM generation occurs in narrow microfluidic channels so occasionally a clog may occur. Clogs can be noticed when less than 100 μL of gel emulsion with beads is recovered from the well and presence of heterogenous GEM emulsion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Clogs are generally caused by a few reasons: (1) contamination of sample with debris and presence of cell clumps which should be removed with strainers/filters before loading; (2) overloading the chip with excess cells; (3) improper handling of gel beads which form the clog; to minimize the risk of gel bead clogging, completely thaw and vortex the gel beads before processing, handle the beads in a sterile environment, and store the chips in a clean area free of dust. If a clog occurs, ideally the experiment should be repeated, but if the starting material is no longer available, it is possible to proceed with the protocol and generate cDNA, but the number of recovered cells will be lower.\nCollect the clear aqueous phase on top\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1183-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Tips 3 and 8 are not homogeneous and have an excess of partitioning oil, indicating a clog",
    "The other tips are successfully generated GEM emulsions.\nAdd a master mix containing Dynabead MyOne SILANE beads, Reducing Agent B, Cleanup Buffer and water.\nIncubate for 10 min with pipet mixing at 5 min.\nPlace tubes on 10×Magnetic Separator (High position) until the solution clears.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the beads with ethanol.\nElute with elution buffer off magnet\nPut back on the magnet to pull down beads.\nTransfer 35 μL of the sample to a new tube.\nTo amplify cDNA add Amp Mix and cDNA Primers to the sample and place in the thermal cycler using the following protocol.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1183_6.csv\nNote: The number of cycles depends on the desired targeted cell recovery. The goal is to generate sufficient mass for library construction.\nClean the cDNA\nAdd SPRIselect Reagent containing magnet beads to make a final 0.6× solution of the reagent.\nIncubate for 5 min and place on the magnet until the solution clears.\nRemove the supernatant.\nWash beads with ethanol x2.\nPlace on the magnet and remove residual ethanol.\nElute cDNA with elution buffer.\nPerform quality control with a 1:10 diluted sample on the D1000 High Sensitivity kit, an automated electrophoresis platform. After cDNA amplification and SPRI cleanup, the size of the cDNA fragments should be between 400 to 9000 bases. A high quality library preparation should yield an abundance of cDNA within that size range (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1183-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Examples of high and poor quality control traces of cDNA (D1000 High Sensitivity kit, TapeStationTM, Agilent)\nThe bad quality sample yielded significantly less cDNA.",
    "Note: Agilent Bioanalyzer, Agilent TapeStation, and LabChip are the recommended methods for accurate quantification. The total yield will vary depending on the number of PCR cycles used during cDNA amplification, the number of cells targeted, and the RNA content per cell. It is also possible to use Qubit Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit as an alternative QC method; in this case, it is necessary to multiply the cDNA concentration reported via the Qubit Fluorometer by the elution volume (40 μL) to obtain the total cDNA yield in nanograms.\nNote: Total cDNA yield is highly dependent on the cell type, cell preparation, and the number of cells loaded onto the chip. Low cDNA recovery may be result of low cell viability, RT inhibitory contaminants, sample clog, loss of cDNA during clean-up steps, or low total mRNA content per cell. If yield is low, add an extra 1–2 PCR cycles in the cDNA amplification step.\nProceed to construction of dual index library by starting with 10 μL of cDNA sample and performing fragmentation, end-repair, and A-tailing in a joint reaction.\nPurify sample using a dual-sided 0.6×/0.8× bead:sample ratio with SPRIselect Reagent.\nPerform adapter ligation by mixing each sample with a master mix consisting of ligation buffer, DNA ligase, and Adapter Oligo.\nPerform post-ligation cleanup with 0.8× SPRIselect Reagent purification.\nPerform sample indexing PCR using Amp Mix and Dual Index TT Set A followed by a final size-selection consisted of a dual-sided 0.6×/0.8× bead:sample ratio.\nAfter library construction, run the final library either on a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation High Sensitivity kits at 1:10 dilution. The typical size distribution for final libraries is between 300 and 1000 bp. The trace should be similar to the high-grade sample in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1183-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Examples of high and poor quality control traces of library sample obtained from D1000 High Sensitivity kit (TapeStationTM, Agilent)\nIn the low grade sample there is an extra 252 bp peak from contaminated cDNA. One additional SPRI cleaning cycle using a 1× ratio removed the contaminant.\nDetermine the average fragment size from the trace, this will be used as the insert size for library quantification.\nCritical: Additional peaks may be present on the electropherogram trace. If there are peaks around 200 bp, this may indicate carryover adaptor/primer dimers in the final library and may affect sequencing results. If this occurs, perform an additional 1.0× SPRIselect cleanup prior to sequencing to remove adaptor dimers. Perform this step only if the total library yield is sufficient because an extra clean up may lose approximately 40% of the library material. If the total library yield is insufficient, we recommend performing a new library preparation from left-over amplified cDNA.\nTo determine the library concentration, perform qPCR using KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Platforms by following the manufacturer’s recommendations (https://www.n-genetics.com/products/1104/1024/17225.pdf[href=https://www.n-genetics.com/products/1104/1024/17225.pdf]) for qPCR-based quantification. Determine the concentration based on insert size derived from the Bioanalyzer/TapeStation trace in the previous step.\nDilute the libraries to 1.75 nM and pool in equal proportions.\nSection 4: Sequencing\nNote: Sequencing time depends on the flow cell type. The time below is based on the SP 100 cycles V1.5 flow cell on the NovaSeq 6000 Illumina sequencer. This flow cell can generate about ∼650–800 million reads and can fit up to four 3′GEX libraries for a targeted capture quantity of 10,000 per sample.\nTiming: ∼ 24 h",
    "Sequence the library. We performed sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 with the run parameters recommended by the 10× user guide: Read 1–28 cycles, i7 index – 10 cycles, i5 index – 10 cycles, Read 2–90 cycles.\nNote: By default, 1% of PhiX was added to the sequencing run for quality control monitoring. 10× Genomics recommends sequencing a minimum of 20,000 reads/cell.\nSection 5: Analysis of sequencing data\nUsing a 10× Chromium Cell Ranger with instructions from the tutorial available online (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/tutorials[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/tutorials]), generate three files: barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv, and matrix.mtx.\nUse Seurat (Satija et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) (that runs in R or R Studio) or equivalent tool to analyze the data. Tutorials are available for Seurat at https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html[href=https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html]. Data integration to eliminate batch effect should be considered, especially when combining samples ran at different times.\nAnnotate immune cells using key markers for specific cell types or use SingleR (Aran et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) algorithm that will allow you to import data from the Immgen database as a library reference.\nTo identify homeostatic microglia that are present in normal brain tissue, import published data (Li et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Dang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) as a library reference. Alternatively, samples of homeostatic microglia (from a normal brain) and peripheral blood (from mouse without tumor) can be sequenced and batched together with tumor-associated macrophages. Please see Dang et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] for detailed methods on identification of tumor infiltrating monocytes and homeostatic microglia during analysis."
