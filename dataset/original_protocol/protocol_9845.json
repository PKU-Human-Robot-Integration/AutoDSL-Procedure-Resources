    "1. Making lipid films\nPrepare lipid films for microbubble generation using 90% DSPC and 10% DSPE-PEG2K by mixing the lipids at the correct ratio using the following directions:\n\t\nMake stock lipids of DSPC and DSPE-PEG2K in chloroform. Weigh 50 mg of each lipid powder in separate vials. Add 1 mL of chloroform to each vial using a 1 mL glass syringe.\nAdd 287 µL of DSPC stock and 113 µL of DSPE-PEG2K stock (both 50 mg/mL) into a 20 mL scintillation vial using a glass syringe.\nDry the mixed lipids to remove chloroform using nitrogen. Using an appropriate length of tubing connected to house nitrogen, lightly flow nitrogen gas over the headspace of the vial while mixing. Continue until no chloroform is observed, and the remaining lipid film starts to turn white. Use polypropylene screw caps, cover the sample while introducing nitrogen in the headspace.\nPlace vials under vacuum overnight using a vacuum desiccator to remove any residual chloroform. A thin translucent film will remain that coats the bottom of the vial.\nStore vials at -20 °C until needed.\n2. Generating microbubbles from lipid films\nTo make the microbubbles, add 10 mL of 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 20% v/v Propylene Glycol and 20% v/v Glycerol (final pH 7.2-7.4) to a dry lipid film.\nRe-cap the sample and warm sample to 65 °C for 30 min on a heating block (or heated water bath).\nWhile the sample is warming, prepare the bath sonicator by increasing the bath temperature to 65 °C.\n\tNOTE: This process is faster if the water is preheated in a microwave or hotplate before placing in the bath sonicator.",
    "Place the scintillation vial containing the warmed sample in the bath sonicator so that only the portion of the vial containing the lipid solution is submerged in the water bath.\nSonicate the warm lipid solution for a minimum of 15 min. Ensure that the water temperature remains at 65 °C. Continue to sonicate in intervals of 10-15 min until the solution is completely clear (Figure 2).\n\t​NOTE: If a bath sonicator is not available, the solution can be tip sonicated at 10% power until clear. However, the microtip will wear out quicker and is more expensive to replace.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62203/62203fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Example of hydrated lipid films.

This will be used later in Step 2.14.\nTurn on the power switch for the sonicator.\nAfter the system starts, set the power level to 70%. Do not exceed 70% amplitude with the microtip attachment. Do not start the sonicator at this time.\nAttach an appropriate length of tubing to guide the gas from the DFB tank outlet into the warm lipid solution held in the enclosure. The tube should be placed just into the neck of the vial to allow gas to flow into the headspace during sonication (Figure 3).",
    "Open the tank valve slowly until the gas can be seen flowing over the lipid solution. This will cause slight ripples on the surface of the liquid. If the gas flow is too high, the solution will overflow during microbubble formulation.\nStart the sonicator and run for 10 s continuously to generate microbubbles. If the bubble solution starts to overflow during sonication, immediately stop the sonicator.\nTurn off the sonicator and immediately close the DFB tank valve.\nQuickly cap the microbubble solution and submerge the vial in the ice bath to cool the sample below 55 °C (glass transition temperature of DSPC)\nLeave the microbubble samples in the ice bath until needed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62203/62203fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Placement of probe tip into lipid solution to optimize microbubble formation.

Preparing extruder for microbubble condensation\nAssemble high-pressure extruder as detailed in the user's manual using a 200 nm ceramic filter (supplied from manufacturer).\nPlace the extruder in the center of a watertight container so that the sample outlet tube is not pressed against the side or crimped.\nCouple the extruder to the nitrogen gas tank using the adaptor supplied by the manufacturer.\nMake a -2 °C salted ice bath in the watertight container around the extruder using 400 mL of water and 10 g of sodium chloride.\nPlace the end of the outlet tube in a scintillation vial to collect the extruded sample.\n\t​NOTE: Secure the tube to the container with tape if it does not lay flat or stay within the vial.\n4. Priming the extruder for microbubble condensation\nOpen and close the release valve to make sure there is no pressure within the extruder.",
    "Remove the chamber lid and add 5 mL of 1x PBS to the extruder chamber.\nReplace the lid making sure that it clicks securely back into place.\nOpen the nitrogen gas tank so that the pressure gauge reads 250 psi. Make sure the pressure control valve is in the closed position.\nClose the gas tank and open the extruder chamber inlet valve. The PBS solution will be pushed through the system and out the sample outlet tube into the scintillation vial.\nWhen only gas is exiting the tubing, open the release valve and allow the pressure to fall to 0 psi.\nRemove the scintillation vial.\n5. Pre-cooling microbubbles for extrusion\nOpen and close the release valve to make sure there is no pressure within the extruder. Place a new scintillation vial at the end of the outlet tube.\nFill a steel container with 2-methyl butane and add dry ice to bring the temperature down to -18 °C.\nInsert the microbubble solution into the chilled 2-methyl butane so the sample is submerged for 2 min. Move the scintillation vial throughout the 2 min to gently mix the bubbles. Add dry ice as needed to maintain the temperature between -15 and -18 °C. Be careful not to exceed -20 ˚C or the excipient solution will freeze and destroy the bubble sample.\n\tNOTE: Steps 5.2 and 5.3 can also be done by cooling the bubble sample in a laboratory freezer over a more extended time period. However, caution should be used to carefully monitor the temperature of the freezer and avoid freezing the sample.\nAfter 2 min, remove the microbubbles from the chilled 2-methyl butane, gently shake the vial to mix the microbubbles and use a chilled 10 mL syringe to transfer the solution to the extruder.",
    "Remove the extruder chamber lid and add the microbubble solution to the chamber by slowly pushing the plunger on the syringe. Replace the extruder cap making sure it clicks securely back in place.\nVerify that the pressure control valve and the release valve of the extruder are in the closed position.\nOpen the nitrogen gas tank until the pressure gauge reads 250 psi, close the gas tank, and turn the pressure control valve to the open position.\nWhen the solution has filled the scintillation vial at the exit tubing, and only gas is exiting the tube, slowly open the pressure release valve and allow the pressure to fall to 0 psi.\nPlace the scintillation vial in an ice bath or fridge for storage.\nFor long-term storage and minimizing spontaneous vaporization, store the sample in a standard freezer. Ensure the temperature is -20 °C or higher to avoid freezing the sample (the excipient solution of 20% PPG and 20% Glycerol will keep the sample from freezing in most laboratory freezers).\n6. Separating droplets from liposomes by centrifugation\nTransfer 10 mL of the extruded droplet solution to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the extruded sample at 1,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. A pellet comprised of DFB nanodroplets will be apparent at the bottom of the tube (Figure 4). Spontaneously vaporized droplets will appear at the top of the solution and should be discarded.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62203/62203fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Example of phase-shift DFB droplets pelleting after centrifugation. DFB nanodroplets are more dense than liposomes and will collect at the bottom of the centrifuge tube in a pellet, (red box).

    "Mix the tube gently to obtain a homogeneous solution and transfer the droplets to a smaller 2 mL centrifuge tube.\nWash sample two more times in 2 mL centrifuge tube.\nAfter the last wash, resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of 1x PBS with 20% glycerol and 20% propylene glycol and store on ice or in the freezer until needed.\n7. Microscopy verification of droplet vaporization\nMake a diluted droplet solution by adding 2.5 µl of concentrated droplets to 7.5 µl of 1x PBS.\nPrepare a microscope slide with 10 µl of the diluted sample. Using a 40x objective, observe the sample and save images.\nRemove the slide from the microscope and place it on a 65 ˚C heat plate for 1 min to vaporize nanodroplets into microbubbles.\nUse the same 40x objective to observe the sample after heating to verify droplet vaporization.\nSubscription Required.
