    "Preparation of LmOVANotes:  All steps should be performed in a biosafety cabinet class II. Sterilize all surfaces of the cabinet with UV light and 70% ethanol before and after the procedures. Wear personal protective equipment, including a lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses. Place a vial with frozen bacteria on ice in a biosafety level 2 cabinet. With a sterile 200 μl pipette tip or a disposable inoculation loop, take a smear of the frozen bacteria and spread it onto an LB plate with erythromycin (see scheme below for spreading movements). Change the tip or inoculation loop, drag it through the first streak, and spread it in the next 1/4 of the plate. Repeat this process with the secondary streak. With each new streak, drag a new tip or loop across the latest streak before starting the spread for efficiency. It is advisable to spread bacteria from 2-3 different vials onto separate LB plates to ensure colony growth. Place the plate up-side-down at 37°C (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4247/bioprotoc-11-23-4247-g002.jpgFigure 2. Experimental outline. Listeria growth and dilution, procedures A1 and A3-4. Adoptive transfer and infection of mice with LmOVA, procedures B, C, D-F. Created with BioRender.com.After 24 h, single colonies of bacteria should be visible (if not, leave the bacteria for another 24 h). Pick one colony with a sterile 200 μl pipette tip, and stir it in 100 ml of LB medium + erythromycin at 37°C in a sterile Erlenmeyer flask (the volume of the culture should not exceed 20% of the total volume). Cover the lid of the flask with aluminum or parafilm, and place it in a flask-shaker (225 rpm) at 37°C overnight (Figure 2).",
    "The following morning, transfer 100 μl of the overnight growth culture into a sterile Erlenmeyer flask with fresh pre-warmed 100 ml of LB medium + erythromycin and place in a 37°C flask-shaker (225 rpm). Save at least 10 ml of the fresh LB-medium + erythromycin to use as a blank when determining bacterial growth with a spectrophotometer. Determine corrected OD600 every 2 h by pipetting 1 ml of the fresh LB-medium + erythromycin into a 1.6 ml semi-micro-cuvette and setting it as blank, followed by pipetting 1 ml of the bacterial growth in a new 1 ml cuvette and measuring OD600. When corrected OD600 corresponds to an OD where bacteria are in exponential growth (for details, see below), growth can be stopped by placing the bacteria on ice, and bacteria can be prepared for injection into the mouse (Figure 2).Notes:   The OD600 over a whole day should be determined in a pilot experiment to identify the OD600 where bacteria are optimally growing in an exponential phase. This can differ depending on the spectrophotometer, LB-medium, temperature, etc. Exponential bacterial growth is at corrected OD600 0.5-1.0, and bacteria typically reach corrected OD600 = 0.5 after 5 h (Jones and D’Orazio, 2013; Ahn et al., 2016).  It is essential to use the same batch of LB-medium + erythromycin for bacterial growth and blank.  When taking out the flask with bacteria from the 37°C shaker, work quickly and put bacteria back immediately if optimal corrected OD600 has not been reached.  Once the optimal bacterial density is reached, the concentration of the bacteria can be calculated using the following formula: [c] = corrected OD600 × 11 × 108/ml.Perform serial dilutions in sterile PBS using 2 ml Eppendorf tubes, e.g., if the initial bacterial concentration is 6.6 × 108/ml, prepare serial dilutions by adding 757.",
    "6 μl (corresponding to 5 × 108 bacteria) of bacterial solution to 242.4 μl of PBS, followed by four serial dilutions using 100 μl into 900 μl of PBS, to get the final concentration of 5 × 104 bacteria/ml (Figure 3). Note: Initial volume will depend on the concentration of bacteria and needs to be recalculated each time. Make sure to mix properly by pipetting up and down, and prepare excess material as backup material. For mouse tail vein injection, dilute bacteria to 5 × 104 bacteria/ml in order to inject 104 CFU per mouse in a total volume of 200 μl (Procedure C below).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4247/bioprotoc-11-23-4247-g003.jpgFigure 3. Bacterial serial dilutions. One specific example of serial dilutions of bacteria is shown. Created with BioRender.com.After infecting the mice (see Procedure C), use the final dilution of the left-over bacteria to control for the concentration of bacteria in the injected material. Dilute the bacteria serially 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:10,000 in PBS and plate 100 μl of each dilution in technical duplicates by spreading onto LB + erythromycin plates. Grow up-side-down for 24 h at 37°C (Figure 2).After 24 h, count the colonies. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) should correspond to 5 × 104 bacteria/ml in the original mixture (Figure 2); for further details, see Table 2.Notes:  Plates with >300 colonies or <30 colonies should not be used to calculate cells numbers due to inaccuracy. Mix the serial dilutions of the bacteria thoroughly before plating. Glycerol stocks for long-term storage can be prepared by mixing 500 μl bacteria in the exponential growth phase with 500 μl 20% glycerol in Lysogeny broth (LB) from an overnight culture in a cryogenic vial and stored at -80°C or in liquid nitrogen.",
    "(Optional) Adoptive transfer of OT-I CD8 T cellsNotes:   This step is optional in case one wishes to study the dynamics of antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses. The adoptive cell transfer should be done one day before or on the day of the infection.  Keep cells and reagents on ice unless otherwise indicated. Sacrifice one OT-I transgenic (CD45.2) mouse using CO2, isoflurane, or ketamine-xylazine according to the applicable rule for work with experimental mice.Collect lymphoid organs, such as spleen and lymph nodes, from the mouse into cold PBS containing 2% FCS (FACS buffer, see Recipes) in 15 ml tubes on ice. This donor mouse should be sex-and-age-matched to the congenic (CD45.1) recipient.Bring the organs to a biosafety cabinet class I. Insert a 100 µm cell strainer into a 50 ml tube and place on ice. Place the lymphoid organs onto the cell strainer and carefully mash in circular motions with the blunt end of a 5 ml syringe. Gently rinse the strainer into the 50 ml tube with the FACS buffer using a 1 ml pipette. Repeat the procedure until no tissue clumps are left in the strainer.Remove the cell strainer and screw the cap onto the 50 ml tube. Centrifuge at 1,200 rpm (equivalent to 293 rcf) for 7 min at 4°C. Open the tube in the biosafety cabinet and decant the supernatant.Add 3 ml of 1× erythrocyte lysis buffer (see Recipes) and mix by pipetting up and down. Incubate for 3 min at RT. Top up with 6 ml of FACS buffer and centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 7 min at 4°C.Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of Buffer C (see Recipes). The pellet should now have a whitish color.Mix the cell suspension thoroughly by pipetting up and down with a 200 µl pipette.",
    "Add 4-9 ml of Buffer C. Count cells, e.g., using a Luna cell counter: In a U-bottom well of a 96-well plate mix 1.5 µl of Acridine Orange/Propidium Iodide Stain + 13.5 µl of cell suspension. Load 10 µl on the slide to assess the fraction of live cells. Alternatively, any cell counter or a hemocytometer and trypan blue can be used.Remove 1 × 106 cells and save in FACS buffer at 4°C for flow cytometry analysis at a later time point (see below in Procedure E).Isolate naïve CD8 T cells using the Naïve CD8a+ T Cell Isolation Kit, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.For every 1 × 107 cells, resuspend the pellet in 40 µl of Buffer C + 10 µl of biotin-antibody cocktail in a 15 ml tube. Mix well and incubate for 10 min at 4°C.For 1 × 107 cells, add 20 of µl Buffer C + 20 µl of anti-biotin microbeads + 10 µl of anti-CD44 microbeads. Mix well and incubate for another 15 min at 4°C.Add 10 ml of Buffer C and centrifuge at 287 × g for 7 min at 4°C.Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 ml of Buffer C.Place a pre-cooled (4°C) LS column in the magnetic field of the Miltenyi MidiMACS separator.Rinse the column with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer C. Discard the flow-through.Place a 15 ml tube on ice and position it below the outlet of the column. Load the 3 ml of cell suspension onto the column and collect the flow-through in a 15 ml tube. Rinse each column once with 3 ml of Buffer C. The total volume of the collected flow-through is 6 ml.Count cells (see Step B7).",
    "Remove 1 × 106 cells and save in FACS buffer at 4°C for flow cytometry analysis at a later time-point (see below in Procedure E).Centrifuge at 287 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. Dilute cells in sterile PBS to reach the number of cells that need to be transferred per mouse.For experiments with 24 h engraftment prior to Lm infection and day 1 post-infection read-out, inject 3 × 106 cells per mouse in 100 μl of PBS (room-temperature, RT); for d3 post-infection read-out, inject 1 × 106 cells per mouse in 100 μl of PBS (RT); and for d7 or later post-infection read-out, inject 2 × 104 cells per mouse in 100 μl of PBS (RT). Resuspend cells prior to injection into the tail vein.Note: Engraftment can be assessed 24 h after adoptive cell transfer (when LmOVA is injected) by collecting 50 μl of peripheral blood according to the guidelines of the relevant animal experiment ethical permit and proceeding with flow cytometry analysis as described below (see below in Procedure E). Injection of LmOVA and monitoring of animalsPerform the infection of mice in a bio-safety level 2 (BSL-2) animal facility. Animals need to be housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC).Note: After infection, all used cages, including litter, need to be autoclaved. Measure individual mouse baseline body weight using a lockable box and a precision scale that can be disinfected.Note: Ideally, mice should get used to the daily weighting process 3-5 days prior to the experiment in order to avoid weight loss due to stress responses. It is also advisable to weigh the mice at the same time each day in order to avoid fluctuations due to food intake. Put an individual mouse into the restrainer.",
    "Note: To better visualize the vein and facilitate injection, the animals can be placed below an infrared lamp for 5-10 min, being careful not to overheat the animals. A video demonstrating this procedure can be found at the following link: Intravenous Injection in the Mouse: https://researchanimaltraining.com/articles/intravenous-injection-in-the-mouse/[href=https://researchanimaltraining.com/articles/intravenous-injection-in-the-mouse/].Intravenously inject well mixed LmOVA, as prepared in Procedure A, into mice via the tail vein using a 29G insulin syringe. Inject 200 μl of a 5 × 104 bacteria/ml dilution per mouse for a total of 104 bacteria (Figure 2). Discard the needle and syringe in a biohazard sharps container for later autoclaving.Note: Infection can be done either in healthy wild-type mice or in mice that had received OT-I cells the day before by adoptive cell transfer. To determine the actual CFU that was injected, follow procedure A5 (see above).Monitor the weight and general wellbeing of the animals every day for the first 7 days after bacterial infection. An initial weight drop is expected on days 1-3; later on, a recovery in weight can be observed. Monitor the consistency of the feces, which should be softer and lighter in color compared to normal conditions.Note:  Check the general appearance of the mice carefully, corresponding to your experimental animal license. Severe pain, suffering, and distress must be prevented. Preparing spleen homogenates for platingNotes:  Lm can be detected in the spleen for up to 7 days after infection in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. In animals that had received OT-I cells, the bacteria are cleared faster and are rarely detected on day 7 (unpublished observation). The bacterial load can be assessed during the acute phase (24 h and 3 days after infection) and/or during peak immune response (7 days after infection). A fraction of the spleen can be used to evaluate immune cells via flow cytometry.",
    "In this case, after recording the spleen weight, the preparation of single-cell suspensions should be generated following steps 1-8 in procedure B, and subsequently, only 50% of the cell suspension will be lysed in 0.14%Tergitol/PBS for plating onto LB Agar plates. The other 50% can be used for flow cytometric analysis as described in procedure E. All work should be performed in a biosafety cabinet class II and with adequate protective gear. Sacrifice animals as described in Procedure B1 and collect spleens in 15 ml conical tubes containing 5 ml of cold FACS buffer; store the tubes on ice.Bring the spleen to a biosafety cabinet class II. Record the weight of the spleen. If CD8 T cell responses are to be analyzed in parallel by flow cytometry, proceed with the weighing of 50% of the spleen.Mash the spleen (or 50% of the organ) in a sterile 100 mm × 15 mm Petri dish in 5 ml of 0.14%Tergitol/PBS. Tergitol causes immediate cell lysis and releases intracellular bacteria.Prepare serial 10-fold dilutions of the cell lysate in PBS ranging from 1:10 to 1:1,000,000 and plate 100 μl of each dilution in technical duplicates by spreading onto LB + erythromycin LB Agar plates. Grow upside-down at 37°C for 24 h (Figure 2).After 24-48 h, count the colonies. Plates with CFU between 30-300 should be used to determine the bacterial load (Figure 2). An example calculation is provided in Table 2:Table 2. Example calculation of CFUsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211201/20211201235705_3059.jpg CFU = colony forming units, Ga CFU = Grand CFU, V = Volume, mg = milligram, hom. = homogenate. Average CFU is multiplied by 10 to get concentration per ml (100 μl × 10 = 1 ml).",
    "Preparing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for flow cytometry analysisNotes:  The same animal can be analyzed at various time points after LmOVA infection, such as early (d3), peak (d7), memory (d70), or after re-infection. PBMCs can also be collected one day after ACT to assess the engraftment of OT-I cells. Collect 50 μl of peripheral blood (approx. 2-3 drops) from either the mandibular or tail vein into an Eppendorf tube with 10 μl of heparin.Transfer the tube into a biosafety cabinet class II.Transfer 50 μl of the blood/heparin mixture into 10 ml of homemade erythrocyte lysis buffer (see Recipes) in a 50 ml tube and incubate for 5 min at RT. Then add 20 ml of FACS buffer.Centrifuge at 287 × g for 7 min at 4°C and decant the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of FACS buffer and count the cells as described above (Procedure B7).Transfer 0.5 × 106-1 × 106 cells per FACS tube and centrifuge at 1,200 rpm (equivalent to 293 rcf) for 7 min at 4°C and decant the supernatant.Add 10 μl of Fc-Block (1:25 in FACS buffer), resuspend, and incubate for 5 min at RT or 4°C.Add 50 μl of the antibody mixture (diluted as described below) and stain for 30 min at 4°C, protecting from light.Note: Staining with SIINFEKL-tetramer should be performed at RT. Add 1 ml of FACS buffer, centrifuge at 1,200 rpm (equivalent to 293 rcf) for 7 min at 4°C, and decant the supernatant.Fix the cells with 1% PFA/PBS for 20 min at RT.Wash the cells with 1 ml of FACS buffer and centrifuge at 1,200 rpm (equivalent to 293 rcf) for 7 min at 4°C and decant the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 200 μl of FACS buffer and acquire on a flow cytometer.",
