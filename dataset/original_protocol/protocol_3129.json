Once the bats can successfully attack the tethered bird specimens, the formal experiment can start the following night.\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nNote: In this experiment, a successful attack was defined as the use of wings by the bats to flap or directly attack taxidermized bird specimens and/or the emission of echolocation calls with a feeding buzz.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nFormal experimental phase\nPlace a planar star-shaped four-microphone array (Condenser ultrasound microphone CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) in the middle of one end of the flight room, with the central microphone at 2.1 m from the ground.\nPlace the other three microphones around the periphery of the microphone array, with each microphone 60 cm apart from the central microphone.\nEnsure that all microphones are positioned at an angle of 120° from each other (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2900-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(B) A photograph of the on-site setup. In (B), since the high-speed cameras were placed 1.5 m above the ground in the flight room, the camera lens was thus tilted upward at an angle in order to cover a larger spatial area. Thus, the three bird specimens did not look at the same height in the on-site photograph, but in fact they are all 2.1 m above the ground.\nIn the large-sized flight room (9 m × 3.7 m × 3.9 m), tilt the microphone array upward at an angle of 20° from the ground (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nOptional: Alternatively, if select a medium-sized flight room (e.g., 6 m × 3.4 m × 3.7 m), the microphone array may be placed perpendicular to the ground.\nNote: In this protocol, we consider the main difference between medium-sized and large flight rooms is their length. A length less than 8 m but not less than 5 m is considered as a medium-sized flight room, and a length greater than 8 m is considered a large flight room.\nSet up a high-speed imaging system (AcutEye V4.0, RockTech Technology Corp., Ltd., Hunan, China) in the flight room (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPlace a high-speed camera approximately 1.5 m above the ground and align it parallel to the plane of the microphone array.\nPlace another high-speed camera at the same height on the opposite end of the sidewall.\nPosition four infrared light sources at the four corners of the flight room, approximately 1.5 m above the ground, in order to augment the infrared illumination (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: The configuration of the high-speed imaging system we used consisted of two high-speed infrared-sensitive cameras (MV1-D1312IE-240-CL-8, Photonfocus AG, Lachen, Switzerland), a synchronous controller (AcuteSync-20K, RockTech), and four customized infrared lights (KTJ-GY-300W-42V, RockTech).\nHang bird specimens in the flight room.",
    "Hang horizontally one bird specimen (Bird 1) at 2 m in front of the central microphone of the microphone array and 2.1 m above the ground.\nHang horizontally two other bird specimens (Bird 2 and Bird 3) at 2 m in front of Bird 1 and 1.5 m apart from each other at the same height (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nDuring the experiment, randomly select one bat and place in the flight room for the experiment every night (between 2000 h and 2400 h).\nNote: See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nConnect the microphones to a four-channel ultrasound recording device (UltraSoundGate 416H, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany), which also connect to a desktop computer running the Avisoft Recorder software to record bat echolocation calls at a sampling frequency of 500 kHz and a resolution of 16 bits.\nUse the synchronous controller (AcuteSync-20K, RockTech) to connect two infrared high-speed cameras (MV1-D1312IE-240-CL-8, Photonfocus AG) to the same computer that was connected to the ultrasound recording device to receive synchronous recordings of bat vocalizations and attack behavioral repertoire (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCritical: In order not to interfere with the flight of bats and their ability to detect and localize the suspended preys, it is recommended to position the equipment either around the flight room or near the walls, away from the direction in which the bats are flying within the flight room.\nDual-choice acoustic playback experiment\nTiming: 4–5 h/day for 20–30 days\nNote: The number of days for this experiment includes an interval of 2–3 days between two randomly repeated experiments.",
    "This section describes a step-by-step procedure for the dual-choice acoustic playback experiments by randomly broadcasting audio files in the selection chambers of the dual-choice experimental flight cage. We used two ultrasound loudspeakers (Dynamic Speaker Vifa, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) at each end of the flight cage to broadcast bird calls and silence playback files (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). This experiment consisted of two groups: 1) silence vs. bird calls; 2) specimen + silence vs. specimen + bird calls (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2900-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The method is as follows: according to the induced vocalization method in darkness described by Lanzone et al. (2009),16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] wild birds should be exposed to the acoustic stimuli of downloaded flight calls to induce calling by using an ultrasound loudspeaker (Dynamic Speaker Vifa, Avisoft Bioacoustics). Then, an UltrasoundGate 116H device (Avisoft Bioacoustics) can be used to record the calls of individual birds at a sampling frequency of 50 kHz and a resolution of 16 bits.",
    "Randomly select high-quality calls from each bird and edit to generate two 10-s call sequences within their call intervals using the Avisoft SASLab Pro software (version 5.2.07, Avisoft Bioacoustics) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2900-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Use two ultrasound microphones (CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics) connected to the four-channel Avisoft UltraSoundGate 416H (Avisoft Bioacoustics; sampling at 250 kHz) and the AcutEye high-speed image system (V4.0, RockTech) to simultaneously record the choices and behavioral and acoustic responses of the bats (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: Several nights before the experiment, individual bats were placed in the dual-choice experimental flight cage to acclimatize them to the equipment and the environment at their peak foraging activity from 2000 h to 2400 h.\nCritical: The intensity of the bird call playback files needed to be approximately consistent with the call intensity of birds in the field; the intensity of the playback bird call files was measured by adjusting the sound volume of the ultrasound playback system (Avisoft Bioacoustics) before the experiment. A sound level meter (Casella CEL-633C1/K1, Kempston, Bedford, UK) was kept 1 m in front of the horizontal direction of the loudspeaker, and it was maintained at about 75 dB peSPL.\nCritical: All devices were placed outside the flight cage.\nDual-choice visual presentation experiment\nTiming: 4–5 h/day for 30–45 days\nNote: The number of days for this experiment includes a 2- to 3-day interval between any two randomly repeated experiments.\nThis step describes the procedure of the dual-choice visual presentation experiment by alternating the hanging of bird specimens and changing the light intensity at each end of the flight cage (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). We simulated the lighting conditions (including darkness, moonlight, and dim light) of bats when they encounter birds at night. This experiment consisted of three groups: 1) specimen + darkness vs. specimen + moonlight; 2) specimen + darkness vs. specimen + dim light; 3) specimen + moonlight vs. specimen + dim light (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C–6E).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2900-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Ltd., Taiwan, China) to measure the ambient light intensity.\nNote: Measure the light intensity across multiple days and during multiple periods per day.\nObtain range values for the simulation experiment.\nNote: In this experiment, they included darkness (0–0.02 lux), moonlight (0.05–0.40 lux), and dim light (1.50–4.00 lux). These values corresponded to the illuminance when the bats flew out after dusk and returned to their caves before dawn.\nSet the 6-W remote-controlled intelligent LED table lamps (TL8012, Glonew Lighting, Shenzhen Glonew Lighting Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China) in the central position below each selection chamber of the dual-choice experimental flight cage 40 cm above the ground to simulate different light intensities (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C–6E).\nUse the illuminometer (Pro’sKit MT-4617LED-C) to measure and match the actual ranges of the three lighting conditions (i.e., darkness, moonlight, and dim light).\nHang two bird specimens in the center of two selection chambers on the same side of the dual-choice experimental flight cage 45 cm from the top of the cage (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C–6E).\nPlace the bat at the take-off spot to acclimate for 30 s.\nNote: See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nSwitch on the LED table lamps to illuminate the surroundings at the predetermined intensity for 5 min.",
    "Critical: The experiment was randomly repeated with each bat five times at both ends of the dual-choice experimental flight cage (Chambers 1 and 2, Chambers 3 and 4), with an interval of 2–3 days between any two randomly repeated experiments.\nNote: See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nUse the AcutEye high-speed image system (V4.0, RockTech) and two ultrasound microphones (CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics) connected to a four-channel Avisoft UltraSoundGate 416H device (Avisoft Bioacoustics; sampling at 250 kHz) to synchronously record the preferences and behavioral and acoustic responses of the bats (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nNote: See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCritical: As with the acoustic playback experiments, each bat was placed in the dual-choice experimental flight cage from 2000 h to 2400 h every day to familiarize them with the experimental setup (no bird specimens were present at this time) a few nights before the start of the formal experiment.\nCritical: The test bats were fed three to five superworms before the experiment to motivate them and enhance their desire to detect the target prey. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCritical: All devices were placed outside the flight cage except for the LED lights."
