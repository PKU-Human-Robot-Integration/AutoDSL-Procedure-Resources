    "All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison under Protocol no. V005717. The following protocol involves working in a Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) facility for human pathogens, although none of the schistosome stages depicted in this protocol are infective to humans or other mammals. Follow institutional policies for handling Risk Group 2 (RG2) human pathogens.\nNOTE: We use female Swiss-Webster mice (6-week old) due to their higher susceptibility to infection10, thereby yielding larger egg burdens. Tucker et al. describe the mouse and snail infection protocols used in this model system11. The Table of Materials lists all of the specific equipment, materials, reagents and animal sources needed to carry out this experimental protocol.\n1. Processing of infected livers\nEuthanize mice, 6-7 weeks post-infection, by CO2 asphyxiation (rate of 10-30% of the chamber's volume per minute). Monitor mice for cessation of respiration and heartbeat.\n\tNOTE: Typically, up to 20 mice may be processed at a given time.\nAfter transferring euthanized mice to a biosafety cabinet, place mice on their backs and spray their ventral surfaces with 70% ethanol. Let soak for 1 min.\nPinch and pull up skin of the lower abdomen and cut across the base of the pinched skin closest to the abdomen with sterile surgical scissors. Pull the cut skin anteriorly (i.e., toward the head) to reveal the liver. Note that the liver should be enlarged and speckled due to an egg-induced granulomatous response (Figure 2A).\nRemove the liver and place it in a beaker containing 200 mL of sterile 1.2% NaCl solution containing pen/strep.\nRepeat steps 1.3 and 1.4 with remaining mice.\n\tNOTE: Twenty mice are usually processed in a single harvest.",
    "Place the livers in a sterile Petri dish and remove non-liver fat/connective tissues with sterile forceps.\nTransfer trimmed/cleaned livers to a sterile 250-mL centrifuge bottle containing ~200 mL of sterile 1.2% NaCl solution with pen/strep.\nVigorously shake the bottle containing the livers and, using a sterile disposable pipette, remove the excess surface foam/floating debris. Slowly pour off the remaining saline solution into a container or sink containing 1% bleach (disinfectant).\nAdd ~200 mL of fresh saline solution to the livers and repeat step 1.8 three more times.\n2. Liver extraction and miracidial isolation\nPlace the livers into a small sterile stainless-steel blender cup and add ~2 mL of 1.2% NaCl solution (Figure 2B).\nCover the cup with foil and a petri dish to prevent spills, and blend for 1 min by alternating low and high speed (20 s low speed/10 s high speed; repeat) (Figure 2C).\nEvenly distribute the blended liver suspension into sterile 250-mL centrifuge bottles (for 20 livers use 4 bottles).\nAdd sterile saline with antibiotics to ~200 mL total volume/bottle. Weigh/balance bottles prior to centrifugation.\nCentrifuge the blended livers at 290 x g for 15 min at 4 oC. Gently pour off supernatants into a container with bleach prior to discarding.\nRepeat steps 2.4-2.5 once. Be sure to thoroughly resuspend liver sediment prior to centrifugation.\nAfter discarding the last saline wash (Step 2.6), add 200 mL sterile pond water with pen/strep to the pelleted liver tissue, shake to resuspend sediment, and transfer the suspension to a sterilized 1-L volumetric flask that has been completely covered with aluminum foil, except for the top 3 cm of the neck (Figure 2D).\n\tNOTE: Use two bottles (= 10 livers) per 1-L flask. Pond water simulates the natural freshwater environment needed to stimulate miracidial hatching from eggs.",
    "Using sterile pond water, fill up the flask to approximately 3 cm above the foil covering on neck. Then, without delay (as miracidia soon begin to hatch), remove residual foam and liver tissue floating to the surface by quickly pipetting up ~12 mL of pond water containing debris and discarding it into a separate discard tube. Replace with fresh sterile pond water.\nRepeat cleaning Step 2.8, three more times, checking for presence of miracidia in the discard tube. Cease repetition of cleaning step if miracidia appear in the wash solution.\nAfter the last wash, slowly add ~12 mL of warm sterile pond water (pre-warmed to 30 oC) to create a temperature gradient with clean, sterile warm water on top.\n\tNOTE: This is best accomplished by slowly discharging water along the side of the flask neck to avoid mixing.\nPlace a small Petri dish cover over the flask opening and shine a bright light across the top of the flask above the foil cover to illuminate the upper surface of water.\n\tNOTE: Typically, within 5-10 min, swimming miracidia, attracted to the light, will concentrate in large numbers within the first 2-3 cm of pond water (Figure 3A).\n3. Miracidial harvesting and cultivation\nWhen miracidia have amassed at the surface after 10 min, using a sterile transfer pipet, remove ~8 mL of pond water and transfer to a sterile 15-mL centrifuge tube. Place the tube containing miracidia on ice.\nAdd back 8 mL of warm sterile pond water along the inside of the volumetric flask and wait another 10 min.\nUsing new tubes each time, repeat steps 3.1 and 3.2 three more times. After the 4th collection, keep the final tube on ice for 10 min to allow the miracidia to settle. This set of tubes comprises the first harvest.",
    "Centrifuge tubes containing miracidia at 290 x g for 1 min at 4 oC in a pre-cooled refrigerated centrifuge.\nImmediately remove most of the supernatant (~7 mL) being careful not to disturb the parasite pellet (Figure 3B).\nPool all the miracidia from this first harvest into one tube, then rinse all of the original tubes with ~1 mL sterile pond water and add to the \"pooled\" tube.\nAllow parasites to settle on ice for ~5 min, and again centrifuge the parasites at 290 x g for 1 min at 4 oC.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and add 6-8 mL sterile Chernin's balanced salt solution (CBSS+; see Table of Materials) containing pen/strep.\nGently suspend the miracidia and aliquot them into a 24-well culture plate (1 mL per well), followed by rinsing the tube in 6-8 mL CBSS+ and adding 1 mL of rinse to each well. Incubate parasites at 26 oC under normoxic conditions. Concentrations of isolated miracidia will vary, but will usually average ~7000/mL.\nIf parasites are still concentrating at the light source, repeat Steps 3.1 to 3.9 to continue harvesting late-hatching miracidia but increase the time interval between collections to 15-20 min.\n\tNOTE: This new set of tubes represents the second harvest. However, because miracidial numbers typically are low, larvae from all tubes usually are pooled into a single culture well containing 2 mL CBSS+.\nAt 24 h post-harvest and cultivation, gently resuspend sporocysts in their wells by pipetting.\nWait a few min to allow parasites to settle to the bottom of the wells. Once they have settled, carefully remove the supernatant (~1.5 mL), which will contain most of the ciliated epidermal plates shed by miracidia during larval transformation. This \"transformation\" supernatant may either be discarded or incorporated into follow-up studies of larval secretory products.",
    "Add 1.5 mL of fresh CBSS+ to each well and gently pipette to resuspend sporocysts. Repeat step 3.12 if further washing or changing to a different medium is desired.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
