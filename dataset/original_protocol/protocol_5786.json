    "The procedure outlined below is generally applicable across a wide array of conditions and has been successfully used to survey bacterial and archaeal community composition in the greenhouse and the field (Edwards et al., 2015), as well as across environmental perturbations (Santos-Medellín et al., 2017) and plant developmental stages (Edwards et al., 2018). Notes: Contamination control Because introduced contaminants can obscure the compositional data generated from this protocol, it is important to observe the following measures to minimize contamination: Always wear gloves.Before starting each main step, wipe your hands and work surface with 70% ethanol.Avoid leaving bottles and tubes open to the environment.Use filtered pipette tips for Procedure A (compartment separation), B (DNA extraction), and C (PCR amplification). After PCR, you can switch to sterile non-filtered tips. For sample storage Preprocessed roots should be stored for no longer than 24 h at 4 °C before compartment separation. Additionally, individual compartments should be separated before storing them for longer periods of time at -80 °C. Freezing and thawing preprocessed roots will cause microbial cells to lyse and the DNA to possibly diffuse across compartments, therefore reducing resolution. For the rhizosphere compartment, pipette 500 µl of the soil suspension generated in Step A4 to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube, spin down (10,000 x g for 1 min), remove the supernatant, and store at -80 °C. When ready to perform DNA extractions, thaw samples at room temperature (~23 °C) and resuspend the rhizosphere in 500 µl of PBS.For the rhizoplane compartment, store the 500 µl of concentrated microbial suspension generated in Step A6 at -80 °C. When ready to perform DNA extractions, thaw samples at room temperature (~23 °C).For the endosphere compartment, use fire-sterilized forceps to transfer 0.25 g of the thrice-sonicated roots from Step A7 to a 1.",
    "5 ml microfuge tube and store at -80 °C. When ready to perform DNA extractions, thaw samples at room temperature (~23 °C). Compartment separation of root-associated microbiota The following protocol uses a combination of washing and sonicating steps to separate the rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and endosphere fractions of the root-associated microbiota. This approach has been successfully employed to harvest compositionally distinct communities that harbor microorganisms enriched in each of these spatial compartments (Edwards et al., 2015). The protocol for separation of the rhizoplane is based on the method for endospheric bacteria isolation developed by Lundberg et al. (2012). The method utilizes a bath sonicator to remove the microbiota in the rhizoplane, and avoids hypochlorite treatment for the reasons detailed in Lundberg et al. (2012). Because the DNA yields from rhizoplane samples are low, the sequences can exhibit higher variability following PCR amplification, and may require additional replicates to draw statistically significant conclusions. It should be noted that the compartment dissection protocol cannot ensure complete purity of samples free of contamination from adjacent compartments, especially where they overlap spatially, but despite these limitations the protocol has been proven to be efficient and reproducible for studies of overall compositional profiles (Edwards et al., 2015; Santos-Medellin et al., 2017; Edwards et al., 2018). All steps are visually detailed in Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Collection of rice roots and separation of compartments Using gloves, harvest the rice plant by firmly holding the shoot and slowly pulling the root system out of the ground (Figure 1A). In the case of seedlings, carefully scoop the roots to avoid ripping the tissue.Vigorously shake the roots to remove loose soil, leaving only the soil layer firmly attached to the root. This layer constitutes the rhizosphere compartment (Figure 1B).",
    "Using flame-sterilized scissors, cut ~5 cm of root immediately below the root-shoot junction (red box Figures 1B and 1C) and place the tissue in a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube with 15 ml of autoclaved PBS solution. For potted plants, avoid collecting roots immediately adjacent to the inner walls.Vortex the roots for 15 sec to mix the rhizosphere fraction in the PBS solution (Figure S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180610/2884 Supplemental Figure S1.docx]). Save the resulting soil suspension for DNA extraction (Step B1).Using flame-sterilized forceps, transfer the roots to a new 50 ml Falcon tube. Wash the roots thoroughly by adding 20 ml of fresh PBS, vortexing for 15 sec at maximum speed, and discarding the PBS. Repeat these steps for a total of three washes (Figure 1D). If any soil remains in the bottom of the tube, perform additional washing steps until no soil is visible.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613194451_1683.jpgFigure 1. Root harvesting and processing for microbiome studies. A. Rice roots pulled out of the soil. B. Rice roots after being vigorously shaken to remove loose soil. The red box indicates the ~5 cm of root cut with flame-sterilized scissors. C. Rice root section collected into 50 ml Falcon tubes for compartment separation. The soil layer firmly attached to the roots constitutes the rhizosphere. D. Rice root section after being thoroughly washed with sterile PBS solution.Separate the rhizoplane compartment by sonicating the roots for 30 sec at 50-60 Hz and transferring the 10 ml of PBS with the sonicated microbes to a new tube (Figure S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180610/2884 Supplemental Figure S1.docx]). Add 1.5 ml of the microbial suspension to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube, spin down at 10,000 x g for 1 min and discard 1 ml of supernatant. Add 1 ml of microbial suspension, spin down (10,000 x g for 1 min), and discard 1 ml.",
    "Repeat these steps once more for a total of three centrifugations. Resuspend the pellet by vortexing (15 sec) and save the concentrated microbial suspension for DNA extraction.Note: Depending on how much root material was sampled, a pellet may or may not be visible.Add enough fresh PBS to fully cover the roots and sonicate for 30 sec at 50-60 Hz. Discard the PBS and repeat this step once more. The thrice-sonicated roots constitute the endosphere compartment (Figure S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180610/2884 Supplemental Figure S1.docx]).DNA ExtractionUse the DNeasy PowerSoil kit to isolate the genomic DNA from the root-associated communities. The input for each of the compartments is as follows:For the rhizosphere compartment, add 500 µl of the soil suspension generated in Step A4 to a PowerBead tube. Note: Large particles which inhibit the uptake of the soil suspension into the pipette tip should be avoided. If the pipette tip is too clogged to continue, retrieve a new pipette tip. Repeat the process until successful.For the rhizoplane compartment, transfer the 500 µl of concentrated microbial suspension generated in Step A6 to a PowerBead tube.For the endosphere compartment, use fire-sterilized forceps to transfer 0.25 g of the thrice-sonicated roots from Step A7 to a PowerBead tube. Pre-homogenize the endosphere by bead-beating the roots in the PowerBead tube with the included garnet particles for 1 min. After adding the samples to the PowerBead tubes, follow the PowerSoil kit protocol with these adjustments: After adding Solution C1, the PowerBead tubes can be homogenized using a beadbeater for 2 min instead of vortexing them for 10 min. Elute the final product in 30 µl of Solution C6 instead of 100 µl.16S rRNA amplificationFor library construction, this protocol uses primer 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.",
    "Primer design for Illumina sequencing follows the one described in Caporaso et al. (2012), except both forward and reverse primers are barcoded (Figure 2). By using a unique combination of barcodes for each sample, this dual-indexing strategy allows us to multiplex a large number of libraries with a limited amount of primers. Full sequences for the forward primers can be found on this GitHub page[href=https://github.com/bulksoil/BioProtocol/blob/master/FWD_primer_seq.tsv] and the reverse primers can be found on this GitHub page[href=https://github.com/bulksoil/BioProtocol/blob/master/RVS_primer_seq.tsv]. We recommend working with sets of 24 samples, in which all reactions share the same barcoded 515F primer but have a unique 806R barcode. Additionally, it is important to run a negative control for each individual reaction to detect any potential contamination.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613195249_4192.jpgFigure 2. Schematic of 16S V4 region amplicon. A. Genomic regions before amplification. The primer binding sites are blue and the number corresponds to the position within the 16S rRNA gene where the primers bind. B. Amplicon after PCR amplification. FBC stands for forward barcode and RBC stands for reverse barcode. C. The sequencing strategy for the amplicons. Note that three custom primers are used in the sequencing: a primer for the forward read starting at position 515, a primer for the reverse sequencing read starting at position 806, and a primer for the reverse barcode. A list of forward primer[href=https://github.com/bulksoil/BioProtocol/blob/master/FWD_primer_seq.tsv] sequences and reverse primer[href=https://github.com/bulksoil/BioProtocol/blob/master/RVS_primer_seq.tsv] sequences can be found on GitHub.For a set of 24 reactions and 24 negative controls, prepare a master mix using the following recipe:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180613/20180613195756_1549.jpgAliquot 20.5 µl of the master mix into each PCR tube.Add 2.5 µl of the corresponding 10 µM barcoded 806R primer into each tube and mix well by pipetting.Aliquot 11.5 µl of each reaction into new PCR tubes to run as negative controls. Add 1 µl of the corresponding template to the remaining 11.5 µl.",
    "Cap the tubes and spin down.Run the following touchdown PCR program:Initial denaturation:95 °C, 5 min7 cycles, decreasing the annealing temperature 2 °C each cycle:95 °C, 45 sec65 °C, 1 min (-2 °C/cycle)72 °C, 1:30 30 cycles:95 °C, 45 sec50 °C, 30 sec72 °C, 1:30 Final extension:72 °C, 10 minPause:4 °C, ∞Note: If the user is experiencing a high sample to sample variation, there may be noise generated during the PCR step. The Earth Microbiome Project has established a protocol[href=http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/] where 3 separate PCRs are performed between samples and subsequently pooled in order to minimize variation. GelAdd 1 µl of PCR product to 5 µl of gel loading dye (1x).Run the samples on a 1% agarose gel at 120 V for 20 min.Verify proper amplification (expected band size is ~400 bp long) and absence of contamination in the negative controls.PCR CleanupRemove beads from 4 °C and allow them to reach room temperature (~23 °C).Prepare a fresh batch of 70% ethanol solution (500 µl/reaction). Aliquot 9 µl of the PCR product into a new 0.2 ml tube.Add 5.4 µl (0.6 volume) of Ampure XP beads, mix by pipetting, and let incubate at room temperature (~23 °C) for 5 min. We have found that 0.6x volume of AMPure beads to PCR product is the correct ratio to remove primer dimers and unused primers while leaving PCR product intact. Users of this protocol may need to experiment to ensure that this ratio also works for their experiments.Transfer the tubes to a magnet plate and let stand for 2 min.Carefully remove the cleared solution without disturbing the beads.Keeping the tubes on the magnet plate, add 200 µl of 70% ethanol, incubate for 30 sec, and remove with a pipette. Repeat this step once more for a total of two ethanol washes.",
    "For the final wash, remove all ethanol from the bottom. With the tubes still on the magnet plate, air-dry the beads for 2 min. Take care not to over-dry the beads as this will prevent the beads from being resuspended in Step E9.Take the plates off the magnet plate, add 50 µl of nuclease-free water, and resuspend the beads by pipetting up and down.Place the tube back to the magnet plate and incubate for 1 min.Transfer 35 µl of the eluant to a new tube.Quantification of amplicon librariesUse the Qubit dsDNA HS assay to measure the concentrations of the purified libraries:Set up two Assay Tubes for the standards and one for each sample to be quantified. Make sure not to label the side of the tube as this could interfere with the sample read.For each tube, prepare 200 µl of Qubit Working Solution by mixing 199 µl of Qubit buffer and 1 µl of Qubit Working Solution. It is important not to mix the working solution in a glass container.For the standards, aliquot 190 µl of working solution to 0.5 ml Assay Tubes, add 10 µl of the corresponding standard, and mix by vortexing. For the samples, aliquot 195 µl of working solution to 0.5 ml Assay Tubes, add 5 µl of the corresponding sample, and mix by vortexing.Incubate tubes for 2 min at room temperature.Select the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay on the Qubit Fluorometer, read the standards, and run each sample. Typical DNA concentrations range from 0.5 to 2.0 ng/µl.Pooling of amplicon librariesMultiplex ~150 libraries per MiSeq sequencing run. If multiple sequencing runs are needed, randomize the libraries across sequencing runs to avoid batch effects. Based on the range of concentrations obtained, determine a target amount of DNA to be pooled.",
    "Aim for at least 5 ng of DNA per sample. For each library, calculate the volume need by dividing the target amount of DNA by the sample concentration. Pool the libraries in a non-stick RNase-free 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Avoid pipetting volumes lower than 1 µl. If some samples are too concentrated, predilute them before pooling.Library concentrationRemove AmpureXP beads from 4 °C and allow them to reach room temperature.Prepare a fresh batch of 70% ethanol solution.Add 1.8 volumes of Ampure XP beads to the pooled libraries, mix by pipetting, and let incubate at room temperature for 5 min. 1.8x volume ensures that there is no loss of product due to saturation of beads.Transfer the tube to a magnet rack and let stand for 2 min.Carefully remove the cleared solution without disturbing the beads.Keeping the tubes on the magnet, add 1.5 ml of 70% ethanol, incubate for 30 sec, and remove with a pipette. Repeat this step once more for a total of two ethanol washes. For the final wash, remove all ethanol from the bottom. With the tube still on the magnet, air-dry the beads for 2 min.Take the tube off the magnet, add 50 µl of nuclease-free water, and resuspend the beads by pipetting.Place the tube back to the magnet and incubate for 1 min.Transfer the cleared eluant to a new tube.Gel cleanupRun the concentrated pool of libraries on a 1.8% agarose gel at 120 V for 40 min.Using a new blade, excise the ~400 bp band. Purify the libraries using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit.SequencingSubmit the pooled libraries for 2 x 250 MiSeq sequencing. Use the following custom sequencing primers:Read 1 Primer: TATGGTAATTGTGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAARead 2 Primer: AGTCAGTCAGCCGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT3’ Index Primer: ATTAGAWACCCBDGTAGTCCGGCTGACTGACTInclude a PhiX control for low diversity samples.",
    "Sequence analysisA more detailed version of the sequence analysis pipeline including code for running the analysis can be found on GitHub[href=https://github.com/bulksoil/BioProtocol/blob/master/ANALYSIS/SeqProcessing/seq_processing.md].Compile metadata in a spreadsheetAssign each sample a unique identifier. This identifier should be unique not just across a single experiment, but across all previous experiments as well. The identifier should only contain alphanumeric and period (“.”) characters.Create column(s) for barcodes. Each sample should have a unique barcode for each run.Create additional columns for the experimental variables associated with each sample. Some typical examples of experimental variables are root compartment, plant developmental stage, plant genotype, plot location, date, year, and collector.Note: A detailed protocol for designing a metadata table can be found at the Earth Microbiome Project's website[href=http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/metadata-guide/]. Download sequencing files from sequencing facilityDownloading of individual files can be accomplished either through an FTP client or by using command line tools (such as Wget).Demultiplex sequencesThere should be 4 fastq files provided by the sequencing facility: two read files (R1 and R2) and two index files (I1 and I2).Construct full-length contiguous sequencesFull-length sequences can be assembled using PANDAseq (Masella et al., 2012). Note that full-length contigs are not necessary for clustering OTUs using DADA2 (see below).Cluster Sequences and build OTU tableIf clustering with QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010), several options and algorithms are available. The user may want to conduct reference based clustering against a database of 16S rRNA genes (closed reference clustering) or a user may want to perform de novo OTU clustering. This method is known as closed reference clustering. Alternatively, a user may prefer to perform a hybrid between these two methods where sequences are first referenced against a database. Reads that do not have a match within the database are then clustered de novo. This method is known as open reference clustering.",
    "The user can define the similarity threshold for one read to be considered a match with an entry in the database. Historically, > 97% sequence identity has been used as the standard for clustering sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). One relatively new and extremely fast method for closed reference clustering of sequences into OTUs is through using the NINJA-OPS pipeline (Al-Ghalith et al., 2016). NINJA-OPS leverages the speed and memory efficiency of Bowtie (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), mapping reads back to a synthetic genome of concatenated 16S genes. This method can be performed on a laptop computer.Alternatively, users may prefer to bin sequences based upon exact matches using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016a). If using this method, there is no need to construct full-length contiguous sequences before clustering.Assign taxonomies to OTUsMultiple algorithms exist to assign taxonomies to the OTU sequences. If using closed-reference OTU clustering, there is no need to perform this step because the database sequences have already been classified (DeSantis et al., 2006). QIIME defaults to using the UCLUST (Edgar, 2010) algorithm for taxonomic assignment, while DADA2 uses the RDP naive Bayes method (Wang et al., 2007) for assigning taxonomies to sequences."
