    "The described protocol below follows the human care guidelines of Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark, and the University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. The step-wise protocol described below represents a potential, systematic approach for a typical patient with suspected lung cancer for whom US-TTNB was performed in an outpatient or daycase setting. Informed written consent was obtained from the patient. We have taken into account current clinical practices at the authors' institutions, as well as descriptions from previously published papers9,13,17,26, and have sought to achieve a balance between likely diagnostic success, costs, and patient experience, as described in the introduction. However, the approach can and should be modified in line with local differences in available equipment, clinical settings, patient preferences, and specific requirements for the obtained biopsy material, including if a non-malignant lesion is suspected. Any US-TTB should also be performed in accordance with existing local, national, and international guidelines and standards, where applicable. The protocol depends on there being one physician who is trained and competent in performing US-TTNB and one assistant, such as a procedural nurse. Both should have sufficient experience with the procedure and should be confident in the management of possible acute complications.\n1. Preprocedural assessment of available clinical information and imaging\nPrior to performing the procedure and informing the patient, assess the available clinical information to ensure that the procedure is indicated and clinically relevant.\nEnsure that there are no absolute contraindications for performing the procedure, such as uncorrected coagulopathy, manifest respiratory failure, known allergies to medications required for the procedure, or a patient who is unable to cooperate with the procedure.",
    "Assess the presence of any relative contraindications, and if any are present, ensure that the potential clinical impact of performing the procedure outweighs the associated risks. Relative contraindications may include reduced FEV1, the use of certain antiplatelet medications, or underlying lung disease.\nReview the available cross-sectional imaging, especially CT and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), if available. Ensure that the target lesion is in contact with the visceral pleura, located in an area likely to be accessible using TUS, and reachable with a biopsy needle.1\n\tâ€‹NOTE: If necessary, also consider which lesion(s) to biopsy and whether specific areas of the selected lesions (e.g., non-necrotic regions) should be prioritized.\n2. Preprocedural equipment control\nEnsure that all equipment needed for the procedure (see Table of Materials) is available in the procedural room, with spares where appropriate.\nEnsure that equipment needed for handling acute complications, especially pneumothorax, severe pain, and bleeding, is readily available in the procedural room and fully functioning.\nTurn on the US machine and ensure that relevant transducers are available and fully functioning (see Table of Materials).\n3. Checking and consenting the patient\nEnsure that it is the correct patient for the given procedure and that relevant materials (e.g., patient chart, imaging) and labels are also correct. In some centers, a pre-procedure checklist may be required depending on local and national guidelines27.\nProvide the patient (and/or proxy, if required) with oral and written information regarding the US-TTNB procedure, covering the individual steps prior to, during, and following the procedure.\nAlso, provide oral and written information regarding the most common (e.g., localized pain following the procedure) and rare but severe complications (e.g., pneumothorax, hemothorax).\nEnsure that there are no relevant allergies to any medication/materials used during the procedure.\nDocument written informed consent for the procedure from the patient (and/or proxy, where needed).",
    "4. Patient positioning\nUse the chosen biopsy site (see step 1.4) to determine the optimal patient positioning for the procedure.\n\tNOTE: Generally, a supine position is chosen for lesions located anteriorly or anterior-laterally. The patient can be placed on their side, with the hemithorax to be biopsied facing upward, for lesions located posteriorly or posterior-laterally.\nAssess whether the patient will be able to lie in and maintain the position deemed optimal for the US-TTNB procedure (see step 1.4) for at least 30 min.\n\tNOTE: If the answer to step 4.2 is yes, place the patient in the given position. If the answer is no, place the patient in an alternate position (e.g., sitting), assuming there is still an acceptable position for the procedure from the perspective of the operator and the patient. If holding the position is still not possible, consider alternative solutions to address patient comfort (e.g., intravenous opioids in case of localized pain in a given position). Occasionally, a switch to an alternative modality, such as CT-TTNB, may be necessary (Figure 1).\n5. Preprocedural thoracic ultrasound\nEnter the patient ID into the ultrasound machine to enable the storage of US images/clips, which should be saved frequently during the procedure.\nChoose the optimal transducer based on the placement and size of the lesion. Generally, a low-frequency curved (abdominal) transducer is optimal. A higher-frequency linear transducer is an alternative for very slim patients and/or very small lesions.\nSelect a general abdominal or lung preset.\nIdentify the target lesion using conventional 2D US and optimize the US image quality and position using depth, gain, and focus.",
    "Assess the target lesion using a simple \"eye-balling\" method and determine: (1) the appearance (e.g., hypo/hyperechoic, mixed pattern), (2) its demarcation (e.g., well/diffusely demarcated), (3) signs of obvious invasive growth (e.g., visible growth into the chest wall), and (4) indirect signs of possible invasive growth (e.g., absence of lung sliding without visible invasive growth)9 (Figure 2).\nMeasure the target lesion in at least two planes and measure the length of the pleural contact (Figure 2).\nPerform supplementary color Doppler assessment of the target lesion and the more superficially located structures (e.g., chest wall) and note the presence of: (1) signs of neovascularization, (2) larger vessels (e.g., intercostal arteries) to avoid during the biopsy procedure9,13.\nPerform a focused assessment of the affected hemithorax to determine whether lung sliding, a pleural effusion, or other obvious pathology is present prior to the biopsy procedure.\nBased on steps 1.4 and steps 5.5-5.7, choose the area within the target lesion to biopsy.\nUse the biopsy guidance system on the US machine to assist in choosing the optimal needle angle. Note the likely safe biopsy size (most cutting needles come with an option for either a 2 cm or 1 cm length biopsy, with the latter more appropriate in smaller lesions or those adjacent to vital structures).\nReconfirm image optimization once the optimal biopsy angle has been chosen.\nFix the transducer (see Table of Materials) in the optimal position for obtaining a biopsy and mark the placement on the patient's skin.\nIf the lesion is moving in synchrony with the patient's breathing, ask the patient to perform a breath hold to ensure that the patient can hold their breath for a sufficient time to obtain a biopsy (around 10-20 s).\n6. Patient monitoring and safety",
    "Attach the patient to physiological monitoring system (see Table of Materials) to typically allow for continuous or regular assessment of: (1) saturation, (2) pulse including ECG, and (3) blood pressure.\nInsert and flush a peripheral venous catheter (usually of a minimum size of 20 G).\n7. Biopsy equipment preparation\nAttach the biopsy guidance system to the transducer selected for the procedure. Set the angle of the biopsy guidance system to match the angle previously selected on the US machine (step 5.10).\nApply ultrasound gel (see Table of Materials) to the transducer and secure it in the \"transducer holder\" on the US machine.\nPrepare a sterile trolley and arrange the equipment necessary for the biopsy procedure (Figure 3).\nEnsure that the operator wears sterile gloves (with or without a gown).\nDisinfect the biopsy area and the surrounding skin area twice.\nAttach a surgical drape (see Table of Materials) with a hole to the patient's skin, using the mark made in step 5.11 as a guide.\n\tNOTE: If the operator chooses not to use a surgical drape, disinfect a larger area and place a drape below the biopsy site to ensure that any minor skin bleeding from the biopsy site is contained.\nDraw up an appropriate volume of local anesthetic (e.g., 20 mL of 1% lidocaine, see Table of Materials) in a syringe. Ensure that the amount of local anesthetic administered to the patient does not exceed the maximum recommended dose for their weight. Attach a 21 G hypodermic needle to the syringe.\n\tNOTE: The optimal length of the 21 G needle will depend on the length of the needle pathway from the skin to the biopsy area. In most patients, a length of 10 cm is optimal.",
    "Open the sterile US transducer biopsy kit (see Table of Materials) and place its contents on the sterile mobile table.\nWith assistance, position the sterile transducer cover over the transducer, ensuring that the previously applied US gel is evenly distributed between the \"footprint\" of the transducer and the sterile cover.\nPlace the two elastic bands from the sterile biopsy kit at the base of the transducer to ensure a snug fit between the transducer and the transducer cover, without any significant air trapped below the cover.\nAttach the plastic handle from the sterile US transducer biopsy kit to both the US transducer and the US biopsy guidance system.\nInsert the 21 G needle adapter into the plastic handle of the US transducer biopsy guide system.\nApply sterile gel from the sterile biopsy kit to the transducer.\n8. Injection of local anesthetics\nPosition the transducer at the previously chosen optimal area for performing the biopsy and ensure the selected needle angle is optimally placed with respect to the chosen biopsy area. Secure the transducer with the hand holding it to ensure complete stability during the injection of the local anesthetic.\nTake the syringe with the local anesthetic and place it in the biopsy guidance system without advancing it into the patient's skin. Ensure that the syringe is positioned in a way that aligns the tip of the needle parallel to the transducer's footprint.\n\tNOTE: This maximizes the surface area of the needle tip visible on the ultrasound screen, allowing for optimal visualization.\nInform the patient that local anesthetic will be applied and emphasize the importance of remaining still even if the application causes discomfort.\nSlowly introduce the syringe with the local anesthetic into the skin and subcutaneous tissue (Figure 4).",
    "NOTE: While doing so, ensure the following: (1) continuous visualization of the needle tip on the ultrasound screen, (2) aspiration before injecting to confirm that the local anesthetic is not being injected into a blood vessel, (3) focus on applying the majority of the local anesthetic in the subcutaneous area just below the skin and in the area just superficial to the parietal pleura, as these areas are the most sensitive (Figure 5).\nAfter applying the local anesthetic, slowly withdraw and remove the syringe.\nRemove the transducer from the patient's skin and wait at least 3 min to ensure the full effect of the local anesthetic before proceeding.\n9. Biopsy procedure\nRemove the 21 G needle adapter from the plastic handle of the US transducer biopsy guide system and insert the 18 G needle adapter instead.\nPrepare the core biopsy needle by ensuring that the spring of the biopsy needle can be \"loaded,\" \"fired\" without excessive force, and inform the patient that the sound generated when the biopsy needle is \"fired\" is normal.\n\"Load\" the core biopsy needle for the predetermined biopsy length (usually 1 or 2 cm) as determined in step 5.9.\nUsing a scalpel, make a small incision of a few millimeters in the skin corresponding to the hole left by the needle from applying the local anesthetic. If the incision is painful, wait an additional 2 min and then retest with the scalpel blade. If there is still pain, return to step 8.2 and apply additional local anesthetic, being careful not to exceed the maximum recommended dose.\nTake the core biopsy needle and place it in the biopsy guidance system without advancing it into the patient's skin.\nPosition the transducer with the mounted core biopsy needle on the patient's skin at the biopsy site.",
    "Insert the tip of the core biopsy needle a few millimeters into the previously made hole in the skin using a scalpel.\nCarefully adjust the angle and rotation of the transducer while maintaining good skin contact to ensure: (1) optimal image quality along the entire length of the needle/biopsy pathway and (2) optimal placement of the biopsy pathway with respect to the biopsy area and avoidance of vital structures and ribs. Once the optimal position is found, secure the transducer with the hand.\nGradually advance the core biopsy needle with the other hand while closely monitoring the progression of the needle tip on the US screen (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: Once the needle tip is placed just superficially to the parietal pleura, the next steps will depend on whether the lung lesion moves in synchrony with the patient's breathing or if it is fixed to the chest wall.\nAsk the patient to hold their breath when the target lesion is optimally positioned in relation to the biopsy pathway. Once the patient is holding their breath, continue to step 9.11. Note that the time for steps 9.11 to 9.13 should be minimized to avoid accidental respiratory movement of the lesion while the biopsy needle is inserted.\nAdvance the biopsy needle tip through the pleura until the tip is positioned just next to the \"biopsy target area\" in the needle pathway.\nAdvance the inner stylet of the core biopsy needle corresponding to the predetermined biopsy length when \"loading\" the needle (step 9.3). While advancing the inner stylet, ensure that the specimen notch is optimally placed within the target biopsy area (Figure 7).\nInform the patient that the biopsy needle will now be \"fired.\"",
    "\"Fire\" the core biopsy needle and subsequently slowly retract and remove the core biopsy needle from the patient. Once the needle has been removed, also remove the transducer.\nReload the core biopsy needle by pulling back on the plunger. Advance the inner stylet and remove the tissue specimen, placing it into the relevant biopsy container (Figure 8). This may require assistance using a small needle.\nOnce the biopsy has been removed from the specimen notch, retract the inner stylet, and once again place the core biopsy needle in the US transducer biopsy guidance system.\nRepeat steps 9.5 to 9.14 until a sufficient number of biopsies have been obtained.\n\tNOTE: When repeating step 9.8, ensure: (1) there are no immediate US signs of complications (e.g., loss of lung sliding, suggesting pneumothorax), and (2) adjust the biopsy angle slightly (if possible) to obtain biopsies from different areas within the target lesion.\nOnce the last biopsy has been placed in the biopsy specimen container, close the container and add any relevant fixation material/liquid to the container in accordance with local policy. Attach any necessary patient and sample identifier labels, double-checking that they are correct.\n10. Postprocedural thoracic ultrasound\nAfter the last biopsy, conduct TUS and evaluate for any immediate complications (e.g., pneumothorax, hemothorax) at the biopsy site. If no signs are present, apply a sterile dressing to cover the small biopsy incision.\nWith the patient in the supine position, examine the anterior surface of the hemithorax for signs of pneumothorax, and with the patient in the sitting position, assess the posterolateral surface for signs of developing hemothorax.\n11. Postprocedural patient observation and information\nIf the patient exhibits no symptoms, has stable vital signs, and shows no ultrasound signs of immediate complications, remove patient monitoring. Leave the peripheral venous catheter in place.",
    "Allow the patient to dress in their own clothes and instruct them to wait in the waiting room for 1 h.\nIf, within 1 h after the procedure, the patient has not displayed any signs or symptoms and is considered clinically stable, remove the peripheral venous catheter and discharge the patient with the necessary paperwork. If the patient does show signs or symptoms or is deemed clinically unstable by the staff, conduct further clinical and radiological assessments to determine the next steps.\nPrior to discharge, ensure that the patient and any relatives have comprehended the following: (1) the oral and written information regarding how to respond in case signs of complications develop after discharge and (2) the plan for when and how the patient will receive the results of the obtained biopsy.\nSubscription Required.
