    "1. Equipment setup\nAssemble the syringe pumps and SHM as follows.\n\t\nConnect the \"To Computer\" port of the secondary syringe pump (Pump 02, for aqueous solution) to the \"To Network\" port of the master syringe pump (Pump 01, for ethanol lipid solution) using Pump to Pump network cable (Figure 1, yellow).\nConnect the \"To Computer\" port of the master pump to the \"RS232 Serial\" port of the computer using PC to Pump network cable (Figure 1, blue).\nConnect tubing to each of the inlets and outlets of the SHM using a nut and ferrule. Convert the terminal of the tubing for both inlets to female Luer using another nut and ferrule and a union assembly. Longer tubing of the inlets allows easier attachment to the syringes (Figure 2).\nSet up the pump control software.\n\t\nAssign the address of the master syringe pump and secondary syringe pump to \"Ad:01\" and \"Ad:02\", respectively, using the \"Setup\" button of the syringe pump. This only needs to be done for the first time.\nOpen the pump control software on the computer. The two syringe pumps should be detected automatically, followed by a beeping sound. Otherwise, click Pumps and Search for pumps to update the connection. (Figure 3).\nAssign Diameter to 12.45 (mm) by choosing \"HSW Norm-Ject 5 cc (Dia=12.45)\".\nAssign Rate to 0.25 mL/min for Pump 01 (ethanol lipid solution) and 0.75 mL/min for Pump 02 (aqueous solution). The flow rates correspond to a total flow rate (TFR) of 1 mL/min and aqueous-to-ethanol flow rate ratio (FRR) of 3.\nAssign Volume to any values above 5 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The targeted infusion volume is set greater than the loaded liquid volume considering the void volume of the tubing.\nSelect INF (infusion) mode for both pumps.\nPress Set to confirm the settings.\n2. Prepare the LTSLs",
    "Prepare a LTSL10 or LTSL10-ICG lipid mixture (see Table 1).\nWithdraw 1 mL of lipid mixture and at least 3 mL of (NH4)2SO4 solution using two 5 mL Luer lock syringes.\nInstall the two syringes onto the syringe pumps in the upright position by sliding the barrel flange of the syringe to the syringe retainer of the pump, and the plunger flange of the syringe to the pusher block of the pump (Figure 4).\nWrap the end of the heating tape to the syringe with the aqueous solution. Wrap the other end of the heating tape and temperature probe of the thermostat around the syringe with the lipid solution. It is helpful to practice this step with empty syringes in place in order to ease the assembly process (Figure 5A).\nConnect the two syringes to the female Luer adaptors of the corresponding inlets of the SHM. Make sure the syringes containing the lipid mixture and (NH4)2SO4 solutions are connected ethanol inlet and aqueous inlet, respectively. Adjust the plunger position to remove air bubbles from the syringes (Figure 5B).\n\tNOTE: Ensure the syringes are still securely positioned onto the syringe retainer of the pumps.\nHeat up the syringes to above 51 °C using the heating tape using a 10 s heating session. Allow the thermostat to update the temperature of the syringes. Repeat this step in the following steps to maintain the temperature during the infusion.\n\tCAUTION: Turn off the heating tape after 10 s to prevent temperature overshoot and allow the thermostat to update the actual temperature. The heating tape should also be handled with care as its temperature rises very quickly. Heating continuously may damage the equipment and syringes, due to the time delay of the thermostat for updating the measured temperature.",
    "Once the temperature is above 51 °C, run the syringe pumps by pressing Run All in the pump control software (Figure 3).\nEnsure the fluid flow is free of air bubbles and any leakage. Dispose the initial volume (around 0.5 mL) of liquid from the outlet as waste.\n\tNOTE: This initial waste volume is not definite and depends on the internal volume of the setup, which is the volume for fluid to travel from the syringes through the tubing and SHM to the outlet.\nCollect the rest of the liquid as liposome samples into a microcentrifuge tube or bijou vial.\nPause/stop the infusion when the liquid in either of the syringes are almost empty.\n\tNOTE: The pumps should be stopped manually, since the pumps may not accurately detect the position when the syringes are empty.\nPlace the collected liposome solutions in a 60 °C water bath to anneal for 1.5 h.\n\tNOTE: This step is essential in enabling drug loading into the liposomes.\nTransfer the solutions to dialysis tubes. Dialyze the solutions against 1 L of 240 mM (NH4)2SO4 at 37 °C for at least 4 h to obtain purified liposomes.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Liposomes at this step are at 5 mM of phospholipid. Purified liposomes can be stored at 4 °C.\nTo clean the SHM for repeated use, flush the SHM sequentially with deionized water, ethanol and dry with nitrogen gas.\n3. Remote loading of DOX into LTSLs by transmembrane pH gradient\nExchange external buffer of LTSLs to HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) by using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to establish a transmembrane pH gradient.\n\t\nAdd a total of 25 mL of HBS to the top of a SEC column to prepare the column. Allow all eluent to elute through the column and dispose the eluate.",
    "Add 1 mL of dialyzed liposomes, prepared from step 2.12, to the column and dispose the elute.\nAdd 1.5 mL of HBS to the column and dispose the elute.\nAdd 3 mL of HBS to the column and collect the 3 mL of elute.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Liposomes are collected at this step and are at 1.67 mM of phospholipid. Buffer exchanged liposomes can be stored at 4 °C.\nIncubate LTSLs with doxorubicin (DOX) and purify LTSLs.\n\t\nAdd DOX solution in 1:20 DOX-to-phospholipid molar ratio into 1 mL of buffer-exchanged liposomes solution (1.67 mmol) contained in a bijou vial. This can be achieved by adding 48.4 µL of 1 mg/mL DOX solution (83.4 µmol).\nPlace the bijou vial in a 37 °C water bath for 1.5 h to allow DOX loading into the liposomes.\nMix 10 µL of the liposomes with 170 µL of HBS and 20 µL of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution in a black 96-well plate. Repeat for three wells. These wells correspond to the \"before purification\" DOX content.\nIn case of preparing LTSL10-ICG, mix 40 µL of the liposomes with 160 µL of DMSO in a clear 96-well plate. Repeat for three wells. These wells correspond to the \"before purification\" ICG content.\nPurify the liposome solution as described in step 3.1.\n\t\tNOTE: To reuse the column for future purification, clean the column from free DOX by first adding 1 mL of diluted 0.5 M NaOH solution before performing step 3.1.1. Free DOX in red will turn violet-blue and elute through the column quickly.",
    "Mix 30 µL of the purified liposomes solution with 150 µL of HBS and 20 µL of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution in a black 96-well plate. Repeat for three wells. These wells correspond to the \"after purification\" DOX content.\nIn case of LTSL10-ICG, mix 40 µL of the purified liposomes solution with 160 µL of DMSO in a clear 96-well plate. Repeat for three wells. These wells correspond to the \"after purification\" ICG content.\nMeasure the DOX fluorescence intensity of the wells before (step 3.2.3) and after (step 3.2.5) purification, using a microplate reader (λex = 485 nm, λem = 590 nm).\nCalculate the encapsulation efficiency of DOX (DOX EE) by taking the ratio of the fluorescence intensities before and after purification.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60907/60907eq1.jpg\nMeasure the ICG absorbance of the wells before and after purification, using a microplate reader (600 to 1000 nm).\nCalculate the encapsulation efficiency of ICG (ICG EE) by taking the ratio of the absorbance at 792 nm before and after purification, taking into account the dilution factor (3 times) during the purification.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60907/60907eq2a.jpg\n4. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)\nAdd 50 µL of liposomes solution (step 2.12) to 450 µL of deionized water.\nPlace the cuvette inside the DLS instrument and perform the measurement according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nRecord the mean Z-average diameter and dispersity of three measurements for each sample.\n5. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)\nConcentrate 1 mL of the liposomes samples (step 2.12) with a centrifugal filter unit to 0.5 mL (final lipid concentration of 10 mM). Using a fixed-angle rotor, spin at 7500 x g for approximately 15 min.\nTransfer 20 µL of (NH4)2SO4 solution and liposomes samples to two respective DSC pans. Seal the pans with DSC hermetic lids using the DSC sample press kit.",
    "Measure the sample from 30 °C to 60 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min using a differential scanning calorimeter.\nAnalyze the data with appropriate software. Take the phase transition temperature (Tm) as the onset of the phase transition (melting peak), which is measured by the x-intercept of the tangent of the point of maximum slope.\n6. Doxorubicin release\nPreheat HBS at designated temperature (37 or 42 °C) using a water bath. Prepare an ice water bath for quenching the samples.\nAdd 100 µL of purified DOX-loaded liposomes (step 3.2.5) into 1.9 mL of HBS in a microcentrifuge tube. Place the tube into the water bath of the designated temperature.\nWithdraw immediately 200 µL of samples from the tube and quickly place it in the ice water bath to quench any subsequent drug release. This sample corresponds to the initial (t = 0) time point.\nWithdraw 200 µL of samples at subsequent time points (t = 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 min) and quickly place it in the ice water bath to quench any drug release.\nMix 50 µL of sample of each time point with 150 µL of HBS in a black 96-well plate. Measure the DOX fluorescence intensity using a plate reader.\nAdd 20 µL of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 into random selected wells prepared in step 6.5. Measure the DOX fluorescence intensity of these wells using a plate reader. These values correspond to the fully released (t = ∞; 100% release) time point.\nCalculate and plot the percentage of DOX released by interpolating the fluorescence intensity of each time points (I(t)), compared to the initial (I(0)), and fully released (I(∞)), value.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60907/60907eq3.jpg\n7. Laser Heating and Triggered Release\nSet water bath temperature to 37 °C and allow the temperature to stabilize.",
    "Add 200 µL of DOX loaded LTSL10-ICG ([ICG] = 10 µg/mL) to a clear 96-well plate, then place it in the water bath, keep the bottom immersed in water.\nSet the current of the laser system to 2.27 A. Place the collimator of the laser system at 5 cm vertically above the surface of the 96-well plate, which corresponds to an energy flux of 0.5 W/cm2 [Figure 6].\n\tCAUTION: The laser system should be operated in compliance with relevant laser safety measures.\nSwitch on the laser and monitor the temperature every minute using a fiber optic temperature probe.\nAt 5 and 10 min, withdraw 10 µL of laser-irradiated liposomes from the clear 96-well plate at and mix with 190 µL of HBS for three wells in a black 96-well plate.\nMix 10 µL of the liposomes with 170 µL of HBS and 20 µL of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution for three wells in a black 96-well plate. These wells correspond to the \"100% released\" DOX content. Measure the DOX fluorescent intensity and calculate the DOX release as described in step 6.7.\nSubscription Required.
