    "This protocol allows users to image subcellular AMPK activity using targeted ExRai AMPKAR under widefield fluorescence microscopy. For imaging using confocal microscopy, please see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0003]. First, users prepare samples for imaging, which includes plating cells on imaging dishes and chemical transfection of cells with localized ExRai AMPKAR. Next, imaging of subcellular AMPK activity is accomplished using a widefield microscope to acquire images both before and after cells have been treated with 2-DG or an allosteric activator of AMPK (MK-8722) to induce AMPK activity. Finally, acquired images are analyzed to determine changes in excitation ratio after treatment with AMPK activators, the maximum ratio change for each location and stimulus, and the time to half maximum of reporter response. Successful completion of this protocol will result in measurement of subcellular AMPK activity induced by pharmacologic perturbation.\nThe Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0001] describes imaging ExRai AMPKAR localized to the cytoplasm, outer mitochondrial membrane, and lysosomal surface using cells grown in 35-mm imaging dishes, but this protocol can be adapted to image ExRai AMPKAR at locations and scales of interest.\nMaterials\nMEFs (e.g., ATCC, cat. no.

Seed a suspension of MEFs onto a 35-mm glass-bottom imaging dish, and culture cells in MEF culture medium (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0002] for details on passaging MEFs) to reach ∼70% confluency at the time of transfection. Incubate cells in a 37°C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hr before transfection.\nI suggest performing at least two technical replicates per experiment and three or more independent experimental replicates done on different days and with cells at different passage numbers. For this protocol, six imaging dishes should be seeded with MEFs. Two dishes of untargeted ExRai AMPKAR, two dishes of mito-ExRai AMPKAR, and two dishes of lyso-ExRai AMPKAR will be imaged.",
    "Day 2 (30 min)\n2. Check confluency of imaging dishes containing MEFs under a light microscope. If cells have achieved at least 70% confluency on the glass bottom, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, exchange medium for fresh MEF culture medium, and incubate an additional 24 hr.\nConfluency refers to the proportion of the area (in this case, glass bottom) covered by cells. In this protocol, ∼70% of the glass surface should be covered with MEFs.\n3. In a sterile biological safety cabinet, prepare transfection mix according to the recipe in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-tbl-0001]. Briefly, add 100 µl Opti-MEM to each tube, and then add 0.5 µg plasmid DNA for each respective localized biosensor. Vortex quickly to mix. Then, add 1.5 µl FuGENE HD to the plasmid dilution. Mix by gently pipetting up and down. Incubate transfection mix for 15 min at room temperature.\nEach imaging dish should have a unique transfection mix prepared in a separate microcentrifuge tube.\nBefore transfection, allow FuGENE HD to warm to room temperature, and then invert or quickly vortex to mix. Minimize the contact of undiluted FuGENE HD with plastic surfaces. Do not directly pipet FuGENE HD into empty plastic microcentrifuge tubes or allow FuGENE HD to drop onto walls of the tube; instead ensure FuGENE HD is pipetted directly into Opti-MEM.\nTable 1.\n                Transfection Conditions for MEFs\ntable:\n﻿Reagent,Dish 1,Dish 2,Dish 3,Dish 4,Dish 5,Dish 6\nBiosensor,ExRai AMPKAR,ExRai AMPKAR,Mito-ExRai AMPKAR,Mito-ExRai AMPKAR,Lyso-ExRai AMPKAR,Lyso-ExRai AMPKAR\n\"Opti-MEM, μl\",100,100,100,100,100,100\n\"DNA, μg\",0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5\n\"Plasmid, μl\",Variable,Variable,Variable,Variable,Variable,Variable\n\"FuGENE HD transfection reagent, μl\",1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5\n4. Place imaging dishes containing MEFs in biological safety cabinet. Add transfection mix dropwise to each dish, focusing on adding to cells adherent to the glass portion of the dish. Gently swirl to mix, and incubate overnight in a 37°C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator.",
    "FuGENE HD can be used in complete medium containing serum, so it is not necessary to replace medium for transfection.\nThe protocol presented here has been optimized for using MEFs and transfection with FuGENE HD. If using other transfection methods, optimization of plasmid DNA amount, transfection reagent amount, and transfection conditions should be done according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nImaging preparation\nDay 3 (30 min)\n5. At ∼24 hr post-transfection, check imaging dishes for cell health.\nFor imaging, confluence over 60% to 70% allows for many cells to be observed within a single field of view. If cells look sparse, or if transfection efficiency is low, imaging can be done 48 hr after transfection, which can increase biosensor expression. Some cell death and toxicity is expected after chemical transfection. Healthy cells will be adherent, flat, and fibroblast like, whereas dead cells or cells in the process of apoptosis will appear rounded up or will float in medium.\n6. In a biological safety cabinet, aspirate off culture medium from one 35-mm imaging dish, and wash cells with 2 ml of 1× HBSS imaging buffer prewarmed to 37°C, gently adding buffer to the side of the dish to avoid disturbing cells on the glass. Swirl gently, and aspirate off 1× HBSS. Repeat two times, and then add 2 ml of fresh 1× HBSS imaging buffer. Incubate cells at 37°C for 30 min.\nIn my experience, a 30-min incubation in 1× HBSS before imaging reduces background drifting signal from ExRai AMPKAR. Wash each dish 30 min before imaging. To prevent starvation, do not wash all dishes at once. It is best to do this step 30 min before beginning an imaging experiment.",
    "7. While cells are incubating with 1× HBSS, turn on microscope power source, light source, definite focus, filter changer, camera, incubator, microscope base, and computer. Allow incubator to warm to 37°C. Open image acquisition software.\nFor image acquisition and analysis, I use MatScope Suite, a MATLAB-based open-source imaging program using µ-Manager to control the microscope and acquire time-series data. Imaging data can be acquired and analyzed using other software, including but not limited to METAFLUOR, NIS Elements, and Zeiss Zen. For more information about MatScope, please see Internet Resources.\n8. Configure a time course protocol for imaging ExRai biosensors. Ensure filter configuration is suitable for imaging ExRai AMPKAR. Set objective to the correct magnification (≥40× preferred for imaging localized ExRai AMPKAR) and imaging interval to 30 s for 30 min. For example:\n         \n400 nm excitation-emission: ET405/40× excitation filter, T505dcxr dichroic, and ET535/50m emission filter; 100-msec exposure.\n480 nm excitation-emission: ET480/30× excitation filter, T505dcxr dichroic, and ET535/50m emission filter; 100-msec exposure.\nThe exposure and imaging interval should be modified for each imaging application and microscope setup. Exposure depends on camera sensitivity and light source. Too long of an exposure can increase cellular phototoxicity and photobleaching, whereas short exposure times result in noisy images with poor signal-to-noise ratios. Imaging intervals can be adjusted for imaging length (longer interval for longer imaging applications) or shortened to capture faster biological events. In my experience, 30- to 60-s intervals for 30 to 60 min is sufficient to capture changes in AMPK activity using ExRai AMPKAR.",
    "9. Wet objective lens using a drop of immersion oil, and mount imaging dish on the stage. Use modeling clay to hold the imaging dish in place. Using 400-nm excitation-emission settings, bring cells into focus, and identify a region of the dish with several transfected cells. Once cells have been identified, set definite focus.\nAn area containing three or more cells with good cell morphology and expression of ExRai AMPKAR is suitable for imaging.\nMEFs are fibroblasts, so selection of cells that are flat and elongated, not circular or rounded up, is preferable. When selecting target cells for imaging, ensure that fluorescence is above background. I have previously found that an initial starting brightness of 400 nm excitation-emission does not significantly correlate to biosensor response (Schmitt et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0020]). Therefore, cells of varying starting brightness may be used. In general, 400 nm excitation-emission will be brighter than 480 nm excitation-emission and is therefore preferred to use when selecting the field of view.\nWhen working with localized ExRai AMPKAR, it is critical to ensure the biosensor is properly localized. Subcellularly localized ExRai AMPKAR should have clearly defined compartmentation (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-fig-0001]). During cell selection, cells that have well-localized ExRai AMPKAR to either the mitochondrion or lysosome should be selected. To ensure correct localization, cells can be stained with organelle markers including MitoTracker Red or LysoTracker Red to verify biosensor localization (Schmitt et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0020]). This is a good control experiment to do when first imaging localized biosensors.\nData and image acquisition (30 min per dish)\n10. Acquire a set of images of the field of view selected for imaging, and select regions of interest (ROIs) to monitor during imaging. Select at least three cells as ROIs. Select a background ROI, choosing a region of the field of view with no cells.",
    "MatScope and many other imaging software allow for real-time measurement of intensity changes for each channel within predefined ROIs. For untargeted ExRai AMPKAR, the whole cell or a large portion of the cytoplasm can be used as an ROI. For mito-ExRai AMPKAR, a large portion of the mitochondrial network is typically selected. For lyso-ExRai AMPKAR, a portion of the cells with lysosomes is selected.\nAll cells selected should have fluorescence intensities above that of the selected background ROI and nontransfected or nonexpressing cells in the same field of view.\n11. Begin experiment. Collect a time series of the field of view for each channel.\n12. After acquiring ∼5 min of basal AMPK activity (≥10 image sets), pause acquisition to add stimulus to dish. Remove ∼500 µl imaging medium, and add to a microcentrifuge tube containing aliquoted stock solution of either 10 to 40 μl 2-DG (10 to 40 mM final ) or 10 μl MK-8722 (500 nM final). Gently pipet up and down to mix. Add dilution to the imaging dish dropwise around the edges of the dish. Once added, mix by gently pipetting four to five times, being careful to avoid directly pipetting on cells being imaged. Resume imaging for ∼25 min or until ExRai AMPKAR response reaches a maximum and does not increase further.\n13. Repeat steps 9 to 12 until all dishes have been imaged. Upon completion of data acquisition, export data for analysis.\nWhen imaging multiple dishes, after adding stimulus to the first dish, the second dish can be washed with 1× HBSS and incubated at this time.\nImage analysis (15 min per dish)\n14. Open image analysis software. Load collected images, and select ROIs.",
    "If image analysis software retains ROIs selected during imaging, those can be used here; however, changes in cell morphology may require redrawing of ROIs.\n15. Review all selected ROIs over time to ensure ROIs track the cell or organelle faithfully, accounting for any changes in cell location (due to cell moving or bumping of dish during drug addition) or cell morphology. For the background ROI, ensure region remains free of floating cells or other artifacts. Extract fluorescence intensities (arbitrary units [a.u.]) from each ROI over each frame along with time each image was acquired, and compile in a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel or similar).\nMost image analysis software will export these data into a spreadsheet or tab delimited format.\n16. In the spreadsheet, normalize time to the time of drug addition by setting the time associated with drug addition as 0 min. For each time point, calculate background-subtracted intensity (I) of each channel and the excitation ratio using Equations 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-disp-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-disp-0002].\n         \nformula:\n$$\\begin{equation} {{\\rm{I}}}_{480\\;{\\rm{nm}}} = 480\\;{\\rm{nm}}\\;{\\rm{a}}.{\\rm{u}}.\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{ROI}}-480\\;{\\rm{nm}}\\;{\\rm{a}}.{\\rm{u}}.\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{background}} \\end{equation}$$\nformula:\n$$\\begin{equation} {{\\rm{I}}}_{400\\;{\\rm{nm}}} = 400\\;{\\rm{nm}}\\;{\\rm{a}}.{\\rm{u}}.\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{ROI}}-400\\;{\\rm{nm}}\\;{\\rm{a}}.{\\rm{u}}.\\;{\\rm{of}}\\;{\\rm{background}} \\end{equation}$$\nNormalization of time to the time of drug addition should result in negative time before drug addition and positive time after. For example, –5 to 0 min is collected before drug addition, and 0 to 25 min is collected after drug addition (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-fig-0002]).\nAt this point, it is useful to analyze the individual channel responses to ensure I480 nm increases and I400 nm decreases when AMPK is activated.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5a2f652d-beba-43bc-886d-2bb3d4069cd7/cpz1771-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

    "Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0002] outlines the steps for successful culturing of MEFs and passaging for imaging experiments described in Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0001]. Adherent MEFs are collected from the previous culture dish using trypsin, diluted in culture medium, and a portion is placed in a new culture dish (cell passage). The remaining cells are used to seed glass-bottom imaging dishes for imaging ExRai AMPKAR. This protocol takes ∼30 min.\nMaterials\nMEFs (e.g., ATCC, cat. no. CRL-2991)\nMEF culture medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-rec-0002])\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nTrypLE Express Enzyme (e.g., Gibco, cat. no. 12605010)\n25-cm2 cell culture flasks (e.g., Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 101261C)\nHumidified incubator with 5% CO2 (e.g., Thermo Scientific Heracell VIOS 160i CO2 Incubator with Copper Chamber)\nTissue culture light microscope (e.g., Laxco LMI-3000 Series Routine Inverted Microscope)\n15-ml centrifuge tubes (e.g., USA Scientific, cat. no. 56188261)\nAerosol-tight centrifuge (e.g., Eppendorf Model 5810)\n35-mm glass-bottom dishes (e.g., CellVis, cat. no. D35-14-1.5N)\n1. Grow MEFs in at least a 25-cm2 cell culture flask in 5 ml MEF culture medium in a 37°C incubator with 95% humidity and 5% CO2. Passage cells once they are ∼90% confluent, as observed under a tissue culture light microscope. At this time, examine MEFs to ensure they exhibit characteristic fibroblast morphology (e.g., elongated shape).\nMEFs are a fibroblast cell line. Cells should be adherent in a monolayer. Cells should appear flat, elongated, and spindle shaped with an oval, disk-like nucleus.\n2. Before passage, maintain a sterile environment using 70% ethanol to sterilize medium aliquots, dishes, tubes, and serological pipets before placing in biological safety cabinet.\nAll materials going into a biological safety cabinet should be sprayed with 70% ethanol and allowed to be covered in 70% ethanol for at least 10 s before being wiped down. Maintaining a sterile biosafety cabinet is essential for prevention of bacterial contamination.",
    "3. Gently aspirate culture medium from MEFs, taking care to aspirate from the side of the flask. Add 1 ml TrypLE Express Enzyme, and gently rock dish to cover cells. Incubate at room temperature for 3 to 5 min.\nIncubation can occur at 37°C for maximum detachment but is usually not necessary for MEFs. When cells have successfully detached from the dish, the medium should appear hazy, and cells should appear spherical when viewed under a tissue culture light microscope.\n4. Add 2 ml prewarmed MEF culture medium to the dish, and suspend cells by gently pipetting up and down. Wash dish with the suspension to ensure all cells are collected, and transfer cell suspension to a 15-ml centrifuge tube. Centrifuge cell suspension 3 to 5 min at 500 × g, room temperature.\n5. While the cell suspension is in the centrifuge, prepare a fresh maintenance flask and glass-bottom imaging dishes. Label maintenance flask with initials, date, cell line, and passage number. Label imaging dishes with initials, date, cell line, and dish number. Add prewarmed MEF culture medium to each dish.\nFor flasks, add 4.5 ml medium, and for imaging dishes, add 1.9 ml medium. Imaging dishes can be coated with poly-lysine to encourage cell adhesion, but this is generally not needed for MEFs.\n6. Remove pelleted cells from centrifuge, and remove or aspirate supernatant. Resuspend cell pellet in 5 ml prewarmed MEF culture medium by gently by pipetting up and down. Aliquot cell suspension to the flask (500 µl) and imaging dishes (100 µl). Swirl and rock gently to evenly distribute cells. Return passaged cells to 37°C incubator with 95% humidity and 5% CO2 environment until ready for transfection or passage.",
    "When seeding cells on glass-bottom imaging dishes, add cells dropwise in a circle over the glass on the bottom of the dish. This ensures an even distribution of cells onto the glass and an adequate number of cells per field of view.\nCells will be confluent for subsequent passaging within 2 to 3 days and ready for transfection within 24 hr.",
    "Imaging of ExRai AMPKAR and other ExRai-based biosensors can be done using multiple modalities, including confocal microscopy (Mehta et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0016]; Zhang et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0027]). Confocal microscopy provides better spatial resolution over widefield microscopy through rejection of out-of-focus light and enables imaging of thick specimens (Elliott, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0007]). These properties could be advantageous when studying subcellular AMPK activity, making confocal microscopy a beneficial imaging modality. For confocal microscopy, sample preparation is the same, with changes only made to how data are collected. The confocal microscope is programmed with the correct optical setup, and then ROIs are acquired and time series collected similar to in the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0001]. Data analysis is done similar to in the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0001].\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0001])\nInverted confocal microscope with appropriate objective lens, laser lines, filter sets, camera, and image acquisition software:\n               \nNikon Ti2 spinning-disk confocal microscope equipped with PerfectFocus\nS Fluor 40×/1.3 N.A. oil objective\nPhotometrics Prime 95B sCMOS camera\n405- and 488-nm lasers, 525/50 nm emission filter, 488 dichroic\nStage-top incubator set at 37°C and 5% CO2 (e.g., Okolab)\nSample preparation\nDays 1 and 2\n1. Perform Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0001] steps 1 to 4 for seeding imaging dishes with MEFs and transfection.\nImaging preparation (30 min)\nDay 3\n2. Perform Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0001] steps 5 and 6 for preparing cells for imaging.\n3. While cells incubate in 1× HBSS, prepare microscope for imaging. Turn on microscope, and allow lasers to equilibrate and incubator to reach 37°C.\n4. Program a protocol for ExRai AMPKAR imaging. Ensure optical configuration is suitable for imaging ExRai AMPKAR. Set objective to the correct magnification (≥40× for imaging localized ExRai AMPKAR) and imaging interval to 30 s for 30 min. For example:\n         \n400 nm excitation-emission: 405 nm excitation laser, 488 dichroic, and 525/50 nm emission filter; 200-ms exposure.",
    "480 nm excitation-emission: 488 nm excitation laser, 488 dichroic, and 525/50 nm emission filter; 200-ms exposure.\nThe exposure and imaging interval should be modified for each imaging application and microscope setup. Exposure depends on laser power and camera sensitivity. Some ExRai-based KARs have been imaged using different power for the 488- and 405-nm lasers, with exposure times between 50 and 200 ms (Zhang et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0027]). For example, laser power across laser lines can be standardized to 1 µW, as others have reported for ratiometric imaging (Yaginuma & Okada, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0026]). This ensures the same amount of light is produced by both lasers. Images are set up to be acquired sequentially.\n5. Wet objective lens using a drop of immersion oil, and mount imaging dish on the stage. Use 405 nm excitation-emission settings to bring cells into focus and set PerfectFocus.\n6. Identify a region of the cell with at least three transfected cells with good cell morphology and correct localization of ExRai AMPKAR.\nMEFs should have typical fibroblast features, including elongated, spindle-like shape with a single, disk-shaped nucleus. Rounded cells or multinucleated cells should not be selected for imaging. When identifying cells to image, ensure cell fluorescence intensity is above background. The 400 nm excitation-emission will be brighter than 480 nm excitation-emission and should be used to identified a field of view. Previously, I found that initial starting brightness of 400 nm excitation-emission did not correlate significantly with biosensor response, so cells of varying brightness can be selected (Schmitt et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0020]).",
    "When selecting cells expressing subcellularly targeted ExRai AMPKAR, care should be taken to identify and select cells with proper subcellular distribution of ExRai AMPKAR (see Troubleshooting). Mito-ExRai AMPKAR should be clearly localized to the mitochondria, and lyso-ExRai AMPKAR should be well localized to lysosomes. For confirmation of proper localization, cells can be stained with organelle markers like MitoTracker Red or LysoTracker Red and colocalization of targeted ExRai AMPKAR with organelle markers assessed (Schmitt et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-bib-0020]).\nData and image acquisition (30 min per dish)\n7. Acquire an image of the selected field of view, and select ROIs to monitor during imaging.\nROIs should include localized ExRai AMPKAR and a background ROI with no transfected cells.\nFor untargeted ExRai AMPKAR, the whole cell or a large portion of the cytoplasm can be used as an ROI. For mito-ExRai AMPKAR, a portion of the mitochondrial network can be selected as an ROI, and for lyso-ExRai AMPKAR, a region of the cell with lysosomes can be selected. All selected ROIs should have fluorescence intensities above that of the background ROI and other nontransfected cells in the same field of view.\n8. Begin experiment. Collect a time series of the field of view for each channel for ∼5 min.\n9. Pause acquisition to add AMPK activators to the dish. Remove ∼500 µl imaging medium, and add to a microcentrifuge tube containing aliquoted stock solution of either 10 to 40 μl 2-DG (10 to 40 mM final) or 10μl MK-8722 (500 nM final). Gently pipet up and down to mix. Add dilution to the imaging dish dropwise around the edges of the dish. Once added, mix by gently pipetting four to five times, being careful to avoid directly pipetting on cells being imaged.",
    "10. Resume imaging for ∼25 min or until ExRai AMPKAR response reaches a maximum and does not continue to increase.\n11. Repeat steps 5 to 10 until all dishes have been imaged. Upon completion of data acquisition, export data for analysis.\nWhen imaging multiple dishes, after adding stimulus to the first dish, the second dish can be washed with 1× HBSS and incubated at this time.\nImage analysis (15 min per dish)\n12. Perform Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.771#cpz1771-prot-0001] steps 14 to 19.\nImaging AMPK activity with ExRai AMPKAR using confocal microscopy is very similar to imaging with widefield fluorescence microscopy but with enhanced resolution, which can be desirable for analysis of subcellular AMPK activities. Data collected here can be analyzed using the same workflow."
