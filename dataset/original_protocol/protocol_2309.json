These following steps provide the detailed information to prepare single-cell suspensions of hPSCs from colonies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1918-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The conversion strategies for derivation of hTSPS cells from primed hPSCs\nOverview of conversion strategies to generate and characterize hTSCs (hTSPS cells) from primed PSCs (hPSCs) in the absence (Standard strategy) (A) or presence of BMP4 (BMP4 strategy) (B).\nObserve the morphology of hPSCs and confirm hPSCs at 80%–90% confluency under the microscope.\nRemove the medium from culture plate (6 well).\nWash hPSCs with 1 mL DMEM/F12 basic medium per well.\nRemove DMEM/F12 basic medium from the well.\nAdd 600 μL Accutase per well to dissociate into individual cells for 8 min at 37°C and 5% CO2.\n8 min later, observe the hPSCs which are the single formation and floating.\nAdd 600 μL DMEM/F12 basic medium into the well and pipette the cell suspension gently.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge cells at 200 g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells with 1.5 mL mTeSR1 medium 10 μM Y27632.\nPipette the cells gently to ensure single-cell suspension.\nCount the cell number using the cell count chamber using trypan blue.\nSeed 4×105 cells per well of hPSCs in mTeSR1 medium plus 10 μM Y27632 on the matrigel-coated 6-well plates at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nDerivation of hTSCs by the standard strategy\nTiming: 10–12 days\nThese steps describe the derivation of hTSCs by the standard strategy. During the conversion process, the cells are cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "One day later (day 0), remove the mTeSR1 medium and wash hPSCs with 1 mL DMEM/F12 basic medium per well.\nAdd 2 mL hTSC medium per well and observe the morphology of hPSCs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1918-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. hTSPS cells are efficiently derived from primed hPSCs\n(A) Morphology of cells derived from H1 hESCs under TS medium by the standard strategy on the indicated days.

Scale bar, 200 μm.\n(D) Morphology of hTS cells (named hTSPS cells) derived from H1 hESCs.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium every 2 days.\nOn day 3, confluency of the transdifferentiated cells reaches about 90–100% (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nRemove the medium and add 1 mL per well 0.5 mM EDTA in the well for 8 min at 37°C.\n8 min later, observe the morphology of cells under the microscope, the cell-cell interactions should become loose.\nRemove EDTA and add 3 mL fresh TSC medium in the well.\nPipette the cells gently and passage the cells into the new matrigel-coated 6-well plate at 1:3 ratio.\nAdd 1 mL per well fresh hTSC medium to every well.\nNote: The incubation time with 0.5 mM EDTA is appropriate when cell-cell interactions become loose, but the cells become non-floating.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium every 2 days.\nOn day 5, repeat step 16 to passage the cells with 0.5 mM EDTA at 1:3 ratio (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: This step describes the passaging of the converted cells, similar to step 16.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium every 2 days for a week.",
    "On day 7–8, observe the morphology of the transdifferentiated cells and confirm appearance of hTSC-like colonies (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: The appearance time of hTSC-like colonies may vary depending on the cell lines, initial cell density, and passaging time point.\nOn day 10–12, the hTSC-like colonies should be observed and can be picked for purification and characterization (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nRemove the medium from the culture plates and add 1 mL per well DMEM/F12 basic medium to wash the cells.\nRemove DMEM/F12 basic medium and add 2 mL fresh hTSC medium.\nNote: Before picking colonies, the microscope, disposable glass pipets, and its surrounding environment are wiped with 75% alcohol, and an alcohol lamp should be lit next to the microscope to maintain sterilization. The glass pipets are burned into a vertical and sharp shape using the alcohol lamp (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). New 12-well plates are coated with matrigel for at least 1 h at 37°C.\nBurn the glass pipets using alcohol lamp and open the plate.\nObserve the hTSC-like colonies under the microscope and gently scrape these colonies from the well along these colonies using the glass pipets.\nShake the culture plate to collect these scraped colonies.\nTransfer the cell suspension to the new matrigel-coated 12-well plate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: The number of hTSC-like colonies may vary depending on the cell lines. According to the colony number, the cell suspension is transferred at 1:1–1:3 ratio.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium every day.\nScrape Some non-hTS cells by the glass pipets.\nNote: There may be some non-hTS cells in these hTSC colonies in the 12-well plate.\nPassage the purified hTSC-like cells at 80%–90% confluency with 600 μL TrypLE Express dissociation solution per well for 8–10 min at 37°C.",
    "Note: Many steps of the cell dissociation using TrypLE Express are similar to accutase. Please see the above description.\n10 min later, collect the cell suspension into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuge cells at 200 g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells with 1 mL hTSC medium.\nPipette the cells gently and passage the cells in the new matrigel-coated 6-well plate at 1:1 ratio.\nAdd the fresh hTSC medium to a total of 2 mL per well in 6-well plate and culture the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium every day.\nPassage routinely the purified human TSC-like cells using TrypLE Express every three days at 1:3 ratio.\nNote: If these cells grow slowly at the beginning, the culture days can be extended appropriately. The purified human TSC-like cells are named human TSPS cells in the later description.\nDerivation of hTSCs by the BMP4 strategy\nTiming: 10–12 days\nThese steps describe the derivation of hTSCs in the presence of BMP4. BMP4 promotes induction efficiency of hTSCs from hPSCs. Thus, some steps for derivation of hTSCs using the BMP4 strategy are different from the steps using the standard strategy. The detailed information for the BMP4 strategy is provided in the following steps. During the conversion process, the cells are cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nOne day later (day 0), aspirate the mTeSR1 medium and wash hPSCs with DMEM/F12 basic medium.\nAdd 2 mL hTSC medium plus 10 ng/mL BMP4 per well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nChange the fresh hTSC medium plus 10 ng/mL BMP4 every 2 days.\nOn day 3, observe the morphology of the transdifferentiated cells and confirm appearance of hTSC-like colonies (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: The appearance time of hTSC-like cells using the BMP4 strategy is earlier than that of standard strategy.",
    "Passage the cells at 90–100% confluency using 0.5 mM EDTA for 8 min at 37°C.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium plus 10 ng/mL BMP4 every 2 days.\nOn day 5, repeat step 26 to passage the cells with 0.5 mM EDTA at 1:3 ratio.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium every 2 days for a week.\nOn day 10–12, passage the hTSC-like cells using TrypLE Express for 8 min at 1:3 ratio (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: On day 10, almost all transdifferentiated cells will exhibit hTSC-like morphology. Therefore, these cells do not need to be picked manually and can be directly passaged using TrypLE Express.\nAdd the fresh hTSC medium to a total of 2 mL per well in 6-well plate and culture the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium every day.\nRoutinely passage routinely the human TSC-like cells (BMP4 strategy) using TrypLE Express every three days at 1:3 ratio.\nNote: If these cells grow slowly at the beginning, the culture days can be extended appropriately. These purified human TSC-like cells are named human TSPSB cells using the BMP4 strategy.\nPassaging and cryopreservation of hTSPS cells\nTiming: 30 min\nhTSC-like cells can be derived from primed hPSCs by the standard and BMP4 strategies. These hTSPS and hTSPSB cells need to be expanded, stored, and characterized as bona fide hTSCs. These steps describe the passaging and cryopreservation of hTSPS and hTSPSB cells.\nFor passaging of hTSPS and hTSPSB cells, confluency of hTSPS and hTSPSB cells should reach 80%–90%.\nRemove the medium from the well of hTSPS and hTSPSB cells.\nWash hPSCs with 1 mL DMEM/F12 basic medium per well and remove DMEM/F12 from the well.\nAdd 600 μL TrypLE Express per well for 8 min at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "8 min later, shake the plate and add 600 μL DMEM/F12 basic medium into the well.\nPipette the cell suspension gently and transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 1.5 mL hTSC medium and resuspend cells gently.\nSeed the cells at 1:3 ratio in a total of 2 mL hTSC medium per well on the matrigel-coated 6-well plate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nChange the fresh hTSC medium every day.\nPassage the hTSPS and hTSPSB cells using TrypLE Express every three days at 1:3 ratio.\nFor cryopreservation of hTSPS and hTSPSB cells, confluency of the cells should reach 80%–90%.\nRepeat step 34a-f and add 1 mL Cell Banker 2 to resuspend cells.\nTransfer the cell suspension to Cryotube vial.\nStore the vial at −80°C and subsequently liquid nitrogen.\nCharacterization of hTSPS cells\nTiming: 10 min (morphology), 48 h (marker expression)\nBona fide hTSCs maintain hTSC morphology, express hTSC markers (GATA3/KRT7/TEAD4/TP63) (Lee et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), and differentiate into extravillous cytotrophoblast cells (EVT) and syncytiotrophoblast cells (STB) (Okae et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Therefore, the hTSPS and hTSPSB cells should exhibit these characteristics. The following steps describe the characterization of hTSPS and hTSPSB cells.\nThe morphology of hTSPS and hTSPSB cells is captured by the microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nThe expression of hTSC markers GATA3/KRT7/TEAD4/TP63 and hESC marker OCT4 is validated using immunostaining (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for the antibody information.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1918-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
