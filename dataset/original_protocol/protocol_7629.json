    "Prepare flies for behavioral recording Raise flies at 12:12 h light/dark cycle, 60% humidity and 25 °C.Hatched flies are disposed of in case their age is not controlled (including those that transiently stick to the food or walls).Collect all newly hatched flies into a new experimental vial (no more than 20 flies per vial). Flies should be 0–1 day old.Collect 5-day-old flies (at least 60 flies: 30 for control group and 30 for trained group) by tapping and transferring them to a new vial with fresh food.Anesthetize the flies by holding the vial upside down and inserting the CO2 pistol. Fill in the CO2 for a few seconds until flies are asleep (flies do not move anymore and fall into the vial cap).Transfer the flies to a CO2-dispensing porous pad.Clip both wings using scissors under the microscope. The wings need to be shortened to at least 1/3 of the original length and must be straight to the crossing line of both wings. The flies must not be anesthetized for more than 5 min; therefore, it is useful to portion the flies.Save each fly in individual vials with food (1 cm full) at 25 °C. Split and store them in two different racks—one for the control group (CT) and one for the trained group (TR).Seven-day-old flies are used for the experiment. Twenty-one hours before running the experiment, place each fly in a starving vial containing a piece of filter paper watered with Evian water. Store them at 25 °C until running the experiment.Prepare behavioral arena for learning experiment Two setups will be prepared in parallel to run the control (CT) and trained (TR) group at the same time. It is important to switch the setups, so that the two groups are run in both assays.",
    "For half of the animals in the experiment, the acrylic cylinder must be rotated 180° to exclude any uncontrolled and systematic influence of other stimuli of the surroundings.Place the visual diffuser paper on the inside of the acrylic cylinder.Tape the black squares with scotch tape: on one side of the cylinder, place the three squares at 40 mm from the bottom with a distance between them of 22 mm. Tape the remaining two squares in the opposite side of the cylinder (180° apart) using the same distances. It is important that the sets are well aligned. The center of the sets must be 180° apart (Figure 1).Open the Buritrack software and place the visual sets in the top and bottom part of the image captured by the webcam (Figure 1B). The contrast and luminosity of your camera may need to be adjusted, such that the arena is visible.Add distilled water to the Buridan chamber.Darken the room: close blinds and curtains and switch off the room lights.Switch on the Buridan fluorescent lights.Clean the platform with ethanol 70%.Place the round filter paper on the platform.In the Buridan planned to run the trained group, add two drops (~100 μL) of glucose solution next to the visual stimulus to be conditioned (e.g., 2 squares set) and two drops (~100 μL) of Evian water to the other visual stimulus (e.g., 3 squares set). For the control group, in the other Buridan, place two drops of water next to each stimulus (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4875/bioprotoc-13-21-4875-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Picture of the fly performing during the testing session. D, E. Image of the Buritrack software to set the parameters of the experiment.Run the training session Set the temperature of the platform to 25 °C.Press the Button New Tracking and adjust all the parameters in the Tracking dialog (Figure 1D). Generate a folder named “Training” to save your recording. Open Buritrack and set the parameters of the recording. Browse the Training folder, select the name of the file (e.g., TR_f01 for the case of TR group female #1; CT_m01 for the case of CT group male #1) and the fly group (e.g., TR_f, for female TR flies; CT_m for CT male flies), and the recording time (in seconds).Set the size of the arena. While setting the platform position, left-click on three points on the platform edge. Check that the drawn circle fits with the platform; if not, you can right-click to erase one point (one per click) (yellow line in Figure 1D).Gently place the fly on the platform. You may want to adjust the luminosity of your camera again.Activate tracking in Buritrack to record the walking behavior (Figure 1D).If the fly jumps off of the platform, the tracker stops and plays a sound alarming the experimenter. Put the fly back on the platform using a brush and click Activate Tracking again to continue with the experiment.After 3 min the session is over. Gently remove the fly from the platform and place it back in their starving vial.Clean the platform with 70% ethanol, prepare a new filter paper with sucrose and water for the next fly, and set the new file name in Buritrack. Once it is done, place the following fly and start a new recording by clicking the New Tracking button.",
    "Continue running each fly individually by cleaning the platform with 70% ethanol between flies and using a new clean filter paper each time. Half of the animals will be trained and tested with one stimulus orientation (e.g., three squares on the top part of the image in the Buritrack software), and the other half will be trained and tested with the opposite orientation of the visual sets (e.g., three squares on the bottom part of the image).Run the testing session Right after finishing the training session, clean the platform with abundant water and 70% ethanol to remove any trace of glucose.Two hours after finishing the training session, place a clean filter paper on the platform.Place the fly to record the testing session.Generate a folder named “Testing” to save your recording. Open Buritrak and set the parameters of the recording. Browse the Testing folder and select the name of the file, fly group, and the recording time (300 s). It is important to use the same names as in the training session (e.g., TR_f01, CT_m01) to then analyze the behavior of the very same fly during the training and testing sessions.Set the size of the arena.Activate tracking in Buritrack to record walking behavior.After running the recording, remove the filter paper, clean the platform with 70% ethanol, and place a new round filter paper for testing the next fly."
