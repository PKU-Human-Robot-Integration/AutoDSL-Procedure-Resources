Turn on the heat by plugging into the outlet. Ensure it is working. Cover the heat pad with another sterile field piece and fix it using tape.\nOpen autoclaved toolbox and lay out the tools onto sterile surgery field.\nCritical: avoid touching them with contaminated gloves.\nOpen suture and lay out it onto sterile surgery field.\nPrepare tubes with iodine and 70% ethanol.\nPlace other required materials in the biological safety cabinet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1043-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Surgical area\n(A–L) (A) Sterile 1 mL syringe, (B) Tape, (C) Razor, (D) 70% ethanol, (E) Iodine, (F) Sterile gauze, (G) Forceps, (H) Scissors, (I) Sterile Cotton swabs, (J) 29-gauge insulin syringe, (K) Needle holders, (L) Suture (pre- autoclaved container)\nMouse setup\nTiming: 10 min\nPrepare a spare cage for holding mice after surgery.\nSetup a heat pad for warming up the mouse cage. Half of the post-surgery cage should be placed on the heat pad, so mouse can warm up. Make sure heat pad is functional.\nWeigh the mouse.\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mL/10 g body weight tribromoethanol solution. Monitor respiratory and heart rate of the mouse. Assess level of anesthesia by pedal reflex (firm toe pinch). The mouse should fall asleep within 5 min.\nTransfer the mouse to the sterile platform above the heat pad. Fix the mouse in position by taping down the limbs.\nApply the ophthalmic ointment to prevent retina damage.\nMouse surgery\nTiming: 10 min\nShave the mouse hair around the surgery site.",
    "Clean and sterilize the surgery area using sterile cotton swabs with iodine and 70% ethanol, consecutively. It should be done in a spiral motion, from the middle to the outside and the process should be repeated 3 times.\nPlace sterile gauze around surgery site to prevent contamination (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1043-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mice with sterile gauze, scale bar, 1.5 cm\nSubcutaneously inject the mouse with 100 μL 0.125% bupivacaine for analgesia.\nUsing forceps and surgical scissors, open the outer skin layer. Make a smaller incision into the inner muscle layer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1043-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Open the abdomen, scale bar, 1.6 cm\nCritical: avoid hurting blood vessels or organs.\nIdentify and expose the cecum using forceps and cotton swabs. Do not use forceps to drag tissue.\nNote: Cecum is usually located at the right side of stomach (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1043-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cecum location, scale bar, 1.5 cm\nNote: If the cecum is dry, use 1 mL syringe with sterile saline to sustain tissue hydration.\nWithdraw 50 μL of the cell suspension with a 29-gauge insulin syringe.\nNote: Keep the cell suspension on ice and mix upside down before injection.\nFix the injection site by using cotton swabs.\nNote: Do not injure vessels in submucosa of cecum or mesentery. Injection site should be between the blood vessels (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1043-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cecum injection, scale bar, 1 cm\nGently insert the 29-gauge needle of the insulin syringe, approximately 1 mm, into the sub serosal layer.\nNote: Face a needle tip upward and insert as shallow as possible.\nSlowly inject 50 μL of the cell suspension into the semitransparent sub serosal layer. Sub serosal swelling will be observed if injection is performed successfully.\nNote: This procedure requires surgical skill and practice to obtain reproducible results.",
    "Check the injection site for leakage and bleeding (Kasashima et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nUse sterile suture and needle holder to close the inner muscle layer and the skin layer using discontinuous knots.\nUse Loctite 406 glue to close the skin over the suture, to prevent it breaking apart.\nInject mouse with 50 μL/20 g mouse dexamethasone (at 0.1 mg/mL) to avoid surgery-caused inflammation.\nPut the mouse on heat pad.\nRecord mouse data in record sheet found in surgery logbooks.\nAfter surgery\nTiming: 4–6 weeks\nIf more mice are being used, replace the sterile surgical tools onto sterile pad.\nWait until mice recover from anesthesia. Put mice back and make sure that the mice have a water bottle and wet food.\nInject mice with 50 μL dexamethasone every day for the next 3 days to avoid surgery-caused inflammation.\nWeigh the mice and assess their health until the experiment is finished."
