    "Equipment setup Set the ultrasonic bath temperature to 50 °C prior to the start of the experiment.Set the rotatory evaporator water bath temperature to 50 °C prior to the start of the experiment.Clean all glassware with 70% EtOH followed by 100% EtOH.Sanitize the vacuum hood with UV light for 1 h.Preparation of lipid solutions Add 2.5 mL of 100% EtOH to 5.0 mg of MGDG to make a 2.0 mg/mL MGDG solution.Add 2.5 mL of 100% EtOH to 5.0 mg of DGDG to make a 2.0 mg/mL DGDG solution.Add 5.0 mL of 100% dichloromethane (DCM) to 25.0 mg of PA to make a 5.0 mg/mL PA solution.Keep the above solutions stored at -20 °C until use.Synthesis of IL-22/nLNPs Mix 99 μL of MGDG, 66 μL of DGDG, and 66 μL of PA solutions in a 50 mL single-neck recovery flask.Add 2.5 mL of 100 % EtOH to the lipid mixture.Swirl the flask to mix the lipids and the EtOH mixture.Attach the flask to the rotary evaporator and rotate for 3–5 min at a 50 torr pressure (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4647/bioprotoc-13-07-4647-g001.jpgFigure 1. Solvent evaporation by rotary evaporator Release the vacuum when it reaches 50 torr pressure and transfer the flask to a UV-sanitized vacuum hood.In a centrifuge tube, prepare a 5% glucose solution by mixing 1 mL of 20% glucose solution with 3 mL of RNase-free DEPC water.Add 50 μL of in vitro transcription synthesized IL-22 mRNA (generated by using mRNA synthesis kit with custom designed IL-22 pMRNAXP vector as a template, following manufacturer’s instruction) and 50 μL TurboFectTM transfection reagent to the 500 μL of 5% glucose solution and mix. The total volume will be 600 μL.Incubate the mixture for 15 min at room temperature.Transfer the solution to the single-neck recovery flask containing the lipid mixture.",
    "Place the bottom of the recovery flask in the water contained in the ultrasonic bath and pipette up and down (approximately 100 times) until the mixture becomes cloudy (Figure 2).Store the prepared nLNPs at 4 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4647/bioprotoc-13-07-4647-g002.jpgFigure 2. Sonication of IL-22 mRNA and lipid mixture Characterization of the nLNPs Measure particle size Place approximately 1.5 mL of nLNPs suspension in a cuvette and cover it with a plastic cap.Place the cuvette in the cuvette holder of Malvern Zetasizer.Set the software function to measure the size.Measure zeta potential Place approximately 1.0 mL of the nLNPs suspension in a capillary cell.Place the cell in the cuvette holder of the Malvern Zetasizer.Set the software function to measure the zeta potential."
