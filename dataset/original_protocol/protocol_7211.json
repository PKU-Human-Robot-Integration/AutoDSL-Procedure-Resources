    "Immobilization of anti-DYKDDDDK antibody on NHS beadsTransfer 5.0 mg of NHS beads into a 1.5-mL tube.Centrifuge the beads at 15,000 × g and 4°C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the beads in 250 μL of methanol, and disperse them by sonication (less than 1 min).Centrifuge the beads at 15,000 × g and 4°C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the beads in 160 μL of 25 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), and disperse them by sonication.Add 160 μL of anti-DYKDDDDK antibodies in 25 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.0).Note: Resuspend 0.5 mg of anti-DYKDDDDK antibodies in 160 μL of 25 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.0). Incubate the beads with gentle vortexing, using a microtube mixer at 4°C for 30 min.Note: Set the dial of the microtube mixer to 6.5. Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant.Note: Spin the tube down before collecting the beads, to collect liquid at the lip of tube. Resuspend the beads in 625 μL of 1 M ethanolamine, and disperse the beads by pipetting.Incubate the beads using the microtube mixer at 4°C overnight.Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the beads in 1 mL of protein conjugation buffer, and disperse the beads by pipetting.Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant.Repeat steps A12 and A13 three times.Resuspend the beads in 1 mL of 0.1 M Glycine-HCl (pH 2.5).Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the beads 1 mL of 1.0 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the beads in 1 mL of protein conjugation buffer (+0.5% Triton X-100).Incubate the beads with gentle rotation using a tube shaker/rotator at 4°C for 15 min.Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the beads in 1 mL of protein conjugation buffer.Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant.Repeat steps A22 and A23 three times.Resuspend the beads in 1 mL of protein storage buffer, and store at 4°C.Note: A volume of 1 mL of beads can be used for 100 experiments. You can store the beads at 4°C for at least one year. Immunoisolation of recycling vesiclesStreak Vps55-3xFLAG or Vps10-3xFLAG expressing sec18ts yeast strains to the YEPD plate from glycerol stocks (yeasts in 15% glycerol and YEPD, store at -80°C).Note: To purify retromer-recycling vesicles, Vps10-3xFLAG sec18ts cells are used. For Mvp1-recycling vesicles, Vps55-3xFLAG sec18ts cells are used. Incubate the plate in a VWR digital incubator at 26°C for three days.Inoculate the yeast cells in 5 mL of YEPD liquid medium and cultivate them in incubator shakers at 250 rpm and 26°C overnight.Inoculate 0.5–2.5 μL of the preculture to 5 mL of YEPD liquid culture. Inoculate this to 100 mL of YEPD liquid media in a 250-mL flask and grow the cells in incubator shakers at 250 rpm and 26°C overnight.When the cells reach mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.4–0.8), incubate them at in incubator shakers at 250 rpm and 37°C for 60 min.Note: Measure OD600 of the undiluted yeast culture by pipetting 100 μL of the yeast culture into 900 μL of water. Cool the cells on ice for 5 min.Harvest 80 OD600 unit yeast cells into a 50-mL tube, and centrifuge it using the centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Allegra X-15R) at 4,000 × g and 4°C for 2 min.Remove the supernatant by pipetting, and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of cooled H25S75E5 buffer.Centrifuge the cells at 4,000 × g and 4°C for 2 min, and remove the supernatant by pipetting.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of cooled H25S75E5 buffer into a 1.5-mL micro-tube.Centrifuge the cells at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of cooled H25S75E5 buffer (+PIC), and add 500 μL of 0.5 mm Zirconia/Silica beads.Note: Buffer should not contain detergent, but does contain 750 mM sorbitol to maintain osmolarity. Vortex the cells to lyse them at 4°C for 1 min.Centrifuge the lysate in a 1.5-mL micro-tube at 500 × g and 4°C for 5 min, and remove the supernatant.Centrifuge the supernatant at 15,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min, and remove the supernatant.Incubate the cleared supernatant with 10 μL of pre-equilibrated anti-DYKDDDDK NHS beads (prepared in “A”) with gentle rotation using tube shaker/rotators at 4°C for 60 min.Note: Before use, suspend anti-DYKDDDDK NHS beads in cooled H25S75E5 buffer. Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant by pipetting.Resuspend the beads in 1 mL of cooled H25S75E5 buffer.Repeat steps B18 and B19 three times.Transfer the beads to a new 1.5-mL tube.Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant by pipetting.Add 100 μL of SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Incubate the beads at 98°C for 5 min.Collect the beads using a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant.Analyze the sample by SDS-PAGE and western blotting.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4403/bioprotoc-12-09-4403-g002.jpgFigure 2. Immunoisolation of endosomal recycling vesicles. A. Schematic for immunoisolation of endosomal recycling vesicles. To accumulate cargo-containing recycling vesicles, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Sec18, which is essential for the fusion of recycling vesicles with the Golgi apparatus, was used. After 60 min of incubation at the non-permissive temperature (37°C), cells expressing FLAG-fused cargo proteins (Vps10 or Vps55) were lysed. Then, cargo-containing recycling vesicles were immunoisolated by anti-FLAG magnetic beads. B. Western blotting analysis of the isolated Vps55-FLAG-containing vesicles. C.",
