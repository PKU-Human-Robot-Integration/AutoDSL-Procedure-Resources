    "C. elegans maintenance Inoculate an E. coli OP50 colony into 50 mL of LB broth in a 200 mL flask, and incubate with gentle agitation at 37°C overnight (1 × 108 UFC/mL; OD: 1–1.2).Apply approximately 200 μL of OP50 liquid culture to a 60 mm NGM plate. Incubate seeded plates at 37°C overnight before use.Worms can be chunked (transfer agar pieces carrying worms from an old plate to a new one every 3–4 days).Keep worms at 20°C.C. elegans synchronization by bleaching Allow previously synchronized worms to grow until L4 larval stage (approximately 48 h, see Figure 1), and then adult stage (~8 more hours).Recover gravid adults in 15-mL tubes by washing plates with M9 buffer (see Recipe 1).Pellet worms by centrifuging at 400 × g (~1,500 rpm on a standard table centrifuge) and room temperature for 2 min, and discard supernatant.Perform 1–3 washes until the buffer appears clear of bacteria.Add 5 mL of bleaching solution (see Recipe 8) into the tube, and shake vigorously at room temperature for up to 5 min. Bleaching longer than 5 min will kill the eggs. We followed destruction of worm bodies under the dissecting microscope, and the reaction is stopped when traces of adults are still visible, which typically takes between 3 and 5 min.Stop reaction by adding M9 buffer until the 15-mL mark of the conical tube.Quickly centrifuge (since treatment may still be active) at 400 × g for 1 min, and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellet three more times, by filling the tube with M9 buffer.Add 1 mL of M9 buffer to the pellet, or place the eggs to unseeded NGM plates, and incubate at the desired temperature with gentle agitation. Proper aeration should be provided to obtain all animals in stage L1.",
    "We check all worms are in larval stage 1 before proceeding further.Transfer the L1 population to NGM agar plates previously seeded with the corresponding bacterial food, and incubate until they reach the young adult stage, approximately 48 h later (see Figure 1). Most of the C. elegans strains are maintained at 20°C on NGM media seeded with E. coli OP50 or B. subtilis NCIB3610.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4473/bioprotoc-12-14-4473-g001.jpgFigure 1. C. elegans life cycle from egg-laying to adult worms. A. C. elegans viewed through the dissecting microscope. B. Life Cycle of C. elegans. Animals increase in size throughout the four larval stages. Photographs were taken on Petri dishes (note the bacterial lawns in all but the dauer images). Scale bar: 0.1 mm.DiI staining of worms Adult worms (approximately 100 worms per condition) fed with E. coli OP50- and B. subtilis NCIB3610- strain fed adult worms are collected, washed, and resuspend in 1 mL of M9 buffer, and then mixed with 5 µL of a 1:200 dilution of DiI solution (prepared from stock solution, see Recipe 10).Incubate on a shaker (20 × g, ~75 rpm) at room temperature for 2–3 h.Wash worms with M9 (1–3 washes) and transfer the labeled worms onto agar pads.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4473/bioprotoc-12-14-4473-g002.jpgFigure 2. DiI-stained C. elegans neurons. Neuronal morphological changes of aging worms colonized by OP50 or NCIB3610 bacteria. Aging wild-type worms, colonized by OP50 or NCIB3610 bacterial cells (right and bottom rectangles for A and C; and B, respectively) at different ages, were labeled with fluorescent DiI to highlight amphid neuron morphology: A, normal morphology or no neuronal loss; B, partial neuronal alterations or partial neuronal loss; and C, total neuronal deterioration or total neuronal loss. The top and bottom micrographs (phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy, respectively) in A–C are representative of 10 independent worm images analyzed for each age.",
    "Arrows in A indicate the location of the chemosensory worm neurons (i.e., ASK, ADL, ASI, ASH, ASJ, and AWB), and arrows in B indicate some of the age-associated neuronal alterations. D. Semi-quantification of age-related neurodegeneration. Ten N2 worms colonized with OP50 or NCIB3610 bacteria, cultured on NGM plates at 20°C, were taken at the indicated times, processed, and labeled with DiI to determine the degree of age-related neuronal deterioration (not loss, partial loss, or loss). Results are expressed as a percentage of the initial population of worms (n = 100) ± S.E.M. Images from Cogliati et al. (2020) with permission.Obtain the images of the worms Mount the labeled worms onto a 2% agar pad on a glass slide using 0.1 M sodium azide (the azide acts as an anesthetic for the worms) and enclose with a coverslip.Use the 40× objective to visualize the labeled worms.Neuron degeneration can be examined over time with an Olympus FV1000 laser confocal scanning microscope using the Zen program, and a semi-quantitative analysis can be performed."
