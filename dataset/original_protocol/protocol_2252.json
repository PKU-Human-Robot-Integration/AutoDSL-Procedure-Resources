    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCulture of Microglia\nTiming: for steps 1–14, 60–90 min; for steps 15–17, 14 days\nThis protocol can be adapted for use in culturing microglia (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Time course for the collection of microglia depends on the number of cells and the number of experimental groups. Scarify mice after intraperitoneal administration (10 mL / kg body weight) of anesthesia with a mixture of butorphanol (Vetorphale®, 0.5 mg/mL), midazolam, (Dormicum®, 0.4 mg/mL), and medetomidine (Domitor®, 0.03 mg/mL) dissolved in sterilized water. Chop the brain region of interest immediately following euthanasia. The brain and/or chunks should be kept on ice throughout the process. Older pups (~postnatal day 7), as well as newborn pups, could be used to prepare microglia. However, newborn pups (~postnatal day 3) could provide a better yield in the number of microglia (Bordt et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Lian et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Here, we use postnatal day 3 pups.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/186-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow of Co-culture with Microglia and Axons\nAliquot 9 mL of PBS into 50 mL tubes and cool on ice. Keep all dissecting tools cool on ice.\nDissect the brain region of interest and chop up with cold fine scissors or blades until no tissue lumps remain. Collect into the prepared 9 mL of ice cold PBS. (Schildge et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: If you are dissecting more than five brains use separate tubes\nAdd 1 mL of 2.5% trypsin/PBS (final concentration 0.25%) and 50 μL of 50 mg/mL DNase into each tube.\nIncubate for 15 min in a water bath at 37°C.\nCritical: Agitate tubes every 5 min to mix tissue.\nAdd 10 mL of DMEM/10% FBS solution into each tube (equal volume of enzyme mix).\nMix by pipette (approximately 20 times) using a 10 mL disposable pipette.",
    "Critical: Proper pipetting is important for cell viability. To avoid air bubbles, pipet up and down while leaving 0.5–1 mL of cell suspension in the disposable pipette each time. See Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCentrifuge at 180 × g (RCF) for 5 min at 4°C with max acceleration and brake.\nDiscard the supernatant. Add 10 mL of DMEM /10% FBS solution and resuspend cell suspension by gently pipetting.\nPlace a 70 μm filter mesh on top of a new 50 mL tube and filter samples by gravity flow.\nCentrifuge the flow-through at 180 × g for 5 min at 4°C with max acceleration and brake.\nIf the supernatant is cloudy, repeat resuspension and centrifugation (Salazar et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) .\nDiscard the supernatant. Add 10 mL of DMEM/10% FBS solution and resuspend cell suspension by gently pipetting.\nCount the number of cells and seed them at 5 × 105 cells / mL placing up to 4 mL in a 6-cm dish (2 × 106 cells per plate).\nIncubate the cells in 5% CO2 at 37°C\nReplace the medium on days 1, 2, 4, and 6 with 4 mL of fresh DMEM/10% FBS solution to remove debris and floating cells.\nOn days 9 and 12, add 0.5–1 mL of fresh DMEM/10% FBS solution.\nFor issues with microglial viability, please see Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nOn day 14, collect microglia from supernatant and co-culture with the axons. Proceed to step 34 for detailed steps of microglia collection.\nAxon Isolation Culture\nTiming For Steps 18–33: 60–70 min\nUsing axon isolation culture devices, axons were separately cultured from the cell bodies of the cortical neurons. Here, we used embryonic mice (E17) to prepare cortical neurons. Neonatal mice (~P3) can be used for the culture of cortical neurons. However, older mice tend to provide lower number of cells.",
    "Prepare the axon culture device (AXISTM Axon Isolation Device, Merck; Neuron Device, Xona Microfluidics) following manufacturer’s protocol. Please refer to “Preparation of axon culture device” section for additional details (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/186-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Schematic Images of Axon Isolation Culture\nNeurites grow from the somal side (pale blue) toward the axonal side (yellow) and go through the microgroove.\nCritical: Do NOT use expired devices.\nAdd 9 mL of PBS into 50 mL tubes and cool on ice. Keep all dissecting tools cool on ice.\nDissect the cortex and chop up with cold fine scissor or blades until no tissue lumps remain. Collect into the prepared 9 mL of ice cold PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of 2.5% trypsin (final concentration 0.25%) and 100 μL of 50 mg/mL DNase into each tube .\nIncubate in a water bath at 37°C for 15 min.\nCritical: Agitate tubes every 5 min to mix tissue.\nAdd 10 mL of DMEM/10% FBS solution into each tube (equal volume of enzyme mix).\nCentrifuge at 180 × g for 4 min at 4°C with max acceleration and brake.\nDiscard the supernatant, then add 10 mL of DMEM/10% FBS solution.\nMix by pipette (approximately 10 times) using a 10 mL disposable pipette tip.\nCritical: Proper pipetting is important for cell viability. To avoid air bubbles, pipet up and down while leaving 0.5–1 mL of cell suspension in the pipette each time.\nPlace a 70 μm filter mesh on top of a fresh 50 mL tube and filter the cell suspension by gravity flow.\nCentrifuge the flow-through at 180 × g for 4 min at 4°C, with max acceleration and brake.\nIf the supernatant is cloudy, repeat resuspension and centrifugation.",
    "Discard the supernatant. Add 10 mL of neuron culture medium, and resuspend the cell pellet by gently pipetting.\nCount the number of the cells, and seed 5 μL of cell suspension (5 × 106 cells per mL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nIncubate the cells in 5% CO2 at 37°C\nIn approximately one week, neurites grow from the somal side toward the axonal side through the microgrooves (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nFor issues with neuronal viability, please see Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCo-culture of Microglia with Axons\nTiming For Steps 34–41: 60–90 min\nMicroglia are collected from the supernatant and added to the cultured axons.\nOn day 14 of microglia culture, collect microglia from supernatant and co-culture with the axons. To collect microglia, collect all the conditioned culture media from microglia culture dishes into fresh 50 mL tubes.\nAdd 0.5 mL of fresh microglia culture media to the culture dishes.\nTap the dishes and gently apply the 0.5 mL media to wash the cell layer and collect any remaining microglia. Collect the supernatant including floating cells, and add to the same 50 mL tubes containing media collected at step 34.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C with max acceleration and brake.\nThe remaining cells in the pellet are microglia. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1–5 mL of neuron culture medium. Reconstituting at a high density of cells could be better since it allows you to dilute cells at an identical density after the cell counts.\nCarefully remove the silicon-based axon culture device from the dish (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: Using an inverted microscope (CKX41, Olympus, or other), verify that axons kept along the microgroove line (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
