    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hebei General Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nHave the patient simulate the operation position. Have the patient lay in the prone position on the sickbed 3-5 days before the operation. Cushion the thorax and ilium with soft pillows.\nPlan the operation on the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Measure the thickness of the lamina and OLF on the computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, so that the depth of the bone window is roughly sized. The distance of ossification on the sagittal CT images can help the surgeon determine the upper and lower range of the window (Figure 1).\n2. Skin marking and anesthesia\nHave the patient lay prone on a Jackson spinal table, with ECG, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation monitoring.\nUnder C-arm fluoroscopic guidance, determine the segmental lesion and puncture path. Confirm the segmental lesion by anatomical features such as the ribs and osteophyte. The puncture target is the center point of the triangle formed by the upper and lower pedicles and spinous process. The path is 10°-15° to the head inclination (Figure 2).\nUse local anesthesia.\n\t\nUse dexmedetomidine at a concentration of 4 µg/mL for continuous venous inflow at a dose of 0.1-0.5 µg/kg/h by a micro-pump. The proportion of the local anesthetic is 0.5% lidocaine and 0.25% ropivacaine.\nIn order to relieve the pain of the patient during the procedure, inject more anesthetics into the following sites: skin, fascia, paraspinal muscle, and the surface of the vertebral lamina. The dose of local anesthetics is 5 mL for skin, 8 mL for fascia, 5 mL for paraspinal muscle, and 8 mL for the surface of the vertebral lamina.\n3. Working sheath establishment",
    "Make a surgical incision approximately 40-60 mm from the midline with a no. 11 surgical blade. Incise the fascia sharply. Use the guide rod with a blunt head for puncture. Confirm the target by C-arm fluoroscopy (Figure 3).\nInsert the working sheath to the lamina surface along the guide rod. Nail a 2.5 mm diameter Kirschner wire into the lamina softly with the hammer as a marker (Figure 4).\n4. Endoscopic operation\nHang an irrigation bag containing 2 L of 0.9% saline solution approximately 1-1.5 m above the patient. Connect the bag to the endoscope with a transfusion tube. Continuous saline is transfused to the endoscopy, which can provide clear vision for the endoscopic operation.\nUse the bipolar electrocoagulation probe to peel off the soft tissue covering the surface of the vertebral lamina, and take it out using forceps to expose the cortical bone of the vertebral lamina. Look for the small hole left by the Kirschner wire under the endoscopy as a mark (Figure 5).\nFind the lateral boundary of the articular process. Grind off the cortical bone of the vertebral lamina to be removed with a high-speed burr to mark the boundary of the bone window. Take the diameter of the burr as a scale (Figure 6).\nGrind off the medial half of the facet joint and the ipsilateral lamina with a high-speed burr. During the grinding process, the layers of the vertebral lamina can be observed as cortical bone, cancellous bone, and inner cortical bone. After this step, ossified ligamentum flavum or soft hypertrophic ligamentum flavum with different colors to the cortical bone can be seen (Figure 7).",
    "Grind the ossification away softly with a high-speed burr. During the grinding process, use the probe or hook intermittently to check whether the ossification is loose. When the ossification is loose, try not to press down the burr, but slide it on the surface of the ossification to thin it.\n\t\nSeparate the ossification from the spinal cord with a hook, and remove with the forceps or rongeurs (Figure 8).\nPerform contralateral spinal canal decompression using the \"over the top\" technique.\n\t\nGrind the inner layer of bone under the dorsal side of the spinal cord, the base of the spinous process, and gradually push the burr to the contralateral side. Grind the contralateral vertebral lamina to achieve the contralateral articular process and pedicle wall.\n\t\tNOTE: Sufficient space around the spinal cord and pulsation of the spinal cord are signs of adequate decompression. These decompression operations are performed over the top of the spinal cord (Figure 9).\n\t\tNOTE: The DO resection is the most difficult part of this operation.\nExpose the boundary of the DO from its cranial and caudal sides. When grinding and separating the OLF, there is adhesion between the dura and the ossification. The part where the adhesion occurs is the boundary of the DO.\n\t\nTo take out the ossification easily, grind the massive ossification into pieces using the eggshell technique. Start grinding from the center and gradually approach the spinal cord, so that the whole block becomes an eggshell13.\nIsolate the ossification at the junction between the ossification and the lamina (Figure 10).\n\t\tNOTE: The junction between the ossification and the lamina is broken in the above step. The DO adheres to the spinal cord and floats in the spinal canal.",
    "Separate the eggshell-shaped ossification with a hook. Grab it in pieces with forceps or a lamina rongeur, and remove the ossification from the gap between the DO and the spinal cord. The dural defect left after resection of the DO does need repair (Figure 11).\nConfirm that the range of decompression is large enough. There are some signs under endoscopy that indicate sufficient decompression. First, there is space between the spinal cord and vertebral lamina at the cranial, caudal, ipsilateral, and contralateral sides of the spinal canal. Second, the spinal cord can pulsate freely under endoscopy (Figure 12).\nUse the bipolar electrocoagulation probe to coagulate the bleeding points. Hemostatic materials are not recommended. Check that there is no active bleeding in the operation field. Remove the endoscopy slowly to avoid negative pressure caused by rapid withdrawal, which may cause dural herniation.\n5. Postoperative care\nNOTE: The patient stayed in bed for 24 h after the operation.\nDisinfect the wound 24 h after the operation and replace the dressing. Monitor muscle strength and sensation of the lower extremities within 48 h. Administer celecoxib orally for 1 week.\n\tNOTE: The patient could get out of bed with a brace 24 h after the operation.\nAvoid back exercise for 6 weeks.\nSubscription Required.
