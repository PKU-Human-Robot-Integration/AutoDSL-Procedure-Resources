    "Day before the assay Take a biopsy from the sample tube and wash first in 70% isopropanol followed by 1x PBS to remove any residues of blood and other impurities.In the next step, remove fat and tissue (see Figures 1A and 1B).Cut the biopsy (see Figure 1B) into small pieces (0.4 x 0.4 cm approximately) (see Figure 1C) and place them in enzymatic digestion solution in a 15 ml centrifuge tube.Store the biopsy for enzymatic digestion at 4 °C for 16 h (under non-stirring conditions). Hydrate the sensor cartridge in Seahorse XF Calibrant according to the manufacturer’s instructions one day prior to measurement in a non-CO2 incubator.Turn on the XF24 analyzer to preheat the system to 37 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190227/20190227224519_9090.jpgFigure 1.

Capture screen insert tool with Islet capture screens (Agilent Technologies).Day of the assay Prepare the XF assay medium and heat to 37 °C. After enzymatic digestion, carefully remove epidermis from the dermis (tweezers) and place in Petri dish with 1x PBS (see Figure 1D). In this step, it is important to ensure that the basal side is facing down towards the bottom of the petri dish. The epidermal sheet should be placed with the vital–basal–side on the capture screen. This orientation is essential for the measurement as the side facing the capture screen gets detected by the sensor (see Figure 2E). Carefully lift the epidermis from the 1x PBS with a microscope slide and wipe it off on a second slide (turn over the epidermis once).",
    "Wipe off the skin with the second slide on the capture screen, pull it smoothly and insert the capture screen with the capture screen insert tool into the Islet capture microplate (see Figure 1E). The epidermis should cover the entire surface of the capture screen to ensure that it’s always to measure the same epidermis area (see Figures 2A-2C). There should be no air bubbles (see Figure 2D) under the epidermis, as they interfere with the measurement.Remove excess overhanging skin in the well with tweezers.Add 450 μl XF assay medium into each well of the Islet capture microplate.Incubate the Islet capture microplate in the incubator (without CO2) at 37 ° C for 45 min to adjust the epidermis to the new medium.Load the injection ports of the sensor cartridge as programmed (see the programming of the XF controller), follow the instructions of the XF Analyzer and start the calibration of the sensor cartridge.When calibration is complete, place the Islet capture microplate in the XF Analyzer and start measurement.Data analysis is performed with the seahorse analysis software Wave.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190227/20190227224633_1840.jpgFigure 2. Microscopic image of epidermis in the XF24 islet capture microplate. The epidermis has to be applied as flat as possible with the basal side in contact with the capture screen and then placed in the multiwell plate using the capture screen insert tool. The measurement of oxygen consumption takes place over the surface within the ring marked with the arrow (A). Within the ring in the center of the net, there should be no holes (B) or air bubbles (D). Flat-mounted epidermis, without air bubbles, which covers the entire surface and with the right orientation (C).

    "Programming the XF controllerThis section describes the individual program steps of the XF controller for measuring the oxygen consumption rate as shown in Figure 2. The stress reagents are diluted to a final concentration of 4 μM with XF assay medium. The concentration of Oligomycin, FCCP and Rotenone/Antimycin A should be determined in a preliminary experiment for the respective experimental conditions. The injection of the stress reagent simultaneously should be carried out in all wells. Workflow of the XF controller:Calibrate ProbesTime of Delay: 15 minFirst Loop–3 times (Basal state)Mixing: 4 minTime of Delay: 2 minMeasurement: 3 minInjection of Port A (50 μl Oligomycin, 4 μM final concentration)Use oligomycin to block the ATP synthase. Then equivalent the decrease in OCR to the amount of oxygen used for the synthesis of ATP.Second Loop–6 times (decrease of ATP-linked respiration)Mixing: 4 minTime of Delay: 2 minMeasurement: 3 minInjection of Port B (55 μl FCCP, 4 μM final concentration)The decoupling of the respiratory chain by FCCP allows the maximal respiration and the spare respiratory capacity to be determined independently of the proton gradient.Third Loop–3 times (potentially uncoupled respiration)Mixing: 4 minTime of Delay: 2 minMeasurement: 3 minInjection of Port C (60 μl Rotenone/Antimycin A, 4 μM final concentration)In the last Loop, complexes I and II are blocked by the addition of Rotenone and Antimycin A. The remaining oxygen consumption thus depends only on the non-mitochondrial respiration.Fourth Loop–6 times (non-mitochondrial respiration)Mixing: 4 minTime of Delay: 2 minMeasurement: 3 minEnd of Program"
