    "All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health (NIH) and were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee (JHUACUC). The specific procedures were performed under the approved ACUC protocol MO13M108. \n1. Donor Operation\nAdminister analgesia at the appropriate time point for each pharmacological formulation prior to surgery. As per the approved animal care and use protocol use 0.1 mg/kg BW of buprenorphine subcutaneously 1 hr prior to skin incision.\nSedate the donor with isoflurane applied through a chamber attached to an isoflurane vaporizer at 4%; maintain sedation and anesthesia at 2% through a nose cone. Perform toe pinch withdrawal reflection to monitor the depth of anesthesia prior to the initiation of the procedure.\nWear masks, disposable isolation gowns and gloves.\nShave the surgical area, in particular the hind limb and groin, and prep with 10% Povidone - Iodine.\nUse a sterile field drape, autoclaved instruments and a high magnification microscope (40X).\nMake groin skin incision using scissors proximally to the mid-thigh area and circumferentially connect the incision to demarcate the hind limb from the rest of the mouse body.\nIdentify and dissect the femoral artery, vein and nerve. Separate all three structures using forceps and micro-scissors.\nOnce the vascular pedicle is dissected divide the vessels at the level of the inguinal ligament using micro scissors.\nNext, continue to divide the individual ventral (gracilis and medial thigh muscles) and dorsal muscle groups 20 proximally at the level of the mid-thigh to separate the graft from the donor animal using scissors.\nTransect the femur and cut at the mid of the femoral shaft using scissors.\nEuthanize animal by isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. Confirm cessation of heart beat and respiration.",
    "Flush the limb with 2 ml heparinized (30 I.E.) cold (4 °C) saline by using a 33 G flushing needle mounted on a syringe (see Materials Table).\nPlace one polyimide cuff on the femoral vein and artery, respectively.\nWrap graft into wet cotton gauze, place in petri dish and store at 4 °C until inset.\n2. Recipient Operation\nRemoval of the Hind Limb\nAdminister analgesia at the appropriate time point for each pharmacological formulation prior to surgery. As per the approved animal care and use protocol use 0.1 mg/kg BW of Buprenorphine SC 1 hr prior to skin incision.\nSedate the donor with isoflurane applied through a chamber attached to an isoflurane vaporizer at 4%; maintain sedation and anesthesia at 2% through a nose cone. Perform toe pinch withdrawal reflection to monitor the depth of anesthesia prior to the initiation of the procedure.\nUse veterinary ointment on the eyes of the mouse to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nShave the surgical area, in particular the hind limb and groin and prep with 10% Povidone - Iodine.\nMake groin skin incision using scissors proximally to the mid-thigh area and circumferentially connect the incision to demarcate the hind limb from the rest of the mouse body.\nIdentify and dissect the femoral artery, vein and nerve and separate all three structures using forceps and micro-scissors.\nOnce the vascular pedicle is dissected, clamp the femoral vessels at the level of the inguinal ligament.\nCut the vessels distal at the level of the superficial epigastric artery.\nNext, continue to divide the individual ventral (gracilis and medial thigh muscles) and dorsal muscle groups 20 proximally at the level of the mid-thigh to separate the native hind limb from the recipient animals using scissors.\nTransect the femur in the middle of the femoral shaft using scissors.",
    "Cauterize previously transected thigh muscles to prevent bleeding of the dissection site and thus recipient blood loss.\nImplantation\nMinimize fluid loss by irrigating the operative field with warm saline (37 °C) and injecting 0.3 ml warm saline before and after the operation.\nPlace the graft in a way that reflects the accurate anatomical position of the native hind limb by aligning the femur bone of the recipient and the graft and connect them using a 20 G spinal needle as an intramedullary rod.\nCoapt the ventral and dorsal muscle groups using absorbable suture material (6-0 Polysorb).\nConnect the femoral vessels using the non-suture cuff technique; in detail, pull the recipient side of the vessel over the cuffs previously mounted on the vessel ends of the graft. Use a 10-0 Nylon suture and perform a circumferential tie to fix the recipient vessel onto the cuff.\nNext release the clamps. At this stage visually verify cuff rotation and optimal positioning to prevent mis-rotation and kinking of the vessels.\nPerform meticulous hemostasis using electro cautery with a particular focus on the muscle recipient donor interface and the bone ends.\nClose the skin using non-absorbable Nylon sutures (6-0 Ethilon).\nEstablish normothermic conditions by allowing the animal to recover in its cage under a heating lamp. Continue regular monitoring for at least 4 hr prior to returning it to the housing facility.\nProvide post-operative analgesia with Buprenorphine at a dose of 0.1mg/kg SC every 6-8 hr for 3 days.\nSubscription Required.
