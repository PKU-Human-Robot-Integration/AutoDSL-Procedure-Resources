    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1: prepare experimental plates\nTiming: 30 min preparation, 12 h incubation\nThe experimental plates can be stored at −80°C for up to a week.\nCoat plates with 50 μL of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at 0.5 ug/mL diluted in 1× PBS (pH 7.4).\nCover plates using plate sealers.\nDay 2: ELISA experiment\nTiming: 6 h\nFor this step, an indirect ELISA is performed - the proteins reactive to SARS-CoV-2 Spike in human milk would bind to SARS-CoV-2 Spike coating, then the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Anti-IgG/IgA/IgM/SC) is added to target the human proteins, TMB and HCl (1N) is added for a colorimetric reaction that can be read on the plate reader.\nRetrieve and thaw human milk samples from freezer.\nFresh human milk samples can also be used in this protocol and all samples would be processed the same prior to storage as described in step 2 below.\nWhen choosing negative control samples, we recommend including at least 10 pre-pandemic (pre-Dec 2019) milk samples to determine cutoff values. If these samples are not available, samples obtained after Dec 2019 from participants with no history of confirmed or suspected infection or known exposure to close contacts, though in this case more control samples (20–30) may be needed in order to remove significant outliers from the control dataset as these may be due to unknown previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nPre-pandemic control samples may be pooled to be used as a negative control in all experiments.\nSimilarly, positive samples can be pooled as a positive control to be used in each assay.\nScreened controls should be included on every plate of each subsequent experiment to reduce plate-to-plate variation.\nCentrifuge thawed samples in 50 mL conical tubes at 805×g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Remove any remaining fat from the top of each sample.\nRemove fat by scooping with a sterile spatula or by pouring off fat layer.\nSamples can be frozen or used immediately.\nPrepare 1× PBS/0.1% Tween-20 wash buffer.\nWe recommend preparing at least 4 liters wash buffer in a bottle that can be connected to the Tecan HydroSpeed plate washer, or similar to uniformly wash all wells of each plate.\nPrepare blocking buffer using 0.1% PBS-T/3% goat serum/0.5% milk powder.\nWash plates using the Tecan HydroSpeed plate washer using prepared wash buffer.\nSet up a program with 3 rounds of washing/aspiration filling to max capacity of your plate.\nNote, plate washing can be performed manually while ensuring proper aspiration of all liquid before moving forward.\nAdd 50 μL blocking buffer to each well of your washed experimental plates.\nIncubate experimental plates for 1 h at room temperature.\nDuring the one hour incubation, set up 4-fold titrations in separate round-bottom polypropylene dilution plates with samples and any relevant controls (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) at set concentrations in 1% BSA diluted in 1× PBS, pH 7.4.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1479-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Sample plate layout\nStart titrations with undiluted processed milk to maximize sensitivity.\nInclude pre-pandemic/naïve and positive controls in the assay.\nWe recommend leaving a few wells without any samples and a few wells without any secondary antibody to ensure reagents are performing as expected.\nAfter incubating for 1 h in blocking buffer, wash plates as described in step 6.\nTransfer 50 μL of samples prepared in dilution plates to washed experimental plates.\nIncubate covered experimental plates containing relevant samples for 2 h at room temperature.\nPrepare goat anti-human secondary antibodies in 1× PBS, pH 7.4\nWe recommend using the following ratios of antibody to 1× PBS if using the ones specified above:\nGoat anti-human IgA 1:6000",
    "Goat anti-human IgG 1:2000\nGoat anti-human IgM 1:2000\nGoat anti-human secretory component (SC) 1:2000\nAfter the experimental plates complete the 2 h incubation with samples, wash as described in step 6 using the Tecan HydroSpeed plate washer.\nAdd 50 μL prepared secondary antibodies to relevant experimental plates.\nNote, one secondary is tested per set of samples. To test multiple secondary antibodies, set up relevant additional experimental plates.\nIncubate covered experimental plates for 1 h at room temperature.\nDuring this incubation, it is recommended to remove the TMB Substrate from 4°C to acclimate to room temperature.\nAfter incubation with secondary antibodies, wash as described in step 6 using wash buffer.\nAdd 50 μL TMB Substrate to each well and allow plates to develop for 5–10 min, maintaining timing consistency with any future experiments.\nIf successful, you should see relevant saturation based on the dilutions set up to help determine the best amount of time needed to develop under your specific conditions for future experiments.\nAfter the TMB Substrate has developed, add 25 μL 1N HCl to stop the reaction.\nPromptly read endpoint data from experimental plates at an absorbance of 450 nm on BioTek Powerwave HT plate reader using BioTek Gen5 3.08 software, or similar.\nPlate readers with the same specifications could be used at user’s discretion.\nExport data as an Excel file for further analysis."
