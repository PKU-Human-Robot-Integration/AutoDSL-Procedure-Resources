    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPerforming transcytosis and recycling assays on organoid monolayers\nTiming: 1 day\nThis protocol describes transcytosis and recycling assays for both intestinal organoid or cell line monolayers and it is designed for 6.5 mm (24 well) Transwell filters. For different filter sizes, scaling up/down accordingly is possible (adjust cell/organoid numbers accordingly).\nNote: GLuc-Fc is a recombinant protein in which the Fc (FcRN-binding) domain of human IgG1 was fused to Gaussia luciferase. GLuc-FcMN is a mutant in the FcRn-binding domain of IgG which can bind FcRN with high affinity, and FcIHH is non-binding mutant. Both constructs are available on addgene, Fc-GlucMN Addgene ID: 198194 and Fc-GlucIHH Addgene ID: 198195. For detailed information regarding the isolation of the protein constructs.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] The GLuc-FMN was transported and recycled in both directions efficiently across. Human organoids (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), Caco2-FcRN cell (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nAdditionally, tight junction barriers can be disrupted to test paracellular trafficking by supplementing buffers with EDTA (2 mM) for 3 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2714-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Leave 1 mL HBSS-G (pH 8.0) in the basolateral chamber.\nFor basolateral to apical transcytosis add 1 mL of Tc Buffer to the basolateral chamber of the transwell. Leave 200 μL HBSS-G (pH 8.0) in the apical chamber\nPrepare Tc Buffer containing 1 μg/mL of either GLucFc-MN or GLucFc-IHH GLuc-FcMN binds FcRN with high affinity, and GLuc-FcIHH abolishes binding to FcRN.\nNote: The purpose we use 2 recombinant proteins are to see FcRN-dependent phenotype.\nAfter 20 min, replace the Tc Buffer with respective GLucFc (GLucFc-MN or -IHH).\nFor apical to basolateral transcytosis, replace 200 μL of Tc Buffer with GLucFc to the apical chamber of the Transwell.",
    "For basolateral to apical transcytosis, replace 1000 μl of Tc Buffer with GLucFc to the basolateral chamber of the Transwell.\nRemove 20 μL of basolateral buffer as control for luciferase assay (GLuc activity).\nIncubate transwells with GLucFc constructs for 90 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nRemeasure TEER values to ensure monolayer is still intact.\nNote: It is paramount to avoid touching the monolayer when changing the buffer to avoid disrupting the monolayer. Additionally, depending on the respective biological questions asked – impairments of barrier function during the assay might occur. This can be readily determined by a drop in TEER. Reduction in barrier formation might allow for paracellular flux of IgG variants and strongly confound assay results.\nGently mix the buffer on the apical or basolateral side and collect 100 μL for measuring GLuc activity.\nMeasure GLuc activity in duplicate by adding 20 μL of HBSS-G (pH 8.0) from the ‘basolateral side (apical to basolateral transcytosis) or apical side (basolateral to apical transcytosis) into white 96 well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #165306) and then add 80 μL coelenterazine (Nanolight) per well. (Victor X3 plate reader PerkinElmer).\nApical (or Basolateral) Recycling assay:\nEquilibrate the transwells in Transcytosis buffer (Tc Buffer) for 20 min at 37°C with 5% CO2..\nAdd 200 μL of Tc Buffer to the apical chamber of the transwell and 1 mL Tc Buffer (pH 6.0) in the basolateral chamber.\nPrepare Tc Buffer with 1 ug/mL of the GLucFc-MN or GLucFc-IHH construct.\nAfter 20 min, replace the Tc Buffer with respective GLucFc (GLucFcMN or IHH)\nFor apical recycling, add 200 μL of Tc Buffer + GlucFC to the apical chamber\nFor basolateral recycling add 1 mL of Tc Buffer to the basolateral chamber\nGently mix and remove 20 μL of apical buffer as control for luciferase assay.",
    "Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 60 min to allow GLucFC uptake.\nAfter 30 min, aspirate Tc Buffer and wash 3 times with ice cold PBS.\nAdd fresh HBSS-G (pH 8.0) to monitor recycling at 37°C and either:\n200 μL to apical side for apical recycling with 1 mL of Tc Buffer to the basolateral chamber, or\n1 mL to basolateral side for basolateral recycling with 200 μl of Tc Buffer to the apical chamber.\nIncubate at 37°C. Collect 20 μL HBSS-G at each time point (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 min) and replace with 20 μL fresh HBSS-G after collection. For caco2-FcRN and human enteroids, the change in recycling over time is seen within 60 min\nAdd each timepoint of 20 μL HBSS-G into 96 well plate and add 80 μL coelenterazine per well to measure luciferase activity.\nMake Standard curve that ranges from 0.01% to 1% of the GLuc-Fc concentration (e.g., 0.1–10 pg/μL in HBSS-G) and calculate Ig concentration."
