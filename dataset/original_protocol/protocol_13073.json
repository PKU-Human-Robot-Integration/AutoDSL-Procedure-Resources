    "1. Experimental Protocol\nSample preparation\n\tNOTE: Perform cell seeding and transfection under sterile conditions.\n\t\nPlace a cleaned coverslip per well into a 6-well culture plate and wash three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\tNOTE: The coverslip cleaning protocol is detailed in Supplementary Note 1.\nTo each well, add 2 mL of the complete cell culture medium containing phenol red (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 µg/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin) and keep the plate aside.\nCulture the CHO cells in the same medium containing phenol red at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Wash the cells with 5 mL of PBS to remove the dead cells.\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin and incubate for 2 min at room temperature (RT).\nDilute the detached cells with 8 mL of medium containing phenol red and mix carefully by pipetting.\nCount the cells in a Neubauer chamber and seed at a density of 1.5 x 105 cells/well in the 6-well cell culture plate containing the coverslips (prepared in step 1.1.1-1.1.2).\nLet the cells grow in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 24 h in order to achieve approximately 80% confluency.\nDilute 2 µg of the desired vector DNA (e.g., CT-SNAP or NT-SNAP) and 6 µL of the transfection reagent in two separate tubes, each containing 500 µL of the reduced-serum medium for each well and incubate for 5 min at RT.\nMix the two solutions together to obtain the transfection mixture and incubate it for 20 min at RT.\nIn the meantime, wash the seeded CHO cells once with sterile PBS.\nReplace the PBS with 1 mL/well of phenol red-free medium supplemented with 10% FBS without any antibiotics.",
    "Add the entire 1 mL of transfection mixture dropwise to each well and incubate the cells overnight at 37 °C, in 5% CO2.\nFor labeling of the SNAP construct, dilute the appropriate SNAP substrate stock solution in 1 mL of the medium supplemented with 10% FBS to obtain a final concentration of 1 µM.\nWash the transfected cells once with PBS and add 1 mL per well of 1 µM SNAP substrate solution. Incubate the cells for 20 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nWash the cells thrice with phenol red-free medium and add 2 mL per well phenol red-free medium. Incubate the cells for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nTransfer the coverslips of all samples subsequently into the imaging chamber and wash with 500 µL imaging buffer. Add 500 µL imaging buffer before moving to the FRET-FCS setup.\nCalibration Measurements\n\t​NOTE: The FRET-FCS setup is equipped with a confocal microscope water objective, two laser lines, a Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system, two hybrid photomultiplier tubes (PMT) and two avalanche photodiodes (APD) for photon collection and the data collection software. It is very important to align the setup every time before live cell measurements. The detailed setup description can be found in Supplementary Note 2. Both lasers and all detectors (two PMTs and two APDs) are always ON during the measurements, as all measurements need to be conducted under identical conditions. For the calibration measurements, use a coverslip from the same lot on which the cells were seeded, this decreases the variation in collar ring correction.\n\t\nFor adjusting the focus, pinhole and collar ring position, place 2 nM green calibration solution on a glass coverslip and switch on the 485 nm and 560 nm laser. Operate laser in Pulsed Interleaved Excitation (PIE) mode16.",
    "Focus on the solution and adjust the pinhole and collar ring position such that the highest count rate and smallest confocal volume are obtained to get the maximum molecular brightness.\nRepeat this process for the red channels with 10 nM red calibration solution and a mixture of both, the green and red calibration solution.\nPlace the 10 nM DNA solution on a glass coverslip and adjust the focus, pinhole, and collar ring position such that the cross-correlation between the green and red detection channels is highest, i.e., shows the highest amplitude.\n\t\tNOTE: Steps 1.2.1 and 1.2.4 might have to be repeated back and forth to find the optimal alignment. Take 3-5 measurements from each calibration solution for 30 s - 120 s after the focus, pinhole, and collar ring position have been aligned optimally for the green and red detection channels and the confocal overlap volume.\nMeasure a drop of ddH2O, the imaging medium, and a non-transfected cell 3-5 times each for 30 s - 120 s to determine the background count rates.\nCollect the instrument response function with 3-5 measurements for 30 s - 120 s. This is optional but highly recommended.\nLive cell measurements\n\t\nFind a suitable cell by illuminating with the mercury lamp and observing through the ocular.\n\t\t​NOTE: Suitable cells are alive showing the typical morphology of the respective adherent cell line. The fluorescence of the protein of interest, here a surface receptor, is visible all over the surface. Less bright cells are more suitable than brighter ones due to the better contrast in FCS when a low number of molecules are in focus.\nSwitch on both lasers in PIE mode and focus on the membrane by looking at the maximum counts per second.",
    "NOTE: The laser power might need to be reduced for the cell samples (less than 5 µW at objective). This depends upon the used fluorophores and the setup.\nObserve the auto- and cross-correlation curves of the eGFP or labelled SNAP-tag attached to the  β2AR in the online preview of the data collection software and collect several short measurements (~2 -10) with an acquisition time between 60 -180 s.\n\t\t​NOTE: Do not excite the cells for a long time continuously as the fluorophores may bleach. However, it will depend on the brightness of each cell, how long the measurements can be, and how many measurements in total can be performed.\n2. Data analysis\nData Export\n\t\nExport the correlation curves, G(tc), and count rates, CR, from all measurements.\nTake care to correctly define the \"prompt\" and \"delay\" time windows and use the \"microtime gating\" option in the data correlation software.\n\t\tNOTE: In total, three different correlations are required: (1) autocorrelation of the green channel in the prompt time window (ACFgp), (2) autocorrelation of the red channels in the delay time window (ACFrd), and finally (3) the cross-correlation of the green channel signal in the prompt time window with the red channel signal in the delay time window (CCFPIE). The data export is shown step-by-step for different software in Supplementary Note 3.\nCalibration measurements\n\t\nUse the autocorrelation functions of the green (ACFgp) and red (ACFrd) fluorophore solutions, and fit them to a 3D diffusion model with an additional triplet term if required (eq. 1) to calibrate the shape and size of the confocal detection volume for the two used color channels:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq01v2.png eq. 1",
    "Here, b is the baseline of the curve, N the number of molecules in focus, tD the diffusion time (in ms), and s = z0/w0 the shape factor of the confocal volume element. The triplet blinking or other photophysics is described by its amplitude aR and relaxation time tR.\n\t\tNOTE: All variables and symbols used within the protocol are listed in Table 1.\nUse the known diffusion coefficients D for the green26 and red calibration standard27 and the obtained shape factors sgreen and sred to determine the dimensions (width w0 and height z0) and volume Veff of the confocal volume element (eq. 2a-c).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq02.jpg     eq. 2a\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq03.jpg     eq. 2b\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq04.jpg     eq. 2c\n\t\tNOTE: Templates for calculation of the calibration parameter are provided as supplementary files (S7).\nCalculate the spectral crosstalk α of the green fluorescence signal (collected in channels 0 and 2) into the red detection channels (channel number 1 and 3) as a ratio of the background-corrected (BG) signals (eq. 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq05.jpg\n\t\teq. 3\nDetermine the direct excitation of the acceptor fluorophore δ by the donor excitation wavelength by the ratio of the background-corrected count rate of the red calibration measurements in the \"prompt\" time window (excitation by green laser) to the background-corrected count rate in the \"delay\" time window (excitation by red laser) (eq. 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq06v2.png\n\t\teq. 4\nCalculate the molecular brightness B of both the green and red fluorophores (eq. 5a-b) based on the background-corrected count rates and the obtained number of molecules in focus, N, from the 3D diffusion fit (eq. 1):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq07.jpg     eq. 5a\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq08.jpg     eq. 5b",
    "Fit both ACFgp and ACFrd as well as CCFPIE of the double-labeled DNA to the 3D diffusion model (eq. 1). Keep the obtained shape factors, sgreen and sred, constant for ACFgp and ACFrd, respectively. The shape factor for the CCFPIE, sPIE, is usually in between these two values.\n\t\tNOTE: In an ideal setup, both Veff,green and Veff, red would have the same size and overlap perfectly.\nDetermine the amplitude at zero correlation time, G0(tc), based on the found values of the apparent number of molecules in focus (Ngreen, Nred and NPIE).\nCalculate the amplitude ratio rGR and rRG for a sample with 100% co-diffusion of green and red fluorophores (eq. 6). Be aware that NPIE does not reflect the number of double-labeled molecules in focus but reflects only the 1/G0(tc).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq09.jpg  and  imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq10.jpg     eq. 6\nLive cell experiments\n\t\nFor single-labeled constructs, fit the cell samples to an appropriate model. For the shown membrane receptor, diffusion occurs in a bimodal fashion with a short and a long diffusion time. Additionally, the photophysics and blinking of the fluorophores have to be considered:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq011v2.png eq. 7\n\t\tHere, td1 and td2 are the two required diffusion times, and a1 is the fraction of the first diffusion time.\n\t\tNOTE: In contrast to the calibration measurements, in which the free dyes and DNA strands freely diffuse in all directions, the membrane receptor shows only 2D diffusion along the cell membranes. This difference between 3D and 2D diffusion is reflected by the modified diffusion term (compare eq. 1), where tD in the 2D case does not depend upon the shape factor s of the confocal volume element.\nCalculate the concentration c of green or red labeled proteins from the respective N and Veff using basic math (eq. 8):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq12.jpg     eq. 8\n\t\t​where NA = Avogadro's number",
    "For N-terminal SNAP label and intracellular eGFP, fit the two autocorrelations (ACFgp and ACFrd) of the double-labeled sample using the same model as for the single-labeled constructs for the ACFs (eq. 7) and the CCFPIE using a bimodal diffusion model (eq. 9):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq13.jpg      eq. 9\n\t\t​NOTE: For a global description of the system, all three curves have to be fit jointly: The diffusion term is identical for all three curves and the only difference is the relaxation term for the CCFPIE. As photophysics of two fluorophores is usually unrelated, no correlation term is required. This absence of relaxation terms results in a flat CCFPIE at short correlation times. However, crosstalk and direct excitation of the acceptor due to the donor fluorophore might show false-positive amplitudes and should be carefully checked for using the calibration measurements.\nCalculate the concentration c of green or red labeled proteins from the respective N and Veff using equation 8.\nEstimate the fraction or concentration, cGR or cRG, of interacting green and red labeled proteins from the cell samples using the correction factors obtained from the DNA samples, the amplitude ratios rGR and rRG of the cell sample and their respective obtained concentrations (eq. 10).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq14.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq15.jpg     eq. 10\nFor C-terminal SNAP label and intracellular eGFP, fit the two autocorrelations (ACFgp and ACFrd) of the FRET sample as the single-labeled samples (equation 7) and the CCFFRET to a bimodal diffusion model containing an anti-correlation term (equation 11)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62954/62954eq016v2.png eq. 11\n\t\twhere af reflects the amplitude of the total anti-correlation and aR and tR the respective amplitude and relaxation time.",
    "NOTE: In case of anti-correlated fluorescence changes due to FRET, one or several anti-correlation terms might be required (eq. 11), resulting in a \"dip\" of CCFFRET at low correlation times coinciding with a rise in the two autocorrelations (ACFgp and ACFrd). However, be aware that photophysics such as triplet blinking might mask the anti-correlation term by dampening the FRET-induced anti-correlation. A joint analysis supplemented with filtered FCS methods might help to unmask the anti-correlation term. Additionally, technical artifacts stemming from dead times in the counting electronics in the nanoseconds range should be excluded16. A more detailed step-by-step procedure on how to perform the analysis in ChiSurf28 and templates for the calculation of confocal volume or molecular brightness are provided on the Github repository (https://github.com/HeinzeLab/JOVE-FCS) and as supplementary files (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Note 6). Additionally, the python-scripts for batch export of data acquired with the Symphotime software in .ptu format can be found there."
