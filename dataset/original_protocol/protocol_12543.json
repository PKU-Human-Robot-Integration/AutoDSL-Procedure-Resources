    "All procedures were performed in accordance and compliance with federal regulations and University of Iowa policy and were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Animals and husbandry\nKeep the animals in a 12 h daylight cycle with food and water ad libitum.\nUse CD-1 female mice aged 8-15 weeks. Use the presence of a copulatory plug to identify E0.5.\nOn E0.5, singly house the pregnant dams.\n2. Calibration of the micropipette\nNOTE: The calibration of the micropipette should be performed prior to surgery when possible.\nPrior to making and calibrating the micropipette, dilute all the plasmids to the recommended concentration (0.1 µg/µL) in DNase-free water. Mix the plasmid with appropriately diluted Fast Green dye (1 µg/µL in PBS) (final plasmid concentration: 0.06 µg/µL).\nPull micropipettes using 10 cm glass capillaries with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm and an inner diameter of 0.86 mm with a micropipette puller.\nCarefully break off the tip of a micropipette (2-3 mm) with sterile forceps.\nLoad the micropipette into a microcapillary tip attached to a microinjector. Ensure the microinjector is attached to the microinjection machine and that there are sufficient levels of nitrogen to calibrate the micropipette.\nOnce the micropipette is attached to the microinjector, load it with the Fast Green dye solution to perform the calibration (1 µg/µL in PBS). Calibrate the micropipette to inject a volume of approximately 3.5 µL. Empty (\"clear\") the micropipette in preparation for loading the plasmid solutions as below.\n\t​NOTE: Each micropipette will be slightly different. To avoid damaging the placenta during the injection, the injection time should be set between 0.5-1.5 s. The pressure should be set between 1-8.5 psi. Calibrate each micropipette separately; if the micropipette cannot be calibrated within these parameters, then it should not be used.\n3. Surgery (Figure 1A)",
    "NOTE: To prepare, clean the surfaces of both the preparation and surgical areas with 70% ethanol. Place an absorbent underpad in the preparation area. In the surgery area, place a heating pad down, and then place an absorbent underpad on top of this. Sterilize all the tools prior to surgery. The time the dam is under anesthesia should be under 1 h.\nAnesthetization\n\t\nAdminister 5 mg/kg of NSAID (meloxicam) or another approved analgesic to the pregnant dam 30 min to 1 h before surgery.\nPlace the pregnant dam in an induction chamber attached to an isoflurane vaporizer.\nSet the vaporizer to 4% isoflurane and 3.5 L/min oxygen.\nOnce anesthetization has been confirmed by the lack of response to a toe pinch and a reduced breathing rate, remove the dam from the induction chamber to the preparation area.\nSurgery preparation\n\t\nIn the preparation area, place the dam supine with a nose cone.\nReduce the vaporizer to 2% isoflurane and 3.5 L/min oxygen while the dam is in the nose cone.\nShave the abdomen of the dam thoroughly and remove excess fur. Alternate coating the shaved abdomen with povidone solution and 70% ethanol three times using sterile cotton-tipped applicators. Apply final coat of povidone solution. To prevent corneal drying, place artificial tear gel over both eyes of the dam (Figure 2A, B).\nAfter preparation, move the dam with the nose cone to the designated surgery area.\nUterine laparotomy\n\tNOTE: Use sterile gloves throughout the surgical procedure. Change the gloves if any non-sterile surface is contacted. \n\t\nIn the surgery area, place the dam supine, and secure the nose cone in place with tape. Set the heating pad underneath the absorbent pad to 45 °C.",
    "Using forceps and scissors, make an approximate 2 cm midline incision through the skin. Use forceps to tent the skin, and make a vertical incision into the skin. After this, make another similarly sized incision through the peritoneum to expose the uterine horns. Using forceps, tent the peritoneum while making the vertical incision (Figure 2C, D).\n\t\tNOTE: Failure to properly tent while incising the peritoneum may lead to a fatal incision of the intestines.\nGently massage the uterine horns through the incision by pressing on the sides of the abdomen. Do this by carefully guiding the uterus without tools, using only fingers to avoid accidental injury. Place the exposed uterus on top of a sterile surgical drape covering the abdomen of the dam and keep it moist throughout surgery with drops of sterile saline, which can be warmed to 30 °C prior to use as needed (Figure 2E, F).\n\t\tNOTE: The uterine horns can be identified as described in Wang et al.27.\nOnce the uterus is exposed, select three pairs of placentas for manipulation.\n\t\tNOTE: The placentas can be identified as described by Elmore et al.24. To maximize the survival of the embryos, no more than 6 placentas should be treated. If there are fewer than 12 embryos present, no more than 4 placentas should be injected. Select two adjacent placentas so that one receives a control injection and the other receives the experimental plasmid. The use of two adjacent placentas allows for a better comparison of placentas in similar locations in the uterus and also enables an increased rate of survival. The selected placental pairs are chosen randomly and spaced throughout both uterine horns (Figure 1B).",
    "Record the location of placental manipulations and organization of the embryos within the uterine horns so that the embryos and placentas can be identified during collection, as one dam will carry both control and experimentally treated placentas/embryos.\nPlacental injection and electroporation of the control plasmid\n\tNOTE: To maintain an aseptic technique, sterilize the electroporation paddles and microinjector with a cold sterilant before use. Change gloves if any non-sterile surface is contacted. \n\t\nUsing the calibrated micropipette, load a sufficient quantity of the appropriate control plasmid for three injections. Perform all the injections at a depth of ~0.5 mm laterally into the placenta between the decidua (white) and junctional zone (dark red) (Figure 3A-F).\nPerform injections in the three control placentas.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform all the control plasmid injections prior to the experimental injections to avoid cross-contamination of the plasmids with the micropipette. This will allow for the same micropipette to be used, as changing micropipettes and calibration time drastically increases the surgery time and decreases dam survival.\nPerform electroporation of the control plasmid-injected placentas within 2 min of the injection.\nFor electroporation, use a pair of 3 mm paddles attached to an electroporation machine. To ensure CRISPR incorporation efficiency and the viability of embryos, use the following electroporation settings: 2 pulses, 30 V, 30 ms pulse, 970 ms pulse off, unipolar.\nAfter injection but immediately prior to electroporation, coat the places of contact with sterile saline, applying the saline precisely to the three sites on the uterine wall and the paddles with a dropper or syringe.\nGently press the electroporation paddles on the lateral sides of the placenta. Place the anode paddle over the injection site and the cathode directly opposite (Figure 4A-C).",
    "Press the pulse on the electroporation machine, and wait for the two pulses to complete prior to removing the electroporation paddles.\n\t\tNOTE: A small amount of white foam is often seen between the paddles and placenta during pulses. If this does not occur, check the voltage from the paddles with a voltmeter before further use. If the reading on the voltmeter does not match the electroporation voltage setting, the paddles are nonfunctional.\nPlacental injection and electroporation of the experimental plasmid\n\t\nFollow the same instructions from step 3.4.1. to step 3.4.2. using the experimental plasmid instead of the control plasmid.\nPerform electroporation of all three experimental injected placentas within 2 min of the injection. This should be performed in the same manner as for those injected with the control plasmids. Follow step 3.4.4. to step 3.4.7.\nCompletion of the surgery\n\t\nOnce the placental manipulation is complete, gently massage the uterine horns back inside the abdominal cavity using only fingers (Figure 5A).\nFirst, perform double-knotted single sutures on the peritoneum layer using coated and braided dissolvable sutures that are 45 cm long with a 13 mm 3/8c needle alloy. Space the sutures 2-3 mm apart (Figure 5B).\nAfter suturing the peritoneum layer, suture the skin with dissolvable sutures. Triple knot the single sutures 2-3 mm apart to ensure that the dam cannot undo the suturing (Figure 5C).\nOnce the suturing is complete, set the isoflurane to 1% and the oxygen to 3.5 L/min, and apply tissue adhesive to the sutures on the skin (Figure 5D).\n\t\tNOTE: Tissue adhesive is optional but recommended to prevent re-opening of the incision due to dam chewing.\nWhen the tissue adhesive has dried, turn off the vaporizer, and remove the dam from the surgery area. Place the dam in a supportive cage on its back.",
    "4. Post-surgery care and monitoring\nAllow the pregnant dam to recuperate in a clean cage under supervision for a minimum of 30 min to ensure no immediate complications of the surgery. Observe until it is fully ambulatory and can flip onto its feet without assistance. Singly house the dam post-surgery.\nFollow the institutional post-operative care and monitoring until embryo collection. Record the dam weight, and monitor the sutures and the incision site daily.\n5. E14.5 placental collection\nOn E14.5, deeply anesthetize the dam with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (1 mg/mL ketamine and 0.1 mg/mL xylazine), and then cervically dislocate the dam.\nMake a V-shaped incision into the abdomen of the dam with scissors, and remove the uterus. Place immediately onto a 5 cm Petri dish on ice. Using forceps, carefully remove the embryo and the corresponding placenta from the uterus.\n\tNOTE: Keep a record of the embryo location and corresponding placenta in the uterine horns to determine which received the direct manipulation during surgery.\nRecord the placental weights. Using RNAse-free forceps and razors, cut the placenta in half down the midline. Put one half into 4% PFA at 4 °C. Cut the remaining half in half again, and store the remaining two quarters at −80 °C in two tubes, one with RNA storage reagent.\n\t​NOTE: Embryos and other maternal tissues can be stored from the collection at −80 °C for future use.\n6. Placental gene expression analysis\nUse the quarter of the placenta stored at −80 °C in RNA storage reagent.",
    "Process the placentas for qPCR as described in Elser et al. using the Trizol method for RNA isolation, a spectrophotometer for RNA concentration, a cDNA synthesis kit, and qPCR with SYBR Green Master Mix28. In place of the Turbo DNAfree kit DNAse referenced in Elser et al., use an RNAcleanup kit after the Trizol RNA isolation to ensure the samples do not contain contaminants28.\n\tNOTE: Read the material safety data sheet (MSDS) for Trizol, and use it in a chemical fume hood.\nAssess the plasmid insertion of the control plasmid with GFP primers and of the experimental plasmid with BLAST primers (primers listed in Supplementary Table 1). Use the CT value to determine the presence of the plasmid.\n\tNOTE: CT values above 35 are false positives, and only those below 35 should be considered a positive indicator that the plasmid was successfully inserted.\nAssess IGF-1 placental expression normalized to the housekeeping gene 18s (primers listed in Supplementary Table 1). Use the ddCT method to calculate the fold change, and then calculate the normalized fold change of the experimental samples to the mean fold change of the control samples.\n7. Placental protein level analysis\nUse the quarter of the placenta that has been stored at −80 °C. Homogenize the tissue in a buffer solution made of 11.5 mM Tris HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM protease inhibitor in diH2O with a final pH of 7.4. Use a handheld homogenizer and pestle to break up the tissue.\n\tNOTE: The sample should not exceed 10% of the volume of the buffer.",
    "Dilute the homogenized samples in the buffer at 1:12, so that they are within the detectable range of a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) kit. Perform the BCA assay according to the manufacturer's instructions, and quantify the total protein using a plate reader.\nAfter performing the BCA assay, normalize all the samples to the same total protein concentration of 2 mg/mL for the IGF-1 ELISA, as done in Gumusoglu et al.29.\nPerform the IGF-1 ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions, and quantify the IGF-1 protein levels with a plate reader using a standard concentration curve.\n8. Spatial CRIPSR verification using fluorescent in situ  hybridization labeling\nAfter the placental halves have been appropriately fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C for 1-3 days, move them into 20% sucrose at 4 °C before freezing them in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound.\nSerially section the OCT-embedded placenta halves in a −20 °C cryostat into 10 µm sections, and place them onto slides to be labeled. Section the placenta halves so that all three subregions are visible. Store the slides at −80 °C until use for in situ hybridization.\nPerform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) labeling following the manufacturer's protocols. Hybridize one slide with a dCas9-3xNLS-VP64 probe and a second \"sister\" slide of the same placenta with a Prl8a8 probe.\n\tNOTE: The dCas9-3xNLS-VP64 probe detects the presence of the overexpression plasmid. The Prl8a8 probe highlights spongiotrophoblasts of the junctional zone, which allows for the subregions of the placenta to be identifiable. These two probes are labeled on separate \"sister\" slides to avoid interference of multi-channel fluorescence with the green autofluorescence in the placentas.",
    "Label both probes with the detection dye (Opal 620). After completing the manufacturer's protocol for FISH, apply DAPI mounting medium, and place a coverslip on the slide. Seal the coverslip with clear nail polish.\nImage the slides on an upright compound fluorescence microscope, and process them using an appropriate image processing software. Here, the CellSens software was used.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
