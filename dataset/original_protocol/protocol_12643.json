    "1. Design principles for construction and test the sensor-actuator device\nSelect a protein of interest.\n\tNOTE: We designed a system for proteins located in the cytoplasm or shuttling between the cytoplasm and other compartments.\nSelect two intrabodies binding different epitopes of the target protein. In our study we selected proteins for which the intrabodies were already developed and tested28,29,30,31. When intrabodies are not available, they should be newly developed.\n\tNOTE: An alternative to intrabodies can be other molecules that interact with the protein of interest. For example, the Nef sensing device include one intrabody (sdAb19) and the SH3 domain of a p59fyn protein tyrosine kinase32.\nDesign in silico the plasmids with DNA sequences encoding the fusion proteins.\n\tNOTE: Software for plasmid design are available for free or can be purchased.\n\t\nGenerate sequences that include the following modules: membrane tag, fluorescent marker (e.g., mKate), intrabody, TCS and TF for fusion protein 1, and intrabody and TEVp for fusion protein 2.\n\t\tNOTE: Building a new architecture based on the interaction of several components requires attention to parameters that may maximize the signal activation when the target protein is detected. Specifically, we focused on TEVp activity and flexibility of the chimeric proteins to facilitate protein-protein interaction (Table 1). All these features are specified in the following points.\nInsert a flexible glycine-serine linker domain (LD) between the intrabody–TCS and/or TEVp–intrabody. The LD may be of variable length (0, 10 or 15 amino acids-AA).\nFusion protein 1: Design variants that include the high affinity TCS (S) or the low affinity TCS (L) to regulate TEVp cleavage activity. The expression of this construct is driven by a constitutive promoter. Include the GAL4VP16 transcription factor at the C-terminal of TCS to allow translocation to the nucleus upon TEVp cleavage.",
    "NOTE: We used the hEF1a promoter, but other constitutive promoters can be chosen.\nFusion protein 2: Use a constitutive (hEF1a) or doxyclycine-inducible (pTET) promoter to tune TEVp transcription. Use a degradation domain (DD) regulated by the small molecule shield to modulate protein stability.\n\t\tNOTE: Other inducible systems that tune protein expression can potentially be chosen.\nOutput: Place a reporter gene downstream UAS promoter that respond to GAL4VP16 transcription factor. Choose the output according to the application of the device (i.e., fluorescent protein, cytokine, etc.).\nPerform cloning with any preferred strategy. Here, we built plasmids with golden gate or gateway technologies.\nTest the various configuration of the device in the desired cell lines by transient transfection. Co-transfect the cells with the obtained plasmids for fusion proteins 1 and 2 and fluorescent reporter gene, such as UAS-EYFP. Fusion protein 1 include a red fluorescent protein (mkate) used as transfection marker.\n\tNOTE: Start with simple-to-transfect cell lines such as HEK293FT cells to test the devices.\n\t\nTransfection in HEK293FT cells. Seed 2 x 105 cells into a 24-well plate with 500 µL of DMEM. Transfect cells with 300 ng of total DNA using transfection reagent, vortex the mix and incubate at RT for 20 minutes.\n\t\t\nPlace cells in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. Add fresh culture medium 24 h after transfection.\nTransfection in Jurkat cells. Use 3 x 105 cells in 500 µL of RPMI cell culture medium for 24-well plate. Perform electroporation following manufacturer’s instruction. Use 2-4 µg of total DNA for each sample. Add 500 µL of fresh cell culture media 24 h after transfection.\n\t\t\nDuring electroporation, place cells and DNA mix on ice. Then, place the cells in the 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Different cell lines and transfection methods may be chosen according to the specific application of the device.",
    "Acquire microscope images to obtain a qualitative understanding of the functionality of the device. Confirm membrane localization of the fusion protein 1 by detecting the fluorescent signal (mkate) in proximity to the cell membrane. Visualize the fluorescent output (EYFP) in the presence or absence (negative control-NC) of the target protein.\n\t\nUse the cell imaging system equipped with Tx Red and GFP light cubes to detect mKate and EYFP fluorescent proteins. Use the 10x or 20x objective.\n\t\tNOTE: Use non-transfected cells to ensure that there is no autofluorescence.\nAnalyze the transfection with flow cytometry (FACS).\n\tNOTE: See Protocol 2 for sample preparation.\n\t\nEvaluate the devices in the presence of the target protein. Create an experimental matrix that combine variants of fusion protein 1 and 2, modulating TEVp with (i) constitutive hEf1a promoter (ii) doxycycline-inducible TET promoter and (iii) shield for protein stability. Add doxycycline and shield at concentrations (0-1000 nM).\nPerform FACS analysis to compare the fold induction of EYFP between samples with or without protein of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: The highest fold induction corresponds to the greatest input sensitivity in ON (presence of the target protein) as compared to the OFF (absence of the target protein) mode.\nTest the functionality of the device with respect to the desired applications.\n\t\nRun FACS analysis to measure the levels of output proteins or apoptosis, or other relevant assays.\nPerform RT PCR analysis if the output part of the device regulates expression levels of target genes. Calculate 2-ddCT in respect to the house-keeping gene (GAPDH or equivalent) and compare the fold change of output expression in ON and OFF modes.\n2. Sample preparation for flow cytometry analysis\nPerform quantitative analysis of protein devices with flow cytometer (FACS) 48 h after transfection.",
    "Aspirate the DMEM media and wash HEK293FT cells with 300 µL of PBS. Add 100 µL of trypsin and leave in the 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator for 2-4 minutes.\n\t\tNOTE: Jurkat cells do not require trypsin.\nAdd 400 µL of DMEM media without phenol red and resuspend the cells to avoid clumps formation. Transfer in FACS tubes.\nUse a flow cytometer equipped with 405, 488, and 561 nm lasers.\nCollect 30,000 – 100,000 events selected from live cell population using the following cytometer settings: 488 nm laser and 530/30 nm bandpass filter for EYFP/EGFP, 561 nm laser and 610/20 nm filter for mKate, and 405 nm laser, 450/50 filter for EBFP.\n\t\tNOTE: To set up the flow cytometer, include non-transfected cells and cells transfected with single fluorescent proteins.\nPerform analysis of collected samples using preferred software (e.g., DIVA software, Flowjo, or TASBE33 method).\n3. Characterization of the HCV sensor-actuator device\nSelect intrabodies to detect NS3 protein. scFv35 and scFv162 bind to two different epitopes and were thus chosen.\nDesign and test variants of the NS3-responsive device following the rational described in step 1.3 (e.g., Fusion protein 1: membrane tag, mKate, single chain fragment intrabody scFv35, LD0, TCS-L and TF GAL4VP16; Fusion protein 2: single chain fragment intrabody scFv162, LD0 and TEVp; Output: UAS-EYFP or UAS-hBax (apoptosis); NS3 (see Table 2)).\nTest the constructs in HEK293FT cells.\n\tNOTE: For each experiment, set a negative control that is the delivery of the device and output quantification in the absence of the protein of interest.",
    "Test the devices for TEVp under a constitutive promoter in the presence or absence of NS3. Perform transfection of fusion protein 1 (step 1.3.3), fusion protein 2 (step 1.3.4) and EYFP output step (1.3.5) in HEK293FT cells as described in step 1.5.1. Analyze the samples 48 h post-transfection by measuring the fluorescent reporter (EYFP) by flow cytometry (Protocol 2).\nAssess the interaction intrabody-NS3 by mKate and BFP colocalization using the BFP-NS3 fusion protein. Transfect cells with fusion protein 1 that includes mKate, and with a BFP-NS3. 48 h post-transfection, observe cells at confocal microscope (63x objective) to test for co-localization of fluorescent proteins.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a BFP (not fused to NS3) as negative control. In this condition BFP should show diffuse cellular localization and should not co-localize with the membrane-bound mKate.\nTest the devices for TEVp under the pTET promoter in the presence or absence of NS3. Compare EYFP in absence and presence of NS3. Co-transfect cells with fusion protein 1 (step 1.3.3), fusion protein 2 (step 1.3.4) and EYFP output (step 1.3.5) using the protocol described in step 1.5.1. Transfections are performed in the presence or absence of NS3. Analyze the samples 48 h post-transfection by measuring the fluorescent reporter (EYFP) by flow cytometry (Protocol 2).\nTest cell killing driven by NS3 device.\n\t\nReplace EYFP output with the apoptotic gene hBax.\nRepeat step 3.3.3. Collect the cells 48 h after transfection and wash with PBS before starting the assay.\nPerform apoptosis assay with Annexin V conjugated to Pacific Blue. Stain cells with apoptotic marker Annexin V (conjugated with 2.5 µL of Pacific Blue) diluted in binding buffer (1:20 volume ratio) for 10 min at room temperature.\nAnalyze the cells by flow cytometry. Calculate the apoptosis level within population as number of Pacific-Blue (Annexin V) positive cells.",
    "4. Characterization of Nef-responsive HIV sensor-actuator device\nSelect intrabodies that bind to Nef. Single domain intrabody sdAb19 and SH3 were chosen as they bind to different epitopes.\n\tNOTE: SH3 is not an intrabody but a domain of p59fyn protein tyrosine kinase that physiologically interacts with Nef.\nDesign and test variants of Nef-responsive device following the rational described in step 1.3 (e.g., Fusion protein 1: membrane tag, mKate, sdAb19, LD0, TCS-L and GAL4-VP16; Fusion protein 2: SH3, LD0 and TEVp; Output: UAS-EYFP; Nef (see Table 3)).\nTest the devices in HEK293FT and Jurkat T cells.\n\tNOTE: For each experiment we set a negative control that is delivery of the device and output quantification in the absence of the protein of interest\n\t\nTransfection of HEK293FT: Follow the procedure described in step 1.5.1 in presence or absence of Nef.\nTransfection of Jurkat T cells: Follow the procedure described in step 1.5.2 in presence or absence of Nef.\n48h post-transfection, analyze the samples with flow cytometer as described in Protocol 2.\nInfect Jurkat cells with HIV LAI strains for HIV detection.\n\t\nPrepare viral stocks at least 48 h before the experiment. Use virus obtained from transfection of HEK-293T cells with the infectious molecular clones (NIH AIDS reagents program) and commercial reagents using manufacturer instructions. Concentrate virus after 40 h by ultracentrifugation for 1 h, 64,074 x g, 4°C on 20% sucrose to avoid viral particle-free proteins. Titer viral stocks with HIV-1 p24 ELISA.\nInfect cells with HIV-1 strains with 500 ng of p24 inoculum. 40 h post-infection quantify the percentage of infected cells by detecting the viral protein p24 with KC57-FITC conjugated antibody and performing flow-cytometry analysis.",
