    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol below describes the specific steps for processing human lung tumor specimens, which are schematically indicated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. The specimen is dissociated using a combination of hydrolytic enzymes and mechanical sharing followed by FACS enrichment for live-cells to obtain a single-cell suspension applicable for scRNA-seq. The processing protocol will be specific to the specimen type. For typical resections (>100 mg), proceed to Part A. Surgical specimen dissociation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section (Part A, steps 1–13). For core needle biopsies (at least one core, typically 10–100 mg) or fine needle aspirates (typically 10–50 mg), proceed to Part B. Small size specimen dissociation (core needle biopsies, fine needle aspirations)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] section (Part B, steps 14–23). For pleural effusion samples, proceed to Part C. Pleural effusion processing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] section (Part C, steps 24–34).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2088-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the protocol for preparing of human lung biospecimens for droplet-based scRNA-seq\nThe main steps of the protocol involve mechanical & enzymatic dissociation of lung tumor, red blood cell lysis, staining of cells with live dye (Calcein AM) and fluorescently-labeled anti-human CD45 antibody, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of live-cells.\nPart A. Surgical specimen dissociation\nTiming: 1 h\nTo achieve a high quality scRNA-seq data it is critical to ensure speedy sample processing. Dissociation of clinical samples should begin immediately, within 1 to 2-h window after specimen retrieval from the patient. Delaying the dissociation is likely to lead to increased cell death and mRNA degradation. Throughout the protocol all centrifugations should be performed in a swinging bucket centrifuge unless specified otherwise.\nPlace a surgical specimen in a tube filled with 5–20 mL of 1× PBS and place on ice. The volume of 1× PBS can be adjusted according to the size of tissue. Ensure that biospecimen is completely submerged.",
    "Note: The type of tube at this step is not critical at this step. We typically use 50 mL Falcon tubes.\nWhile biospecimen is kept on ice, in a separate 1.5 mL laboratory tube prepare the enzyme mix comprising 250 μL of Enzyme H, 110 μL of Enzyme R and 40 μL μL of Enzyme A provided in the Human Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec).\nTransfer enzyme mix from step #2 into the gentleMACS C-Tube (Miltenyi Biotec) supplemented with 7.5 mL of serum-free cell culture medium (e.g., RPMI-1640).\nAspirate the buffer in which the biospecimen is submerged and transfer the tissue to a 15 mm Petri dish. While holding it with tweezers, cut the specimen into ∼5 mm3 pieces using a sharp razor (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2088-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of human lung biospecimen for dissociation\n(A) Tumor piece placed in a Petri dish.\n(B) Cutting procedure. The tumor piece can be held with tweezers or a pipette tip with one hand, while using the other hand to cut the tissue with the razor blade into smaller pieces.\n(C) Tumor cut into ∼5 mm3 pieces before dissociation.\nUsing the tweezers transfer the tissue pieces to the gentleMACS C Tube containing the enzyme mix prepared at step #3.\nPlace the gentleMACS C-Tube in the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters, and run the default program “37C_H_TDK3” for 15 min. Inspect the quality of dissociation by eye.\nNote: If no tissue chunks are visible to the naked eye proceed to next step, if the suspension contains pieces of tissue run the program for additional 10 min. The tissue dissociation step involves mechanical, enzymatic and temperature stresses to the cells, therefore minimizing the dissociation time is important. Extended dissociation may damage fragile cells, reduce cell recovery and RNA quality.",
    "Pass the dissociated cells through a 70 μm cell strainer (e.g., MACS SmartStrainer) placed in a 50 mL conical tube.\nGently rinse the 70 μm cell strainer with 20–25 mL of Cell Resuspension buffer.\nSplit the flow-through suspension into two 15 mL canonical tubes and spin at 800 × g for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully with a glass Pasteur pipette coupled to a vacuum source without disturbing the cell pellet. Leaving ∼50–100 μL of supernatant on top of the pellet.\nNote: Follow institutional guidelines to dispose biohazard. For example, the supernatant might be disposed into a 1% bleach solution.\nRed Blood Cell Lysis.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet in 1–2 mL of Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (ACK buffer, Lonza) by slowly pipetting up and down 2–3 times using 1 mL pipette. Incubate for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: This step should be performed even if red blood cells are not visually evident.\nDilute the ACK buffer by adding 20 mL of Cell Resuspension buffer.\nSplit the suspension into two 15 mL tubes, and centrifuge at 800 × g at 20°C–25°C for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. At this point, the cell pellet should be whitish or yellowish.\nNote: If cell pellet at this step appears light red, repeat RBC lysis steps.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet in 3–4 mL of refrigerated Cell Resuspension buffer, transfer onto a 35 μm Cell Strainer Snap Cap and let the fluid pass through the filter by gravity.\nPlace the collected flow through fraction onto the ice bucket and proceed to “Part D. Cell staining with live-dye and anti-CD45 antibody[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]” section.\nPart B. Small size specimen dissociation (core needle biopsies, fine needle aspirations)\nTiming: 30 min",
    "The dissociation yield of smaller size specimens (approximately 2 × 2 × 10 mm3) tends to be higher when reduced volumes of buffers are used, and when tissue dissociation is conducted for a shorter period of time. Given small size of the specimens, an extra care needs to be taken at each step to minimize the cell loss.\nUse Human Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) to prepare the enzyme mix comprising 85 μL of Enzyme H, 40 μL of Enzyme R and 15 μL μL of Enzyme A.\nTransfer enzyme mix from step #13 into the gentleMACS C-Tube (Miltenyi Biotec) supplemented with 2.5 mL of serum-free cell culture medium (e.g., RPMI-1640).\nCentrifuge the tube having a core biopsy piece(s) at 800 × g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C. Discard the supernatant and transfer the tissue pieces to the GentleMACS C-Tube containing the enzyme mix.\nPlace the GentleMACS C-Tube in the GentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters (Miltenyi), and run default program “37C_H_TDK3” for 15 min.\nVerify the dissociation by visually inspecting the solution. If the tissue is not completely dissociated, continue running the program for additional 5 min.\nNote: The dissociation step involves mechanical, enzymatic and temperature stresses to the cells, therefore minimizing the dissociation time is important. Extended dissociation may damage fragile cells and reduce RNA quality. The tissue is considered dissociated when the solution becomes cloudy and no tissue chunks are visible to the naked eye.\nApply the cell suspension obtained in step #16 onto 35 μm Cell Strainer Snap Cap placed on the Test Tube (Corning) and let the suspension pass the strainer by gravity.",
    "Rinse the GentleMACS C Tube with 1.5 mL of Cell Resuspension Buffer (equilibrated at 20°C–25°C) to collect the left-over cells, transfer the suspension onto the same Cell Strainer Snap Cap and collect the flow through fraction into the same Test Tube.\nSpin the Test Tube at 800 × g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C. Carefully aspirate the supernatant using a glass Pasteur pipette coupled to a vacuum source without disturbing the cell pellet.\nNote: To prevent disturbance of cell pellet leave ∼30–50 μL of supernatant on top of the cell pellet.\nRed Blood Cell Lysis.\nAdd 200 μL of Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (ACK buffer, Lonza) on a cell pellet and gently resuspend by slowly pipetting up and down 2–3 times. Incubate for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Always include RBC lysis even if blood cells are not visually evident in the sample.\nDilute the ACK buffer by adding 2 mL of Cell Resuspension buffer and centrifuge at 800 × g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet, leaving ∼30 μL of supernatant on top of the cell pellet. At this point, the cell pellet should be whitish or yellowish.\nNote: If cell pellet at this step appears light red, repeat RBC lysis steps.\nPlace the tube with cell suspension onto the ice bucket and proceed to “Part D. Cell staining with live-dye and anti-CD45 antibody[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]” section.\nPart C. Pleural effusion processing\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Malignant pleural effusions that form in lung cancer patients derive from fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity. Typically, the volume of pleural effusion samples varies from 50 to 1,000 mL. Macrophages, T-cells and tumor cells can be found in the pleural effusions at concentrations ranging from a dozen to thousands of cells per 1 mL, however, such concentrations are too low for direct droplet-based scRNA-seq, and therefore concentrating the cells down to ∼1,000 cells/μL is required.\nTo concentrate the cells, transfer the pleural effusion fluid into a required number of conical 50 mL tubes and centrifuge at 500 × g at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant leaving ∼50 μL of supernatant on top of the cell pellet.\nCarefully disperse the cell pellet in the supernatant that was left in the tube. Repeat it for each tube.\nCombine all cell suspensions in 15–20 mL of Cell Resuspension buffer.\nNote: The resuspension volume depends on the size of the pellets obtained. 20 mL of cell resuspension buffer might be used per 250 mL of initial pleural effusion volume.\nTo purify the mononuclear cells, prepare SepMate-50 (IVD) tubes (STEMCELL Technologies) by loading ∼15 mL of Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) into tube’s separating hole until the fluid level is just above the dividing plastic.\nNote: One SepMate-50 (IVD) tube is required for up to 20 mL of concentrated cell suspension from step #22.\nSlowly layer 20 mL of concentrated cell suspension onto the Ficoll-Paque PLUS in the SepMate-50 (IVD) tube.\nCritical: When layering the sample, minimize the mixing of the Ficoll-Paque PLUS solution and the cell suspension, as that could compromise adequate separation.\nCentrifuge SepMate-50 (IVD) tube at 1,200 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C, with the centrifuge accelerator and break turned off.",
    "Remove 15 mL of upper fluid layer from each SepMate-50 (IVD) tube into a 50 mL Falcon tube. For the remaining ∼5 mL above the dividing plastic, gently pipette up and down to disperse and collect the residue residing above the dividing plastic.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g at 20°C–25°C for 3 min and discard the supernatant leaving ∼50 μL of supernatant on top of the cell pellet.\nRed Blood Cell Lysis.\nAdd 200 μL of Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (ACK buffer, Lonza) on a cell pellet and gently resuspend by slowly pipetting up and down 2–3 times. Incubate for 2 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: Always include RBC lysis even if blood cells are not visually evident in the sample.\nDilute the ACK buffer by adding 2 mL of Cell Resuspension buffer.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C. Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet, leaving ∼30 μL of supernatant on top of the cell pellet. At this point, the cell pellet should be whitish or yellowish.\nNote: If cell pellet at this step appears light red, repeat RBC lysis steps.\nProceed to “Part D. Cell staining with live-dye and anti-CD45 antibody[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]” section.\nPart D. Cell staining with live-dye and anti-CD45 antibody\nTiming: 25 min",
    "Cell staining with Calcein AM dye enables live cell identification. When this chemical dye is used in combination with fluorescently-labelled anti-CD45 antibody staining, the live-immune cells (CD45 positive fraction) and live-nonimmune cells (CD45 negative fraction) can be efficiently differentiated and selectively enriched. Staining cells against CD45 is particularly advantageous when tumor cells (CD45 negative) constitute a relatively small fraction (0.1%–10%) of the total tumor mass (e.g., in lung adenocarcinomas). The negative selection strategy (depletion of CD45 positive cells) provides an option to enrich cancer cells in the final cell suspension. Staining with anti-CD45 antibody is unnecessary when tumor cell enrichment is not required. However, sorting for live-cells is highly recommended for ensuring the high-quality of scRNA-seq data.\nCentrifuge the cells in FACS tube at 800 × g for 3 min at 20°C–25°C and aspirate supernatant carefully without disturbing the cell pellet. Leave 50 μL of supernatant on top of the cell pellet.\nDuring centrifugation, prepare either Cell Staining Mix for live-cells, or Cell Staining Mix for CD45-negative cells (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section for Cell Staining Mix composition).\nCombine the 50 μL cell suspension from step-32 and 100 μL Cell Staining Mix per roughly 106 cells from step-33. Gently rock the tube or pipette up and down 2–3 times to disperse the cells.\nIncubate on ice for 15 min.\nDilute the Cell Staining Mix in step-34 by adding 2 mL of refrigerated Cell Resuspension Buffer and centrifuge in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 800 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate supernatant carefully, add 2 mL of RPMI-FBS (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) FBS), and centrifuge at 800 × g for 3 min.\nWithout further delays proceed to “Part E. FACS: live-cell enrichment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]” section.\nPart E. FACS: Live-cell enrichment\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Generally, the cell sorting and enrichment may be performed on any conventional FACS instrument and does not require a special setup. The sorting settings are instrument specific. In this protocol we used BD FACS Aria II instrument equipped with nozzle 100 μm wide and sorting at speed below 6,000 events/second. It is important that the FACS-sorted cells are collected in Protein LoBind tubes, which possess reduced cell adhesion properties and thus increase cell recovery. However, because cell pellet can be easily dislodged easily in these tubes during pipetting, the aspiration of the supernatant after centrifugation should be performed carefully. The addition of 50 μL of RPMI-FBS medium will reduce cell death due to sample desiccation during the first minutes of sorting.\nResuspend the cell pellet in ice-cold 100 μL RPMI-FBS. Add DAPI dye at a final concentration of 0.1–1 μg/mL, and place the tube on ice.\nPrepare 1.5 mL Protein LoBind Eppendorf tubes with 50 μL of RPMI-FBS that will serve as collection tube for FACS-sorted cells.\nFollow the instructions of the corresponding FACS instrument to initiate the flow cytometry.\nSet appropriate sorting gates for capturing the live-cell populations of interest (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2088-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Setting the FACS gates for enrichment of live immune cells (CD45-positive) and live non-immune (CD45-negative) cells\n(A) The side scatter (SSC-A) and forward scatter (FSC-A) plot can be used to discard debris, however, we recommend to be inclusive in this gating to avoid potential loss of the cells of interest.\n(B) Side scatter height (SSC-H) and side scatter width (SSC-W) plot.\n(C) Forward scatter height (FSC-H) and forward scatter width (FSC-W) plot, are used to gate singlets.",
    "(D) DAPI and forward scatter plot facilitates identification of live-cells (DAPI negative), but we recommend again to be inclusive, as the complexity of clinical samples sometimes hurdles the clear identification of live cells.\n(E) FITC (Calcein) and PE (CD45) scatter plot is used to enrich live-cells that are positive for FITC. Immune cells (CD45 positive) and non-immune cells (CD45 negative) should be clearly separated in the PE (CD45) channel. Noteworthy that CD45-positive cells include several clusters in the flow cytometry plot, which mainly correspond to different immune cell types (T-cells, macrophages, etc.).\nNote: The CD45-positive cells will comprise several subpopulations of cells, accounting for the different cell types (T-cells, macrophages, etc.), which will appear as different clusters in the flow cytometry plot.\nFor enriching the live non-immune (tumor-enriched) cells set the sorting gates negative for DAPI and PE, and positive for Calcein.\nFor enriching the live immune cells set the sorting gates negative for DAPI and positive for Calcein and PE.\nNote: If tumor cell enrichment is not required and CD45 staining was not performed, set the sorting gate negative for DAPI and positive for Calcein dyes. This will account for all live-cells.\nInitiate cell sorting and collect FACS-sorted cells into 1.5 mL Protein LoBind tube filled with 50 μL of RPMI-FBS.",
    "Note: Knowing the exact count of CD45neg and CD45pos events during FACS provides an option for later combining the sorted cells at a desirable ratio and quantity. This might be particularly desirable in the situations when tumor cells constitute only a small fraction of all cells or when sorted CD45neg cells results in numbers insufficient for droplet-based scRNA-seq approach. Therefore, following FACS the sorted CD45 negative cells (representing the non-immune compartment) can be spiked-in with a known quantity of sorted CD45 positive cells (representing the immune compartment) to obtain an adequate cell concentration for droplet-based scRNA-seq.\nRecord the cell count during FACS.\nIf sorted CD45neg cell count is ≥50.000, proceed to the next step.\nIf sorted CD45neg cell count ≤50.000, combine the sorted CD45neg with sorted CD45pos cells to obtain at least 50.000 cells in total.\nCentrifuge cells at 800 × g for 4 min at 4°C.\nWithout disturbing the cell pellet, carefully aspirate the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellet in a required volume of RPMI-FBS medium to obtain ∼1,500 cells/μL. For example, if FACS count showed 50.000 cells, resuspend the cell pellet in 20–30 μL of RPMI-FBS medium.\nNote: In our experience the FACS count often turns out to be higher than the actual number of sorted cells. Furthermore, concentrating cells by centrifugation and subsequent removal of the supernatant, may also lead to undesirable cell losses. Therefore, when resuspending the cells in a final volume it is worth to consider the actual number of the cells in a pellet to be 30%–50% lower than what appears on a FACS instrument.\nWithout further delays proceed to “Part F. Droplet-based single-cell RNA-Seq[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6]” section.\nPart F. Droplet-based single-cell RNA-Seq\nTiming: 20–30 min",
    "The cells enriched with FACS are readily applicable for use with different high-throughput droplet microfluidic platforms (Klein et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Macosko et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Zheng et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), however, as cells tend to lose viability over time it may be desirable to choose the platform that offers fast sample processing. In our work (Chan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), we used Chromium instrument (10× Genomics) in combination with Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit (v3) to prepare the barcoded transcriptome libraries. For convenience, refer to Methods S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2088-Mmc1.extension] which provides manual for using Chromium instrument and reagent kit. We noticed, the actual number of sorted cells after FACS step tends to be 20%–50% lower than the number of sorted events registered during flow cytometry. Therefore, it is recommended to validate the number and viability of FACS-sorted samples under the bright field microscope. Performing a cell count, however, reduces the number of cells available for scRNA-seq.\nTo evaluate cell viability and concentration (cell number per μL) in the FACS-sorted sample, mix 5 μL of cell suspension with 5 μL of 0.4% (w/v) Trypan Blue Solution and inspect the cells using hemocytometer under bright field microscope, or alternatively using an automated cell counter (e.g., Countess II). Cells that are dead will appear dark blue.\nNote: When using automated cell counter, it must be ensured that the right focus is set to count all viable cells that vary in size and shape. It is a good practice to perform a quick visual check of the automated cell counter results by inspecting the trypan blue stained cells under a bright field microscope.\nIf cell viability is below 60%, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] table.\nIf cell count is below 500 cell/μL refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] table.\nIf cell viability is ≥80% and cell count is ≥500 cell/μL, proceed to next step.",

The SEQC pipeline performs read alignment, multi-mapping read resolution, as well as cell barcode and UMI correction to generate a count matrix (cells × genes).

This step is performed by regressing the number of genes detected per cell against the number of molecules in the same cell. Cells are excluded if the corresponding residual is greater than 3 standard deviations below the mean (Azizi et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nEmpty droplet filtering using CB2 (Ni et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).

    "Batch correction: Perform batch correction in the combined dataset of clinical samples using fastMNN (Haghverdi et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) with cosine distance applied to the log2 transform of the library-size normalized count matrix with pseudocount of 1, reduced to the top 50 PCs. We favor fastMNN due to the ability to perform hierarchical merging among samples. In particular, we first merge samples from the same patient, then from the same histology, with samples containing a greater number of cells merged first.\nBatch correction evaluation: Evaluate the effect of batch correction using an entropy-based measure that quantifies how much normalized expression mixes across patients (Azizi et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). For that purpose, construct a k-nearest neighbors’ graph (k=30) from the normalized dataset using Euclidean distance and compute the fraction of cells qT derived from each tumor sample T in the neighborhood of each cell j. Calculate the Shannon entropy Hj of sample frequencies within each cell’s neighborhood as:\n   H j  =    ∑  T  −  q T   l o g   q T   \nHigher entropy indicates that the most similar cells come from a well-mixed set of tumors, whereas lower entropy indicates that most similar cells derive from the same tumor.\nCritical: We do not recommend performing downstream batch correction in subset compartments of coarse cell types out of concern of over-correcting tumor phenotypes.\nPart I. Data analysis\nFollowing initial data pre-processing, downstream analysis focuses on dimensionality reduction, clustering and trajectory analysis, cell typing, factor analysis, differential expression, and gene pathway analysis, among others. These steps are illustrated in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Computational scripts and notebooks are available here[href=https://github.com/dpeerlab/SCLC_atlas-HTAN].\nDimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA):\nPerform PCA on the normalized expression matrix, implemented in Scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nRetain the top PCs based on the kneepoint of variance explained.

    "Construct a diffusion map based on the top retained PCs, implemented in scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nRetained the top diffusion components (DCs) prior to the largest eigengap, defined as the difference between two consecutive eigenvalues.\nCell clustering: These clusters represent discrete cell types or cell states in the single-cell data.\nCluster cells using Phenograph algorithm (Levine et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) based on the top retained PCs over a range of values for the parameter k (number of neighbors in the knn-graph) to ensure that subsequent cell typing is consistent.\nChoose k from the window where the adjusted Rand index between clusters is consistently highest. In general, we found that k = 30 provides stable clusters in all cell compartments, with the exception of the T-cell compartment where we used k = 40.\nDifferential expression: Down-sample cells to homogenize cell sampling per batch prior to differential expression.\nPartition cells from each cluster into 10 equally-sized bins based on cell complexity (number of genes expressed) for subsequent downsampling.\nNote: This partitioning to downsample within each bin will be different for different datasets.\nSubsample from each bin to at most k cells per sample, where k is the median sample size, such that cell complexity distribution is consistent across samples.\nUse MAST (version 1.8.2) (Finak et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) to perform differential expression between 1) each SCLC subtype vs rest, 2) SCLC-A vs SCLC-N cells, and 3) each unsupervised cluster vs rest.\nConstruct the regression model based on cellular detection rate (cngeneson, or number of genes detected per sample), tissue status (primary vs LN vs distant metastasis), and treatment status (naive vs most recently chemo-treated vs most recently immunotherapy-treated), as follows:",

    "Factor analysis: This approach excels in settings of continuous phenotypes that are less amenable to cell clustering. Here, cells and genes are projected into the same lower-dimensional space. The resulting latent factors are associated with weights or loadings for each cell and each gene. These cell and gene loadings can be used to associate gene programs to different cells.\nUse non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) implemented in scikit-learn with tolerance for stopping condition 10−4 and maximum number of iterations 500\nSelect the number of factors k.\nPerform NMF over a range of k from 5 to 100\nCalculate the reconstruction error for each NMF for a given k.

    "Cell typing: A hierarchical strategy for cell type identification proceeds first at coarse resolution (epithelial versus immune) and then fine resolution (basal versus NE cell).\nCoarse cell typing: At the coarse level, cell typing based solely on predominant expression of key gene markers below should suffice.\nImmune cells (PTPRC).\nEpithelial cells (EPCAM).\nFibroblasts (COL1A1).\nEndothelial (CLDN5).\nFine cell typing: At the fine level, cell typing is improved using cell type-specific gene sets rather than any single gene marker. Refer to Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2088-Mmc2.extension] for list of marker gene sets per cell type.\nSubset data and repeat steps 68–82 within each coarse cell-type compartment (without batch correction).\nNote: The analysis in the immune cell compartment benefits from Z-scoring the expression matrix prior to constructing the PCA. While the Batch Correction step can be repeated, we generally prefer not to batch correct if possible out of concern for overcorrecting biological signal and removing true tumor heterogeneity.\nZ-score the expression matrix.\nUse the score_genes function in scanpy, which calculates the average expression of each cell type-specific gene set and subtracts from the average expression of a reference set of genes.\nZ-score the subsequent cell-type scores for comparison and choose the maximum cell-type score.\nSmooth cell type labels by choosing the most frequent cell type label per cluster.\nConsistency check: Assess consistency of cell typing with key cell-type markers individually:\nWithin EPCAM+ epithelial cells.         Neuroendocrine (CHGA, CHGB, NCAM1, SYP, ASCL1, ASCL2, BEX1).         Non-neuroendocrine.             Alveolar epithelial cells I (AGER, CLIC5, PDPN).             Alveolar epithelial cells II (SFTPC, SFTPD, MUC1, GATA6).             Basal cells (KRT5, TP63, AQP3, DAPL1).             Ciliated cells (FOXJ1, CCDC78, TUBB1).             Club cells (SCGB1A1, SCGB3A2, CCKAR).             Hepatocytes (TF, CYP3A4, HP, ALB).             Ionocytes (FOXI1, ASCL3, CTFR).             Mucinous cells (MUC5AC, MUC5B, SPDEF).             Tuft cells (POU2F3, ASCL2, DCLK1).",

    "Use InferCNV (Patel et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) with the following parameters:         Sliding window of 200 genes.         Diploid mean and standard deviation based on available normal adjacent tumor samples.         Consider at least two standard deviations from diploid mean to represent a CNV.\nCalculate CNV burden using two alternative measures.         Fraction of the genome affected by CNV.         Pearson’s correlation between single-cell and bulk CNV profiles.\nCompare CNV burden between tumor and normal samples.\nTypically, tumor samples will display a bimodal distribution, with a lower peak corresponding to normal stromal cells and a higher peak corresponding to mutated cancer cells. Normal samples will display a unimodal distribution.\nBased on our normal samples in the SCLC atlas, we identified cancer cells using a threshold of >10% fraction of genome altered and Pearson’s correlation to bulk CNV profile rho >0.2.\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) subtyping: We recommend subtype classification based on phenotype rather than only the canonical set of four transcription factors (i.e., ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1).\nFeature selection: We recommend restricting analysis to a set of genes that excludes genes that are not subtype-specific. For instance, in our initial analysis of the SCLC atlas, we restricted to DEGs between each SCLC-subtype (SCLC-A, SCLC-N, SCLC-P, SCLC-Y) vs rest previously identified from bulk RNA-seq. We also exclude genes from cell cycle, hypoxia, and apoptosis pathways that are non-specific to SCLC subtype and might confound classification. These filtered genes included pathways from REACTOME_CELL_CYCLE_MITOTIC, REACTOME_MITOTIC_G1_G1_S_PHASES, HALLMARK_G2M_CHECKPOINT, HALLMARK_HYPOXIA, HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS downloaded from MSigDB. As we refined DEGs between subtypes in our single-cell atlas, one could now restrict analysis to these DEGs for subtype classification in any new dataset.\nIdentify the most representative cells for each SCLC subtype.\nIdentify the top 30 overexpressed DEGs per SCLC subtype from the bulk RNA-seq reference.",
    "Calculate the average Z-score over this gene set for each cell.\nLabel the top 100 highest scoring cells for each SCLC subtype as training examples for subsequent subtype classification.\nConstruct a diffusion map retaining the top DCs based on eigengap, as above.\nUse Phenograph classifier to perform Markov absorption classification in a Jaccard similarity graph constructed from the top DCs. This step will result in per-cell probabilities for each SCLC subtype, which can be considered a deconvolution of mixed subtypes.\nAssign the most likely SCLC subtype by the maximum probability."
