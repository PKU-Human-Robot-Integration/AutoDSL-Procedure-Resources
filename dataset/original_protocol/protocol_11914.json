    "The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the animal experiments described in this protocol.\n1. Preparations\nDesign a metal-tagged antibody panel. Use the free online panel design software12 and include 127IododeoxyUridine (IdU), 164Dy (Dysprosium) labeled anti-CCNB1 (CYCLIN B1), 175Lu (Lutetium) phospho (p)-HISTONEH3Ser28 (pHH3), and 150Nd (Neodymium)-pRETINOBLASTOMA proteinSer807/811 (pRB)13. Add additional metal-tagged antibodies that do not overlap in their channel signal14.\nPrepare an IdU stock solution. Dissolve IdU powder at 10 mg/mL in 0.1 N NaOH at 60 °C. Aliquot IdU stock solution into microcentrifuge tubes and freeze at -20 °C for long-term storage.\n\t\nAdjust the pH of IdU solution to 7.5 with 12 N HCl immediately before use. Test with a pH strip on a discard aliquot to ensure the solution is at pH 7.5.\n\t\tNOTE: Prolonged time (>5 min) of IdU at pH 7.5 will result in precipitation and a fresh aliquot of IdU is needed when this happens.\nUse appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses) and work in a safety cabinet when handling NaOH or HCl solutions.\nPrepare a 2x paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixing solution. Combine 5 mL of 10x PBS (pH 7.5) and 1 mL of 16% PFA with 44 mL of pure molecular grade dH2O (3.2% final concentration).\n\tNOTE: A stock of PFA can be prepared as previously published15 or purchase 16% stocks free of contaminating metals.\n\t\nUse appropriate personal protective equipment and work in a safety cabinet when handling PFA powder and solutions.\nPrepare barium (Ba2+) free 1x PBS by combining 5 mL of metal-free 10x PBS (pH 7.5) with 45 mL of pure molecular grade dH2O.\n\tNOTE: The quality of PBS and other reagents is very important to avoid contaminating metals that can introduce background noise during analysis of mass cytometric data.",
    "Prepare a 100 mM cisplatin stock solution. Dissolve 300.5 mg of cisplatin powder in 10 mL of DMSO. Store in aliquots at -80 °C. Prepare a 10 mM cisplatin working solution for experiments to be used over 1 d.\nPrepare epidermis/dermis separation solutions. Prepare a 20x dispase stock solution by dissolving 30 mg in 1 mL of HBSS or PBS. Filter sterilize through a 0.22 µm filter and store in aliquots at -20 °C. Prepare a 1x type IV collagenase stock solution at 1 mg/mL in HBSS, filter sterilize through a 0.22 µm filter, and store aliquots at -20 °C.\n2. Labeling of S phase by IdU incorporation\nWeigh mice. Use P1-P3 neonatal pups or 8-10 weeks old adult mice and use male or female mice from a C57BL/6, FvB, or 129 backgrounds. Determine a dose at 0.1 mg IdU (pH 7.5)/g body weight. For example, a 25 g mouse requires 0.25 mL of IdU.\nAdminister the dose of IdU by an intraperitoneal injection and wait for 2 h before harvesting cells. Use a tuberculin syringe to inject neonatal pups.\n\tNOTE: A dose of 2 mg/mL of IdU can be used with tissue culture cells with a 1 h incubation at 37 °C before harvesting and labeling for mass cytometry.\n3. Isolation of cells for labeling\nThaw dispase and collagenase stock solutions. Dilute the 20x dispase stock solution to 1x (1.5 mg/mL) in sterile HBSS or PBS. Keep on ice until ready to use.\nCombine 2 volumes of dispase with 1 volume of collagenase in a total volume that allows the skin to float freely. For example, digestion of 5 neonatal mouse skins can be floated on 8 mL of 1x dispase with 4 mL of collagenase in a 100 mm Petri dish.",
    "Follow approved methods to euthanize experimental mice (e.g., isoflurane overdose/toe pinch check or CO2 inhalation/cervical dislocation). Clean the adult ear skin with an iodine solution (see Table of Materials) and rinse with sterile water when isolated cells are to be used for tissue culture.\nSurgically remove the ear at the base (Figure 1A). Rinse ears in sterile PBS when isolated cells is to be used for tissue culture. Place on a dry 100 mm Petri dish.\nSeparate carefully anterior from posterior skin by initially creating a pocket in the middle or edge of the cut area using fine forceps and pulling the two skin flaps apart ( Figure 1B-D). Proceed with both the anterior and posterior skins.\n\tNOTE: Detailed instructions to dissect neonatal mouse skin are provided by Litchi et al.16 In addition, the use of a dissecting scope may assist in the separation of anterior from posterior skin and identification of epidermis/dermal sides of dissected skin: hair is visible on the epidermis side whereas the dermis will have a gelatinous appearance.\nCarefully place the anterior and posterior skins of the ear with the dermis side of the skin touching the dispase/collagenase solution ( Figure 1E). Use 1 mL for both the anterior and posterior skin of a single ear per well of a 12 well culture plate. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Alternatively, float skins on 1x dispase solution at 4 °C for 16-18 h.3\n\tNOTE: Work in a tissue culture hood with sterile technique when cells are to be cultured.\nPlace the digested skin with the epidermis side touching the surface of a clean Petri dish. Flatten out the skin and gently slide the dermis off the epidermis by working from center to the edges in a circular pattern.",
    "Discard the dermis or digest it further to liberate fibroblasts for tissue culture or analysis16.\n\tNOTE: The dermis will be darker in appearance and have a gelatinous and sticky composition. The dermis should easily come off. Failure or difficulty in removing the dermis suggests insufficient tissue digestion. However, extended incubation in digestion buffer will reduce cell viability. The epidermis will remain on the Petri dish and will have a bleached appearance.\nGently lift off the epidermis by grabbing at the edges and peel it off the surface of the Petri dish. Carefully place the epidermis on pre-warmed cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials) for 5 min at 37 °C or 20 min at RT. Use 500 µL of cell detachment solution for 2 adult ear epidermises per well of a 12 well culture plate and use 750 µL of cell detachment solution for a single neonatal epidermis per well of a 6 well culture plate.\nGrasp the epidermis using sterile forceps and scrub by dragging the epidermis against the bottom of the dish to dissociate cells. Add 1 mL of DMEM containing 1% FBS (0.01 mL) and pass through a 40 μm cell sieve into a collection tube. Rinse well with an additional 2 mL of DMEM and add to the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge at 120 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant carefully.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1-2 mL of DMEM containing 1% FBS. Determine the cell and % live cell counts using Trypan Blue and a hemocytometer or automated counting device. Pellet cells as described in step 3.11.\n\tNOTE: Cells can be cultured in appropriate tissue culture media after Step 3.12.17\n4. Cisplatin labeling to determine live/dead cells",
    "Resuspend 1-3 x 106 cells per 1 mL of DMEM containing 25 µM cisplatin (2.5 µL of stock/mL). Incubate for 1 min and quench by pipetting with an equal volume of FBS (e.g., 1 mL).\nCentrifuge at 120 x g for 5 min. Decant supernatant into a beaker containing diluted bleach and invert tubes to drain remaining solution onto a paper towel. Tap gently to liberate solution remaining on pellet and sidewall of the tube.\nResuspend cell pellet in 2 mL of Ba+2-free PBS. Pellet cells as described in Step 4.2.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to fix cells if they cannot be stained immediately.\n5. Fixation of cisplatin labeled cells (optional)\nResuspend 1-3 x 106 cisplatin labeled cells in 1 mL of Ba+2-free PBS. Vortex cells under continuous low power and add dropwise 1 mL (1 volume) of the 2x PFA fixation buffer. Incubate at RT for 10 min on a rocking platform.\nPellet cells as described in step 4.2, but centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min.\nWash cells with 2 mL of Ba+2-free PBS and pellet cells as described in Step 5.2. Repeat Step 5.3 once.\nResuspend the pellet in 2 mL of Ba+2-free PBS. Store at 4°C for <3 d. Add FBS to 3% (e.g., 0.3 mL of FBS/mL of cells) of the total volume if storing longer >3 d, then mix and freeze at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Fixation may affect the detection of certain epitopes. The effects of fixation on antibody signal need to be determined empirically.\n6. Barcoding of samples (optional but recommended)\nPellet cells as described in Step 5.2 and then resuspend 1-3 x 106 cells in 1 mL of 1x Fixation buffer (see Table of Materials). Incubate at RT for 10 min. Pellet cells as described in Step 5.2.",
    "Wash cells with 1 mL of Barcode permeabilization buffer (see Table of Materials). Pellet cells as described in Step 5.2. Repeat Step 6.2 once.\nAdd 100 µL of Barcode permeabilization buffer to barcodes (see Table of Materials)18 and mix immediately while the cells from Step 6.2 are pelleting.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 800 µL of Barcode permeabilization buffer. Add barcode solution to cells, mix and incubate at RT for 30 min. Pellet cells as described in Step 5.2. Wash cells in 2 mL of Cell staining buffer (see Table of Materials) and pellet again.\n\tNOTE: Up to 20 samples can be labeled with various combinations of Palladium metals18. Other barcoding strategies are described elsewhere15.\n7. Labeling of cells for mass cytometry\nResuspend 1-3 x 106 cells in 1 mL of Nuclear Antigen Staining buffer working solution (see Table of Materials).

Add 2 mL of Cell Staining buffer and pellet as described in step 5.2.",
    "Resuspend 1-3 x 106 cells pellet in 2 mL of Cell Staining buffer. Pellet cells as described in Step 5.2. Repeat Step 7.5 once.\n\tNOTE: Other buffer solutions can be used for staining extracellular membrane or cytoplasmic markers and experimenter may have to optimize staining if there is a need to detect epitopes in different cellular locations. Cells can also be fixed in PFA after Step 7.5 when using live cells for staining.\nResuspend 1-3 x 106 cells in 1 mL of intercalation solution and store for 1-3 d at 4 ˚C.\n\t\nStore cells at -80 °C in DMSO containing the solution for >3 d.
