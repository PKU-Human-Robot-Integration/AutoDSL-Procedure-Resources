    "Ethics Statement: This procedure involving human subjects has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Ajou University Hospital.\n1. Preparation for Surgery\nAllow a soft diet one day before surgery, with nothing by mouth after midnight before the surgery.\n\tNote: Do not insert a nasogastric tube before and during the surgery. This protocol does not use any tube to deflate the stomach. Instead of that, the intra-gastric gas can be aspirated by laparoscopic puncture needle if the stomach is distended causing limited view for laparoscopic surgery.\nAfter placing the patient on the operating table, administer the induction agent (Thiopental Sodium, 100 mg).\nAfter intravenous injection of a muscle relaxant (Rocuronium bromide, 1.0 mg/kg), insert the endotracheal tube through the oral cavity.\nStart the anesthetic gas (Sevoflurane, 2 - 3%) via the endotracheal tube, then monitor the patient for stability during surgery.\n2. Surgical Procedure before Intraoperative Gastroscopy\nPlace the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position, and stand at the right side of the patient.\nMake 10 mm incision at the infraumbilical area, and insert the first trocar into the abdominal cavity.\nAs soon as the trocar is inserted, connect the gas tube for carbon dioxide with the trocar to create a pneumoperitoneum of 15 - 18 mm Hg.\nInsert a rigid 30Â° laparoscope through the trocar, and explore the abdominal cavity on a monitor connected with the laparoscopic system.\nInsert 4 additional trocars (one 12 mm and three 5 mm) as working ports. Insert 12 mm trocar at the right upper side of the umbilicus. Insert other three 5 mm trocars at left upper side of the umbilicus and both upper outer quadrants of the abdomen.\nDissect the gastrocolic ligament along the transverse colon toward the inferior pole of the spleen using ultrasonic endoscopic scissors.",
    "Ligate the left gastroepiploic artery and vein originating from splenic vessels at the root with a laparoscopic clip and resect them using ultrasonic endoscopic scissors, after exposure of the superior border of the pancreatic tail.\nUsing ultrasonic endoscopic scissors, dissect the peripyloric lymph nodes around the pylorus and the head of the pancreas, and resect the right gastroepiploic vessels at their origin.\nBefore resection of the first portion of the duodenum, clamp the duodenum with a laparoscopic clamp to prevent migration of gas into the small bowel during the gastroscopic procedure (Figure 1).\n3. Intraoperative Gastroscopy\nMove to the left side of the patient's head to perform intraoperative gastroscopy.\nInsert a gum shield to protect the teeth and gums during intraoperative gastroscopy.\nTurn the head of the patient to the left side for insertion of the gastroscope.\nInsert the gastroscope into the stomach carefully through the mouth and the esophagus, to avoid injury to the mucosa of the oral cavity, the esophagus, and the stomach.\nInsufflate the stomach by injecting gas through the gastroscope to locate the primary lesion.\n\tNote: Most gastroscopes have a specific button to inject gas into the bowel during the procedure.\nApproximate the distance between the proximal margin of the tumor and the esophagogastric junction using the scale marked on the gastroscope (Figure 2), and perform total gastrectomy (as described previously) if the distance is too short to salvage the proximal stomach.10\nIf total gastrectomy is not necessary, insert an endoscopic injector through a small hole of the gastroscope, and inject 2 - 3 cc of indigo carmine into the gastric wall using an endoscopic injector at an area 2 - 3 cm proximal from the tumor margin, avoiding intra- or extraluminal leakage (Figure 3A).",
    "Insert the needle of the injector into the gastric wall obliquely to avoid the perforation of gastric wall by the needle. In addition, inject indigo carmine very slowly to identify intraluminal leakage during injection.\nAfter dye injection, aspirate inflation gas through the gastroscope to make the laparoscopic procedure easier.\n\tNote: Most gastroscopes have a specific button to aspirate inflation gas during the procedure.\n4. Procedure after Intraoperative Gastroscopy\nReturn to the right side of the patient after the gastroscopic procedure.\nIn the laparoscopic view, confirm the proximal portion of the tumor by identifying serosal staining by blue dye (Figure 3B).\nMark the stained portion to be resected with an endoscopic clip, avoiding involvement of tumor at the resection margin (Figure 4A).\n\tNote: We recommend performing this procedure within 5 - 10 min after surgery begins, because the dye can sometimes be washed out during subsequent procedures.\nIf the dye cannot be detected in the serosa, immediately re-inject the dye under gastroscopic visualization.\n5. Procedure after Intraoperative Gastroscopy\nResect the duodenum, and perform other procedures for lymph node dissection according to the Japanese treatment guidelines.11\nAfter lymph node dissection, resect the stomach at the proper location at least 3 cm proximal from the tumor margin, guided by the marking clip, using 2 endoscopic staplers.\nAs soon as the distal stomach is resected, insert the specimen into an endoscopic bag and withdraw it from the abdominal cavity through a 2 - 3 cm extension of the infraumbilical trocar site.\nSend the tissue from the proximal margin to pathology for intraoperative histological evaluation.\nAfter confirmation of tumor-free tissue in the proximal portion of the resected stomach, perform an anastomosis between the remaining stomach and the proximal jejunum with intracorporeal linear staplers (Figure 4B).\nSubscription Required.
