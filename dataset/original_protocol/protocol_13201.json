    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from the patients for including them and the data generated as a part of this study. Patients enrolled in this study were between the ages of 18-60. A total of eight patients were included in the study, five females and three males.\n1. Preoperative preparation\nUse the following inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling patients in this study.\n\t\nUse these inclusion criteria: Patients with a clear diagnosis of posterior cruciate ligament cyst by MRI of the knee; patients with significant knee pain, hyperextension pain, and other symptoms that may be caused by posterior cruciate ligament cyst or patients with combined meniscal injuries that require arthroscopic treatment; patients who have an interest in surgery because of the impact on their quality of life.\nUse these exclusion criteria: Patients with other serious medical conditions who cannot tolerate surgery; patients who refuse surgical treatment; patients with posterior cruciate ligament cyst diagnosed by MRI but without symptoms; patients with combined anterior cruciate ligament rupture or posterior cruciate ligament rupture.\nUse general anesthesia or neuraxial anesthesia for all patients. Place the patient in the supine position on the surgical bed. Apply a tourniquet to the affected limb in the middle and upper part of the thigh for no more than 1 h. Disinfect the affected limb 2x with iodophor and lay the surgical sheet.\n2. Establishment of arthroscopic approaches",
    "Use a blood-repellent belt to expel blood from the affected limb. Tighten the blood-repellent belt from the end of the limb to the proximal end. Make each lap overlap by 1/3. Do not insert soft tissue between each turn. Drain blood from the soft tissues of the operated limb. Inflate the tourniquet by applying 50 kPa pressure/force.\nEstablish an anterolateral approach, 1 cm above the lateral knee line and 1 cm lateral to the patellar tendon margin. Make an incision of about 0.5 cm in size from the skin to the joint cavity using an 11G sharp blade.\nEstablish an anteromedial approach, 1 cm above the medial knee articular line and 1 cm medial to the patellar tendon margin. Make an incision of about 0.5 cm in size from the skin to the joint cavity using an 11G sharp blade.\nInsert the arthroscope parallel to the tibial platform towards the intercondylar fossa in medial and lateral approaches, respectively. Explore the suprapatellar capsule, patellofemoral joint, medial trochanteric clearance, lateral trochanteric sulcus, anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, medial meniscus, and lateral meniscus.\nPartially remove the injured meniscus or suture the injured meniscus. Remove the joint-free body. Treat all injuries within the joint.\nEstablish a normal posteromedial approach as described below.\n\t\nFlex the knee at 90°. Insert the arthroscopy in the anteromedial approach to monitor the intercondylar fossa and place the switching rod in the anterolateral approach.\nInsert the exchange rod between the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and the medial femoral condyle into the posteromedial joint capsule under arthroscopic surveillance. There is usually a distinct sensation of slipping in and out.\nRotate the lens to the medial posterior joint capsule. See the triangular area formed by the reverse fold of the joint capsule, the medial femoral condyle, and the medial meniscus.",
    "Turn off the operating room lights. Observe the translucent area of the posterior medial skin surface of the knee (Figure 2).\nUse a lumbar needle to assist positioning (Figure 3). Eccentric puncture into the joint capsule in the translucent area (usually 0.5-1 cm behind the posterior femoral condyle and proximal to the articular line).\nMake a small incision of about 0.5 cm in the skin using an 11G sharp blade. Insert a straight clamp into the joint capsule under arthroscopic surveillance. Establish a normal posteromedial approach.\nEstablish a high posteromedial approach as described below.\n\t\nInsert the arthroscopy into the posteromedial approach. Insert the lumbar needle in the direction of the joint, 2-3 cm proximal to the posteromedial approach.\nMake the lumbar needle penetrate into the joint capsule in the triangular space of the medial posterior condyle, medial meniscus, and posterior joint capsule.\nMake a small incision in the skin. Insert a straight clamp into the joint capsule under arthroscopic surveillance. Establish a high posteromedial approach.\n3. Exposing and removing posterior cruciate ligament cysts\nInsert the arthroscopy in the high posteromedial approach. Insert the shaver in the normal posteromedial approach (Figure 4).\nRemove synovial tissue between the posterior cruciate ligament and the joint capsule using a shaver.\nFind the cyst, which is a translucent, raised synovial membrane around the posterior cruciate ligament (Figure 1C). Remove the cyst wall and see yellow and translucent fluid flowing out of the cyst wall, visualize compartment-like tissue in the cyst.\nRemove the posterior cyst wall completely. Avoid injury to the posterior cruciate ligament and posterior blood vessels and nerves and explore the posterior cruciate ligament without injury.\nInsert the arthroscopy in the anterolateral approach. See a portion of the cyst at the femoral terminus of the posterior cruciate ligament.",
    "Remove the anterior cyst wall and see yellow and translucent fluid flowing out of the cyst wall. Remove the cyst wall completely.\nRemove the synovial tissue in the V-shaped space between the anterior cruciate ligament and the posterior cruciate ligament. Probe the posterior cruciate ligament and check for damage to the posterior cruciate ligament.\nInsert the arthroscopy in the medial patellar approach. Check the V-shaped space between the anterior cruciate ligament and the posterior cruciate ligament for residual cysts.\nInsert the arthroscopy in the posteromedial approach. Check for residual cysts.\n4. Closure of the incision\nInsert the arthroscopic sheath in the anterolateral approach. Squeeze the suprapatellar capsule and completely drain the intra-articular fluid. Check knee extension and flexion activities from 0° to 120°.\nSuture the incision with silk thread No. 4.\n5. Postoperative rehabilitation\nQuadriceps exercise: Ask the patient to perform this exercise in the supine position. Straighten the affected limb, hook up the toes, slowly lift the leg upward to a height of about 15 cm on the heel, stay for 3 seconds, and then slowly lower it down.\nJoint release training: Ask the patients to perform this as they sit at the bedside and extend and flex the knee joint by themselves.\nAsk the patient to get out of bed on the second day after surgery and move appropriately, and gradually return to normal activities.\nChange the dressing every 3 days after surgery and remove the stitches 14 days after surgery.\nAsk the patient to perform non-confrontational activities such as jogging in the first month after surgery and resume normal activities in the third month after surgery.\n6. Postoperative care and follow-up\nAsk the patient to lie flat without the pillow for 6 hours after surgery. The patient was hospitalized for approximately 3 days.",
    "At 3 months after surgery, check whether the patient's range of motion returns to normal and 12 months after surgery, perform an MRI examination of the affected knee combined with arthroscopy to check whether there is discomfort in the affected knee and whether the cyst has recurred.\nSubscription Required.
