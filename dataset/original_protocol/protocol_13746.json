    "NOTE: This study was approved and performed according to the guidelines of the ethical committee of Fudan University.\n1. Anesthesia and surgical field preparation\nInduce intravenous anesthesia and perform orotracheal intubation or use a laryngeal mask.\nPlace the patient in a supine position with the head rotated to the contralateral side.\nSterilize the auricle and the external ear canal (EAC) with a povidone iodine solution; drape the surgical field with a blanket sparing the EAC.\nCheck the optical clarity of the endoscope and adjust its white balance.\nIntroduce the 0°, 3 mm diameter, and 15 cm length endoscope into the EAC. Remove the cerumen from the EAC with microscopic forceps and sterilize the EAC with the povidone iodine solution again.\n2. Establishment of a minimal invasive endaural approach\nAdminister local anesthesia to the EAC by injecting 1% lidocaine with adrenaline (1:100,000) at 7 and 11-o'clock positions.\nUnder the endoscope, make a circumferential incision with a round knife from 2 to 6-o'clock position, counterclockwise (right ear), approximately 8 mm from the tympanic membrane.\n\tNOTE: Use povidone iodine to clean the lens of the endoscope.\nRaise the tympanomeatal flap with a 1 mm diameter suction tube and a small piece of gauze soaked with adrenaline (1:1,000).\nUnder direct vision, make an intercartilaginous incision with a scalpel at the 12-o'clock position, from the previously made circumferential incision towards the meatus and through the stretched intercartilaginous incisura.\nMake another radial incision with the scalpel at the 6-o'clock position, from the previously made circumferential incision towards the meatus.\nRaise the flap enclosed by the medial circumferential incision and the two radial incisions outward with a curette. Check the exposure of the lateral wall of the attic and the posterior wall of the EAC.",
    "NOTE: The edge of the incision can be subjected to bipolar coagulation so that it shrinks, providing better exposure.\nPlace a self-retaining retractor to widen the meatus of the EAC and hold the lateral-based skin flap in place.\n3. Bone drilling and lesion removal\nTailor the tube of a disposable venous infusion needle to make a soft suction tube, which will be used in the bone-drilling stage. Make several side holes at its distal end with scissors (Figure 1).\nCut a small section of the tube of a disposable infusion set to make an electrodrill shaft sleeve that will protect the lens of the endoscope during bone drilling. Fix the sleeve to the drill handle with a sterile transparent sticker (Figure 1).\nPut the distal end of the soft suction tube (with the side holes) into the tympanic cavity, and connect the other end of the tube to a vacuum aspirator.\nExecute bone drilling in an inside-out direction starting from the posterior part of the scutum.\n\tNOTE: Here, a 1.8 mm diamond burr is used in the beginning to avoid tearing the tympanomeatal flap. After removing the posterior part of the scutum, lesions around the incudostapedial joint can be fully exposed. Drilling of the posterior lateral attic wall can be expanded If the lesion cannot be removed entirely.\nInstruct the assistant to irrigate the meatus of the EAC with saline continuously.\n\tNOTE: If necessary, additional clearance of bone sludge can also be done intermittently with the surgical suction tube.\nRemove the anterior part of the lateral attic wall by bone drilling if the lesion extends anteriorly.\n\tNOTE: The malleus head can be removed to facilitate the lesion removal.\nPerform an extended atticoantrotomy if the lesion extends further into the antrum.",
    "NOTE: The whole attic and antrum can be opened to facilitate lesion removal. Sometimes, the direct approach can be applied to the retrotympanum to remove the lesion with minimal bone-drilling5. In such an approach, the surgeon stands opposite to the affected ear and uses a 45° endoscope. The operating table should be tilted ~30° toward the surgeon to facilitate the introduction of the endoscope and the instruments. After lesion removal, lens fogging can be observed in some patients when the constant suction is stopped. This phenomenon will disappear if the tympanic orifice of the eustachian tube is blocked by a small piece of gauze. Of note, such a phenomenon could be used to assess eustachian tube function (fogging is a sign of good function). To observe this phenomenon, the balloon should not be too tight when endotracheal intubation is established.\n4. Reconstruction and closure\nCheck the integrity and mobility of the ossicular chain after lesion removal. Correct ossicular abnormalities with various mature surgical techniques6.\nHarvest a large piece of tragus cartilage with perichondrium on both sides.\nOn one side, detach the perichondrium from the cartilage with a round knife, leaving the perichondrium on the other side to form a cartilage-perichondrium graft. Tailor the cartilage-perichondrium graft for reconstruction.\nUse the cartilage-perichondrium graft and the perichondrium to reconstruct the lateral wall of the attic and the tympanic membrane.\n\tNOTE: If an extended atticoantrotomy is performed, part of the cartilage-perichondrium graft can also be used to reconstruct the posterior wall of the EAC.\nTailor and reposition the tympanomeatal flap and the lateral-based skin flap; pack the EAC with a gelatin sponge.\nSuture the intercartilaginous incision and pack it with gauze.\n5. Postoperative management\nAdminister intravenous antibiotics for 2 days postoperatively during hospitalization.\nRemove the dressing 2 days after the surgery, just before discharge.",
    "Apply oral antibiotics and ciprofloxacin drops for 2 weeks after discharge.\nRemove the stitches and the remaining gelatin sponge at the first visit, usually 7 to 10 days after discharge.\nOrganize future follow-ups according to the pathology and type of surgery."
