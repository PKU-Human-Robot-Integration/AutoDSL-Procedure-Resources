    "1. Plant Cultivation and Sample Preparation\nFlush each mineral wool block with 1-2 L of deionized water and subsequently with 1 L of 0.1% [m/v] fertilizer solution. Place one tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum or N. benthamiana) seed in each block and gently flush with 0.25 L of fertilizer solution without washing away the seed.\nCultivate the plants for 7 weeks in a greenhouse or phytotron with 70% relative humidity, a 16-h photoperiod (180 µmol s−1 m−2; λ = 400-700 nm) and a 25/22 °C light/dark temperature regime.\nMove the plants to the measurement apparatus. If the plants are immobile, harvest single leaves for the measurement of thermal properties.\n2. Determine Leaf Thickness and Density\nDetermine the leaf thickness\n\t\nPrepare a 2% [m/v] agarose solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and autoclave it. Let the solution cool down to 40 °C and embed a leaf sample placed in a Petri dish. Solidify the agarose by placing the Petri dish in a refrigerator at 4 °C for 30 min.\nCut the agarose block into 200-µm slices using a vibratome with a razor blade cutting angle of 15°. Use a cutting velocity of 1.0 mm s-1 and an amplitude of 0.5 mm.\nMount five transversal leaf sections on a glass slide using cyanoacrylate as a fixative. Determine the leaf thickness under a microscope with a 20× objective and an eyepiece with 10× magnification, using the measurement tools built into the microscope software according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nDetermine the leaf thicknesses in sample areas without veins.\nAlternatively, determine the leaf thickness with a dial-gauge at a vein-free area of the leaf blade. Make sure the dial-gauge is held perpendicular to the plane of the leaf blade.\n\t\tCAUTION: Cyanocrylate is a skin irritant and may also glue fingers together if not handled with care.",
    "Determine the leaf density\n\t\nDetermine the empty mass (m0) of a dry pycnometer, then fill it with water and determine the mass again (m1). Dry the pycnometer completely, place a leaf inside and determine the mass (m2) once more. With the leaf inside, carefully fill up the pycnometer with water and determine the mass (m3).\nCalculate the leaf density (Ps) using Equation 1.\n\t\tEquation 1: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq1.jpg\n3. Determine the Spectral Transmission and Reflection of Leaves\nPlace a leaf in the sample chamber of a UV/VIS spectrophotometer by fixing it between sample-holding clamps. For transmission measurements, place the leaf in front of the detector. For reflection measurements place the leaf at the rear of the detection chamber.\nLaunch the spectrophotometer control software. Select a spectrum from 900 nm to 1600 nm. Start a new scan and record the values for transmission (µT) and reflection (µR) displayed by the UV/VIS spectrophotometer software, based on the spectral curve.\nPerform all measurements with at least three biological replicates. Increase the number of biological replicates to five or more if a heterogeneous sample quality can be expected, i.e., variation in leaf surface morphology and thickness.\nCalculate the power for transmission (PT) and reflection (PR) by multiplying the measured µT or µR values by the measured laser power PLaser according to Equations 2 and 3.\n\tEquation 2: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq2.jpg\n\tEquation 3: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq3.jpg\n\tNOTE: The transmission can be also determined with a photodiode sensor during the measurement (see 6.3).\n4. Set up the Measurement Apparatus\nMount a fiber-coupled single-bar NIR diode laser (wavelength = 1,550 nm) into a 25.4-mm diameter cone on a stainless-steel holder. Connect a controller to set the output power (PLaser) of the NIR laser to 4-6 W.",
    "Place a bi-convex lens with a focal length of 25.4 mm at the end of the cone to adjust the beam width to 13 mm.\nPlace a photodiode power sensor 354 mm below the bottom of the lens. Then attenuate the photodiode by placing a neutral density filter with an optical density of 1.0 and a 22-mm ceramic layer above the sensor.\nConnect the photodiode power sensor to an oscilloscope using a coaxial cable.\nConnect a 10 × 10 cm frame which has a 6 × 6 cm sample exposure area with the scaffold of the measurement setup at a height of 308 mm below the lens (Figure 1). Fix the leaf position in space by mounting it into the 10 × 10 cm frame.\nConnect a NIR detector to a personal computer using a universal serial bus (USB) cable and install the interface software for the detector.\nPlace the detector at a 45° angle to the laser beam 135 mm above the ceramic layer. Align the measurement area of the detector to the laser spot on the sample by varying the sensor position and angle until the maximum temperature signal is observed.\nUse the laser control interface software to adjust the output laser power to 5 W and the duration of the laser pulse to 0.5 s. Select the \"Current control\" command in the control options window below the graphical representation of the laser power and adjust the laser power by typing \"5\" into the \"Power [W]\" field. Adjust the laser pulse duration by typing \"0.5\" into the \"Time [s]\" field.",
    "To determine the absolute laser power for each set of experiments, replace the photodiode power sensor with a thermal surface absorber power sensor at the end of each set of experiments and measure the laser output power for 20 s without a sample.\n5. Prepare the Leaf Samples\nUse intact and undamaged leaves for the measurements.\nIf relevant for the investigation, mimic typical leaf damage types by piercing the leaf with a scalpel, rubbing the leaf between latex gloves, exposing the leaf to an open flame or a laser beam for 2-3 s, or use other techniques to simulate other types of damage.\nCarefully but quickly mount the leaf sample between sample-holding clamps.\n6. Take the Temperature Measurements\nAvoid direct contact between the leaf and the ceramic attenuator placed above the photodiode sensor to prevent artificial heat transfer that interferes with the calculation of cp,s and λ (see section 9).\nUse the temperature measurement software to collect the temperature profile of the leaf sample for a total of 60 s via the NIR detector. First, record the temperature baseline for 10 s, then activate the laser for 0.5 s and continue data collection for 49.5 s.\n\t\nStart a measurement by clicking \"Measurement\" and then \"New Measurement\". Afterwards click the green arrow above the graphical representation of the thermal profile. Save the temperature profile by clicking on the \"Save\" icon (a stylized disk) above the graphical representation of the profile.\nConfirm the transmitted laser power using the photodiode power sensor by calculating the difference in signal for measurements with and without a leaf sample using an oscilloscope connected to the photodiode power sensor via a coaxial cable (Figure 2).\n\t\nDetermine the height of the two flanks (f1,S and f2,S) in the voltage profile acquired with the oscilloscope.",
    "Repeat the measurement without a leaf sample as a reference (f1,0 and f2,0). Calculate transmission µT as the ratio of these measurements according to Equation 4 (see also Figure 2).\n\t\tEquation 4: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq4.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Measuring leaf transmission using a photodiode power sensor.

Calculate the Specific Heat Capacity of the Leaf Sample\nCalculate the maximum temperature difference ΔT [K] during the laser pulse by subtracting the room temperature T0 [K] from the maximum leaf temperature Tmax [K] (Equation 5).\n\tEquation 5: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq5.jpg\nCalculate the energy absorbed by a leaf (ES [J]) based on the effective laser power and laser pulse duration (Equation 6), where PR [W] is the reflected laser power and PT [W] is the transmitted laser power.\n\tEquation 6: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq6.jpg\nCalculate the mass of the heated leaf area (mS [kg]) using Equation 7, where dS [m] is the leaf thickness according to 2.1), rLaser [m] is the radius of the laser spot, VS [m3] is the heated leaf volume, and ρS [kg m-3] is the leaf density according to 2.2).\n\tEquation 7: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq7.jpg\nCalculate cp,s[J kg-1 K-1] according to Equation 8 by dividing the absorbed energy ES by the product of the heated leaf area mass mS and maximum temperature difference ΔT.\n\tEquation 8: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq8.jpg\n8. Prepare the Temperature Profile Data for Thermal Conductivity Calculations",
    "Use the \"Export\" command of the NIR sensor control software to export the time and temperature raw data as a *.dat file and open the file in a spreadsheet processor.\nApply 1:100 data reduction, e.g., using an \"IF(MOD(Value;100)=0;\"x\";\"0\")\" command, resulting in a data density of one data point per 0.1 s.\nCalculate the average baseline temperature TB [°C] for each temperature profile over the initial 10 s of a measurement, during which the laser was still off. Then, calculate the difference between TB and the actual ambient temperature T0 [°C].\nUse this difference to individually normalize each profile by shifting it towards T0 (y-normalization), e.g., if TB-T0 = 2.0 K, then subtract 2.0 K from each temperature value in the temperature profile (Figure 3A).\nNormalize the time coordinate of each temperature profile (x-normalization) by deleting every data point before the maximum sample temperature (Tmax) and assign new time values starting with t = 0 for Tmax (Figure 3B).\nScreen each profile for sudden temperature shifts, i.e., temperature differences that are more than three times the baseline noise level, which is typically 3 × 0.31 K ≈ 1.0 K. Remove these regions from the data set because they correspond to measurement artifacts (Figure 3C).\nFit an exponential decay function (Equation 9) to the data using a spreadsheet processor, where Tt [K] is the fitted leaf sample temperature at time t [s], T0 is the ambient temperature, A [K] is the amplitude and t1 [s] the decay constant (Figure 3D).\n\tEquation 9: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq9.jpg\nUse the fitted function to calculate the temperature decline in the leaf sample from 0-80 s after the laser pulse.\nTransform the temperature data measured in [°C] to the [K] scale by adding a value of 273.15 to each temperature data point (Figure 3E).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835fig3.jpg",

Calculation of the Thermal Conductivity of the Leaf Sample\nCalculate the temperature difference between the leaf sample and the environment for each 0.1-s interval according to Equation 10, where ΔTx [K] is the temperature difference, Tt [°C] is the fitted leaf sample temperature and T0 [°C] the ambient temperature (Figure 3E).\n\tEquation 10: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq10.jpg",
    "Assume that the decline in temperature is due to the combined effect of convective heat transfer, thermal radiation and thermal conduction. Use the corresponding energy balance (Equation 11) as a basis for the calculation of λ, where ΔETemp[J] is the difference in the thermal energy of the sample at two consecutive time points, ΔErad [J] is the energy difference due to thermal radiation, ΔEconv [J] is the energy difference due to convective heat transfer, and ΔEcond [J] is the energy difference due to thermal conduction.\n\tEquation 11: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq11.jpg\nSubstitute the general terms in the energy balance with the actual physical properties yielding Equation 12, where ΔTt [K] is the difference in the fitted leaf sample temperature, ε the unitless emissivity, σ [kg s-3 K-4] the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, Arad [m2] the area of thermal radiation, h [J s-1 m-2 K-1] the convective heat transfer coefficient, Aconv [m2] the area of convective heat transfer, Acond [m2] the area of thermal conduction and l [m] the characteristic length.\n\tEquation 12:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq12.jpg\nCalculate the characteristic length l based on the correlation: l = V/A.\nUse the heated sample volume VS and the cross-sectional area of the leaf sample to calculate A [m2]. The cross-sectional leaf area corresponds to Acond according to Equation 13, where Acond is the area where conduction occurs, rLaser is the radius of the laser spot and ds is the leaf thickness.\n\tEquation 13: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq13.jpg\nCalculate Arad and Aconv according to Equation 14, where ALaser is the area of the laser spot.\n\tEquation 14: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq14.jpg\nSubstitute Equations 9, 12 and 13 into Equation 11 and resolve the latter for λ, yielding Equation 15 where tLaser is the laser pulse duration [s].\n\tEquation 15:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54835/54835eq15.jpg",
