    "Genomic DNA fragmentation by Covaris   Isolate high quality genomic DNA and determine concentration with a minimal yield of 1 μg of and a concentration of at least 20 ng/μl. Please see Note 2 for further details.    Pipet 500 ng of DNA input into each well of the 96 microTUBE Plate and add nuclease-free water to reach 27 μl per well.   Shear DNA in the E220 Covaris sonicator with the following settings:  Peak Incident Power (W) 175  Duty Factor 5%  Cycles per Burst 200  Treatment time 60 sec Proceed directly to the KAPA PCR-free Hyper-Prep.      KAPA PCR-free Hyper-Prep (Note 3)   End repair and A-tailing Fragmented DNA 25 μl End repair & A-tailing buffer (Hyper-Prep kit) 3.5 μl  End repair & A-tailing enzyme mix (Hyper-Prep kit) 1.5 μl  Total volume 30 μl  a. Incubate in a Thermal Cycler at 20 °C for 30 min followed by 65 °C for 30 min.  b. Proceed to the ligation step immediately.   Adapter ligation End repair & A-tailing reaction 30 μl  DEPC water 3 μl  Ligation buffer (Hyper-Prep kit) 15 μl  DNA ligase (Hyper-Prep kit) 5 μl  Adapter stock (2.5 μM) 2 μl  Total volume 55 μl a. Incubate at 20 °C for 15 min. b. Proceed to post-ligation cleanup step immediately.   Post-ligation cleanup Adapter ligation reaction product 54 μl Ampure (0.8x vol) 43 μl Total volume 97 μl   Mix gently and incubate at room temperature for 15 min to allow the DNA to bind to the beads.   Place reactions on a magnetic plate to separate beads from the solution. When the liquid is clear, remove the supernatant and wash the beads twice with 200 μl 80% ethanol.   Let the beads dry (as recommended by the manufacturer) before eluting with 25 μl DEPC water.   Pool the samples.",
    "A typical pooling strategy for 96 samples, representing 96 individual libraries for dosage analysis, would be to subpool 3 μl from groups of 12 libraries. The concentration of the 8 subpools is determined using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and equal amounts of DNA from each subpool are then combined into a master pool. The concentration of this master pool is determined using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and can be submitted for PCR-free Illumina sequencing if it is at least 20 ng/μl with total DNA content of ~1 μg. An additional Ampure (0.8x) purification, followed by elution at a lower volume may be required to increase the final concentration of the master pool. Irrespective of the pooling strategy, sequencing reads from pooled samples can eventually be reassigned to their respective samples based on the index sequence present in the adapters because the libraries are pooled after adapter ligation.   Submit the PCR-free libraries for sequencing [see (Note 3) for other options]. The Illumina sequencing platform used is typically single read 50 (Note 4). The number of reads needed per individual depends on the scope of the experiment and the genome size of the organism at hand [see (Notes 4, 5) as well as Figures 2 and 3].        Mapping and Dosage Plot   Trim the reads for quality and align them onto the TAIR10 genome using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (Li and Durbin, 2009). We have provided scripts called allprep.py as well as bwa-doall.py for this purpose. Detailed documentation of these scripts is available from the links provided.   Convert .sai files to .sam files after alignment (If you are using the bwa-doall.py script, this step is automatically performed by the script.). bwa samse [database] [filename]_aln.sai [filename].fq > [filename]_aln.sam   Run bin-by-sam.",
    "py in a folder that contains the sam files to generate dosage plots. Highly detailed directions and examples for this script is available from on the main documentation page or can be accessed directly here: http://comailab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/images/3/30/README-bin-by-sam.pdf.[href=http://comailab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/images/3/30/README-bin-by-sam.pdf] bin-by-sam.py -o output-bin-file.txt -s size-of-bins [-c control.sam file] [-u] [-m number of max snps, default is 5] [-b] [-r] [-p ploidy for relative percent calculation] [-C]. For help on the meaning of different parameters: bin-by-sam.py –h. Input: Run the script in a directory with the input _aln .sam files.  Output: One file with a line per non-overlapping, consecutive bin along each of the reference sequences and two columns for each input .sam file: one indicating the number of reads mapping to each bin and the other indicating the corresponding dosage relative to the control. Specific example: Recommended initial dosage plot analysis based on 1 Mb-sized bins in folder containing a group of .sam files as a starting point. bin-by-sam.py -o 1Mb_bin.txt -s 1000000 After running this initial analysis, the obtained read counts can be used as an indication of the appropriate minimum bin size. As a rule of thumb, no less than an average of 100 read counts per bin should be used (see Figures 2 and 3).   Parameters Required: -o, output file name (for example “-o Dosage_100kb_control2.txt”) -s, bin size in bps (for example “-s 100000” for 100 kb bins) Optional: -c, to use a control sample for relative percent coverage calculations, specify the file name here. If no file is specified, the mean of all samples is used as control value for each bin (Note 1). -u, to use only samtools flagged unique reads (XT: A: U), in which the read maps uniquely to only one location in the genome.",
    "-m, to specify the maximum number of mapping mismatches allowed for a read to be used. This looks at .sam field 15. The default is 5. This option can be increased if reads are longer or a high number of polymorphisms are expected between the reference genome and the aligned reads. Of course, the most important consideration is to ensure that the same criteria are used for all samples. -b, inserts empty lines between reference sequences in the result table for easier JMP parsing (Do not use if the reference sequence contains more than few major chromosomes or contigs). -r, “remove file”, a file containing a list of reference sequences to ignore, in the sam header format. There is an included example file Remove-Sample.txt in the archive. This option can be useful if the organelle sequences are included in the genomic sequence for example (Note 6). -p, ploidy, default is 2 (diploid), this is used as the multiplier in the relative dosage calculation. -C, coverage only mode, which only outputs the read counts columns for each library, but not the relative dosage columns. This option cannot be used when a control library is specified.   Data analysis The [sample]/control columns are plotted as an Overlay Plot on JMP for visualization (Figure 1). Other software platforms with graphing functions such as R can also be used as an alternative to JMP for generating the overlay plots for each (sample)/control column."
