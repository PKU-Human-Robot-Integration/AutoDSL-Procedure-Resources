    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransfection of hiPSCs with CRISPR-Cas9 tools\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step enables the transfection of hiPSCs with high efficiency and low toxicity using the Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 tools, yielding more than 70% of transfected live cells. The yield of transfected hiPSCs will provide enough material for cloning 384 hiPSC clones using single cell FACS sorting.\nAlternatives: Transfection techniques such as lipofection and magnetofection can be employed instead.\nSeed hiPSCs for cell transfection.\nExpand hiPSCs in culture to get the required number of cells for KO or KI generation (refer to the “transfection reaction mixes[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.6]” table in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nReplace hiPSCs culturing medium with hiPSCs single cell medium.\nAspirate hiPSCs culturing medium.\nAdd 1.5 mL of hiPSCs single cell medium.\nIncubate for at least 1 h at 37°C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 4% O2.\nNote: Pre-treating hiPSCs with 10 μM Y27632 will improve cell viability post transfection.\nCoat each well of a 6-well plate with 1 mL Matrigel solution for one hour as described earlier. Aspirate the Matrigel solution and add 1.5 mL of hiPSCs single cell medium per well. Refer to the “transfection reaction mixes[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.6]” table in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section to adjust the total number of wells needs to be prepared.\nDissociate hiPSCs as single cells.\nDissociate hiPSCs into single cell suspension as described previously. At this step, hiPSCs should be incubated with the GCDR for 20–30 min to ensure the complete dissociation into single cell suspension.\nNote: Pre-treating hiPSCs with the hiPSCs single cell medium (containing Y27632) enhances the viability post transfection and consequently prolongs the dissociation time.\nGently pipet the dissociated hiPSCs using 1 mL of hiPSC single cell medium per well.",
    "Pool the dissociated cells (from 3 to 5 wells) by transferring the cell suspensions into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nTake 50 μL of the cell suspension and proceed to cell counting using the Malassez counting chamber.\nOptional: Use trypan blue staining to observe dead cells appearing in blue.\nAfter counting, collect the suitable volume of the cell containing 1.106 cells for one transfection reaction and transfer into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Prepare the total number of tubes needed according to the “transfection reaction mixes[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.6]” table in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nCentrifuge the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes at 100 × g for 5 min at 21°C.\nDiscard the cell supernatant.\nTransfection of hiPSCs with CRISPR Cas9 RNP complex and donor DNA.\nAdd 100 μL of the transfection reaction mix per transfection reaction to each cell pellet from step 3.\nAdd CRISPR Cas9 tools according to the “transfection reaction mixes[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.6]” table.\nGently pipet up and down until the cell pellet completely mixes with the CRISPR Cas9 tools.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a nucleocuvette™ vessel.\nProceed immediately with the nucleofection using Program CA-137 on a 4D-Nucleofector Core Unit.\nRemove transfected cells from the nucleocuvette™ using a pipet provided by the nucleofection kit. Seed the transfected cells drop by drop in one Matrigel-pre-coated well of the 6-well plate containing 1.5 mL of hiPSCs single cell medium.\nIncubate for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere under hypoxic condition of 4% O2.\nAlternatives: HiPSCs can be incubated under normoxic conditions.\nProceed to single cell FACS sorting.\nOptional: Single cell FACS sorting may be performed 48 h post transfection. In this case, replace hiPSCs single cell medium with hiPSCs culturing medium the day after transfection.\nhiPSCs single-cell sorting\nTiming: 2 h",
    "Single cell FACS sorting of transfected hiPSCs is a strategy that allows (1) enrichment of hiPSCs susceptible to carrying genomic modifications and (2) clonal isolation/selection of hiPSCs. Since single cell culturing of hiPSCs is critical, a yield of 50% viability is expected after single cell sorting.\nPrepare 96-well cell culture plates for hiPSCs single cell sorting.\nCoat four 96-well cell culture plates with 50 μL of Matrigel solution per well.\nIncubate the 96-well plates at 37°C for at least one hour.\nRemove Matrigel solution by aspiration and then add 100 μL of hiPSC single cell medium per well.\nSingle cell dissociation of transfected hiPSCs.\nDissociate transfected hiPSCs into single cells as described in Passaging of hiPSCs by incubating hiPSCs with GCDR for 20–30 min.\nAdd 1 mL of hiPSC single cell medium and gently pipet the dissociated hiPSCs.\nTransfer dissociated hiPSCs into a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the dissociated hiPSCs at 100 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 500 μL of hiPSC single cell medium.\nPlace the 15 mL tube on ice until single cell FACS sorting.\nAlternatives: The use of enzymatic dissociation solutions such as Accutase® or TrypLE™ will accelerate the dissociation process. However, a dramatic decrease in clone recovery will be encountered after single cell FACS sorting.\nSingle cell FACS sorting.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70 μm nylon mesh cell strainer.\nNote: Filtering the cell suspension will prevent clogging of the FACS sorter if hiPSCs are not fully dissociated.\nAlternatives: 37 μm or smaller nylon mesh cell strainer can be used, but might not be sufficient to get the cell suspension out of cells doublets. In this case, you may use single cell FACS gating to distinguish cell doublets.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension into a 5 mL sterile polypropylene tube suitable for cytometry.\nPerform calibration and adjust gates as described in the FACS sorter set-up[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4] section.\nAnalyze the transfected cells to sort them and proceed with single cell sorting.\nInsert the four 96-well plates into the cytometer one at a time and sort one cell per well.\nIncubate the 96-well plates immediately at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere under hypoxic condition (4% O2).\nCulture, amplification, and freezing of hiPSCs clones\nTiming: 10–15 days\nThis step presents an optimized strategy for short-term culture of a large number of hiPSCs clones, suitable for genotyping and further amplification of genetically modified clones.\nKeep the hiPSCs clones in culture for a total of ten days by changing the medium with 100 μL fresh medium every two days. Use hiPSCs single cell medium during the first week after sorting and then switch to hiPSCs culturing medium for the last 3 days.\nCritical: Keep hiPSCs clones for two to three days after single cell sorting without changing media.\nNote: Use a multichannel pipette.\nNote: Make sure to use different pipette tips between the different wells to avoid cross-contamination.\nNote: Increase the culture time in hiPSCs culturing medium if hiPSCs clones grow slowly.\nIf the hiPSC clones form large colonies, dissociate and duplicate the clones in two wells of two separate 96-well cell culture plates.\nCoat 96-well cell culture plates with 50 μL of 0.05 mg/mL Matrigel® solution per well and incubate at 37°C for one hour. Prepare 2 plates for each plate of clones.\nRemove the Matrigel solution by aspiration and fill each well with 100 μL of hiPSCs single cell medium.",
    "Wash the hiPSCs clones twice with 100 μL of DPBS wo Ca2+/Mg2+, then dissociate them as described in Passaging of hiPSCs using 100 μL of GCDR per well for 5–10 min.\nRemove GCDR by aspiration as soon as the cells start to dissociate from each other, and before they completely detach from their support.\nNote: Not all clones may dissociate at the same time. Keep in mind that dissociation continues after aspirating the GCDR if cells are left without medium for a short time. Note that clones may be left without solution or medium for 5–10 min.\nAlternatives: Do not detach all hiPSCs clones at the same time.\nDetach cells by pipetting up and down with 100 μL of hiPSCs single cell medium.\nNote: Observe under the microscope to verify if the cells have detached well.\nTransfer 50 μL of cell suspension into two wells of two distinct 96-well plates.\nIncubate at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere under hypoxia (4% O2) for 24 h.\nReplace the medium with 100 μL of hiPSCs culturing medium every two days.\nNote: Cells usually reach confluency two to three days after duplication.\nNote: If the duplicated clones are too small, leave the cells in hiPSCs single cell medium after duplication.\nWhen confluent, lyse the cells from one 96-well plate for genotyping.\nWash the wells twice with 100 μL DPBS wo Ca2+/Mg2+.\nAdd 50 μL of QuickExtract DNA extraction solution to a confluent well.\nNote: Reduce the volume of QuickExtract DNA extraction solution to 20 μL if the cells are not confluent.\nScrape the cells at the bottom of the well using a pipette tip.\nNote: Use a multichannel pipette.\nSeal the 96-well plate with parafilm and freeze at −20°C for further DNA extraction.\nProceed with DNA extraction.",
    "Freeze the cells of the second 96-well plate for further amplification of the genetically-engineered clones of interest.\nWash the wells twice with 100 μL DPBS wo Ca2+/Mg2+ per well.\nDissociate the hiPSCs clones in 100 μL GCDR per well for 5–10 min.\nRemove GCDR by aspiration before the cells completely detach from their support.\nDetach the cells by pipetting up and down with 100 μL of CryoStor® CS10 cryopreservation medium.\nSeal the 96-well plate with parafilm and quickly transfer it to a −80°C freezer.\nCritical: This step carries the risk of cross-contamination. Handle the plates with care when sealing and transporting to the freezer.\nPause point: Cells may be stored at -80°C for at least 3 months.\nDNA extraction for genotyping of hiPSCs clones\nTiming: 1 h\nDNA extraction from hiPSCs clones will provide sufficient material for genotyping and identification of genetically-modified hiPSCs clones.\nDNA extraction.\nThaw the 96-well plate prepared for genotyping on ice.\nTransfer the DNA cell extracts into a 96-well PCR plate using a multichannel pipette.\nProceed with DNA extraction in a thermocycler using the following program: 65°C for 15 min, 68°C for 15 min and 98°C for 10 min.\nProceed directly to genotyping as described in Bray et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and Canac et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nPause point: DNA may be stored at -20°C for several weeks.\nThawing and amplification of genetically modified hiPSCs clones\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nAfter genotyping, thaw and amplify the genetically-modified hiPSCs clones of interest.\nDetermine the position of the hiPSCs clones of interest in the 96-well plate.\nFor one hiPSC clone to be amplified, coat a well of a 12-well microplate with 0.5 mL of Matrigel® solution at 0,05 mg/mL for at least one hour.\nAspirate the Matrigel® solution and fill the well with 1 mL of hiPSCs single cell medium.",
    "Thaw the 96-well plate prepared for clonal amplification by transferring the plate directly from the −80°C freezer to a 37°C incubator.\nNote: Do not use a water bath to thaw the cells to limit the risk of contamination.\nTransfer the 100 μL thawed cell suspension directly into the 12-well plate.\nIncubate at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere under hypoxia of 4% O2 for 24 h.\nReplace the hiPSCs single cell medium with hiPSCs culturing medium.\nRefresh the medium every two days and amplify the cells for banking.\nNote: Check under the microscope if cells were collected from the 96-well plate.\nOptional: If some cells remain attached to the bottom of the 96-well plate, you may add hiPSCs single cell medium directly into the 96-well culture plate and keep the plate in culture for clone amplification."
